“For all the shut down strangers and hot rod angels, rumbling through this promised land…”</em><br>
<br>
–<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen, “Racing in the Street”</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“The church doors thrown open/ I can hear the organ‟s song/ But the congregation‟s gone/ My city of ruins.”1</em> <br>
<br>
The United States of America met the twenty-first century with a 
tumultuous start, commencing a period stained with disaster, war, and 
division. The lyrics to “My City of Ruins” describe a powerful duality 
in which the “church doors” behind which the nation‟s sanctuary appeared
 safe and inviting and the “organ‟s song” of America‟s promise remained 
audible. Alone, all seems well. Yet, “the congregation,” a community of 
faithful Americans, is nowhere to be found. Such duality is the nature 
of the American reaction to disaster. Life goes on as normal and 
everything remains the same, yet simultaneously everything has 
fundamentally changed. The genesis of this is that tragic date of 
September 11, 2001, the events of which altered the course of the 
nation, changing its physical makeup only in the slightest way but 
changing its psychic state forever. From this initiation point, a decade
 of confusion would follow. Two of America‟s longest wars would 
simultaneously engulf the Middle East, while opening great divides at 
home. Hurricane Katrina destroyed only a few cities, relatively minor in
 the grand scheme of things, but sparked the country into conducting 
both a passionate relief effort and a heated national discussion about 
natural disaster. The coming of the 2008 Great Recession spelled misery 
for many American lives and changed the nation as a whole in its wake as
 Americans tried to cope with a shattered economy.<br>
These sorrowful developments all rocked America, opening schisms 
throughout the nation. None drew as significant a response as the 9/11 
terrorist attacks, to which the wars themselves were a reaction. These 
world-altering events changed the face of the country and require a deep
 analysis of the varied means by which Americans dealt with them. 
Hurricane Katrina‟s effect on New Orleans – both the city‟s problems and
 road to recovery – had much less an impact on the nation as a whole, 
but demonstrated a valuable microcosm of the Americancondition. The 
recession provides an epilogue to the hardship; it is not at all a 
promise of good tidings moving forward, but of continued troubles and 
more opportunities for America to fight and climb. All of it is 
meaningful in trying to understand the dual processes of conflict and 
resolution.<br>
<br>
The music of Bruce Springsteen traces these disasters, both man-made and
 natural, as he explores in-depth the outcomes and human reactions to 
these crises. The Rising as an album consists of a series of 
psychological perspectives representing American reactions to 9/11. 
Springsteen expressed antiwar sentiments during the tour in support of 
that album, as well as during the 2004, 2006, and 2007-2008 tours and on
 the Devils &amp; Dust, We Shall Overcome, and Magic albums. Also on the
 2006 tour, Springsteen demonstrated a response to Hurricane Katrina 
that represented the frustration surrounding the recovery effort, as 
well as applauding the spirit that would revive the city of New Orleans.
 Finally, on both the Wrecking Ball album and during the 2009 and 2012 
tours, he provided thoughts about the new roles that social and economic
 classes would be forced to play. Bruce Springsteen‟s music stands as a 
testament to several American traits – a strong national resilience in 
the face of pain, an immediate and emotional response (for better and 
for worse), a questioning of what is just, and a hard-fought attempt to 
repair shaken national and personal identity – all of which manifested 
themselves in crucial ways as a response to tragedy at the start of the 
new millennium.<br>
<br>
Springsteen has, throughout his career, been a musician of many voices. 
In his work he explores complex issues from various perspectives, 
representing a true attempt at understanding his world: “Springsteen's 
work as a whole can be considered as the expression…of development of 
his awareness of his country's historical, political, social, and 
cultural identity.”  Even a brief overview of his work demonstrates 
this; he built his career upon it, and to continue this pattern during 
his nation‟s most tumultuous era in his adult life can only be viewed as
 natural. In 1995, Springsteen released his first album of “voices,” The
 Ghost of Tom Joad, which represented a songwriting shift that would 
last into the 2000s. This record commented on crises of its time, 
particularly the experiences of immigrants and working class people 
living in the rural southwest: “On TGOTJ, the songs are populated by 
individuals struggling with inequity and against themselves, some having
 stepped out of newspaper stories or the as-yet-unnamed Hoovervilles 
that dot America today.” <br>
<br>
 The singers and protagonists of each song on the album tell their story
 (inspired by some believably real-world scenario) with starkness and 
honesty. It is a style that “gives the listener no quarter,” forcing 
them to engage the music.  This would be his style in future endeavors, 
whenever he elected to address a serious subject. As a result it would 
naturally show up in force on The Rising, Magic, and Wrecking Ball where
 he tackled the greatest contemporary American issues.<br>
“A few days after Sept. 11, Bruce Springsteen was pulling out of a beach
 parking lot in the Jersey Shore town of Sea Bright when a fan rode by. 
The man rolled down his window, shouted, „We need you!‟ and drove on. It
 was the kind of moment, Mr. Springsteen said, that made his career 
worthwhile. „That's part of my job,‟ he said. „It's an honor to find 
that place in the audience's life.‟”  The man in this story, named Edwin
 Sutphin (a fact revealed in a 2002 installment of the Today Show 
focusing on Springsteen‟s release of The Rising), got what he claimed we
 needed. On September 21, 2001, Bruce Springsteen would dedicate the 
song “My City of Ruins” as “a prayer for our fallen brothers and 
sisters” in honor of those who died on September 11.6 This song, written
 in 2000 as a call to support the rejuvenation of Asbury Park, New 
Jersey, would submit a greater appeal as the final track on 
Springsteen‟s The Rising, an album released in 2002 as a tribute to 
9/11. The record traces various stages and forms of coping with this 
tragedy, featuring the new style of writing Springsteen utilized first 
on The Ghost of Tom Joad. Each major issue is examined from both sides 
of hope and despair. The protagonists range from loved ones offering 
hope and prayers for those they fear are lost to the heroes themselves 
who have sacrificed for a cause.<br>
<br>
It is through these stories that Springsteen offers solace and 
opportunity for introspection, for their real-world counterparts quickly
 came to be the American brother or sister. Whether or not an American 
knew anyone killed or otherwise affected by the attacks, he or she 
became a part of it. This was the first reaction to disaster, and the 
most important: unity. This reaction demands not a personal connection 
to those harmed, but rather an understanding that it could have easily 
been personal because the people, as Americans, are one familial unit: 
“Identification with the tragedy depends not only on personal ties to 
victims or potential victims, but also on identification with a 
collective that is seen as an object of the attacks.” An honoring of 
heroes, the rally cry to “never forget,” the relief efforts in the 
disaster‟s wake – these happened because of the newly discovered sense 
of American unity. In the song “Into the Fire,” Springsteen sings from 
the perspective of the loved one of a fallen firefighter whose “love and
 duty called you someplace higher” and who “walked into the darkness of 
your smoky grave.” The bravery of these men who left the world behind to
 climb the doomed towers is an easily understood symbol of September 
11‟s heroes, and was one used by government and media to encourage 
strength.<br>
<br>
How could it not be so strong? The emotional imagery of hundreds of 
firefighters rushing to the towers, giving their lives to save others 
took a similar form to this piece from a New York Times article dated 
only two weeks after the attacks: “In all, 343 firefighters were 
reported missing or were identified among the dead…But the numbers tell 
only a fraction of the story. The faces and names say far more. A father
 and son. A chaplain. A commander. A rookie. Strangers to most of those 
they passed on Sept. 11, but heroes to them all.”9 This concept of the 
heroic firefighter builds unity by giving Americans everywhere a 
character to glorify and traits to desire. In “Into the Fire,” 
Springsteen does just this: “May your strength give us strength/ May 
your faith give us faith/ May your hope give us hope/ May your love 
bring us love.” Most of Springsteen‟s songs on The Rising are personal 
to the individual character, but this song is made different through the
 simple use of the word “us.” The singer prays that the traits of a hero
 will manifest in not only him or herself, but in “us.”<br>
<br>
The reaction to disaster consists of more aspects than the communal; the
 personal reaction in general is hugely significant as well. With unity 
being such a key element of the American reaction, the struggle to 
achieve and maintain unity is also key. Springsteen‟s music on The 
Rising traces these phenomena as well, featuring several more 
perspectives than he offered on the idea of mass togetherness. In the 
wake of 9/11, the surviving “heroes” and those who lost wives or 
husbands in the disaster became national symbols of grief: “The public‟s
 attention has naturally been riveted on the material that evokes the 
most emotion, the objects that were created in order to express grief or
 to tell a story.” In identifying historically significant artifacts, 
historians quickly realized that people gravitated towards the 
heart-wrenching stories of those who suffered loss and those who would 
have given their lives without a thought. The New York Times ran a 
series called “Portraits of Grief” in which they identified victims of 
the attack and provided anecdotes about them. Springsteen wrote a series
 of songs that go beyond this level of conveying information and drawing
 public attention.<br>
<br>
The first of these to appear on the album is the fourth track, “Nothing 
Man.” According to the fan-directed website “Brucebase,” this song was 
originally written in 1994 as part of a quasi-solo effort that also 
produced “Streets of Philadelphia,” “Back in Your Arms,” “Missing,” and 
“Secret Garden,” as well as the currently unreleased but circulating 
“Waiting on the End of the World:” “Springsteen recorded 7 or 8 new 
songs utilizing a 3-man backup band consisting of 1992-3 tour band 
members...[That band‟s guitarist Shane] Fontayne has mentioned the 
sessions in interviews and noted the working title of the album was 
Waiting On The End Of The World.”<br>
<br>
 This song was slightly retooled for its release on The Rising, and its 
story makes it clear why this old piece made the new cut. It tells of 
the isolation felt by a surviving first responder to Ground Zero, and is
 highly reminiscent of the story of firefighter Kevin Shea. Shea, an 
off-duty fireman who made his way to the scene, experienced amnesia and 
was unable to recall his experience at the towers. As a result, he felt 
unsure about the details of his survival: “He had become, in a strange 
way, a shrine for the living – the hero who had made it out…‟This isn‟t 
about me,‟ he told one man who praised his courage.”  Despite being 
revered as a hero, Shea could not recall his heroism. Springsteen‟s 
“Nothing Man” constructs a very similar situation in its first verse: “I
 don‟t remember how I felt/ I never thought I‟d live/ To read about 
myself/ In my hometown paper/ How my brave young life/ Was forever 
changed.”  This feeling is a non-specific exploration of the thoughts of
 a survivor; it could be anybody or nobody at all but it still conveys a
 strong sense of the reaction to being considered a “hero.” The song 
builds up to its key phrase in the third verse: “you want courage?/ I‟ll
 show you courage you can understand.” This all strongly relates to 
Shea‟s story. For everyone else, there is a hero of 9/11, but for him, 
there is just the courage to live – hardly a hero‟s trait.<br>
<br>
In the poignant “You‟re Missing,” Springsteen continues to carry these 
themes in a song about a widow or widower (aside from “The Rising,” “The
 Fuse,” and “Countin‟ on a Miracle,” sex is not specific in these songs)
 who feels entirely isolated from the world that continues on as normal 
without his or her spouse: “Everything is everything/ But you're 
missing.” This sentiment expresses the contradictory simplicity of the 
situation. While the world continues as usual, the only way it can, the 
one most important person in someone‟s life is no longer a part of it. 
In an interview with NBC, 9/11 widow Lyz Glick states: “It‟s tough, 
because you know there‟s still a bunch of times during the day when 
something will happen and I‟ll want to turn to him and pick up the 
phone, you know, as if it was yesterday, that he‟s still there.” 
Everything is everything, but you‟re missing. This song is written from a
 place where hope cannot be found and a future seems impossible. Coupled
 with the devastation in life is the isolation from society with the 
singer receiving “too many phone calls” and believing the “devil‟s in 
the mailbox.” This theme of social isolation connects with much of 
Springsteen‟s prior work, it being one of his primary subjects and one 
that he easily identified in the wake of this disaster.<br>
<br>
In the song “Mary‟s Place,” Springsteen addresses the duality of this 
issue a second time from a different perspective as he did with “Into 
the Fire” and “The Rising.” Unlike the desolation in “You‟re Missing,” 
he writes from the point of view of a person trying to come to terms 
with a lost loved one while also trying to avoid isolation and integrate
 himself into society. It combines the public in one moment (“Familiar 
faces around me/ Laughter fills the air”) with the personal in the next 
(“I dream of you in my arms/ I lose myself in the crowd”). A year after 
the attacks, the St. Petersburg Times ran a special edition featuring an
 article about three families who were still finding ways to grieve. 
While each case is different, the three families had one theme in 
common: “All the relatives who agreed to be interviewed shared some of 
the same feelings. They appreciated the public support after last Sept. 
11. But in the year since, they have come to realize that grief is 
private and recovering from the tragedy is lonely work.” They speak with
 Manuel Mojica, whose son, a firefighter, died at the site. In the 
aftermath, he found solace in the caring arms of the community: “When 
the New York Yankees came to town to play the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, he 
threw out the first pitch. He carried the Olympic torch in October when 
it passed through Ormond Beach on its way to Salt Lake City. In June, he
 helped the U.S. Postal Service dedicate a new stamp.” Mojica took an 
active role in accepting the support he was offered, and while it never 
replaced his son or his sense of loss, it gave him momentary relief. 
“Mary‟s Place” is all about the search for an answer to the question: 
“how do you live brokenhearted?” Springsteen suggests that the first 
step to healing is moving towards others, not pulling away. For people 
who are stuck and struggling to cope, finding community can be the small
 but potent action that is necessary for advancing, even if that sense 
of longing will always remain.<br>
<br>
The Rising as an album tends to address the psychological outcomes of 
the 9/11 attacks. The attacks were horrendous but they were the impetus 
for some good things, specifically, “the rising” about which Springsteen
 sings. In the words of psychologist Dr. Sherwin Nuland as interviewed 
in the New York Times: “in some ways, the communal sharing of the losses
 was good and true…This is, paradoxically, one of the healthiest things 
our society has gone through in our time. It has reversed the trend of 
distancing.” He is only half right in this statement, for there were 
other, darker “risings” brewing that Dr. Nuland failed to acknowledge. 
First came xenophobia: “on Sept. 15 [2001], Balbir Singh Sodhi, 49, a 
Sikh from Mesa, Ariz., was fatally shot while working at a gasoline 
station. When the police arrested a man in the killing, the report said,
 he screamed, „I am a patriot.‟”  While this incident is remarkably 
extreme and notable for being so outrageous, it is symptomatic of a 
societal problem that became common. The National Asian Pacific American
 Legal Consortium issues yearly reports tallying hate crimes against 
Asians in America. The 2001 issue was titled “Backlash” and found that: 
“In the three-month period following September 11th alone, NAPALC and 
its Affiliates documented nearly 250 bias-motivated incidents and two 
murders targeting Asian Pacific American.” The level of misunderstanding
 and blind hate overwhelmed the nation following the attacks. That the 
perpetrators followed Islam was enough to stoke violence against 
innocents: “The FBI reported a 1,600% increase in bias-motivated crimes 
against the Muslim American population.” This frightening trend was 
traced in Springsteen‟s “Worlds Apart,” which details a romance between 
an American and a Muslim. Neither the sex of each person nor the 
nationality of the Muslim are specified. In the most important line in 
the song, the speaker begs of the world(s): “May the living let us in, 
before the dead tear us apart.”  The romance serves as a metaphor for 
understanding between the West and the East. Having a peaceful relation 
is the ideal, while blaming an entire global community for the faults of
 a few is the antithesis and reasonable minds recognize this. These 
attacks created an environment where the ability to respect others 
became strained, on both sides. In Springsteen‟s words: “I‟ll meet you 
on the ridge, between these worlds apart.”  The assessment is that there
 are two worlds, they are far removed from each other, and there is a 
way to fix it – love.<br>
<br>
But on the evening of September 11, 2001, President Bush gave a succinct
 five-minute address to the nation. He begins with praise for the 
American people: “we responded with the best of America. With the daring
 of our rescue workers, with the caring for strangers and neighbors who 
came to give blood and help in any way they could.”  Immediately visible
 was the mass coming-together that would continue long after the day of 
the attack. The “best of America” which the president recognized in his 
speech is the same America that Springsteen called for in “Into the 
Fire” and “The Rising.” This speech contained a second, different vision
 as well: “we stand together to win the war against terrorism.” Indeed, 
this second idea of unity would come to be important in the decade 
following the attacks. From the very day of the tragedy, there arose a 
dual need for coming together for the good of society and for coming 
together in pursuit of justice and vengeance. Springsteen addresses 
these confused emotions in the song “Empty Sky.” Seeing the anger of 
those devastated by the events, he sang: “I want a kiss from your lips/ I
 want an eye for an eye.” In one breath, the singer pines for a 
relationship that has been ended suddenly and violently, and in the 
second breath he demands the justice that he is owed. This is the 
sentiment reflected in the president‟s speech and in society, as “the 
nation, as a people, turned to the president on the evening of 11 
September to receive reassurance and the promise of reciprocity; he 
provided it.”  While such reaction is a hugely significant outcome of 
the terrorist attacks, it is even more important in regards to the dawn 
of the War on Terror.<br>
<br>
When Springsteen wrote “Empty Sky,” this was not what he had in mind. 
With its sorrowful acknowledgement of the duality of grieving while 
hunting for justice, he never intended it to serve as a statement of his
 own beliefs, of his support for the dawning war or for the president. 
When he played it live on his tour in support of The Rising, the line “I
 want an eye for an eye” would often draw applause and cheering, cutting
 deep into the immaculate atmosphere created by this quiet, acoustic 
background and grating against the theme of the song. Deep into the 
tour, he began to comment on this strange reaction:<br>
<br>
Occasionally when I play that song, I hear some applause for a line, „I 
want an eye for an eye,‟ and as a songwriter, you always write to be 
understood. And I wrote that phrase as an expression of the character‟s 
anger and confusion and grief and it was never written to be a call for 
blind revenge or bloodlust. [At this point, the audience can be heard to
 cheer]. So, I just thought, given the times we live in, you can‟t be 
too clear about these kinds of things these days…Living in a time when 
there‟s real lives on the line and there‟s enough destructive posing 
going on out there as it is, I wanted to make sure that that line was 
clearly understood.<br>
<br>
And certainly, when America found itself embroiled in the fires of two 
violent foreign wars in the wake of 9/11, a reaction derived from the 
nation‟s heightened sensibility to global extremism and terrorism, 
Springsteen found several avenues to express the antiwar position. In 
2002 the E Street Band embarked on its tour in support of The Rising. 
Springsteen crafted a setlist that represented the current landscape of 
the American state of mind. Naturally, much of The Rising in all of its 
conflicted glory would be performed at the shows, and old familiar 
warhorses would unsurprisingly be cycled as well, along with some rare 
surprises. Most telling, however, was the nightly inclusion of “Born in 
the U.S.A.,” a song which had not been performed in a full-band 
arrangement in ten years, as Springsteen distanced himself from his era 
of massive fame in the 1980s. This song is a famously antiwar anthem, 
featuring a narrator who was “born down in a dead man‟s town,” shipped 
off to fight in Vietnam, and finally returned home and found that there 
was “nowhere to run, nowhere to go.” Playing this song was a way for 
Springsteen to ingrain himself in an antiwar position, and make it known
 before large audiences which side he came down on – and to tell them 
which side they should come down on, while he was at it. Springsteen 
took a moment during concerts on the tour before playing the song to 
briefly explain its meaning and why it was part of the show: “I wrote 
this song 20 years ago about the Vietnam War, I want to play it tonight 
as a prayer for peace.” Apart from that, he let the music do the 
talking.<br>
<br>
It should be noted that the antiwar position Springsteen advocated 
extended primarily to the war in Iraq, at least at first. In July 2002, 
he was reported in the London Times as having remarked: “The war in 
Afghanistan was handled well. It was deliberative, which I wasn't 
counting on.” While his subsequent antiwar comments were not 
specifically directed at one war or the other, he did not explicitly 
recant his opinion on the war in Afghanistan. This was the cautious 
approach that antiwar intellectuals and politicians took in 2002 – 
offering support for the war in Afghanistan but remaining vigilant 
against further action. A February 2002 opinion column in the Boston 
Globe advised and questioned future proceedings: “now that the shooting 
war in Afghanistan is over, it's time for Congress to revoke George W. 
Bush's free pass on foreign policy as well…The Afghan operation was 
brief and relatively inexpensive. So why is the Pentagon getting a blank
 check?”  That opinion piece as a whole strongly urges an end to what 
was perceived as blind government support and a rebirth of the right to 
disagree. While President Bush, his war, and his rapidly escalating 
hard-line stance against Iraq remained popular throughout that year, the
 antiwar movement gained some ground as well.<br>
<br>
On the weekend of February 15 and 16, people worldwide joined rallies 
and protests in opposition to the coming war. Across all America and 
across all walks of life, people came together for some of the largest 
demonstrations since during the Vietnam War. New York City, the arguable
 origin point of the conflict, was “speckled with professional peace 
activists, leftist doctrinaires, and a kaleidoscopic array of 
malcontents…a great many of those who converged on the East Side of 
Manhattan were the unaligned and unaffiliated.” Opposition to the 
government‟s policies and aggressive posturing was no longer restricted 
to the usual suspects. Present at the Manhattan gathering were 
grandmothers, level-headed students, businessmen unsure that “Bush has 
made a convincing case for war.”<br>
<br>
As for Springsteen, while The Rising featured a rather full spectrum of 
non-judgmental American reactions to 9/11, his music, his performances, 
and his words over the years would generally not portray the pro-war 
sentiment. The war in Iraq began on March 20, 2003, which was also the 
first date of the Australian leg of The Rising tour. Gone was the 
searing full-band, rendition of “Born in the U.S.A.” that had been a 
“prayer for peace” and an encore staple for the first six months of the 
tour. In its place, shows were opened with a solo acoustic rendition of 
the song, with no introduction necessary, followed by the revival of 
“War,” not played regularly since 1988. Springsteen tended not to 
comment on the war during the shows, again preferring to let the music 
speak for itself. If the earlier tour‟s standard setlist reflected the 
state of America, the new one did it better for a reality further 
augmented by war. This would continue through the second European leg 
and third U.S. leg; through that spring and summer, antiwar sentiment 
continued to grow. It would never in that time outstrip the support for 
the war, but the actual management of the war drew much criticism. 2004 
Democratic presidential candidate Richard Gephardt was quoted in the 
Boston Globe saying: “President Bush may have won the support of a lot 
of Democrats - including me - for his war effort there, but in his 
dissembling and mishandling, he's steadily losing every ounce of 
bipartisan support he once had.” He also commented that the image of 
President Bush standing on an aircraft carrier in front of a grand 
banner proclaiming “Mission Accomplished” had come into question, with 
the ongoing war less of an accomplished mission than a heaping “patch of
 quicksand.”<br>
<br>
At the second to last show of the 2003 tour, Springsteen performed a 
rare rendition of “Souls of the Departed,” which tells in its first 
verse the story of a soldier “detailed to go through the clothes of the 
soldiers who died” during the 1991 Gulf War.  To introduce the song, he 
played over the sound system a clip of President Bush discussing his 
assessment of Iraq and its fellow members of the “Axis of Evil,” as well
 as his own role on the global stage. Springsteen‟s intent was to echo 
the sentiment expressed by Gephardt, which had grown more acceptable 
over time. Without saying a word and manipulating the audio for artistic
 effect only, Springsteen publicly took his stance, reminding the 
audience about the roots of the current situation in the Middle East: 
“We will end the brutal regime whose aggression and weapons of mass 
destruction make it a unique threat to the world. [This statement was 
spliced with the next]. I also take responsibility for making decisions 
on war and peace. [The phrases „mass destruction‟ and „war and peace‟ 
are then repeated a few times each].” The contrasts highlighted in that 
audio clip, where President Bush talks about an aggressive regime with 
WMDs, while also claiming that he is responsible for wartime decisions 
that affect the globe, are an important addition to the overall American
 political response to trouble. That was Springsteen‟s final opportunity
 to remark on the war and the American experience before the end of the 
tour. He would remain more or less silent until late in 2004, shortly 
before the presidential election.<br>
<br>
Between October 2003 and October 2004, however, the war became a very 
important card in the hands of presidential candidates. It was a card 
that both sides of the American political spectrum would find a way to 
play very differently, even within their own parties. On the one hand 
was incumbent President Bush. The Boston Globe outlined his strategy for
 winning over the American people as one that simultaneously expressed 
his success at eliminating danger before it presented itself and his 
opponents‟ failures to do the same while inhibiting his actions. This 
became one of the signatures of his cowboy-like style and was termed the
 “„doctrine of preemption,‟ portraying President Bush as a visionary 
acting to prevent future terrorist attacks on US soil despite the costs 
and casualties involved overseas.” The contention was that the risk of 
not going to war would have, in the long run, outweighed the rising 
casualties. By going on the offensive in this manner, the sitting 
president attempted to sell the American people on his strength and 
perception. On the other hand, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, who had
 quickly taken the lead amongst the Democratic party‟s candidates, 
offered his own method of using the war to his advantage. He would stand
 up for himself against his opponent‟s calls of weakness while also 
explaining where his opponent went astray: “he would never let the 
United Nations or<br>
other countries prevent US military action „to protect our security, our
 people, and our vital interests,‟ but said President Bush's policy of 
„unilateral preemption‟ had failed to win the war on terror and only 
fueled anti-American anger worldwide.”<br>
<br>
How would the people react to these positions? In September 2004 the 
polls were showing that President Bush led Senator Kerry. Whether or not
 that fact indicated that people supported President Bush‟s handling of 
the war is debatable: according to a report by University of California,
 Berkeley political science professor David Karol, “theories – those 
stressing casualties per se as the driving force, and others that see 
their effect as conditional on public attitudes toward the war – would 
predict political damage to President Bush.” It is clear that the war 
was still a driving element of the campaigns as well as an influence on 
which candidate voters would support. Springsteen naturally made this a 
part of his own campaigning in October 2004, during the Vote for Change 
Tour that supported Senator Kerry. The “tour” (which only featured seven
 performances over a two week period) was a joint effort by 
“million-selling musicians including Mr. Springsteen, Dave Matthews, the
 Dixie Chicks, Pearl Jam, Bonnie Raitt, and John Mellencamp” as well as 
John Fogerty, R.E.M., Jackson Browne, James Taylor, and still a few 
more.62 To be clear, the stated goal of the Vote for Change program was 
voter registration, though the true goal (openly and honestly stated by 
the artists, like Springsteen) was a partisan one opposing President 
Bush. In the true spirit of America‟s dualities, these artists from 
various traditions united, but for the purpose of fighting against an 
opposing group. During the penultimate date in Washington, D.C., much of
 which was broadcast on television and the Internet, Springsteen 
proclaimed: “I believe that Senator Kerry and Senator Edwards understand
 these important issues and are prepared to help our country move 
forward…if you share our concerns, find the best way to express 
yourselves.” During these shows, Springsteen would take a few short 
opportunities to address the war, while performing much the same setlist
 each night. He began with an acoustic rendition of “The Star-Spangled 
Banner” and segued into “Born in the U.S.A.,” making an identical 
statement to the one he was making in 2002 and 2003. Additionally, the 
band would welcome John Fogerty as a guest and perform his songs “Déjà 
vu (All Over Again)” and “Fortunate Son,” both of which address the 
effect of war on the average American.<br>
<br>
In November, President Bush won reelection; the campaign rhetoric ended 
and the Middle Eastern conflict continued. In Bush‟s second term, 
support for the war continued to fall as it had over the previous 
year.64 And as in 2003 and 2004, it would again be the perceived 
mishandlings that prompted this sustained decrease in support. In 2004, 
shortly after the election, the simultaneous needs for cash and manpower
 began to dominate defense planning for the coming year: “One Army study
 described by Pentagon officials has concluded that the active-duty 
force of 500,000 needs to grow by as much as 30 percent. This year the 
Army was forced to borrow from the Navy and Air Force to pay its bills, 
according to officials.”  Both the Navy and Air Force, as a result, were
 expected to make deep cuts while the Army continued to search for funds
 in every nook and cranny. And as the financial toll increased, in the 
meantime, so also did the human toll. Reports of “soldiers” who felt 
unfit for a dangerous place on the battlefield were not uncommon: “At 
least 3,000 Navy and Air Force personnel…trained mainly in noncombat 
specialties such as mechanics and construction are serving on the front 
lines of the Iraqi insurgency.” Indeed, the financial struggles at the 
Pentagon produced this phenomenon. But for whatever reasons such 
specialists ended up on the frontline, one thing is certain – their 
fears were real, as danger lurked in every direction. Contemplating the 
war in the months following the election, Springsteen commented on this 
fear in a more general sense, recording the song “Devils &amp; Dust.” 
Writing from the perspective of a soldier overseas talking to a comrade,
 he attempts to incorporate an honest sense of anxiety: “we‟re a long, 
long way from home, Bobbie/ Home‟s a long, long way from us/ I feel a 
dirty wind blowing/ Devils and dust.” A creeping fear for the self and 
for others permeates this song, mirroring comments such as this one by 
the Navy‟s Lieutenant Lesley Smith: “We are definitely playing a part 
that is not a normal Navy role…We have sailors who were assigned to 
ships [who are instead] guarding oil platforms in the Gulf. These are 
definitely different roles. We call them dirt sailors.”<br>
<br>
It certainly is not an emotion limited only to soldiers and sailors 
placed in roles outside of the parameters of their training. Anxiety and
 more severe mental health problems are arguably the most important 
“reaction” (however involuntary) to war. Mental disorders are virtually 
endemic in warzones, and since the Vietnam War, they have been a close 
focus for Veterans Affairs and others concerned with the well being of 
soldiers past and present. These and other factors can increase their 
chances of having PTSD or other mental health problems” and testifies to
 the number of stressors faced sometimes daily by front-line soldiers. 
In “Devils &amp; Dust,” Springsteen covers all of these stressors. He 
highlights the fear of death, and the constant alertness (“I got my 
finger on the trigger”), as well as the real potential of seeing allies 
get killed: “I dreamed of you last night/ In a field of blood and stone/
 The blood began to dry/ The smell began to rise.” According to the VA, 
the mental health reactions Springsteen writes about are not uncommon. 
Approximately 220,000 soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan were 
diagnosed with a mental issue: “VA data show that from 2002 to 2009, 1 
million troops left active duty in Iraq or Afghanistan and became 
eligible for VA care. Of those troops, 46% came in for VA services. Of 
those Veterans who used VA care, 48% were diagnosed with a mental health
 problem.”<br>
<br>
Mental health problems are not nearly the only danger soldiers faced – 
physical problems and death are obvious ones as well. Additionally, the 
soldiers themselves are hardly the only ones affected by negative 
results of their service. Their families suffered alongside them. For 
his 2006 album We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions, Springsteen 
covered the Irish antiwar folk tune “Mrs. McGrath.” It tells of the 
titular woman and her son Ted, a soldier who returns home to tell his 
story: “Now I wasn't drunk and I wasn't blind/ When I left my two fine 
legs behind/ A cannonball on the fifth of May/ Tore my two fine legs 
away.”<br>
<br>
 “Mrs. McGrath” was written to capture not only the horrors of war but 
also what they wrought on the homefront: “All foreign wars I do 
proclaim/ Live on blood and a mother's pain/ I'd rather have my son as 
he used to be/ Than the King of America and his whole Navy” (note that 
the original lyric was “King of France,” which Springsteen changed for 
obvious reasons). This represents the most basic response – grief and a 
desire to return to how things were. Unsurprising, then, is the size of 
an organization such as Military Families Speak Out. By 2006, the group 
included “more than 3,100 families…They are Democrats, Republicans, and 
independents. More than 100 of the families have lost a child or 
grandchild in the conflict…Some of the soldiers have come home maimed, 
some suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.” A group like this 
is nonpartisan and their view of war as nonpolitical reflects its high 
personal cost. It is with this intent in mind that Springsteen portrays 
military families in his music, and they are neither silent observers 
supporting the mission nor radicals operating against the government.<br>
<br>
He does, however, attempt to address how these people naturally grated 
against the mainstream in 2007‟s “Gypsy Biker” on the Magic album, where
 he sings: “The favored march up over the hill in some fools parade/ 
Shoutin' victory for the righteous but there ain't much here but 
graves.”  At the same time that a community celebrates triumphs in war, 
the families of the deceased are left to pick up the pieces without 
their loved ones. Springsteen and these military<br>
families often offer the opinion that war is wrong. Here, Springsteen 
integrates that opinion, along with the anger of those who have lost, 
with the very basic fact is that war is destructive at its core: “You 
slipped into your darkness, now all that remains/ Is my love for you 
brother, lying still and unchanged/ To them that threw you away, you 
ain't nothin' but gone/ My gypsy biker's coming home.” This sentiment 
was not always popular. Many people, both average American citizens and 
military families, saw such an antiwar stance as a betrayal of the 
soldiers: “Not all military families agree with the group's actions. 
Tracy Della Vecchia of Columbia, Mo., founder of MarineParents.com, says
 such protests are harmful to the troops. „It gives ammunition to the 
terrorists, to the people who are against what we are doing.‟” Clearly 
there existed some strong reaction to the protests. The view that 
antiwar action is unAmerican and harmful to the cause is an old 
tradition, especially common since the Vietnam War. While it would not 
find its way into Springsteen‟s music – it would likely cause him to run
 against his own policy of portraying people neutrally – it was 
nonetheless an important counter-reaction to the antiwar family 
movement.<br>
<br>
In the end, Springsteen‟s handling of the war in his music deals with 
emotions and concerns that are antiwar in nature but not partisan or 
wholly accusative. He deals, ultimately, in understanding the two most 
basic parties in America affected by war – soldiers and their families. 
In 2007‟s “Devil‟s Arcade,” chronologically the last song he has 
released about the war in Iraq as it appears last on the album Magic, he
 sings: “A house on a quiet street, a home for the brave/ The glorious 
kingdom of the sun on your face/…On a morning to order a breakfast to 
make/ A bed draped in sunshine, a body that waits/ For the touch of your
 fingers, the end of the day/ The beat of your heart.” At the end of a 
song that ties together a fallen soldier and his or her grieving loved 
one, Springsteen presents in a stream of consciousness all of the things
 that they wanted but can never have – a home, the sunlight on each 
other‟s face, a loving touch, a heartbeat. Springsteen sings antiwar 
songs to tell these stories. It is his own concern, mirroring the 
broader national sorrow for decent people devastated by war, that gives 
him reasons to trace it in his art. This is why, during his 2006 big 
band folk tour, he revived Pete Seeger‟s old Vietnam tune, singing: “The
 church bells will ring with joy/ Bring 'em home, bring 'em home/ To 
welcome our darlin' girls and boys.”  He encouraged people to understand
 that the soldiers are, indeed, our girls and boys – that Americans are 
all part of a military family. He sees the end of war as a cause for 
celebration, and desired others to see that too.<br>
<br>
In the midst of the war, a portion of America was struck with another 
disaster, this one entirely natural. On August 29, 2005, Hurricane 
Katrina made landfall over New Orleans, a city which would come to be 
synonymous with the storm that destroyed it. This event and its 
aftermath would in due time be interpreted in various regions of popular
 culture. Movies were made about it (most notably Spike Lee‟s When the 
Levees Broke), it found itself on television in the form of the program 
Treme, and the ruined city even made it into a video game called 
Infamous 2, as the analogous “New Marais.” In music, Bruce Springsteen 
would write about and take inspiration from it when preparing for his 
“Seeger Sessions Band” tour. In a general sense, the reaction to this 
event serves well as an exemplar of the general American reaction to 
disaster: fighting against the odds, the city worked to restore itself. 
It took hard work, determination bordering on religiousness, and of 
course time. It is this trajectory that the nation follows, and that 
Springsteen traces in his contemplative music.<br>
<br>
Performing at the prestigious New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival on 
April 30, 2006, Springsteen commenced his one-off big band folk tour, 
choosing this special location to honor the musical tradition from which
 he drew inspiration for the project. During the show, he took a 
deliberate amount of time to introduce his new cover material, as well 
as his own reinterpreted songs. After performing a few songs, about a 
half hour into the show, Springsteen stopped to comment on the 
hurricane‟s destruction. He introduced a song written at an unknown date
 by Agnes and Bill Cunningham titled “My Oklahoma Home” that, in his 
words, “was written during the other great American natural disaster in 
our country‟s recent history that separated families, that drove 
Americans from their homes and left them spread out all across the 
country, the Oklahoma dustbowl.” This statement contains an important 
reflection – the comparison between the dust bowl (imagery of which is 
infamous in American consciousness) and Hurricane Katrina. Laurence N. 
Powell writes: “more than a million people exiled from their homes, a 
displacement dwarfing that of the dust bowl; and $80 billion in property
 damage, the greatest financial loss in American history. Those 
statistics alone lift the weather event…into the record books.”<br>
<br>
That the hurricane compares so negatively to the dust bowl is rather 
telling. The important question here, however, is not how do they 
compare, but how do Americans behave moving forward? Worth noting is the
 criticism levied at one very prominent American for his behavior: 
President Bush. In the weeks after the hurricane‟s landfall, many viewed
 his actions as underwhelming or disheartening: “Republicans normally 
loyal to Bush questioned whether the administration could handle a 
terrorist attack, given its lackluster response to Katrina. 
African-American lawmakers, meanwhile, bemoaned what they called 
inadequate help to some of the nation's poorest and least powerful 
citizens.” The somewhat iconic image of the president looking out the 
window of Air Force One while circling the flooded ruins of New Orleans 
immediately after the event became a symbol for some of his detachment 
from the disaster, to the point where President Bush himself considered 
it a mistake. In another iconic moment, during a live national telethon,
 rapper Kanye West offered his infamous opinion that “George Bush 
doesn‟t care about black people.” Regardless of the truth, much of this 
became a common perception and the president‟s approval ratings took a 
hit as a result. Springsteen highlighted this controversy in his 
introduction to “How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live?” where he
 labels Bush as “President Bystander.” In the song itself, Springsteen 
expresses the frustration of those affected: “He took a look around, 
gave a little pep talk, then he said „I'm with you‟ and he took a little
 walk.”  President Bush‟s attempts to assist and the aid he directed to 
affected areas yielded only minor results in the eyes of victims and 
onlookers around the nation. Without accepting any fault, he 
acknowledged the problem in his final press conference: “has the 
reconstruction been perfect? No. Have things happened fairly quickly? 
Absolutely. And is there more to be done? You bet there is.”<br>
<br>
The work that needed to be done rested largely on the shoulders of the 
people themselves, and the aid organizations that existed to support 
them. The Boston Globe ran a special on February 25, 2006 assessing the 
situation of the 300-block South Telemachus Street as a case study. 
Ongoing recovery efforts had, over five months, managed to clear the 
debris and businesses expected to reopen within two months. However, 
journalist Keith O‟Brien writes, “Just one home has electricity, and 
only one resident is living here. Life may be bustling in the Uptown 
section, where most homes escaped flooding, but not elsewhere. The 
French Quarter is open for business, but few tourists are there.” After a
 long period of struggle, the hard work began to pay off, but more would
 clearly be demanded. On the night of Jazz Fest, Springsteen explained 
his own song, “My City of Ruins:” “this is a song I originally wrote for
 my adopted hometown, Asbury Park…parts of it look a lot like parts of 
New Orleans right now. But it‟s working hard, it‟s working hard. So I 
want to sing this and dedicate it to the people and the city of New 
Orleans tonight.”  It was first written to applaud the rejuvenation 
effort of Asbury Park, then gifted to New York City as a prayer to begin
 again, and then dedicated to the hard work responsible for restoring 
New Orleans. <br>
<br>
With such entrepreneurial-minded people getting back to working and 
employing others, the city‟s recovery was under way. It demands more 
than just work, however. The backbone that allows the hard work to occur
 is strong determination. Obviously, but no less importantly, recovery 
demands time. Patience provides the context in which healing may occur. 
Those participating in the city‟s restoration all acknowledge the need 
to work hard over time. The owners of Finn McCool‟s, an Irish pub, 
looked forward to reopening several months after the hurricane: “In 
renovating the gutted pub, they had most electrical wires installed 
above last September's high-water mark, and the floor will be finished 
concrete, not wood. They are even optimistic that their crowd, or most 
of it, will return.”  Their renovations demonstrate knowledge that 
recovery is possible, and faith that normalcy can be achieved. 
Springsteen wrote a song late in 2006 titled “Long Walk Home,” the very 
name alluding to the challenge facing New Orleans after the disaster, 
that would appear (in edited form) on Magic. He sang “Now the water's 
rising 'round the corner/ There's a fire burning out of control/ There's
 a hurricane on Main Street/ And I've got murder in my soul.”  A grim 
depiction of the devastation, but not hopeless, as he also sings: “Here 
everybody has a neighbor/ Everybody has a friend/ Everybody has a reason
 to begin again.”  This was the truth in post-Katrina New Orleans. 
Working together and given enough time, the challenge could be overcome.
 In later years, it became clear that the city did rise to the task, and
 that the city was finding its footing again: “nearly five years into 
the process of rebuilding, people have started to talk about silver 
linings. In flooded areas, homes have been rebuilt better, safer, 
fancier. New Orleans, known for its abysmal school facilities, now 
boasts sparkling new high schools.” The New Orleans Saints football team
 won a massive symbolic victory in 2010‟s Super Bowl XLIV. In 2013, the 
Superdome, an icon of the hurricane‟s destruction and the inhumane 
conditions it delivered to residents, stood completely renovated and 
more than able to serve as the battleground for Super Bowl XLVII. The 
city overcame – in much the same ways as America as a whole overcame 
9/11, the Great Depression, the Civil War, and so many others.<br>
<br>
But trouble for America would not end. With memories of Hurricane 
Katrina fresh enough in memory and still in the midst of two wars, 
another disaster hit the nation; it was neither man-made nor natural, 
but financial. The causes of the 2008 recession were multiple and 
contentious, and as such an explanation would be best suited to a study 
of economics. But according to the U.S. National Bureau of Economic 
Research, the economic downturn officially began in December 2007, “the 
peak month, after determining that the subsequent decline in economic 
activity was large enough to qualify as a recession. Payroll employment,
 the number of filled jobs in the economy based on the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics‟ large survey of employers, reached a peak in December 2007 
and has declined in every month since then.”  From that time, industrial
 productivity and income from trade also took a dive, but rising 
unemployment is most necessary to examine as it constitutes the human 
center of the recession. Indeed, unemployment and economic “hard times” 
(a phrase used often by Bruce Springsteen, and throughout folk 
tradition) presented yet another challenge with which Americans 
contended. The response summoned a bleak aspect of the nation, as 
frustration, anger, and need overwhelmed.<br>
<br>
One of the minor yet important elements of the reaction was a speculated
 rise in certain crimes. Despite being a logical conclusion, it is 
actually contended that there is in no way a statistical correlation 
between a sinking economy and a rise in crime across the board: “crime 
increased during certain expansionary periods in the 1960s and… it 
decreased between 2007 and 2010. This isn‟t because crime is unrelated 
to economic conditions, but because it is related to so many other 
things as well.” This may be the case, but the face of crime is 
certainly impacted by economic trouble. Even if crime rates go down in a
 general sense, trends still develop. In a December 2008 and January 
2009 survey of 233 police departments, the Police Executive Research 
Forum reported: “Of the 100 agencies who linked crime rises to the 
economic crisis, 39 percent said they had seen an increase in robberies,
 32 percent an uptick in burglaries and 40 percent an increase in thefts
 from vehicles.” The idea that perhaps “normal” people may turn to crime
 under great duress develops within Springsteen‟s music at several 
points throughout his career. The song “Johnny 99,” originally on the 
1982‟s Nebraska and performed virtually every night of the 2009 tour and
 often in 2012 to highlight the recession, tells the story of a 
recently-unemployed man who botches an armed robbery and murders a 
clerk. He appeals not for mercy or forgiveness, but simply indicts the 
economic conditions that damned him: “Judge, judge I had debts no honest
 man could pay/ The bank was holding my mortgage they were coming to 
take my house away/ Now I ain‟t saying that makes me an innocent man/ 
But it was more than all this, judge, that put that gun in my hand.” 
This delineates the scenario in which a person committing crime knows it
 is wrong, yet feels forced into it. Neither condemning nor glorifying 
the perpetrator, Springsteen instead seeks to identify root causes in 
the social structure.<br>
More abundant and evident than the recession‟s effect on crime is the 
disastrous effect it has on the socioeconomic landscape. In his 2012 
song “Death to My Hometown,” Springsteen sings: “I awoke from a quiet 
night, I never heard a sound/ The marauders raided in the dark and 
brought death to my hometown/ …they destroyed our families‟ factories 
and they took our homes.”<br>
<br>
 And this was truly the case, it seemed. With the sharp rise in 
foreclosures and unemployment and sharp fall in spending around the 
nation over the course of 2008, it became inevitable. In September 2008,
 the Boston Globe reported “Workers filing first-time claims for 
unemployment surged to almost 500,000 last week, up more than 50,000 in 
the past month alone; new home sales plunged 35 percent from a year ago;
 and orders for computers, machinery, and other expensive equipment fell
 sharply last month, a sign that business are cutting spending.” In 
addition, consumers spent less on retail, and mortgage rates rose 
several tenths of a percent. Even in well-to-do corners of the nation, 
effects of the nationwide downturn could be felt. As Springsteen toured 
the country in 2009, he brought along a series of old songs unofficially
 labeled the “recession pack,” which consisted of “Johnny 99,” as well 
as songs like “Seeds” (written in 1985) and “Youngstown” (from 1995‟s 
The Ghost of Tom Joad) both of which paint a grim picture of honest, 
working folk losing their jobs to hard times. Performances of “The Ghost
 of Tom Joad” from the eponymous album, reminded audiences of the song‟s
 titular hero, the protagonist from Steinbeck‟s Great Depression tale of
 misery The Grapes of Wrath. Though only hinted at in news articles, 
Springsteen‟s songs gave a voice to the real people and situations upon 
which his characters are based: “when I die I don‟t want no part of 
heaven, I‟d not do heaven‟s work well/ I pray the devil comes and takes 
me to stand in the fiery furnaces of hell” and “well I swear if I could 
spare the spit/ I‟d lay one on your shiny chrome/ And send you on your 
way back home.”106 This swirling anger physically manifested itself in 
the form of the Occupy protests around America, their mission outlined 
in this article: “people have been pushed to the edge by mutations in 
the economy everywhere, from replacement of workers by machines to 
cross-border erosion of wage structures to the corporatization of 
agriculture to the hyper-productivity of robots to the crisis of 
public-sector financing that leads to mass layoffs.” The frustration 
driving these protests for equality, the heirs to protests of the 
Vietnam and Civil Rights era, represents a vital expression of American 
emotion. The operating ideal is that one need not be a member of the 
protest to be a member of the movement, a fact presented in their iconic
 statement of “„99 percent‟ as a slogan, branding the demonstrations as 
protest against the wealth gap that pits a tiny fraction of super-rich 
against everyone else.” While achieving little real success, the groups 
did have success in showing the anger of the common people, and for 
acting as a voice for those who appeared unable to speak.<br>
<br>
It is this group of people, the silenced and weak, whose lives are 
typically the most violently disrupted by economic hard times, and the 
2008 recession was no exception. The working poor and the homeless 
receive less much-needed assistance in these times: “Local charities, 
already facing shortfalls in government grants and gifts from 
individuals hit hard by the recession, now have another money worry: 
Foundations are cutting back as well.” The government receives less and 
distributes less, individual “ordinary” donors face their own financial 
challenges, and large charitable foundations find their resources spread
 too thin. Each situation results in less charity for those who need it 
most. Naturally, the smaller, local and regional charities also faced 
great challenges. During every American concert in 2009, Springsteen 
addressed this massive problem with a public service announcement 
coupled with a performance of Stephen Foster‟s 1854 “Hard Times (Come 
Again No More).” Springsteen sponsored a food bank or other major 
charity in each city visited (for example, the GreaterBoston Food Bank 
or Los Angeles Regional Food Bank) and explained to the audience members
 wealthy enough to afford tickets ranging from $75 to $120:<br>
<br>
I don‟t have to tell you what‟s happening out there. If you pick up the 
newspapers, you see millions of jobs lost since 2007, you see hundreds 
of thousands of jobs lost just over the past several months and there 
are many, many people who these organizations, these grassroots 
organizations is their only safety net, kids going to bed with some food
 in their stomach or going to bed hungry, these folks are out on the 
frontlines doing God‟s work at a time of great national turmoil and 
trouble.<br>
<br>
This was his attempt to draw people back to charity, to remind them that
 while hard times affect everyone, people needed help. In 2012, he would
 echo these statements while introducing his own song called “Jack of 
All Trades,” which describes a man who needs to be just that in order to
 survive the recession: “I'll take the work that God provides/ I'm a 
Jack of all trades, honey, we'll be alright.”111 In reminding people 
that, while the reaction to fend for oneself is natural, it is also 
important to help if one can, Springsteen highlighted an important 
American consciousness and a giving spirit that would be elementary in 
keeping the nation afloat during the recession.<br>
<br>
The final three tracks on Bruce Springsteen‟s 2012 album Wrecking Ball 
form a narrative arc prompted by the recession that begins during a 
hopeless situation, elevates out of that quagmire into an optimistic 
outlook, and concludes with the simple message that “We Are Alive.” This
 again speaks to duality, to the power of two related emotions or 
processes blending together to describe the American response. Such 
duality explained the reaction to the September 11 attacks, as people 
contrasted overcoming grief with succumbing to it. It manifested in the 
clash between people who came together in unity as Americans while also 
preparing to go to war, and again in the movement against the war as 
ambivalence rose throughout the nation. When Katrina struck New Orleans,
 duality highlighted the prevailing spirit of the survivors against the 
terrible destruction. And it explained why Springsteen would write: “You
 try to sleep, you toss and turn, the bottom's dropping out/ Where you 
once had faith now there's only doubt/ You pray for guidance, only 
silence now meets your prayers/ The morning breaks, you awake but no 
one's there” but follow it up on record by earnestly singing about a 
“Land of Hope and Dreams.”  As represented in Bruce Springsteen‟s music,
 this duality is the true nature of the American reaction to disaster. 
The struggle and the contrast can all be summed up in Springsteen‟s own 
words, as he laments: “without your sweet kiss/ My soul is lost, my 
friend/ Tell me how do I begin again?/ My city‟s in ruins.”</div>

Millennials hate Bruce Springsteen<br>
An entire generation has dismissed The Boss' music as lame "dad rock." Here's why they're all wrong<br>
BY EJ DICKSON</strong><br>
<br>
Every few weeks or so, I’ll be talking to someone at a bar or club or 
house party, and the conversation will inevitably turn toward Bruce 
Springsteen. The exchange is usually as follows:<br>
<br>
BAR PATRON/PARTY GUEST: So, what kind of music do you listen to?<br>
<br>
ME: Oh, a little bit of everything … blues, jazz, funk, Bruce 
Springsteen (brief pause) … you know, my tastes are super eclectic.<br>
<br>
BAR PATRON/PARTY GUEST: Um, why do you like Springsteen?<br>
<br>
ME: So, you don’t like Bruce Springsteen?<br>
<br>
BAR PATRON/PARTY GUEST: Ugh. No.<br>
<br>
(Long pause)<br>
<br>
ME: (Shuffling away while muttering angrily, like an elderly woman being chastised for feeding pigeons) Well, you should.<br>
<br>
This person will then enumerate the list of reasons why he dislikes 
Bruce Springsteen, usually employing four out of six of the following 
arguments:<br>
<br>
He’s old.<br>
He sucks.<br>
He sucks because he’s old.<br>
He’s old because he sucks.<br>
He sings about being a member of the working class even though he’s made millions and millions of dollars over the past 30 years<br>
“Born in the USA” sucks.<br>
In my 24 years as a die-hard Bruce fan, I have had this conversation 
approximately eight or nine hundred thousand times. While the people on 
the other end tend to skew toward a specific demographic — white, male, 
in a creative profession, dating someone with bangs and an Egon Schiele 
tattoo — they come from a wide range of socioeconomic and cultural 
backgrounds, from Bushwick installation artists to a bouncer I met in 
Ireland, who used his loathing for “Born in the USA” as a launchpad for a
 diatribe against Michelle Obama and the Gregorian calendar. Yet despite
 their many differences, these people have two things in common: They’re
 all around my age (i.e., in their early to mid-20s), and they all 
loathe Bruce Springsteen. The iron fist of Bruce hatred has come down on
 millennials, and it has struck even the best and brightest of us.<br>
<br>
To those not firmly ensconced in Boss fan culture, Springsteen’s 
unpopularity among hipsters and drunken racists might not seem like much
 cause for concern. Without a doubt, Bruce Springsteen is one of the 
most beloved American rock musicians of all time: He’s won 20 Grammys, 
has been inducted into the Hall of Fame, and has appeared on the cover 
of Rolling Stone enough that he’s probably single-handedly responsible 
for keeping it in circulation. He routinely sells out his world tours 
(his latest, for 2012’s “Wrecking Ball,” was just extended till 
February), and his following, as seen in the July 2013 documentary 
“Springsteen and I,” is so rabidly devoted to him that if Bruce wanted 
to record an album of Wesley Willis covers, there’d be thousands of 
bootleg YouTube videos of him singing “Suck a Cheetah’s Dick” at his 
Saskatchewan show.<br>
<br>
But here’s the thing about Bruce’s fan base: It may be huge, and it may 
be rabidly loyal, but it is old. Like, Peter, Paul and Mary fan old, to 
the point where David Brooks, in a recent New York Times editorial, 
referred to American Springsteen fans as “hitting their AARP years, or 
deep into them” (in Europe, where Springsteen’s fans are arguably even 
more fervent than their U.S. counterparts, the crowds tend to skew much 
younger). If you survey the audience at a Springsteen concert, you’ll 
see soccer moms and paunchy cops and ex-high school quarterbacks who are
 now working at insurance companies; there will be a smattering of frat 
boys and maybe the odd hipster in a battered “Asbury Park” tee, but on 
the whole millennials are vastly underrepresented. Put simply: If you 
gathered 50,000 Meadowlands ticketholders, maybe 15 of them could 
correctly identify Skrillex in a lineup.<br>
<br>
To a certain degree, this makes sense: Because Springsteen’s debut 
album, “Greetings From Asbury Park,” was released four decades ago, it’s
 reasonable to assume that those born between 1985 and 1995 (the “Tunnel
 of Love/Ghost of Tom Joad” demographic) would have less of an interest 
in him. “The idea of, when I was 18, liking a musician whose first album
 came out 40 years earlier — for me, that’d be like being really into 
Glenn Miller or something,”  Peter Ames Carlin, the author of the 2012 
Springsteen biography “Bruce,” says. Yet even for those of my generation
 who have a strong interest in older music, Springsteen is often 
associated with what fellow Springsteen-ographer Marc Dolan refers to as
 “dad rock.”<br>
<br>
“There are a great many [Springsteen fans] who embrace the length and 
breadth of Springsteen’s work, but the worst members of U.S. audiences 
at his concerts often want no more than a nostalgia fest,” says Dolan, 
the author of “Bruce Springsteen and the Promise of Rock and Roll.” “And
 if the crowd is most engaged when your parents are pumping their fists 
to ‘Out in the Street,’ remembering the good times before you were born …
 well, yeah, maybe I wouldn’t embrace that music if I was 20-something 
either.”<br>
<br>
In my experience, people my age who have even a passing interest in 
music and rock history consider Bruce a mawkish rock dinosaur, or what 
my friend Doug, a musician, refers to as “a physically fit, raspy-voiced
 oldie with veins popping out of his neck.” This probably stems at least
 in part from the fact that Bruce does not quite adhere to the hipster 
conception of an American rock hero: his sweat-drenched brand of earnest
 populism is at odds with Lou Reed’s chain-smoking nihilism, or Jagger’s
 strutting, high-cheekboned gender-fuckery. These dudes bear few, if 
any, artistic similarities to Springsteen, yet they all enjoy a certain 
type of indie cred that Bruce does not, in part because today, they 
don’t look like they’re working too hard (or at all, really). Working 
hard — to entertain and enlighten, to reach new fans and continue to 
rouse the passions of old ones — is what Bruce does best. It’s why his 
fans love him, but in this irony-drenched age of insta-stardom, hard 
work counts far less than it used to.<br>
<br>
Even in the classic rock canon at large, Springsteen is something of an 
idiosyncracy: He’s not as grizzled as Dylan or as jaded as Neil Young 
(although he is at least recently more prolific — and arguably 
consistently better — than both), nor does he have the swagger of a 
Robert Plant, or the dead sexiness (or sexy deadness) of a Kurt Cobain. 
My friend Ezra, a longtime Bruce hater, sums Bruce’s role in the rock 
god pantheon thusly: “MJ makes you want to dance, Dylan makes you want 
to smoke, Zeppelin makes you want to be an excitable teenager. I don’t 
know where Bruce would fit in my life, besides not liking his music.”<br>
<br>
Now, I am not going to deconstruct the above anti-Bruce arguments, 
because people are entitled to their opinions (even when they are, in 
this case, egregiously, desperately wrong). I’m not going to proffer an 
in-depth sociological explanation for this sweeping wave of Bruce 
hatred, because I think “a widespread generational embrace of postmodern
 irony accompanied by a universal rejection of all that is honest and 
genuine and joyous and sincere” pretty much says it all. And I’m not 
going to say that having to defend my favorite musician, over and over 
and over again, with people who know Bruce only as that guy who wrote a 
pro-Reagan song in the ’80s and once smushed his testicles into a 
cameraman during the Super Bowl halftime show, makes me angry, because 
it doesn’t.<br>
<br>
It just makes me sad. Profoundly, unspeakably sad.<br>
<br>
It makes me sad that these people will never listen to the opening 
chords of “Jungleland,” that they’ll never feel their hearts rise in 
their throats and their guts twist during Clarence Clemons’ sax solo. It
 makes me sad that they’ll never pump their fists to the triumphant, 
one-two-three gut punch opening bars of “Rosalita,” or roll their car 
windows down while waving their hands with the little pretties in “Tenth
 Avenue Freeze-Out,” or get ready to go out on a Friday while listening 
to Bruce espouse the endless possibilities of the “Night.”<br>
<br>
It makes me sad that future generations of restless suburban kids who 
want more out of life than day trips to the city on the LIRR won’t 
listen to “Badlands” or “Thunder Road” or “I’m on Fire” and be able to 
put a name to the desire for speed, for movement, the itch in their 
joints and the hum in the engines of their cars that’s begging them to 
run or drive or fly as fast as they can to anyplace that’s bigger than 
them, anyplace that has enough room to spare for all their wanting.<br>
<br>
That feeling of restlessness and exhilaration that Bruce speaks to in 
his songs will be around forever. But Bruce won’t be. Dude is pushing 
65. He can’t go smashing his balls into cameramen forever. And if this 
trend continues – if his music is listened to by progressively fewer and
 fewer members of younger generations – his fans won’t be around for 
much longer, either. He won’t reach the level of Zeppelin or Dylan or 
Kurt Cobain or Neil Young, artists who are still popular among those 
born decades after the pinnacle of their popularity. In 20 years, he 
will be a dinosaur, a Glenn Miller, duly respected in record books and 
Rolling Stone but virtually ignored by people born from 1995 onward. He 
will be known as the guy who sucked because he was old, or the guy who 
was old because he sucked.<br>
<br>
There is a small glimmer of hope for the continuation of the Boss’s 
legacy, however, which comes in the form of the next generation. I have 
met one of their number. She was 10 years old, and her name was Amanda. 
She was one of my campers when I worked as a bus counselor a few years 
ago, and when I wasn’t cleaning up puke or yelling at kids to buckle 
their seatbelts, I would sit with her and we would listen to “Magic” on 
her iPod while we talked about Bruce.<br>
<br>
She told me that she had already been to two concerts, and that her 
parents played Bruce around the house all the time. She told me that she
 liked to watch the 2000 DVD of his show from Madison Square Garden, and
 that she loved to dance with her dad when Bruce kicked off his set with
 “Prove It All Night.” I told her I used to do the same thing with my 
dad, who also introduced me to Bruce: I wasn’t particularly cool in high
 school, so I spent countless Saturday nights watching the MSG show with
 my dad while we got drunk and danced to “My Love Will Not Let You 
Down.”<br>
<br>
“Is there anybody alive out there?!?!?!?!” Bruce would scream on the TV,
 and we’d imitate the crowd roaring back. Then my mother would yell at 
us to turn it down, and my father would begrudgingly comply, only to 
turn the volume up on Nils Lofgren’s solo in “Youngstown.” It is, far 
and away, my favorite memory from high school.<br>
<br>
I told Amanda that my dad was also the reason why I loved Springsteen in
 the first place, and why I continued to hold strong to that love long 
after I actually started going out on Saturday nights and quibbling over
 Bruce with racists at bars. And it occurred to me that when Amanda got 
older, that bond would keep her relationship with Bruce strong as well, 
against the protestations of her anti-Bruce peers. I had faith that her 
fandom would stay strong in a Bruce-loathing world that was hostile to 
sincerity and rewarding of artifice, and I still hold out a tiny bit of 
hope that eventually, my compatriots will see the error of their ways 
and follow suit.<br>
<br>
So to those born between the releases of “Tunnel of Love” and “Tom 
Joad”: please Spotify “The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street 
Shuffle.” Get “Darkness on the Edge of Town” while you’re at it (though 
you can skip “Candy’s Room”), and “Born to Run,” and “Nebraska,” and 
“The Rising.” Watch a few of his shows on YouTube, then look me in the 
eye and tell me he doesn’t fit into your life, somehow; that he doesn’t 
make you feel exhilarated and overwhelmed and joyful and heartbroken and
 hot-blooded and alive. Because the next time Bruce asks me, “Is there 
anybody alive out there?” I don’t want to be lying on behalf of my 
generation when I shout back, “Yes.”</div>

Why I still love Bruce Springsteen.<br>
By Stephen Metcalf<br>
<br>
SLATE MAGAZINE<br>
Monday, May 2, 2005.</strong><br>
<br>
In his early live shows, Bruce Springsteen had a habit of rattling off, 
while the band vamped softly in the background, some thoroughly 
implausible story from his youth. This he punctuated with a shy, 
wheezing laugh that let you know he didn't for a second buy into his own
 bullshit. Back then, in the early 1970s, Bruce was still a regional 
act, touring the dive bars and dive colleges of the Atlantic coast, 
playing any venue that would have him. As a matter of routine, a 
Springsteen show would kick off with audience members throwing gifts 
onto the stage. Not bras and panties, mind you, but gifts—something 
thoughtful, not too expensive. Bruce was one of their own, after all, a 
scrawny little dirtbag from the shore, a minor celebrity of what the 
great George Trow once called "the disappearing middle distance." <br>
<br>
By 1978, and the release of Darkness on the Edge of Town, the endearing 
Jersey wharf rat in Springsteen had been refined away. In its place was a
 majestic American simpleton with a generic heartland twang, obsessed 
with cars, Mary, the Man, and the bitterness between fathers and sons. 
Springsteen has been augmenting and refining that persona for so long 
now that it's hard to recall its status, not only as an invention, but 
an invention whose origin wasn't even Bruce Springsteen. For all the 
po-faced mythic resonance that now accompanies Bruce's every move, we 
can thank Jon Landau, the ex-Rolling Stone critic who, after catching a 
typically seismic Springsteen set in 1974, famously wrote, "I saw rock 
and roll future, and its name is Bruce Springsteen."<br>
<br>
Well, Bruce Springsteen was Jon Landau's future. Over the next couple of
 years, Landau insinuated himself into Bruce's artistic life and 
consciousness (while remaining on the Rolling Stone masthead) until he 
became Springsteen's producer, manager, and full-service Svengali. 
Unlike the down-on-their-luck Springsteens of Freehold, N.J., Landau 
hailed from the well-appointed suburbs of Boston and had earned an 
honors degree in history from Brandeis. He filled his new protégé's head
 with an American Studies syllabus heavy on John Ford, Steinbeck, and 
Flannery O'Connor. At the same time that he intellectualized Bruce, he 
anti-intellectualized him. Rock music was transcendent, Landau believed,
 because it was primitive, not because it could be avant-garde. The 
White Album and Hendrix and the Velvet Underground had robbed rock of 
its power, which lay buried in the pre-Beatles era with Del Shannon and 
the Ronettes. Bruce's musical vocabulary accordingly shrank. <br>
<br>
By Darkness on the Edge of Town, gone were the West Side Story-esque 
jazz suites of The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle. In 
their place were tight, guitar-driven 
intro-verse-chorus-verse-bridge-chorus songs. Springsteen's image 
similarly transformed. On the cover of Darkness, he looks strangely like
 the sallower cousin of Pacino's Sonny Wortzik, the already quite sallow
 anti-hero of Dog Day Afternoon. The message was clear: Springsteen 
himself was one of the unbeautiful losers, flitting along the ghostly 
fringes of suburban respectability.<br>
<br>
Thirty years later, and largely thanks to Landau, Springsteen is no 
longer a musician. He's a belief system. And, like any belief system 
worth its salt, he brooks no in-between. You're either in or you're out.
 This has solidified Bruce's standing with his base, for whom he remains
 a god of total rock authenticity. But it's killed him with everyone 
else. To a legion of devout nonbelievers—they're not saying Bruuuce, 
they're booing—Bruce is more a phenomenon akin to Dianetics or 
Tinkerbell than "the new Dylan," as the Columbia Records promotions 
machine once hyped him. And so we've reached a strange juncture. About 
America's last rock star, it's either Pentecostal enthusiasm or total 
disdain.<br>
<br>
To walk back from this impasse, we need to see Springsteen's persona for
 what it really is: Jon Landau's middle-class fantasy of white, 
working-class authenticity. Does it derogate Springsteen to claim that 
he is, in essence, a white minstrel act? Not at all. Only by peeling 
back all the layers of awful heartland authenticity and rediscovering 
the old Jersey bullshitter underneath can we begin to grasp the actual 
charms of the man and his music. A glimpse of this old bullshitter was 
recently on display when Springsteen inducted U2 into the Rock 'n' Roll 
Hall of Fame on March 14. Springsteen had recently caught the new iPod 
commercial featuring the Irish rockers. "Now personally, I live an 
insanely expensive lifestyle that my wife barely tolerates," the old 
BSer confided to the audience of industry heavyweights, adding-<br>
<br>
Now, I burn money, and that calls for huge amounts of cash flow. But, I 
also have a ludicrous image of myself that keeps me from truly cashing 
in. You can see my problem. Woe is me. So the next morning, I call up 
Jon Landau … and I say, "Did you see that iPod thing?" and he says, 
"Yes." And he says, "And I hear they didn't take any money." And I said,
 "They didn't take any money?" and he says, "No." I said, "Smart, wily 
Irish guys. Anybody—anybody—can do an ad and take the money. But to do 
the ad and not take the money … that's smart. That's wily." I say, "Jon,
 I want you to call up Bill Gates or whoever is behind this thing and 
float this: a red, white and blue iPod signed by Bruce 'The Boss' 
Springsteen. Now remember, no matter how much money he offers, don't 
take it!"<br>
<br>
Every now and again, the majestic simpleton breaks character, and winks;
 and about as often, he works his way back to subtlety and a human scale
 and cuts a pretty great song or album. From the post-Landau period, the
 harrowing masterpiece Nebraska is the only record you can push on the 
nonbelievers, followed by the grossly underrated Tunnel of Love. The 
Oscar-winning "Streets of Philadelphia," an account of a man with AIDS 
slowly fading into his own living ghost, is the equal of any song he's 
written. In 1995 Springsteen produced The Ghost of Tom Joad, the 
culmination of a 15-year obsession with Woody Guthrie, whose biography 
he had been handed the night after Reagan defeated Carter, in 1980. <br>
<br>
The album is stronger than its popular reception might lead one to 
believe. "Across the Border" and "Galveston Bay" are lovely and 
understated and bring home the fact that Springsteen—a man who wrote 
monster hits for acts as diverse as Manfred Mann, the Pointer Sisters, 
and Patti Smith—remains a skilled melodist. Nonetheless, the record is a
 little distant in its sympathies, as if Springsteen had thumbed through
 back issues of The Utne Reader before sitting down to compose.<br>
<br>
His new album, Devils &amp; Dust, is a sequel to The Ghost of Tom Joad. 
It's mostly acoustic and intimate in scale; but Springsteen appears to 
have taken criticism of Tom Joad to heart, and Devils &amp; Dust is 
warmer, and in patches, fully up-tempo. It's hard to describe how good 
the good songs are. The title song is classic Springsteen—"a dirty 
wind's blowing," and a young soldier may "kill the things he loves" to 
survive. And on "Black Cowboys," Springsteen unites a visionary 
concision of detail with long lines in a way that channels William 
Blake:<br>
<br>
Come the fall the rain flooded these homes, here in Ezekiel's valley of 
dry bones, it fell hard and dark to the ground. It fell without a sound.
 Lynette took up with a man whose business was the boulevard, whose 
smile was fixed in a face that was never off guard.<br>
<br>
Though initially signed as a folkie, Springsteen has never been much of a
 technician on the acoustic guitar, compared to, say, the infinitely 
nimble Richard Thompson. But on Devils &amp; Dust there's a new comfort 
with the instrument; and he decorates many of the songs with a lovely, 
understated filigree. Ah, but how hard the lapses in taste! The strings 
and vocal choruses used to punch up the sound are—what other word is 
there?—corny. Next to, say, Iron and Wine, Devils &amp; Dust too often 
sounds like a chain store selling faux Americana bric-a-brac. One always
 suspects with Springsteen that, in addition to a blonde Telecaster and 
"the Big Man," a focus group lies close at hand. The album is 
suspiciously tuned in to two recent trends, the exploding population of 
the Arizona and New Mexico exurbs; and the growing religiosity of the 
country as a whole. Devils &amp; Dust is very South by Southwest—Mary is
 now Maria, there's a lot of mesquite and scrub pine, and one song even 
comes with a handy key to its regional terminology (Mustaneros: 
Mustangers; Pradera: Prairie; Riata: Rope). It's also crammed with 
Biblical imagery, from a modern re-telling of the story of Leah to 
Christ's final solacing of his mother. The first is a silly throwaway; 
the second is a fetching, Dylan-inspired hymn that ends with the teasing
 rumination, "Well Jesus kissed his mother's hands/ Whispered, 'Mother, 
still your tears,/ For remember the soul of the universe/ Willed a world
 and it appeared.' "<br>
<br>
The high watermark for Springsteen commercially, of course, was 1984, 
when "Born in the USA" somehow caught both the feelings of social 
dislocation and the euphoric jingoism of the Reagan era. Landau's mythic
 creation, the blue-collar, rock 'n' roll naif, has never held such 
broad appeal since. In recent years, Springsteen has settled into a 
pattern of selling a couple million albums (Born in the USA sold 15 
million) to the Bruce die-hards. A clue to who these people are can be 
found in Springsteen's evolving persona, which is no longer as 
structured around his own working-class roots. On a short DV film on the
 CD's flip side, Springsteen says he tries to "disappear" into the 
voices of the migrant workers and ghetto prisoners whose stories make up
 Devils &amp; Dust: "What would they do, what wouldn't they do, how 
would they behave in this circumstance, the rhythm of their speech, 
that's sort of where the music comes in." With Landau nowhere in 
evidence (he's thanked, but excluded from the album's formal credits), 
it is up to Springsteen alone to impersonate the voices of the 
dispossessed. The pupil has finally surpassed the master.<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, here I am, starting to hum its tunes, growing a little 
devil's patch, hitting the gym, and adding a distant heartland twang to 
my speech. (My wife, meanwhile, curls up on the sofa in shame.) You old 
bullshitter, you got me again.</div>
