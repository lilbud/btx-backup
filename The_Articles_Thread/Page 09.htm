				<div class="content">Review: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band at Sports Arena<br>
April 27, 2012 <br>
<br>
The LA Times<br>
 <br>
Halfway through Thursday night’s miraculous revival meeting cum concert 
at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, Bruce Springsteen stopped to 
recall his beginnings in the '60s and early '70s playing with a bar 
band. There was one type of music that was guaranteed to move a Jersey 
Shore crowd.<br>
<br>
“You always had to have a little soul in your pocket,” said the 
62-year-old artist with the vigor of a 30-year-old. Then Springsteen led
 the E Street Band — at 16 pieces, it’s officially a big band, not a 
rock band, now — through a medley of vintage Temptations and Wilson 
Pickett tunes.<br>
<br>
Testifying from a platform in the middle of the audience (the concert 
was sold out, as is Friday night’s), Springsteen stopped to guzzle a 
beer. He tossed the empty plastic cup, then fell backward on the 
outreached hands of fans, who passed their (tipsy) messiah up to the 
stage.<br>
<br>
Springsteen has always been a killer showman, someone who’s closely 
studied the great acts of R&amp;B (the Rev. Al Green and James Brown) 
and learned how to preach a story, milk a call-and-response affirmation,
 and play dead then get on up. But increasingly, the gospel roots of 
this soul man have made themselves manifest. It seems like this Catholic
 son has been spending time in black churches.<br>
<br>
By the point — two jaw-dropping, career-spanning hours into the 26-song 
night — that Bruce and the band boarded the train to the “Land of Hopes 
and Dreams,” he had some 40,000, mostly white, hands up in the air, 
vibrating with the spirit of the Holy Ghost.<br>
<br>
Another ghost was very much present in the arena, acting as the night’s 
guiding spirit, so to speak. Springsteen lost his musical soul mate last
 year when Clarence Clemons, the band’s saxophonist and the bandleader’s
 right-hand man, passed away. Judging by his repeated direct and 
indirect references to missing persons — culminating in a powerful 
screen tribute during “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” — Springsteen feels the 
loss keenly.<br>
<br>
Clemons’ nephew Jake has stepped in to ably fill the Big Man’s shoes on 
sax. But it was a gifted guest who drew out of Springsteen the kind of 
emotive, inspired interplay that made the old Boss and Big Man chemistry
 so joyous to watch. Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine and the 
Nightwatchman joined the band for several songs, adding his bent-metal 
cries to their already stellar guitar lineup. (All hail Nils Lofgren and
 Little Steven Van Zandt. Springsteen ain’t no slouch at the ax either.)<br>
<br>
On the haunting 1995 protest ballad “The Ghost of Tom Joad,” Morello 
proclaimed the lyrics inspired by "The Grapes of Wrath": “Wherever 
there's somebody fightin' for a place to stand/ Or decent job or a 
helpin' hand / Wherever somebody's strugglin' to be free / Look in their
 eyes, Mom, you'll see me.”<br>
<br>
 <br>
Then stroking, beating, hugging and pounding his custom Arm the Homeless
 guitar, Morello made it a sword, a trumpet, a beat box, a megaphone. It
 was an ear-shattering, time-stopping performance to which the audience 
played mesmerized witness. Tom Joad was there, and Clemons, and deceased
 E Street keyboardist Danny Federici too.<br>
The evening was not morbid. Ultimately, it was about love and life. 
Springsteen dusted off “The Ties That Bind,” finding its doo-wop heart 
with his wife Patti Scialfa on harmony. There were “new faces and old 
faces,” as he said early on. A horn section and the two-membered E 
Street choir added new blood to the storied band. Most of the players — 
the mighty Max Weinberg, good-guy bassist Garry Tallent, mastermind 
pianist Roy Bittan — have been with their boss for decades.<br>
<br>
One of the things that makes Springsteen the greatest musical performer 
of our time is the deep love with which he ministers to his flock. The 
arena was filled with a rare vibe, a feeling of brotherly and sisterly 
(Springsteen danced with his younger sibling on “Dancing in the Dark”) 
love. When’s the last time the big Canadian strangers next to you bought
 you and your husband a beer during an arena show?<br>
<br>
From “The Rising” after 9/11 to “My City in Ruins” post-Katrina to 
99-percenter testimonials such as “Jack of All Trades” (performed with 
stark, brutal power Thursday) off his new album, “Wrecking Ball,” 
Springsteen has an unmatched gift for expressing our national pain — and
 also delivering us from it. “Keep pushing till it’s understood and 
these badlands start treating us good,” he sang in the show’s opener, 
his 1978 classic “Badlands.” The magnitude of his personal loss made the
 catharsis Thursday that much more deeply felt.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and the band barely paused during the 2 hour and 40 minute 
concert. Dripping sweat, the sexagenarian even slid across the stage on 
his knees in his trademark fashion.<br>
<br>
This was perhaps the most inspirational show I’ve witnessed in 30 years 
of attending thousands of concerts, including at least a dozen by 
Springsteen. There was maybe one better: When he played Jazz Fest in New
 Orleans after Katrina and turned the city of ruins into a city reborn. 
But Morello’s lead on “Ghost of Tom Joad” will be forever seared into my
 conscience as a testimonial, and a hope.</div>

				<div class="content">An Epic Night in Philadelphia<br>
September 5, 2012 By John Fea<br>
<br>
<br>
It has been a long week and creativity is lacking, so please forgive me 
for the cross-post today.  The following post was published on September
 4, 2012 at The Way of Improvement Leads Home.  –JF<br>
We almost didn’t see Bruce Springsteen in Philadelphia on Sunday night.<br>
I have spent the last couple of weeks battling something akin to 
bronchitis and the members of my family were not feeling well either.  
On Saturday I thought about trying to put the tickets up for sale on 
Craig’s List in the hopes of finding someone in the area who was willing
 to give me face-value.<br>
But in the end we jumped in the van, loaded-up on the ibuprofen and 
cough-drops, and hit the Pennsylvania Turnpike.  Destination: Citizen’s 
Bank Park.<br>
We had trained too hard for this concert and we were not prepared to put
 that training to waste.  In the Fea family, “training” involves 
familiarizing ourselves with as many Springsteen songs as possible so 
that during the concert we will not be surprised by a song we do not 
know. (My wife and daughters indulge their crazy husband and father on 
this front). I thought we could have been better prepared for this show,
 but thanks to some last minute prepping on the road (Wrecking Ball and 
selections from The River, Darkness, and Born in the USA) I am happy to 
report that the E Street Band played only three or four songs that my 
family did not recognize.<br>
It was my daughters’ first Springsteen show.<br>
The weather was another factor.  It rained during the entire two-hour 
drive to Philadelphia.  It poured on the ride home.  But during 
Springsteen’s epic 3 hour and 43 minute concert not a single drop fell 
from the sky.<br>
This was my first outdoor Springsteen concert and it did not disappoint.
 The show opened with keyboardist Charlie Giordano playing “Take Me Out 
to the Ball Game” and things took off from there.  Springsteen started 
the show with a cover of “Summertime Blues” followed by three songs from
 The River–”Sherry Darling,” “Out in the Streets,” and “Hungry Heart.” 
(Our last minute prepping paid off!) He said that he was glad to be back
 among “my people” and declared the concert a “Labor Day of love.”<br>
He and the E Street Band performed 33 songs in all, including great 
renditions of “Lost in the Flood,” “Human Touch,” “Jersey Girl,” and 
“Working on the Highway.” The Boss seemed particularly focused on his 
guitar work on this night, especially on “Lost in the Flood.” On “Jersey
 Girl” he gave a shout out to the Jersey shore towns of Wildwood, Point 
Pleasant, Ocean City, and Asbury Park.<br>
Of course Springsteen did not disappoint those who wanted to hear the 
classics.  He played “Born to Run,” “Thunder Road,” “Rosalita,” “Dancing
 in the Dark,” “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,” and “Badlands.”  He also 
played several numbers from Wrecking Ball.  (Check out the set list).<br>
A few things I took away:<br>
I know that music and cultural critics have said this before, but I was 
more taken than ever by the fact that a Springsteen concert is something
 akin to a religious revival meeting.  For example, before playing 
“Spirit in the Night” he took several minutes to ask repeatedly if the 
“congregation” could “feel the spirit.”  He gave a short sermon at the 
beginning of the concert about “ghosts” (certainly with Clarence Clemons
 in mind) and how we should not be afraid of them because they remind of
 us of who we are and where we have been–what it means to be human.  
“The Rising” is a spiritual reflection on September 11, 2001. “City of 
Ruins,” with its exhortation to “rise up,” has the feel of a Sunday 
morning service at an African American church.  “Land of Hope and 
Dreams” is one of Springsteen’s several contributions to American civil 
religion.   Ever preaching, ever exhorting, the Boss wants us to feel 
his music in the depths of our souls.  He wants us to be somehow changed
 by the experience.<br>
As I watched him run from one side of the stage to the other, raising 
his hands to excite the crowd, I was imagining what it would have been 
like to see Billy Sunday or some other revival preacher who was able to 
inspire tens of thousands of people with one sermon.  (I wish I could 
say that I was watching the concert in this sort of detached scholarly 
way, but as my family will tell you, I was clearly part of the 
congregation, raising my arms and singing the words to every song.  I 
guess you could call me a participant-observer).  At different points in
 the concert the lights were turned on to reveal 45,000 fans chanting 
and fist-pumping in unison.  It was something to behold.<br>
Bruce Springsteen may just be super-human.  This guy will soon turn 63, 
yet he runs around the stage like an 18-year old.  The intensity is 
absolutely amazing.  Sunday was a very humid night and within about 
thirty minutes he was soaking wet with sweat (so was the band). By 
comparison, I left the concert exhausted.  I felt like I needed a full 
day to recover.  But the Boss did a concert the next (Monday) night.  I 
have never seen anything like this. Indeed, Springsteen performs until 
there is not a drop left in his proverbial tank.  This is really hard to
 explain without witnessing it.<br>
What a night!</div>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen makes us believe in rock ’n’ roll again: review<br>
Published on Saturday August 25, 2012<br>
<br>
 <br>
By Ben Rayner<br>
Pop Music Critic<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen inspires a weird, wild-eyed species of fanaticism 
amongst people you’d never expect to witness getting fanatical over a 
rock ‘n’ roll show, and that is a healthy thing.<br>
<br>
I’m referring to people of a certain, boomer-ish age, in particular, 
although by no means was the fired-up mob of 40,000-ish on hand for 
Springsteen and the E-Street Band’s Wrecking Ball tour touchdown the 
Rogers Centre on Friday night at all limited to lifelong fans orbiting 
around his own age of 62 years.<br>
<br>
He’s doggedly hung onto relevance long after many would-be heirs to his 
throne have faded from view and pretty much everyone’s got at least one 
Springsteen album they can get with, so his audience has refreshed 
itself with new blood accordingly over the course of the past 40-odd 
years. (My personal favourite Springsteen album is Nebraska, if you’re 
asking, but I had Born to Run and The River in my elementary-school 
bedroom as soon as I was old enough to tape my dad’s records.)<br>
<br>
It is a kick, however, to see folks your parents’ age excitably carting 
homemade Bristol board signs into a baseball stadium like they’ve 
suddenly reverted to age 13 and are on their way to see Justin Bieber 
for the first time.<br>
<br>
And that, in a nutshell, is probably why Springsteen has endured all 
these years: he can make you believe rock ‘n’ roll is the most important
 thing in the world all over again — even if, shame on you, you stopped 
believing years ago — because, whenever you see him perform, it seems 
pretty clear that rock ‘n’ roll is still the most important thing in the
 world to him.<br>
<br>
That’s not an original sentiment, by any means, but there’s a reason it 
gets repeated. Springsteen’s records might not carry as much epochal 
weight as they aspire to these days — it would be a nice change of pace 
at this point, in fact, if the Boss responded just once to one of the 
many crises rending his beloved American heartland apart with an album 
about, say, his love of gardening — but you don’t walk away from his 
shows with any doubt about his convictions. He still means it. Dude’s 
not faking.<br>
<br>
And his ongoing addiction to the spotlight, to the rush of thrilling a 
crowd and having that rush deafeningly returned, appears utterly 
sincere. If there was a touch of Vegas showmanship involved in playing 
on when the house lights came up for “Born to Run” at the three-hour 
mark of this nearly three-hour-and-45-minute marathon, the growing 
presence of teardown teams in orange hard hats impatiently waiting at 
each side of the stage as the encore dragged on lent an air of impatient
 veracity to the whole spectacle.<br>
<br>
There definitely was that Vegas-style showmanship when longtime guitar 
sideman Steve Van Zandt had to “revive” a prone Springsteen with the 
drippings from a wet sponge for “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,” “Glory Days” 
(“Ah, what the f---. We can’t go home!”), and an endless “Twist and 
Shout” to finally close out the night.<br>
<br>
Preceded by Charlie Giordano’s accordion-ized strains of “Take Me Out to
 the Ballgame,” Friday’s performance kicked off with a trio of what 
Springsteen called “summer songs” — the rollicking “Working on the 
Highway,” a “Hungry Heart” taken over almost entirely by a crowd 
singalong, and a slightly ragged “Sherry Darling.”<br>
<br>
All this, before diving into a run of tunes from this year’s Wrecking 
Ball. Slightly underwhelming on record, these outraged responses to 
America’s wretched present-day economic circumstances were puffed up 
nicely by Bruce and the current, 16-piece E-Street lineup.<br>
<br>
He could write an up-with-people anthem like “We Take Care of Our Own” 
in his sleep, true, and the song seemed a bit lazy when “The Rising” 
rose up decisively in the set list an hour or so later. Still, “Wrecking
 Ball” and the martial “Death to my Hometown” were as seething as their 
au courant subject matter demanded. Springsteen attacked “Jack of All 
Trades,” “We Are Alive” and “Land of Hope and Dreams” with similarly 
righteous diligence when they turned up in the set list later on. It 
came across loud and clear that Springsteen believes in the new material
 as much as anything else in the set, and that’s a refreshing change 
from a lot of shows by rockers who’ve been around as long as him.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, the show was deep into the catalogue and all over the place. 
The Rising’s “My City of Ruins” became a soulful, 15-minute sprawl that 
segued with churchy gusto into “Spirit in the Night,” off Springsteen’s 
first record, Greetings from Asbury Park, New Jersey.<br>
<br>
He paused amidst some band introductions during the latter to repeat the
 question “Are you missing anybody?” to crushing roars of unspoken 
remembrance for departed E-Street bandmates Danny Federici and Clarence 
Clemons. The latter’s’ nephew, Jake Clemons, did a most capable job of 
pulling off the Big Man’s saxophone solos throughout the night, even if 
essentially Photostat-ing his uncle’s presence in a legendary rock 
ensemble must be a weird and ultimately troubling way to make a living.<br>
<br>
With that sad business out of the way, Springsteen chugged a full beer 
and gamely took a crowd request for “Thundercrack” because someone had 
brought along a sign depicting a thunderbolt coming out of a bare butt 
that rather amused him. A full-bore “Murder Incorporated” and a host of 
well-received oldies — “Prove It All Night,” “Candy‘s Room,” “Prove It 
All Night,” “She’s the One” and “Darlington County” among them — 
followed, while a suspiciously talented young girl of ‘tween age was 
pulled from the stagefront pit to share lead vocals on “Waitin’ on a 
Sunny Day.”<br>
<br>
Perhaps the evening’s most resonant moment came next, as Springsteen sat
 down at the piano to honour another request for “Incident on 57th 
Street.” A quiet piece of three-dimensionally realized street-level 
storytelling from 1973’s The Wild, the Innocent and the E-Street 
Shuffle, it stood in stark contrast to the all-out, all-in sonic 
overload of most of the songs that came before and all that would come 
after. It also reminded you that what has been lost in Springsteen’s 
elevation to a stadium-baiting superstar expected to make Big Statements
 about Big Things was the young Boss’s ability to turn subtly-detailed 
hardscrabble vignettes drawn on a much smaller scale into Big Statements
 about Big Things.<br>
<br>
It gets a bit much over the long haul, that never-ending E-Street blare.
 There’s a fine line between transcendent and tiring. So it was good to 
have Springsteen pull back for a minute before “Badlands” and “Thunder 
Road” and “Born to Run” and “Rosalita” and “Dancing in the Dark” — cue 
for the most spectacularly and beautifully awkward, stadiumwide 
middle-aged WASP dance party I’ve ever seen — and all the rest of the 
big guns held in check until the home stretch figuratively blew the roof
 off the roofless Rogers Centre and sent several generations’ worth of 
E-Street acolytes spilling into the streets, utterly exhausted but 
believing again.<br>
<br>
Hang onto that feeling, hang onto rock ‘n’ roll. Bruce Springsteen has and he’s doing ok.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rogers Centre, Toronto - Aug. 24, 2012	<br>
By JASON MacNEIL,â€¨ Special To QMI Agency	<br>
		<br>
<br>
As it was famously said back in 1974, it could be said the future of 
rock and roll still rests in the hands of Bruce Springsteen.<br>
<br>
And after an awe-inspiring marathon Friday night at Toronto's 
roof-opened Rogers Centre as part of his Wrecking Ball world tour, how 
could you argue he's not?<br>
<br>
With a large video screen behind him and his large ensemble dubbed the 
“rebooted E Street Band,” Springsteen, 62, launched into a brassy 
Working On The Highway after sauntering out to Take Me Out To The 
Ballgame.<br>
<br>
From there he briefly became a conductor, letting the audience take over
 Hungry Heart as he picked up a home made sign. It was also the first 
time Jake Clemons, the nephew of the late Clarence Clemons, got to 
shine.<br>
<br>
Churning out one song after another, Springsteen nailed We Take Care Of 
Our Own, Wrecking Ball's first single, while playing off guitarists 
Steve Van Zandt and Nils Lofgren.<br>
<br>
“Toronto let me hear your voices call,” The Boss said during the 
uplifting Wrecking Ball and the Celtic-tinged Death To My Hometown as 
over 40,000 stood and cheered boisterously. He'd return to the album 
later with the somber Jack Of All Trades as Springsteen donned a large 
marching drum.<br>
	<br>
<br>
Part of Springsteen's long-standing appeal has been to completely revamp
 songs as was the case on lengthy, stirring My City Of Ruins which had a
 distinct Sam Cooke-like soul flavouring throughout before doing some 
introductions. But the biggest absence of course, aside from wife Patti 
Scialfa, was the late Clarence “The Big Man” Clemons. “Are we missing 
anybody tonight?” Springsteen repeatedly asked to collective cheers as 
everyone knew who he meant.<br>
<br>
Working his way across the lower stage during Spirit In The Night, 
Springsteen looked like a possessed preacher as he glad-handed many in 
the front before running to the far end of the stage before receiving a 
beer. “It's too early,” he said before chugging the beer entirely, 
walking back to centrestage and then kneeling down as Clemons performed.<br>
<br>
“That's tricky, very tricky,” Springsteen said, picking up a myriad of 
homemade signs with requests and obliging with Thundercrack, holding the
 sign with its drawing of a lighting bolt coming out of a derriere.<br>
<br>
By the proverbial sixth round of this fifteen round fight, Springsteen 
brought the rock factor back with Murder Incorporated and jamming out 
some fine riffs. But even that paled to the thunderous foot-stomper 
Candy's Room propelled by drummer Max Weinberg.<br>
<br>
The lone time Springsteen was upstaged was when a young girl came 
onstage to sing a portion of Waitin' On A Sunny Day. Springsteen let her
 run with it before getting her to say, “C'mon E Street Band!”<br>
<br>
“Canada has talent!” he quipped afterwards.<br>
<br>
Slowing things down alone on piano with Incident On 57th Street, the 
band shifted back into a higher gear for the homestretch of The Rising, 
Badlands and Land Of Hope And Dreams to end the 150-minute main set.<br>
<br>
The encore kicked off with a rambling We Are Alive before Thunder Road, 
Born To Run and going deep into the crowd with Tenth Avenue Freeze-out 
punctuated an incredible evening.<br>
<br>
After 215 minutes, The Big Man would be proud.<br>

<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band performs at 1st Mariner Arena. 
(Baltimore Sun photo by Gene Sweeney, Jr. / November 20, 2009)<br>
<br>
It's been more than 35 years since Bruce Springsteen and the E Street 
Band played in Baltimore, but Friday night's show at the 1st Mariner 
Arena was well worth the wait.<br>
<br>
Bruce and the boys plowed through nearly three and a half hours of rock 
'n' roll that rattled the old arena like few bands can. Seeing 
Springsteen and the E Street Band was like going to church on a Friday 
night. From the first notes of set opener "Wrecking Ball" to the 
fist-pumping finale of "Glory Days," Springsteen grabbed hold of the 
capacity crowd and never let go.<br>
<br>
The last time Springsteen was in town was 1973, when he opened for Chicago at what was then the Baltimore Civic Center.<br>
<br>
"I think it was $2 to get in," Springsteen said. "Some guy yelled at me,
 'Hey, We didn't come here to see you,' and I said, 'Yeah, well the next
 time we come here, it's going to cost you $5.'"<br>
<br>
Try $100 a ticket (for floor seats). Springsteen made sure the more than 14,000 fans got their money's worth, though.<br>
<br>
Neither Springsteen -- nor the arena -- have changed much since '73. He 
might be 60, but Springsteen still acts like a spry 20-something, 
strutting across the stage and dropping to his knees for dramatic 
effect.<br>
<br>
Near the beginning of Friday night's concert, Springsteen waded out into
 the audience, took a slug from a fan's beer and crowd surfed back to 
the stage. During a high-stepping rendition of "Tenth Avenue Freeze 
Out," Springsteen bent over backwards until he was horizontal, stared up
 at the rafters and straddled the microphone. Good luck finding another 
60-year-old rocker who can do that.<br>
<br>
One of the latest trends in live music is for bands to play entire albums, start to finish.<br>
<br>
On the last leg of this tour, which ends tomorrow in Buffalo, N.Y, 
Springsteen has dusted off classic E Street Band albums such as 
"Darkness on the Edge of Town" and "The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E 
Street Shuffle." Friday night, he led the band all the way through "Born
 to Run," the album that first made him a star.<br>
<br>
"This is the record that started a lifelong conversation between you and
 me," Springsteen said before easing into "Thunder Road." The 
spine-tingling song opened with nothing but Springsteen's gravelly voice
 and pianist Roy Bittan's lullaby-like playing, until the rest of the 
band joined in and turned the gentle tune into a triumphant arena 
anthem.<br>
<br>
When it was time to play the title track, the house lights came up and 
stayed up all the way through the song. It was jarring at first, but 
seeing thousands of other enthusiastic fans made the moment that much 
more enjoyable. The dark and chilling "Meeting Across the River," with 
its sparse instrumentation, gave way to the album's closer, 
"Jungleland," which was about as epic as it gets.<br>
<br>
"Born to Run" may have introduced Springsteen to a generation of rock 
fans, but at 1st Mariner Arena, the seminal album was only one part of a
 much larger, longer show. Few groups are as versatile as the E Street 
Band, and they proved it Friday night by playing everything from Jackie 
Wilson's rousing soul revue "(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and 
Higher" to the Irish jig "American Land." Drummer Max Weinberg's 
daughter Ali joined the band to play some accordion on the latter.<br>
<br>
Though health problems meant Clarence Clemons had to use a lift to get 
on stage, The Big Man wailed on saxophone like he always has. Both 
guitarists Nils Lofgren and Steven Van Zandt offered up some scorching 
solos, and Weinberg's steady playing helped hold the tunes together.<br>
<br>
After all that howling over all those years, Springsteen still has his 
voice. He hit a few high falsetto notes, and at times, belted so hard 
and loud his head trembled. Perhaps the night's most poignant moment 
came when Springsteen booted the rest of the band off stage and sat down
 at the piano for a solo version of "For You," a song off his debut 
album, "Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J."<br>
<br>
Since Springsteen likes to keep his live shows spontaneous, a handful of
 the 30 songs played were audience requests. Crowd members brought signs
 with their suggestions, and Springsteen sifted through them and picked 
ones he liked. The always playful "Santa Claus is Coming to Town" 
(complete with Santa hats), the playfully frantic "E Street Shuffle" and
 the irresistible, retro-sounding rocker "Ramrod" were all requests.<br>
<br>
Springsteen kept bidding farewell to the audience and then launching 
into another song, as though he couldn't bear to end the night. If rumor
 has it, this could be his last tour with the full E Street Band in 
quite some time. Well, we Baltimoreans have waited 35 years since the 
last Springsteen show here, and if need be, we'll wait another 35. Let's
 just hope The Boss comes back before then, because Friday night's show 
was the concert of a lifetime.<br>

<br>
Bruce Springsteen swaggered from the main stage to a lower platform in 
front of the crowd, then grabbed handfuls of homemade signs asking him 
to play some of the best known or most obscure songs from a 30-year 
repertoire.<br>
"Oh my god, we've created a monster!" he exclaimed, referring to a new 
wrinkle that lets his fans request songs in the middle of his marathon 
concerts.<br>
The soul-patched 58-year-old rock star soaked it in with a large grin, 
holding up an empty beer box on which someone had written "Boom Boom" 
before launching into the bluesy house-party shaker. It was the first of
 four songs Springsteen and the E Street Band played that were picked by
 members of the crowd.<br>
Springsteen and his eight-member band unleashed a three-hour, 28-song 
assault Tuesday on the sold-out Hersheypark Stadium, covering tunes 
ranging from his early days to his more recent work. It was his first 
appearance at the venue and his first concert in the region in more than
 20 years.<br>
The show was part of the yearlong "Magic" tour.<br>
The crowd, easily topping 30,000, spread from the foot of the stage back
 through the football field and concrete stands. His fans gave as good 
as they got, pumping their fists and lifting their voices higher with 
each song.<br>
"A Bruce show is more than a concert," said 40-year-old Pete Ferraro of 
Baltimore. "It's a sort of spiritual event. There's a camaraderie 
between Bruce and the fans."<br>
Springsteen gets as close to his fans during a concert as any rock star 
can. At one point, he jumped into the crowd. During "Darlington County,"
 he lay singing on his back, feet dangling into the crowd as a stunned 
woman, who couldn't have been born much before the "Born in the USA" 
album was released in 1984, held on to his side, signifying that even at
 58, Springsteen can still be a sex symbol. At various times, 
Springsteen held the microphone down into the crowd, letting some 
younger fans, barely in elementary school, sing the chorus on songs like
 "Out in the Street."<br>
Not every part of the show was as well received. As he is known to do, 
Springsteen launched into a dissertation, offering his political views 
about wiretapping to a semi-receptive crowd.<br>
"You may not think it has an immediate impact on you," Springsteen said 
as some in the stands began to sit down. "But it's an attack on our 
Constitution, which means it's an attack on our soul as Americans."<br>
He then played "Living in the Future" from the "Magic" album. His 
comments drew tepid approval from some supporters, while a few jeered 
him from their seats. The moment, though, was short-lived, as he brought
 the energy back to a higher pitch with a performance of "Mary's Place" 
from the "The Rising" album.<br>
Springsteen and the E Streeters took the stage underneath a 
peach-and-lavender sunset 30 minutes after the show was supposed to 
start. The opening three songs — "Summertime Blues," "Radio Nowhere" and
 "Out in the Street" — hit like a wrecking ball, bowling the crowd over 
with blistering drums, foot-tapping rhythms and anthemic rock.<br>
While the first 21 songs never let go of the breakneck pace and ended 
with a climactic "Badlands" — with the people even at the far back of 
the stadium raising their arms and singing along — the seven-song encore
 brought just as much punch as the previous two hours, with classics 
like "Thunder Road," "Tenth Avenue Freezeout," "Born to Run" and 
"Gloria," the show's final song. The Boss was joined onstage by fellow 
rock legend Tommy James for "Gloria."</div>

Comment<br>
During the Eighties, Bruce Springsteen conquered the world on the back 
of his best-selling album Born in the USA. But as the decade ended, 
Springsteen found himself at a a personal and professional crossroads. 
Here he talks about breaking up his musical family – the E Street Band –
 while embarking on life as a father…<br>
On October 18, 1989, Bruce sat down with his address book and a task 
he’d both feared and fantasised about for most of the decade: breaking 
up the E Street Band. “I think we got into a rut,” he says. 
“Relationships got a little muddy, through co-dependence, or whatever. 
Probably that aggravated everyone a little bit. I needed to take a 
break, do some other things, probably play with some other musicians, 
which I hadn’t done in a long time.<br>
“So I called the guys up and talked to them as best I could. I never 
looked at it as the band being done or kaput or finished. But it was a 
call that said, 'I’m gonna do something else, and you’re not gonna be a 
part of it for a while.’ And that was very difficult for the guys and 
me.”<br>
The suspicions that drummer Max Weinberg and the others felt at that 
last show on the two-year, world-conquering Born in the USA tour turned 
out to be exactly right.<br>
“I just didn’t know where to take the band next,” Bruce reflects. “It 
seemed like we’d reached an apex of what we were trying to do and say.” 
Some found it easier to accept than others. Garry Tallent, for one, 
noticed that absence of finality in what Bruce had to say. “He never 
said he was breaking up the band,” the bassist says. “It seemed like a 
very nice, gracious call.”<br>
Guitarist Nils Lofgren, who had started his sideman career working with 
the always unpredictable Neil Young, didn’t blink. “You gotta understand
 that this guy had spent his whole life playing with the same seven 
people,” he says. “No matter how good they are, you want to play with 
other people, try some different things.”<br>
Weinberg had seen it coming. “You would have had to be completely blind 
not to notice there were major changes coming here,” he says. But the 
news was still “unrelentingly depressing”.<br>
Clarence Clemons got the call in Japan, where he, along with Lofgren, 
was touring with Ringo Starr’s first All Starr Band. As Clemons 
remembered, Bruce sounded so casual, he assumed he was being called back
 to E Street. “I picked up the phone and heard him say, 'Hey, Big Man!’ I
 said, 'Hey, Boss!’ And he said, 'Well, it’s all over.’ I said, 'Oh, uh,
 OK,’ because I thought he meant the Ringo tour was over, and I had to 
come back home to go into the studio or start another tour.” The sax 
player said he’d get home and check in as soon as possible, but then 
Bruce set him straight. “He said, 'Naw, naw, naw. I’m breaking up the 
band.’ ”<br>
Bruce recalls talking to Clemons for a while. “I had the kid gloves on 
delivering what I knew would be very bad news.” But Clemons was juggling
 his surprise and grief with a sudden urge to reduce his hotel room to 
ruins. So many years on the road, so much sacrifice, the thousands of 
hours spent waiting for Bruce to hear just the right sound from the 
recording studio speakers. “And I’m thinking, 'It’s all for this? My 
whole life dedicated to this band, this situation, this man, and what he
 believes in, then I’m out of town and I get a f---ing phone call?’ ”<br>
Fortunately, he was in the company of Ringo Starr, who had experienced 
his own traumatic break-up when the Beatles imploded in 1970. And it 
wasn’t long before Clemons simply accepted the change for what it was. 
“Something in the back of my psyche said, 'This is OK. He’ll come back. 
Because anything so great cannot be destroyed altogether. Anything the 
goddess created can’t be thrown away. It’ll come back.’ ”<br>
Then, just before Thanksgiving 1989, Bruce and Patti learnt that she was
 carrying their first child. A son, Evan James, was born in the evening 
of July 24. As he watched from the side, a surge of feeling burst 
against a part of himself Bruce had kept locked down since he was old 
enough to know how to protect himself.<br>
“I got close to a feeling of a real, pure, unconditional love with all 
the walls down,” he told music writer David Hepworth. “All of a sudden, 
what was happening was so immense that it just stomped all the fear away
 for a little while, and I remember feeling overwhelmed. But I also 
understood why you’re so frightened. When that world of love comes 
rushing in, a world of fear comes in with it.”<br>
It was a moment Bruce had imagined, described, and sung about for years.
 “My music over the last five years has dealt with those almost 
primitive issues. It’s about somebody walking through that world of fear
 so that he can live in the world of love.”<br>
Bruce and Patti made their bond official at a backyard wedding the next 
spring, and their daughter, Jessica Rae, was born on December 30, 1991. 
“I had to change old attitudes and leave a lot of fears behind,” Bruce 
told USA Today’s Edna Gundersen in 1995. But he called having a family 
“the birth of my second life”.<br>
Not that he could shake off every shadow. Living in LA, Bruce and Patti 
were about an hour-long commuter plane ride from the house he’d bought 
his parents in Belmont, a pleasant suburb about 10 minutes down Highway 
101 from San Mateo.<br>
The anger between father and son had largely faded, thanks both to the 
passage of time and other less expected developments. A stroke Doug 
suffered in 1979 had somehow rewired the part of his personality that 
made it all but impossible for him to share his emotions. “Now he 
couldn’t hide anything,” Pam Springsteen says. “You could mention any of
 his kids’ names to him, and he’d burst into tears. You could see what 
meant the most to him. He was just a very real person. No pretence, no 
persona. And everyone loved him.”<br>
When Bruce held his own son in his lap a few years later, Patti noticed 
that her husband hadn’t read a word of the picture book he held. Instead
 he’d hold up the book so he and Evan could both see it, and then, after
 a minute or two of silence, turn the page so they could look at the 
next picture. Patti, puzzled, said. “You’re not reading it to him!” 
Bruce shrugged. “This,” he explained, “is how Springsteen men read.”</div>

<br>
Throughout the Born in the U.S.A. tour, Bruce’s song introductions and 
midshow stories focused on a subject he had rarely mentioned in a 
specific way: sex and romance. Mostly sex, though. Almost entirely sex, 
now that you mention it. Introducing “Glory Days,” he reminisced about 
teenage encounters in the bedroom of his parents’ house, conducted under
 the aural cover of balls banging around his pool table. (The occasional
 sweep of an arm did the trick.) Various tales setting up “Pink 
Cadillac” made its horndog lyrics all the more vivid, while the 
introduction to “I’m Goin’ Down” traced the arc of a relationship in 
terms of a couple’s sexual patterns. “(First) you’re making love to ’em 
all the time, three or four times a day. Then you come back a little bit
 later, and uh-oh … it’s like ‘Are you gonna make love to me tonight, or
 are we gonna wait for the full moon again,’ y’know?” The giggly sex 
talk got started a few weeks after the tour’s start in late June 1984 
but took an abrupt leap in late October after a seven-night stand at the
 Los Angeles Sports Arena. It was not a coincidence.<br>
“I knew people who knew a lot of actors, so I got to know Julianne,” 
says Bruce’s tour agent, Barry Bell. “I brought her to a show, 
introduced her to Bruce. I figured she’d be right for him because she 
was very down to earth. And the rest is history.” A shadowy sort of 
history, considering what the near future held in store. But given 
Bruce’s steep arc into the apex of global fame, his blossoming romance 
with an up-and-coming model-turned-actress from the Pacific Northwest 
inevitably became the subject of intense interest for the world’s 
media/celebrity industrial complex.<br>
<br>
Born in Chicago in 1960 and raised in the waterfront suburb of Lake 
Oswego, Oregon, about ten minutes up the Willamette River from Portland,
 Julianne grew up with the tree-shaded comfort the Springsteens never 
enjoyed when Bruce was young. The sixth and final child born to Bill, a 
prosperous insurance executive, and his homemaker wife, Ann, Julianne 
went through school with the casual grace of a young woman thoroughly 
comfortable in her own skin. Fair skinned and blue eyed, with a lissome 
figure and classic schoolgirl features, Julianne floated through Lake 
Oswego High School, waving the pom-poms with the cheerleaders on 
Saturday night and cutting a fine figure in her dad’s MG roadster on her
 way down Macadam Boulevard to downtown Portland. A quick run through 
the two-year Brooks College in Long Beach, California, prefaced an 
early-eighties move to New York, where she joined the Elite modeling 
agency, soon earning top rates as a vision of fresh-scrubbed sensuality.
 Back in L.A. in 1983, Julianne rose quickly through the actress ranks, 
starting with a featured role in a video by Southern rockers .38 
Special, which led to roles in TV movies.<br>
<br>
All of which proved entirely beguiling to Bruce, who could also sense 
Julianne’s warmth and lack of Hollywood pretense. That she also knew her
 way around his favorite rock ’n’ roll classics was another bonus. After
 chatting for a while backstage, Bruce asked to see Julianne again, and 
when that date went well, they grew closer, then inseparable. “I knew 
they liked each other, but I didn’t know how fast he was moving,” Bell 
says.<br>
<br>
Very fast, as it turned out. Bruce took his new girlfriend home to meet 
his family and friends in New Jersey during his winter break, followed 
her back to Los Angeles and then went with her to meet the Phillipses 
when they visited Palm Springs, California, in February 1985. Bruce went
 to Australia alone in March, but Julianne met him in Japan when the 
tour got there three weeks later. It was true love and lollipops in the 
land of the rising sun, and the short holiday they spent in Hawaii on 
the way back to the United States seemed to seal the deal. “She was just
 tough,” he told Dave Marsh at the time. “She had confidence and 
resilience, and she wasn’t afraid to face facts or their implications.”<br>
A day or two after they got home from Hawaii, Julianne called her mother
 in Lake Oswego and told her they’d better plan a wedding, and soon. And
 secretly, too. Because if the word leaked to the Bruce-frenzied press, 
the deluge would be immediate, intense, and unyielding. The ceremony 
itself was miraculously untouched by the media’s fanatic attention, 
although that feat required a level of cloak-and-daggery (decoy cars, 
fake schedules, back alley escapes, and more) unseen outside of a James 
Bond movie.<br>
<br>
When it was all over, Bruce had a ring on his finger, a wife by his 
side, and a commitment to the domestic life he had avoided so 
assiduously throughout his adult life. It had taken him a long time to 
get there, but now he was determined to make it work.<br>
Temporarily relieved of the shifting burdens of art, fame, and commerce,
 Bruce turned his attention to the quieter challenges of domestic life. 
On one level, he and Julianne were a lot like any other pair of 
successful young professionals, juggling their relationship with the 
careers, and the inner lives that had propelled them to the point where 
they had made themselves family.<br>
Juli was seemingly on board for whatever her husband wanted to do. A 
night at the Stone Pony? She was right there at the bar, checking out 
the band with Bruce and then edging away subtly when a crowd of fans 
enveloped him. When engineer Toby Scott came out to Rumson to help build
 a recording studio in the guest apartment, they seemed cheerfully 
settled as any pair of newlyweds.<br>
<br>
“They were very domestic. She liked to stay in, make popcorn, watch TV 
and have some dinner. People kept asking if they had a problem, and I 
always said no. I thought Bruce and Juli were doing great.”<br>
But when they went out for a pleasant dinner with Roy Bittan and his 
wife, the pianist went home with an uneasy feeling. “It just wasn’t like
 going out with the Julianne and Bruce that I knew,” he says. “Juli was a
 lovely girl, but he just seemed like he was trying to be a different 
person. I think he was trying to develop a way of being on a social 
level. And Julianne wasn’t anywhere on his train of thought.”<br>
<br>
Both halves of the couple kept news of their breakup as quiet as 
possible. No press releases, no leaks to friendly reporters, no public 
heart-to-hearts with “People” or Barbara Walters. Some sharp-eyed 
observers might have figured out that Bruce had taken off his wedding 
ring. Backstage crew and visitors noticed that Julianne, a fixture at 
earlier shows on The Tunnel of Love Express Tour in 1988, was nowhere to
 be seen, even on the couple’s third anniversary on May 13. What could 
be seen, however, was that the duets he performed with the increasingly 
prominent Patti Scialfa had grown so steamy it seemed like their 
portrayal of romantic heat was, perhaps, something a bit too realistic 
to be limited to the stage. But what might have seemed shocking to 
outsiders — is Bruce really fooling around with his backup singer? — was
 no surprise to anyone who had seen the Born in the U.S.A. tour from the
 inside. “What was obvious on the Tunnel tour was also obvious at an 
early point in the Born in the U.S.A. tour, let’s just say that,” says 
Dave Marsh.<br>
<br>
Even if the electricity between Bruce and Patti seemed obvious in 1984, 
the in-house gossip didn’t travel beyond the touring party. But even 
when Julianne became a part of the scene in the fall of 1984, the crowd 
on the tour always figured her for an outlier candidate for Bruce’s real
 affections. So when the word broke that Bruce would be traveling with a
 serious girlfriend during the Far East swing in the spring of 1985, 
some tour members assumed they could book one less hotel room for the 
band. “I know I was surprised when he came to Japan with someone other 
than Patti,” says Marsh.<br>
Still, when Bruce thought about settling into a serious romance, 
something pushed him in a different direction. Certainly Julianne’s 
beauty, warmth, and intelligence had magnetic properties all their own. 
And the prospect of taking up with his newest band member, weaving a 
romance into the always-complex chemistry of the E Street Band while 
also stirring up a tabloid frenzy couldn’t have seemed appealing. So 
then came Julianne, the wedding, and three years of marriage that hardly
 anyone had guessed might be less than the openly affectionate romance 
most observers believed they were witnessing. When Julianne accompanied 
Bruce to the early shows on the Tunnel tour in late February and early 
March, they had impressed some observers with how relaxed and happy they
 both looked together. But something else was going on too.<br>
<br>
Both members of the couple were, and remain, tight lipped about the 
inner workings, and failure, of their marriage. When pressed now, Bruce 
has one question: “Did Juli speak to you at all?” Told that she 
basically hadn’t (save for one very brief quote), he speaks only about 
his ex-wife’s strengths and his own weaknesses. “The emotions of mine 
that were uncovered by trying to have adult life with a partner and make
 that work uncovered a lot of things I’d avoided and tried not to deal 
with previously,” he says, and more or less leaves it at that.<br>
Julianne returns the favor. “I have always been incredibly private when 
it comes to my private life,” she says. “The one and only thing I will 
say is that the period was a time of incredible growth and introspection
 for me. And I will forever give that credit to Bruce.” Which is 
remarkably gracious given how swiftly, and thoughtlessly, Bruce moved 
into the next stage of his life.<br>
<br>
Once Bruce showed up backstage without his wedding ring, he and Patti 
stopped hiding their affections from the rest of the touring company. 
They cuddled backstage and shared seats on the jet from one show to the 
next. Given no official declaration about his separation from Julianne, 
it came as a shock to Garry Tallent and his girlfriend when they 
stumbled across the couple smooching on the airplane. “My girlfriend’s 
going, ‘What’s going on here?’ and I had no idea what to say.” But the 
news stayed hush-hush, more or less, through the end of the American 
tour on May 23 and through the first few dates on the European tour, 
until the company got to Rome in mid-June.<br>
<br>
The sun was bright, the skies deep blue, and the hotel room’s balcony 
all but irresistible when Bruce and Patti woke up on the morning of June
 15 and stepped outside to take in the view. With the sun on their 
shoulders and new love in the air, they held each other as they gazed 
across the rooftops — not suspecting an observant photographer, a 
professional in the land that invented the term paparazzi, was peering 
at them through his viewfinder. Click-click-click. Then they were lying 
together, drinks in hand, on a single patio recliner. Clickity-click. 
Those photos made headlines all across Europe and then in the United 
States, and on June 17 Jon Landau Management released a statement 
acknowledging that Bruce and Julianne had separated. A day after that, 
Bruce and Patti sealed the deal by strolling arm in arm through Paris, 
in full view of a procession of French reporters and photographers.<br>
“I didn’t protect Juli,” Bruce says. “Some sort of public announcement 
would have been fair, but I felt overly concerned about my own privacy. I
 handled it badly, and I still feel badly about it. It was cruel for 
people to find out the way they did.”</div>

Stadium of Light, Sunderland<br>
<br>
‘A poseable rock action figure’: Bruce Springsteen on stage in Sunderland. Photograph: Most Wanted/Rex Features<br>
Fog and drizzle blanket Sunderland FC's ground as Bruce Springsteen and 
his band begin their UK tour, almost by stealth. It's just after 7pm on 
the longest day of the year. It could be mid-winter. With no preamble 
and, for a time, no discernible lights, the 16-strong outfit strike up 
Badlands (from Springsteen's 1978 album, Darkness on the Edge of Town) 
in front of a muted crowd.<br>
<br>
Three hours later, the edge of town is considerably brighter. 
Springsteen has not only stood on top of a piano, but butted its keys 
with his ear on Seven Nights to Rock, a breakneck rockabilly tune.<br>
<br>
Bandanna-wearing guitarist Little Steven has drenched Springsteen with a
 spongeful of water when his Boss falls to the ground in mock 
exhaustion. During Dancing in the Dark, a couple of fans have pulled 
their best shapes alongside soloing guitarist Nils Lofgren, celebrating 
his birthday. Sax player Jake Clemons has almost replaced his late uncle
 Clarence in the crowd's affections, with cheers greeting his every 
brass breath.<br>
<br>
In all the fervent discussions about the bard of New Jersey, his 
politically charged latest album, Wrecking Ball, and a body of work on 
love and hardship of four decades' standing, commentators often overlook
 the fact that, live, Springsteen is a big cheesy ham. Ringing out the 
chords on his guitar with legs astride, Springsteen looks almost camp, a
 poseable rock action figure. There's a showbiz streak as wide as the 
Wear to his facial contortions, as he milks the roar of the warmed-up 
crowd. The sight of a songwriter so revered wiggling his bottom 
alongside Little Steven is a great counterpoint to the earnestness of 
much of tonight's set.<br>
<br>
Not that there is too much wrong with the earnestness, either. Wrecking 
Ball supplies seven songs tonight, each one more combative than the 
last. Death to My Hometown is a full-blooded Irish stomp about the 
powerlessness of the average Joe. It captures Springsteen's most 
consistent gift – couching difficult subject matter in potent hoedowns. 
Decline, exploitation, war and death all receive an airing tonight, 
ennobled into fist-punching entertainment. Another Wrecking Ball cut, 
Shackled and Drawn, is a whooping country song about physical labour – 
which is, the song posits, still better than no labour at all. In 
sympathy, Springsteen travels the breadth of the stage doing a 
chain‑gang walk.<br>
<br>
You might have expected a slightly more insurrectionary mood from a 
Wearside crowd, suffering significantly more from the ravages of the 
recession than the plush hub of the south east. But with ticket prices 
around the £60 mark, those here are probably still largely employed.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, a little thrill ripples through the crowd for one line on 
Jack of All Trades, a song about making do and mending in hard times. 
"If I had me a gun/ I'd find the bastards and shoot them on sight," 
Springsteen sings of the bankers who made off with all the money.<br>
<br>
Modern-day mass events – gigs, sporting fixtures and political rallies –
 can't help but echo many of the ancestral dynamics of faith gatherings.
 And while most rock'n'roll makes liberal use of religious metaphors, 
there is a blatant revivalist tinge to tonight's show, which borrows 
heavily from soul and gospel. Land of Hope and Dreams turns into People 
Get Ready. Lyrically, we are never far from Biblical language – a 
valley, or a mountain; Springsteen takes us down to The River, to some 
of the biggest cheers of the night, then takes us up to The Rising, in a
 quiet, but moving passage at the midpoint of the set. Famed for his 
grandiose bluster, Springsteen's real knack is keeping a stadium rapt to
 songs where the suffering isn't offset by anthemics. Fans hungry for 
rarities get Point Blank, a bleak romantic cut from the early 80s in 
which love and hope don't stave off the ravages of poverty.<br>
<br>
The rabble-rousing of a politician or the sermonising of a preacher is 
within his grasp. And yet Springsteen's interjections tonight are 
down-to-earth. "Patti (Scialfa, his partner and backing singer) is at 
home making sure our kids aren't getting into drugs," he quips. A recent
 show in Madrid neared the four-hour mark. But as the E Street Band end 
their set with a run of old hits – a sublime Born to Run, a jubilant 
Glory Days – it's hard to feel short-changed.</div>

				<div class="content">Live Review: Bruce Springsteen at Chicago’s Wrigley Field (9/7)<br>
BY MICHAEL ROFFMAN ON SEPTEMBER 8TH, 2012 IN CONCERT REVIEWS, <br>
<br>
On Friday night, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band kicked off the 
first of two sold-out nights at Chicago’s Wrigley Field with a 
three-and-a-half hour setlist spanning 28 tracks. Diehard fanatics know 
that number and time is almost commonplace — especially his more recent 
Finnish audiences  – yet The Boss kept things titillating by offering up
 tour debuts, inviting a “cavalcade of stars,” and attempting to be the 
most humanistic rock ‘n’ roll frontman alive.<br>
<br>
That last part might be hard to stomach for a few, but it holds some 
weight. Save for maybe Dave Grohl, there isn’t a rock ‘n’ roll artist 
out there like Springsteen that loves his (or her) own music as much as 
his (or her) own fans. The New Jersey legend is just a different breed 
altogether; a greying scholar in performance, style, and substance. 
Right off the bat, Springsteen played to the ravenous crowd, who were 17
 sheets to the wind by the time the band lurched through a 
studio-stripped rendition of”Hungry Heart”.<br>
<br>
Disclaimer: Remember, this is the land of a million drunks, AKA 
Wrigleyville, where a healthy chunk of Chicago go to root for (and then 
curse) what is arguably one of the most depressing baseball franchises 
in the history of the game.<br>
<br>
<br>
Some habits do tire and Springsteen’s incessant need to channel this 
psuedo Baptist preacher of his atrophies quick. His breathy introduction
 to “Spirit in the Night” (“Can you feel the spiiiiiiiirit?”) felt 
slightly pandering, while the extended roll call in “My City of Ruins” 
bordered on parody. Still, at nearly 63 years of age, he’s the best at 
what he does, and his act hardly ever feels rehearsed. Even when he’s 
doing traditionally kitschy things like roping people up on stage or 
stalking the crowds, there’s a sense of authenticity he inspires.<br>
<br>
During the bonafide tearjerker “Waitin’ on a Sunny Day”, a young girl 
holding a cardboard sign with the song’s title was brought on stage by 
Springsteen. When he handed her the mic to sing the chorus, her eyes 
popped back to her parents, and her smile was enough to power a small 
city. Much later, during a gleefully urgent cut of “Dancing in the 
Dark”, Springsteen laughed at one husband’s sign that read: “Please Take
 Dance With My Wife.” He couldn’t turn down the offer and so he pulled 
said wife up on stage and the two shared what was probably Springsteen’s
 millionth dance to date. Yet never once did this all feel premeditated.<br>
<br>
It also helped that the E Street Band sounds like the E Street Band 
again. Earlier in the year, the group experienced dire growing pains, 
which made sense given that a key member like Jake Clemons, filling in 
for his late uncle Clarence, was still warming up. At this point on 
tour, there’s hardly a song without his contributions, which really do 
mirror Clarence’s past trademarks. Let’s just say that anyone who can 
nail “Jungleland”, without a doubt the legend’s finest moment with the 
band, can do just about anything. When the request for the Born to Run 
closer filed through the crowd, and Springsteen went for it, Jake 
assumed the task and scored with ceiling-shattering marks.<br>
<br>
<br>
But what isn’t a true Springsteen show without its share of surprises. 
Kicking off with the original 1978 version of “Prove It All Night”, 
featuring the extended heartfelt introduction, hinted of greater things 
to come. Like, say, appearances by Tom Morello and Evanston native and 
major Cubs fan Eddie Vedder. While the former has been more or less an 
unofficial member of the E Street Band all throughout 2012, the latter 
was a genuine shock. When the Pearl Jam frontman sauntered out for the 
band’s electrified version of “Atlantic City”, the ballpark wouldn’t 
shut up — this writer included.<br>
<br>
“I think I’m starting to steal from Justin Bieber’s audience,” 
Springsteen observed, following the band’s unorthodox encore, which was 
essentially them standing at the lip of the stage for less than a 
minute, only to retreat back to their respective instruments. A 
quasi-forgettable performance of “We Are Alive” wasn’t what the 
admittedly youthful crowd had hoped for; however, what came next is 
probably giving a heart attack right now to any Springsteen fan who 
couldn’t attend.<br>
<br>
That famous harmonica signalled Springsteen’s literary epic “Thunder 
Road”, which led into the always-dependable “Born to Run”, which then 
segued into an extended, deeply emotional cut of “Dancing in the Dark”, 
which bled into an overwhelming surprise appearance of “Jungleland”, 
which — deep breath — evolved into “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out”. Because 
that wasn’t enough, Springsteen called forth his ’90s all-stars, adding 
with finality, “C’mon, we’ll send you all home dancing.” The next ten or
 12 final minutes found the E Street Jamboree innately paying homage to 
the city’s crown cinematic jewel, John Hughes’ Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,
 by covering “Twist and Shout”. Many sang, everyone danced.<br>
<br>
<br>
These are just simple truths: Those who paid scalpers $10,000+ for 
premium seats got a premium deal. Those who didn’t know “Shackled and 
Drawn” from the tour debut of B-side “None But the Brave” walked away 
satisfied. Those who came just because their friends scored tickets from
 their parents and, okay, they think they heard “Dancing in the Dark” at
 their orthodontist’s office once or twice before, walked away diehard 
Springsteen fanatics. Nobody left disappointed, not even the mummified 
fan who felt compelled to start chewing dip amongst the thousands also 
trying to leave the stadium. Yeah, he’ll wake up looking for his copy of
 Greetings from Asbury Park, and no, he won’t find it, but it’s that 
urge that counts.<br>
<br>
The punch line? This was only Springsteen’s first night in Chicago.<br>

Bruce Springsteen Working On A Dream</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
  8 / 10 There’s never been a better time to be Bruce Springsteen. As 
well as being one of the understandably smug Barack Obama-backing celebs
 – which has to feel pretty damn fine right at this moment – there are 
the bubbling rumours of a Glastonbury headline slot, which have got 
every chap and his dog into a rabid tizzy, and with good reason; 
Springsteen’s last few ’round-the-world jaunts have shown that his 
vigorous heart-on-sleeve rock’n’soul antics are still belly-shudderingly
 exciting, not to mention downright captivating. Yet while 2007’s 
‘Magic’ saw The Boss whet his political whistle, ‘Working On A Dream’, 
his 16th (16th!) studio album, sees him eschew such stylings and instead
 go for broke on telling tales and flashing his soul; the soul of a 
global phenomenon who, this year, turns 60.<br>
<br>
Getting straight down to business with the hefty, eight-minute long 
opener that is ‘Outlaw Pete’, Bruce flexes his bulging storytelling 
muscle through a filmic, old western epic; a cross-country and 
cross-career trip with a crim that, oddly, borrows as heavily from Kiss 
as it does Bruce’s very own back catalogue. The riff from ‘I Was Made 
For Lovin’ You’ keeps on rearing its disco head, but alongside ominous 
clanging bells, E Street brass and a characteristically darkly soaring 
scope, it’s a marathon anthem for the anti-hero.<br>
<br>
‘My Lucky Day’ is proof he still hasn’t forgotten what it’s like to make
 eyes at his sweetheart across the diner and then funnel it into a hit 
complete with tripping keys and sax solos, while the title track 
provides a laid-back home for Bruce’s unmistakable, blue collar 
billionaire growl. The personable perkiness is kept up on the 
stripped-back countrified folk of ‘Tomorrow Never Knows’, a hazy sunny 
meadow of a track which far overshadows the rather skip-able, uninspired
 birthday bounce of ‘Surprise, Surprise’. The album’s oddest moment 
though, comes in the shape of ‘Queen Of The Supermarket’, a rather 
bizarre love letter to Tesco, which sees Bruce’s favourite, unfulfilled 
New Jersey girl next door transported to the fruit and veg aisle.<br>
<br>
Things take a turn for the maudlin on the foreboding ‘Life Itself’ and 
‘The Last Carnival’, the latter written about the E Street Band’s Danny 
Federici, who died last year. It’s a sentimental hymn to bromance lost, 
which, alongside the heartbreaking acoustic balladeering of bonus track 
‘The Wrestler’, from the Mickey Rourke movie of the same name, will have
 you weeping away the end of the album… Yet even with such sadness, yep –
 it’s definitely gonna be a great year to be The Boss.</div>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band<br>
Making Magic in South Florida- May 2, 2008<br>
<br>
From Jim Smith<br>
<br>
The show was originally scheduled for April 18, but the passing of 40 
year friend and bandmate Danny Federici the day before necessitated a 
rescheduling. The Band had to lay their buddy to rest, but it was far 
from "goodbye."<br>
<br>
The new date was set for May 2, a mere two weeks later, with a 7:30 
showtime posted. 7:30 came and went. So did 8:00, then 8:15 and 8:30. I 
was starting to get antsy. The anticipation was building in the house 
and swag (merchandise "sold while at gig") was being consumed until the 
lines vaporized.<br>
<br>
Then at 8:40, at The Bank Atlantic Center in suburban Ft. Lauderdale 
(think hockey/basketball venue) a pre-recorded video celebrating the 
life, times and career of Danny "The Phantom" Federici was shown, with 
pre-recorded music underneath. It was a moving and poignant tribute to 
one of rock-n-roll's most free spirited spirits.<br>
<br>
Then The Man and his Band launched into a rollicking rendition of 
"Promised Land." The typically unusually high E Street energy level was 
definitely kicked up a few notches. It was immediately apparent tha even
 by Bruce live gig standards, this was gonna be a very, very, very 
special night.<br>
<br>
By the time they segued into the set's second song, "Wanna Be With You,"
 one thing was abundantly clear: Bruce &amp; Co. were on a mission. They
 were not to be denied.<br>
<br>
The "Magic" was beginning to unfold right before our eyes and ears.<br>
<br>
Bruce is one of those all too rare artists who wears it ALL on his 
sleeve: his life, his convictions, his causes, his politics, his loves, 
fears and hopes. (He also sings a lot about a recurring character named 
Mary. She must have been an impact player somewhere along the line.)<br>
<br>
Counting Danny's tribute, 25 songs comprised this nearly three hour Rock
 Manifesto of a concert experience. And, true to form, Bruce wasn't 
playing coy with his emotions. I mean, really. How many times do the 
words "Habeas corpus, wire-tapping, food banks, hope for the America I 
grew up believing in" rear their heads in the PC climate of our times?<br>
<br>
How often do you watch a 58 year old man slide almost 20 yards across 
the stage, ax in hand? How many performers play with such sheer joy?<br>
<br>
I consider Bruce to be the standard bearing troubadour of our generation.<br>
<br>
In the tradition of Samuel Clements, Kurt Vonnegut, James Michener, Gary
 Trudeau and other literary greats of our times, Bruce's lyrics tell 
America's story, unadulterated, unfiltered and with the added benefit of
 one very accomplished, kick-ass rock 'n' roll band complementing the 
lyrics.<br>
<br>
Clarence "The Big Man" Clemons played the sax bigger than ever. Nils 
Lofgren was a whirling dervish during one incendiary guitar solo. 
Bassist Garry Tallent, inconspicuous as always, kept time with "Mighty 
Max" Weinberg on drums. Roy Bittan was tinkling ivories as well as ever.
 "Miami Steve" Van Zandt was, well, "Miami Steve" (enough said) and 
Charles Giordano served well as Danny's replacement on organ. Mama 
(Patti Scialfa) stayed home and Soozie Tyrell added strings, background 
vocals, acoustic guitar and any percussion that wasn't nailed down.<br>
<br>
Early in the set, Bruce paid homage to the recently departed Federici by
 telling a "Danny story." It was the stuff from which rock lore is 
borne.<br>
<br>
The story was about a bunch of 19 year olds, bandmates and buds sharing a
 rental home in 1969. Largely due to the CB Radio antics of one highly 
spirited keyboard player (Danny invited every trucker within CB hailing 
distance) the house quickly became, in Bruce's words, "The Only House of
 Freaks in New Jersey."<br>
<br>
That gig lasted exactly one month. After 30 days, the landlord called a 
permanent time out, showing the lads the door in the process. 
Thankfully, their musical careers have enjoyed more "legs."<br>
<br>
From the Bottom Line to the Meadowlands, from Long Island to South 
Florida, I have followed Bruce and the E Streeters from virtually day 
one. This night, Ft. Lauderdale was the latest "Lucky Town."<br>
<br>
And this reviewer remains lucky to be able to relate the events of 
another unbelievable night of Brothers and Sisters in Arms, one more 
night of great fortune to be entertained by the house rockin', pants 
droppin', earth shockin', hard rockin', booty shakin', love makin', 
heart breakin', soul cryin' and, yes, death defyin' legendary E Street 
Band.</div>

<br>
Published: Monday, September 03, 2012, 12:23 AM     <br>
<br>
  By Tris McCall/The Star-Ledger <br>
<br>
<br>
The unsinkable Bruce Springsteen takes Citizens Bank Park.<br>
<br>
Two hours into his Sunday night concert -- the first of two scheduled 
for Citizens Bank Stadium in Philadelphia -- Bruce Springsteen was 
sprinting from one side of the stage to the other. More than three hours
 in, he was spinning around on his back, guitar in hand, singing 
"Rosalita." Almost three and a half hours after the stadium lights went 
down, he pulled a woman out of the audience, slow danced with her, and 
then picked her up like a groom carrying a bride across the threshhold, 
and brought her back to her friends.<br>
He took no breaks, paused only briefly before his encore set, and led 
his band through the obligatory false endings, cavalry-charge outros, 
and crescendos that would not be curtailed. This was rock and roll 
maximalism at its purest, done by a man who gives the impression that 
you'd have to rip the guitar out of his hands to stop him from 
strumming.<br>
How much stamina does Bruce Springsteen (and the members of his E Street
 Band) have? Let's put it this way: There were two enthusiastic 
superfans in front of me at the show. They began playing enthusiastic 
air guitar during the first song, and kept it up for hours. By the 
encore, they were spent. Springsteen kept going. Their instruments were 
imaginary. His was real.<br>
"He kicked my butt again!," said one of the guys. He kicked everybody's 
butt again, fella. And here's the amazing thing: He's going to do it all
 again tomorrow night.<br>
Mind you, none of this happened in the controlled climate of an arena. 
This concert was out on the outfield grass of a major league ballpark on
 the kind of night that prompts some players to ask out of the lineup. 
It was hot, wet, and sticky in Philadelphia. A few songs into the show, 
and the musicians' clothes were already soaked in sweat. Springsteen's 
voice sounded pleasantly ragged, and I wondered if all the touring had 
gotten to him, and if it would give out during the second half.<br>
Then something odd happened. As the members of the audience worked 
themselves up into the customary froth, the E Street Band seemed to get 
dryer. Springsteen's singing grew stronger. By the end of the concert, 
he was testifying like a street preacher visited by the Holy Spirit. 
Rain was in the forecast, and he prayed that it wouldn't come. Did the 
skies open? Of course not. The Boss gets what he wants. <br>
<br>
Altogether, the E Street Band played 25 songs in the main set, and 8 in 
the encore. As this was a Bruce Springsteen concert, they took it easy 
for exactly none of them. A few ballads were tucked in to give drummer 
Max Weinberg a blow, but by the end of the set, he looked about ready to
 pass out. He never dropped a stitch, though: Weinberg was terrific as 
always. He should be getting combat pay.<br>
The group continued the tradition of sign requests (fans in the front 
row hold up placards with songs they'd like to hear), airing "Good 
Rockin' Tonight," "Cadillac Ranch," "I'm on Fire," and a showstopping 
rendition of "Jersey Girl." They opened the show with a cover of 
"Summertime Blues" and closed with an inexhaustible version of "Twist 
and Shout." Heck, they might still be playing it. Somebody ought to go 
by the stadium and check. They can't stay there forever; eventually, the
 Phillies are going to need it back.<br>
<br>
Here's the very long setlist-<br>

DON ERMEN, OTTAWA SUN<br>

Bruce is the new biography of Bruce Springsteen by Peter Ames Carlin.<br>
  <br>
For devoted Bruce Springsteen fans, there’s probably not much you don’t know about the man.<br>
<br>
Thanks to the wealth of information you can find on the Internet, the 
same could be said of many our top artists in today’s pop culture. But 
unlike factoids, rumours and journalism of varying quality, Bruce, the 
new biography by Peter Ames Carlin, attempts to explain what drives the 
man behind the legions of fans, hit songs and blue-collar hero persona.<br>
<br>
His relationship with his father is well known. It’s hard not to know 
that songs like Adam Raised a Cain, Factory and Independence Day all 
deal with Springsteen’s relationship with his father, Doug Springsteen. 
Even casual fans know that songs like Dancing in the Dark, while 
musically upbeat and one of his greatest hits, is lyrically dark and 
depressing.<br>
<br>
I get up in the evening and I ain’t got nothing to say<br>
<br>
I come home in the morning, I go to bed feeling the same way<br>
<br>
I ain’t nothing but tired, man I’m just tired and bored with myself<br>
<br>
Hey there baby, I could use just a little help<br>
<br>
Yet the energy of his performance is such that every time Springsteen 
sings Dancing in the Dark, usually in the encore, every fan jumps to his
 feet.<br>
<br>
But the new bio still manages to surprise with a few gems here and 
there, thanks most likely to Springsteen’s participation. Although it’s 
not an official biography, Springsteen agreed to be interviewed for the 
book, along with members of the E Street Band, former managers, friends,
 family members, and ex-girlfriends.<br>
<br>
Probably the most interesting material is the early childhood history. 
It really gives you an insight into what shaped Springsteen. Carlin’s 
storytelling approach is engaging. In fact, the best parts of the book 
are the passages when he moved away from breaking down songs and quoting
 lyrics.<br>
<br>
The disappointment is that there isn’t more of Springsteen’s voice. Yes,
 it was a coup to even get the Boss to participate. But there are just 
as many quotes from other sources. In fairness, though, these sources 
are legitimate and credited properly. This is not an “unknown source 
said” kind of bio.<br>
<br>
The book brags that this is the first time band members have spoken 
openly about the breakup of the E Street Band after the 1989 tour. Well,
 if the book is a true reflection of how they all feel, I’m not quite 
sure what the big deal was. It seems like it was a bigger deal to the 
fans.<br>
<br>
Bassist Garry Tallent wasn’t surprised. Drummer Max Weinberg was hurt 
but not surprised. Guitarist Nils Lofgren, who had only joined the band 
for the Born in the USA tour, was just happy to have spent any time with
 Springsteen. Steven Van Zandt had already left and pianist Roy Bittan 
stayed on in Bruce’s new band. The only person who really talked about 
how crushed he’d been was Clarence Clemons, the beloved saxophonist who 
died of stroke complications in 2011.<br>
<br>
Where the book succeeds is detailing Springsteen’s attention to detail, 
his quest for that perfect sound, the perfect lyrics. At times you 
wonder if it was insecurity that drove Springsteen to rewrite songs, 
change lyrics or spend up two years to deliver an album. Or was his 
commitment a sign of genius, the path of a street poet who wanted to be 
taken seriously, who believes rock music can make a difference, even if 
at times it only lifts people up for the duration of a concert.<br>
<br>
Springsteen concerts are legendary because of his energy and endurance. 
He’s a crowd pleaser, who even at the age of 63 will venture into the 
audience several times during the night, dance with a fan, get a little 
kid to sing on stage and crowd surf. Amongst all the energy and 
showmanship, sometimes we forget what makes Springsteen great is his 
songs. And if there was ever any belief that he just tossed them off, 
cruising the edges of a pop path, this book puts that firmly to rest.<br>
<br>
A lot of Bruce covers Springsteen’s early days and as Carlin explores 
his songs, you realize Springsteen is more than a working class hero. 
Springsteen’s connection to his blue-collar roots is strong, but without
 his artistry and sincere concern about oppression and injustice his 
message wouldn’t translate so effectively.<br>
<br>
There are artists out there who think they put themselves under the 
harsh spotlight, artists who think they are baring their souls. But no 
one does it quite like Springsteen. His unvarnished emotions, 
convictions and sincerity, woven into powerful songs, connect listeners 
to the anguish of our times.<br>
<br>
Whether it’s the anger over Wall Street robber barons, love for a woman,
 conflict over a marriage or the struggle to understand his father, 
there are very few artists who dig as deep as Springsteen.<br>
<br>
This biography puts into words the feelings fans have for Springsteen 
and his music, providing insight into the reasons he’s left — and 
continues to leave — an indelible mark on music and pop culture.<br>
<br>
The determination, the isolation, the single-mindedness of Springsteen 
is on display. And just like his concerts, it’s  an experience.</div>

<br>
Air Canada Centre, Toronto - July 14, 2005	<br>
An intimate evening with the Boss	<br>
By JANE STEVENSON - Toronto Sun	<br>
<br>
TORONTO - Bruce Springsteen has two musical personas. The best-known -- 
and most beloved -- is the wild rock 'n' roll leader of the E Street 
Band who last visited these parts with a feverish show in September 2003
 at SkyDome.<br>
<br>
And then there's the more serious, acoustic folk troubadour who plays 
alone on stage, like Springsteen did way back in January 1996 at Massey 
Hall during his first-ever solo acoustic tour.<br>
<br>
Last night, Toronto fans saw the return of the more contemplative 
singer-songwriter as his one-man show landed at the wildly inappropriate
 Air Canada Centre in support of his latest solo album, Devils &amp; 
Dust, released in April.<br>
<br>
If ever there was a concert crying out for an intimate setting, this was it.<br>
<br>
Instead, about 8,000 people -- who snapped up tickets for the ACC's 
concert bowl setting in one day -- found themselves watching him perform
 alone in a hockey arena.<br>
<br>
Thankfully, it was Springsteen before them playing on a theatre-like 
stage complete with curtains, chandeliers and moody lighting, along with
 two smallish video screens.<br>
	<br>
There's a reason they call this guy The Boss, who is a riveting 
storyteller, especially when you're forced to really listen to the 
words.<br>
<br>
"I can use as much quiet as I can get tonight, other than that, enjoy 
yourselves," Springsteen cautioned concert-goers, who never-the-less 
whistled and yelled "Bruuuuce!" whenever they felt the urge.<br>
<br>
Later in the two-hour-and-10-minute show, while introducing the new 
song, Long Time Comin', he asked people to hold off on the whistles 
until the end of the tune.<br>
<br>
"I go crazy when I hear that," he said.<br>
<br>
The 55-year-old New Jersey native opened with a stirring rendition of 
Into The Fire, from his 9/11-inspired release, 2002's The Rising, which 
was made with the E Street Band.<br>
<br>
Given the terrorist attacks in London one week ago, it seemed an appropriate choice.<br>
<br>
But it didn't take long for Devils &amp; Dust to rear its head with the title track, another emotional highlight of the evening.<br>
<br>
And while Springsteen may have not been backd by a band, he brought 
enough instruments with him, alternating between playing piano, 
harmonium, organ, acoustic guitar and harmonica.<br>
<br>
He also played with his vocals, sometimes backing away from the 
microphone, while other times using vocal distortion or a falsetto voice
 for mixed results.<br>
<br>
Set standouts included The Rising's Empty Sky and the title track, Long 
Time Comin' - which he dedicated "to the moms and pops," Highway 29 from
 1995's The Ghost Of Tom Joad, the new songs All I'm Thinkin' About, 
Reno, The Hitter, and Matamoros Banks, 1987's Brilliant Disguise and 
1978's The Promised Land.<br>
<br>
Springsteen also shined whenver he explained how a song came about, like
 the 1972 gem, For You, saying it was one of the first love songs he 
ever wrote because his father told him growing up they were government 
propaganda to encourage people to get married and pay taxes.<br>
<br>
Or the new song, Jesus Was An Only Son, in which the lapsed Catholic 
talked about imagining Jesus owning a bar with Mary as the barkeep.<br>
<br>
"There's something about those bartenders," said Springsteen with a grin.</div>

<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Review: Springsteen delivers a moving house party at Fenway</strong><br>
<br>
When Bruce Springsteen asked Boston’s Fenway Park crowd who was seeing 
him and the E Street Band for the first time, a surprising number of 
hands went up. “The pressure’s on!” he declared. He needn’t have 
worried.<br>
<br>
One can only assume the newbies in the crowd went home in awe that the 
62-year-old Springsteen had managed to live up to his billing and then 
some, barnstorming through a 3 1/2-hour set that energized the Fenway 
crowd from start to finish.<br>
<br>
What’s perhaps even more remarkable is that Springsteen and the band 
also managed to match his own high standards set through decades of 
memorable Boston shows. While it may have traded some of the raw emotion
 of March’s TD Garden concert for a house-party vibe more appropriate 
for the venue, Tuesday’s show spotlighted Springsteen’s energy and his 
band’s versatility as well as any Beantown show in recent memory.<br>
<br>
The specter of loss was still a major theme, with mentions of ghosts in 
Fenway and beyond, and tributes to late saxophonist Clarence Clemons 
coming along with a nod to late Red Sox legend Johnny Pesky, who passed 
away this week. (“Better shine a light on that right field foul pole,” 
Springsteen said during “My City of Ruins,” motioning toward the park’s 
legendary Pesky’s Pole.)<br>
<br>
But where those emotions felt more raw back in March, here they took on 
the feel of an Irish wake, of moving on joyously without forgetting the 
past. As Springsteen sang in “Badlands,” “It ain’t no sin to be glad 
you’re alive,” and that was definitely the case at Fenway Park Tuesday.<br>
<br>
The Boss and his band stomped and hollered through a litany of driving 
numbers, kicking off with a tight, focused “The Promised Land” and 
launching right into a raucous “Out in the Street.” But he really got 
down to business with the songs from his latest album, “Wrecking Ball,” 
which Springsteen imbued with even more thunderous energy and heft than 
he did at his Garden show.<br>
<br>
“We Take Care of Our Own,” the album’s sole true rocker, showed 
Springsteen at his anthemic best, and the soaring “Wrecking Ball” 
continues to grow in power as an aging man’s (and band’s) rage against 
the dying of the light. And “Shackled and Drawn” was an absolute 
highlight, with its chain-gang beat and fabulous shared vocals by Cindy 
Mizelle of the “E Street Choir.”<br>
<br>
Much of the rest of the setlist featured material familiar to even more 
casual fans, with songs from the monster hit “Born in the USA” taking up
 several slots. Springsteen made the most of them, turning “Darlington 
County” into a massive sing-along and strumming furiously through 
“Working on the Highway” immediately after.<br>
But the rest of his long career was also well represented, with a 
stunning “Spirit in the Night” featuring Springsteen seated on the stage
 and flanked by saxophonist Jake Clemons, nephew of Clarence. (“This was
 all before you were born,” Springsteen stopped to tell him before 
closing out the song.)<br>
“The E Street Shuffle” felt made for the horn section and the stellar 
percussion of Everett Bradley, and two “Nebraska” tracks – “Atlantic 
City,” a standout for drummer Max Weinberg, and the band’s boogie-woogie
 take on “Johnny 99” featuring Roy Bittan’s rollicking piano – were 
terrific mid-set surprises. Also, Nils Lofgren's whirling dervish guitar
 virtuosity (on a new set of hips, yet) brought power and personality to
 a driving “Because the Night.”<br>
<br>
A few rarities also popped up, including an aching “Drive All Night” 
from the River and a bluesy garage rock take on John Lee Hooker’s “Boom 
Boom” by request. It all added up to a classic effort by a man and a 
band that never seems to give up.<br>
By the eight-song encore, with Springsteen feigning (?) exhaustion and 
his perennial sideman Steven Van Zandt prowling over him with a wet 
sponge to revive him for the last two songs, band and crowd were one – a
 huge, sweaty, smiling mass of rock ’n’ roll redemption.<br>
<br>
The ghosts of Fenway couldn’t have asked for a better night.<br>

REVIEW: Springsteen’s second Fenway show spotlights a loose Bruce<br>
<br>
Posted Aug 16, 2012 @ 11:34 AM</strong><br>
<br>
If Bruce Springsteen’s first show at Fenway Park this week was an 
example of the powerhouse tour-de-force the Boss is known for – complete
 with a theme and a meticulously planned flow of classic and current 
songs – night two was an equally effective example of the other kind of 
concert he sometimes has up his sleeve: A loose, fly-by-the-seat-of-his 
pants party filled with surprises, unexpected detours and an 
anything-goes energy.<br>
<br>
From the very beginning when Springsteen wandered out onto the stage 
alone to greet the crowd and launch into “Thunder Road” accompanied only
 by Roy Bittan on piano, it was clear it was going to be a different 
kind of night. And the collection of rare tracks, covers and requests 
that followed more than bore that out – of the 30 songs played 
Wednesday, 18 hadn’t made an appearance the night before. For most 
artists, that’s an entire show.<br>
<br>
After “Thunder Road,” Springsteen brought out the E Street Band and 
launched into a “summertime set” of “Hungry Heart,” “Sherry Darling,” 
“Summertime Blues” and “Girls in Their Summer Clothes,” the last one 
being the first of many audience requests. (“Does anybody remember the 
bridge?” Bruce asked the band, probably only half-kidding.) A few songs 
later he took a sign request for Eddie Floyd’s “Knock on Wood,” which he
 said the band had never played – and they nailed it straight through, 
with Springsteen’s E Street Horns propelling the number into the soul 
stratosphere.<br>
<br>
Unlike the first Fenway show, which had more than its share of favorites
 from “Born in the USA,” Wednesday’s concert seemed more geared to 
diehard fans who’ve followed Bruce from the beginning, or wish they had.
 The often requested but rarely played outtake “Frankie” was one soaring
 example, along with “Prove It All Night” with its “1978 intro” 
featuring Bittan’s piano and Springsteen’s stinging guitar. The guitar 
duel between Springsteen and Steven Van Zandt to end that song would 
have blown off Fenway’s roof if it had one.<br>
<br>
The loose approach had its drawbacks: The pacing lagged at spots, 
especially in comparison to the epic heft of Tuesday’s show – things 
tend to grind to a halt when Springsteen wanders into the crowd to 
collect sign requests, a staple of the last tour that he revived on 
Wednesday. And the theme of hardship, loss and moving on dissipated a 
bit as the focus shifted away from his new album “Wrecking Ball” and 
onto an eclectic mix of older classics and rarities – it felt more 
backward-looking than other shows on this tour.<br>
<br>
But as far as individual standouts, there was certainly no shortage: 
“Backstreets” was the best I’ve ever seen it, wrenching and emotional, 
complete with a snippet of “Dream Baby Dream,” the Suicide song with 
which Springsteen memorably closed his “Devils &amp; Dust” shows in 
2005. Later, a gradually steadying rain prompted a beautiful acoustic 
“Who’ll Stop the Rain” to start the encore, and who can complain about a
 set that includes both Mitch Ryder’s “Detroit Medley” and Gary U.S. 
Bond’s raucous “Quarter to Three”?<br>
<br>
The Fenway stand as a whole – in all its sprawling, joyous glory – will 
no doubt move immediately into Springsteen fan lore, and leaves just one
 question unanswered: What can possibly be left for his stop at Gillette
 Stadium in Foxboro this Saturday? Bruce’s Boston-area fans can’t wait 
to find out.</div>
