TUNNEL OF LOVE<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen<br>
<br>
Columbia Records CBS 40999</strong><br>
<br>
First let's set the stage.<br>
<br>
June 1984--Bruce Springsteen releases Born in the USA. Later that year, 
he becomes unofficial speech writer for both Ronald Reagan and Walter 
Mondale, as each reaches for a piece of the Springsteen zeitgeist. 
Pressing the flesh and kissing babies in Bruce's home state of New 
Jersey, Reagan says something like: "You have a native son of this great
 state who shares the same aspirations for this country as I do, and I 
can assure you, my campaign for presidency will be born to run!"<br>
<br>
Lee Iacocca offers Springsteen $10 million to become official copywriter
 for Chrysler's commercials, an offer Springsteen declines. Miller Beer 
appropriates what it can from Springsteen's album without precipitating a
 lawsuit, proclaiming that its beer is "born and brewed in the USA."<br>
<br>
Bumper stickers flower on the freeways, exclaiming "Bruce: the Rambo of Rock!"<br>
<br>
The album eventually sells 18 million units worldwide. And everyone from
 presidential candidates to bespectacled TV commentators to beer 
companies hurries to cash in on Brucemania, to claim a part of the 
Springsteen ethos for themselves.<br>
<br>
October 1987--Springsteen releases Tunnel of Love, with "Brilliant 
Disguise" as its first single. Its refrain goes something like this:<br>
<br>
So when you look at me<br>
<br>
You better look hard and look twice<br>
<br>
Is that me baby<br>
<br>
Or just a brilliant disguise?<br>
<br>
Most reviewers of Tunnel of Love will look at the album's title and at 
that refrain and tell you that this latest Springsteen album reflects 
his recent marriage to Julianne Phillips, that it is an album about 
romance. And those reviewers would be right--Tunnel of Love is partly 
about marriage and affairs of the heart. But it's also an album about 
success, the sort of success Springsteen has enjoyed--or 
tolerated--these past three years. Or more precisely, Tunnel of Love is 
about apprehension, apprehension about loving a disguise and calling 
that romance, apprehension about becoming so popular that half one's 
audience mistakes a bitter declamation of faith and betrayal like "Born 
in the USA" for a simple affirmation, for the sort of patriotic salute 
that tests no faith and suffers no betrayal.<br>
<br>
In one sense, Tunnel of Love is a response, Springsteen's reaction to 
all that has happened to him publicly and privately in the last three 
years. And accountably the album is shot through with images of wealth 
and of marriage . . . and also of deep suspicion. In the album's 
greatest moment, these images fuse, take on the same face, the same 
form, until it becomes impossible to tell the romance from its disguise,
 the hope for success and wealth from its uglier consequences. On "Walk 
Like a Man," Springsteen describes a wedding with these words:<br>
<br>
Well, would they ever look so happy again<br>
<br>
The handsome groom and his bride<br>
<br>
As they stepped into that long black limousine<br>
<br>
For that mystery ride?<br>
<br>
Read those words literally, and it's obviously a song about a honeymoon.
 Listen to those lines in the context of the whole song, the whole 
album, and it begins to sound like more--maybe it's a song about 
success, fancy cars, doing well, getting rich. Spin the words one more 
time and out tumble threats, references to two Elvis songs, allusions 
and images that turn into riddles, and once one knows the references, 
harbingers of fear. One of those Elvis songs is about a poor country 
girl who takes to the city, dies in a car crash, and rides to the 
graveyard in a long black limousine. The other Elvis song, "Mystery 
Train," goes one step beyond "Long Black Limousine," replacing the 
certitude of tragedy in that song with a complete and open-ended 
ambiguity much like that in Tunnel of Love:<br>
<br>
Train I ride is sixteen coaches long<br>
<br>
Train I ride is sixteen coaches long<br>
<br>
The girl I love is on that train and gone<br>
<br>
Gone where? To someone else, to the city, or to her death? Elvis never 
tells us, and neither does Springsteen. You can read Springsteen's 
mystery ride as just a honeymoon, or even as just the road to endless 
wealth and fame, but that won't negate the threat that underlies those 
long black limousines, won't prevent that ride from turning suddenly 
into a funeral procession. The long black limousine that holds all the 
hopes of romance and wealth is the same car that drives us to the 
graveyard. What emerges from the album's lyrics are ambiguity and an 
enormous suspicion; this is a worried man, speaking softly and moving 
very cautiously.<br>
<br>
But in that sort of caution is the album's greatest paradox. Lyrically, 
"Walk Like a Man" is brilliant. With this song and a few others, 
Springsteen stakes his claim to being the greatest rock 'n' roll 
wordsmith since Chuck Berry, the writer most acutely aware of the 
poetics and subtleties of everyday speech. But musically "Walk Like a 
Man" is a disaster, synthesizers warbling along where you'd expect the E
 Street Band, Roy Bittan's piano, Danny Federici's organ fills. What 
makes "Walk Like a Man" brilliant lyrically--its caution--makes it 
musically a mush, a sort of noncommittal sidestep that stakes no claim, 
moves nowhere.<br>
<br>
The rest of the album musically is likewise hesitant, which is 
especially maddening if one has had a chance to hear some of the 
material that Springsteen chose not to include. One such song, "Murder 
Incorporated" (which is available only on unofficial releases), 
confronts many of the same questions as Tunnel of Love--shows the same 
concern that success means only that people will distort your words into
 whatever they want. But instead of answering with caution, "Murder 
Incorporated" responds violently with a "No! in thunder." Musically a 
cross between "All Along the Watchtower" and "Gimme Shelter," it 
surpasses anything on Tunnel of Love.<br>
<br>
The figure of Elvis Presley hangs over at least one song from Tunnel of 
Love and, I think, over the whole album; he represents, in Greil 
Marcus's words, "the specter of possibility--in rock and roll, pop 
culture, America, modern life--and he remains the fact of ruin." Elvis 
gives us not only a vision of success, wealth, fame, and romance but the
 bloated, drug-riddled corpse of the consequences.<br>
<br>
Everybody has a pet theory, somehow linked to Elvis's success, to 
explain his decline--perhaps because there are so many "obvious" 
reasons. Elvis went downhill because he went to Hollywood and made cheap
 movies, because he went to Las Vegas, because he got fat and old, 
because he released so much utter trash.<br>
<br>
But no one will be able to say the same about Springsteen, because 
compared to Elvis, he hasn't done any of the stupid things, hasn't 
succumbed to any of the obvious traps of stardom, hasn't gone on TV to 
sell you a Chrysler or gone to Hollywood to make bad movies, hasn't 
gotten fat and old. Most of all, he hasn't dumped on his fans the way 
Elvis did, put out trash so sloppy and worthless that it becomes an 
absurd, perverse joke.<br>
<br>
Tunnel of Love is a finely crafted album, careful, cautious, lyrically 
brilliant in places. But its caution, possibly Springsteen's response to
 his own success, may also signal the beginning of the end.</div>

Paris <br>
February 16, 2012</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Q- Ladies and gentlemen, it’s time for me to fulfill a lifetime dream, 
to share a stage with Bruce Springsteen. A few introductory questions 
about Wrecking Ball. I'm curious to know why you've changed your 
producer, after working with Brendan O'Brien for so many years, and I’d 
like to know more about the process of recording.<br>
 <br>
A- The guy who produced this record is a fellow named Ron Aniello. I 
assisted him, and Jon [Landau] executive produced. Ron had worked on a 
few of Patti [Scialfa]’s records previously, and I was actually working 
on another record before this record. I spent on-and-off about a year on
 that one before I threw it out, which is something I do every once in a
 while. He came in to help me finish that one, and as we went along, a 
few of the songs started to come up for this record; he had a lot of 
fresh ideas about the way the music could sound, and he had a large 
library of sounds — alternative and hip-hop elements — and we used quite
 a bit of different looping techniques. It was just a very different 
experience, really, with the two of us in the studio when we started 
out.<br>
<br>
You were in your hometown in New Jersey for these recording sessions?<br>
<br>
Yeah, we were in our own studio, and each one of the songs started off 
as kind of a folk song, with just me and the acoustic guitar. And then 
everything else got slipped on.<br>
<br>
And you had special guests, like Tom Morello…<br>
<br>
Tommy Morello from Rage Against the Machine, he came in and played the 
guitar on "This Depression" and on "Jack of all Trades." Patti and 
Soozie sang; Max plays on a cut; Clarence is on "Land of Hope and 
Dreams."<br>
<br>
As we have all heard, it’s a very powerful record that could have been 
written by both a wise old dog and a very young, brilliant man. Would 
you say you write more strongly when you're pissed off?<br>
<br>
You can never go wrong pissed off in rock 'n' roll. The first half of 
it, particularly, is very angry. The genesis of the record was after 
2008, when we had the huge financial crisis in the States, and there was
 really no accountability for years and years. People lost their homes, 
and I had friends who were losing their homes, and nobody went to jail. 
Nobody was responsible. People lost enormous amounts of their net worth.
 Previous to Occupy Wall Street, there was no pushback: there was no 
movement, there was no voice that was saying just how outrageous — that a
 basic theft had occurred that struck at the heart of what the entire 
American idea was about. It was a complete disregard of history, of 
context, of community; it was all about "what can I get today." It was 
just an enormous fault line that cracked the American system wide open. 
And I think its repercussions are just beginning to really, really be 
felt.<br>
<br>
So I think I wrote "We Take Care of Our Own" somewhere around 2009 or 
2010, and I put it away in my book. And the idea behind that song was 
that’s what’s supposed to happen, but was not happening. My work has 
always been about judging the distance between American reality and the 
American dream — how far is that at any given moment. If you go back to 
the work that I did beginning certainly in the late ’70s, I’m always 
measuring that distance: how close are we, how far are we, how close are
 we? Everything from Darkness on the Edge of Town, The River, to 
Nebraska, Born in the U.S.A., The Ghost of Tom Joad, those are all 
records that were always taking the measure of that distance.<br>
<br>
That song, “We Take Care of Our Own,” it asks the question that the rest
 of the record tries to answer. Which is, of course: Do we? Do we take 
care of our own? And we often don’t. We don’t provide an equal playing 
field for all our citizens. And at the same time, it doesn’t cede what 
would be patriotism or images like the flag to just the right. I claim 
those, as I’ve done in a lot of my work throughout the years. The rest 
of the record tries to answer the questions that come up in the last 
verse of that song: Where are the merciful hearts? Where is the work 
that I need? Where is the spirit that reigns over me? Where are the eyes
 that see? Those are the questions the rest of the record tries to 
answer and that are embedded in the question that the title of that song
 is, “We Take Care of Our Own.”<br>
<br>
Concerning patriotism, aren’t you afraid that a song like this, “We Take
 Care of Our Own,” might be misunderstood like “Born in the U.S.A.”?<br>
<br>
You can’t be afraid of those images. I mean, I write carefully and 
precisely, and I believe clearly. And then you put it out there, and 
people hear it, and then it’s up to them. And if you’re missing it, 
you’re not quite thinking hard enough; you know, you need to go back and
 take a second look sometimes. But I don’t want to cede those feelings 
to just the right side of the street. I don’t like to do that. Which is 
why my work is often claimed by different political groups, because 
there is a feeling of patriotism underneath. That’s something I’ve had 
in “Land of Hope and Dreams,” and in my best music. But at the same 
time, it’s a very critical, questioning, often angry sort of patriotism.
 That’s not something I’m prepared to give up for fear that somebody 
might simplify what I’m saying.<br>
<br>
I have many questions, but I’m not supposed to be the only one to ask.<br>
<br>
Okay. I know: how did I get this good looking? I can’t tell you. All right, next? [Laughs] Genes. Next?<br>
<br>
[Moderator opens question to the floor]<br>
<br>
<br>
On this record, you include songs that aren't exactly new, with “Land of
 Hope and Dreams” and “Wrecking Ball” having been performed before. But 
they fit in the moment, right?<br>
<br>
“Wrecking Ball” seemed like a metaphor for what had occurred — it’s an 
image where something is destroyed to build something new, and it was 
also an image [suggesting] just the flat destruction of some fundamental
 American values and ideas that occurred over the past 30 years. It was a
 30-year process of deregulation and different things that added up to 
the inequality that we’re experiencing in the States right now. So, it 
seemed like a good metaphor.<br>
<br>
With “Land of Hope and Dreams,” I needed a song that was very spiritual,
 because the record moves from guys who are really very angry to guys 
who are angry but constructive. To me there’s always a spiritual element
 in that, and a religious element to some degree. Maybe that’s just my 
Catholic upbringing, but that’s how I write about it. So that song was 
big enough.<br>
<br>
The trouble with a record, if you write a really big song at the 
beginning, the record demands to gain size as it goes along — or else 
you blew your wad at the top, my friend [laughs]. That’s why, how many 
records do you put on where it's like, hey, that first song!… That 
second song’s good… [snores]. You’re out by number seven or eight.<br>
<br>
But on our records, I try to build them so there’s a question asked, and
 there are scenarios where those questions are played out. If you look 
at this record, there’s a question asked: Do we take care of our own? I 
don’t think so, a lot of times. So then there are scenarios where you 
meet the characters who have been impacted by the failure of those ideas
 and values. You get to the guy on “Easy Money,” he’s going out for a 
robbing spree — which is really just what’s occurred at the top of the 
pyramid. He’s imitating your guys on Wall Street the only way he knows 
how: I’m going out tonight for easy money.<br>
<br>
If you trace it along, every song introduces you to a slightly different
 character. Then at the end, I’ve got to find some way to mend their 
stories together so it all makes sense to you. I’ve got to try to find 
some way not necessarily to answer the question that I asked, but to 
move the question forward, to move the ideas forward, to move forward in
 the search for a new day. “A new day” comes up a lot in the record, 
which is really just, okay, how do you move forward? I’m interested in 
that.<br>
<br>
So the record has to build, and it has to expand emotionally and 
spiritually, and it’s also supposed to be throwing you a good time in 
the mix. You know, it’s got to sound good and play great. That’s always a
 challenge, but “Land of Hope and Dreams” was a song of such size and 
spiritual dimension that by the time the end of the record came around, 
it fit really well.<br>
<br>
Also, those are voices from history and other sides of the grave. If you
 listen to the record, I use a lot of folk music. There’s some Civil War
 music. There’s gospel music. There are ’30s horns in “Jack of All 
Trades.” That’s the way I used the music — the idea was that the music 
was going to contextualize historically that this has happened before: 
it happened in the 1970s, it happened in the ’30s, it happened in the 
1800s… it’s cyclical. Over, and over, and over, and over again. So I try
 to pick up some of the continuity and the historical resonance through 
the music.<br>
<br>
In the past, you’ve committed yourself to play for presidential 
candidates, and of course the presidential election is coming up this 
year in the U.S. Are you planning to sing or do some concerts for Barack
 Obama?<br>
<br>
I got into that sort of by accident. What it was, the Bush years were so
 horrific that you couldn’t just sit around. I never campaigned for a 
politician previous to John Kerry. But at that moment it was such a 
blatant disaster occurring at the top of government that you felt if you
 had any cachet whatsoever, you had to cash it in, because you couldn’t 
sit around and watch it. So I campaigned for John Kerry, and Obama last 
time — and I’m glad that I did — but I’m not a professional campaigner, 
and every four years I don’t think I’m gonna pick a guy and go out for 
him. I’d prefer to stay on the sidelines. I generally believe an artist 
is supposed to be the canary in the coalmine, and you’re better off with
 a certain distance from the seat of power.<br>
<br>
In 2008, you came out very strongly for President Obama. Are you still in the same mood today?<br>
<br>
I think he did a lot of good things: he kept GM alive, which was 
incredibly important to Detroit, Michigan. He got the healthcare law 
passed, though I wish there had been a public option and that it didn’t 
leave citizens the victims of the insurance companies. He killed Osama 
bin Laden, which I think was extremely important. He brought some sanity
 to the top level of government.<br>
<br>
He’s more friendly to corporations than I thought he would be, and there
 aren't as many middle class or working class voices heard in the 
administration as I thought there would be. I would have liked to see 
more active job creation sooner than it came, and I’d like to have seen 
some of these foreclosures stopped or somehow mitigated. The banks have 
had some kind of a settlement, a partial settlement, but really, there’s
 a lot of people it’s not going to assist. I still support the 
president, but there are plenty of things — I thought Guantanamo would 
have been closed by now. On the other hand, we’re out of Iraq, and 
hopefully we’ll be out of Afghanistan soon.<br>
<br>
So many people after 9/11, and so many people these past couple years, 
look to you for your interpretation of events. Does that make you feel 
any kind of a burden? That so many people care? Look at us: when we were
 waiting for you earlier, so many people care about what you think, and 
what you feel about what is happening in the world.<br>
<br>
Actually, I’m terribly burdened, and at night when I’m sleeping in my 
big house, it’s killing me [laughs]. It’s a rough life, it’s a brutal 
life! The rock music business: brutal, brutal, brutal. Don’t believe 
what anybody tells you.<br>
<br>
No, it’s a blessed life. And these are just things I’m interested in, 
and things I’ve been interested in having a conversation with my 
audience about.<br>
<br>
I enjoyed artists when I was young who tried to, one way or another, 
take on the world — for better or for worse — and who were involved in 
the events of the day as well as just entertaining people. I have a big 
audience: I have Democrats, I have plenty of Republicans, I have people 
who just come to dance and enjoy themselves, and people who are 
interested in the social aspects of what I’m writing about. And I’ve 
really just enjoyed it all.<br>
<br>
So I just enjoy having that conversation. If I have something to say or 
if I can write a song about it at a given time, I do. And if I don’t, 
then I don’t. I write to process my own experiences. I always figured 
that if I do that for me, then I do that for you. You write for yourself
 initially, just trying to understand the world you live in. And if you 
do that well enough, then it projects to your audience. But I’m not in 
elective office where I have to come up with a plan every day. I don’t 
experience it as a burden. It’s not like that. It’s pretty much a 
charmed life, I would say, if you’re a musician. That’s why they call it
 playing.<br>
<br>
On this record, more than ever, we have spiritual references, biblical 
quotes, things like that. Is it because you feel your own mortality now?<br>
<br>
No, I think I just got completely brainwashed as a child with 
Catholicism. Once you’re in… it’s like that Al Pacino line, I keep 
trying to get out, they keep pulling me back! Once you’re a Catholic, 
you’re always a Catholic. You get involved in these things in your very,
 very formative years. I took religious education for the first eight 
years of school; I lived next to a church, a convent, a rectory, and the
 Catholic school. I saw every wedding, every funeral, every Mass. Your 
life was filled with the smell of incense and priests and nuns coming 
and going, so it’s given me a very active sense of spiritual life, and 
made it very difficult sexually, but that’s all right [laughs].<br>
<br>
On another subject, could you say a few words about the transition from 
Clarence Clemons to Jake? There's a great portion of your eulogy where 
you say, “Clarence doesn’t leave the E Street Band when he dies. He 
leaves when we die.”<br>
<br>
I met Clarence when I was 22. That’s my son’s age. I look at my son, and
 he’s still a child, you know? Twenty-two is… you’re just a kid. And I 
guess Clarence might have been 30 at the time, so it goes back to the 
beginning of my adult life. And we had a relationship that was, I would 
say, elemental, from the very beginning. It wasn’t about anything we 
necessarily said to one another, it was just about what happened when we
 got close. Something happened. It fired peoples’ imaginations; it fired
 my own imagination and my own dreams. It made me want to write songs 
for that saxophone sound.<br>
<br>
Losing Clarence is like losing something elemental. It’s like losing the
 rain, or air. And that’s a part of life. The currents of life affect 
even the dream world of popular music; there’s no escape. And so that is
 just something that’s going to be missing.<br>
<br>
We’re lucky in that we have people around: we have Eddie Manion, who had
 played with the Sessions Band, Southside Johnny, and our band 
previously; and Clarence’s brother had a son who, in 1988, came and saw 
his uncle play the saxophone. Clarence mentioned Jake to me quite a few 
years ago, and he was on the road with us a bit during the last tour, 
and he plays very well. He’s also been around the band and understands 
what our band is about. We were together with Clarence the week he 
passed away, and there’s a good musical and spiritual connection to 
Jake. So I’m excited about it. I think it’s going to add to the new 
conversation about these things that we’re going to have with the 
audience when we come out on stage.<br>
<br>
I heard that you’re going to have a complete horn section on tour—it takes a full horn section to replace Clarence.<br>
<br>
It does—it takes a village to replace the Big Man! It takes many men [laughs]! So, we’ll do the best we can.<br>
<br>
Do you think it’s going to change something in your stage personality?<br>
<br>
I don’t know. It will change everything a little bit — or a lot. The 
thrust of the music will still be what it is, but it’s a big loss. Any 
time you lose… you know, we lost Danny [Federici], and these are guys 
that you’ve been with for 35 or 40 years, and you just enjoyed them 
being there, you know? But you move on. Life doesn’t wait.<br>
<br>
So Clarence has to be replaced, you replaced Max at a few concerts with his son…<br>
<br>
Right. I’m working on replacing myself now, and I’m gonna stay home. I will be home, and somebody else can do it [laughs].<br>
<br>
On the last tour, you paid tribute to Joe Strummer, and you showed some 
support for Gaslight Anthem, and it seems you're still a huge, huge 
music fan. I was wondering, as you look back at your music fandom, what 
four or five bands would you start and end with?<br>
<br>
My own music fandom? Oh gosh… I hate to speak them aloud [laughs]. 
Because in truth, there were so many. I’d say one of the greatest things
 about music fandom is if you have one other person who is as fanatic 
about it as you are. That would be Steve [Van Zandt] for me. Steve and I
 have shared an insane and intense love affair with rock 'n' roll music 
since we were teenagers. If a guy changed the way he combed his hair, if
 they changed their outfits… pop is all about obsession with detail. 
It’s a world of symbolism, and you live and die by that sword, for 
better or worse. But it’s also a lot of fun, and fun to argue about and 
fun to debate about.<br>
<br>
So one of the great things was my connection with Steve in that area, 
and also with Jon. Jon was another freak who just was — it was all about
 the music. That’s the most important thing. You’ve got to have a friend
 or a pal who is sort of alongside of you in your insanity and knowswhy 
you can spend three hours debating these things. I remember Steve and I 
on the bus to New York City, battling who was supreme at the time, Led 
Zeppelin or the Jeff Beck Group. Old Elvis, young Elvis. It goes on 
forever. It still goes on to this day. So that’s a great blessing. I 
wish all of you a good rock 'n' roll partner.<br>
<br>
When you were younger, you could spend a full year agonizing about a 
drum sound in the studio. Now you release a record every two years.<br>
<br>
Now I just agonize. It’s not over anything special [laughs]. That’s the 
adult. When you’re an adult, you don’t have to worry it as much…<br>
<br>
Does that mean you're not trying to write "the great American novel,” with every record as one chapter?<br>
<br>
Mainly, you’re trying to make a good record. You’re trying to make a 
record that won’t waste peoples’ time. You’re trying to be an honest 
broker with your fans — if I’m asking them to listen to it, I’ve got to 
know that it’s everything I have, at least at that moment. That’s why I 
think my relationship with my audience remains so vital and so present.<br>
<br>
You’re always out there shooting for the moon, but in different ways. 
That hasn’t really changed. Our intentions on this album were no more 
nor less than our intentions on Born to Run or Nebraska. My intention is
 to do what, say, Bob Dylan did for me, which is to sort of kick open 
the door to your mind and your body, and make you want to move and think
 and experience and get angry and fall in love and reach for something 
higher than yourself and grovel around in something lower than that, 
also [laughs]. That’s the job description. That’s what people are paying
 you the money for: they’re paying you the money for something that 
can’t be bought. That’s the trick. And that’s what you’re supposed to 
deliver. You’re being paid for something that can’t be bought; it can 
only be manifested and shared. That’s when you’re doing a good job.<br>
<br>
Can I ask you about anger? About the anger you might feel, the anger 
there seems to be so much of in America in the last four to five years, 
that anger that surfaced in the Tea Party… Does that anger get to you? 
And what do you see as its source?<br>
<br>
I think our politics come out of psychology, whether we like to think so
 or not. And psychology, of course, comes out of your formative years. 
So my experience growing up — between when I was born to when I was 18, I
 grew up in a house where my mother was the primary breadwinner, and she
 worked very hard every day. My father struggled to find work, and I saw
 that it was deeply painful and created a crisis of masculinity, and 
that it was something that was irreparable at the end of the day.<br>
<br>
Those conditions are present in the United States right now, where you 
have a service economy overtaking a manufacturing economy. You’ve got a 
lot of guys who worked in manufacturing whose jobs have disappeared, and
 who are not necessarily coming out of those manufacturing jobs with the
 skills to move into a service economy. It’s a very, very different 
world. And so you have quite a few homes where the man is no longer the 
primary breadwinner.<br>
<br>
I think that the lack of work creates a loss of self. Work creates an 
enormous sense of self, as I saw in my mother. My mother was an 
inspiring, towering figure to me in the best possible way, and I picked 
up a lot of the way that I work from her. She was my working example: 
just steadfast, just relentless. But I also picked up a lot of the 
fallout. When your father doesn’t have those things, it results in a 
house that turns into quite a bit like a minefield. And it can be 
abusive in different ways — just tremendous emotional turmoil.<br>
 <br>
So, I kind of lost him, and I think a lot of the anger that surfaced in 
my music from day one comes out of that particular scene. And as I got 
older, I looked toward not just the psychological reasons in our house, 
but the social forces that played upon our home and made life more 
difficult. And that led me into a lot of the writing that I’ve done.<br>
<br>
I’m motivated circumstantially by the events of the day: that’s unfair; 
that’s theft; that’s against what we believe in; that’s not what America
 is about. But the deepest motivation — and the reasons to ask those 
questions, ultimately — comes out of the house that I grew up in and the
 circumstances that were there, which is mirrored around the United 
States with the level of unemployment we have right now. It’s 
devastating. People have to work. The country should strive for full 
employment. It’s the single thing that brings a sense of self and 
self-esteem, and a sense of place, a sense of belonging.<br>
<br>
There are times in the new songs when you come close to calling for an 
uprising. Can you really foresee that kind of response in America?<br>
<br>
Well, the thing that has happened that’s good in the States: there’s no 
doubt that the Occupy Wall Street movement in the United States was 
powerful about changing the national conversation, which has been stuck 
for decades primarily coming from the right. The Tea Party set it for 
quite a while, and if you saw the initial years of the Obama presidency,
 he was kind of working under the national tone that the Tea Party set.<br>
<br>
The minute Occupy Wall Street occurred, suddenly people were talking 
about economic inequality. No one has gotten anybody in the States to 
talk about economic inequality for the past two decades. You had 
politicians who tried — John Edwards tried with his “two Americas” — but
 they couldn’t get any traction. The labor movement wasn’t successful 
bringing that up as a current issue. But people in the street do it, and
 it works. It works. And if you look now, suddenly you’ve got Newt 
Gingrich calling Mitt Romney a vulture capitalist [laughs]. I mean, 
that’s impossible! That would never have occurred in ten million years 
without Occupy Wall Street. Where they go from here? I don’t know, and 
they’ve got to be careful; it’s a very delicate dance, and you don’t 
want to alienate the people who you’re speaking to. You can go off the 
edges with it. But it was without a doubt very important in changing the
 tenor of the national conversation. If you go to the United States 
right now, there's discussion about the one percent and the 99 percent; 
you have people talking about economic inequality, and what to do about 
that, for the first time in a very, very, very long time.<br>
<br>
I'd like to talk about your version of American patriotism, which has 
always been inclusive and generalist: it doesn’t matter where you come 
from, you can get on the train. And then you look America and the way 
that the Tea Party is polarizing one side, and there are people who 
don’t even believe that Obama is an American. Do you think that the 
political system is actually irreparably damaged? Can you actually have a
 “United” States?<br>
<br>
I don’t know. I think this is the issue: we’ve destroyed the idea of an 
equal playing field. They’ve had some recent studies that say, depending
 on where you come from, no, you can’t get on the train. There was a 
study recently that said that people were locked into the strata under 
which they were born. If you were born at the top, your chances for 
progress were great, and if you were born struggling, more often than 
not that’s where you were going to remain. So that’s a big promise 
that’s been broken.<br>
<br>
There’s a critical mass point where a society collapses. You can’t have a
 civilization where the society is so factionalized — you just can’t 
have it. People have got to be connected; everyone’s welfare has got to 
be connected. So, that’s a huge, huge challenge. The unemployment level 
is dropping a little now, which is good, but it’s going to take a long 
time to even remotely get back to the employment level we were at just a
 few years ago. Is it irreparable? I don’t know the answer to your 
question.<br>
<br>
I read somewhere that you were working on your autobiography. Is that true? And how's it going?<br>
<br>
I wrote a little bit, and then I stopped for a couple of years. I 
haven’t looked at it in quite a while. It’s one of those things… I wrote
 a little bit at one time, but then I see in the newspaper that 
everybody else is writing them, and so you don’t want to be just another
 goldfish in a bowl. It’s like: hey, Pete Townsend! He’s got one coming!
 Neil Young! He’s got one coming.… ahhhh, fuck it, the hell with it 
[laughs].<br>
<br>
What would you call it?<br>
<br>
The… Handsomest Man in Show Business. [Laughs] No, I have no idea. My 
Story!... I Believe! I may call it that. According to Me. [Laughs]<br>
<br>
I was just curious, how, throughout the years, throughout all your 
albums, how are you still keeping in touch with the public concern? I 
mean, practically, are you involved in your local community?<br>
<br>
Well, there’s an idea that it would be hard to do, but I don’t think 
that it is; I think you can make it hard. We have organizations we’ve 
worked with for 25 or 30 years, in every city and also in my local area.
 But really, I think the answer to what you’re asking, and I get asked 
this a lot, is that you have to remain interested and awake. You have to
 remain alert. You have to be constantly listening—and interested in 
listening—to what’s going on every day. You have to remain interested in
 life and in the way the world’s moving. You have to be awake and 
listening—that would be the best way that I would put it.<br>
<br>
As a writer, the way that I write, it’s like you’re hungry for food. 
That’s the writing impulse. The writing impulse is the same as one for 
hunger or for sex — it’s like that. It’s not something that’s related to
 your commercial fortunes. I mean, I’d do it for free. I’m glad that 
they’re paying me, but it was something I did for free before they were 
paying me.<br>
<br>
And so I’m constantly looking — the writer looks for something to push 
up against. Tom Stoppard, the playwright, once said he was envious of 
Vaclav Havel because he had so much to push up against, and he wrote so 
beautifully about it. I’d prefer to stay out of prison if I can, but I 
knew what he was talking about. You need something pushing, pushing back
 at you, and you tend to do your best work when there’s something that 
you can really, really push up against. And there has been in the States
 over the past — certainly for me, over the past 30 years, but that’s 
come to a head over the past four years now. So this record, there was 
quite a bit to write about.<br>
<br>
I want to ask a question about your singing. You have a wide range now —
 you can go from a very high falsetto to a strong and deep voice. Do you
 feel you’re still improving?<br>
<br>
[Sings falsetto:] Yes, I do! I do, I do, I do… [sings deep:] I do. 
[Laughs] For some reason when I got around 40, I was able to sing high 
all of a sudden. I’m not sure why. I used to have a harder time when I 
was younger; I have a little bit of a falsetto now that I didn’t have. 
Look at Tony Bennett: Tony Bennett’s 85 and he’s still singing. He still
 sings great. So I think you need a little bit of luck, and then you 
have to have something you’re dying to sing about.<br>
<br>
Do you feel more powerful as a musician than you would be if you were a politician?<br>
<br>
A politician? No, I could never be a politician. I just don’t have the 
skills. Everything that I’ve studied was about learning how to do my job
 as a musician better, and also trying to understand the arc of my own 
life and my family’s life — an immigrant family that came to the United 
States. I thought that there was something common in that, that if I 
understood that about me, I might be able to illuminate something about 
your life. That’s all I do. I have no interest in any other job, really,
 and I have no other skills whatsoever. So I’m hoping to continue to 
remain “powerful” as a musician [laughs] as best as I can.<br>
<br>
I know you've spoken about Clarence a bit already, but I just wanted to 
ask, with respect to the actual making of this album, did the passing of
 Clarence have any effect on that?<br>
<br>
Well, most of the record was made; 95 percent of it was made, and it 
wasn’t an E Street Band record. It was basically a solo project. So that
 didn’t immediately impact the record. This record took quite a 
different musical tilt. We were lucky to get him on “Land of Hope &amp; 
Dreams,” which was essential —really essential. When he comes up, it’s 
just a lovely moment for me.<br>
<br>
Two years ago, onstage in Glastonbury, you joined a small band from New 
Jersey called The Gaslight Anthem. Is it true that your sons make you 
listen to new bands?<br>
<br>
Yeah! You know, music is a family business. Of course, you’re always 
concerned that your kids might… I mean, it’s what Mom and Dad do, how 
cool can it be? I always say, kids wouldn’t mind coming out to see 
60,000 people boo you, but who wants to see 60,000 people cheer their 
parents? Nobody really wants to see that — I don’t care how great a kid 
you are, you don’t want to see that. Booing, that’s interesting.<br>
<br>
But he ended up with tremendous musical taste and a great musical 
appetite, and he just began, “Hey Dad, come here. Check it out.” So I 
actually heard a lot of music that way: Gaslight Anthem, Dropkick 
Murphy’s, Bad Religion, Against Me!… a lot of young musicians through 
his guidance. I’ve gone to quite a few shows with him, and we’ve had 
some great times, so it’s a nice thing to share.<br>
<br>
I want to ask about your songwriting process. Do you set aside time each
 day to write? And can you talk about how inspiration comes?<br>
<br>
I don’t set aside any time in the day. I write when the fire gets lit, 
and then I do it in spare time. I work at home, so there’s always 
something going on — somebody needs to be picked up from school, 
somebody needs to be dropped off at school. But it doesn’t take me long,
 like it used to. These songs were all written… “We Take Care of Our 
Own,” “Shackled and Drawn,” and “Rocky Ground” came along for almost a 
gospel album package I was thinking about. And then the other things 
came very quickly, one after another, as soon as I found the voice that I
 was going to use. “Easy Money,” and then the rest of the songs came 
pretty quickly, one day at a time.<br>
<br>
The main thing writing is about, a lot of it is waiting. You may wait a 
year to write something good. So you have to be pretty good at waiting. 
And I may write a lot in the meantime — I wrote 30 or 40 songs before 
these songs, just to sort of keep everything going.<br>
<br>
The inspiration thing, if that’s what you’d call it, it’s like a 
visitation. Something happens where suddenly, it’s like the planets 
aligning: the times, what’s in the air, what’s inside of you, there’s 
your craft, your skills… and suddenly they go click. And zoom. If they 
don't align, nothing happens. When it clicks — when the times, you, your
 story, the story that is alive out there at the moment, what’s going on
 in the world, your craft, your skills align like that — then bang, it 
comes out, and then good things happen. Hopefully. You sort of wait for 
that moment a lot.<br>
<br>
One last question. Should they ever start filming The Sopranos again, 
would you join Stevie in that? What would be a part for you?<br>
<br>
I have no acting skills whatsoever. This is all the acting I can do, and
 I’m doing it right now. So you see, it would be very dull. But Steve, 
on the other hand, is naturally hilarious, as he has been since the day I
 met him. He was quite a natural. I’m going to stick to music for now.<br>
<br>
Before we go, just a personal favor… can you do that falsetto again?<br>
<br>
I’m not gonna be as good as Obama. Obama can sing. Did you see that? 
[Sings falsetto:] “Let’s stay together.” I can’t do it. [Laughs]. He’s 
better than me!</div>

Live in Dublin<br>
May 20, 1993<br>
By Eamonn McCann</strong><br>
<br>
The Auguries, as they say, were not good. The night before the gig 
Channel 4 carried an edition of the Naked Sport series which focussed on
 the rising popularity of the National Basketball Association with US TV
 audiences. All down to brilliant marketing and slick presentation, 
explained a gallery of talking heads, projecting basketball as THE most 
exciting of all-American sports. <br>
<br>
The point was illustrated with a clip from a game as a troop of leggy 
cheerleaders in shiny, skimpy red-and-white-and-blue outfits swirled and
 twirled and made semaphore patterns with what I believe are called 
pom-poms as they urged fans to new heights of what was passing for 
excitement, all to the belted-out, high amplified sound of Springsteen 
singing "Born in The USA". A sharp, sardonic, beautifully-structured 
song full of vivid imagery and with a wonderfully rousing and instantly 
memorable chorus about the way Vietnam sucked decency out of American 
life used here, PLAUSIBLY, as an advertising jingle for pushing 
patriotic schlock... <br>
<br>
You could have been forgiven for believing that the industry 
automatically and inescapably grinds down all ideas into meaningless 
mush, and, really, that the sense of authenticity you've felt often from
 Springsteen has never amounted to more than a flimsy, sentimental 
fiction. And that the only sensible perspective to have on the gig was 
to check out whether, as a star, he can still cut the mustard. But what I
 found myself believing at the end of the evening was that I still 
believed in Bruce Springsteen. <br>
<br>
He can still cut it, no problem. But it's the fact that he's still 
believable which is important, more important about Springsteen than 
about any other comparable case - precisely because credibility - in the
 sense of engagement with the real world in whcih his listeners live and
 a commitment to decent values and causes within it - has always been a 
vital element of his public persona. And it's a bit difficult to keep on
 believing in that stuff recently as the notion of rock stars as the 
high priesthood of a new moral order has increasingly been revealed as a
 stupid conceit.... <br>
<br>
He came on without any build-up or preliminary fanfare and went to work 
with a mainly acoustic series from "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town", last 
year's albums which didn't set the industry on fire. A fellow from the 
Indo who arrived at the interval asked "Has he done much of the old 
stuff?" and expressed exultant relief when told, no. "Good, I haven't 
missed much then..."<br>
<br>
Well, it's all a matter of individual taste. What he'd missed was a set 
of maybe an hour from a guy with this wry, warm voice which he can use 
as a mournful drawl or a holler of joy and who brought his band on and 
gradually cranked up the volume through a sequence of songs not one of 
which is less than well-written or here given other than an apt, lovely 
performance. He ended with "My Hometown", a song to make you smile with 
pleasurable sadness and put your arms around a neighbor. I went for a 
lig-drink feeling good. <br>
<br>
In the second half he tore the place apart, sent the crowd wild with 
excitement, electrified the stadium, swept the audience up on ever 
higher waves of exuberance, dug deep and came up with emotional 
magic....chose your own clich?s and you won't get it wrong. It was a 
great SHOW as good- time as rock gets. <br>
<br>
The best songs he does are the most romantic in their portrayal of young
 blue-collar life. "The River", "Who'll Stop The Rain?", "Workin' On The
 Highway", "Born To Run", "Billy Jean", "Johnny 99", the characters 
presented commonly as victims of vast forces outside their 
comprehension, much less their control. There's something in what the 
Australian singer John Schumann has been quoted as saying, that 
Springsteen never really "puts his arse on the line", that his depiction
 of working-class struggle is "folksey" with no rough anger in it, that 
his work is too easily co-optable by the very interests he implies 
condemnation of for it to have any lasting political signficance. <br>
<br>
And some of that could be felt at the RDS, sure enough. Here, too, "Born
 in The USA", seemed to be taken as an alternative US national anthem, 
to the extent that somebody in the body of the crowd was flamboyantly 
waving a Starry-striped flag to the sway of the beat. But even to a 
cynic who has been a long time on the road it didn't seem the right 
thing or the only possible thing to feel. Even as the context subverted 
the meaning of the songs, the performance subverted the cynicism. <br>
<br>
It's not a big production. It doesn't dazzle with science or special 
effect. The video screens aren't used to any post-modern pretention but 
to give a better picture of what's happening on stage to fans who aren't
 near the front. There are no conjuring tricks, no pyrotechnics, no 
elaborate, pre-choreo-graphed routines, little use that I could detect 
even of backing tapes. <br>
<br>
He still does all that stuff running from the ramps at one wing of the 
stage to the other, reaching down, touching hands, making grinning 
eye-contact with a score of people every minute, hoisting somebody up 
from the audience to dance with him centre-stage, introducing a Living 
Legend for a brief guest-spot and smiling triumphantly to the audience, 
delighted with the coup. Simple, direct, unmediated, real. He's dressed 
not for the part but as if not playing a part, expensively so- cool, it 
goes without saying, but in a style which wouldn't cause a rumpus on 
Henry Street on a Saturday afternoon. <br>
<br>
He came on at 6:40, started into his stuff, broke for half an hour, 
ended at 10:45. The warmth of his voice, the appropriateness of the 
presentation, the energy and job communicated from the stage, the 
accessibility of it all, the deeply satisfying pleasure of sensing 
contact with the PERSON on stage - therein lay the beauty of the 
experience, and the beauty transcended all. He's credible because he's a
 credible PERFORMER. <br>
<br>
Music doesn't have to have lasting political significance, and maybe 
can't. I was reminded of the story of Nat Hentoff chastising Louis 
Armstrong for singing "It;s a Wonderful World" when "You know that it's 
NOT a wonderful world, Louis", and Sachmo replied "Yeah, but it's a 
wonderful tune, and we need that". Or even more aptly, of the sentiment 
attributed by Gorky to Lenin after listening to Beethoven's 
"Apassionata". "Astonishing, superhuman music. What miracles people can 
do! But I can't listen often to music, it affects my nerves, makes we 
want to say kind stupidities and pat the heads of people who, living in 
this dirty hell, can create such beauty". <br>
<br>
Springsteen ended with "It's Alright", which it is. And so is he.</div>

Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born September 23, 1949), nicknamed 
"The Boss", is an American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist 
who records and tours with the E Street Band. Springsteen is widely 
known for his brand of heartland rock, poetic lyrics, Americana 
sentiments centered on his native New Jersey and his lengthy and 
energetic stage performances, with concerts from the 1970s to the 
present decade running up to an uninterrupted 250 minutes in length.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's recordings have included both commercially accessible rock
 albums and more somber folk-oriented works. His most successful studio 
albums, Born in the U.S.A. and Born to Run, showcase a talent for 
finding grandeur in the struggles of daily American life; he has sold 
more than 65 million albums in the United States and more than 120 
million worldwide and he has earned numerous awards for his work, 
including 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes and an Academy Award as 
well as being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999. In 
2004, Rolling Stone ranked him as the 23rd Greatest Artist of all time, 
the 96th Greatest Guitarist of all time on their latest list and the 
36th Greatest Singer of all time in 2008.<br>
<br>
Early life<br>
<br>
Springsteen was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, and spent his childhood
 and high school years in Freehold Borough. He lived on South Street in 
Freehold Borough and attended Freehold Borough High School. His father, 
Douglas Frederick Springsteen, was of Dutch and Irish ancestry (his 
surname in Dutch means jumping stone) and worked as a bus driver, among 
other vocations, although he was mostly unemployed, and according to 
Springsteen's account, his mother was the main breadwinner. His mother, 
Adele Ann (née Zerilli), was a legal secretary and was of Italian 
ancestry.[6] His maternal grandfather was born in Vico Equense, a city 
near Naples. He has two younger sisters, Virginia and Pamela. Pamela had
 a brief film career, but left acting to pursue still photography 
full-time; she took photos for his Human Touch, Lucky Town and The Ghost
 of Tom Joad albums.<br>
<br>
Raised a Roman Catholic, Springsteen attended the St. Rose of Lima 
Catholic school in Freehold Borough, where he was at odds with the nuns 
and rejected the strictures imposed upon him, even though some of his 
later music reflects a Catholic ethos and included a few 
rock-influenced, traditional Irish-Catholic hymns. <br>
<br>
In a 2012 interview, he explained that it was his Catholic upbringing 
rather than political ideology that most influenced his music. He noted 
in the interview that his faith had given him a "very active spiritual 
life," although he joked that this "made it very difficult sexually." He
 added: "Once a Catholic, always a Catholic."<br>
<br>
In ninth grade, he transferred to the public Freehold Regional High 
School, but did not fit in there either. Former teachers have said he 
was a "loner, who wanted nothing more than to play his guitar." He 
completed high school, but felt so uncomfortable that he skipped his own
 graduation ceremony. He briefly attended Ocean County College, but 
dropped out.<br>
<br>
Career history<br>
<br>
1962–1972: Early years<br>
<br>
Springsteen had been inspired to take up music at the age of seven after
 seeing Elvis Presley on The Ed Sullivan Show. At 13, his mother bought 
him his first guitar for $18; later, she took out a loan to buy the 
16-year-old Springsteen a $60 Kent guitar, as he later memorialized in 
his song "The Wish".<br>
<br>
In 1965, he went to the house of Tex and Marion Vinyard, who sponsored 
young bands in town. They helped him become the lead guitarist and 
subsequently the lead singer of The Castiles. The Castiles recorded two 
original songs at a public recording studio in Brick Township and played
 a variety of venues, including Cafe Wha? in Greenwich Village. Marion 
Vinyard said that she believed the young Springsteen when he promised he
 would make it big.<br>
<br>
Called for induction when he was 18, Springsteen failed his physical 
examination and did not serve in Vietnam. In an interview in Rolling 
Stone magazine in 1984, he said, "When I got on the bus to go take my 
physical, I thought one thing: I ain't goin'." He had suffered a 
concussion in a motorcycle accident when he was 17, and this together 
with his "crazy" behavior at induction and not taking the tests, was 
enough to get him a 4F.<br>
<br>
In the late 1960s, Springsteen performed briefly in a power trio known 
as Earth, playing in clubs in New Jersey. Springsteen acquired the 
nickname "The Boss" during this period as when he played club gigs with a
 band he took on the task of collecting the band's nightly pay and 
distributing it amongst his bandmates. Springsteen is not fond of this 
nickname, due to his dislike of bosses, but seems to have since given it
 a tacit acceptance. Previously he had the nickname "Doctor".<br>
<br>
From 1969 through early 1971, Springsteen performed with Steel Mill, 
which also featured Danny Federici, Vini Lopez, Vinnie Roslin and later 
Steve Van Zandt and Robbin Thompson. They went on to play the 
mid-Atlantic college circuit, and also briefly in California. In January
 1970 well-known San Francisco Examiner music critic Philip Elwood gave 
Springsteen credibility in his glowing assessment of Steel Mill: "I have
 never been so overwhelmed by totally unknown talent." Elwood went on to
 praise their "cohesive musicality" and, in particular, singled out 
Springsteen as "a most impressive composer." During this time 
Springsteen also performed regularly at small clubs in Canton, 
Massachusetts; Richmond, Virginia; and Asbury Park and other points 
along the Jersey Shore, quickly gathering a cult following.<br>
<br>
Other acts followed over the next two years, as Springsteen sought to 
shape a unique and genuine musical and lyrical style: Dr. Zoom &amp; the
 Sonic Boom (early–mid 1971), Sundance Blues Band (mid 1971), and The 
Bruce Springsteen Band (mid 1971–mid 1972). With the addition of pianist
 David Sancious, the core of what would later become the E Street Band 
was formed, with occasional temporary additions such as horn sections, 
"The Zoomettes" (a group of female backing vocalists for "Dr. Zoom") and
 Southside Johnny Lyon on harmonica. Musical genres explored included 
blues, R&amp;B, jazz, church music, early rock 'n' roll, and soul. His 
prolific songwriting ability, with "More words in some individual songs 
than other artists had in whole albums," as his future record label 
would describe it in early publicity campaigns, brought his skill to the
 attention of several people who were about to change his life: new 
managers Mike Appel and Jim Cretecos, and Columbia Records talent scout 
John Hammond, who, under Appel's pressure, auditioned Springsteen in May
 1972.<br>
Even after Springsteen gained international acclaim, his New Jersey 
roots showed through in his music, and he often praised "the great state
 of New Jersey" in his live shows. Drawing on his extensive local 
appeal, he routinely sold out consecutive nights in major New Jersey, 
Philadelphia and New York venues. He also made many surprise appearances
 at The Stone Pony and other shore nightclubs over the years, becoming 
the foremost exponent of the Jersey Shore sound.<br>
<br>
1972–1974: Initial struggle for success<br>
<br>
Springsteen signed a record deal with Columbia Records in 1972, with the
 help of John Hammond, who had signed Bob Dylan to the same label a 
decade earlier. Springsteen brought many of his New Jersey–based 
colleagues into the studio with him, thus forming the E Street Band 
(although it would not be formally named as such for several more 
years). His debut album, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., released in 
January 1973, established him as a critical favorite, though sales were 
slow. Because of Springsteen's lyrical poeticism and folk rock–rooted 
music exemplified on tracks like "Blinded by the Light", (which would 
later be a hit for Manfred Mann and go to No. 1, making it the only time
 Springsteen had a No. 1 single as a songwriter), and "For You", as well
 as the Columbia and Hammond connections, critics initially compared 
Springsteen to Bob Dylan. "He sings with a freshness and urgency I 
haven't heard since I was rocked by 'Like a Rolling Stone, '" wrote 
Crawdaddy magazine editor Peter Knobler in Springsteen's first 
interview/profile, in March 1973. Crawdaddy discovered Springsteen in 
the rock press and was his earliest champion.(Springsteen and the E 
Street Band acknowledged by giving a private performance at the 
Crawdaddy 10th Anniversary Party in New York City in June 1976.) <br>
<br>
<br>
In September 1973 his second album, The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E 
Street Shuffle, was released, again to critical acclaim but no 
commercial success. Springsteen's songs became grander in form and 
scope, with the E Street Band providing a less folky, more R&amp;B vibe 
and the lyrics often romanticized teenage street life. "4th of July, 
Asbury Park (Sandy)" and "Incident on 57th Street" would become fan 
favorites, and the long, rousing "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" continues
 to rank among Springsteen's most beloved concert numbers.<br>
<br>
In the May 22, 1974, issue of Boston's The Real Paper, music critic Jon 
Landau wrote after seeing a performance at the Harvard Square Theater, 
"I saw rock and roll's future, and its name is Bruce Springsteen. And on
 a night when I needed to feel young, he made me feel like I was hearing
 music for the very first time." Landau subsequently became 
Springsteen's manager and producer, helping to finish the epic new 
album, Born to Run. Given an enormous budget in a last-ditch effort at a
 commercially viable record, Springsteen became bogged down in the 
recording process while striving for a wall of sound production. But, 
fed by the release of an early mix of "Born to Run" to progressive rock 
radio, anticipation built toward the album's release. All in all the 
album took more than 14 months to record, with six months alone spent on
 the song "Born To Run". During this time Springsteen battled with anger
 and frustration over the album, saying he heard "sounds in [his] head" 
that he could not explain to the others in the studio. It was during 
these recording sessions that "Miami" Steve Van Zandt would stumble into
 the studio just in time to help Springsteen organize the horn section 
on "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" (it is his only written contribution to the
 album), and eventually led to his joining the E Street Band.[citation 
needed] Van Zandt had been a long-time friend of Springsteen, as well as
 a collaborator on earlier musical projects, and understood where he was
 coming from, which helped him to translate some of the sounds 
Springsteen was hearing. Still, by the end of the grueling recording 
sessions, Springsteen was not satisfied, and, upon first hearing the 
finished album, threw the record into the alley and told Jon Landau he 
would rather just cut the album live at The Bottom Line, a place he 
often played.<br>
<br>
1975–1983: Breakthrough<br>
<br>
On August 13, 1975, Springsteen and the E Street Band began a 
five-night, 10-show stand at New York's Bottom Line club. The engagement
 attracted major media attention, was broadcast live on WNEW-FM, and 
convinced many skeptics that Springsteen was for real. (Decades later, 
Rolling Stone magazine would name the stand as one of the 50 Moments 
That Changed Rock and Roll.) Oklahoma City rock radio station WKY, in 
association with Carson Attractions, staged an experimental promotional 
event that resulted in a sold out house at the (6000 seat) Civic Center 
Music Hall. With the release of Born to Run on August 25, 1975, 
Springsteen finally found success. The album peaked at No. 3 on the 
Billboard 200, and while reception at U.S. top 40 radio outlets for the 
album's two singles were not overwhelming ("Born to Run" reached a 
modest No. 23 on the Billboard charts, and "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" 
only hit #83), almost every track on the album received album-oriented 
rock airplay, especially "Born to Run", "Thunder Road", "Tenth Avenue 
Freeze-Out" and "Jungleland", all of which remain perennial favorites on
 many classic rock stations. With its panoramic imagery, thundering 
production and desperate optimism, Born to Run is considered by some 
fans to be among the best rock and roll albums of all time and 
Springsteen's finest work. Springsteen appeared on the covers of both 
Time and Newsweek in the same week, on October 27 of that year. So great
 did the wave of publicity become that Springsteen eventually rebelled 
against it during his first venture overseas, tearing down promotional 
posters before a concert appearance in London.<br>
<br>
A legal battle with former manager Mike Appel kept Springsteen out of 
the studio for nearly a year, during which time he kept the E Street 
Band together through extensive touring across the U.S. Despite the 
optimistic fervor with which he often performed, his new songs had taken
 a more somber tone than much of his previous work. Reaching settlement 
with Appel in 1977, Springsteen returned to the studio, and the 
subsequent sessions produced Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978). 
Musically, this album was a turning point in Springsteen's career. Gone 
were the raw, rapid-fire lyrics, outsized characters and long, 
multi-part musical compositions of the first two albums; now the songs 
were leaner and more carefully drawn and began to reflect Springsteen's 
growing intellectual and political awareness. The cross-country 1978 
tour to promote the album would become legendary for the intensity and 
length of its shows.<br>
<br>
By the late 1970s, Bruce Springsteen had earned a reputation in the pop 
world as a songwriter whose material could provide hits for other bands.
 Manfred Mann's Earth Band had achieved a U.S. No. 1 pop hit with a 
heavily rearranged version of Greetings' "Blinded by the Light" in early
 1977. Patti Smith reached No. 13 with her take on Springsteen's 
unreleased "Because the Night" (with revised lyrics by Smith) in 1978, 
while The Pointer Sisters hit No. 2 in 1979 with Springsteen's also 
unreleased "Fire".<br>
<br>
In September 1979, Springsteen and the E Street Band joined the 
Musicians United for Safe Energy anti-nuclear power collective at 
Madison Square Garden for two nights, playing an abbreviated set while 
premiering two songs from his upcoming album. The subsequent No Nukes 
live album, as well as the following summer's No Nukes documentary film,
 represented the first official recordings and footage of Springsteen's 
fabled live act, as well as Springsteen's first tentative dip into 
political involvement.<br>
<br>
Springsteen continued to consolidate his thematic focus on working-class
 life with the 20-song double album The River in 1980, which included an
 intentionally paradoxical range of material from good-time party 
rockers to emotionally intense ballads, and finally yielded his first 
hit Top Ten single as a performer, "Hungry Heart". This album marked a 
shift in Springsteen's music toward a pop-rock sound that was all but 
missing from any of his earlier work. This is apparent in the stylistic 
adoption of certain eighties pop-rock hallmarks like the 
reverberating-tenor drums, very basic percussion/guitar and repetitive 
lyrics apparent in many of the tracks. The title song pointed to 
Springsteen's intellectual direction, while a couple of the lesser-known
 tracks presaged his musical direction. The album sold well, becoming 
his first topper on the Billboard Pop Albums chart, and a long tour in 
1980 and 1981 followed, featuring Springsteen's first extended playing 
of Europe and ending with a series of multi-night arena stands in major 
cities in the U.S.<br>
<br>
The River was followed in 1982 by the stark solo acoustic Nebraska. 
Recording sessions had been held to expand on a demo tape Springsteen 
had made at his home on a simple, low-tech four-track tape deck. However
 during the recording process Springsteen and producer Landau realized 
the songs worked better as solo acoustic numbers than full band 
renditions and the original demo tape was released as the album. 
Although the recordings of the E Street Band were shelved, other songs 
from these sessions would later be released, including "Born in the 
U.S.A." and "Glory Days". According to the Marsh biographies, 
Springsteen was in a depressed state when he wrote this material, and 
the result is a brutal depiction of American life. While Nebraska did 
not sell as well as Springsteen's three previous albums, it garnered 
widespread critical praise (including being named "Album of the Year" by
 Rolling Stone magazine's critics) and influenced later significant 
works by other major artists, including U2's album The Joshua Tree. It 
helped inspire the musical genre known as lo-fi music, becoming a cult 
favorite among indie-rockers. Springsteen did not tour in conjunction 
with Nebraska's release.<br>
<br>
1984–1991: Commercial and popular phenomenon<br>
<br>
Springsteen probably is best known for his album Born in the U.S.A. 
(1984), which sold 15 million copies in the U.S. and became one of the 
best-selling albums of all time, with seven singles hitting the Top 10. 
The title track was a bitter commentary on the treatment of Vietnam 
veterans, some of whom were Springsteen's friends and bandmates. The 
lyrics in the verses were entirely unambiguous when listened to, but the
 anthemic music and the title of the song made it hard for many, from 
politicians to the common person, to get the lyrics—except those in the 
chorus, which could be read many ways. The song was widely 
misinterpreted as jingoistic, and in connection with the 1984 
presidential campaign became the subject of considerable folklore. 
Springsteen also turned down several million dollars offered by the 
Chrysler Corporation to use the song in a car commercial. In later 
years, to eliminate the bombast and make the song's original meaning 
more explicitly clear, Springsteen performed the song accompanied only 
by acoustic guitar, thus returning to how the song was originally 
conceived. The original acoustic version of the song, recorded in 1982 
during the Nebraska sessions appeared on the 1998 archival release 
Tracks. "Dancing in the Dark" was the biggest of seven hit singles from 
Born in the U.S.A., peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard music charts. The 
music video for the song featured a young Courteney Cox dancing on stage
 with Springsteen, an appearance which helped kickstart the actress's 
career. The song "Cover Me" was written by Springsteen for Donna Summer,
 but his record company persuaded him to keep it for the new album. A 
big fan of Summer's work, Springsteen wrote another song for her, 
"Protection". Videos for the album were made by noted film directors 
Brian De Palma and John Sayles. Springsteen was featured on the "We Are 
the World" song and album in 1985. His live single "Trapped" from that 
album received moderate airplay on U.S. Top 40 stations as well as 
reaching No. 1 on the Billboard Top Rock Tracks chart. During the Born 
in the U.S.A. Tour, Springsteen met actress Julianne Phillips, whom he 
would marry in 1985.<br>
<br>
The Born in the U.S.A. period represented the height of Springsteen's 
visibility in popular culture and the broadest audience demographic he 
would ever reach (aided by the release of Arthur Baker's dance mixes of 
three of the singles). Live/1975–85, a five-record box set (also on 
three cassettes or three CDs), was released near the end of 1986 and 
became the first box set to debut at No. 1 on the U.S. album charts. It 
is one of the most commercially successful live albums of all time, 
ultimately selling 13 million units in the U.S. Live/1975–85 summed up 
Springsteen's career to that point and displayed some of the elements 
that made his shows so powerful to his fans: the switching from mournful
 dirges to party rockers and back; the communal sense of purpose between
 artist and audience; the long, intense spoken passages before songs, 
including those describing Springsteen's difficult relationship with his
 father; and the instrumental prowess of the E Street Band, such as in 
the long coda to "Racing in the Street". Despite its popularity, some 
fans and critics felt the album's song selection could have been better.
 Springsteen concerts are the subjects of frequent bootleg recording and
 trading among fans.<br>
<br>
During the 1980s, several Springsteen fanzines were launched, including 
Backstreets magazine, which started in Seattle and continues today as a 
glossy publication, now in communication with Springsteen's management 
and official website.<br>
After this commercial peak, Springsteen released the much more sedate 
and contemplative Tunnel of Love album (1987), a mature reflection on 
the many faces of love found, lost and squandered, which only 
selectively used the E Street Band. It presaged the breakup of his 
marriage to Julianne Phillips and described some of his unhappinesses in
 the relationship. Reflecting the challenges of love in "Brilliant 
Disguise", Springsteen sang:<br>
<br>
“	I heard somebody call your name from underneath our willow/I saw 
something tucked in shame underneath your pillow/ Well I've tried so 
hard baby, but I just can't see/ What a woman like you is doing with me.
	”<br>
<br>
The subsequent Tunnel of Love Express Tour shook up fans with changes to
 the stage layout, favorites dropped from the set list, and horn-based 
arrangements. During the European leg in 1988, Springsteen's 
relationship with backup singer Patti Scialfa became public and Phillips
 and Springsteen filed for divorce in 1988.[25] Later in 1988, 
Springsteen headlined the worldwide Human Rights Now! tour for Amnesty 
International. In late 1989 he dissolved the E Street Band, and he and 
Scialfa relocated to California, marrying in 1991.<br>
<br>
1992–1998: Artistic and commercial ups and downs<br>
<br>
In 1992, after risking fan accusations of "going Hollywood" by moving to
 Los Angeles (a radical move for someone so linked to the blue-collar 
life of the Jersey Shore) and working with session musicians, 
Springsteen released two albums at once. Human Touch and Lucky Town were
 even more introspective than any of his previous work and displayed a 
newly revealed confidence. As opposed to his first two albums, which 
dreamed of happiness, and his next four, which showed him growing to 
fear it, at points during the Lucky Town album, Springsteen actually 
claims happiness for himself.<br>
<br>
An electric band appearance on the acoustic MTV Unplugged television 
program (later released as In Concert/MTV Plugged) was poorly received 
and further cemented fan dissatisfaction. Springsteen seemed to realize 
this a few years hence when he spoke humorously of his late father 
during his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame acceptance speech:<br>
<br>
“	I've gotta thank him because – what would I conceivably have written 
about without him? I mean, you can imagine that if everything had gone 
great between us, we would have had disaster. I would have written just 
happy songs – and I tried it in the early '90s and it didn't work; the 
public didn't like it.”<br>
<br>
A multiple Grammy Award winner, Springsteen also won an Academy Award in
 1994 for his song "Streets of Philadelphia", which appeared on the 
soundtrack to the film Philadelphia. The music video for the song shows 
Springsteen's actual vocal performance, recorded using a hidden 
microphone, to a prerecorded instrumental track. This technique was 
developed on the "Brilliant Disguise" video.<br>
<br>
In 1995, after temporarily re-organizing the E Street Band for a few new
 songs recorded for his first Greatest Hits album (a recording session 
that was chronicled in the documentary Blood Brothers), he released his 
second (mostly) solo guitar album, The Ghost of Tom Joad, inspired by 
John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath and by Journey to Nowhere: The Saga
 of the New Underclass, a book by Pulitzer Prize-winners author Dale 
Maharidge and photographer Michael Williamson. This was generally less 
well-received than the similar Nebraska, due to the minimal melody, 
twangy vocals, and political nature of most of the songs, although some 
praised it for giving voice to immigrants and others who rarely have one
 in American culture. The lengthy, worldwide, small-venue solo acoustic 
Ghost of Tom Joad Tour that followed successfully featured many of his 
older songs in drastically reshaped acoustic form, although Springsteen 
had to explicitly remind his audiences to be quiet and not to clap 
during the performances.<br>
<br>
Following the tour, Springsteen moved back to New Jersey with his 
family.  In 1998, Springsteen released the sprawling, four-disc box set 
of out-takes, Tracks. Subsequently, Springsteen would acknowledge that 
the 1990s were a "lost period" for him: "I didn't do a lot of work. Some
 people would say I didn't do my best work."<br>
<br>
1999–2007: Return to success<br>
<br>
In 1999, Springsteen and the E Street Band officially came together 
again and went on the extensive Reunion Tour, lasting over a year. 
Highlights included a record sold-out, 15-show run at Continental 
Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey and a ten-night, sold-out 
engagement at New York City's Madison Square Garden which ended the 
tour. The final two shows were recorded for an HBO Concert, with 
corresponding DVD and album releases as Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E 
Street Band: Live in New York City. A new song, "American Skin (41 
Shots)", about the police shooting of Amadou Diallo which was played at 
these shows proved controversial.<br>
<br>
In November 2000, Springsteen filed legal action against Jeff Burgar 
which accused him of registering the domain brucespringsteen.com (along 
with several other celebrity domains) in bad faith to funnel web users 
to his Celebrity 1000 portal site. Once the legal complaint was filed, 
Burgar pointed the domain to a Springsteen biography and message board. 
In February 2001, Springsteen lost his dispute with Burgar. A WIPO panel
 ruled 2 to 1 in favor of Burgar.<br>
<br>
In 2002, Springsteen released his first studio effort with the full band
 in 18 years, The Rising, produced by Brendan O'Brien. The album, mostly
 a reflection on the September 11 attacks, was a critical and popular 
success. (Many of the songs were influenced by phone conversations 
Springsteen had with family members of victims of the attacks who in 
their obituaries had mentioned how his music touched their lives.) The 
title track gained airplay in several radio formats, and the record 
became Springsteen's best-selling album of new material in 15 years. 
Kicked off by an early-morning Asbury Park appearance on The Today Show,
 The Rising Tour commenced, barnstorming through a series of 
single-night arena stands in the U.S. and Europe to promote the album in
 2002, then returning for large-scale, multiple-night stadium shows in 
2003. <br>
<br>
While Springsteen had maintained a loyal hardcore fan base everywhere 
(and particularly in Europe), his general popularity had dipped over the
 years in some southern and midwestern regions of the U.S, because of 
his vocal endorsement of leftist, liberal politics. But it was still 
strong in Europe and along the U.S. coasts, and he played an 
unprecedented 10 nights in Giants Stadium in New Jersey, a 
ticket-selling feat to which no other musical act has come close.  
During these shows Springsteen thanked those fans who were attending 
multiple shows and those who were coming from long distances or another 
country; the advent of robust Bruce-oriented online communities had made
 such practices more common. The Rising Tour came to a final conclusion 
with three nights in Shea Stadium, highlighted by renewed controversy 
over "American Skin" and a guest appearance by Bob Dylan.<br>
<br>
During the early 2000s, Springsteen became a visible advocate for the 
revitalization of Asbury Park, and played an annual series of winter 
holiday concerts there to benefit various local businesses, 
organizations, and causes. These shows were explicitly intended for the 
devoted fans, featuring numbers such as the E Street Shuffle outtake 
"Thundercrack", a rollicking group-participation song that would mystify
 casual Springsteen fans. He also frequently rehearses for tours in 
Asbury Park; some of his most devoted followers even go so far as to 
stand outside the building to hear what fragments they can of the 
upcoming shows. The song "My City of Ruins" was originally written about
 Asbury Park, in honor of the attempts to revitalize the city. Looking 
for an appropriate song for The Concert for New York City, he selected 
"My City of Ruins", which was immediately recognized as an emotional 
highlight of the concert, with its gospel themes and its heartfelt 
exhortations to "Rise up!" The song became associated with post-9/11 New
 York, and he chose it to close The Rising album and as an encore on the
 subsequent tour.<br>
<br>
At the Grammy Awards of 2003, Springsteen performed The Clash's "London 
Calling" along with Elvis Costello, Dave Grohl, and E Street Band member
 Steven Van Zandt and No Doubt's bassist, Tony Kanal, in tribute to Joe 
Strummer; Springsteen and the Clash had once been considered 
multiple-album-dueling rivals at the time of the double The River and 
the triple Sandinista!. In 2004, Springsteen and the E Street Band 
participated in the Vote for Change tour, along with John Mellencamp, 
John Fogerty, the Dixie Chicks, Pearl Jam, R.E.M., Bright Eyes, the Dave
 Matthews Band, Jackson Browne, and other musicians. All concerts were 
to be held in swing states, to benefit the progressive political 
organization group America Coming Together and to encourage people to 
register and vote. A finale was held in Washington, D.C., bringing many 
of the artists together. Several days later, Springsteen held one more 
such concert in New Jersey, when polls showed that state surprisingly 
close. While in past years Springsteen had played benefits for causes in
 which he believed – against nuclear energy, for Vietnam veterans, 
Amnesty International, and the Christic Institute – he had always 
refrained from explicitly endorsing candidates for political office 
(indeed he had rejected the efforts of Walter Mondale to attract an 
endorsement during the 1984 Reagan "Born in the U.S.A." flap). This new 
stance led to criticism and praise from the expected partisan sources. 
Springsteen's "No Surrender" became the main campaign theme song for 
John Kerry's unsuccessful presidential campaign; in the last days of the
 campaign, he performed acoustic versions of the song and some of his 
other old songs at Kerry rallies.<br>
<br>
Devils &amp; Dust was released on April 26, 2005, and was recorded 
without the E Street Band. It is a low-key, mostly acoustic album, in 
the same vein as Nebraska and The Ghost of Tom Joad although with a 
little more instrumentation. Some of the material was written almost 10 
years earlier during, or shortly after, the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, a 
couple of them being performed then but never released. The title track 
concerns an ordinary soldier's feelings and fears during the Iraq War. 
Starbucks rejected a co-branding deal for the album, due in part to some
 sexually explicit content but also because of Springsteen's 
anti-corporate politics. The album entered the album charts at No. 1 in 
10 countries (United States, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, 
Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Ireland). 
Springsteen began the solo Devils &amp; Dust Tour at the same time as 
the album's release, playing both small and large venues. Attendance was
 disappointing in a few regions, and everywhere (other than in Europe) 
tickets were easier to get than in the past. Unlike his mid-1990s solo 
tour, he performed on piano, electric piano, pump organ, autoharp, 
ukulele, banjo, electric guitar, and stomping board, as well as acoustic
 guitar and harmonica, adding variety to the solo sound. (Offstage 
synthesizer, guitar, and percussion were also used for some songs.) 
Unearthly renditions of "Reason to Believe", "The Promised Land", and 
Suicide's "Dream Baby Dream" jolted audiences to attention, while 
rarities, frequent set list changes, and a willingness to keep trying 
even through audible piano mistakes kept most of his loyal audiences 
happy.<br>
<br>
In November 2005, Sirius Satellite Radio started a 24-hour, 
seven-day-a-week radio station on Channel 10 called E Street Radio. This
 channel featured commercial-free Bruce Springsteen music, including 
rare tracks, interviews, and daily concerts of Bruce Springsteen &amp; 
the E Street Band recorded throughout their career.<br>
<br>
<br>
In April 2006, Springsteen released We Shall Overcome: The Seeger 
Sessions, an American roots music project focused around a big folk 
sound treatment of 15 songs popularized by the radical musical activism 
of Pete Seeger. It was recorded with a large ensemble of musicians 
including only Patti Scialfa, Soozie Tyrell, and The Miami Horns from 
past efforts. In contrast to previous albums, this was recorded in only 
three one-day sessions, and frequently one can hear Springsteen calling 
out key changes live as the band explores its way through the tracks. 
The Bruce Springsteen with The Seeger Sessions Band Tour began the same 
month, featuring the 18-strong ensemble of musicians dubbed The Seeger 
Sessions Band (and later shortened to The Sessions Band). Seeger 
Sessions material was heavily featured, as well as a handful of (usually
 drastically rearranged) Springsteen numbers. The tour proved very 
popular in Europe, selling out everywhere and receiving some excellent 
reviews, but newspapers reported that a number of U.S. shows suffered 
from sparse attendance.  By the end of 2006, the Seeger Sessions tour 
toured Europe twice and toured America for only a short span. Bruce 
Springsteen with The Sessions Band: Live in Dublin, containing 
selections from three nights of November 2006 shows at The Point Theatre
 in Dublin, Ireland, was released the following June.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's next album, titled Magic, was released on October 2, 2007.
 Recorded with the E Street Band, it featured 10 new Springsteen songs 
plus "Long Walk Home", performed once with the Sessions band, and a 
hidden track (the first included on a Springsteen studio release), 
"Terry's Song", a tribute to Springsteen's long-time assistant Terry 
Magovern, who died on July 30, 2007. The first single, "Radio Nowhere", 
was made available for a free download on August 28. On October 7, Magic
 debuted at No. 1 in Ireland and the UK. Greatest Hits reentered the 
Irish charts at No. 57, and Live in Dublin almost cracked the top 20 in 
Norway again. Sirius Satellite Radio also restarted E Street Radio on 
Channel 10 on September 27, 2007, in anticipation of Magic. Radio 
conglomerate Clear Channel Communications was alleged to have sent an 
edict to its classic rock stations to not play any songs from the new 
album, while continuing to play older Springsteen material. However, 
Clear Channel Adult Alternative (or "AAA") station KBCO did play tracks 
from the album, undermining the allegations of a corporate blackout.<br>
<br>
The Springsteen and E Street Band Magic Tour began at the Hartford Civic
 Center with the album's release and continued through North America and
 Europe. Springsteen and the band performed liveon NBC's Today Show in 
advance of the opener. Longtime E Street Band organist Danny Federici 
left the tour in November 2007 to pursue treatment for melanoma from 
which he would die in 2008. <br>
<br>
2008–present: activities<br>
<br>
Springsteen supported Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, 
announcing his endorsement in April 2008 and going on to appear at 
several Obama rallies as well as performing several solo acoustic 
performances in support of Obama's campaign throughout 2008,  
culminating with a November 2 rally where he debuted "Working on a 
Dream" in a duet with Scialfa.  At an Ohio rally, Springsteen discussed 
the importance of "truth, transparency and integrity in government, the 
right of every American to have a job, a living wage, to be educated in a
 decent school, and a life filled with the dignity of work, the promise 
and the sanctity of home...But today those freedoms have been damaged 
and curtailed by eight years of a thoughtless, reckless and morally 
adrift administration." <br>
<br>
Following Obama's electoral victory on November 4, Springsteen's song 
"The Rising" was the first song played over the loudspeakers after 
Obama's victory speech in Chicago's Grant Park. Springsteen was the 
musical opener for the Obama Inaugural Celebration on January 18, 2009, 
which was attended by over 400,000. He performed "The Rising" with an 
all-female choir. Later he performed Woody Guthrie's "This Land Is Your 
Land" with Pete Seeger.<br>
<br>
On June 18, 2008, Springsteen appeared live from Europe at the Tim 
Russert tribute at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., to play one 
of Russert's favorite songs, "Thunder Road". Springsteen dedicated the 
song to Russert, who was "one of Springsteen's biggest fans."<br>
<br>
On January 11, 2009, Springsteen won the Golden Globe Award for Best 
Song for "The Wrestler", from the Mickey Rourke film by the same name. 
After receiving a heartfelt letter from Rourke, Springsteen supplied the
 song for the film for free. <br>
Springsteen performed at the halftime show at Super Bowl XLIII on 
February 1, 2009, agreeing to do it after many previous offers. A few 
days before the game, Springsteen gave a rare press conference, where he
 promised a "twelve-minute party."  His 12:45 set, with the E Street 
Band and the Miami Horns, included abbreviated renditions of "Tenth 
Avenue Freeze-Out"", "Born to Run", "Working on a Dream", and "Glory 
Days", the latter complete with football references. The set of 
appearances and promotional activities led Springsteen to say, "This has
 probably been the busiest month of my life."<br>
<br>
Springsteen's Working on a Dream album was released in late January 
2009[52] and the supporting Working on a Dream Tour ran from April 2009 
until November 2009. The tour featured few songs from the new album, 
with instead set lists dominated by classics and selections reflecting 
the ongoing late-2000s recession. The tour also featured Springsteen 
playing songs requested by audience members holding up signs as on the 
final stages of the Magic Tour. Drummer Max Weinberg was replaced for 
some shows by his 18-year-old son Jay Weinberg, so that the former could
 serve his role as bandleader on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien.  
During this tour, Springsteen and the band made their first real foray 
in the world of music festivals, headlining nights at the Pinkpop 
Festival in the Netherlands, Festival des Vieilles Charrues in France, 
the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the United States and the Glastonbury 
Festival in the UK and Hard Rock Calling in the UK. Several shows on the
 tour featured full album presentations of Born to Run, Darkness on the 
Edge of Town, or Born in the U.S.A.  The band performed a stretch of 
five final shows at his homestate Giants Stadium, opening with a new 
song highlighting the historic stadium, and his Jersey roots, named 
"Wrecking Ball". The tour ended as scheduled in Buffalo, NY in November 
2009 amid speculation that it was the last performance ever by the E 
Street Band, but during the show Springsteen said it was goodbye “for a 
little while.”  A DVD from the Working on a Dream Tour entitled London 
Calling: Live in Hyde Park was released in 2010.<br>
<br>
In addition to his own touring, Springsteen made a number of appearances
 at tribute and benefit concerts during 2009, including The Clearwater 
Concert (a celebration of Pete Seeger's 90th birthday), the Rock and 
Roll Hall of Fame's 25th anniversary benefit concert, and a benefit for 
the advocacy group Autism Speaks at Carnegie Hall.  On January 22, 2010,
 he joined many well-known artists to perform on Hope for Haiti Now: A 
Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief,  organized by George Clooney to 
raise money to help the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake.<br>
<br>
In 2009, Springsteen performed in The People Speak, a documentary 
feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters,
 diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian Howard 
Zinn's A People's History of the United States.<br>
<br>
Springsteen was among the recipients of the Kennedy Center Honors, an 
annual award to figures from the world of arts for their contribution to
 American culture, in December 2009.  President Obama gave a speech in 
which he talked about how Springsteen has incorporated the life of 
regular Americans in his expansive pallette of songs and how his 
concerts are beyond the typical rock-and-roll concerts, how, apart from 
being high-energy concerts, they are "communions". He ended the remark 
"while I am the president, he is The Boss". Tributes were paid by 
several well-known celebrities including Jon Stewart (who described 
Springsteen's "unprecedented combination of lyrical eloquence, musical 
mastery and sheer unbridled, unadulterated joy"). A musical tribute 
featured John Mellencamp, Ben Harper, and Jennifer Nettles, Melissa 
Etheridge, Eddie Vedder, and Sting.<br>
<br>
The 2000s ended with Springsteen being named one of eight Artists of the
 Decade by Rolling Stone magazine and with Springsteen's tours ranking 
him fourth among artists in total concert grosses for the decade.  His 
2010 tour included venues in the UK and Ireland.<br>
<br>
In September 2010, a documentary about the making of his 1978 album 
Darkness on The Edge of Town was premiered at the Toronto International 
Film Festival. The film, The Promise: The Making of Darkness on the Edge
 of Town, was included in a box set reissue of the album, entitled The 
Promise: The Darkness on the Edge of Town Story, released in November 
2010. Also airing on HBO, the documentary explored Springsteen's making 
of the acclaimed album, and his role in the production and development 
of the tracks.<br>
<br>
Springsteen has finished his next studio album with Ron Aniello,  who 
also co-produced the 2007 album Play It As It Lays, by Springsteen's 
wife, Patti Scialfa. Ron Aniello also produced "Children's Song" early 
in 2011, a duet with Springsteen and Scialfa, which was done for a 
charity project.<br>
<br>
Clarence Clemons, the E Street Band's saxophonist since 1972, died on 
June 18, 2011, of complications from a stroke. "Clarence lived a 
wonderful life," Springsteen said in a statement. "He carried within him
 a love of people that made them love him. He created a wondrous and 
extended family. He loved the saxophone, loved our fans and gave 
everything he had every night he stepped on stage."<br>
<br>
Springsteen's 17th studio album, Wrecking Ball, was released on March 6,
 2012. On January 13, 2012, Hollywood Reporter released an article 
describing the sound of the new album. According to the article, the 
album is Springsteen at his angriest yet and addresses economic justice 
quite a bit. The article describes the album musically as being very 
rock-and-roll with unexpected textures, loops, electronic percussion and
 a variety of influences. The album consists of eleven tracks plus two 
bonus tracks. Three songs previously only available as live versions, 
"Wrecking Ball", "Land of Hope and Dreams," and "American Land," appear 
on the album. The album's first single, "We Take Care of Our Own", was 
released on January 19, 2012.<br>
<br>
On January 24, 2012, Springsteen's official web site announced that the E
 Street Band will commence a world tour called the Wrecking Ball Tour on
 March 18, 2012, in Atlanta. The tour will run through at least July 31,
 2012, and will consist of at least two legs featuring 51 dates, 
although the headline "First US Leg of 2012 World Tour" may imply that 
the tour will continue into autumn 2012 or beyond. As tickets for the 
first U.S. dates went on sale, many fans were unable to obtain tickets, 
much like for the 2009 Working on a Dream Tour, allegedly due to a heavy
 volume of ticket scalpers. Shows sold out within minutes and many 
tickets appeared, at much higher prices, on resale websites such as 
StubHub less than an hour after the onsale time. Ticketmaster said web 
traffic was 2.5 times the highest level of the past year during the 
online sales and suggested that scalpers played a big role.<br>
<br>
"Rocky Ground" was the second single from Wrecking Ball, exclusively 
released as part of Record Store Day on April 21, 2012. "Death to My 
Hometown" was released as a video that same month and as the third 
single in May 2012.<br>
Wrecking Ball became Springsteen's tenth No. 1 album in the United 
States tying him with Elvis Presley for third most No. 1 albums of 
all-time. Only The Beatles (19) and Jay-Z (12) have more No. 1 albums. 
Wrecking Ball knocked out Adele's Grammy winning album, 21 after 23 
nonconsecutive weeks at #1.<br>
<br>
On July 31, 2012, in Helsinki, Finland, Bruce Springsteen performed his 
longest concert ever at 4 hours and 6 minutes and 33 songs. Not included
 in this total time is the thirty-minute, five-song, solo acoustical set
 he did about two hours prior to the beginning of the show. All in all 
on that day Springsteen performed 4 hours and 36 minutes on stage at 
Helsinki Olympiastadion.<br>
<br>
Springsteen will be honored with the 2013 MusiCares Person of the Year 
award in recognition of his creative accomplishments as well as his 
charitable work and philanthropic activities. The ceremony is scheduled 
to be held on February 8, 2013, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, 
California, two days before the Grammy Awards.<br>
<br>
It was announced in October 2012 that Springsteen and the E Street Band 
will perform at the Rock in Rio festival on September 15, 2013. The 
festival will take place in Brazil and will mark Springsteen's first 
appearance in that country in 25 years.<br>
<br>
In late October 2012, despite saying he would sit this election out, 
Springsteen campaigned for President Barack Obama's re-election in Ohio,
 Iowa, Virginia, Pittsburgh and Wisconsin where he briefly spoke to the 
audience and performed a short acoustic set which included a newly 
written song for the events titled, "Forward". President Barack Obama 
also used "We Take Care of Our Own" as one of his top campaign songs and
 it was played during many of his campaign stops including right after 
his victory speech on election night. Use of the song helped boost sales
 of the song by 409%.<br>
<br>
On October 29, 2012, the New Jersey area was badly hit hard by Hurricane
 Sandy, one of the biggest storms on record to hit the east coast and 
which also caused extensive damage to areas Springsteen grew up in 
including Asbury Park. Two days following the storm on October 31, 2012,
 an emotional Springsteen dedicated his performance at the Blue Cross 
Arena in Rochester, NY, to those affected by the storm and those helping
 to recover. Springsteen and the E Street Band performed "Land of Hope 
and Dreams" at a one-hour televised telethon called Hurricane Sandy: 
Coming Together on November 2, 2012, which aired on NBC and at the same 
time many other channels. Springsteen also joined Billy Joel, Steven 
Tyler and Jimmy Fallon for a performance of "Under the Boardwalk". All 
money was donated to the American Red Cross.<br>
<br>
In early November 2012, the Wrecking Ball Tour was named Top Draw for 
having the top attendance out of any tour by the Billboard Touring 
Awards. The tour finished second to Roger Waters, who had the top 
grossing tour of 2012. <br>
<br>
Director Baillie Walsh along with producer, Ridley Scott are currently 
working on a documentary titled, Springsteen &amp; I which is an open 
invitation to people all over the world to share stories that celebrate 
one of the greatest lyrical storytellers of our generation. Walsh is 
looking for fans’ most personal insights, abstractions and reflections 
on how Bruce Springsteen and his music has affected their lives. Five 
minute long video submissions along with rare photographs will be 
accepted from fans starting on November 15 through November 29, 2012. 
The film and photographs will be edited together to form the documentary
 and released to theaters in 2013.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and the E Street Band, along with many top names in the 
music industry, performed at Madison Square Garden on December 12, 2012,
 for 12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief. The concert was a benefit 
for the victims of Hurricane Sandy and will help provide assistance to 
the millions of people throughout the tri-state area who have been 
affected by the hurricane. The concert was broadcast world-wide on 
various channels including HBO, Showtime and AMC.<br>
<br>
Wrecking Ball along with the single, "We Take Care of Our Own" were 
nominated for three Grammy Awards including Best Rock Performance and 
Best Rock Song for "We Take Care of Our Own" and Best Rock Album.<br>
Rolling Stone named Wrecking Ball the number one album of 2012 on their 
Top 50 albums of 2012 list. Springsteen finished second only to Madonna 
as the top money maker of 2012 with $33.44 million. Madonna made a 
little over $1 millon more than Springsteen for the year. <br>
<br>
Musical style<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen draws on many musical influences from the reservoir of
 traditional American popular music, folk, blues and country. From the 
beginning, rock and roll has been the dominant influence. On his debut 
album, Greetings from Asbury Park, New Jersey, the folk-influence is 
clear. An example of the influence of this music genre to Springsteen's 
music is his song "This Hard Land" which demonstrates a clear influence 
of the style of Woody Guthrie.<br>
<br>
He expanded the range of his musical compositions on his second album, 
The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle. Elements of Latin 
American music, jazz, soul, and funk influences can be heard; the song 
"New York City Serenade" is even reminiscent of the music of George 
Gershwin. These two records prominently featured pianist David Sancious,
 who left the band shortly into the recording of Springsteen's third 
album, Born To Run. This album, however, also emphasized the piano, the 
responsibility now of Roy Bittan.<br>
<br>
Earlier in his career, Springsteen focused more on the rock elements of 
his music. He initially compressed the sound and developed Darkness on 
the Edge of Town just as straightforward as concise musical idiom, for 
the simple riffs, hard rock guitar solos and clearly recognizable song 
structures are dominant. He also drew upon a few influences from punk 
rock on the album, as can be heard on the heavy rhythm following the 
bridge solo on 'Candy's Room'. His music has been categorized as 
heartland rock, a style typified by Springsteen, John Fogerty, Tom 
Petty, Bob Seger, and John Mellencamp. This music has a lyrical 
reference to the U.S. everyday and the music is kept rather simple and 
straightforward. This development culminated with Springsteen's hit 
album Born in the U.S.A., the title song of which has a constantly 
repeating, fanfare-like keyboard riff and a pounding drum beat. These 
sounds fit with Springsteen's voice: it cries to the listener the 
unsentimental story of a disenchanted angry figure. Even songs that can 
be argued to be album tracks proved to be singles that enjoyed some 
chart success, such as "My Hometown" and "I'm on Fire", in which the 
drum line is formed from subtle hi-hat and rim-clicks-shock (shock at 
the edge of the snare drum) accompanied by synthesizer and Springsteen's
 soft guitar line. The album, along with some previous records such as 
"Cadillac Ranch" showed clear rockabilly influences as is evident from 
his guitar solos, in-fills and vocal styles on these. Another clear 
influence of early rock n roll on Springsteen's music is evident on the 
song "Light of Day".<br>
<br>
In recent years, Springsteen has changed his music further.[citation 
needed] There are more folk elements up to the gospel to be heard. His 
last solo album, Devils and Dust, drew rave reviews not only for 
Springsteen's complex songwriting, but also for his expressive and 
sensitive singing.<br>
<br>
On the album We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions Springsteen 
performed folk classics with a folk band, rather than his usual E Street
 Band. On his ensuing tour he also interpreted some of his own rock 
songs in a folk style.<br>
<br>
The 2007 album Magic was a reflection on the old stadium rock attitude 
and with its lush arrangements was almost designed to be performed at 
large stadiums, which also succeeded on the corresponding tour. <br>
His 2012 album, Wrecking Ball, incorporated a variety of styles including rock, gospel, folk and even sampling and loops.<br>
<br>
Lyrical themes<br>
<br>
"I spent most of my life as a musician measuring the distance between the American dream and American reality."<br>
—Bruce Springsteen<br>
<br>
Often described as cinematographic in their scope, Springsteen's lyrics 
frequently explore highly personal themes such as individual commitment,
 dissatisfaction and dismay with life in a context of every day 
situations.<br>
It has been recognized that there was a shift in his lyrical approach 
starting with the album Darkness on the Edge of Town, in which he 
focused on the emotional struggles of working class life.<br>
<br>
Personal life<br>
<br>
In the early 1980s, Springsteen met Patti Scialfa at The Stone Pony, a 
bar in New Jersey where local musicians perform on a regular basis. On 
that particular evening she was performing alongside one of 
Springsteen’s pals, Bobby Bandiera, with whom she had written "At Least 
We Got Shoes" for Southside Johnny. Springsteen liked her voice and 
after the performance, introduced himself to her. Soon after that, they 
started hanging out together and became friends.<br>
<br>
Early in 1984 Springsteen asked Scialfa to join the E Street Band for 
the upcoming Born in the U.S.A. Tour. According to the book Bruce 
Springsteen on Tour 1969–2005 by Dave Marsh, it looked like Springsteen 
and Scialfa were on the brink of becoming a couple through the first leg
 of the tour. But before that could happen, Barry Bell introduced 
Julianne Phillips to Springsteen and on May 13, 1985, they got married. 
The two were opposites in background, had a 11-year age difference and 
his travelling took its toll on their relationship. In 1987, Springsteen
 wrote his next album, Tunnel of Love, on which many of the songs 
described his unhappiness in the relationship with Phillips.<br>
<br>
In 1988 the Tunnel of Love Express Tour began and Springsteen convinced 
Scialfa to join the tour again. She was reluctant at first, since she 
wanted to start recording her first solo album, but after Springsteen 
told her that the tour would be short, she agreed to postpone her own 
solo record.  Phillips and Springsteen separated in the spring of 1988, 
but it wasn’t made known to the press. Springsteen and Scialfa fell in 
love with one another during the Tunnel of Love Express Tour and started
 living together soon after his separation from Phillips. On August 30, 
1988, Julianne filed for divorce. The Springsteen/Phillips divorce was 
finalized on March 1, 1989. <br>
<br>
Springsteen received press criticism for the hastiness in which he and 
Scialfa took up their relationship. In a 1995 interview with The 
Advocate, Springsteen spoke about the negative publicity the couple 
subsequently received. "It's a strange society that assumes it has the 
right to tell people whom they should love and whom they shouldn't. But 
the truth is, I basically ignored the entire thing as much as I could. I
 said, 'Well, all I know is, this feels real, and maybe I have got a 
mess going here in some fashion, but that's life.'" He also noted that, 
"I went through a divorce, and it was really difficult and painful and I
 was very frightened about getting married again. So part of me said, 
'Hey, what does it matter?' But it does matter. It's very different than
 just living together. First of all, stepping up publicly—which is what 
you do: You get your license, you do all the social rituals—is a part of
 your place in society and in some way part of society's acceptance of 
you ... Patti and I both found that it did mean something."<br>
<br>
Springsteen and Scialfa initially lived in New Jersey and for a short 
while in New York,[96] before deciding to move to Los Angeles where they
 decided to start a family. On July 25, 1990, Scialfa gave birth to the 
couple's first child, Evan James Springsteen. On June 8, 1991, 
Springsteen and Scialfa married at their Los Angeles home in a very 
private ceremony, only attended by family and close friends. Their 
second child, Jessica Rae Springsteen, was born on December 30, 1991; 
and their third child, Samuel Ryan Springsteen, was born on January 5, 
1994.<br>
<br>
When the children reached school-going age in the early 1990s, 
Springsteen and Scialfa moved back to New Jersey specifically to raise a
 family in a non-paparazzi environment. The grounds of his New Jersey 
home include a large swimming pool. The family owns and lives on a horse
 farm in Colts Neck, New Jersey. They also own homes in Wellington, 
Florida, a wealthy horse community near West Palm Beach, Los Angeles and
 Rumson, New Jersey.<br>
<br>
Their eldest son, Evan, graduated from Boston College. He writes and 
performs his own songs and won the 2012 Singer/Songwriter Competition 
held during the Boston College's Arts Festival. Their daughter Jessica 
is a nationally ranked champion equestrian,  and attends Duke 
University. Their youngest son, Sam, attends Bard College, a private 
liberal arts college.<br>
<br>
It has been reported that the press conference regarding the 2009 Super 
Bowl XLIII half-time show was Springsteen's first press conference for 
more than 25 years.However, he has appeared in a few radio interviews, 
most notably on NPR and BBC. 60 Minutes aired his last extensive 
interview on TV before his tour to support his album, Magic.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is also an activist for gay rights and has spoken out many 
times as a strong supporter of gay marriage. In 2009, he posted the 
following statement on his webpage: "I've long believed in and have 
always spoken out for the rights of same sex couples and fully agree 
with Governor Corzine when he writes that 'The marriage-equality issue 
should be recognized for what it truly is -- a civil rights issue that 
must be approved to assure that every citizen is treated equally under 
the law.'"<br>
<br>
 In 2012, he lent his support to an ad campaign for gay marriage called 
"The Four 2012". Springsteen noted in the ad, "I couldn't agree more 
with that statement and urge those who support equal treatment for our 
gay and lesbian brothers and sisters to let their voices be heard now."</div>

Hardy man is bonded to 'The Boss'<br>
Super-fan Dan Eitner of Hardy makes a move that links him to rock star Bruce Springsteen. </strong><br>
<br>
by<br>
Elizabeth Hock <br>
<br>
Friday, May 10, 2013<br>
<br>
“I’m not a nut; I mean I don’t worship these or anything,” said Dan 
Eitner as he pulled the neatly folded pair of black jeans off the 
hanger. He held them up in the same way a formerly overweight person 
would display old pants alongside the ones they’re wearing, proudly 
comparing the ones before to the ones after their weight loss. The jeans
 have nothing to do with loss, but everything to do with what Eitner 
found.<br>
<br>
In 2000, Eitner opened a box and discovered the Levis and a treasure 
trove of other personal belongings that forever will link the 
58-year-old Hardy man to rock legend Bruce Springsteen. Eitner got the 
box from a friend whose sister’s husband salvaged it from the garbage at
 Springsteen’s New Jersey farm, where he had done some work for the 
musician. The friend knew Eitner was a huge fan and brought it to him.<br>
<br>
Eitner and Springsteen share Jersey shore roots. In the early 1970s, 
Eitner often watched him perform at the Stone Pony, a bar in Asbury Park
 , N.J., famous as the place where Springsteen and his E-Street Band got
 their start. When Eitner opened the box, he found some of Springsteen’s
 old clothes and several VHS tapes featuring artists such as Sam and 
Dave, and Prince. But it was the cassette tapes the box held that ended 
up being the best find. Eitner assumed the tapes were blank, but after 
he began listening to them, he knew he had happened upon something 
special.<br>
<br>
As Eitner plays a tape, listeners can hear Springsteen and Patti 
Scialfa, his wife and fellow band member , at home, talking, laying down
 melodies for several songs and playing guitar. The recordings, which 
total about 90 minutes, are somewhat rough and amateurish, as if they 
were recorded on a small cassette recorder, Eitner said. But they 
provide a fascinating look into the couple’s creative process. “You can 
actually hear Springsteen’s genius at work,” said Eitner. “What a find.”
 Conversation between Springsteen and Scialfa reveals little about their
 personal relationship. At one point, Springsteen says he’s starving and
 ready to eat. Eitner said you also can hear Springsteen in the process 
of building a fire. The tapes contain several songs, but only one that 
had been released. Eitner didn’t know what to do with them, but he knew 
he didn’t want them to end up in the wrong hands.<br>
<br>
He considered trying to sell them to the highest bidder but decided 
against it. “I’ve been a fan for 30 years,” Eitner recalled saying to 
himself. “What is the right thing to do?” Return them to Springsteen, he
 decided. It took months . The challenge was breaking through the 
singer’s entourage to find someone he could trust to deliver the tapes 
to Springsteen himself. After several attempts, Eitner got a call from 
Springsteen’s personal assistant, asking what his boss had to do to get 
the tapes back. “At that point, I probably could have asked for about 
anything,” Eitner said. They decided he would deliver them in person. 
But first he made copies, “just in case ” they went missing, he said.<br>
<br>
About six months after he opened the box, Eitner returned to the Stone 
Pony, this time with his daughter, for Springsteen’s band’s 25th 
anniversary show. In the back of the bar, Eitner found Springsteen. The 
singer thanked him for returning the cassettes. Eitner asked if they 
could pose for a photo together, but in the confusion of the scene and 
with the music blaring, it never happened. The next day, Eitner’s wife, 
Nancy, was rushing out the door of their Chestnut Creek home when the 
phone rang. She got to it just in time to hear Springsteen leaving a 
message, apologizing for not getting the photo with Eitner. “I can’t 
believe your voice is on my phone,” Nancy Eitner gushes into the phone. 
The answering machine had picked up, and the conversation between his 
wife and idol is recorded for posterity, much to the couple’s delight. 
The recording has Springsteen telling Eitner, who was still in Jersey, 
to get in touch with his personal assistant to schedule a time for a 
photo<br>
<br>
A year or so later, after a three-hour show in Greensboro, N.C., Eitner 
would finally get his photo and an all-access pass to any of 
Springsteen’s shows. That photo, a wall full of others and various 
Springsteen memorabilia are neatly displayed in the “Bruce room” at the 
Eitner s’ home. Eitner said his wife is determined to turn it into a 
guest room. Perhaps, a music room would be more fitting. His encounters 
with rock ‘n’ roll royalty inspired the former convenience store owner 
and salesman, who calls himself “semi-retired,” to try his hand at 
writing music. “I learned to write lyrics from Bruce. It just didn’t 
seem that hard,” said Eitner, adding that it’s more hobby than business.<br>
<br>
Letting go of the “Bruce room” doesn’t mean Eitner’s admiration of 
Springsteen has waned. Eitner, who said he’s seen Springsteen in person 
more than 100 times, still tries to catch a show whenever possible. “He 
will go down as the greatest of all time,” Eitner said. “You either get 
Bruce or you don’t.”</div>
