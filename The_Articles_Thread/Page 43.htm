<br>
by JIM CULLEN</strong>\\Some people pray, some people play music.                                — Bruce Springsteen<br>
One story Bruce Springsteen often told in his early concerts was about 
how his parents were worried about his fixation with rock and roll, 
which they felt was no way to make a living. His father, a bus driver, 
thought he should be a lawyer; his mother, a secretary and homemaker, 
thought he should become a writer.<br>
      “My mother, she’s very Italian,” he told a roaring crowd in 
Phoenix years ago. “She says, ‘This is a big thing, you should go see a 
priest.’” Bruce goes to the rectory and talks to Father Ray, but Father 
Ray says “This is too big a deal for me. You gotta talk to God.’”<br>
      Bruce has no idea where to find God, but his sidekick and 
saxophone player Clarence Clemons does: God lives in a house at the edge
 of the woods. Bruce and Clarence drive to God’s house. Music blasts 
through the door of the house as they approach.<br>
      “Clarence sent me,” says Bruce to the Lord, who is seated behind a drum set. Springsteen explains his career dilemma.<br>
      “There was supposed to be an eleventh commandment,” answers God. 
“It’s Moses’ fault. He was so scared after ten, he went back down the 
mountain. You shoulda seen it—great show, the burning bush, thunder, 
lightning. You see, what those guys didn’t understand was that there was
 an eleventh commandment...<br>
let it rock!”<br>
      It’s helpful to point out what doesn’t happen here: this is not a 
story in which a young man denies the  existence of God, or angrily 
rejects Him, or is disappointed by what he finds. This is a story about a
 man who seeks and receives divine approval for doing what he most wants
 to do. Which is, in effect, to become a missionary. The man whose 
parents fear he does not want to work ends up doing the most important 
work of all: God’s work.<br>
The devil appeared like Jesus through the steam in the street Showin’ me
 a hand I knew even the cops couldn’t beat I felt his hot breath on my 
neck as I dove through the heat It’s so hard to be a saint when you’re 
just a boy out on the street<br>
Bruce Springsteen went to Saint Rose of Lima Catholic elementary school 
in Freehold, New Jersey. He describes his experience, cheerfully, as a 
disaster. “I spent half of my first thirteen years in a trance... In the
 third grade a nun stuffed me in a garbage can because, she said, that’s
 where I belonged...<br>
I also had the distinction of being the only altar boy knocked down by a
 priest during Mass. The old priest got mad. My mother wanted me to 
serve Mass, but I didn’t know what I was doin’ so I was trying to fake 
it...” Throwing in the towel, Springsteen’s parents sent him to the 
public high school in Freehold. But his Catholicism was deeply rooted. 
Jesus and Mary and the Holy Ghost figure heavily in his early lyrics, 
and the 1975 hit “Thunder Road” is rife with Catholic imagery:<br>
You can hide ’neath your covers And study your pain Make crosses from 
your lovers Throw roses in the rain Waste your summer praying in 
vain For a savior to rise from these streets Well now I’m no hero That’s
 understood All the redemption I can offer, girl Is beneath this dirty 
hood With a chance to make it good somehow Hey what else can we do now?<br>
And, by the time of Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978), it is clear 
that Springsteen has read the Bible very carefully indeed — note the 
songs “The Promised Land” and “Adam Raised a Cain,” for example:<br>
In the Bible Cain slew Abel And East of Eden he was cast You’re born into this life payin’ For the sins of somebody else’s past<br>
But the major turning point in Springsteen’s career is The River (1980),
 in which his Catholicism is no longer merely a matter of metaphor or 
humor. The mature artist is now interested in spirituality and hope, 
resurrection and faith, grace and dignity. Ordinary objects are endowed 
with sacred intensity, and the ragged, anguished quality of 
Springsteen’s voice forcefully endows everything with an almost 
religious aura. And he is now in direct confrontation with the 
psychological dimensions of sin and human mortality. While the 
characters of Darkness wrestle with burdensome legacies in the struggle 
to realize their aspirations, many of those on The River actually lose 
the fight. In early Springsteen songs, characters respond to such 
adversity with renewed determination. The truly scary songs of The River
 are those, especially on the last half of the album, in which 
individuals realize that they’ve come up against something much larger 
than they can handle.<br>
But I ride by night And I travel in fear That in this darkness I will disappear<br>
The next step along Springsteen’s spiritual road is the record Nebraska 
(1982). If the characters of The River veer toward a spiritual abyss, 
those of this album plunge into it. Nowhere is this clearer than in the 
title track, whose protagonist (based on Charlie Starkweather, a man who
 went on a notorious murder rampage in the 1950s) reveals much about the
 mood of the album. Tried, convicted, and sentenced to death, he is 
informed that his soul will be hurled into “that great void.” Unlike the
 characters of “Stolen Car” or “Wreck on the Highway,” however, he 
receives this news with an almost unnerving lack of affect. Asked why he
 has committed such monstrous crimes, he offers an explanation that 
looms over the album as a whole: “Well sir I guess there’s just a 
meanness in this world.”<br>
      The disembodied quality of “meanness” is crucial. At the time of 
its release during the worst recession since the Great Depression, 
reviewers of Nebraska wrote a great deal about the political critique 
embedded in the album. Far less has been said about the religious 
foundation of that critique, which rests on a confrontation with the 
problem—and nature—of evil. While some might project their darkest 
impulses on to a particular group of people (blacks, Jews, immigrants) 
and others single out more abstract, socially determined institutional 
forces (inequality, economic dislocation, homophobia), Springsteen 
posits evil as a force that defies demographic specificity or rational 
explanation.<br>
      And evil is everlasting. This is the message of “My Father’s 
House,” Springsteen’s most conventionally pious song. An adult son 
dreams of being lost in the woods with the devil snapping at his heels. 
He desperately seeks, and finds, his father—only to awaken to a powerful
 sense of guilt and longing over their broken relationship. Impulsively,
 he dresses and drives to the house, only to learn he no longer lives 
there. The concluding verse sounds a collective indictment:<br>
My father’s house shines hard and bright It stands like a beacon, 
calling me in the night Calling and calling, so cold and alone Shining 
’cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned<br>
Yet Springsteen suggests that there is a flip side to transcendental 
sin: “Everything dies baby that’s a fact / But maybe everything that 
dies some day comes back,” speculates the narrator of “Atlantic City.” 
If sin permeates every action, so, too, may grace. Or, as the very last 
song of the record (“Reason to Believe”) has it: “... At the end of 
every hard earned ay/People find some reason to believe...”<br>
<br>
“[The Springsteen album] Tunnel of Love may be a more important Catholic
 event in this country than the visit of Pope John Paul II,” wrote 
Father Andrew Greeley in 1988, just after it was released. “The Pope 
spoke of moral debates using the language of doctrinal propositions that
 appeal to (or repel) the mind. Springsteen sings of religious 
realities—sin, temptation,  forgiveness, life, death, hope — in images 
that come (implicitly perhaps) from his Catholic childhood, images that 
appeal to the whole person, not just the head, and that will be absorbed
 by far more Americans than those who listened to the Pope ... The piety
 of these songs—and I challenge you to find a better word—is sentient 
without being sentimental...”<br>
You’ve got to learn to live with what you can’t rise above If you want to ride on down through this tunnel of love<br>
This record is filled with Catholic imagery and language, from the 
straightforward memories of the church bells of his childhood to the 
words that fill the songs: mercy and love and fear. Tunnel of Love ends 
with an epiphany, the song “Valentine’s Day,” and the last verse is a 
rebirth: “I woke up scared and breathin’ and born anew…”<br>
In subsequent records like Human Touch and Lucky Town, Springsteen 
continued to grapple with the great themes of his work, good and evil, 
right and wrong, courage and despair, and even as his voice grew sharper
 (“Now I ply my trade in the land of king dollar / Where you get paid 
and your silence passes for honor”), he sings life and hope with ever 
greater power and poetry:<br>
Well now all that’s sure on the boulevard Is that life is just a house 
of cards As fragile as each and every breath Of this boy sleepin’ in our
 bed Tonight let’s lie beneath the eaves Just a close band of happy 
thieves And when that train comes we’ll get on board And steal what we 
can from the treasures, treasures of the Lord ...<br>
Bruce Springsteen’s music has been recorded by a number of other 
artists, and has been used in a number of feature films. But he had 
never been commissioned to write a song until director Jonathan Demme 
approached him in 1992 with such a request for Philadelphia, a 1993 film
 about a man with AIDS who wrongly loses his position with a law firm. 
Springsteen agreed to see what he could do. The result was “Streets of 
Philadelphia,” which won Grammy Awards, a 1994 Oscar, and tremendous 
commercial success. Whatever else this song may be, however, it is also a
 profound religious statement. “There was a certain spiritual stillness 
that I wanted to try and capture,” he said.<br>
I was bruised and battered and I couldn’t tell what I felt I was 
unrecognizable to myself I saw my reflection in a window I didn’t know 
my own face Oh brother, are you gonna leave me wastin’ away<br>
The song is about faith in human grace, and there is an almost 
overwhelming longing for transcendence. At the end of it, the irregular 
beat stops for the only time in the song. It’s as if the narrator is 
just about to let go. But not yet: He turns his concern outward. In the 
first verse, he was afraid of being left alone; now, at the end, he 
wonders if we will leave each other alone. The question is left 
un-answered as the narrator sings the words “Streets of Philadelphia” 
for the last time. But the song is not over. It goes on for about 
another minute. The chanting harmonies and drumbeat gradually fade as 
the organ increasingly dominates the song. The same phrase — the chord 
progression is one often used for “Amen” during church hymns — is played
 repeatedly, rising in steps. Finally, the lower notes fall out as the 
organ notes peak and disappear: He has risen.<br>
Listening carefully to the music of Bruce Springsteen, one hears an 
emphasis on egalitarianism; an instinctive compassion; a pragmatic 
skepticism toward utopian solutions; and, especially recently, a bracing
 humility about human endeavor — worth emulating in sacred as well as 
secular life. These are the values of a good conservative. These are the
 values of a great people.<br>
      In the almost 150 years since the Civil War, numerous politicians,
 artists, activists, and others have called on what Lincoln called our 
“better angels.” More often than not, such calls have fallen on deaf 
ears. One might even say that our most notable achievements, ranging 
from the passage of child labor laws to defeating the Nazis, have 
cynical explanations. But no nation can function at all without some 
faith in its intentions, and it is the American faith that the 
republican democracy of the last 200 years can claim more success than 
failure, more progress than regress. Honorable people can disagree as to
 the degree of success or regress, and can disagree as to what exactly 
constitutes better angels. My own answers to those questions are 
formulated with the help of a rock and roll singer with little in the 
way of formal education. It may seem unlikely to think of him in such 
Lincolnian terms (though Lincoln himself had little in the way of formal
 education), but it seems to me that part of our American faith is a 
willingness to look for—and the confidence that we will find—answers to 
our most important questions in relatively humble quarters.<br>
      The value of Bruce Springsteen’s art is not in some vast talent 
(though he is an unusually talented man), but rather in his acuity in 
representing the people who populate his songs, people who have foibles 
and failings, but people who in the end constitute our last best hope 
for making this society work. At the same time, considered as a whole, 
Springsteen manifests a series of tendencies—his republicanism, his 
accommodation of personal and collective failure, his hope for his 
country, and his belief in something larger than it—which really do 
reveal better angels that at least coexist with lesser ones.<br>
      These tendencies are not Springsteen’s alone; that is precisely 
why he is important. His art bears a strong resemblance to that of a 
number of other important figures in our history, from the expressive 
poetry of Walt Whitman to the humorous prose of Mark Twain. His politics
 reflect an egalitarian spirit that brings Jefferson’s plowman to FDR’s 
fireside. His moral fervor resonates with that of Lincoln and Martin 
Luther King. Springsteen may not be as accomplished as any of these 
people. But he too, with immense grace and power, embodies common values
 spread across American society at large.<br>
      In January 1993, inaugurating a presidency that was a 
disappointment to many of us, Bill Clinton told his fellow citizens that
 “there is nothing wrong with America that can’t be fixed by what’s 
right with America.” This, it seems to me, is the core of our national 
creed and the essence of Springsteen’s music. It is the job of a truly 
great artist to remind us of who we are. When I listen to Bruce 
Springsteen, I remember how to be an American.<br>
One last Springsteen story. In the immediate aftermath of the September 
11 murders, Springsteen was in his car, pulling out of a beach parking 
lot in the town of Sea Bright, New Jersey, when a man drove by, rolled 
down his window, and shouted “We need you!” Springsteen went to work. He
 recorded “Thunder Road” for one victim’s funeral. He helped raise a 
million dollars for the families of victims in his county. He performed a
 new song, “My City of Ruins,” for a fundraising telethon. And he began 
to write and record feverishly.<br>
      “I didn’t set out to write a 9/11 album,” he said later. “I didn’t
 want to write literally about what happened, but [about] the emotions 
in the air. In the purest sense, that’s what a songwriter does ... 
[it’s] a secular stations of the cross ...” What this great American 
storyteller made was the record The Rising, which may well remain the 
most durable cultural artifact to emerge from the rubble. Incantation, 
choirs, chants of resurrection, transubstantiation, passion, starkness, 
references to Buddha and Allah and prophets and the eleven angels of 
mercy  — it is an insistent fusion of joy and sorrow, East and West, 
life and death. It is a musical tapestry that argues for a kind of 
diverse unity: e pluribus unum. This Catholic is catholic. Like the very
 best priests, the work Springsteen has done helps us to keep faith: 
with ourselves, with our country, with a love that both encompasses and 
transcends the gift of life.<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen on 'Anomaly' of New Album 'High Hopes': <br>
<br>
By ANDY GREENE<br>
December 17, 2013 <br>
<br>
Tom Morello was driving around Los Angeles in late 2012 when "High 
Hopes" – one of the most obscure songs in Bruce Springsteen’s vast 
catalog, originally released on a forgotten 1996 EP – came on E Street 
Radio, the SiriusXM channel devoted to Springsteen. "I was reminded what
 a jam it was," says the Rage Against the Machine guitarist, who was 
preparing to serve as a temporary replacement for Steve Van Zandt on the
 E Street Band’s 2013 tour of Australia. "In the middle of the night, I 
texted Bruce and said, 'What do you think about 'High Hopes' for the 
tour?’ He agreed we should put it in the set." Little did Morello 
realize that a new version of "High Hopes" would become the title track 
of Springsteen’s 18th studio album, due out January 14th. <br>
<br>
High Hopes is a first for Springsteen: a studio album composed entirely 
of covers, outtakes and radically reimagined versions of fan-favorite 
songs from past albums and tours. High points include a cover of 
Seventies punk pioneers Suicide ("Dream Baby Dream"); songs he 
originally wrote for 2002's The Rising ("Harry's Place," "Down in the 
Hole"); and searing new takes of concert staples "The Ghost of Tom Joad"
 and "American Skin (41 Shots)." "The best way to describe this record 
is that's its a bit of an anomaly," says Springsteen. "But not much. I 
don't really work linearly like a lot of people do."<br>
<br>
Springsteen has always written and recorded significantly more songs 
than can fit on to whatever album he's creating at the moment. "I have a
 lot of this music on a computer," he says. "I bring it out on the road 
to amuse myself. Very often, if I have nothing to do late at night I'll 
bring it up and look at different bodies of music."<br>
<br>
The songs that began catching Springsteen's attention were largely 
recorded after he reunited with the E Street Band in 1999. "The songs 
were relatively current and had a similar sound picture," he says. "I 
was interested in putting this material together in some form because it
 sounded like it all fit together . . . You have to imagine that when 
I'm home or done with a tour I go into a studio and I'm surrounded by 
paintings that I've sorta half-finished. There might be something wrong 
with this one and I didn't have time to finish this one. When I go into 
my studio, I'm surrounded by all my music that I haven't released. I 
wait to see what's going to speak to me." <br>
<br>
In December of 2012, he called producer Ron Aniello, whom he first 
worked with on 2012’s Wrecking Ball, and asked him to sort through about
 15 songs. "He said, 'I’m on the road right now – just fool around with 
them and see what you think you can do,'" says Aniello. "Although they 
didn't fit the particular story he was telling for each album – you know
 how crazy he is about having each album tell a linear story. But these 
were fantastic songs."<br>
<br>
Springsteen – who has grown close with Tom Morello ever since they first
 performed together in 2008 – wound up having the guitarist play on six 
songs, including new renditions of "American Skin (41 Shots)" and "The 
Ghost of Tom Joad." "He became a filter that I ran my music through," 
says Springsteen. "He would send the songs back to me with a very 
current slant on them . . . He jolted those songs into the now. He's one
 of the few guitarists that creates a world by himself. It's like the 
Edge or Pete Townshend or Johnny Marr. The E Street Band is a big house,
 but when Tom is onstage he builds another room."<br>
<br>
In March 2013, Springsteen and E Street toured Australia with Morello. 
Everyone was impressed by the crowd’s enthusiastic reactions to the new,
 Morello-assisted arrangement of "High Hopes" (written in the late 
Eighties by folk singer Tim Scott McConnell) and an amped-up cover of 
"Just Like Fire Would" by Aussie punk legends the Saints. Springsteen 
called up engineer Nick DiDia – an old friend who'd recently relocated 
to Sydney – and booked some impromptu sessions. "We had no plans to 
record," says Springsteen. "But I found a hook to bring these songs to 
life and I was anxious to get to work on them." <br>
<br>
Between revamped versions of the studio outtakes he had sent Aniello and
 new recordings of the covers and live favorites that Morello was 
infusing with fresh energy onstage, Springsteen realized he had enough 
material for an album. There was just one problem: The E Street Band had
 worldwide dates booked for the rest of the year. So he decided to 
record the entire LP between shows – something he’d never tried before –
 with members of the band overdubbing new parts at Aniello's Los Angeles
 studio or Springsteen’s home studio in New Jersey during breaks. 
"Previously, everything was like when I was a kid," says Springsteen. "I
 needed the peas to be on one plate and the corn had to be on another 
plate and I didn't like them to touch. That's where I was coming from. I
 thought everything had to be very segregated." <br>
<br>
For Morello, getting to work with Springsteen more closely over the past
 year has been the thrill of a lifetime. "I am not a casual Bruce 
Springsteen fan –I am a big Bruce Springsteen fan," he says. "And 'The 
Ghost of Tom Joad' is one of his best songs. It cuts to the core of his 
social-justice writing. This version starts as a plaintive ballad, which
 feels like a lament, and becomes a full-bore rocker that feels like a 
threat."<br>
<br>
A few weeks after High Hopes arrives, Springsteen and the E Street Band –
 with Morello in tow – will kick off a five-week tour of South Africa, 
Australia and New Zealand. One thing that's not on the books right now: 
any dates in the U.S., where they haven’t played since late 2012.<br>
<br>
"We're looking around now to see what we might do," says Springsteen. "I
 don't want to say 'yes' because I don't want to disappoint people, but I
 certainly don't want to rule it out either. We're looking closely since
 there's places we missed on the last tour. We didn't get to Texas, 
where I love to play. We didn't get to Florida either. It might be fun 
to get back to some of those places."<br>
<br>
This year also marks the 30th anniversary of Springsteen’s smash Born in
 the U.S.A., but his manager, Jon Landau, says there are no plans to 
celebrate that with a deluxe reissue – at least not yet. "There's 
ongoing work on a River box set," says Landau. "Maybe we’ll do that 
first. And we're doing some remastering work on his first two albums 
[1973's Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J. and The Wild, the Innocent 
&amp; the E Street Shuffle] as we speak. Those will be forthcoming."<br>
<br>
Springsteen didn't release a new studio album during the seven years 
between The Ghost of Tom Joad and The Rising, but he doesn't imagine 
anything like that will ever happen again. "It's like that old story," 
he says. "The light from the oncoming train focuses the mind."</div>

Sylvie Simmons, NME, 22 November 1980</strong><br>

IT'S EASY to see why the girls go so much on him. You got the excitable 
adolescent of 'Rosalita', 'Crush On You' – hey hey hey what you say 
Cherri darling, quick-romance-behind-the-stadium frenzy – and you got 
the grand romantic tough-and-tender stuff, big gestures, big everything 
and he can prove it all night too.<br>
<br>
Not that he could do too much after a show like tonight's. Four hours. 
Four! Most arena superstars couldn't keep it up half as long and 
certainly not half as exciting. But the little girls understand. Knowing
 of his knackered state backstage after the show they've been using the 
steps that join him to the audience to get up onstage and get in a 
two-minute smacker during the show before the roadies (no bouncers – 
Bruce would have them all in the dole queue, good man) gently pry them 
away, it being a bit hard to sing with more than one tongue per mouth.<br>
<br>
As for the other half of the packed-in crowd, Springsteen seems to be to
 guys with brains and balls what Waylon and Willie are to guys with 
cowboy hats and beer bellies: the big little guy, the one who's broken 
out of the everyday crap, who embodies hopes and dreams and grand 
majestic visions and romance without resorting to Interflora slush. He's
 a lot like a musical John Ford movie with a James Brown songbook 
chucked in. Give the man six words (cars, front-porch, woman, streets. 
darkness, comb) and you'll get two dozen songs, plus enough big gestures
 and visions to make your soul snap in two.<br>
<br>
It's really hard to talk about a Bruce Springsteen concert without 
getting sugary and poetic and totally over-the-top, which runs a risk of
 getting back into those 'future of rock and roll' hype-shit days, and 
turning the man into a caricature, a media recreation of himself with 
words like CELEBRATION flashing alongside the credits in neon lights. 
Which is why, according to the promoters, the whole 43-date tour sold 
out without benefit of ads, just mail-order (200,000 ticket applications
 in New York alone! Four nights sold out at the LA Sports Arena and 
people paying up to a hundred quid to touts) though the guy's been 
rarely heard of since his last tour two years ago. It was just, they 
reckoned, kids – who had no way to explain the 
living-breathing-rock-and-roll experience to their mates without 
dragging them down in person – buying the tickets themselves if they had
 to, with a kind of quasi-religious fervour you'd expect for a man who 
virtually hypnotises audiences wherever he plays.<br>
<br>
It's been 29 months since Springsteen released Darkness On The Edge Of 
Town (other than The River the most quickly successful of his albums – 
River went in the US charts at number 2 and has just eased into top 
position) and when you think that it's not only a double (anathema in 
these days of Maggie-Reagan recession) but that in the time it's taken 
perfecting the thing, careers have bloomed and faded, narrow ties traded
 in for synthesisers and psychedelic drugs, it's easy to see the risk 
he's taken in getting it right (his theory was that he'd have to be 
playing the bloody things for the next six months, so he might as well 
like what he's playing) the fact the 29-city tour sold out so quickly 
just by word of mouth is the kind of magic you get to expect of the man.
 He doesn't let you down.<br>
<br>
Pretty much the entire repertoire gets down in the four (except for a 
short Vitamin E break midway) hours. Thank the lord he got the thing out
 before it became a boxed set otherwise they'd have needed a Bruce 
Weekend Festival to fit the songs in.<br>
<br>
'Born To Run' starts out on a wild note. He remembers all the words this
 time – the first date on the tour, Michigan, he forgot and had to rely 
on the audience to prompt him. It's part of the role the crowd gets to 
play. But this is no mere Rod Stewart pantomime. You know how most 
American audiences fidget and walk around and generally wander during 
arena shows (not the most comfortable) or noisily ruin their expensive 
dental work through the whole show, well this lot were transfixed during
 the slow ones and crazed through the fast ones like some rock and roll 
yoyo, and chanting "Bruuuuuuuce Bruuuuce" between songs like a herd of 
randy cows. 'Prove It All Night': the crowd cheers Clarence Clemon's 
tambourine playing, goes apeshit at his saxophone. 'Tenth Avenue 
Freezeout': Springsteen's voice gets hotter, raspier as it overcomes the
 loud, punchy music, and he leaps into the crowd, sings and conducts 
from the seats, faints into waiting arms, leaps back onstage, jumps in 
the air, lands on his knee, guitar posed just-so, an encore by song 
number three except he promised "I'm gonna be playing all night" to 
delirium from a crowd that really didn't expect any less.<br>
<br>
Some emotional stuff: 'Darkness On The Edge Of Town' and the kinks have 
been ironed out of the sound system so everything's just perfect; 
powerful music, sincere, seductive vocals and so-natural rockstar poses 
that send shivers up and down your spine.<br>
<br>
There's a movie-like quality to the songs, especially those from The 
River, most of which is reserved for the second half though we get a 
preview here. Maybe a bit less idealistic (he couldn't do more!) it's 
based around a working-class kid's hopes and dreams and struggles and 
finally defeat. For the first time a Bruce woman can get pregnant and a 
Bruce car can kill, like 'Wreck On The Highway'. The hymn-like 
'Independence Day' and 'Working Life' get a dramatic rap about his dad, 
got straight out of the school and into the army, married, soon had 
little Brucie and so his dreams as he made his way to the factory every 
day were for his kids to have what he didn't. You could have heard a 
piece of popcorn drop in the place as he sang it – beautiful. Relieved 
by a raunchy 'Jacksons Cage' and 'Promised Land', back to ballads with 
'The River', then onto epic proportions with 'Thunder Road', 'Badlands' 
and a teabreak. A perfectly paced first half stopped only by a rap about
 throwing green twirly things at his band and writing to your MP about 
ticket touts.<br>
<br>
Second half starts on an even more crazed note: 'Cadillac', a teenage 
celebration (not bad for a 31-year-old) and a sexy version of the song 
he wrote for Robert Gordon but sings better himself: 'Fire'. Flo and 
Eddie add backing vocals and a big sound to 'Hungry Heart' (Hungry? 
Those two?!) And there's raps about college, girls as viewed from front 
porches and long memories, a lot of The River. The ultimate ballad: 
'Point Blank'; fun premature ejaculation: 'Crush On You', some hamming 
it up with Clarence (of course the other star of the show) on 'Rosalita'
 ("such a sad song" with a fake slow intro).<br>
<br>
Three hours or more, it's past midnight, but they're back for more 
encores, the melodramatic 'Jungleland' shot like a movie with fading 
lights, and the 'Devil In The Blue Dress' rock and roll medley with wild
 dancing. on the floor, on his knees, in the crowd – delirium, until 
there's nothing left of the guy to give. I could have taken four hours 
more. If this is rock and roll heaven, book me a flight.</div>
