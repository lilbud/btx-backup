				<div class="content">Review: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band at Sports Arena<br>
<br>
April 27, 2012 <br>
<br>
Los Angeles Times<br>
 <br>
Halfway through Thursday night’s miraculous revival meeting cum concert 
at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, Bruce Springsteen stopped to 
recall his beginnings in the '60s and early '70s playing with a bar 
band. There was one type of music that was guaranteed to move a Jersey 
Shore crowd.<br>
<br>
“You always had to have a little soul in your pocket,” said the 
62-year-old artist with the vigor of a 30-year-old. Then Springsteen led
 the E Street Band — at 16 pieces, it’s officially a big band, not a 
rock band, now — through a medley of vintage Temptations and Wilson 
Pickett tunes.<br>
<br>
Testifying from a platform in the middle of the audience (the concert 
was sold out, as is Friday night’s), Springsteen stopped to guzzle a 
beer. He tossed the empty plastic cup, then fell backward on the 
outreached hands of fans, who passed their (tipsy) messiah up to the 
stage.<br>
<br>
Springsteen has always been a killer showman, someone who’s closely 
studied the great acts of R&amp;B (the Rev. Al Green and James Brown) 
and learned how to preach a story, milk a call-and-response affirmation,
 and play dead then get on up. But increasingly, the gospel roots of 
this soul man have made themselves manifest. It seems like this Catholic
 son has been spending time in black churches.<br>
<br>
By the point — two jaw-dropping, career-spanning hours into the 26-song 
night — that Bruce and the band boarded the train to the “Land of Hopes 
and Dreams,” he had some 40,000, mostly white, hands up in the air, 
vibrating with the spirit of the Holy Ghost.<br>
<br>
Another ghost was very much present in the arena, acting as the night’s 
guiding spirit, so to speak. Springsteen lost his musical soul mate last
 year when Clarence Clemons, the band’s saxophonist and the bandleader’s
 right-hand man, passed away. Judging by his repeated direct and 
indirect references to missing persons — culminating in a powerful 
screen tribute during “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” — Springsteen feels the 
loss keenly.<br>
<br>
Clemons’ nephew Jake has stepped in to ably fill the Big Man’s shoes on 
sax. But it was a gifted guest who drew out of Springsteen the kind of 
emotive, inspired interplay that made the old Boss and Big Man chemistry
 so joyous to watch. Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine and the 
Nightwatchman joined the band for several songs, adding his bent-metal 
cries to their already stellar guitar lineup. (All hail Nils Lofgren and
 Little Steven Van Zandt. Springsteen ain’t no slouch at the ax either.)<br>
<br>
On the haunting 1995 protest ballad “The Ghost of Tom Joad,” Morello 
proclaimed the lyrics inspired by "The Grapes of Wrath": “Wherever 
there's somebody fightin' for a place to stand/ Or decent job or a 
helpin' hand / Wherever somebody's strugglin' to be free / Look in their
 eyes, Mom, you'll see me.”<br>
<br>
 <br>
Then stroking, beating, hugging and pounding his custom Arm the Homeless
 guitar, Morello made it a sword, a trumpet, a beat box, a megaphone. It
 was an ear-shattering, time-stopping performance to which the audience 
played mesmerized witness. Tom Joad was there, and Clemons, and deceased
 E Street keyboardist Danny Federici too.<br>
The evening was not morbid. Ultimately, it was about love and life. 
Springsteen dusted off “The Ties That Bind,” finding its doo-wop heart 
with his wife Patti Scialfa on harmony. There were “new faces and old 
faces,” as he said early on. A horn section and the two-membered E 
Street choir added new blood to the storied band. Most of the players — 
the mighty Max Weinberg, good-guy bassist Garry Tallent, mastermind 
pianist Roy Bittan — have been with their boss for decades.<br>
<br>
One of the things that makes Springsteen the greatest musical performer 
of our time is the deep love with which he ministers to his flock. The 
arena was filled with a rare vibe, a feeling of brotherly and sisterly 
(Springsteen danced with his younger sibling on “Dancing in the Dark”) 
love. When’s the last time the big Canadian strangers next to you bought
 you and your husband a beer during an arena show?<br>
<br>
From “The Rising” after 9/11 to “My City in Ruins” post-Katrina to 
99-percenter testimonials such as “Jack of All Trades” (performed with 
stark, brutal power Thursday) off his new album, “Wrecking Ball,” 
Springsteen has an unmatched gift for expressing our national pain — and
 also delivering us from it. “Keep pushing till it’s understood and 
these badlands start treating us good,” he sang in the show’s opener, 
his 1978 classic “Badlands.” The magnitude of his personal loss made the
 catharsis Thursday that much more deeply felt.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and the band barely paused during the 2 hour and 40 minute 
concert. Dripping sweat, the sexagenarian even slid across the stage on 
his knees in his trademark fashion.<br>
<br>
This was perhaps the most inspirational show I’ve witnessed in 30 years 
of attending thousands of concerts, including at least a dozen by 
Springsteen. There was maybe one better: When he played Jazz Fest in New
 Orleans after Katrina and turned the city of ruins into a city reborn. 
But Morello’s lead on “Ghost of Tom Joad” will be forever seared into my
 conscience as a testimonial, and a hope.</div>

'NO NUKES,' A MELANGE OF MUSICIANS<br>
<br>
The New York Times<br>
<br>
By JANET MASLIN<br>
''NO NUKES'' is a lively, likable concert movie, and it achieves its 
vitality without a strain. The performers, whether seen on stage or 
backstage or at planning meetings, mingle comfortably, and they are 
captured without any particular fanfare. Far from diminishing the 
movie's forcefulness, this low-keyed approach draws the audience close. 
The resulting footage is as warm as it is tuneful.<br>
<br>
The in-concert camerawork, supervised by Haskell Wexler and Barbara 
Kopple, is particularly effective in fostering a feeling of coziness. 
The shows are photographed on such an intimate scale that the setting 
feels less like Madison Square Garden, where the series of No Nukes 
concerts were held, than the living room of somebody's home. Performers 
wander onto the stage without much introduction -near the beginning of 
the film, James Taylor simply appears before the audience, begins to 
sing ''Mockingbird,'' and is joined by Carly Simon from the wings. 
Although the list of performers, which also includes Jackson Browne, 
Bruce Springsteen, Bonnie Raitt and the Doobie Brothers, would seem to 
be diverse, they trade off songs so smoothly during the concerts that 
they seem to have been cut from the same cloth.<br>
<br>
The music of ''No Nukes,'' which opens today at Cinema I, is sturdier 
than its politics. It is made clear by the film's three credited 
directors, Danny Goldberg, Julian Schlossberg and Anthony Potenza, that 
the musicians on the bill, who worked to organize the concerts and 
performed free of charge, oppose the use of nuclear power and are 
greatly interested in this cause. (Some, like Graham Nash, who says 
something about having seen ''actual photographs of giant sponges'' at 
an underwater nuclear-waste dump near his California home, sound more 
enthusiastic than knowledgable.) And ''No Nukes'' includes a documentary
 segment, apparently shown during intermissions of the concerts, in 
which a man dying of leukemia describes his experience of witnessing an 
early atomic-bomb test. This man's testimony is the most deeply 
affecting evidence the movie offers.<br>
<br>
The movie makes a simple point about the singers' allegiance to the 
antinuclear movement, but it never tackles the trickier matter of how 
they perceive their own political influence. Nor does it reveal much 
about the planning of the concerts, although the requisite juggling must
 have been fascinating. To its credit, though, the film makes none of 
the flashy generalizations to which rock movies are prone; if anything, 
it draws no conclusions at all. It simply show the concerts, glimpses 
the backstage activity, covers the enormous rally at Battery Park, and 
sits by quietly as Crosby, Stills and Nash crank out the same material 
they were singing at Woodstock. It seems that some things never change.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The music ranges from that of the 
aforementioned Crosby, Stills and Nash (who declare ''Not quite!'' about
 their harmonies during a rehearsal, and are understating the case 
considerably) to Bruce Springsteen, who steals the show. Mr. 
Springsteen, who makes his movie debut here, proves that in performance 
he is indeed a thing of beauty. His rendition of ''Thunder Road'' is 
wonderful, and his histrionics even more so: after leaping all over the 
stage during this song, he feigns a collapse, complaining ''I can't go 
on like this! I'm 30 years old! My heart is startin' to go!'' The 
members of his E Street Band affect concern, then coax him up for the 
count. After this, he bursts into a furious chorus of ''Quarter to 
Three,'' and all is presumably well. When ''No Nukes'' cuts away from 
Mr. Springsteen to another backstage planning session, the comedown is 
considerable.</strong><br>
<br>
Jackson Browne's version of ''Running on Empty'' is another of the 
show's highlights, as are the Doobie Brothers' ''What a Fool Believes'' 
and John Hall's antinuclear anthem, ''Power.'' (Like several of the 
other songs, ''Power'' sounds considerably better here than it did on 
the ''No Nukes'' triple album released some months ago; in fact, the 
material in the movie overlaps only slightly that on the records.) Carly
 Simon puts in a brief but sensational appearance, mostly singing with 
her husband, Mr. Taylor. Mr. Taylor's eyes twinkle with a mad gleam that
 is shown off to particularly merry advantage on the movie screen.<br>
<br>
This movie has been rated PG (''Parental Guidance Suggested''). It contains occasional harsh language. <br>
<br>
Music of Protest <br>
<br>
NO NUKES, documentary based on the 1979 concerts and rally protesting 
nuclear energy's use, directed and produced by Julian Schlossberg and 
Danny Goldberg; also directed by Anthony Potenza; cinematographer, 
Haskell Wexler; released by Warner Bros. At the Cinema I, Third Avenue 
and 60th Street. Running time: 103 minutes. This film is rated PG. WITH:
 Jackson Browne, David Crosby, The Doobie Brothers, John Hall, Graham 
Nash, Bonnie Raitt, Gil Scott-Heron, Carly Simon, Bruce Springsteen, 
Stephen Stills, James Taylor and Jesse Colin Young.</div>

<br>
Neil McCormick was amazed by Bruce Springsteen's powerful performance, which featured a guest appearance by Sir Paul McCartney.<br>
<br>
By Neil McCormick Jul 15 2012<br>
<br>
The Boss meets The Beatles. Paul McCartney joined Bruce Springsteen for 
the climax of his concert at Hyde Park, storming through I Saw Her 
Standing There, with Springsteen beaming “I’ve waited 50 years for 
this.” And then, while two of the world’s most legendary rock stars 
ripped into a historic, glorious, celebratory, extended romp through 
Twist And Shout, some joyless jobsworth from Westminster City Council 
turned the PA off.<br>
It’s the first time I have heard a fade out at a concert. Unaware that 
they had been cut off for breaking the council’s curfew, the superstars 
played on in silence, listening to the sound of their onstage monitors 
and encouraged by the outraged roar of 60,000 fans, until guitarist 
Little Steven got the message across that their set had been summarily 
ended.<br>
Never mind. By that time, they had already played for three hours and 
half hours, and Springsteen left the stage still grinning. If anything, 
the sense of confrontation with killjoy officials might have added to 
the occasion, conferring upon this venerable form of rock and roll 
entertainment performed by wealthy veterans some of its old outlaw 
associations. At the heart of Springsteen’s songs are the struggles of 
ordinary people to survive against all the odds stacked against them by a
 merciless, uncaring state. So having a massive, communal celebration of
 working class values brought to an end by some anonymous government 
official seemed oddly appropriate. Maybe he should end all concerts like
 this.<br>
It was, in any case, one of the greatest gigs I have ever witnessed. I 
run out of superlatives with which to describe Springsteen. I meet 
plenty of sceptics in my travels, intelligent music fans who remain 
difficult to convince that this icon of blue collar rock can really be 
as great a live performer as his admirers claim. His image (amongst 
detractors) appears to be of a kind of stolid, worthy blue collar and 
blue jean showman fronting a jumped up American bar band, and if you put
 it like that, the length of his shows sounds more like torture than 
celebration. But if you haven’t seen Springsteen perform, then, really, 
you are no position to comment. I would have been happy if he had gone 
on for another hour. He plays sets that have grand dramatic dimensions, 
that rise and fall, carrying listeners on a journey, swelling from 
moments of stark, emotional intimacy to explosions of joy, anger and 
exultation. His band moves with him, adapting to the mood of the song 
and the moment, everything beneath his passionate vocals constantly 
shifting and changing. New colours and tones are brought into focus 
throughout, from the swinging horn section, gospelly backing singers, 
flamboyant violinist, dramatic organ and piano players and superb trio 
of lead guitarists (Nils Lofgren, Steven Van Zandt and Springsteen 
himself). There is a near religious aspect to a Springsteen show, he 
takes a lot of his stage mannerisms from the world of travelling 
charismatic preachers and he knows how to conduct an audience until 
their raised voices become a kind of rock and roll choir, and everybody 
feels part of something bigger than themselves. To see Springsteen is to
 believe in the power of music.<br>
Highlights? There were so many. He strolled on to casually open this 
massive concert with a solo vocal and piano version of Thunder Road that
 was slow and expressive and completely reinvented one of his most loved
 anthems, digging out its mournful heart. The River was elegant and sad 
with a fantastic, uplifting chorus. My City of Ruins was devastating, 
Born In The USA had a British crowd punching the air and bellowing the 
chorus with gusto, Glory Days was a spirited ensemble blast, and Nils 
Lofgren tore up Because The Night with a searing solo. Songs from his 
latest album were every bit the equal of his established classics. The 
epic shifts and angry surge of Wrecking Ball were stunning, Jack Of All 
Trades burned with mournful anger, and the singalong gospel optimism of 
Land And Hope And Dreams turned the massed ranks of muddy Hyde Park 
revellers into London’s greatest ever community singers. For me, the 
very best of it was a burning, electric version of The Ghost Of Tom Joad
 with Rage Against The Machine’s Tom Morello delivering one of the most 
wild and eccentric guitar solos you will ever hear.<br>
But it was all great. All three and a half hours of it, through rain and
 shine, from Thunder Road to the final unplanned fade out. It’s a gig 
that will go down in history.</div>

BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN &amp; THE E STREET BAND<br>
Live in New York City<br>
</strong><br>
Sony $24.97 .<br>
<br>
If Bruce Springsteen's 1986 five-LP boxed set of live recordings brought
 down the curtain on the first act of his remarkable career, "Live in 
New York City" may well mark the opening of the third. Even as this 
two-disc document from his 1999-2000 reunion tour with the E Street Band
 hits stores Tuesday, Springsteen and that old gang of his have returned
 to a New York recording studio to cut new songs and move forward into 
the future together again.<br>
<br>
The reunion tour with the E Street Band was not just a simple 
celebration of glory days, a nostalgic tribute to past triumphs. It was a
 contemplation on old friends and the ties that bind. The opening salvo 
of "My Love Will Not Let You Down" and "Prove It All Night" set that 
stage, as Springsteen and company rummage through fresh corners of their
 songbook and reconnect in new and exciting ways. They draw enormous 
strength from one another, from being together as a band again, and that
 swagger spills out of the speakers on the new record.<br>
<br>
The first 13 songs of the 19-song collection serve as the soundtrack to 
an HBO concert documentary that airs at 9 p.m. Saturday. The first disc 
builds through the rousing opening, past a swelling "Atlantic City," 
through the elegiac "Mansion on the Hill" (with Springsteen and his 
wife, Patti Scialfa, gently yodeling the song to a close) and into an 
extended, doleful "The River. " As the set careens toward a finish 
through a blistering "Youngstown," "Murder Incorporated," "Badlands" and
 into the jubilant "Out in the Street," the record moves steadily toward
 its first explosive, cathartic climax.<br>
<br>
A 16-minute version of "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out," where Springsteen runs
 through a lengthy, showy set of band introductions, leads to the set's 
second climax, a one-two punch of previously unrecorded new songs -- 
"Land of Hope and Dreams" and "American Skin (41 Shots)." The 
juxtaposition of these two songs, the closing numbers on the HBO 
broadcast, offers both sides of the American dream. While "Land of Hope 
and Dreams," a train song in the classic tradition, revels in the great 
possibilities of life, "American Skin" is the dark, bitter reality.<br>
<br>
The latter, which stirred controversy last year when an unofficial live 
version first hit the Internet, refers to the case of Amadou Diallo, a 
black man shot to death in the Bronx by four plainclothes police 
officers who mistook him for a rape suspect. When Diallo reached into 
his pocket to produce his wallet and identification, the police opened 
fire, pumping 41 bullets into his body. All four were acquitted of all 
charges.<br>
<br>
Every song is an epic. All the pieces are fat, with long, rich 
instrumental passages, crescendos and crashing waves of big rock sound. 
This kind of extravagant bombast may sound great in a concert hall, but 
it can wear thin at home. Saxophonist Clarence Clemons seems to play the
 same solo over and over. But the vitality and joy that these nine 
musicians share is a palpable part of the production. Let's call it a 
bookmark and eagerly await the next chapter.</div>

<br>
Joshunda Sanders, <br>
<br>
San Francisco Chronicle <br>
 August 18, 2003<br>
</strong><br>
Three blocks from Pac Bell Park on the anniversary of Elvis' death 
Saturday, a small congregation took over Burger Island. Two rows of 
tables pressed together and littered with paper baskets containing 
veggie burgers and Coca- Cola cups were clearly reserved. Two laminated 
tags proclaimed, in bold black letters, "The Church of Bruce." Three 
other round tables near the front window were more specific. "This 
Train: Northern California's Springsteen Fans," read white sheets of 
paper tucked under ketchup and mustard bottles.<br>
<br>
A group of 30-plus fans met in 1999 after reading a posted invitation 
for Bay Area Springsteen fans on a now-defunct Web site. What started 
out as a tailgate party has turned into something like a support group 
for classic rock 'n' roll fans. Whether they gather in a parking lot, 
pizza parlor or burger joint, they use the few hours before a Bruce show
 to chat about the one thing they have in common: Springsteen love.<br>
<br>
Billy Bradford, 47, of Castro Valley, is the leader of this itinerant 
church. By profession, he is an information systems manager for a law 
firm. By calling, he is enamored of all things Springsteen. A freckled, 
thin man in silver-rimmed glasses with a cell phone holstered on his 
snug blue jeans, Bradford says he likes sincere songwriters -- and Bruce
 is the epitome of sincerity. He first heard Springsteen in 1975 and has
 been a fan ever since. Whenever Springsteen is "west of Texas, 
basically," Bradford snatches up tickets from backstreets.com.<br>
<br>
"A lot of times when you're young, the words might mean something like 
'I love you,' " Bradford says. "But he was telling stories, and if you 
pay attention, some of these songs can make you cry. Music had never 
done that for me before."<br>
<br>
As Frank McCourt wrote about last week's blackout in New York, everyone 
has a story about where they were when name-the-event happened. Here, 
talk revolves around tour dates, Bruce sightings, T-shirts and lyrics. 
Although many seem to be in their 40s with children or new poodles, they
 represent a variety of professions, from teaching to advertising. They 
love all kinds of music, from Cher to Good Charlotte. Except for, and 
maybe because of, the fact that some of them organize their vacations to
 see Bruce and friends and family all over the country when he's on 
tour, they're all pretty normal.<br>
<br>
By 3 in the afternoon, Bradford had given the Burger Island owner a few 
of his Springsteen CDs to play. The restaurant was empty except for This
 Train members. By 4 p.m., buzz about the Boss had begun. After tucking a
 few dollars into buckets Bradford bought for donations to the San 
Francisco Food Bank, each person had a story about how his or her love 
affair with Bruce began.<br>
<br>
Maureen Ford and Kim Ross, both 45, of Palo Alto are partners. Maureen, 
Kim says, is the bigger Springsteen fan. Both are wearing shirts from 
different tours. The Pac Bell show would be Ford's sixth Springsteen 
show this year. She said it with pride; many This Train member knows the
 exact number of shows he or she has to and rattles off numbers such as 
45 or 100 or "too many to remember" with an air of nostalgia. "It's just
 so worth it," Ford says. "Bruce just feeds my soul. You don't have to 
get it, I guess. But it's so overwhelming. His songs say something, they
 mean something; they touch me. I get emotional."<br>
<br>
Bradford interjects: "Friday, I heard 'Land of Hope and Dreams' on the BART platform and I started to cry."<br>
<br>
"It's like a religion, you just can't explain it," Ford says, returning to her veggie burger.<br>
<br>
By 4 p.m., more of This Train has arrived. Aram Anthony comes in with 
his new T-shirt from Pac Bell. It reads "Sold Out" on the back. 
Conversations stop,<br>
<br>
people pause. He's also wearing a new hat that no one comments on. A 
woman skirts behind him to see what's on the back. "That's what I'm 
talking about!" a man shouts.<br>
<br>
There was enough excitement over the shirt that, by 5 p.m., Ford and a 
woman named Marie had been to the dugout store and back. Eileen Meehan, 
who saw Springsteen in Ireland and was unexpectedly caught on camera 
with her hands clasped together as if she were praying, says, "He is 
simply the real thing. He gives us hope love and faith and a damn good 
party," she says. Her hair is a graying bob, and she's wearing a tank 
top announcing Bruce Springsteen and the E Street band in orange 
lettering. "It's like church. I get spiritually uplifted. And then I get
 drenched because it's also like a real rock 'n' roll party. Where else 
can you get that?"<br>
<br>
On her way to see what shape the lines were in at the ballpark, Meehan 
had heard about a Bruce sighting. She circulated the information 
accordingly. "I just missed Bruce," she said, half-smiling. "He was 
outside signing autographs . . . and I missed him." After she's 
mentioned this to a few people, she says, "Oh well, maybe next time."<br>
<br>
Anthony, 42, who met Bradford on BART, has good reason to be fascinated 
with Bruce. "Essentially, my thoughts were being fed back to me," 
Anthony says.<br>
<br>
He pauses and begins to tell a story about a concert he went to in 1990.
 "Bruce starts telling this story about how he used to drive past his 
ex- girlfriends' houses. And so he asks his therapist, 'Why?' And the 
therapist says, 'It's because something's broke and you're trying to fix
 it.' "<br>
<br>
Anthony pushes up his glasses. "I was like, 'Hey, I do that.' But 
immediately after the show, the behavior stopped. It was like free 
therapy."<br>
<br>
Heidi Miller, a petite Asian American woman, is playing electronic 
Yahtzee. Her husband, Neil, is on his cell phone. Their son, Wyatt, 10, 
is wearing a Springsteen T-shirt and looking at people on the street. A 
man says, "Neil is a true Bruce fan. His son can't afford to go to 
college because Neil follows Bruce around." People start chuckling and 
Neil smirks. "Well, that's why he gets to wear the T-shirt," he answers.<br>
<br>
Neil Miller calls Bruce shows "transformative." He just returned from a show in Chicago.<br>
<br>
Bradford explains a Bruce performance this way: "During the show you get
 transported, you sing all the words because you know them all, even 
though you've heard that song 20 times, it's all good. You throw your 
arms up in the air, and you get lost and it's great."<br>
<br>
Heidi Miller, encourages her husband's adoration. "I think it's better, 
cheaper and less time-consuming than golf," she says. Hearing this, Neil
 Miller says he started going to Springsteen shows when tickets were 
just $6.50;<br>
<br>
now they're $75. And worth every penny. "You just don't see that many 
cross- racial, cross-gender groups anymore, or people talking about the 
issues."<br>
<br>
By 5:30 p.m., concertgoers and passers-by are just looking for a burger.
 They have to squeeze past a group of fans near the door to get to the 
counter. Miller's brother, dressed in black and donning a Springsteen 
shirt, rallies the fans by yelling, "Bruuuce!" every time a familiar 
face walks in. It's an infectious rallying cry, even if it raises a few 
eyebrows among regular customers who have sequestered themselves to 
tables in the back.<br>
<br>
"A lot of it isn't the concert itself," Bradford says. "It's the camaraderie with all of your friends, and your family."<br>
<br>
Even before the group left and cleaned up and prepared themselves to see
 Springsteen, they were planning trips to his other shows. Bradford had a
 highlighted seating chart; people started figuring out where they'd be 
in relation to one another and, of course, Bruce. Bradford's son, 
Desmond, 8, arrived just in time for the start of the show in a blue and
 white Springsteen shirt.<br>
<br>
Meehan, pausing before she left for the show, describes the Church of 
Bruce this way: "We go through a lot of trials and tribulations in our 
lives and he gives us the courage to not give up and plunge through the 
hard times and make hard choices."<br>
<br>
Another fan, Eileen O'Neill, nods her head. "No fireworks, no sexy girls or psychedelic lights (at his shows)," she adds.<br>
<br>
"And he doesn't need it," Meehan says. "That's the magic of Bruce."</div>

				<div class="content">Springsteen’s Family Tragedy, Tough Nuns Recalled: Book Review<br>
David Wilson,<br>
November 13, 2012<br>
  <br>
Nov. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Bruce Springsteen’s life has long been a mystery 
compared with his work. Peter Ames Carlin’s “Bruce” fixes that.<br>
<br>
Carlin delves into the Boss’s family background and personality for a 
perspective largely absent from Dave Marsh’s “Born to Run” and “Glory 
Days,” which have until now been the definitive biographies.<br>
<br>
The book benefits from the depth of Carlin’s reporting. He interviewed 
Springsteen himself as well as members of the musician’s family, current
 and former band mates and others.<br>
<br>
Plenty of rough spots are covered: family relationships in the ’50 and 
’60s, comings and goings of girlfriends in the ’70s, tensions with his E
 Street Band that led to its firing in the ’80s, and a search for 
musical direction in the ’90s that culminated in the band’s reunion.<br>
<br>
The book begins with the family’s roughest moment: the death of 
Springsteen’s father’s sister, Virginia, as a 5-year- old. She was hit 
by a truck while riding her tricycle in April 1927. The death created a 
void that went unfilled until Bruce’s birth in September 1949, as the 
book recounts.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s family lived with his paternal grandparents at first, and 
his grandmother set few rules for him, Carlin says. Four-year-old Bruce 
stayed up until the middle of the night, as he later did as a musician.<br>
<br>
<br>
Starting School<br>
<br>
<br>
His grandmother’s lack of discipline contrasted with his mother’s 
approach: When he was ready for elementary school, she sent him to St. 
Rose of Lima, the local Catholic school. Carlin quotes Springsteen as 
saying he was caught between these women as he was later with his first 
two managers, Mike Appel and Jon Landau, and then with Landau and band 
mate Steve Van Zandt.<br>
<br>
Carlin touches on the anger Springsteen felt at the rules imposed by the
 school’s nuns. That anger would later resurface in relationships with 
women, on concert stages, in courtrooms and elsewhere, as the book 
chronicles.<br>
<br>
The most insightful observation in “Bruce” may be one pertaining to his 
time in elementary school: “For Bruce, his tendency for social isolation
 came as naturally as his secret desire to be at the center of 
everything.”<br>
<br>
<br>
Conflicting Goals<br>
<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s personality conflict helps explain why he adamantly 
opposed stadium concerts, music videos, marketing campaigns and other 
moves at first and then reversed himself.<br>
<br>
Yet Carlin presents the changes of heart without exploring the mindset 
that drove them. This is one reason why “Bruce” doesn’t render Marsh’s 
biographies and other books about Springsteen obsolete.<br>
<br>
Another is that not everyone in Springsteen’s story gets into the book. 
There’s no mention of Maria Espinosa, the first girl he ever kissed, 
though she was identified in the unreleased song “In Freehold.” Jim 
McDuffie, an assistant for much of the 1980s, is also unnamed. The 
omissions are telling.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s interest in Espinosa, who was Hispanic, was at odds with 
the racial divisions in his hometown and elsewhere during the 1960s. So 
was his high-school friendship with Richard Blackwell, an 
African-American who played congas on “The Wild, the Innocent and the E 
Street Shuffle,” his second album.<br>
<br>
Those relationships foreshadowed the defining moment of his musical 
career: meeting Clarence Clemons, the African-American saxophonist later
 known as the Big Man, in September 1971. The encounter occurred about a
 year after race riots in the city.<br>
<br>
<br>
Charitable Work<br>
<br>
<br>
McDuffie still works for Springsteen as executive director of The 
Foundation, which helps lower-income homeowners in New Jersey pay for 
house repairs. Carlin makes no mention of the Foundation or the Thrill 
Hill Foundation, a supporter of non- profit groups.<br>
<br>
The omissions reflect a cursory treatment of Springsteen’s charitable 
work, which goes beyond writing checks. He has made personal connections
 with the Community Food Bank of New Jersey and other groups. He 
routinely asks audiences to donate, rather than touting his own 
contributions.<br>
<br>
Also, “Bruce” would be better off without the footnotes sprinkled 
throughout the text. They bury details that deserve more prominence -- 
the origin of the E Street name, for one -- or provide snarky asides 
that distract from the narrative.<br>
<br>
The disruptions are a greater flaw because there’s so much story to get 
through, and it’s so compelling. Carlin has written a book that any 
Springsteen fan will appreciate, even with its shortcomings.</div>

Associated Press<br>
 May 9, 1995<br>
<br>
- Bruce Springsteen never intended to release a 1982 song titled "Murder Incorporated." A persistent fan made him do it.<br>
<br>
"For years, there's this guy that's been following me around with a 
'Murder Incorporated' sign," the rocker said in Sunday's New York Times.
 "I see him in the audience, like every five shows. I have never played 
the song, ever, in concert and would have no intent to do so, and yet 
this guy follows me around with this sign."<br>
<br>
So when Springsteen made his "Greatest Hits" album, he included the 
song, which has been circulating for years on bootleg recordings.<br>
<br>
"We said, 'Let's put this on for that guy, whoever he is,' " Springsteen said.<br>
<br>
A wise move. The song, about the proliferation of guns and the 
devaluation of human life, has become the first hit on Springsteen's 
latest album.</div>

				<div class="content">Concert Review: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, Gillette Stadium, August 2, 2008<br>
  <br>
 Lisa McKay — Published: Aug 04, 2008<br>
<br>
<br>
The thousands of people who crowded Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, 
Massachusetts on Saturday night had good reason to keep eyeing the 
skies. In direct defiance of the crowd's high spirits and high 
expectations, reports of bad weather on its way had been filtering in 
all afternoon and the dark clouds overhead didn't look as if they were 
about to clear anytime soon. Intermittent proclamations of thunder were 
punctuated by exclamation points of lightning while the skies grew ever 
darker.<br>
<br>
Finally, as befits a summer storm in New England, the skies opened up 
and released torrents of rain, more rain than I can remember seeing - or
 feeling - in a long time. For the first time on that hot, muggy day I 
felt a shiver of cold run through me as my clothing soaked through 
almost instantaneously. The thunder and lightning continued doing their 
call and response for a while longer, and while people were struggling 
with an assortment of plastic ponchos and makeshift trash bag wear, or 
just resigning themselves to the soaking, some of the crew assembled 
onstage and took pictures of it all.<br>
<br>
And yet nobody left. As the rain began to subside a little, the applause
 and chants from the sopping wet crowd swept over the stadium like a 
wave: "Bruuuuuuce..."<br>
<br>
The powers that be spent some time considering the prospects. Whoever 
controls the weather decided that our mettle had been tested and not 
found wanting, the band and the stadium management concurred, and at 
approximately 9:20, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band took the 
stage to a roar of approval.<br>
<br>
Plunging instantly into "Summertime Blues", Springsteen and the band got
 the evening off to a powerful start, and they proceeded to jump 
headfirst into a nearly three-hour long show that included some 
classics, one tour premiere, and one song (by request) that they hadn't 
performed since 1977. Springsteen's recent habit of collecting request 
placards from the audience and springing the surprises on the band lent 
an air of unpredictability and fun to an evening that leaned heavily on 
the more stadium-friendly material from Springsteen's arsenal.<br>
<br>
The Boss appeared to be in high spirits all evening, and the political 
gravitas that accompanied some of the earlier arena shows on this tour 
was notably absent. This show exemplified the E Street Band in full-on 
party mode, and the setlist offered up an interesting mix of the old, 
the new, and the unexpected. The old and new were bookended by Greetings
 From Asbury Park, NJ's "Spirit in the Night" and four songs from the 
band's most recent album, Magic. The unexpected occurred in the form of 
the first request the band played, "Little Latin Lupe Lu", which the 
band hadn't played since 1977. Other requests honored during the main 
set included "Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?" and concert staple 
"Hungry Heart". The tour premiere was, appropriately, John Fogerty's 
"Who'll Stop the Rain".<br>
<br>
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain<br>
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain<br>
Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party...<br>
<br>
The E Street Band is in great shape these days, the kind of shape that 
allows them to be loose and have fun without sacrificing their spot-on 
musicianship. Particularly notable on this night was Nils Lofgren's 
blistering guitar work which elevated several songs into the 
stratosphere. This show had a celebratory feel to it from beginning to 
end, and Springsteen played to the audience for all he's worth. The 
audience, of course, paid it back with interest, particularly on "Mary's
 Place" which Springsteen has turned into the kind of concert 
centerpiece that pulls out all the stops.<br>
<br>
The level of up close and personal interaction with the audience was 
enhanced by several mini-stages in front of the main ramp that allowed 
Springsteen to be surrounded by fans on three sides, and he didn't stop 
moving for an instant. Given that he's turning 59 next month, it's hard 
to know how many more of these shows are left in our collective future, 
but at present the man shows no signs of slowing down and kept up a pace
 for the duration of the concert that would have exhausted most people 
half his age.<br>
<br>
Band's countin' out midnight<br>
Floor's rumblin' loud<br>
Singer's callin' up daylight<br>
And waitin' for that shout from the crowd<br>
Waitin' for that shout from the crowd...<br>
<br>
If the main set left us all exhausted and jubilant, it was hard to see 
how Bruce and the band could possibly ramp it up even more for an 
encore, but on magical nights, magical things can and do happen. 
Wrapping up the show with an encore that included "Jungleland" and "Born
 to Run" and sent us home to the strains of "Rosalita", Bruce 
Springsteen and the E Street Band proved yet again that music has the 
power to transcend just about anything — including a summer storm. If 
three hours of jubilant singing along, dancing, crying, fist-pumping, 
and smiling yourself into exhaustion doesn't move you right down to the 
very marrow of your soul — if Clarence's sax solos don't send shivers 
down your spine — if being transported right out of your skin by 
something this passionate and this immediate doesn't change your life — 
you should probably check for a pulse.<br>

<br>
Washington Post<br>
<br>
November 13, 2007<br>
<br>
 Monday night was my first ever Springsteen live experience and I wanted
 to give a different take, since he's much more the Bruce expert than I 
am. (Don't worry, when that Pavement reunion tour hits town in 2011 I'll
 do the same for you.) So throughout the night I decided to pay close 
attention to the Big Man, Clarence Clemons.<br>
<br>
When the house lights first went down and all 10 members of the band 
emerged, there was Clarence, looking a whole lot like the Undertaker, 
dressed in dark clothes and slowly walking to his stage right area. Big 
Man Land consisted of a stand that held a pair of saxophones, a pair of 
tambourines and various other percussive instruments. He also had a 
chair directly behind him, because hey, if Roy Bittan gets to sit down, 
Clarence gets to sit down sometimes as well. After the jump, check out 
another song-by-song rundown, except this time the focus will be solely 
on Clemons. <br>
Radio Nowhere: The Big Man starts the concert off playing ... a 
washboard? It's true. He emerged from his stage right spot for a sax 
solo later in the song.<br>
<br>
The Ties That Bind:: A simple tambourine for this song, before getting 
another solo, giving him a perfect 1.000 batting average so far. He 
certainly wasn't needed on guitar since this was one of a handful of 
songs in the set that featured five guitarists.<br>
<br>
Lonesome Day:: Clarence went with the double tambourine for this one before emerging for a brief solo. Half credit for that one.<br>
<br>
Gypsy Biker: More percussion for the Big Man, this time on shakers. But 
he may as well have taken this song off because he wasn't even close to 
being on the beat. But he wasn't even close to being near a microphone, 
either.<br>
<br>
Magic: Another song with no saxophone part, so Clemons took a brief rest
 in his chair. This wasn't just your average folding chair, it was one 
of those futuristic-looking game show chairs, the kind you'd see on "Who
 Wants to Be a Millionaire?"<br>
<br>
Reason to Believe: Bruce wails away on harmonica on this bluesy shuffle,
 Clarence is back on tambourine duty before getting back into action on 
the sax.<br>
<br>
Jackson Cage: And back to tambourine.<br>
<br>
She's the One: Double shakers on this one before he rips off a big solo.
 This was one of my favorites of the night: Max Weinberg was seriously 
rocking that classic Bo Diddley beat.<br>
<br>
Livin' in the Future: The Big Man gets another solo, but the best part 
of this song was when Bruce was in the middle of his political rant 
before the song started and the guy behind me says to his friend, "I'm 
going to the bathroom."<br>
<br>
The Promised Land: It's the usual tambourine into sax solo for Clemons 
here. How do you think Nils Lofgren feels about being positioned next to
 Clarence? When the band first hit the stage it was pretty daunting. 
There's Bruce! There's the Big Man! There's Silvio! There's Mighty Max 
Weinberg. There's ... Chris Kattan?! Oh, I kid, it was obviously the 
diminutive local legend Lofgren. You think he might be able to swap 
spots with Steve Van Zandt, but I guess Lofgren doesn't much care about 
those things, as well he shouldn't.<br>
<br>
Town Called Heartbreak: During this Patti Scialfa song, Clarence joined 
the rest of the sold-out crowd by resting his legs. Really, who could 
blame him?<br>
<br>
Backstreets: After the previous song you knew Bruce would have to 
seriously make up for it and he did so in a big way. No saxophone for 
Clarence on this one, but he showed off some new form on the tambourine.
 Two shakes, then a longer shake as he moved across his body, left to 
right. Have to keep things fresh, I suppose.<br>
<br>
Working on the Highway: Another highlight of the set, Clemons was seated
 for the beginning of this one before rising for some tambourine action.
 At one point in the middle of the song Bruce called out to him and it 
seemed to catch the Big Man off guard as he shot the Boss a puzzled "Get
 off my lawn!" look. Bruce probably just wanted him to chime in with a 
solo and Clemons was more than happy to oblige.<br>
<br>
Devil's Arcade: Clarence takes a seat for this slow, somber tune. He 
seemed to be playing some combination of bells and a drumstick, but it's
 pretty inconsequential.<br>
<br>
The Rising: The old double tambourine for this one before a brief 
saxophone part. Including half credits, I have him at 8-for-15 at this 
point.<br>
<br>
Last to Die: Back to the washboard for this one, although it doesn't 
seem to have his full attention. He spends much of this song arranging 
his tambourines, making sure they don't slide off their resting places.<br>
<br>
Long Walk Home: The Big Man rings them bells before blasting off a solo.<br>
<br>
Badlands: He starts off on tambourine, but we all know what's coming here. One of his best solos doesn't disappoint at all.<br>
<br>
Girls in Their Summer Clothes: I'll agree with J. Freedom that this song
 is pretty much pure cheese, but Clemons stayed busy. He started with 
bells, moved on to double tambourine and finished out with a solo. He 
even took some time to straighten out his black fedora before blowing 
those first few notes.<br>
<br>
Thunder Road: After being a forgotten man for much of the middle of the 
set, Clarence is getting a chance to shine at the end. Another fantastic
 solo in this one after starting out on tambourine.<br>
<br>
Born to Run: OK, I'll admit I didn't notice what the Big Man was doing 
before knocking another solo out of the park. Once the house lights went
 up I couldn't help but look around the arena and just take in the sheer
 joy. People with arms around each other, giddily singing along. Arena 
shows can certainly feel impersonal at times, but this one resonated 
with every single person in the arena.<br>
<br>
Dancing in the Dark: I was very glad this one got the repeat treatment. 
This song has always made me laugh, for two reasons. First, the original
 video. I'm sad to report that Clarence did not clap along last night as
 he does in that link. Second, the parody of the video from when 
Courtney Cox hosted "Saturday Night Live" back in the '90s. Adam Sandler
 does a pretty good Boss impression, except for the letter R. Listen for
 it. And the SNL writers were smart enough to include clips of the Big 
Man clapping along.<br>
<br>
American Land: Clemons finishes the evening off on ... recorder. So he 
starts on washboard and ends with recorder, fair enough. Final tally 
below.<br>
<br>
Saxophone: 15 songs, 13 full-fledged solos, two half-credit solos<br>
Tambourine: 14 songs, including 3 double tambourine<br>
Bells: 3 songs<br>
Shakers: 2 songs<br>
Washboard: 2 songs<br>
Recorder: 1 song<br>

				<div class="content">Music Matters: Why Feminists* Love Bruce Springsteen<br>
Music post by Sarah Jaffe, Submitted by Sarah Jaffe on November 8, 2010 -
 9:44am; tagged Bruce Springsteen, politics, rock'n'roll.<br>
*By "feminists" I mean me.<br>
<br>
Not long ago, I got into a conversation on Twitter about why feminists 
love Bruce Springsteen. Of course I can't speak for all feminists or 
even most feminists, but I can certainly discuss my love for 
Springsteen. And it seems only right to follow talk about Johnny Cash 
and U.S. politics with discussion of the other oft-misappropriated 
American blue-collar icon who's a major influence in my life.<br>
<br>
Because yeah, Bruce and Johnny: that's what the men in my life have to live up to.<br>
<br>
(OK, not really.)<br>
<br>
I should credit Emma Forrest for reintroducing me to Springsteen as a 
semi-adult, in her novel Namedropper. But it was really a road trip with
 my mother, during which we ran out of music we could both stand quickly
 driving from South Carolina to New Hampshire, and stopped at a Best Buy
 highwayside to dig for something else.<br>
<br>
I ended up with a Best of Bruce and we blasted it across New Jersey, 
which is the only proper way to drive the New Jersey turnpike. Bruce is 
the patron saint of the country's most-abused state, the one that pays 
the most in taxes and receives the least back.<br>
<br>
Most people who've embodied the Myth of America are Southern or Western,
 but Bruce is solidly Northeast Suburban and so am I. His America is one
 I can relate to, one in which the brickyard-working half of my family 
mixes with the Ivy League Jewish half, one where my mother's love for 
fast cars and my dad's keep-your-head-down-and-work ethos all meet.<br>
<br>
Reagan tried to claim Bruce and I still have a hard time with "Born in 
the USA" even though I know what it really means. Bruce provided the 
theme song for The Wrestler and performed "This Land is Your Land" with 
Pete Seeger at the inauguration, celebrating the broken and laughable 
while never laughing on the one hand and calling us to remember the best
 of us on the other. He played the Super Bowl not long after, and then 
last year he gave a song and an intimate performance to Howard Zinn's 
The People Speak.<br>
<br>
So what does this have to do with feminism? Again, models for 
masculinity. Bruce doesn't ask anyone to give up their pleasure in these
 sorts of male ideals—he's the fast-car-driving, football-loving, 
patriotic guy who even likes pro wrestling. He just asks us to critique 
them.<br>
<br>
War is the most obvious one—again, "Born in the USA"—but his The Rising 
is the other best response to 9/11 (with Sleater-Kinney's One Beat) and 
when he played its title track at the inauguration it gave me chills of 
something set right after seven years of being oh so wrong. He looks up 
at that day from the point of view of the workers and the everyday 
people who weren't spouting platitudes about "with us or against us," 
but focusing on the ways you get by when your way of life is shaken.<br>
<br>
And of course, for me, the point is class baby, class. There's not a lot
 of working-class points of view that don't get an airing in a 
Springsteen song, from factory workers, to highway patrolmen, to migrant
 workers risking death crossing the border, and even a sex worker or 
two.<br>
<br>
The New York Times this weekend ran a lovely feature on Bruce ahead of 
the release of a three-CD, three-DVD boxed set, “The Promise: The 
Darkness on the Edge of Town Story.” The piece closes with this:<br>
<br>
“I went back to where I was from, and I looked into that world and those
 lives, which I understood was only tangentially going to be my life 
from there on in,” he said, as the fire behind him burned. “But if I was
 dedicated to it, and if I thought hard enough about it, and if I put in
 my time, I could tell those stories well. And that’s what I did.”<br>
<br>
And that's it, really. He knew he was leaving behind that working-class 
world and knew he'd have to work to retain his roots there—but he's been
 willing to do that work where many others haven't been.<br>
<br>
And Bruce on women (finally, she gets to the damn point):<br>
<br>
He's been critiqued for his use of the phrase "little girl," but I love 
Bruce's women. From Mary from "Thunder Road" (my favorite) who ain't a 
beauty but yeah she's alright, and isn't looking for a savior but just 
someone else to run away for a while on the open road, to Rosalita and 
Wendy of "Born to Run," Bruce gives you women who are real, who you (or 
at least I) can see yourself in.<br>
<br>
He explores relationships and feelings in a thousand complex ways 
instead of writing the same falling-in-love or getting-heartbroken song 
over again. I don't have time or space here to list them all, but I 
think the best I can say, the best explanation I can give, is that Bruce
 writes of real life, of the tiny moments in it that transcend, yes, but
 also the struggles and heartaches of everyday existence. That he writes
 from the point of view of a (now quite wealthy) white heterosexual man 
but one who understands and loves women as people as well.<br>
<br>
I don't know if I've even come close to explaining Why Feminists* Love 
Bruce Springsteen. But at least I've scratched the surface on why this 
particular feminist does. And if I haven't convinced you yet, well...<br>

				<div class="content">Why I love ‘Born To Run’ by Bruce Springsteen<br>
<br>
Billy Hepfinger<br>
<br>
Has there ever been a rock album quite like Born to Run? As a young 
person it’s easy to grow up listening to “Born in the U.S.A.” and “Glory
 Days” and thinking that Bruce Springsteen is essentially a glorified 
heartland rocker, in the vein of Bob Seger or John Mellencamp. And early
 in his career, Springsteen had already been hailed as the next Dylan 
after his first two albums, 1973′s Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. and 
The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle, thanks in part to a 
proclivity toward lyric-heavy songs like “Blinded by the Light” and 
“Growin’ Up.” But with the release of Born to Run in 1975, Springsteen 
established himself as a bona fide rock ‘n’ roll revivalist: a devout 
acolyte of Elvis, Roy Orbison, and, maybe more than anyone, producer 
Phil Spector, whose lush arrangements were responsible for the iconic 
“girl group” sound of the ’60s (and the oft-maligned orchestra 
backgrounds on the Beatles’ Let It Be album). Born to Run is an album of
 dualities – entrapment and rebellion, joy and sorrow, hope and despair.
 But more than anything, it’s an album that aimed to synthesize 
Springsteen’s ratty, working-class, quintessentially urban personality 
with the saccharine sheen of 1950s and ’60s pop. The result is something
 entirely unique: a rock ‘n’ roll opus that moves effortlessly from the 
backstreets to the front porch to the boardwalk, encapsulating exactly 
what it means to be young and restless and out of control.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s characters hit triumphant highs and crushing lows 
throughout the album, from the fearless strut of “Tenth Avenue 
Freeze-Out” to the bitter despair of “Backstreets,” but the one constant
 among the album’s eight songs is that underlying feeling of 
restlessness. On Born to Run, the urge to get up and go, to do 
something, motivates every track. Sometimes it’s the need to skip town 
and chase some nameless dream: on “Thunder Road,” Bruce sings, “It’s a 
town full of losers / And I’m pullin’ out of here to win”; and the title
 track, of course, sums it up best: “Baby, this town rips the bones from
 your back / It’s a death trap, it’s a suicide rap / We gotta get out 
while we’re young.” On other tracks, though, Springsteen’s restlessness 
takes other forms, like the search for meaning in the sprawling, 
mythical cityscapes of “Jungleland” or the unadulterated lust of “She’s 
the One.” Sometimes there’s hope – on “Born to Run,” the singer is sure 
that he and his girl will “get to that place where we really wanna go, 
and we’ll walk in the sun” – and sometimes you know there’s no chance, 
as in the doomed rendezvous that takes place in “Meeting Across the 
River.”<br>
<br>
“When the Scooter and the Big Man bust this city in half…”<br>
<br>
But regardless of the outcome, one of Springsteen’s greatest 
achievements on Born to Run is his complete commitment to the stakes of 
whatever it is he’s singing about. His topics are mundane and often 
childish, but you never get the impression he isn’t dead-serious. 
“Jungleland” is a song about a bunch of slacker kids bumming around 
late-night New York City, trolling the jukeboxes and looking for some 
cheap thrills. But Bruce sees an “opera out on the turnpike…a ballet 
being fought out in the alley.” In his mind, these hoodrats are fighting
 a neverending battle for their souls – they “explode into rock ‘n’ roll
 bands” and “try to make an honest stand.” Springsteen infuses the grit 
and ugliness of his world with bravado, electricity, and wonder, turning
 a juvenile romp along the Jersey Shore into an epic quest for love and 
freedom. It’s hard to deny his vision when every track is so guileless, 
when the posturing and the melodrama only serve the album’s youthful 
sincerity.<br>
<br>
And when it comes to the music, Springsteen and the E Street Band are at
 their best and most expansive. There would later come a number of times
 in Bruce’s career when he would feel the need to pare things down and 
create an intimacy with the listener – Nebraska, The Ghost of Tom Joad, 
Devils and Dust – but in 1975, Bruce wanted to blow the place up. Songs 
like “Night” and “She’s the One” are bursting at the seams with energy 
and sound, all saxophone and shimmering glockenspiel, and even on 
“Meeting Across the River,” the ghostly trumpet stuttering in the 
distance sounds like it can barely be restrained. And “Born to Run,” of 
course, is unquestionably the biggest, most symphonic song Springsteen’s
 ever written. In the liner notes of his Greatest Hits album, 
Springsteen calls the song “My shot at the title. A 24 yr. old kid 
aimin’ at ‘The greatest rock ‘n’ roll record ever.’” Whether or not he 
succeeded is a matter of personal opinion (my own is that he did), but 
you can’t argue that he didn’t try. The song has often been compared to 
“Good Vibrations,” and for good reason; it’s said that Bruce recorded 
over eight different tracks of guitar alone for the song, including my 
favorite, the space-alien wah-wah guitar that only barely surfaces in 
the bridge. Every listen seems to bring a new instrument to the 
forefront, whether it’s the glockenspiel, the baritone saxophone, the 
strings, or Ernest Carter’s relentless drums.<br>
<br>
“The amusement park rises bold and stark…”<br>
<br>
It’s just as easy, though, to drown in the combined forces of all the 
sounds you’re hearing, and the effect is literally synesthetic – when 
Springsteen sings “the amusement park rises bold and stark / and kids 
are huddled on the beach in the mist,” I can actually see a Ferris wheel
 lit up over a dark, chilly waterfront, as if each instrument is 
providing a different visual cue. The song never ceases to pick up 
speed, somehow, even though the intensity is turned up all the way from 
the outset, and the constant forward progress makes you feel like you’re
 one of Springsteen’s “hemi-powered drones” screaming down the highway. 
You feel in your bones, inexplicably, that the song cannot be about 
anything but movement (could “Born to Run” ever make you feel like 
sitting still?), and yet the most poignant aspect of the song is its 
futility. The singer is so sure of his impending escape, so invested in 
his dream, that we get caught up along with him – but at the end of the 
song, there’s no indication that he’s actually succeeded, or that he 
ever will.<br>
<br>
Born to Run consistently surprises the listener this way: just when you 
think he’s going to get out, you realize he probably never will; and 
even when all hope seems lost, there’s always a chance for redemption. 
In “Jungleland,” the city seems like a dreamworld until the end, when 
“the Rat’s own dream guns him down” and “they wind up wounded, not even 
dead.” And the utter defeat of “Backstreets,” possibly the most 
beautiful, sorrowful song Springsteen has ever recorded, is immediately 
followed by the eternal optimism of “Born to Run.” The album is a 
maelstrom of complex emotion, street-corner machismo with a decidedly 
sensitive touch – an impossible combination for the breezy pop stars of 
the ’50s and ’60s or the caustic punks of the ’70s and ’80s. Only Bruce 
Springsteen, simultaneously an amalgamation of the two and something 
utterly unlike either of them, could have made it happen.<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: Born To Run (Columbia import)<br>
<br>
Jerry Gilbert, Sounds, September  13 1975<br>
<br>
THE VISIONARIES and rock and roll prophets who predicted that this album
 would be the making of Bruce Springsteen may have noted that while 
their hero has remained both sedulous and patient, his first two 
much-acclaimed albums which were largely ignored by the record-buying 
public have re-entered the Cashbox charts.<br>
<br>
After all that high-blown praise, the past two years must have been 
torturously slow as the Asbury Park kid and his number one fan Jon 
Landau strove to satisfy expectations in a fresh recording location and 
with a fresh band. It has an unhealthy time span – some of the romance 
has gone too. There was a special charge about that voluminous yet 
incongruous bunch of New Jersey bar musicians that were the old backing 
band; when Springsteen wanted them to sound like Gary US Bond there were
 voices and instruments everywhere. Then, at the given word, a tuba and 
an accordion would step forward and go it alone. But that band took an 
economic dive and Mad Dog Lopez and Doom Carter are no longer around. 
Nor is Danny Federici or keyboard showman David Sancious who now has his
 own solo album. Their swansong, (with the exception of Lopez), is the 
title track of the new album, recorded post-E Street Shuffle and with 
the surviving members of the band, Garry Tallent and Bruce's number one 
side man Clarence Clemons. It's Clemons, in fact, who provides some of 
the real magic, blowing some moving sax harmonies on 'Jungleland' and 
'Night'.<br>
<br>
The theme for the most part is tight R&amp;B, not the stretched out 
episodic street-life ballads that characterised the E Street Shuffle 
album. The metaphor is still vibrant in Springsteen's tails of seedy 
back-alley associations but the vocal is often muted and brought back 
into the ensemble leaving no room for the extended monotone or near 
monologue through which Springsteen unwound his earlier tales.<br>
<br>
Those who were quick to make comparisons with Van Morrison or the early 
R&amp;B men will find fodder for their arguments in 'Tenth Avenue 
Freeze-Out' or 'She's The One'. 'Jungleland' is probably most typical of
 the Springsteen sound of eighteen months ago, the story subject being 
introduced over a simple piano introduction and gradually building 
through several themes until suddenly 'Jungleland' has become a 
transmutation of Dylan's 'Desolation Row' nine years on. 'Thunder Road',
 the opening cut on the album, is launched in much the same way, and it 
should be added that CBS, who somehow goofed the last album by failing 
to provide a lyric sheet, have gone to great pains to run every song 
across a splendid black and white gatefold sleeve. It ensures that none 
of the lyrical magic is missed; it also allays fears that Bruce's 
writing would suffer away from the New Jersey boardwalk life and on the 
road seven nights a week.<br>
<br>
Comparisons with Dylan seem to move further into the distance. Bruce's 
self-portraits show him to be a James Dean figure but then Dylan was a 
product of the same ethos – yet there are times when you could be 
listening to Wilson Pickett! Three tracks, 'Night', 'Jungleland' and the
 beautiful reflective 'Meeting Across The River' are a model of 
structure composition. But elsewhere the band fails to convey the 
variation of mood that Springsteen's songs demand. They don't all 
require the urgency that accompanies city paranoia and Mike Appel and 
Jon Landau aren't able to provide the necessary dispassionate ears to 
detect studio foibles.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's new musicians have got the chops alright while his own 
brilliance is now contained rather than allowed to run free. But the 
point is that it's still there and it's the distinction from the two 
previous efforts that makes this album so interesting. I have grown to 
love it but newcomers to Bruce's music would be better advised to check 
out what the critics have been raving about in the past. Old fans will 
need to persevere. Released in this country on October 10.<br>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">ST LOUIS. 2008. Concert Review <br>
</strong><br>
<br>
Backstreets.com<br>
<br>
A real humdinger, and I like it like that. As the last notes of "Twist 
and Shout" died away, the buzz and general consensus was "best night of 
the tour." Of course, comparing these final Magic nights to performances
 from 2007 is like apples and socket wrenches. But no question, St. 
Louis was a peak performance, with a mind-blowing setlist and the energy
 to match. As the show stretched to three hours and 15 minutes, with two
 false endings to "Badlands," Mighty Max simply tearing up the drums, 
and three songs after "American Land"... Bruce didn't want to get off 
the stage, and the energized crowd didn't want to let him go.<br>
<br>
It all started with "Then She Kissed Me," Bruce's spin on the Crystals 
classic that he last broke out in 1975. A delirious opener, a song I 
thought I'd never hear, but hey, we've come to expect such things this 
month. What I didn't expect was that it would be just the first of five 
classic covers in the set -- six, if you count the resurrected "Not Fade
 Away" intro to "She's the One." After granted requests for "Rendezvous"
 and a full-band "For You," Bruce returned to the signs and said, "As 
soon as we started doing these requests, people started getting very 
sassy. Very sassy. Trying to stump us with stuff we played 23 or 30 
years ago. Tonight we'll challenge the band... and probably most of the 
audience, too!" Harold Dorman's "Mountain of Love" followed, a 
wall-of-sound cover that put me firmly on the path to Springsteen 
fanaticism when I first heard it on the Main Point '75 recording so many
 years ago. And in the nine-song encore, three more rock 'n' roll 
rave-ups -- "Detroit Medley," "Little Queenie," and "Twist and Shout" --
 took it over the top.<br>
<br>
But the oldies were only part of what shot this one into the 
stratosphere. Sizzling guitar on the return of a revitalized "Gypsy 
Biker," "Adam Raised a Cain," and a muscular (and rare) "Cover Me," 
Bruce taking two leads. And then there were the epics: "Backstreets," 
"Jungleland," and "Drive All Night." Traditional sing-alongs like 
"Hungry Heart" and "Sunny Day" went out the window to make room for this
 trio, and judging by the reaction, they were just as crowd-pleasing, if
 not more. "Backstreets" was played for a sign after "Mountain of Love" 
-- Bruce laughed, "We know this one!" After "Mary's Place," Steve could 
be seen miming a steering wheel to get the word around the stage. Bruce 
showed the "Drive All Night" sign to the crowd, and after an initial 
cheer there was an extraordinary hush, the whole place seeming to sit 
back to let it wash over. With the stage bathed in purple and blue 
light, it was a magical performance -- soulful, understated playing from
 the band led to tremedous crescendos, and then, if anyone had 
forgotten, Clarence reminded us of his power on that horn. "Better than 
Giants Stadium," a friend said to me halfway through the song... and it 
only got better from there.<br>
<br>
For the first "extended play" song after "American Land," Springsteen 
decided to set a wrong right. "We got the hometown of Bob Costas here, 
am I right?" In case you haven't followed the corrections coming out of 
NBC, both Costas and Brian Williams have offered mea culpas for 
reporting that Springsteen dedicated a song to Olympic wunderkind 
Michael Phelps -- "news" that thrilled Phelps himself -- when no such 
thing ever happened. Well, it hadn't happened until St. Louis. Costas 
had conculded his correction by writing: "Now if The Boss could just 
cover our butts by giving Mr. Phelps a shout-out on Thursday night in 
Nashville, or Saturday night in my hometown of St. Louis -- a show I’d 
definitely be at were I not in Beijing -- I think I'd feel a lot 
better." Though he didn't have a sign, Bruce decided to grant that 
request. He made good retroactively on the news reports, continuing with
 a knowing smile, "We're gonna send this one out to Michael Phelps. 
Eight golds -- whew!" And again, very deliberately, "To Michael Phelps,"
 before launching into "Thunder Road." Not "Born in the U.S.A." as 
reported, but Bob, Brian... butts are covered, you're in the clear. (And
 Brian, thanks for the shout-out.)<br>
<br>
From there, the whole place was fist-pumping go! go! go! for "Little 
Queenie" -- hey, this is Chuck Berry's hometown, too. And no one 
actually expected the band to stick around for yet another one, but a 
prominent sign reading "Sophie loves Bruce" was just the excuse 
Springsteen needed to keep things going. "We gotta do one for Sophie!" 
he shouted, kicking off "Twist and Shout" to wring the last drops of 
energy out of the Scottrade Center. Bless you, Sophie, wherever you are,
 and hail, hail rock 'n' roll.<br>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">THE RIVER SHOW <br>
<br>
November 8 / Madison Square Garden / New York, NY</strong><br>
<br>
Notes: Context has always been important to Bruce Springsteen's music, 
and he reinforced that notion with a galvanizing performance of The 
River in its entirety for the first time on Sunday night at Madison 
Square Garden. In a precise, exhilarating, and high-energy show, 
Springsteen faithfully reproduced all 20 of its songs. Most have 
appeared in shows on various tours since the album's 1980 release, and 
usually to great effect. But hearing the songs in their original order 
left many in the building gasping in astonishment.<br>
<br>
Springsteen introduced the 20-song cycle as a "gateway to my future 
writing," singling out "Stolen Car" and the title track as seed work for
 Tunnel of Love and Nebraska, respectively. He also mentioned the album 
was "made during a recession," an obvious connection to the hard times 
of the present. Then he lit it up, and as he made his way from "The Ties
 That Bind" to "Wreck on the Highway," Springsteen positively radiated 
with passion and energy.<br>
<br>
On the rockers, Bruce got physical: that was evident by the last verse 
of "Jackson Cage," where he sang with the force and conviction of a 
young artist trying to win over an audience with a new song. That 
investment extended to the fun rockers, too: "Crush on You" and "I'm a 
Rocker" weren't simply dusted off for the night. Rather, they were 
full-tilt, all-in exhibits A and B of what attracts fans to rock 'n' 
roll in the first instance, and to Bruce Springsteen's music in 
particular. Simply put, Bruce couldn't have put any more of himself into
 those two songs if he had tried. He prowled, vamped, sang, and played 
guitar as if his very life depended on it. Call it Springsteen uncorked,
 vintage 1980.<br>
<br>
But there's another side to the music from this album, and there 
Springsteen made an equally resonant connection. "I Wanna Marry You" 
stood out, as did Bruce, singing at the front of the stage, maracas in 
hand to keep time. His voice sounded sweet and soulful, his delivery 
balanced in sentiment and sincerity, and he ended it by taking Patti 
Scialfa for a slow dance. "Fade Away" was equally resplendent, but this 
time Bruce ended on his knees as the song faded away. "Drive All Night" 
was perhaps the evening's emotional high-water mark: the band found one 
groove after another, and Bruce asked Clarence Clemons for a second sax 
solo to put a stamp on the crescendo. Steve Van Zandt had a great night 
too. He was all over the guitar for "Crush on You" and "Cadillac Ranch,"
 and his background vocals — as integral to the album as his role as its
 co-producer — sounded exactly as they should have: right behind Bruce's
 voice in the mix. That made for an especially strong version of "The 
Price You Pay" in only its second appearance since 1981. Props, too, to 
Charles Giordano for his stately organ playing on this song.<br>
<br>
At the outset, Springsteen said that the album would be played like this
 just once because "it's too long to do it again." Clocking in just shy 
of two hours, The River felt like a show in and of itself. Afterward, he
 wasn't ready to end the set, and appeared unknowing of how to end the 
set. So he departed markedly from his handwritten list of songs, adding a
 thunderous "Atlantic City," and a romping “Seven Nights to Rock.” In 
the encore, he treated the audience to a work-up of and then a fine, 
off-the-cuff "Sweet Soul Music." Another treat appeared as Bruce led the
 band through "Can't Help Falling in Love." Throughout, he appeared to 
be a bottomless well of energy. At the end he escorted his vocalists to 
the platform at the back of the pit to conclude "Higher and Higher."<br>
<br>
On this night, where the past met the present, Bruce Springsteen and the
 E Street Band lifted the veil, lifted themselves, their music and their
 audience. Bruce may be wise to let this performance stand alone, 
because it's one that even he probably can't replicate.<br>

In most cases, reporting on a Bruce Springsteen concert is a rewarding 
experience. You get the oppportunity to share a great live experience 
with a fan community, describing the night's performance and particular 
highlights. Only in very few cases — if ever — you know you have been 
witnessing something that can't be described in words. Then, the job 
gets a bit trickier. Ullevi tonight was one of those nights. <br>
<br>
After Bruce and the band delivered a solid show yesterday, aimed to 
please a record-breaking 66,000-plus audience, hopes were high for a 
second show to be just as good but very different, as with the two-night
 stand in Bergen earlier this week. Well, we did get a different show: 
19 songs not played the night before, and several tour premieres... and 
we got a lot more.<br>
<br>
From the very beginning, Bruce seemed to be full of confidence following
 Friday night's show, which won rave reviews in all the newspapers. 
Entering the stage in a white T-shirt and a black vest, he opened with 
the full-band redention of "Who'll Stop the Rain" (Gothenburg had heavy 
rain all day, tapering off just about an hour before the concert). "The 
Ties That Bind" followed, sounding tight despite being infrequently 
played, Jake sounding as good as the Big Man himself at his prime. A 
"Born in the U.S.A. double-header," in Bruce's words, brought us 
"Downbound Train" and "I'm Goin' Down," with Jake really shining once 
again. The first sign request of the evening — "We haven't played this 
in quite a while, but due to the weather conditions..." — was the tour 
premiere of "Lost in the Flood." While both Bruce and Roy needed a bit 
of brushing up before the song could start, once it got going we got a 
stellar performance of this song, which ever since the reunion tour 
redention has been a fan favorite whenever it is played. During a 
particularly emotional "My City of Ruins" the "we are not worthy" waving
 from the crowd toward the side of the stage previously occupied by the 
Big Man was particularly heavy — indeed a sign for things to come later 
in the evening.<br>
<br>
A sign request brought "Saint in the City": "A lucky song. I got my 
record contract playing this one," Bruce introduced it, going on to 
deliver hot guitar solos with Steve during an extended coda. Introduced 
as a song from The River album, out came the tour premiere of "Frankie."
 The introduction with Nils on 12-string supported by Soozie on fiddle 
was new, adding a country flavor to this one, which Bruce called "a 
beautiful song" (despite seemingly missing the fact that this was 
recorded for both Darkness and Born in the U.S.A., the latter version 
released on Tracks). Also new was Bruce's guitar solo (in place of the 
sax solo) toward the end of the song. <br>
<br>
To please the crowd, no fewer than three sing-along staples in a row 
ensured that causal fans got their money worth: "Hungry Heart," 
"Shackled and Drawn," and "Waitin' on a Sunny Day." As a special thank 
you to fans who have been "following us from place to place to place to 
place..." we got the tour premiere of "Where the Bands Are," with Bruce 
playing the first verse alone before the full band kicking in. But he 
clearly wasn't finished expressing his gratitutde: up next was a truly 
masterful performance of "Backstreets," delivered with a lengthy 
interlude (not as long as the much-loved '78 version, but close), with 
Bruce repeating "til the end" and "come a little closer" before taking 
on the "hiding on the backstreets" part. The best performance of this 
song I've seen since the Darkness tour period. If some Swedish authority
 had decided to the plug there and then, this would have been the best 
show of the tour, but Bruce and the band were far from done.<br>
<br>
Closing out the main set was a hot version of "Badlands" and an epic 
"Land of Hope and Dreams." Kicking off the encore, we got a 
crystal-clear "Thunder Road" delivered with incredible passion and 
determination, getting us to believe that we really were gonna pull out 
of this town and win. Following an earth-shaking "Born in the U.S.A." 
and "Born to Run," we got some pure fun through "Ramrod." By the end of 
"Dancing in the Dark," Bruce signaled that his voice was gone — which 
was partially true, already having shown some signs of wear and tear 
yesterday — but as usual, Steve got him on his feet again after a few 
liters of water from the sponge.<br>
<br>
When we thought this could be all over after the tribute that is "Tenth 
Avenue Freeze-out," Bruce wasn't done talking about the Big Man. He 
noted that "Clarence always had a special connection to Sweden," and 
then: "We haven't rehearsed this, but this is for you and for the Big 
Man." What followed was the tour premiere of "Jungleland." With Soozie 
moving back a little bit, a spotlight fell on a lonely saxophone placed 
at Clarence's usual stage position, and we got an extremely moving 
redention of his signature tune. To say that Jake was up to the task 
would be a severe understatement. Following the song, Bruce and Jake 
embraced, and tears were not only in Jake's eyes, but in everyody's. 
Clearly one for the history books of the E Street Band.<br>
<br>
Having thanked the Swedish audience for "two amazing nights" and an "Oh 
my God" seldom heard from Bruce on stage, he said that "We need to send 
these people home!" But not before the stadium-breaker anthem "Twist and
 Shout," with the La Bamba part thown in for good measure making it the 
longest version of the song since the Amnesty tour. After that it really
 was the end to a show which not only can be described as the best of 
this tour by a good distance, the best of the decade (yes, St. Louis 
2008 has served us well so far), and possibly, just possibly, the best 
one ever. I'm sure such a statement is up for grabs, but there's no 
doubt this is a strong contender.<br>
