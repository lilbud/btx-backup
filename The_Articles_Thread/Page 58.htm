<strong class="text-strong">ROBERT CHRISTGAU; SPRINGSTEEN'S ODYSSEY<br>
<br>
Boston Globe <br>
Author:	Christgau, Robert<br>
Date:	Sep 5, 1984</strong><br>
<br>
If you're much over 30, you probably haven't thought much about Bruce 
Springsteen since he burst out of rock-and-roll nowhere onto the covers 
of Time and Newsweek in October 1975. And even if Springsteen made a fan
 of you then, it's quite possible you've lost interest since - people 
often do stop following pop music as their lives settle in. Springsteen 
has never been a staple of hit radio - not until this year did any of 
his singles make top 10. Nor has he ingratiated the kind of cultural 
arbiters who regard seriousness as acting in movies like David Bowie or 
writing poetry like Patti Smith and define clout as going trentuple 
platinum like Michael Jackson or consorting with the powerful like Linda
 Ronstadt. Touring hard and laboring endlessly in the studio, 
Springsteen has simply pursued his craft. He's a compassionate man, and 
if you don't care about rock and roll he probably still cares about you.
 He's just not sure how to put it.<br>
Even in the pop world Springsteen is often taken for granted. Though 
stuck with the tagline "rock-and-roll future," he's always been an 
upholder of rock- and-roll tradition, a tradition the rhythms and 
attitudes of punk and disco were attacking even as he made his 
breakthrough. Soon those subcultures were shaping the music's future, 
which meant that pop fans with a taste for change were largely unaware 
that he'd grown at all. So though Springsteen's career got plenty of 
help from industry tastemakers (especially FM radio programmers, whose 
vocation he sometimes seemed to justify single-handed in this rock- 
schlock era), he had to develop his audience without much help from the 
trend-setters within.<br>
But at his own stubborn pace, Springsteen was evolving. Always a 
powerful singer and prodigious lyricist as well as a vivid performer, he
 honed away aural murk and beautiful-loser melodrama until his songs 
were compact vignettes with as complex a message about growing up and 
older in America as any film or fiction you care to name. And gradually 
he was also building up his audience, not just numerically but 
spiritually. Unlike such talented competitors for the rock mainstream as
 Billy Joel and John Cougar Mellencamp, he refused to pander. Not only 
did he always tell what truth he saw, but he never whined about it, and 
the physical ebullience where he found the traditional rock-and-roll 
release never devolved into the mindless self- infatuation of the 
traditional rock-and-roll escape. No longer naive enough to believe that
 being born to run ever gets you far enough, he continued to live in 
South Jersey and root his writing in the small victories and large 
compromises of the ordinary Joes and Janies he'd known all his life. 
These people weren't classy or influential, but he believed that their 
need to understand as well as celebrate was as restless as his own, and 
this respect got results: though he released only two albums in the five
 years following his 1975 breakthrough, his million-strong audience grew
 up and older with him, and their intense loyalty was legendary.<br>
Yet with his dreams spread out before him, Springsteen suffered a 
crisis, not just because dreams fulfilled hold their own perils, but 
because he'd stayed close enough to home to see how far from their 
dreams most of his fans were destined to remain. His response was 1982's
 cathartic "Nebraska," a tellingly joyless album about failure and 
worse, recorded almost unaccompanied in his living room. FM radio hardly
 touched it, but more than half a million record buyers rejected the 
programmers' escapism, and in 1984 they got the payback: "Born in the 
U.S.A.," Springsteen's most rhythmically propulsive, vocally incisive, 
lyrically balanced, and commercially undeniable album. The tone is still
 bitter. The protagonist of the first No. 1 single of Springsteen's 
career "ain't getting nowhere living in a dump like this," and the 
artist's funniest male-bonding song in a decade ends ominously, with a 
buddy "handcuffed to the bumper of a state trooper's Ford." Bitterer 
still are these lines from the keynote track: "Had a brother in Khe 
Sanh/Fighting off the Viet Cong/They're still there, he's all gone." 
Somehow, though, the pessimism never seems defeated or corrosive. It 
isn't just his music that enables him to act out his resistance to the 
bad news he brings, but a faith renewed by fans who've proven themselves
 ready to hear him out.<br>
Rock and roll is hardly a limitless form, and Springsteen at his 
toughest does list toward a certain straight-from-the-heart 
emotionalism. He's too white and too male, although he's decent enough 
to wish he weren't; he's too fatalistic and too unanalytic, although his
 eye is sharp as can be. But even before this rock- schlock era it was 
the rare superstar who could make so much of the music's potential for 
give-and-take with fans who are always less settled in than cynics 
believe. Those fans have grown older without forgetting the meaning of 
their dreams, and even if you're well over 30 both they and their 
spokesman have something to say to you, if you know how to take it.<br>

<strong class="text-strong">REVIEW / MUSIC; A SPRINGSTEEN TREAT FOR 30,000 AT SARATOGA; ; PERFORMING ARTS CENTER ON FRIDAY NIGHT.<br>
<br>
Boston Globe <br>
Author:	Steve Morse Globe Staff<br>
Date:	Jul 30, 1984</strong><br>
<br>
SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. - There were no lasers, no smoke bombs, no props 
and no expensive costumes. All of those typical components of a modern 
rock show were stripped away. It was back to fundamentals, back to the 
music alone, back to Bruce Springsteen with his fist slicing through the
 air and his raspy voice raging into the night.<br>
In his first Northeast concert in more than two years, New Jersey's 
keeper of the flame burned brighter than ever before a boisterous crowd 
of 30,000 fans nestled onto a muddy hillside in this Victorian resort 
village.<br>
It was another stupendous, superhuman performance by Springsteen, who 
remains the hands-down gold medal winner for rock endurance. His 
3-hour-and- 15-minute opus was like seeing two shows for the price of 
one.<br>
In fact, he was extra herculean since not only was this the biggest show
 of his summer tour to date, it was also his debut in Saratoga's 
wondrousamphitheater, where 5000 lucky fans sat under a handsomely 
baffled ceiling while the rest stood and boogied out on the sloping 
lawn, watching a towering video screen if they couldn't see the stage.<br>
So intense was the desire for tickets that for the first time in the 
Performing Arts Center's 19-year history, lawn sales were cut off days 
before the show for safety reasons. Otherwise, the house record of 
37,500 set by the Grateful Dead last month would have easily been 
broken, said Saratoga spokesman Pete Hopper.<br>
His arms bulging from a recent weightlifting regimen, Springsteen 
churned through two electrifying sets. He talked less than usual - 
keeping his working class, Studs Terkel-like narratives to a minimum - 
and instead played more music (a full 30 songs, with stunning segues and
 improvisations) and added more theatrics, such as twice sliding across 
the stage like Ty Cobb, slipping into choregraphed dance steps with his 
band and hamming it up with saxophonist Clarence Clemons and new lead 
guitarist Nils Lofgren. The latter fit in beautifully and added 
theatrics of his own such as playing guitar with his teeth and doing a 
back flip off a trampoline.<br>
Springsteen opened on a full-steam note with "Badlands," carrying its 
live-for-today message into "Prove It All Night," ending with a savage, 
bucking-bronco guitar solo. "Out on the Street" then spotlighted his 
unwavering, cool-cat rebelliousness ("When I'm out on the street I walk 
the way I want to walk"), tempered by three artfully reworked songs from
 his acoustic "Nebraska" album, "Atlantic City," "Johnny 99" and 
"Highway Patrolman," raising echoes of Hank Williams in their 
sympathetic defense of American losers and receiving sparse, elegiac 
backup from the E Street Band.<br>
Checking the pulse of the crowd, Springsteen, looking like a 
construction foreman in a dungaree vest and jeans, sparked long "sha- 
la-la" harmonies on "Darlington County," followed by a mesmerizing 
sequence from the pop bounce of "Glory Days" (a slap at people who mourn
 the past and a slap at hypocritical New Jersey friends who flatter him 
now but "wouldn't speak to me" years ago); then on to the euphoric 
"Promised Land," the misty "Used Cars" (another "Nebraska" song upgraded
 this time by Roy Bittan's luminous accordion fills); the aching song of
 American pride, "My Hometown," the cawing declaration of "Born in the 
U.S.A." and the R &amp; B ecstasy of "Thunder Road."<br>
The magic resumed in the second set. "Hungry Heart" established a snappy
 note that continued with his new hit "Dancing in the Dark," during 
which he avoided a precarious rush from a female fan by beckoning her to
 dance, then swept her in his arms for a kiss before helping her jump 
back into the crowd. "Cadillac Ranch," one of five songs from "The 
River" LP, kept up this dance pace which peaked with the 50s-style 
"Sherry Darling" (Clemons, introduced as "living history," added a 
flurry of sax honks) before settling down with "No Surrender," a rock 
song from Springsteen's latest album, "Born in the U.S.A.," but 
rearranged into an acoustic treasure here.<br>
The home stretch, as usual, was a sprint. As he jumped on speakers and 
dashed around to exhort the crowd, Springsteen rocketed through "Because
 the Night," the rockabillyish "Pink Cadillac," the street-cool 
"Rosalita" (the only song from his first two albums), a funkified "Fire"
 and delirious encores of Mitch Ryder's "Devil with a Blue Dress," the 
Stones' "Street Fighting Man" (given a near heavy- metal treatment) and 
the old blues, "C.C. Rider." It was rock heaven all the way.<br>

<br>
Bruce mania rushes on. The five-record set, "Bruce Springsteen &amp; the
 E Street Band Live/1975-85," will debut at No. 1 on next week's 
Billboard pop chart. The last album to accomplish that was Stevie 
Wonder's "Songs in the Key of Life" 10 years ago.<br>
About 1.7 million copies of the package were shipped to record stores 
last week, but Springsteen's label, CBS Records, has already received 
reorders for 800,000 copies, spokesman Steve Mandel said yesterday.<br>
Radio stations have gone so wild that Billboard had a cover story this 
week entitled "All-Bruce Radio," pointing out that many rock stations 
are routinely programming up to 19 of the 40 songs in the package.<br>

ROCK NOTES<br>
Bruce Springsteen has become the most politically powerful rock 'n' roll
 singer since John Lennon. That was the impression that lingered the 
most after his two blood-boiling shows at the Providence Civic Center 
this week.<br>
Numerous times Springsteen introduced his songs with harsh attacks on 
social injustices. He also put his money where his mouth is by donating 
$10,000 to the Rhode Island Community Food Bank, which helps the 
unemployed, the elderly and the destitute. As he said: "The trickle-down
 theory of economics ain't trickling down to all of us. And if the 
government doesn't do something about it, the people got to."<br>
In a brief interview after Wednesday's show, his guitarist, Nils 
Lofgren, was asked about Springsteen's heightened interest in social 
issues. "He knows he now has a forum for his views, and he's using it," 
Lofgren said. "What he's doing is obviously to put it right in your 
face, but he's really trying to do good things for people. He really 
means it."<br>
It was also learned Springsteen and his E Street Band will perform a 
benefit for Ethiopian famine relief next month in Los Angeles with 
Lionel Richie. It will be his first benefit since appearing at nuclear 
disarmamantrallies several years ago.<br>
"Find something you can believe in and hold on to it," Springsteen said 
at Wednesday's show. And as he noted in a street- wise acknowledgment of
 keyboardist Danny Federici's birthday: "It don't matter how old you 
get, you got to keep searching for that promised land."<br>

<strong class="text-strong">SPRINGSTEEN AT FENWAY BORN TO PLAY A CRITIC PICKS BRUCE'S 10- BEST SHOWS.<br>
<br>

<br>
WEEKEND<br>
My fate as a Bruce Springsteen fan was sealed when I first caught him at
 Boston Garden in 1978. He jumped into the crowd, ran down the aisle 
with guitar in hand, and popped up on an empty seat next to mine while 
singing "Spirit in the Night." His eyes flashed sparks as he screamed 
and waved a fist toward the upper balcony. It was an addictive, totally 
primal moment, and I've come back dozens of times since. So before he 
and the E Street Band play Fenway Park this Saturday and Sunday, here's 
my top 10 list of Springsteen shows that have helped make this job so 
worthwhile:<br>
1. This was the first New York-area show of Springsteen's "Born in the 
U.S.A." tour, so the mood was electric. More than 30,000 fans caught a 
3-hour, 15-minute marathon that opened with "Badlands," "Prove It All 
Night," and "Out in the Street"; moved into three songs from his 
acoustic "Nebraska" album ("Atlantic City," "Johnny 99," and "Highway 
Patrolman"); and hit overdrive with "Glory Days," "Promised Land," "My 
Hometown," "Born in the U.S.A.," and "Thunder Road." And that was all 
just in the first set. Springsteen also twice slid across the stage like
 Ty Cobb, and guitarist Nils Lofgren did a back flip off a trampoline. 
The second set soared with "Because the Night," the rockabilly-fueled 
"Pink Cadillac," "Rosalita," and delirious encores of Mitch Ryder's 
"Devil With a Blue Dress" and the Stones' "Street Fighting Man."<br>
2. Chalk this up as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see Springsteen 
in a 900-seat hall, a benefit for DoubleTake magazine. Switching between
 six- and 12-string guitars and a piano, he did songs that he rarely 
plays, such as "Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?" from his first 
album, "Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J." He talked about how he wrote 
his songs, and he reworked some magnificently, including "Born in the 
U.S.A." with a slide-guitar treatment that had a Led Zeppelin "Kashmir" 
flair. He opened the show with the powerful one-two punch of "Darkness 
on the Edge of Town" and "Adam Raised a Cain," later pulled out 
"Nebraska" and "Stolen Car," and didn't let up for 2 1/2 riveting hours.<br>
3. This was my first review of Springsteen, and he opened with Roy 
Brown's rock classic "Good Rockin' Tonight," which was also a hit for 
Wynonie Harris and done by Jerry Lee Lewis. The Boss was showing his 
knowledge of rock's roots, and I was immediately hooked. He had opened 
with Buddy Holly's "Rave On" on West Coast dates, but chose "Good 
Rockin' Tonight" for Boston. I'd love to hear it again. Maybe at Fenway?<br>
4. Seeing Springsteen in his native New Jersey is like seeing Aerosmith 
in Boston. It's damn the torpedoes all the way. Reuniting with the E 
Street Band (it was the first time Lofgren and Steven Van Zandt were in 
the band together), Springsteen unveiled a new rock evangelism in his 
stage banter ("We've come to regenerate you and re- sexualate you," he 
said) and an incredible mix of material from the haunting "Streets of 
Philadelphia" to the driving "Backstreets," with saxophonist Clarence 
Clemons going wild. A new song, "Freehold," celebrated Springsteen's 
Jersey roots while recalling his Catholic grammar school education and 
his "first kiss in a YMCA canteen on a Friday night."<br>
5. Capping a sold-out, five-night run in which he drew 98,500 people to 
the FleetCenter, Springsteen opened with the express- train rock of 
"Candy's Room," with drummer Max Weinberg leading the way. Then came 
"Ties That Bind," and the crowd was at the band's mercy. We got a rare 
performance of the poetic oldie "New York City Serenade" and robust 
versions of "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out," "Jungleland," and "Light of Day."
 Former J. Geils Band singer Peter Wolf hopped out for a dance-crazed 
version of the Eddie Floyd/<br>
Steve Cropper chestnut "Raise Your Hand."<br>
6. At this Harry Chapin tribute, Springsteen shared the stage with Paul 
Simon, Pete Seeger, Harry Belafonte, and Judy Collins, but he stole the 
show. Playing solo, he sang Chapin's "Remember When the Music," an ode 
to the '60s, when music "was a rock we could cling to so we would not 
despair," according to Chapin's lyrics. But it was Springsteen as orator
 who was spellbinding. "Back then it seemed music had a greater sense of
 unity and shared purpose than it does today," he said. "We come from a 
generation that was going to make the world a little less lonely, try to
 make it a more just place. And it seemed when that promise was broken, 
we lost faith. Today, it's `I got my music, and you got yours, and the 
guy up the street has his.' So you can sit back and say cynically, 
`Maybe men are not all brothers, maybe we'll never really know each 
other.' But Harry instinctively knew it would also take more than love 
to survive it. It was going to take hard work with a good clear eye on 
the dirty ways of the world."<br>
7. This was the first North American stop of an Amnesty International 
world tour that included Sting, Peter Gabriel, Tracy Chapman, and 
Youssou N'Dour. Springsteen and the E Street Band were jet-lagged after 
performing in Paris, Turin, Barcelona, San Jose (in Costa Rica), and 
Toronto in one week. Springsteen was as tired as I've ever seen him, but
 he got by on sheer sweat. His universal plea of "Promised Land" was an 
inspiring highlight.<br>
8. Outside, a black sports car had the license plate "Bruuuuce." And 
inside, a group of fans unfurled a banner that read, "On the 8th day God
 created Bruce." This was the height of his hero worship, back when he 
not only did his own songs, but roared into oldies such as the Isley 
Brothers' "Twist and Shout," the Dave Clark Five's "Do You Love Me," and
 Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Travelin' Band." A rock party that was 
hard to beat, as was Springsteen's confession to the crowd: "Man, I 
hated high school! I'm so glad that when 8 o'clock comes around at 
night, I get to rock rather than do my homework."<br>
9. The key to this show was a revitalized Clemons. The previous summer, 
he had appeared out of shape, but he hired a personal trainer and was 
back in the game, dancing with Springsteen and echoing the Clarence of 
old. Springsteen's newly added "Human Touch" (from an album he made 
without the E Street Band) was a nice stroke, as was his tender 
dedication of "No Surrender" to friend Lenny Zakim, the head of the New 
England office of the Anti-Defamation League, who had died the previous 
year of cancer.<br>
10. Springsteen's acoustic tour to back his John Steinbeck- influenced 
"Ghost of Tom Joad" album was an often grim affair, as anyone recalling 
his dates at the Orpheum will attest. But his show in Providence some 
months later struck a much better balance, mingling his poignant 
defenses of migrant workers with some just plain fun songs such as 
"Red-Headed Woman" (about his wife) and the new "There Will Never Be," 
about tabloid sensationalism. It brought home the many sides of 
Springsteen, from caring social observer to tongue-in-cheek humorist.<br>

<br>
Bruce Springsteen always seems to arrive just when you need him.<br>
Bad day? Terrible news? Feeling rundown? Looking to put a name to that restless feeling you have been having?<br>
Monday night, Springsteen and his stalwart contracting and expanding E 
Street Band brought their restorative powers to a sellout crowd of 
18,210 at the TD Garden and did the most elemental thing you could hope 
for: Banish distractions and aggravations in favor of some fun.<br>
That's exactly what Springsteen promised during his cheeky 
street-corner-preacher testimonials, at one point assuring the crowd 
that they would go home with hands, feet, and voices hurting.<br>
That he and the band managed to deliver the fun while still digging deep
 emotionally into many of the painful and pointed songs about the 
divided times in which we live from his latest album "Wrecking Ball," as
 well as pay tribute to those they have personally lost, was a tribute 
to their commitment.<br>
The indefatigable showman and his cohorts played for 2 hours and 50 
minutes with an energy that bordered on superhuman, with Springsteen 
himself seemingly serving as the power source as he ran, knee-slid, and 
crowd-surfed his way around the arena. The group moved as a unit with 
grace and spirit through a sometimes puzzling set list that ignored a 
wide, popular, and quality swath of Springsteen's considerable catalog 
but still brought the fire. (With the exception of an encore of "Dancing
 in the Dark," the set consisted almost completely of songs from 1980 
and earlier, or 2001 and later, overlooking almost everything that came 
between "The Rising" and "Wrecking Ball.")<br>
The band - swollen to 16 with the addition of a 5-piece horn section and
 a trio of singers and singer-percussionist - slid from sound to sound 
with dexterity working itself into a righteous lather on a medley of the
 soul classics "The Way You Do the Things You Do" and "634-5789," which 
Springsteen prefaced with a comically souped-up rap about his recent 
show at the Apollo Theater.<br>
The band ratcheted up the tension, building the crescendos of anthems like "The Rising" and "Badlands" to an ecstatic crest.<br>
It moved poignantly through the sobering "American Skin (41 Shots)," bringing to mind images of Trayvon Martin.<br>
Then the band eased nicely into folkier and Celtic flavored tracks, including "Death to My Hometown."<br>
Without naming names, Springsteen paid touching tribute to dearly 
departed members of the E Street family, keyboardist Danny Federici and 
sax player Clarence Clemons. During a breakdown of the soulful "My City 
of Ruins," he took a roll call of the band and then said some people 
were missing.<br>
But, Springsteen said to the audience "as long as you're here, and as long as we're here, they're here."<br>

<strong class="text-strong">SPRINGSTEEN CONFIDENT, FEELING GOOD<br>
<br>
Boston Globe - Boston, Mass.<br>
Author:	Steve Morse Globe Staff<br>
Date:	Dec 15, 1980</strong><br>
	<br>
It was 2 a.m. last Friday, and Bruce Springsteen was still wide awake.<br>
Somewhere around midnight, he had finished a monumental, four- hour 
marathon at the Civic Center, but instead of filing back to his hotel to
 sleep or watch alate movie, he was sitting backstage, greeting 
well-wishers and music-biz reps into the wee hours.<br>
"After I've done a show, I'm never tired," said the man known as The Boss,<br>
who performs tonight and tomorrow at Boston Garden. "I'm always really 
awake,and I stay awake for hours and hours. I don't go to bed until 
6:30, or<br>
something like that."<br>
Rather than hide from people after a show, Springsteen said: "It's good 
to have that immediate contact . . . a lot of people who come in are 
working for you on your record, or doing something for you in some way, 
so it's good to meet people like that."<br>
To put it another way, the 31-year-old Springsteen remains down to 
earth. Although his concerts have been rapid-fire sellouts across the 
country, and his double-album "The River" has topped the charts, he 
still doesn't play the aloof, condescending games of so many other 
superstars.<br>
In a trademark gesture, he still dives into the audience during his 
show, the reason being that "we try to maintain the aspect of real 
people being in the audience and also on stage."<br>
In Providence, however, in an example of just how popular Springsteen 
has become, he couldn't stay in the crowd for more than 20 seconds. "I 
got attacked and jumped right back up again," he said, as he forced a 
shy grin during our interview. "Some nights you meet four or five 
15-year-old girls, and you can't continue because they go nuts 
sometimes. There's got to be a two-way street when you go down in the 
crowd: One is that you got to want it, and the other part is they want 
to let you."<br>
It is no secret that Springsteen lives for his performances ("I focus 
everything around the time I spend on stage"), and clearly no 
contemporary rock artist puts more of himself into his act.<br>
He sometimes gets a faraway look in his eyes on stage, but that doesn't 
mean his thoughts are anywhere else. "No, you should just be intuitive. I
 never like to find myself thinking during a song, because you got to be
 IN that song at that time . . . So you don't have many distant thoughts
 - those come after the show. I'll go home and I'll get in bed and think
 about what I did tonight. I think you become self-conscious then . . ..<br>
Only five years ago though, Springsteen said, he was much more self- 
conscious on stage. He was in the middle of management problems and an 
identity crisis, and both took their toll. "I was very self-conscious on
 stage, and it was killing me. I hated it. It was right after the Born 
to Run' album, on that first tour . . . I had uncontrollable self-doubts
 which manifested themselves even while I was playing. It was sort of 
that thing, Who is this guy on stage, and you ain't so sure.'<br>
"I was 25 then, and I had been playing for 10 years, but even with all 
that amount of time under my belt, I still just didn't know myself. I 
had a lot of questions . . . I knew that music was my job, my life, but I
 guess you question what you got to offer, what you got to say. Music, 
from the beginning, always meant so much to me, and the biggest fear was
 that in some way I was wasting people's time . . . In the end you never
 answer those questions completely or fully - which is good - because 
once you do that you get smug."<br>
Does he still have self-doubts? "You have to, but it's different. I made
 it through that particular time, and I'm five, six years down the road.
 We're still playing. Nothing stopped. I guess there was a fear at that 
time that something was going to stop . . . But what counts is that 
you're still out there, and I feel the very best this tour that I've 
ever felt."<br>
Springsteen's renewed self-confidence suffuses "The River" LP, where he 
was finally able to loosen his often fussy, and time- consuming, 
songwriting style. Asked about country singer Hank Williams' dictum that
 if you can't write a song in 15 minutes you should throw it out, 
Springsteen said: "My problem was that if I wrote a song in 15 minutes, 
then I would throw it out. This album was the first album where I wrote 
some songs really fast. Like the song, Hungry Heart,' I wrote in about 
10 minutes . . . Yeah, you can get obsessed with details, and while I 
spent a lot of time on the selection and sequencing of songs on the 
album, in the actual recording and writing I tried to be as spontaneous 
as possible."<br>
And speaking of Hank Williams, Springsteen has become a big fan, even 
borrowing the "down by the river" imagery from Williams' "Long Gone 
Lonesome Blues" to form the title cut of "The River" album. "I was 
sitting in my bedroom one night. I was just there with my guitar, and 
all of a sudden I started singing, down by the river' . . . I couldn't 
think of the rest of the song; all I could think of was that particular 
image."<br>
"It wasn't until the last tour that I started to get into country music,
 and Hank Williams in particular," said Springsteen. "I thought, I think
 there's something similar between this and my stuff.' It seemed really 
realistic to me, really genuine, and it had a lot of highway on it. And 
you always had that sense of rootlessness in all his stuff. It's not an 
outlaw or a rebel thing, which is funny because when I first started 
people thought my characters were rebels, but I never thought they were.
 They were just normal people just trying to live, period . . . Anyway, 
with Hank Williams' stuff - which I played while traveling around the 
country on the entire last tour - his words were just so beautiful, and 
his songs were so real."<br>
As for Springsteen's other thoughts these days, he shared the following:<br>
John Lennon's death: "Well, this I don't want to talk about. There will 
be a million words said about it, and none can really express it. I 
think it's a personal thing for everybody, and it's just too personal 
for me."<br>
Boston Garden: "I was worried the last time there, but it was one of the
 best shows, and best audiences, of the tour. It's sweaty there, and I 
like that."<br>
The American Dream: "It's never what you thought it would be. When 
you're young, you have the stock dream - of all the girls in the world 
and the big house - but when you get there most of those stock dreams 
don't fit. They're childish. I find for me that just being out on the 
road, and playing and doing what I do, is what I want."<br>

MUSIC REVIEW BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN AND THE SEEGER SESSIONS BAND AT: TWEETER CENTER, LAST NIGHT<br>
MANSFIELD - Bruce Springsteen and 17 of his most musical friends 
transformed the Tweeter Center stage into a giant porch last night, 
simultaneously christening the venue's season, kicking off the artist's 
US tour, and welcoming the summer season with a 2 1/2-hour performance 
that was more backyard party than rock concert.<br>
Springsteen is touring in support of "We Shall Overcome," a collection 
of songs popularized by Pete Seeger, and last night's homespun symphony 
of accordions and fiddles, pedal steel guitars, and joyful voices was 
filled with the irrepressible spirit that's the very essence of folk 
music.<br>
Springsteen hollered and stomped and led his strumming, plucking, 
honking, sawing ensemble through jubilant takes on "John Henry," 
"Jacob's Ladder," and nearly every other track on the new album. He also
 reworked a handful of songs from his back catalog down-home versions of
 "Johnny 99," "Cadillac Ranch," "Open All Night," "Ramrod," and "You Can
 Look (But You Better Not Touch)."<br>
Any fans expecting a signature Springsteen show were surely startled to 
find themselves scrolling through musical history. Spirituals and sea 
chanteys, outlaw ballads and minstrel tunes, civil rights ballads and 
dustbowl anthems were the order of the night with a heavy nod to New 
Orleans and an unexpected dose of soul.<br>
A blowsy horn section turned everything in its path positively Bourbon 
Street, while Boston-based banjo player Greg Liszt affectionately evoked
 the project's namesake with his four humble strings on rousing 
singalongs of "Old Dan Tucker," "Jesse James," and the grade-school 
staple "Erie Canal."<br>
Seeger's role as outspoken activist echoed as well, in the great Irish 
antiwar song "Mrs. McGrath" and the classic "We Shall Overcome," which 
Springsteen introduced as "the most important political protest song 
ever written." He also performed Seeger's "Bring 'Em Home," which was a 
new addition to the set along with the Depression-era "How Can a Poor 
Man Stand Such Times and Live" (with three new Bruce-penned verses 
dedicated to the residents of New Orleans).<br>
Local rocker Peter Wolf joined the band for a show-closing (and show-stopping) medley of "Dirty Water" and "Buffalo Gals."<br>

Music Review<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band<br>
At: Hartford Civic Center, last night<br>
HARTFORD - When Bruce Springsteen asked the musical question "is there 
anybody alive out there?" last night at the Hartford Civic Center he got
 back a roar of affirmation like only Bruce Springsteen can.<br>
The beloved New Jersey icon, sporting a shocking amount of hairspray in 
his endearingly poufy 'do, was back among his people. All his people.<br>
After Springsteen's troubadour detours - 2005's ruminative solo work 
"Devils &amp; Dust" and the big-band folk of 2006's "The Seeger 
Sessions" - both the E Street Band and his fans transformed the opening 
night of the tour for the new "Magic" album into what felt like the 
largest reunion of old friends imaginable.<br>
"Magic" was released just yesterday but plenty in the sold-out crowd 
were already familiar with the eight tracks played last night including 
the aforementioned "Radio Nowhere," a tasty table-setter with its 
driving groove and insistent, community-building refrain of "I just want
 to feel some rhythm."<br>
Many who crowded the general-admission floor and stood in front of their
 seats for most of the well-paced two-hour-and-15-minute set sang along,
 whether it was to a cherished oldie - of which there were many 
including "She's the One," "Badlands," a stunning "Darkness on the Edge 
of Town," and an ebullient "Thundercrack" - or a spiffy new gem like 
"Girls in Their Summer Clothes," a hazily elegant street-corner 
observation that made you wish the season wasn't over.<br>
Political issues may have taken an explicit back seat on some of the new
 album but Springsteen left little open to interpretation when 
introducing the haunting title track, saying it was about "how we're in 
this Orwellian moment where what's true can be made to seem like a lie 
and what's a lie can be made to seem true, and we've gotten to witness 
that over the past six years."<br>
He then sang the atmospheric tune, trading solemn cries with wife and 
backup singer Patti Scialfa. (The pair also teamed up for a down and 
dirty "Town Called Heartbreak.")<br>
Later Springsteen - who was in good voice and good spirits - prefaced 
the swaggering "Living in the Future" by decrying "illegal wiretapping 
and attacks on the Constitution" among other abuses of government to the
 cheers of some and the mere tolerance of others.<br>
While age may be catching up with some in the band, no one dropped a 
note or beat last night and all seemed happy to be playing together 
again<br>

MUSIC REVIEW<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN</strong><br>
<br>
At: the Brendan Bryne Arena, first of 11 nights<br>
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- The red carpet wasn't out, but a surreal, 
blue-and-white, 30-by-100-foot banner was. Draped over the Brendan Byrne
 Arena, and large enough to be seen from the distant highway, it said: 
"WELCOME HOME BRUCE." It honored New Jersey's favorite rock 'n' roll 
son, Bruce Springsteen, who opened his American tour last night with the
 first of 11 sold-out shows at the Meadowlands that will pull in 224,000
 fans before the run ends.<br>
The noise was deafening, the adoration was Pope-like, and it only took 
Springsteen's first words (a bashful "Hello, my friends") to again tie 
the bond with devotees who've hungered for his return after four years 
absent from the stage.<br>
The night would prove a triumph, but this was not quite the same as 
past, supremely confident Springsteen shows. He wavered at times, 
especially in the first set, making this feel very much like a new 
start, even though he's just played a month in Europe.<br>
He fumbled early (his famed iron nerves showed signs of anxiety in his 
song introductions as well) as he searched to find a musical flow. He's 
been shuffling song lists dramatically -- at one show in Europe, for 
instance, he did eight songs from his best-selling "Born in the U.S.A." 
album, while other shows had only a few.<br>
Springsteen has so much eclectic material at this point in his career 
that it appears hard for him to pace shows as evenly as in the past. 
That was the problem at the start last night, as he rather awkwardly 
followed a feisty "Better Days" and "Local Hero" (which had the crowd 
roaring with regional pride) with a solo, coffeehouse version of an 
older hit, "Dancing in the Dark," which seemed like Sting doing "Message
 in a Bottle" after he left his band the Police. Worse, Springsteen 
followed with a surprisingly lame "Darkness on the Edge of Town," 
another old hit that failed to connect.<br>
But fortunately, once Springsteen found his sea legs, there was no 
stopping him. After a dance-club version of his TV spoof, "57 Channels 
(and Nothin' On)," complete with samples of TV interviews after the Los 
Angeles riots ("Prejudice hurts!" was the climactic sample), he went 
into another zone.<br>
He then turned a stately corner between the country desperation of "The 
River" to the hard-rocking catharsis of "Living Proof," about the joyful
 birth of his son, Evan James, two years ago. He'd found his flow -- and
 the optimism of his newer material (from his "Human Touch" and "Lucky 
Town" albums) was the catalyst.<br>
Since his last tour, Springsteen has been divorced, remarried and 
fathered two children. Those experiences made last night's show less of a
 party than before, but no less an honest look at where he is today, 
which is all Springsteen has ever promised. He talked several times 
about his kids ("Are there any moms and pops in the audience?" he asked)
 and got downright gushy about his guiding principle in 1992 -- love.<br>
"We have a sponsor tonight," he said. "I'm not going to sell you beer or
 sell you sneakers. Our sponsor is love. This next section of the show 
is for lovers only." There followed several new songs -- the anthemic 
"Leap of Faith" (about having "the guts" to fall in love), the R&amp;B 
raveup of "Man's Job" (with backup singer Bobby King coming forward to 
duet majestically) and the rollicking "Roll of the Dice," which closed 
the first set after 90 minutes.<br>
The second set was more like vintage Springsteen. Unexpectedly, he 
opened with three nuggets -- the sinuous "Prove It All Night," the 
keyboard-pumping "Cover Me" (during which he took one of his many tasty 
guitar solos last night), and the more inward "Brilliant Disguise," 
where his wife Patti Scialfa came out on vocal harmony, turning it into a
 lover's affirmation.<br>
Springsteen's new band didn't have the overall power of his longtime E 
Street Band (sorry, but let's not kid anyone about that), though 
holdover keyboardist Roy Bittan was the definite glue. One missed the 
shared musical wisdom and seasoning of the E Street Band (new guitarist 
Shane Fontayne, rushed some arrangements, while bassist Tommy Sims was 
not assertive at times), but Springsteen's ace in the hole was his new 
six-member backup chorus (keyed by Crystal Taliefero, formerly with Bob 
Seger and Billy Joel), whose enthusiasm breathed new life into 
home-stretch tunes like "Born in the U.S.A." and "Glory Days." Overall, 
this was a different Springsteen show, but it still scaled enough 
heights to please the faithful.<br>

<br>
Bruce Springsteen is ecstatic about the way his reunion tour with the E Street Band is going.<br>
"I'm the happiest I've ever been with the band," he said after his last 
show in Boston on Friday night. "I think they're playing better than 
ever. Everybody came in with a great attitude, and it's stayed that 
way."<br>
Sitting backstage at the FleetCenter in a workingman's T-shirt and 
jeans, Springsteen added that "everybody knows their roles and has 
improved their playing." He also was thrilled to have guitarists Nils 
Lofgren and Miami Steve Van Zandt onstage together for the first time. 
They were in the band during different eras.<br>
As for the future, Springsteen said there's "a long road to go" on this 
tour, but hinted broadly when the question of whether he would record 
with the band was raised. "For the past 25 years," he said, "I've made 
band records and acoustic records. And I'll continue to do that in the 
future."<br>
Springsteen noted that any friction with the E Street Band, which had 
not been together in the previous decade as he pursued other projects, 
was overblown by the media. "I've always stayed in touch with them," he 
said. "We've always remained friends."<br>
Springsteen's whole point on this tour, he emphasized, is to "be right 
here, right now, in the present. That's why I ask the crowd, `Are you 
alive right now?' I'm interested in the present."<br>
His renewed closeness with the E Street Band ("I really feel I'm playing
 with the full band for the first time") has enabled him to dig deep to 
play more than 70 songs on the tour, which already has entailed a 
European leg, then 15 shows in New Jersey and five in Boston.<br>
"In New Jersey, we were also rehearsing an hour a day," he said, noting that helped them to work up more material.<br>
His renewed faith in the band has also permitted him to "call a lot of 
audibles" during a given show. For instance, at Friday's three-hour 
finale at the FleetCenter, he diverted liberally from his planned song 
list, as the mood struck him. And his sense of experimentation was 
evident, as he opened with the surprise hard- rocking "Candy's Room," 
followed by "Ties That Bind" and "Adam Raised a Cain," both of which had
 opened other Boston shows last week. To stack that trio together was 
purely speculative, "but at the end of them, when I saw how the crowd 
reacted, I thought, `Wow, that worked.' "<br>
What has also worked is a pattern of stacking "Jungleland" and "Born to 
Run" together on the encores. "When we did that, things just exploded," 
he said. As for the noise of the audience, which sings along with a 
gusto that sometimes belies their years, Springsteen said: "I've been 
amazed by the reaction. I looked out tonight, and it was so loud that I 
saw some people had their fingers in their ears."<br>
Springsteen is most pleased to be able to showcase songs from his 
turning-point album, "Darkness at the Edge of Town," from 1978. As his 
manager, Jon Landau, said Friday, "We're not doing a lot of the hits." 
Instead, they're featuring such "Darkness" tunes as the title track, 
"Badlands," and "The Promised Land."<br>
"I thought when I wrote those songs that they'd be interesting to sing 
20 years later. I really wondered what it would be like," said 
Springsteen. "And now, they're a large part of the show."<br>
While known as his own harshest critic, Springsteen admitted that he's 
pleased with his performance so far. "I think there's more subtlety in 
my voice now," he said, crediting his solo tour in 1996 (for "The Ghost 
of Tom Joad" CD) for that.<br>
"And I still have the falsetto in my voice. Why it's still there is a 
mystery. Usually, I lose it because I'm singing so hard. But I think 
I've learned to sing better. I have more vocal range, and I'm really 
happy with that."<br>

MUSIC REVIEW<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN At: the Providence Performing Arts Center last night<br>
PROVIDENCE -- If you hoped Bruce Springsteen might lighten up after last
 winter's serious, grim-faced shows at Boston's Orpheum Theatre, then 
you got your wish last night. Springsteen still delved into the stark, 
John Steinbeck-informed story lines of his working-class "Ghost of Tom 
Joad" album, but he leavened this better-rounded, more personable show 
with needed comic relief.<br>
Springsteen, still playing in a solo acoustic format, unveiled two, 
newly written songs that were hysterical parodies of tabloid culture and
 late-night TV. The song "Sell It" poked fun at the infomercials of 
Dionne Warwick and Cher, levied a shot at Evil Knievel ("I thought he 
was dead") and seemed a belly-laughing sequel to Springsteen's earlier 
TV satire, "57 Channels (And Nothin' On)."<br>
The humor continued with a song played for the first time last night 
(and penned just yesterday afternoon). "There Will Never Be" swiped at 
tabloid sensationalism and the opening lines had the crowd roaring: 
"Princess Di may find another man/ Prince Charles may want to live in 
another's woman's underpants." That's a long way from Tom Joad, for 
sure. The tune went on to goof on Elizabeth Taylor, Elvis and Priscilla 
Presley, Jim Bakker and Tammy Faye . . . and you get the idea.<br>
A lighter-of-heart Springsteen, playing nine or 10 different songs than 
at the Orpheum show I caught, got silly again with his little-performed 
"Red Headed Woman," described as "one of the greatest songs ever about 
cunnilingus. But I don't know what the other contenders might be."<br>
It was good to see Springsteen smiling more, talking more and dealing 
with what he afterwards called "life's absurdities." But he also noted 
correctly that the show, humor aside, built "to the quieter moments." 
These came on "Across the Border" (with its high-lonesome wail), 
"Galveston Bay" (about discrimination toward Vietnamese fishermen in 
Texas) and a radically revised version of "Promised Land," accompanied 
by percussive tapping of his guitar, rather than the full chords of the 
version he closed his second Orpheum show with.<br>
To provide further balance in this constantly evolving solo show, 
Springsteen played more 12-string guitar (keying a stunningly dramatic 
"Darkness on the Edge of Town") and added some older catalog chestnuts 
such as "Point Blank" and the playful, love-affirming "Bobbie Jean."<br>
More talkative this time, Springsteen shared philosophical musings 
("Adulthood can feel like a constant battle against cynicism"), insights
 on children ("They're a window into the graces of the world"), memories
 of a Mexican friend he played cards with during a motorcycle trip 
through Arizona, together with memories of his own childhood ("there 
wasn't much art or culture in the house, everyone was just trying to 
keep their head above water") and dialogue quotes from John Ford's movie
 of "The Grapes of Wrath."<br>
It was all-purposed entertainment that made its underdog points clearly,
 but was delivered with a welcome, lighter touch that reflected more of 
Springsteen's true personality, not just his politics.</div>

MUSIC REVIEW Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band At: the Continental Airlines Arena, last night<br>
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. - Bruce Springsteen shocked the faithful last 
night. He tilted his show so heavily toward his new album that exactly 
half the set - 11 of 22 songs - was drawn from it. When was the last 
time you heard an artist do that, especially a superstar with a 30-year 
back catalog?<br>
Springsteen is undeniably proud of his new album, "The Rising," which 
was strongly influenced by the events of Sept. 11. And he put a lot of 
thought into last night's 2-hour-20-minute set (short by Springsteen 
standards). Yet he struggled to balance the seriousness of the new 
material with the more hedonistic, house-party standards woven into a 
night witnessed by a sold-out crowd of 20,000 fans at this tour debut at
 the Continental Airlines Arena.<br>
Springsteen put considerable thought into some of the ingenious segues -
 new song "Lonesome Day" into archival hit "Prove It All Night" and new 
tune "The Fuse" into the ultimate fan favorite, "Darkness on the Edge of
 Town." But only once did he play more than two old songs in a row. That
 came near the end with an exultant "Born To Run," "Thunder Road," and 
Glory Days" trilogy, which let the crowd up for air.<br>
A specific example of his difficulty in balancing the extremes of this 
set came when he launched into two of the most acutely painful new 
songs, "Empty Sky," (which alludes to the absence of the World Trade 
Center towers) and "You're Missing," about the death of a loved one in 
the 9/11 tragedy. "We're going to have a good time, but we need you to 
be real quiet for the next couple of songs," he said. But sensing the 
crowd's discomfort, he then talked of how "I took that last calming 
(urination) before I came out." The shtick was kind of funny, but 
awkward.<br>
The show started with the title track "The Rising," an anthem yearning 
for salvation and beautifully played by the E Street Band, which for 
this tour is augmented by violinist Soozie Tyrell, who also plays a key 
role on the album. And give Springsteen credit for the way some of the 
new songs were reworked from their studio versions. "Empty Sky," for 
instance, became a sparse folk song featuring just Springsteen and his 
wife/backup singer, Patti Scialfa. Also, the new qawwali song, "Worlds 
Apart," found Springsteen wailing over a Middle Eastern vocal sample, 
before guitarist Steve Van Zandt added a stunning, Pink Floyd-like coda.<br>
The constancy of the new tunes, however, suggested that Springsteen was 
trying too hard to force-feed them to the public, as though he were 
asking them to "take their medicine," as one fan remarked privately. It 
was a kind of paternalistic, preacher role that made you queasy at 
times.<br>
Some of the weaker new songs - the gooey "Waitin' on a Sunny Day" and 
"Countin' on a Miracle" - didn't add anything. But another new song, the
 Phil Spector-ish "Mary's Place," was Bruce-a-fied with an extended 
house-party jam in a "Jersey Shore style" that made it much more 
appealing than the lighter version on the album.<br>
Springsteen's choice of catalog tunes (especially later in the show) was
 likewise inviting, notably "Promised Land," "Badlands," and a seismic 
"Born in the USA," with the E Street Band pumping in vintage fashion.<br>
There was no erosion of skill (and saxophonist Clarence Clemons looked a
 bit trimmer and more energetic than last time), but it was just a 
question of what Springsteen asked them to play.<br>
One also has to wonder how this set will evolve. Because the band is 
doing only one show per city this tour (the multiple-date engagements 
will come during a return swing next year), it's likely that the set 
list will probably be more rigid than when Springsteen mixed it up last 
time. But, right now, he has to do some fine- tuning before he achieves a
 balance that works better than last night's debut.<br>

MUSIC REVIEW<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN<br>
At: the Worcester Centrum through tonight<br>
WORCESTER -- If there are any doubting Thomases left on the topic of 
Bruce Springsteen, then please refer them to last night's 
rocket-launching display. Lighting up the boards from start to finish, 
Springsteen reclaimed his glory days with a sweeping blast of 
high-flying "rock &amp; soul," to use his words.<br>
He was again a man possessed, singing into the wee hours (until 
midnight, at least) and wrenching every drop of emotion from his new 
band, from himself and from the 14,500 fans, some of whom may have come 
with some skepticism, but no doubt left with their loyalty renewed.<br>
Last night was a quantum leap from the erratic tour opener that this 
writer caught at the Meadowlands in New Jersey three weeks ago. 
Springsteen was confident throughout, discovering a rhythmic flow and 
riding it for all it was worth, right back to the absolute pinnacle of 
rock performance.<br>
Above all, his new band, awkward at that first outing, has coalesced 
proudly, finding their own identity and sound after a lot of invidious 
comparisons to Springsteen's bygone E Street Band. The new unit, led by 
metal-ready guitarist Shane Fontane and workhorse drummer Zachary Alford
 (a much more lively presence last night), now gives Springsteen the 
freedom to do just about any song from his 20-year repertoire, which is 
exactly what he did.<br>
Dressed like a prairie preacher in a black, baggy suit and vest, 
Springsteen opened up with the unrecorded "Red-Headed Woman" (a paean to
 his wife, Patti Scialfa), then ripped into three new songs, "Better 
Days," "Local Hero" (going down on bended knee like James Brown) and 
"Lucky Town," a guitar raveup that showed Springsteen to be more of a 
guitarslinger than ever before. (He takes more solos that were once 
taken by saxophonist Clarence Clemons.)<br>
Springsteen's first 90-minute set was filled with resonant combinations 
of songs. In heartfelt fashion, he strung together the oldies "Darkness 
on the Edge of Town" (where he hit an Ella Fitzgerald-like high note 
that shook the walls) and an acoustic "Spirit in the Night," with gospel
 harmonies from his six backup singers. But the best string was Jimmy 
Cliff's "Trapped" (with a stop-and-start drama framed by stunning 
computer lighting effects), a wonderfully edgy "Badlands" and the 
redemption of "Living Proof," about the birth of his son, Evan James, 
now 2.<br>
The set ended with a thrilling bar-band R&amp;B segment, as singer Bobby
 King came forward for "Man's Job" and "Roll of the Dice." But after a 
40-minute intermission, they all returned for nearly two more hours, 
pumping through more new tracks (the only mishap was a faltering "Book 
of Dreams"), together with stratosphere-bound classics like "Glory 
Days," "Born to Run," "Because the Night," "Thunder Road," "Born in the 
USA" and "Brilliant Disguise," with Scialfa on harmony. No doubt about 
it. Springsteen was back in full glory.<br>

<br>
A prime topic after Bruce Springsteen's tour-opening show at the 
Worcester Centrum Thursday was the conspicuous lack of some of his most 
famous songs. Those included two of his best-known '70s anthems, 
"Badlands" and "Thunder Road." The latter he once even dubbed his "birth
 song" and was often used to open concerts at that time.<br>
"He's dropped a lot of the old warhorses," Springsteen's biographer, 
Dave Marsh, said at a post-show press reception Thursday. "He's felt 
it's time he put them away. He's wondered if people would let him, but 
he just felt it was time."<br>
Springsteen didn't show up at the reception -- attended by a few dozen 
music writers from around the country -- but several members of his E 
Street Band did. Drummer Max Weinberg revealed how serious Springsteen 
has been about this new tour. "We rehearsed for six weeks -- that's the 
longest time we've ever taken," Weinberg said. "The last time out, for 
the 'Born in the U.S.A.' tour, I think we rehearsed about a week."<br>
Weinberg also thought the tour would continue well beyond the 
month-and-a-half for which it's now booked. "A production like this just
 has to," he said.<br>
Incidentally, the Boston Garden is still hoping to book Springsteen later in the tour. New Garden<br>

WEEKEND CD REVIEW<br>
Once a decade, Bruce Springsteen unstraps his electric guitar, goes 
acoustic, and makes music that marks him as a Woody Guthrie of his time.
 In the '80s, he issued "Nebraska," then came "The Ghost of Tom Joad" in
 the '90s, and now "Devils &amp; Dust," which arrives in stores Tuesday.<br>
The new disc has some seriously dark moments, but it's not as grim as 
"Tom Joad." That record was the poorest-selling of Springsteen's career,
 so he may have taken stock. The new album is again laden with humans on
 the edge ("These are all people who are in danger or at risk," 
Springsteen says in the DVD portion of this DualDisc), but five of the 
12 songs are filled with hope and optimism, providing much-needed 
release.<br>
"The characters on this record are all trying to find their way," 
Springsteen says on the DVD, which contains solo acoustic performances 
of five tunes. "Some do it somewhat successfully and some come to tragic
 ends."<br>
The net result is an emotional powerhouse a high-water mark of 
Springsteen's career that has seen him go from Asbury Park party boy to 
literary folk poet of the Western prairie and desert. He compels us to 
feel for the dust-swept soldier in the somber title track, the displaced
 street kid in "Black Cowboys" (which could serve as a companion piece 
to "Sinaloa Cowboys" from "Tom Joad"), the boy grieving his mother in 
"Silver Palomino," and the men who have found joy and salvation through 
committed love relationships in "All the Way Home" and "Leah."<br>
Although Springsteen spent last fall doing shows to support John Kerry's
 presidential campaign, there is an absence of political rhetoric, 
though the title track was inspired by the Iraq war. It was written just
 after the start of the war and deals with the anxiety of an American 
soldier, though Iraq is not specifically mentioned. "Fear's a dangerous 
thing and it can turn your heart black . . . I've got my finger on the 
trigger and tonight faith just ain't enough," Springsteen sings.<br>
The album, which contains songs he has written over the last 10 years, 
has more overall bounce than "Tom Joad." There is some twangy 
country-rock that could have fit onto Springsteen's "The River" album 
and though he sparingly uses a few members of his regular E Street Band 
(notably wife Patti Scialfa on harmonies), he stretches out by playing 
guitar, keyboards, and drums on the euphoric "All I'm Thinking About." 
He happily repeats that phrase 24 times as he depicts a man who can't 
wait to get home. "Ain't nothin' in this world I can do about it all I'm
 thinking about is you," he sings in a vein similar to "Mary's Place" 
from his previous album, "The Rising."<br>
The darker songs, however, are absolutely heart wrenching. "Reno" is 
unlike anything he has done a bluesy lament about a hooker who thinks 
she is really pleasing her client ("She poured me another whiskey, said 
`Here's to the best you ever had' "), yet the protagonist concludes, "It
 wasn't the best I ever had/ It wasn't even close." The graphic imagery 
includes a reference to a sex act and is responsible for the disclaimer 
on the CD jacket: "This song contains some adult imagery."<br>
Springsteen also explores the bonds between mothers and sons in several 
mournful numbers. The most affecting is "Silver Palomino," about a boy 
whose mother's hand "slips from his hair" as she dies. He then rides 
into the mountains and spies a palomino whose spirit is as untamed as 
his mother's. It's an exalting image. The song is followed by the 
lightly syncopated "Jesus Was an Only Son," describing one's mother as 
"a light you'll never see in another face."<br>
Further probing these bonds are the recitative "Black Cowboys" (about a 
son who runs away after his mother is corrupted by the law- breaking 
behavior of a new lover) and the spellbinding "The Hitter," about a 
boxer who has punched himself into a world of no restraint and mercy yet
 shows up at his mother's door on a rainy night, saying, "I ask of you 
nothin', not a kiss, not a smile/ Just open the door and let me lie down
 for a while."<br>
Springsteen, who performs a sold-out show at the Orpheum May 20, 
concludes with the prayerful piece de resistance, "Matamoros Banks." It 
ingeniously backtracks a man's journey from the bottom of the Rio 
Grande, where he has died after trying to cross the border from Mexico 
to Texas, back to the safety of his lover's arms at home.<br>
It's also a poignant highlight on the flip-side DVD, on which a 
black-garbed Springsteen sings alone in a dimly framed corner of a 
country house, lit only by an antique lamp. These live performances are 
more downcast than the overall tone of the album, and he adds an 
extended keening wail to "Matamoros Banks" that is absent from the CD 
version.<br>
Springsteen's songwriting has never been more precise. The balance he 
achieves on the album between light and dark, joy and despair, assures 
that it will touch his most diehard fans, even though it may be too real
 for a marketplace that seems to require an endless supply of escapism.<br>

Music Review Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band At: Gillette Stadium, last night and tonight<br>
FOXBOROUGH - There aren't very many people in this world who can pack a 
party dress, an honest day's work, and spiritual salvation with the same
 transformational power. It's why Bruce Springsteen is revered, and why 
last night's sold-out show at Gillette Stadium was a marvel of 
celebration and purpose.<br>
With few words and a far lighter load than he carried at last fall's 
FleetCenter show, Springsteen traversed backward from a last year's "The
 Rising" - a catalog of pain and faith that emerged from the wreckage of
 Sept. 11 - to a jubilant encore set that included "Mystery Train" 
(dedicated to the late Sam Phillips) "Born To Run," and "Dancing in the 
Dark."<br>
Cloudy skies perpetually threatened to open, and if they had this crowd 
hardly would have noticed. Springsteen and his E Street Band, which he 
called "the best little house band in the world," wielded the chiming, 
propulsive sound that's become a rock 'n' roll archetype like a 
protective shield. Here was all believers needed to endure a rainy 
concert or a troubled world: "Promised Land," "The Rising," and 
"Lonesome Day," a trio of anthems of faith and hope set in motion by 
Springsteen's mouthful of harmonica, Clarence Clemons's clarion blasts, 
and Max Weinberg's stately, rolling rhythm. A grown man's songs, they 
preached the redemption found in community.<br>
But with more warmth, humility, celebration, and conviction than you'll 
find in most houses of worship, let alone one man, Springsteen revived 
the young man's dreams. "Prove It All Night" whittled the meaning of 
life down to a kiss, with Springsteen playing one of many scathing 
guitar solos and Steve Van Zandt yelling in tuneful duet with his Boss. 
An hour into the show Springsteen was on his back, whooping through 
"Darlington County," and galloping across a stadium-wide catwalk 
inviting gospel levels of fervor during "Badlands."<br>
The centerpiece of the night was "Mary's Place." Springsteen kicked it 
off with rock's time-honored baptism-by-water-bottle, sang the band 
introductions in the middle, and cranked into party overdive with a 
joyous call-and-response of "I drop the needle and pray!" "Turn it up!"<br>
Springsteen's credibility is the tie that binds feel-good singalongs 
with mournful ballads: "Empty Sky" and "Into the Fire" made for 
graceful, quiet moments, which for better or worse many used as bathroom
 breaks. And it's his galvanizing grasp of the need for human connection
 that made that rowdy, chestnut-filled encore set the right time for 
what he called a public service announcement.<br>
"Demanding accountability from our leaders is our job as citizens," 
Springsteen said. "Playing with the truth during wartime . . . is always
 wrong." He dedicated "Land of Hope and Dreams" to the people of Iraq. 
All of that and "Rosalita," too, which sent 53,000 people home that much
 wiser and that much happier.<br>

<br>
My favorite Bruce Springsteen concert memory?<br>
Springsteen in 1978 at Boston Garden -- a site he loved because it was 
"low rent" and "sweaty." He leaps into the crowd during "Spirit in the 
Night," tears through the aisle, and jumps onto the chair next to mine. 
It's like sitting next to an electric generator. His eyes are wild and 
possessed, as he lifts them, along with his fist, toward the far 
balcony.<br>
It's a primal moment that lasts an instant in linear time, but no doubt a lifetime for anybody in that row of seats.<br>
Such close encounters have occurred many times when Springsteen has 
played the Boston area -- and, combined with a charisma that leaves most
 of his peers flat-footed, helps explains why all tickets to his 
upcoming five FleetCenter shows (Aug. 21, 22, 24, 26, 37) were sold in a
 single day.<br>
My Bruce baptism came shortly before that Garden show in 1978, when he 
played the Music Hall (now the Wang Center). He dashed around in a 
three-piece black suit (yes, this from the man who would later define 
the jeans-and-T-shirt look) and again jumped boldly into the crowd. He 
was unafraid because he always saw his fans as brothers and friends, 
rather than pawns to be fleeced in a marketing scheme.<br>
Springsteen opened that Music Hall show with "Badlands" -- the 
cornerstone of his "Darkness on the Edge of Town" album. Then, a few 
months later at the Garden, he opened with a complete change of pace -- 
the Wynonie Harris hit "Good Rockin' Tonight." (On the West Coast during
 that tour, he opened with Buddy Holly's "Rave On.")<br>
The point is, Springsteen is always changing in concert -- not to the 
extent that the Grateful Dead did from night to night, but enough to 
give the faithful more reasons to believe -- and more reasons to make 
him the Boss of the box office.<br>
Springsteen's new reunion tour with the E Street Band is a blockbuster, 
but he's been building a local fan base ever since his first Boston date
 at the now-defunct Paul's Mall in 1973. He followed with shows at 
Oliver's, Joe's Place, and Charlie's Bar (see timeline on Page N4), 
where his future biographer, Dave Marsh, then living in Somerville, saw 
him for the first time.<br>
"He and the band did everything from originals to Fats Domino to a 
classical prelude to `New York City Serenade,' " Marsh recalled in a 
recent phone interview. "And the next day, my thighs were sore. I 
realized I'd pounded them so hard in my clumsy, honky kind of way, 
because I had never experienced that kind of intensity before at a 
concert."<br>
I never saw Springsteen in a club, but have been an ardent convert since
 since the '78 Music Hall date. There's simply no one, Mick Jagger 
included, who can match his endurance (he played for 3 hours 30 minutes 
at one Worcester Centrum show in '84) and athleticism.<br>
Springsteen, now 49, has jumped on and off more stages, and more 
speakers, than most artists could count. As fellow performer and friend 
Bruce Hornsby said this week: "He's always worked hard and been willing 
to give up his body for the people. His energy level is way above 
everybody else's."<br>
Springsteen departed from his rock-as-Olympic-decathlon approach during a
 solo acoustic tour to back his more somber "Ghost of Tom Joad" album in
 1995-96. At one of his Orpheum shows on that tour, Springsteen even 
asked fans to be silent during his softer songs. It was a 
philosophically nourishing if not physically liberating show, though 
Springsteen flashed echoes of his old self when he pulled out a 
12-string guitar and wailed through "Darkness on the Edge of Town." That
 moment was worth the price of admission for most Springsteen diehards.<br>
The athletic Springsteen is back on this new tour, judging from the 
opening night this writer caught at the Meadowlands in New Jersey last 
month (the first of a record 15 nights at the Continental Airlines 
Arena). Springsteen wore out the rest of the band -- especially 
saxophonist Clarence Clemons, who was sweating profusely as he tried to 
keep up. Springsteen poured on the classics -- from "Thunder Road" to 
"10th Avenue Freezeout" -- and played for three hours, reminding fans of
 the glory days of the E Street Band.<br>
Those glory days date back 20 years, to when the Springsteen legend was 
cemented in Boston. Some of the many high points came during another 
series of shows at Boston Garden, in December 1980, backing his album 
"The River." During the song "Promised Land," he jumped to the front of 
the stage, shook his hands in the air, and screamed to fans, "What are 
you waiting for?"<br>
That night began with his signature anthem, "Born to Run." And before it
 was over, he ranged from an R &amp; B roadhouse style ("Cadillac 
Walk"), to country ("Wreck on the Highway"), acid rock ("Because the 
Night," complete with his own nerve-shredding guitar solo) and the 
sensitive parlor music of "4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)," featuring E
 Streeter Danny Federici on cafe-style accordion. Then there was the 
moment when Springsteen pulled a woman up to dance during "Sherry 
Darling" -- a gesture that would often be repeated a few years later 
when he sang his radio hit, "Dancing in the Dark."<br>
At that 1980 Garden show, Springsteen also delivered the between- song 
raps that were becoming a trademark. He talked a lot about his father, 
whom he said was "afraid to dream, afraid to think that things could 
ever get better." Such soul-baring would eventually become as important 
to fans as Springsteen's athletic and musical feats. He even gave 
long-in-advance hints of his future domesticity (he now has three 
children with Patti Scialfa, once a backup singer in the band). "Your 
dreams remain dreams until you take a chance with people," he said.<br>
At the Worcester Centrum in 1984, during the tour that celebrated his 
12-million-selling "Born in the U.S.A." disc, Springsteen talked about 
dreams again. He said that, as a child, listening to Elvis Presley had 
first set his mind free and allowed him to dream. "I'm real lucky," he 
said. "I get to live a little bit of my dream every night."<br>
By the time Springsteen and the E Street Band hit the Centrum in 1988 
(augmented by La Bamba Horns), he was asking the audience to think as 
much as to boogie. It was the "Tunnel of Love" tour, framed around a 
pensive album that was a reaction to the mega-celebrity breakthrough of 
"Born in the U.S.A." He did only two songs from the earlier album, 
instead adding four obscure B-sides -- a sign that he was asking to be 
judged as a songwriter, not a hit machine.<br>
Springsteen also indulged in more cabaret at that show than he has 
before or since. He pretended to buy tickets from a tuxedoed carny 
barker at a counter marked "Tunnel of Love Express Tour." He was dressed
 in a white shirt and cream-colored vest, and at one point he sat on a 
park bench on stage, reminiscing with Clemons about the days when they 
would stare at passing girls and discuss their romantic hopes. It was a 
little strange, but he still rocked home with the Bo Diddley beat of 
"She's the One" and the Lloyd Price-like New Orleans sound of "You Can 
Look." An acoustic "Born to Run" was another highlight.<br>
The magic was less apparent in 1992 when, after breaking up with the E 
Street Band (he wanted to do something different after so many years 
together), Springsteen returned to the Centrum with a pasted- together 
group of players that included Shane Fontayne on guitar and R&amp;B 
great Bobby King on vocals. The sole E Street holdovers were Scialfa (by
 then his wife) and keyboardist Roy Bittan.<br>
I had seen the opening night of the '92 tour in New Jersey and was not 
overly impressed, but the group had coalesced by the time it hit the 
Centrum and then Boston Garden, where J. Geils Band singer Peter Wolf 
joined Springsteen for an encore one night.<br>
Still, it was not enough to make diehards forget the E Street Band, 
which is why this summer of '99 reunion tour -- the first in a decade 
with his E Street comrades -- is a welcome jolt for fans looking to get 
their batteries recharged once again.<br>

WEEKEND MUSIC BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: STORYTELLERS ON: VH1 PREMIERING TOMORROW AT 10 P.M.<br>
If you caught Bruce Springsteen's Somerville Theatre shows two years 
ago, then you'll be right at home with tomorrow's episode of 
"Storytellers," in which he plays songs on acoustic guitar and piano, 
and talks about them in detail, offering insights as though this were a 
college seminar.<br>
Springsteen recently taped the VH1 special in a small theater in Red 
Bank, N.J. He sings two new songs ("Devils &amp; Dust" and "Jesus Was an
 Only Son"), but most of it is an illuminating trip through his 
archives. He starts with "Blinded by the Light," which he wrote at age 
23 while living above an abandoned beauty parlor in Asbury Park. "I 
wanted to get blinded by the light and do things that I hadn't done 
before," he says.<br>
In sometimes rambling but never uninteresting fashion, he imparts 
rapid-fire thoughts and sweeps through "Brilliant Disguise," joined by 
his wife, Patti Scialfa (the only time she appears). He follows with his
 9/11 anthem, "The Rising," stopping on almost every line to describe 
how a dying man will miss the "physicality" of his life, then explaining
 how the song changes to gospel music. And in "Devils &amp; Dust," 
prompted by the confusion of the Iraq war, he cites the "untenable 
choices" of an American soldier and "the price that inflicts in blood 
and in spirit." He further adds his concern for the "erosion of civil 
liberties" in the United States.<br>
Springsteen talks about divinity in "Jesus Was an Only Son" (before 
joking, "end of sermon"), then lightens up with the set- closing 
"Thunder Road," during which he shares his youthful belief that rock 'n'
 roll would lead to "a sense of a larger life and hopefully more and 
better sex." From the sacred to the profane, it's Bruce at the core<br>

ALBUM REVIEW<br>
Confusion reigns. Should we applaud Bruce Springsteen for making the 
most uncommercial record of his career? Or should we have his pulse 
checked? Maybe a little of both after hearing his new disc, "The Ghost 
of Tom Joad," which is easily the darkest, bleakest record of his 
career. It makes his earlier solo set of hard-luck tales, "Nebraska," 
seem like a sitcom.<br>
Springsteen has confounded us again. Where some fans expected a lively 
follow-up to his last two albums, "Lucky Town" and "Human Touch," he's 
opted to strip down his sound and tug at the heartstrings with an 
occasionally inspired, but also occasionally flat, set of songs. Instead
 of seeking the arena stardom of yore, Springsteen adopts the acoustic 
sparseness of a '90s Woody Guthrie, singing haunting songs about 
societal outcasts. (It will be followed by his first-ever solo acoustic 
tour, due to stop at the Orpheum Dec. 15 and 16.)<br>
The new album was sparked by the figure of Tom Joad, the Depression-era 
former convict/migrant worker in John Steinbeck's novel "The Grapes of 
Wrath." Joad crosses the country and is radicalized by what he sees. 
Joad's story is obviously on Springsteen's mind in the title track, 
where he sings: "I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light/ Waitin' on
 the ghost of Tom Joad/ Now Tom said, `Mom, wherever there's a cop 
beatin' a guy/ Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries/ Where there's a 
fight 'gainst the blood and hatred in the air/ Look for me Mom, I'll be 
there.' "<br>
Does this sound like election-year rhetoric? Could be. Springsteen is 
obviously no friend of the Newt Gingrich crowd. But there appears to be a
 deeper motive at work. Springsteen has always been on the side of the 
downtrodden and the down-on-their luck: Just look at the thousands of 
dollars he's given to food banks and to disabled Vietnam veterans 
through the years, or look at his continuing admiration for populists 
like Guthrie. This is a unifying thread in Springsteen's music dating to
 his scuffling days on the Jersey shore in the early '70s. He's a 
Beverly Hills millionaire now, but maybe the guilt of living in such 
palatial surroundings lures him even more to the campfires of Tom Joad.<br>
There is a nobility that courses through this album, much as it did in 
Guthrie's music. Springsteen, singing as passionately as ever, exudes 
sympathy for the prison convict of "Straight Time" who tries to lead a 
traditional family life but can't. He dignifies the Mexican migrant 
workers of "Sinaloa Cowboys" who find they can make more money making 
amphetamines in a hidden desert laboratory than in picking peaches. One 
of the brothers dies when the lab blows up in an accident. Springsteen, 
in a melancholy twang, describes the one left behind: "He kissed his 
brother's lips and put him in his grave." Or, as he quotes the brothers'
 father as saying: "For everything the north gives, it exacts a price in
 return."<br>
Death haunts this album, more so than any album that Springsteen has 
made. And the scary thing is that he's talking about contemporary 
situations, not about Dust Bowl farmers in the '30s. In the unutterably 
sad "Balboa Park," he looks at the forlorn "border boys" who turn tricks
 for the "men in their Mercedes" in San Diego. One of the boys, Spider, 
is hit and killed by the car of a border patrol officer in a nighttime 
raid. Sings Springsteen in hushed horror: "As the car sped away, Spider 
held his stomach/ Limped to his blanket 'neath the underpass/ Lied there
 tasting his own blood on his tongue/ Closed his eyes and listened to 
the cars rushin' by so fast."<br>
That's not all. In "The New Timer," featuring just Springsteen and his 
softly played acoustic guitar, a railroad hobo is killed on "a muddy 
hill" with no witnesses, leading the protagonist, a once-innocent youth 
from Pennysylvania, to sleep with a machete by his side. And in the 
plaintive "Galveston Bay," trouble erupts between Vietnamese immigrants 
and the Texas Klan whose slogan is "America for Americans." One 
Vietnamese fisherman kills two Texans in self-defense and becomes a 
marked man. Having come from Saigon, he's a Vietnamese who once "fought 
side by side with the Americans." The irony is not lost on Springsteen 
or on us.<br>
The album's best songs are "Dry Lightning" (about a man who falls in 
love with an exotic dancer) and "Youngstown," a saga of a family 
seemingly doomed to work in factories from generation to generation. 
It's the only song that rises above a slow tempo (unlike the case with 
"Nebraska," which had a couple of uptempo numbers), and is enhanced by 
violinist Soosie Tyrell, bassist Garry Tallent and keyboardist Danny 
Federici. The last two are members of Springsteen's longtime E Street 
Band, but they're the only E Streeters on the album. Not even 
keyboardist Roy Bittan is there this time.<br>
Would Springsteen's record label have preferred a reunion album with the
 E Street Band? You bet. Instead they got an album that will have a hard
 time getting airplay. Rock radio won't play this; it's difficult to 
imagine where it will get played, given radio's preference for lulling 
escapism rather than the harsh realities this disc portrays. In fact, 
the only truly hopeful song is "Across the Border," about a man dreaming
 of meeting his lover. "For what are we without hope in our hearts/ That
 someday we'll drink from God's blessed waters," Springsteen sings 
before adding a stately harmonica coda.<br>
As for the album's slow tempos, Springsteen appears to be following his 
Oscar-winning song about AIDS, "Streets of Philadelphia." That song had a
 grandeur, though, that some of these newer, more repetitious songs 
don't have. This album is likely to become an asterisk on Springsteen's 
career. It's heartfelt, but it tries a little too hard to be convincing,
 even down to the inside photo of Springsteen, in a cowboy hat, standing
 by a desolate prairie highway.<br>
True fans, however, will recall that Springsteen followed his 1982 
"Nebraska" album with "Born in the U.S.A.," the most popular record of 
his career. Maybe he's building up to a similar return to rock glories 
now that he's gotten the anguished "Tom Joad" out of his system.<br>

BOOK REVIEW SPRINGSTEEN POINT BLANK By Christopher Sandford Da Capo Press, 446 pp., $18<br>
Bruce Springsteen has become the Paul Bunyan of rock 'n' roll. His 
legend grows every time he picks up a guitar or gives money to a food 
bank, or wins a Grammy or an Oscar or just about anything else in sight.
 He's the Jersey Shore kid who made good, though he's also a complex man
 who was nagged by self-doubt and poverty for years before his dreams 
bore fruit.<br>
Christopher Sandford's new biography, "Springsteen Point Blank," is a 
loving yet unflinching portrait of a man who was a C and D student in 
Catholic schools growing up, but has since become a rock poet often 
compared with Bob Dylan. The young Springsteen was "a hybrid god who 
sounded like Elvis casually colluding with Dylan in an echo chamber," 
writes Sandford, an articulate Briton who has done books on Mick Jagger,
 Kurt Cobain, Sting, and David Bowie.<br>
Sandford did not gain access to Springsteen (few media types do, because
 of his tenacious love of privacy), but he still compiled a deft account
 based on exhaustive research and interviews with Springsteen friends 
and observers from Elvis Costello to Pete Seeger, and from Norman Mailer
 to "perennial presidential hopeful Bill Bradley," a Springsteen friend 
for many years.<br>
The author does a fine job of exploring the Springsteen myth, and the 
reality behind it. He gives Springsteen full credit for paying dues to 
become a concert attraction second to none - and a painstaking craftsman
 who thought nothing of scrawling 20 drafts of a song, or doing 
three-hour sound checks before a show began.<br>
"The real Springsteen was, at heart, an ordinary man who happened to 
have the gift of seeming both a best friend and an effigy," writes 
Sandford. "He loved his wife, baseball and burgers. He could be 
cheerfully crude after the second beer. But he also felt an obligation 
to play - to give something back, beyond the coy, call- and-response 
japes of the megabands."<br>
Springsteen grew up poor in Freehold, N.J., where his father, Doug, had a
 "failed career in the rug mill and the plastics factory," the author 
writes. It was Springsteen's battles with his father that shaped his 
music. A tempestuous sort, Doug once threw a beer can at his son during 
an argument and nearly beaned him. But at age 14, Springsteen got his 
first Fender guitar, played it up to six hours a day, and thus found an 
outlet and an escape from tensions at school and at home.<br>
Although record labels initially took a dim view of Springsteen ("The 
loon-panted moguls reserved their loftiest contempt for Jersey 
greasers," writes Sandford), Springsteen played endless gigs around the 
Jersey Shore until he got their attention. But his early albums sold 
poorly, and it didn't help that he signed a deal "on a car roof in an 
unlit parking lot" with first manager Mike Appel, portrayed as "part 
grunt and part guru." Springsteen later had to go to court in a messy 
fight to unseat Appel when new manager Jon Landau arrived on the scene.<br>
Springsteen's music eventually became larger than life - his "Born in 
the USA" album sold 12 million copies - but Sandford also looks at the 
insecurities behind the scenes. He says that Springsteen's self- doubts 
made him frequently seek out the sympathy of groupies. He had a 
"gladiatorial sex life" featuring "dozens of women who filled out the 
time between gigs."<br>
In the late '80s, Springsteen's first marriage, to model Julianne 
Phillips, flopped (a 1989 divorce settlement brought her $20 million), 
but his second, to backup singer Patti Scialfa, has lasted through three
 children. Springsteen is said to be an excellent father who can 
"play-act or read Dr. Seuss by heart" and who has coached his son Evan's
 Little League team.<br>
The book is most compelling, however, in its description of how 
Springsteen's social conscience grew as he matured. The kid who hardly 
read anything became an expert on Flannery O'Connor and John Steinbeck, 
among other authors, as his experience of the world widened. And 
Springsteen put his money where his heart was. He gave thousands of 
dollars to food banks ($35,000 in Dallas alone, during one tour stop), 
to miners' wives, to Amnesty International, and even $100,000 
anonymously to help an Arizona club owner cope with the bills for his 
cancer treatment.<br>
He became a man who "flatly contradicted the conventional wisdom of a 
star utterly in thrall to PR," writes Sandford. "Springsteen cared." The
 book's narrative ends late last year - before Springsteen's recent 
reunion tour with the E Street Band - but it's a worthy analysis of 
rock's most generous soul and, at long last, family man. This book makes
 one realize Springsteen deserves any peace he has found.<br>

MUSIC REVIEW<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN<br>
At: the Orpheum Theatre last night; through tonight<br>
Bozo the fan yelled to Bruce Springsteen during a silent moment, early in the two-hour set, last night: "Welcome back, Boss!"<br>
Springsteen to Bozo: "Aw, shaddup."<br>
This really happened. As did a post-first song lecture about how his new
 songs were written -- "with a lot of silence" -- and what proper 
audience behavior consisted of -- "I don't need any whistling or cheers 
to let me know how well or poorly I'm doing." Later, a Bozette yells: "I
 love you, Bruce!" Springsteen: "Too much love drives a man insane." 
Another star-struck scream gets this from the ponytailed man on stage, 
no longer a memeber of the torn, tight blue jeans club for men: "I don't
 get any pleasure out of that, darlin'." He welcomed an "audience 
police" that would turn to the annoying unwashed and ask them to "Shut 
the {expletive} up."<br>
Santa Claus did not come to town last night at the Orpheum Theatre. 
Dollars to dimes, he won't be there tonight, either. Even with 
Springsteen -- whose "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town" has been a seasonal
 treat for nearly two decades -- at center court. The thing is, it's a 
relatively hushed court. It's reinvention time. Anthemic, uplifting 
Bruce is on holiday; somber, sober-minded, story-song slinger Bruce is 
plucking away acoustically, blowing harp and singing about death, blood 
and guts and not a whole lot of redemptive possibility. There ain't no 
"barefoot girl sittin' on the hood of a Dodge, drinking warm beer in the
 soft summer sun." There ain't any talk of "Better Days." These days, 
there's a guy blown up in a crystal-meth lab, "men walkin' long the 
railroad tracks/Goin' someplace there's no goin' back," and a whole 
bunch of folks out of work, squashed by corporate greed and 
indifference.<br>
A telltale sign that even the most wide-eyed of Springsteen's following 
was figuring this out last night: The calls of "BROOOOCE!" subsided in 
number and volume as the night went on.<br>
Springsteen's latest album, "The Ghost of Tom Joad," is the centerpiece 
of this small-theater tour -- that and radical reworkings of songs such 
as "Adam Raised a Cain," "Darkness on the Edge of Town" and "Born in the
 USA."<br>
So, you're thinking, what got in his tea? Sure, he took us down the the 
grim American underbelly with "Nebraska" in 1982, but with this one's 
he's turned the palette from dark gray to coal black. The light bits, 
generally, come in the between-song gab, or, at the end of the set, with
 the florid "Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?" from his first album 
and "This Hard Land" from his `Greatest Hits."<br>
Perhaps, "Steets of Philadelphia," played as an encore last night, 
forced him down a path of no return. Perhaps, he heard Warren Zevon's 
"The Indifference of Heaven" where Zevon, (via a desperate stickup man) 
chides his old collaborator (they co-wrote "Jeannie Needs a Shooter") 
singing that those who proclaim better days are coming, "they don't live
 around here -- Bruce and Patti don't." Maybe, Springsteen picked up the
 gauntlet. Or maybe he just, again, realized like Neil Young (with 
"Tonight's the Night") and Lou Reed (with "Berlin"), that success grants
 a certain artistic license to brood, to work with dark areas not 
usually part of the pop terrain.<br>
For Springsteen, last night's show was nothing less than deconstruction,
 bordering on catalog deletion. And, there's some bitter irony there. 
That catalog made him the rich, well-respected man that he is; he 
certainly doesn't think an unknown artist who put out "Tom Joad" would 
be packing the Orpheum for two nights at $30 a ticket. No, the fans were
 there because of the legacy, the memories of good times and the hope 
that Springsteen would wrest some pleasure out of these painful songs.<br>
He did. Not consistently -- and especially not near the end where the 
toll became wearing. When Springsteen's protagonist-mule swallowed the 
balloon of cocaine, I almost laughed. We know Bruce favors the working 
man, but another (after "Sinaloa Cowboys") messed-up drug guy we're to 
sympathize with?<br>
Springsteen almost double-timed it through "Darkness on the Edge of 
Town," turning it strident and clamorous. "Adam Raised a Cain" had a 
whole new melody. The most striking reconfiguration was, as promised, 
"Born in the USA," which Springsteen introduced as part of a line of 
misinterpeted songs from "Louie, Louie" to "This Land Is My Land." 
Mostly, those who got it wrong, he said were, "young children and 
Republicans." That brought a chuckle, but for Bruce not to bear part of 
the blame is a tad disingenuous. It was styled as a major-chord rock 
anthem; its chorus sounds proud and resonant; the album cover features 
Old Glory (and Bruce's be-jeaned butt). The hapless grunt sent to kill 
"the yellow man" in Vietnam is full of rage, but you have to fight 
against the spirit of the chorus to get there and not want to wave a 
(tattered) flag. It is more work than most fans want to give it, and 
Springsteen probably should have considered that when he wrote it.<br>
Last night, Springsteen stripped away the chorus and rejiggered it via 
slide guitar as a mean country-blues song. Go ahead, Ronald Reagan, make
 my day! Find the jingoism in that.<br>
Springsteen's sentiments are pretty much always noble, liberal, on the 
side of the working man, not the shareholders. "Youngstown," about 
laborers no longer needed in today's age, hit home and hit hard.<br>
He doesn't pretend to be the answer man; fame hasn't made him put up 
blinders to those who less fortunate; he's, obviously, chosen the hard 
way over the easy way, as an artist. Heck, he even admits to finding out
 about Tom Joad in "The Grapes of Wrath" from the John Ford movie, not 
the John Steinbeck novel. No elitism there. But last night's set 
suffered from good intentions -- too long, too much compassion fatigue 
-- and was bogged down, frankly, by songwriting that is just too linear.
 One doesn't demand the epic sweep of a "Jungleland," the spine-tingling
 jolts of a "Candy's Room" or the timeless pop lilt of a "Because the 
Night." But, sonically speaking, you wanted hints of these things, more 
than the bare-bones folkie framework Springsteen offered.</div>

<strong class="text-strong"> - BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN AND THE E STREET BAND At: the FleetCenter last night</strong><br>
<br>
Let's face it, Bruce Springsteen has owned Boston in the past week. Five
 sold-out shows -- and countless memories for fans who have seen him 
prove it all night again. His FleetCenter engagement has been like no 
other. Sure, the Rolling Stones banged out two shows and created some 
excitement earlier this year, but they arrived under a cloud of greed 
and a take-the-money-and-run tone. Springsteen, on the other hand, 
ignited the city. "The electricity has been unbelievable," said promoter
 Don Law, whose company presented the band and some crew members with 
DVD players (with help from title sponsor Tweeter) in honor of this 
record-setting run in which Springsteen's group drew an overall 98,500 
fans to the Fleet.<br>
It ended last night with another maximum-strength rock party, with 
Springsteen and the E Street Band turning it up yet another notch.<br>
Last shows of a long run are always special occasions -- examples being 
the sixth night of the Grateful Dead's annual campout at Boston Garden, 
the fifth that Billy Joel once played at the Worcester Centrum, and the 
record ninth that the band Boston played at the Centrum.<br>
Last night was marked by a very rare performance of the poetic "N.Y.C. 
Serenade," with Springsteen's wife, Patti Scialfa, singing piquant 
harmonies. Springsteen biographer Dave Marsh, who was at the show, said 
Springsteen hadn't performed the song in 20 years.<br>
A further treat was the galvanizing cameo by J. Geils Band singer Peter 
Wolf, who burst out during the encores to sing and dance (sometimes in a
 line-dance formation with a smiling Springsteen) on the dance-fevered 
"Raise Your Hand." Wolf had also come out on the last night of 
Springsteen's Boston Garden run in 1992.<br>
As for Springsteen, he was like a runaway express all night. During a 
mid-set blast through "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out," he jumped on Roy 
Bittan's white piano, ripped off his vest (to reveal a totally 
sweat-drenched shirt), paused to exhort the crowd on all sides (until 
the volume level was deafening), then jumped down and slammed the tune 
to its finish.<br>
The all-out, goodbye-to-Boston pace was set from the start with a 
levitating "Candy's Room" (with drummer Max Weinberg pounding his skins 
like an anvil), then "Ties That Bind" (which he had opened last 
Saturday's show with), the near-tribal "Adam Raised a Cain," and the 
horn-stoked "Prove It all Night," with a great call-and-response vocal 
joust with band mate Miami Steve Van Zandt (who, by the way, has a new 
album coming out soon entitled "Born Again Savage").<br>
Springsteen went on later than usual (at 8:25), but played for three 
hours and blew right past the FleetCenter's 11:00 curfew. After the week
 he's had, let's see someone have the gall to fine him for that. Some 
rules are meant to be broken and this is one of them.<br>
While Springsteen rocked well into the night, he did hush things down 
for what might have been the showpiece song of the set, "Pointblank," a 
scary, walk-the-tightrope passion story about getting in over one's 
head: "One false move, baby, and the lights go out," he sang, summoning 
genuine chills.<br>
Most of the night, however, was sing-along catharsis: "Badlands," 
"Jungleland," "Light of Day," an electric "Born to Run," and "Out in the
 Street," with saxman Clarence Clemons singing a verse to huge applause.
 The cool-down came later with staples "If I Should Fall Behind" and 
"Land of Hope and Dreams."<br>
Springsteen waxed grateful at the end. "We just had a great time and had
 fantastic crowds every night," he shouted. "We just want to thank you 
for an incredible reception."<br>
And then what everyone wanted to hear in hopes this E Street reunion 
will continue: "We'll do the best we can for you in the future."<br>

MUSIC REVIEW Bruce Springsteen At: the FleetCenter, last night<br>
Two months into his tour in support of "The Rising," Bruce Springsteen 
is still finding his way: to the complicated heart of his new songs and 
to a new sort of connection with his audience. And that's precisely how 
it should be.<br>
Not only the set list but the very soul of the show was dominated by 
material from the new album, a catalog of pain and faith that emerged 
from the wreckage of Sept. 11. Springsteen can no longer rely on the 
familiar combustability; archetypal anthems and passionate power chords 
are no longer the matter of the day. So the artist is searching for that
 elusive place on the concert stage where the weight of the world and 
desires of his fans converge.<br>
He's making an admirable go of it. With every member of the E Street 
Band in black, the show opened with the galvanizing title song off "The 
Rising," followed by the disc's opening track, the rootsy "Lonesome 
Day." Both are inspired by grief but anchored in hope and the redemptive
 power of community. Fans seemed at a loss as to what to do with their 
arms and vocal cords - both of which are generally in constant use 
during a Springsteen show. But his following is nothing if not devoted, 
and seemed to appreciate his solemn effort to make sense of the 
senseless, even if it didn't always translate to the transcendent 
performance they've come to expect.<br>
Powerfully mournful songs like "The Fuse" and "Empty Sky" - during which
 the lyric "I want an eye for an eye" elicited cheers from the crowd - 
were peppered with loose, feel-good chestnuts. The youthful muscularity 
of "Prove It All Night" and the joyous revelry of "The Promised Land" 
sometimes felt like jarring shifts on the heels of "You're Missing" - a 
heart-rending portrait of loss sung with eyes closed, open hands raised.
 But the concert wound up feeling strangely cohesive, with new and old 
songs like the sides of a coin: terrible trials eased by the salve of 
human connection.<br>
"Waitin' On a Sunny Day," the brightest ray of hope on the new album, 
was performed a third of the way through last night's set, and it worked
 like a tonic on Springsteen. He seemed to remember he had a body, and 
began dancing and smiling, cascading across the stage on his knees, and 
doing a deep back-bend to accompany Clarence Clemens's churning 
saxophone solo. But the most potent reminder of just how strong a thread
 runs through old and new came via the back- to-back punch of "Badlands"
 and "She's the One," when 20,000 spirits lifted en mass. The defiance 
and release of those songs made a riveting case for the healing power of
 rock 'n' roll.<br>
Springsteen, who participated in ceremonies at the Leonard P. Zakim 
Bridge yesterday afternoon, dedicated "My Hometown" to the Zakim family,
 describing him as "a guy who did all the things I sing about." 
Springsteen, too, has become the guy he sings about - articulating our 
feelings with compassion and grace.<br>

Author:	Duffy, Thom<br>
Date:	Jul 31, 1999</strong><br>
<br>
Thom Duffy is international deputy editor of Billboard.<br>
Bruce Springsteen's current reunion tour with his E Street Band is a flashback for many.<br>
Fourteen years have passed since Springsteen's most successful tour was 
accompanied by this same group of musicians. Back then, his album, "Born
 in the USA," dominated pop culture and Billboard's pop album chart, 
selling more than 15 million copies.<br>
However, this tour is no mere nostalgic fling for Springsteen and his 
baby-boomer fans, no easy trip back to their glory days. While still 
giving fans three hours of roof-raising rock 'n' roll, Springsteen is 
presenting an urgently needed perspective on the high-flying economy of 
the '90s. He is singing about the darkness on the edge of boom town.<br>
Springsteen also offered this uncompromising vision during his earlier 
"Born in the USA" tour. Back then, Ronald Reagan was in the White House,
 and it was morning in America -- at least, if Reaganomics played in 
your favor. But the characters in Springsteen's songs often had fallen 
through the safety net. They were lucky to be working on the highway, 
laying down the blacktop.<br>
In the past decade, however, a lot of Springsteen's fans no doubt have 
done pretty well for themselves. Their stocks are up. Unemployment is 
down, so they've got jobs. Shelling out $37.50 to $67.50 for a seat at a
 Springsteen concert -- or bidding a lot more for tickets on the 
Internet -- is no problem.<br>
Yet Springsteen's songs of working life still echo the insecurity and 
anger of many of his aging fans. They know the strength of today's stock
 market doesn't mean they'll have a job tomorrow. A study earlier this 
year by International Survey Research of Chicago found that anxiety 
about job security is three times higher now than it was during the 
recession of 1980-81.<br>
Springsteen's evocations of economic uncertainty have struck a chord 
with his fans in Europe even more than in the United States, perhaps one
 reason why he opened his concert tour abroad this spring. For example, 
unemployment in Germany, Europe's largest music-buying market, topped 
10.6 percent in the past year, with joblessness rates even higher among 
the young.<br>
Springsteen's socially charged acoustic album, "The Ghost of Tom Joad," 
released in 1995, has sold twice as many copies in international markets
 as it has at home, despite its focus on dispossessed workers in 
America. Maybe it's because his European fans, watching refugees cross 
nearby borders, understand when they hear Springsteen sing: "Shelter 
line stretchin' 'round the corner/Welcome to the new world order."<br>
The insecurity of many American workers in the '90s boom can't compare. 
But it is real. Jobs are relocated, redefined or eliminated. Rising 
sales and profits are no guarantee against worker upheaval.<br>
Consider the music business, where US album sales rose 9.1 percent last 
year, yet an estimated 3,000 employees saw their jobs disappear in the 
merger of two major record companies, PolyGram and Universal Music.<br>
Those layoffs were not unique by any means. Major layoffs this year have
 followed news of plant closings by Levi Strauss, a reorganization at 
Procter &amp; Gamble, the purchase of Netscape Communications by America
 Online, the BP-Amoco oil company merger and more.<br>
Now Springsteen is back on the road with a reminder that, even in this 
robust economy, there are plenty of people who are not rolling in it, 
who are a little bit scared, feeling as if the future is not quite in 
their control. No popular artist of this day has given voice to the 
anxiety and anger of workers -- white or blue collar -- as passionately 
as Springsteen: "Now, sir, you tell me the world's changed/ once I made 
you rich enough/ rich enough to forget my name!" howls an unemployed 
steelworker in Springsteen's song, "Youngstown."<br>
Another song which Springsteen has performed during his shows speaks to 
the violence of America's gun-ridden culture. But it carries the double 
meaning of business interests that kill a worker's spirit in its very 
title, "Murder Incorporated."<br>
But Springsteen also will offer his fans something more uplifting during
 his concerts this summer: a blissful, cathartic escape for the moment 
and a continuing belief in the possibilities of this promised land.<br>
"So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young 
anymore," sang Springsteen to his audience this spring, in a 
well-remembered lyric. "Show a little faith, there's magic in the night .
 . . "<br>
When Bruce Springsteen performs, the magic and faith come easily -- even to those facing uncertain times.<br>

MUSIC / ROCK NOTES<br>
Have folk guitar, will travel.<br>
That's Bruce Springsteen's job description this year. Like a modern-day 
Woody Guthrie, he has kept his promise to bring his solo acoustic show 
-- filled with working-class message songs -- to the highways of the 
world.<br>
"Get your acoustic guitar and you can go anywhere," Springsteen said. "It's so freeing."<br>
Springsteen just finished a tour of Europe to support his stark, 
social-protest disc, "The Ghost of Tom Joad," and is about to start a 
new round of US dates. To symbolize his populist stance, many of the 
shows will occur outside big cities, such as Thursday's stop at the 
Providence Performing Arts Center and a Nov. 14 visit to Lowell Memorial
 Auditorium. (Both shows are sold out.)<br>
Springsteen also now realizes he's "outside" the mainstream of today's 
music scene. That's quite an admission from an artist who defined the 
mainstream back in the '80s when he and the E Street Band sold 12 
million copies of "Born in the U.S.A."<br>
By contrast, his latest album, featuring story songs about hard-luck 
Americans and immigrants, has done well in Europe, but not in the United
 States, where radio programmers have given it a cool reception.<br>
"At this point in my life, I see the {US} music scene and the music 
business as relatively inhospitable," Springsteen said during a Boston 
interview with this writer (and Bill Flanagan of VH1) on the first leg 
of the tour.<br>
"But I feel a greater sense of purpose now. I have a greater idea of 
what my job is, who I am and what I want to do not just this year but in
 the future -- and it's pretty much outside the general thrust of the 
music business. But that's OK.<br>
"With this particular show, I just really felt at home again in some 
strange way. Yet, at the same time, the show is fundamentally rooted in 
the present. It doesn't trade off my past in any major way. It's 
completely non-nostalgic. It's not based on `Glory Days' or whatever you
 want to call it."<br>
The "Tom Joad" album happened organically -- and somewhat by accident.<br>
"I actually made two records. When I went to do this material, I had a 
small live band with Danny Federici and Gary Tallent {two E Street 
members} and Gary Malabar and Marty Rifkin on steel guitar. And it was a
 mixture of things that went from real standard country with steel 
guitar, through rockabilly music, through the stuff that was the story 
songs. But as I listened to it, it always seemed like the story songs 
were the heart of it. The other stuff was lighter; and some of it was 
just completely roots-rock dance music and country swing. I recorded 35 
songs."<br>
A narrowing of focus came after singer/friend Lyle Lovett heard the 
studio tape. "He was the first guy I played it for. He said, `Well, you 
know, the story stuff is the hardcore stuff.' He was right, so I decided
 to set it up so people couldn't miss it. I didn't want to put it in a 
situation where there were a couple of story songs and a couple of dance
 tunes and rockabilly things, then a couple more story songs. Finally, 
it seemed, the only way to go was as hard as we could go straight down 
the line."<br>
Critics have compared "Tom Joad" to an earlier Springsteen disc, 
"Nebraska," an intimate record that was followed by the rave-up 
electricity of "Born in the U.S.A." Some fans have wondered if a similar
 pattern might occur after "Tom Joad."<br>
"I don't really plan like that," said Springsteen. "When I did 
`Nebraska,' I had half of `Born in the U.S.A.' written. At one point 
after `Nebraska,' I said, `Gee, I'd like to make another record like 
that.' But I had half of `Born in the U.S.A.' and I knew there were two 
or three things on it that I really wanted to get out.<br>
"But I don't know if somebody can make that kind of record here and 
now," he said of "Born in the U.S.A." "It seems as if it's a different 
world out there in some fashion. And I don't know really what I'm going 
to be doing. But like I say, I have a sense stylistically of where I'm 
going and what I feel I need to do. . . . I'm just trying to follow the 
voices in my head."<br>
Those voices keep telling Springsteen to hammer away at the division of 
wealth in the United States. "In every study, the division of wealth is 
increasing," he noted. "And the debate is how much we are cutting back 
and can cut out of the budget -- not whether some people actually need 
more assistance. It's always how much money to take away. But what about
 the people who don't have much to start with?<br>
"That's at the core of what I'm trying to do. It's a search for beauty, 
and in beauty there is hope, and in hope there is some sense of divine 
love, of faith, of community and possibility, of things that would 
combat the brutality and the violence and the suffering. That's what I'm
 trying to lay out there. It's a survival guide.<br>

<br>
The evening of May 9, 1974, is legendary in the annals of rock 'n' roll.
 It was the night the little-known Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street 
Band opened for Bonnie Raitt at Harvard Square Theater, dazzling the 
critic Jon Landau into writing "I saw rock &amp; roll future and its 
name is Bruce Springsteen" in the local alternative weekly The Real 
Paper. Now a tape from that night - one of the most revered in rock 
history - has emerged as a museum object 36 years after the storied 
event.<br>
The tape, never available for public hearing, is included in the 
Springsteen exhibit "From Asbury Park to the Promised Land" at 
Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, on display through 
summer. It has been digitalized and streams to a single listening 
station, where two people at a time can listen to it on headphones. It 
is not available on the museum's website, nor can a copy be purchased in
 the museum store.<br>
The sound has some rough patches, and there are no seats for relaxing. 
But the radical effect of the music on the audience then (this writer 
was there and can attest to that) can still be felt. The band aims for 
the mystically transcendent one minute and party-hearty, sax-fueled 
retro-rock raucousness the next, keeping everyone off guard. Springsteen
 was in Cambridge to promote his second album, "The Wild, the Innocent 
and the E Street Shuffle."<br>
The idea for an exhibit centering on Springsteen's career came about 
because the Hall of Fame's induction ceremonies were going to be in 
Cleveland last year and chief curator Jim Henke wanted a big show to 
accompany it. He approached Springsteen, who had been inducted in 1999. 
Springsteen agreed and provided items ranging from his "Born to Run" 
Fender Esquire guitar to his favorite songwriting table.<br>
The exhibit drew so well in 2009 - 423,000 visitors - that it has been 
extended into this summer, with newer artifacts added, including the 
jacket he wore to President Obama's inauguration, his 2009 Kennedy 
Center award, and the Golden Globe he won for "The Wrestler." But it is 
the Harvard Square tape that remains one of the most fascinating parts 
of the exhibit, just as that night itself remains an enduring, pivotal 
moment in the Boss's career.<br>
"It was my idea to include it, because that show is so famous because of
 Landau's review," Henke says. "So we contacted [Springsteen's 
organization], and they had a tape of the songs played there. He and the
 E Street Band were a great live band, and that does come through in 
those tracks."<br>
Springsteen's band at the time of the Harvard Square booking featured a 
pianist with strong jazz and classical leanings, David Sancious. (He 
left in August 1974.) It is Sancious who makes the band's first 
impression so strong, opening with a long, melancholy, and ruminative 
solo on "New York City Serenade." It slowly leads into Springsteen's 
yearningly searching vocal, with the impressionistic, romanticized 
lyrics that seem part Bob Dylan's "Desolation Row" and part Lou Reed's 
"Walk on the Wild Side." The song was aiming for theatrical grandeur and
 also reverent intimacy, and the effect it has on hushing an audience 
can still be felt today.<br>
But then he moves away from that territory on "Spirit in the Night," a 
song that still has its cryptically spooky Dylanesque lyrics but also 
builds into a more traditional soul shout-out, thanks to Clarence 
Clemons's saxophone solo. The band then goes into soul-oldies heaven 
with a cover of "I Sold My Heart to the Junkman," which had been a 1962 
girl-group hit. On these three songs and five others, it's evident that 
Springsteen and his tightly rehearsed ensemble were trying 
simultaneously to draw from the music's past and to create a future. 
This is the night they came to be forever recognized for it.<br>
It took luck for Springsteen's audio engineer, Toby Scott, to find the 
tape. He lives in northwest Montana and met a Boston emigre, 
musician/retired music teacher Michael Atherton, at an open-mike night 
at a bar in the town of Whitefish. Atherton, a resident of Trego, said 
he had a tape for him - Springsteen at Harvard Square Theatre, 1974. He 
had made it himself, lugging in a professional-model cassette recorder 
with external microphone and taping the show from a seat in the back. At
 the time, Atherton was a natural-foods baker (with his wife) as well as
 a musician. "I saw every concert we could afford to - of course, we 
were broke most of the time," Atherton recalls. "I don't even know how I
 knew who Bruce Springsteen was. When we baked, we listened to WBCN all 
the time and even took doughnuts over to them because we thought they 
were so cool. So maybe that was it."<br>
Smuggling the bulky recorder into the show turned out to be easy, 
because he was prepared. "My father was a news photographer for 40 years
 and instilled in me a rule to always look like you know what you're 
doing when confronted with any possible security situation," he says. 
"So I put it under my peacoat, where it probably looked like I was 
pregnant. Then I put it in my lap and held the microphone up in the 
air." He also recorded a bit of Raitt's headlining act, before the 
batteries gave out.<br>
Over the years - as Atherton and his wife moved to first New Hampshire 
and then Montana, he has made a few copies for friends - which may have 
something to do with the bootleg copies that some Internet sites say 
exist. But he has only played it once for himself. "It was every bit as 
good as I remembered it," he says. "It was the greatest band concert 
I've ever seen - completely together, completely refined, the dramatic 
intent clear from beginning to end."<br>
Actually, Landau - who went on to become Springsteen's manager - didn't 
see the performance that can now be heard at the hall of fame. He went 
to the second show that night, when the set list not only was somewhat 
changed - Springsteen opened with "The E Street Shuffle" - but showcased
 a new song, "Born to Run." Landau had seen Springsteen at a Cambridge 
club called Charlie's Place just a month earlier.<br>
Landau declined comment for this story, but the music writer Dave Marsh -
 Landau's editor at the time - recalls The Real Paper review well. "It 
was playing off `A Christmas Carol' - it was Dickensian in the way he 
talks about rock 'n' roll's past, present, and future. It always gets 
quoted as being in a prophetic voice, but it wasn't."<br>
Marsh went on to write two Springsteen biographies and "Bruce 
Springsteen on Tour: 1968-2005." While he and Landau had seen 
Springsteen earlier in a small Cambridge club, Marsh didn't make the 
Harvard Square show. "This is a horrible thing to say," he says. "I had a
 ticket but was sick."<br>

<strong class="text-strong">SPRINGSTEEN TICKETS SELL OUT IN 2 HOURS<br>

<br>
The week-long wait for Bruce Springsteen tickets ended in a rush yesterday.<br>
Tickets for his three upcoming Worcester Centrum shows went on sale 
yesterday afternoon and about 34,000 tickets -- $680,000 worth -- were 
sold in slightly more than two hours.<br>
Lines formed quickly for the 2 p.m. sale at local Ticketmaster outlets 
such as the Orpheum Theater and Tower Records. Radio stations WBCN and 
KISS-108 had spread the word after being notified at noontime by agents 
of Tea Party Concerts. They're the promoters for Springsteen's Feb. 25, 
28 and 29 Centrum shows, which will open his first national tour in two 
years.<br>
The Centrum dates were first announced a week ago, but the delay in 
releasing tickets stemmed from Springsteen's management not wanting 
scalpers to have extra time to inflate their prices, a spokesman 
confirmed yesterday from New York.<br>
"You can never get rid of scalpers, but at least this gives them less 
time to get an ad in the newspaper and sell something that way," the 
spokesman said.<br>
"And by putting the tickets on sale on a Saturday, we also gave more 
people a chance to get them," the spokesman added. "We always have tried
 to go on sale on weekends. Otherwise, so much of the audience works or 
is in school."<br>
Yesterday, it didn't matter whether Springsteen-lovers were working or 
not. "Yeah, I admit it. I skipped out of work. My son called me and I 
just had to get down here," said Paul Williams of Brockton, while 
waiting in an Orpheum Theater line that at its longest stretched two 
blocks.<br>
"We had free tickets to the ballet, but those didn't matter when we 
heard about this," said Susan Loucks. "Priorities are priorities," her 
friend, Claudia Dunne, laughed as they stood in line. It took two hours 
of waiting, but they got their tickets. "I am the ballet now," said 
Loucks, doing a festive pirouette as she left the box office.<br>
A fierce wind was blowing in 27-degree temperatures, but no one 
complained. "We were supposed to go skiing in Waterville Valley today, 
but my friend called and said we're doing something else. Here we are," 
said Ernie Galipeau of Waltham. "This is really not too bad. It's worth 
the wait," added Mark MacNeil.<br>
Orpheum box office manager Paul MacDonald said the crowd was orderly. 
The same at the Centrum, according to spokesman Ed Lavoie, who said the 
Centrum only serviced tickets to the 2,000 youths given priority wrist 
bands a week ago to keep them from camping out overnight.<br>
As it was, about 50 youths braved Friday's snowstorm and spent that 
evening in sleeping bags around the Centrum, Lavoie said. Yet they 
didn't have wrist bands and were told they had to buy their tickets at 
other Worcester Ticketmaster outlets such as the Good Vibrations record 
store and Angel Video.<br>
All Springsteen tickets cost $20 each, with an additional $2.25 service 
charge. "I'm just glad it's over," the Centrum's Lavoie said. "It's been
 a rough week. Maybe now I can sleep."<br>

<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the Grateful Dead played in different countries 
this holiday weekend, but both seized the attention of New Englanders. 
Springsteen staged a concert radio broadcast yesterday from Stockholm, 
Sweden, while the Dead drew 80,000 fans over two shows at the Oxford 
Plains Speedway in Maine.<br>
Springsteen's concert was aired over WBCN -- and was spiced by news that
 he'll join the Amnesty International tour this fall. The global tour 
will now star Springsteen, Peter Gabriel, Sting, Youssou N'dour, Tracy 
Chapman and "one regional act per continent," Jack Healey, director of 
Amnesty International, said during the broadcast.<br>
The tour will open at London's Wembley Stadium on Sept. 2, then move to 
Philadelphia's JFK Stadium on Sept. 17. Healey did not give further 
venues, just other destinations, among them Montreal, Toronto, Los 
Angeles, Paris, Torino (Italy), Costa Rica, Sao Paulo (Brazil) and 
Buenos Aires and Mendoza in Argentina. "We're also hoping to go to Asia 
and Africa," he said. (Ticket information will be announced in two 
weeks.)<br>
"Support human rights for everyone and let freedom ring," Springsteen 
said when pledging his Amnesty involvement at the end of his first set, 
which turned out to be his only set on the radio. WBCN was then flooded 
with "2,000 phone calls," spokesman Steve Strick said, from listeners 
angry at the sets' omission. "It wasn't our fault," Strick said. "We got
 the show from DIR Broadcasting (via syndication), and we were given no 
other information."<br>
The first set, at any rate, was a beauty. It was roughly the same as 
when Springsteen opened his tour at the Worcester Centrum in February, 
except for the additions of the blues standard, "Boom Boom Boom," and 
Bob Dylan's 1964 protest song, "Chimes of Freedom."<br>
Springsteen kept his verbal introductions to a minimum this time, but he
 did dedicate the song "Spare Parts, Broken Hearts" to a woman he hopes 
"will put away her past and find something new and beautiful in her life
 now." It was believed to be a reference to his estranged wife, Julianne
 Phillips.<br>

ROCK NOTES<br>
It's official. Bruce Springsteen will open his national tour at the 
Worcester Centrum on Feb. 25, with added dates Feb. 28 and 29. It is 
expected to be a "full-blown, big-sound rock 'n' roll tour," a CBS 
spokeswoman said yesterday.<br>
Ticket information was not available last night, however. A meeting on 
the issue was held in Los Angeles late yesterday, but was not concluded 
at press time. More details are expected today, according to Centrum 
general manager Neil Sulkes.<br>
Springsteen has said he might start his next tour in New England, but 
the surprise is that it will be at the Centrum -- not Boston Garden -- 
as has been rumored in recent weeks.<br>
"It was a very competitive situation," Sulkes said. "We're not sure what
 tipped it our way. We used whatever corporate avenues we had. We think 
it's the result of some good negotiations and because Spectacor (the 
Centrum's management company, which also runs the Philadelphia Spectrum)
 carries a lot of weight in the industry."<br>
For what is being dubbed "The Tunnel of Love Express Tour," Springsteen 
will bring his complete E Street Band and an additional five horn 
players, some of whom play with the New Jersey band, La Bamba &amp; the 
Hubcaps.<br>
"We believe it will be entirely different from Bruce's 'Born in the 
U.S.A.' tour," the CBS spokeswoman said. "There will be noteworthy 
exclusions of material as well as surprising additions. He may also play
 some new songs he's just written."<br>
Although there's a two-day gap in the Centrum dates, don't expect more 
Centrum shows to be added. The intervening nights, Feb. 26 and 27, are 
booked with a truck pull competition. "It's just as well," said Sulkes. 
"From what we've heard, Bruce likes to start his tour, then have a night
 or two off to think about making changes."<br>
Aside from the Centrum, the other tour dates so far are: March 3-4, Dean
 Smith Auditorium in Chapel Hill, NC; 8-9, Spectrum in Philadelphia; 
13-14, Richfield Coliseum in Cleveland; 16-17, Rosemont Horizon in 
Chicago; 22-23, Omni in Atlanta; 26, Rupp Arena in Lexington, Ky.; 
28-29, Joe Louis Arena in Detroit; April 1-2, Nassau Coliseum in 
Uniondale, NY; and 4-5, Capitol Center in Landover, Md. An additional 
month of dates is expected after that, mostly in the Western US<br>

MUSIC REVIEW<br>
Longtime Bruce Springsteen fans must have been in shock. It's one thing 
to hear Springsteen without the E Street Band, but quite another to see 
him without them, which happened on "Saturday Night Live" this weekend. 
It was Springsteen's first live TV appearance, but it achieved mixed 
results.<br>
The main reason Springsteen booked the show, contrary to reports about 
his declining record sales needing a boost, was to prove to fans that he
 could cut it without his veteran E Street Band, which he's broken up. 
The key question is: Did this three-song cameo with his new band (which 
we're now told will be the core of his road group) help sell tickets for
 his yet-to-be-announced tour?<br>
Yes . . . and no. Springsteen has gone to a guitar-heavy lineup that 
sounded like a rough 'n' ragged garage band on "SNL," but lacked the 
versatility and group dynamic of the E Street Band. The new group -- 
much younger than Springsteen -- consists of guitarist Shane Fontayne 
(formerly of Lone Justice); drummer Zachary Alford (who has toured with 
the B-52's); bassist Tommy Simms (little is known except he's from 
Tennessee); and keyboardist Roy Bittan, an E Street holdover, though he 
played a minimal role Saturday.<br>
Springsteen's choice of so many relative unknowns suggests a a complete 
starting over. "I felt like I'd gone a long time playing with the same 
people. . . . There's a responsibility to step out a bit," he told MTV's
 Kurt Loder. And that seemed to be his theme Saturday. The new unit 
careened through "Luckytown," with Springsteen shouting an over-the-top 
vocal much harsher than the recorded version. They added a bizarre, 
avant-garde treatment of "57 Channels" (a wry tune about cable TV), 
followed by their best performance on "Living Proof," a jolting rocker 
about Springsteen's joy at his son's birth.<br>
Of the three, only "Living Proof" was convincing. Otherwise, this was 
very much a work-in-progress. Give Springsteen credit for taking risks, 
but don't be surprised if fans miss the E Street Band.<br>

<strong class="text-strong">SPRINGSTEEN Why he still matters in the age of Limp Bizkit<br>
<br>
Boston Globe <br>
<br>
Author:	Smith, Damon<br>
Date:	Aug 15, 1999</strong><br>
<br>
Damon Smith, 31, is a writer and editor who plays bass for the Tom Leach
 band. I never liked Bruce Springsteen very much. In fact, it's safe to 
say I hated him. And I had plenty of reasons.<br>
Back in 1984, when I was in high school, I wasn't familiar with 
Springsteen's music as much as I was with the phenomenon of his enormous
 popularity and the hype surrounding the release of "Born in the 
U.S.A.," an album that I associated with fist-pumping jocks and bad MTV 
videos. The level of attention paid to his album, his life and career, 
the day-to-day details of his every move -- the sheer fact of his 
omnipresence -- could not have been surpassed if he'd been the Second 
Coming. Everyone seemed to adore this scruffy guy with the buff frame in
 cuffed shirts and blue jeans who suddenly loomed larger than life. 
Indeed, Springsteen mania took hold that year in a way that utterly 
mystified me, especially since my young rebellious mind grew an instant 
distaste for anything that courted mass appeal or sought to engender 
national pride.<br>
I had heard "Born to Run" and "Tenth Avenue Freezeout" blaring from car 
stereos when I was just a tyke, but it wasn't until my friend Jim bought
 "Born in the U.S.A." and made me listen to it hundreds of times as he 
drove us to school that a clearer picture of Springsteen emerged. One 
day, sick to death of listening to the Boss, I pulled the lyric sheet 
out of Jim's cassette case so I could criticize the patriotic sentiment 
of the song "Born in the U.S.A." But instead of finding a rosy portrait 
of small-town life or a paean to American might, as I expected, I read 
about a man "born down in a dead man's town" who compared himself to a 
cowering dog "that's been beat too much." If I was surprised at the 
opening lines, the next verse was like a hard slap in the face: "Got in a
 little hometown jam / So they put a rifle in my hand / Sent me off to a
 foreign land / To go and kill the yellow man."<br>
This was no glorified American success story. Springsteen had assumed 
the voice of a loser and an underdog, a guy down on his luck from the 
very start; the line "born in the U.S.A." was a powerful lament, or at 
least loaded with ambiguous meaning. I identified with that. Neither Jim
 nor any of my peers seemed to understand the irony of interpreting the 
chorus as a triumphant cheer rather than a bitter statement of fact. 
Neither did Ronald Reagan's campaign manager, apparently, who wanted to 
use the song for political-cheerleading purposes (Springsteen refused). I
 realized something important about Springsteen then, something I never 
forgot. Bruce Springsteen was more complex than many of his fans wanted 
him to be, or perhaps allowed him to be -- at least the ones who 
embraced him as a fellow conservative, or a proud American belting out 
his self-penned anthem with rugged delight.<br>
He earned my respect, but that still didn't steer me past the bombastic 
Phil Spector-ish sound of his records, largely because my taste, like 
that of so many of my teenage friends during the Reagan years, steered 
toward hard-core punk rock -- the fast, furious, and anti-authoritarian.
 The bands I liked dealt primarily with themes of suburban alienation 
and the emptiness of everyday life with all the musical subtlety of a 
chainsaw. Springsteen took up those themes too, but as a storyteller, 
not an acid commentator, and the straightforward, blues-based rock 'n' 
roll he made with the E Street Band was not for me. Now that I'm a bit 
older and spend a lot more time thinking about music, about the 
mechanics of songs and the nature of good songwriting, I have a much 
deeper appreciation of Springsteen's musicianship and a better sense of 
his importance as a cultural figure.<br>
I still listen to my beat-up punk records with a nostalgic thrill, 
probably the same way Springsteen fans of an earlier generation still 
get into hearing "Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J." or "Born to Run" and
 romanticize their adolescence or young adulthood. Not long ago, when I 
turned 30, I started thinking about and exploring my own roots, which 
are in the Southwest, and that led me to refamiliarize myself with the 
country music of previous decades, and to develop a deep love for a 
tradition that shaped me more than I knew. Eventually I began playing 
music that drew from those sources, as well as early rock 'n' roll. Part
 of that education brought me around to Springsteen again.<br>
I never owned a Bruce Springsteen record until last year, when a friend 
of mine urged me to find a copy of "Nebraska" and spend an evening 
listening to its spare melodies of desperation, lives gone wrong, and 
late-night drives on the New Jersey Turnpike. I've since worn the 
grooves out on that record. I part ways with those who think Springsteen
 sounds best with a band. To my admittedly lo-fi-loving ears, "Nebraska"
 is the finest album he's ever made.<br>
With an acoustic guitar, a harmonica, and a four-track tape recorder, 
Springsteen managed to distill a potent record that captured everything 
great about his past work with the E Street Band, like "Streets of 
Fire," "Born to Run," and "Backstreets." But stripped down to these 
rudimentary essentials, the sound of the record is darker, more primal 
than anything else he recorded. It resonates with me because the songs 
are stark, edgy, mournful tales told in simple language, like those of 
Hank Williams. The out-of- focus black-and-white photo of him standing 
in a doorway on the inside cover is haunting, the antithesis of a rock 
star, and worlds apart from the smiling do-gooder I remembered from the 
"Dancing in the Dark" video.<br>
What appeals to me most about Springsteen, particularly with "Nebraska,"
 is that his themes go to the heart of life itself as it's lived by 
ordinary people -- not "now" or "back then," necessarily, but here in 
America -- the way a lot of old country or blues artists did. He endures
 and reaches younger listeners, I think, partly because of the 
reputation of his concert performances and the quasi- legendary status 
an older generation has bequeathed him, and partly because his most 
canonized songs -- before "Born in the U.S.A." -- still sound damn good 
on a car radio. I would guess, too, that a lot of younger fans go to his
 arena shows the way they would a football game, because it's an event, 
and never listen to his records at all. But I also imagine that many of 
them, like me, cruised the streets in a nowhere place looking for 
something to do, and could hear an album like "Nebraska" and marvel at 
Springsteen's songwriting as much as his showmanship. Of course, bands 
like Limp Bizkit and Marilyn Manson capture the contemporary mood by 
giving the anomie of youth a mainstream sound, but their songs don't 
carry the same literary weight.<br>
Springsteen is the only mainstream artist I can think of who writes 
convincingly about the working class, and about the average guy's 
experience of life in the suburbs, or anyplace else, for that matter. He
 sympathizes with the hardhats, the union grunts who perform thankless 
jobs in the oil refineries or on the factory line and who experience the
 spiritual crush of the working life. Coming of age in Texas, I worked 
on cars in a transmission shop, slung hash in a restaurant, toiled in an
 auto-parts warehouse, and unloaded freight trucks on the evening shift 
to pay for my escape from that drudgery. I bought an education, instead 
of a car, with the money I saved -- but a lot of my friends didn't have 
that opportunity. Some of them, frustrated, anxious, and bored, got into
 trouble with the law, and these are situations Springsteen seems to 
understand as well.<br>
He writes of average guys with shattered hopes who've pursued the 
runaway American dream and come up empty-handed, who are burning with 
the desire for something better, a life outside the back streets and the
 badlands, the chance to reach a promised land that exists apart from 
the darkness at the edge of town. This is the central nervous system of 
his musical sensibility. And even though he is partial to portraying 
such lives, to offering vignettes of hard lives and moribund existence, 
he infuses these suburban tales with a subtle sense of hope or dignity, 
something that keeps the danger of pure nihilism at bay.<br>
If you're going to the FleetCenter to see Springsteen and the E Street 
Band play together live for the first time in a decade, you can be sure 
you'll be treated to a marathon two- to three-hour concert, and a 
rousing performance by a great American artist. As for me, you might 
find me at home, letting the needle on my turntable burn through a few 
more grooves of "Nebraska," like a car creepin' through the nighttime on
 a long, deserted highway leading out of town.</div>

<strong class="text-strong">Springsteen tape takes us back to ‘rock &amp; roll future’<br>
<br>
By Steven Rosen<br>
 May 9, 2010</strong><br>
<br>
The evening of May 9, 1974, is legendary in the annals of rock ’n’ roll.
 It was the night the little-known Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street 
Band opened for Bonnie Raitt at Harvard Square Theater, dazzling the 
critic Jon Landau into writing “I saw rock &amp; roll future and its 
name is Bruce Springsteen’’ in the local alternative weekly The Real 
Paper. Now a tape from that night — one of the most revered in rock 
history — has emerged as a museum object 36 years after the storied 
event.<br>
<br>
The tape, never available for public hearing, is included in the 
Springsteen exhibit “From Asbury Park to the Promised Land’’ at 
Cleveland’s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, on display through 
summer. It has been digitalized and streams to a single listening 
station, where two people at a time can listen to it on headphones. It 
is not available on the museum’s website, nor can a copy be purchased in
 the museum store.<br>
<br>
The sound has some rough patches, and there are no seats for relaxing. 
But the radical effect of the music on the audience then (this writer 
was there and can attest to that) can still be felt. The band aims for 
the mystically transcendent one minute and party-hearty, sax-fueled 
retro-rock raucousness the next, keeping everyone off guard. Springsteen
 was in Cambridge to promote his second album, “The Wild, the Innocent 
and the E Street Shuffle.’’<br>
<br>
The idea for an exhibit centering on Springsteen’s career came about 
because the Hall of Fame’s induction ceremonies were going to be in 
Cleveland last year and chief curator Jim Henke wanted a big show to 
accompany it. He approached Springsteen, who had been inducted in 1999. 
Springsteen agreed and provided items ranging from his “Born to Run’’ 
Fender Esquire guitar to his favorite songwriting table.<br>
<br>
The exhibit drew so well in 2009 — 423,000 visitors — that it has been 
extended into this summer, with newer artifacts added, including the 
jacket he wore to President Obama’s inauguration, his 2009 Kennedy 
Center award, and the Golden Globe he won for “The Wrestler.’’ But it is
 the Harvard Square tape that remains one of the most fascinating parts 
of the exhibit, just as that night itself remains an enduring, pivotal 
moment in the Boss’s career.<br>
<br>
“It was my idea to include it, because that show is so famous because of
 Landau’s review,’’ Henke says. “So we contacted [Springsteen’s 
organization], and they had a tape of the songs played there. He and the
 E Street Band were a great live band, and that does come through in 
those tracks.’’<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s band at the time of the Harvard Square booking featured a 
pianist with strong jazz and classical leanings, David Sancious. (He 
left in August 1974.) It is Sancious who makes the band’s first 
impression so strong, opening with a long, melancholy, and ruminative 
solo on “New York City Serenade.’’ It slowly leads into Springsteen’s 
yearningly searching vocal, with the impressionistic, romanticized 
lyrics that seem part Bob Dylan’s “Desolation Row’’ and part Lou Reed’s 
“Walk on the Wild Side.’’ The song was aiming for theatrical grandeur 
and also reverent intimacy, and the effect it has on hushing an audience
 can still be felt today.<br>
<br>
But then he moves away from that territory on “Spirit in the Night,’’ a 
song that still has its cryptically spooky Dylanesque lyrics but also 
builds into a more traditional soul shout-out, thanks to Clarence 
Clemons’s saxophone solo. The band then goes into soul-oldies heaven 
with a cover of “I Sold My Heart to the Junkman,’’ which had been a 1962
 girl-group hit. On these three songs and five others, it’s evident that
 Springsteen and his tightly rehearsed ensemble were trying 
simultaneously to draw from the music’s past and to create a future. 
This is the night they came to be forever recognized for it.<br>
<br>
It took luck for Springsteen’s audio engineer, Toby Scott, to find the 
tape. He lives in northwest Montana and met a Boston emigre, 
musician/retired music teacher Michael Atherton, at an open-mike night 
at a bar in the town of Whitefish. Atherton, a resident of Trego, said 
he had a tape for him — Springsteen at Harvard Square Theatre, 1974. He 
had made it himself, lugging in a professional-model cassette recorder 
with external microphone and taping the show from a seat in the back. At
 the time, Atherton was a natural-foods baker (with his wife) as well as
 a musician. “I saw every concert we could afford to — of course, we 
were broke most of the time,’’ Atherton recalls. “I don’t even know how I
 knew who Bruce Springsteen was. When we baked, we listened to WBCN all 
the time and even took doughnuts over to them because we thought they 
were so cool. So maybe that was it.’’<br>
<br>
Smuggling the bulky recorder into the show turned out to be easy, 
because he was prepared. “My father was a news photographer for 40 years
 and instilled in me a rule to always look like you know what you’re 
doing when confronted with any possible security situation,’’ he says. 
“So I put it under my peacoat, where it probably looked like I was 
pregnant. Then I put it in my lap and held the microphone up in the 
air.’’ He also recorded a bit of Raitt’s headlining act, before the 
batteries gave out.<br>
<br>
Over the years — as Atherton and his wife moved to first New Hampshire 
and then Montana, he has made a few copies for friends — which may have 
something to do with the bootleg copies that some Internet sites say 
exist. But he has only played it once for himself. “It was every bit as 
good as I remembered it,’’ he says. “It was the greatest band concert 
I’ve ever seen — completely together, completely refined, the dramatic 
intent clear from beginning to end.’’<br>
<br>
Actually, Landau — who went on to become Springsteen’s manager — didn’t 
see the performance that can now be heard at the hall of fame. He went 
to the second show that night, when the set list not only was somewhat 
changed — Springsteen opened with “The E Street Shuffle’’ — but 
showcased a new song, “Born to Run.’’ Landau had seen Springsteen at a 
Cambridge club called Charlie’s Place just a month earlier.<br>
<br>
Landau declined comment for this story, but the music writer Dave Marsh —
 Landau’s editor at the time — recalls The Real Paper review well. “It 
was playing off ‘A Christmas Carol’ — it was Dickensian in the way he 
talks about rock ’n’ roll’s past, present, and future. It always gets 
quoted as being in a prophetic voice, but it wasn’t.’’<br>
<br>
Marsh went on to write two Springsteen biographies and “Bruce 
Springsteen on Tour: 1968-2005.’’ While he and Landau had seen 
Springsteen earlier in a small Cambridge club, Marsh didn’t make the 
Harvard Square show. “This is a horrible thing to say,’’ he says. “I had
 a ticket but was sick.’’<br>

Boxed sets flood the market every fall, with new ones coming out 
seemingly every week. But none tells more about the inner workings of an
 artist than "Bruce Springsteen: Tracks," already being called the Holy 
Grail of boxed sets. It's easy to see why, because it boasts a 
staggering 56 previously unreleased songs that track Springsteen from a 
cocky Bob Dylan acolyte to a mature, self-realized artist with an acute 
ear for promises broken and fulfilled.<br>
What's apparent is that Springsteen left more good songs off his studio 
albums than most composers write in their entire recording careers. No 
wonder he's agonized so much over his albums. He's had to make hard 
choices in deleting some absolute gems, which are finally collected in 
this project. Sure, there are some songs that should have been left in 
the vaults -- but most will be an ear-opening experience for anyone with
 the faintest love of the prolific poet- rocker from the New Jersey 
shore.<br>
The box, released today with a suggested price of $69.98, charts 
Springsteen's vast improvement as a singer and composer. The third and 
fourth CDs (containing music from his "Born in the U.S.A." period up to 
today) especially show a remarkable consistency. The first two CDs are 
spotty, featuring a lot of bar-band filler that simply points the 
compass to where he was going. The last two more than make up for any 
lost time.<br>
Springsteen has been accused of not rocking enough in the '90s, of being
 too reflective, but that image is smashed by such previously unreleased
 '90s tunes as "Leaving Train" (which sounds like Steppenwolf meets 
Pearl Jam) and the blazing "Seven Angels," with slashing electric guitar
 courtesy of Springsteen himself.<br>
The reflective side is covered as well, on '90s standouts such as "Lover
 Man" (about a romantic reconciliation told through a woman's eyes), 
"Loose Change" (about the aftermath of a one-night stand with a woman in
 a "friendly bar"), and the poignant "Brothers Under a Bridge," about a 
group of scarred Vietnam veterans who live as exiles in the California 
mountains.<br>
This last song was a feature of Springsteen's "Tom Joad" tour of two 
years ago. It shows how Springsteen has tinkered with and updated his 
own work through his 25-year career. There's another previously 
unreleased song with the tellingly similar title of "Brothers Under the 
Bridges," from 1983. It also centers on a group of castoffs drinking 
beer and wine under bridges -- but the Vietnam angle, and the deeper 
focus, were added later.<br>
Time and again, this box shows Springsteen borrowing from himself to 
craft something better later on. An early tune, "Seaside Bar Song" from 
1971, has the line "The highway is alive tonight," which later turned up
 on the epic "Born to Run." The early piano ballad "Iceman" has a verse 
that later was folded into "Badlands": "I wanna go out tonight / I wanna
 find out what I got."<br>
Springsteen has been finding that out ever since his solo audition for 
Columbia's legendary talent spotter, John Hammond, in 1971. That 
audition was taped and appears here for the first time. A nervous but 
not-to-be-denied Springsteen barrels through his colorful story songs 
"Mary Queen of Scots" ("I'm just a lonely acrobat, the live wire is my 
trade"), "It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City" (where he manages to 
rhyme, however awkwardly, the words cobra, Casanova, and supernova), and
 the fast-paced "Growin' Up," with the marauding line "The flag of 
piracy flew from my mast." It was youthful, brash, at times brilliant, 
and enough to get him signed.<br>
This first CD in the box, though, has a high cringe factor as well. 
Springsteen's folk-rock bravado, and his rock-and-classic-R&amp;B 
elements, are in place, but his voice warbles on a number of tracks and 
there are some embarrassing lines like the unctuous "Ooh, ooh, ooh, I 
want to rendezvous!" and "You got to tell the girl you need her -- you 
got to give her a great big kiss!" Still, the innocence is endearing.<br>
The second CD is much better. It consists of the unreleased album 
Springsteen made around the time of "The River," in 1980. His songcraft 
is deepening, as in the bittersweet "A Good Man Is Hard to Find," about a
 forlorn Pittsburgh woman; and "Stolen Car," about a dreamer whose love 
is squashed, whereupon he takes to -- where else? -- the highway. It's 
the pop-music equivalent of John Updike's "Rabbit, Run."<br>
Then comes some priceless material left off the 12 million-selling "Born
 in the U.S.A." album (1984). There's an acoustic title song that is a 
long way from the anthemic version finally released. And there are 
hard-rocking, treasure-trove songs showcasing the E Street Band, such as
 "Johnny Bye-Bye" (about Elvis Presley being found "slumped up against 
the drain with a whole lot of trouble running through his veins"), 
"Cynthia" (a flat-out song of female admiration), "Frankie" (about 
spending a night at the drive-in with his lover), and "TV Movie," in 
which he laughs about someone wanting "to make a TV movie out of me" (it
 has a cynicism about the media that would show up later on "57 
Channels").<br>
Springsteen's ability to limn small-town dreams is vividly portrayed in 
1983's "Car Wash," about about a woman who works at one and dreams of a 
million-dollar recording contract. And his own dreams are nurtured in 
1987's "The Wish," a deeply personal song about Springsteen's mother 
buying him his first guitar ("a Japanese guitar") as a Christmas 
present.<br>
Springsteen's E Street Band has been a memory for a decade now (though 
there's talk of a reunion tour next summer), but what most surprises on 
the boxed set is the quality of Springsteen's nearly one-man-band, 
previously unissued studio songs in the '90s. He adds E Street 
synth-keyboardist Roy Bittan and late drummer Jeff Porcaro to some 
tracks, but he's solo on others, such as the brilliant "Going Cali," 
about a man who heads to the West Coast only to meet a woman in a 
California desert bar and have a son with her. It's typical of how much 
Springsteen respects the ever-changing, ever-unpredictable side of human
 nature. It remains an essential cornerstone of his art, as this 
must-have boxed set affirms.<br>

MUSIC REVIEW BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN AT:DCU CENTER, LAST NIGHT<br>
WORCESTER "Due to the intimate nature of the show," the announcer said 
before Bruce Springsteen took the stage last night, there would be no 
photographs allowed.<br>
But the restrictions didn't end there. A card handed to each member of 
the audience as they entered the DCU Center detailed the evening's house
 rules no searching for seats during songs, closed lobby curtains 
throughout the performance, closed concession stands during the duration
 of the performance, and everyone had to be "seated by the start of the 
first song."<br>
Whew! No wonder they call him the Boss.<br>
Still, few were likely complaining once Springsteen began performing on 
this stop along his solo and mostly acoustic "Devils &amp; Dust" tour. 
This was a quieter Springsteen without the E Street Band bombast, but he
 was no less captivating or intense. He opened with "Idiot's Delight," 
singing the song he wrote with Joe Grushecky into a bullet microphone, 
which distorted his vocals for a sound reminiscent of a scratchy old 45.<br>
Springsteen, 56, has been long recognized as one of the greatest 
singer-songwriters in rock music history, but the sheer poetry of his 
lyrics is sometimes lost when he's in full-on veins a-poppin' arena 
mode. There were no such distractions last night, as his only 
accompaniment was various guitars, harmonicas, and keyboards.<br>
It also helped that the DCU Center was sectioned off with black drapes 
to give the cavernous space a much cozier feel. It had the same effect 
on his songs. The underlying bitterness of "Brilliant Disguise" became 
more solemn and circumspect. He played banjo on "I'm on Fire," and the 
song's restlessness now hinted at the kind of rangy lust that cajoles a 
man to violence.<br>
For more than two hours, Springsteen sketched out his lengthy career, in
 a mix of hits and obscurities. He even went back to his 1973 debut, 
"Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.," for a chilling version of "Lost in 
the Flood."<br>
And despite his penchant big-shouldered anthems, Springsteen showed how 
stripping songs like "Long Time Comin,' " "Darkness on the Edge of 
Town," and "The Rising" to their core can reveal even more flesh and 
muscle. Unadorned and plaintive, it's also the ideal backdrop for the 
incorrigible romantics, lost men, and stubborn dreamers who have 
populated his music for more than 30 years.<br>
Between songs he was in a jovial mood, introducing "The Fever" as one of
 those "annoying fan favorites," then unexpectedly delivered it as a 
smoky blues. He even playfully admonished the more rhythmically 
challenged in the audience whose off-beat clapping during his songs was 
driving him "[expletive] crazy."<br>
"Check what's going on around you, and fall in line," he said with a 
smile. "I appreciate your spirit, but cut that [expletive] out."<br>

<strong class="text-strong">TALKING WITH BRUCE<br>
<br>
Boston Globe <br>

<br>
INTERVIEW<br>
WORCESTER - A very relaxed Bruce Springsteen sat in his dressing room, propped his black-booted feet on a<br>
table, threw back his arms and began explaining why his latest tour is 
such a radical departure from the anthem-laden, greatest-hits approach 
of 1985's "Born in the U.S.A." venture.<br>
"I just felt if I'm going to go out and play today, I'd have to drop all
 the cornerstones of my shows," Springsteen said well after midnight 
following his Sunday concert.<br>
"That's the first thing. I felt like I had to. It's not that I'll never 
play those songs again. I'm sure I will. But when I went to put this 
show together, I said, 'Well, what were the songs that were the 
cornerstones of what I had done?' And most of those were the ones I 
automatically put to the side."<br>
The current<br>
tour, which finished its three-day opening run at the Worcester Centrum 
last night, features seven songs from his new "Tunnel of Love" album and
 a host of lesser-known tracks, including four B-sides from singles. 
Dropped from the set are such Springsteen standards as "Badlands" and 
"Thunder Road" -- two songs that defined his street-savvy image of a 
decade ago.<br>
"It was important to just give that stuff a rest," he said during a 
joint interview with this writer and Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles 
Times. "To come out and kick through it again didn't make any sense. To 
dig back is what we did on the 'Born in the U.S.A.' tour. So I wanted 
something very different."<br>
Springsteen, whose wife Julianne sat on a couch next to him during the 
conversation, also made it plain he doesn't want to be embalmed by his 
past.<br>
"You move on; you change. You're not the same person you were," said the
 38-year-old singer. "You can't come out and play oldies, because then 
you're a damned oldies act. You just can't come out and try to push 
people's buttons with old songs. It's a waste of time -- a waste of my 
time and a waste of their time. I wasn't interested in coming out and 
being nostalgic, which you can do even after just one successful tour."<br>
Looking back, Springsteen realized he had outgrown himself.<br>
"Basically, the way we've toured every time since we started is that the
 show grew and grew and grew -- and every tour we added new songs to the
 old songs. And that felt completely natural. But then on the last tour,
 it did not feel natural. It felt a little embarrassing."<br>
Many of Springsteen's older songs were captured definitively on his 
concert album, "Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band -- Live: 
1975-1985," released two years ago. He recalled how he and his band 
listened to tapes of those songs, knowing that a new page was about to 
be turned.<br>
"We said, 'Well, that's that.' That's what happened to that kid between 
'75 and '85. That's what we did at that time and it seemed worthwhile. 
We all kind of sat there and sensed that was the end of something and 
the next time would be different."<br>
Reports circulated that Springsteen would not only change his approach 
for the new tour, but also leave his band home and perform solo. He 
confessed to having long talks with manager Jon Landau about bringing an
 acoustic tour to small halls with 3,000 seats, but finally nixed the 
idea. "I just didn't think an acoustic show would be physical enough," 
he said.<br>
But even though the E Street is back on tour, there are shifts within 
the group that have confused some fans. Most obvious is that saxophonist
 Clarence Clemons, who used to be virtually co-billed with Springsteen 
in earlier days, is playing much less sax because of the softer, 
guitar/keyboard slant of the "Tunnel of Love" material. Instead he often
 just plays low-key percussion on stage. On the other hand, backup 
singer Patty Scialfa is far more prominent than before, often 
harmonizing side by side with Springsteen.<br>
"I just think you got to go where the particular music is taking you at 
the time," Springsteen said. "But the continuity of the band is 
something that's really important to me. When you've got a band that's 
our size -- and when you're changing your sound -- people are always 
going to do more and less at different times on different tours. That's 
just where it's at and how it's gonna work out. The main job is that we 
are a band; and the idea of a band is to get up on stage and play in an 
integrated fashion as a unit. There's not a lot of solos. The song is 
the thing -- get that across and arrange the music so that happens."<br>
Another change concerns the increased theatrics of the tour. Springsteen
 and his band start by picking up mock-tickets at a carnival booth 
marked "Tunnel of Love Express Tour." And later, he and Clemons, in a 
touch of cabaret, sit on a park bench thinking of the girls they once 
watched in days of innocence on the New Jersey shore.<br>
"We've always done a little theater, though we didn't do it quite as 
obviously as sitting on a park bench or taking tickets at a booth. But 
me and Clarence were always doing bits, and these new ones just seemed a
 natural extension," he said.<br>
There's also a humorous parody of television evangelists, as he struts 
around and mimics Jimmy Swaggart and Pat Robertson. But no one should 
read too much into it, Springsteen said. "It's just something I had fun 
with. That's all."<br>
The chief purpose of the tour is to back the "Tunnel of Love" album, 
which he considers "absolutely one of my best records." It contains, he 
admitted, some songs left over from the acoustic music written for his 
"Nebraska" album in 1982.<br>
"This is more electrified, but it's still not a big rock thing. This 
feels like the kind of record I want to make now because I don't want to
 get caught up in that ('Born in the U.S.A.') merry-go-round," he said.<br>
As for the writing of "Tunnel of Love," which has to do with mature 
romantic conflicts, not the born-to-run mania of his youth, Springsteen 
said: "I didn't start out with something that was particularly 
autobiographical. Some songs are stories; some are more a part of my 
life. The main thing I try to do is find real people in songs. You have 
to make them live and make them be -- and then you have a song."<br>
Speaking of songwriting, Springsteen said it's a much easier process for
 him today. Recalling how he originally wrote 35 pages of lyrics for his
 1975 hit, "Born to Run," he said, "I don't worry so much about the way 
things get put together. It used to be a lot harder, but it no longer 
is. And I really don't know why that is. I'm probably not as restrictive
 about the things I want to write about. I'm just more open. I used to 
sweat, really, because I'd have a specific idea and I wouldn't be able 
to be satisfied. I used to sometimes take six months before I'd have it.
 It takes about a week now."<br>
Nor does he worry as much about whether his albums will sell in huge 
quantities. "The first thing you've got to stop worrying about is how 
much your record is going to sell. If it starts to sell less, then 
that's OK. It's still the record I wanted to make.<br>
"My main concern with 'Tunnel of Love' was this: I want to make the best
 record I can, and I want to help that record find its audience. I don't
 care if it sells this many or that many. There are people out there who
 would like to hear it and would get something of value out of it. And I
 want to make sure that happens."<br>

<strong class="text-strong">STEVEN VAN ZANDT IS EMERGING AS ARTIST ON HIS OWN RIGHT<br>
<br>
Boston Globe <br>
<br>
Author:	Morse, Steve<br>
Date:	May 17, 1987</strong><br>
<br>
Steven Van Zandt was an integral link in Bruce Springsteen's E Street 
Band for more than 10 years. He left in 1984 before Springsteen took on a
 Zeus-like aura in the industry. But Van Zandt never looked back. He 
went on to make three solo albums and write the "Sun City" single to 
fight apartheid. He is at last being viewed as an artist in his own 
right, not just an E Street alumnus.<br>
"When I left, Bruce did actually get bigger," Van Zandt said recently. 
"But at the time, don't forget, we were already very big. We were doing 
multiple arenas everywhere. We felt we had achieved success; and I was 
proud of it. At the point I left, it felt very natural. I just began to 
have other thoughts about needing to do something on my own -- and it's 
worked out quite well."<br>
Little Steven, as he is known, doesn't yet have impressive record sales,
 but that may change with his new album, "Freedom -- No Compromise," to 
be released tomorrow on the Manhattan label. Its lyrics will further his
 image as a firebrand protest singer -- through songs about American 
Indians, Latin American fruit pickers and South African freedom fighters
 -- but the music is a broadly compelling mix of anthemic choruses and 
sweepingly upbeat rock 'n' roll.<br>
"Sometimes I think people forget what I do for a living. I'm a rock 'n' 
roller and have a rock 'n' roll band. I'm not an investigative 
journalist," said Van Zandt, who was born in Boston but grew up on the 
New Jersey shore, where he was a highway construction worker before 
trying rock 'n' roll.<br>
The new album contains duets with Grammy winner Ruben Blades (the two 
met during last summer's Amnesty International tour) and with former 
boss Springsteen, whom Van Zandt first met when playing in New Jersey 
bar bands.<br>
"We don't get a chance to work with each other much anymore. But the 
time was right this time," Van Zandt said of Springsteen's collaboration
 on the reggae-tinged "Native American," which is about rebirth and 
dreams in a cynical society. Its most candid line: "You can't change 
me/Try and understand I am proud of who I am."<br>
"Bruce is still a friend, even though the rest of the world thinks of 
him as this great big success," Van Zandt said during a recent phone 
interview. "Believe me, I'm not trying to record with him because of the
 exposure it gives me. I don't expect the song we did together to be a 
hit."<br>
Nevertheless, it will be interesting to see how radio reacts to Van 
Zandt's new music. He has been a critic's favorite ever since his 
hard-hitting "Voice of America" album in 1984, but radio has been 
reluctant to embrace him.<br>
"The environment is changing -- certainly compared to 1984 when 'Voice 
of America' came out," he said. "That was really tough. Many people 
couldn't understand me. I'd go around criticizing the government and 
they'd say, 'Well, the economy is good.' But since 'Sun City' and 
Amnesty International and U2's success, I'm getting no negative 
reaction."<br>
As is common for politically-minded rock singers, Van Zandt has been a much bigger star in Europe than in his homeland.<br>
"Europeans have been with me since the beginning," he said. "In Sweden 
and Norway, 'Voice of America' was actually a hit -- a Top Ten record! 
Even in Germany and Italy, I do very well. And all through Holland, too.
 I've never had problems there. Politics is more of a day-to-day thing 
over there, which is what I'm writing about. I talk about justice and 
finding a common ground between cultures, which is what they do every 
day. We're more isolated over here. We don't have to speak a different 
language when we drive just an hour- and-a-half from our house."<br>
Van Zandt is looking ahead to touring in late summer. He hasn't toured 
in three years, due mainly to his being wrapped up in 'Sun City,' a 
consciousness-raising song and video project that urged entertainers to 
avoid playing the Sun City resort in South Africa.<br>
"We accomplished that. No one is playing there anymore," he said. "But 
as musicians and artists, you can only point people to some extent. You 
can't make them all divest from South Africa. We did our job, and 
somebody else has to pick up the ball."<br>

ALBUM REVIEW<br>
The First Church of Bruce convenes today at area record stores. Diehards
 have finally gotten their wish -- the release of an authorized, 
five-record concert package, "Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band:
 Live 1975-85."<br>
Random comments from church members over the weekend, as they awaited their vinyl equivalent to the Holy Grail:<br>
- A sportwriter: "This is going to do it. I've got a 20-year-old stereo,
 and this will finally be the incentive to go out and buy a new one."<br>
- A local entrepreneur: "They say this will be the Christmas album of 
the year, but just watch: Everyone will already own one by then. This is
 going to outsell Pet Rocks."<br>
- An advertising executive: "Five records of Bruce in concert? I think 
I'm going to have to take a vacation soon, so I can listen to it all."<br>
The hysteria has been carefully orchestrated. Springsteen's label, 
Columbia Records, has dropped hints for weeks about which songs will be 
included. And they issued a special eight-song build- up tape to radio 
stations on Friday. "It's probably going to arrive by armored car," WBCN
 disc jockey Ken Shelton joked on the air that morning.<br>
Columbia also has cited preorders of 1.5 million copies -- including 
cassettes and compact discs. That's less than the 1.9 million for the 
Jacksons' "Victory" album three years ago, but still the largest dollar-
 volume preorder in history, since each package contains five units. 
Andbecause the album and cassette versions will retail for an average of
 $25, and the CDs for $39, you're talking a $50-million gross right out 
of the gate. That, too, is unprecedented.<br>
So much for the marketing details. What about the music?<br>
Despite the juggernaut of hype, it's everything it's cracked up to be.<br>
It's drawn from every phase of Springsteen's Horatio Alger career, for 
at least two songs are taken from each of his seven albums. A loosely 
based chronology, it traces the cocky bravado of his New Jersey youth as
 a busdriver's son; on through a mythic rise which now finds him 
embraced as an American rocker without peer and as a thinking man's 
patriot who speaks eloquently for Vietnam veterans, the unemployed, the 
hungry and the disenfranchised.<br>
While the choice of songs will be endlessly debated, there is no doubt 
that Springsteen, who spent the last year preparing these tapes, has 
given us his personal legacy. These are the songs he wants remembered 20
 years from now. While the album is crammed with crowd-pleasing rock 
(and will be a party album "from now until forever," as a friend joked 
over the weekend), he also includes his finest songwriter ballads.<br>
In this regard are three straight tracks from 1982's daring acoustic 
album, "Nebraska." These follow an oddly slowed-down but poignant cover 
of Woody Guthrie's "This Land Is Your Land," which, Springsteen says 
during an introductory rap, was Guthrie's "angry answer" to Irving 
Berlin's "God Bless America." Then follows Springsteen's own anger in 
"Nebraska" (about an average citizen pushed to the breaking point by the
 "meanness in this world"); "Johnny 99" (about an unemployed auto worker
 who shoots a night clerk and gets 99 years in jail); and "Reason to 
Believe," where amid a mournful harmonica he rasps about a woman whose 
lover "up and left her," and of a man whose fiancee ditched him at the 
altar "and he's wonderin' where can his baby be." As Springsteen marvels
 in the last verse: "still at the end of every day, people find some 
reason to believe."<br>
This ability to touch the downtrodden, and even psychotic, side of life,
 then to release it through backbeat-blazing rock 'n' roll, is the key 
to Springsteen in concert. And it's here by the spadeful. The five 
records roll continuously from despairing empathy to communal joy. The 
songs, complete with audience screams, singalongs and cries of 
B-r-u-c-e!, B-r-u-c-e!, flow together as if this were one long concert, 
though recording was mainly done at the Roxy in Los Angeles in 1978, the
 Meadowlands in New Jersey in 1984 and the Los Angeles Coliseum in 1985.
 And the sound quality? It's magnificent.<br>

<br>
Boston Globe <br>

Date:	Feb 26, 1988</strong><br>
<br>
WORCESTER - 8:03 p.m. The lights dim, the Boss ruled.<br>
With 13,000 frenzied fans crying, "Bruce, Bruce, Bruce," he stepped on 
the stage. The Centrum reverberated as the audience stomped its feet on 
the floor.<br>
Then Bruce Springsteen, wearing black pants, white shirt and black 
cowboy boots, threw a bouquet of roses into the crowd and launched into 
the debut concert of his latest tour.<br>
For the next three hours, Springsteen and his E Street Band kept the 
audience mesmerized as he covered songs from his 15-year musical career.<br>
Springsteen is perhaps the rock star most beloved and revered by his 
fans. And part of the reason why could be seen and heard last night in 
the first of his three concerts at the Centrum.<br>
Despite the cavernous dimensions of the arena, Springsteen was able to maintain an intimacy with his fans.<br>
"He communicates with the audience," said Mary Burr, who came from Long 
Island, N.Y., to see Bruce. "He's not up there on stage like he's a big 
rock star and we're down here worshipping him. When he's up there it's 
like he's singing to me, even though the place is jammed."<br>
Many fans said they feel that Springsteen respects his audience and gives them 100 percent effort.<br>
"He gives you your money's worth," said Barbara McGovern, a 21-year-old 
student at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, who paid more than 
$100 to attend the show. "He's just pure rock 'n' roll."<br>
Among noteworthies in the audience were Boston Celtics star forward 
Kevin McHale, who towered over the rest of the crowd, and actor Rob 
Lowe. Both sang along with many Springsteen songs.<br>
"Bruce is great," Lowe said. "He just goes and gives it everything he's got. There's nothing fake about him."<br>
Police and security personnel reported no problems with the crowd either entering or leaving the arena.<br>
Throughout the day there were many signs about who was in town.<br>
"No one else who comes here creates this much excitement, this much 
hoopla," said Linda Holstrom, who works at a clothing store in the 
shadows of the Centrum. "He's definitely the hottest ticket in town."<br>
The scalpers kept one eye out for prospective customers and another eye out for police -- uniform and undercover.<br>
Those without a ticket were debating how much they were willing to pay. 
"Money is no object," said Bill McKay, who drove five hours from 
Freehold, N.J., just for the chance to see Bruce. Springsteen was born 
and raised and Freehold.<br>
"I'm willing to go about $200 but I want to get the best seat possible. 
He's a fellow hometown boy. Of course, I'd pay that much to see him."<br>
About two hours before the show, scalpers were asking $150 to $250 per 
ticket. The price among some ticket hawkers dropped to about $100 as the
 7:30 p.m. start drew near.<br>
Springsteen attracts one of the most loyal followings of any rock star. 
Fans like Steve Ticks, 28, who flew into Worcester from Los Angeles 
yesterday afternoon. And he did not even have a ticket.<br>
"I'll go anywhere to see the Boss," Ticks said as he added that he has 
been to 147 Springsteen shows. "I've seen him in Tokyo, Ireland and all 
over the United States."<br>
Ticks said he can afford to track Springsteen around the world by using 
his savings. "Bruce is the only thing I spend money on," said Ticks, who
 slightly resembles Springsteen. "And the only time I take a vacation is
 when Bruce tours."<br>
Ticks said he was turned on to Springsteen when he was only 14 years old
 and his brother played with Springsteen at the Stone Pony in Asbury 
Park, N.J., one of the clubs at which Springsteen got his start. 
"Because I was only a kid they would let me hang around and watch Bruce.
 This was before he became so big."<br>
And despite his rise to stardom, Springsteen in the eyes of his most 
fervent fans has not changed. His eloquent commentaries on the hopes and
 struggles of blue-collar and middle-class America have remained at the 
core of his nine albums.<br>
Debbie Slaughter, a 33-year-old fan who recently moved to Boston from 
Dallas, said, "He hasn't sold out. He has remained true to his music and
 most importantly to himself."<br>
Slaughter, who was about to see her third Springsteen show, said she did
 not become a true fan until about four years ago. "He doesn't touch 
people in Texas the way he does up here," she said.<br>
"I hadn't heard much about him. I mean until just a couple of years ago,
 Texas was enjoying real affluence. No one was interested in listening 
to the things Bruce sings about. About the people who have been left out
 or left behind. Up here it's different."</div>

MUSIC REVIEW<br>
WORCESTER - What a relief Bruce Springsteen must have experienced last 
night. After being hounded at his hotel and tracked around town by 
relentless hordes of media in recent days, he finally got a chance to do
 what he came to New England for -- play music.<br>
And what an unusual night of music it was.<br>
Kicking off his celebrity straitjacket, Springsteen tried to reinvent himself, as they say in the music business.<br>
He played many obscure songs from his repertoire, refusing to give the 
13,000 sellout fans a batch of easily digested hits and anthems.<br>
Springsteen made the audience think, not just boogie. But he had fun 
doing it, even sprinkling in bits of tongue-in-cheek cabaret for the 
first time in his career. That seemed another attempt to defuse his star
 status -- and ask the crowd not to view him so reverently.<br>
Last night's show, which began his first national tour in three years, 
started off with an unself-conscious, carnival theme. Springsteen and 
his entire E Street Band -- 7 regular members and the specially added 
five-piece La Bamba horns from New Jersey -- came out and sheepishly, 
like eternal teen-agers, pretended to buy tickets from a tuxedoed carny 
barker at a counter marked "Tunnel of Love Express Tour," adapted from 
the name of his latest album.<br>
Springsteen added to the theatrical element by being dressed in a white 
shirt, cream-colored vest, black pants and pointy black shoes that gave 
him the air of a boardwalk sharpie on the make.<br>
The first set, 75 minutes long, included no fewer than five songs from 
the "Tunnel of Love" album, which hasn't done astonishingly well on the 
charts, resting currently at No. 15 on Billboard magazine's Top Pop 100 
-- below albums by the likes of Belinda Carlisle, Debbie Gibson and 
Tiffany.<br>
But unlike Springsteen's last record, "Born in the U.S.A.," the album's 
softer moods weren't designed to crest the charts, so one has to admire 
his adherence to these songs in concert. He clearly doesn't want to sell
 his soul for the stadium success of the last tour -- and indeed, only 
did two songs, "Cover Me" and the set-ending title track, from his "Born
 in the U.S.A." disk.<br>
Also surprising was the number of obscure B-sides -- four of them -- 
which he played during the night. Even diehard fanatics were shaking 
their heads over a few of them, including "I'll Be True," "Roulette" and
 "Coward." Springsteen was asking to be judged as a true songwriter, not
 just an automatic hitmaker.<br>
As always, he also came off as a storyteller without peer in the rock 
industry. If Springsteen ever decides to run for political office -- and
 don't think there aren't many who would like to see him try -- he could
 go far with his frank confessions about himself and his folksy, 
populist style. This time he again told stories of tension with his 
Freehold, N.J., father -- stories that were a feature of his "River" 
tour in 1980. He also eloquently told of an abused neighbor who was 
sweet to him as a child -- and of the regret he had of returning home to
 that same neighborhood over the years and finding himself a complete 
stranger to it.<br>
"I felt I had changed. I had become a man, and the people who were kind 
to me were gone forever. The people in those houses were strangers just 
like me, doing the best they could to hold onto the things they loved," 
he said.<br>
He also engaged in more cabaret with saxophonist Clarence Clemons, 
sitting on a park bench and reminiscing about the old days when they 
would stare at passing girls and discuss their romantic dreams.<br>
In another cabaret gesture, Springsteen mimicked evangelist Jimmy 
Swaggart and stomped around stage, shouting "I've got to lay my body 
down for you tonight, because I have sinned!" Again, he was trying to 
come off as a flesh-and-blood figure, not a celebrity icon.<br>
Then, of course, he started rocking. The second set built up with some 
Bo Diddley beats ("She's the One," where Clemons unleashed his sax), 
some Lloyd Price-style New Orleans music ("You Can Look," where pianist 
Roy Bittan echoed Jerry Lee Lewis).<br>
But there were still the softer textures woven in, including another 
"Tunnel of Love" song, "One Step Up" (with a lovely backing vocal from 
Patty Scialfa, who is much more prominent on this tour) and an acoustic 
version of Springsteen's epic "Born to Run," which put him on the map in
 1975 when Time and Newsweek both ran their famous simultaneous cover 
stories.<br>
In sum, Springsteen is still the Boss, but a more gentle, 
ever-more-human boss this trip. His bid to fight his way out of the 
celebrity straitjacket made us all think a little more deeply last 
night.<br>

ALBUM REVIEW<br>
Bruce Springsteen has confessed that he went for the brass ring on his 
best-selling "Born in the U.S.A." album of 1984. He wrote anthemic 
singalongs designed to ignite a mass audience. His aim was uncanny: The 
album sold 10 million copies and catapulted him into the airy realm of 
stadium superstar.<br>
This runaway success apparently shook Springsteen to the core. His new 
album, "Tunnel of Love," which hits the stores tomorrow, is a radical 
shift from the rah-rah populism and pumped-up sound of "Born in the 
U.S.A." He turns to quiet, introspective love songs that might sound 
better in a coffeehouse than on an arena stage.<br>
"Tunnel of Love" is a modest, acoustic-flavored album more appropriate 
for late-night romantic listening than overdrive on the dance floor. It 
is a tender collection of psychic etchings, as Springsteen grapples with
 the issues of success, relationships, marriage and, most acutely, the 
persistent self- doubt that nags him no matter how many million records 
he's sold.<br>
The search for love is the objective here, not stardom. As Springsteen 
sings in the lead track, "Ain't Got You," which opens with a bluesy, a 
cappella vocal a la Brownie McGhee:<br>
I been around the world and all across the seven seas<br>
Been paid a king's ransom for doin' what comes naturally<br>
But I'm still the biggest fool, honey, this world ever knew<br>
'Cause the only thing I ain't got, baby, I ain't got you.<br>
By the last track, "Valentine's Day," Springsteen has found his baby and
 pledged his faith, but then looks on the flip side and realizes that 
"what scares me is losin' you." There are no easy solutions, nor easy 
moments of peace, on this album. Like his idol Hank Williams, 
Springsteen spins the simplest of melodies with the most unsettling of 
lyrical truths, helping make this a mature masterpiece. It may not be 
destined for eye-blinking commercial sales -- several tracks don't even 
have a drummer -- but it is sure evidence that Springsteen has not been 
jaded by celebrity.<br>
"Music from the beginning always meant so much to me -- and the biggest 
fear was that in some way I was wasting people's time," Springsteen said
 in an interview in 1980. "In the end, you never answer those questions 
completely or fully, which is good, because once you do that, you get 
smug."<br>
There's no smugness on "Tunnel of Love," not when one encounters a song 
such as "Two Faces," with an old-fashioned fuzz guitar sound and these 
lyrics: "I met a girl and we ran away/ I swore I'd make her happy every 
day/ And how I made her cry/ Two faces have I. . . One that laughs, one 
that cries/ One says hello, one says goodbye/ One does things I don't 
understand/ Makes me feel like half a man."<br>
There are several reflective country songs reminiscent of his previous 
albums, "Nebraska" and "The River." The prettiest is "Tougher Than the 
Rest," about summoning the courage to ask a woman to dance. Springsteen 
plays a twangy guitar out of the songbooks of Waylon Jennings and Duane 
Eddy, ending with a wistful harmonica fade. And on the gentle "All That 
Heaven Will Allow," the album's most positive song about romance, a 
synthesizer simulates a Nashville pedal steel guitar.<br>
In contrast to "Born in the U.S.A.," Springsteen's E Street Band takes a
 definite back seat on the new album. Springsteen handles most of the 
instruments -- what few there are -- by himself. His guitarist, Nils 
Lofgren, plays only one discernible solo, while saxophonist Clarence 
Clemons doesn't pick up his sax at all and only sings backup vocals. The
 recent low-key single, "Brilliant Disguise," is one of the few 
band-oriented songs on the album. Most of the time, the atmospherics 
comes from Springsteen's acoustic guitar and Roy Bittan's ethereally 
textured synthesizer. An example is the stately "Cautious Man," which 
describes a drifter named Billy who falls in love but can't shed his 
restless love of the road. Sings Springsteen in a haunting verse: "On 
the right hand Billy'd tattooed the word love and on his left hand was 
the word fear/ And in which hand he held his fate was never clear."<br>
Not every song is an intense meditation, however. Conscious of his New 
Jersey roots, Springsteen sings in the title track of dating a girl in a
 local Jersey amusement park. He also adds the sound of a roller coaster
 in a brief touch of humor. But just as quickly comes the warning: 
"You've got to learn to live with what you can't rise above if you want 
to ride on down through this tunnel of love."<br>
The ride is a demanding one, but for experienced Springsteen fans who 
know him best as a songwriter and not a stadium icon, the ride is well 
worth taking.<br>

What would you pay for The Boss' hot new album set?<br>
How does $33.49 sound?<br>
Or $24.99?<br>
Or even better, $22.99?<br>
Bruce Springsteen is tough, rugged, spirited -- as American as the 
competition that is now raging among Boston record stores in the wake of
 Monday's national release of his first authorized live album.<br>
Carrying a "list" price of $33.98, "Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street
 Band: Live 1975-85" is the hottest-selling item in Boston's record 
stores. And the competition is fierce as the stores compete for the 
hearts, minds and allowances of Boston's rock fans.<br>
"We want to get them in the store and we want to sell them something," 
said Jeff Cohen, assistant buyer for Strawberries Records and Tapes. 
Strawberries' strategy is to sell the three- cassette, or five-record 
set for $22.99, with the hope that a good price inspires customers to 
patronize the chain in the future.<br>
"With Christmas coming up, we're hoping that a lot of people come in here to do their album shopping," Cohen said.<br>
But Bobby Hall, pop record buyer for the Harvard Cooperative Society, 
questioned whether The Coop should sell the album for its current $22.95
 asking price. "It's one of those items that you could sell for much 
more," Hall said.<br>
And Jere Rastellini can prove it. Rastellini, a salesman at Musicland in
 Somerville, said his shop has sold 20 of Springsteen's albums since 
Monday for $33.49 apiece.<br>
The set's wholesale price -- the price that the stores pay for the album -- is about $19.<br>
Dale Hamula, manager of Record Town in Boston, has put a $24.99 price 
tag on Springsteen's latest. "It's very reasonably priced for a 
five-album set. And from what I understand, that's how Bruce wanted to 
do it."<br>

<br>
Talk about a long and winding road.<br>
His first albums in the early 1970s had a tuba and accordion on some 
tracks. Absurdist beat poetry was mixed in with regional, street-smart 
tales of Jersey shore youth. There was little reason to predict that he 
was going to sell millions of records in the years to come and be ranked
 with the most respected artists of his era.<br>
Bruce Springsteen, who opens his national tour with a three-night 
sellout at the Worcester Centrum beginning Thursday, has made only eight
 studio albums in 16 years -- but has already encompassed more musical 
styles than any of his competitors, except perhaps Bob Dylan and David 
Bowie.<br>
A look back at Springsteen's music provides a glimpse of a singer 
perpetually in motion, refining high ideals born after viewing Elvis 
Presley and the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan show -- ideals that have led 
to a rarefied status as heart and soul of the Big Chill generation.<br>
"Because of the naiveness of that era, it's easily trivialized and 
laughed at," Springsteen said of the '60s in an interview in Rolling 
Stone's 20th anniversary issue last year. "But underneath it, I think 
people were trying in some sense to redefine their own lives and the 
country that they lived in, in some more open and free and just fashion .
 . . The values from that time are things that I still believe in."<br>
Springsteen, the 38-year-old son of a Freehold, N.J., bus driver, has 
continually redefined his life through music. He has moved from an early
 bohemian fetish to a period as an ambitious star-struck rocker. He 
added later sidetrips as a stark country singer with a debt to Hank 
Williams; and a socially conscious folkie with a debt to Woody Guthrie.<br>
His latest coup is "Tunnel of Love," a musically low-key, ballad-rich 
work that, despite its pleasant melodies, features an unblinking 
appraisal of the self-doubt involved in romance and other modern 
relationships.<br>
"One of the things I wanted the record to be about is that we live in a 
society that wants us to buy illusion every day," Springsteen told 
Newsweek magazine last November. "That happens on a national scale, like
 Reagan telling us there are no hungry people here, just people who 
don't know where to go to get food. There's still that will to pretend 
that everything is OK. That I'm OK, and you're OK. That it's morning 
again in America. That happens on a personal level also. People are sold
 this every day: You're gonna live happily ever after. So when you do 
begin to feel conflict -- the natural human conflict that comes with any
 human relationship -- people have a tendency to repress it."<br>
Few songwriters have written more thoughtfully about human conflict than
 Springsteen. Even back in the early '70s, when tuba, accordion and such
 exotica were heard in his heavily Dylan-influenced music, he cried out 
for honesty. "Walk tall, baby, or don't walk at all," he sang in "New 
York Serenade," a piano ballad on his second album, "The Wild, the 
Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle" (1973).<br>
Back then, however, most of Springsteen's pleas were couched in language
 that by his current standards was incomprehensible. Springsteen was 
then a fast-talking Jersey shore gypsy -- a real Asbury Park alleycat. 
"I was king of the alley, mama, I could talk some trash," he sang on his
 first album, "Greetings from Asbury Park" (1972). His melodies and 
shifting time signatures were dazzling, but he was trying to be a 
stream-of-conscious Beat poet a la Allen Ginsburg -- and he often 
sounded like a hippie who, as the saying went, had too much to dream 
last night.<br>
"I took monthlong vacations in the stratosphere and you know it's really
 hard to hold your breath/ I swear I lost everything I ever loved or 
feared/ I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress," he sang on that 
first album. It also contained the song, "Does This Bus Stop at 82nd 
Street?" in which he went off the deep end with this rap about New York 
street people: "Wizard imps and sweat sock pimps, interstellar mongrel 
nymphs." At times, he sounded like Timothy Leary with a guitar.<br>
But the following album, "The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street 
Shuffle," was full of promise, spanning Memphis horns and Latin congas 
and hinting at the revelatory soul-searching to come. It included a 
couple of classics he still performs on stage, "Rosalita (Come Out 
Tonight)" and "4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)." The latter, a bluesy 
ballad, included this patented Bruce-ism: "I got tired of hanging in 
these dusty arcades banging these pleasure machines/ Chased enough 
factory girls under the boardwalk."<br>
Then came 1975's epic "Born to Run," with production help from Jon 
Landau, the former Boston Phoenix music critic who is now Springsteen's 
manager. The album will probably be on every Top 10 list from now until 
the apocalypse. It's a determinedly ambitious album ("I thought, 'I'm 
going to make the greatest rock 'n' roll record ever made,' " he has 
said), and includes such rave-up standards as "Jungleland," "Tenth 
Avenue Freeze-Out" and "Thunder Road," with the pumping sax of Clarence 
Clemons and a memorable line about the explosive kinship of a 
hot-rodding automobile: "All the redemption I can offer, girl, is 
beneath this dirty hood."<br>
Looking back, however, "Born to Run" is a great but stylized album. It 
won Springsteen a fanatical, arena-sized audience, but his songwriting 
didn't fully mature until his next two LPs, "Darkness on the Edge of 
Town" (1978) and "The River" (1980), which are arguably the two best 
albums of his career. They were born partly of pain -- Springsteen had 
been forced to stay off the road for two years during a nasty legal 
battle with ex-manager Mike Appel -- but that pain brought a stunning, 
new-found depth to his songwriting.<br>
"I want to find one face that ain't looking through me," Springsteen 
sang in "Badlands," from the "Darkness" LP. He also learned the value of
 tension-and-release in his songs, building from stately organ lines by 
bandmate Danny Federici to razor-edged guitar by new member "Miami 
Steve" Van Zandt. The subsequent "River," a double LP, had some moments 
of frivolity ("Cadillac Ranch," "Sherry Darling"), but also some richly 
poignant numbers like "Independence Day" (about growing up and leaving 
his father's home) and "Point Blank," about a former girlfriend who 
falls into a welfare existence.<br>
"I always wanted to live solidly in the present, always remember the 
past and always be planning for the future," Springsteen has said. "So 
from 'Darkness' to 'The River,' I was attempting to pull myself into 
what I felt was going to be the adult world, so that when things became 
disorienting, I would be strong enough to hold my ground. Those were the
 records where I was trying to forge that foundation and maintain my 
connections and try to say, 'Well, what is this going to mean? Maybe 
what this is all going to mean is up to me.' "<br>
By this time, Springsteen was a superstar who played two sellout nights 
at Boston Garden. But then came the roundhouse curve of "Nebraska" 
(1982), his Hank Williams/Woody Guthrie influenced acoustic album made 
on a four-track home tape recorder. Two of its songs, "Johnny 99" and 
"State Trooper," were laments for the common man and were covered by 
Johnny Cash. But the album doesn't stand the test of time that well. The
 problem is that several of the songs turned up in magnificent, 
band-accompanied versions on his last tour -- and after hearing them, 
one wishes they were on the LP.<br>
After the "Nebraska' side trip, it was back to home run territory with 
the big-beat, arena-aimed "Born in the U.S.A." (1984), which sold 10 
million copies and even brought Springsteen to the attention of 
President Reagan, who tried to make a jingoistic case for the title 
track, but was misled (and admonished by Springsteen), since the song 
was really about the alienation -- not chauvinism -- of a Vietnam 
veteran. Other songs, though, especially "Dancing in the Dark," created 
controversy only because Springsteen diehards wondered if he weren't 
going too far by writing such obviously commercial material.<br>
Maybe that's a reason he responded with the new "Tunnel of Love" album. 
It is a gentle, thought-provoking work with no evident hit singles, 
though there have still been a few anyway, such as the painterly 
"Brilliant Disguise" and "Tunnel of Love," which featured a video in 
which Springsteen again strode along the Asbury Park boardwalk of his 
youth. It was a smart way of showing he hasn't forgotten his roots.<br>
"I guess," Springsteen told Rolling Stone, "that when I started in music
 I thought, 'My job is pretty simple. My job is that I search for the 
human things in myself, and I turn them into notes and words. And then 
in some fashion, I help people hold on to their own humanity -- if I'm 
doing my job right."<br>

WEEKEND / CD REVIEW<br>
Bruce Springsteen is at another crossroads. His new album with the E 
Street Band finds him contemplating the devastation of Sept. 11, but 
also more familiar topics such as the bond of family, the comfort of 
faith, and the joys of partying. In other words, it's all over the 
place. It is brilliant at times and embarrassing at times. And while its
 ambition sometimes exceeds its grasp, it is still one of the most 
captivating records of the year. Titled "The Rising," it is 
Springsteen's first studio album with the E Street Band since 1987's 
"Tunnel of Love." Due out on Tuesday, it's 73 minutes long, and its 15 
songs could easily have been split into two CDs. It might have made 
philosophical sense to do that - put the optimistic, party-style songs 
on one CD and the more socially conscious tracks on the other - but that
 was unlikely, as Springsteen's last attempt at releasing two CDs 
simultaneously ("Human Touch" and "Lucky Town" in 1992) was a commercial
 failure.<br>
Instead, Springsteen fans will have to weave through the peaks and valleys of a<br>
single marathon album that eventually reconfirms the Boss's genius, but 
only after some bumpy moments that could have been edited out without 
losing much. Into that category falls the mushy "Waitin' on a Sunny Day"
 ("gonna chase the clouds away"), which sounds like routine bubble-gum 
pop from Phil Spector's heyday; and the gooey "Mary's Place" ("Meet me 
at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party"), which sounds like an 
outtake from the boxed set of outtakes that Springsteen released a few 
years ago.<br>
That said, the album touches the soul much more often than not. The 
Sept. 11 songs are no-holds-barred odes that draw on the pain 
Springsteen felt when his Monmouth County, N.J., home area lost 150 
lives to the attacks on the World Trade Center. The poignant, cello- 
enhanced "You're Missing" has Springsteen sadly singing, "Your house is 
waiting for you, but you're missing . . . children are asking if it's 
all right, will you be in our arms tonight?" And the country- bluesy 
"Into the Fire" is a tribute to the firefighters who perished in the 
tragedy: "I heard you calling, but you disappeared into the dust 
upstairs, into the fire." Then comes this gospel-inspired chorus: "May 
your strength give us strength/May your faith give us faith/May your 
hope give us hope."<br>
A number of the new songs rock (with guitarist Steve Van Zandt playing a
 forceful role), but again there's a balancing act of emotions. 
Sonically, the opening track, "Lonesome Day," could fit onto 
Springsteen's anthemic "Born in the U.S.A." album of 1984, yet 
lyrically, it clearly references Sept. 11: "Let kingdom come, I'm gonna 
find my way through this lonesome day." But then there's the 
arena-rocking "Further On (Up the Road)," which was written before the 
attacks and is more quintessential Springsteen: "So let's take the good 
times as they go, and I'll meet you further on up the road."<br>

globe/living.<br>
Whether you're a Springsteen diehard or not, there are a half- dozen 
outstanding tracks that affirm his Dylan-of-his-generation credentials. 
"Empty Sky" is a stunning achievement. Yet another allusion to the World
 Trade Center aftermath, it opens with elegiac piano from Roy Bittan, 
gives way to stately acoustic guitar, then sears the heart with its dual
 yearning for love ("I want a kiss from your lips") and vengeance ("I 
want an eye for an eye").<br>
Two other gems break new artistic ground. The song "Worlds Apart" 
combines a piercing, Neil Young-ish guitar solo with vocals in the 
qawwali style (music of Islamic Sufi mystics) from Asif Ali Khan. It 
also breaks new lyrical ground, as Springsteen refers to a Muslim 
seeking love (" 'neath Allah's rain, we remain worlds apart"), though he
 seems out of his element here. But the real standout is "The Fuse," 
which merges tape-looped drums and vocals (has Springsteen been 
listening to William Orbit?) for the most adventurous track here. It 
moves from ominous imagery (a funeral procession) to the joys of 
lovemaking in spite of it all: "On the edge of the bed you slip off your
 blouse/<br>
The room is burning with the noon sun/Your bittersweet taste on my tongue."<br>
The overall message of the album, amid its many schizoid turns, is that 
Springsteen continues to crave intimacy despite the psychic dislocation 
brought on by Sept. 11. In the classic R&amp;B-style "Let's Be Friends 
(Skin to Skin)," which also has a nice sax solo from Clarence Clemons, 
Springsteen sings, "The time is now, maybe we could get skin to 
skin/Don't know when this chance might come again."<br>
One can only wonder what this album would have been like without the 
urgency of Sept. 11. Springsteen sometimes tries too hard to comment on 
the events (and sounds stilted), but while this isn't the best album of 
his career, it's still good enough to be a must- listen for believers.</div>

CD REVIEW<br>
Bruce Springsteen has always had a tendency to follow up a blockbuster 
with a curveball. If he's been consistent in anything, it's his 
predilection for surprise.<br>
Just look at his catalog. After "The River" exalted him to arena-ready 
rock god in 1980, he released "Nebraska," an unvarnished acoustic gem 
that ruminated on the country's dismal state of affairs. The bombast of 
1992's "Lucky Town" dovetailed into the quiet grace of "The Ghost of Tom
 Joad" three years later.<br>
And no one was expecting 2006's "We Shall Overcome: The Seeger 
Sessions," a rollicking, good-time folk album that preceded the 
full-throttle rock of last year's "Magic," which reunited Springsteen 
with the E Street Band.<br>
Just 16 months later comes another surprising detour. "Working on a 
Dream," out Tuesday but already streaming in its entirety at <a href="http://www.npr.com/" class="postlink">www.npr.com</a>,
 is a Springsteen album that doesn't sound like it has Bruce Springsteen
 at its core. That's an odd sensation considering that when you hear 
Springsteen's music you're always keenly aware of his persona - his 
history, his politics, that voice.<br>
By turns jangly folk-rock and bright '60s-inspired pop, "Working on a 
Dream" presents Springsteen in a more personal state of mind. After the 
rallying spirit of "We Shall Overcome" and the seething anger of 
"Magic," it's glaring how apolitical the new album is. This is not 
Springsteen's soundtrack to the Obama administration.<br>
It is, however, a sonically adventurous album, with the E Street Band 
again accompanying him. But the songwriting far too often feels like an 
afterthought, canned and jarringly shallow. We learn Springsteen is in 
love with the "Queen of the Market": "I take my place in the checkout 
line/ For one moment her eyes meet mine." I'm hesitant to repeat the 
rest of the lyric, but here goes: "And I'm lifted up, lifted up, lifted 
up, lifted up, lifted away."<br>
Produced by Brendan O'Brien, who also worked on "The Rising," "Devils 
&amp; Dust," and "Magic," the album opens with "Outlaw Pete," a driving,
 eight-minute epic flush with strings and a cliched cowboy storyline. 
The surprise in question on "Surprise, Surprise" is this clunker: "C'mon
 open your eyes and/ Let your love shine down."<br>
Springsteen fares better when he explores the possibilities of a broad 
musical palette. He's nearly unrecognizable on "This Life," a sublime 
slice of power pop that would have suited Roy Orbison, with the Beach 
Boys on gilded harmonies. On "Good Eye," Springsteen takes a stab at 
cosmic blues with a cacophony of distorted sounds. But then the momentum
 is upended by "Kingdom of Days," which drivels out of the speakers with
 the kind of pat chorus you'd think Springsteen would be incapable of 
writing.<br>
Curiously, "Working on a Dream" comes with a DVD on the making of the 
album, but it's safe to say this isn't a classic that warrants it. 
You'll just have to wait for the next curveball.<br>

<strong class="text-strong">THE BOSS' LINES WERE BUSY; CALLS FOR SPRINGSTEEN TICKETS; DISRUPT PHONE SERVICE IN WASHINGTON<br>
<br>
Boston Globe <br>

<br>
CENTERPIECE<br>
What does it take to jam up the telephone lines of the nation's capital 
to the point where it's not worth even trying to make a call?<br>
"Mother's Day and Christmas, holidays like that. And disasters like 
heavy snowstorms or the plane crash into the Potomac three years ago," 
said a spokesman for the local telephone company. "And now this."<br>
From just after 10 a.m. until almost noon yesterday, so many fans were 
calling a local 800 number to buy tickets to an upcoming Bruce 
Springsteen concert that business - at least for those who depend on the
 phone - slowed to a crawl.<br>
It took a few attempts for many callers in Washington, eastern Maryland 
and Richmond, Va., to get a dial tone, and even then many local calls 
did not get through.<br>
That was nothing, though, compared to what the circuit congestion did to
 long-distance calling - in and out of the city. No dial tones, for 
example. Or dial tones that wouldn't go away. Or, when calling from out 
of town, nonstop busy signals.<br>
For purposes of comparison, Lowell Connor, a spokesman for AT&amp;T, 
cited figures for the peak hour yesterday and for a typical Monday 
morning. Between 10:30 and 11:30 last week, he said, 858,000 calls went 
through the three switches that handle long-distance for the 
Baltimore-Washington area. Yesterday the number exceeded 2 million.<br>
"We just didn't anticipate it," he said. "If there's a major disaster, 
we know what we'll be having to deal with. . . .But who could have known
 this would happen for a rock 'n' roll concert?"<br>
The last time the circuits were blocked like this, Connor said, was when
 an Air Florida jet crashed into the 14th Street Bridge in 1982. And the
 Associated Press quoted Charles B. Overly Jr., director of the 
Pentagon's telecommunications center, as saying during the jam-up: "One 
guy over at the telephone company just told us the switching center is 
tied up about the way it was when (President John F.) Kennedy was 
assassinated."<br>
More than 53,000 tickets to the Springsteen concert were put on sale at 
10 a.m. yesterday. An hour and a half later, they were gone. Some fans 
had been camped out since last Friday at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium, 
where the concert will be held Aug. 5, for the chance to lay down $18.50
 per seat.<br>
The Washington show will be the first in a nine-week US tour by 
Springsteen, following his sold-out dates at concerts across Europe, 
Japan and Australia. Tickets for the second stop in the United States, 
Cleveland, are already gone; 65,000 seats were sold out in just over 
three hours on Saturday. Promoters estimate that when the American leg 
of the tour ends 3 million people will have paid to see the man 
nicknamed The Boss.<br>
Local businesses contacted yesterday said they had been inconvenienced 
by the disruption of phone service, but most took it with good humor. 
"You'd never think a rock star would cause so many problems," said an 
employee at one travel agency. "I guess he must be pretty good."<br>
AT&amp;T might have underestimated Springsteen's popularity this time, 
but Connor said it won't happen again; when tickets go on sale in 
Chicago, the third stop on the tour, the long-distance company will be 
ready.<br>
"We can reprogram the computers if we know it's coming," he said, "and we'll certainly learn from this experience."<br>

<strong class="text-strong">Tireless Springsteen, E Street Band still keeping the throttle wide open<br>
<br>
Boston Globe <br>

<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band don't have to play for two hours
 and 40 minutes. Nor, when they play, is it a requirement that 
Springsteen fall to his knees, shimmy and shake, attack his guitar like 
he's still discovering new sounds it can make, or take audience requests
 that he and his band don't know how to play.<br>
Last night at the TD Banknorth Garden, in the first of two sold-out 
shows, Springsteen and his band mates did all of that and more, making 
clear that, nearly 40 years on, they may not have to do these things but
 they still need to.<br>
Even if there are obviously times that a body wants to wilt, or a newer 
song, sometimes justifiably, doesn't go over quite as well as an older 
one, that joyful tirelessness is a marvel.<br>
And it was there in the night's best moments, which were plentiful and 
disparate in a set that covered a lot of ground. It zipped from the '70s
 to the present, encompassed an ecstatic "Rosalita" and a prayerful "The
 Wrestler," and went from dead serious to footloose and fancy free in 
the time it took Springsteen to change guitars.<br>
Near the top of the list of highs was Springsteen's inspired ax work in 
general and that of Nils Lofgren in particular. Lofgren was otherworldly
 on a downright incendiary "Ghost of Tom Joad," building a wall of 
stinging sustained notes while flailing his legs in a frenzy before 
finally releasing the tension.<br>
That tune was part of a mini-suite of songs - including "Seeds" and 
"Johnny 99" - early in the set that addressed hard times and the people 
trying to bear up under them with ruefulness and rage both lyrically and
 musically in Springsteen's tangled guitar licks and impassioned growl.<br>
The infusion of new blood - keyboardist Charlie Giordano and singers 
Curtis King and Cindy Mizelle - seems to have revitalized the entire 
band, although King and Mizelle might want to ask for a little more 
amplification tonight. Drummer Max Weinberg's son Jay, who will be 
filling in for his "Tonight Show"-bound dad in Europe, was a demon 
behind the kit, immediately ratcheting up the energy level on the first 
of the handful of songs he played. With his long hair flying and singing
 along with gusto as he played, he seemed like the happiest fan in the 
crowd as he pounded out "Born to Run." (Springsteen's wife, Patti 
Scialfa, was MIA due to a recent fall from a horse.)<br>
Even when the group didn't know where they were going they kept the car 
on the road. When Springsteen plucked a request sign from the pile he'd 
collected that read "I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide" by ZZ Top he said, "The 
band doesn't know this song. The band has never played this song" and 
then he showed them the sign and away they went like the happy gang of 
musicians they obviously still are.<br>

<strong class="text-strong">VAN ZANDT'S WHIRLWIND DIPLOMACY TOUR TAPERING OFF<br>
<br>
Boston Globe <br>

<br>
PREVIEW<br>
Little Steven Van Zandt has been more of a diplomat than a musician in 
the past six months. In support of his anti-apartheid song, "Sun City," 
he has crisscrossed the country many times, meeting with ambassadors in 
the United Nations, mayors in Atlanta and Los Angeles, congressmen and 
senators in Washington, school children in Chicago and religious leaders
 from around the world, including the South African bishop and Nobel 
Peace Prize winner, Desmond Tutu.<br>
But Van Zandt's whirlwind diplomacy is finally tapering off.<br>
"It's not the kind of thing I'm going to leave fully behind until South 
Africa is free, but it's not going to be 100 percent of my life. There 
are other things that need attention," he says, referring to his next 
solo album. "It's pretty much over now as far as the 'Sun City' record 
and the whole project is concerned."<br>
Van Zandt's visit to Boston's Metro Wednesday, during which he'll speak 
but not perform at a Free South Africa Day concert starring locals Down 
Avenue, Skin, the I-Tones and New Man, will be his last purely "Sun 
City"-related travel stop.<br>
"This event in Boston is kind of the official end to it; and it's 
appropriate because Boston was the first place we went," he says, 
recalling an October visit when he brought the newly-minted "Sun City" 
single, which included vocals by Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney and 
Gil Scott-Heron, to be premiered over Boston radio station WBCN. The 
song denounced the segregated, Las Vegas-like Sun City resort in South 
Africa and was followed by an album, book and video cassette featuring 
interviews with Springsteen and protest leader Winnie Mandela.<br>
"It's been a really good thing, so I don't have any regrets whatsoever 
about the project," Van Zandt added during a recent phone interview from
 Los Angeles, where he's also helping produce an album by the 
country-rock band Lone Justice.<br>
But no regrets? Even though the "Sun City" record was profusely praised 
by the press yet received spotty airplay and only went to No. 39 on the 
Billboard pop charts, contrasted to the "We are the World" antifamine 
single that entered the charts at No. 20 and shot right into the Top 10?<br>
"When somebody doesn't want to play a record, that's up to them. That's 
what a free society is all about," he says of radio's checkered response
 to his funk-based song. "I understand radio feels it has to draw lines 
and subscribe to rigid categorizations. But I really didn't go into this
 thinking the record would be played in America at all."<br>
Van Zandt was right in expecting a better response in the more socially-
 aware European countries, where "Sun City" jumped into every nation's 
Top Ten. In all, the single has sold a half-million copies (six times 
fewer than "We Are the World").<br>
"From a commercial point of view, the sales were disappointing compared 
to 'We Are the World,' " says his press liaison, Danny Schecter. "But 
you have to remember that 'Sun City' criticized Ronald Reagan by name 
and mentioned a place no one knew about. It did pretty well considering 
all that."<br>
Another success was that the single was circulated in South Africa, 
where the government was afraid to ban it because they reportedly didn't
 want to alienate white youths who wanted to hear Springsteen, who also 
had the No. 2 album in the country at the time. And above all, no major 
entertainer has since played at Sun City, whose owners have been so 
desperate they recently consented to allow black South African bands to 
perform there, but were unanimously turned down by them as well.<br>

VINTAGE BOSS Through the years, Springsteen on the record<br>
<br>
Boston Globe <br>

<br>
C'mon, did anybody really doubt that Bruce Springsteen would someday play with the E Street Band again?<br>
It took 10 years to get from breakup to reunion tour, but now that it's 
happening it seems completely natural. This isn't one of those cynical 
"let's cash in once more" rock deals. It's more like a brotherhood 
reaffirmed -- another payoff on the promise of those glory nights when 
Springsteen and the E Streeters made you believe anything was possible 
in rock 'n' roll.<br>
Signs that the reunion was coming were evident in an interview 
Springsteen did with the Globe last fall, when he released his boxed set
 "Tracks." "I had some of the greatest nights of my life on stage with 
them," Springsteen said at the time. "I can't imagine at some point that
 we wouldn't do it again."<br>
The time has come, as Springsteen and the E Street Band open a 
record-setting five-show run at the FleetCenter tonight. All the shows 
are sold out -- and the group is expected to gross a rather tidy $1.15 
million per show. And that, of course, doesn't count merchandise sales.<br>
But Springsteen has never played just for profit. He's a craftsman, not 
an entrepreneur: "I'm a synthesist. I'm always making music," he said 
last fall. "And I make a lot of different kinds of music all the time."<br>
Springsteen has not done any interviews during this tour -- not on its 
first leg, in Europe, and not now, in the States. But a skim through 
this writer's old notebooks shows that many of the things Springsteen 
has said through the years paint a consistent picture of an artist who 
takes rock music as seriously as anyone in the business.<br>
On music as his career (1988): "I always knew that music was my job, my 
life, but I guess you question what you've got to offer, what you've got
 to say. Music, from the beginning, always meant so much to me. And the 
biggest fear was that in some way I was wasting people's time. In the 
end, you never answer those questions completely or fully -- which is 
good, because once you do that you get smug."<br>
On record sales (1988): "The first thing you've got to stop worrying 
about is how much your record is going to sell. If it starts to sell 
less, then that's OK. It's still the record I wanted to make."<br>
On performance (1984): "You should just be intuitive. I never like to 
find myself thinking during a song, because you've got to be in that 
song at that time. So you don't have many distant thoughts -- those come
 after the show. I'll go home and I'll get in bed and think about what I
 did tonight. I think you become self-conscious then."<br>
On what he wanted his music to say (1998): "I always wanted my music to 
influence the life you were living emotionally -- with your family, your
 lover, your wife, and, at a certain point, with your children. So I 
aspired to write across a wide range of topics. I guess the only map I 
followed was what I found myself going through in my own life."<br>
On his father's influence (1998): "In the early years, I found a voice 
that was my voice and partly my father's voice. But isn't that what you 
always do? Why do kids at 5 years old go into the closet and put daddy's
 shoes on? Hey, my kids do it. Or they run in the car and come clunking 
out with your boots on. And I think that was part of what I was doing. 
It was the fuel and fire for a lot of songs, particularly on `Darkness 
on the Edge of Town' and `The River.' It's always been a central 
connection. Then you go beyond it and find your own life."<br>
On being outside the music business (1996): "At this point, I see the 
music scene and music business as relatively inhospitable. But I feel a 
greater sense of purpose. I have a greater idea of what my job is, who I
 am, and what I want to do, not just this year but in the future. It's 
pretty much outside the general thrust of the music business, but that's
 OK."<br>
On Hank Williams, one of his favorite songwriters (1980): "You always 
had that sense of rootlessness in all his stuff. It's not an outlaw or a
 rebel thing, which is funny because when I first started, people 
thought my characters were rebels, but I never thought they were. They 
were just normal people trying to live, period. Anyway, with Hank 
Williams's stuff, which I played while traveling around the country on 
the entire last tour, his words were just so beautiful and his songs 
were so real."<br>
On social consciousness (1996): "In every study, the division of wealth 
is increasing in the US. And the debate is how much we are cutting back 
and can cut out of the budget -- not whether some people actually need 
more assistance. It's always how much money to take away. But what about
 the people who don't have much to start with? That's at the core of 
what I'm trying to do. It's a search for beauty, and in beauty there is 
hope, and in hope there is some sense of divine love, of faith, of 
community and possibility, of things that would combat the brutality and
 the violence and the suffering. That's what I'm trying to lay out 
there. It's a survival guide." <br>

Three hours, 41 minutes and 24 seconds of soul-searing, ground- shaking,
 fist-waving,mind-blowing rock 'n' roll, and it was over. Another Bruce 
Springsteen concert, another 55,000 fans reinfused with passion, another
 paragraph in the history of contemporary music.<br>
Superlatives come easy when you're in-<br>
toxicated, and Springsteen's show sent a constant stream of clear, sweet
 lyrical wine through the capacity crowd at RFK Stadium here Monday 
night. The elixir kicked in with the first sip: a steamy, raspy, driving
 rendition of "Born in the USA," the song that's fast become his anthem 
for the nation, his broad-brush mural of America as a proud land of 
broken promises and shattered dreams.<br>
And there was no letup. From the boisterous and defiant - "Born to Run" 
"Johnny 99," "Working on the Highway" - to the poignant and hopeful - 
"My Home Town," "The Promised Land," "Dancing in the Dark" - Springsteen
 seemed bent on infusing every note with all the energy in his taut, 
muscular body (itself the product of a concerted weight- training 
program).<br>
A working class hero is something to be.<br>
A working class hero is something to be.<br>
If you want to be a hero, well, just follow me.<br>
- John Lennon<br>
Every Springsteen performance is an exercise in controlled intensity, 
and every tune Springsteen writes is, in its way, political. On this, 
the first stop on his current American tour, however, there were some 
differences, if not in style, then of degree.<br>
When the audience is on its feet virtually through an artist's entire 
concert, there's little doubt that he knows how to hold the crowd. And 
Springsteen has had his audiences standing for 10 years. Now, though, 
hesomehow seems better at it, able through the timing and sequence of 
his selections to orchestrate the response as well as to provoke it.<br>
Likewise, there is no mistaking the message of a man who writes ballads 
about the unemployed and the hungry, about lives destroyed by foreign 
wars, about loneliness and terror and rage and despair in a country 
awash in an apathy born of affluence. But with the exception of a series
 of comments on domestic problems in response to President Reagan's 
invoking his name during last year's primary campaign, Springsteen has 
made a point of not entering the political fray rhetorically.<br>
In this way, too, Monday night signaled a change, perhaps a personal or 
artistic growth, a recognition of the role of a pop hero and the 
influence he can have.<br>
"Next time there's a war, whether it's in Central America or wherever it
 might be, you're going to be the ones they want to go," he told the 
screaming throng. "You need a lot more information than you get on the 6
 o'clock news to decide what to do." Then, lest anyone mistake his 
point, he added that the country is on a clear course, "and where we're 
going is pretty scary."<br>
It's difficult to tell how seriously the audience took his warning, but 
the only moments it seemed restless was during that short speech and 
another onhelping food banks. Appearances can be deceiving, but the 
underclass about which he sings so often and cares so much seemed 
little-represented at his concert.<br>
Bruce Springsteen may have been born to run, but his polite, well- 
scrubbed teenage fans seem content to vent their social indignation 
vicariously.<br>
It was encore time. Springsteen delivered with three sets, each as 
rousing as the one before, each filled with rock classics by the Beatles
 and Elvis Presley.<br>
But first, he had a few words to say: "I'd like to know. I gotta know." 
Then he teased some more: "I want to know. I need to know." The crowd 
knew what was coming, but clearly wanted to prolong the moment. So their
 idol complied: "I just got to know. I just need to know."<br>
A minute later, the gruff Jersey voice delivered the question and the name of the next song: "Do you love me?"<br>
The stadium erupted. Lit matches filled the night. Even the concrete shook.<br>
For almost four hours, they'd been waiting for him to ask.<br>

<br>
WORCESTER -- Bruce Springsteen still plays marathon, three-hour-length 
shows. That's no surprise. But the surprise on his latest tour is just 
how much he's shaking those shows up from night to night. He's adding 
songs, subtracting songs, changing arrangements and generally keeping 
new and old fans happily off guard.<br>
Springsteen, who opened a two-show stand at the Worcester Centrum last 
night, has now mixed in 29 different songs from the 28 songs he 
performed when his stateside tour began three weeks ago.<br>
"We just played New Jersey for 11 nights, and I was pulling out 
everything I could," Springsteen said with a laugh yesterday afternoon 
at the Centrum. "There's a basic structure to the set, but I want enough
 room in it so it doesn't get embalmed. I want to keep it exciting for 
the musicians and for myself."<br>
Before the tour, Springsteen had promised to stress newer tunes from his
 latest albums, "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town," but suddenly a lot of 
chestnuts like "Rosalita," "I'm on Fire," "Badlands" "Spirit in the 
Night" and "Darlington County" are starting to creep in.<br>
"I'm choosing whatever feels right," said Springsteen after a sound 
check. "I want to recontextualize the old songs with the new material. 
And I'm pulling a lot from the `Darkness' album, because it fits in well
 at the moment, especially with the mood of the country." (Springsteen's
 "Darkness on the Edge of Town" album came out in the late '70s after a 
turbulent period in his career.)<br>
Springsteen's latest tour, his first in four years, also features a new 
band that has occasionally been criticized as not up to par with his 
previous E Street Band. Springsteen said he's heard the criticisms, but 
doesn't buy them.<br>
"The E Street Band was one of the best bands in the world," he said. 
"I've known some of those guys for 20 years. They're just a great, great
 band. I've loved all those guys. I couldn't ask for better musicians. 
But I'm very confident in every player I have onstage now. It's a good 
band."<br>
Springsteen said he was looking for something different in his new band,
 a young unit that stars guitarist Shane Fontayne (formerly of Lone 
Justice) and drummer Zachary Alford (formerly of the B-52's). The only E
 Street holdover is keyboardist Roy Bittan.<br>
"I want to push the edges out a little bit," he explained about the new 
band. "I want to maintain the richness and sound and color of the past, 
and maintain the R &amp; B feel. But I want more gospel and a 
harder-edged, guitar-driven sound. And really, I think we're just 
scraping the surface so far."<br>
As for the future, Springsteen said he hopes to play New England again 
before the tour ends. He also hopes to shorten his tours, but do more of
 them, as his career continues. "I've been out on tours for a year, but 
that's too long," he said. "I also want to get more albums out. I'm 
looking for a steadier beat overall."</div>

By MARTHA WAGGONER<br>
— May. 7, 2014 </strong><br>
<br>
Associated Press<br>
<br>
<br>
RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Bruce Springsteen wasn't thinking about Wendy when 
he wrote a first draft of his 1975 classic "Born to Run." Instead, he's 
got a gold Chevy 6 on his mind, according to the original lyrics, which 
make their public debut this week at Duke University.<br>
<br>
The 30 lines of lyrics, written in pen on a piece of 8.5.-by-11-inch 
lined paper, were purchased last December at a Sotheby's auction by 
Floyd Bradley, a California man whose daughter graduates this weekend 
from Duke, as does Springsteen's daughter.<br>
<br>
Bradley, 62, a retired computer software marketer who spent much of his 
life in London, paid $160,000 plus a commission, bringing the total to 
$197,000. "It was a lot. I was embarrassed to tell my children," he 
said. "But they were very supportive after I told them."<br>
<br>
He bought them as an investment, he said. "It's a piece of Americana, I think."<br>
<br>
The original lyrics, written in 1974, in Long Branch, New Jersey, bear 
little resemblance to the anthem that Springsteen typically plays each 
concert with the house lights on and the audience on its feet. But that 
familiar chorus of "tramps like us/baby we were born to run" is there as
 is a part that ended up much like the final version: "this town'll rip 
the bones from your back/it's A suicide trap/your dead unless you get 
out while your young."<br>
<br>
The "everlasting kiss" is there: "I was headin for the place where wild Angels die in An everlasting (or) neverending kiss."<br>
<br>
But there's no mention of dying with Wendy during that kiss or of 
guarding Wendy's dreams and visions. Instead, Springsteen "looked out 
cross my hood + saw the highway buckle neath the wheels of A gold Chevy 
6." The car got a second mention a few lines down: "Baby out there 
heroes are crushed to death behind the wheels of a gold Chevy 6."<br>
<br>
In the margins, he's written words such as "wild angels," ''Stroll on!" and "the rebels."<br>
<br>
"Something as iconic as this song, it's going to be important to 
American history," said Duke University exhibit librarian Meg Brown, who
 found 25 books about Springsteen, mostly academic, in Duke's 
collections. "It came in at a time with a lot of change in American 
history and it made a significant difference."<br>
<br>
Bradley's life has intersected with Springsteen's at times. His mother, 
Carol, lived beside Springsteen's mother, Adele. When the family sold 
Carol Bradley's house, Springsteen bought it for his mother-in-law. And 
Bradley met Springsteen once when he took something to Adele Springsteen
 and she invited him to meet her son, who was visiting.<br>
<br>
Carol Bradley also wrote and sang a song titled "The Big 50" for 
Springsteen's 50th birthday, and Springsteen played the recording of 
Carol Bradley singing the song at a concert in Philadelphia in 1999.<br>
<br>
Bradley's daughter, Melissa, graduates this weekend from Duke as does 
Jessica Springsteen. He hasn't reached out to Springsteen to set up a 
meeting, however. "But I might bump into him ..." Bradley said.<br>
<br>
The lyrics will be displayed starting Thursday and continuing through 
Saturday at the Perkins Library. Then the sheet will move to the David 
M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library at Perkins from May 12 
to June 27.</div>

 May 7, 2014 | By Craig Hlavaty<br>
HOUSTON CHRONICLE</strong><br>
<br>
The reason that Tuesday night’s Bruce Springsteen show was so special 
wasn’t actually revealed until after the E Street Band took their bows 
and left the stage after a rip-roaring 28-song set. Springsteen then 
found himself by his sweaty lonesome onstage, just a man and a 
harmonica.<br>
<br>
He told the tale of when he and the band were just babes touring the 
land, a freshly signed record contract in their back pockets, the ink 
not even dry. They had all discovered they hated flying on airplanes 
after a traumatic East to West Coast flight and so all made a pact that 
they would from then on take trains from gig to gig. That didn’t last 
long as the band became a worldwide sensation and well, you can’t take a
 train to Europe or Australia. The logistics and all.<br>
<br>
The band had a four-night run of shows at the Liberty Hall here in 
Houston to play in March 1974, and thus booked a train trip from New 
York to Houston. Obviously it took longer than expected, Springsteen 
told us, and an unseasonably warm March didn’t help matters.<br>
<br>
But Houston embraced the band, Springsteen said, one still sweaty and delirious from a train for four days.<br>
<br>
“Houston took us to heart right from the beginning,” he grinned, 
strumming the first few flourishes of “Thunder Road” from 1975′s Born To
 Run.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band played the Cynthia Woods 
Mitchell Pavilion on Tuesday night for the first time in the venue’s 
nearly 25 years of hosting concerts. Springsteen’s traveling show turned
 in a set, clocking in at just over three hours, that veered from power 
pop nostalgia, Jersey grime, to fits of foot-stomping hallelujah that 
made the trees surrounding the venue rumble to drummer Max Weinberg’s 
stern beat. Having now fully installed ’90s guitar pedal god Tom Morello
 into the band’s front line, they are louder than you remember, too. The
 band’s visit last weekend to The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival
 seemed to have also stayed on their clothes, as they were injecting 
plenty of that city’s rhythm into the set list.<br>
<br>
This was also Springsteen’s first Houston visit since an April 2009 
Toyota Center date touring behind that year’s middling, but charming, 
Working On A Dream album.  The Springsteen apparatus only got as close 
as Austin during the SXSW promo push for 2012′s Wrecking Ball, so the 
Bayou City was long overdue for a holy rollin’ Boss revival session.<br>
<br>
His newest release, High Hopes, is a grab bag of covers, re-imagined 
live nuggets, and songs that didn’t make it onto the last few 
full-length offerings. It’s not an album of misfit toys, that much is 
for sure. Two cuts from that album cuts made the set list on Tuesday 
night.<br>
<br>
Tuesday night’s show was wildly fan-interactive from start to finish, 
from Springsteen and company tearing into songs that fans in the pit in 
front of the stage had requested on homemade poster boards, to pulling 
up not one, but three people onstage to dance or sing with the band. A 
man wrote on poster board that he had “busted his brother out of class” 
to sing “No Surrender” and within seconds of Springsteen reading that, 
he and his younger brother were doing just that. The pair flanked 
Springsteen and shared a microphone with him, nervous joy enveloping 
them. One woman got to briefly reenact the music video for “Dancing In 
The Dark” with Springsteen too.<br>
<br>
A great deal of Tuesday night’s set list came from those request boards 
too. “One Step Up”, from 1987′s Tunnel Of Love, was played live for the 
first time with the full band since a 1988 tour. It had been a part of 
subsequent solo acoustic shows though.<br>
<br>
“Damn, how many people here weren’t even born in 1988?” Springsteen 
cracked. The raunchy Human Touch cut “All or Nothin’ at All” got its 
tour premiere Tuesday night as well. The band seems to have more footing
 now when it comes to material from 2012′s Wrecking Ball, with songs 
like “Shackled and Drawn,” “Death to My Hometown” and the title track 
not as awkward as they once were. Too bad Springsteen didn’t dedicate 
“Wrecking Ball” to the Astrodome, as the lyrics are pretty apt for the 
old concrete gal.<br>
<br>
The band’s sonics change on each tour cycle, as die-hards can attest to 
from years of poring over bootlegs, and right now the band is a 
sneering, boisterous gaggle of energy. Late ’80s chestnut “Light Of Day”
 — which Springsteen wrote for a Michael J. Fox and Joan Jett flick — 
began with a perverse guitar solo from The Boss seemed to have blew a 
hot breeze into the pavilion. “The Ghost of Tom Joad” featured guitarist
 Morello and Springsteen trading lines and licks, and Morello amply 
proving that he was the best thing to come out of Rage Against The 
Machine, besides all those cool jock jams. He’s been filling in for 
Steven Van Zandt a lot lately, but it would be travesty if Morello 
didn’t stick around and become a full-time member. He adds a fire under 
the group that was greatly needed, as if guitarist Nils Lofgren wasn’t 
already enough.<br>
<br>
Texas guitar slinger Joe Ely arrived during the encore to crank out 
“Great Balls of Fire” and “Lucille” with the band, and wouldn’t you know
 it, Springsteen also has downloaded Little Richard’s voice into that 
astonishing brain housing group of his.<br>
<br>
This was also the band’s first time in town sans late saxophonist 
Clarence Clemons, whose nephew Jake Clemons has taken up his uncle’s 
spot in the E Street gang. “Come on Jake!” was a constant cry from 
Springsteen, calling Clemons into the spotlight to grease up the track. 
He even has his uncle’s mannerisms and wail down for “Tenth Avenue 
Freeze-Out,” which is now more or less a five-minute rapturous ode to 
the fallen Big Man.<br>
<br>
Once again, as he does in most every city he tours, Springsteen made 
sure that a local food pantry got some love at the show. A Houston Food 
Bank employee said late Tuesday evening that Springsteen’s tour had set 
aside an amount of concert tickets for last night’s show to be part of a
 silent auction, with proceeds going to the bank. In addition, Houston 
Food Bank staff were in the concession areas taking up donations.<br>

The Albany Times Union<br>
<br>
By Greg Haymes<br>
 Thursday, May 15, 2014</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Roaring into the Times Union Center on Tuesday night after a weeklong 
hiatus, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band headed back into their 
High Hopes tour recharged and rocking hard, opening with a cover of 
INXS' "Don't Change."<br>
They tore nonstop through another half dozen tunes before Springsteen 
had a chance to catch his breath and welcome the sold-out crowd.<br>
Since making his Capital Region debut at Union College 40 years ago, 
Springsteen's calling card has been the arena-rock anthem, a rousing 
call-to-action that's guaranteed to get the crowd out of their seats and
 onto their feet.<br>
The anthems still ring true, but there's really no need for him to pour out the boundless energy that he did on Tuesday.<br>
The crowd was with him from the start, and the show was particularly 
interactive, as he plucked fans out of the audience four times to dance 
with him on stage. "This is a serious night of audience participation," 
he told the crowd, "What's got into you?"<br>
One of the most cinematic storytellers of the rock era, Springsteen's lyrics are awash in both detail and atmosphere.<br>
Mixing politics and poetry into his riveting narratives, he's perhaps the best U.S. musical historian of the past half-century.<br>
And whether it was the Depression-era Dust Bowl (cribbed equally from 
Woody Guthrie and John Steinbeck in "The Ghost of Tom Joad"), the 
Vietnam War (the solemn "The Wall," his most personal song of the night)
 or the still-open wound of the 9/11 terrorist attacks ("The Rising"), 
Springsteen made America's tragedies deeply personal, and yet somehow 
hopeful.<br>
An hour into the nearly three-hour show, the sweat-soaked Springsteen 
testified, "Are you ready to be transformed, Albany?" And indeed, it was
 a transformative performance, the 17-piece band pumping through the 
hits ("Born in the USA," "Born to Run" and "Dancing in the Dark" as a 
string of encores), album tracks ("This Is Your Sword" and "Better Days"
 were standouts), a choice selection of covers (notably Roy Head's '60s 
soul nugget "Treat Her Right" and a rousing, almost Dixieland version of
 the Bee Gees' "Stayin' Alive") and the iconic "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out"
 (as a tribute to the late saxman Clarence Clemons).<br>
Springsteen is undeniably the architect, but the E Street Band – 
inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame just last month – has 
always been the rock-solid foundation around which the songs are built, 
much in the same way that Duke Ellington wrote songs with his specific 
band members in mind. And while numerous band members have fallen by the
 wayside over the years — these days, bassist Garry Tallent is the only 
remaining original member – the sheer sonic force and the inherent drama
 of the band is still intact.<br>
Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello (filling Steve Van 
Zandt's slot while he's off filming his Netflix series "Lilyhammer") is a
 powerful addition to the band, especially on his duet with Springsteen 
on "The Ghost of Tom Joad," brimming over with defiance and 
electro-shock guitar.<br>
After ripping through "Treat Her Right," Springsteen just shook his head
 and said, "The song has magic in it. Magic, I tell you." And the same 
goes for the rest of the performance, too.<br>
