Winner of the 2013 Parnelli Lifetime Achievement Award<br>
Written by Kevin M. Mitchell<br>
Friday, 18 October 2013 15:12</strong><br>
<br>
“You end up being part of this little touring group that can be a tight,
 dysfunctional family that shares one goal: putting on a good show,” he 
says. “We have to remember that when the music starts, we have 8,000 to 
80,000 bosses who are the audience. The biggest excitement in this 
business is when the concert starts. Then you have your immediate 
reward… or you can also have your immediate judgment!”<br>
<br>
Well, one judgment is in — and this year’s Parnelli Lifetime Achievement
 honoree is one of the most respected and beloved in the business. 
Travis may fly high in the esteem of his colleagues, yet he likes to fly
 below the radar, so it’ll be a rare sight when on Nov. 23, at the 
Mirage in Las Vegas, at a gathering of live event industry 
professionals, he steps on stage to receive the 13th Parnelli Lifetime 
Achievement Award.<br>
<br>
A key member of the Bruce Springsteen team since 1978, Travis has also 
worked over the years for acts including Elvis, Rod Stewart, Queen, 
Kiss, Boston, Elton John, Madonna, Shania Twain and Ringo Starr. He’s 
been part of some of the industry’s most audacious events in music, 
including two US Festivals, the 1988 Amnesty International tour 
promoting human rights and the recent 12-12-12 concert for Sandy relief.
 Perhaps most importantly and least known is his passion and energy for 
his charity and philanthropic work, where he’s been just as efficacious 
as his day job.<br>
<br>
“Bruce [Springsteen] wants a certain atmosphere, knows what he is 
looking for, and wants people who can make it better,” says 
producer/manager Jon Landau. “George can run the tour without friction 
or drama. We’re not interested in production egos. We have a team model.
 If you come backstage, from load-in to load-out, there’s nothing but 
positive energy. George is a master of delivering that mandate every 
night.”<br>
<br>
Early in his career, Travis started a long working relationship with 
Mike Brown. “There aren’t enough superlatives in the world to describe 
his energy and work ethic,” says Brown, who is retired from the 
grandstand and staging business. “He might just be the best professional
 I’ve ever worked with.” (It was Travis who presented Brown with his 
Lifetime Achievement Award, the second one given, in 2002.)<br>
<br>
“Working with George has been life-changing for me, no exaggeration,” 
says lighting designer Jeff Ravitz. “Here’s why: From Elvis to the 
famous Michael Jackson Pepsi commercial to Bruce, George has pretty much
 done it all in our business… he’s been a stagehand, a truck driver, 
rigger, production manager and even lighting operator. So when he puts 
together a tour, he does it at a deep level of understanding of what it 
takes.<br>
<br>
“I’ve seen the gears in his head turn as he strives to solve problems on
 a production, technical, logistic or human resources level. He is 
imaginative, analytical, and is a ‘let’s get this situation taken care 
of now’ kind of guy.” Ravitz adds he’s a adopted a “What Would George 
Do?” philosophy in his own approach to problem solving. “If you break 
things down so the people come first, the nuts and bolts will begin to 
fall into place.”<br>
<br>
“If you do right by him, he’s loyal,” says David Bernstein of Rock-It 
Cargo. “He and Jon [Landau] have built such an amazing, stable 
organization. They work together well and they have created a well-oiled
 machine.”<br>
<br>
Travis is not in the business of taking compliments, and with a shrug he
 states: “What’s fortunate in working with Bruce and Jon is the constant
 confidence I get from them in hiring the best guys and working with the
 best tools. From who is working security on the back door to FOH, you 
get everyone focused on realizing it’s about the show.”<br>
<br>
The Second Generation<br>
<br>
George Travis was born in 1951 in upstate New York. “Like so many people
 I fell into this line of work,” he says. “I didn’t try to get into 
‘this business’ because in the mid 1970’s, it wasn’t even a ‘business.’”<br>
<br>
His first gig was in 1974 when he got a job at the Capital Centre arena 
in suburban Washington D.C. In those heady days, different positions 
were emerging and there was turnover, and if somebody wasn’t there to do
 something, “you became ‘the guy’,” Travis tells. He dabbled in 
lighting, and then got involved with rigging on the 1975 Rolling Stones 
tour.<br>
<br>
It was The Stones’ watershed “Tour of the Americas” that proved to be a 
virtual petri dish of talent, most who would be recognized as the 
founding fathers of the live event industry. Here, Travis met Michael 
Ahern, Patrick Stansfield, Roy Bickel, Joe Branam, Mike Grassley, Roy 
Lamb and Brian Croft — among many others. “Those were the real guys, the
 first generation. It felt like elementary school, with me as the second
 grader looking up to the fourth graders.”<br>
<br>
Travis proved himself, and became a sought-after hired gun working for 
the likes of Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, Boz Skaggs, The Beach Boys and 
Chicago. He also worked for Elvis Presley alongside the late Bruce 
Jackson, a Parnelli Audio Innovator honoree and long-time Springsteen 
FOH engineer. Another learning experience was doing some projects with 
Chip Monck, another Parnelli Lifetime Achievement honoree, when Monck 
was also involved in Mike Brown projects.<br>
<br>
At the time, Travis says, he didn’t know where it was going, let alone 
that it would be a “career.” “Like so many other guys in the beginning, 
you’re doing it because it was work, and the alternative was getting a 
real job,” he says. “But I loved traveling, rigging and the 
independence. I loved listening to the older guys too, as they told war 
stories of earlier tours. Guys like Patrick [Stansfield] had been around
 the world, and I could listen to those old war stories forever.”<br>
<br>
He would be among the many to be influenced by another Parnelli honoree,
 production manager Gerry Stickells. Travis worked with Stickells and 
stage manager Nick Pitts for big 1970s-era tours with Elton John and 
Queen. “Gerry is the model of what people in this profession should be 
like,” Travis says. “Personally, he was a gentlemen. He was the 
top-shelf definition of a professional.”<br>
<br>
In his travels , Travis met future wife Lenore (nee Gessner) when she 
was working at Tom Fields Associates. “She would pay zero attention to 
me because I was just the guy driving the Clair Brothers truck to Elton 
John’s show in Buffalo,” he says. “Then we met again later when I was 
rigging, and then again when I was in production. When we first married,
 I was known by many as the guy who married Lenore!”<br>
<br>
Married 31 years, George credits Lenore for… well, everything. “I would 
not be who I am without her,” he says. “I’m also lucky she totally 
understands the business, and sometimes I have to take the day to sleep.
 When she tells me, ‘it’s time to get some sleep,’ I know I better. I’ve
 been really lucky with my home life.”<br>
<br>
Next was work with bigger and more complex rigging gigs with acts like 
Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer and Kiss. Then there was a career-changing 
gig: Springsteen’s Darkness at the Edge of Town tour.<br>
<br>
Life with Bruce<br>
<br>
Jon Landau’s history with Springsteen started in 1978 when the former 
journalist/record producer was asked by Springsteen to manage him. “So 
now I’m suddenly his manager, and I flew out to wherever his tour was at
 the moment,” he says. Once there he walked around talking to 
crewmembers trying to get a sense of it all. He approached a rigger 
named George Travis and struck up a conversation. Travis asked Landau if
 he was going to be manager. When Landau answered in the affirmative, 
Travis said, “Well, I have a few suggestions, if you want to hear 
‘em...”<br>
<br>
Travis proceeded to share his view of things. Landau was impressed. “I 
thought, ‘I like this guy’ — and that was the beginning of our 
friendship.” Landau adds that Travis taught him a lot about life on the 
road in those early days.<br>
<br>
And it was on that Darkness at the Edge of Town tour where Springsteen 
told Landau he wanted to replace the production manager. Landau put 
Travis in that position, and soon it was Travis’ turn to learn from 
Landau.<br>
<br>
“One of George’s many mottos is, ‘If you want it done right, do it 
yourself,’” Landau laughs. “But I tried to teach him to be an executive,
 to delegate.” In 1980 on The River tour, Landau showed up to a load-in 
and witnessed Travis hammering on the set, “having a great ol’ time. I 
told him if he wanted to be a carpenter, he should be a carpenter — it’s
 a great profession. But if he wants to be a production manager, he 
needs to have a bigger vision.”<br>
<br>
David Bernstein of Rock-It Cargo has had a long professional and 
personal relationship with Travis going back to when Travis was 
transitioning from rigging/doing-it-all to production manager. Bernstein
 recalls Landau yelling at him to stop rigging, saying, “George, I want 
you to stay alive!” “Left to his own devices, he’d be like [the 
musician] Prince, and be playing all the instruments,” Bernstein says. 
“That he’s done everything — rigging, staging, lighting, driving the 
truck — is what’s given him such a broad depth of production.”<br>
<br>
James “Winky” Fairorth was 19 when he first met Travis, when Springsteen
 came to Tait Towers to rehearse for the 1986 tour. “We were pioneering a
 dimmer built into the truss, and Bruce was our first account,” says the
 Tait Towers president. “I was lucky enough to become the 
runner/spotlight operator for that tour.”<br>
<br>
Travis is “amazing,” Fairorth adds. “Not many groups have an artist like
 George running things, and he has earned the freedom to make the 
decisions. Having said that, he has a great crew who supports him, and 
he gets incredible loyalty back from them. He tries to keep them working
 even when Bruce isn’t on tour,” which keeps the team together.<br>
<br>
Thom Zimny has been documenting Springsteen’s concert performances and 
filming his music videos since 2001. “George understands the filmmaking 
side, just like he understands the road,” Zimny says. Travis was an 
early advocate for High Definition video, he adds, and Springsteen was 
one of the first to use it in concert.<br>
<br>
Zimny laughs when recalling Travis’ resourcefulness: “I’ll be standing 
there in the middle of a shoot and say something like, ‘Wouldn’t it be 
great if that wall didn’t have X, Y, and Z on it,’ and George will say 
he was thinking the same thing, and next thing I know, it’s gone!<br>
<br>
“He’s the kind of guy who is covering a million different details, like 
the lighting and staging, and someone will come up about a ticketing 
situation where seats need to be arranged to accommodate the disabled, 
and he just sees exactly what needs to happen,” Zimny adds. “No pad, 
pencil — it’s all in his head. He makes the shows flawless.”<br>
<br>
Brian Murphy, longtime concert promoter, formerly with Live Nation and 
currently with AEG’s Goldenvoice, first met Travis when both were 
working with Rod Stewart’s Faces tour. In the 1980’s, he would work with
 Springsteen.<br>
<br>
“He has a single-minded focus — if Bruce has a good show, fans have a 
great time,” says Murphy. “Whatever he needs to do to make sure the fans
 have a good time is the most important thing he and his team can do for
 Bruce.”<br>
<br>
One of his favorite stories involves Springsteen’s stance against 
scalpers. Murphy and Travis worked to make sure the ticket companies 
were on the up-and-up, and Murphy would even send his wife Judy 
undercover to buy tickets. If she got good seats, they knew the ticket 
company wasn’t putting them in the hands of scalpers. On the night of 
the show, Travis and Murphy would walk outside the arena and approach a 
group of depressed-looking fans. “We’d walk up to some, nonchalantly, 
listen to their story of how they couldn’t get tickets, and then present
 them with great seats. It was a blast! We both had fun making their 
night.”<br>
<br>
Stories of a show going off the rails are few and rare, though Landau 
has one he likes to tell: In 2003 while on The Rising tour in Australia,
 Springsteen got on stage while he and Travis sat down to eat in the 
catering tent. “After about five songs, I noticed I didn’t hear any 
music, and thought that was a little weird,” Landau laughs. “So we 
charge off and see Bruce on stage with just a little bit of lighting and
 nothing else.” A faulty generator was switched out and, after 25 
minutes, Springsteen and band starts back on “Badlands,” only to have 
the second generator fail. “It went out with a boom, and I’m standing 
there, wondering how fast I can get a flight back to New York!” Travis 
went to work getting a third generator in place. Some 40 minutes later, 
Springsteen started back up, rallied the crowd, and the show ended on a 
typical high note.<br>
<br>
“So George and I are standing on the side of the stage, because if Bruce
 wanted to hit someone, I wanted it to be George,” Landau half-jokes. 
“Bruce comes off stage grinning ear to ear and says, ‘Guys, I just want 
to hear one thing: That this will never happen again!’” Travis launched 
into giving reasons of the why, and Landau stopped him in mid-sentence 
and said, “Bruce, this will never happen again!”<br>
<br>
“I’ll never live that down,” Travis says.<br>
<br>
Other Adventures<br>
<br>
Travis’ work with Bill Graham Presents is legendary, particularly the 
1982 US Festival that featured more than 50 top acts including The 
Police, Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, Fleetwood Mac, Van Halen, 
David Bowie and Willie Nelson. It had the tallest LED screen at the 
time, measuring 100 feet high.<br>
<br>
Mike Brown was there for the US Festivals. “George was good at making 
sure that vendors did what they said they were going to do. He has great
 expertise in rigging, and a great grasp of the overall picture. He 
would know just by looking at something what might go wrong and prevent 
it from going amiss.”<br>
<br>
Another of the remarkable feats Travis pulled off involved the 20-show 
Human Rights Now tour raising awareness for Amnesty International in 
1988. The world tour featured Springsteen and the E Street Band, Sting, 
Peter Gabriel, Tracy Chapman, Youssou N’Dour and many special guests. 
“We played Japan, India, Africa, South America, North America, Europe,” 
Landau says. The logistical challenges for supporting those shows with 
crew and gear were enormous, and Landau notes that when all the band’s 
heads came together, they all looked to Travis to be the leader of the 
leaders.<br>
<br>
Moving the production from Tokyo to New Delhi and all the other tour 
stops had their challenges, but one move was seemingly impossible. After
 the Oct. 12 show in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the next stop was Mendoza, 
Argentina on Oct. 14. The town of 100,000 is remote, but it was chosen 
for its proximity to Santiago, Chile which, at the time was known for 
flagrant human rights violations. The artists wanted to show their 
support for the people there.<br>
<br>
“The initial idea was that we’d take a smaller portion of the gear up 
and do a semi-acoustic show,” Landau recalls. But Sting’s and Gabriel’s 
people said they really need their whole show. Travis got it all there. 
“When our buses were pulling up, we were literally surrounded by the 
widows and their children whose father’s had perished under [Chilean 
dictator] Pinochet. It was a highlight of the tour, and we were all 
grateful when we realized how important it was to do the whole show for 
that audience.”<br>
<br>
Travis says dealing with the political and production challenge of each 
country was the biggest part of it. “We had trying days,” he admits, 
“but it was an amazing group to work with, and it’s one of my proudest 
achievements.”<br>
<br>
Even after all these years, Landau doesn’t cease to be impressed with 
Travis’ ability to make things happen. Last year, Springsteen wanted to 
be part of 12-12-12 concert in New York City to raise funds for those 
affected by Hurricane Sandy, but they were playing on Dec. 10 in Mexico 
City. Landau says he called Travis, and asked if could get the crew, the
 band and all the gear from there to New York in what was essentially 
about 40 hours. Travis paused briefly before saying, “it’ll be fine — 
don’t worry about it.”<br>
<br>
Speaking of 12-12-12, Bernstein tells of sharing a ride with him and 
seeing him stop and pick up dry cleaning to bring to wardrobe — “Nothing
 is beneath him,” Bernstein says. “He’ll do anything that needs to be 
done.”<br>
<br>
Staying Busy<br>
<br>
Mike Brown is the many who notes that they have never seen Travis get 
rattled. “He never overreacts. He receives the problem, turns it around 
in his mind, and then some sort of solution comes out.”<br>
<br>
Joanne Bischmann, VP of Communications at Harley-Davidson, agrees. 
“George Travis just solves problems,” she says. “He wants everything he 
does to be perfect, and he puts up the best product for everyone.”<br>
<br>
For the motorcycle company’s 100th anniversary in 2003, “we wanted to 
take the anniversary to the people,” Bischmann adds. “We had this vision
 to celebrate our history with music, and took it on the road to 10 
cities around the world.”<br>
<br>
As the planning involved huge exhibits and live music, “it started 
looking a lot like a concert tour,” she notes, with acts including Bob 
Dylan, Alison Krause, Aerosmith and Tim McGraw touring the racetracks of
 the world, with each stop involving two performance stages and a 
half-dozen tents for museum-quality exhibits plus tons of retail.<br>
<br>
“From the second we met I knew George was the perfect person” for that, 
Bischmann says. And with Travis came his entire team. “They were all one
 big family, and quickly figured out how to transport it, set it up, 
tear it down, and they made it all go like clockwork..”<br>
<br>
Last of the Cowboys<br>
<br>
“Travis is innately mechanical — he would have been one helluva 
handyman!” Bernstein laughs. “He’s got the skills of a mechanical 
engineer, and physical and intellectual dexterity. And he’s got great 
business sense. He’s able to size up a situation like only a great 
leader can.”<br>
<br>
Travis deflects kudos to his team. “I might have a bit of cowboy 
stubbornness, and I can comfortably say I have a circle of people with 
me that can take anything someone throws at them,” he says. “If we need 
to be somewhere in middle Europe tomorrow, they will be there. We have 
the resources, and they know how to use them. It’s a different 
generation, and now, we could be the last of the cowboys,” he adds. “But
 there is a great group of young people coming in to our world now with 
even higher standards, bringing new and exciting concepts to the table. 
Our business will always be a forefront of new technology.”<br>
<br>
“George has a calmness about him, a clear and firm way of conducting 
himself,” Landau says. “I’ve never heard him raise his voice. He wins 
people over with his professionalism. He’s got the skills to be running 
Fortune 500 companies.”<br>
<br>
Fairorth also notes Travis’ even-keel personality. “We expect disaster 
[in this business], and what will go wrong will go wrong, so there’s a 
lot of anticipating what will go wrong. We’re basically selling 
prototypes in this industry, so you can’t expect things to work right 
away. Even with the last tour, he sent things back three or four times, 
yet he never yells at me! [Laughs] … and I’ve probably given him plenty 
of opportunity!”<br>
<br>
Bernstein agrees, noting it’s incredibly rare to see Travis angry. “It drives me crazy — I wish I had that temperament!”<br>
<br>
“I’m constantly laughing all the time with him,” Fairorth adds. “We’re 
always laughing about something. As serious as we have to take things, 
how serious can you [really] take it? At the end of the day, when your 
phone lights up and you see its George, you smile because it’s a 
pleasure to take the call.”<br>
<br>
Travis says of the Parnelli Honor: “There’s a long list of people who should be getting this way before me.”<br>
<br>
But many disagree. “Honestly, I’m surprised it hasn’t happened before 
now,” says Murphy. “George is four notches above us all. He is world 
class, and everyone else is somewhere below that.” Landau piles on as 
well: “With all due respect to those before and those who come after in 
this award, what took you guys so long? Well you got the right guy now.”<br>
<br>
George Travis will be honored at the Parnelli Awards gala Nov. 23 at the
 Mirage Las Vegas. To reserve your seat (or table), go to <a href="http://www.parnelliawards.com/reservations" class="postlink">www.parnelliawards.com/reservations</a>.</div>

Burlington Free Press<br>
November 5, 1978<br>
By Charles Frazier<br>
Special to the Free Press<br>
<br>
Four years was a long time to wait for his return to Burlington, but 
perhaps the line he emphasized from “Rosalita” summed it up best. “I 
ain’t here on business, I’m only here for fun.” For fun is all everyone 
in attendance had at a packed Patrick Gymnasium Saturday night as “the 
Boss”, Bruce Springsteen with his E Street Band totally electrified 
everyone with their exuberance and manic energy.<br>
<br>
Springsteen bounced, prowled, jumped and crooned his way through two 
sets of his tunes, without a hint of self glorifying pretentiousness. 
Though he mainly focused on his last two Columbia albums, “Born to Run” 
and “Darkness on the Edge of Town” he also featured three new tunes, 
“Ties That Bind”, “Independence Day” and “Point Blank”. Springsteen 
joked that they would hopefully be on an album “by the summer of 1984” 
in reference to his just ended long time long legal battle with his 
former manager Mike Appel.<br>
<br>
The dispute was a financial hardship for Springsteen who lost touch with
 his audience and left a gap of several year between album releases. He 
later thanked the crowd for bearing with the band during those trying 
times and he showed through his music that he’s back and promises to 
make up for lost time.<br>
<br>
After being hailed as “the new Dylan” and seeing his face splashed on 
simultaneously across the covers of Time and Newsweek, Springsteen has 
had a lot to live up to. And he has weathered it well, for his latest 
album and new songs clearly bring out the pain he has endured without 
evoking pity, for he knows everyone’s been through the same joys and 
sadness in love, life and music.<br>
<br>
On his new songs and old ones like “Backstreets”, “Racin’ in the 
Streets” and “Darkness on the Edge of Town”, Springsteen countered his 
rock energy with sensitive singing and images of cars, darkness and 
unfulfilled love. His voice was gruff and from the bottom of his heart, 
though the words were undermixed all evening in the P.A., drowned out as
 the organ and guitars became excessively loud at times.<br>
<br>
Currently winding up an exhaustive tour which began in the U.S. in May 
and has since crossed the country and Europe. Springsteen should have 
been tired but if he was he showed no sign of it. He was determined to 
bring as many people as possible into the show to share its excitement 
with them.<br>
<br>
To do this he made repeated forays to the edge of and into the crowd, at
 one time being held aloft by the crowd six rows back as he sang a 
soulful refrain of “Sprit in the Night” . He prowled the stage from high
 behind the drummer to atop the piano and several times offered his 
microphone to the crowd urging them to sing the lines for some of 
“Thunder Road”, “She’s the One”, and “Rosalita”. The crowd happily 
consented to anything he offered or asked them.<br>
<br>
Springsteen stunned the crowd with his stinging guitar playing and solos
 something he is not given due credit for, most notably on “Prove it all
 Night” and “Badlands”. Clarence “Big Man” Clemens was Springsteen’s 
alter ego on the saxophone, dressed in white as opposed to Bruce’s 
black. He played with controlled energy all evening proving the perfect 
counterpart to Bruce’s visual dynamics. He especially shined in his 
solos on “Sprit in the Night” and “Rosalita” whirling in circles as he 
blew his heart out. At one time during “Rosalita” Springsteen and 
Clemens crossed the stage in a mock duel between saxophone and guitar 
until they met at center stage foreheads and noses pressed together 
until Bruce broke it off with a kiss urging the crowd to shout louder 
“so they can hear you in New Jersey”.<br>
<br>
Called back for three encores, Springsteen fed everyone a diet of rock 
and roll. “Born to Run” was first followed by a medley of “Jenny With 
The Blue Dress On”, “Good Golly Miss Molly” and “C C Rider”. “Dancin Til
 Quarter to Three” closed the show as Springsteen mockingly implored the
 crowd “Somebody stop me before I hurt myself”.<br>
<br>
His questions of “Had enough yet” or “Ain’t you tired yet?” brought 
emphatic NO’s from the crowd. After one more chorus he explained “I’m 
just a prisoner of rock and roll” and with that he jumped atop the P.A. 
took off his jacket and shirt and danced off stage. He left a lot of 
drained “prisoners” in the audience all truly glad for the three hour 
“escape” he had provided.</div>

<br>
Blessing or curse?<br>
<br>
 Bruce Springsteen is now the subject of a theology course .mAt Rutgers 
University in New Jersey students will examine how the singer 'recasts 
biblical stories into the American landscape'<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen's lyrics refer more commonly to the Old Testament than the New, with redemption a dominant motif. <br>
As befits a singer whose fans greet him with religious fervour, whose 
songs often contain references to faith – and many of whose female 
characters are called Mary – Bruce Springsteen has become the subject of
 a theology course at Rutgers University in his home state of New 
Jersey.<br>
<br>
Professor Azzan Yadin-Israel, who teaches courses in early rabbinic 
literature in the department of Jewish studies, is to host a 
one-semester course on the theological underpinnings of Springsteen's 
lyrics, looking at how he has interpreted biblical texts in his work.<br>
<br>
"Interestingly, Springsteen refers more often to the stories of the 
Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament) than the New Testament," Yaddin-Israel 
told Rutgers Today. "On a literary level, Springsteen often recasts 
biblical figures and stories into the American landscape. The narrator 
of Adam Raised a Cain describes his strained relationship with his 
father through the prism of the biblical story of the first father and 
son; Apocalyptic storms accompany a boy's tortured transition into 
manhood in The Promised Land, and the first responders of 9/11 rise up 
to "someplace higher" in the flames, much as Elijah the prophet ascended
 in a chariot of fire (Into the Fire).<br>
<br>
"Theologically, I would say the most dominant motifs are redemption – 
crossing the desert and entering the Promised Land – and the sanctity of
 the everyday. Springsteen tries to drag the power of religious symbols 
that are usually relegated to some transcendent reality into our lived 
world. In his later albums he also writes very openly about faith."<br>
<br>
As Consequence of Sound notes, it not the first time Springsteen has 
popped up on a college syllabus. Princeton offered a course on Sociology
 from E Street: Bruce Springsteen's America, and other institutions have
 also given students the chance to study The Boss.</div>

Radio Interview - November 8th, 1978 - FM-CHOM <br>
Montreal.</strong><br>
<br>
---<br>
Bruce: Hi<br>
<br>
DJ: How ya doin' man?<br>
Bruce: Okay!<br>
<br>
DJ: We have the man himself on the line, Mr. Bruce Springsteen and I 
think the first thing that I should say Bruce, on behalf of Montreal, is
 uh, thanks for a dynamite show. It was like unreal. People have been 
coming here to the station, they've been ringing the door bell, they've 
been phoning me and telling me it's the best show they've heard in their
 life.<br>
Bruce: Wow, that's great (chuckles)<br>
<br>
DJ: How are things going for you? Are you pretty tired right now? You probably just got off stage a little while ago?<br>
Bruce: No, I feel good now. It was like, uh, it was really surprising 
'cause we hadn't been here in about uh, I guess 2 or 3 years, you know, 
it's been quite a while, and I remember it was nothing like this, you 
know (chuckles) and the crowd was just uh, they were just, you know, 
like uh, fantastic . . . <br>
<br>
DJ: Montreal loves you <br>
Bruce: . . . Epic uh, reception you know, and uh, we had a great time, 
you know. It was really uh, it was really surprising. It was really 
nice, you know.<br>
<br>
DJ: I know the last time you were here was uh, I think about 3 years 
ago. You played at Place des Artes to a very, very small crowd and 
you've come up in the world since then, a heck of a lot.<br>
Bruce: I guess the world, all we've known, it was like, uh, there was a 
lot of people there tonight, (?) be a lot, you know, and uh, it was 
really, I didn't know exactly what to expect, you know, 'cause we hadn't
 been up here too much, uh, we were up here for about 3 dates on that, I
 guess, '76 tour, you know, or '75 tour, and then we really haven't 
gotten up here, you know, too much again and uh, it was really uh, it 
was really a treat. It was really nice.<br>
<br>
DJ: Listen Bruce, I've got a question for you. What happened to Miami Steve? I don't think I found him on stage tonight. <br>
Bruce: Yeah, he was up there!<br>
<br>
DJ: He was up there?<br>
Bruce: (laughs) Yeah! (laughs)<br>
<br>
DJ: Because he . . . <br>
Bruce: He was the guy, uh, . . . <br>
<br>
DJ: With the hat on? . . . <br>
Bruce: Right, over to the left (laughs) . . . <br>
<br>
DJ: Okay . . . <br>
Bruce: You know, he was, he was there<br>
<br>
DJ: Clarence was in fine, fine form tonight<br>
Bruce: Yeah (still laughing) . . . <br>
<br>
DJ: As usual . . . <br>
Bruce: Yeah, yeah, everybody was uh, you know, it was sorta, uh, 
excited, you know, comin' in, you know, 'cause it's uh, it was a real 
nice town, it was a real nice city, like the last time we were here, we 
spent a few days, and uh, I really, I really liked it so, it was nice 
that it just, everything worked out so good, you know, and the audience 
was ... wild, it was really, really wild, wild response, it was uh, 
really exciting, you know<br>
<br>
DJ: I know, I caught the first part of the show. I caught about an hour 
and then I had to come here to go on the air but what I saw was 
dynamite. Um, I was gonna ask you something about your tour. When, you 
were, you were touring all summer. It was a real hectic tour from what I
 can understand and uh, then you took a bit of a break. What'd you do?<br>
Bruce: Well, let me see, what'd I do? I uh, went out west, a little bit,
 out towards Arizona and to California. I wrote a couple songs and then 
came back and rehearsed and went out. I only had about 3 weeks really, 
you know, to uh, fool around. It was funny because I never, traveled 
before without playing, you know, it was like, the first time I was 
ever, like, uh, away, you know, from New Jersey and stuff, without 
somebody knocking on the door and sayin', 'Alright, 5 minutes', you 
know, guy on the bus (chuckles) . . . <br>
<br>
DJ: Right . . . <br>
Bruce: So, I had a good time. It was okay. Didn't do too much, foolin' around<br>
<br>
DJ: What really impressed me in the first part of the concert, the part 
that I saw, was some of your new material, like a song called 
Independence Day. Blew me away.<br>
Bruce: Ah, thank, thank you. Yeah, I wrote that about uh, quite, a long 
time ago. It was funny, I wrote it before I wrote, like uh, a lot of the
 stuff that was on Darkness but, there just wasn't room, you know, there
 wasn't room for it, and we got a version that's recorded and everything
 of that song already. We'll probably do it again for the next album but
 uh, we've had that sittin' around so, we started, we're doing about 2 
or 3 new songs every night a set now. I want to try and (?), you know, 
get a little audience reaction before we go in and make the next album, 
you know, I haven't had a chance to ever do that. I usually end up 
writing in the studio and uh, and hustlin' down to the last wire, you 
know, the last minute. So, this time, I'm trying to write, while I'm on 
the road and get to play it, you know, and see how the people like the 
songs and stuff . . . So, I'm glad to hear you liked it<br>
<br>
DJ: Uh, it was dynamite, and uh, we wanna thank you. On behalf of 
everybody, hope you're gonna come back to town real soon. Are you 
staying for a while or are you splitting right away?<br>
Bruce: I'm going to stay tomorrow, as much as we can, we got a day off 
tomorrow and then we're flying out sometime tomorrow night, I think, so 
I'm gonna try uh, (? got brown), get in the daytime, so I can get up, 
you know . . . <br>
<br>
DJ: Sure . . . <br>
Bruce: (talking real low and can't make it out - think he's falling asleep) <br>
<br>
DJ: If you get a chance . . . <br>
Bruce: (picks up the volume) look around, shop around<br>
<br>
DJ: If you get a chance while you're shopping around . . . <br>
Bruce: (perks up, probably senses the favor about to be asked!) Nice talking to you there! (chuckles)<br>
<br>
DJ: Come on by CHOM, we'd love to see ya . . . <br>
Bruce: I'd like to go and to just thank uh, everybody that came down to 
the show, you know, for making it such uh, uh, good show, and uh, I 
really appreciate it, you know, 'cause we hadn't been up that much (a 
live Raise Your Hand starts playing), and it was really, uh, we just, it
 was just uh, really fantastic response. I'd just like to, just like to 
say thanks to everybody and see ya next time<br>
<br>
DJ: Thanks a lot Bruce. Bye-bye<br>
Bruce: Bye</div>

<br>
The 11.17.13 Evening with Max Weinberg<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
On Sunday night, November 17, 2013, for the benefit of the Middletown 
Arts Center, Max sat for a nearly two-hour long interview with Tom 
Cunningham of 105.7 The Hawk and Bruce Brunch, followed by his fielding 
audience questions and then a subsequent VIP meet and greet. This author
 was fortunate to experience all and it was an informative, intimate and
 entirely memorable night for sure.<br>
<br>
In attendance were: the Mayor of Middletown, Gerard P. Scharfenberger, 
PhD; his lovely wife and the President of the Middletown Township Arts 
Council, Geraldine “Gerry” Scharfenberger; Executive Director Maggie 
O’Brien and State Senator Joe Kyrillos of the 13th Legislative District 
and his son, Max, who Max Weinberg praised for his local young band, the
 Stone Bullets during the questions period.<br>
<br>
Rare Insights and Details<br>
<br>
Weinberg, trim and tanned, polished and poised, shared details with an 
audience of over 100 attendees. Some details had never before been 
revealed. One such revelation was that the E Street Band was indeed the 
band that played on the recording of not just Talk to Me but also Hearts
 of Stone on the seminal Jukes album Hearts of Stone. “Now it can be 
told!” Max proclaimed. Yet another few comments that made audience 
members gasp were that Prove It All Night was inspired by Abba songs 
like Dancing Queen and the band was listening to "alot of Barry White" 
for Candy's Room.<br>
<br>
Yet another not widely known detail was the previously unknown working 
song title Bodo Rocker (short for “Bo Diddley”), never released but 
known as Going Back. Max still has the tape and used to play it all the 
time for his wife, Becky. Max effusively described the roaring rocker as
 “one of the greatest things the E Street Band ever recorded and Garry 
Tallent, in particular, is a genius on this”. This song appeared to hold
 an even higher place in Max’s personal pantheon of favorite songs that 
he believed he had “nailed”, including Roulette, Candy’s Room, Ramrod 
and Born in the U.S.A. The rapt audience was treated to some drumming of
 the Roulette pattern on the arm of the chair as Max briefly 
demonstrated his well-known, rattle-gun drum pattern.<br>
<br>
Max also recalled the breathlessly swift second studio recording being 
the final take of the title track of Born in the USA, with an entire 
jamming sequence removed from the released version. He described a very 
organic and intuitive jam resulting from a barebones description by 
Bruce about what he wanted. One by one they wandered into the studio, 
first with the organ figure, then with Garry joining in and so on.<br>
<br>
Max further confirmed the E Street Band recorded an entire electric 
version of the Nebraska album in two weeks. He joked that Columbia 
Records really wanted a follow up to Hungry Heart and instead, “Bruce 
hands in an album with a title track about a serial killer!” The band 
had recorded great electric versions of all the album’s songs but Bruce 
thought the versions were too distant, in Bruce’s mind, because they 
lacked that critical intimacy that he described as the closeness that 
you only can get playing on a porch for another listener.<br>
<br>
Cramming a lifetime into two hours was a challenge but well done during 
the interview, which clearly he and Cunningham had worked on to have it 
slow smoothly.<br>
<br>
Married to Becky since 1981 for 37 years, powering Bruce’s E Street Band
 from 1974 until today with a ten year hiatus that was “incredibly 
important” to the band. Max led the Max Weinberg 7 for Conan for 17 
years.<br>
<br>
His power and force have been more than an anchor for the band; he’s 
been the engine for the E Street Band, propelling them since Born to 
Run, catapulting them into come-back ferocity in 1999 and bringing the 
power, “hour after hour” until this very day, with dates remaining in 
Australia, South Africa and concluding, said Max, in Auckland, New 
Zealand on March 2, 2014 – and then a break -- for now. No mention was 
made of the upcoming release of the new disc and rumored further dates.<br>
<br>
Right Now<br>
<br>
“We’ve done over 150 concerts with 5 more, we’ll stop for a bit”, Max 
began the interview. Although clearly fit and healthy, Max revealed that
 he has had 7 hand operations, 2 unsuccessful back operations, and a 
2010 open-heart procedure.<br>
<br>
Recently, while in Brazil on September 21st, playing the Rock in Rio 
Festival in Rio de Janeiro, Max read a few newspaper articles from back 
home that discussed describing his involvement with a local 
storm-damaged trail near his home. At the November 17th appearance, Max 
took the opportunity to set the record straight, providing a rich 
geographical history of the Atlantic Highlands, as well as a polished 
explanation of the law and facts behind the truth that no one was suing 
anyone and the community was simply worried about a precarious trail 
after two hurricanes. The stories skewed the story as Rock Star vs. 
County.<br>
<br>
Although he’s traveled around the world with Bruce, Max has shown a 
loyalty and dedication to our New Jersey since he was a boy and that 
dedication exists until this very day. Max is the only other member of 
the band that’s remained a Monmouth County resident besides Bruce and 
Patty. Even his present struggles to ensure the Bay Shore Trail does not
 suffer catastrophic damage plays into his devotion to New Jersey as a 
citizen and as a lifelong resident. His appearance to generate some 
revenue for the Middletown Township Arts Council and their fine facility
 also was proof positive of the musician giving back.<br>
<br>
Do Look Back<br>
<br>
Before the Big Top<br>
<br>
Max started the interview by sharing a sort of home movie made up of 
still and snippets of his days as a boy drummer in New Jersey, primarily
 showing old photos. He was always the leader of those teen bands, 
playing everywhere from dances to strip joints. The film had one song 
playing in the background: Wild Billy’s Circus Story, as Max narrated. 
It concluded with Max revealing that the day he got the gig with the E 
Street band, he felt the same as the boy did at the end of the song:<br>
<br>
And the circus boss leans over and whispers into the little boy's ear<br>
Hey, son, you want to try the big top? <br>
<br>
Max is as rooted to his sense of place here in Monmouth County with the 
same genuine connectedness as Springsteen. Max’s wife Becky, who he 
married in 1981, saw Bruce play long before she knew Max, going to teen 
dances at a place called the Teendezvous (thanks Bumb!) on the corner of
 Sycamore and Route 35 in Shrewsbury. Max had grown up in South Orange 
and Newark, while spending most of his adult life in the Atlantic 
Highlands and Middletown areas of Monmouth County, with his kids 
attending Red Bank Regional and Rumson Fair Haven Regional. Though he 
tours the world, Max has remained true to his roots and rooted to his 
home.<br>
<br>
Bruce Years<br>
<br>
The Calling<br>
<br>
Max detailed his now famous audition for the E Street Band in August, 
1974. Max was living with his parents and playing in the orchestra pit 
of the Broadway musical “Godspell”.<br>
<br>
When Max answered the “no Jr. Ginger Baker” ad in the Village Voice upon
 recommendations of fellow drummer friends who had tried out and failed,
 he only brought his snare, a bass drum and a high hat, dragging it up 4
 floors to the audition on that steamy summer’s day. What caught his eye
 in the ad? “Columbia Records recording artist”. Apparently this band 
was doing something right.<br>
<br>
Max did not want to send any kind of message by just bringing a 
barebones drum kit, but a number of drummers brought huge sets and none 
were selected – only Max was. So, one infers, it must have struck a 
nerve with Bruce. Although Max did not say as much, it is this humble 
sense of service, this soul-deep devotion to the band above all that 
revealed itself to Bruce from that first jam and to this day, Max has 
consistently been more than an accompanist. Perhaps to take a term of 
art from architecture, he’s been a load-bearing member of this house of 
rock.<br>
<br>
He told the audience about when he entered the rehearsal space for the 
audition, “…[t]he guitar player approached me and it was Bruce, saying 
‘[h]ey – let’s play”. Max described how his own focus while playing has 
always been on “where the action is” on stage – which in the E Street 
Band, is Bruce Springsteen.<br>
<br>
Synergy<br>
<br>
Time and again, that synergy and connection came up. The focus clicked 
at the 1974 audition, where Bruce stopped the band stone cold dead on a 
New York dime and Max intuitively nailed that. Max knew he won the 
audition when the band and he all stopped cold on Bruce’s unexpected 
command. (Although Max did not mention it, it has been said that song 
was Let the Four Winds Blow). Even at the recent Jimmy Fallon 
performance of E Street Shuffle in March 2012, Max had to find Bruce in 
the crowd of the audience and a crowd comprised of two bands of 
musicians to lock in on when Bruce was going to end the song. He never 
takes his eyes of Bruce. He never forgets a song.<br>
<br>
The E Street Shuffle performance in particular (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVY43TbibY" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SVY43TbibY</a>)
 illustrated the pandemonium, the sheer sense of exuberant community 
that Bruce brings to every performance. Max described how in television,
 to expect the unexpected, the camera crew tells one another to ‘stay 
wide’. They did that night. No one that night knew Bruce would invite 
the entire audience onto the stage.<br>
<br>
The Boys on the Bus<br>
<br>
Max poignantly described the original band members, including the now 
our sadly departed but never forgotten Clarence “Big Man”/”Master of the
 Universe” Clemons and “Phantom Dan” Federici, as the “boys on the bus”.<br>
<br>
Travel accommodations were endured and then evolved. “We started with 
Garry Talent’s ’65 Chevy with a U-Haul and then an Econoliner van and 
then a GMC motor home – I shared a bunk with Danny. Bruce and Clarence 
had their own bunks. Then we got the bus – the 1976 Coast Cities bus and
 we outfitted it with army cots”. He described their years “growing up” 
touring on that bus, reflecting on the heavy weight of the loss of Danny
 and Clarence, as well as Terry McGovern, Bruce’s long time right-hand 
man since those innocent times. “It’s a huge hole”, he said, “but you 
honor their presence…[t]here’s not a night we don’t remember them.”<br>
<br>
Other concert moments Max recounted included the Rising tour, where the 
band could see the faces of the crowd revealing the deep emotion and sad
 pain of a post-9/11 world. He reconfirmed the story of two young fans 
who saw Bruce at a stoplight at the Rumson Bridge into Sea Bright, 
imploring Bruce “we need you now”. He described the manic organization 
of Kevin Buell to this day under the stage with hundreds upon hundreds 
of songs organized on the off chance an audience sign would be selected 
by Bruce and the E Street Band had to snap into action.<br>
<br>
Jay<br>
<br>
Max spoke with great pride about his son Jay, also a drummer in his own right.<br>
<br>
Max was in his car with Jay when Jay “got the call” from Bruce around 
the time of the 2009 Super Bowl performance. He heard Jay take the call,
 erupting in a eureka epiphany response of a profanity-prefaced ‘YEAH!” 
Jay recounted to Max that Bruce had said, “you may have heard I have 
this band. And in this band I just happen to have the world’s greatest 
rock and roll drummer but he has a scheduling conflict. Would you like 
to help us out?”<br>
<br>
Jay spent weeks in the barn on Max’s property playing to Bruce’s 
records, complete with a list of 100 songs Bruce had given him to 
practice. Max then gave Jay the greatest hits of Sam and Dave and told 
him if he learned that, he’d know all there was to know about playing 
Bruce Springsteen’s music. Indeed, later, when Jay got shocked by 
Bruce’s calling out Back In Your Arms in Stockholm, Steve yelled out to 
Jay: “Sam and Dave! Sam and Dave!” That was all he needed to know.<br>
<br>
In that rock and roll baptism of spontaneous fire, son shared his father
 Max’s driving motivation when an audience member’s sign for a requested
 surprise song is suddenly thrust upon the band: “fear is a great 
motivator – fear that you play it right”.<br>
<br>
Jay exceeded Bruce’s expectations, blurring the lines between father and
 son. Once, Bruce turned to Max after a show on the Wrecking Ball Tour 
and complemented him on the excellent groove they had hit on the rarely 
played Back in Your Arms on a prior night in Stockholm. Max stared. He 
paused and then gently corrected Bruce – “I didn’t play on that”.<br>
<br>
Indeed, it was Jay. That was the Sam and Dave night…<br>
<br>
Max’s pride for his son was palpable through his stories about him, 
including remembering the first time he saw Jay play Born to Run at 
Giant’s Stadium and a video caught Max with a beaming smile and a tear 
in his eye. Apparently Jay and Bruce had "cooked it up" without Max 
knowing and that made it an even better experience.<br>
<br>
Max is no less proud of Ali, his daughter, a classically trained pianist
 who won a 2005 Monmouth County Teen Arts Festival, being selected to 
represent Red Bank Regional’s best, beating out 2000 other students from
 23 participating schools. She’s played Glory Days on stage and in fact,
 played accordion at the final European date on July 28, 2013 in 
Kilkenny, County Cork, Ireland. But, Max added wryly, Ali could not 
simply show up with an accordion and expect to jam – especially in a 
band where nearly everyone plays accordion. “First, you have to be 
asked!”<br>
<br>
Outside E Street<br>
<br>
Clearly, Max’s chops as a drummer got him asked to play time and again 
above and beyond his main love of the E Street Band. Perhaps the longest
 such example was the fact that Max headed up the Max Weinberg 7 for 17 
years with Conan. Max described himself as “the guy who was willing to 
do anything for a laugh” and conceded the sharp contrast from the 
serious intensity he had projected as a rock and roll drummer for so 
long with the goofy and silly humor of O’Brien’s show.<br>
<br>
Max and his wife also have a passion for buying and selling real estate. Max told one story about just that passion.<br>
<br>
When Max was the bandleader for the short lived Tonight Show with Conan 
O’Brien, Max and Becky couldn’t decide on a home to buy in California. 
So they bought and sold five or so homes, always renting. Finally they 
bought a home. Max’s queasiness about the permanency of the gig was over
 and he told his wife – “It’s the Tonight Show? What could happen?”<br>
<br>
Nearly immediately after the purchase of that home, however, Conan’s 
tenure with the Tonight Show met its nine-month end. Max’s comment is 
now preserved forever, proudly displayed on a brass plaque, with his 
name as the quote’s author, in his office – a gift from his lovely wife 
who did not shy away from reminding Max of his less-than-stellar gift 
for prognostication: “It’s the Tonight Show? What could happen?”<br>
<br>
It is not surprising given that the power of the legacy of the Max 
Weinberg is living in the eternal now, eyes never off Bruce, mind never 
off the music, body never not in motion.<br>
<br>
As for advice for young drummers, Max said time and again that his role 
and that of a good drummer was as an accompanist. Quoting Frank Lloyd 
Wright’s comment that “the beauty of a building is the space between the
 walls”, Max added: “music is the space between the notes”.<br>
<br>
This lack of rock star ego and devotion to the band is classic Max: to 
play your role full throttle, but as part of a community on stage for 
the good of people around you, the same as you would do in your family 
and in the community in which you live.<br>
<br>
An audience member asked whether the motivation to play was any 
different today with financial success than it had been when Max was 
young, unknown and struggling. Max remembered Sinatra being asked a 
similar question, with his struggling period referred to as “$50 dates”.
 Frank said “they’re all $50 dates”. Max said since the beginning, it’s 
never been about the compensation but it’s been about that feeling for 
music that, as Bruce says, runs “soul deep”. “It’s not just your job to 
show up and play but show up and play great”. <br>
<br>
Max also echoed Bruce’s comments in recent years, about a new found 
relaxed efficiency born from years of hard work. Max described the later
 recording sessions with Brendan O’Brien as being relaxed and 
reasonable. Max could fly in for the weekend, work from noon to 6 p.m. 
each day, and return home. Gone were the days of sturm und drang of the 
early years.<br>
<br>
Setting the Record Straight on Preserving Bayshore Trail<br>
<br>
During the November 17th interview, Max relished the opportunity to 
share his passion for music and the musicians he has spent a lifetime 
with, but he also wanted to clear up another issue that meant so much to
 him. In doing so, Max revealed a side of himself that would have made 
his father proud.<br>
<br>
Some recent newspaper articles had miscast him as a self-interested 
interloping “rock star” “threatening” Atlantic Highlands with a 
“lawsuit” to stop construction on a beloved local Bayshore Trail. This 
is not true.<br>
<br>
To explain, Max at one point momentarily rushed offstage to grab a 
lectern to discuss this issue, begging the indulgence of the audience. 
He initially did so tongue in cheek but as he spoke with ever increasing
 articulate conviction, it was clear – very clear – that Max was setting
 the record straight and for good reason.<br>
<br>
Max comes from a rich tradition of attorneys in his family, most 
especially his father, Bertram Weinberg. One could see the measured, 
rational polish of the son of a litigator rise up in Max as he 
patiently, good-naturedly defined all the facts and issues.<br>
<br>
The issue is simple: articles incorrectly portrayed Max as having 
“threatened suit”, stalling finalization of the repair of the Bayshore 
Trail. Max Weinberg is not the kind of man that would throw his weight 
around to ensure his own private advantage and he did not have to tell 
the audience that; the facts show that.<br>
<br>
The truth is that he and “many many” other homeowners – including the 
sitting municipal court judge of the same town (also a resident) filed a
 Title 59 “notice of claim” to meet the 90 day deadline. This is not a 
lawsuit. This only means if and only if it would be necessary to bring 
suit against the State, the many homeowners, including Max, would have 
preserved their right to do so.<br>
<br>
Despite the headlines trumpeting the incorrect notion that “lawsuits” 
stalled construction, those same newspaper articles reported that the 
reasons underlying stalled but not abandoned construction included 
officials not identifying funding and officials having to secure permits
 from the Department of Environment Protection.<br>
<br>
Max stressed that everyone wants the trail open but the critical issue 
is performing construction work on the trail that would not jeopardize 
the stability of trail itself, which, if it collapses, could cost a 
great deal to repair (not to mention endanger lives if someone were to 
be on the trail as it convulsed and collapsed). This was a community 
issue – not far removed in spirit from a “band thing”. Bruce has said it
 and Max was implying it: no wins unless we all win.<br>
<br>
The claim was made under the N.J.S.A. §59:1-1 et seq which is the Title 
59 Claims Against Public Entities. The statute’s policy is to protect 
and enforce sovereign immunity - you can’t sue the king – the state is 
in most instances immune from suit. Ever heard of the phrase “you can’t 
fight City Hall?” Well, you can’t sue them either or enjoin them to act,
 except under these very narrow statutory requirements.<br>
<br>
Filing a Title 59 claim is not suing anyone. It’s preserving your right 
to proceed against the State, whether it would be the town or whether it
 would be any governmental entity, in the event of disaster and damage.<br>
<br>
Max enlightened the audience as to just how vulnerable the trail and 
areas are. Max vividly described the geological phenomena known as 
“slumping”, a real worry for the community and the reason for all the 
homeowners preserving claims (but not lawsuits). A slump is a sudden 
failure of a slope resulting in a very deep landslide.<br>
<br>
This means, when sufficient damage is done to the hills near his home 
and others’ homes in Atlantic Highlands, the very earth could shear away
 and, like jello on a plate that reaches a tipping point, that earth 
could slide away in a catastrophic collapse. One of his homes in the 
1970’s did just that and lost 35 feet of yard due to such a calamity.<br>
<br>
Max summed up: “Storm damage, natural progressive erosion is one thing. 
Manmade problems caused by overaggressive excavation and clear-cutting 
of native vegetation that grows along the shoreline is another issue. 
That’s what this is all about.”<br>
<br>
He directed our attention to a fascinating and informative United States
 Geological Society report called the Minard Report, also on the 
Atlantic Highlands website, encouraging the audience to read it as well.<br>

<br>
Max’s humble appreciation behind his being given the opportunity to 
explain his concerns about his being miscast as a “rock star” suing 
people was both genuine and refreshing in an age of mega-rich ego driven
 publicity junkies with no sense of community and no sense of respect 
for those around them. The same devotion to community Max has shown on 
stage after stage, night after night, he brought home to the audience in
 his hometown of Middletown that Sunday night of November 17th, showing 
his devotion to the land, homes and properties around him in his 
community.<br>
<br>
Humble Giant<br>
<br>
Max’s father was a lawyer and Max has said that his father thought the 
law was sacred and meant to help people. Max has adopted that same 
reverence for music that his father had for the law. Both the law and 
music, at their best, change lives profoundly for the better.<br>
<br>
A force of nature behind the drums for nearly 40 years, Max spent the 
evening praising his family, his community, Bruce, the E Street Band and
 others. Max said he was lucky enough to join forces with one of the 
greatest bandleaders and showmen, as well as one of the greatest rock 
and roll songwriters, of the 20th Century.<br>
<br>
However, the unspoken truth is Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band 
have one of the greatest rock and roll drummers of all time and one of 
the most faithful, dedicated band members any band could ever hope to 
have. It’s a band thing.<br>
<br>
Max is not simply what he humbly described himself as – an accompanist whose eye was always on where the action was on stage.<br>
<br>
Rather, Max is and has always been the action engine of the E Street 
Band, the propulsive rhythm turbine of the Max Weinberg 7 and of any 
band he ever plays with.<br>
<br>
It can be said that a man is only so mighty as his character, talent and
 dedication allow. If that is true, than surely a rock and roll band is 
only so mighty as its drummer and the E Street Band is proof of that.<br>
<br>
If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because 
he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, 
however measured or far away.<br>
