				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">From Keef to the mighty Oz: my inspirations<br>
Bruce Springsteen on the people who influenced his own writing<br>
The New York Times<br>
<br>
Who</strong> is <strong class="text-strong">your favourite novelist of all time, and your favourite novelist writing today?<br>
<br>
I</strong> <strong class="text-strong">like the Russians, the Chekhov 
short stories, Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. I never read any of them until 
the past four years, and found them to be thoroughly psychologically 
modern. Personal favourites: The Brothers Karamazov and, of course, Anna
 Karenina.</strong><br>
<br>
Current favourites: Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy and Richard Ford. It’s 
hard to beat American Pastoral, I Married a Communist and Sabbath’s 
Theater. Cormac McCarthy’s Blood Meridian remains a watermark in my 
reading. It’s the combination of Faulkner and Sergio Leone’s spaghetti 
westerns that gives the book its spark for me. I love the way Richard 
Ford writes about New Jersey. The Sportswriter, Independence Day and The
 Lay of the Land are all set on my stomping grounds and, besides being 
poignant and hilarious, nail the Jersey Shore perfectly.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Who are your favourite musician-writers? Your favourite memoir by a musician?<br>
<br>
I’m</strong> not familiar with the musician-novelist but, as far as 
memoirs, it’s hard to beat Keith Richards’s love of music that shines 
through in Life. I also found Eric Clapton’s autobiography to be 
surprisingly revealing and very moving. Of course I loved Bob Dylan’s 
Chronicles. It made me proud to be a musician.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What books might we be surprised to find on your shelves?<br>
<br>
I</strong> read a lot on cosmology and a reasonable amount of 
philosophy. I also like to read about baseball, having just finished 
Mariano Rivera’s autobiography. For cosmology, Lonely Hearts of the 
Cosmos by Dennis Overbye was one of my first favourites. I find men and 
women struggling to answer the deepest questions we can ask freeing. It 
also puts in scale whatever my small problems of the day might be. The 
book that turned me on to philosophy was Bertrand Russell’s The History 
of Western Philosophy. I just finished Examined Lives by Jim Miller and 
How to Live:Or a Life of Montaigne by Sarah Bakewell.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What’s the last book you read that made you laugh?</strong><br>
<br>
Richard Ford’s The Lay of the Land.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The last book that made you cry?</strong><br>
<br>
Cormac McCarthy’s The Road.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The last book that made you furious?<br>
<br>
Too</strong> Big to Fail by Andrew Ross Sorkin; Michael Lewis’s The Big 
Short; and Someplace Like America by Dale Maharidge, with photographs by
 Michael S Williamson. These are a few of the books I read on the recent
 financial collapse and I contributed the foreword to Someplace Like 
America. The criminal outrage and recklessness described in these books 
led directly to my Wrecking Ball album.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What are the best books about music you’ve read?</strong><br>
<br>
At the top of my list remains Greil Marcus’s Mystery Train, followed 
closely by Peter Guralnick’s Last Train to Memphis. I’d include Dylan’s 
Chronicles and a recent book by Daniel Lanois, Soul Mining, that gives 
insights into the making of music I found unique from any other book out
 there. Sonata for Jukebox, by Geoffrey O’Brien, has some lovely 
chapters in it, particularly its opening discussions of Burt Bacharach’s
 career.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What kind of reader were you as a child?</strong><br>
<br>
The first book I read was The Wizard of Oz one lazy summer on my front 
porch on Randolph Street in New Jersey. I remember being thrilled by the
 book and the act of reading. Over time my most beloved character became
 the great and powerful Oz himself. He’s summed up by that great quote 
that’s in the film, but not in the book: “Pay no attention to that man 
behind the curtain.” He’s a carny phoney, in way over his head, who 
manages to pull it off anyway. “Pay no attention to that man behind the 
curtain.” One of the great quotes in American literature.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">If you had to name one book that made you who you are today, what would it be?</strong><br>
<br>
One would be difficult, but the short stories of Flannery O’Connor 
landed hard on me. You could feel within them the unknowability of God, 
the intangible mysteries of life that confounded her characters and 
which I find by my side every day. They contained the dark Gothicness of
 my childhood and yet made me feel fortunate to sit at the centre of 
this swirling black puzzle, stars reeling overhead, the earth barely 
beneath us.<br>
<br>
You’re hosting a literary dinner with three writers. Who’s invited?<br>
Philip Roth, Keith Richards, Tolstoy — and one extra, Bob Dylan. A lot 
of life experience there, and the babbling in different tongues would be
 wonderful.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What books do you find yourself returning to again and again?</strong><br>
<br>
I don’t read many books twice but Jim Thompson novels — due to their 
concise, dirty power, their relentless violence and purity — can always 
draw me in for a second time. Some of the most psychological crime 
writing ever done. I love James M Cain and Elmore Leonard but Jim 
Thompson holds a special place in my heart.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What books are you embarrassed not to have read yet?</strong><br>
<br>
I read The Grapes of Wrath very late, long after I’d written the song 
Ghost of Tom Joad. However, it ended up being everything I’d hoped it to
 be. I haven’t read East of Eden yet, and I’d like to.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What do you plan to read next?</strong><br>
<br>
I loved The Adventures of Augie March by Saul Bellow, and someone just gave me Henderson the Rain King, so that may be up next.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen’s Memoir: Riding Shotgun With the Boss<br>
Books of The Times<br>
By DWIGHT GARNER <br>
SEPT. 20, 2016</strong><br>
<br>
Long dark highways and thin white lines; fire roads and Interstates; the
 skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets; barefoot girls sitting on the
 hoods of Dodges; pink Cadillacs; last-chance power drives; men who go 
out for a ride and never come back.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen’s song lyrics have injected more drama and mystery 
into the myths of the American road than any figure since Jack Kerouac. 
He knows this, of course. So it’s one of the running jokes in his big, 
loose, rangy and intensely satisfying new memoir, “Born to Run” (what 
else was he going to call it?), that he didn’t begin to drive until he 
was well into his 20s — around the time he landed simultaneously on the 
covers of Time and Newsweek.<br>
<br>
His brooding and violent father had been too impatient to teach him and,
 anyway, he couldn’t afford a car. When Mr. Springsteen was forced to 
sneak behind the wheel, licenseless, to handle some of the driving on 
his earliest tours, his ineptitude terrified his band members. He did 
not exactly, when young and virile, ride through mansions of glory on 
suicide machines. He mostly stuck out his thumb. He’d been born to 
hitch.<br>
<br>
“Every sort of rube, redneck, responsible citizen and hell-raiser the 
Jersey Shore had to offer, I rode with ’em,” he writes in “Born to Run.”
 These rides matter because Mr. Springsteen’s songs, like the 
blue-collar poetry of Philip Levine, are intensely peopled. Wild Billy 
and Crazy Janey, Johnny 99, Mary from “Thunder Road,” Wayne from 
“Darlington County,” Jimmy the Saint and Bobby Jean had to come from 
somewhere. This memoir suggests Mr. Springsteen met many of them while 
cackling over there in the shotgun seat.<br>
<br>
The headline news in “Born to Run,” to judge by the early news media 
tweets, is that Mr. Springsteen, who turns 67 on Friday, has suffered 
periodically from serious depression. I will admit that this information
 shook me. If Bruce Springsteen has to resort to Klonopin, what hope is 
there for anyone? But these sections are not the reason to come to “Born
 to Run.”<br>
<br>
<br>
The book is like one of Mr. Springsteen’s shows — long, ecstatic, 
exhausting, filled with peaks and valleys. It’s part séance and part keg
 party, and then the house lights come up and you realize that, A) you 
look ridiculous dancing to “Twist and Shout” and, B) you will be driving
 home in a minivan and not a Camaro.<br>
<br>
His writing voice is much like his speaking voice; there’s a big, raspy 
laugh on at least every other page. There’s some raunch here. This book 
has not been utterly sanitized for anyone’s protection, and many of the 
best lines won’t be printed in this newspaper. Most important, “Born to 
Run” is, like his finest songs, closely observed from end to end. His 
story is intimate and personal, but he has an interest in other people 
and a gift for sizing them up.<br>
<br>
Here’s just one example, chosen nearly at random. When Mr. Springsteen 
meets a future girlfriend on the boardwalk in Asbury Park, N.J. (one of 
innumerable girlfriends on display here), he delivers this electric 
introduction: “She was Italian, funny, a beatific tomboy, with just the 
hint of a lazy eye, and wore a pair of glasses that made me think of the
 wonders of the library.” Well, hello, you think.<br>
<br>
Much of the writing in “Born to Run” is this fresh — the sound of a 
writer who could have phoned his book in but did not. There are dollops 
of pretension and word-goo in “Born to Run.” Springsteen wouldn’t be 
Springsteen without homilies, a few of them leaden, about fathers and 
sons and love and work and community. But this book mostly gets away 
clean, leaving behind the scent of lightly scorched rubber.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen’s father was a frequently unemployed bus driver, among 
other blue-collar jobs; his mother a legal secretary. They were fairly 
poor. In their houses — half-houses, more often — there was generally no
 telephone and little heat. Meals were cooked on a coal stove. “Born to 
Run” is potent on the subject of social class.<br>
<br>
In Mr. Springsteen’s part of New Jersey it was the “rah-rahs” (preppies)
 versus the greasers, and there was no doubt which side of that line he 
was on. At some of his early shows, guys in chinos spat on him.<br>
<br>
“I could still feel the shadow of that spit that hit me long ago when I 
moved to Rumson in 1983, 16 years later,” he writes. He’d found fame and
 bought a decent place. Yet: “At 33 years old, I still had to take a big
 gulp of air before walking through the door of my new home.”<br>
<br>
He suggests there’s a freight of psychic payback in “Darkness on the 
Edge of Town,” his most fully realized album. “For my parents’ troubled 
lives I was determined to be the enlightened, compassionate voice of 
reason and revenge.”<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen got his first guitar, a rental, after seeing Elvis on 
“The Ed Sullivan Show.” He had a serious work ethic, and went on to play
 in a string of well-regarded bands with names like Child and Earth and 
Steel Mill.<br>
<br>
When his word-drunk first record, “Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.,” 
appeared in 1973, he was lumped with the so-called New Dylans, folk 
singers like Loudon Wainwright III and John Prine. But there was a 
crucial difference. Unlike those performers, Mr. Springsteen onstage, 
thanks to his long bar-band apprenticeship, could blow audiences 
backward.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen writes that he’s never thought much of his singing 
voice. As good a guitar player as he is, others were better. It was his 
songs, he realized early, that would have to put him over the top. If 
this book has one curious blind spot, it’s that we never quite 
understand how those words came into being.<br>
<br>
He studied the songwriting of people like Mr. Dylan, Donovan and Tim 
Buckley, he writes. But so did many others. If his early reading was an 
influence, he doesn’t say. The words were apparently just there, 
available, on tap. And they stayed there, even when his lyrics became 
pared down. Songs like “The River” and “Stolen Car” are as evocative in 
their details as are Raymond Carver’s best short stories.<br>
<br>
“Born to Run” takes us, album by album, through his career. These 
chapters sometimes feel clipped and compressed, as if he’s wedged the 
data in his heart onto a thumb drive.<br>
<br>
The book takes us through his many stabs at romance, which tended to end
 badly. (He once gave his father the crabs after they’d shared a toilet 
seat.) He details the failure of his first marriage, to the actress 
Julianne Phillips, and the success of his second, to Patti Scialfa, whom
 he describes, in a childhood photo, as “a freckle-faced Raggedy Ann of a
 little girl.”<br>
<br>
He raised his three children without rock-star mementos in the house. 
“My kids didn’t know ‘Badlands’ from matzo ball soup,” he writes. “When I
 was approached on the street for autographs, I’d explain to them that 
in my job I was Barney (the then-famous purple dinosaur) for adults.” 
His eldest son says, in shock, “Dad, that guy has you tattooed on his 
arm.”<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen’s work ethic has never abandoned him, or he it. “I’m 
glad I’ve been handsomely paid for my efforts,” he writes, “but I truly 
would have done it for free.”<br>

<strong class="text-strong">Born to Run by Bruce Springsteen review – inside the mind of the Boss<br>
This highly anticipated memoir is as rich in anecdote as it is in 
anguish. From shameful behaviour to life in therapy, the musician lays 
out his search for meaning<br>
 <br>
Richard Williams<br>
 September  21,2016</strong><br>
<br>
Several days into a late-summer road trip across the US, a man in his 
early 30s stops at dusk to observe a fair taking place in a small Texas 
town. A band is playing. A couple dance. “From nowhere,” the man 
recalls, “a despair overcomes me … right now, all I can think is that I 
want to be amongst them, of them, and I know I can’t. I can only watch. 
That’s what I do. I do not engage, and if and when I do, my terms are so
 stringent, they suck the lifeblood and possibility out of any good 
thing, any real thing.” A few days later, having reached home, he places
 a call. Bruce Springsteen is making his first appointment with a 
shrink.<br>
<br>
“So began 30 years of one of the biggest adventures of my life, 
canvassing the squirrely terrain inside my own head for signs of life,” 
Springsteen writes at the midpoint of his autobiography, having set a 
scene that could have come from one of his darker ballads. Already he 
has introduced the reader to his troubled relationship with a 
Dutch-Irish father unable to escape a succession of blue-collar jobs – 
bus driver, prison guard, factory worker – in a nondescript part of New 
Jersey. It is in this harsh, cold, ungiving man that Springsteen locates
 the origin of his own flaws and fears.<br>
<br>
“As a boy, I figured it was just the way men were, distant, 
uncommunicative, busy with the currents of the grown-up world.” And 
angry. At the wheel of a car, “I would use speed and recklessness to 
communicate my own rage … with the sole purpose of terrorising my rider.
 It was gross, bullying, violent and humiliating behaviour that filled 
me with shame afterward … Part of me was rebelliously proud of my 
emotionally violent behaviour, always aimed at the women in my life. It 
was all straight out of the old man’s playbook.” Late in life the father
 is forced to confront full-blown paranoid schizophrenia, but not before
 he has seen his son march into his house and place an Oscar statuette 
(awarded for the theme song to Jonathan Demme’s Philadelphia) on the 
table. “I’ll never tell anybody what to do ever again,” the father 
declares, and the wounds begin to heal.<br>
<br>

His mother, whose parents were immigrants from Naples and Sorrento, 
taught him other lessons: “Truthfulness, consistency, professionalism, 
kindness, compassion, manners, thoughtfulness, pride in yourself, 
honour, love, faith in and fidelity to your family, commitment, joy in 
your work and a never-say-die thirst for life.” Some of these qualities 
would be recognised by fans attending the arena concerts in which a man 
deep into his seventh decade can still spend close to four hours 
carrying his listeners on an emotional rollercoaster ride with a 
generosity, an energy, an intimacy and a gift for drama that none of his
 contemporaries can begin to match.<br>
<br>
In a book that bears the hallmarks of having been written by his own 
hand, Springsteen is particularly good at capturing the exhilaration of 
his rise to success with the E Street Band, formed as a “benevolent 
dictatorship” in 1972 after he had grown weary of playing in 
co-operative groups. “Democracy in rock bands, with very few exceptions,
 is often a ticking time-bomb,” he writes. “If I was going to assume the
 workload and responsibility, I might as well assume the power. I’ve 
always believed the E Street Band’s continued existence is partially due
 to the fact that there was little to no role confusion among its 
members. My bandmates were not always happy with the decisions I made 
and may have been angered by some of them, but nobody debated my right 
to make them.”<br>
<br>
The book is as rich in anecdote and detail as in anguish and doubt. He 
opens by describing his 10-year-old self accompanying his grandfather to
 scavenge in rubbish tips for broken radio sets that can be repaired and
 sold to black workers in summer migrant camps. He talks about his 
experience as an altar boy with a Catholicism that surely encouraged his
 underlying sense of guilt and obligation (“I don’t often participate in
 my religion but I know somewhere, deep inside, I’m still on the team”).
 Tribute is paid to his heroes – Elvis, the Beatles, the Stones, Dylan 
and Van Morrison, whose 1968 album Astral Weeks was “the record that 
taught me to trust beauty” – and he provides a (mostly) grateful boss’s 
view of his long-term musical sidekicks, notably the late Clarence 
Clemons, the giant saxophonist whose appearance alongside Springsteen on
 the cover of Born to Run, the band’s breakthrough album in 1975, helped
 to overlay “a nice little R&amp;B-flavoured outfit” with the aura of 
myth.<br>
<br>
He remembers the name of the girl who gave him his first kiss, but 
anonymises his later intimacies, including the girlfriend who inspired 
the song “Rosalita”, who he believes was the first girl with whom he had
 successful intercourse – “though, due to the fog of war, I can’t be 
absolutely sure”. There’s another who broke his heart in the days before
 success struck: “A drug-taking, hell-raising wild child who played by 
nobody’s rules. She was a perfect antidote to the control freak in me. 
She was so alive, funny and broken, I couldn’t resist her. She’d been 
around, knew a few grade-B-level rock stars, brought them down to 
‘discover’ my band, then slept with them.” Investigating the 
possibilities offered by a rock’n’roller’s moral compass, he retaliated 
by sleeping with her friend.<br>
<br>
It takes him until page 501 to admit – honourably, if a little 
deflatingly – that “I haven’t told you ‘all’ about myself. Discretion 
and the feelings of others don’t allow it.” The exceptions to the code 
of romantic anonymity are his two wives: the actor and model Julianne 
Phillips, whom he married in 1985; and the singer Patti Scialfa, with 
whom he took up when the first marriage was faltering and with whom he 
now has three grown-up children. The break-up with Phillips brings a 
bleak verdict on his own behaviour: “I dealt with it abysmally.” Scialfa
 is portrayed as a figure of saintly forbearance and sensitivity.<br>
<br>
Overwriting and repetition sometimes make it feel as though he has 
chosen to issue the literary equivalent of the four-CD deluxe version, 
complete with demos and out-takes, instead of the finished album itself.
 The sentimental stuff about his kids could have been tightened up and 
the occasional splurges of capital letters and exclamation marks require
 understanding as an attempt to reproduce on the page the comic 
melodrama of his on-stage storytelling. His editor might have given him 
better advice on that, as well as correcting a few mistakes. For a 
songwriter in whose work automobiles have played such a powerful role, 
it’s strange that a car that starts a journey as a Dodge at the top of a
 page should mysteriously have become a Pontiac by the bottom. And his 
British fans will tell him that it’s Geno Washington, not Gino.<br>
<br>
But this is a man who, after watching other rock’n’rollers respond to 
material success by losing touch with reality, became determined to make
 his own music “a search for meaning and the future”. He gave his 
services to righteous charities and themed entire albums in response to 
unemployment in the post-industrial wasteland, the 9/11 attacks, the 
Iraq war and the delinquency of Wall Street. Perhaps that sense of 
mission – alongside sophisticated medication, the company of his family 
and the sharing of energy with his concert audiences – is playing a part
 in repelling the bouts of depression that have continued into his 60s. 
As he writes: “I was never going to be Woody Guthrie – I liked the pink 
Cadillac too much – but there was work to be done.” And still is.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Why would Bruce Springsteen need to write an autobiography? Everyone has secrets.<br>
Washington Post<br>
By Joe Heim <br>
September 20 <br>
</strong><br>
Why, one might ask, would Bruce Springsteen need to write an 
autobiography? Haven’t we been listening to it for the past half 
century? Hasn’t he been telling us his story all along?<br>
<br>
Didn’t we already know that the boardwalk wildness of “Greetings From 
Asbury Park, N.J.,” the frenzied desperation of “Born to Run,” the 
smoldering rage of “Darkness on the Edge of Town,” that that was all 
him? And yes, the characters of “The River” and “Tunnel of Love” and 
“The Rising” were composites, but wasn’t he writing about people he 
knew? And that we knew? And wasn’t he writing about himself? And us?<br>
<br>
Unlike the ever-inscrutable Bob Dylan or the late magically mystical 
Prince, Springsteen, who turns 67 on Friday, has always seemed to be in 
communion with his fans, exploring forces of life and love and loss in 
blistering four-minute rock songs that spoke to a journey that both 
singer and sung-to recognized as shared.<br>
<br>
But everyone has secrets. And for all of Springsteen’s fame, there is 
much about his story — about the people and events and dreams and fears 
that shaped him — that isn’t widely known.<br>
<br>
Randolph Street in Freehold, N.J., where he knew “every crack, bone and 
crevice in the crumbling sidewalk,” is where Springsteen launches “Born 
to Run,” his new autobiography, which will be released Tuesday. It’s a 
508-page offering that, like his four-hour concerts, delivers enough 
punch and laughter, sorrow and succor, to satisfy your soul and still, 
somehow, leave you wanting more. Fans are greedy that way.<br>
<br>
Desperate and unforgiving, the run-down underbelly of the American 
Dream, Freehold is a recurring character in Springsteen’s story. It is 
the town he escaped in his teens and has been running from ever since. 
And yet with its ties to generations of his Irish Italian family, his 
hard-hit neighbors and the long-gone smoke-belching factories that 
shaped his blue-collar identity, it is the town to which he often 
returns in memories and dreams and late-night drives past his childhood 
homes and haunts.<br>
<br>
Springsteen spends the first quarter of his book in the “heart-stopping,
 pants-dropping, race-riot-creating, oddball-hating, soul-shaking, 
love-and-fearmaking, heartbreaking town” of Freehold. To understand him 
in any sense, fans must understand this place.<br>
<br>
Freehold is where he was spoiled and cocooned by a grandmother who had 
lost a daughter. It is where he played baseball with neighborhood kids, 
was an altar boy at St. Rose of Lima Church and was knocked around by 
the nuns at school. It is where his mother bought him his first guitar, 
where he first heard Elvis Presley and the Beatles. It is where he would
 join his first band, get kicked out of a band, dodge the draft and make
 friends with guys who would later be killed in Vietnam.<br>
<br>
And Freehold is also where his taciturn father drank a “sacred six-pack”
 in the pitch dark every night and then wanted to see him. “It was 
always the same,” Springsteen writes. “A few moments of feigned parental
 concern for my well-being followed by the real deal: the hostility and 
raw anger toward his son.”<br>
<br>
That ongoing strife between father and son would erupt and then subside,
 but it cast a shroud for decades. In later years, Springsteen’s father 
would be diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and treated with 
medication, eventually allowing a reconciliation of sorts, but never 
quite freeing the son from the past.<br>
<br>
At 19, Springsteen’s parents and youngest sister left Freehold to move 
to California, and a month later Springsteen left, too, but headed east 
to the Jersey Shore instead. In the following years, captured in the 
book’s middle chapters, he would meet many of the characters and 
musicians who would help shape his sound, play shows that turned into 
melees with the police, live on next to nothing, take death-defying road
 trips across the country and assert himself as the founder, leader and 
decider of what would become the E Street Band.<br>
<br>
After meeting Mike Appel, his first agent whom he would later tangle 
with in a long legal battle, Springsteen recalls being taken to play a 
song for the legendary producer John Hammond at Columbia Records, with a
 potential record deal on the line.<br>
<br>
“I sat directly across from him and played ‘Saint in the City.’ When I 
was done I looked up. That smile was still there and I heard him say, 
‘You’ve got to be on Columbia Records.’ One song — that’s what it took. I
 felt my heart rise up inside me, mysterious particles dancing 
underneath my skin and faraway stars lighting up my nerve endings.”<br>
<br>
Throughout the book, Springsteen brings moments such as these to life 
with memories that put you in the room, whether it’s a whispered aside 
from Bob Dylan at the Kennedy Center Honors, arguments with record 
company executives over what to do with an album, or a rare 
guitar-throwing tantrum directed at his friend and longtime manager Jon 
Landau. Having lived for his music and not much else for long stretches 
at a time, he is particularly adept at recalling the recording process 
and decision-making of each of his albums, a boon for hardcore fans who 
crave that detail.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is also quite funny, particularly when he’s taking aim at 
himself as when he recalls being mocked by his children for his moves in
 his “Dancing in the Dark” video. Or how he explained to them when they 
were young that he was like a Barney for grown-ups after they asked why 
so many people wanted his autograph.<br>
<br>
Though he’s deservedly proud of his music and his achievements, he 
doesn’t shy away from self-criticism, particularly when it comes to 
failed relationships, such as his short-term marriage to actress 
Julianne Phillips. But if he’s hard on himself, he’s kind to everyone 
else. No one is left scathed, not even his father, whom he seems to have
 forgiven.<br>
<br>
Springsteen gained a deeper understanding of his father’s illness when 
he too became plagued by crushing depression and anxiety. In his 30s, 
feeling adrift despite career success, he experienced an anxiety attack 
while driving with a friend across the country. He recounts getting 
professional help for the first time in his life: “I walk in; look into 
the eyes of a kindly, white-haired, mustached complete stranger; sit 
down; and burst into tears.”<br>
<br>
<br>
Mental illness is very much the subtext of this book as Springsteen 
tracks the disease in his family and shares intimate details of a dark 
depression that has visited him as recently as a few years ago. He 
credits medication and the resolve of his wife and bandmate, Patti 
Scialfa, with being able to survive the onslaught.<br>
<br>
“During these periods I can be cruel: I run, I dissemble, I dodge, I 
weave, I disappear, I return, I rarely apologize, and all the while 
Patti holds down the fort as I’m trying to burn it down.”<br>
<br>
There are 79 chapters in “Born to Run,” and while that number may simply
 be a coincidence, there is little evidence that Springsteen — a control
 freak if there ever was one — leaves these things to happenstance. It’s
 only a guess, but 79 is the life span of the average American male. And
 the life of the average American male has been grist for so much of 
Springsteen’s work. Whatever the reason, these chapters reveal many new 
sides, not all flattering, of a person who has been telling his story 
for nearly a half century.<br>
<br>
“I haven’t told you ‘all’ about myself,” Springsteen writes near the end
 of the book. “Discretion and the feelings of others don’t allow it. But
 in a project like this, the writer has made one promise: to show the 
reader his mind. In these pages I’ve tried to do that.”<br>
<br>
It turns out Springsteen fans did need an autobiography after all.<br>

BORN TO RUN<br>
By Bruce Springsteen<br>
Illustrated. 510 pp. Simon &amp; Schuster. $32.50</strong>.<br>
<br>
For most of us nine jillion Bruce Springsteen fans who’ve stood through 
years of his barn-burning, bombs-dropping, ceiling-­cracking, 
ozone-splitting three-hour mega-­extravaganza concerts, in all manner of
 nasty weather and good, who’ve bought and rebought album after album, 
who’ve pored over lyrics, mused over his complex musical and band life, 
as well as his privacy-shrouded marital, familial and psychic forays, 
and who’ve demarked sovereign occasions in our own lives with the 
strains of “No Surrender” running through our hectic brains — for all of
 us in his global audience — the perpetual fascination of Bruce (I’ve 
never, I give you my word, shouted that out at a performance) is simply:
 How the hell do you get from Freehold, N.J., to this in only 50 short 
years? It’s reminiscent of the old Maine farmer who, when asked 
directions to the next town over the hill, allows that you can’t get 
there from here. Really, in Springsteen’s or anybody’s life, you can’t 
get there from here. But, well . . . here he is. Are we not all present 
to testify?<br>
<br>
The Boss’s new autobiography, “Born to Run,” ought at its heart to 
penetrate and lay bare this mystery housed in a paradox. And to a great 
extent it nicely does.<br>
<br>
Pretty much everybody who encountered Bruce Springsteen over the many 
years, from the proprietors of the gritty Upstage in ’69 Asbury Park, to
 the iconic Columbia hitmakers John Hammond and Clive Davis, to his 
ever-loyal, ever-­querulous, suffering but indispensable E Street 
sidemen, to Ronald Reagan, to Pete Seeger, all the way to Barack Obama, 
has recognized Springsteen as somebody way special — somebody who proved
 it all night onstage, owned major chops, was a guy you couldn’t take 
your eyes off, and somehow couldn’t stay mad at, even though he 
possessed charmingly immodest valuations of his young abilities, treated
 his bandmates like favored employees and could go all moody, isolated 
’n’ stuff when things rubbed him the wrong way. You could say the same 
thing — using different words — about the Morrison brothers, Jim and 
Van, about Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye, Janis Joplin, even about Eric 
Burdon and no doubt the Big Bopper. They are and were all special — in 
their way. But “special” doesn’t get you Bruce Springsteen in front of 
90,000 people for 30-plus years in 40 different countries, and still 
going strong as late as last Wednesday afternoon.<br>
<br>
People who see art from the outside — from the spectator seats where 
we’re intended to see it — often don’t get the making of art very right.
 Which is a victimless crime. But it’s partly because we don’t quite get
 it that hosts of fans are drawn to Springsteen. His work’s entirety — 
the songs, the music, the guitar, the voice, the persona, the gyrations,
 the recitativos, the whole artifice of “the act,” or what Springsteen 
calls the “sum of all my parts” — is so dense, involved and 
­authentic-seeming as to all but defy what we think we know about how 
regular human beings make things at ground level. Having been present at
 many of his performances, I can attest that you’re often close to being
 overwhelmed by what you’re hearing and seeing. It’s an experience that 
draws you toward itself — to taste the best and richest stuff, but also 
naturally enough to find things out, such as if you’re being ­deceived.<br>
<br>
In “Born to Run,” Springsteen seems at his most actual when he’s telling
 us how in fact one gets to be him. He’s preoccupied by his own and his 
music’s “authenticity,” even though he understands that the act is ever 
the act. He’s close to humble about his musician’s “journeyman” status, 
about how rock music is at heart “escapist entertainment,” and concedes 
that rock ’n’ roll itself as a vehicle for ideas (always questionable to
 me) is in serious decline.<br>
<br>
<br>
But he’s also straight up and smart about just what the whole 
Springsteen enterprise requires. Talent. O.K., that’s one. A great band 
behind you for all the years. Two. But also alarming self-certainty at a
 preposterously young age (“It is ultimately my stage,” “my band,” “my 
will,” “my musicians”). Near-feral discipline he’s more than willing to 
impose on self and anybody else in earshot — especially the band. 
Studious and encyclopedic knowledge of the genre and rock history. An 
ungodly number of irreplaceable life hours spent practicing, practicing,
 practicing in small, ill-lit rooms. A ruthless calculation to be 
nothing less than great, powered by a conviction that greatness can 
exist and be redeeming. A willingness to imagine himself as a dutiful 
and grateful avatar of his own adored fan base. An ease with his 
influences, teachers and heroes. An uncommon awareness of his personal 
frailties (“About my voice. First of all, I don’t have much of one”). A 
­Picasso-like certainty that all art comes out of a “rambunctious gang 
feeling” born of the neighborhood. And a complex fear of failure mingled
 with the understanding that success is often the enemy of the very 
authenticity he’s seeking — so you gotta stay on your guard 24-7. Or, at
 least, from 1967 to now. “If you want to burn bright, hard and long,” 
the Boss writes, “you will need to depend upon more than your initial 
instincts. You will need to develop some craft and a creative 
intelligence that will lead you farther when things get dicey.” And if 
that sounds a bit too much like the Gotham Writers’ Workshop, add this: 
“In the beginning I knew I wanted something more than a solo act and 
less than a one-man-one-vote democratic band. I’d been there and it 
didn’t fit me. Democracy in rock bands, with very few exceptions, is 
often a ticking time bomb. . . . A moderate in most other aspects of my 
life, here I was extreme.”<br>
<br>
So much for a band of brothers in that shining rock ’n’ roll mansion on 
the hill. “We all grow up,” Springsteen later adds, “and we know ‘it’s 
only rock ’n’ roll’ . . . but it’s not.”<br>
<br>
<br>
It should be said, just to keep my own credibility flickering, that all 
this I’ve just spun out here is long and well known (probably memorized 
catechistically) by the great sea of Springsteen faithful. At a recent 
concert at the Barclays Center — attended by me, my wife, Governor 
Christie, Steve Earle and 18,000 strangers — the Boss brought a 
10-year-old girl up onto the stage and stood by admiringly as she sang, 
apparently spontaneously, all the verses to “Blinded by the Light” — 547
 dizzying words. Which means it’s going to be hard for most of the 
insider intel in “Born to Run” not to be already long-­assimilated by 
the ever-vigilant and protectively gimlet-eyed “Springsteen fan.” It’s 
also likely that if you’ve never heard of Bruce Springsteen — in 
whatever dark-ops lazaretto you might’ve been held captive in for four 
decades — you might not pick up this book at all.<br>
<br>
<br>
Which isn’t to say that Springsteen shouldn’t have written it — if only 
as a love letter to his legions; or that the publishers won’t be 
printing money from September on. All Springsteen fans will read this 
book. Though it’s fair to say that “Born to Run’s” focus audience is 
likely us punters in the middle; those for whom “Independence Day,” 
“Wild Billy’s Circus Story,” “Bobby Jean,” “Nebraska,” “Streets of 
Philadelphia,” “Hungry Heart” and “Born in the U.S.A.” have been the 
emotive background music — and for some of us the foreground music — of a
 lifetime, but who as yet haven’t dedicated our entire lives to Bruce. 
We’ll feel better, though, when we learn that the Boss can’t really read
 music, that “Born in the U.S.A.” and “Nebraska” were recorded at the 
same time, that Springsteen has a daughter who’s a champion equestrian, 
that he’s spent years in therapy, can forgive those who’ve wronged him, 
thinks of his career as a “service” performed for others who’re like 
him, and owns a supple sense of humor capable of poking fun at himself 
(at least when the mood’s right).<br>
<br>
It helps that Springsteen can write — not just life-­imprinting song 
lyrics but good, solid prose that travels all the way to the right 
margin. I mean, you’d think a guy who wrote “Spanish Johnny drove in 
from the underworld last night / With bruised arms and broken rhythm and
 a beat-up old Buick . . .” could navigate his way around a complete and
 creditable American sentence. And you’d be right. Oh, there are a few 
gassy bits here and there, a jot too much couch-inspired hooey about the
 “terrain inside my own head.” A tad more rock ’n’ roll highfalutin than
 this reader really needs — though the Bruce enthusiasts down in 
Sea-Clift won’t agree with me. No way. But nothing in “Born to Run” 
rings to me as unmeant or punch-pulling. If anything, Springsteen wants 
credit for telling it the way it really is and was. And like a fabled 
Springsteen concert — always notable for its deck-clearing thoroughness —
 “Born to Run” achieves the sensation that all the relevant questions 
have been answered by the time the lights are turned out. He delivers 
the story of Bruce — in digestibly short chapters — via an informally 
steadfast Jersey plainspeak that’s worked and deftly detailed and 
intimate with its readers — cleareyed enough to say what it means when 
it has hard stories to tell, yet supple enough to rise to occasions 
requiring eloquence — sometimes rather pleasingly subsiding into the 
syntax and rhythms of a Bruce Springsteen song: “So we all made do,” he 
writes about his parents’ abrupt move from Freehold to California, in 
1969, leaving him behind. “My sister vanished into ‘Cowtown’ — the South
 Jersey hinterlands — and I pretended none of it really mattered. You 
were on your own — now and forever. This sealed it. Plus, a part of me 
was truly glad for them, for my dad. Get out, Pops! Out of this 
[expletive] dump.”<br>
<br>
It’s the family parts that mean most to me in “Born to Run,” the parts 
that add ballast to Springsteen’s claim that when audiences see him they
 see themselves. Just like we’re frequently wrong about how art gets 
made, we also often can’t reliably say where it comes from. We might not
 stay interested in it very long if we could. And nothing here conveys 
the whole secret of how you get from Freehold, 1964, strumming a $69 
Kent guitar, to the Meadowlands with a Telecaster, standing in front of a
 multitude. But one place art can come from is a life full of 
forces-­difficult-to-make-fit-together, a life that finds, in art, a 
providential instrument for reconciling the jagged bits. Springsteen’s 
part Scots-Irish, part Italian family was a caldron of these bubbling 
forces. A silently brooding, unsuccessful, hostile, misanthropic father 
(“He loved me but he couldn’t stand me”), an enormously loving mother 
whose first loyalty, however, was to the unhappy husband. Plus, a 
reticulated, extended, occasionally volatile but doting family of 
immigrant descendants — grandparents, aunts, uncles, sisters, one 
greaser brother-in-law — some of them, Springsteen says, with serious 
mental illness, “a black melancholy,” to which he himself falls heir. 
All of these denizens encamped within a declining, postindustrial 
neighborhood of poor, rented, cold-water houses, in a “one-dog burg” 
down in that lost part of the Garden State you never thought about until
 you heard the words Bruce and Springsteen in that order.<br>
<br>
You could say of course, and again you’d be right, that this is nothing 
very remote from a lot of lives. Mine. Yours. Mid­century American 
Gothic. A “crap heap of a hometown that I loved.” But therein lies at 
least a hint to the magic in the Springsteen mystery: the muscular rise 
to the small occasion, taking forceful dominion over your poky 
circumstance and championing your own responses to what would otherwise 
seem inevitable. “Those whose love we wanted but could not get,” 
Springsteen writes, memorably, “we emulate. It is dangerous but it makes
 us feel closer, gives us an illusion of the intimacy we never had. It 
stakes our claim upon that which was rightfully ours but denied. In my 
20s, as my song and my story began to take shape, I searched for the 
voice I would blend with mine to do the telling. It is a moment when 
through creativity and will you can rework, repossess and rebirth the 
conflicting voices of your childhood, to turn them into something alive,
 powerful and seeking light. I’m a repairman. That’s part of my job. So 
I, who’d never done a week’s worth of manual labor in my life . . . put 
on a factory worker’s clothes, my father’s clothes, and went to work.”<br>
<br>
Seamus Heaney wrote once in a poem that the end of art is peace. But I 
think he’d have been willing to share the stage with Springsteen, and to
 admit that sometimes the end of art is also one hell of a legitimately 
great and soaring noise, a sound you just don’t want to end.<br>

September 23<br>
Written By Steve Almond</strong> <br>
<br>
Anyone who’s seen Bruce Springsteen in concert will know precisely what 
to expect from his new memoir, “Born to Run.’’ The book, seven years in 
the making, is ambitious, earnest, lyric, rollicking, loud, and long — 
510 pages in all, not counting photos.<br>
<br>
That’s not a criticism, mind you. As he turns 67 (his birthday is Sept. 
23), Springsteen ranks second only to Dylan on our Mount Rushmore of 
rock, a diamond-hard troubadour who distills the yearnings and dashed 
dreams of working-class Americans into stadium-shaking anthems.<br>
<br>
Does this hotly anticipated tome peel back the sweaty mythos in which 
the Boss has always been shrouded and reveal the thoughtful young man 
who rose from the gritty boardwalks of the Jersey shore to the empyrean 
heights of superstardom?<br>
<br>
In a word: Yes, though what emerges is not a joyride of Dionysian excess
 but a portrait of the young artist as a single-minded pragmatist.<br>
<br>
The journey begins in his hard-scrabble hometown of Freehold, N.J., 
where Springsteen, as the first grandchild, grew up amid a garish cast 
of Irish and Italian relatives who essentially all lived in the same 
neighborhood. “Due to order of birth and circumstance,” he writes, “I 
was lord, king and the messiah all rolled into one.” It was a feeling he
 would seek to rekindle for the rest of his life.<br>
View Story<br>
Springsteen’s ‘Chapter &amp; Verse’ tells a life story in song<br>
<br>
The new companion album to his autobiography tells a story in its own right of the musical development of the Boss.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen, the people’s rock god<br>
<br>
Along with his parents, Springsteen spent his early years living with 
his father’s family. There, his grandfather, a radio repairman, brought 
the siren call of the airwaves into his grandson’s life, “the sound of 
the world outside straining to reach us.”<br>
<br>
Young Bruce absorbs influences wherever he can find them, including the 
Catholic Church next door. “This was the world where I found the 
beginnings of my song. In Catholicism, there existed the poetry, danger 
and darkness that reflected my imagination and my inner self.” By age 7,
 he has deemed himself an “outcast weirdo misfit sissy boy.”<br>
<br>
Looming largest of all are his vivacious Italian-American mother and his
 hard-drinking, troubled Dutch-Irish father, who at one point returns 
from a bar and verbally abuses his wife. A terrified Springsteen (age 9)
 creeps from his bedroom and whacks his old man between the shoulder 
blades with a baseball bat.<br>
<br>
It’s a telling scene. Despite his sensitivity, Springsteen harbors what 
he aptly describes as “ravenous ambitions,” not just for fame but for 
the ultimate prize — self-determination. Before long, he has taught 
himself guitar (purchased from a Western Auto store for $18), ditched 
any dreams of college, formed and fronted various bands, and become a 
fixture in the taverns of Asbury Park. There’s a compulsive charge to 
this part of the tale, as Springsteen scrapes out a living amid the 
wild, the innocent, and the criminal.<br>
<br>
At one point, on the brink of homelessness, he drives to Manhattan to 
pick up $35 from his manager. He only has pennies to pay the $1 toll at 
the Holland Tunnel, and the attendant insists on counting. One is 
Canadian. Bruce Springsteen, future Rock God, does what he must: He 
roots around his battered Pontiac and finds the final cent between two 
rear-seat cushions.<br>
<br>
Springsteen quickly recognizes that his voice and guitar playing are not
 going to get him out of the beach bars. “The songs would have to be 
fireworks,” he observes.<br>
<br>
Alas, his relentless drive leaves him with little time for hijinks. He’s
 more control freak than party animal, his drug of choice being the 
ecstatic communion he establishes with his band mates (as their 
benevolent dictator) and an adoring audience.<br>
<br>
This is not to suggest that Springsteen is without a comic sensibility. 
He’s particularly adept at puncturing the pretensions of his various 
rock personas, including the “iconic bandana and pumped muscles” of his 
Born in the USA days. “Looking back on those photos now, I look simply .
 . . gay.”<br>
<br>
If there’s a design flaw in “Born to Run’’ it has to do with the 
inherent arc of the celebrity memoir. It’s simply not as bracing to read
 in the final third of the book about Springsteen’s later years, the 
cosseted life of fame in which he jams with the Stones and sups with the
 Sinatras.<br>
<br>
Nor is he especially adept at describing his creative process. “I went 
to the beach and wrote ‘Spirit in the Night,’ came home, busted out my 
rhyming dictionary and wrote ‘Blinded by the Light.’ ”<br>
<br>
Right.<br>
<br>
Those who come to “Born to Run’’ eager for salacious details will find 
few. For instance, his first marriage, in 1985, to actress Julianne 
Phillips, who was 11 years his junior, merits just a few pages. The only
 real revelation is that Springsteen has suffered severe bouts of 
depression and taken medication for the past 15 years. He has even dealt
 with erectile dysfunction. (Gasp!) None of this ranks as a shock given 
his father’s persistent mental illness.<br>
<br>
Where Springsteen soars — both as musician and writer — is in his 
ability to bear witness, not only to his own inner life but to the lives
 of those left behind in the post-industrial wastelands of this nation. 
Springsteen made it out of Freehold, but he never turned away from the 
“grinding hypnotic power” of the place and its people.<br>
<br>
“Born to Run’’ documents the unlikely rise of a rocker hellbent not on 
escape, but on reckoning with the moral failings of the world he was 
born into.<br>
<br>
“Dread — the sense that things might not work out, that the moral high 
ground had been swept out from underneath us, that the dream we had of 
ourselves had somehow been tainted and the future would be forever 
uninsured — was in the air,” he observes. “This was the new lay of the 
land, and if I was going to put my characters out on that highway, I was
 going to have to put all these things in the car with them.”<br>
<br>
Never has a boy prophet written words more timely.<br>

Review: Bruce Springsteen's Memoir Is Exhilarating Epic We Need<br>
In new book 'Born to Run,' Springsteen opens up about childhood, womanizing, endless tours and the band he's had for 40 years<br>
<br>
ROLLING STONE<br>
ROB SHEFFIELD<br>
</strong><br>
The summer of 1984: Bruce Springsteen has just dropped Born In The 
U.S.A., blowing him up from superstar to mega-hyper-uberstar. "Dancing 
in the Dark" is a Number One smash. He and his longtime lieutenant Steve
 Van Zandt decide to celebrate with a trip to Disneyland. Except they 
get thrown out for refusing to take off their bandannas. As Springsteen 
explains, "This, say the powers that be, is so he will not be 
misidentified as a gang member, Blood or Crip, and fall victim to a 
drive-by while hurling his cookies on Space Mountain. Steven's bandanna 
is neither red nor blue but an indeterminate hue, chosen carefully and 
precisely to complement the rest of his 'look' by the man who invented 
the male babushka." They huff off to Knott's Berry Farm instead – but 
can't get in there either. So they give up and head to a fancy 
restaurant, where being famous means they can get a table in full 
rock-god drag. No retreat, baby; no surrender.<br>
<br>
It's a typically bizarre and delightful moment from an utterly unique, 
endlessly exhilarating, last-chance-power-drive of a memoir. Like a 
Springsteen show, Born To Run goes on forever – five hundred pages, no 
index – and leaves you worn out, yet fiending for one more 
one-two-three-four. He began writing it on and off seven years ago, for 
his own amusement, and dropped on the world as a surprise to cap a year 
of triumphant touring. Born To Run is not the Bruce Springsteen story 
–it's another chapter in the lifelong story he's kept telling for nearly
 50 years, onstage and on wax, in his songs and between them, all over 
his interviews and liner notes and guitar solos. The tone is loose and 
rambling, full of all-caps punch lines and the exclamation points of a 
dad who loves to text. He skips over many of his best tales just because
 he's already told them elsewhere. He goes light on the Hopes-'n'-Dreams
 talk. This book is a guy telling stories to himself, trying to figure 
his deepest questions out.<br>
<br>
Born To Run digs into how this most ostensibly down-to-earth of rock 
stars still seems so maddeningly mysterious, so unfathomably complex, 
still driving himself and his band to keep topping themselves night 
after night. A few weeks ago in Jersey, I saw three marathon shows – 
four hours a pop – all beginning with the epic "NYC Serenade," complete 
with string section. What kind of Captain-Ahab-times-James-Brown madness
 lashes a mortal man to put himself through this, knowing full well the 
crowd would be satisfied with 99-and-a-half percent? It turns out Bruce 
Springsteen doesn't quite understand either. That's why this book 
exists.<br>
<br>
He goes deep on his childhood, in a blue-collar Jersey family of tough 
Italian women and brooding Irish men. His father looms largest over the 
book – a bitter, hostile, silent man who kept his solitary vigil every 
night drinking beer alone in the dark at the kitchen table. His 
"six-pack seances" still haunt his son, who's spent his life trying to 
shake off that shadow. As he explains, "My mother would read romance 
novels and swoon to the latest hits on the radio. My dad would go so far
 as to explain to me that love songs on the radio were part of a 
government ploy to get you to marry and pay taxes." The lights truly 
come on for Bruce in 1964, when he flips for "The Beatles…The 
Beatles…The Beatles…an 'ain't no sin to be glad you're alive' mantra and
 simultaneously the worst and most glorious band name in all of rock 
&amp; roll history."<br>
<br>
Springsteen stakes his claim on that history in the 1970s, when he and 
his E Street compadres hit the big time. He goes into the whole tale, 
from his workaholic studio habits to his tax problems: "Some 
enterprising young man at the IRS must have seen those Time and Newsweek
 covers and said, 'Who is this guy?' The answer was, he was a guy who'd 
never paid a single penny in income taxes his whole life." He also 
describes his decades of therapy and periodic struggles with depression.
 "I was crushed between [ages] 60 and 62, good for a year and out again 
from 63 to 64," Springsteen writes. "The only thing that would lift the 
burden was 100-plus on two wheels or other distressing things," aside 
from "my trustiest form of self-medication, touring."<br>
<br>
He's hilariously blunt about his cluelessness when it comes to the 
sex-and-drugs part of the sacred trinity. His dad's boozing scared him 
away from drugs, and when it comes to groupies, he might just have liked
 women too much (still a very underrated element of his legend). In the 
1980s, he admits, "I figured now was the time to take advantage of the 
sexual perks of superstardom." As he says, "Wilt Chamberlain would not 
have to start looking over his shoulder any time soon but at the 
beginning of the USA tour I decided to…see. So….I saw." When his first 
marriage ends in divorce, he goes to his folks' house to break the news.
 While driving him back to the airport, his dad says, "Bruce, maybe you 
should move back home for a while." At first this pisses him off: "I was
 tempted to mention that I was a nearly 40-year-old self-made 
multimillionaire and the prospect of moving back into an eight-by-12 
room in my parents' house, still holding my stuffed Mickey Mouse, 
was…not impossible, but not likely." Yet the moment still strikes him, 
all these years later: "The old man finally wanted me around the house."<br>
<br>
Like so many adult children of alcoholics, Springsteen bends over 
backwards to avoid conflict, so it's no surprise he doesn't punch down. 
He labors to find a kind word for everybody here, even when they're 
suing him or kicking his ass in a brawl – Born To Run could be the exact
 spiritual opposite of the new Mike Love memoir. Even his infamous high 
school principal – you know the one, the man who banned him from 
graduation because of his long hair – is now "a basically good guy." It 
pains him to go into any detail about the "mild grudges" that broke up 
the E Street Band for ten years. But unsurprisingly, Clarence Clemons 
stars in many of the funniest stories: "Clarence once mentioned to me 
during a negotiation that he should be paid not only for playing but for
 being Clarence."<br>
<br>
He describes the weird wilderness years after Tunnel of Love, when he 
fired his band and drifted to Hollywood. At one point in the Nineties, 
when the rock world figured he'd gone into an unannounced retirement, he
 finds himself and his wife Patti Scialfa attending Frank Sinatra's 
eightieth birthday dinner, singing jazz standards at the piano with the 
odd trio of Steve Lawrence, Eydie Gormé and Bob Dylan. In one of the 
funniest and most touching chapters, he takes his then-teenage son Evan 
to see his favorite band, Against Me! ("Vicious-sounding punk music," to
 dad's ears.) He drives Evan to the show, hangs in a side bar with the 
other parents, then manages to impress his son when the band's bassist 
shows off the Bruce tattoos on his arms – including a whole verse of 
"Badlands." For once, Bruce Springsteen gets to feel like the cool dad. 
As he admits, "My kids didn't know 'Badlands' from matzoh ball soup."<br>
<br>
With Springsteen there are always the twin giant questions of how and 
why. How does he keep doing what only he can do – and what nobody else 
has learned to copy? And why does he burn to keep re-conquering his 
mountaintop, proving it all night at four hours a shot? How, he can't 
explain – he doesn't claim to get it either. (Sure, he lifts weights, 
but the world is full of middle-aged gym rats and you don't see them 
leading 60,000 voices in "Thunder Road" after midnight in your local 
football stadium.) The why is a trickier question, and that's the one 
that dominates this book. Springsteen has lots of questions about what 
fuels him – emotional neediness, obsessive-compulsive hubris, the fact 
that he just comes alive onstage. "There, strangely enough, exposed in 
front of thousands, I've always felt perfectly safe, just to let it all 
go. That's why at our shows you can't get rid of me." That's what makes 
Born To Run so fascinating – he can't get rid of himself either.</div>

	The LA TIMES<br>
Randy Lewis<br>
<br>
SEPTEMBER 24, 2016<br>
</strong><br>
Anyone who has ever experienced the uniquely soul-stirring&nbsp;amalgam 
of musical celebration, spiritual rejuvenation, intellectual provocation
 and physical release-to-the-point-of-exhaustion that is a concert by 
Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band will feel right at home in the
 508 pages of “Born to Run” his 67-years&nbsp;(as of 
Friday)-in-the-making autobiography.<br>
<br>
On the most superficial level,&nbsp;this richly rewarding rock tome 
could be subtitled “The Collected and Expanded Between-Song Sermons.” 
That’s how integral&nbsp;to his fabled marathon performances over the 
last 40-plus years are his ripped-from-New-Jersey-life fables of 
spirit-shaping&nbsp;battles with his father, his comradeship with his 
bandmates, his fitful attempts to unravel the mysteries of love and, 
binding them all together, his DNA-deep passion for music, specially 
that strain called rock ’n’ roll.<br>
<br>
<br>
Throughout his career, the once scrawny kid who was born in Long Branch,
 N.J., and grew up in nearby Freehold, has relied on music as a source 
of&nbsp;inspiration, a platform for understanding the world around him 
and a forum for&nbsp;self-examination and expression.<br>
All of those qualities serve this Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee 
beautifully in a&nbsp;book that illuminates&nbsp;not just the career, 
but the full-bodied life of one of pop music’s most valuable artists.<br>
<br>
It’s alternately brutally honest, philosophically deep, stabbingly funny and, perhaps most important, refreshingly humble.<br>
We’re told on the book jacket that his 2009 performance at the Super 
Bowl was what started him writing, specifically about that show and what
 it meant to him at the time.<br>
“Since the inception of our band,” he writes late in the book about his 
group’s&nbsp;performance at the event that typically draws the largest 
global audience of any other, “it’s been our ambition to play for 
everyone. We’ve achieved a lot, but we haven’t achieved that.<br>
<br>
“Our audience remains tribal...that is, predominantly white. On 
occasion,” he notes, “I looked out and sang ‘Promised Land’ to the 
audience I intended it for: young people, old people, black, white, 
brown, cutting across religious and class lines. That’s who I’m singing 
to today.”<br>
<br>
It’s been his hubris from the outset that Springsteen believed to his 
soul that he had something to offer to the world; and his supreme gift 
that he fought and scraped his way onto stages across the globe to 
realize that dream.<br>
<br>
Given his Catholic upbringing, it’s fitting that&nbsp;the book is 
divided into three parts, his own literary Holy Trinity, as he lays out 
his life story essentially in chronological order.<br>
“In Catholicism, there existed the poetry, danger and darkness that 
reflected my imagination and my inner self. I found a land of great and 
harsh beauty, of fantastic stories, of unimaginable punishment and 
infinite reward. It was a glorious and pathetic place I was either 
shaped for or fit right into,” he writes early on. “This was the world 
where I found the beginnings of my song.”<br>
<br>
Book One is titled “Growin’ Up,” recounting his early family life and 
apprenticeship as a budding musician; Book Two, “Born to Run,” continues
 with&nbsp;his rise to a level of fame and fortune he probably did 
conceive, but only in his wildest dreams, and Book Three, “Living 
Proof,” looks&nbsp;into adult&nbsp;life as one of pop music’s biggest 
stars, and the often diametrically opposed realities of his on- and 
offstage lives.<br>
<br>
Unapologetic rock ’n’ roller that he is at heart, Springsteen often 
crafts&nbsp;chapters like good pop songs — most take just three or four 
minutes to finish, there are catchy hooks and typically snappy endings, 
usually with a grain of life’s truth dropped in along the way.<br>
<br>
His book offers none of the surreal flights of imagination found 
in&nbsp;Bob Dylan’s unconventional 2004 memoir “Chronicles, Vol. 1” or 
Neil Young’s 2012 self-narrative, “Waging Heavy Peace.” And where Elvis 
Costello took readers on a trip through the formative events of his life
 processed through the filter of his formidable intellect in last year’s
 highly engaging “Unfaithful Music &amp; Disappearing Ink,” Springsteen 
speaks predominantly and most powerfully from the heart, and his gut.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
What emerges unequivocally is&nbsp;his almost singled-minded devotion 
not to scoring hits, or finding fame and fortune, but&nbsp;to creating a
 body of&nbsp;music that matters.<br>
“Born to Run” also goes well beyond frequently illuminating analysis of 
his career ambitions, and the successful and unsuccessful execution of 
those aims to paint a picture of a full-rounded life, with all its rough
 edges, bruised and battered relationships and another theme that’s been
 ongoing in his music:&nbsp;the redemption that’s possible to those who 
seek and are willing to sacrifice for it.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
At the core of this story is his combative relationship with his 
father,&nbsp;Doug Springsteen, whom he describes&nbsp;sitting night 
after night in the kitchen of their&nbsp;working-class 
household&nbsp;puffing on a cigarette and sucking down beers until he 
would unpredictably, but frequently, explode at the nearest target of 
his outrage, which often was his only son.<br>
<br>
“My dad’s desire to engage with me almost always came after the nightly 
religious ritual of the ‘sacred six-pack,’” Springsteen writes. “One 
beer after another in the pitch dark of our kitchen. It was always then 
that he wanted to see me and it was always the same. A few moments of 
feigned parental concern for my well-being followed by the real deal: 
the hostility and raw anger toward his son, the only other man in the 
house. It was a shame,” Springsteen writes evenhandedly. “He loved me 
but he couldn’t stand me.”<br>
The power in Springsteen’s book emerges from his steadfast refusal 
simply to create villains who embody the antagonistic forces he railed 
against as a youth — something every adolescent feels at one time or 
another. He transcends the bitterness that could have consumed him 
through&nbsp;an honest curiosity about the life forces&nbsp;that shaped 
his father, and a real wish not to let the sins of the father become 
those of the son.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is chasing truth and understanding — not scapegoats.&nbsp;<br>
With active, objective exploration as his guiding principle, Springsteen
 comes to the conclusion that “I haven’t been completely fair to my 
father in my songs, treating him as an archetype of the neglecting, 
domineering parent. It was an ‘East of Eden’ recasting of our 
relationship, a way of ‘universalizing’ my childhood experience. Our 
story is much more complicated. Not in the details of what happened, but
 in the ‘why’ of it all.”<br>
Perhaps the most poignant moment, among many he shares, is their 
reconciliation, years after his father and mother, Adele, had quit New 
Jersey and started a new life across the country, with his younger 
sister, Pam, in San Mateo, Calif.<br>
<br>
He recounts a visit from his father, who was increasingly 
battling&nbsp;various illnesses, yet still made the drive from the Bay 
Area to see his now-famous son in Los Angeles.<br>
“Bruce, you’ve been very good to us,” the elder Springsteen tells his 
son, “and I wasn’t very good to you,” to which 
Bruce&nbsp;responds:&nbsp;“You did the best you could.”<br>
“That was it,” Springsteen writes. “It was all I needed, all that was necessary.”&nbsp;<br>
Although he reveals&nbsp;that&nbsp;much of this inner and outer-world 
analysis grew out of psychological counseling he underwent as an adult, 
the book also gives us a vivid picture of just how crucial music was as a
 life-renewing force for him.<br>
<br>
“I began to feel the empowerment the instrument and my work were 
bringing me,” he says about wood-shedding his guitar chops. “I had a 
secret … there was something I could do, something I might be good at. I
 fell asleep at night with dreams of rock ’n’ roll glory in my head.”<br>
Perhaps it’s the classic Catholic guilt at work, but Springsteen comes 
off admirably&nbsp;generous in recounting disagreements and outright 
betrayals that he’s been involved with along the way with family 
members, friends, bandmates, girlfriends (who remain largely unnamed), 
business associates, his first wife — actress Julianne Phillips&nbsp;— 
and his second —&nbsp;&nbsp;singer and songwriter Patti Scialfa, the 
mother of their three children.<br>
He wisely avoides&nbsp;the descent into vitriol that sank Creedence 
Clearwater Revival front man John Fogerty’s autobiography “Fortune Son: 
My Life, My Music.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Instead, he takes his rightful&nbsp;lumps for numerous transgressions, 
such as&nbsp;disbanding the venerated E Street Band in the 
late&nbsp;1980s, after the peak of his massive popularity with the “Born
 in the U.S.A.” album. An inevitable process of an autobiography, of 
course, is that we get only his side of those disagreements, as 
equitable as he is in relating them.<br>
He barely touches on the hurt he caused “The Big Man,” saxophonist 
Clarence Clemons, who freely expressed in his own interviews his pain at
 being told by “The Boss” that the E Street Band was being mothballed so
 he could explore other musical situations. His subsequent meditation on
 Clemons’ death in 2011 is a masterpiece of love and empathy.<br>
Springsteen has an honest out for his frequent invocation of the better 
part of valor, noting toward the book’s end, “I haven’t told you ‘all’ 
about myself. Discretion and the feelings of others don’t allow it. But 
in a project like this, the writer has made one promise: to show the 
reader his mind. In these pages I’ve tried to do that.”<br>
For the super faithful, he has supplied a wealth of insight into the 
creation of many of his greatest songs and albums. (The impression he 
leaves&nbsp;about the song “Born to Run” is that it probably was 
inspired more by his parents’ wish to pull out of their town full of 
losers than Bruce’s.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The relative lack of commentary on middling mid-career works such as 
“Lucky Town” and “Human Touch” likely tells us what we need to know 
about his thoughts on those.<br>
He&nbsp;incorporates thoughts about&nbsp;his two sons, Evan and Sam, and
 daughter, Jessica, while&nbsp;wife Patti fulfills the role of 
near-saintly&nbsp;best friend, lover, muse and life partner, although 
it’s not hard to want to hear more about how those roles have fed, or 
derailed, her own musical ambitions, which are left for someone else’s 
book.<br>
Structurally, “Born to Run”&nbsp;flows elegantly and effectively for the
 most part. One exception is his&nbsp;chapter about the family’s 
entrance into the world of high-end equestrian life because of daughter 
Jessica’s passion for horses. It feels&nbsp;awkward, almost 
trivial,&nbsp;coming immediately after his eloquently moving chapter 
about the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and his musical response 
to that world-jolting event.<br>
<br>
A sage no less than Socrates famously observed, “The unexamined life is 
not worth living.” A more modern corollary also suggests&nbsp;that “The 
unlived life is not worth examining.”<br>
Bruce Springsteen proves that he has taken on life fully engaged both in
 living and examining it, and in doing so, he’s delivered&nbsp;a story 
as profoundly inspiring as his best music.</div>

				<div class="content">[<strong class="text-strong">Sunday Times Interview: Bruce Springsteen, rock god and American icon</strong><br>
<em class="text-italics">“My fear is that Trump is moving the country beyond democracy into mob rule”</em><br>
<br>
It may come as a surprise to learn that Bruce Springsteen, a man whose 
lyrics paint gritty portraits of blue-collar American life, hasn’t done a
 week’s worth of manual labour in his life, and felt a fraud when he 
started performing in working-man’s clothes. Not only that, but he 
describes himself in his new autobiography as an “insecure, weird and 
skinny white boy” who, as a child, was teased about a nervous twitch and
 acne.<br>
<br>
The book, called Born to Run, is a marathon read to match his marathon 
stage shows — it took seven years to write. When it is published this 
week there will be few sharp intakes of breath among dockers and 
lumberjacks. If you have shares in bodybuilding gyms, sell them now. 
Just as surprising as his admission to being “soft” is that a man who 
wrote songs such as Tougher Than the Rest and No Surrender should want 
to share his problems with the world. (Or, for that matter, admit that 
he can’t read music.)<br>
<br>
Springsteen says he wrote the book to shake off demons that have haunted
 him for years. He craved the approval of his hard-drinking, 
factory-worker father, hence the way he dressed and his muscly physique.
 His father died in 1998, but it took longer and a lot of psychotherapy 
before Springsteen could jettison his unhappy past. “I was faking it,” 
he explains with a grin and a shake of his head. “I felt like a phoney —
 but at the same time the realest thing you’d ever seen.”<br>
<br>
We’re talking in his backstage dressing room, where Springsteen is 
getting ready for the final show in a 75-concert tour that started in 
January. Wiry, is the word for Springsteen, and sharp. He’s easygoing 
and takes time to answer questions in a measured way.<br>
<br>
His stage outfit is black jeans and a natty waistcoat. The proletarian 
outfit of sleeveless denim jacket and bandana, in which he delivered 
those sinew-straining renditions of Born in the USA, is long gone. He’s 
more minstrel than muscle, these days, and, as it turns out, enjoys 
paddleboarding as much as pumping iron.<br>
<br>
“Those whose love we wanted but could not get, we emulate,” he says in 
the book. “So I, who’d never done a week’s worth of manual labour in my 
life, put on a factory worker’s clothes, my father’s clothes, and went 
to work.” He writes of the bandana phase: “Looking back on these photos 
now, I look simply … gay.”<br>
<br>
Outside the dressing room, crowds are filing into the Gillette Stadium 
in Foxborough, Massachusetts, home of the New England Patriots football 
team, an amphitheatre so vast that when a shower of rain arrives, the 
seats in the upper tiers are lost in low cloud.<br>
<br>
At 67, the Boss still draws audiences of 60,000 and more. This year, he 
overtook Madonna and Beyoncé to top Billboard’s chart of highest earners
 from live performances, with $135m (£104m) revenue from 1.1m tickets 
sold. His shows are longer than ever.<br>
<br>
Not all members of the crowd share his lean physique. In the “pit” — a 
cordoned-off area in front of the stage — some wear XXL-sized T-shirts 
with slogans such as “Burgers, Beer and BRUCE”.<br>
<br>
On the way to the dressing room, I meet some of Springsteen’s road crew;
 burly bodybuilders who affectionately refer to him in his new, trimmer 
form as Bruce Stringsteen. Lest that give the impression that 
Springsteen is unhealthily thin, these are men for whom a normal shape 
means looking as if a sack of baking potatoes has been injected under 
your skin.<br>
<br>
The timing of the book is interesting, coming as it does just ahead of 
the US presidential election. White blue-collar workers — Springsteen’s 
natural constituency — will determine who wins the race for the White 
House. Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, has tried to woo the 
disenchanted, poor, white spit-and-grit vote, proclaiming himself to be 
as one with them. The resounding message of Springsteen’s autobiography 
is: “I’m coming clean about my working-class credentials; you do the 
same.” If it prompts a war of words — Springsteen is a longstanding 
campaigner for the Democrats — then Trump, with his privileged 
upbringing, will have met his match. Springsteen is happy to fire the 
first salvo: “Since the whole story of ‘Mexicans are rapists’, he 
[Trump] has been in the business of stirring up hate. His favourite 
thing now is that the election is gonna be rigged. In other words, if he
 doesn’t win, whoever does win is illegitimate. He has a lot of 
followers out there. You tell them that their government is 
illegitimate, I personally don’t know what some of them might do. My 
fear is that he is moving the country beyond democracy into more of a 
mob rule.”<br>
<br>
He’s accusing Trump in no uncertain terms of being a threat to the 
republic. “It’s not even malevolence, it’s just through sheer stupidity.
 I don’t think he understands the forces that are in society that can 
get let loose, and you can’t put the genie back in the bottle. By his 
language, by the way he approaches his rallies, he’s given people 
freedom to say things that previously they may have been ashamed to do.”<br>
<br>
As for Trump’s idea of building a wall between the United States and Mexico, he says: “That’s a stupid idea.”<br>
<br>
At times, his book reads more like a political manifesto than a rock 
history. “This is America,” he writes. “The prescription for many of our
 ills is at hand — child day-care, jobs, education, healthcare. If we 
can spend trillions on Iraq and Afghanistan in nation-building, if we 
can bail out Wall Street with billions of taxpayers’ dollars, why not 
here? Why not now?”<br>
<br>
Is the autobiography a prelude to him entering politics? By disclosing 
his demons — depression, imposter-syndrome and self-doubt — in the way 
that he has, he’s denied potential opponents the chance to rake up 
scandal from his past. Springsteen shakes his head, insisting that being
 a politician is “the one single job that I would never want — and I’d 
be lousy at it”.<br>
<br>
Yet there is no doubt that the man who has sold more than 120m albums 
has the power to sway the electorate. He has done so already on issues 
where his views run counter to those of many working-class voters — 
rights for the LGBT community, for example. On gun control, too, his 
views are out of kilter with those of many of his fans, but that doesn’t
 stop him airing them. Sandy Hook school, where 26 schoolchildren and 
staff were shot dead in 2012, is not far from the 380-acre farm where 
Springsteen now lives. Adam Lanza, a 20-year-old with a history of 
mental illness, used a military-style semi-automatic rifle to carry out 
the killings. Springsteen wants the weapons banned.<br>
<br>
“Obviously, from the outside, America looks like a madhouse on this 
particular issue. And it looks like that from the inside. I can 
understand [wanting guns]. We live on a farm, we have guns. We have 
shotguns and some pistols, and we target shoot and we skeet shoot. 
No-one is talking about those weapons as being under threat. It’s these 
new, military-style combat rifles that are available to anybody in the 
United States that are really frightening. I don’t understand the need 
to have them. I’ve shot them myself. They are not sporting weapons. It’s
 very, very distressing and the NRA [National Rifle Association] has 
been very powerful in squashing any attempt to even minutely do anything
 about it.”<br>
<br>
There’s a knock at the dressing room door. The countdown has started for
 Springsteen to go on stage. In the stadium seats, families have 
gathered to watch the show: grandparents of Springsteen’s age, along 
with their children and grandchildren. As Springsteen points out, when 
you’ve been making records for more than 40 years, your music represents
 the soundtrack to many people’s lives. They look at the band on stage 
and see “themselves, their lives, their friends, looking back at them”.<br>
<br>
It’s time for him to get ready, but he wants to go on talking. He pauses
 when asked about his own mental illness. For years, he relied on 
antidepressants and still has lapses.<br>
<br>
“Depression will steal your life. It will take it right out from 
underneath you by the things you do. You’re under its sway. So 
psychopharmacology, for me and for my father, was very, very helpful. 
Would I have been able to hold things together [otherwise]? I don’t 
know. Without it, it’s much easier for things to come apart. So I kinda 
got to it at the right time. It restabilised my chemistry and 
personality and gave me my life back, which was slipping away between my
 fingers due to the fact that I couldn’t control my anxieties and my 
neuroses.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s is the classic rock star’s angst, but turned up to 11. 
Reading the more introspective chapters of his book, you wonder whether 
he may have spent too long on the psychiatrist’s couch. He agonises over
 the fact that he didn’t fight in Vietnam (he was excused military 
service because of concussion from a motorbike accident). It was not 
enough, apparently, that the drummer of his first band was killed in 
combat. “I wonder who went in my place and what happened to them,” he 
reflects in one passage.<br>
<br>
Then there’s his voice, surely one of the most distinctive and soulful 
in rock music. That’s not how he sees it: “My voice: I don’t have much 
of one.” And: “My voice was never going to win any prizes.”<br>
<br>
He’s unable even to give himself due credit for his legendary 
three-hour-plus shows, concluding that his need to deliver extended 
performances is a display of “manic insecurity”.<br>
<br>
The clues lie in his troubled upbringing, starting at school where he 
was picked on by staff and pupils. He had his “tie pulled till I choked,
 [was] struck on the head, shut into a dark closet and stuffed into a 
trash can while being told this was where I belonged. All business as 
usual in Catholic school in the Fifties.”<br>
<br>
His father said “fewer than 1,000 words” to him through most of his 
childhood, he says in the book. “He loved me, but he couldn’t stand me. 
He felt we competed for my mother’s affections.”<br>
<br>
When he was 19, Springsteen’s parents moved to California, leaving him 
to fend for himself with only his guitar-playing skills to eke out a 
living. In search of a substitute family, and inspired by the Beatles 
and the Rolling Stones, he fell in with footloose musicians and taught 
himself piano and harmonica — but never to read music. He found an 
audience in the clubs along the New Jersey Shore, playing with small 
bands like Earth, Steel Mill and Dr Zoom &amp; The Sonic Boom. He stood 
out for his single-mindedness. While his bandmates took part-time jobs, 
he preferred to play for just a few dollars, or go hungry.<br>
<br>
Always hard up, he slept on friends’ floors, in an old surfboard factory
 and sometimes on the beach. On one occasion he couldn’t afford the $1 
tunnel toll to get to New York to pick up an advance from his agent. He 
was forced to siphon fuel to keep the band’s truck on the road and got 
around by hitch-hiking, standing for hours by the side of the road in 
freezing New Jersey winters.<br>
<br>
Playing hundreds of gigs, he learnt early how to please crowds — by 
getting girls to dance (the boys would follow). The secret was to “play 
until they liked it, until they could hear it. Once the girls started to
 dance, everybody got happy,” he writes. It’s these stories that make 
the book a lively and sometimes joyful rock memoir, providing light 
relief from the darker times.<br>
<br>
He’s discreet about past affairs, revealing coyly that his first proper 
sexual encounter was with an unnamed girl who inspired one of his most 
famous songs. “Rosalita was my musical autobiography — a sweet blonde 
who I believe was the first gal I successfully had sexual intercourse 
with.”<br>
<br>
He got signed to Columbia records, but after lacklustre sales of his 
first two albums record executives hoped Springsteen and his bandmates 
would give up and “crawl back into the swamps of Jersey”, not realising 
“they were dealing with men without homes, lives, any practicable skills
 or talents that could bring a reliable pay cheque in the straight 
world”.<br>
<br>
Even after the success of Born to Run, his third album, from which the 
autobiography takes its name, he was still broke from paying agents’ 
fees and other bills. “Almost a decade after being signed to Columbia, 
several million-selling albums and extensive touring, I had but $20,000 
to my name,” he writes.<br>
<br>
When the money finally started rolling in from his bestselling album, 
Born in the USA, his angst wouldn’t let him enjoy it. “I used to see my 
rock heroes enjoying their great fortunes and say, ‘Damn, I can’t wait 
till I get there.’ Then, when they got there … so much of the … 
materialism of rock’n’roll felt naked and without purpose for me.”<br>
<br>
His disillusionment surfaced in a failed first marriage to Julianne 
Phillips, a west-coast model. Speaking about the 1989 break-up — the 
first time he’s done so publicly — he says: “I’ve tended to be pretty 
private over the years and Julianne is too. It was a very painful 
episode for the two of us and she’s a fantastic woman. What was going on
 inside of me at that time, that was making our relationship very 
difficult.”<br>
<br>
He credits psychotherapy and medication with bringing him some calm and 
stability, together with his marriage since 1991 to Patti Scialfa, a 
fellow New Jersey native and vocalist with the E Street band. He 
proposed to her one day, on impulse, outside a New York diner, 
fashioning a makeshift ring from a twig plucked from a roadside bush. He
 smiles at the memory. “It was kinda spur of the moment. I didn’t have a
 ring. Things just felt very good that afternoon, and that’s where we 
were going. So I just left the diner and there was a small bush and we 
went over to a bench that we always sat on and I said, well, I might as 
well do this now.”<br>
<br>
Having children was a blessing, he says, and while he would “never lay 
claim to the title Father of the Year”, he has worked hard to spare his 
daughter and two sons from the turmoil that he suffered as a child. He’s
 clear that as far as children are concerned, you are their audience, 
not the other way round. “Rule: when you’re on tour, you’re king, when 
you’re home, you’re not,” he writes. Sam is a fireman, having dropped 
out of college. Jessica, the most like him in temperament, has earned 
recognition as a showjumper. Sponsored by luxury brands, she rubs 
shoulders with the international equestrian elite. Evan, his eldest son,
 is a programme director for a radio station and a festival producer. 
Springsteen says his relationship with him “held its own complications”.
 He worried that Evan was veering into “vicious-sounding” punk, and 
rejecting Springsteen’s music because “it was the family business”.<br>
<br>
Reconciliation came when Evan took his father to see his favourite punk 
band, and discovered that the guitarist was such a Springsteen fan, he 
had a portrait of the Boss tattooed on his arm.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s personal wealth is estimated at between $200m and $345m. 
“I live high on the hog, yacht around the Mediterranean and 
private-plane myself between dental appointments,” he says in the book. 
As well as his farm, there is a seafront home in Rumson, “the richest, 
most exclusive part of New Jersey”, plus a house in a gated community in
 Florida.<br>
<br>
He gave up living in Los Angeles after the 1994 earthquake. During the 
aftershocks, he called Tommy Mottola, then president of Sony, demanding,
 as only a famous rock star can, that Mottola send a company jet to 
rescue Springsteen and his family. Mottola obeyed. A far cry from 
hitch-hiking, he agrees. Does he enjoy his wealth: “Yes, I do.” Does he 
have a yacht? He laughs, “I do not.” It transpires that he is hosted on 
yachts belonging to the American businessman David Geffen and “another 
friend”.<br>
<br>
The substantial income from his live shows is one reason he keeps 
touring. The other is to keep his demons at bay. “There is something in 
the gathering of souls that blows the blues away [and] lets the sun in,”
 he writes. As long as he’s moving he has a better chance of staying 
ahead of “Churchill’s black dog”. When he’s not on the road with the 
band, he gets astride a customised Harley Softail and guns it along at 
100 miles an hour (“Anything to get [the] dog’s teeth out of my ass”).<br>
<br>
On the day of our interview, he announces a new series of concerts, 
kicking off in Australia in January — summer in the southern hemisphere.
 Those could be the last gigs for a while. The band is in need of a 
rest.<br>
<br>
In recent years, age-related illnesses have taken their toll. Some are 
being held together by miracles of geriatric medicine. Nils Lofgren, 
guitarist, compares the backstage area to a MASH unit, with ice packs, 
heat pads and physiotherapists on hand. Springsteen makes a joking 
reference to their advancing years when announcing the band during his 
shows: “You’ve just seen the heart-stopping, pants dropping, 
house-rocking, earth-quaking, booty-shaking, Viagra-taking, love-making,
 legendary E Street Band.”<br>
<br>
It’s a touch of black humour masking a grim reality. Of the original E 
Street line-up, two are dead — one from melanoma, one from a stroke.<br>
<br>
Springsteen himself had an operation at the Hospital for Special Surgery
 in New York to rebuild discs in his neck before going on tour in 2014, 
after his guitar-playing hand was paralysed by nerve damage. “They knock
 you out, cut an incision into your throat, tie your vocal cords off, 
get in there with a wrench, screwdriver and some titanium, take a chunk 
of bone out of your hip and build you a few new discs,” he writes. He 
couldn’t sing for two “nerve-racking” months.<br>
<br>
He throws himself about the stage less than he used to (though he still 
crowd surfs — against medical advice) and has scaled back his workout 
regime. “I don’t need aerobics, because I burn thousands of calories,” 
he tells me. “On days off, when it feels good, I’ll go [to the gym] and 
move the weights around a little bit from one side of the room to the 
other, and that’s the extent of my fitness regime, along with trying to 
eat reasonably well.” He also swims — “I’m still an old beach bum. I was
 in the ocean yesterday and I’ll be in it till October or November” — 
and paddleboards, even in choppy Atlantic waters.<br>
<br>
He has no intention of retiring, but surely he must slow down. He 
reveals in the book that “probably since my forties, some physical 
problem had come along with every tour. One tour it’s your knee, then 
it’s your back, then tendinitis in your elbow from all the hard 
strumming.” As Indiana Jones remarked, it’s not the years, it’s the 
mileage.<br>
<br>
During his show, he borrows a routine from one of his heroes, James 
Brown, the legendary soul singer. Pretending to collapse from 
exhaustion, he is revived by Steve Van Zandt, his trusty lieutenant and 
guitarist, and stage hands. A cape is draped over his shoulders and he’s
 led back to the microphone as the crowd urges him to carry on. Is there
 a danger, I ask, that one of the paramedics hired to attend an event 
might fail to grasp that it’s part of the act and rush to give 
treatment?<br>
<br>
Springsteen laughs. “It’s happened already,” he says. There are 
safeguards, I’m told later. Crew members — those bodybuilders — are 
alert to the problem and stand ready to pounce on over-eager 
first-aiders.<br>
<br>
Springsteen says he is careful not to push himself beyond his limits. 
His high-water mark is the Rolling Stones — at 73, Mick Jagger, their 
lead singer, is nearly six years his senior. In 2012, nearly half a 
century after a shy, teenage Springsteen played his first guitar solo — 
from the Stones’ hit It’s All Over Now — he finally got to perform with 
his idols. It was one of his proudest moments, he recalls. “To hear 
those riffs come tumbling in and to be with the guys who invented your 
job and who inspired you so deeply, it was very thrilling,” he smiles.<br>
<br>
He sometimes reminds himself that when things seem hard, they are harder
 still for younger musicians. “I wouldn’t want to be trying to come up 
now. It was a golden age when we came along. Because [there’d been] only
 10 or 15 years of rock music, we got to draw on it while it was 
relatively current. We got to see the people who invented the form. We 
played with Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis. I saw Elvis twice. I saw 
John Lee Hooker, Howlin’ Wolf and James Brown.” He pauses, smiling at 
the memory.<br>
<br>
There’s another knock at the door, more urgent this time. The chants of 
the crowd are getting louder and it’s time for him to go. Our hour is 
up. After final checks, he bounds towards the stage. Nearly four 
sweat-drenched hours later, and he’s still rocking.<br>
<br>
In his book, to be published with an accompanying album called Chapter 
and Verse, Springsteen has lifted the curtain on his demons. Is it just 
another cry for attention from a man who admits he is a compulsive 
showman? Maybe, but in America it still takes courage to admit your 
failings.<br>
<br>
Memoirs usually rearrange events to suit the author and downplay their 
shortcomings. Springsteen doesn’t spare himself. What comes across is: 
it’s OK to be a nervous teenager, or an adult with depression. His most 
important message is in the doing, though, not the telling. The 
pensioner on stage says: don’t worry about reaching social security age;
 I’m there ahead of you and I’m still rocking.<br>
<br>
Darkness falls over the home of the New England Patriots. The stadium 
lights come on, but the crowd won’t go home. They want him to play the 
longest concert he has ever played in the US — to match the 4hr 4min 
record he set in Philadelphia earlier this month. He begins to sag; his 
eyes close. A cape saying “The Boss” is draped over his shoulders. 
Slumped on the stage, he looks like an exhausted prizefighter. Hovering 
nervously in the wings is a man with a first-aid bag. He looks around, 
uncertain what to do. Should he rush to help? He glances at a crew 
member, who shakes his head. Then Springsteen is back at the microphone,
 and the music soars. The show must go on — and it does.<br>
<br>
Born to Run is published on Tuesday (Simon &amp; Schuster £20). An 
accompanying album, Chapter and Verse (£10), featuring Springsteen’s 
earliest unreleased recordings, is out now.</div>

September 27<br>
<br>
The timely autobiography of an American mythologist<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is the bard of lost American dreams</strong><br>
<br>
LIKE much great art, Bruce Springsteen’s finest songs transmute the 
particular into the eternal. The more tightly local their focus—those 
boys from the casino dancing with their shirts open in “Sandy”; that 
Tilt-a-Whirl down on the south beach drag—the more universal they 
magically become. As he puts it in “Born to Run”, his new autobiography,
 he sings about “the joy and heartbreak of everyday life”, of humdrum 
defeat and defiance, the pull of home and the road’s allure, familiar 
dichotomies somehow elevated, in his ballads, into a new American 
mythology.<br>
<br>
As “Born to Run” recounts, those songs feel authentic because they are. 
At the heart of his oeuvre, and of his book, is his painful relationship
 with his father, a sometime pool shark whom, as a child, Mr Springsteen
 fetched from bars in Freehold, New Jersey for his long-suffering 
mother, and whom he once hit with a baseball bat to protect her. He 
records their wars over his lengthening hair, which culminate in 
Springsteen senior calling in a barber when his son is incapacitated by a
 motorbike accident; the silences and boozing; but also his unexpected, 
curt relief when Bruce fails his army medical (“That’s good”), and the 
old man’s crumpled awe when his son produces the Oscar he won for 
“Philadelphia” (“I’ll never tell anybody what to do ever again”). Mr 
Springsteen explains how he tried to dodge his inheritance of 
self-destruction and depression, treating the latter with counselling, 
pills and the self-administered therapy of music. “I’m a repairman,” he 
says of his craft.<br>
<br>
<br>
His mother rented him his first guitar after, aged seven, he saw Elvis, 
“a Saturday night jukebox Dionysus”, on “The Ed Sullivan Show”. Theirs 
was a house without hot water or a phone, in a neighbourhood of other 
Irish-Italian families where “I never saw a man leave...in a jacket and 
tie unless it was Sunday or he was in trouble.” The family scavenged 
radios for his grandfather to repair and sell to migrant labourers. He 
hitchhiked with “every sort of rube, redneck, responsible citizen and 
hell-raiser the Jersey Shore had to offer”. A grandmother smothered him 
with “horrible unforgettable boundary-less love”; Catholicism imbued a 
spirit of rebellion and a faith that “walked alongside me as a waking 
dream my whole life”. In the end, for all the young men busting out of 
town in his lyrics, it was his parents who left him, moving to 
California in 1969 when he was 19. His younger sister Virginia, a new 
mother, also stayed in Jersey. Soon, though, he too rides out of 
Freehold, perched in the dark on an old couch on the bed of a truck.<br>
<br>
In these passages the formula of his success begins to crystallise: a 
dark alchemy of indulgence and neglect, “the fifties blue-collar world 
and sixties social experience”, freedom and hardship. He slept in a 
surfboard factory and sometimes on the beach. This was the Vietnam era: 
an early drummer was killed by mortar fire, a manager mutilated a toe to
 avoid the draft. All those tensions, plus a staggering work ethic. His 
bands played “firemen’s fairs, carnivals, drive-ins, supermarket 
openings and hole-in-the-walls”, plus countless bars where fistfights 
and police raids were common. He understood his limits (“My voice was 
never going to win any prizes”), but knew and honed his talents, namely 
songwriting and live performance.<br>
<br>
He laid down the law to wayward band members and predatory managers. 
“The buck would stop here,” he decided, “if I could make one.” After a 
long apprenticeship, an American picaresque that encompassed a flop in 
California, he was signed by Columbia Records. The album “Born to Run” 
made him a star. “Born in the USA” launched him into the stratosphere.<br>
<br>
Last chance power-drive <br>
<br>
The origin of poetry, thought William Wordsworth, was emotion 
recollected in tranquillity. That motto describes both the content of Mr
 Springsteen’s book and the appeal of his songs, many of which look back
 on youthful traumas from a mature perspective and for older audiences. 
These days many in their ranks are as mature as Mr Springsteen himself, 
who at 67 continues to crowd-surf his way through three-hour shows. “The
 exit in a blaze of glory”, he writes of other rockers’ early 
combustions, “is bullshit.”<br>
<br>
The stories his songs tell, though, have not aged: on the contrary. His 
great theme is “the distance between the American dream and American 
reality”. He is the bard of deindustrialisation, of dreams murdered, 
escapes thwarted and accomplished, fates mastered and predetermined, and
 factories closed, such as the rug mill where his father once worked in 
Freehold, a place, in his memory, defined by the stink of its furnaces. 
“Lately there ain’t been much work,” he sings timelessly in “The River”,
 an ode to his sister’s struggles, “on account of the economy.”<br>
<br>
The race and class fissures that today seem so urgent rend his 
characters’ lives along with this slow-motion economic blight. The 
landscape of his youth, and of his music, has the peculiar worldliness 
that American parochialism can grittily contain: in the cults and tribes
 of the Jersey shore, the college-bound “rah-rahs” who spat at him at a 
beachside gig, the leather-clad “greasers”, all those toughs and crooks,
 the ethnic tensions and race riots. In his book, as occasionally in his
 lyrics, he writes frankly about race, though his deepest statements on 
it were made in the make-up of his band, his partnership with Clarence 
Clemons, his long-time black saxophonist—relations with his bandmates 
are chronicled like Platonic romances—and above all in his sound, which 
blends R&amp;B and soul with folk, country and rock.<br>
<br>
People come to rock concerts, Mr Springsteen writes, “to be reminded of 
something they already know and feel.” That the problems America faces 
are old ones is among the consoling reminders of his albums and his 
book. More than that, though, they model an alternative response—one in 
which blue-collar woes are recognised and honoured by the white-collar 
fans Mr Springsteen has always attracted, the millions who chant 
“Thunder Road” despite never having encountered the skeleton frame of a 
burned-out Chevrolet. That transformation of the particular into the 
universal, experience into art, is also a spell that turns difference 
into compassion. It is a lesson in empathy for artists of all kinds, and
 not only artists.</div>

REVIEW OF BORN TO RUN<br>
RODDY DOYLE<br>
SEPTEMBER 27, 2016<br>
<br>
Born to Run by Bruce Springsteen review: Darkness on the edge of genius</strong><br>
<br>
Springsteen is one of the great short story writers, says Roddy Doyle. 
At his wildest he is Damon Runyon; at his very best he’s Raymond Carver<br>
<br>
Born to Run is often great fun – Bruce Springsteen was writing about 
cars before he could drive one. But it is the tension between the fun 
and the burden of his rearing and, especially, his relationship with his
 father, that gives the book its real power. Photograph: Reuters/Eloy 
Alonso<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is one of the great short story writers. I decided 
that when I was 16 and listening to his record, The Wild, the Innocent 
and the E Street Shuffle for the first, second, third, fourth times; 
when I’d started to read fiction seriously, when I knew that I was 
changing, somehow, as I read The Third Policeman, Catch 22 and 
Dubliners. Songs from his later records, especially Darkness on the Edge
 of Town and Nebraska, confirmed that impression. Springsteen is a 
writer. I compare most musicians to other musicians, composers to other 
composers. But Dylan, Springsteen, Patti Smith and a few others – I 
compare these people to the great writers, their songs to novels and 
stories. At his wildest Springsteen is Damon Runyon; at his very best 
he’s Raymond Carver.<br>
Dylan, with Chronicles: Volume One, and Smith, with Just Kids, have written great autobiographies. Has Springsteen?<br>
Maybe.<br>
<br>
There’s a great book inside this book, and it isn’t hiding. It’s there 
to be read and it’s wonderful. When he writes about his music, playing 
it, recording it, composing it, the book is terrific. He writes about 
each album as if it’s a plot to be worked out, a cast of characters to 
be brought to life, and one central character to carry the story that 
runs through the songs.<br>
He captures the excitement and anxiety, the novelty of recording and 
playing, the labour, the tension, the ideas that produced the songs that
 became the soundtrack to millions of lives. He knew what he was good at
 but doubt and self-loathing were constant presences. He listened to a 
master of the album, Born to Run: “All I could hear was what I perceived
 as the record’s flaws. The bombastic big rock sound, the 
Jersey-Pavarotti-via-Roy-Orbison singing, the same things that gave it 
its beauty, power and magic. It was a puzzle; it seemed you couldn’t 
have one without the other.”<br>
<br>
The book is often great fun – he was writing about cars before he could 
drive one. But it is the tension between the fun and the burden of his 
rearing and, especially, his relationship with his father, that gives 
the book its real power.<br>
<br>
Writing about his masterpiece, Darkness on the Edge of Town, he recalls a
 childhood moment: “The grinding, deafening sound of plastic being cut 
on an open factory floor. I am standing inches behind my dad, holding a 
brown paper bag containing his night-shift lunch, an egg salad sandwich.
 I call to him in the din, feel my mouth move, my vocal cords strain, 
but nothing . . . no sound. He eventually turns, sees me, mouths a few 
unheard words and takes the bag.”<br>
There’s so much in that memory – pride, fear, noise, food, love, 
silence, pain – and Springsteen manages to explain how this material, 
these lived moments, became the stuff of his best work: “Factory takes 
his hearing, factory gives him life, the working, the working, just the 
working life.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen never worked in a factory. But he watched – he witnessed; he
 lived. The first chapter, an evocation of his very early years growing 
up in Freehold, New Jersey, reminded me – in the little details, and the
 Catholicism – of Terence Davis’ film, The Long Day Closes: “I hear my 
grandmother calling me in, the last sound of the long day.”<br>
His grandmother was an overbearing presence. She’d lost a child, 
Springsteen’s father’s older sister, at five. Springsteen was the first 
baby born into the house since the death, so his grandmother “seized on 
me with a vengeance”. This would lead to “hard feelings with my father 
and enormous family confusion. It would drag us all down.”<br>
His father was an angry, silent, drinking, chain-smoking man at the 
kitchen table. That was the way men were, the boy thought – “distant, 
uncommunicative, busy within the currents of the grown-up world”. His 
father railed against the world and he took it out on his son. Here is 
the most impressive, and most difficult, sentence in the book: “He loved
 me but he couldn’t stand me.” It’s hard to read – it’s upsetting – but 
it goes a long way towards explaining the darkness – the wailing – that 
is in the best of Springsteen’s work.<br>
<br>
The chapter on Darkness on the Edge of Town should be the best thing in 
the book. But it isn’t, because it’s too short. There’s a film called 
The Promise, about the making of Darkness. It’s as brilliant and, in a 
sense, as excruciating a portrayal of artistic integrity as I’ve seen. 
Springsteen just wouldn’t give up or give in until the record was 
exactly what he wanted. The film, in this case, is much better than the 
book. What there is in the book is illuminating and very entertaining 
but there just isn’t enough of it. It’s the book’s one big flaw: it’s 
too short where it should be longer, too long where it should be much 
shorter.<br>
<br>
The second of the book’s three parts ends with Springsteen’s partner, 
Patti Scialfa, announcing that she’s pregnant. That’s great news for the
 Springsteens but bad news for those who agree with the man in the 
Donaghmede Inn: “Kids are like farts – you can just about tolerate your 
own.” His happiness was hard-won but one good paragraph would have done 
the work of many of Born to Run’s final chapters.<br>
<br>
Yet, in that last third Springsteen writes beautifully about his father 
and his father’s death, and the comfort he took from seeing his children
 cry because their beloved grandfather was gone. Another death, Clarence
 Clemons’, inspires this description of a life-long friendship: 
“Clarence’s hands were always like heavy stones but when he placed them 
upon your shoulders, the most comforting, secure feeling swept through 
your body and heart.”<br>
The book is over-written at times, word piled on word, image on top of 
image. There are too many exclamation marks and WHOLE SENTENCES WRITTEN 
IN CAPITALS. But, quite soon, it stops being important. In fact, it 
becomes quite like his onstage banter, his build-up to a song being 
unleashed, and you half-expect to find Clarence Clemons at your shoulder
 as you read. And in all the charging excitement, the simple brilliance 
shines. The child Springsteen enters a bar to get his father to come 
home, and meets “a barricade of broad, working class backs”.<br>
I missed my stop on the Luas because of Born to Run. I looked up from 
Springsteen’s description of driving across America in a blizzard and 
found myself at Citywest Campus station, five stops from where I needed 
to be. Tramps like us, baby, we were born to commute.</div>
