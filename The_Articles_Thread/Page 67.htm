<br>
A long view by a fellow New Jerseyian<br>
<br>
By Ralph Greco Jnr</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen and I lost our virginity together. Let me explain.<br>
<br>
The first time Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band played Madison 
Square Garden was in the summer of 1978, supporting the Darkness On The 
Edge Of Town album. This also happened to be was my first-ever Garden 
concert (though not my last by a long shot) and though I have seen 
plenty shows since at MSG and many other venues (even at Wembley in the 
UK…stadium name-dropper that I am), I can say with all sincerity, that 
not only was that 1978 MSG hymen-ripping Bruce show the best Springsteen
 show I have ever attended, but one of my top-five favorite concerts of 
all time.<br>
<br>
That night, in the waning summer days of the late 70s, Bruce opened with
 Elvis Presley’s “Good Rockin' Tonight,” cavorted with Clarence 
Clemmons, jumped into the audience with what had to be the world’s 
longest mike chord (this was well before the days of reliable wireless 
systems); took a freaking intermission, then wowed me with the show 
stopper “Rosalita,” most of Born To Run and Darkness, and broke the 
Garden curfew of 11 PM with a four-hour show.<br>
<br>
Yes, I have been born raised and bred in northern New Jersey. I’ve lived
 here all my life, and like all Garden State residents must pledge 
allegiance to Sinatra, Springsteen or Bon Jovi — or all three. But 
really, no matter where you’re from or what age you are, I can’t imagine
 anyone not loving a live Bruce Springsteen show. The guy then — and 
still pretty much still is — a transcendent performer. On that night in 
1978, Springsteen simply played the music he loved for a crowd who loved
 him back.<br>
<br>
No Nukes<br>
<br>
My next Bruce outing was at the infamous No Nukes concert, again at the 
Garden in 1979. The girl I went with was a huge Jackson Browne fan (I 
liked him too), but that night I was there for Springsteen. In fact, 
every performer that night was besieged by a very vocal NYC crowd 
“Bruuuucing” it up every second prior to the Boss taking the stage (I’ll
 refer you to the concert film form this night where ol’ Bonnie Raitt 
herself references this). It was during this two-night run that Bruce 
introduced a new song called “The River,” which would become the title 
track to his yet-to-be released double album of 1980. It was a 
considerably shorter set that Bruce and his crackerjack E Street Band 
performed that night. I recall aching for more then the allotted 90 
minutes, but when they opened up with “Thunder Road,” and the crowd 
started singing every word with him (again, watch the film), I felt that
 Bruce Springsteen magic again.<br>
<br>
At the time of this show, Bruce was still well off of MTV’s radar (as 
there wasn’t an MTV yet…oh, those were the days!). He hadn’t buffed up 
and he was still, in a strange way, still a cult figure and NJ’s 
favorite son. I knew people who saw him at the Stone Pony, that famous 
club in Asbury Park, NJ, where he had started out. There were stories of
 him jumping on stage with local bands and showing up at Southside 
Johnny’s annual New Year’s shows.<br>
<br>
Suffice it to say the girl I went with, the big Jackson Browne fan, was a Bruce convert after the Nukes show.<br>
<br>
The River<br>
<br>
The next time I saw Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, I was in 
college and The River had just come out. I wasn’t a big fan of this 
album, although I like the title track a lot. I felt that this double 
album had a bit too much 50s flavored filler. But this didn’t stop me 
from wanting to see the tour when it blew though town. Springsteen’s 
shows were going to open the just completed Brendan Byrne Arena in 
Jersey, and there was no way was I going to miss it — for myself and for
 my then Bruce-freak-of-a-girlfriend, L. (name withheld to protect the 
innocent).<br>
<br>
Back then there was a complicated lottery system in place to buy tickets
 (the demand was so high in Jersey) but I managed to score tickets, 
quite far up in the new arena. But it would prove to be another killer 
Bruce marathon performance, a near four-hour show, heavy on the new 
album. I seem to recall a very special reading of the song “Point Blank”
 and my fave from Darkness, “Racing In The Street.”<br>
<br>
Born In The U.S.A.<br>
<br>
<br>
The onslaught that was Born In The U.S.A. brought Bruce Springsteen to a
 whole new host of fans. Though deserving of the adulation with an album
 of commercial hits, his still-amazing live shows and the heavy MTV 
rotation of his videos, we New Jerseysians felt we were loosing the Boss
 to a wider bunch of fans. OK, we got over it…maybe (?), but you better 
believe when he came through town, I was there. With the ever-sparkling E
 Street Band: Roy Bittan on piano, Max Weinberg on drums, the dearly 
recently departed Danny Federici on organ and accordion, Nils Lofgren 
replacing Steven Van Zandt on guitar, Gary Tallent on bass, Bruce’s wife
 (who has, by the way, released some amazing solo albums) Patti Scialfa 
on vocals and guitar, and, of course, Springsteen’s friend and foil, the
 “big man” Clarence Clemons on sax — Bruce took the world by storm when 
he was out on the road supporting Born In the U.S.A.<br>
<br>
On this same tour, I once again saw Bruce at my local enormo-dome in 
north NJ. These shows were killer. Bruce and band were in top form, and 
while he wasn’t dipping back as much in obscure tunes (in previous 
years, you could always count on him to play a few unreleased tracks the
 audience had learned through years), it was a better show than the one I
 had seen behind The River.<br>
<br>
This was a lighter show in tone — or maybe I just like the songs on Born
 On The U.S.A. better then The River. I recall a hilarious skit Bruce 
performed with Clarence. It was about him and the big man walking 
through a notoriously scary NJ Pine Barrens. Other than my Bruce 
Springsteen freak-of-a-girlfriend (yes, the same girl) and us breaking 
up that night (okay, maybe not exactly that night), this was a show to 
rival any Springsteen show I had been witness to before.<br>
<br>
I skipped the stadium shows when Bruce came back that summer. I just 
couldn’t get my mind around a stadium Bruce show at the time, and by 
then, I was a little played-out on Born In The U.S.A. Still, the man was
 tops in my book.<br>
<br>
Bruce Goes It Alone<br>
<br>
Beyond what I saw of Bruce in videos, his much-publicized marriage to 
model/actress Julianne Phillips (and their subsequent split), his 
back-to-back Human Touch and Lucky Town albums, the tours without The E 
Street Band, his Oscar telecast performance of “Streets Of 
Philadelphia,” and even some concert footage on MTV — I only saw Bruce 
live once before his reunion with the E Street band.<br>
<br>
He was touring his second acoustic-flavored release — the first being  
Nebraska — The Ghost Of Tom Joad playing smaller venues. This was 
basically the Bruce show all his fans (or fans like me) had been aching 
to see: the man on stage, by himself and singing introspective tunes or 
reworked versions of his rock classics. I went to a great understated 
night at the Beacon Theater in NYC with two hours of Springsteen singing
 songs of life in America as he envisioned it now and in the past.<br>
<br>
The Return Of The E Street Band<br>
<br>
By the late 90s, Bruce returned in full force with the E Street Band. 
This time, the band consisted of both Nils Lofgren and Steven Van Zant 
on guitars. The tour was heralded as the second coming (especially in 
the Garden State!) and I can’t begin to describe what these shows meant 
to all us Bruce fans who feared we’d never see him reunite with his old 
band.<br>
<br>
They returned to my local concert venue, and I went with a host of 
friends and family to watch Bruce and the E Streeters destroy a hometown
 crowd. Opening with “Prove It All Night,” and running through nearly 
three hours of material pulled largely from Darkness, Born and U.S.A. 
This night saw killer versions of “Jungleland,” the obscure “Meeting 
Across the River,” and the tear-jerker, “If I Should Fall Behind.” The 
Boss was back!<br>
<br>
I remember thinking this concert felt more like a rock and roll revival 
meeting, a three-hour extravaganza with the band and Bruce back where 
they belonged. The rumor on this tour was that Bruce was mixing up shows
 nightly with A, B and C sets, respectively, so you really never knew 
what tunes you were going to hear. One of the best things about the 
multi-night stands is that you can see the man back-to-back, night after
 night (as a lot of his faithful do, especially in Jersey) and never see
 the same show twice.<br>
<br>
It was just like old times.<br>
<br>
The next year, Bruce breezed through the Garden, the first time he had 
in years actually, and the first time I had seen him there since the No 
Nukes concert. It was another three-hour barnburner marathon. I remember
 an especially rousing “Tenth Avenue Freeze Out” and the one tune that 
can cut my sister to the quick, “Candy’s Room.” It was a wholly 
different set from the year before and included the new, controversial 
“American Skin (41 Shots).” Since he wasn’t rally supporting a new 
album, Springsteen dipped into almost every album he’s ever recorded. To
 see Bruce and the E Street Band back at Madison Square Garden was 
magical. Interestingly enough, he did not play “Born In The U.S.A.” 
wasn’t in the set list. The last time I heard him play it with the band 
(he performed it at the solo Beacon show) was during the Born In The 
U.S.A. tour when it was slotted in a the opening number.<br>
<br>
The Rising<br>
<br>
Cut to 2003 and The Rising came out. This is not a release I am all that
 into, but I decided to take my buddy Mike, who has never seen the Boss,
 to one of the shows at my local stadium (first time for me since I had 
never as yet seen him in a stadium). As I would come to realize, Bruce 
Springsteen translates well in the big venues. He’s one of the few acts 
who do — along with U2, Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones — and the set 
list is n a good cross-section and heavy on the new album. Nevertheless,
 stellar moments abound. Keyboardist Roy Bittan especially takes a nice 
solo before the intermission and Bruce resurrects a bone-dry version of 
“Born in the U.S.A.”. He and the band play two hours, then return for an
 encore that lasts another hour, leaving Mike to ask, “Is this guy ever 
gonna stop?”<br>
<br>
“Rosalita,” as always, leaves the crowd breathless as Springsteen had 
omitted this show stopper from his set for the last three decades (it 
was a staple back in 1978). This was a solid show, maybe a bit darker 
given the 9/11 theme of The Rising, but it was still Bruce Springsteen 
and the E Street Band in a New Jersey stadium! What else do you want?<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, it was Bruce and me again as I went to see Bruce Springsteen and 
the E Street Band at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. My 
Bruce-freak of an ex-girlfriend-now-great-friend L was with me, my sis 
and her two friends (old Springsteen fans never truly move so far away 
that they can’t attend a show every now and then) — all packed into the 
soon-to-be-demolished home of the 2008 Super Bowl champs.<br>
<br>
Magic, the latest album from Springsteen and the E Streeters, was 
released on both vinyl and CD in 2007. Steven Van Zandt stated that his 
Boss didn’t ignore his commercial tendencies this time around, and I 
agree there are some great singable songs on Magic. But I also hear a 
lot of old Bruce on that album. On very few occasions have I had the 
pleasure of seeing an older act and looking forward to hearing their new
 stuff.<br>
<br>
Having missed the Magic tour when the band blew through town last year, I
 was really looking forward to this show. I had heard these stadium 
romps were not only the usual high energy assault, but also shows with a
 very loose set list. In fact, as I witnessed on this muggy July night, 
Bruce has taken to going out into the audience now and again, calling 
for his fans’ homemade signs displaying song titles and salutations.<br>
<br>
Now you can be an old cynic like me and consider Springsteen will only 
grab the signs of songs he knows or will play what he wants to on stage 
anyway, but tonight’s show was drastically different than the previous 
Monday I attended (I pulled up both set lists on line; Bruce fans are 
sticklers for these things) and the band admitted they are ready with 
over 100 songs to cater to Springsteen’s whims.<br>
<br>
Bruce and his E Streeters opened with “Out In the Street,” before 
falling into a blistering “Radio Nowhere” (one of the best songs of the 
night), followed by “No Surrender,” “Two Hearts Are Better Than One,” 
and “The Promised Land.” Have you caught your breath yet? Springsteen 
then sauntered down to the lower stage, close to the audience, spying a 
sign he liked, he turned back to the band to ask: “Is anybody hungry?” 
and then counted in “Hungry Heart.” “Summertime Blues” came next and 
then an unexpected, perfectly played (with Springsteen’s wife Patti 
Scialfa on those haunting backing vocals) “Tunnel of Love.”<br>
<br>
He returned to the faithful (that front area of the stadium being 
general admission) and began the ceremonial “passing up” of the homemade
 signs. He launched into a flurry of obscurities and requests: “Held Up 
Without A Gun,” the B-side of “Hungry Heart”; “It’s Hard to Be A Saint 
In The City,” the oldest tune of the night from 1973’s Greetings From 
Asbury Park, N.J., and “Sherry Darling” from The River; a blistering 
Lofgren-led “Because The Night”; my personal fave, “She’s The One,” and 
another one from The River called “Drive All Night.”<br>
<br>
<br>
After two straight hours, Springsteen and the E Street Band took a short
 break, only to return for an hour-long encore. It began with “Happy 
Birthday,” sang to Scialfa whose birthday was the next day. The encore 
included the infamous “Detroit Medley,” a tribute to Mitch Ryder &amp; 
the Detroit Wheels and concert staple from the late 70s, “Born To Run,” 
“Glory Days” and “American Land” from We Shall Overcome: The Seeger 
Sessions (utilizing both violinist/vocalist/acoustic guitarist Soozie 
Tyrell and Federici’s replacement Charles Giordano on accordion). The 
last song of the evening was the immortal “Twist and Shout.”<br>
<br>
Complaints? Hard to have them with a three-hour performance from a guy 
who looks like the sexiest mechanic alive, but just may be the hardest 
working man in rock and roll. I would have liked a little more of older 
stuff as the set focused primarily on material from The River and Magic.
 But when the Boss took requests and actually played nuggets like “It’s 
Hard To Be A Saint In The City” and “She’s The One,” how can I really 
complain? Plus, he sweats through three or more freakin’ hours of music 
each and every night! Guys half Springsteen’s age aren’t playing near as
 long and I challenge you to find me a band tighter than the E Street 
Band.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I could probably do without all that covers and more of his own 
stuff, but he really likes to play “Twist and Shout,” and dammit it if 
he doesn’t make it his own. Besides, the screen behind the band 
repeatedly cut away between Springsteen’s reaction and the crowd’s 
mania, making the massive Giants Stadium a bit cozier for those sitting a
 football field away.<br>
<br>
If for nothing else, it’s worth seeing this show to watch the guitar 
roadies come out at the end of a song ready to help the players switch 
axes while Bruce is already calling an audible, changing the set list 
mid-stride, and sending the roadie back to the arsenal for a different 
guitar!<br>
<br>
A long time ago, there was an infamous article written about 
Springsteen’s live performances. The writer stated, matter-of-factly 
that, “I have just seen the future of future of rock and roll and its 
name is Bruce Springsteen.” I have to say that Bruce Springsteen is very
 much the ‘now’ of rock and roll, or, at the very least, where the hell 
it should be in these times of high ticket prices and 360 deals. Three 
and half decades on, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band are still 
churning out perfect rock and roll marathon shows.<br>
<br>
Here in New Jersey, my home and Bruce Springsteen’s home, I saw what was
 probably the best concert of the summer. Bruce and I march forward 
together, as inexplicably linked (though he doesn’t know it) as we have 
been from the very first time I laid eyes on the Born To Run album at my
 friend Tom’s house and saw Bruce jump on Roy Bittan’s piano at Madison 
Square Garden in 1978.<br>
<br>
From one New Jersyian to another: I love Bruce Springsteen and I know he loves me back.</div>

<br>
<strong class="text-strong">BILLBOARD<br>
NEWS LEGAL AND MANAGEMENT<br>
By Jem Aswad | <br>
<br>
December 18, 2014 </strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"Couldn't get along without you, Barb," Bruce Springsteen said of 
Barbara Carr when inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 15 years 
ago.<br>
<br>
Any Springsteen fan worth their salt knows his longtime manager and 
former producer, Jon Landau. Less visible (by choice) is Carr, partner 
in Jon Landau Management, who's worked with the small but mighty company
 since 1980.<br>
<br>
Yet this veteran of Atlantic Records, Champion Entertainment and the 
London School of Economics is the unquestioned no. 2 in that four-person
 organization, overseeing many aspects of Springsteen's career, 
traveling with him on most dates of every tour, and leading his 
considerable charity efforts. In fact, she feels her own greatest 
achievement is the Kristen Ann Carr Fund for sarcoma research, named for
 her daughter who died from the disease in 1993 at the age of 21, which 
has raised more than $10 million.<br>
<br>
Carr very rarely speaks to the press, but Billboard caught up with her 
in November in association with our Women In Music feature and event, 
where she received a long-overdue place on the list -- an honor she 
certainly didn't ask for, but didn't mind getting, either.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
Billboard: What was your first job in the music business?</strong><br>
<br>
Barbara Carr: Working at Atlantic Records in publicity, part-time. I 
made five dollars an hour. My first husband, Patrick Carr, was a 
journalist, he mostly wrote about country music. One day somebody at 
Atlantic said to me, "You know every journalist" -- which I did, because
 back in those days there were so many parties -- "do you want to come 
in and work part time?" I had two little girls, so I said sure. I think 
it was the early '70s that I started there.  I didn't realize it at the 
time, but people tell me I sort of started tour publicity -- I mean, I 
didn't think of it like "Oh, I'm starting tour publicity!" But whatever 
bands we'd have on the road, I would see if maybe the Cleveland Plain 
Dealer or someone wanted to interview them ahead of time about their new
 record or their tour. We would have them do phoners, although that term
 wasn't invented yet. I was there for quite awhile and in many different
 capacities until eventually I became head of publicity. If there was 
ever a school for learning the music business, it was working at 
Atlantic Records at that time. The people there were unbelievable: I 
learned so much working with people like [corporate publicity chief] Bob
 Rolontz and [GM] Jerry Greenberg and [Atlantic affiliate Rolling Stones
 Records president] Earl McGrath and others. I just loved it. It was 
very exciting and I will always feel very privileged having had my start
 there.<br>
While I was at Atlantic, Dave [Marsh, journalist, Springsteen biographer
 and Carr’s husband] and Jon both lived in Boston, so I got to know both
 of them and we became very, very good friends. When Jon got an office 
he asked me if I wanted to use it its spare room, and then he asked me 
if I wanted to help him out. It was 1980 when I started working with Jon
 Landau Management.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Did you graduate from the London School of Economics?</strong><br>
<br>
No. I graduated from Marymount College, but I went for my junior year 
abroad to L.S.E. [in 1967, at the height of the student-demonstration 
era], which was a massive thing for me and a huge life-changer -- not so
 much the school or what I was learning as the whole experience. It was 
an incredible year -- it was very, very political and a very interesting
 time to be there. There was a huge sit-in at the L.S.E., I actually had
 my picture -- I think it was in Newsweek -- from it. It was a very 
formative thing to be very independent and become very political. I 
guess I'm still a little bit of a hippie from those days.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What was your big break?</strong><br>
<br>
Getting to work with Jon and so many of the people we manage. Obviously 
Bruce is the top, but we managed Shania Twain for quite a while through 
an incredible period of her career [during the 1990s and early 2000s]. 
She came to us and said "I'd like to go from being a country artist to 
being a pop artist," and that's what she got to become. [JLM’s] Jan 
Stabile and I must have gone to Australia with Shania four or five times
 in one year because that's where we first broke a pop single for her. 
Also Natalie Merchant when she first went solo [from 10,000 Maniacs in 
1990], Train, Alejandro Escovedo.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Did you have any female role models in the business?</strong><br>
<br>
Not really -- there just weren't that many [early in my career]. But 
women like [Shore Fire president and Springsteen’s longtime publicist] 
Marilyn Laverty or [longtime Sting manager] Kathy Schenker or Susan 
Duncan Smith at Sony in Rome or Tracy Nurse for Sony International, 
women that I’ve been friends with for a long, long time -- because we 
can always talk to each other so, so honestly, I think we mentor back 
and forth. I definitely will go out of my way to help somebody younger, 
because there's a lot of younger women that I work with in various 
capacities, at Sony or [Shore Fire].<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">How much time do you spend on the road when Bruce is on tour?</strong><br>
<br>
Pretty much the whole time. It's very long, but there are some people 
who take to it more easily than others. I've always taken to the 
traveling very easily.<br>
<br>
Part of it, I think, is that we moved around a lot when I was young. I 
was born in Trenton, New Jersey, and then my father, who was a 
geologist, started to work for the Magnolia Petroleum Company, which 
became Mobil Oil, and we moved to West Texas. Every 18 months, pretty 
much, my father would get a promotion and we would move again, so I 
lived in Wichita Falls, Abilene, Midland, [later] we moved back to New 
Jersey and then we moved to Canada. People would say to me, "How could 
you do that? How could you change schools all the time?" I think it made
 me very strong.<br>
<br>
At home I tend to go to bed very early and get up very early, but on the
 road, I guess maybe the adrenaline keeps me going. I went into [New 
York] last week, Bruce did The Daily Show, and I thought "As long as I'm
 in the city, I'm just gonna keep going to DC for the Concert for Valor"
 [where Springsteen, Eminem, Metallica and Rihanna performed]. So I took
 the train to DC, got there at midnight, next day went to the venue, 
didn't come back till like 11, had drinks with a couple people in the 
bar and then got up and took a 7:30 a.m. flight home. I was like, "Oh, 
I've hardly slept and I'm still alive!" (Laughter)<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What specifically does your role in the company entail?</strong><br>
<br>
Because there's so few of us, I'm involved in everything.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Are you the main point person involved in setting up the tours?</strong><br>
<br>
No, because there's George Travis, who has been around since before me 
and Jon [joined Bruce], he’s really the person that sets up all the 
tours, in conjunction of course with me and Jon. Even though he is not 
part of JLM, he is a very huge part of our team. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">There must be a lot of people like that for you to handle such a big artist with such a small staff?</strong><br>
<br>
It's big, but there's George and a couple of different road managers and
 then some of the band members have people that work for them. We've all
 known each other for so long that it's not hard to put the puzzle 
together. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">How about other aspects of the business?</strong><br>
<br>
We administrate Bruce's publishing. There's somebody at [attorney Allen 
Grubman’s] that we deal with every single day about publishing. But we 
work consistently, and after awhile you can read an email, have a 
conversation, listen to a request and you kinda know what the outcome is
 gonna be.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The sheer volume of requests must be overwhelming.</strong><br>
<br>
It is a lot! But one great thing about working with Bruce is that he is 
always so interested in everything and very hands-on. He personally 
approves almost all... except for things like when somebody in Japan 
wants to use four lines of one song in a novel in Japanese or something 
like that. But most uses of his songs, we run by him. He just likes to 
know, it's interesting to him.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Are there things you feel like you or Landau Management have innovated that other companies in the industry have picked up?</strong><br>
<br>
This all comes from Bruce, of course, but I think how we deal with 
charities when we’re on tour. You can do a lot and help charities raise 
money while asking very little of the artist. I think a lot of people 
have looked to us for that.<br>
But as an artist, and I hope other people understand this when they ask 
us, I think you have to concentrate on a couple of things: every artist 
can't be for the environment and global warming and hunger and fighting 
Ebola. If you try to do everything, you can't. So Bruce, having 
concentrated mostly on hunger, is why we have an incredible relationship
 with Bill Ayres at World Hunger and food banks all around the world. 
And we actually had one man in Australia who was a big Bruce fan, the 
promoter brought him to one show, I met him, and then the promoter said,
 "He is so shy, but he just donated $350,000 to two of the food banks." 
And I'm thinking to myself, "You're gonna get to say hello to Bruce," 
but he was so shy. When Bruce was walking to the stage I said "This guy 
just --" and Bruce goes, "Hey, how ya doin’?" We went back earlier this 
year, and he gave $500,000. But when I tried to give him a laminate to 
come backstage, he said, "Thanks, Barb, for the laminate, it really 
helped with the parking, but I'm here with some of my friends and I 
don't want to bother you."<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Your Kristen Ann Carr fund has raised more 
than $10 million for sarcoma research. That would seem like a full-time 
job in itself.</strong><br>
<br>
It's extremely hands-on -- it's still mostly run by people who were 
Kristen's friends and are very close to us: her sister Sasha, Michael 
Solomon, Ilyse Lesser and Alison Oscar. We never look at it like how 
much money we raise, we look at it more like, "What do we want to do 
next and how much money do we need for that?" We hold benefit events; we
 have very little overhead; we have a lot of volunteers. Once Kristen's 
group of friends got married and started having babies, a lot of them 
would have a little less time in a year so we hired an event planner but
 it's a small amount to pay her and it's invaluable.<br>
Dave of course is so involved on the medical side; it seems like he 
knows every sarcoma doctor in the world. And even if somebody has some 
other kind of cancer, there are Kristen Ann Carr Fund Fellows in 
hospitals all over the U.S. and Canada that we can just call and ask for
 a referral. We have a small research lab. We have chairs in the 
Department of Surgery and in the Department of Pediatric Oncology and we
 give out grants to people at other hospitals.<br>
We all miss Kristen every day, but she asked for this -- she said there 
needs to be more research and more help for people. And besides the 
[annual] event we have, which this year will be in May, we give a party 
for kids from the hospital at Sony Wonder [store in New York]. The kids 
bring all their family, their brothers and sisters. If Bruce is here he 
almost always comes, and he's like, "Maybe you should hang a 'Mr. Born 
In The USA' sign on me so people know who I am," because not only are 
the kids young but the parents are so young. It's a great evening.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">How come you never talk to the press?</strong><br>
<br>
I feel like I'm just more the silent partner. I kind of know what I do and who I am.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Is there an instance that you can mention where you had to talk an artist into something?</strong><br>
<br>
The first thing that comes to mind is Shania Twain used to get extremely
 nervous before going on stage sometimes or performing at an awards 
show. It was always so unbelievable to me because she was so 
accomplished and so strong that when it first happened, I was almost be 
like "I can't even believe this." I would see that something is making 
her feel insecure, so we would just talk to her like, "Are you kidding? 
You're great." We'd just have to really bolster her up. She was always 
great.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Encouragement was the tack that worked?</strong><br>
<br>
Encouragement, yes, and staying very calm. I think that's part of all of
 our [approaches] -- from Bruce, Jon, me, Jan, Ali [office 
manager/charity coordinator Alison Oscar], we stay very calm. Even when 
your heart is beating really hard and you want to go "Aaaaah!," I think 
staying calm really helps.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What is it about your relationship with Jon that's enabled you to work together for so long?</strong><br>
<br>
I think it's so important that we were friends first and got along so 
well. And yet, as close as we are, it's really important to know when 
each other needs space and quiet. We have a lot of respect for each 
other. And another reason why those of us in the office work together so
 well is because I'm one of four sisters, Jan is one of four sisters and
 Allie is one of four sisters. Isn't that unbelievable? We really 
understand each other's moods and just like sisters, you have to accept 
all the ups and downs.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">And what's enabled you to work with Bruce for so long?</strong><br>
<br>
I think the same thing, because I have so much respect for him and he is
 such an incredible person. One of the first things people ask when they
 realize I know him, "Is he really as nice as he seems like he is?" Yes,
 he is. He is very smart; he is a gentleman. Of course, he can get upset
 like everyone else -- when you have such close relationships over so 
many years, people have to be allowed to voice if they feel upset, or 
else it's just dysfunctional.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What’s the best advice you've ever gotten?</strong><br>
<br>
Here's a kind of funny one, because I can't think of the best career 
advice. Earl McGrath was a friend of [Atlantic cofounder] Ahmet 
Ertegun's, and he was a little bit of an art dealer. He would say things
 like, "Why are you buying a new couch when you could buy a painting? 
That couch is fine." His apartment was kinda like that -- it had these 
incredible contemporary paintings everywhere and hardly any furniture.<br>
So, not that I've bought extremely expensive art, but I have always 
bought art, and I'm sitting in my kitchen and there are four great 
paintings in here. So maybe the best advice I’ve gotten is, "Buy art."</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">REVIEW OF HIGH HOPES<br>
ALL MUSIC .COM<br>
<br>
Stephen Thomas Erlewine </strong> <br>
<br>
There isn't another Bruce Springsteen album like High Hopes. Cobbled 
together from covers -- of other songwriters along with the Boss himself
 ("American Skin [41 Shots]" and "The Ghost of Tom Joad" are both 
revived) -- and outtakes from the last decade, High Hopes doesn't have 
the cohesion or gilded surfaces of Wrecking Ball, but neither is it 
quite a clearinghouse of leftovers. Inspired in part by Rage Against the
 Machine guitarist Tom Morello, who has proven to be a brother in arms 
to Springsteen, as well as a substitute for Steven Van Zandt in the 
E-Street Band, High Hopes certainly bears the proud stamp of Morello, 
both in its workingman's politics and in its cinematic sound. Much of 
this record oscillates between the moody and militant, particularly in 
the politically charged numbers, which are often colored by percussive 
guitar squalls. Here, the RATM guitarist often resembles a Nils Lofgren 
stripped of blues or lyricism -- think of the gusts of noise on "Tunnel 
of Love" without any melodicism -- and that's a bracing change for 
Springsteen, who has shown interest in atmospherics but usually when 
they're coming from keyboards, not six strings. Such sociological talk 
suggests High Hopes is nothing but rallying cries and downhearted 
laments, but the fascinating thing about this unkempt collection is how 
these protest songs and workingman's anthems are surrounded by intimate 
tunes, ranging from a cover of the Saints' latter-day "Just Like Fire 
Would" to a strangely soothing interpretation of Suicide's "Dream Baby 
Dream." Morello reportedly had as much to do with the inclusion of these
 covers as he did with the record's set pieces -- a stirring "The Ghost 
of Tom Joad," "American Skin" (which can't help but seem like a 
reference to the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin in this context), and 
"High Hopes," a Tim Scott McConnell song first recorded in the '90s -- 
and there's a certain sober passion that ties all these songs together 
but, in turn, it makes the rest of the record all the more compelling 
because the pieces simply don't fit. There's the rousing Gaelic rock of 
"This Is Your Sword," sounding a bit like a rejected closing credit 
theme for The Wire; "Down in the Hole," which rides the same train-track
 rhythm as "I'm on Fire;" the complicated waltz of "Hunter of Invisible 
Game," softer and stranger than much of the rest here; "Harry's Place," a
 bit of synthesized Sopranos noir that sounds much older than its ten 
years; and the absolutely glorious "Frankie Fell in Love," as 
open-hearted and romantic a song as Springsteen has ever written. 
Strictly speaking, these 12 songs don't cohere into a mood or narrative 
but after two decades of deliberate, purposeful albums, it's rather 
thrilling to hear Springsteen revel in a mess of contradictions.</div>

<br>
By David Hinckley, <br>
New York Daily News<br>
 March 25, 1989</strong><br>
<br>
Two former roadies who are suing Bruce Springsteen had their day in court yesterday.<br>
Mike Batlan and Doug Sutphin have contended that their old employer 
illegally refused to pay overtime, arbitrarily docked paychecks and 
reneged on a promise to Batlan about salary.<br>
Springsteen's attorney, Peter Parcher, noted that roadies, who handle 
moving duties and odd jobs with rock bands, traditionally never get 
overtime and that thus there was no reason for Springsteen to pay it. 
Later, the pair's attorney, Stephen Scheuler, said: "He gets up on stage
 as the champion of the working man and then he says he's never heard of
 overtime?"<br>
Lawyers on both sides are filing motions in this 18-month-old case. The case presents two opposite pictures.<br>
The Batlan/Sutphin view begins in 1973, when, they say, Springsteen 
promised Batlan he would always be paid just slightly less than the 
band. Batlan wasn't.<br>
After they filed suit, Batlan and Sutphin believe that Springsteen's 
attorneys dragged their feet long enough to let Springsteen do the 
"Tunnel of Love" tour without having to pay overtime. Now the lawyers 
acknowledge that Springsteen is covered by federal wage-and-hour laws, 
but say that the statute of limitations has expired, meaning Batlan and 
Sutphin are owed almost nothing.<br>
The Springsteen view: This is basically a nuisance suit. The alleged 
promise to Batlan was never made. Futhermore, say Springsteen's people, 
Batlan and Sutphin were very well-paid (in the $50,000 range) for 
not-very-difficult jobs (equipment maintenance), and their performance 
was slipping. Still, they say, Springsteen resisted pressure to fire 
them and tried to shape them up with warnings - and by docking their 
paychecks. In late 1985, Batlan quit and Sutphin was fired. Springsteen 
gave Batlan $125,000 and Sutphin $100,000, Parcher says.<br>
Roadies are hired to do a job, not to work specific hours, say 
Springsteen's lawyers; they know this before they sign on. Furthermore, 
the lawyers say, many of Springsteen's roadies are paid even when there 
is no tour, and most stay with him for years, which suggests they feel 
well-treated.<br>
Scheuler's associate, Larry Jones, says the case will go to trial, 
possibly as early as July or August. If that's true, Springsteen may do a
 date on a witness stand.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Assault On Springsteen: What A Boss<br>
August 02, 1987|<br>
PATRICK GOLDSTEIN</strong><br>
<br>
The cover of the latest issue of England's widely read New Music Express
 is provocative enough: a Bruce Springsteen look-alike in the "Born in 
the U.S.A." album pose, a wad of bills sticking out of his jeans.<br>
But the story by veteran rock journalist David McGee is sheer fireworks,
 perhaps the first major debunking of rock's favorite son. Titled 
"Blinded by the Hype," the l-ooo-n-g story is unlike any piece you've 
ever read about the much-praised rock hero.<br>
It's virtually a mirror-image of Dave Marsh's worshipful "Glory Days" 
biography. McGee assaults Springsteen with brass-knuckled fury, 
describing him as a master manipulator, control freak and mean-spirited 
employer (fining tour staff for minor transgressions) who, as McGee 
bluntly puts it, "is in it for the money, whatever else he may pretend."<br>
<br>
McGee's account is largely based on stories by such former long-time 
employees as lighting engineer Marc Brickman, guitar valet Mike Batlan 
and cook/seamstress/superfan Obie Dziedzic.<br>
<br>
Among other items:<br>
<br>
It claims that Springsteen and manager Jon Landau, known as loyal 
supporters of union causes, threatened key employees with dismissal if 
they joined unions.<br>
It accuses Springsteen's organization of staging a "surprise" benefit 
appearance at Asbury Park's Stone Pony club (a charge subsequently 
denied by an ABC News producer involved in covering the event).<br>
It claims that several roadies were docked $311 in back pay after losing
 Springsteen's prized canoe when the star was moving to his new New 
Jersey home.<br>
It reports that Dziedzic was fined $100 for being late serving Bruce his pre-concert soup and sandwich.<br>
McGee, who served as an editor at Rolling Stone (and its late offshoot, 
the Record), saves many of his best licks for Marsh, Springsteen's 
confidante and biographer, whose much-maligned "Glory Days" is maligned 
further as "possibly the most thorough whitewash of a major artist's 
life and career yet published."<br>
The piece has such a jagged-edged, often petty tone that you immediately
 wonder if there's more here than meets the eye. For instance:<br>
What soured McGee, a longtime Springsteen fan and--during the '70s--a sometime pal, on his former idol?<br>
Why wouldn't any U.S. publication print the story?<br>
Is much of the story colored by McGee's rivalry with Marsh, an ex-friend
 whom he fired from the Record (at publisher Jann Wenner's behest) and 
who has since enjoyed far more career highs than McGee?<br>
We only ask so many questions because its been so hard to get an answer.
 McGee didn't return several phone calls. Barbara Carr, an exec at 
Springsteen's press-shy management office (and Mrs. Dave Marsh), refused
 to discuss the story's specifics, saying only: "I didn't know anything 
about this piece before it came out, and I haven't heard from Dave McGee
 in years."<br>
Marsh bluntly dismissed the piece as "all junk," terming it "the ravings
 of a group of lunatics in a miscreant Carnaby Street rag." (His book, 
incidentally, is being excerpted in Sounds, a New Music Express rival.)<br>
Marsh acknowledged that "my reporting in the book was remiss if you 
wanted an exhaustive account of everyone involved in Bruce's career. But
 as for the stuff in his piece that McGee alleges I said--it's just not 
true. It's bad reporting based on false premises. I mean, his charges 
are insane. Bruce--not a friend of the working man? Come on!<br>
<br>
"It's very simple. Either everything you know about Bruce's life and 
career is a fake, or this article is not true. Those are your options."<br>
It's a sign of Springsteen's enormous influence in the rock community 
that key sources--several closely associated with the Boss's camp--were 
only willing to talk on a not-for-attribution basis. Even Springsteen 
associates acknowledged that many of the piece's details--that crew 
members were on occasion fined for various minor offenses--were 
accurate.<br>
"Sure, a lot of its true," said one source close to the star's camp. 
"It's the way McGee wrote it that's so weird. He's taken a lot of petty 
gripes and blown them way out of proportion. No one ever mentions that 
when these (former employees quoted in McGee's story) were very well 
taken care of when they left the organization. Bruce gave them very 
lavish presents when they left.<br>
"You have to understand that these guys were around Bruce for a long 
time, but they didn't write the songs or perform them. And this gap does
 occur," the same source said. "I bet a lot of famous people have this 
problem--that the people who've been there from the start begin to live 
through someone like Bruce and overestimate their importance in 
everything. Anyway, these guys got so wound up about it that they became
 embittered and wound up out of a job."<br>
Oddly enough, another source insisted that Marsh's recent squeaky-clean 
biography may have opened the floodgates for even more backlash. "If 
Bruce hadn't been put on such a pedestal, no one would even blink at 
this kind of silly stuff. I mean, can you imagine anyone caring if 
someone found out that Mick Jagger was crabby or cheap? Big deal! 
Marsh's book was so dewy-eyed that you can almost imagine dozens of 
writers out there, saying, 'Hey, I'm gonna get the real story.' Bruce is
 just the latest victim of the '80s media overload--they love to build 
you up and they really love to knock you down."</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Federici's, WindMill hold special spots on Bruce's plate<br>
Asbury Park Press<br>
 Chris Jordan,<br>
December 17, 2014<br>
</strong><br>
New Jersey singers like to eat.<br>
<br>
Frank Sinatra had Patsy's Restaurant in New York City, Whitney Houston 
had a table at the Black Horse Tavern in Mendham and Jon Bon Jovi has 
the Soul Kitchen in Red Bank.<br>
<br>
But Bruce Springsteen, well, he's not really known for a single place. 
If he did, we wouldn't report it as to protect his privacy. But there 
are several spots at the Jersey Shore where he's a known regular —- even
 if that's once or twice a year — so if you want to eat like a Boss, you
 can.<br>
<br>
Take the original WindMill restaurant, famous for its hot dogs, in the 
West End section of Long Branch. It's about a block down the road from 
the bungalow where Springsteen wrote much of "Born to Run," and he's 
been hitting the spot for the last 40 years or so.<br>
<br>
"One of the first stops when they used to go out on tour was a stop at 
the WindMill," said WindMill co-owner Rena Levine-Levy. "They'd take the
 food out on the road with them."<br>
<br>
The Boss has been coming back ever since, usually for a late-night snack
 after a performance in Asbury Park. The WindMill folks have previously 
catered Springsteen holiday shows at Convention Hall in Asbury Park.<br>
<br>
One night, the crew kept the place open for Springsteen, who enjoys both
 the WindMill hot dogs and hamburgers, Levine-Levy said. He was sitting 
at the counter when there was a banging on the window.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and the guys turned around to see a woman flash the Boss.<br>
<br>
"It's 3:30 a.m. in Long Branch," Springsteen said. "I'm going home."<br>
<br>
Another time the Boss' wife, Patti Scialfa, went behind the counter and flipped the hot dogs herself, Levine-Levy said.<br>
<br>
"Nobody bothers Bruce when he comes to the WindMill," Levine-Levy said. 
"We have an unspoken law, nobody bothers him and nobody gawks at him. He
 just wants to be another WindMill customer, and we're very protective 
of him.<br>
<br>
Burgers or hot dogs?<br>
<br>
Which leads us to another question — does Bruce Springsteen prefer hot 
dogs or hamburgers? Hannah Summers, the author of the London-based 
Burgers and Bruce blog at <a href="http://www.burgersandbruce.com/" class="postlink">www.burgersandbruce.com</a>, has some insight into the matter.<br>
<br>
"He said he likes hamburgers, and he likes them simple with ketchup," 
Summers said. "He said he likes them simple, '50s and '60s diner style. 
Nothing too fancy or too glamorous."<br>
<br>
Springsteen is partial to the Johnny Rockets chain, Summers said.<br>
<br>
Summers did not ask the Boss about hot dogs when she met him in Belfast. It is a Bruce and burgers blog, after all.<br>
<br>
Health food?<br>
<br>
Which brings us the question: how healthy does Springsteen eat? This 
topic was explored in the 2012 biography, "Bruce," by Peter Ames Carlin.<br>
<br>
An interview with ex-girlfriend Diane Lozito is telling.<br>
<br>
"(Springsteen) had a hard time sleeping at night, so I'd sit up watching
 TV with him while he wolfed down all this junk food: sodas, cakes, all 
this horrible stuff," Lozito said.<br>
<br>
<br>
His eating habits changed in the late '70s, according to Carlin, when 
Springsteen hired fan Obie Dziedzic to be his Gal Friday. She 
straightened things out by adding vegetables, salads and more to his 
diet. In the '80s, the Boss buffed himself up with a weightlifting 
regimen, which wouldn't have been successful without a solid dietary 
foundation. These days, he appears to be the healthiest 65-year old 
around who doesn't blink after three hours into a high-energy concert.<br>
<br>
A leaked copy of his rider from the 2002 Rising tour shows Springsteen 
eating whey powder, soy milk, protein shakes and bananas, strawberries 
and blueberries backstage at his shows.<br>
<br>
"He's in better shape than the majority of 65-year olds — although he's 
also in better shape than me and I'm 27," Summers said. "General fitness
 is obviously important or you wouldn't have the stamina for concerts 
like that!"<br>
<br>
Down the Shore<br>
<br>
He's been on the road for the better part of the last 10 years. When 
he's home at the Shore, he visits Federici's Restaurant on East Main 
Street in Freehold about once a year. It's a Springsteen family 
tradition as Springsteen's dad, Douglas Springsteen, was an acquaintance
 of Frank "Spat" Federici, said son Michael Federici.<br>
<br>
By the way, the Freehold Federici's are not related to the late E Street Band member Danny Federici, who was from Flemington.<br>
<br>
"My dad always remembered (Springsteen) carrying his guitar through town," Federici said.<br>
<br>
The Boss cashed his first check at Federici's, Federici said.<br>
<br>
"My dad dispensed the money, and he got a pizza," he said.<br>
<br>
These days, Springsteen gets a plain pie and maybe a beer or a shot of 
tequila when he goes to Federici's. When he played a benefit concert at 
the borough's Saint Rose of Lima School in 1996, he brought more than 30
 people to the restaurant.<br>
<br>
"That was a nice honor for us," Federici said.<br>
<br>
Dessert is often at Jersey Freeze on Manalapan Avenue and Route 9 in Freehold.<br>
<br>
"I liked the cones," said Springsteen from the stage at MetLife Stadium in 2012. "They'd save the broken cones for me."<br>

Bruce Springsteen <br>
<br>
ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE<br>
BY ROB SHEFFIELD |<br>
 January 13, 2015</strong>	<br>
				<br>
Bruce’s greatest official bootleg ever is full of fire and verve<br>
<br>
Imagine hearing Springsteen go from "Racing in the Street" into "Thunder
 Road" into "Jungleland" – and then he comes back out for the second 
half of the show. This epic Cleveland set is from August 9th, 1978, a 
highlight of the fabled Darkness tour, simulcast on local station WMMS. 
Springsteen burns through classics like "Rosalita" (with a snippet of 
the Village People's "Macho Man"), castoff gems like "Fire" and covers 
from "Summertime Blues" to "Twist and Shout." The peak is the 10-minute 
"Prove It All Night," with the long, moody guitar-piano intro. This is 
simply the greatest live LP this greatest of live rockers has ever 
officially released.</div>
