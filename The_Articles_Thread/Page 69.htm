<br>
Michael Goldberg, Neumu, August 2002</strong><br>
<br>
He may be on the cover of Time again, but The Rising sure ain't Born to Run<br>
<br>
THE BEST SONG on Bruce Springsteen's long-awaited studio album, The 
Rising, is almost a throwaway. It's called 'Let's Be Friends (Skin to 
Skin)', and if it were missing from the album, you probably wouldn't 
miss it. It has nothing to do with the heavy, dark and serious statement
 about a post-9/11 America that Springsteen makes through most of the 14
 other songs that appear on the album. Conceptually, the album would 
hold together just fine without it.<br>
<br>
No, 'Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin)' is a fun song. It reminds me of 
'Hungry Heart', a song that didn't seem to fit the album it was on — The
 River — either. It's slightly racy — you can see Springsteen smile as 
the character in the song makes his move, singing, "The time is now, 
maybe we could get skin to skin."<br>
<br>
If only the rest of The Rising were as good as 'Let's Be Friends (Skin 
to Skin)'. There's so much weight on this album. And it's been turned 
into such an event. Weeks before its release a New York Times profile 
let the world know that 9/11 had brought Bruce out of a writer's block 
and allowed him to find his "rock voice" again. His new album, we 
learned, was about the impact of 9/11 on Americans. Not only that, but 
we read that the fans needed him. In that article Springsteen said that a
 few days after Sept. 11, as he was leaving a parking lot in the Jersey 
Shore town of Sea Bright, a fan rolled down the car window and shouted, 
"We need you!"<br>
<br>
Last week he was on the cover of Time magazine again — 27 years after 
the news weekly called him "Rock's New Sensation" — this time with the 
headline "Reborn in the U.S.A.: How Bruce Springsteen reached out to 
9/11 survivors and turned America's anguish into art."<br>
<br>
All of this hoopla is, frankly, annoying. From a business standpoint, it
 probably makes good sense. But it makes Springsteen look like an 
opportunist. And it also sets him up for accusations of "much ado about 
nothing."<br>
<br>
If you haven't been paying attention, well, it's been a long time since 
Springsteen made a really good album of new material. You have to reach 
back to 1987 and Tunnel of Love. Since then there were those two studio 
albums he did without the E Street Band (Human Touch and Lucky Town), a 
greatest-hits album, the so-so folky Ghost of Tom Joad, a collection of 
old stuff (stuff that didn't make the cut for various albums Bruce was 
working on back when he was firing on all six cylinders) titled Tracks, 
and a truly pointless live album from his 2000 oldies-but-goodies tour, 
Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band/ Live in New York City.<br>
<br>
As a longtime Springsteen fan and media junkie, I, of course, bought 
into the hype; on the morning The Rising was released I plunked down my 
$20 to buy the special book-like version of the album with the extra 
photos and handwritten notes. I'd already read a pan in Newsweek and 
raves in the Wall Street Journal and the San Francisco Chronicle, and 
had heard good things from a friend who'd already spent a few days with 
it.<br>
<br>
I would like to say that none of that had any impact on me. And that I 
was able to just let the album live or die based solely on the music. 
But I'd lying if I said that. I brought all kinds of expectations and 
preconceptions to The Rising. And I found, even during my first listen, 
even as I kept telling myself "Withhold judgement, just listen, no need 
to put on that 'critic's hat' yet," that my emotions were all over the 
place, I was reacting, and not just to the music. But then, later, I 
thought, "No, you're reacting to all that other stuff because something 
is missing in the music.<br>
<br>
I have listened to the album more than a dozen times during the past 
three days. On first listen, I thought it sucked. Now, many listens 
later, I like some of it, but I find problems with much of the 
songwriting, production and arrangements. Many of the arrangements sound
 heavy-handed and some of the lyrics seem shallow and clichéd ("I'm 
waitin', waitin' on a sunny day/ Gonna chase the clouds away/ Waitin' on
 a sunny day," goes one less-than-inspired chorus).<br>
<br>
'Further On [Up the Road]' is a perfect example of a song that never 
should have been recorded. The melody is hackneyed and tired — we've 
heard these hard rock changes before, and they weren't that good in the 
first place. The beat is plodding, the music — a murky mass of guitars —
 is indistinct, uninteresting. It's really hard to imagine the man who 
once wrote 'Thunder Road' and 'Adam Raised a Cain' singing these words: 
"Further on up the road/ Further on up the road/ Where the way is dark 
and the night is cold/ One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know/ And I'll 
meet you further on up the road."<br>
<br>
Then there's the problem of the sound of the E Street Band. On such 
classic albums as Born to Run and Darkness on the Edge of Town, 
Springsteen and the band together created an unmistakable sound. It 
utilized classic rock 'n' roll elements and instruments including 
acoustic piano, Hammond organ and saxophone, along with bass, drums and 
electric guitars. Yet on The Rising, many of the tracks incorporate that
 truly irritating synth sound that I believe first reared its ugly head 
on 'Dancing in the Dark'. With a drummer as talented as Max Weinberg, 
why make use of a drum machine? Often producer Brendan O'Brien turns the
 E Street Band into an anonymous rock band, neutering them of the 
idiosyncratic stylistic elements that for so many years made Bruce 
Springsteen and the E Street Band sound like themselves.<br>
<br>
If I'm making The Rising sound like a disaster, well, it's not that 
extreme. Springsteen has made a mediocre album. Not a bad album. Just 
not an album that I'll go back to in years to come, the way I 
periodically go back to the albums he recorded in the '70s and first 
half of the '80s. Still, there are some powerful songs here. 'Empty 
Sky', in particular, is a standout. It has a strong melody, a simple, 
moving arrangement and powerful lyrics. The chorus is a disappointment 
("Empty sky/ Empty sky/ I woke up this morning to an empty sky" repeated
 twice), but the way Springsteen sings it, with moving background vocals
 from his wife Patti Scialfa, makes it work. 'Into the Fire', 'You're 
Missing' and 'Paradise' are also pretty good. And Springsteen's voice, 
throughout, sounds terrific.<br>
<br>
And then there's 'Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin)'. If it wasn't buried 
in the middle of all these "heavy" songs that we know were inspired by 
9/11, you'd just think it was a great, slightly retro soul number. You'd
 start bouncing around the room or rockin' in your car when it came on. 
You'd smile, give your boyfriend or girlfriend, wife or husband a kiss. 
And your day would be just a little bit better.<br>
<br>
I expect a lot from Bruce Springsteen. His recordings have earned him a 
place among rock's greats. I understand that producing great work on 
demand isn't easy — and perhaps is impossible. I feel for him. Listening
 to The Rising is a little like running into an old friend who's been 
through some hard times and hasn't quite recovered. You know it's the 
same guy, but that spark is missing. You want it to be there so bad, but
 it isn't.<br>
<br>
All I want from Bruce Springsteen is an album that gives me goosebumps, 
the kind I still get when I listen to Darkness on the Edge of Town, or 
Highway 61 Revisited or Call the Doctor. That's probably too much to 
ask.<br>

"..As time went on, president carter wasn't the only celebrity dying to 
meet me. The biggest rock-and-roll star since Elvis had busted out, and 
my son, Larry, was dying to see him. I pulled some strings and we were 
off to see Bruce Springsteen.<br>
Since I'm a Vegas kind of guy, I didn't have any background in big-time 
rock shows. I didn't know what to expect. I didn't know we needed 14 
badges and 18 wristbands to get past the 32 security guards to get to 
our seats in the VIP area. I didn't know that the 20 loudspeakers 
onstage would be blasting out more noise than atomic bombs. I didn't 
know that the show would go on for 3 hours, getting louder by the 
minute.<br>
Didn't know that his fans sitting around us would be screaming even before the show started.<br>
Didn't know that to meet Bruce we'd have to wait outside his dressing room for 2 hours without food or water.<br>
When we were finally escorted in, I saw this extremely kind and sweet 
man wearing a bandana around his forehead. He looked like a pirate.<br>
"Great show, Bruce," I said.<br>
"Hope you'll come to another one" he said.<br>
"What?" I said. "I can't hear you."<br>
I'd gone deaf.........<br>
In spite of the volume, I really liked the Springsteen show. I could see
 why his fans were so loyal. But of course loyalty for me always back to
 Sinatra."</div>

Is Rihanna Secretly in Love With the Boss?<br>
Posted: 03/09/2015 <br>
</strong><br>
<br>
With sultry singer Rihanna's new video tease out for her latest single, 
"American Oxygen" looking a lot like a not so subtle tribute to Bruce 
Springsteen's iconic "Born in the USA" album pose, could the Barbados 
born beauty secretly be a big Bruce Springsteen fan?<br>
<br>
If you're still not convinced, one of the tracks on her forthcoming 
album is entitled "Dancing in the Dark." And while it's not a cover, nor
 does it share any similarity to Springsteen's 1984 release, have you 
ever heard of another "Dancing in the Dark" song?<br>
<br>
Speaking of the much covered single, if you haven't seen the enchanting 
Morgan James and her soulful version, please allow yourself five minutes
 to indulge.<br>
<br>
Reigning teen queen Taylor Swift occasionally covers "Dancing" in 
concert, and once, temporarily inked her arm with lyrics from another 
one of Springsteen's '84 rockers, "No Surrender."<br>
<br>
Another spirited female musician with more than a passing fancy for The 
Boss is 2015 Grammy nominated saxist, Mindi Abair. The Florida native 
told Jazz Times "If given the chance to bring Charlie Parker back from 
the dead and play with him or to play with Bruce Springsteen, I'm 
probably the 1 percent of sax players who would say Bruce. But that's 
what makes the world go 'round."<br>
<br>
Actress and star of Syfy's Continuum, Rachel Nichols, has been seen, on 
more than one occasion, by this writer, swooning to Bruce in concert. 
She's also tweeted out photos of herself donning Springsteen gear.<br>
<br>
Count legendary singer Ronnie Spector as another one who looks fondly at
 Springsteen, telling MOJO magazine earlier this year that Bruce (along 
with Steven Van Zandt and Southside Johnny) "saved me." Struggling to 
put her life back together after her bitter divorce to Phil Spector in 
the 70's, Bruce (and the guys) gave her an opportunity to perform and 
record together. Bruce introduced Ronnie on stage as the girl he always 
wanted to marry. In 1976 Ronnie sang her signature song, "Be My Baby," 
live in concert, alongside Bruce and the E Street Band.<br>
<br>
Jennifer Lopez appeared quite happy to be Jenny by the Boss in a recent photo.<br>
<br>
Rocker Melissa Etheridge, who's admitted Bruce taught her "how to 
dream," paid tribute by intentionally writing a Bruce inspired song for 
her latest album, "M.E." Springsteen's influence is felt immediately on 
"I Won't Be Alone Tonight."<br>
<br>
Australian's award-winning singer/songwriter Kasey Chambers says her 
2015 APRA nominated song of the year, "Bittersweet" came about because 
she had a dream one night where Bruce was her boyfriend. Keep dreaming 
Kasey, The Boss is still happily married to American songstress, Patti 
Scialfa.<br>
<br>
Many people unfairly associate Springsteen only with the working man or a
 man's only musician -- that couldn't be further from the truth. Sure we
 know all too much about The Boss bromances of Jimmy Fallon, Brian 
Williams, Matt Lauer, Eddie Veder, Bono, Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks;
 but clearly, women admire The Boss too -- and it's not just because he 
looks great in a pair of blue jeans.<br>
<br>
Bruce came out with "Crush on You" in 1980 on his double album, "The 
River"...seems as if some famous ladies of today are the ones with the 
crush on him</div>

<br>
 BOSS: The Biannual Online-Journal of Springsteen Studies 1.1 (2014) <br>
<br>
 Jason Schneider <br>
DePaul University </strong><br>
<br>
 <br>
“Born in the U.S.A.” is in some ways the most important song of Bruce 
Springsteen’s career. It dominated the airwaves throughout the 
mid-1980s; it was the driving force behind the Born in the U.S.A. album,
 which vaulted Springsteen into mega-stardom; and it is the song that 
most listeners in the United States and around the world associate with 
the artist. Additionally, even though “Born in the U.S.A.” is probably 
not the favorite song of many Springsteen fans, it is the song that has 
aroused the most controversy and discord among devoted fans, casual 
listeners, music writers, and even politicians. Because of these debates
 and the strong feelings attached to them, “Born in the U.S.A.” has 
become a touchstone that fans use to define themselves and other 
listeners in relation to Springsteen and his music: Do you know what the
 song is really about? Do you know about the various misinterpretations 
and misuses? How do you assess the Born in the U.S.A. period in the 
context of Springsteen’s career? <br>
<br>
To borrow a bit of Bourdieuian social theory, answers to these questions
 serve as a kind of cultural capital that places listeners in 
Springsteenian social space; the right answers earn cultural capital, 
while the wrong ones diminish worth. Examining some of the competing 
discourses around “Born in the U.S.A.,” including varying 
interpretations of the song, is one of the goals of this paper. By 
analyzing these arguments, I aim to identify and problematize 
assumptions behind some of the key positions. Beyond this meta-analysis,
 though, I want to propose a way of thinking about “Born in the U.S.A.” 
that draws on assumptions from my own academic field, rhetorical 
studies, but which has broader reach. Rather than another interpretation
 of the song’s specific meaning, my perspective focuses on how the song 
means whatever it means—or in more rhetorical terms, how the song argues
 whatever it argues. To this extent, I am most interested in 
illuminating some of the mechanisms through which the song creates a 
rhetorical effect for listeners. The argument I will develop is that 
“Born in the U.S.A.” functions according to a paradoxical juxtaposition 
of form (musical delivery) and content (lyrics) to create “rhetorical 
indirection,” and  structure and the accompanying rhetorical paradox it 
produces are precisely what make the song one of the most enigmatic 
recordings from Springsteen’s catalog. Beyond this, I propose that the 
paradoxical structure of “Born in the U.S.A.” offers a generative 
heuristic for thinking about Springsteen’s larger artistic output and 
public persona, both of which have been marked by paradoxes since at 
least the mid-1980s, when Born in the U.S.A. was released, and perhaps 
even since the mid-1970s, when he first began developing some of the key
 themes that continue to define his work. <br>
<br>
Arguments around “Born in the U.S.A.” and Born in the U.S.A. began in 
the summer of 1984, shortly after the album’s release. Historical 
narratives of the song and album typically focus on a September 1984 
newspaper piece by conservative columnist George Will, who wrote about 
attending a Springsteen concert at the invitation of members of 
Springsteen’s entourage. In the piece, Will made the following claims: 
“I have not got a clue about Springsteen's politics, if any, but flags 
get waved at his concerts when he sings songs about hard times. …"<br>
<br>
 Will’s piece constituted what Jefferson Cowie and Lauren Boehm describe
 as the “first shot in the Springsteen wars.”4 Will’s ignorance of 
Springsteen’s politics was, in itself, enough to incense fans, many of 
whom identified strongly with the songwriter’s increasingly pointed 
critiques of American social structure, particularly through his 
depictions of working-class characters who could not find a place for 
themselves in post-industrial America. The end result of Will’s positive
 assessment of Springsteen, however, was much greater. He encouraged 
Ronald Reagan’s reelection team to refer to Springsteen on the campaign 
trail, so on September 19, 1984, Reagan made the following comments 
during a stump speech in Hammonton, New Jersey: “America’s future rests 
in a thousand dreams inside your hearts. It rests in the message of hope
 in songs of a man so many young Americans admire—New Jersey’s own Bruce
 Springsteen. And helping you make those dreams come true is what this 
job of mine is all about.”5 Reagan’s use of Springsteen’s name was by no
 means sanctioned, as Springsteen was anything but a Reagan supporter; 
indeed, in 1980, the day after Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter, Springsteen
 had gone on stage and called the results of the election “pretty 
frightening.” However, Springsteen did not react publicly for a few days
 to Reagan’s use of his name in 1984. Then, during a concert on 
September 22, after finishing a performance of “Atlantic City,” he said 
this: “The President was mentioning my name the other day, and I kinda 
got to wondering what his favorite album musta been. I don’t think it 
was the Nebraska album. I don’t think he’s been listening to this one,” 
and then he launched into “Johnny 99,” a folk tale about a laid-off 
auto-plant worker whose frustration leads to a drunken robbery, during 
which he murders a store clerk.7 <br>
<br>
. <br>
If Will’s comments were indeed “the first shot in the Springsteen wars” 
that resulted in Reagan’s New Jersey speech, then Springsteen’s 
observation that the president had not “been listening to this one” can 
be understood as his own direct contribution to the conversation. 
Clearly, the assumption behind his claim was that Reagan did not 
appreciate the extent to which he, through his lyrics, had been 
critiquing the American socioeconomic situation—one which presumably had
 resulted, at least to some degree or another, from Reagan’s own 
policies. To this extent, the debate at that moment was about the 
profound socioeconomic changes that were taking place in America and 
Reagan’s and Springsteen’s competing assessments of those changes. Was 
the new America—Reagan’s America—a place where individuals’ dreams could
 flourish, or was it a place of profound desperation, as experienced by 
alienated workers, such as the protagonist of “Johnny 99”? <br>
<br>
This ideological question about the state of America, however, did not 
remain central to the debates around “Born in the U.S.A.”; rather, 
Springsteen’s initial public response served as an unambiguous gesture 
to Reagan and his people, and to any confused listeners, that they 
should not presume an association between him and the president’s 
politics, regardless of how many American flags were being waved at his 
concerts. What developed in the months and years following was an effort
 by Springsteen fans and some music critics to emphasize what they heard
 as the true meaning of the song and album in response to the apparent 
misunderstandings. To this extent, the story about Reagan became a 
moralizing-aggrandizing tale for Springsteen fans in 1984-85, years of 
true Springsteen-mania, because it highlighted the extent to which 
listeners, including presumably many of the 13 million who bought Born 
in the U.S.A., did not understand the album or the song, which Dave 
Marsh describes variously as “misinterpreted,” “misconstrued,” and 
“misappropriated.”<br>
<br>
 Some years later, Eric Alterman offered a similar view on widespread 
perceptions of “Born in the U.S.A.,” claiming that the song offered a 
prime example of the whole album’s “lyric-melodic confusion” and that 
“millions of people heard exactly the opposite message of what 
Springsteen intended.” The general position that both Marsh and Alterman
 take here, that many listeners did not understand “Born in the U.S.A.” 
or Born in the U.S.A., is echoed in the commentaries of myriad writers. A
 few examples from the academic literature are illustrative: Bryan 
Garman argues that the “political intentions” of Born in the U.S.A. were
 “largely misunderstood,” and claims that the musical form of “Born in 
the U.S.A.” in its full rock version “removed some of the sting from the
 lyrics and opened the door for manipulation”; Alan Rauch observes that 
“Born in the U.S.A.” was not “the patriotic anthem that many in 
Springsteen's audience conceived it to be” and, similarly, that “[w]hile
 there is no question that the song was written to represent the voice 
of Vietnam veterans who are unemployed or who have been alienated, it is
 by no means an anthem”; Jason Stonerook calls the song “[h]orrendously 
misinterpreted by the masses as a patriotic anthem,” arguing instead 
that the song constitutes “a scathing condemnation of an America that 
has left some citizens behind and alone.”<br>
 <br>
<br>
The shared, underlying thesis of these and other commentators has become
 doxa among Springsteen fans and writers, and, as noted earlier, it 
partly serves the function of determining whether or not one truly 
understands the artist.  However, the argument that “Born in the U.S.A.”
 has been largely misunderstood or misinterpreted operates according to 
at least two problematic assumptions that I want to highlight here, even
 if I admit to being sympathetic to the argument as a response to a <br>
certain rhetorical situation—namely, Will’s and Reagan’s uses of 
Springsteen’s name and the explosion of Springsteen-mania in the 
mid-1980s. First, to call any piece of art misinterpreted is to assume 
that there might be right or wrong understandings of artworks; or, more 
pointedly, it is to assume that artworks hold specific meanings and that
 the role of an audience is to decipher or find those meanings. This is a
 popular and widespread belief about art, and lyric art in particular, 
but it is a position that has become theoretically tenuous in the wake 
of more than four decades of postmodern thought. Similarly, the notion 
that the meanings of artworks are somehow reflective of their creators’ 
intentions is specious if we accept the basic tenet that the 
ideological, discursive, and aesthetic expectations of audiences affect 
their interpretations of texts. Second, and more important for the 
argument I want to develop later in this paper, the ways of thinking 
about “Born in the U.S.A.” favored by many fans and writers clearly 
privilege the song’s lyrics over its music. In fact, in most versions of
 the argument, the music itself is never addressed, or, in the case of 
Alterman’s and Garman’s arguments, the music is described as a feature 
that distracts from the true meaning of the song. In this view, the 
earlier acoustic version of the song, which was recorded during the 
Nebraska sessions and appears on the 1998 Tracks collection, offers a 
truer, or perhaps purer, rendering of the song’s meaning, since there is
 no distraction of a rock band or the nearly screamed refrain of “Born 
in the U.S.A.” that might be misinterpreted as anthemic or as a “grand, 
cheerful affirmation” of America, as Will put it. Rather, on the 
acoustic version, Springsteen’s vocal delivery seems rough and muted, 
suggesting anger, frustration, and desolation—all of which dovetail with
 the  favored interpretation of the song’s lyrics as a scathing critique
 of American state policies and socioeconomic structure. <br>
<br>
In the second half of this paper, I will offer a more detailed response 
to the assumption that we might be able to divide a song’s lyrics, or 
what I will call its content, from its musical delivery, or its form, 
grounding my position in assumptions from both rhetorical theory and 
discourses on popular music. For now, though, I only want to emphasize 
that the idea that “Born in the U.S.A.” has been misunderstood is a 
commonplace among Springsteen fans and many commentators. Furthermore, I
 want to propose that this argument has primarily served the rhetorical 
purpose of claiming, or perhaps re-claiming, Springsteen for those who 
have listened to him the most or the longest; or perhaps even more, for 
those who share his specific political convictions. As Steve Johnston 
puts it in a similar critique of Marsh’s and Alterman’s writing about 
Born in the U.S.A.: “[They] excoriate Will, of course, to exonerate 
Springsteen.” As Johnston suggests, though, and as I will argue later, 
the song opens itself to a range of more or less persuasive 
interpretations, including the one proposed by Will. To be clear, I am 
not claiming that Will’s interpretation is fully convincing, but I do 
believe it accurately recognizes a particular rhetorical dimension of 
“Born in the U.S.A.,” even if it strategically overlooks other 
dimensions. <br>
<br>
 A couple of clarifications are in order here. First, to be fair to 
George Will, his interpretation of “Born in the U.S.A.” emerged from 
what apparently was a single listening at a concert, during which he 
claims to have had cotton stuffed in his ears. Presumably, if he had 
delved deeper into the lyrics, he would have qualified some of the 
observations he made in his newspaper piece. Nonetheless, I do not know 
of a robust presentation of his argument—that the song is a powerful 
celebration of “the U.S.A.”—even though this conviction surely 
circulates in mainstream perception. Second, within the interpretation 
of “Born in the U.S.A.” as a uniformly critical song, there is often an 
effort to explain away the thundering refrain of the rock version as 
angry or ironic. For example, Carlin describes this version as 
displaying “shades of fury” (Carlin, Bruce, 294), while Eric Branscomb 
highlights the “irony” of the song, which he sees as “the mistreated 
veterans’ lament”.<br>
 <br>
While the positions described above are the most prominent in the 
controversy over “Born in the U.S.A.” and Born in the U.S.A., a handful 
of writers have offered more nuanced and theoretically complex 
positions, all of which treat the song and album as multi-dimensional. 
In Jim Cullen’s analysis, for example, “Born in the U.S.A.” can indeed 
be considered a patriotic song, even a “conservative” song, but its 
patriotism and conservatism are not those of Will and Reagan; rather, 
they harken back to earlier American ideals, and most pointedly to those
 of the 1930s, a period which Cullen calls Springsteen’s “spiritual 
home,” not least of all because of that era’s celebration of “the common
 man.”<br>
<br>
 In Elizabeth Bird’s analysis of “Born in the U.S.A.” and the period of 
Springsteen’s career surrounding it, she notes that in the 1980s 
“Springsteen was becoming all things to everyone. Politically, his image
 was increasingly unclear.” She does not see this as a misunderstanding 
of some true message in his work; rather, she argues that the “potent, 
swirling brew of images and emotions” that were connected to Born in the
 U.S.A., and not just the lyrics of the songs, meant that “people could 
inscribe any meaning they liked, or no meaning at all,” which is exactly
 what they did. In her final analysis, the apparently divergent messages
 that Springsteen presented to the public, including Springsteen’s 
extensive use of the American flag and other iconography, allowed the 
artist to become a kind of postmodern floating signifier that circulated
 in the public sphere to be appropriated for a range of ideologies. 
Cowie and Boehm also offer a theoretically sophisticated reading of 
“Born in the U.S.A.,” as they graft its competing “anthemic” and 
“desperate” qualities, or its “series of dualities,” onto the developing
 story of working-class alienation in 1970s and 1980s America. In short,
 they analyze the song as addressing both foreign and domestic 
“wars”—one in Vietnam, the other on the socioeconomic landscape in the 
United States, and perhaps most emblematically in the Rust Belt. For 
them, the song offers insight into “[t]he withering of the economic 
dimensions of class, the destruction and demoralization of the politics 
of place, the betrayal of institutions designed to protect workers, and 
the amplification and mobilization of cultural nationalism…” Also, 
importantly, they see the full rock version of the song as the one that 
“manages to transcend simple partisanship in its use of art and 
history.”In all, they claim that “[t]he artistic decision to juxtapose 
the song’s two contrasting dimensions ought to be central to any 
approach to understanding the essence of ‘Born in the U.S.A.’ The heart 
of the song rests at the intersection, not the selection, of its 
internal oppositions.”<br>
<br>
I concur with this claim, and following Cowie and Boehm—as well as, to 
some extent, Cullen, Bird, and Johnston—I see the song’s “two 
contrasting dimensions” as inherent to its structure and its effect as a
 rhetorical performance. Thus, rather than treating the rock version’s 
musical form as a distraction from the true meaning, I will use it, in 
conjunction with the lyrical content, as a way into understanding how 
“Born in the U.S.A.” employs an apparently paradoxical structure to 
create a particular rhetorical effect, one that I will describe as 
rhetorical indirection. To clarify, rhetorical indirection does not mean
 rhetorical confusion, because I do not see “Born in the U.S.A.” as a 
confused song; rather, the term describes a textual pedagogy through 
which a rhetor—that is, an orator or speaker, or even a writer—presents 
audiences with a range of possibilities “with no fixed answer nor a 
clear set of propositions to be applied dogmatically.” This is not 
exactly a postmodern position, as the one proposed by Bird, according to
 which Springsteen and his work can take on nearly any meaning for 
anyone; rather, it is a position that highlights the way in which texts 
can strategically propose apparently divergent meanings in order to 
produce a particular kind of rhetorical effect. <br>
<br>
 It is important to keep in mind that all works of art can be polysemous
 and, to this extent “Born in the U.S.A.” is not unique. However, 
through its apparent mismatch of form and content, the song seems to 
invite starkly divergent interpretations, which is evidenced by the wide
 range of discourses around the song. Furthermore, many of these 
interpretations seem convincing, in that they do rely on textual/musical
 evidence. <br>
<br>
To treat popular music as rhetoric is not unique. Since at least the 
middle of the twentieth century, it has become commonplace to treat all 
kinds of texts as inherently rhetorical. One assumption of this approach
 is that all texts necessarily imply viewpoints on issues in the world; 
or, as rhetorical and literary theorist Kenneth Burke put it, all uses 
of language and symbols entail a “striking of attitudes.” This 
orientation also requires accepting the premise that texts function as 
arguments, whether or not their creators imagine them as such. This last
 point is crucial for rhetorical analyses of popular culture, because to
 claim that a song by Bruce Springsteen, for instance, is an example of 
argument is not to suggest that Springsteen conceptualized it as such; 
rather, it is to say that when his creations enter the realm of public 
discourse, they necessarily function as arguments in relation to other 
public arguments and ideologies. For this reason, Springsteen’s supposed
 intentions for his art, which are key to many analyses of his work, are
 not relevant to my method here; instead, the question of how “Born in 
the U.S.A.” functions as a public text is what matters most. In the case
 of Springsteen, in particular, there are already examples of explicitly
 rhetorical treatments of his work, including a chapter by Michael 
Hemphill and Larry David Smith, who describe how the narratives in 
Springsteen’s story-telling songs provide listeners with what Burke 
calls “equipment for living,” as well as an article by Lisa Foster, who 
has explored the populist argumentation style in songs from The Rising. 
 Moreover, commentaries on Springsteen by other critics—including 
Johnston and Bird, as well as Simon Frith, Lawrence Grossberg, and 
Stuart Hall—have implicitly rhetorical dimensions to them.<br>
 <br>
The same would be true of a rhetorical analysis of a politician’s 
speech, for example. What the politician intends is largely irrelevant 
to understanding how the speech functions when it enters the realm of 
public discourse and ideology. <br>
Thinking about art, and verbal art in particular, as rhetorical is a 
practice that reaches back much further than the twentieth century. In 
his book on rhetoric and poetics in ancient Greece and  Rome, Jeffrey 
Walker describes how lyric poetry was a form of public discourse in the 
ancient world, much like legal and political oratory, and, to this 
extent, it also functioned as a medium for public argumentation. As he 
explains, treating poetry as rhetoric entails some of the following 
assumptions: poetry is persuasive; the audience is expected to exercise 
judgment in response; this kind of response implies ethical 
positionings; and, not least, “poetry may have direct and indirect 
effects on social and civic life through the shaping of communally 
shared judgments and ethical commitments with regard to both particular 
and general kinds of questions.” Although the contexts of contemporary 
popular music and ancient lyric poetry are different in important ways, 
Walker’s observations provide a basis for treating rock music as 
rhetoric. Even more to the point, in the case of Springsteen, there is 
no question that his art has “direct and indirect effects on social and 
civic life” and interacts with a range of “ethical commitments.” To this
 extent, Springsteen is clearly a rock and roll rhetoric.<br>
 <br>
Analyzing Springsteen as a rhetor could entail a range of specific 
orientations, but one unifying feature would be an interest in how his 
songs produce public arguments, rather than just individual experiences 
of entertainment or pleasure. To this extent, any features of his songs 
that contribute to those arguments merit attention, including both the 
lyrics, or content, and the musical delivery, or form. As Kenneth Burke 
and others have theorized, textual analysis demands attention to both 
form and content because both contribute to what Burke calls “function,”
 according  to which texts “do something” for a rhetor and the audience.
  Writing about popular music, Frith echoes this view, emphasizing that 
“the issue in lyrical analysis is not words, but words in performance,” 
and that “a song doesn’t exist to convey the meaning of the words; 
rather, the words exist to convey the meaning of the song.” Bird assumes
 the same perspective on Springsteen’s art in particular when she 
critiques many interpreters of his work for their assumption that “we 
can understand Springsteen's mass appeal by understanding and 
interpreting his lyrical message—his ‘meaning’ can, in effect, be read 
off his narrative texts.” An effort to account for the overall effect 
(or “function”) of a song’s form and content would be, thus, one key 
aspect of a rhetorical orientation to popular music. Additionally, and 
relatedly, an appreciation for how musical arguments interact with 
audience expectations constitutes a necessary consideration. To borrow 
some of Burke’s language again, textual forms have rhetorical effects by
 enacting “an arousing and fulfillment of desires” for the audience, as 
they create “an appetite in the mind of the auditor, and the adequate 
satisfying of that appetite.” Applied to popular song, this perspective 
highlights the extent to which meanings are not located strictly within 
musical artifacts themselves but emerge through interaction between 
musical form and listeners’ own aesthetic, rhetorical, and ideological 
frameworks—or what Burke calls “the psychology of the audience.”33 Frith
 makes a similar observation when he describes how each music listener 
operates according to a “scheme of interpretation,” which is based 
partially on one’s previous experience of a specific “musical culture,” 
such as the genre of rock music. As he explains, “[f]or sounds to be 
music, we need to know how to hear them…” In the case of “Born in the 
U.S.A.,” the wide range of audience assumptions and expectations seems 
to be a driving force behind the divergent interpretations of the song’s
 supposed meanings. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The Order of “Confusion”: Paradox and Rhetorical Indirection </strong><br>
<br>
As described, the claim that there is an apparent mismatch, or what 
Alterman calls “confusion,” between the lyrics of “Born in the U.S.A.” 
and their delivery in the full rock version is accepted as a truism by 
many of Springsteen’s fans and critics. Drawing on the ideas of Burke 
and Frith, we might also say that there seems to be a mismatch between 
some listeners’ genre-based desires and appetites and the degree to 
which they do or do not get fulfilled by the song. Generally, this 
should not be surprising, since interpretations of artworks often vary, 
at least partly, due to differing audience expectations or “scheme[s] of
 interpretation.” If we accept, though, that both form and content are 
constitutive rhetorical elements of “Born in the U.S.A.,” then some of 
the dominant perspectives on the song’s supposed meaning are not 
grounded in comprehensive analysis. That is, they have not addressed the
 question of how both the lyrics and the music contribute to a 
collective rhetorical effect for listeners. As noted, Cowie and Boehm 
offer one answer to this question that resonates with the story of 
American labor. For them, the apparent form-content “dualities” of the 
song encapsulate the increasing struggle of American workers in the 
1970s and 1980s to situate themselves amidst the wars they were fighting
 abroad and at home. My own analysis is less focused on the unique 
historical realities of the early 1980s—even though that period did 
provide the specific rhetorical exigency for the song—and more on the 
abstract question that the song seems to address, which is the struggle 
of an individual to negotiate a relationship among him- or herself, the 
state, and a national community.<br>
<br>
 In making this move, I do not mean to devalue the importance of the 
unique history and socioeconomic situation that surrounded the invention
 of this particular rhetorical artifact, or of context more generally, 
which has always been key to rhetorical analysis. Rather, in my view 
there has already been a great deal of astute interpretation of 
Springsteen’s music in relation to the specific reality of the 
1980s—from Cullen, Alterman, Johnston, and Cowie and Boehm, to name a 
few—and thus, I am consciously working to offer a different view on 
Springsteen’s work. My perspective, coming 30 years after the release of
 Born in the U.S.A., allows a chance to consider not just what the song 
seemed to mean in its immediate discursive context, but rather what it 
might be coming to mean in an increasingly distant aesthetic and 
sociopolitical reality. <br>
On the one hand, the song’s content seems to argue for a critical 
analysis of both American government and society, specifically in 
response to the way that Vietnam veterans were treated upon their return
 home, and perhaps more generally in reaction to growing class inequity 
(which helps explain why the song’s protagonist was in Vietnam in the 
first place); that is, it seems to articulate one individual’s feelings 
of complete alienation from the political and social communities into 
which he was born. On the other hand, the form of the song, with its 
positive musical timbre—the major key, the simple two-chord structure, 
the bright synthesizer, the steady drum beat, the anthemic refrain—seems
 to argue for an impassioned celebration of “the U.S.A.,” whatever that 
might mean to the protagonist. Or, as Frith puts it in his description 
of the song, the chorus, through “its texture, its rhythmic 
relentlessness, its lift” comes off as “triumphant.” These are only 
interpretations of the recording’s musical form, of course, but the 
claim that the song offers something like a triumphant celebration of 
“the U.S.A.” is grounded in the conventions of musical grammar (that is,
 listeners’ shared “schemes of interpretation”), according to which 
major keys and bright sounds are happy, and perhaps even more 
specifically in the rock music grammar that Springsteen has employed 
throughout his career. This was clearly the argument that George Will 
heard, and this was surely the argument that millions of listeners heard
 in the 1980s. Undoubtedly, Springsteen-mania had a great deal to do 
with this understanding of “Born in the U.S.A.” and the American 
iconography that adorned the album, the concerts, and several of the 
music videos.37 Nonetheless, the response of many to these 
interpretations has been to describe the thundering proclamation of “I 
was born in the U.S.A.!” as angry or ironic. In my view, however, there 
is no solid basis for this analysis, except through an interpretation of
 the lyrical content of “Born in the U.S.A.,” which is not actually an 
interpretation of the musical form itself; rather, calling the form 
ironic merely extends an interpretation of the content to the form, 
without engaging with the context of rhetorical delivery. Furthermore, 
like Johnston, I believe that the interpretation of the song proposed by
 Will and millions of others actually has firm grounding in the musical 
form and confirms the breadth of what Johnston calls “Springsteen’s 
impact,” especially if we accept that musical meanings operate according
 to generic conventions (for example, the major key), and, more 
specifically, that Springsteen has typically been conservative in his 
employment of the grammar of rock music.Nonetheless, I see the 
interpretation of Will and others as one-dimensional, since it does not 
respond to the full rhetorical force of “Born in the U.S.A.” and Born in
 the U.S.A. <br>
<br>
If we treat both the song’s form and content as constitutive elements of
 a larger argument, then at least one way of understanding the overall 
effect may be to posit that what the song offers is essentially a 
rhetorical paradox, specifically in relation to one protagonist’s 
efforts to find a place for himself within the complex interplay of 
political, socioeconomic, and ideological forces that constitute his 
surroundings. That is, by juxtaposing the song’s apparently critical 
content with its conventionally understood celebratory music, 
Springsteen forces listeners to engage with seemingly divergent 
perspectives on questions of patriotism, identity, and national 
belonging; in short, the narrator seems simultaneously to love and to 
hate the polity into which he was born. To this extent, “Born in the 
U.S.A.” completely eludes efforts to align it with conventionally 
understood American left-right political ideologies; instead, it 
intermingles and embraces conflicting perspectives in unexpected and 
beguiling ways. This effect can be understood as an example of what 
Jason Ingram calls “rhetorical indirection.” In an analysis of Plato’s 
writing about rhetoric, Ingram argues that Plato’s manner of situating 
Socrates, the “foil,” in complex dialogues is used “to provoke readers” 
into considering multiple points of view. In short, rhetorical 
indirection is a method by which a rhetor presents the audience with a 
range of possible answers or outcomes without explicitly endorsing any 
one as correct. Ingram further explains Plato’s use of rhetorical 
indirection this way: “Challenging texts to determine whether or not we 
agree with them is an integral part of conventional interpretation. 
Plato provides a somewhat unconventional supplement, a rhetorical form 
purposively designed to bring readers to a particular experience, one of
 extreme doubt or aporia…”<br>
<br>
While there are clear formal and contextual differences between Platonic
 dialogues and rock songs, the notion of rhetorical indirection seems 
applicable to “Born in the U.S.A.,” not least of all because the song 
has a deeply dialogic structure. Essentially, by juxtaposing paradoxical
 arguments about being “born in the U.S.A.,” and one particular 
narrator’s feelings of belonging (or not) to “the U.S.A.,” Springsteen’s
 song “provokes” listeners to consider multiple ideological stances and 
“forces reflection about heuristics and fundamental assumptions…” 
Moreover, like Ingram’s Plato, Springsteen “uses indirection to create 
another level of meaning, one whose value lies more in performance or 
process than in memorizing discrete concepts or propositions.”42 In this
 way, it is the entire rhetorical structure, or performance/process, of 
“Born in the U.S.A.”—not simply the lyrics or the music—that produces an
 overall effect. Certainly, this is true of many popular songs and 
rhetorical artifacts. However, “Born in the U.S.A.” seems unique in the 
starkness of its indirections, as well as in its thematic depth. Thus, 
if there is a unified argument in the song, it may be that the 
narrator’s feelings of connection to his own political state and 
national community are, above all, profoundly paradoxical. <br>
<br>
One assumption behind this understanding of “Born in the U.S.A.” is that
 a paradoxical argument on questions of patriotism and national 
belonging might serve as a satisfying rhetorical outcome for a rock 
song, or as an acceptable fulfillment of rock listeners’ desires and 
appetites. Indeed, in my view, it is precisely this aspect of “Born in 
the U.S.A.” that makes it one of Springsteen’s most intriguing and 
captivating songs. However, if the most pervasive interpretations of the
 song are indicative, this is a very different assumption than the one 
that drives most listeners’ expectations, which are based on the premise
 that “Born in the U.S.A.” should be a logically coherent political 
statement; that it must be either for or against certain politics. This 
is precisely why listeners from various ideological vantage points have 
subsumed the form into the content or the content into the form, or 
simply ignored uncooperative dimensions of the song altogether. However,
 while an assumption of logical coherence may be useful for analyzing 
certain genres of rhetorical performance—such as political speeches, 
academic articles, and probably many works of art, including some of 
Springsteen’s songs—it is not well-suited to the rock version of “Born 
in the U.S.A.”43 The song is an exercise in paradox and incoherence—and 
perhaps this should not be surprising, given the song’s themes. To 
imagine that the relationship between an individual and his or her 
nation-state might be logical or coherent does not seem very convincing,
 and, likewise, any song that makes this argument may not be very 
intellectually persuasive. More to the point, in the case of a Vietnam 
veteran in 1970s-1980s America, the observation seems particularly 
acute: Why should the audience expect this narrator’s feelings about his
 government and national community to be anything but conflicted and 
multidimensional? <br>
<br>
 The original acoustic version, however, seems to be a much more 
coherent work of art—in terms of its use of standard form-content 
conventions—which may be why it is the favored version of many fans and 
writers. For me, however, while the acoustic version has an engaging 
dark mood about it, as do many of the songs recorded during the Nebraska
 sessions, it does not achieve the kind of rhetorical and ideological 
complexity found in the rock version. In writing about Springsteen’s art
 in relation to the idea of patriotism, Johnston offers a series of 
questions with which he believes Springsteen’s songs engage: <br>
What do you do when you realize that love is misplaced when it comes to 
country or homeland? What do you do when you realize that America, the 
object of your love, does not and could not deserve it? That patriotism 
cannot justify itself? That patriotism is dangerous and potentially 
deadly to what it claims to serve in light of its love affairs with 
enmity and death?44 <br>
Through its rhetorical indirection, “Born in the U.S.A.” forces 
listeners to engage with precisely these kinds of questions, and even to
 immerse themselves in the complexity of the issues. In this  way, the 
effect of “Born in the U.S.A.” is very much in line with Burke’s notion 
of rhetorical “order.” According to Burke, one of rhetoric’s many 
functions is offering interpretations of situations, or giving “order to
 an otherwise unclarified complexity.” Moreover, he describes how 
artistic texts can provide “a terminology of thoughts, actions, 
emotions, attitudes, for codifying a pattern of experience. The artist, 
through experiencing intensively or extensively a certain pattern, 
becomes as it were an expert, a specialist, in this pattern. And his 
skill in articulation is extended upon the schematizing of his subject.”
 This, in the end, seems an apt description of “Born in the U.S.A.” as 
rhetorical artifact: It offers a potential order, via the structure of 
paradox, to an “unclarified complexity” and a certain “pattern of 
experience,” which is the relationship that all national subjects must 
negotiate with their governments and communities. Thus, the argument of 
the song is not an articulation of a singular version of this 
relationship; rather, it is an artistic ordering of the multiple 
anxieties, pains, joys, and perhaps even impossibilities that define the
 relationship itself. In this way, “Born in the U.S.A.” suggests that 
there can be no easy answers to questions of patriotism and national 
belonging, that these are paradoxical human experiences. <br>
<br>
 Indeed, a larger analysis of the myriad symbolic aspects of 
Springsteen’s performances in the mid-1980s would be fruitful. 
Additionally, the idea of the paradox, in particular, provides a 
heuristic for gaining broader insights into Springsteen’s entire career.
 Although it is certainly easy to pinpoint cohesive themes, trends, 
interests, and beliefs across the span of Springsteen’s work—this is a 
familiar type of cultural analysis—there are also ways in which his 
artistic output is defined by paradoxes. For example, since at least the
 mid- to late-1970s, there has been a central tension in Springsteen’s 
work around the notions of the individual and society. As John Sheinbaum
 observes, Springsteen’s work seems to embody, on the one hand, a deep 
engagement with the theme of isolation, particularly through its 
exploration of “the plight of the individual”; however, at the same 
time, there is a way in which this very exploration “results instead in 
the formation of a community.” Sheinbaum quotes Parke Puterbaugh’s 
comments on this topic in relation to the Darkness on the Edge of Town 
tour: “<em class="text-italics">t was a strange phenomenon. The more 
Springsteen sang about alienation, the more people turned out to 
listen.” This paradox also plays out in “Born in the U.S.A.” and other 
songs in an interesting way, as noted by Stonerook: The “big, sing-along
 choruses on buoyant songs”—including “Born in the U.S.A.,” “Hungry 
Heart,” and “Glory Days”—all help to create a sense of community. At the
 same time, however, the lyrics of all of these songs seem to explore 
particular dimensions of isolation. <br>
. <br>
Another example of a paradox in Springsteen’s work is the tension 
between the local and the national—or perhaps even the global—especially
 in relation to political subjectivity. Lawrence Grossberg made the 
following observations about Springsteen during the Born in the U.S.A. 
period: <br>
Springsteen empowers his fans, energizes them, within their affective 
commonality by invoking personal and local images . . . But even as he 
recognizes that one must do more (recreated in his political raps during
 the concert and in his support for local groups and struggles), even as
 he appeals to national imagery, his commitment to the local and the 
image prevents him from engaging in larger issues. America, such a 
powerful image in his current success, is always invoked as one's 
“hometown,” and Springsteen deals with national history by reducing it 
to the level of individual lives.<br>
<br>
In a sense, Grossberg’s observation highlights a feature of all art that
 attempts to engage with national or even global sociopolitical themes 
through storytelling: The individual plight serves as a synecdoche for 
commonly shared experiences. However, as Grossberg notes, it is at the 
level of engagement that the paradox comes into stark relief: Do songs 
about individuals’ hometown experiences provide a rhetorical foundation 
for “engaging in larger issues” or do they, instead, reify a pervasive 
American ideology of the individual, which is, arguably, antithetical to
 progressive community processes? Both of these paradoxes merit more 
careful exposition, and certainly additional paradoxes could emerge from
 more extensive reflection on Springsteen’s music. I hope that others 
will take up this work. In my view, pursuing these types of critical 
questions offers the best chance for generating new and interesting 
insights from Springsteen’s rich oeuvre. It may be that the passage of 
years makes inquiries like mine easier, to the extent that time allows 
critics to distance themselves from the immediate sociopolitical and 
rhetorical pressures that surround the creation of particular artworks. 
Certainly, we must always attend to those specific exigencies. But, at 
the same time, it is worth considering how new meanings and implications
 can emerge over time. Indeed, if Springsteen’s music has any chance of 
remaining relevant in the decades ahead—and I think it does—it will 
depend on the willingness of listeners and critics to reimagine his art 
in new contexts.</em></div>

BOSS: The Biannual Online-Journal of Springsteen Studies 1.1 (2014)<br>
<br>
William I. Wolff<br>
Rowan University</strong><br>
<br>
In his SXSW keynote, Springsteen uses his podium to argue in defense of a process of creating meaningful work:<br>
I’d like to talk about the one thing that’s been consistent over the 
years: the genesis and power of creativity, the power of the songwriter,
 or let’s say composer, or just creator. So whether you’re making dance 
music, Americana, rap music, electronica; it’s all about how you are 
putting what you do together. The elements you’re using don’t matter. 
Purity of human expression and experience is not confined to guitars, to
 tubes, to turntables, to microchips. …<br>
We live in a post-authentic world. And today authenticity is a house of 
mirrors. It’s all just what you’re bringing when the lights go down. 
It’s your teachers, your influences, your personal history. And at the 
end of the day, it’s the power and purpose of your music that still 
matters.<br>
<br>
Springsteen chooses a daunting task for any orator: to reconnect 
authenticity to a traditional approach to creating art. His concerns are
 similar to those of Philip Sidney in 1595: to defend his art to a 
society that openly questioned the authenticity of poetry. In “The 
Defense of Poesy,” Sidney advocates for poetry and poets against charges
 that writing poetry is a waste of time, that poems are full of lies and
 “infect us with pestilent desires.”15 In response, Sidney argues for 
the importance of poetry in terms of how poets interpret and represent 
the worlds around them: “Only the poet, disdaining to be tied to any 
such subjection, lifted up with the vigor of his own invention, doth 
grow, in effect, into another nature, in making things . . . better than
 nature bringeth forth…”16 For Sidney, “Poesy is of all human learnings 
the most ancient and of most fatherly antiquity, as from whence other 
learnings have taken their beginnings…”<br>
<br>
 Springsteen similarly approaches his defense by locating popular music 
within a history of contemporary music before asserting that “[p]op’s 
become . . . a series of new languages, cultural forces, and social 
movements that have inspired and enlivened the second half of the 
twentieth century, and the dawning years of this one.” It is, however, 
also a time that has seen the fragmentation of music in dozens of genres
 and sub-genres (which Springsteen relishes listing) and the erosion of 
personal and public authenticity. Springsteen opens his talk by 
expressing ambivalence over the word “keynote”; he fears it means there 
is a singular view of contemporary music. He strives to overcome genre 
and philosophical divides by focusing on the one thing that might unite 
all artists: the process of creating. His address implies that 
understanding the creative process, rather than the technologies of 
production or genre distinctions, is of primary importance for 
instilling a level of authenticity in what artists do and how they are 
perceived.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s goal is to defend an approach to creativity that depends 
heavily on influence: “its your teachers, your influences, your personal
 history” that will make an artist authentic in a post-authentic world. 
To do that, Springsteen structures his artistic development as a journey
 of discovery of the rock, soul, pop, country, and folk influences that 
have helped him to evaluate his<br>
personal history of growing up poor in small town New Jersey and the 
socio-economic values he considers sedimented in America. He then 
presents an image of that America back to the audience as a way of 
working through his questions about what he is coming to understand. 
Springsteen begins his narrative with Elvis, whom Springsteen remembers 
seeing on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1956. A week later, Springsteen’s 
six-year-old fingers were wrapped around the neck of a rented guitar. 
But even before Elvis changed the world of young Bruce, Springsteen 
brings the audience further back, back to a time when he was too young 
to realize the influence music was having on his life, while eating 
breakfast, listening to doo-wop coming from his mother’s radio:  the 
most sensual music ever made, the sound of raw sex, of silk stockings 
rustling on backseat upholstery, the sound of the snaps of bras popping 
across the [U.S.A.], of wonderful lies being whispered into 
Tabu-perfumed ears, the sound of smeared lipstick, untucked shirts, 
running mascara, tears on your pillow, secrets whispered in the still of
 the night, the high school bleachers and the dark at the YMCA canteen.<br>
<br>
Doo-wop was the stuff of 1950’s teen-agers’ dreams and desires. And 
those dreams and desires “dripped from radios” in the rustic spaces in 
which he found himself: “the gas stations, factories, streets and pool 
halls — the temples of life and mystery in my little hometown.”20 On 
stage Springsteen begins strumming his guitar and singing, “Ooooo whooo.
 Whooo. Whooo.” He says, “Don’t that make you want to kiss somebody?” 
and segues into strumming and singing the opening lines of 
“Backstreets.” Then, commenting on the two rhythms he just strummed, 
Springsteen concludes, “It all comes from the same place.” And that 
musical place for Springsteen has been with him since he was a child. 
Elsewhere, Springsteen told Will Percy, “I didn’t grow up in a community
 of ideas—a place where you can sit down and talk about books, and how 
you read them, and how they affect you.”21 In Springsteen’s household 
there were no books, nor appreciation for books or the development of 
ideas. In this formative vacuum, as Springsteen has stated, “the 
importance of rock &amp; roll was just incredible. It reached down into 
all those homes where there was no music or books or any kind of 
creative sense, and it infiltrated the whole thing.”  In 1981, he told 
an audience in England that the voices coming out of the radio “held out
 a promise, and it was a promise that every man has a right to live his 
life with some decency and respect.”  Springsteen’s education came in 
the form of records, a form of rebellion he later described in “No 
Surrender.”<br>
<br>
After leading the SXSW audience through his early rock education, from 
Roy Orbison to Johnny Cash to Phil Spector’s wall of sound, Springsteen 
comes to The Animals, who were to him “a revelation … the first records 
with full blown class consciousness.” He then starts to play The 
Animals’ “We Gotta Get Out of this Place,” ending with<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">We gotta get out of this place If it’s the last thing we ever do<br>
We gotta get out of this place<br>
Girl, there’s a better life for me and you.<br>
Yes, I know it’s true.</em><br>
<br>
Upon finishing, Springsteen confesses, “That’s every song I’ve ever 
written. Yeah. That’s all of them. I’m not kidding, either. That’s ‘Born
 to Run,’ ‘Born in the [U.S.A.],’ everything I’ve done for the past 40 
years, including all the new ones. But that struck me so deep. It was 
the first time I felt I heard something come across the radio that 
mirrored my home life, my childhood.”  Later, Springsteen comes back to 
the influence of The Animals: “‘Badlands,’ ‘Prove it all Night’—Darkness
 was filled with The Animals, you know? Youngsters, watch this one. I’m 
gonna tell you how it’s done, right now.” Springsteen plays the 
beginning of “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood” and segues into the guitar 
riff from “Badlands” and exclaims, “It’s the same fucking riff, man! 
Listen up, youngsters: this is how successful theft is accomplished, all
 right?”  Springsteen instructs the audience on the multi-genre 
influences found in his songs that blend the emotional and sexual 
rawness of 1950s doo-wop with the class consciousness of 1960s rock. He 
adds to his genre influences by bringing the audience back through the 
sensuality of soul to the grit of country to the immediacy of Woody 
Guthrie. He says at one point, “These men and women, they were and they 
remain my masters.” The emotion and the grit coalesce in Springsteen and
 his open acknowledgement of not just the importance of prior music, but
 what he calls “theft”—and we might now call “remix”— leads to the 
significant intertextuality on display in his work.<br>
<br>
 In “Intertextuality and the Discourse Community,” James Porter uses the
 metaphor of an archaeologist to describe how writers piece together 
prior texts to create new meaning: “Not infrequently, and perhaps ever 
and always, texts refer to other texts and in fact rely on them for 
their meaning. All texts are interdependent: We understand a text only 
insofar as we understand its precursors. This is the principle we know 
as intertextuality.” Springsteen’s music and lyrical themes rely heavily
 on those of his so-called masters and argue for a composing process 
that openly acknowledges influences. When Springsteen inherits and 
incorporates past work, he is also preserving both the music and its 
lineage.<br>
That is the essence of the “folk process,” a term coined by Pete 
Seeger’s father, Charles, to describe “a process which has been going on
 for thousands of years. Ordinary people changing old things to fit new 
situations.”31 The folk process is similar to how Porter describes the 
social life of texts: “Authorial intention is less significant than 
social context; the writer is simply a part of a discourse tradition, a 
member of a team, and a participant in a community of discourse that 
creates its own collective meaning.” By employing elements of 
intertextuality and by adopting a folk process even before he became so 
heavily influenced by the work of Hank Williams and Woody Guthrie in the
 late 1970s and early 1980s and Pete Seeger in the late 1990s, 
Springsteen shows himself to be an artist with not just a historical 
consciousness but also an overt praxis of incorporating the ideas and 
the work of his forebears. An awareness of the past is a significant 
part of what he believes makes music authentic; his subjects and 
characters are grounded in the history of music and literature, the 
socio-economic struggles of the past, and the traumas of the present. 
Like his folk teachers, he brings these all together through an 
awareness of the past in songs that speak the language of ordinary 
people.<br>
<br>
Pete Seeger teaches that European academics coined the phrase “folk 
song” in the nineteenth century “to mean the music of the peasant class,
 ancient and anonymous. In the U.S.A., it was used by people like John 
Lomax, who collected songs of cowboys and lumberjacks, coal miners and 
prisoners in southern chain gangs.” With that definition, one could 
certainly argue that Springsteen’s songs have always been folk; though 
not peasants, his characters have been those hardworking anonymous 
people laboring in factories and foundries, carwashes and construction. 
Indeed, John Hammond signed Springsteen as a folk musician based on his 
Dylanesque folk lyrical prowess, though it wasn’t until Springsteen 
began listening to Hank Williams, Woody Guthrie, and the Folkways 
recordings that he began to see himself as part of their lineage.34 In 
Songs, he describes “The River” as being his “narrative folk voice—just a
 guy in a bar telling his story to the stranger on the next stool.”<br>
<br>
 Talking about Nebraska in 1984 with Roger Scott and Patrick Humphries, 
Springsteen describes the lyrics as folk: “What made the record work 
[was] the sound of real conversation … like you were meeting different 
people, and they just told you what had happened to them, or what was 
happening to them. So, you kind walked for a little bit in their shoes.”
 As Irwin Streight suggests, the songs on Nebraska tell “stories with an
 attention to small revealing details and with a depth and compression 
of characterization that matches the masters of the short story genre.”<br>
<br>
 Consider the opening lines of “Johnny 99”:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Well they closed down the auto plant in Mahwah late that<br>
month<br>
Ralph went out lookin’ for a job but he couldn’t find none<br>
He came home too drunk from mixin’ Tanqueray and wine<br>
He got a gun shot a night clerk now they call’m Johnny 99</em><br>
<br>
In just four lines Springsteen presents Ralph’s past, present, and 
future. The song opens with the closing of the actual Mahwah Ford plant 
in 1980, providing a historical context that sets the tone for the 
entire song. Springsteen shows Ralph’s despair and, using mostly 
monosyllabic words, discusses the events that will, just six verses 
later, lead to Ralph demanding he be executed. Springsteen gives similar
 levels of personal detail and decay in earlier songs like “Growin’ Up,”
 “Thunder Road,” and “Racing in the Street.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s characters, their stories, their suffering, and their 
voices are of utmost importance for him. They exist within a lineage of 
country music, a genre with Hank Williams as its leader that, as Charles
 Lindholm writes, became “the music of the new rootless American working
 class. It articulated a lament of the betrayed wanderer, searching for 
love and settling for lust, far from home, working hard, drinking hard 
and fighting hard, wishing for salvation, and without much hope of ever 
finding it.”<br>
<br>
 In his keynote address, Springsteen says, "<em class="text-italics"> In
 country music, I found the adult blues, the working men’s and women’s 
stories I’d been searching for, the grim recognition of the chips that 
were laid down against you … Country, by its nature, appealed to me. 
Country was provincial, and so was I. I was not downtown. I wasn’t 
particularly Bohemian or hipster. I was kind of hippy-by-circumstance, 
when it happened. But I felt I was an average guy, with a slightly above
 average gift."</em><br>
<br>
The very provinciality of country felt authentic to Springsteen; he 
identified with what he heard. At first, his endeavor was close to 
replication. Marsh suggests that the “Nebraska demos had the quality and
 stillness associated with the great Library of Congress folk recordings
 of the 1930s and 1940s.”40 But that replication remained true to the 
original recordings, remediating an authenticity that signified rustic 
roots in stories crafted to depict a singular version of working-class 
American life. Later, he was able to put folk stories into more formal 
rock contexts on Born in the U.S.A. and Wrecking Ball. On Wrecking Ball,
 for example, Springsteen harnesses prior work to suggest that the past 
and present are inextricably connected. When discussing how hecomposed 
the songs for Wrecking Ball in a wide-ranging interview with the Paris 
media in 2012, Springsteen revealed<br>
those are voices from history and other sides of the grave. If you 
listen to [Wrecking Ball], I use a lot of folk music. There’s some Civil
 War music. There’s gospel music. There are ‘30s horns in “Jack of All 
Trades.” That’s the way I used the music—the idea was that the music was
 going to contextualize historically that this has happened before: It 
happened in the 1970s, it happened in the ‘30s, it happened in the 1800s
 . . . it’s cyclical. Over, and over, and over, and over again. So I try
 to pick up some of the continuity and the historical resonance through 
the music.<br>
<br>
For Springsteen, music is an artifact of the time period in which it was
 created. Springsteen samples prior work in five songs on Wrecking Ball,
 building layers of history into songs about contemporary concerns. “We 
Are Alive” starts with 20 seconds of a needle tracking through a groove,
 sonically alerting the listener to the importance of past forms of 
musical production and simultaneously connecting the song to the rustic 
audio tracks on Nebraska (and by extension the Folkways recordings). The
 folk connection is reinforced by sampling the mariachi-style horns from
 Johnny Cash’s “Ring of Fire,” written by June Carter and Merle Kilgore,
 and originally released by Anita Carter in 1963 on Folk Songs Old and 
New. The track’s “ring” reinforces the conceit of cyclicality found in 
“We Are Alive,” most especially in the song’s protagonists’ Lazarus-like
 rising from the dead. The track’s “fire” spreads to Springsteen’s 
chorus:<br>
<br>
 <em class="text-italics">“We are alive / And though our bodies lie alone here in the dark / Our spirits rise / To carry the<br>
fire and light the spark / To stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart.”</em><br>
<br>
 The chorus emphasizes the continuing legacy of past struggles for fair 
wages and respect. The song challenges the listener to research the 
historical references and think through the complexity of the samples 
and sonic layers. In order to fully appreciate many of the songs on 
Wrecking Ball, one must learn about and listen to the songs that 
Springsteen uses to provide “continuity and historical resonance.” 
Wrecking Ball is an album that holds its full meaning through 
discovering and recovering an ecology of music and histories Springsteen
 has layered and written into it.<br>
<br>
Music producer Mark Hagen once asked Springsteen how he is able to 
compose lyrics that Hagen felt deeply and personally connected to. 
Springsteen responded, “That’s the writer’s job. The writer collects and
 creates … moments from out of his own experience and the world that he 
sees around him. Then you use your imagination and put those things 
together, and you present that experience to your audience.”<br>
<br>
 Springsteen’s response unconsciously echoes T.S. Eliot in “Tradition 
and the Individual Talent”: “The poet’s mind is in fact a receptacle for
 seizing and storing up numberless feelings, phrases, images, which 
remain there until all the particles which can unite to form a new 
compound are present together.” Both Springsteen and Eliot echo William 
Wordsworth’s definition of his own task as a poet in “Preface to Lyrical
 Ballads”:<br>
<br>
 <em class="text-italics">“The principal object . . . was to choose 
incidents and situations from common life, and to relate or describe 
them, throughout, as far as was possible.”</em><br>
<br>
 All three writers describe a composing process situated in the spaces 
they see and experiences they have. This process is called “situated 
cognition” and, according to Margaret A. Syverson, “refers to the fact 
that cognitive processes are always embedded in specific social, 
cultural, and physical-material situations, which determine not only how
 cognitive processes unfold but also the meanings they have for 
participants.” Syverson, for example, has shown how the poems of Charles
 Reznikoff were composed through an evolving ecology of texts: 
notebooks, letters, personal experiences, the experiences of others, 
books, and so on.46 In his poetry, Wordsworth drew heavily on his walks 
and the emotions he had during them, often looking to his sister 
Dorothy’s journal for inspiration years after an event or encounter. 
Each of Eliot’s Four Quartets is inspired by places important to him and
 his family, and parts of The Waste Land describe his exact path through
 London on the way to work. Similarly, Springsteen has collected spaces 
around him and represented them, first in his voluminous notebooks and 
later in songs told through the voices of others—very much as Wordsworth
 does in his ballads and Eliot does in his dramatic monologues.<br>
Though there may be autobiographical elements in Springsteen’s songs 
(and in Eliot’s and Wordsworth’s poems), the stories told and the 
characters created have lives of their own. In a 1999 interview with 
Patrick Humphries focusing on Tracks, Springsteen elaborates on the 
complexity of creating character-driven work that is for the most part 
the product of the artist’s imagination:<br>
I think it calls for the listener to take a step back and realize that 
they’re listening to a creation of some sort, a work of imagination. 
That what you’re doing, part of your craft, is understanding—and you may
 be singing through the voice of another character to create that 
understanding.<br>
<br>
I’ve written in many, many different voices—of which a listener will say that’s obviously not literally your life…<br>
Occasionally, I write something that’s more autobiographical than not, 
but really it just goes all across the board. And I think that to 
over-interpret it, to overpersonalize it, is generally a mistake. As a 
writer you’re paid to use your imagination, and your emotions, and your 
eyes, to create something that is real—in the sense that there’s real 
emotion. And I think that whatever you’re writing about, you have to 
find yourself in there in some fashion. That’s what makes the song work.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is working through the process of creating work that has a 
life for itself; it may be informed by his experiences and contain a 
significant amount of self in the form of a unique perspective, but once
 it is written down, the work itself becomes the important thing. The 
writer’s history, life, and experiences at that moment of artistic 
creation are no longer as important as what is happening in the work. 
Springsteen again echoes Eliot, who argues that when a poet creates art,
 “[w]hat happens is a continual surrender of himself as he is at the 
moment to something which is more valuable. The progress of an artist is
 a continual self-sacrifice, a continual extinction of personality.” For
 Eliot, “[p]oetry is not the turning loose of emotion, but an escape 
from emotion; it is not the expression of personality but an escape from
 personality. … [S]ignificant emotion [should have] its life in the poem
 and not in the history of the poet.”<br>
<br>
 Springsteen considers “real emotion” and Eliot considers “significant 
emotion” emerging from the writing itself, not from within the 
personality—or the history—of the writer. At the time of writing, 
authors must separate themselves from the subjects they are writing 
about. Springsteen and Eliot have both channeled emotions into the 
stories they create and the “many, many different voices” of their 
protagonists. Like Springsteen, Eliot’s most famous poems are 
character-driven: “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” (1917), 
“Gerontion” (1920), “The Hollow Men” (1925), “The Journey of the Magi” 
(1927), the protagonists of Four Quartets (1935-1942), even the poems in
 Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats (1939). The original working title 
of The Waste Land was He Do the Police in Different Voices, borrowed 
from a line in Charles Dickens’s last novel, Our Mutual Friend 
(1864-1865): “You mightn’t think it, but Sloppy is a beautiful reader of
 a newspaper. He do the Police in different voices.”50 He Do the Police 
in Different Voices was an appropriate early title for The Waste Land 
for at least two reasons that are important for thinking about 
Springsteen’s many voices. First, the poem is rife with voices: the 
unnamed protagonist, Marie, the hyacinth girl, Madame Sosotris, a couple
 talking about nerves, women in the pub, and Tiresias, to name a few. 
Second, the title calls attention to the illiterate and anonymous lower 
classes of society, those who are normally not represented in high art. 
Indeed, as David Chinitz notes, for Eliot “popular culture was 
significant as both influence and subject. … The Waste Land would have 
openly established popular culture as a major intertext of modernist 
poetry if [Ezra] Pound had not edited out most of Eliot’s popular 
references.”  In the manuscript of The Waste Land, the early draft 
titled He Do the Police in Different Voices starts with the lines -<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“First we had a couple feelers down at Tom’s 
place / There was old Tom, boiled to the eyes, blind,” which anticipates
 the later pub passage that Eliot kept in the final version:<br>
Now Albert’s coming back, make yourself a bit smart.<br>
He’ll want to know what you done with that money he<br>
gave you<br>
To get yourself some teeth. He did, I was there.<br>
You have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set,<br>
He said, I swear, I can’t bear to look at you.<br>
And no more can’t I, I said, and think of poor Albert,<br>
He’s been in the army four years, he wants a good time,<br>
And if you don’t give it him, there’s others will, I said.<br>
Oh is there, she said. Something o’ that, I said.<br>
Then I’ll know who to thank, she said, and give me a<br>
straight look.</em><br>
<br>
These are the voices of London’s lower-class, sitting in a pub near 
closing time, anticipating Lil’s husband Albert’s imminent return from 
World War I, debating how to tell Albert that the money he left for her 
to fix her teeth was used for an abortion. Eliot presents the 
conversation with a tone and diction he considers consistent with those 
of lower-class London. Gregory S. Jay suggests Eliot’s “often 
affectionate imitation of [lower-class] voices … conveys a respect for …
 ordinary lives and feelings.”<br>
<br>
 Chinitz highlights this affection in a passage from The Waste Land:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">O City City, I can sometimes hear<br>
Beside a public bar in Lower Thames Street,<br>
The pleasant whining of a mandoline<br>
And a clatter and a chatter from within<br>
Where fishmen lounge at noon</em><br>
<br>
The words “pleasant,” “clatter,” and “chatter” indicate an affection for
 the working-class people in this public bar. But, like many of Eliot’s 
modernist protagonists, the protagonist of The Waste Land is alienated 
from this interior. There may be affection for the working-class, but 
there is no connection. Conversely, if this were on Nebraska or The 
Ghost of Tom Joad, the protagonists would be in a bar, drinking, and 
Springsteen would tell their stories rather than describe sounds heard 
through the walls.<br>
<br>
Eliot’s use of lower-class voices in The Waste Land is similar to 
Springsteen’s adoption of working-class voices and Wordsworth’s 
assertions about the role of the poet and the subjects of poetry. In the
 1802 version of his “Preface to Lyrical Ballads,”<br>
Wordsworth warns against poets who use high diction and elevated 
language. For Wordsworth, doing so only results in separating authors 
from their potential audience.55 Rather, Wordsworth’s poems contain, as 
he claims, “a selection of language really used by men … Humble and 
rustic life was generally chosen … because in that condition of life our
 elementary feelings coexist in a state of greater simplicity, and, 
consequently, may be more accurately contemplated, and more forcibly 
communicated.”56 Wordsworth uses the language of the common citizen 
because he believes that common language holds an authenticity and 
resonance that elevated language or rhetoric cannot. For example, 
consider the “The Thorn,” a poem in which the protagonist (a retired sea
 captain) is talking to another, speculating about the history of a 
decrepit thorn tree at the top of a hill. In telling the story of the 
tree, the sea captain is encouraged to tell the story of Martha, a women
 engaged to a man named Stephen who, after getting Martha pregnant, 
marries another woman. Bereft, lost, and seemingly mad, Martha wanders 
the landscape alone, her fate and the fate of her baby mostly unknown 
until the interlocutor demands it:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“<em class="text-italics">But what’s the Thorn? and what the pond?<br>
And what the hill of moss to her?<br>
And what the creeping breeze that comes<br>
The little pond to stir?”<br>
“I cannot tell; but some will say<br>
She hanged her baby on the tree;<br>
Some say she drowned it in the pond.<br>
Which is a little step beyond<br>
But all and each agree,<br>
The little Babe was buried there,<br>
Beneath that hill of moss so fair.</em>”<br>
<br>
The language of Wordsworth’s protagonist and interlocutor is simple, 
containing mostly short words, none of which has more than two 
syllables. The phrases are direct and frank. Though containing “simple 
and unelaborated expressions,” the poem subtly conveys the feelings and 
psychology of its protagonist and subject. The thorn is much more than a
 tree; it is a space of mourning, forever entwined with the story of 
Martha and her dead child.<br>
<br>
Springsteen would write similarly frank, predominantly monosyllabic, and
 deceptively simple lines nearly two hundred years later in dozens of 
songs, such as “Nebraska,” “Johnny 99,” and “Galveston Bay.” On each of 
these and many similar tracks the narrative is set in a certain 
geographical space: Lincoln, Nebraska; Mahwah, New Jersey; Seabrook, 
Texas. Each geographical location becomes a code for a larger 
socio-cultural issue. Lincoln, a “town” in “Nebraska” instead of city, 
rising out of the plains, signifies desolation. Mahwah, which once 
boasted the largest auto assembly plant in the country, signifies 
economic downturn. Seabrook, a town of harbors where Clear Lake merges 
with Galveston Bay, signifies disruption. In Springsteen’s more Romantic
 songs, natural settings carry similar levels of signification as they 
did to the Romantic poets: a river valley signifies youth (“The River”);
 a hill top signifies hierarchy (“Mansion on the Hill”); moonlight 
signifies hope (“Downbound Train”). In 1997, Springsteen told Nicholas 
Dawidoff, “I had an interest of writing about the country—all of it. I 
was creating intimate portraits of individuals that you can draw back 
from and look at them in the context of the country they live in. You 
have to find circumstances where those characters resonate with 
psychological, emotional, and, by implication, political issues.”59 By 
the mid-1990s, Springsteen had become proficient at writing lyrics that 
made connections between an environment (context) and the kinds of 
stories (circumstances) that could be told about people in those spaces.
 The power in his songs comes in the interplay of these two key lyrical 
structures: context and circumstance.<br>
<br>
Wordsworth was a master at connecting context and circumstance to lead 
to psychological resonance. In the “Preface to Lyrical Ballads,” 
Wordsworth argues that the poet considers man and the objects that 
surround him as acting and re-acting upon each other, so as to produce 
an infinite complexity of pain and pleasure; he considers man in his own
 nature and in his ordinary life as contemplating this with a certain 
quantity of immediate knowledge, with certain convictions, intuitions, 
and deductions, which from habit acquire the quality of intuitions; he 
considers him as looking upon this complex scene of ideas and 
sensations, and finding everywhere objects that immediately excite in 
him sympathies.<br>
<br>
According to Wordsworth, a poet illuminates the nuanced, emotional, and 
symbiotic relationship between a person and the objects surrounding that
 person. Context—ordinary context—is of ultimate importance. Only when 
considering people in their ordinary natural spaces can a poet reveal a 
person’s value system and the immediate emotions emerging from being in a
 particular space at a particular time. “Once again / Do I behold these 
step and lofty cliffs, / That on a wild and secluded scene impress / 
Thoughts of a more deep seclusion,” Wordsworth writes at the beginning 
of “Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey.” The ordinary 
context of a view over the River Wye when mixed with the protagonist’s 
psyche results in the emotional response. Garman suggests that 
Springsteen uses “working-class geographies to illustrate the 
dissolution of working-class communities” that leads to an inability to 
“forge a collective working-class identity which provides people with a 
sense of self-worth.”<br>
<br>
 The factories in “Johnny 99,” “Factory,” and “Youngstown” are not just 
physical objects. Rather, they are icons of a fragmented American dream.
 Or, as poet James Wolcott once quipped, “<em class="text-italics">Silent
 factories are to [Springsteen] what church ruins were to the English 
Romantics, crumbling theaters of decay which serve as houses of lost 
faith.”</em><br>
<br>
But, rather than the mere presentation of American icons, Springsteen 
also engages in pointed social commentary. By adopting the voices of 
ordinary citizens he advocates for those who have been forgotten. During
 his interview with the Paris media,<br>
Springsteen summarized his oeuvre this way: “My work has always been 
about judging the distance between American reality and the American 
dream—how far it is at any given moment.” He draws on the debilitating 
home life of his childhood, looking “toward not just the psychological 
reasons in [his] house, but the social forces that played upon [his] 
home and made life more difficult.”65 In his SXSW talk, Springsteen 
walks the audience through his experience listening to Hank Williams, 
spin after spin on the turntable, trying to figure out what made 
Williams’s music important for him (and society) at that moment. 
Finally, his “ears became accustomed to its beautiful simplicity, and 
its darkness and depth.” Springsteen saw himself reflected in the 
characters populating Williams’s songs. He found themes with which he 
wanted to engage. But country, as he remarks, was “rarely politically 
angry, and it was rarely politically critical. And I realized that that 
fatalism had a toxic element.” No one in country music was asking why 
things were the way they were, which was something Springsteen started 
doing in the early 1980s after reading Henry Steel Commanger and Allen 
Nevins’s History of the United States. While reading this book, 
Springsteen told a Paris audience, he “started to learn about how things
 got to be the way they are today, how you end up a victim without even 
knowing it. And how people get old and just die after not having hardly a
 day’s satisfaction or peace of mind in their lives.Springsteen wanted 
to know what contributes to creating a state of mind that accepts 
stagnation. Country music depicted stagnation, but never questioned why,
 according to Springsteen. Guthrie was asking those questions: “Woody’s 
gaze was set on today’s hard times. But also, somewhere over the 
horizon, there was something. Woody’s world was a world where fatalism 
was tempered by a practical idealism. It was a world where speaking 
truth to power wasn’t futile, whatever its outcome.” In “Tradition and 
the Individual Talent,” T.S. Eliot argues that artists who wish to 
remain significant must have an “historical sense[, which] involves a 
perception, not only of the pastness of the past, but of its presence. …
 This historical sense, which is a sense of the timeless as well of the 
temporal, is what makes a writer traditional.” In The Waste Land, Eliot 
incorporates texts ranging from Ovid’s Metamorphosis to popular Ziegfeld
 Follies. By weaving together fragments of the works of antiquity with 
elements of Modernist popular culture and ideology, Eliot is arguing 
that all texts, regardless of their time of origin, can—and should—be 
looked to when considering contemporary concerns. He insists that to be 
traditional a “poet must develop or procure the consciousness of the 
past and … should continue to develop this consciousness throughout his 
career.”<br>
<br>
As an artist, Springsteen has continued to develop his own consciousness
 of the past, and at each stage in his education he has attempted to 
incorporate into his writing and music what he has uncovered. For 
example, when choosing songs for We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions 
Springsteen specifically chose songs that he could “make ‘of the moment’
 . . . so you’re connected to this present world.”<br>
<br>
 In the liner notes to The Seeger Sessions, Springsteen recalls the time
 in 1997 when he brought home a dozen Seeger records that transformed 
his understanding of folk music and its musical potential. For The 
Seeger Sessions, Springsteen describes seeking out stories he could “add
 [his] two cents to as an interpreter,” something he suggests he has 
“done only very rarely in the past.” Springsteen’s interpretation of 
songs on The Seeger Sessions often includes shifting them to a minor key
 and adding blues, Cajun, or other rhythms, but his most significant 
updating comes in his version of “How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times 
and Live?” Blind Alfred Reed originally recorded the song on December 4,
 1929, as a response to the Great Depression. His version ends with the 
following lines:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Well, the doctor comes around with a face all bright,<br>
And he says in a little while you’ll be all right.<br>
All he gives is a humbug pill,<br>
A dose of dope and a great big bill —<br>
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?74<br>
Springsteen’s version takes Reed’s last verse and builds from there:<br>
“Me and my old school pals had some mighty high times<br>
down here<br>
And what happened to you poor black folks, well it just<br>
ain’t fair”<br>
He took a look around, gave a little pep talk, said “I’m with<br>
you” then he took a little walk<br>
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?</em><br>
<br>
Springsteen’s version presents an indictment of the George W. Bush 
administration’s handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The 
second and third verses are inspired by news reports of Bush’s photo-op 
filled visit to New Orleans in the days after the devastating flooding 
in 2005. Along with the power that comes from using common language and 
emotional description in ways consistent with Wordsworth’s approach to 
writing, the lines allude to the corruption described in Reed’s 
original:<br>
Most our preachers preach for gold and not for souls That’s what keeps a
 poor man always in a hole We can hardly get our breath Taxed and 
schooled and preached to death / Tell me how can a poor man stand such 
times and live?<br>
<br>
By using Reed’s last verse as his first, Springsteen signals that the 
song will be an extension of the original song’s decrying of economic 
conditions and shows his appreciation for what Eliot described as “not 
only of the pastness of the past, but of its presence.” In Reed’s 
version, the doctor is an active contributor to the financial inequality
 discussed in the song, an inequality felt by many of those who were 
victims of the flooding. In Springsteen’s version, “the doctor” is 
President Bush, whose bright, happy face is that of a shyster promising 
healing but leaving only bills. The anachronism present in the work 
succeeds in placing the song on a historical continuum, blending the 
traumas of the past with those of the present, allowing the listener to 
understand a lineage of suffering and perceptions of an ineffective 
government, making it seem like the whole history of blues and 
suffering, in Eliot’s words, “has a simultaneous existence and composes a
 simultaneous order” in the space of just one song.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Springsteen, Authenticity, and Legacy</strong><br>
<br>
When Springsteen broaches the subject of authenticity in his SXSW 
keynote, he is likely taking a jab at—or at the very least, 
refuting—those who have questioned his authenticity. Springsteen has 
continually challenged the perception that his enormous net worth and 
celebrity status contradict the messages of his songs. As he told Ed 
Bradley on 60 Minutes in 1995, “I believe that your fundamental point of
 view and politics comes out of some core emotional and psychological 
picture and is established by your early experience of life.” When 
Springsteen appeared on the covers of Time and Newsweek in 1975 he was 
labeled a corporate stooge; when he released Born in the U.S.A. he was 
labeled a sell-out; when he married Julianne Philips he was cast as out 
of touch with his New Jersey roots; when Sony released the Wal-Mart 
exclusive version of his greatest hits (which Springsteen agreed was a 
mistake) he was accused of going against the community-based principles 
and labor advocacy he has espoused throughout his career. Scholars of 
popular culture have wrestled with Springsteen’s authenticity for 
decades, noting and/or questioning any or all of the following: his 
humble roots, slow rise, major breakthroughs, various appropriations, 
personal decisions, rebirth post-9/11, concert performances, and 
political and marketing decisions. Indeed, there’s hardly an article, 
interview, or broadcast that does not adhere to this narrative or, like 
the 60 Minutes and Paris interviews, ask Springsteen to reveal his 
authenticity by discussing how his roots have affected his psyche. In 
1984, Springsteen told Kurt Loder, “I realized that I was a rich man, 
but I felt like a poor man inside.”<br>
<br>
 Springsteen echoed that sentiment in “Better Days,” confessing, “It’s a
 sad funny ending to find yourself pretending / A rich man in a poor 
man’s shirt.”<br>
<br>
My goal here, however, is not to rehash these claims; such discussions 
are important contributions to understanding Springsteen and his work 
within a post-modern context, but they are beyond my scope. Nor is my 
goal to question the authenticity of Springsteen as he presents his SXSW
 address. That is, I am not interested in making an argument about 
whether or not<br>
 Springsteen at the podium is an accurate version of 
Springsteen-the-artist or one manufactured to maintain a real or 
imagined narrative of Springsteen as man of the people. And, as is 
readily apparent, Springsteen’s conception of the working class (as is 
Wordsworth’s, for that matter) is an idealized, nostalgic, romanticized,
 and problematic depiction of a group of people who are significantly 
more diverse than he suggests. Jefferson Cowie and Lauren Boehm as well 
as Elizabeth Seymour engage with these ideas thoroughly in their 
scholarship.<br>
<br>
Rather, I am interested in testing the limits of Springsteen’s 
definition of authenticity as it moves from creativity and influence to 
legacy. Springsteen’s definition of authenticity is very much consistent
 with how we as a society have come to define something as authentic. 
According to Lindholm, there are “two overlapping modes for 
characterizing any entity as authentic: genealogical or historical 
(origin) and identity or correspondence (content). Authentic objects, 
persons, and collectives are original, real, pure; they are what they 
purport to be, their roots are known and verified, their essence and 
appearance are one.”82 In this setting, Springsteen positions what he 
calls “the genesis and power of creativity” within a definition of 
authenticity that exists within a known and verifiable lineage of 
influence—doing very much what Shumway describes when he writes, “A 
genealogy of rock authenticity would look at jazz, folk, and pop music 
as the determining elements of its family tree.”83 Yet, how far into the
 work of and principles espoused by the artists should that lineage 
extend? Should it stay within the songs themselves or should it bleed 
into their social and political goals? What impact should Springsteen’s 
definitions of creativity and authenticity have on his legacy? 
Springsteen has clearly decided to let the social and activist 
influences of artists like Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger affect the way 
he positions his work and himself as an artist and a human being. The 
presence of food banks at concerts, which Springsteen encourages 
concertgoers to donate to, is just one example of how Springsteen blends
 his personal beliefs with advocacy. At some point he decided to become 
the living embodiment of Guthrie’s and Seeger’s legacies. Robert 
Santelli suggests that whenever Springsteen sings “This Land is Your 
Land” he becomes “a part of the ongoing story of American music and its 
role in enriching American culture.”84 Springsteen maintains that role 
at the close of his SXSW talk when, in true Pete Seeger fashion, he 
encourages the audience to sing along with the chorus of “This Land is 
Your Land.” In doing so, he succeeds in making Guthrie’s words, and 
Seeger’s efforts at keeping these words alive, meaningful for those in 
the audience.<br>
<br>
More interesting, however, is the verse from “This Land is Your Land” 
Springsteen chooses to sing: the so-called controversial fourth verse, 
which argues against the idea of land and resources made private by the 
rich. The verse was inspired by Guthrie’s<br>
experiences seeing poor people employed to work at reduced wages on huge
 swaths of land owned by the wealthy. At Seeger’s insistence, 
Springsteen and Seeger sang the fourth and fifth verses at Obama’s first
 inauguration. That was the first and only other (known) time 
Springsteen has sung the fourth verse in front of an audience; my 
research reveals that in concert he has only sung the less controversial
 first three verses. Springsteen’s decision to sing the fourth verse 
instead of the less controversial verses may have been a nod to the 
legacy of Guthrie, who was being celebrated that year at SXSW. But, it 
also leads one to question how fully Springsteen embodies the ideals the
 verse aspires to promote: the free and open exchange and use of 
cultural resources. Read metaphorically, the verse is about any property
 one group of owners withholds from others, be they land owners or, say,
 the recording industry. When considered within Springsteen’s SXSW 
keynote assertion that successful theft (or influence) as creative 
inspiration is an important part of what makes one authentic, it is hard
 not to make a connection between the verse he sings and what 
Springsteen advocates in his talk. Kirby Ferguson, writer and director 
of the Everything’s a Remix documentary series, argues that creativity 
contains three main elements: copying, transforming, and combining. <br>
<br>
To borrow Springsteen’s terminology, we copy the ideas of our teachers 
and influences (which he did as a young musician copying Elvis, the 
Beatles, Joe Cocker, Van Morrison, and Dylan); once we are confident, we
 transform them into something new (which is how “Don’t Let Me Be 
Misunderstood” becomes “Badlands”); and then combine multiple ideas to 
create something new and exciting (such as the blending of genres on 
Seeger Sessions and Wrecking Ball). When the creative process is allowed
 to flourish—that is, when expressions of ideas (such as lyrics) are 
free to be used by many—culture benefits. When they are not—that is, 
when owners lock expressions of ideas away—culture suffers. This is in 
part why Santelli writes that Springsteen is “enriching American 
culture” when he sings “This Land is Your Land.” By passing on the song,
 Springsteen is also passing on the legacies of Guthrie and Seeger as 
well as the ideals upon which the song was founded.<br>
<br>
Seeger has written, “I have spent a life ‘borrowing’ others’ ideas. I 
really can’t object if people borrow some of mine. I am glad if someone 
can improve my songs.” In the introduction to the second edition of How 
to Play the 5-string Banjo, Seeger gives permission to “reprint, 
whenever needed.” In a 1957 letter to Lynn Riggs, Seeger describes the 
pride he takes when others sing or reprint his songs, which he gives 
permission to do. He laments the fact that he was finally persuaded to 
“copyright the various songs I have either written new words to, or 
music, or both—in order to keep them from being restricted by the 
Broadway pirates. But it is one thing to copyright in order to prevent 
restrictions upon it, and another thing to copyright a song in order to 
restrict it.” Seeger understood when a singer passes a song on from one 
generation to the next, the singer is giving a gift to that generation’s
 culture. He also understood that copyright, which was designed to 
protect culture and not corporate interests, was being transformed into 
an institution that protects corporations at the expense of culture. He 
embodied the idea that music is a process of change over time, through 
which musicians build on and transform the work of prior artists, 
resulting in music that is no longer by just one person; it is music by 
the people “because so many folks have had a hand (or a throat) in 
shaping them.” He actively sought to reform the International Public 
Domain to ensure original artists whose work has passed into the public 
domain, but has been adapted by new artists, receive a percentage of the
 future royalties. Seeger’s goal was to combat a musical colonialism of 
songs from poorer areas and nations that one day will “be collected and 
new words put to them in some wealthy city somewhere. The 
poverty-stricken village will stay poverty stricken.” In other words, 
Seeger was consistent in his approach to folk music and his ideals about
 preserving a folk process.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s legacy as a musician has been solidified. His legacy as a 
cultural ambassador advocating for the arts is just beginning. In his 
SXSW talk, Springsteen emphasizes “it’s the power and purpose of your 
music that still matters” for one to be considered authentic. The 
purpose of one’s music extends beyond the lyrics and the score. It 
extends to how artists position themselves in relation to the social 
institutions designed to structure the lives of citizens. Springsteen 
has shown his power and<br>
purpose by advocating for gay marriage as early as 1996, by speaking out
 against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, by lending his voice to the 
2014 Shoah Foundation fundraising gala, to name only a few instances. 
When Jon Landau supported high prices for concert downloads, he noted 
they were consistent with what Pearl Jam and Phish have been charging. 
More purposeful and powerful might have been to offer downloads for 
free, looking to artists like Radiohead, Nine Inch Nails, and Coldplay, 
who have bypassed labels and released albums for free or on a 
pay-what-you-want basis. Nine Inch Nails encourages fans to remix tracks
 and upload them to the band’s web site, cementing a direct connection 
between fans and artist and making an argument about the anachronism of a
 label-centric recording industry. Perhaps Springsteen might do that 
with an upcoming album. Or let fans pay what they can afford for concert
 audio. As BruceFunds has brought to light, many fans do not have the 
means to pay for a ticket and many others have the means to donate.95 I 
suspect many do not have the means to pay for concert downloads, either.
 By asking fans to pay and by creating two tiers of audio quality (MP3 
and the more expensive FLAC), Springsteen and his management team 
recreate the social hierarchies Springsteen rails against in his songs.<br>
Springsteen has reached a stage in his career where people actively seek
 him out as the conscience of society. During his interview with the 
Paris media, one reporter observed, “so many people these past couple 
years look to you for your interpretation of events. … so many people 
care about what you think, and what you feel about what is happening in 
the world.”<br>
<br>
 Robert Santelli has suggested that “Springsteen was America in the eyes
 of his fans and much of the world.” The last decade has seen 
Springsteen transform from rock and roll singer to social critic. 
Springsteen’s SXSW talk puts him in a lineage that includes some of the 
most important writers and thinkers to defend traditional or authentic 
processes for creating art (what Eliot defines as traditional; 
Springsteen labels authentic). If he made a statement in favor of the 
free flow of information (as Seeger did in his defense of the public 
domain and as Springsteen’s lawyers’ are doing by pointing scholars to 
the Fair Use Doctrine for quoting his lyrics), people would listen. 
Something might change. It might put him on a path toward removing 
himself from the corporate structures that actively attempt to limit the
 creative processes Springsteen advocates. It would reinforce his 
commitment to a traditional and authentic approach to composing that 
encourages artists to borrow from their influences without the fear of 
repercussion that stagnates artistic growth. It would show Springsteen 
continuing his journey to embrace fully Guthrie’s and Seeger’s 
influences, to adopt fully the traditional, folk-infused creative 
process he illuminates in his SXSW keynote address, and to emerge fully 
as a cultural ambassador for the arts.</em></div>

BY  JULIAN GARCIA <br>
 <br>
NEW YORK DAILY NEWS<br>
 Friday, March 27, 2015.</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen performed one of his most highly-regarded concerts 
just over 34 years ago at one of New York's least-respected venues. And 
now fans of the Boss can relive those glory days by downloading the show
 on his website.<br>
<br>
There is a price to pay, of course, but it's worth every penny.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's New Year's Eve 1980 show at the Nassau Coliseum went on sale on his website (<a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/" class="postlink">www.brucespringsteen.net</a>)
 this week, with digital downloads available in multiple formats for 
prices ranging from $9.95 to $24.95. A CD copy of the show can be 
purchased for $23.<br>
<br>
The show is famous among hardcore Bruce fans and has been widely 
circulated among bootleggers. But the sound quality of these downloads 
is remarkable and the performance is even better, with a setlist that 
even the most picky Springsteen fans could not be disappointed with.<br>
<br>
The show – recorded at the Coliseum in the months between the Islanders'
 first two of four straight Stanley Cup titles there – opens with Bruce 
asking the crowd, “Are you ready to send out 1980?” before the E Street 
Band explodes into a wild version of the song “Night” off his “Born to 
Run” album from five years prior.<br>
<br>
Springsteen on that night performed 12 songs off his album “The River,” 
which he had been touring behind for three months at that point. Two 
prior shows at the Coliseum took place on the 28th and 29th of December.
 Several songs included on his live box set “75-85” were recorded during
 the Coliseum gigs.<br>
<br>
The live version of Springsteen's holiday radio staple, “Merry 
Christmas, Baby” was recorded on this evening, with the Boss and his 
band also playing “Auld Lang Syne” just after he counted down from 10 to
 ring in the New Year. Later, he performed “Santa Claus is Coming to 
Town” as the first of his six-song encore, which also included “Born to 
Run” and “Jungleland.”<br>
<br>
Other highlights include E Street Band keyboardist Roy Bittan playing a 
snippet of “Once Upon A Time in the West” as an intro the first-pumping 
“Badlands” and the crowd-pleasing “Rosalita” to close out the main set 
of the 38-song concert.<br>
<br>
This particular show is considered perhaps the best concert ever held at
 Long Island's Nassau Coliseum, which is soon to lose its longest 
resident, the Islanders, to Brooklyn's Barclays Center. The Coliseum 
will be renovated and used for more concerts – though it's unlikely any 
will match the energy of the one Springsteen played there 34 years ago.</div>

<br>
From " BRUCE" by Peter Ames Carlin<br>
</strong><br>
T HE CRITICAL APPRAISALS GREETING BORN TO RUN read like news accounts of
 the second coming. “The purest glimpse of the passion and power of rock
 ’n’ roll in nearly a decade,” sang the Los Angeles Times ’ Robert 
Hilburn. Which sounded pretty good until you read the thoughts of the 
New York Times ’ chief music critic, John Rockwell: “Mr. Springsteen’s 
gifts are so powerful and so diverse that it’s difficult even to try to 
describe them in a short space . . . you owe it to yourself to buy this 
record.” Pick up Rolling Stone , and there came Greil Marcus, one rock 
critic who could score a few points against Landau in an intellectual 
knife fight, declaring Born to Run “a magnificent album that pays off on
 every bet ever placed on [Springsteen].” At Creem the review came from 
the nicotine- yellow fingers of Lester Bangs, the gonzo critic whose 
acidic pen could reduce overblown music and musicians into a foul- 
smelling puddle. But while Bangs acknowledged the whiff of Barnum in 
Columbia’s publicity campaign (“one of the biggest hypes in recent 
memory”), his enthusiasm for the music itself overwhelmed everything 
else. “Bruce Springsteen is an American archetype, and Born to Run will 
probably be the finest record released this year,” Bangs wrote. And 
there was more: “In a time of squalor and belittled desire, 
Springsteen’s music is majestic and passionate with no apologies . . . 
[and] we can soar with him, enjoying the heady rush of another gifted 
urchin cruising at the peak of his powers and feeling his oats as he 
gets it right, that chord, and the last word ever on a hoodlum’s 
nirvana.” <br>
<br>
As the momentum behind Born to Run strengthened, so did the tidal 
conclusion that the album, like Bruce himself, was nothing short of 
heroic: God’s gift to the culturally blighted 1970s. Which put the New 
Dylan business to shame and added that much more momentum to the 
skepticism of writers and critics who didn’t have an ear for Bruce’s 
music but did have an eye for the magical blend of hype and herd 
mentality. And what could anyone make of the many connections between 
the über- critic circuit and Springsteen’s already incestuous inner 
circle? Any observant reader of rock magazines and other youth culture 
journals would recognize Landau’s name from his many reviews and 
columns, and from his record review editor title at Rolling Stone . And 
while the reader might not guess that Marcus and Landau were longtime 
friends— and that the former had in fact recommended the latter for his 
editorship— she could undoubtedly entertain herself wondering if 
Marcus’s personal and professional bonds to Landau (his titular editor 
at Rolling Stone ) might have influenced his enthusiasm for Born to Run .
 And, of course, Landau was also a close friend of the writer Dave 
Marsh, who had escorted Landau to his first Bruce show in the spring of 
1974, introduced the two men, and then encouraged Landau to publish the 
“I Saw Rock and Roll Future” column at Boston’s Real Paper . <br>
<br>
It would be more of a leap to suggest that Marsh, who came up through 
the Detroit- based offices of Creem , had somehow bedazzled Bangs into 
writing his rave review. But Marsh had also written a glowing profile of
 Bruce that Creem published the month before Bangs’s review ran, which 
reintroduced the thought of insider groupthink. Either that, or the 
canniness on the part of a lightly educated New Jersey guitarist who had
 intuited that any artist who could fuse Bob Dylan’s subterranean 
braininess with Elvis Presley’s sexual outrageousness would be the very 
image of the brainy rock critic’s fondest imaginings. So maybe it wasn’t
 difficult to understand what the New York Times ’ Henry Edwards meant 
when he proposed, just after the first wave of Born to Run reviews 
flooded the media, that “if Bruce Springsteen didn’t already exist, the 
critics would have had to invent him.” 1 And there was more to come. 
Months after issuing the edict that Bruce would give no print interviews
 that weren’t guaranteed to be a part of a cover story (a bluff move 
that grew into a necessity when the wave of attention swelled to tidal 
proportions), Appel got a call from an editor at Newsweek saying that 
the magazine was ready to commit to putting Bruce on its cover. Both of 
the nation’s leading newsweeklies had already devoted column inches to 
Bruce, starting with Time magazine’s generous coverage of both Greetings
 and The Wild, the Innocent , while Newsweek ran a midsized, interview- 
free but largely upbeat 2 feature pegged to Born to Run ’s release in 
late August. This time, however, Newsweek wanted to publish a deeply 
reported piece. “In those days having an entertainer on the cover was a 
hallowed bit of ground,” says Maureen Orth, the Newsweek writer assigned
 to write and lead the reporting for the piece. “But [the editors] loved
 him, and when I saw him perform in Asbury Park I thought, ‘Oh my God, 
he’s a great, great performer.’” Still, the buzz coming from sources who
 had spoken either with Orth or the staff reporters also working the 
story indicated that Newsweek planned to focus on Bruce less as a 
dynamic new artist but as the latest in a series of industrially created
 pop idols. <br>
<br>
When Time magazine culture writer Jay Cocks got wind of the Newsweek 
story- in- progress, what he heard made him think that his competitors 
were out to trash their subject. A fan of Bruce’s first two albums who 
heard Born to Run as a significant addition to the American rock ’n’ 
roll catalog, Cocks took Newsweek ’s plans with two kinds of umbrage: he
 hated letting the crosstown rivals run away with the Springsteen story,
 and he especially hated the snide package they were, by all 
indications, wrapping him in. “I thought it would have been a killing 
representation of an important American artist,” Cocks says. “I thought 
Time magazine should make a countermove. And I’d always wanted to write 
about him. Plain and simple.” Marching into the office of his editor, 
Martha Duffy, Cocks explained what Newsweek was up to and pitched his 
idea of taking them on head- to- head. Duffy got it all immediately and 
convinced the magazine’s top editors to let them go after their own 
Springsteen cover story. When Orth learned that her crosstown 
competitors were also on the case she went back to Appel and Bruce to 
argue that they were making a big mistake. “Bruce wasn’t big enough to 
sustain both covers, given what they meant,” she says. “I said, ‘You’re 
going to live to regret this.’ ” For the editors of the magazines, the 
dueling stories became a game of chicken. While both recognized the 
absurdity of putting the same somewhat obscure pop star on their covers 
in the same week, neither could imagine backing down, particularly when 
gossip about the dueling stories swept across the media filled canyons 
of midtown Manhattan. “Pretty outlandish, eh?” Appel says, blue eyes 
sparkling with glee. <br>
<br>
But even as Bruce seemed on track to appear on both of America’s leading
 newsweeklies, the never- ending avalanche of publicity, reviews, and 
coverage made him feel increasingly queasy. “I used to feel I was always
 in control,” he grumbled to the UK New Musical Express ’s Andrew Tyler.
 “Now I’m not so sure.” Talking to Cocks, Bruce said he had no idea what
 the “commotion” could be about. “I feel like I’m on the outside of all 
this, even though I know I’m on the inside.” When Newsweek ’s Orth got 
her interview, Bruce called his new notoriety a nuisance. “ What 
phenomenon?” he asked. “We’re driving around, and we ain’t no 
phenomenon. The hype just gets in the way.” And if Bruce thought the 
Born to Run publicity had already grown to absurd proportions, he was 
kidding himself. Dated October 27, but available a week earlier, the 
Time and Newsweek covers hit the  country on the same day. 
Unsurprisingly, the double- barreled magazine coverage created its own 
moment in the media culture. Cocks’s story in Time , titled “Rock’s New 
Sensation,” celebrated his subject’s achievements while also sketching 
his past (in the terms that Bruce chose to reveal it) and the outlines 
of his daily life. Orth’s piece (reported in part by Janet Huck and 
Peter S. Greenberg), led with a “Making of a Pop Star” headline on the 
magazine’s cover, while the story itself veered between favorable 
accounts of Bruce’s shows and music, and at times caustic analyses 
provided by New York Times critic Henry Edwards (whose anti- Springsteen
 essay served as the first critical take in the piece) and by Joe Smith,
 the president of Columbia’s main competitor, Warner Bros. Records. 
Smith compared Bruce to Elton John and Warners’s own James Taylor and 
found him wanting. Speaking now, Orth says her only intent was to write 
an accurate portrayal. “I felt like I needed to report the story out,” 
she says. “It’s balanced, just not worshipful.” If she was blowing the 
lid off of anything, Orth continues, it was the star- making machinery— 
from Columbia’s publicity offices to Mike Appel— that she saw as 
manipulating and twisting a young musician whose work she really did 
believe in. “I was finding out stuff that made me think that this kid 
was getting batted around. An innocent kid who was shy and maybe not so 
sophisticated at that point. Who was thinking of Bruce?” <br>
<br>
Still, the Newsweek story ended by comparing Bruce to Coca- Cola as 
another heavily advertised product his customers called the Real Thing— 
Coke’s central advertising slogan at the time. Cocks and Time focused on
 “Thunder Road” ’s notion that there really was magic in the night, and 
for a lot of fans, no matter their reasons, Bruce was it. If other 
people worried about what the stories said, Bruce was too busy fretting 
that their existence would mark the precise point where his music, 
reputation, and soul would be consumed by the spotlight. At first he 
kicked himself, furious that he’d let himself become just another 
celebrity. “He was worried fame was evil,” Stephen Appel says. “He saw 
it ruin peoples’ lives. People lost themselves in their own 
caricatures.” So while Mike Appel savored his promotional triumph, and 
the E Street Band guys reveled in what all the attention could mean for 
their group’s future, Bruce simmered in his hotel room in Los Angeles. 
“That was beyond anything anyone could have wished for,” Steve Van Zandt
 says. “And he was pissed! But I was laughing. I thought it was fun.” So
 did Garry Tallent, who first glimpsed the magazines while dashing 
through the Dallas airport to make a flight to the band’s next show. But
 the bassist had another thought too: “It was a classic case of be 
careful what you wish for .” Bruce passed the magazines’ publication day
 playing pinball with Columbia promotions man Ron Oberman in an American
 Legion bowling alley and then shooting pool at the home of former CBS 
executive Frank Shargo. Back in New York, some members of the publicity 
team at his record company were beginning to think their new star might 
not be wrong about the caustic risks of overexposure. “When we first had
 the record in our hands, I remember saying, “It’s time to step up! We 
gotta break down walls!’” says label publicist Ron McCarrell. “So we got
 a little carried away.” That realization came a few weeks after some of
 Bruce’s most fervent supporters sensed the possibility of a backlash. 
A&amp;R man Michael Pillot had tried to slow things down somewhere 
between the Bottom Line shows and the record’s release, only to learn 
that publicity campaigns work like rocket ships. Once they launch 
there’s no going back. “The answer was, ‘Nope,’” Pillot recalls. “They 
said, ‘You wanted it to move, right? Now it’s moving.’” <br>
<br>
So while Bruce stalked Los Angeles like Hamlet- in- reverse, fretting 
endlessly over the wisdom of actions he had already taken, another, less
 public part of himself confronted the fact that he had not surrendered 
to all the publicity as much as he’d actively fueled it. “I could not 
have been on those covers if I didn’t want to,” Bruce told the writer 
Bill Flanagan in 1992. “I didn’t have to do those interviews. I remember
 sitting in a room saying, ‘Gee, do I want to do this? It seems scary.’ 
But I [didn’t] want to be sitting on my porch when I’m sixty saying, ‘ 
Oh, I shoulda, I coulda, I woulda! ’ Hey! You got one ride. So I said, 
‘Let’s go!’” The first thing the Time and Newsweek covers achieved was 
to force Bruce out of the bungalow he’d been renting in Long Branch 
since the spring of 1974. A tiny, foundationless structure tucked 
between the large family homes on the block, the once easily overlooked 
house was now a magnet for the new crowd of fans whose determination to 
find their quarry overwhelmed whatever respect they might have for an 
ordinary person’s privacy. Flushed out of that house— so quickly, in 
fact, that he abandoned the spinet piano upon which he’d composed so 
much of Born to Run 3 Bruce rented a more remote house on a wooded hill 
in Atlantic Highlands. Quite a bit less glamourous than what you’d 
imagine a rock star’s house might be, but it did offer a nice view of 
Sandy Hook Bay, and an extra bedroom for newly hired road manager Rick 
Seguso to stay in when the band took a few nights or weeks off. The 
record itself sold remarkably well, even accounting for the hype, 
eventually reaching number 3 on the Billboard album chart, en route to 
selling more than seven hundred thousand copies by the end of a year (a 
significant achievement in 1975), and far more than that as the months 
and years passed. And though the “Born to Run” single stalled at #29 on 
the singles chart, the song served as a hugely effective calling card to
 record store owners and radio programmers, and became a guaranteed 
crowd killer in concert.<br>
<br>
 Beyond that, the success of Born to Run did little to alter the day- 
to- day existences of anyone in or working for Bruce and the E Street 
Band. Yes, the touring vehicles evolved from cramped Ford club vans, to a
 surplus Red Bank city bus retrofitted with rickety metal- framed bunks,
 to an actual touring bus. But the entourage still slept in cheap hotels
 (when they didn’t sleep on the moving bus), subsisted largely on truck 
stop food, and received no happy surprises in their weekly paychecks. 
“It’s nice to have a hit record,” Tallent says. “But we were thinking, 
‘It doesn’t feel like we have a hit record. It still feels like we’re 
destitute.’” It also didn’t feel like the entire nation had been swept 
up in Springsteen mania. For while CBS’s publicity department had grown 
quite generous with its financial support for tour advertising, radio 
outreach, and so on, Bruce remained a stranger in most of the American 
South, Midwest, and the West coast. In some corners of the nation, the 
promoters could pay little more than the $2,500 the band had commanded 
for shows in early 1974. But no matter where he played, or to how many 
people, his shows had grown even more explosive than before, due both to
 the excitement generated by the new album and Bruce’s overwhelming fear
 that he’d wind up being a one- hit wonder. Most nights he absorbed all 
of his fears and anxieties and transformed them into the rocket fuel he 
needed to catapult himself over the footlights and into the empty air 
above the crowd. Sometimes the pressure curdled his blood and left Bruce
 seething. Occasional defects in the sound system, particularly high- 
decibel blasts of feedback, inspired amp- kicking fits of outrage. Food 
could also become a serious point of contention, as in the New Orleans 
visit where road manager Rick Seguso shook up the menu at the postshow 
family- style dinners they all shared by replacing the usual order for 
fried chicken with chicken cordon bleu, one of the local caterer’s 
specialties. Most of the gang cheered having something new on the menu. 
But when a feedback- frazzled Bruce sat down for his meal, he gazed 
dubiously at the sauce- drizzled, ham- and- cheese stuffed chicken 
breast on his plate, took a tiny bite, and then dropped his plastic 
utensils on his paper plate. “What’s this shit?” he hissed. Seguso 
explained about the caterer, the culinary joys of New Orleans, and so 
on, but the musician glared back. “Well, I hate it!” At this, the road 
manager gestured around the table. “Nobody else is complaining.” Bruce 
reached down, picked up his chicken, and hurled it at Seguso. “Then you 
eat it!” he roared, storming out of the room, down the hall, and, 
presumably, to the nearest Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet. “I just said, 
‘Holy shit!’” Seguso remembers. “And everybody else was looking at me 
and going. ‘ Oooooohhhh !’” “I think Bruce was under a lot of pressure,”
 Tallent says. “But he sure does have a hell of a right hand for a 
chicken cordon bleu.”<br>
<br>
The pressure became even more pronounced in mid- November when Bruce and
 the band— all making their first journeys outside North America— jetted
 to England for a weeklong microtour to prime the pump for the full 
European tour set tentatively for the first half of 1976. The first 
stop, at London’s Hammersmith Odeon theater, would obviously be the most
 important show of the week. As Bruce’s official London premiere, it 
would be his chance to break through to the city’s cultural 
establishment: a prickly circle of critics and tastemakers who reserved 
their greatest scorn for Americans who buzzed into town thinking they 
had something to offer that the city of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones,
 and David Bowie somehow lacked. That Bruce and the E Street Band had 
such a distinctly American look and sound only added to the challenge. 
And when Bruce arrived at the venue, only to find the marquee aglow with
 a sign reading, “Finally, London Is Ready for Bruce Springsteen and the
 E Street Band,” the publicitysinged musician flipped. The thick 
papering of “I Have Seen Rock and Roll Future . . .” signs and stickers 
on London walls upped his frustration all the more, and when he got to 
the theater and found the lobby and seats festooned with miniature 
“Finally, London Is Ready for . . .” signs, he erupted. Bruce ran from 
sign to sign, ripping them down, reducing them to shreds, and scattering
 the evidence like so much confetti. The memory of the show traveled 
across the next three decades as a story about a disaster; the collision
 of a rattled artist with an aggressively unimpressed audience. It 
certainly didn’t help that Bruce spent much of the show with a thick 
wool cap pulled down tight over his forehead and sometimes over his 
eyes. But as a much- subsequently released video and live album made 
clear, the first Hammersmith show wasn’t anything close to a disaster. 
When the lights dimmed, Bruce stepped out to an excited ovation that 
became a rapt hush when he performed the voice, piano, and glockenspiel 
arrangement of “Thunder Road.” From there, “Tenth Avenue Freeze- Out” 
electrified the room with its playful funk, while the unadorned piano 
intro for the less- known Greetings album track “Lost in the Flood” 
earned an excited burst of applause. So maybe the crowd didn’t have the 
electric charge of the ones Bruce had been facing in the United States. 
And yes, the quiet moments just before “The E Street Shuffle” invited 
one angry Cockney to cry out “ Oi! Turn the guitar up! ” Obviously, some
 observers enjoyed it more than others. Vivien Goldman, writing for the 
British paper Sounds , clocked the show as somewhere between “very, very
 good” and “so- so,” concluding: “the burden of being ordered to take 
London by storm proved too much for his slender shoulders.” Somewhere 
else in the crowd, Monty Python’s Flying Circus member Michael Palin 
agreed with a friend that “We came expecting the Messiah but got Billy 
Graham instead.” Still, the shows in Stockholm and Amsterdam came off 
well, and the week- concluding return to the Hammersmith Odeon rocked 
harder and to greater acclaim than the opener a few days earlier. Still,
 Bruce and the band came home feeling beaten up. “We had four shows, got
 sandblasted, and scooted home,” Bruce says. But maybe he and everyone 
else had been too unsettled by their surroundings to see straight. 
“You’re dealing with men who had never been anywhere,” he says. “We 
couldn’t find any cheeseburgers! Europe in 1975 was very European. So we
 ran back and didn’t go back for six years. <br>
<br>
That wasn’t by mistake.” Back in the USA, Bruce and the band celebrated 
the end of the Born to Run tour, and everything else they had achieved 
in 1975, with five nights of shows at the 3,119- capacity Tower Theater 
just outside Philadelphia. All of the performances sold out quickly, 
with the heaviest demand tilting toward the final show on New Year’s 
Eve. With more than 90,000 requests flooding in for the 15,000 available
 tickets, an obvious question loomed: Why not admit that the band had 
grown too big for the city’s theaters and start booking Bruce in to 
Philadelphia’s Spectrum arena? The building could hold more than 18,000 
for a rock concert, and given the size of the demand, Bruce could fill 
the basketball arena four, probably five times. And with cash flow still
 a perpetual problem, when they went begging for crowds in at least half
 the country (the Born to Run tour had actually lost money), why resist 
the opportunity for a big score when it came up? Because Bruce wouldn’t 
even consider it. Especially not at the end of 1975. He’d compromised 
something with the packaging and selling of Born to Run. That had been a
 survival move— recall the desperation of the post Wild, the Innocent 
era. But here’s the thing: it hadn’t required him to alter a note of his
 music. He’d even held firm when Columbia tried to insist on having a 
pop radio–friendly short edit of the “Born to Run” single. And when it 
came to his actual connection to the world— the precious moments when he
 could look into the eyes of the people, expose his deepest feelings, 
and feel their energy flowing back into him— there could be no 
compromise. No echo- chamber sound, no fans stuck out on the upper decks
 miles away from the heart of the moment. That, Bruce assured anyone who
 asked, was not going to happen. Ever. A brave stand. And yet it also 
put Bruce at odds with himself. Having worked so hard to project his art
 and vision to as wide an audience as possible, refusing to play bigger 
halls meant that he was also putting himself beyond the reach of a 
significant percentage of his fans. And if he really wanted to put on 
the most powerful shows in rock ’n’ roll, that meant having the best 
band, sound, lights, and crew in the industry. All of whom deserved to 
be paid for their work, just as Bruce would be paid for his when the 
royalties from Born to Run rolled in. None of that could happen unless 
they opened the tent wide enough to welcome the crowds Bruce had invited
 in by making his breakthrough album. “It’s a problem,” Appel admitted 
to the writer John Rockwell that fall. So maybe they could find a way to
 play Madison Square Garden without surrendering completely to its 
concrete- and- steel ambiance. They could, perhaps, hang a curtain to 
both eliminate the echo and block off the most far- flung sections. That
 was an option, anyway; something they’d work out in 1976, once they 
figured out what to do with the live recordings Appel had commissioned 
on the fall tour, thinking that the best way to leverage Born to Run ’s 
success would be to release a multidisc live album showcasing Bruce’s 
exalted performances while also exposing his new fans to the wonders 
they’d missed on the first two albums. Bruce still hadn’t decided 
whether he was up for that, but he wanted to listen to the tapes before 
he made up his mind. Landau, while not an official member of the 
organization, wasn’t shy about telling Bruce that he thought it was a 
terrible idea. <br>
<br>
But the competing opinions on the live album mattered far less than who 
had them, and why, and what they would do to assert their authority over
 what happened next. In the end, it always comes down to the contracts. 
Appel’s three agreements with Bruce, all five- year commitments, were 
headed into their fifth year. The manager- producer had long ago 
promised to reduce his percentages once Bruce broke through to the 
mainstream, and obviously that time had arrived. But Landau had arrived 
first. And once Bruce told him that neither he nor a lawyer in his 
employ had ever taken a serious look at Appel’s contracts, Landau urged 
him to get it done as soon as possible. Bruce did, and emerged from the 
process rent by surprise, confusion, and anger. Appel, he now realized, 
had taken control of everything that mattered: his money, his songs, his
 recording career, everything. And despite the promises his manager had 
made about fixing their contracts when Bruce became successful, that 
hadn’t happened yet and wouldn’t, it seemed, until Bruce agreed to 
extend Appel’s contracts into the future. When a still- unhappy Bruce 
said that he was no longer entirely certain that he’d be renewing any of
 their contracts, Appel came forth with another surprise: he had, in his
 role as publisher, negotiated with Columbia/CBS to receive a $500,000 
advance on the coming Born to Run royalties. The company had approved 
the loan instantly, and now all the money was secured in one of Laurel 
Canyon Ltd.’s corporate accounts. Appel assured Bruce that he would get 
his contractually guaranteed fifty percent of the money even if he 
didn’t extend his contracts. But if he agreed to sign the new contracts,
 he’d get 75 percent of the money. If he didn’t, Appel, and Bruce, would
 be forced to live by the far more tightfisted terms of the contract 
they both signed back in 1972. Call it pop music business as usual. But 
that made it a sharp kick in the ribs for Bruce, because it had never 
been business as usual between Bruce and Appel. From the moment they had
 shaken hands in the winter of 1972, they had been crusaders, soldiers 
on a march to glory. Contracts say whatever contracts say, but as far as
 Bruce knew, or cared, handshakes and the promises they symbolized meant
 more. Or so he had believed.<br>
<br>
 But as the spotlight followed him onto the stage of the Tower Theater 
on the night of December 31, Bruce didn’t know what to believe in 
anymore. Except for the one thing that had always worked for him: 
plugging in his guitar, turning it up loud, and hurling himself into the
 music. Coming out in his usual jeans and leather jacket, with a long, 
multicolored scarf draped around his neck, Bruce gaped for a moment at 
his band, who had surprised him by dressing in matching white tuxedos, 
and then launched into a searing, full- tilt “Night.” After a quick nod 
to the band’s fancy dress— “These guys look so sharp”— he counted off a 
starry- eyed, slow- dance arrangement of “Tenth Avenue Freeze- Out” 
before diving back into the charmed swamps of “Spirit in the Night.” 
Next, Bruce indulged in a quick between- song nod to recent glories 
(“Seasons come, seasons go, ya get your picture on the cover of Time and
 Newsweek , but the bus never stops”) and then led into an even more 
juiced than usual “Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?,” ending with an 
exultant capper to the image of the girl throwing a rose to the lucky 
young matador: “and that’s me! ” Then came something unfamiliar: an 
extended piano intro, a series of dark chords accompanied by ghostly 
wails from the sax and guitar, emphasized on occasion with a slithering 
cymbal roll. Bruce stepped to the microphone and spoke, his voice flat 
and grim. I used to live in this, uh, two- family house on the main 
street in town. And at night my father, he’d lock up the front door so 
the kids had to come through the back door, y’know. And he’d be sittin’,
 he’d sit all the time in the kitchen. He’d turn out all the lights in 
the house, and he’d just sit there. He did that for as long as I can 
remember, y’know, until they moved away . . . From there he described 
the late- night talks with his father. Finding Doug sitting alone at the
 kitchen table, the room lit only by the glow of his cigarette and the 
alcohol- and- burnt- tobacco haze in his breath, his asking Bruce to sit
 down and talk, and then his awkward attempt to gird his stymied 
paternal love with something useful: a peek into the cruelty of his own 
adult life, the need for mature men to put away their fantasies and 
brace for the worst life had to offer. Then he’d start screamin’ at me, 
and I’d start . . . I’d start screaming back at him, and he’d be tellin’
 me all the time what a bad world it was. And I’d be tellin’ him that it
 was my life. Then he started to sing the opening lines of the Animals’ 
“It’s My Life,” slowed down to draw out the tension in the verses before
 bursting into explosive full- band choruses. “I’m gonna make it for 
certain,” he sang through gritted teeth. “I’m breakin’ loose!” The story
 of his father, his family, and his childhood, all the old terrors now 
tangled in his devolving relationship with Appel, in the consuming fear 
that everything he’d worked for, everything he’d achieved despite Doug’s
 insistence that it could never come true, all of it was now vanishing 
before his eyes. Except for that he wouldn’t let that happen, and so now
 he screamed it at the top of his lungs, with the entire theater riveted
 to his every word. It’s my life, and I’ll do what I want! He slashed at
 his guitar, his muscles coiled and tense, the veins in his neck taut 
and unyielding as he bellowed one last thing. Don’t . . . push me!"</div>

Bruce Springsteen as the voice of the average American? Maybe once.<br>
<br>
One of Mr. Springsteen's best qualities was his apolitical stance. But 
his work has more and more become politically correct liberal 
boilerplate. From ''Streets of Philadelphia'' to his odes to illegal 
immigrants on ''Ghost of Tom Joad'' to the overly simplified ''American 
Skin,'' Mr. Springsteen has expressed himself nobly but, in my view, 
narrowly, to one set of Americans who share his political ideology.<br>

ARTS EXTRA | BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN<br>
Springsteen Takes Folk Tradition for a Spin<br>
THE NEW YORK TIMES<br>
By JON PARELES</strong><br>
<br>
Every so often during his concert with his Seeger Sessions band at 
Madison Square Garden on Thursday night, Bruce Springsteen footnoted his
 songs like the authenticity-obsessed characters who made the folk 
revival so easy to ridicule.<br>
<br>
Before he sang "Jesse James," he credited the originator, Billy Gashade,
 and mentioned Woody Guthrie's rewrite; he said he'd be following the 
original. With a smile, he added, "It holds to the maxim, `When the 
legend becomes fact, write the legend.'" And then he led his band in a 
version like a tall tale.<br>
<br>
It started with banjo picking, picked up a hoedown beat, tossed in a 
Tex-Mex accordion and a Western-swing fiddle, and wound up with some 
razzing Dixieland-style horns. It was tough-minded and fun; it was also 
about as authentic as a covered wagon with chrome wheels.<br>
<br>
The Seeger Sessions band is Mr. Springsteen's uninhibited take on the 
folk revival, spearheaded by Pete Seeger and others, that peaked in the 
1950's and 1960's. They wanted to let America and the world hear the 
music made by ordinary people in out-of-the-way places.<br>
<br>
In hindsight, they were about half right. The folkies understood that 
the old songs are a trove of melody, history, poetry and anonymous 
genius; they also were, for a few decades, good tools for organizing the
 labor movement and the civil-rights movement. But the folkies' garbled 
notions of authenticity - rewriting lyrics as agitprop was fine, using 
an electric guitar was not - led the folk revival to self-parody and 
obsolescence when rock started taking itself just as seriously.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen's album "We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions" 
(Columbia), revisits songs Mr. Seeger recorded. He chose them, as Mr. 
Seeger had, for their visions of working Americans ("John Henry," "Pay 
Me My Money Down") and hard times ("My Oklahoma Home"), for a spirit of 
resistance ("We Shall Overcome" and "Eyes on the Prize," an old song 
rewritten for the civil-rights movement) and for antiwar conviction (the
 19th-century Irish song, "Mrs. McGrath," which says, "All foreign wars I
 do proclaim/Live on blood and a mother's pain.") The album doesn't 
include any of Mr. Seeger's own topical songs. But the concert did, when
 Mr. Springsteen performed "Bring 'Em Home," which Mr. Seeger wrote 
during the Vietnam war. (It's available free on <a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/site.html" class="postlink">www.brucespringsteen.net/site.html</a>.)<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen's band grew to 19 members during the concert, including a
 six-member horn section. Nearly all the instruments were acoustic. The 
band didn't simply strum and pick in the hootenanny style of 
folk-revival acts like the New Christy Minstrels (although a 1960's 
group, the Village Stompers, had some similar string-band-to-Dixieland 
arrangements). The Seeger Sessions band played a boisterous kaleidoscope
 of styles, never sticking to just one per song: Appalachian music, 
gospel, jump-blues, Irish reels, New Orleans R&amp;B, mariachi, Cajun 
music, even some acoustic funk for a version of Mr. Springsteen's own 
"Johnny 99." Credit the lasting impact of the folk revival for letting 
Mr. Springsteen find musicians in New York who are adept in so many 
regional styles.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen, as always, had serious intentions. He sang the version 
of Blind Alfred Reed's "How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live" 
that he rewrote with New Orleans in mind, as well as his hymnlike 
version of "When the Saints Go Marching In." He introduced "We Shall 
Overcome" as a song about issues that have still not been resolved, and 
played it in a slow-building version that moved deliberatly from 
solitude to camaraderie.<br>
<br>
But the concert never bogged down in self-righteousness. There was 
always another turn in the arrangements, another startlingly timely old 
lyric, another happy anachronism. "What can a poor boy do, 'cept play in
 a ragtime band?" Mr. Springsteen rasped as the band played "You Can 
Look (But You Better Not Touch)" with a zydeco rubboard ratcheting away.<br>
<br>
And if the spirit of the folk revival was in its singalongs, then Mr. 
Springsteen was definitely carrying it on. His fans have long filled 
arenas with verse-and-chorus singalongs on his songs, and they had 
already learned the material on the new album. Now they were raising 
their voices to sing old songs revived one more time.</div>

		<br>
by Roger Friedman -<br>
 May 26, 2015 12:03 am<br>
HOLLYWOOD TO THE HUDSON</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is on a little bit of a work vacation right now. But 
he won’t be for long. I can tell you that last summer Springsteen signed
 a new deal with Sony Music for $31 million that will take him until 
2027. The deal calls for a number of box sets and greatest hits 
packages, plus four new albums of material.<br>
For all this, Sony agreed to $31 million total, with $13 million paid up
 front as an advance. Remember, this money doesn’t include Springsteen’s
 massive touring income, royalties for radio play, his publishing deal, 
and so on. This is just so Sony continues to own his catalog. They’re 
also betting that Springsteen has more classic new work in him. (It’s 
safe bet.)<br>
Just about no one in the “senior” category of rock and roll has a deal 
like this. Also, no one else– with maybe the exception of Barbra 
Streisand– has been with the same record company for an entire career. 
Bob Dylan, also with Sony (like Bruce and Babs), wandered off the farm 
in 1976 briefly with a stint at Geffen Records. Tony Bennett and Johnny 
Mathis come close, but they have a few non-Sony/Columbia releases on 
their resumes.<br>
But Bruce’s situation is unique in that he writes his own music and is 
not a cover artist. Among rock stars of his generation or even the older
 one, no one can claim this– not even Paul McCartney or Mick Jagger. For
 a while McCartney was very prolific, but even he fell behind 
Springsteen (he’s also a decade younger).<br>
According to the Sony approval memo found in the Wikileaks papers (the 
Sony hack) Springsteen will also be delivering box sets of “The River,” 
“Nebraska,” “Born in the USA,” second box set of “Tracks,” as well as 
greatest hits. He retains the right to sell his downloads of his live 
concerts himself or through another party if he pays Columbia 12.5% of 
the gross receipts. And he owns his own master recordings.<br>
Is there a lot that hasn’t been released or officially made available? 
Oh yes. Just think of how many times Bruce has performed for charity 
events or as a guest on other artists’ recordings.<br>
The sweetest part? Sony is writing off around $25 million of the unearned balance of Springsteen’s last deal.<br>
Altogether, Sony expects to earn $35 million in worldwide profits from this deal.<br>
In case you were wondering, Bruce will be 78 years old when his entire deal with Sony is over. And still rocking like crazy.</div>

<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN<br>
<br>
Dave Marsh </strong><br>
<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN SITS cross-legged on his half-made bed, and surveys 
the scene. Records are strewn across the room, singles mostly, 
intermixed with empty Pepsi bottles, a motley of underwear, socks and 
jeans, half-read and half-written letters, an assortment of tapes, and a
 copy of Richard Williams' Out of His Head, the biography of Phil 
Spector.<br>
<br>
The space is small, but Bruce and the two friends listening to Harold 
Dorman's 'Mountain of Love' don't mind. They're listening for the final 
few bars of 'Mountain', in which the drummer collapses and loses the 
beat – the song slows down to a noticeably improper tempo, and the 
effect is nothing less than absurd. Unfortunately, Springsteen, 
unlubricated by anything more than the spirit of the thing, is having 
trouble getting the turntable to spin consistently. (One of those weird 
things with the green push button that lights up when you press it.) 
When he finally does, it turns out the record was warped. It is 
unplayable. Hysterically, Springsteen sweeps it under the mass of 
accumulated debris.<br>
<br>
"Here," he says, "I'll play ya something else." He puts on a tape of he 
and the E Street Band at the Main Point in Philadelphia. Suddenly, out 
of the speakers booms his own voice, cracking up at what he's singing. 
("That song has some of the best lines," he says shaking his head, "and 
some of the dumbest.") "Standin' on a mountain lookin' down at the city,
 the way I feel t'nite is a dawgawn pity." When the band comes in, the 
room is charged. The playing and the singing is rough, even ragged, but 
it is alive, sparked with the discovery of something vital in an old, 
trashy song. It has been a long time since I heard anyone get this 
interested in rock and roll, even classic old rock and roll. It has been
 a lot longer since anyone has gotten me so interested. Song done, 
Springsteen snaps the tape recorder off. "There," he says, with the 
characteristic delinquent twinkle in his eye. "If that don't get a club 
goin', nothin' will."<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is determined to get 'em going. The magic is that he 
doesn't have to be so determined to get himself going. Without being 
constantly "on." like a performer, Springsteen is constantly on, like 
someone who knows how good he is. He is full of himself, confident 
without being arrogant, almost serene in his awareness of what he is 
doing with his songs, his singing, his band. His music – and nothing 
gets in the way of that. Unlike, say, Roxy Music, which makes very 
exciting music out of a nearly desperate sense of boredom, Springsteen 
makes mesmerizing rock out of an inner conviction that almost everything
 is interesting, even fascinating.<br>
<br>
Take the three songs which, at this point, form the focus of the 
long-awaited third Springsteen album. Born to Run is almost a rock 
opera. But, rather than building his concept piece around a derivative 
European anti-funk motif, Springsteen has built his masterwork around a 
guitar line ripped straight from the heart of 'Telstar'. It may be too 
long (4:30) and too dense (layer upon layer of glockenspiel, voice, 
band, strings) to be a hit, but it does capture the imagination with its
 evocation of Springsteen's usual characters – kids on the streets and 
'tween the sheets – and its immortal catch-line: "Tramps like us, baby 
we was born to run."<br>
<br>
Not that he couldn't write something more classically oriented, if he 
needed to. 'Jungleland', the ten minute opus which may very well serve 
as the title of the third record, opens with 90 seconds of strings and 
percussion. But its influences are classical in the way in which '60s 
soul producers like Spector, Holland-Dozier-Holland and Gamble-Huff 
absorbed them, rather than in the way that pedants like those unctuous 
Britons Yes and ELP have done. Its imagery is magnificient, exceeded 
only by its music. Springsteen's music is often strange because it has 
an almost traditional sense of beauty, an inkling of the awe you can 
feel when, say, first falling in love or finally discovering that the 
magic in the music is also in you. Which may also be first falling in 
love.<br>
<br>
'She's the One', on the other hand, is pure sex, with a Bo Diddley beat 
that's nothing short of scary. Shorter, and less complicated than the 
other two, it could be the one. (The Hollies' 'Sandy' might've beat him 
to it. As Springsteen fans know only too well, the Hollies' version has 
almost nothing in common with Bruce's. But then, what did the Byrds' 
'Mr. Tambourine Man' share with Dylan's?)<br>
<br>
All of this makes Bruce Springsteen just about what he thinks he is, or 
at least, hopes to become: the Complete Rock and Roller. Few in rock and
 roll have attempted so much. None of the '50s rock and rollers were so 
ambitious – Elvis could have achieved everything, even intellectual and 
production brilliance, without drawing a heavy breath, if he had that 
ambition – and Bob Dylan never had the patience to, for instance, make 
interestingly constructed records. The Beatles had the production 
genius, with Martin and Spector and one suspects, without them, but they
 never really had to tackle it on stage. In any case, like the Stones, 
their magic was more collective than individual as subsequent events 
have shown. The Stones themselves couldn't be everything, because the 
scope of the group deliberately cannot contain some of Springsteen's 
farthest fetched (and I believe, most successful) ideas. For instance, 
it's hard to imagine Jagger coming out to sing a ballad as his first 
song, let alone a ballad sung only against violin accompaniment. Todd 
Rundgren had the idea, and the scope, but – one suspects – not quite the
 guts or talent or sheer keening madness to to go out and DO it, as a 
rock and roller. So he retired to the academy of his own electronic 
idiosyncrasy.<br>
<br>
And Rundgren's myth was always internal. Because he spent so much time 
in the cloister of the studio, word had to spread the hard way, by those
 who shelled out for his records. Certainly nothing to compare with 
Springsteen's full-blown stage show, which lately encompasses such 
tricks as the new introduction to the slowed down 'E Street Shuffle': 
Springsteen recounts walking down an Asbury avenue, late one dark night,
 and seeing a giant black man at the corner. "I took the money out of my
 pockets and threw it on the ground. I took my jacket and threw it on 
the ground," he says, standing in the glare of a single spotlight. "Then
 he put out his hand" – the enormous black palm of gargantuan, spooky 
saxophonist Clarence Clemmons suddenly juts into the glare and 
Springsteen whispers: "SPARKS fly on E Street." It is a truly 
unforgettable moment, taking on a racial fear at the same time that it 
devastates it into an almost trivial joke. (And works better because 
Springsteen's music so fully encompasses soul influences.)<br>
<br>
So it goes with a number of one-liners, moments ("Brace yourselves," he 
shouted at the beginning of the final chorus of 'Quarter to Three', his 
third encore one night. You had to be there to discover how necessary it
 was to do that), even songs. I've only seen him do 'Then I Kissed Her',
 a remake of the gorgeous old Crystals' song, once, for instance, and 
I've been thirsting for it ever since. In this sense, it may be to his 
advantage that he has no record. Not only does word-of-mouth have a 
chance to spread more completely, but every instant is more special 
because it is irretrieveable.<br>
That sense that he is special has begun to pervade even Springsteen's 
semi-private life. When he showed up at a party for label mates Blue 
Oyster Cult, Springsteen completely dominated the room. So much so that 
Rod Stewart and a couple of the Faces, no slouches at scene-stealing 
themselves, were all but ignored when they made a brief appearance. Yet 
he has yet to lose his innocence. Going to visit the Faces later that 
night, at the ostentatiously elegant Plaza Hotel, Springsteen feigned 
awe – although you wondered if it were entirely feigned – at the 
mirrored, plushly carpeted lobby.<br>
<br>
Fragments of a legend have begun to build. There are the stories about 
school – in high school, the time when he was sent to first grade by a 
nun, and, continuing to act the wise-ass, was put in the embarassing 
position of having the first grade nun suggest to a smaller child: 
"Johnny, show Bruce how we treat people who act like that down here." 
Johnny slapped Springsteen's face. Or in college, the story of how the 
student body petitioned the administration for his expulsion, "because I
 was just too weird for 'em, I guess." The news that his father was a 
bus driver, which gives added poignancy to 'Does This Bus Stop at 82nd 
Street'. (Which begins, "Hey, bus driver, keep the change.") Aphorisms 
are not beyond him: <strong class="text-strong">On Led Zeppelin: 
"They're like a lot of those groups. Not only aren't they doing anything
 new, they don't do the old stuff so good, either."</strong> On 
marriage: "I lived with someone once for two years. But I decided that 
to be married, you had to write married music. And I'm not ready for 
that." On the radio: "I don't see how anyone listens to [the local 
progressive rock station]. Everything's so damn long. At least if you 
listen to [the local oldies station] you know you're gonna hit three out
 of five. And the stuff you don't like doesn't last long."<br>
<br>
All of this goes only so far, of course. A record, a hit record, is a 
crucial necessity. Sales of the first two albums are over 100,000 but 
that's nothing in America. There are still large areas of the country 
where Springsteen hasn't played – even important large cities such as 
Detroit have been left out – and though the word travels fast, and 
frequently, articles like this ultimately seem like just the usual 
rhetoric without something to back them up. As one Californian put it, 
"I've heard enough. It's like having everyone tell me I'm really missing
 something by not seeing Egypt. When's he going to come out here?"<br>
<br>
Presuming he has the hit he deserves, Springsteen should be hitting most
 of America over the rest of the year. After an abortive arena journey 
with Chicago, he is, he says, reluctant to play large halls ever again. 
But he is one of the few rockers who would have any idea of what to do –
 except blast – in a room the size of a hockey rink. (Mick Jagger is 
about the only example who comes to mind, though Rod Stewart and Elvis 
do pretty well now that I think of it.)<br>
Suppose that he does hit the big time. Even, suppose that he really is, 
as the ads have it, "rock and roll future." What happens then?<br>
Since I believe that all of the above is true, and is going to happen, I
 have been at some pains to try to figure it out. Certainly, not a new 
explosion, a la Beatles and Elvis. Those phenomena were predicated upon 
an element of surprise, of catching an audience unaware, that is simply 
no longer operative. Not with rock on nationwide TV too many times a 
week. And not the kind of quiet, in-crowd build-up that propelled Dylan 
into the national eye. What Springsteen is after – nothing less than 
everything – has to be bigger than that, in mass terms, though it 
obviously cannot exceed Dylan in influence, his biggest achievement.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's impact may very well be most fully felt as a springboard, a
 device to get people to do more than just pay attention. He can, 
potentially, polarize people in the way that Elvis, the Beatles, the 
Stones, Dylan – all the really great ones – initially did. (Already, 
some early Springsteen fans feel alienated by his ever more forceful 
occupation with his soul influences.) The key to the success of those 
four is that as many hated them as loved them – but everyone had to take
 a position. God knows who he'll drag into the spotlight with him – it 
might have been the N.Y. Dolls, whose passion for soul oldies was equal 
to his, or Loudon Wainwright, whose cool, humorous vision parallels 
Bruce's in a more adult (sort of) way – but that ought to be something 
like what will happen. Sort of the way Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis and
 the other rockabilly crazies followed Elvis.<br>
<br>
He's smart though. He said it all, one night, introducing 'Wear My Ring 
Around Your Neck', the Presley oldie. "There have been contenders. There
 have been pretenders. But there is still only one King."<br>
But no king reigns forever.<br>
