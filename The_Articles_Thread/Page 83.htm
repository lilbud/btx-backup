By JOHN ROCKWELL<br>
October 30, 1976, Page 17<br>
The New York Times <br>
</strong><br>
The two‐hour show that Bruce Springsteen offered Thursday night at the 
Palladium—the first of six there—could not be called one of his best. it
 was still good enough to reassert his credentials as about the most 
exciting, satisfying performer in present‐day rock‐and roll.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen has performed in the New York area since late last 
summer, when his Bottom Line engagement inaugurated the by now 
too‐well‐known publicity blitz that helped propel him to stardom. But 
these were his first dates in New York proper since then, and they 
indicated Mr. Springsteen is both growing and remaining true to his 
roots.<br>
<br>
What Mr. Springsteen's roots are, beyond his fervent identification with
 Asbury Park and Jersey Shore mythology, is open to argument, and the 
reason is the very richness of them. He is at the same time a rocker and
 a wistful singersongwriter, a 60's rhythm‐andblues nostalgist, and a 
Broadway balladeer.<br>
<br>
On Thursday, in addition, he was toying with some of the instrumental 
passages with an almost Pink Floydish sci‐fi‐rock sound, full of 
echoing, spacy guitar and keyboard textures. And without undercutting 
the punchy energy of his rock, the ornate lavishness of his arrangements
 was more striking than either — in addition to the ever‐present 
glockenspiel doubling the complex keyboard lines, there were four extra 
hornplayers on hand. One Springsteenian in the audience suggested that 
the next step would have to be a full orchestra, and maybe he had a 
point<br>
<br>
But the image of an orchestra would be suspect. The best moments 
Thursday came when the newly beardless Mr. Springsteen was mustering the
 full flamboyance of his strutting‐punk act. Cocky and tireless, he 
projects about the greatest ebullience of any performer around these 
days, and makes an almost ideal visual complement of his own street 
poetry.<br>
<br>
The problems at the opening show began with a technical snag, which 
involved a link between a diesel generator out on the street and Mr. 
Springsteen's sound systern and which delayed the show an hour. Once the
 proceedings got under way, Mr. Springsteen seemed tenser than usual, 
and it was not until “Thunder Road,” more than half an hour into the 
show, that he bit his stride.<br>
<br>
Thereafter there were ups and downs. Although the ups were very fine, 
the show never really swept along to the climaxes that mark the very 
best Springsteen shows. Part of that could be attributed to little 
things. The complex, theatrical lighting Mr. Springsteen uses looked a 
little too tricky at times, and the sound mix seemed both murky and 
balanced against the crucial saxophone lines of Clarence Clemons.<br>
<br>
Still, there teas an enormous amount to enjoy. The E Street band is 
still as superb as it always has been. Mr. Springsteen's assortment of 
oldies — which included The Animals’ “It's My Life,” Darlene Love's 
“Fine, Fine, Fine” and Eddie Floyd's “Raise Your Hand” — was as 
infectious as ever, and his three new songs “Rendezvous,” “Something in 
the Night” and “The Promise” — all suggested that Mr. Springsteen is in 
no danger of drying up as a songwriter, The songs he's already written 
are a guaranteed source of pleasure.<br>
<br>
Perhaps we can chalk up some of the failings on Thursday to nerves. Or 
perhaps it is to Mr. Springsteen's credit that his performances are 
variable. There is an element of calculation and a surfeit of talent to 
guarantee a certain level of quality all the time. But he still leaves 
himself room for inspiration, and one trusts that subsequent shows in 
this current run will reach heights not attained on Thursday.</div>

JOHN ROCKWELL<br>
<br>
December 26, 1976, Page 26<br>
The New York Times <br>
<br>
1976 - POP MUSIC VIEW</strong><br>
<br>
It has become fashionable in year‐end pop‐music roundups of late to 
lament the state of the art. Pop music isn't what it used to be, we 
read. It's been another limp year. This observer has never been very 
sympathetic to such nostalgist defeatism. Of course pop_ music, along 
with most manifestations of the youth cultism of the 1960's, has lost 
some of its more apocalyptic, societally redeeming connotations. Pop 
music is unabashedly entertainment, now, and perhaps partly as a result 
the best pop music doesn't speak so compellingly for its times as it 
used to. But there is still an enormous amount of skill, emotion and 
charm being invested in the form, and people still legitimately derive 
great pleasure from It.<br>
<br>
That said, 1976 was not a great year, even for 1970's pop. There was 
nothing of the impact of the 1975 Rolling Stones tour or the first 
months of Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue. Most of the trends that 
continued to prosper had come along earlier‐punk rock, disco, salsa, 
reggae.<br>
<br>
Still, in assembling a list of 10 key people, trends, concerts and 
events, one realizes that, as ever, there was a lot to remember with 
affection and interest:<br>
<br>
1. Without any doubt the pop‐music event of the year was Stevie Wonder's
 album, “Songs in the Key of Life.” in a gratifying instance of the 
congruence of popular taste and critical opinion, it went straight to 
the top of the album sales charts and has stayed there ever since. 
Wonder is the most fecund creator in popular music these days, and a 
masterly singer and instrumentalist as well. The set has its 
self‐indulgences, but they pale before its achievements and the sheer 
joy it transmits.<br>
•<br>
2. Wonder's album followed a 26month‐hiatus for him, and hence 
constituted something of a comeback. 1976 was in fact a year for 
comebacks. The most dramatic was Laura Nyro's, but Melanie made a 
welcome new album. John Cale put a band together and Jonathan Richman 
and the Modem Lovers emerged from years of cultism and confusion with a 
long‐delayed release of some old studio tapes and nearly‐as‐charming new
 album. But the best comeback of all was Joni Mitchell's. Not that she 
had really gone anywhere in terms of fame. But her new “Hejira” album 
reaffirmed her slightly shaky status as the leading singersongwriter of 
the day, irrespective of sex.<br>
<br>
3. Another comback of sorts was Paul McCartney's. McCartney had his No. 1
 records before his 1976 summer tour, but these were his first 
performances in this country since the last live Beatles concerts in 
1966, and they were remarkably appealing. One says “remarkably” because 
the music‐now available in a three‐disk tour albumwas tougher and more 
convincing than the popsier studio albums. McCartney never did efface 
memories of the Beatles, and his tour provoked the most intense, wishful
 rumors yet about an eventual Beatles reunion. But on his own terms, he 
staked out a convincing claim as the most talented of all the 
pop‐rockers.<br>
•<br>
4. The most interesting of all the trends one could discern was the 
growing, world‐wide interest in “punk rock.” What that really meant was 
not so much a return to 1950's hoodlumism as a clearing away of 
“progressive” fussiness and middle‐of‐the‐road bathos and going back to 
the rhythm‐andblues basics at the roots of rock. The most appealing of 
all the figures to emerge so far in this category was Graham Parker from
 London. New York's punk‐rockers tend to be mixed up with a 
self‐conscious conceptual artiness (Patti Smith, Talking Heads, the 
Ramones) which has its genuine charms but which sometimes takes the 
music and the image rather far from punk primitivism. Closer really to 
the true punk‐rock spirit are such midwestern perennials as Bob Seger, 
who himself made an appealing bid for a nationwide appreciation with a 
fine live album and an even finer studio album.<br>
<br>
<br>
5. A negative development, but one sadly symptomatic of the music 
business, was the non‐happening of Bruce Springsteen in 1976. It would 
be easy to be cynical and say that the massive publicity Springsteen 
received in 1975 made it impossible for him to live up to his legend. 
Maybe it might have, but he never got the chance to try. His live 
concerts, the few there have been, were as fine as ever, and even gave 
tantalizing signs of artistic growth. But Springsteen is tied up in a 
messy legal battle with his manager, and it has curtailed his touring 
and postponed his crucial new album.<br>
<br>
6. A fascinating phenomenon in 1976 was the continued ability of the 
public to make stars independently of both the radio stations and the 
press. Albums would enter the charts, rise to whatever position the 
artists’ previous success might have seemed to entitle them, sit there 
for awhile, and then erratically rise to the top and stay there, 
sometimes fading back to the No. 2 or 3 spot and then returning to No. 
1. On a scale just short of No. this happened with such unknown bands as
 Boston and Heart, More strikingly it happened to both Fleetwood Mac and
 Peter Frampton, both of whom moved from stardom to huge superstardom, 
surprising everyone including themselves in the Of the two, the more 
obviously worthy was Fleetwood Mac, largely because of the bewitching 
singing of a new member, Stevie Nicks.<br>
<br>
7. The various “new” trends that were meant to supplant or enrich 
standard white pop and rock in 1976 suffered disparate fates. Reggae, 
after years of trying, finally made a marked commercial impact on 
mainstream music, mostly through Bob Marley, who closed out the year 
dramatically by avoiding what was apparently an assassination attempt in
 Jamaica and proceeding the next day to go through with a previously 
scheduled mass outdoor concert there. Disco continued to grow on a 
commercial level, and began to show signs of stretching beyond the 
simplistic formulas that have both defined and limited it so far. Chief 
among the innovators was Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band, although 
they haven't been able to translate their success ‘into a live show so 
far. Salsa, on the other hand, shows every sign of remaining a music of 
the barrio, although here‐as in the past‐Latin music has been able with 
more accessible forms of jazz, rock and pop.<br>
<br>
8. On the concert front there were two particularly rewarding evenings. 
In January, shortly after Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes broke up, the
 two factions appeared in head‐to‐head confrontation in New York. At the
 Felt Forum were Melvin and some remaining Blue Notes. Over at Radio 
City Music Hall Theodore Pendergrass, the group's former lead singer, 
appeared with the other Blue Notes. Pendergrass won the war hands down, 
and one hopes he manages to get a solo career underway soon.<br>
•<br>
9. The most striking and, in a sense, unexpected success was David 
Bowie's Nassau Coliseum concert (those who saw the same show a few days 
later at Madison Square Garden said it wasn't so effective there). Bowie
 always has been so artful and self‐absorbed that his performances have 
seemed stilted. But on Long Island it all came together for him and the 
cold, white intensity of the night will long be remembered.<br>
<br>
10. Events that aren't themselves specifically musical still reflect 
back on to the music. In New York the Schaefer Festival managed•to 
struggle on for another season of summer concerts in Central Park, 
although once again the prospects for the’ future look clouded. The 
principal venue in Manhattan for concerts in the 3,000‐seat class 
flip‐flopped back downtown again to 14th Street, with the Academy of 
Music now renamed the Palladium. This made little difference to what 
music we hear, although Ron Delseneri the Schaefer and Palladium 
promoter,” has managed to clean up the 14th Street theater in a healthy 
manner. But the biggest non‐musical event of theyear was tl e news that 
Rollin Stine magazine plans to switch its headquarters to New York early
 in 1977. Nattt‐’ rally, it's hard to measure the impact of such 
matters, and of course for allof Jann Wenner's capabilities, Rolling 
Stone is hardly the only outlet for rock writing around. Still, it makes
 a nice; symbol of New York's continued vitalw ity and centricity in the
 pop‐music.</div>

By JOHN ROCKWELL<br>
June 11, 1978, Page 25<br>
The New York Times </strong><br>
<br>
At least in retrospect, it seems as if some artists's record releases 10
 years ago carried with them an enormous cultural weight. A disk by the 
Beatles or the Rolling Stones or Bob Dylan was awaited with all the 
expectation of a tablet from on high. People defined themselves in 
relation to the music they heard, and invested that music with a 
personal, political and visionary importance that seems hard to believe 
in our more “mellow,” realistic 1970's.<br>
<br>
Even now, however, there are some artists whose records arouse an 
expectancy almost comparable to those of the past, and that's certainly 
the case with the new records by the Rolling Stones and Bruce 
Springsteen. The Stones have had their ups and downs in this decade, and
 their future is clouded because of Keith Richards's (he's using the “s”
 on the end of his name these days) forthcoming trial in Toronto for 
possession of heroin and cocaine. Still, the band has given signs of 
life of late in large part because of Ron Wood's joining the group as 
second guitarist three years ago. Yet the new “Some Girls” album is the 
first studio disk on which Mr. Wood has played an active role from the 
outset, and the band's first studio album since “Black and Blue” of two 
years ago.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen's “Darkness on the Edge of Town” has been even more 
anxiously awaited by his admirers, since it's his first record of any 
kind in nearly three years. Ever since “Born to Run” of 1975, he's been 
tied up in legal troubles, seeking to clarify his management and 
publishing relationships, and thus this new record becomes his first 
real statement since the huge wave of press attention tossed him up into
 the public consciousness.<br>
<br>
It should be stated right away that eager anticipation is not always the
 most perceptive frame of mind in which to hear a new album. If one 
nervously trying to jump to a quick concluskin about something, one 
likely to worry at it instead of simply enjoying it. “It's only 
rock-and-roll,” sang the Stones a few years ago, and even if one likes 
to argue that rock can be art, that debunking attitude is worth keeping 
in mind.<br>
There's another factor that might tend to blunt our appreciation of 
these two new records in particular. The 1960's were by and large an 
optimistic decade. Even if the Stones liked to play the devil role as 
opposed to the Beatles's angels, their deep-down-dirty affirmations of 
sexuality and rebellion had a carefree abandon that lifted the spirit. 
But both “Some Girls” and Mr. Springsteen's new disk are in some crucial
 senses pessimistic, even embittered statements, reflecting cruel 
disappointments on the part of the protagonists.<br>
<br>
That all said, these are both still wonderful records, worth waiting 
for. “Some Girls” may well be attacked as sexist. “Black and Blue” 
aroused feminists's wrath because of a bondage advertisement that 
equated the title with the abuse of an attractive, willing woman, and 
the second song on “Some Girls” is called “When the Whip Comes Down.”<br>
Yet insofar as one can make out the words—as usual with the Stones there
 are no texts—“Some Girls” isn't so much sexist as sexual, when it deals
 with sex at all. The main themes of the record seem to be Bianca Jagger
 and New York. Mick Jagger approache: the break‐up of his marriage iron 
several angles, from the opening disci song. “Miss You” (Bianca haunt! 
Studio 54), to denunciations of her fot her soda I pretensions and greed
 to the final “Shattered,” which is both about his own emotional 
desolation and the decay and decline of New York. References to this 
city appear throughout the album, and the record's energy and tension 
owe much to New York's vital ity. (There's also a song sung in his chat 
acteristic reedy whine by Mr. Richards that may he a comment or<br>
<br>
This is, in fact—for all the complaints in the lyrics—the best Stones 
record in years. Mr. Richards and Mr Wood (sometimes complemented 1) Mr.
 Jagger) make for a tight guitar sound, as expected. But this is really 
Charlie Watts's record as much as anybody's, partly because that 
estimable drummer isn't cluttered by too much added percussion this time
 around. Indeed, except for the odd solo here and there this is the 
first five‐man Stones record in a long time, and it benefits mightily 
from that restriction. Mr. Watts's skills have long been celebrated, and
 they are in full flower here. He's as solid and exact a rock drummer as
 there is, but his love for and skill with jazz lends his work a 
subtlety to which most rock drummers can't even uspire (Keith Moon and 
Mick Fleetwood are two that come to mind as postable rivals, but there 
are very few). the result is that even in slowish songs ?? “Beast of 
Burden” here).<br>
<br>
The music on “Some Girls” ranges from the disco single (which is 
available in a twice-as-long disco‐mixed version) to hard rockers to a 
fine interpretation of a Temptations song to a curious, almost 
patronizing country novelty tune with a suddenly moving chorus to slow 
songs (although there are no really emotive ballads on this hard‐rocking
 record) to the final “Shattered.”<br>
<br>
Well‐established rock artists have evolved definable styles, for all the
 range they may have found within those styles. A first hearing of the 
Stones's “Some Girls” may sound a little too familiar—the same basic 
rock structures, the same guitar chords, the same black affectations 
from Mr. Jag- ger. It's only later you realize the quality of the songs 
and the playing and the fact that Mr. Jagger is actually singing better 
and more carefully than he has often in the past. On the one hand, 
familiarity can breed contentment; on the other, once you get past the 
initial shock of recognition, there's plenty here that is new and fresh.<br>
<br>
The same is true for Mr. Springsteen, who purveys a genre of rock that 
this listener has always found a little suspicious—inflated, rhetorical,
 overblown in the arrangements. The success of Meat Loaf, on whose debut
 album a couple of Mr. Springsteen's band members played, was enough to 
make one doubly suspicious, especially in today's climate. Three years 
ago, Mr. Springsteen seemed a revitalization of rock; now he's been 
outflanked by the puband punk‐rockers. And in fact a first, casual 
hearing of the new “Darkness on the Edge of Town” may seem like a rerun 
of Mr. Springsteen's past work. There are the same melodramatic images 
of New Jersey low‐life, the same clinging but elusive girls, the same 
cars, the same scuffling along night‐time streets, the same hoarse 
yowling (even actual wordless howls), the same saxophone solos, the same
 gritty guitar solos, the same piano arpeggiations, the same slightly 
repetitive, tuneless melodies, the same fixed, neo‐spectorian murkiness 
of production.<br>
<br>
But once again, after one listens for awhile, Mr. Springsteen turns out 
to have made a fine record. As he himself put it a couple of weeks ago, 
the scenes may look the same, with the same characters and the same 
frames of reference, but actually they've evolved over the past three 
years. “Darkness on the Edge of Town” is full of the passage of time, 
and even devolves into an unadorned heartbeat at one point.<br>
His legal difficulties and the cynical blandishments of sudden fame have
 clearly embittered him. The songs here are full of explicit allusions 
to his re- cent troubles—“1”m caugnt in a crossfire, that I don't 
understand ... I want control right now,”* for instance, from a song 
called “Badlands” that opens both the album and his current concerts. 
The characters are lost and desperate, trying to retain the idealism and
 excitement of their youth but surrounded by the ghosts of former 
friends who have disappeared, sold out or settled down. The peak of his 
despair is reached on the most striking song on the record (and one of 
the most compelling of his entire career), entitled “Adam Raised a 
Cain,” in which the refrain sounds very close to “race of cain” and 
images of cursed abandonment, fratricide, betrayal, guilt and James Dean
 (“East of Eden”) are projected in searing, incendiary music, punctuated
 by tribal screams from the band.<br>
<br>
Yet “Darkness” isn't all black. Mr. Springsteen is too irrepressible a 
force for that, and the sheer passion of his singing and his and the 
band's playing redeems not only the record but even, maybe, the whole 
idea of bombasto.rock (at least for him, if not for Meat Loaf).<br>
<br>
Both the Rolling Stones and Mr. Springsteen have made disks that are 
ultimately life‐giving, for all the bitterness they entail. Partly 
that's because of their own vitality and strength. But in a larger sense
 it's because rock music, when it's executed with the fervor of these 
two records, is itself lifegiving. Which in turn suggests that the 
breathless expectations of the 1960's may not have been so foolishly, 
naively optimistic, after all.■<br>

JOHN ROCKWELL<br>
<br>
May 26, 1978, Page 10<br>
The New York Times </strong><br>
<br>
BUFFALO BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN'S triumphant return to live performing Tuesday
 night at Shea's Buffalo Theater broke a long silence. Unless one had 
followed the rock press closely, one might well have had no idea what 
had happened to him, so little was he in the news.<br>
Mr. Springsteen's withdrawal from the public eye came after a period, 
three years ago, when he seemed hard to avoid. After years on the New 
Jersey bar‐band circuit he began building a national rock audience with 
constant tours and records starting in 1973.<br>
<br>
In 1975, when he was 26 years old, his fame erupted with his best album 
to date, “Born to Run.” There was the typical publicity campaign of the 
sort that accompanies any artist in whom a record company believes 
strongly. That campaign combined with the fervent enthusiasm of Mr. 
Springsteen's fans and a good many rock writers to produce a huge amount
 of press coverage. It seemed all the more huge to those who had not 
before heard of him, and it culminated when he appeared on the covers of
 both Time and Newsweek the week.<br>
<br>
Since then there's been precious little. Mr. Spingsteen toured some, but
 his appearances were erratic and stopped more than a year ago. He's 
held himself aloof from the press for the last two years. And his new 
album, due next week and entitled “Darkness on the Edge of Town,” will 
be his first in nearly three years.<br>
<br>
Those cynics who decried the “hype” surrounding Mr. Springsteen have 
suggested that his disappearance simply constituted a sudden return to 
deserved obscurity. In fact, Mr. Springsteen was embroiled in lawsuits 
that sought to clarify who his manager would be, who would produce his 
records and who would own his publishing rights. He didn't talk to the 
press partly because his lawyers advised him not to and partly because 
he felt the need to withdraw after his sudden and extreme involvement 
with the whole, hyperactive world of rockmusic superstardom in 1975.<br>
<br>
That reclusiveness came to an end at Mr. Springsteen's show Tuesday 
night in Buffalo—the first night of four‐month tour (he'll be at the 
Nassau Coliseum June 3—sold out—and in Manhattan later in the summer). 
Not only did he rouse the audience to a fervor not often encountered at 
concerts, but he even agreed to answer a few questions backstage.<br>
<br>
As far as his involuntary “retirement” is concerned, Mr. Springsteen 
suggested that he might well have pulled back a bit even if he hadn't 
been forced to by his legal troubles.<br>
“After ‘Born to Run’ I didn't want to do another album right away,” he 
said. “If you start worrying about putting out a follow‐up album, you 
get caught up in the machine of the industry. I had a blast of that, and
 I learned something. I learned what I wanted to do with myself and what
 I didn't want to do with myself.”<br>
<br>
One thing he did was go back home to New Jersey and spend time with the 
friends and the Asbury Park scenes of his youth. The imagery of 
lowermiddle‐class New Jersey has always been crucial to Mr. 
Springsteen's songs, and being home clearly served as a cooling‐out 
period. “For me, that's where the reality is,” he said “I've always 
tried to keep a line on that.”<br>
<br>
To judge from Tuesday's concert, Mr. Springsteen's new songs, nearly all
 which he's offering in concert, deal with the same basic themes and use
 the same musical signatures of his past work—songs of suburban loners, 
cars and young love, clothed in ornately rhetorical yet passionate 
rock‐and‐roll. Mr. Springsteen realizes that he may be accused of 
replowing the same ground, but he argues that his work constitutes a 
particular genre, and that novelty can be discerned by studying the 
variations on the recurrent themes.<br>
<br>
“Most of the new songs were written while we were recording the album,” 
he said. “I was formulating a concept in the studio. There's a slightly 
different outlook in these songs, which I pick up on a lot. It's like 
those Italian westerns, or detective movies or John Ford westerns. With 
all those movies, you have to dig all the subtle differences to 
understand what's going on. They have the same scenes, or they appear to
 have the same scenes, but actually the characters have a whole 
different look. With this record, I started with basically the same 
imagery as before. the same frames of reference, but what's happened to 
the characters is little different.”<br>
<br>
Aside from questions of artistic growth, Mr. Springsteen wonders whether
 his heartfelt affirmations of emotion are quite in tune with the spirit
 of the day. “Times are generally cynical right now,” he says. “I'm not 
that particular kind of person. So in that way, at least. my stuff seems
 to go against the grain.”<br>
<br>
Looking back on 1975 and his subsequent period of inactivity, Mr. Springsteen still has mixed feelings.<br>
<br>
“To this day, I still regard all that attention as both a good thing and
 a bad thing,” he said. “the initial reason to play is to avoid work and
 because it's fun and for girls and all the rest. There are a certain 
number of things you have to hold on to. I can tell when I'm playing and
 I'm not having fun, I'm doing it wrong. There was a period of time, 
right after ‘Born to Run,’ when it wasn't fun, I'm real strong; I don't 
get bothered. But a few nights, especially the first time we were in 
England, I was shaky. Finally, whether things were good or bad, I felt 
bad. Now, as bad as it is, it will never be as bad as it was.”<br>
<br>
As he talked, Mr. Springsteen's bitterness about the music business came
 out as did a more general disaffection for the society in which that 
business flourishes.<br>
<br>
“The whole system is based on the corruption of your ideals, on the 
watering down of things that are real. By the time a guy gets to be 
President, he's full of so much bull.<br>
“At a certain point I realized I wanted to be true to myself, and I had 
to be tougher than I had been. They always know how to get you—they get 
you while you're dancing. It's like Bonk! And then you're out in the 
alley.”</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">SPRINGSTEEN -Biggest Impact at Antinuclear Benefit<br>
By JOHN ROCKWELL<br>
September 24, 1979, Page 13<br>
The New York Times </strong><br>
<br>
TO judge from the expectation and applause at Friday night's concert, 
Bruce Springsteen made by far the biggest impact of any of the 
performers at the five nights of antinuclear‐prosolar benefit concerts 
at Madison Square Garden, which ended last night.<br>
<br>
Concerts with a cause are always difficult to discuss, because the 
organizers want to place the emphasis on the cause, and yet what is 
being presented is a musical event. Fortunately, the MUSE Organization —
 MUSE stands for Musicians United for Safe Energy — had the good sense 
to keep political rhetoric to a minimum.at the concert.<br>
<br>
The concerts as a whole have shown a marked Los Angeles, soft‐rock bias.
 That's not surprising, because the bulk of the MUSE musicians come from
 that place or stylistic persuasion. But it still was unfortunate that 
they didn't include a major black pop act, or a newwave rock act, or 
middle‐of‐the‐road performer or disco group.<br>
<br>
These were Mr. Springsteen's first concerts in some months — he's been 
recording his fifth album — and the first live Springsteen performances 
that will officially be released on records and film. He remarked at one
 point he was in “bad condition,” even though he said it with apparent 
good humor. That manifested itself quite simply in that he seemed to 
tire more quickly from all his exertions, such that his singing was even
 more limited in range and shorter of breath than it usually is.<br>
<br>
And, the E Street Band, although as lively and accomplished as ever in 
broad terms, lacked that final edge of sharpness that steady touring can
 bring.<br>
<br>
That said, Mr. Springsteen remains the most exciting performer in 
rockand‐roll. His set lasted 85 minutes —short for him, long for a MUSE 
set —and consisted mostly of a Springsteen “greatest hits” selection. 
There were two first‐rate new songs, however, and, before the Mitch 
Ryder medley during the encores, a nice version of STAY by Jay and 
Rosemary Butler, a respected Los Angeles backup singer.<br>
<br>
The crowd was a Springsteen crowd, pure and simple; one got the 
impression that the other performers and perhaps even the antinuclear 
issue itself were barely being tolerated. The crowd's predilection for 
cooing “Bruce” seemed to disconcert some of the other performers, 
because it sounds suspiciously like “boo,” and indeed a few times there 
were boos for real.<br>
<br>
Sweet Honey in the Rocks, an a cappela group of four black women, was 
none too politely received. Ry Cooder did better; even with an 
undistinguished voice he has a palpable charm on stage, and his band — 
which included the redoubtable David Lindley, who cropped up here and 
there all night — was really fine.<br>
•<br>
Chaka Khan was backed backed by an “all star” band that included one 
Harlette and two members of the Average White Band. Her soul‐shouting 
funk style was not very impressive, though, and she appeared especially 
distressed by the audience's impatience.<br>
<br>
Jesse Colin Young is a smooth performer who has never made much of an 
impact on this writer; although he comes from Queens, he seems now 
particularly symptomatic of the blandness of Los Angeles folk‐rock. Mr. 
Browne, who followed, was much better. He, too, can sound a little too 
similar from song to song, and like Mr. Cooder, he doesn't really have a
 commanding voice. But he makes his limitations of stage flash and voice
 work for him, and presents a quiet sincerity and sad, church‐ish 
gravity that can be very moving. The highlight of his set was a 
traditional song called “The Crow on the Cradle,” sung as a duet on the 
choruses with Graham Nash and accompanied by Mr. Browne's own acoustic 
guitar and Mr. Lindley's consoling fiddle.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">THE ESQUIRE INTERVIEW WITH BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN<br>
 MICHAEL HAINEY<br>
NOV 27, 2018</strong><br>
<br>
The first time I meet Bruce Springsteen is backstage at the Walter Kerr 
Theatre in New York, where he is in the homestretch of performing his 
one-man show,&nbsp;Springsteen on Broadway.&nbsp;It is a few weeks 
before I am supposed to sit with him for an interview, but his publicist
 has asked me to come by before this performance so he can, I deduce, 
check me out. I arrive at 7:00 and am directed to a small couch near the
 backstage bathroom. Finally, five minutes before curtain, I see, coming
 down the stairs that lead to his dressing room, a pair of black work 
boots and black-legged jeans. Springsteen ducks his head beneath a low 
arch and walks toward me, extending his hand and saying, “I’m Bruce.” We
 shake hands, and then there is silence. He looks at me and I look at 
him, not sure what to say. At five-foot-ten, he’s taller than you think 
he’ll be; somehow, he remains the runty-scrawny kid in the leather 
jacket, possibly dwarfed in our minds due to the years he spent leaning 
against Clarence Clemons.<br>
<br>
<br>
That evening, Springsteen is weeks from notching his sixty-ninth 
birthday. And as we stand there, I find it impossible not to think that 
the journey he has undertaken in this decade of his life has been 
nothing short of miraculous. He entered his sixties struggling to 
survive a crippling depression, and now here he is approaching his 
seventies in triumph—mostly thanks to the success of this powerful, 
intimate show, which is not a concert but an epic dramatic monologue, 
punctuated with his songs. After a year of sold-out shows, he will close
 it out on December 15, the same night it will debut on Netflix as a 
film. He at last breaks the awkward silence by giving a small nod and 
saying to me—but more to himself, just as we all kind of say it to 
ourselves as we head out the door each day—“Well, I guess I better go to
 work.” And with that he ambles toward stage right<br>
<br>
“DNA.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This is, curiously, the first word that Springsteen says when he takes 
the stage. An unlikely, unromantic, unpoetic choice for a man who has 
always been more about the sensory than science. Yet in many ways, DNA 
is Springsteen’s unrelenting antagonist, the costar that he battles 
against. This is the central tension of&nbsp;Springsteen on 
Broadway:&nbsp;the self we feel doomed to be through blood and family 
versus the self we can—if we have the courage and desire—willinto 
existence. Springsteen, as he reveals here, has spent his entire life 
wrestling with that question that haunts so many of us: Will I be 
confined by my DNA, or will&nbsp;I&nbsp;define who I am?<br>
<br>
A few minutes later, in the show, he talks about the moment that opened 
his eyes to what was possible if one believed in the power of 
self-creation. It’s a Sunday night in 1956, and an almost seven-year-old
 Springsteen is sitting in front of the TV with his mother, Adele, in 
the living room of the tiny four-room house in&nbsp;Freehold, New 
Jersey, that he shares with his parents and sister. This is the night he
 sees Elvis Presley. In that moment, when he receives that vision, he 
realizes that there is another way, that he can create an identity apart
 from “the lifeless, sucking black hole” that is his childhood.&nbsp;<br>
“All you needed to do,” Springsteen says when he unpacks the lesson Elvis taught him, “was to risk being your true self.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
“Yeah. . .,” Springsteen says when I sit down with him a couple weeks 
later and tell him it seems the essential question of his show is “Are 
we bound by what courses through our veins?” He looks off to his left 
into his dressing-room mirror, the surface of which is checkerboarded 
with photographs, much as a mirror in a teenage boy’s bedroom might be. 
Among the many images: John Lennon in his NEW YORK CITY T-shirt. A young
 Paul McCartney. Patti Smith. Johnny Cash. They are, as Springsteen 
tells me later, “the ancestors.” It’s into this mirror and toward these 
talismans that Springsteen often gazes when he is answering my 
questions. He’s a deep listener and acts with intent. He has a calm 
nature and possesses a low, soft voice. He has a tendency to be 
self-deprecating, preemptively labeling certain thoughts “corny.” He 
smiles easily and likes to sip ginger ale. Sometimes before telling you 
something personal, he lets out a short, nervous laugh. Above all, he 
speaks with the unveiledness of a man who has spent more than three 
decades undergoing analysis—and credits it with saving his life<br>
<br>
His cramped dressing room looks more like the “office” the 
superintendent of your prewar apartment building carves out for himself 
in the basement, next to the boiler. Much of it feels scavenged. There’s
 a brown leather couch and a beat-up coffee table. Nailed up above the 
couch is a faded, forty-eight-star American flag and a ragged strand of 
white Christmas-tree lights. Now Springsteen sits on the couch before 
me, dressed in black jeans and a white V-neck T-shirt that reveals a 
faint scar at the base of his neck—the scar that remains from a few 
years ago, when surgeons cut him open to repair deterioration on some 
cervical discs in his neck that had been causing numbness on the left 
side of his body. On his right ring finger is a gold ring in the shape 
of a horseshoe.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Finally, he speaks.<br>
<br>
“DNA is a big part of what the show is about: turning yourself into a 
free agent. Or, as much as you can, into an adult, for lack of a better 
word. It’s a coming-of-age story, and I want to show how this—one’s 
coming of age—has to be&nbsp;earned.&nbsp;It’s not given to anyone. It 
takes a certain single-minded purpose. It takes self-awareness, a desire
 to go there. And a willingness to confront&nbsp;all&nbsp;the very 
fearsome and dangerous elements of your life—your past, your 
history—that you need to confront to become as much of a free agent as 
you can. This is what the show is about...It’s me reciting my ‘Song of 
Myself.<br>
<br>
But as you learn after spending time with him, there is what is on the 
surface and then there is what is below. Because the show is also about 
other tensions: solitude versus&nbsp;love (the ability to give it as 
well as receive it); the psychological versus the spiritual; the death 
force versus the life force; and, most of all, the father versus the 
son. Yes, it is about his struggle to find his true self, his identity. 
But most of all, it is about his father—and Springsteen’s search to find
 peace with the man who created him but, in many ways, almost destroyed 
him. Here’s Springsteen describing in his 2016 autobiography,&nbsp;Born 
to Run,&nbsp;how he saw himself as a young boy, and how his father 
perceived him:<br>
<br>
Weirdo sissy-boy. Outcast. Alienated. Alienating. Shy. Soft-hearted 
dreamer. A forever-doubting mind. The playground loneliness . . . “<em class="text-italics">
 a gentleness, a timidity, shyness, and a dreamy insecurity. These were 
all the things I wore on the outside and the reflection of these 
qualities in his boy repelled [my father]. It made him angry.”<br>
<br>
He tells me his father made him ashamed that he was not hard like him 
but more like his mother. “My mother was kind and compassionate and very
 considerate of others’ feelings. She trod through the world with 
purpose, but softly, lightly. All those were the things that aligned 
with my own spirit.&nbsp;That&nbsp;was who I was. They came naturally to
 me. My father looked at all those things as weaknesses. He was very 
dismissive of primarily who I was. And that sends you off on a lifelong 
quest to sort through that.”<br>
<br>
Doug Springsteen was a stout man Springsteen remembers as “two hundred 
and thirty pounds of nickels in Sears slacks” and, at one point, as 
having the “face of Satan.” He worked a range of blue-collar jobs, from 
floor boy in a rug mill to bus driver, yet his primary occupation was 
not outside the house but inside; he dominated the family home, ruling 
his small kingdom with silence and menace. His throne was a chair at the
 kitchen table. Night after night, he’d sit in the darkness, drinking 
and brooding. “It was,” Springsteen writes, “the silent, dormant volcano
 of the old man’s nightly kitchen vigil, the stillness covering a red 
misting rage. All of this sat on top of a sea of fear and depression so 
vast I hadn’t begun to contemplate it.”<br>
<br>
When I ask Springsteen about his childhood, he tells me, “There was the 
house—and then there was what was happening in the kitchen. And when you
 went into the kitchen, the force of what was going on there was 
intimidating. But you had to&nbsp;deal&nbsp;with it. So the kitchen 
became freighted with meaning and danger. It was a dark, quiet place. 
The air was thick. So thick. Like swimming through dark molasses. You 
had to make your way through and make your way out—without disturbing, 
or creating too much attention toward yourself.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I tell him I find it interesting that he smashed that silence with rock ’n’ roll. A joyful noise<br>
<br>
“When I was a child, and into my teens,” he says, “I felt like a very, 
very empty vessel. And it wasn’t until I began to fill it up with music 
that I began to feel my own personal&nbsp;power and my impact on my 
friends and the small world that I was in. I began to get some sense of 
myself. But it came out of a place of real emptiness.” He pauses. “I 
made music for that kitchen. Go to&nbsp;Nebraska&nbsp;and listen to it. 
But I also made music for my mother’s part of the house, which was quite
 joyful and bright.” He locks his eyes on me. “You have to put together a
 person from&nbsp;all&nbsp;the stuff that you’ve been handed.”<br>
<br>
It was his father’s distance and silence that Springsteen rebelled 
against, yet his father’s identity is what he embraced. Because when 
Springsteen decided to adopt a rock ’n’ roll identity, what did he do? 
He stole his father’s work clothes and his persona—if Doug Springsteen 
wouldn’t love his true son, maybe at least he’d love a reflection of his
 son as himself.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
One of the rawest stretches of the show comes when he sings “My Father’s
 House,” from his sixth album,&nbsp;Nebraska.&nbsp;After, he speaks of 
still, forever, being a boy who yearns for his father’s love: “Those 
whose love we wanted but didn’t get, we emulate them. It is our only way
 to get it. So when it came time, I chose my father’s voice because 
there was something sacred in it to me.” He pauses. “All we know about 
manhood is what we have learned from our fathers. And my father was my 
hero, and my greatest foe.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Like too many of us, however, by choosing to mirror the identity of 
someone whose absent love he longed for, Springsteen ended up not 
knowing who he was<br>
<br>
He spent much of his life afraid to love or be anything more than an observer. It’s not surprising that he eventually spun out.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s first breakdown came upon him at age thirty- two, around 
the time he released&nbsp;Nebraska.&nbsp;It is 1982, and he and his 
buddy Matt Delia are driving from New Jersey to Los Angeles in a 1969 
Ford XL. On a late- summer night, in remote Texas, they come across a 
small town where a fair is happening. A band plays. Men and women hold 
each other and dance lazily, happily, beneath the stars. Children run 
and laugh. From the distance of the car, Springsteen gazes at all the 
living and happiness. And then: Something in him cracks open. As he 
writes, in this moment his lifetime as “an observer . . . away from the 
normal messiness of living and loving, reveals its cost to me.” All 
these years later, he still doesn’t exactly know why he fell into an 
abyss that night. “All I&nbsp;do&nbsp;know is as we age, the weight of 
our unsorted baggage becomes heavier . . . much heavier. With each 
passing year, the price of our refusal to do that sorting rises higher 
and higher. . . . Long ago, the defenses I built to withstand the stress
 of my childhood, to save what I had of myself, outlived their 
usefulness, and I’ve become an abuser of their once lifesaving powers. I
 relied on them wrongly to isolate myself, seal my alienation, cut me 
off from life, control others, and contain my emotions to a damaging 
degree. Now the bill collector is knocking, and his payment’ll be in 
tears.”<br>
<br>
That breakdown sent him into analysis. It—and the work he did on 
himself—transformed his life. He became the man he yearned to be but 
hadn’t known how to become. Springsteen’s desire to share his demons, 
and to argue for the need he believes all of us have to confront our 
own—this is one of the show’s great powers. We ignore our demons, he 
says, at our peril. The show is, as he calls it, “a magic trick.” But in
 other ways, as I tell Springsteen, it is a revival show—not just him 
energizing the audience through the power of his life-affirming, raucous
 songs; it is also a&nbsp;self-revival show. This is the work of a man 
revealing his flaws so that he can inspire us to redeem ourselves<br>
<br>
Nearly a decade after that night in Texas, Springsteen is at his home in
 Los Angeles. He’s living with Patti Scialfa, and they are days away 
from welcoming their first child, Evan. It is early morning, and there 
is a knock on the door: his father. Springsteen invites him in, and he 
and his father sit at the table. It is here, in his home, that his 
father tells him, “You’ve been very good to us.” Springsteen has no 
words. He can only nod. Then his father says, “And I wasn’t very good to
 you.<br>
<br>
“It was,” Springsteen says in the show, “the greatest moment in my life,
 with my dad. And it was all that I needed. . . . Here in the last days 
before I was to become a father, my own father was visiting me, to warn 
me of the mistakes that he had made, and to warn me not to make them 
with my own children. To release them from the chain of our sins, my 
father’s and mine, that they may be free to make their own choices and 
to live their own lives.” Late in his father’s life, <br>
<br>
Springsteen received an answer that gave him even deeper insight. He 
learned that all those nights Doug Springsteen sat alone, brooding, 
silent, in the dark of that kitchen, he was a man lost. A man who would 
be diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. The diagnosis gave Springsteen
 context to his boyhood. But it also gave him a new fear.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As Springsteen confesses to me, “I have come close enough to [mental 
illness] where I know I am not completely well myself. I’ve had to deal 
with a lot of it over the years, and I’m on a variety of medications 
that keep me on an even keel; otherwise I can swing rather dramatically 
and . . . just . . . the wheels can come off a little bit. So we have to
 watch, in our family. I have to watch my kids, and I’ve been lucky 
there. It ran in my family going way before my dad.”<br>
“I HAVE COME CLOSE ENOUGH TO [MENTAL ILLNESS] WHERE I KNOW I AM NOT COMPLETELY WELL MYSELF."<br>
Twenty years ago this past spring, his father died at age seventy-three in hospice, cradled&nbsp;<br>
<br>
in Adele’s arms. On the day of the funeral, after the priest finished 
his prayers at the graveside of the family plot in Freehold, Springsteen
 sent away the mourners and remained behind with only a few close 
friends and relatives. Then he took a shovel and moved every last bit of
 dirt onto his father’s grave.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
That’s quite biblical, what you did, I say to him. Burying your father’s body with your own hands.&nbsp;<br>
“I wanted that connection,” he says. “It meant a lot to me.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I ask him: Will you be buried there, too? In the family plot in St. Rose of Lima Cemetery?<br>
<br>
He looks off toward the mirror, pauses. And then comes the short laugh. 
“That’s a big question,” he says. “And I’ve asked myself that question 
on a variety of occasions. Will I end up there? I don’t know. I think 
I’ll just be . . . I think I’ll just spread myself around a little bit. 
Maybe a little in the ocean. [Laughs] A little in town. Here and there.”<br>
<br>
Is there anything your father never said to you that you wish he had said? Were there any words unspoken?<br>
Well,” Springsteen says, “he never said, ‘I love you.’ ”<br>
Never?<br>
“Nope. He never got around to it.”<br>
Not even when he lay dying?<br>
“Nope.”<br>
<br>
Does that hurt you?<br>
Springsteen pauses again and looks back toward his mirror. Then: “No. 
Because (a) I know he did. And (b) it just wasn’t in his repertoire. So 
he showed me he did, on many occasions. And so that was fine. My father 
was so nonverbal that . . . he cried whenever he left. When you’d say, 
‘I gotta go now, Dad’—boom!—tears. Later in his life, the last ten 
years, he was very visibly emotional.”<br>
<br>
I tell him that there is a line in the show where he says of his father,
 “If I had a wish, oh, man, it’d be that he could be here to see 
this”—and then I ask, Is there something you’d want to hear from 
him?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Springsteen goes silent. Then: “Honestly, I would have liked him to see 
who I was. That was what I was always running up against. He couldn’t 
see who I was. I mean, that’s what your children want from you—you are 
the audience. I figured that out really early in my kids’ lives. That’s 
the natural role of things. So somewhere inside of me, I still wanted my
 dad to be my audience. I wanted him to be mine. I wish for further and 
deeper understanding of who we both were.”<br>
<br>
<br>
Springsteen tells me he has found purpose through his children. He is 
the father of two sons and a daughter: Evan, twenty- eight, works for 
SiriusXM; Sam, twenty- four, is a firefighter in New Jersey; and 
Jessica, twenty-six, is an equestrian. He says he promised himself long 
ago that he would not lose his children the way his father lost him. 
Much of his struggle to become a good father had to do with the hurt and
 anger he had to work through. He was fighting what he calls “the worst 
of my destructive behavior.” His father sent him a message that a woman,
 a family, weakens a man. As he says, for years the idea of a home 
filled him “with distrust and a bucketload of grief.”<br>
<br>
He credits Scialfa, his wife of twenty-seven years, with inspiring him 
to be a better man, with saving him. (“By her intelligence and love she 
showed me that our family was a sign of strength, that we were 
formidable and could take on and enjoy much of the world.”) It’s no 
wonder that he brings her out in the center of the show and duets with 
her on “Tougher Than the Rest” as well as “Brilliant Disguise.” You read
 his book and you see the wisdom and sensitivity she brought to their 
relationship. It’s Scialfa who, when the kids are small, goes to Bruce, 
the lifelong nocturnal creature, and says, “You’re going to miss it.” 
What? he asks. “The kids, the morning, it’s the best time, it’s when 
they need you the most.” Cut to: Bruce, remaking himself as the early- 
morning-breakfast dad. “Should the whole music&nbsp;<br>
thing go south, I will be able to hold a job between the hours of 5:00 
and 11:00 a.m. at any diner in America. Feeding your children is an act 
of great intimacy, and I received my rewards: the sounds of forks 
clattering on breakfast plates, toast popping out of the toaster.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
And there it is: Bruce, no longer the son of scarcity but rather the 
father of abundance, reclaiming the kitchen for his family; transforming
 it from a fortress of darkness and silence into a land of brightness, 
filled with the sounds of life. Sitting here with me now, talking about 
his brood, he radiates joy. A father, proud of his children, grateful. I
 ask him, considering the current environment, what kinds of 
conversations he and his family are having around the kitchen table; 
what it means to be a man in society right now<br>
<br>
<br>
My kids . . . we’re lucky. They’re solid citizens.”<br>
<br>
But what would you say if you had to give advice to someone raising sons today?<br>
<br>
“Be present. Be there. If I have any advice to give, that is it. I mean 
you have to be&nbsp;fully&nbsp;present in mind, spirit, and body. And 
you don’t have to do anything. [Laughs] I mean, you get a lotta credit 
just for showing up. Just by being present, you guide them. My children 
are transitioning into adulthood. But I’ve found my presence still 
carries a great deal of weight—on that&nbsp;rare&nbsp;occasion now when 
someone actually still asks me a question. [Laughs]”&nbsp;<br>
I ask him to define the qualities that make up a good man today.<br>
<br>
“I do have two good men. And I would say their qualities are, they’re 
sensitive. They’re respectful of others. They are not locked into a 
1950s sensibility of manhood, which I had to contend with. Consequently,
 their attitudes toward women and the world are free of those 
archetypes, and that frees them to be who they are and have deeper and 
more meaningful relationships. They know themselves pretty well, which 
is something I can’t say for myself when I was that age. They know—and 
can show—love. And they know how to receive love. They know what to do 
with their problems. I think they have a sense of process as to how to 
work on themselves, which is something that I certainly didn’t have at 
twenty-five. These are the things that I’m proud of my boys for. They 
are&nbsp;quitedifferent from my generation.”<br>
<br>
And what about your daughter, who is navigating a world that has had a 
rebirth of misogyny—do you and Patti talk to her about this?&nbsp;<br>
“She’s learned quite a bit, even through the few serious relationships 
that she’s had. And what do I notice? It seems to me like women today 
learn a lot quicker. She came with a set of tools that—and I have to 
credit most of this to Patti, because Patti was just very in tune with 
all the kids all the time—allowed her to make her way through the world 
in a very aware way. Consequently, there’s a lot&nbsp;of bullshit she 
doesn’t put up with. My daughter—she’s really tough. She’s in a tough 
sport. She’s physically very brave, very strong, and mentally very, very
 tough. That came through Patti. Patti was very independent. So she has a
 roaring independence that has served her very well.”<br>
<br>
A “roaring independence.” I like that.<br>
“Yeah.” [Chuckles]<br>
There’s a lot of noise right now about what a man is.&nbsp;<br>
“My kids aren’t confused by that.”<br>
<br>
If you had to say, “Here are the qualities you should seek to instill in your young man,” what would you say?<br>
<br>
“The funny thing is . . . if you’re present from when they’re young and 
if you comport yourself even reasonably well, they pick up a lot of 
healthy habits. And that discussion happens implicitly. By your behavior
 at home and how you treat your partner and what they see. I by no means
 have been perfect. But if you give a&nbsp;reasonable&nbsp;presentation 
of yourself, a lot of that occurs implicitly.”<br>
<br>
Why, I ask, do so many men, whether they’re sixty-five or twenty-five, refuse to take responsibility for their actions?<br>
<br>
Springsteen sighs. “I would go back to DNA. If you grow up in a 
household where people are&nbsp;refusing&nbsp;to take responsibility for
 their lives, chances are you’re gonna refuse. You’re gonna see yourself
 as a professional victim. And once that’s locked into you, it takes a 
lotta self-awareness, a lotta work to come out from under it. I’m 
shocked at the number of people that I know who fall into this category.
 And it has nothing to do with whether you’re successful or not. It’s 
just your baggage. So that’s important to communicate to your children: 
They have to take responsibility for who they are, their actions, what 
they do. They’ve got to own their lives.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Is there, I ask, a code that you live by?<br>
<br>
“I’ve never tried to articulate it, to be honest. The qualities that my 
mother has are ones that I’ve tried to foster in myself. So what do I 
say? Kindness, a certain kind of gentleness that’s girded by strength. 
Thoughtfulness, which is very difficult for a narcissist like myself to 
deliver on a daily basis. I’ve had to get around my own 
self-involvement, which is one of the natural characteristics of the 
artist. If I had to say something, I’d say, ‘I’m steadfast, honest, and 
true.’ ”&nbsp;<br>
Steadfast, honest, and true. If this is his motto, it also represents 
the qualities his&nbsp;fans project onto him. These are the values 
Springsteen seems to embody that create such a bond with his audience. 
Because of this, they believe he knows them. And gives voice to their 
heartaches, as well as to the better selves they aspire to be. But he 
has also sought, especially in the second half of his career, to write 
songs that speak to social and class issues. He’s always revered folkies
 like Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, and around the time he released his
 1995 album&nbsp;The Ghost of Tom Joad,&nbsp;he began to strive to 
create songs that found the intersection between “The River” and “This 
Land Is Your Land.” A place where, as he says, “the political and 
personal came together to spill clear water into the muddy river of 
history.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I say to Springsteen, In your book, you write this about America: 
“Dread—the sense that things might not work out, that the moral high 
ground had been swept out from underneath us, that the dream we had of 
ourselves had somehow been tainted and the future would forever be 
uninsured—was in the air.” I tell him: What’s strange is that this is 
not you describing the mood of this country in 2018; this is you writing
 about the country in 1978, forty years earlier, at the time you 
wrote&nbsp;Darkness on the Edge of Town.&nbsp;Yet those words feel like 
they are about this country right now. Do you think America is worse or 
better? “I don’t think it’s better.<br>
<br>
You mean it’s worse? I ask.<br>
<br>
“Well, I guess forty years-plus would make it worse. And I do feel that 
people feel under siege, and sometimes for reasons that I don’t agree 
with and that are unfortunate. Like I say, whether it’s the changing 
face of the nation or . . . I think those people legitimately feel under
 siege. Their way of life is somehow threatened—is existentially 
threatened. And maybe that explains Trump and maybe it doesn’t, but . . .
 that’s always been a part of the American story. It continues to be a 
part of it today. At the time when I wrote those songs, I suppose it was
 a lot of what I was seeing around me.”<br>
<br>
There comes a moment in the show, before he sings “The Ghost of Tom 
Joad,” which was inspired by John Ford’s film adaptation of John 
Steinbeck’s&nbsp;The Grapes of Wrath,&nbsp;when he gives a beautiful 
reflection on how sacred he feels democracy is. He speaks of how “these 
are times when we’ve also seen folks marching, and in the highest 
offices of our land, who want to speak to our darkest angels, who want 
to call up the ugliest and most divisive ghosts of America’s past. And 
they want to destroy the idea of an America for all. That’s their 
intention.”<br>
<br>
So I ask him: Who are the “they”?<br>
<br>
“Well,” he says, “I would be talking about our president. Probably 
number one. [He] has no interest in uniting the country, really, and 
actually has an interest in doing the&nbsp;opposite and dividing us, 
which he does on an almost daily basis.<br>
<br>
 So that’s simply a crime against humanity, as far as I’m concerned. 
It’s an awful, awful message to send out into the world if you’re in 
that job and in that position. It’s just an ugly, awful message. You are
 intentionally trying to disenfranchise a large portion of Americans. I 
mean, you are simply . . . that’s unforgivable. And then there’s just 
the rise of—whether it’s the alt-right or the folks who were marching in
 Charlottesville with their tiki torches and all of that coming to the 
fore again, you know? Which our president was more than happy to play 
into and to play to. So these are folks who are invested in denying the 
idea of a united America and an America for all. It’s a critical moment.
 This has come so far to the surface, and it’s so toxic. And it appears 
to have a grip . . . and to be so powerful . . . in a lot of people’s 
lives at the moment. It’s a scary moment for any conscientious American,
 I think.<br>
<br>
<br>
And if you could, I say to him, make one request of citizens in this country right now, what would it be?<br>
<br>
A long silence follows. Springsteen turns back to the mirror and, at the
 same time, draws both of his booted feet up to the edge of the couch. 
He resembles a man squatting beside a campfire, watching flames. “I 
think that a lot of what’s going on has been a large group of people 
frightened by the changing face of the nation. There seems to be an 
awful lot of fear. The founding fathers were pretty good at confronting 
their fears and the fears of the country. And it’s the old cliché where 
geniuses built the system so an idiot could run it. We are completely 
testing that theory at this very moment. I do believe we’ll survive 
Trump. But I don’t know if I see a unifying figure on the horizon. That 
worries me. Because the partisanship and the country being split down 
the middle is something that’s gravely dangerous. To go back to your 
question, what would my wish be? [Sighs] It’s corny stuff, but: Let 
people view themselves as Americans first, that the basic founding 
principles of the country could be adhered to, whether it’s equality or 
social justice. Let people give each other a chance.”<br>
<br>
In the show, Springsteen plays many moments for laughs. He’s a natural 
actor, with a gift for landing a line or milking a moment. He’s also 
good at building the intensity of a story—or, if he has to, deflating 
it, as he does at one point when he shifts gears for an intense stretch 
and jokes, “I’m going to release you from suicide watch right now.” But 
as I prepare for our final meeting, I find myself thinking he may be 
hiding in plain sight. I think about his description of his second 
breakdown, which descended upon him a few years after he turned sixty. 
It was a darkness that lasted on and off for three years; it was, he 
writes, “an attack of what was called an ‘agitated depression.’ During 
this period, I was so profoundly uncomfortable in my own skin that I 
just wanted OUT. It feels dangerous and brings plenty of unwanted 
thoughts. . . . Demise and foreboding were all that awaited.<br>
<br>
It is the writing of a man desperate to escape profound pain. So when I 
see him, I ask: Have you ever attempted to take your life? “No, no, no.”<br>
But have you ever contemplated suicide?<br>
“I once felt bad enough to say, ‘I don’t know if I can live like this.’ 
It was like . . .” He pauses for a moment. Then: “I once got into some 
sort of box where I couldn’t figure my way out and where the feelings 
were so overwhelmingly uncomfortable.”<br>
Was that during your first breakdown?<br>
<br>
“No. This was the ‘agitated depression’ I talk about in the book, where 
feelings&nbsp;became so overwhelmingly uncomfortable that I simply 
couldn’t find a twelve-by-twelve piece of the floor to stand on, where I
 could feel a sense of peace on.” As he tells me this, he brings his 
hands up to either side of his face, framing it like blinders on a 
horse, as though trying to conjure that small square of safe space. 
Trying to see it. Then he says, all the while still holding his blinder 
hands to the sides of his head: “I had no inner peace whatsoever. And I 
said, ‘Gee, I really don’t know. I don’t know how long I could . . .’ It
 was a manic state, and it was just so profoundly emotionally and 
spiritually and physically uncomfortable that the only thing I’ve ever 
said was ‘Gee, I don’t know, man . . .’ It gave me a little insight into
 . . .”<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s voice trails off and he slowly lets his hands fall into 
his lap. For a moment, neither one of us says anything. Then I break the
 silence and ask: Did you think you should be hospitalized?<br>
<br>
“No one was&nbsp;saying&nbsp;that I should be . . .” Springsteen gives 
me a wry smile. “I had a couple very good doctors. But, unfortunately, 
it was August. That’s when they all take off.” Springsteen lets out one 
of his short, raspy laughs. “All I remember was feeling really badly and
 calling for help. I might have gotten close to that and for brief, 
brief periods of time. It lasted for—I don’t know. Looking back on it 
now, I can’t say. Was it a couple weeks? Was it a month? Was it longer? 
But it was a very bad spell, and it just came. . . . Once again—DNA. And
 it came out of the roots that I came out of, particularly on my 
father’s side, where I had to cop to the fact that I also had things 
inside me that could lead me to pretty bad places.”<br>
<br>
And when you see someone like Anthony Bourdain, can you understand how that happens?<br>
<br>
“Well, I had a very, very close friend who committed suicide. He was 
like an older son to me. I mentored him. And he got very, very ill. So, 
ultimately, it always remains a mystery—those last moments. I always 
say, Well, somebody was in a bad place, and they just got caught out in 
the rain. Another night, another way, someone else there . . . it might 
not have happened.” He pauses. “They were ill, and they got caught out 
in the rain. . . . I don’t know anyone who’s ever explained 
satisfactorily the moments that lead up to someone taking that action. 
So can I understand how that happens? Yes. I think I felt just enough 
despair myself to—pain gets too great, confusion gets too great, and 
that’s your out. But I don’t have any great insight into it, and in 
truth, I’ve never met someone who has.”<br>
<br>
Do you feel you have, at last, found your true self?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
“You never get there. Nobody does. You become more of yourself as time 
passes by. . . . In the arc of your life, there are so many places where
 you reach milestones that add to your authenticity and your 
presentation of who you really are. But I find myself still struggling 
just for obvious things that I should’ve had under my belt a long time 
ago. You know, when I get in those places where I’m not doing so well, I
 lose track of who I am. . . . The only thing in life that’s sure is: If
 you think you’ve got it, you don’t have it!”<br>
<br>
I tell him I want to pause for a moment, because some people might say, 
“What are you talking about? You’re Bruce fucking Springsteen! How do 
you not know who you are?”<br>
<br>
“Ugh.” Springsteen laughs and lets out a sigh. He drops his chin into 
his chest and then smiles and looks up. “Bruce fucking Springsteen is 
a&nbsp;creation.&nbsp;So it’s somewhat liquid—even though at this point 
you would imagine I have it pretty nailed down. But sometimes not 
necessarily. [Laughs] And personally—you’re in search of things like 
everybody else. Identity is a slippery thing no matter how long you’ve 
been at it. Parts of yourself can appear—like, whoa, who 
was&nbsp;thatguy? Oh, he’s in the car with everybody else, but he 
doesn’t show his head too often, because he was so threatening to your 
stability. At the end of the day, identity is a construct we build to 
make ourselves feel at ease and at peace and reasonably stable in the 
world. But&nbsp;being&nbsp;is not a construct. Being is just being. In 
being, there’s a whole variety of wild and untamed things that remain in
 us. You bump into those in the night, and you can scare 
yourself.”&nbsp;<br>
I ask if he has spent his life trying to love that boy his father denied.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
“Those were big moments that I had through my analysis. I saw myself as a
 child and experienced my own innocence and realized, Oh my God, I was 
so fragile. I was so easily broken and dismissed. My father taught me to
 hate that person. So it took me quite a while to come back around and 
make my peace with who I was. That was a lot of what I was doing through
 my playing—trying to come to a place where I could just stand myself. 
[Laughs] It was just developing a self that allowed me to live with 
myself in a way that a lot of the self-loathing didn’t allow. That’s 
just a part of my DNA. I do a lot better with it now, but it’s an 
ongoing struggle<br>
<br>
“I was well into my forties before I figured this out. I don’t know how 
to describe [that breakthrough] except you think you’re seeing all of 
yourself, and then it’s like a finger pokes at this boundary in front of
 you and suddenly a little brick drops out, and you look through [the 
wall], and you go, Oh my God—there’s this entire other world in there 
that I’ve never seen. And a lot of it, you’ve sort of been living in—I 
don’t know how to describe it—a cruel universe, and it’s just a little 
ray of light that allows you to see more of your experience and 
existence. [Pauses] I mean, what are you doing in analysis? You’re 
trying to take all this misunderstanding and loathing, and you’re trying
 to turn it into love—which is the wonderful thing that happens when 
you’re trying to make music out of the rough, hard, bad things. You’re 
trying to turn it into love. So along with that effort came the 
realization, through a lot of studying and analysis, of how rough I’d 
been on myself and had continued to be until a very late stage in life.”<br>
<br>
I tell him I’m thinking about his lines in “The Promised 
Land”—“Sometimes I feel so weak I just want to explode . . . take a 
knife and cut this pain from my heart. . .”—and how for years I thought 
the song was about the heartbreak of losing a woman.&nbsp;<br>
“It’s about existential weakness and trying to the best of your ability to transcend it.”<br>
And the line “the lies that leave you nothing but lost and brokenhearted”?<br>
<br>
“Everybody carries those things with them. It’s a line that always 
penetrates. It still penetrates for me when I sing it each night.”&nbsp;<br>
I tell him: You’re making me see that “The Ties That Bind” is not a love story but about the DNA family ties you can’t escape.<br>
“The bonds of your personal family,” he says, “but also the ties you 
can’t break among your community and your fellow citizens. You can’t 
forsake those things. It’ll rot your core at the end of the day. If you 
want to see someone who’s—look at Trump. He has forsaken a lot of these 
things, and it’s affected him. He’s deeply damaged at his core.”<br>
Because he forsook the ties, the bonds?<br>
“Absolutely. That’s why he’s dangerous. Anyone in that position who 
doesn’t deeply feel those ties that bind is a dangerous man, and it’s 
very pitiful.”&nbsp;<br>
And then I tell him I’m thinking about “Born to Run,” which contains 
four words in one line that are the sum of him:&nbsp;sadness, love, 
madness,&nbsp;and&nbsp;soul.&nbsp;“Together, Wendy, we can live with the
 sadness / I’ll love you with all the madness in my soul.<br>
<br>
<br>
“Those are my lines. ‘Born to Run.’ That’s my epitaph, if you wanna know
 my epitaph. There it is. It still is, probably—I use the song at the 
end of the show every night as a summary. The idea is that it can 
contain all that has come before. And I believe that it does.” Sadness, 
love, madness, soul. I tell him: Those are your four elements.<br>
“The last verse of my greatest song. And that’s where it ought to end 
every night.” Springsteen pauses. “Twenty-four when I wrote it. Wow. 
It’s a . . . holds up pretty well. But I . . . that was what I was 
aiming for in those days—that’s what I was shooting for.”<br>
I tell Springsteen that before I leave, I have one last question. In the
 book, he talks about how, when he was nineteen, he and his buddies 
loaded up a truck with all their worldly possessions and kissed Freehold
 goodbye. Yet a few years later, we learn that Springsteen, while dating
 a woman with a young daughter, has given the girl the rocking horse he 
loved as a boy.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
“Ah,” Springsteen says, a look of happiness rising up in his eyes, “my rocking horse.”<br>
Right, I say. But here’s the image I can’t square—you are a 
nineteen-year-old badass, ditching your hometown with your buddies. 
Lying on the back of a flatbed truck with a guitar and a duffel bag. And
 you’re telling me you have your rocking horse with you?<br>
Springsteen looks at me like I’m crazy. “Well, it was the only thing I had left from my childhood.”&nbsp;<br>
He goes on to tell me that years after giving the girl the rocking 
horse, he tracked down her mother and asked her to return it. The woman,
 however, had given it away. He pauses. I ask him if he has carried 
anything else with him from his childhood, and he tells me how when he 
was growing up, there was a merry-go-round on the Asbury Park boardwalk 
that he rode as a kid. “It had an arm and on the end of it, there was a 
gold ring. If you caught it, you got a free ride. I used to go nuts 
because I could never reach these rings. I rode it a thousand times. But
 then one night before I was about to put my first record out— I can 
remember the night . . . I got on the merry-go-round 
and&nbsp;bing!&nbsp;I grabbed the gold one.<br>
”<br>
Where is it now? I ask.<br>
<br>
“I keep it in my writing room, at home. And the rest is history</em></div>

DECEMBER 2, 2018<br>
<br>
Exclusive interview: Bruce&nbsp;Springsteen on how Donald Trump won over his blue-collar fans<br>
He’s a staunch Democrat, yet his working-class audience has embraced the
 Republican president. Bruce Springsteen tells Nick&nbsp;Rufford how 
Trump got under their skin<br>
<br>
Donald Trump’s most dangerous opponent may not be a politician, but a 
blue-collar rocker called Bruce Springsteen who shares millions of the 
same supporters as the Republican president, and also understands what 
makes grassroots America tick. So&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;should be pleasantly 
surprised to learn that Springsteen, a long-standing Democrat who 
campaigned for Barack Obama, believes the Donald is heading for a second
 term in the White House. The president has a flair for winning over 
working-class voters that the Democrats can’t rival, the singer admits. 
In short, Trump was born to run, and may be unstoppable.<br>
“I don’t see anyone out there at the moment … the man who can beat 
Trump, or the woman who can beat Trump,” Springsteen says. “You need 
someone who can&nbsp;speak some of the same language [as Trump] … and 
the Democrats don’t have an obvious, effective presidential candidate.”<br>
It’s bad news for Springsteen’s party, coming on top of 
its&nbsp;disappointing performance&nbsp;in last month’s midterm 
elections. Despite running their most expensive campaign ever, backed by
 Hollywood stars and predictions of a “blue wave” of support across the 
nation, the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, 
but failed to make sufficient gains to suggest the party was on track 
for the White House. In the Senate, they lost seats to their Republican 
rivals, particularly in places where Trump had paid a visit.<br>
Springsteen agrees the results were disheartening. “Yeah, it was nice to
 get the House back, but I’d like to have seen a much more full-throated
 [rejection] of the past two years,” he sighs with a shake of his head. 
“The country is very divided right now — there are a lot of people 
drinking the snake oil. So it’s a very difficult time here in the 
States.”<br>
What the nation needs is oil for troubled waters, he says. “We’ve come 
too far and worked too hard. Too many good people paid too high a price 
to allow this [the fracturing of America that Springsteen fears].”<br>
Could it be that the party needs a new candidate? Someone rather like 
Trump, with roots in bare-knuckle New Jersey, where the president built 
his boxing and gambling empire? A multimillionaire celebrity, with no 
political baggage, who speaks the language of the street and the 
truckstop, and connects with ordinary people?<br>
Someone, in other words, like Springsteen. After all, he’s 69, the age 
at which Trump declared his candidacy. Like the president, he is a child
 of the 1940s who fought his way to the top, dodging the Vietnam draft 
on the way. Trump’s brother was a heavy drinker, so was Springsteen’s 
father, prompting both to embrace clean living. Both campaign for combat
 veterans and rally stadium crowds against the backdrop of the American 
flag. They even cheer for the same baseball team, the New York Yankees.<br>
Will he throw his bandana into the ring for a last-chance power drive? 
Springsteen laughs. “No, not in any way, in any form,” he says. “I’d be 
terrible.” In any case, he’ll soon be “back to my day job” — touring 
with the E Street Band, including venues in the UK. He will 
also&nbsp;release a new album, his first for five years: “For lack of a 
better word, it’s a singer-songwriter album — more of a solo record.” 
His fans would prefer to see “the Boss” on stage than on the stump, he 
says.<br>
Springsteen is sitting in his dressing room. He’s looking a little older
 than the last time we met a couple of years ago, eyebrows flecked with 
grey. When talking about US politics, he chooses his words carefully, 
painting a portrait of an America more unequal, more divided, than at 
any time he can remember.<br>
He’s preparing to go on stage at the 960-seat Walter Kerr Theatre for 
his one-man show: Springsteen on Broadway. It’s a 2½-hour marathon that 
he’s been performing five nights a week since October 2017, with every 
show a sell-out. It will close shortly before Christmas, when a 
televised version will be shown on Netflix. There will also be an album 
including the 15 songs he performs nightly.<br>
The Stars and Stripes hangs on one wall of his dressing room and his 
mirror is covered with old photos, including a picture of the Castiles, 
the band he joined as a teenager. Of the five members, Springsteen is 
the only survivor. Bart Haynes, the drummer, was killed in action in 
Vietnam. George Theiss, the lead singer, died earlier this year from 
lung cancer. “It’s a little strange being the only guy remaining,” 
Springsteen says.<br>
Few musicians have his staying power. The simple reason he keeps going, 
he says, is that audiences keep coming. His most recent tour, was the 
top-earning worldwide in 2016, pulling in $268.3m globally. It was the 
highest-grossing tour since 2014 for any artist (beating Taylor Swift’s 
2015 tour, which grossed $250.1m).<br>
Much of the humour in his stage show is at his own expense. “I’ve never 
held an honest job in my entire life,” he admits. “I’ve never done any 
hard labour. I’ve never worked five days a week until right now. I’ve 
never seen the inside of the factory, and yet it’s all I’ve ever written
 about.”<br>
He strikes a chord with the baby-boomers in the audience when he tells 
them, to murmurs of recognition, that we may leave our home town, but 
the town never leaves us. “I’m Mr Born to Run … My home, New Jersey? 
It’s a death trap. It’s a suicide rap, all right? [Yet] I currently live
 10 minutes from my home town. Born to Come Back, who’d have bought that
 shit?” Likewise, he wrote one of his most famous songs, Racing in the 
Street, at 21, despite having no driving licence and, he confesses, he 
“hadn’t driven round the block”.<br>
There’s reflective silence as he shares stories of the struggles of 
daily American life that shaped his music. “My father worked as a 
16-year-old floor boy in the rug mill, then went off to war. When he 
came home, they shut the rug mill down, and he went to work on the 
Ford&nbsp;Motor plant line in New Brunswick. He worked in the Nescafé 
plant in Freehold. Worked in the plastics factory in town, he was a 
truck driver, a bus driver, drove a taxi.”<br>
The family toiled to make ends meet. They never ate out or owned a 
telephone (“No phone, no phone bills”). New York City was only an hour 
away from where he grew up in Freehold, but it might as well have been 
on the moon because there was no money to travel, he recalls.<br>
It’s these memories of hard times that underlie the less well-known 
reason he keeps performing — to raise money for good causes. There are 
plenty of hungry folk across the nation who have benefited from hot 
meals, or who have had their roof repaired or heating fixed during a 
bone-chilling East Coast winter, thanks to an anonymous benefactor.<br>
Pressed on the subject, he says: “Hunger in America is still a problem. 
[We’re] in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, so something’s 
wrong there, you know.”<br>
Since the Born in the USA tour in 1984, he’s donated typically $10,000 
per show to charity, handing over millions of dollars over the years. “I
 was 34 and looking around where I could be of some small assistance,” 
he says, explaining how it got started. “It was a time when a lot of the
 steel mills were closing down. I met the head of the local union in the
 Monongahela Valley [in America’s neglected Rust Belt] and he turned me 
onto a network of food banks that was the beginning of a national 
network. So we kind of grew along with that. It’s just something I’ve 
continued doing, and it’s not a big deal.”<br>
The opioid crisis, blamed for 48,000 deaths in America last year, mainly
 among the poor and luckless, is “a huge problem in the United States”, 
he says. Neither party has adequately addressed the poverty that 
underlies it, nor launched a relief effort on the scale required, he 
argues. “If you were looking at rescuing some of our inner 
cities,&nbsp;places where [hunger] is a huge issue, you would need 
something on the level of a national Marshall Plan. You would need a 
real serious programme, which never seems to get put together.”<br>
He plays the Stand Up for Heroes benefit concerts, which raise money for
 wounded combat veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq. “I play the guitar 
and raise some money. Again, it’s not a big deal, but it’s deeply 
needed.”<br>
Of course, as well as striving for the downtrodden and dispossessed, 
Springsteen takes care of himself. The proceeds from sales of 135m 
albums worldwide, plus touring, merchandise and other spinoffs, have 
bought him a 380-acre farm in New Jersey, where he and Patti Scialfa, 
his wife, raise horses. Plus there’s the house in Los Angeles, another 
in a gated community in Florida and an enviable collection of classic 
cars and motorbikes.<br>
His children attended a fee-paying school known for demanding standards 
and a dress code that would have got Springsteen kicked&nbsp;out in his 
younger days. Evan, 28, graduated from Boston College with a music 
degree and writes songs while working as a radio producer. Jessie, 26, 
is a successful showjumper and mixes with the international equestrian 
elite. Sam, 24, quit college to become a firefighter and a farmer, 
staying true to his dad’s blue-collar roots. Unconfirmed estimates put 
Springsteen’s wealth at $200m or more. He admits in his autobiography: 
“I live high on the hog, yacht around the Mediterranean and 
private-plane myself between dental appointments.”<br>
His friends in high places include Barack Obama, who presented him with 
the Presidential Medal of Freedom — America’s highest civilian honour — 
in 2016. Soon afterwards, Springsteen performed a private concert for 
Barack, Michelle and their staff before they left the White House: an 
evening of songs and storytelling that evolved into his current Broadway
 show. The couple remain close friends.<br>
Springsteen has the political connections, he admits, (and is rich 
enough) to run for office, but insists that good rockers don’t make good
 politicians, no matter how many records they sell. “At the end of the 
day, you’re just a musician with a loud mouth.”<br>
A decade ago, he campaigned actively for Obama, staging free concerts 
and raising funds. With no obvious successor — no Democratic frontrunner
 with a clear shot at the White House — Springsteen is reluctant to 
commit to doing the same for the next presidential race. “I don’t know 
precisely what I’m going to do this time, but I tend to think the more 
you make yourself available, perhaps the less weight your word carries,”
 he says, cautiously.<br>
Instead, he’s recently thrown his weight behind citizens’ movements, 
organised not by the Democrats but by coalitions of activists. They 
include a young people’s march calling for tighter gun laws, spurred by 
the Florida school shootings earlier this year, and a women’s rights 
campaign that drew thousands of protesters to the streets of Washington 
and cities across America. “We stand with you,” he said in a message 
from Australia, where he was touring. “We are the new American 
resistance.”<br>
It may be that Springsteen has grown disenchanted with the direction 
American politics is taking. Assembly-line workers, single mothers, 
farmers, truckers, folk from the sawmills of the Pacific Northwest, the 
trawler towns of Massachusetts and coal mines of Appalachia — 
Springsteen’s people — are feeling anxious these days, he admits. 
Depressed wages, ever-cheaper imports that undercut American-made goods 
and the pace of change of the digital age have left millions 
disillusioned. The gig economy is no substitute for real jobs, they 
complain, while every day there seem to be more laws and 
more&nbsp;things being outlawed.<br>
Instead of addressing these concerns, the Democrats at times appear 
preoccupied with banning plastic straws and ever-tighter controls on 
struggling smokestack industries. Meanwhile, Trump woos disaffected 
Democrat voters with promises to drain the swamp of smug politicians and
 their cronies, and tear up lousy trade deals. In his usual 
take-no-prisoners style, the president portrays his opponents as 
privileged East and West Coast liberals with scant regard for the folk 
in the geographical middle. As a case in point, the Democrats were 
odds-on to win the governorship of the Midwestern state of Ohio last 
month, and made the race one of the party’s top priorities. They lost 
after Trump visited the state on the eve of the poll to attack Richard 
Cordray, the Democratic candidate, calling him “a bad person who will do
 a terrible job”. Trump didn’t say what Cordray had done wrong, but the 
Democrats had talked about renewable energy and showing leniency towards
 drug offenders.<br>
Perhaps the Democrats should have taken their lead from Springsteen, 
whose protest song Youngstown focused on more pressing problems, those 
of Ohio’s Rust Belt. A few decades ago, the skies were lit up by blast 
furnaces smelting iron ore that came ashore from Lake Erie and turning 
it into steel that fed the nation’s manufacturing industries<br>
It all changed when the steelworks — which had once “built the tanks and
 bombs that won this country’s wars”, Springsteen sings — were shut down
 by faceless bosses who “did what Hitler couldn’t do”, leaving 
industrial blight.<br>
Youngstown had started to recover, but then General Motors laid off 
2,500 employees, shifting production of its Chevrolet cars to Mexico, 
where the hourly wage is less than $3, one-tenth that of its American 
workers.<br>
In a stirring pre-election speech, Trump reassured a Youngstown rally: 
“Those jobs [that] have left Ohio — they’re all coming back. We’re going
 to fill up those factories or rip them down and build brand new ones.” 
He promised tariffs on imported vehicles to protect local jobs, and 
described laid-off workers as America’s “forgotten men and women”. As a 
result, many Democrat voters switched allegiance, even though the 
promised tariffs were never imposed and the jobs have yet to return. Is 
this an example of why Trump is heading for a second White House term?<br>
I think that there are a lot of reasons people became Trump voters,” 
Springsteen says. “You had severe blows to working people in the 1970s 
and 1980s as all the steel mills shut down. Then you had an explosion of
 information technology. These are life-changing, upsetting occurrences.
 You can find yourself in a country that you may not feel part of, or 
you feel that your [concerns are] being dismissed. So [you’ve had] an 
enormous amount of insecurity and instability. Add to that, someone 
comes in and plays on your racial anxieties, and blames an enormous 
amount of this on the ‘other’ from the southern side of the border, and 
you’re going to have an audience for those views. I basically think that
 [the problem] is the incredibly rapid pace of change that’s occurred in
 the United States that’s gone unaddressed by both administrations, 
Democrat and Republican.”<br>
Would Springsteen back tariffs on foreign imports to help places like 
Youngstown? “I feel, like most Americans, I’d like to see American jobs 
stay in the States. I don’t believe Donald Trump is the solution. I 
haven’t seen he’s somebody with answers. He’s kept to a pretty 
conventional path. You know, tax cuts for the better off. I’m not 
sure&nbsp;about the power of those tariffs to do what he claims they 
might do. I don’t know if there is a way to really bring those jobs back
 and I think that’s what’s causing so much anxiety to so many 
Americans.”<br>
His undisguised contempt for Trump — he’s called him a “deeply damaged 
man” and a “moron” — has inevitably alienated some fans, a fact he’s 
resigned to and the price, he says, of sticking to his beliefs.<br>
Unusually, Trump has never hit back at Springsteen, even though he 
hasn’t refrained from socking it to other celebrities. After Robert De 
Niro denounced Trump from the podium at this year’s Tony awards 
ceremony, the president suggested the actor may be brain damaged, 
tweeting: “Robert De Niro, a very Low IQ individual, has received too 
many shots to the head by real boxers in movies”. But on Springsteen 
he’s maintained a respectful silence, wary perhaps of forcing his voters
 to choose between the president and the Boss.<br>
The deaths of some of Springsteen’s closest friends have recently made 
him take stock. “Life is finite, and you’ve got just so much&nbsp;time,”
 he says. Along with the Castiles, two members of his E Street Band are 
dead: Clarence Clemons, the saxophonist, and Danny Federici, the 
accordionist. He thinks about them every day, he sighs. “You know, 
ghosts live among us. They don’t ever quite leave us and there’s 
something beautiful and hopeful in that. I enjoy visiting the spirits of
 my father and Clarence, and my friends and family, which I do on stage 
each night.”<br>
He’s now a regular visitor to the Catholic church in Freehold where he 
was an altar boy. Surprising, given that over the years he has railed 
against his strict Catholic upbringing. Harsh treatment meted out by 
nuns at the Saint Rose of Lima primary school in Freehold sowed the 
seeds of angst that haunts him to this day.<br>
“You get more spiritual as you grow older,” he explains. “You’re closer 
to the other world, so maybe that has something to do with it. I’m sort 
of past the dogmatic religion. That got burnt out of me when I was a 
kid. But what never leaves you are those eight formative years of 
Catholic education. I do still find myself drawn to the 
Catholic&nbsp;church. I visit my small church quite often. I’m not sure 
whether that’s for religious or nostalgic purposes, but I continue to 
feel the Catholic church’s imprint on me rather strongly.<br>
Does he go to confession?” No, he laughs. “I haven’t done that in quite a while.”<br>
As well as bouts of depression, he’s fought a battle with tendonitis, 
brought on by many years of guitar strumming, had “nerve-wracking” 
throat surgery and an operation to repair the damaged discs in his neck 
that were causing numbness down one side. As Indiana Jones is reminded 
by a friend in the last Raiders film: “Indy, we’ve reached the age where
 life stops giving us things and starts taking them away.”<br>
All the more reason why Springsteen is determined to stay on top of his 
game (and keep breathing, he jokes). He works out, though less 
vigorously than before. “The older you get I find the less you have to 
do.<br>
A little bit of walking two or three times a week and I still lift 
weights very moderately three or four times a week, for short periods. 
That’s all it takes for me now. Then [there’s] your diet; you can’t eat 
anything&nbsp;you like. I’ll have oats and some fruit when I get up, a 
vegetarian chilli or something for lunch, then a light dinner.”<br>
Vegetarian? Is he one? “No, I’m not,” he says quickly, perhaps mindful 
of how that might sound to fans in the Chicago stockyards. “I have a 
pretty basic diet.”<br>
Older musicians than him are still rocking, he points out. “Your Mick 
Jagger [75] does very well,” he says. “So does&nbsp;Paul 
McCartney&nbsp;[76]. BB King and Chuck [Berry] played into their 
eighties. I sang with Pete Seeger when he was 90.” And longevity is in 
his genes, he says. His aunts Dora and Ida lived to 92 and 90 
respectively, and his mother, Adele, is still active at 93, albeit with 
Alzheimer’s disease.<br>
He’s said: “I’m suited for the long haul. I’m interested in what I might
 accomplish over a lifetime of music making. I would like to have a 
70-year-old Elvis reinventing his talents and [seen] where Jimi Hendrix 
might’ve next taken the electric guitar.”<br>
When he tours in the next few months with the E Street Band, he may have
 to forgo the energetic knee slides across the stage and crowd surfing 
that were once trademark features of concerts that stretched to four 
hours and more. But otherwise he’s making no concessions.<br>
It’s welcome news for the millions who look back on their lives to the 
soundtrack of five decades of Springsteen’s music. And he has a clear 
message for those watching him for their cue to ease off the throttle, 
kick back and retire: “Don’t stop … keep going.”<br>
Can we look forward to another decade of rocking?<br>
“Sure. Why not.”<br>
Springsteen on Broadway is out on Columbia Records on December 14. The film of the show premieres on Netflix on December 15</div>

</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">BILLBOARD<br>
May 6, 2019</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">The Boss has written nearly a full album's worth of material for the band</em><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen, by his own admission, showed up at Raleigh Studios in
 Hollywood Sunday night, May 5,&nbsp; “begging complete strangers for 
their vote” at an event hosted by Netflix to promote 
his&nbsp;Springsteen on Broadway&nbsp;special before Emmy voters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The special was discussed during an often humorous, personal chat 
between Springsteen and Martin Scorsese, who first met in 1975 when the 
legendary director and Robert DeNiro went to see Springsteen at the Roxy
 in Los Angeles.&nbsp;But it was about 30 minutes into the 40-minute 
talk that Springsteen said what any Boss fan wanted to hear:&nbsp; There
 will be another tour with the E Street Band.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I’ve spent about seven years not writing anything for the band. I 
couldn’t write anything for the band,” confessed Springsteen, whose new 
solo album, Western Stars, comes out June 14.&nbsp;“And then about a 
month or so ago, I wrote almost an album’s worth of material for the 
band and it came out of just… I mean I know where it came from, but at 
the same time, it just came out of almost nowhere. I had almost two 
weeks of those daily visitations and it was so nice.&nbsp; It makes you 
so happy. You go, ‘Fine, I’m not fucked.’ There’ll be another tour.”<br>
The news brought a cheer from the 200-person audience, who were also 
treated to a two-song performance of “Dancing In the Dark” and “Land of 
Hope and Dreams” by Springsteen.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Among the other highlights:</strong>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">You Gotta Have Faith:</strong>&nbsp; Both 
Springsteen and Scorsese attended Catholic school and its influence has 
never left either of them.&nbsp; “All my work was informed from my years
 at Catholic school and I was never able to outrun it,” Springsteen 
said. “As I got older I stopped fighting against it. Now I draw on it 
and enjoy it. First of all, there’s no greater well to draw from than 
the myths in Catholicism: Redemption, damnation, death, sexual torture… 
The faith you had a a child, I think was very fear-based. You’re in 
second grade, so you’re seven years old and, you’re making your first 
confession. What do you have to confess?&nbsp; I had to make things 
up.&nbsp; You went into the dark box and you confessed, supposedly, your
 deepest secrets… As you get older, if it works out, it becomes love 
based…The record Nebraska was very influenced by Flannery O Connor and 
her stories were always based on the unknowability of God.&nbsp; I think
 as you get older, that’s what you grow comfortable with: Faith is 
faith. It’s trust. It’s about all of the mysteries and the answers that 
you’re never going to come up with…But if you let it be, that’s when you
 find a little bit of peace. That’s what I’ve found anyway.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen, Funeral Crasher:&nbsp;</strong>“I
 get drawn back to my church. I attended some stranger’s funeral a month
 ago,” Springsteen said. “I was driving by it and saw the door was open 
and I said, ‘I gotta go in. I gotta go back.’ I went in and there was 
some nice man’s funeral going on and I sat in the back and it was 
completely bizarre."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The Dark Side:</strong> “If you’re an 
artist, the darkness is always more interesting than the light. It’s 
nice when you let the light in at the end of something, but I was always
 interested in what were the things that didn’t go right,” Springsteen 
said. “I had a habit—I would drive back to my hometown and I would do 
this over and over again and I used to ask myself, ‘what am I coming 
back here for?’ And I still do it. I’m nearly 70 years old… I don’t 
know&nbsp; if you’re going back to fix things that went wrong or so much
 happened there that informed your work and your life, it still remains a
 rich location, but I always wanted base the heart of my work in the 
dark side of things and then you had to earn the light.….The artists 
that are interesting: You think of Hank Williams or Elvis or Frank 
Sinatra or Bob Dylan or Marty Scorsese, it’s ‘What’s bothering that guy?
 ['A lot,’ answered Scorsese, with a laugh]. That’s what keeps us 
watching. That’s why you can watch Bob DeNiro’s face on the screen for 
two hours..it never gives up its secrets. I don’t think there’s 
necessarily an answer, but you do ask question&nbsp;after question in 
the work that you create and those questions are fascinating and they 
bring you closer to a certain kind of truth and that’s the best you can 
do.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Reaching&nbsp;for the Divine:</strong> “As a
 kid you had your little rote prayers before you went to bed,” 
Springsteen said. “I think as you get older and find your form that 
you’re going to work with, you find your little prayers that provide you
 the inner vision and you capture a small— if you’re very, very 
fortunate and good at your job—you capture a small piece of the 
divine.&nbsp; It’s why the creative process has never been and will 
never be explained.&nbsp; There’s a small tiny divine part of ourselves 
that connects to something that is bigger than you and bigger than the 
folks and everyone watching…It can come in many, many forms, but 
whenever I’ve really&nbsp; written something that I felt had some 
[divine] quality to it, there’s always that little piece of&nbsp; ‘Oh, 
I’m not exactly sure where that came from.’”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Thanks, Obama!:</strong>&nbsp;“The whole 
[Springsteen on Broadway] came about as a bit of an accident.” 
Springsteen said. “President Obama, the last couple of weeks he was in 
office, asked me to come down and&nbsp;play at the White House. I said 
I’m not going to bring the whole band down, so I’d written the memoir 
and said, maybe I’ll read from the book a little bit and play a few 
songs. And then when I went to read from the book, I realized that 
reading something is different than the way you speak it. So I rewrote 
what I was going to say as a spoken-word piece. I went down and played 
about 90 minutes of what became the Broadway show in the East Room. 
There was just some alchemy there that felt really right.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">From Play to Film:</strong>&nbsp;“[Director]
 Thom [Zimny] and [Springsteen’s manager] Jon [Landau] were debating 
what was going to be the role of the&nbsp;audience,” Springsteen said. 
“Jon first said, ‘there shouldn’t be any audience, we should just film 
you on stage.’ <em class="text-italics"> ‘Well, who’s going to laugh at 
my jokes? I’m going to tell a joke and you’re not&nbsp; going to hear 
anything. That’s not going to work out.’…Then we decided we’d have an 
audience, but we won’t show an audience, which is what you did 
in&nbsp;The Last Waltz.&nbsp;We didn’t want to telegraph to the audience
 what they were supposed to feel.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Thanks, Elvis!</strong>:&nbsp;Springsteen’s 
Netflix special opens on a close up of his face.&nbsp; “That was Jon 
Landau.&nbsp; That was his shot,” Springsteen said. “ I don’t know if he
 was influenced by the great Elvis&nbsp;’68 Comeback Special&nbsp;where 
the first thing you see is&nbsp; Elvis going [imitating Presley, ‘If 
you’re looking for trouble”] and you see Elvis’s face. Much better 
looking than my face. It was a good kick off.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">First Night Jitters:</strong>&nbsp;“You’re 
got to make your internal life available and you can’t worry about 
that,” Springsteen said. “You’ve got to be ready to look into the 
camera, which is unforgiving and frightening. We shot two nights. And 
the first night, I was really uncomfortable, which was a little unusual,
 but I came out and I’m looking into the camera and I‘m trying to do 
what I usually do and I realize I’m doing the weirdest thing you can do 
on stage, which is think about what you’re doing. Don’t ever do 
that…because you’re fucking it up…I went home and said,&nbsp;‘I gotta up
 my game for tomorrow.’&nbsp; I came back the next day and found I was 
more relaxed because when you’re too completely self conscious, you’re 
not in it and when you’re not in it, you’re not making your emotional 
life available. As long as you’re making your emotional and inner life 
available, you’re very watchable. The audience will watch you do that 
because it’s death defying. You’re on a tightrope.&nbsp; That was our 
biggest concern because there’s one old guy and an acoustic guitar. 
That’s the show.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">We Can't All Be the Boss:</strong>&nbsp;Springsteen
 asked Scorsese how he selects the music, which plays such an 
overwhelming part in so many of his films. “It comes from my 78s and 
45s, from my old collection which I still have,” Scorsese said. “In 
fact, in&nbsp;Mean Streets, we used the old 45s with the scratches. It’s
 a film that sounds like the music. If I could play music, I wouldn’t 
have to do all this.”</em></div>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: Western Stars review – the Boss takes the scenic route | Bruce Springsteen | The Guardian<br>
<br>
Trailed as a break with tradition, the lush orchestrations and swooning 
vocals of this finely wrought album, in fact, chime beautifully with 
Springsteen’s history<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The Guardian<br>
June 6, 2019<br>
Alexis Petridis</strong><br>
<br>
The 19th Bruce Springsteen album has been heralded as a dramatic break 
from tradition. So dramatic, in fact, that in the interviews 
accompanying its release, Western Stars’ author has felt impelled to 
reassure fans that he’ll be back recording and touring with the E Street
 Band later this year. It’s hard to miss the hint of “normal service 
will be resumed as soon as possible” about that announcement, balm for 
Boss fans horrified by how far Western Stars takes their hero from 
either of his standard musical styles.<br>
<br>
<br>
There’s not a hint of the E Street Band’s booming sturm und drang, nor 
the stripped-back earthiness of his previous solo albums here: they’re 
replaced by luscious orchestrations, heavy on the strings and French 
horn, cooing female backing vocals, guitars that shimmer and quiver with
 tremolo effects, mournful pedal steel. It’s not founded in country 
music so much as a distinctive musical hybrid that flowed out of 
Hollywood’s recording studios in the late 1960s and early 70s, which 
stirred Nashville with west coast folk-pop and ambitious, sophisticated 
arrangements: the grownup American pop of Glen Campbell’s collaborations
 with Jimmy Webb or Harry Nilsson’s covers of Everybody’s Talkin’ and I 
Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City.<br>
<br>
This is clearly a departure, although there’s a sense in which it’s 
entirely in keeping with Springsteen’s approach. His sound is almost 
invariably based in burnished nostalgia. The E Street Band and The Ghost
 of Tom Joad alike are rooted in the music that flourished in the US 
when Springsteen was 12 or 13 years old: the former an amplification of 
pre-Beatles American pop – both the echoing drama of Phil Spector and 
the blare and honk of Gary US Bonds and Dion and the Belmonts – the 
latter a take on the early 60s folk revival, with particular reference 
to Bob Dylan in young, keeper-of-the-Woody-Guthrie-flame mode. Western 
Stars simply shifts its backwards gaze on a few years, to the stuff that
 would have dominated mainstream taste during Springsteen’s late teens: 
at a time when it might have been hipper to dig Jefferson Airplane, but 
what budding young artist could fail to have his head turned by such 
consummate examples of the songwriter’s craft?<br>
<br>
Certainly, there’s a real and rather affecting love evident in the way 
Springsteen channels the sound on Western Stars. There are moments of 
transcendent loveliness – not least the shivering instrumental coda of 
Drive Fast – but he’s also unafraid of its occasional tendency towards 
schmaltz. Quite the opposite. Listening to There Goes My Miracle or 
Sundown, on which he slathers on the high-camp strings and transforms 
his voice into a croon, denuded of the usual Springsteen grit, you get 
the feeling he’s having a whale of a time: an artist always held up as 
the apotheosis of honest, blue-collar heartland rock revelling in 
artifice, in much the same way as he audibly delighted in telling 
audiences at his Broadway residency that the character of Bruce 
Springsteen was a Ziggy Stardust-ish construct who had never done 
anything. It helps that the songs are strong enough to withstand the 
treatment, seldom slipping into pastiche. The only real misfire is 
Sleepy Joe’s Café, which feels a little round-edged for its own good, 
not aided by an ingratiatingly perky accordion: the E Street Band could 
have turned it into something more driving and potent.<br>
<br>
“It’s the same sad story, going round and round,” Springsteen sings on 
The Wayfarer and listening to the rest of the album’s lyrics, you take 
his point. If the sound of Western Stars sets it apart from 
Springsteen’s earlier solo albums, the words pull it closer. Like 
Nebraska or The Ghost of Tom Joad, it offers a selection of bleak 
narratives and lingering pen-portraits, and, like Nebraska and The Ghost
 of Tom Joad, it seems a product of its era. The former album’s cast of 
conflicted cops and desperate criminals undercut the gung-ho 
triumphalism of Reagan’s America, while Tom Joad’s illegal immigrants 
and drug runners did the same for an era of record highs on the Dow 
Jones index. Western Stars, meanwhile, is populated by characters past 
their best – the title track’s fading actor, reduced to hawking Viagra 
on TV and retelling his stories for anyone who’ll buy him a drink; Drive
 Fast’s injured stuntman recalling his youthful recklessness, the failed
 songwriter of Somewhere North of Nashville and the guy glumly surveying
 the boarded-up site of an old tryst on Moonlight Motel – all of them 
ruminating on how things have changed, not just for the worse, but in 
ways none of them anticipated.<br>
<br>
It adds up to an album that manages to be both unexpected and of a piece
 with its author’s back catalogue. Normal service may well be resumed in
 due course, but Western Stars is powerful enough to make you wish Bruce
 Springsteen would take more stylistic detours in the future.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen, “Western Stars” (Columbia)<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">AP Review - June 10, 2019</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen’s new studio release breaks fresh ground for the 
veteran rocker, who turns his back not only on the blistering sound of 
the E Street Band but also abandons the haunting acoustic moods 
pioneered on “Nebraska” and fine-tuned on later solo efforts.<br>
<br>
After the soul-searching, confessional tone of his best-selling 
autobiography and sold-out Broadway show, Springsteen’s “Western Stars” 
relies on an unfamiliar orchestral approach that somewhat masks the 
singer and is devoid of driving beats, sax solos and rock ‘n’ roll 
tropes.<br>
<br>
Instead, he draws on the rich tradition of California-styled, 
pre-Beatles pop. There are hints of Roy Orbison’s soaring vocals and 
Brian Wilson’s pocket symphonies, but the lyrics are pure Springsteen. 
Beneath the glossy sheen are the taut narratives, introspection and 
ambiguous moments familiar to longtime listeners. His storytelling 
skills are as strong as ever, just presented in a different way.<br>
<br>
He’s paying homage to an era when the single reigned, and radio airtime 
went a long way to determining an artist’s success or oblivion, but 
Springsteen is not looking for No.1 hits with easy hooks. “Western 
Stars” is understated, without over-the-top orchestration or hyperbole. 
Each song stands alone as a self-contained story; taken as a whole it’s a
 panorama of loneliness and heartbreak. The protagonists are mostly men,
 and mostly beaten down, but there are occasional whiffs of freedom, 
usually tied to the joys of the open road, that most enduring of 
American myths.<br>
<br>
It is no accident that the album opens with “Hitch Hikin'” and this 
straightforward image of a loner in perpetual motion: “Thumb stuck out 
as I go/I’m just travelin’ up the road/Maps don’t do much for me, 
friend/I follow the weather and the wind.” It’s a recurring image dating
 back to the days of Woody Guthrie.<br>
<br>
There are other fully-formed characters from Springsteen’s imagination: 
the failed country music songwriter, his lyrics rejected at every turn, 
the busted up B-movie stuntman held together by rods and pins, even a 
rundown hotel with an empty swimming pool with dandelions pushing up 
through the cracked concrete takes on a life of its own as a character 
in “Moonlight Motel.”<br>
<br>
But it’s not all heartbreak. There are small celebrations, too, notably 
in “Sleepy Joe’s Café,” where working men and women can find solace on 
the dance floor when weekend comes. It’s a dreamy place where Monday 
morning is far, far away, and Springsteen has placed it in the context 
of the postwar economic boom that powered America for decades: “Joe came
 home in ’45 and took out a G.I. loan/On a sleepy little spot an Army 
cook could call his own/He married May, the highway come in and they 
woke up to find they were sitting on top of a pretty little gold mine.”<br>
<br>
It’s a nostalgic vision, yes, but those roadhouses still exist. You just have to drive a bit</div>

 Springsteen: 'tapping into universal feelings'</strong><br>
<br>
Nothing can quite prepare you for Western Stars, Springsteen's homage to
 classic artists like Glen Cambell and Burt Bacharach. It's not just the
 presence of horns and strings. What really leaves you open-mouthed is 
the voice. Gone is the trademark sand and grit, and in its place, we get
 an effortless-yet-weary, country croon.<br>
It's all a far cry from the Boss's work with the E Street Band. The 
musical arrangements hark straight back to a golden age of orchestral 
pop and songs like "Wichita Lineman". Melodies swoop, and strings glide.
 There are sad muted horns and tinkles of electric piano. When the 
strings recede, underneath are country guitars.<br>
The whole album is soaked in the early Seventies. This is a world of 
long distances, loneliness and, above all, nostalgia. The songs are 
populated with broken-hearted drifters and worn-out has-beens. Like the 
faded actor in the title track reduced to boring strangers in motel 
bars. Or the physically broken stuntman on "Drive Fast" who reminds you 
of Springsteen's "Wrestler" from 1995. The difference, of course, is in 
the delivery. Cascading strings make the stuntman's tale feel yearning 
rather than desolate. <br>
Other songs are simply sumptuous. The soaring vocals on "There Goes My 
Miracle" sound almost like the Walker Brothers. And yet, it still feels 
deceptively weighty. By locating the songs in a place just out of reach,
 Springsteen taps into universal feelings of ageing and longing. The 
album's climax, "Chasing Wild Horses" is as powerful as anything he's 
ever done. <br>
What Springsteen purists will make of Western Stars remains to be seen. 
Some may consider it a curiosity. Others, no doubt, will remain 
convinced that the Boss should spend his time alternating between albums
 that sound a bit like Nebraska and Born to Run. But even rock stars 
need to mellow out. Springsteen is now almost 70. Surely, projects like 
this and his recent Broadway residency are exactly the sort of thing he 
should be doing. <br>

BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN WESTERN STARS</strong><br>
<br>
BOTTOM LINE A gorgeous, melancholy tribute to aging, broken men, who are down, but not defeated<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen likes to take artistic left turns after his biggest 
successes. And his new album “Western Stars” (Columbia) follows in the 
tradition of “Nebraska” and “The Ghost of Tom Joad” as a new approach no
 one saw coming, following his well-received autobiography and the 
unprecedented Broadway run it spawned.<br>
<br>
For “Western Stars,” Springsteen pairs the orchestral grandeur of early 
1970s greats like Harry Nilsson and the collaborations of Glen Campbell 
and Jimmy Webb with tales of men trying to cope with lives, knowing they
 are past their prime. The title track is about an actor best known for 
being shot by John Wayne now peddling erectile dysfunction medication. 
“Somewhere North of Nashville” is about a struggling songwriter’s 
regrets, including, “I traded you for this song.” And “Drive Fast (The 
Stuntman)” is about a stuntman trying to find moments of happiness to 
hang onto, a time when the orchestral swells of the string sections are 
merited.<br>
<br>
The stuntman narrator of “Drive Fast” is like nearly all of the subjects
 in “Western Stars,” ready to admit his mistakes, but not looking for 
pity. “A steel rod in my leg,” sings Springsteen, who turns 70 in 
September, “but it walks me home.”<br>
<br>
The album’s strongest moments are the first singles – the relatively 
upbeat and wistful “Hello Sunshine,” which is reminiscent of Campbell’s 
“Gentle on My Mind,” and the magnificent “There Goes My Miracle,” which 
includes backing vocals from Patti Scialfa and Seaford native Matthew 
Koma, who help create a unique hybrid of Smokey Robinson classics and 
The Left Banke’s “Walk Away Renee.” However, every song on “Western 
Stars” has its own bit of magic, a line or an instrumental passage (like
 the stunning opening of “Sundown”) that makes you understand why it’s 
included and what it contributes to Springsteen’s overall point.<br>
<br>
Sure, many fans are more excited by the news that Springsteen and The E 
Street Band will record a new album and tour. But “Western Stars” shines
 brightly enough to thrill on its own.</div>

The New York Times Review<br>
Jon Pareles<br>
June 12, 2019</strong><br>
<br>
Amid&nbsp;Bruce Springsteen’s huge songwriting catalog, “Western Stars” 
is a side trip in place and time: a homage to a bygone pop era and a 
return to one of his recurring fascinations — the present-day American 
West as envisioned and, in the early 1990s, inhabited by a native New 
Jerseyan. It’s not an album courting new young fans or claiming any 2019
 zeitgeist. It’s more like a speculative alternate history: What if 
Springsteen’s music had taken a very different direction at the start?<br>
<br>
“Western Stars” arrives following the explicit autobiography and starkly
 staged sincerity of&nbsp;“Springsteen on Broadway,”&nbsp;even though it
 was in the works before those performances. Instead of trying to extend
 that revealing tour de force, the new album veers elsewhere; it’s an 
experiment in genre and narratives. Most (and perhaps all) of the songs 
are other people’s stories, not Springsteen’s own. In them, the West — 
California along with Arizona and Montana — can be a promise of open 
spaces and second chances. But more often, the western horizon is the 
end of the line, where Springsteen’s characters find themselves alone 
with their regrets.<br>
<br>
The music itself is a kind of character study. It harks back to an early
 1970s pop style that Springsteen — now 69, whose debut album appeared 
in 1973 — had nothing to do with at the time. “Western Stars” revisits a
 sound that found a place in Los Angeles studios — particularly in 
Laurel Canyon in the late 1960s and early 1970s — and in Nashville as a 
means to get country singers onto pop radio by making country music 
“countrypolitan.” The era’s elaborate productions — the sound of 
performers like Glen Campbell, Harry Nilsson, Charlie Rich and the Mamas
 and the Papas — enfolded pristinely recorded acoustic guitars and 
keyboards, understated drums and mere whispers of country-style pedal 
steel guitar into lofty orchestral arrangements. At the time, it could 
turn corny and overwrought. In 2019, however, the style is a direct 
repudiation of current pop: smooth and liquid rather than rhythmic and 
sparse, and relying largely on acoustic, physical instruments (though on
 Springsteen’s album, a few synthesizers slip in).<br>
<br>
Those early 1970s productions were unapologetically decorous, 
premeditated, luxurious and grown-up. Yet often, in songs 
like&nbsp;Skeeter Davis’s “The End of the World”&nbsp;or Campbell’s “By 
the Time I Get to Phoenix,” the plush orchestral pop hits of the 1960s 
and 1970s cushioned sorrow and solitude. They were worlds away from the 
turbocharged bar band that would become Springsteen’s E Street Band, and
 they were clearly aiming for the middle of the road, not the fast lane.
 The craftsmanship in those studio efforts was as self-effacing as it 
was substantial; the hired musicians were intended to serve the song, 
not to be noticed. As a lifelong student of American popular music, 
Springsteen clearly noticed.<br>
<br>
On “Western Stars,” a few songs — “Tucson Train,” “Sundown,” “Stones” — 
sound like the E Street Band could be swapped in for the orchestra. But 
Springsteen strives to meet his chosen idiom more than halfway. He wrote
 songs that thrive on the swells and undulations of orchestral drama, 
and he sings with long-breathed phrases that aren’t exactly crooning — 
he’s not built for that — but that set out to sustain more than they 
exhort.<br>
<br>
One of the centerpieces of “Western Stars” is “Chasin’ Wild Horses.” Its
 narrator did something awful in his youth, then left home to lose 
himself as a cowboy,&nbsp;chasing wild horses&nbsp;in Montana for the 
Bureau of Land Management, sometimes shouting a lost love’s name to an 
empty echo. Its guitar-picking intro bears an odd, doubtless 
coincidental, resemblance to the Lady Gaga-Bradley Cooper 
hit&nbsp;“Shallow,”&nbsp;but its gathering impact comes from its 
expansive arrangement, which opens and deepens around his voice like an 
endless prairie.<br>
<br>
The arc of the album — Springsteen still treats an album as a whole — 
moves from hope to desperation to elegy. The album begins with “Hitch 
Hikin’,” whose footloose narrator easily gets ride after ride (including
 one from a “gear head in a souped-up ’72,” to pin down the era). Next 
is “Wayfarer,” proclaiming chronic wanderlust as strings, horns, 
glockenspiel, women’s voices and even castanets arrive to cheer him 
onward.<br>
But as usual for Springsteen, “Western Stars” doesn’t aim for comfort. 
Like his California-centered album from 1995,&nbsp;“The Ghost of Tom 
Joad,”&nbsp;its songs depict people who usually go unnoticed and who 
have little left to lose. The title song, “Western Stars,” is told by an
 aging actor — once a star of westerns — who is still working, picking 
up women and occasionally getting recognized: “Once I was shot by John 
Wayne,” he sings. “That one scene’s bought me a thousand drinks.”<br>
<br>
Many of the album’s characters are men trying to lose themselves in 
physical labor, to sweat out memories of a love that they failed to hold
 onto. “Hard work’ll clear your mind and body/The hard sun will burn out
 the pain,” Springsteen sings in “Tucson Train,” and that’s one of the 
few songs on the album that anticipates a happy ending. In “Drive Fast 
(The Stuntman),” amid keening strings that recall&nbsp;“Wichita 
Lineman,”&nbsp;the singer is a stuntman itemizing his broken bones and 
scars, reminiscing about a romance on a B movie set. And in “There Goes 
My Miracle,” there’s only the barest hint of a back story behind the 
loss: just an orchestral crescendo and a leaping melody, stately and 
bereft.<br>
<br>
By the end of the album, the possibilities of escape and renewal have 
long since faded away. “Hello Sunshine” is both the album’s first single
 and its summation. The sound is cozy: major chords, a light beat like a
 cruising train. But Springsteen sings about how empty the endless road 
ahead had become: “Miles to go is miles away,” he warns, and his refrain
 is actually a plea: “Hello sunshine, won’t you stay?” The rhythm guitar
 is a pleasant rustle, the pedal-steel guitar lends a golden glow and 
the strings are a warm bath. Yet as soothing as they are, they’re 
nowhere near enough to make things right.</div>
