Orange County Register, <br>
APRIL 4, 2008<br>
 by: Ben Wener</strong><br>
<br>
The mighty one dishes on what it's really like to power up the brotherhood that backs the Boss night after night.<br>
<br>
It's a tired question about the very idea of getting tired. But it came 
up in conversation with Max Weinberg quite naturally. While he chomped 
away at a late lunch after his flight from Vancouver touched down in Los
 Angeles, I suddenly found the oh-so-obvious query I'd ordinarily resist
 reflexively popping out. <br>
<br>
"Born to Run," "Badlands," "Rosalita," "Thunder Road" ? those 
indestructible giants of the Bruce Springsteen songbook, the ones that 
are rarely left off set lists, and thus will probably turn up again 
Monday and Tuesday when the Boss and the venerable E Street Band return 
to Honda Center for the first time in nearly eight years ? well, c'mon, 
doesn't Conan O'Brien's favorite bandleader ever get tired of playing 
them? <br>
<br>
"Nope." <br>
<br>
He responds before I even finish the question, like a guy who's been 
asked it a dozen times too many. But his resolve is so certain, so 
unwavering, it begs a bit of pressing. <br>
<br>
"Never happens?" <br>
<br>
"<strong class="text-strong">Never happens." </strong><br>
<br>
"You gotta be kidding. There has to be that one song ?" I figure the 
simplicity of "Dancing in the Dark" alone is enough to get even the 
Mighty Max daydreaming on autopilot some nights. <br>
<br>
"<strong class="text-strong">Not me. I take each one very separately. And if he wants to play 'em, I'm there to play 'em as best I can. </strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">"It's about staying in the moment,</strong>" he explains. <em class="text-italics">"I
 never make a judgment about what he wants to play. The only judgment I 
make about any song, whether it's for Bruce or on television, is to dig 
into it and get the most out of it every time. Most people would tell 
you I take a lot of things seriously ? but I definitely take 
thatseriously." </em><br>
<br>
That's the beauty of Weinberg: Like rock's best unassuming drummers ? 
Ringo Starr, Charlie Watts, the Attractions' Pete Thomas, session greats
 like Steve Gadd and Jim Keltner ? he serves the song, always, not his 
considerable chops. <br>
<br>
He also claims to have a "photographic memory," so to speak, of every 
Springsteen song he's ever played on ? so that when Bruce calls out an 
audible for, say, the "Born in the U.S.A." outtake "None but the Brave,"
 as he did Monday night in Vancouver for the first time this tour, 
Weinberg doesn't hesitate. Like the rest of the E Street Band, he knows 
he has to be fully prepared to pull anything out of his mental kit bag. <br>
<br>
"<em class="text-italics">He's really starting to mix it up a lot lately,</em>" Weinberg says of his, uh, boss ?<em class="text-italics">
 "our fearless leader," as he refers to him at one point. At all times, 
"You have to pay attention on stage, keep your eyes and ears open ? or 
you'll miss it." </em><br>
<br>
"It" being whatever Springsteen wants to serve up to satisfy his mood, or the audience's. "<em class="text-italics">That's key,</em>" Weinberg notes. <em class="text-italics">"Or, you know, the bus will leave without you. And that's always an unpleasant feeling." <br>
</em><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">A MEAN MACHINE </strong><br>
<br>
Not that there's much chance of that happening these days. 
Chrome-wheeled, fuel-injected and stepping out over the line night after
 night worldwide, the E Street Band remains a finely tuned machine ? 
even now, <strong class="text-strong">with organist Danny Federici taking a leave of absence to battle melanoma. "<em class="text-italics">He's on the injured reserve list,"</em>
 Weinberg says, happy to report that he turned up March 20 in 
Indianapolis to add accordion to the rarely played "4th of July, Asbury 
Park (Sandy)." </strong><br>
<br>
Many members, of course, are stars in their own right ? chief among them
 guitarists Nils Lofgren (late of Grin and plenty of noteworthy solo 
work) and Steven Van Zandt (aka Silvio Dante of "The Sopranos" and host 
of the widely admired weekly radio program "Little Steven's Underground 
Garage"). Patti Scialfa, also Mrs. Springsteen, has garnered acclaim for
 her own music, particularly last year's "Play It as It Lays." The big 
man on saxophone, Clarence Clemons ? he's virtually as recognizable on 
this Cadillac of rock 'n' roll bands as that car's hood ornament. <br>
<br>
Add in bassist Gary W. Tallent and, especially, the graceful touch of 
pianist Roy Bittan and you've got a unique, muscular, instantly 
identifiable sound from a legendary band that, after all these years, 
should have been properly credited on Springsteen's latest album, 
"Magic." "<em class="text-italics">I don't really know how to respond to that,"</em> Weinberg demurs when I suggest that<em class="text-italics">. "That's the way the albums have always been, even predating when I joined the band (in 1974)</em>." Besides, he adds, "<strong class="text-strong">Once people hear a record like this, they know.</strong>" <br>
<br>
They're "Blood Brothers," as the title of a 1996 documentary about the 
gang put it, despite the doubling of estrogen in recent years with the 
addition of violinist Soozie Tyrell. And blood brothers don't mind 
letting their linchpin get the glory. But here's another "duh" question:
 Does the camaraderie we fans see onstage year after year carry on 
offstage? Are they as tight as they seem? <br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">"Oh, absolutely</em>," Weinberg responds. Just a
 few nights before in Vancouver, for instance, Springsteen, 58, and 
Weinberg, who'll be 57 in a week, took their sons to see a new favorite,
 the excitably punctuated Florida band Against Me! "<em class="text-italics">Then they came to our sound-check the next day,"</em> Max murmurs between bites, "<em class="text-italics">and
 they said it was almost like we had a sixth sense among us. Especially 
when we're rehearsing, there's very little talking ? and then suddenly 
we're playing. That's how it is with us. <br>
</em><br>
"<em class="text-italics">We're all a lot older now, you know. We all 
have families and separate lives. But when we play together, we're like 
that same bunch of kids that started this all those years ago. These are
 bonds that have been created over a lifetime. What you see is what we 
are." </em><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">WAITING ON A FAVORITE </strong><br>
<br>
What you'll hear, however, and when ? well, that's up to no one but the Boss. <br>
<br>
I heard it said once that, with the Rolling Stones, though all eyes may 
be drawn first to Mick Jagger's rooster strut, the group's driving force
 has always been a matter of elusive chemistry, as it is with all great 
bands. Watts is always slightly ahead of the beat, Keith Richards 
slightly behind (naturally), Bill Wyman (or now Darryl Jones) holding it
 all down in the middle. That's a weird motor, to be sure ? but it's 
what makes the Stones the Stones. <br>
<br>
By comparison, Weinberg describes the E Street Band more like an 
arrowhead, all forces marshaled to support Springsteen at the piercing 
point. <br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">"We're still playing on the edge,</em>" he insists. "<em class="text-italics">We
 go out there and play hard ? like it's the last time we're ever gonna 
play. Every single night is extremely meaningful for all of us, and the 
audience ? that's why they keep coming back for more, I believe."</em> <br>
<br>
Sure, but let's be honest ? many of them keep coming back because they 
think this will be the night they finally hear "Jungleland" or "Sandy." 
"Thundercrack" ? that was the big surprise from this tour's first leg, 
though I recall going ape last year at the L.A. Sports Arena when Max 
started rattling his high-hat to kick off a not-nearly-as-rare "Candy's 
Room." <br>
<br>
What's been turning up lately? Several from "The River" ? "Sherry 
Darling," the chilling title tune and "Point Blank." "Because the 
Night." "Lost in the Flood." Even "Incident on 57th Street," and with 
some regularity. Writes one reader on my Soundcheck blog: "'Meeting 
across the River' on April 7 would make it the best show ever!!!" <br>
<br>
True, the era of four-hour Springsteen marathons is long past. These 
days shows clock in at about two hours and change ? "but I think in that
 period of time you get about five hours of music," Weinberg says, 
laughing. Included in that: most of "Magic," which makes this band one 
of few of stature to consistently play new works almost in their 
entirety. <br>
<br>
Such songs' placement in the set builds a skeleton for shows, which can 
give the impression that an E Street Band bash couldn't possibly be half
 as free-wheelin' as they were decades ago. Not so, Weinberg contends. 
Frameworks were employed way back when as well. <em class="text-italics">"Bruce has a particular set of ideas he wants to get across</em>," he explains, "<em class="text-italics">and we're sympathetic to what he wants to hear. But where we're headed each night is anyone's guess." <br>
</em><br>
The expectation, he says, "<em class="text-italics">if there is one that
 we carry with us, is not to live up to this idea of being Bruce 
Springsteen and the E Street Band. It's to live up to something Bruce 
said many years ago ? that we want to give people more than their 
money's worth." </em><br>
<br>
But how do you do that when the shows are shorter and the prices higher?
 Reasonable, yes, especially compared to what other Hall of Famers 
charge now. But still higher. <br>
<br>
"<em class="text-italics">Well, I think the point is, when you're buying
 a ticket ? whether it's for a movie or an extremely expensive Broadway 
show, or to see us ? are you moved by the experience? Have you been 
changed in some way? That's what we try to do every night ? come in to 
your town, play, change you ? and leave." </em><br>
<br>
He chuckled at that thought, but he means it seriously: "<em class="text-italics">On
 any given night, if you've spent your money and waited in line to see 
us, you know you're gonna see something that is a standard-bearer of 
striving toward excellence. You may not hear your favorite song. But if 
you go to enough concerts, you will."</em></div>

Pitchfork Review<br>
Sam Sodomsky<br>
<br>
At turns explosive and intimate, the three-hour-plus show performed at a
 small club in West Hollywood is a legendary document of how Bruce and 
the E Street Band could transform their songs on stage.<br>
Just over an hour into his marathon show at West Hollywood’s Roxy 
Theatre in the summer of 1978, Bruce Springsteen offers a confession: He
 doesn’t know how to fix a broken-down car. While this information might
 seem irrelevant to the night’s proceedings, it’s an important 
breakthrough in the action-packed group therapy session that is an E 
Street Band concert. After all, the man on stage—sprightly and 
clean-shaven, not yet 30, seemingly fueled entirely by adrenaline—had 
written nearly half his songabout cars: building and tearing them apart,
 driving till dawn and finding redemption underneath their hoods. (He 
was also dressing a little like a car mechanic around this time.) “But I
 think I understand,” he continues, “the spiritual and religious 
significance of the 396.” The crowd at the 500-capacity theater roars 
and Springsteen introduces “Racing in the Street,” a highlight from 
Darkness on the Edge of Town, released just a month earlier. On the 
record, it’s the bleakest thing he’s ever recorded; tonight, it becomes 
something else.<br>
<br>
The latest in Springsteen’s ongoing Live Archive Series marks the first 
official release of of this concert in its entirety. In the canon of 
historically significant Springsteen shows, the Roxy ’78 stands high 
above the others—above similarly beloved, equally inspired sets that 
year in Passaic, New Jersey or Houston, Texas. You don’t have to be a 
fanatic to find your footing. Here is a band in the midst of a  high, 
bold and electric and ready to face the world. The show was broadcast 
live, in full, on Los Angeles’ KMET FM, giving West Coast listeners a 
chance to experience the Jersey legend’s magic in real time. With its 
three-hour-plus length and uncontainable spirit, it became an instant 
favourite among among the tape-trading community. There was also an 
issue of scarcity, with a large portion of tickets relegated to radio 
station contests that barred fans from getting into the 
already-too-small venue. (Springsteen begins the show by apologizing, 
earnestly and shakily, to everyone who couldn’t get tickets, an 
important reminder that such controversies did not begin with 
Springsteen on Broadway)<br>
<br>
This night’s performance of “Racing in the Street” is a crucial document
 of how these musicians transform on stage. In 1978, the E Street Band 
doesn’t jam: None of the members are virtuosos, so their superpower is 
instead in their focus—seven people stretching songs into their most 
imposing, unrelenting forms. Saxophonist Clarence Clemons is often 
singled out as the primary foil for Springsteen’s songwriting during his
 peak era, but these performances remind you just how irreplaceable each
 band member had become. At this concert in particular, pianist Roy 
Bittan, who adds unearthly gravitas to songs like “Prove It All Night,” 
“Backstreets,” and the world premiere of “Point Blank,” is a revelation.
 As “Racing in the Street” draws to a close, he lends the song a 
spectral elegance while Clemons’ sax stutters for percussive effect and 
the whole band lifts effortlessly like a small plane taking flight. The 
effect causes one audience member to shout plainly, in the song’s final 
moments, “E. STREET. BAND.” It’s all that needs to be said.<br>
<br>
This is the type of show that converts the uninitiated, with definitive 
performances of some of Springsteen’s most immortal songs. Near the 
start, the band tears into my favorite performance of “Badlands,” one 
that runs proudly above tempo and ripples with defiant energy. Other 
songs forecast the darker shades his music would embrace. An ominous 
thunderclap of electric guitar introduces a pulverizing “Adam Raised a 
Cain.” The then-unreleased “Independence Day” is given a sparse piano 
rendition that furthers “Adam”’s father-son airing of grievances—a story
 that Springsteen was now just starting to see clearly—and offsets the 
ecstatic glee of oldies covers like “Twist and Shout” and “Rave On.”<br>
The show can also be heard as an accidental bildungsroman, summarizing 
the first half-decade of Springsteen’s career. If Darkness, his final 
release of the ’70s, was an achievement of solitude and refinement, then
 its tour was an extended celebration, establishing his reputation for 
performances that were at turns explosive and intimate. A stunning take 
on “Growin’ Up” embodies that dichotomy. The audience, who had been 
alternately howling and singing along and shouting requests, falls 
silent during the on-stage monologue that serves as its emotional core: a
 quaint tale of his childhood as he draws a line in the sand between his
 parents’ dreams and his own expectations. “What they didn’t 
understand,” Springsteen explains about his parents, “Was that I wanted 
everything.” Then he cues in the band, who give him precisely that.<br>

<br>
It has been called the House that Bruce built.<br>
<br>
So as I went about telling the oral history of the Stone Pony, the 
legendary rock club in Asbury Park, N.J., an interview with Bruce 
Springsteen was essential.<br>
<br>
Here’s the full transcript of what he said.<br>
<br>
NICK CORASANITI When was the first time you ever set foot in the Stone Pony?<br>
<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN Well, the Pony was Mrs. Jay’s, you know? And Mrs. 
Jay’s had that corner spot and then right next to it was a Mrs. J’s Beer
 Garden. And we were down the street in a club called the Student 
Prince, and at some point Mrs. Jay’s turned into the Stone Pony. I don’t
 remember when that happened. And I guess I went up there to see Steve 
[Van Zandt] and Southside Johnny because they actually started at the 
Pony. We started at the Student Prince. So I might have went up there to
 see them, or to see some local bands, local guys. And so they had a 
regular residence at the Pony, I think three nights a week, and so we 
used to all go and hang out there and play. That’s my recollection of 
when I started to go to the Pony — basically somewhere in 1975 or 1976 
or something<br>
<br>
CORASANITI The first time you went, did you hop onstage or jam a little bit?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN I don’t remember. You know, I don’t really remember. But I 
played with them pretty regularly. So, I’m not sure if the first time I 
went I played or not.<br>
<br>
It was a place where the local community musicians went.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI What was it about the Pony that made it a place you wanted to be at?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN Generally, what gave the place atmosphere was the bands that
 were playing. And I went just because my friends were playing there. 
And they made it conducive for you to come and stay and hang out. Jack 
[Roig] and Butch [Pielka] were running the place at the time, and they 
were just friendly bar owners and were glad to see you, and glad to have
 you playing there or sitting in. It was just a friendly place.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI I’ve read your book, and you talked a lot about the Upstage 
[music venue] and the kind of vibe that was created there and the 
ability to play with any kind of local artist and get up onstage, and 
that’s how you met some of your band members. Did it feel like after the
 Upstage closed, the Stone Pony was able to capture a little bit of that
 spirit and recreate it a little bit?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN Well, once the Upstage closed, we had the Student Prince for
 a while, and that was our band. I think Stevie might have played there 
with his band also and it was a locals place, the place the locals went.
 Generally playing what you want to play, you were still in hostile 
territory in those days. There weren’t many places you could go and play
 what you wanted to play. Most of them were Top 40 bars.<br>
<br>
So, the Student Prince was one of the few places you could do that at 
the time. And then the Pony came in and they were pretty open to the 
original bands, original local bands that came in and played, and then 
there were cover bands, too, that we played with all the time.<br>
<br>
And it became like a Wednesday, Saturday, Sunday thing, Friday, 
Saturday, Sunday. And depending on who was playing, there were a pretty 
decent amount of other local bands that played also, and I’d sit in with
 them, too, very often from time to time. So yeah, I guess it picked up 
that sort of locals thing. It was a place where the local community 
musicians went.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI You still felt a pretty deep connection to that?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN I was living in the same general area, and that was probably
 where I was living in the 1970s. In Long Branch or Atlantic Highlands 
or somewhere, so I was still very much a part of just the local scene 
and I hadn’t moved away or anything. So the success was just something 
that was there to navigate. But I still pretty much lived the way that 
I, you know, same circle of friends, and same hangouts. And the Pony 
made it comfortable for me to be there. It wasn’t too crazy. So it was 
pretty comfortable. It was all right.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI Do you have a favorite early memory or night of playing there, either one jam session or one show, that stands out?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN Not really. I generally enjoyed when Southside played, and 
Steve, because they’re exceptional. To see that band in a club was quite
 exceptional. They had the horn section, which not a lot of people had 
at the time. They had a really good selection of material that they 
played. They played a great selection of soul music and blues. And it 
was a very, very exceptional band to have in residence two or three 
nights a week in your clubs. So those were my favorite nights.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI Do you remember the big show, their record released in 1976, 
the one that was broadcast everywhere and kind of introduced the Pony to
 the world?<br>

<br>
SPRINGSTEEN Oh, for Southside you mean? Yeah, yeah. That was a nice night, you know? It was just a great, great night.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI Did it feel like after that like the world knew about the 
Stone Pony and you started to see a bigger crowd there? People started 
to come?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN Well, I don’t remember, because I went to the Pony from 
about the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s. That’s sort of the golden age of 
the original Pony, you know, original Stone Pony. It was about that 
decade, as far as I can remember. And so, yeah, people started to come. 
People would show up from a lot of different places during that period 
of time, but I don’t remember. It never became a tourist spot from my 
memory. The place maintained its original feeling and vibe for that 
whole period of time.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI I’ve seen some photos and heard so many stories about how it 
almost felt like a family. You guys would play pickup baseball.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN We would play the Stone Pony, which was always hilarious. 
The E Street Band had a team. It was pretty good. And we would play the 
Stone Pony and other bars in the area, and they were just great and a 
very, very funny game.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI Who was the best E Streeter?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN Well, Clarence [Clemons, the saxophonist for the E Street 
Band] could swing the bat, you know? It was as simple as that.<br>
<br>
<br>
CORASANITI As the Pony starts getting known a little bit more and then 
your albums are really taking off, did you start seeing people coming 
during that summer that you played a lot with? Bobby Bandiera and Cats 
on a Smooth Surface? Did you notice that there were people coming to see
 specifically you there?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN Well once again, the idea that you were playing pretty 
regularly on a Saturday or Sunday, yeah, people would show up. Funny 
thing is, I don’t remember it being that much of a problem or a hassle 
for me. I went regularly all through “Born in the U.S.A.” I mean, I saw 
Patti [Scialfa] before the “Born in the U.S.A.” tour, and that’s how she
 got in the band. So, it was a regular, it still was just a regular hang
 through that whole period of time.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI Right. Correct me if I’m wrong, is that where you met Patti?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN Yes, it is.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI Was she playing onstage? Do you remember that night?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN Yes. She came out and played onstage with, it might have 
been Bobby Bandiera or, I forget which local band was playing. But she 
came out and played the Exciters’ hit “Tell Him,” and she was very 
striking right from the beginning.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI I’m sure that voice just kind of carried through the Pony.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN Oh yeah.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI Was there something kind of unique about the set up there? 
I’ve seen a bunch of shows there, and the low-slung stage, the way the 
crowd’s kind of close, to me, it stands out in rock clubs in the way you
 develop a relationship with the artist on the stage. Did you get that 
sense?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN The Pony was laid out very strange. The stage didn’t project
 into the club long ways. It was kind of on the side of the club. And so
 there was a relatively small amount of people that could fit in there 
and really experience the band. You were close to everybody, and the 
ceiling was low, and it was a classic sort of rock club. You were close 
to the audience, very close to the audience.<br>
<br>
And there were other clubs in the area that we played where the stage 
was higher or set in a more logical place, but I suppose they didn’t end
 up having the same down-home atmosphere as the Pony had.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI Right. You mention it was always an easy vibe. Not much of a 
hassle. Were there back doors that you guys would enter in or ways you 
would kind of alert people?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN Yeah, you’d come in through the kitchen.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI I didn’t even know they had a kitchen.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN Well, they have a sort of a kitchen, you know? It’s sort of a
 kitchen, but you’d come in through the back door. They never had any 
real backstage space. I don’t think it still does. They have to put 
people in trailers or on a bus or something. There’s no real backstage 
area in the Pony.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI You can come through that door right next to the stage or hang out next to it.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN There was never any space for that.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI You mentioned the shows playing with Southside and Little 
Stevie early on. Do you remember any of those Cats shows from later on 
that really stick out in your head?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN All I remember is they were a particularly good Top 40 bar 
band. And they were there regularly, so we ended up playing with them 
pretty steadily.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI And playing in places like the Stone Pony regularly, did that influence your song writing or your music in any way?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN Not really. They were just a convenient place to go and hang
 with your friends and hear some local music when you were still at an 
age where bar hopping was interesting to you. So it was just a local, 
friendly, convenient place that had a good feeling to it, and I suppose 
at that time it kept me kind of locked into the area and the local music
 scene while I was having my initial shot of success.<br>
<br>
<br>
CORASANITI I think that was why so many people kept coming to to the Pony to see that.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN Yeah.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI So the other part of the story is also looking at Asbury Park
 and kind of how it was doing in relation to the Stone Pony. In that 
decade that you spoke of that was the real prime, how did you see the 
town doing? Was it struggling while the Pony was thriving?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN I would say at the time, 1975 to 1985, the town was kind of 
on the last of its blue collar legs. And it would really become very 
desperate shortly. But my recollection was the boardwalk was still open 
and there were amusements and rides, and that part of the town hadn’t 
shut down yet.<br>
<br>
But it was post the riots and so there was a noticeable closing down of a
 large part of the town in those days. So, it was just a little, 
hanging-on-by-a-thread, blue-collar beach town that happened to be our 
home.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI Did it ever feel unsafe at the Stone Pony or wandering around Asbury?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN Not that I recollect.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI Were you surprised when it first closed in 1991?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN Well, all things must pass. It was sort of the end of an era
 and all that. But the town was straining and changing. So it wasn’t a 
big shock.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI Was there ever a worry that the Pony might never come back?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN I don’t think anybody expected it initially to come back. So
 it was kind of a surprise, I suppose, when it did. And it was a 
pleasant surprise. You know it’s nice that it’s there, and I suppose 
it’s an attraction for people all over the world now. And they put on 
some pretty big shows, and they have their summer stage. It’s turned 
into a very nice thing.<br>
<br>
<br>
CORASANITI How important do you think the Pony was to the town of Asbury Park?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN Well, in the sense that it gave a home, once the Upstage 
closed, it gave a home to a local group of musicians who would, whose 
influence would be pretty far-reaching. I suppose it was important in 
that circumstance.<br>
<br>
And it ended up being a little bit of part of the mythology of the town 
and those particular years, and that became a small part of the story of
 Asbury Park and spread around the world. So, if anybody told me that 
somebody in Holland would ever even know the Stone Pony, I would have 
been shocked. I mean, at its height, it was really, it was just a 
neighborhood bar.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI Now you see Kenny Chesney wearing Stone Pony shirts on a world tour. So it certainly has that reach now.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN Well, it’s much more of a real venue now.<br>

<br>
CORASANITI What do you think of Asbury Park today? It’s kind of having this real resurgence.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN I’m very, very happy about it. It’s amazing to go down there
 and see everything thriving. Like I say in my book, I’m kind of the 
Ghost of Christmas Past. I can invisibly walk down the boardwalk and 
everybody is busy going about their own current business. So it’s nice. 
Bit of a surprise it didn’t happen sooner. I mean, it was a beautiful 
town only an hour out of the city. But things happen in their own time. 
And so it’s nice to see its resurgence.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI I wanted to just get back a little bit to those early days. 
There’s a question I forgot to ask. When you were playing those every 
Sundays, why was it that you just kept going to the Pony instead of 
another place?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN We did go to some other places. We were at the Green Parrot 
in Neptune, and they had original bands, and there were a few other 
places we went. We went to quite a few other bars during that period of 
time. But there wasn’t any place quite like the Pony. The Pony was our 
home away from home, and that was just the way it stayed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CORASANITI Was it the way that Jack and Butch kind of made it whatever you guys needed?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN They made the place conducive to the musicians that it 
served. But they were just bar owners, too, they were regular bar 
owners. They were funny guys, but once again they just built an 
atmosphere there that people were comfortable in.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI Yeah. Do you have any funny memories about Butch or Jack?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN Well, it’s hard to say exactly. You’d have to know the color
 of the place, but they were just sort of funny guys. There was a lot of
 local color in the place, but I don’t have a single anecdote.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI When you say local color though, what do you mean by that?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN It’s just the people. The people that came were really drawn
 from that area. And as such were eccentric in their own way. I think if
 you were living and breathing in Asbury Park at the time, you were a 
bit of an eccentric. So there were a lot of local musicians, a lot of 
funny people into their own thing. It was just a place that had its own 
personality. It was when localism was still very local, you know? 
[Laughs]<br>
<br>
But it was before the internet. So, it was before things had the 
potential to spread out through social media or anything. This is all 
pre-social media, so the message got sent the long way. But it was kind 
of a wonderful moment, looking back on it. Just that it was there.<br>
<br>
CORASANITI I know you’ve got a show tonight. Just one more question for 
you. The shows of playing with Southside that stick out, and Cats, I’m 
wondering if you can describe what it was like playing there? Looking 
out at the audience or a memory of a song that you played that had a 
particular resonance?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN The best way I could put it was just very every day. There 
was nothing uncommon going on there. I mean people look back and go, oh 
wow, Southside was playing there, Steve was there, I was there. But the 
regularness of it all was really what it was about. Three nights a week.
 Every week. There was nothing surprising going on. It was a very 
steady, comfortable environment.<br>
<br>
I’m sure it was like bar life in a thousand other towns going on 
simultaneously. There was that one club where your local musicians 
gathered and would get up onstage and play. I think the only thing that 
was exceptional about it was that it was unexceptional.<br>
<br>
Looking back on it, it was just a very down-home place where that group 
of musicians who inhabited Asbury Park at that moment could gather and 
be together and create, and very important in that sense, that there was
 a place. Because without the Pony, I don’t know, would there have been 
someplace else? Maybe. The Prince was for a little while, but you never 
know. So it was very important, in that sense.[/quote]</div>

<br>
<br>
By Chris Richards<br>
Washington Post<br>
September 14, 2012</strong></span><br>
<br>
R.C. “Tiny” Dawson is the first one lined up at the center field gate of
 Nationals Park on Friday night. He’s a towering man, a retired 
firefighter from Richmond who paid $98 to sit in Section 109 and sing 
along to the songs of Bruce Springsteen.<br>
Joining Dawson in that adoring choir of 38,000: a swell of lawmakers, 
lobbyists, consultants and media folk, their voices providing a 
subliminal psychic dissonance exclusive to Springsteen’s Washington 
gigs. Ours is the only city on Earth where you can hear the most 
mythologized musician of his time sing about America’s powerless to 
America’s powerful. And that’s sorta weird, right?<br>
<br>
Put your sacrilegious question to Washington’s wonks, and you’ll hear 
eyes roll over the phone. Then you’ll hear cascades of breathless praise
 for the Boss, followed by a tiny shard of logic that effortlessly 
slices your Gordian knot: People adore Springsteen, and politicians are 
people.<br>
<br>
<br>
And what’s your beef with the Boss, anyway? Whether he’s touring the 
Rust Belt, the Bible Belt, the Garden State or olde Europe, the man gets
 up there for three-plus hours and sweats his soul. He could be gouging 
us, but he keeps ticket prices fair, plus he looks ah-may-zing at 62 and
 still totally rocks, so what’s the problem, buddy? BRUUUUUCE!<br>
<br>
Hearing adulation like this can be intoxicating. Or terrifying. But it 
all speaks to the Herculean responsibilities we’ve heaped on poor Bruce 
in the past decade. Whenever a new Springsteen album lands, we expect it
 to embody our values, understand our struggles and illuminate our 
future. In other words, we expect Springsteen to do what we expect 
politicians to do, which is probably why so many politicians love 
Springsteen.<br>
<br>
Hey, Mary Hager, executive producer of “Face the Nation,” you love 
Springsteen. You have lawmakers on the show all the time. Ever meet one 
who actually dislikes the Boss?<br>
<br>
“Not anyone who’s willing to go on the record,” she says.<br>
<br>
Rocking out on high at the sold-out Nationals Park on Friday: Reps. 
Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) and Thomas J. Rooney (R-Fla.), who are holding 
campaign fundraisers in the stadium’s luxury suites — boxes that 
regularly cost between $3,000 and $8,500 a pop.<br>
These obviously aren’t the farmers and factory workers who populate 
Springsteen’s songbook. These are the officials elected to represent 
them. So do they relate to the little guy? Or do they relate to the 
charismatic millionaire onstage righteously sticking up for the little 
guy?<br>
<br>
Listen to the lyrics. “They’re about community, they’re about faith, 
they’re about work — values that folks in each party certainly use when 
they’re talking to voters,” says Doug Heye, deputy chief of staff for 
communications for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.).<br>
<br>
<br>
President Obama may have captured it best in a 2008 campaign-trail 
zinger: “The reason I’m running for president is because I can’t be 
Bruce Springsteen.”<br>
<br>
After the president wrapped up his acceptance speech at the Democratic 
National Convention in Charlotte last week, Springsteen’s recent single 
“We Take Care of Our Own” elbowed its way out of the speakers. 
(According to Billboard, digital sales of the song jumped 409 percent 
afterward.) Last weekend, more than 15 staffers from the Obama campaign 
went to hear Springsteen growl the song during his two-night stand at 
Chicago’s Wrigley Field. “Was an amazing show,” deputy campaign manager 
Stephanie Cutter writes in an e-mail. “Went both nights.”<br>
<br>
But Springsteen didn’t mention the president either night. He campaigned
 hard for Obama in 2008, but this election cycle, he’s sitting it out.<br>
<br>
“I don’t write for one side of the street,” he said in February at a 
news conference in Paris. “But the Bush years were so horrific you could
 not just sit around. It was such a blatant disaster. I campaigned for 
Kerry and Obama, and I am glad I did. But normally I would prefer to 
stay on the sidelines. The artist is supposed to be the canary in the 
cage.”<br>
<br>
David Wade, chief of staff for Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), helped 
spring the bird from the cage in 2004 during Kerry’s run for the White 
House. Wade remembers campaign rallies in Ohio, Florida and Wisconsin 
where Springsteen’s performances juiced up the crowds and the candidate.
 (The senator had to skip Friday’s concert for a Saturday morning 
funeral, but Wade says Kerry prefers seeing the Boss in Boston, anyway. 
“It’s not as much of the D.C. scene.”)<br>
<br>
Now Springsteen shows are crawling with politicians. “It kind of became 
cool in Democratic circles to be a Springsteen guy,” Luke Russert of NBC
 News says. “They can appear cool, they can appear youthful . . . like 
they’re in tune with all classes.”<br>
<br>
<br>
That cool extends into the media-verse, too. “Personally, it’s always 
been [Springsteen’s] message about the space between the American dream 
and the American reality,” says Russert, who’s sitting in Section 116 on
 Friday. “I think for journalists, there’s an appeal there. You have 
guys like David Brooks, Ron Brownstein and Andrea Mitchell all citing 
their love of Bruce.”<br>
<br>
In a June New York Times column, Brooks wrote about a flight he booked 
to Europe to tail the E Street Band around Spain and France. Once there,
 he was puzzled by the maniac fervor of Springsteen’s Euro fans — “Did 
it occur to them at that moment that, in fact, they were not born in the
 U.S.A.?” — but concluded that they connected with Springsteen’s faraway
 New Jersey the way a reader would connect with the setting of their 
favorite novel. In closing, the columnist advised politicians to take a 
cue from the Boss and keep it real: “Don’t try to be everyman. Don’t 
pretend you’re a member of every community you visit. Don’t try to be 
citizens of some artificial globalized community. Go deeper into your 
own tradition.”<br>
<br>
Okay, sure. But Brooks’s takeaway is emblematic of the weird and 
impossible roles we’ve assigned Springsteen. He speaks for Americans but
 especially himself and, most important, me. When Chris Christie, the 
Republican governor of New Jersey whose Springsteen superfandom was 
recently chronicled in the Atlantic, heard “We Take Care of Our Own” at 
Newark’s Prudential Center in May, was it the same “We Take Care of Our 
Own” that Kerry heard at Fenway Park in August?<br>
<br>
When Springsteen spelunks that chasm between the American reality and 
the American dream, he’s venturing into the gap where politicians wage 
war. They promise voters they’ll seal it. They try to build suspension 
bridges across it. They want to give it a tax cut, or universal health 
care, or maybe they’ll just filibuster so we can all live in it forever.<br>
<br>
So Springsteen tells Washington what it wants to hear.<br>
<br>
“Equality, fairness, helping out your fellow man . . . there’s an awful 
lot of that in Bruce’s music. It’s a sentiment that appeals to the 
better angels in all of us,” says Dick Keil, a communications consultant
 at the bipartisan firm Purple Strategies who has tickets on the field.<br>
<br>
Then Springsteen tells Washington what it doesn’t want to hear.<br>
“He also says a lot more about the limits of the American dream than 
most politicians are willing to,” says fellow ticket-holder Jim Jordan, a
 colleague of Keil’s at Purple Strategies who also founded the Thunder 
Road Group, a PR firm named after a Springsteen tune. “It’s a lot easier
 to talk about American exceptionalism than the built-in limits of our 
dreams.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen strides onto that center field stage Friday night and, 
within a few songs, looks as if he’s just emerged from a carwash. As the
 sweat drizzles, endorphins spill across the stands, across the aisle. 
Fans reach to paw at his sopping limbs. One hands him a pizza box 
containing a jumbo slice. Pepperoni. He takes a bite.<br>
The good times are still gushing at 11 p.m. — it’s not over yet — and 
without a word about the election, anyone can hear the Springsteen they 
want to hear</div>

<br>
<br>
<br>
By Joe Heim<br>
Special to The Washington Post <br>
Monday, May 16, 2005</strong><br>
<br>
Turn off those damn cell phones. That was the first item of business for
 Bruce Springsteen before playing a single note at a sold-out Patriot 
Center Saturday night. "If I hear one of those idiotic jingles, I'll 
sweep the audience with my chain saw," he said with a chuckle. "I don't 
want to decapitate any lobbyists or senators." No clapping along either,
 he told the crowd of 7,000 or so: It would destroy his "already 
tenuous" sense of rhythm.<br>
<br>
After establishing Bruce's Rules of Order for the solo acoustic evening,
 the 55-year-old rock giant began with "My Beautiful Reward," an 
anguished song about searching for meaning when life's ephemeral 
offerings disappear or fail to deliver on their promises. That theme 
dominated the stripped-down, 2 1/2 hour, 25-song performance. And it was
 a theme he explored in his between-song comments as well.<br>
<br>
Drawing heavily from his new album, "Devils &amp; Dust," Springsteen 
traversed minefields of doubt and belief, anger and forgiveness, 
suffering and hope. As he sang the new album's title track through 
gritted teeth, his words sounded dark and cautionary: "We've got God on 
our side / We're just trying to survive / What if what you do to survive
 / Kills the things you love." On another new song, "The Hitter," he 
related a harrowing tale of a son beseeching his mother for a temporary 
reprieve from a life gone far off course.<br>
<br>
In addition to the new songs, Springsteen performed "The River" on piano
 and some radically reworked older material, including the grim and 
rarely played "Wreck on the Highway" and a version of the heroic anthem 
"Promised Land" that was slowed to a muttered crawl. "Reason to Believe"
 from 1982's "Nebraska" was recast as some sort of foot-stomping, 
Gothic, Delta blues exorcism. The rendition, sung through a tricked-up 
microphone and accompanied only by Springsteen's howling-cat harmonica, 
was so incomprehensible that even the signer for the hearing-impaired 
sat that one out.<br>
<br>
A supporter of John Kerry in last year's presidential election, the Boss
 didn't back off on the political front. He took President Bush to task 
for his stance on evolution in a humorous intro to "Part Man, Part 
Monkey." Later, in his prelude to "Matamoros Banks," a song about the 
death of a Mexican migrant worker that could be a 21st-century version 
of Woody Guthrie's "Deportees," Springsteen said, "We don't really need 
vigilantes along the border. What we need is a humane immigration 
policy." Lou Dobbs might want to book him as a guest.<br>
<br>
As antidote to the evening's more somber fare, Springsteen offered the 
joyful "Long Time Comin'," a celebration of coming to terms with 
fatherhood that he introduced by saying, "I'm just happy to be viewed as
 a tolerable idiot by my kids."<br>
<br>
Before playing another life-affirming song, "Leah," Springsteen talked 
about choices people need to make in a world where temptation and lures 
are set in front of them like "giant mousetraps." "You've gotta have 
faith," he advised, "and come down on the right side of the equation." 
It was a point reinforced by the concert's beautiful conclusion, "Dream 
Baby Dream," a reworked song of the same name by the obscure synth band 
Suicide. "I wanna see you smile / I just wanna see you smile," 
Springsteen sang, repeating the line over and over until it felt like 
some sort of spiritual incantation. Faced with the choices, he comes 
down on the right side, offering himself, and his fans, reasons to 
believe.</div>

<br>
By JOHN ROCKWELL<br>
<br>
January 21, 1973, Page 28<br>
The New York Times<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
AMERICA is still a land of loners, for all the homogenization of the 
plastic culture and the retribalization of the electronic culture. And 
nowhere do those loners breed more tenaciously than in the field of 
folk‐pop. The hills—and the cities, too—are full of wandering minstrels,
 itinerant instrumentalists and allpurpose musical eccentrics. College 
campuses, at least on warm days, are full of them, picking and wailing 
in a variety of more or less authentic indigenous idioms. They glorify 
the land and its people in a way that might give great comfort to Mr. 
Nixon, if only he and the other politicians full of rhetoric about 
“bringing us together” could get past the pervasive antiestablishment 
sentiments of their songs.<br>
<br>
Bob Dylan has been the best‐known example of the species in recent 
years, of course, and it was he more than any other who effected the 
fusion between hopelessly noncommercial folkies and the big, glittering 
world of pop‐music success. Nowadays, the monthly record lists are 
glutted with singersongwriters who have broken away from bands, or who 
never associated themselves with them in the first place. Jumbling a 
thousand regional styles, backed sometimes by downright luxurious 
arangements and often reared in the very cradle of upperclass urban 
comfort, they remain folk poets nonetheless. And sometimes, they manage 
miraculously to avoid the Self‐consciousness one might think inherent in
 their status.<br>
<br>
Occasionally, after a dose of concentrated listening, they become a 
little hard to tell apart, all these determinedly American Bills and 
Bobs and Johns and Kens. And, in fact, poetic originality seems a little
 easier to come by than musical. Again Dylan is, She model. For all the 
sometimes extravagant invention of his verse, his music remained 
comfortably mundane, a few most notable exceptions aside. Towards the 
end of his career (I speak as if it's over, which may be a bit 
premature) he was turning out songs of an almost defiantly prosaic 
musical content. But at the very end, after he had gotten his voice back
 into some kind of shape, he made a deliberate effort to revitalize his 
country roots, and those are in fact the same roots that most of today's
 musical folk‐poets Chicago‐born John Prine is es fine a representative 
of the genre as we have today. Diamonds in the Rough (Atlantic SD 7240) 
is his second record and second albums are often disappointing if the 
first has been a success. In Prine's case the first most definitely was a
 success, at least critically, and the second—while perhaps not quite so
 consistently appealing, is nonetheless a most attractive album indeed.<br>
<br>
Prine is firmly in the Woody Guthrie/Dylan tradition of the populist 
protestor. He deals straightforwardly with such issues as drugs and 
Vietnam, and he does so within a ruddily rudimentary, Kentucky‐country 
idiom. The music itself is four‐square, short‐phrased ballad stuff, 
plunked out functionally on Prine's acoustic guitar and backed by an 
always discreet, never slick set of sidemen.<br>
<br>
Prine's baritone is hoarse and limited, but, he shapes his vocal lines 
with a nice conviction, and there is at least an easy resonance at the 
bottom end. In all, the music is certainly an acceptable conveyor of his
 poetic message, and often rather more than that; Prine works securely 
within tradition, which is as much a strength as it is a limitation, but
 he does show a good deal of short‐range originality within that 
context.<br>
<br>
But it is as a musical poet that Prine owes his reputation. The topical 
material is certainly effective — “Robert the sailor” comes home from 
Vietnam, asks his parents to “Take the star out of the window/And let my
 conscience take a rest”; and he then “made an Oriental waitress/His own
 home comin queen.” Yet what makes Prine so appealing is the depth and 
breadth of his concerns. There are humorous songs, love‐lost songs, 
harddrinking songs, wanderlust songs, and songs that neatly cross over 
several categories at once.<br>
<br>
Above all it is his poetic imagination and metaphorical suggestiveness 
that enrich his work: “Now he loved every girl/In this curly headed 
world”; “The waitress yelled at me/And so did the food”; “I knew a girl 
who was almost a lady/She had way with all the men in her life/Every 
inch of her blossomed in beauty/And she was born on the fourth of July.”<br>
<br>
John Fahey is something of an instrumental equivalent to Prine; he is 
certainly as talented, and if anything even more idiosyncratic. Fahey is
 an acoustic guitarist, and a masterful one. He works from a blues base,
 but he combines an extraordinarily diverse blend of influences and 
personal passions into his own, unique style, above all a background in 
classical, music and a scholarly concern with blues giants (he holds a 
Masters from UCLA, with thesis on Charley Patton).<br>
<br>
Fahey has had a varied career, from Takoma Park, Md., where he was born,
 to Berkeley to Venice (Calif.) to various excursions into the South. 
His first record came out on his own obscure Takoma label in 1958, and 
was followed by ten others on that label, records that won an 
increasingly enthusiastic underground reputation. Now he has appeared 
for the first time on a major label, and the album, Of Rivers and 
Religion (Reprise MS 2089) should bring his artistry to a wider audience
 at last.<br>
<br>
The record is billed as “A Takoma Production” and it is characteristic 
of his work (the so‐called “orchestra” of the jacket consists of a few 
deferential accompanists). The influences here are predominantly 
river‐boat blues, but Fahey's personal style shines easily through. He 
plays—always with impeccably clean, full‐toned security — in a 
predominantly slow, comfortable tempo, arpeggiated chords strung out 
repetitively, each song stretched, for all its rhythmical allure, into a
 timeless continuum. Fahey's music is “head music,” no doubt about it, 
but it can most definitely be enjoyed without dope, just as the best of 
most any specialized art can be appreciated by a more general public.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen's debut album, Greetings 
from Asbury Park, N. J. (Columbia KC 31903) is full of urban experience,
 despite the country flavor of its musical idiom. Springsteen sometimes 
sounds like a curious cross between Van Morrison's upbeat 
fraternity‐party enthusiasm and a bit of Rod Stewart's hoarse rock 
fervor. His music has an attractively driving infectiousness about it, 
particularly the fast numbers. But once again it is the words that 
distinguish him, for better or, perhaps, for worse.<br>
</strong><br>
If Prine comes over as an American‐rural Dylan Thomas, Springsteen is a 
latterday Allen Ginsberg, and more particularly the Ginsberg of “Howl,” 
with its high‐pressure, crazily juxtaposed rushes of poetic imagery. Bob
 Dylan's verse once more comes to mind, but the sensibility here is a 
more deliberately bizarre one, ever so slightly impressed with its own 
wickedness. If you loved “El Topo,” if teenage rhapsodizing does it for 
you, then this record may turn you on. Even so you still might like it.<br>
<br>
J. J. Cale comes from Oklahoma, and anybody who enjoys Leon Russell will
 prob ably find Cale's Really (Shelter WW 8912) attractive. Songwriters 
are not always ideally persuasive interpreters of their own material; 
Cale has had success as a songwriter for others, but comes over here as a
 suggestively gutsy singer with tight, unfussy arrangements.<br>
<br>
Kenny Rankin and Eric Justin Kaz are both from New York. Kaz has had a 
good deal of success as a songwriter, and Tracy Nelson and Bonnie Raitt,
 both of whom have recorded his songs, appear in background roles on his
 If You're Lonely (Atlantic SD 7246). Kaz sings with some style, albeit 
in pleasantly unimpressive baritone, and his songs are unquestionably 
good ones. But this record doesn't really convince one that he shouldn't
 leave the performing to others.<br>
<br>
Rankin enjoyed a good deal of success before he succumbed to speed. He 
has now reemerged, thanks to Phoenix House, a drug rehabilitation 
community, and his Like a Seed (Little David LD 1003) marks his return 
to public life. Rankin is a lyrical pop tenor, and his work recalls both
 James Taylor and Crosby, Stills and Nash. It will undoubtedly appeal to
 some who like soft, polished rock; others will find it derivative, for 
all its wellmeaning sincerity of purpose</div>

By&nbsp;BRUCE POLLOCK<br>
DEC. 16, 1973<br>
<br>
NEW YORK TIMES</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
WHEN Bruce Springsteen's first Columbia album, “Greetings From Asbury 
Park,” came out almost a year ago, it was met with the most extravagant 
and outrageous praise I've ever encountered in the Rock Press. Reviewers
 compared him to Bob Dylan, The Band, Van Morrison, Allen Ginsberg, Jack
 Kerouac, El Topo, Webster's New World Dictionary. If superlatives were a
 dime a dozen, Springsteen could have retired then and there.<br>
<br>
Because of the amazing way he broke from the gate, even his most avid 
fans wondered how he could possibly sustain the pace. He'd never be able
 to follow his own act! Meanwhile, the cynical suspected a paper legend 
that would come apart at the first drop of split milk. Springsteen would
 have to do it again before they would believe.<br>
*<br>
Now, after five solid months of dedicated labor, that second piece of 
work is here — The Wild, The Innocent &amp; The E Street Shuffle 
(Columbia KC 32432) — and in an era of diminishing returns, false 
prophets and false bottoms, where the best of our instant pop‐up 
superstars are either choked‐off, laid‐back, lame or laid out flat, it 
is with a great sense of relief that I announce to the disbelievers that
 Bruce Springsteen has delivered another stone, howling, joyous monster 
of a record. Of course the fanatics knew the issue was never really in 
doubt.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is a word virtuoso, who uses language the way his band‐mate 
Clarence Clemons plays the sax: tough, fast and funky, sometimes 
frivolous, often devastating. His lyrics are intuitive, emotional, a 
mass of flung images that spin toward you from all directions and 
somehow hang on a canvas—great swatches of local color that blend into a
 landscape of remembered adolescent scenes and dreams in the swamps and 
seasides of Jersey, in the slums of New York.<br>
<br>
In a time when everyone else is leaving the city for greener pastures, 
Springsteen celebrates street life, rendering it completely imagined, 
with places and names—Crazy Janey, Wild Billy, Rosalita. His vision is 
absolutely authentic; there's no doubting that he lives in that world of
 hoods and hitters, sinners, studs and saints. He is Jersey's Hubert 
Selby only younger and less defeated by life.<br>
<br>
<br>
But the true gift of the album is the music. The Springsteen Six — 
Clarence Clemons on sax, Danny Federici on organ and accordion, Gary 
Tallent on bass and tuba, Vinnie Lopez on drums and David Sancious on 
piano and Bruce on guitar—can play anything from a circus march to a 
classical dirge, often within the borders of the same piece. The album 
is a mad excursion from rhythm and blues edged in jazz to rock and roll 
touched with folk and funk; it swings like crazy, it drives home the 
torrent of his words to perfection. Each piece (you can't really call 
them “songs”) is a world in itself, any one alone worth the price of the
 album.<br>
<br>
In “The Wild, The Innocent &amp; The E Street Shuffle” we start out by 
doing “The E Street Shuffle,” which takes place on the updated West Side
 of the Jets and the Sharks, in a speedy r&amp;b tempo. From there it's 
over to Asbury Park to visit Sandy and to experience the carnival 
summertime, penny arcade life on and below the boardwalk. “Kitty's 
Back,” is a street scene reminiscent of Kerouac's be‐bop prosody, the 
endless sad jazz night of America, done in miniature by Springsteen's 
crew of romantic loners and losers. “Wild Billy's Circus Story” is an 
incredible work which ends the side—a contemporary vision of a traveling
 tent show . . .“God save the human cannonball. . .”<br>
<br>
“Incident on 57th Street” and “New York City Serenade” again take place 
in the bowels of Manhattan, and both sizzle like Eighth Avenue in 
August. Here are images of hustlers in leather jackets, huddled against 
the wind, cigarettes flickering in the violent night, and their dungaree
 molls, Crazy Janey, Diamond Jackie. <br>
<br>
“Rosalita,” which occurs between those two creations, is a wild, 
brawling bash, a precise and exuberant picture of teenage romance in the
 seventies. Springsteen's cast of characters, including himself, are 
easy to know and to like. They are determined to win you over and they 
will, and so will the album.<br>
<br>
The selections are neither too long nor too loud, have none of the 
excesses Springsteen has been known to sometimes display live. In fact, 
the album leaves you wishing it would go on forever. Every time 
Springsteen comes to town, all his friends flock to see him. This album 
should increase their number immeasurably.<br>
Can you imagine what his third album will be like?</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">HYPE AND SPRINGSTEEN-<br>
The Pop Life<br>
By JOHN ROCKWELL<br>
October 24, 1975, Page 34<br>
The New York Times </strong><br>
<br>
The air is thick these days with talk of “hype.” Hype is the 
music‐industry term for promotion, and it has two rough meanings. One is
 any sort of public enthusiasm that can be used to promote an artist's 
career. The other is the specific effort on the part of an artist's 
backers to engender that enthusiasm.<br>
<br>
Hype is a topic of current discussion because of the extraordinary 
attention being paid to Bruce Springsteen. Those who don't like his 
music have sometimes taken the position that all the enthusiasm for him 
is either hype or a result of hype.<br>
<br>
If one writes favorably about Mr. Springsteen, one's words can be picked
 up and used in advertisements. If other publications are swayed by a 
review, then the review becomes part of a process that leads to another 
piece. Even pieces that decry hype are themselves hype in this sense, 
especially if they are prominently displayed on the cover of a national 
magazine.<br>
<br>
But the hint behind the hype talk is that the enthusiasm isn't honest, 
and at that point the infighting among Mr. Springsteen's fans and foes 
begins to get a little dirty. Either the enthusiast doesn't really like 
Mr. Springsteen all that much, but is swept along by the herdlike 
enthusiasms of others. Or he is actually in the pay of Mr. Springsteen's
 backers.<br>
<br>
Any time anybody doesn't like something that is popular, the temptation 
is to attribute the success to sinister machinations. Lovers of oldtime 
adult pop liked (and still like) to think of all rock ‘n’ roll as a plot
 on the youth of America. And today, with a “return to melody” and the 
re‐emergence of late‐fifties and early‐sixties pop veterans onto the 
charts again, the old antirockers can disguise their distaste as the 
latest thing.<br>
<br>
But the fact remains that nearly all the people who have written 
enthusiastically about Mr. Springsteen have done co simply because they 
love his music. Maybe they are all backward‐looking rock nostalgists; 
the idea seems misguided, but at least it is legitimate argument to 
make.<br>
What they surely are not however, are mindless v:ctirns of an 
unprecedented promotional ‐campaign or hype. by Columbia Records. 
Columbia denies that it spent any more money on Mr. Springsteen's “Born 
to Run” album than en those of several other of its major artists. And 
in any event, rock writers are a fairly cynical breed when it comes to 
such hype: The number of artists who have disappeared ignominiously on 
Columbia and other labels, can attest to that cynicism.<br>
<br>
At this point, the enthusiasm for Mr. Springsteen has reached such a 
point that one does have to worry about a backlash. But ultimately, Mr. 
Springsteen's future depends on what it has always depended on: his own 
ability to withstand the pressures of success and his own ability to 
keep on writing songs of the same quality he's written so far. If he can
 do that, he'll stop being a “hype” and start being a legend instead. 
There are still plenty of pennle around who don't like Bob Dylan, but 
you don't har much talk about hype him.<br>
•<br>
Another artist Columbia is busily hyping is David Essex, who made his 
formal American debut last night at the Bottom Line. Earlier this week 
in his hotel suite, Mr. Essex seemed remarkably seraphic about cracking 
the American market—a market that has become increasingly difficult for 
British stars to win over ever since the craze for British acts in the 
postBeatles nineteen‐sixties.<br>
<br>
“I'll do it in a gentle way,” he said, smiling faintly and sleepily. “If
 they don't like it at the Bottom Line—well, maybe we won't come back 
again. Some people come from England and expect to be big in America 
automatically.”<br>
•<br>
There will be a new Dylan record to coincide with the singer's 
forthcoming tour after all—a tour Mr. Dylan's people are still being 
nervously secretive about, but that continues to be planned. Columbia 
will next week release Mr. Dylan's song about Rubin (Hurricane) Carter, 
the imprisoned boxer.</div>

By JOHN ROCKWELL<br>
August 29, 1975, Page 11<br>
The New York Times </strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen's third album, “Born to Run,” should be in the record 
stores about now and it should be all he needs to push him over the top.<br>
<br>
The trouble with Mr. Springsteen's career, as anyone who has followed 
rock music at all recently already knows, is that his records haven't 
matched the astonishing impact of his live performances.<br>
The first record, which came out in late 1972, was called “Greetings 
From Asbury Park, N. J.” It's an inconsistent disk, which Mr. 
Springsteen attributes to the fact that Columbia Records thought of him 
as a conventional singer‐songwriter and thus blunted the rock impact of 
his style. Even so, with memories of his live performances fresh in 
one's ears, the best songs (“Growin Up” and “Spirit in the Night,” for 
instance) work wonderfully well.<br>
<br>
The second album came out a year later and was entitled “The Wild, the 
Innocent and the E Street Shuffle.” This is really a great record 
already, but it's not quite as consistently fine or as consistently 
rock‐oriented as the third. However winning the songs sound, they really
 function as rough models for the fully formed versions one hears live.<br>
•<br>
“Born to Run” gets us closer still to what Bruce Springsteen is all 
about. The range is as wide as either of the earlier albums, from 
poignancy to street‐strutting cockiness to punk poetry to quasi‐Broadway
 to surging rock anthems. But all of it (except “Meeting Across the 
River,” which works superbly on its own terms) is solidly rock ‘n’ roll.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen's gifts are so powerful and so diverse that it's 
difficult even to try to describe them in a short space. Sometimes his 
lyrics still lapse too close to selfconscious myth making but generally 
they epitomize urban folk poetry at its best—overflowing with pungent 
detail and evocative metaphors, but never tied to their sources in a way
 that is binding. This is poetry that attains universality through the 
very sureness of its concrete imagery. And Mr. Springsteen's themes 
perfectly summarize the rock experience, full of cars and love, street 
macho and desperate aspiration. Hearing these songs is like hearing your
 own life in music, even if you never lived in New Jersey or made love 
under the boardwalk in Asbury Park.<br>
•<br>
In the first album the music seemed secondary to the words, but in 
retrospect that seems largely a matter of production. Mr. Springsteen's 
music is both a compendium of rock influences and absolutely personal. 
He uses lots of inexorably building repetition, and that was what 
sounded a little bland on the first album. But properly mixed, as the 
second and especially the third albums have been, the repetition becomes
 overwhelming.<br>
<br>
And the tunes, the hoarse, fervent singing, the arrangements and their 
instrumental execution and above all the sheer feeling for what rock is 
about simply pour out of the speakers. Mr. Springsteen's music is 
astonishing for many things, perhaps most immediately for its exultant 
rhythmic energy. In live performance especially, however, he constructs 
symphonic set pieces out of his songs, knitting together dramatic and 
musical ideas that amount to a tapestry of American imagery and popular 
music.<br>
At any given moment the sound stays true to its essential simplicity and
 directness, even if the textures can approach almost orchestral 
richness. But the real diversity lies in the many different sorts of 
popular music that he and his wonderful E Street Band can do so well.<br>
•<br>
The only nagging question is how this new record is going to sound out 
in the heartland, where people may have never heard of Bruce 
Springsteen, or, worse, may think of him as some overhyped Easterner.<br>
<br>
All this observer can say is that on repeated hearings and after seeing 
him perform again this summer, “Born to Run” seems one of the great 
records of recent years. If Mr. Springsteen has to perform more to get 
his message across, let him perform away—he seems to enjoy it enough. 
We're still waiting for the live (double?) album from him that should 
justify the whole notion of live albums. No doubt he will make still 
greater studio albums than this someday. But in the meantime, you owe it
 to yourself to buy this record.</div>

				<div class="content">The Rocky Road to Rock Stardom<br>
By JOHN ROCKWELL<br>
August 15, 1975, Page 37<br>
The New York Times <br>
<br>
It was as if Mick Jagger had decided to play in a 400seat club. The 
sidewalks of Mercer and Fourth Streets surrounding the Bottom Line 
Wednesday night were alive with restless rock fans, some herded into 
lines and some milling excitedly about. The cause of all the turmoil was
 a man who might just be the next Mr. Jagger, a 25year‐oid rock ‘n’ roll
 poet from New Jersey named Bruce Springsteen. And as his earlier 
performances here had led one expect, he gave two shows Wednesday that 
will rank among the great rock experiences of those luck/ enough to get 
in. Mr. Springsteen has it all—he is a great lyricist and songwriter, he
 is a wonderful singer, guitarist and piano player, lie has one of the 
best rock bands anybody has ever heard, and he is as charismatic a stage
 figure rock has produced.<br>
<br>
Playing for 10 Years<br>
<br>
And yet there has been something strange and unsure about Mr. 
Springsteen's career so far. He has been playing publicly for 10 years 
and he has had a record contract for three. Why hasn't he become an 
internationally known superstar long since, if he's as good everybdy who
 sees him knows him to be?<br>
The answer to that question turns out to be instructive not only about him, but about the whole process rock stardom.<br>
<br>
Successful rock careers follow a generally predictable pattern. A young 
artist gathers experience playing in his home town. Eventually he finds a
 manager and wins recording contract. With record‐company support, 
records an album that is promoted at radio stations around the country. 
In conjunction with tours and favorable recepion in the press, the album
 begins to be heard more and more on the radio, and sales pick up.<br>
<br>
Tours are important both to gain exposure for the artist and to support 
an album just as it goes on sale. Young artists typically begin in 
clubs, then move on to serve as opening acts for established stars in 
big halls, then drop back down to 3.000‐seat facilities in cities and on
 college campuses, and then finally work their way up to the 
superstardom of indoor sports arenas (like Madison Square Garden) and 
even outdoor stadiums.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen's career has followed that pattern but in a very rough, 
erratic and drawn‐out way. If he finally breaks into massive stardom in 
the next few months—as everyone associated with him predicts he will—the
 controversies will continue as to whether he could have been a star 
sooner than this or whether his stardom will have a special genuineness 
for having been won without compromise. Mr. Springsteen —the_name is 
Dutch—was born and raised in Freehold, N.J., and his whole identity 
derives from a youth spent in New Jersey coastal towns and shuttling in 
and out of Manhattan.<br>
<br>
When he was in his midteert, his parents moved to California—his father 
is now a bus driver in San Mateo, south of San Francisco—and Mr. 
Springsteen was left pretty much on his own. He went to high school in 
Freehold and tried college for a short while, but for the last 10 years 
his life has really been defined by rock music.<br>
<br>
Not only did he organize a whole series of New Jersey bands with names 
like Child, Steel Mill and Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom, but he also kept
 cropping up in Greenwich Village spots like the Cafe Wha? and Max's 
Kansas City as a solo artist. To this day, he has tapes showing his 
proficiency in almost every popular form of nineteen‐sixties rock‐pop, 
from folk to electric blues to heavy metal.<br>
<br>
In 1972, having acquired the services of one Mike Appel as his manager, 
he made contact with a producer at Columbia Records, John Hammond, who 
had introduced Bob Dylan to the label. He was signed by Clive Davis, 
then president of Columbia, and his first album—“Greetings from Asbury 
Park, N. J.” was released in late 1972.<br>
But at this point the normal career machine began to sputter. The album 
received mixed notices and fared hesitantly on the market. Confronted 
with an apparent failure and with Mr. Davis—who had backed him 
extravagantly—ousted from Columbia and under a cloud, the next album 
received far less attention than it deserved.<br>
Mr. Springsteen, discouraged over these setbacks, turned his attentions 
to his live performances, building up his present band and performing 
here and there throughout the country throughout 1974. The performances 
were enormously successful, winning him cult followings in most of the 
cities and college towns. Sales on the first two albums continued 
steadily if unspectacularly — the two have even made it back onto the 
upper reaches of the sales charts Flow.<br>
<br>
But success in rock is measured ultimately by record a sales, and so 
everybody was waiting for the next Springsteen album, the one that would
 make him a star, And Mr. Springsteen was hung up in the studio, 
selfconsciously trying to create that album and risking a loss of 
momentum in his live‐performance career as he struggled away.<br>
There are all sorts of explanations for why Mr. Springsteen hasn't made 
it yet to superstardom. One is the simple profusion of his own gifts. 
Mr. Springsteen can do anything he chooses in rock music, and it has 
sometimes been difficult for him to decide what that should be. As Jon 
Landau—who quit his job as recordings editor of “Rolling Stone” magazine
 to co‐produce the new Springsteen album—puts it, “The indecision comes 
from fear. If you do one thing, that means you can't do another. Bruce 
wants it all. He always wants it all.”<br>
<br>
Others have suggested that Mr. Appel, Mr. Springsteen's manager, has 
hurt his career more than he has helped it. This is partly a question of
 Mr. Appel's abrasive belligerence and partly a matter of career 
decisions. Mr. Springsteen customarily plays sets that last over two 
hours. That makes it nearly impossible for him to open for other acts. 
And he has resisted playing in arenas and stadiums.<br>
<br>
“I tried playing big halls,” he said on Tuesday on the beach at Long 
Branch, N.J., where he now lives. “I couldn't stand it. Everybody was so
 far away and the band couldn't hear. Maybe if all those people had been
 there to see me, it would have been different.”<br>
<br>
“He should be a very large star already, and maybe he will be without 
Mike Appel,” said one music‐business figure. “But so far he's made no 
attempt to win new fans. In live performance he plays totally to the 
cult.”<br>
<br>
Mr. Landau rejects that notion. “Mike is the only person who saw what 
Bruce was about,” he says. “Bruce has refused to make any of those 
goes‐without‐saying compromises, and the result will be that he's about 
to do it his way, not in the prefab way of other rock careers.”<br>
Another difficulty has been a possible lack of recordcompany support 
after the first album. But Ron McCarrell, Columbia's director of East 
Coast product management, denied that the label had ever slackened in 
its support of Mr. Springsteen. “The company has looked at it as a 
commitment of time and money that would pay off later,” he said.<br>
<br>
Certainly Columbia seems primed to support the new album, “Born to Run,”
 to the full extent of its capabilities. It has purchased 1,000 seats 
for Mr. Springsteen's five‐day run at the Bottom Line (leaving 3,000 for
 the general public), to expose him to the press, radio personnel, 
record dealers and Columbia employees whose enthusiasm will be needed to
 push the record properly.<br>
<br>
The new album sounds wonderful on a first couple of hearings, but one of
 Mr. Springsteen's biggest problems so far has been a discrepancy 
between the impact of his live performances and his albums. Partly, one 
suspects, this is an insoluble difficulty. Mr. Springsteen's 
performances are so overwhelming, and extend so far beyond sound alone 
(especially the sound capturable on disc) that records can only be a 
pale reflection.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen's performances arise out of his own enormous urgency. “I
 don't like to let myself down,” was the way he put it on Tuesday. “I 
expect everybody in the band to be playing like it's the last time. When
 it doesn't happen, don't say, “Well, there'll be other time,’ All I can
 think about is right now.”<br>
<br>
It's that kind of intensity that seems the ultimate explanation for Mr. 
Springsteen's curious career. His songs are about the street life of the
 New Jersey coast towns and New York City. But just as he owes his 
authenticity to his roots, so is he bound by a suspicious, nervous, 
provincial mentality that makes him indecisive in the glittering world 
of rock careerdom.<br>
<br>
Success will answer a lot of nagging old questions and pose a whole host
 of new ones. One hopes Mr. Springsteen is ready for the stardom he's 
been struggling for—both for his own sake and for the sake of the 
overwhelming music he seems destined to produce.</div>

<br>
July 16, 1974, Page 43<br>
The New York Times </strong><br>
<br>
A year and a half ago, when Bruce Springsteen emerged as the latest in 
the line of “new Bob Dylans,” he impressed mostly for the manic energy 
of his speedy strings of words and metaphors. But times have changed, 
and Mr. Springsteen has evolved into one of the most exciting young 
figures in rock music. Anybody interested in where pop is going and who 
missed him at the Bottom Line this past weekend or who fails to hear him
 at the Schaefer Festival in Central Park on Aug. 3 is making a big 
mistake.<br>
<br>
Like so many of the younger rock singer — song writers, Mr. Springsteen 
is quite deliberately self‐conscious in his approach both to rock and 
his themes of alienation and teen age surrealist fantasy. At his second 
two‐hour show Fridays night, he emerged looking like a Sha‐Na‐Na reject,
 complete with a vaguely nineteen‐fifties hair‐do, shades and a dark 
Tshirt, its short sleeves rolled up to the shoulder.<br>
<br>
They Love to Play<br>
<br>
He relies less these days on his “poems,” which in any case offer more 
energy than any special way with words, Instead, and most refreshingly, 
he has extended his range of musical expression. First of all, Mr. 
Springsteen and his five accompanying instrumentalists simply love to 
play. And second, his band—which has been with him from the start, 
except for the drummer, and which consists of Clarence Clemons on tenor 
sax, Dave Sancious on piano, Danny Federici on organ, Garry Tallent on 
bass and Ernest Carter on drums, plus Mr. Springsteen himself on lead 
guitar— has turned into something very special.<br>
<br>
Despite his debts to Mr. Dylan and to Van Morrison, Mr. Springsteen is a
 highly original vocalist; occasionally the selfconsciousness intrudes 
unduly, but it seems in the process of being purged. And the band's 
originality—most noticeable in Mr. Clemons's saxophone solos and Mr. 
Sancious’ vaguely Debussyan pianism —never gets in the way of good old 
rock ‘n’ roll, tight and together, yet simultaneously loose and happy. 
Check it out for yourself.<br>

<br>
By HENRY EDWARDS<br>
October 5, 1975, Page 125<br>
The New York Times </strong><br>
<br>
“Comparable to all the greats,” exclaimed Rolling Stone critic Dave 
Marsh in a recent rave review of Bruce Springsteen, a new idol of the 
rock music scene. By “greats,” Marsh made it clear he had in mind Bob 
Dylan and The Who's Pete Townshend as a couple of Springsteen's peers.<br>
“Springsteen fashions the kind of seamless, 150‐minute performance that 
most artists only dream about,” wrote the Village Voice's. Paul Nelson a
 couple of weeks ago. Nelson then declared that Springsteen had entered a
 charmed circle which included Dylan, the Rolling Stones, Jackson Browne
 and the New York Dolls—each having given one of the most “moving” 
performances he'd ever experienced.<br>
“A man who just might be the next Mr. Jagger,” were the words which The 
New York Times rock critic John Rockwell applied to Springsteen a couple
 weeks ago.<br>
<br>
Such praise for Springsteen, although lavish, is becoming commonplace. 
Indeed, the recent release of Bruce Springsteen's third album, “Born to 
Run,” and his stint at the Bottom Line in Greenwich Village last month, 
have inspired virtually all of the nation's rock music critics to 
unloose some of their most resounding huzzahs in recent memory.<br>
<br>
Each year, numerous rock music performers receive good reviews; 
occasionally a newcomer is compared to one of the rockland giants. 
Hardly ever, however, does a performer emerge who is compared to all of 
them. And therefore, the extraordinary reception of Bruce Springsteen, a
 heretofore littleknown 26‐year‐old New Jersey‐born rock 
composer‐performer, raises some intriguing questions. For example:<br>
Is Springsteen really the Rock Messiah he is cracked up to be? What does
 he do and how does he bring rock music critics to such ecstasy? What 
about the conspicuous flaws in his music making? Why have most critics 
ignored these flaws? And finally, is it possible that the critical raves
 tell us more about rock music criticism itself than about the object of
 all this heady exultation?<br>
<br>
To begin with, Springsteen (the name was originally German) composes his
 own muSic and lyrics, sings to his own guitar accompaniment, and is 
generally supported by a band consisting of a bass, guitar, sax, piano 
and organ. Like a number of current rock acts, his appearances are also 
highly theatrical And so “he requires sophisticated lighting and 
amplification as well. The result isthunderous, exuberant, sexy And 
street tough. To understand both the virtues and flaws of his 
performance, it is necessary to examine, first, his lyrics, then his 
musicianship and finally his theatrical<br>
<br>
A good part of Springsteen's appeal stems from the words he sings. In 
his most recent engagements, he has commenced his shows with “Thunder 
Road,” one of many Springsteen variations of those familiar rock 'n' 
roll anthems of adolescence like The Animals' mid‐1960's classic “We 
Gotta Get Outta This Place” that are derived from films such as “Rebel 
Without a Cause” and similar B‐films that followed. Such songs conjure 
one of rock'n' roll's most sentimentalized, romanticized and 
still‐popular stereotypes: the outlawteen. The kid is lonely, lost, and 
desperate, and his only release is to toss a girl into a car and zoom 
down a highway to nowhere. As neatly structured as they are cliched, 
these anthems are nevertheless often lots of fun. Springsteen's “Thunder
 Road,” however, is notable chiefly for its repetitiousness.<br>
•<br>
Springsteen begins:* “The screen door slams/Mary's dress waves/Like a, 
vision she dances across the porch/As the radio plays/ Roy Orbison 
singing for the lonely/Hey that's me and I want you only...Show a little
 faith, there's magic in the night/You ain't a beauty, but hey you're 
all right/Oh that's allright with me... Well now I'm no hero/ That's 
understood/All the redemption I can offer, girl/Is beneath this dirty 
hood... Well the night's busting open/These two lanes will take Us 
anywhere/We got one last chance to make it real/To trade in these wings 
on some wheels/Climb in back/ Heaven's waiting on down the tracks...”<br>
As if the point is still not clear, he goes on: “Well I got this 
guitar/And I learned how to mace it talk/ And my car's out back/If 
you're ready to take that long walk/From your front<br>
?? porch to my front seat...”<br>
<br>
Finally at the song's end, he once again urges Mary to go for the drive,
 repeating himself yet again: “... so Mary climb in/It's a town full of 
loser's/And I'm pulling out of here to win.”<br>
<br>
The “kid‐as‐loser” is the familiar theme of “Born to Run,” which is 
emerging as the album's hit single. This long‐winded anthem begins: “In 
the day we sweat it out in the streets of a runaway American dream/At 
night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines/Sprung out 
from cages out on Highway 9/Chrome wheeled, fuel injected/And steppin' 
out over the line/Baby this town rips. bones from your back/It's a death
 trap, it's a suicide rap/We gotta get out while we're young/Cause 
tramps like us, baby we born to run...”<br>
•<br>
Teens ‐ in ‐ perpetual motion are also on the move in Springsteen's 
equally wordy “Backstreets”: “One soft infested summer/Me‐and Terry 
became friends/Trying in vain to breathe/The fire we was born 
in/Catching rides to the outskirts/Trying faith between our 
teeth/Sleeping in that old abandoned beach house/Getting wasted in the 
heat/And hiding on the backstreets...”<br>
<br>
If Springsteen is tireless in his evocation of the rock rebel, he 
occasionally seeks to leaven matters with symbolism. But unfortunately 
the result Is only a glossy species of fake poetry. In his “Jungleland,”
 for, example, th?? adolescent punk becomes “Magic Rat” and the city is 
“Jungleland”:<br>
“The Rangers had a homecoming/In Harlem late last night/And the Magic 
Rat drove his sleek machine/Over the Jersey state line/Barefoot girl 
sitting on the hood of a Dodge/Drinking warm beer in the soft summer 
rain/Together they disappear take a stab at romance/Md disappear down 
Flamingo Lane/Well the maximum Lawmen run down Flamingo/Chasing the Rat 
and the barefoot girl/And the kids, round here look just like 
shadows/‐Always quiet, holding hands/From the churches to the 
jails/Tonight is all silence in the world/As we take nur stand/Down in 
Jungleland...”<br>
<br>
Springsteen's musical accompaniment is simply torrential. On record, the
 barrage of bass, drums and brass sounds, the layer on layers of 
guitars, saxophones, trumpets, pianos and glockenspiels, often manages 
to overwnelm the singer's harsh baritone. In concert, the sledgehammer 
blows of his music, one right after another, have a way of cancelling 
each other out‐unless one exults in pounding repetition.<br>
For all its faults, however, Springsteen's “Born to Run” album can grow 
on a listener. Indeed, what is likeable although ultimately 
disappointing about, it is the fact that the knowledgeable listener soon
 discovers Springsteen as a collagist who does not form his collage into
 something fresh. He simply pastes together bits and pieces, and many of
 the bits thus embalmed are copies of some of rock ‘n’ roll's finest 
moments. Springsteen's vocal quality and delivery is sometimes a dead 
ringer for Roy Orbison's. In places, his melodÿ for “She's the One” 
sounds suspiciously like the theme for the mid‐1960's TV rock show 
“Shindig” and the number concludes with one of Bo Diddley's more 
familiar motifs.<br>
<br>
“Born to Run,” begins with an attention‐grabbing drum roll borrowed from
 the Raspberries who, in turn, borrowed it from The Who; its mid‐number 
crescendo could have been lifted from an Alice Cooper hit.<br>
<br>
Indeed, the sound of the album itself is an effort to re‐create and pay 
tribute to the plush, thickly cushioned sound made famous by the 
producer Phil Spector during the mid‐1960's, and yet, in the last 
analysis, instrumental and electronic overkill has led Springsteen, 
along with co‐producers Mike Appel and Jon Landau (the former Rolling 
Stone rock critic), to create musical sludge. On “Backstreets,” for 
example, the composer finds himself contending with drums that sound as 
if they have been equalized to produce a dull roar and a piano which 
appears to have been electronically rigged to generate a whole volley of
 notes where just a few would suffice, The incessant organ runs that are
 bathed in echo make this concoction the more difficult to sort 
Springsteen from the muddle. This same instrumental combination was 
used, by the way, by the producer Bob Johnson on Bob Dylan's, “Blonde on
 Blonde” in 1966 to create a stark recording in which the electrified 
instruments did not wage war against the performer. Excess on “Born to 
Run” finds Springsteen not running but instead virtually burrowing his 
way out of the bottom of a musical tunnel bf his own devising.<br>
<br>
Critics agree that Springsteen's magic has been difficult to capture on 
disk; they suggest that he must he seen and heard live to be 
appreciated. Inevitably dressed in tight jeans and tee shirt, a leather 
jacket, sneakers and cap, the grinning, scruffily bearded performer 
comes on as the prototype of punkishness. He also takes to the stage 
with the nervy bravado of a real‐life punk commanding a pool table in a 
low‐life barroom.<br>
<br>
With relentless energy, total commitment and plenty of glee, he shouts 
two and a half hours worth of his anthems of teen desperation as if his 
message could change the world. Never at rest, he swaggers, whirls, 
kicks, leaps, pirouettes, jumps onto the piano and occasionally 
improvises a dance that looks like a madcap tango. Eventually, his 
movements become as repetitious as his lyrics, but it doesn't seem to 
matter to his fans. They know he's having a ball, exulting in the rock 
‘n’ roll experience and giving the sort of heartattack‐defying 
performance (“Can I keep up this fever pitch ten minutes longer?”) that 
rock fans have long doted upon. The 25 roaring repetitions of the line 
“HIDING IN THE BACKSTREETS” with which he concludes “Backstreets” pretty
 well reveals his stupendous ehergy and give‐'em‐hell disposition; and 
yet, such raw dynamics, for all the fun they may provide, simply cannot 
disguise the fact that for the most part. Springsteen's lyrics are an 
effusive jumble, his melodies either secondhand or undistinguished and 
his tedious.<br>
<br>
Given such obvious flaws, there has to be another important ingredient 
in the success of Bruce Springsteen: namely, vigorous promotion nicely 
meshing with a receptive climate of opinion. The stage was set back in 
1972 with Springsteen's first album “Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.” 
The critics raved, but the album did not sell.<br>
A year later, his second album, “The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street
 Shuffle,” created a similar response—critical praise and paltry sales. 
Then came this year's “Born to Run” and the managers of Columbia Records
 decided to gamble unusually great sums of money in the promotion of 
this record—a decision which led to a remarkable number of hard‐sell 
radio commercials, full‐page advertisements in the trade and consumer 
press, the purchase of 1,000 tickets for promotional purposes at The 
Bottom Line when Springsteen appeared there in early September, and, of 
course, mass distribiutidn of the new album to record stores around the 
country.<br>
<br>
This decision was prompted, first of all, because the record company 
executives knew their business depends on the creation of new sensations
 every year. Accordingly, they have to promote somebody. In the second 
place, the decision to gamble on Springsteen must have taken note of the
 fact that in this time of record‐industry doldrums, the return of the 
middle‐of‐the‐road performers such as Paul Anka and the popularity of 
disco music, there is a large potential rock music audience which feels 
neglected. In such a climate, the very derivativeness of Springsteen's 
music, and the throwback quality of his punkish persona have an 
irresistible appeal —both for younger rock music fans who were 
discovering their own new stars for the first time as well as older 
nostalgists hankering for the return of the days when rock music was 
conkdered a “challenge to the establishment” and rock performers were 
looked upon as symbolic rebels.<br>
<br>
Not the least of those who would be struck by this appeal would be the 
rock music critics themselves. Nostalgists all, they could be counted on
 once again to champion Springsteen, particularly after a long period in
 which there had been precious few new rock sensations to set a critic's
 pen flying. But those not infected with rock music nostalgia may be 
forgiven if, after the first 10 minutes of hearing Springsteen sing, 
they find the hoopla tiresome and the performer vacuous. ■</div>

Saturday's Schaefer Music Festival concert in Central Park suffered a 
severe case of audience division. Could Ann Murray, a mild‐mannered. 
Canadian folk‐oriented singer, overcome the heavier, even greasier 
sounds of Bruce Springsteen, a singer Whose star, in terms of audience 
appeal, appears to be in the ascendant? Perhaps it was a mistake to put 
Mr. Springsteen, who has been reviewed previously and is heavily into 
refashioning traditional rock 'n' roll into his own image, against Miss 
Murray, the headliner.<br>
<br>
When Mr. Springsteen completed his performance, more than one‐third of 
the audience, the hard‐core Springsteen crowd, departed. Even during his
 performance, confrontations — his and hers — broke out among the 
assembled.<br>
<br>
Actually, Miss Murray came on a little stronger. She is a singer who 
wears her Maple Leaf more in evidence than, say, Joni Mitchell, and 
appears to be trying for a little less folk and a little more soul in 
her act. She essayed some old rock 'n' roll and some, Carol King 
material, as well as her own considerable lineage of hits.<br>
Miss Murray is thoroughly professional, carrying with her an elegant 
string section and a couple of women singers, the more properly to 
duplicate her recorded sounds.<br>

Brewer and Shipley opened the program</div>
