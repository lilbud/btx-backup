He’s the Boss of all bosses when it comes to endurance-test concerts. Is that better or worse?<br>
<br>
Toronto Daily Star<br>
August 22, 2012</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band logged what was, according to 
the global guardians of such lore, their longest recorded set ever at 
Helsinki’s Olympiastadion this past July 31: four hours and six minutes.<br>
<br>
Fans of the Boss can’t necessarily bank on a similar marathon at the 
Rogers Centre this Friday night, but they can more or less bank on . . .
 well . . . a marathon. Marathons are what Bruce Springsteen and the 
E-Street Band do for a living, after all, and have done for a living for
 years. They’ve staked their reputation on delivering concerts that 
habitually extend well beyond the accepted, industry-standard running 
time of 90 minutes or two hours.<br>
<br>
That kind of dogged commitment to giving the people what they want 
doesn’t come without a serious commitment to pseudo-athletic 
musicianship from everyone onstage, nor without a willingness to go the 
extra mile financially when concert-hall curfews — typically set at 11 
p.m. in this town — are blown through and local venue and union fees 
start piling up to the tune of tens and/or hundreds of thousands of 
dollars.<br>
<br>
If a prudently early start time isn’t observed going in, that kind of 
exhaustive stage show can actually gnaw into the headliner’s nightly 
takeaway from the show’s net profits in a fairly big way.<br>
The 62-year-old Springsteen, who has been employing a 16-piece band in 
service of some of the longest shows of his career on the summer leg of 
his transatlantic Wrecking Ball tour, is obviously successful enough 
after more than 40 years on the touring trail that he can afford to 
crash past the three-hour mark on a regular basis.<br>
<br>
Indeed, he’d be offending his tremendously loyal fan base if he dared 
sell it short even just once. Such a “display of energy and its 
depletion is part of what is expected of him,” a recent New Yorker 
profile noted, going on to quote Springsteen on concert length: “there 
is a commercial exchange, and that ticket is my handshake. That ticket 
is me promising you that it’s gonna be all the way every chance I get. 
That’s my contract. And ever since I was a young guy I took that 
seriously.”<br>
<br>
“With the Boss, he’s maybe even painted himself into a bit of a corner,”
 ventures Toronto-based booking agent Jack Ross, who counts Bruce 
Cockburn, Sarah Harmer, Kathleen Edwards and Sam Roberts among his 
clients. “He’d probably disappoint fans if he went out and did a long 
show by anybody else’s standards that was two or two-and-a-half hours 
long.<br>
<br>
“It has to be exhausting, although I do emphasize that for the artist, 
it is the very best time of their day . . . For a touring musician, life
 is sorta boring and there’s a lot of drudgery involved. The very best 
part of their day is the time when they’re onstage.<br>
“That’s sort of their reward for driving around in a van or a tour bus 
and being away from home and having to talk about themselves all the 
time.”<br>
<br>
There is, nevertheless, a fine line to be walked between delighting in 
the communal ecstasy of delivering a crowd a boffo performance for as 
long as you can sustain it and overstaying your welcome.<br>
The audience — Boss fans probably in particular — tends to have jobs to 
face tomorrow and kids to attend to tonight. Is it really fair to make 
them stay for over three hours until “Born to Run,” which is typically 
deep in the encores?<br>
<br>
Mind you, as most working musicians will tell you, there’s no 
hard-and-fast rule for figuring out how long you should stay up there.<br>
“I really don’t want to ever cross that line, and that’s definitely 
something we’ve thought about lots,” says Jimmy Shaw, guitarist for 
Toronto’s Metric. “I’m not a fan of the two-hour show, man. It’s too 
much f---in’ rock.<br>
<br>
“But it’s kind of band dependent. When you’re getting in a car with a 
bunch of your college buddies in Connecticut and driving to, like, a 
jam-band show in Maine, you kinda want it to go for three-and-a-half 
hours because you drove a long way and you’re on some really good drugs 
and it’s really fun, y’know?<br>
<br>
“But when you’re seeing the Strokes play, you kinda want it to be 51 
minutes because they’re cooler than you and you kinda want to leave with
 that impression that they’re off to somewhere way cooler than you could
 ever get into.”<br>
<br>
Shaw notes that Metric feels compelled to deliver a longer set now that 
it’s popular enough to charge $40 rather than $15 for a ticket to its 
shows, which is no doubt also a consideration for a lifetime champion of
 the working class such as Springsteen. Three-and-a-half hours of rock 
‘n’ roll for your $130 ticket to the Rogers Centre is an inarguably good
 deal compared to 90 per cent of the tours that come to Toronto charging
 similar prices.<br>
<br>
After 15 years or so of attending rock shows for a living, mind you, 
this writer tends to tune out after 45 minutes or an hour. Three hours 
is a tough slog — although I’ve swooned through a couple of Cure shows 
that went on for three hours and barely even noticed the time passing. 
Obviously how much music one can take in one sitting is dependent on the
 depth of one’s personal fanhood.<br>
Still, there aren’t a lot of artists outside the Grateful Dead/Phish 
jam-band circuit — where 20-minute guitar solos, let alone 
three-and-a-half-hour shows, are the norm — who can get away with such 
excess.<br>
<br>
“You have to have two things,” opines Steve Jordan, overseer of the 
Polaris Music Prize and an enormous Springsteen fan. “One is you have to
 have hits, and two is you have to have albums. If you are a pop-hit 
act, you can have 20 hits or more and that would probably be a pretty 
decent show.<br>
<br>
“But I think what keeps people’s attention for that long is not just the
 excitement of Bruce playing ‘Glory Days,’ but also him going back to 
his first couple of records or even playing outtakes that didn’t make 
the records, of keeping the true fans’ attention as well as giving the 
less engaged fans what they want, as well.<br>
“Prince is the same way. You’re gonna hear ‘Purple Rain,’ but hopefully 
you’re also gonna hear ‘Erotic City’ or ‘DMSR’ or something from The 
Black Album. Those are the ones, I think, who get away with it, the ones
 who can go even deeper than an album legacy or a legacy of hits — into a
 legacy of, like, B-sides and enough greatness that it goes deeper than 
even what ended up on the records.<br>
<br>
“And also, they have to be f---ing amazing live bands.”<br>
The latter statement is also true: few bands possess the physical 
ability to put it out there for hours on end the way Springsteen and the
 E-Street Band are celebrated for doing it night after night.<br>
As Mike Levine, bassist for storied CanCon rockers Triumph — whose 
energetic sets historically topped out around the 100-minute mark — puts
 it: “We’d be dead. We couldn’t exist with sets that long.”<br>
<br>
The key, says Levine, is not only just performing within one’s own 
limits, however, but knowing how much the audience can take, as well.<br>
<br>
“You pace a show, right?” he says. “If you looked at it like a graph, 
you’ve gotta come out big and keep going big, then you keep it going and
 kinda settle the audience down and go through whatever material you 
really want them to pay attention to, and then you start peaking.<br>
<br>
“You get that graph moving higher towards the end of the show and then 
in the encore you take them higher and then, when they’re really, really
 high, that’s when you go: ‘See ya later. Bye. Thanks for coming.’ You 
want to leave them buzzing on their way out as opposed to saying: ‘Oh, 
God, I’m so exhausted.’<br>
<br>
“Then again, if you’re Bruce and you’ve got a huge body of work and your
 fans absolutely idolize you, you can do whatever the heck you want for 
those ticket prices.”<br>
<br>
The artist's cut of the proceeds will suffer if the show goes long, but 
the cost varies — it can be as little as $500 for a solo act playing in a
 theatre, or tens of thousands in a stadium with a massive and 
complicated production. The crew working the performance get paid a 
premium, overtime rate for an extended show, and if the crew loading out
 your gear has to work past midnight, the artists gets dinged again.<br>
<br>
But if your fans absolutely idolize you, too, it’s hard to give up the 
spotlight. PS I Love You frontman Paul Saulnier, for instance, figures 
no one wants more than 45 minutes of what he has to offer, but there 
have been occasions where he and drummer Ben Nelson have felt compelled 
to go long.<br>
<br>
<br>
“Only a couple of times have we played over an hour and that’s just 
because we had a crowd that was just not getting enough,” he says. “But 
it’s happened a few times for us where the crowd sort of won’t let us 
stop. And that’s a crazy feeling. And I’ll be that probably happens 
every night to Bruce Springsteen. If he just wants to give people what 
they want, I’m cool with that.”</div>

 Rogers Center <br>
By: Ben Rayner <br>
Toronto Daily Star<br>
<br>
 Aug 25 2012</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen inspires a weird, wild-eyed species of fanaticism 
amongst people you’d never expect to witness getting fanatical over a 
rock ‘n’ roll show, and that is a healthy thing.<br>
I’m referring to people of a certain, boomer-ish age, in particular, 
although by no means was the fired-up mob of 40,000-ish on hand for 
Springsteen and the E-Street Band’s Wrecking Ball tour touchdown the 
Rogers Centre on Friday night at all limited to lifelong fans orbiting 
around his own age of 62 years.<br>
He’s doggedly hung onto relevance long after many would-be heirs to his 
throne have faded from view and pretty much everyone’s got at least one 
Springsteen album they can get with, so his audience has refreshed 
itself with new blood accordingly over the course of the past 40-odd 
years. (My personal favourite Springsteen album is Nebraska, if you’re 
asking, but I had Born to Run and The River in my elementary-school 
bedroom as soon as I was old enough to tape my dad’s records.)<br>
It is a kick, however, to see folks your parents’ age excitably carting 
homemade Bristol board signs into a baseball stadium like they’ve 
suddenly reverted to age 13 and are on their way to see Justin Bieber 
for the first time.<br>
And that, in a nutshell, is probably why Springsteen has endured all 
these years: he can make you believe rock ‘n’ roll is the most important
 thing in the world all over again — even if, shame on you, you stopped 
believing years ago — because, whenever you see him perform, it seems 
pretty clear that rock ‘n’ roll is still the most important thing in the
 world to him.<br>
That’s not an original sentiment, by any means, but there’s a reason it 
gets repeated. Springsteen’s records might not carry as much epochal 
weight as they aspire to these days — it would be a nice change of pace 
at this point, in fact, if the Boss responded just once to one of the 
many crises rending his beloved American heartland apart with an album 
about, say, his love of gardening — but you don’t walk away from his 
shows with any doubt about his convictions. He still means it. Dude’s 
not faking.<br>
And his ongoing addiction to the spotlight, to the rush of thrilling a 
crowd and having that rush deafeningly returned, appears utterly 
sincere. If there was a touch of Vegas showmanship involved in playing 
on when the house lights came up for “Born to Run” at the three-hour 
mark of this nearly three-hour-and-45-minute marathon, the growing 
presence of teardown teams in orange hard hats impatiently waiting at 
each side of the stage as the encore dragged on lent an air of impatient
 veracity to the whole spectacle.<br>
There definitely was that Vegas-style showmanship when longtime guitar 
sideman Steve Van Zandt had to “revive” a prone Springsteen with the 
drippings from a wet sponge for “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,” “Glory Days” 
(“Ah, what the f---. We can’t go home!”), and an endless “Twist and 
Shout” to finally close out the night.<br>
Preceded by Charlie Giordano’s accordion-ized strains of “Take Me Out to
 the Ballgame,” Friday’s performance kicked off with a trio of what 
Springsteen called “summer songs” — the rollicking “Working on the 
Highway,” a “Hungry Heart” taken over almost entirely by a crowd 
singalong, and a slightly ragged “Sherry Darling.”<br>
All this, before diving into a run of tunes from this year’s Wrecking 
Ball. Slightly underwhelming on record, these outraged responses to 
America’s wretched present-day economic circumstances were puffed up 
nicely by Bruce and the current, 16-piece E-Street lineup.<br>
He could write an up-with-people anthem like “We Take Care of Our Own” 
in his sleep, true, and the song seemed a bit lazy when “The Rising” 
rose up decisively in the set list an hour or so later. Still, “Wrecking
 Ball” and the martial “Death to my Hometown” were as seething as their 
au courant subject matter demanded. Springsteen attacked “Jack of All 
Trades,” “We Are Alive” and “Land of Hope and Dreams” with similarly 
righteous diligence when they turned up in the set list later on. It 
came across loud and clear that Springsteen believes in the new material
 as much as anything else in the set, and that’s a refreshing change 
from a lot of shows by rockers who’ve been around as long as him.<br>
Otherwise, the show was deep into the catalogue and all over the place. 
The Rising’s “My City of Ruins” became a soulful, 15-minute sprawl that 
segued with churchy gusto into “Spirit in the Night,” off Springsteen’s 
first record, Greetings from Asbury Park, New Jersey.<br>
He paused amidst some band introductions during the latter to repeat the
 question “Are you missing anybody?” to crushing roars of unspoken 
remembrance for departed E-Street bandmates Danny Federici and Clarence 
Clemons. The latter’s’ nephew, Jake Clemons, did a most capable job of 
pulling off the Big Man’s saxophone solos throughout the night, even if 
essentially Photostat-ing his uncle’s presence in a legendary rock 
ensemble must be a weird and ultimately troubling way to make a living.<br>
With that sad business out of the way, Springsteen chugged a full beer 
and gamely took a crowd request for “Thundercrack” because someone had 
brought along a sign depicting a thunderbolt coming out of a bare butt 
that rather amused him. A full-bore “Murder Incorporated” and a host of 
well-received oldies — “Prove It All Night,” “Candy‘s Room,” “Prove It 
All Night,” “She’s the One” and “Darlington County” among them — 
followed, while a suspiciously talented young girl of ‘tween age was 
pulled from the stagefront pit to share lead vocals on “Waitin’ on a 
Sunny Day.”<br>
Perhaps the evening’s most resonant moment came next, as Springsteen sat
 down at the piano to honour another request for “Incident on 57th 
Street.” A quiet piece of three-dimensionally realized street-level 
storytelling from 1973’s The Wild, the Innocent and the E-Street 
Shuffle, it stood in stark contrast to the all-out, all-in sonic 
overload of most of the songs that came before and all that would come 
after. It also reminded you that what has been lost in Springsteen’s 
elevation to a stadium-baiting superstar expected to make Big Statements
 about Big Things was the young Boss’s ability to turn subtly-detailed 
hardscrabble vignettes drawn on a much smaller scale into Big Statements
 about Big Things.<br>
It gets a bit much over the long haul, that never-ending E-Street blare.
 There’s a fine line between transcendent and tiring. So it was good to 
have Springsteen pull back for a minute before “Badlands” and “Thunder 
Road” and “Born to Run” and “Rosalita” and “Dancing in the Dark” — cue 
for the most spectacularly and beautifully awkward, stadiumwide 
middle-aged WASP dance party I’ve ever seen — and all the rest of the 
big guns held in check until the home stretch figuratively blew the roof
 off the roofless Rogers Centre and sent several generations’ worth of 
E-Street acolytes spilling into the streets, utterly exhausted but 
believing again.<br>
Hang onto that feeling, hang onto rock ‘n’ roll. Bruce Springsteen has and he’s doing OK.</div>

<br>
 APRIL 10, 2014</span><br>
Good evening.<br>
In the beginning, there was Mad Dog Vincent Lopez standing in front of 
me, fresh out of jail, head shaved in the Mermaid Room of the Upstage 
Club in Asbury Park.<br>
He told me he had a money-making outfit called Speed Limit 25, they were
 looking for a guitarist and was I interested. I was broke, so I was. So
 the genesis point of the E Street Band was actually a group that Vini 
Lopez asked me to join to make a few extra dollars on the weekend.<br>
Shortly thereafter, I met Dan Federici. He was draped in three 
quarter-length leather, had his red hair slicked back with his wife 
Flo—she was decked out in the blonde, bouffant wig—and they were 
straight out of Flemington, N.J.<br>
So Vini, Danny, myself, along with bass player Vinnie Roslin, were 
shortly woodshedding out of a cottage on the main street of a 
lobster-fishing town: Highlands, New Jersey. We first saw Garry Tallent 
along with Southside Johnny when they dragged two chairs out onto an 
empty dance floor as I plugged my guitar into the Upstage wall of sound.
 I was the new kid in a new town and these were the guys who owned the 
place. They sat back and looked at me like, “Come on, come on, punk. 
Bring it. Let’s see what you got.” And I reached back and I burnt their 
house down.<br>
Garry Tallent’s great bass-playing and Southern gentleman’s presence has
 anchored my band for 40 years. Thank you, Garry. Thank you, so much.<br>
Then one night, I wandered in the Upstage and I was dumbstruck by a 
baby-faced, 16-year-old David Sancious. Davey … Davey was very, very 
unusual. He was a young, black man who in 1968, Asbury Park — which was 
uh not a peaceful place— he crossed the tracks in search of musical 
adventure and he blessed us with his talent and his love.<br>
He was my roomie in the early, two-guys-to-one-six-dollar-motel-room 
years of the E Street Band. He was good. He kept his socks clean. It was
 lovely. Vini he was carrying around a snake around his neck at that 
time, so I lucked out with Davey as my roommate. And Davey’s the only 
member of the group who ever actually lived on E Street.<br>
So I walked in and he was on the club’s organ and Davey’s reserved now, 
but at the time, he danced like Sly Stone and he played like Booker T, 
and he poured out soul and blues jazz and gospel and rock and roll and 
he had voicings on his keyboard that we just never heard before. It was 
just so full of soul and so beautiful. Davey, we love you and we still 
miss you so, you know?<br>
But predating all of this was Stevie Van Zandt. Steven — frontman, 
frontman. I walk into the Middletown Hullabaloo Club. He was the 
frontman for a band called The Shadows. He had on a tie that went from 
here down to his feet. All I remember is that he was singing the 
Turtles’ “Happy Together.” During a break at the Hullabaloo Club in New 
Jersey, you played 55 minutes on and five minutes off, and if there was a
 fight, you had to rush onstage and start playing again.<br>
So I met Stevie there and he soon became my bass player first, then lead
 guitarist, my consigliere, he’s my dependable devil’s advocate whenever
 I need one, the invaluable ears for everything that I create —  I 
always get ahold of him — and fan No. 1. So he’s my comic foil onstage, 
my fellow producer/arranger, and my blood, blood, blood, blood, blood 
brother.<br>
So, Stevie, let’s keep rolling for as many lives as they’ll give us, alright?<br>
Years and bands went by — Child, Steel Mill, the Bruce Springsteen Band —
 they were all some combo of the above-mentioned gang. Then I scored a 
solo recording contract with Columbia Records and I argued to get to 
choose my recording “sidemen,” which was a misnomer, in this case, if 
there ever was one.<br>
So, I chose my band and my great friends, and we finally landed on E 
Street—the rare, rock and roll hybrid of solo artistry and a true rock 
and roll band.<br>
But one Big thing was missing—Big. It was a … it was a dark … it was a 
dark and stormy night, as a Nor’easter rattled the street lamps on 
Kingsley Blvd. and in walked Clarence Clemons.<br>
I’ve been enthralled by the sax sounds of King Curtis and Junior Walker 
and I searched for years for a great rock and roll saxophonist. And that
 night Clarence walked in, walked towards the stage, and he rose, 
towering to my right on the [Student] Prince’s tiny stage, about the 
size of this podium, and then he unleashed the force of nature that was 
the sound and the soul of the Big Man. In that moment, I knew, I knew 
that my life had changed. Miss you, love you Big Man. We wish you were 
here with us tonight. This would mean a great, great deal to Clarence.<br>
An honorable mention and shout-out to Ernie “Boom” Carter. The drummer 
who played on one song only — “Born to Run.” He picked a good one. He 
picked a good one. So here’s to you, Ernie. Thank you.<br>
Thanks of course Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan, who answered an ad in the 
Village Voice and they beat out 60 other drummers and keyboardists for 
the job. It was the in-fatigable, almost dangerously dedicated Mighty 
Max Weinberg and the fabulous five finger of Professor Roy Bittan. They 
refined and they defined the sounds of the E Street Band that remains 
our calling card around the world to this day. Thank you, Roy. Thank 
you, Max. They are my professional hitmen. I love them both.<br>
Then, 10 years later, Nils Lofgren and Patti Scialfa joined just in time
 to assist us in the rebirth of Born in the U.S.A. Nils, one of the 
world’s great, great rock guitarists, with a choir boy’s voice, has 
given me everything he’s had for the past 30 years. Thank you, Nils. So 
much love.<br>
And Patti Scialfa—a Jersey Girl—who came down one weekend from New York 
City and sat in with a local band, Cats on a Smooth Surface and Bobby 
Bandiera at the Stone Pony, where she sang a killer version of the 
Exciters’ “Tell ‘Em.” She had a voice that was full of a little Ronnie 
Spector, a little Dusty Springfield and a lot of something that was her 
very, very own.<br>
After she was done, I walked up, I introduced myself to her at the back 
bar. We grabbed a couple of stools and we sat there for the next hour or
 thirty years or so—talking about music and practically everything else.
 So we added my lovely red-headed woman and she broke the boy’s club.<br>
Now, I wanted our band to mirror our audience, and by 1984, that meant 
grown men and grown women. But, her entrance freaked us out so much that
 opening night of the Born in the U.S.A. tour, I asked her to come into 
my dressing room to see what she was gonna wear. So she had on kind of a
 slightly feminine T-shirt and I stood there, sort of sweating. At my 
feet, I had a little Samsonite luggage bag that I carried with me, and I
 kicked it open. It was filled of all my smelly, sweaty T-shirts and I 
said, “Just pick one of these. It’ll be fine, you know.” She’s not 
wearing one tonight. But Patti, I love you, thank you for your beautiful
 voice, you changed my band and my life. Thank you for our beautiful 
children.<br>
So, real bands, real bands are made primarily from the neighborhood, 
from a real time and a real place that exists for a little while and 
then changes and is gone forever. They’re made from the same 
circumstances, the same needs, the same hungers, culture. From the same 
need of love to cover over hurt. They’re forged in the search for 
something more promising then what you were born into. These are the 
elements, the tools, and these are the people who built a place called E
 Street.<br>
Now, E Street was a dance, was an idea, was a wish, was a refuge, was a 
home, was a destination, was a gutter dream and, finally, it was a band.
 We struggled together, and sometimes, we struggled with one another. We
 bathed in the glory, and often, the heartbreaking confusion of our 
rewards together. We’ve enjoyed health, and we’ve suffered illness and 
aging and death together. We took care of one another when trouble 
knocked, and we hurt one another in big and small ways.<br>

aging and death together. We took care of one another when trouble 
knocked, and we hurt one another in big and small ways.<br>
But, in the end, we kept faith in each other. And one thing is for 
certain — as I said before in reference to Clarence Clemons — I told a 
story with the E Street Band that was, and is, bigger than I ever could 
have told on my own and I believe that settles that question.<br>
But that is the hallmark of a rock and roll band — the narrative you 
tell together is bigger than any one could have told on your own. That’s
 the Rolling Stones. That’s the Sex Pistols. That’s Bob Marley and the 
Wailers. That’s James Brown and his Famous Flames. That’s Neil Young and
 Crazy Horse.<br>
So, I thank you my beautiful men and women of E Street. You made me 
dream and love bigger than I could have ever without you. And tonight I 
stand here with just one regret and that’s that Danny and Clarence 
aren’t here with us tonight.<br>
Sixteen years ago, a few evenings before my own induction, I stood in my
 darkened kitchen along with Steve Van Zandt. Steve was just returning 
to the band after a 15-year hiatus and he was petitioning me to push the
 Hall of Fame to induct all of us together.<br>
I listened, and the Hall of Fame had its rules, and I was proud of my 
independence. We hadn’t played together in 10 years. We were somewhat 
estranged. We were just taking the first small steps of reforming. We 
didn’t know what the future would bring. And perhaps the shadows of some
 of the old grudges still held some sway.<br>
It was a conundrum, as we’ve never quite been fish nor fowl. And Steve 
was quiet but persistent and at the end of our conversation, he just 
said, “Yeah, yeah I understand but Bruce Springsteen and the E Street 
Band — that’s the legend.”<br>
So I’m proud to induct, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the 
heart-stopping, pants-dropping, hard-rocking, booty-shaking, 
love-making, earth-quaking, Viagra-taking, testifying, death-defying, 
legendary E Street Band.</div>

<br>
<strong class="text-strong">VIRGINIA BEACH DAILY PRESS<br>
By Mike Holtzclaw<br>
April 13, 2014</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is 64 years old. Sixty-four. As in “Will you still need me? Will you still feed me?”<br>
<br>
To his everlasting credit, he refuses to act his age, as evidenced by 
the joyful 28-song, 3-hour and 8-minute show he put on at the Farm 
Bureau Live amphitheater in Virginia Beach on Saturday night. He spent 
much of the night scrambling around the stage like an 8-year-old on a 
sugar rush.<br>
 Springsteen danced. He crowd-surfed. He dropped to the floor and spun 
in circles like Curly from the “Three Stooges.” He proudly guzzled an 
entire $14 beer handed to him from the crowd – motioning sax player Jake
 Clemons to keep playing while The Boss knocked down the beer in one 
extended swallow. Near the end of the show, he giddily laid his head on 
the piano keyboard and allowed Roy Bittan to hit the treble notes by 
bopping Springsteen’s temple on the keys.<br>
 It marked the first time in Springsteen’s legendary career that he 
played Virginia Beach, and he set the tone from the start. “We got some 
beach music for you!” he shouted, before opening the set with “May I,” a
 hit for Hampton Roads’ own Bill Deal and the Rhondels back in 1969. The
 five-piece horn section, highlighted in the arrangements all night, 
made that glorious chestnut (originally recorded by Maurice Williams and
 the Zodiacs in 1962) feel perfectly contemporary.<br>
<br>
 The E-Street Band was playing its first gig since getting inducted en 
masse into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on Thursday night. 
Astonishingly, it was also the band’s first visit to the Hampton Roads 
region in 28 freakin’ years. The band somehow manages to get tighter in 
its arrangements and simultaneously looser in its stage antics with each
 passing year. While Springsteen sang the anthem “Badlands,” drummer Max
 Weinberg neatly punctuated the words “faith” and “hope” and “love” with
 cymbal clashes.<br>
<br>
On this tour, Tom Morello – the pyrotechnic guitarist from Rage Against 
the Machine – is standing in for longtime Springsteen cohort Little 
Steven Van Zandt, who is busy with a TV project. Morello played a key 
role in several songs on Springsteen’s 2013 CD “High Hopes,” and on 
Saturday night he did a good job of integrating his show-stopping solos 
seamlessly into the band’s arrangements. In Morello and Nils Lofgren, 
Springsteen has two of the most creative and limber lead guitarists in 
all of rock and roll, and both had their chances to shine – Lofgren 
spinning like a top while performing a finger-tapping lick during 
“Because the Night,” and Morello bringing the house down with a 
screechy, scratchy coda to “The Ghost of Tom Joad.”<br>
<br>
One of the highlights of the show was “Talk to Me,” requested by a 
handwritten cardboard sign in the pit. The song, which Springsteen wrote
 in the late 1970s and gave to Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, is
 about a poor sap desperately trying to figure out why the love of his 
life is hanging out with some other guy but won’t even speak to him 
anymore. On Saturday night, Springsteen turned it  into a hilarious vamp
 with his wife, E-Streeter Patti Scialfa. “I’d rather dodge flying blow 
dryers than get the silent treatment!” he crowed. Over and over he 
pleaded for a word, a phrase, anything … until Scialfa sweetly cooed 
back at him, “Talk to me … until the night is over!” As she repeated the
 song’s chorus, Springsteen kept assuring her, “I am talking to you! 
This is what I sound like when I talk!”<br>
<br>
Taking the stage for his encore, Springsteen reminded the crowd of his 
long history in Virginia. “Back when New Jersey  was the only place 
where we could get paid,” he said, “there was one other place. We could 
come down to Richmond and make enough money to keep us going.”<br>
<br>
After starting the encore with “The Wall,” a melancholy ode to friends 
who died in Vietnam, he kicked into high gear with “Born to Run” and a 
rollicking cover of “Seven Nights to Rock.” On “Dancing in the Dark,” he
 pulled a man, a woman and a young girl out of the crowd and not only 
danced with them, but thrust guitars into their hands and urged them to 
play along with him at center stage. “Tenth Avenue Freeze-out” included a
 video tribute to the two band members who have died in recent years – 
keyboardist Danny Federici and Norfolk-born sax man Clarence “The Big 
Man” Clemons. The band was ready to call it a night after a marathon 
rave-up on “Shout,” but Springsteen called them back out for one more 
anthem – the timeless “Thunder Road.”<br>
<br>
For Springsteen, who spent much of his adolescence surfing on the Jersey
 Shore, it was a night of beach music. For the full house that packed 
the amphitheater, it was a happy reminder that it ain’t no sin to be 
glad you’re alive.</div>
