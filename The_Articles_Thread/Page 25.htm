“He's On Fire<br>
America's latest rock-and-roll hero has the fans going wild about the Boss.”<br>
By Bill Barol</strong><br>
<br>
It was crazy on South Wabash last week, but a Chicago cop, surveying the
 scruffy scene, pronounced it "good craziness." By Wednesday about two 
dozen people had moved their homes onto the street, sleeping under the 
el tracks and washing up at McDonald's—all on the mere rumor that Bruce 
Springsteen tickets might soon be available at Ticketmaster. Jim Teymer 
drove from Madison, Wis.—140 miles one way—to take his place on the 
South Wabash line. "He's an all-American guy. " said Tevmer. who listens
 to Springsteen six hours a day, carrying tapes and headphones to work 
at an Oscar Mayer plant. "I believe in him so much." At the phone 
company technicians were feverishly working to keep phoned-in ticket 
sales from clogging exchanges all over the Midwest . Illinois Bell put 
on-line a computer system that 's usually used to control phone traffic 
on Mother's Day or handle calls to towns hit by tornadoes.<br>
Washington was crazy, too. A few days earlier, when tickets had gone on 
sale for the Aug. 5 show that will open the last leg of Springsteen's 
'84-'85 tour, phone volume more than doubled, tying up circuits from 
Virginia to the Boss's home state of New Jersey. (The 52,306 tickets for
 RFK Stadium sold out in just over an hour and a half, faster than D.C. 
tickets for Prince and the Jacksons had gone.) And in New York, 
Ticketron sold some 236,000 Springsteen tickets in one day—shattering 
the old record set by the King Tut exhibit. In the long ticket lines, 
fans reached new heights in creativity. One bagged the limit—eight 
tickets at $17.50 apiece—and then sneaked back again in disguise. "One 
of our ticket sellers caught him," a weary Ticketron official said. "She
 told him, 'You changed all your clothes, you changed your wig, but you 
forgot to change your earring'." No sale.<br>
Pass. Even in the rock-and-roll business, this represents serious 
insanity. What's going on? At 35, 10 years after "Born to Run" and 13 
months after starting his latest tour, Bruce Springsteen has become a 
kind of American archetype. He is rock and roll's Gary Cooper— a simple 
man who expresses strong beliefs with passion and unquestioned 
sincerity. He is rock and roll's Jimmy Cagney as well—streetwise and 
fiery, a galvanic mixture of body and soul. Hands down the best 
performer in pop, Springsteen always gives honest value for the fans' 
entertainment dollars. And in this summer of mindless Rambomania, the 
values championed in his songs offer an alternate vision of resurgent 
American patriotism. Deep affection for home and family informs almost 
every line, and above all there is a message of faith in hard times—a 
conviction that although small towns may crumble and factories rust, 
hope must never die. "Born in the U.S.A.,"Springsteen's seventh album,is
 the strongest statement yet of what amounts to his rock-and-roll world 
view. It's also a huge seller, at 7.5 million copies sold in America the
 biggest in the history of Columbia Records, still in the Top 10 after 
more than a year.<br>
Outside the United States the record has sold 5 million copies in 20 
countries, and was the number-one album in Britain, West Germany and the
 Netherlands last week.<br>
Springsteen's overseas tour this year confirmed his position as an 
international symbol of America. In Australia, Japan ("Kyoto," a 
Springsteen associate says wonderingly. "What a response! We felt like 
we were in New Jersey.") and Europe, kids waved American flags and 
chanted along with "Born in the U.S.A." "He represents the dynamism of 
the United States," says Christiane Schaeler of radio-station 95.2 in 
Paris. Besides, "The problems of city life and the working class are the
 same everywhere," Scottish music student Michael Hutson said at a 
sold-out Springsteen concert at Newcastle. And as European audiences 
cheered, something curious happened at home: Springsteen stepped over 
the line in the American mind. He went over there a rock star. He's 
comingback a symbol.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's status as an icon, though, isn't as simple as it seems. It
 is based largely on "Born in the U.S.A.," a song that younger audiences
 (and older ones with short memories) tend to take as an exultant anthem
 for Reagan-era America in fact it is about a vet whose life was 
irreversibly scarred by Vietnam. The powerful refrain, which Springsteen
 rasps out in a voice of pure pain, is more about promises broken than 
promises kept. And although his songs are ultimately hopeful, they are 
studded with powerful images of despair. The pictures stick in the mind:
 a drifter speeds down an empty highway past the refinery towers, 
nowhere to go on a steamy summer night and nothing to do but drive. A 
kid from a mill town gazes longingly up at a mansion on a hill. A 
highway patrolman, lonely and confused, watches the taillights disappear
 as his criminal brother escapes into Canada. These are pictures of an 
America gone wrong.<br>
Springsteen himself seems uneasy about wearing the mantle of American 
Archetype. Friends describe him as a genuinely humble man, far removed 
from the excesses of the rock- star life. ''That's really the real him,"
 says Clarence Clemons saxophonist in Springsteen's E Street Band and a 
longtime friend. "He cares for every person in the audience." Besides 
being decent, he seems to be canny enough to sense that rock and rollers
 just don't make very good archetypes—being an icon of any sort is the 
furthest remove, spiritually, from the idea of rebellion that lies at 
rock's heart.<br>
Besides, it's heavy lifting being a symbol, and the cost is high. Look 
what it did to Elvis Presley. The lessons of Presley's lonely life and 
sad death weren't lost on Springsteen, who once scaled the walls of 
Graceland in an attempt to meet the King. Earlier this year he released a
 reworked Chuck Berry song, "Johnny Bye Bye," an elegy for Presley: 
"They found him slumped up against the drain / With a whole lot of 
trouble running through his veins...”<br>
"That's one of the things that has shortened life spans, physically and 
creatively, of some of the best rock and roll musicians—that cruel 
isolation," he- told Rolling Stone last year. "If the price of fame is 
that you have to be isolated from the people you write for, then that's 
too f------ high a price to pay." So Springsteen still mingles with the 
public whenever he can. Amazingly, fans tend to respect his privacy. Two
 nights before his wedding in May, he went out and shot pool with his 
future in-laws at an Oregon bar. And last week as ticket madness raged 
through half of America, he dined out in midtown Manhattan with a few 
close friends. "He tries to control his own life," says an old friend. 
"He's not interested in being an isolated person."<br>
If Springsteen is reluctant to stand as a cultural symbol, he is even 
more leery about politics. He has no strong attachment to any party, and
 his own politics might be described as populist. He probably wouldn't 
have even acknowledged the 1984 presidential race if President Reagan 
hadn't made a clumsy attempt to claim the rocker for his own at a 
September campaign stop. "America's future rests in a thousand dreams," 
the president told a whistle-stop crowd in—where else?—New Jersey.<br>
"It rests in the message of hope in the songs of a man so many young 
Americans admire— New Jersey's own Bruce Springsteen." An associate 
describes Springsteen as "astounded" by the incident. In October he told
 Rolling Stone: "You see the Reagan re-election ads on TV—you know: 
'It's morning in America.' And you say, 'Well, it's not morning in 
Pittsburgh . It's not morning above 125th Street in New York. It's 
midnight, and like there's a bad moon risin'."<br>
So the singer jabbed back, in his own fashion. In Pittsburgh, his first 
stop after the Reagan remark, he dedicated a song to an activist United 
Steelworkers' local. In Tacoma, he dedicated a song to a local 
environmental organization and urged the audience to look into the 
group. He made pleas from the stage for local food banks in Atlanta 
Denver, Oakland and Los Angeles—and kicked in a series of $10,000 
personal checks besides. He also delivered a few pointed remarks along 
the way.<br>
"This is a song about blind faith," he told a Tacoma audience. "Like when the president talks about arms control."<br>
But that, intimates say, was only because Springsteen felt painted into a
 corner by the Reagan remark. Such direct volleys are rare. He is a 
musician first and last, his messages are in the music, and global 
concerns don't often intrude. Most often it's the small personal 
tragedies that count in his world: lost jobs, shattered families, the 
high cost of broken dreams. On this tour, for the first time, the more 
somber songs have moved to the heart of the show. "Highway Patrolman'' 
was a highlight of last year's concerts—a lovely, heartbreaking song 
about a cop torn between loyalties to the law and his black-sheep 
brother. "The River" told the story of a working-class kid trapped in a 
sad marriage; "Johnny 99" was a laid-off autoworker driven to crime by 
insurmountable money troubles. And across America last year, the words 
of "My Hometown" resonated strongly at each stop: "Now Main Street's 
whitewashed windows and vacant stores/Seems like there ain 't nobody 
want to come down here no more/ They're closing down the textile mill 
across the tracks/Foreman says these jobs are going boys and they ain 't
 coming back .... "<br>
These are grim messages, but Springsteen is too much a rocker at heart 
to let the sadder songs overwhelm. What makes his shows exhilarating pop
 events is the ease with which he shifts gears into high-energy burners 
like "Thunder Road" and "Cadillac Ranch" - songs that encapsulate all 
the fire and abandon of the rock-and-roll spirit. Springsteen seems to 
be everywhere at once on the concert stage: high atop a speaker bank, 
racing up a stairway to play to the people in the back, tearing back 
down to the lip of the stage. His shows are marathons, often reaching 
four hours in length. Says E Street guitarist Nils Lofgren, an 
established Columbia artist who signed on with Springsteen last year, 
"With Bruce you wind up treating those four hours as if someone said, 
'You've got four hours left on earth. What are you going to do with it?'
 "<br>
Springsteen, friends say, would rather be doing nothing else than 
playing rock and roll . Behind every show lies a thought that's central 
to great rock-and-roll performing—the idea that only this moment 
matters. Not Yesterday, not tomorrow. but now. His commitment to the 
moment is total, and every show in every city bristles with passion and 
good humor. Even the hokey moments are deliriously exciting—like the 
scene when Springsteen and sax player Clemons ( "The Big Man! The King 
of the World! The Master of Disaster!") square off at opposite ends of a
 long arena stage, mock scowling, eyes locked, each playing at full 
tilt—and then race toward one another to meet at center stage for an 
exuberant twist, twine or rumba.<br>
Offstage, the singer devotes his formidable drive to a more personal 
pursuit: keeping his private life his own business. He is surrounded by a
 determined cadre of loyal friends and handlers, none of whom has much 
enthusiasm for talking to the press, and Springsteen himself hasn't 
given an interview since talking to Rolling Stone late last year. "I 
give my entire energy to the public," he told his new father-in-law 
after marrying Julianne Phillips in May. "But this is different. Things 
that are private should be kept private. " But privacy is harder than 
ever to come by. He is not only a bigger star than he has ever been, but
 a different kind of star—a political symbol, a national symbol ... and,
 let's face it, a sex symbol, thanks to a rigorous schedule of weight 
training that has chiseled him a whole new profile. It's not his first 
new look. Over the last dozen years Springsteen has worn several faces: 
the scowling late-Dylan of the late '70s, the leather-clad tough of the 
middle decade, the earringed singer / songwriter of l974.To start with, 
back in his hometown of Freehold, N.J. he was a scrawny Jersey kid with 
an Irish father, an Italian mother and a Dutch name. A headstrong boy 
who chafed under discipline both at home and in parochial school, he 
felt everything turn when he bought a pawnshop guitar at 13. "It was one
 of the most beautiful sights I'd ever seen in my life,"he told rock 
journalist Dave Marsh. "I had found a way to do everything I wanted to 
do. " Hooking up with a local band called the Castiles, Springsteen 
began playing in Jersey bars. Stints in four more local groups followed 
before he landed an audition with Columbia executive John Hammond, who 
years earlier had discovered Billie Holiday and Bob Dylan. Hammond gave 
the young singer 15 minutes of his time. He was stunned. Springsteen 
signed with Columbia Records in 1972.<br>
His first LP, "Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.," was done in just three
 weeks and showed—maybe too strongly—the influence Dylan had had on 
Springsteen. Wild torrents of words skittered across the record's 
surface: "Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a 
teen-age diplomat…" Springsteen sang in the album's opening line. Nobody
 was quite sure what that meant. From Dylan, who had been obtuse for a 
decade by that time, music fans expected such. No one knew what to make 
of this skinny Jersey kid with the scraggly beard. The second 
Springsteen LP, "The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle," 
pared the verbiage back some, to better effect, and played up the 
jazzier side of Springsteen's music. It also introduced characters who 
under one name or another would populate all the singer's records from 
then on: this time out they were Spanish Johnny and Puerto Rican Jane, 
lonely teens fighting to keep their dreams alive in the big city. A few 
deejays, including Philadelphia's Ed Sciaky, began to play the records 
and talk up Springsteen's incendiary live shows. Sciaky, then with WMMR 
recalls with special fondness the first time he heard "Rosalita": "I 
thought I'd never hear louder applause. It was like an explosion. "<br>
Unfortunately, ecstatic reception in the clubs didn't mean big sales in 
the record stores. But Springsteen kept working the East Coast circuit 
and attracting a good measure of critical attention. His best notice 
came from a young Boston writer named Jon Landau: "I saw rock and roll 
future," he wrote in Boston's weekly Real Paper in May 1974, after a 
typically exuberant show at the Harvard Square Theatre. "Its name is 
Bruce Springsteen." By October 1975 the singer's small, fiercely loyal 
group of fans was convinced that Springsteen couldn't be held down much 
longer. They were right. The third LP, "Born to Run," hit the street 
like a firecracker, a superb, passionate record that traced a whole 
heartbreaking day in the lives of Springsteen's urban heroes.<br>
Although some critics dismissed the record's dense sound and complex 
song cycle as bombastic, sales were brisk—finally—and the album landed 
in the Top 10. That's when the national media came around. NEWSWEEK and 
Time featured the singer on their covers—both in the same week— 
initiating a chain reaction of press coverage that focused on 
Springsteen more as an event than a musician. Something of a backlash 
resulted, and according to associates the young rocker wasn't ready. 
"But he learned a lot from it," an insider says. "He learned to relax 
and keep focused on what's real."<br>
He would need all his forbearance. A legal wrangle with Mike Appel, his 
manager at the time, would keep him out of the studio for almost two 
years, dampening his upward momentum and causing some observers to write
 him off. Springsteen wasn't legally free to record again until May 
1977, with Jon Landau now along as manager and co-producer. "Darkness on
 the Edge of Town," released in 1978, was a grittier work than any of 
the earlier records—no doubt reflecting the frustrating two-year 
layoff—and it sounded a theme that Springsteen has continued to address:
 the terrible gap between expectation and reality in the American dream.
 Home and family emerged as the only comfort; the title tune reminded 
listeners how bleak the world can be beyond the safe confines of home, 
and what a high price it exacts from those who try to break away "Lives 
on the line dreams are found and lost, " he sang, "I'll be there on time
 and I'll pay the cost/For wanting things that can only be found/In the 
darkness on the edge of town. "<br>
On subsequent records Springsteen's America grew darker still. "The 
River," a double LP released in 1980,boasted some of his most affecting 
work to date, and ended with a jolt: "Wreck on the Highway," a somber 
Hank Williams sound-alike about a young man who sees his own mortality 
in a late-night auto crash on a deserted highway. This was deeply moving
 stuff, and there was more on "The River," but on the whole the record 
felt bloated, overly fussed over. Springsteen seemed to be reaching 
toward something new. Two years later he found it: the surprising and 
heartfelt "Nebraska, " a bleak collection of folk tunes recorded solo in
 his New Jersey home. Inspired (if that's the right word) by the story 
of serial killer Charles Starkweather, it is his worst-selling LP to 
date, and his most powerful. "[The album] was about that American 
isolation," he told Rolling Stone, "what happens to people when they're 
alienated from their friends and their community and their government 
and their job. Those are the things that keep you sane, that give 
meaning to life in some fashion. And if they slip away, then anything 
can happen." His lyrics had grown stronger with each album— quicker, 
terser, more photographic. His live shows had continued to attract 
glowing notices, not least for their skillful mingling of rave-up 
rockers and American Gothic. By the time "Born in the U.S.A." was 
released last June, Springsteen was ready to assume the title of The 
Great American Rock and Roller.<br>
But even those around him are a little surprised at the leap Springsteen
 has taken this year in the public consciousness. There is a sense that 
this latest round of frenzy is somehow beyond—a step past even the 
madness of last year's American tour. "The depth and width of the 
attention have taken an exponential jump," one associate said last week.
 "We're only just adjusting to it now." That means, among other things, 
fielding ticket requests from high-profile fans in every walk of 
life—even politics. New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley will be at the 
Washington show; some White House staffers, who can usually wangle 
admittance to any event, won't. A rumor about a secret VIP ticket list 
at federally owned RFK Stadium was shot down late last week, and the 
denial seems credible—even Gray &amp; Co., the Capital's premier public 
relations firm, has been forced to score tickets from scalpers.<br>
In the band, the press of public attention means more excitement focused
 on the stage. "Right now you've got 7 or 8 million people that are 
fanatic fans, " Nils Lofgren says. "Two years ago 5 or 6 million of them
 didn't know who Bruce was. There's electricity that won't ever quite be
 exactly like this." Even allowing for rock-star hyperbole, there's 
truth to this. And although this may not be the time to fan the flames, 
there's one more reason for people to go nuts about this summer's 
Springsteen tour: he and the band have been on the road for 13 months, 
and according to band intimates the last show on this tour—probably in 
October—will be the band's last group activity for quite some time. 
Springsteen won't go the way of Prince and retire from the stage but 
Lord, the man needs rest. No one is sure when work on the next record 
will start. This summer tour "seems like a friendly thing to do," says a
 Springsteen insider, "a way to say goodbye for a while."<br>
During his layoff Springsteen will ponder his next album project, 
although no one around him knows what shape it will take. There is talk 
of a live record, as there is after every tour, but it's just talk so 
far. The singer's handlers will spend their time fielding offers from 
people who want to cash in on his huge new fame. There's been 
speculation about movie roles, especially in the wake of Springsteen's 
good performances in two rock videos—"I'm on Fire" and "Glory 
Days"—directed by John Sayles. It's not likely that he'll accept an 
outside offer, though. If he does decide to do a movie it will probably 
be a project of his own devising, like Prince's "Purple Rain." One thing
 he definitely will not do is accept any of the offers that have come in
 for commercial endorsements. An associate rolls his eyes toward the 
ceiling as he promises that Springsteen will never rewrite "Born in the 
U.S.A." for a TV commercial.<br>
Some things, after all, are too important to mess around with. 
Springsteen's hard core of admirers talk about how he and his music have
 changed their lives. They mean it literally. Everyone has a story to 
tell about the decisive moment when he realized that rock and roll means
 as much to the man onstage as it does to him. There's a sense of 
community in that moment between artist and audience, one that other 
forms of expression can't approach for power and immediacy. In that 
instant, as guitars thunder and hot lights blaze, Springsteen and his 
fans share above all a conviction that the music means something—that 
properly applied, rock and roll can heal broken hearts, mend shattered 
lives, light the way through hard times or at least ease the pain for 
one thrilling moment. Another rock idol, Mick Jagger, once said, 'It's 
only rock and roll, but I like it. " In Springsteen's world the thought 
would be different. It's rock and roll, he might say. And it matters.</div>

Vanity Fair, Italy, June 2009<br>
"Bruce SPringsteen: My deal with the Devil"<br>
By Leonardo Colombati</strong><br>
<br>
He sold more than 160 million records. He won an Oscar, 2 Golden Globes,
 19 Grammy Awards. In the last 35 years he managed to sell 25 million 
tickets for his shows. If you check the list of the most powerful 
celebrities in the world recently published by “Forbes” his name is at 
number six: Bruce Springsteen.<br>
When I met him a couple of years ago on the backstage of the Köln Arena,
 we chatted a little bit about literature (and specifically about Philip
 Roth, “another New Jersey hero”) and then he confessed that rockin’ all
 over the world was still his priority: “I really love to rock the 
house! Look at tonight’s setlist. You see? We’ll play 26 songs and only 
two of them are slow”.<br>
In September Bruce will turn 60, but if you have seen him live recently 
you can confirm Albert Einstein’s smart intuition about relativity of 
time. Today the Boss is in Stockholm and we talk before the second of 
his three sold-out gigs in the old Olympic Stadium. My first question 
is:<br>
<br>
How do you do that?<br>
<br>
“How do I do what?”<br>
<br>
It’s practically ten years that you are on tour and in the last seven 
years you have made five studio albums. You were never so prolific as 
you are now, not even at the beginning of your career. It’s like the 
Stones in the Decca years…<br>
<br>
“Focusing is the secret”, he says. “You get a little older and you have a
 defined amount of time for doing your work and enjoying your friends . .
 . I also believe that I learnt how to do my job in a more efficient 
manner that allows me to get more, to put good music out to my audience.
 I think that when I was young I had a lot of insecurity, I would second
 guess everything and the creative intelligence that allows you to make 
good choices while you’re writing wasn’t as fully developed. I had a 
little bit of a shotgun approach, where I was writing a million things 
and then try to go back and choose what was right. Now I write very 
concisely, I have few outtakes from my albums, but with the songs I’ve 
written and demoed I know that I have something that’s gonna make a good
 record before I even step into the studio. That allows me to do few 
more records and to tour more constantly, which I love doing, and I have
 to thank my wife Patti who has taken a large share of the burden at 
home with the children, so that I can come over here and be able to tour
 for my fans.”<br>
<br>
Actually, Patti didn’t come for the European leg of the “Working on a 
Dream Tour” because she has to take care of Even (19), Jessica (18) and 
Sam (15). What is amazing is that few days ago, in Netherlands, half of 
the audience was the same age of Bruce’s three kids.<br>
<br>
“That’s true,” he reckons. “We have a new audience that comes each tour,
 we seem to gather new young faces. Most of those guys weren’t even born
 when I made Born in the U.S.A. That’s another reason why this has been a
 very prolific and active time for myself and the band.”<br>
<br>
Every time we talk about passing of time during our conversation, I 
notice that Bruce tends to be more serious and passionate. Although it’s
 clear that he made a deal with the Devil, he’s running into “those 
crisp fall days that come along in September”, as he said. I wonder if 
that’s the reason why he chose to make some pop songs for Working on a 
Dream.<br>
<br>
The sound of the great records made by the Beach boys, The Byrds and the
 Beatles is perfect for emphasizing the main themes of the album, which 
are Love and Time…<br>
<br>
“Yes, or to put it in other words, the transcendence of Time in Love”, 
he says. “It was a talent that I had in the early days of my career to 
build those kind of arrangements that I hadn’t use very much during the 
past 10 or 15 years, when I tended to strict the band down to a more 
rock sound, you know . . . Rock ‘n’ roll, folk-rock, roots . . . And I 
kind of tilted away from those very rich pop arrangements until we got a
 little bit of it on Magic with ‘Girls in their Summer Clothes’ and 
‘Your Own Worst Enemy.’ I really enjoyed to make them because I love 
those big sweeping pop records. And now I had my little opera with 
‘Outlaw Pete,’ and then ‘Queen of the Supermarket,’ ‘Kingdom of Days’ 
and ‘This Life’—all little symphonies that sort of tackled different 
adult issues. It was very enjoyable.”<br>
<br>
Working on a Dream is an album full of happiness and melancholy. People,
 in America and in Europe, are living times of fear and anguish. Is that
 the reason why you play only few songs of the new album and you pick up
 some of the most political songs in your catalogue, like “Seeds,” 
“Johnny 99” and “The ghost of Tom Joad”? Your fans call them the 
“Recession Suite.”<br>
<br>
“We do try to do a variety of things. We want to entertain and we want 
to bring joy and smile to our audience’s faces. We also want to inform 
and reflect times we are living through. When I put a set together for a
 tour those are the requirements that I have before I feel that I’ve 
created something that is in the tradition of what we’ve pursued in our 
work life. You know, after 9/11, in 2002 we had The Rising, than we had 
Magic a couple of years ago that address a lot of the issues of the Bush
 administration, the Iraq war… And so, this record came right between 
those things and the Obama campaign.”<br>
<br>
A campaign that Bruce endorsed by playing in various rallies before the 
Inauguration Ceremony held in Washington last January, an unforgettable 
afternoon opened by Bruce who played “The Rising” in front of 500,000 
Americans gathered at the Lincoln Memorial. Few days before, Obama said,
 “I decided to run for Presidency because I can’t be Bruce Springsteen .
 . .”<br>
<br>
“There was a lot of hope out there,” Bruce says, “and remains a lot of 
hope out there, but the times also became hard, the Country was near 
down off the cliff by of the last administration.”<br>
<br>
It was the end of a nightmare . . .<br>
<br>
“Yeah, and so I needed some music on this tour that’s gonna reflect the 
consequences of the choices that we made. So I went back to ‘Seeds’, 
‘Johnny 99’, ‘The Ghost of Tom Joad’, Steven Foster’s song ‘Hard Times’…
 You know, my favourite promise is to tell the bad news and the good 
news.”<br>
<br>
The good news for his fans are that Bruce is still the best live 
performer in town. Someone said that the world is split in two: whose 
who adore Bruce Springsteen and whose who have never seen him in 
concert. People that attended his last shows can easily confirm that. 
The E Street Band is having a lot of fun.<br>
<br>
Now you started to play a game called “stump the band.”<br>
<br>
“That’s something that happened. I started to pick a sign or two out of 
the audience and more signs showed up, and then somewhere towards the 
end of the last tour it became a little bit of a thing that we did, and 
now I save a place at night, I leave three or four songs blank on our 
setilist and the band knows that I’m gonna run out there and grab a few 
signs and we’re gonna see what the audience want to hear right now. That
 allows the audience to get their hands on the show, it opens the show 
up and brings a lot of warmth, and it breaks that law between the 
audience and the performer down. You know, we don’t have a rigid setlist
 from town to town. We are here tonight responding to you and with your 
input we would give you a show that is uniquely yours and only get 
played in your town.”<br>
<br>
How is it working with Jay?<br>
<br>
“Jay is a phenomenon!”, he says. “A 18 years old drummer is not supposed
 to be able to sit in that seat and perform the way he does. A 18 years 
old drummer he’s barely supposed to play in time! He’s a real phenomenon
 and he prepared very deeply with his dad. He takes a certain amount of 
Max’s style that is recognizable and he infused it with his own style. 
You know, he’s playing in punk-rock bands, very hard rock and heavy 
metal bands, and he brings some of that energy. He’s excited to play 
with the band and he’s a lovely lovely kid.”<br>
<br>
I believe that Jay is the proof that the E Street Band is not only a 
rock band but it works like a family… When you see the E Street Band 
live you can feel that sense of brotherhood, what Walt Whitman called 
the “dear love of comrades . . .”<br>
<br>
“To have the only other guy on that seat in 35 years be that guy’s son is a wonderful thing for the band”.<br>
<br>
Jay will give back that seat to his dad by the time the tour will hit 
Italy. There are three shows on schedule: Rome (07/19), Turin (07/21) 
and Udine (07/23). <br>
<br>
Don’t you know that with Working on a Dream you became the first foreign
 artist to reach ten times the #1 position in the Italian album chart?<br>
<br>
“Wow, that’s incredible!” he says. “Italian audience was always one of 
the most deepest and the most loyal and fanatic . . . It’s an endless 
pleasure to come back to Italy, it’s always magic. I always look forward
 to coming back.”<br>
<br>
It’s a love story started 24 years ago when you played at S. Siro Stadium in Milan for the first time.<br>
<br>
“I remember that show pretty well.”<br>
<br>
Last time that we met, we recalled your second concert at S. Siro, in 2003 . . .<br>
<br>
“Yeah. After a couple of songs it started to rain very heavily and we 
thought that we had to stop because of the lightning. But none of you 
60,000 crazy Italians moved, so we continued to play and the result was 
one of the five most amazing shows of my entire career.”<br>
<br>
Talking about Italy, Sergio Leone—a film director that exerted a big 
influence on your work—died exactly 20 years ago. The first track of 
Working on a Dream, “Outlaw Pete,” reminds me the atmosphere of the 
soundtrack of The Good, The Bad and the Ugly . . .<br>
<br>
“It was a little homage,” he laughs. “I had a cowboy song and I said I 
got to dress this up with a little bit of Ennio Morricone’s style. They 
were fabulous movies and of course Ennio is one of the greatest 
composers for film in the world. He made an incredible body of work. A 
lovely man, I had the honour of meeting him a couple of times.”<br>
<br>
Someone say that rock ‘n’ roll started to loose its power since iTunes 
put the idea of disc in a critical position. The album format – its 
length, its structure, the lyrics printed on the sleeve, reclaim a 
certain attention, it’s an experience similar to reading a book. The 
best artists of the Sixties, the Seventies, the Eighties, trusted in 
that kind of attention and that’s why they could use their expressive 
freedom at its maximum potential even if they were doing mainstream 
music. Take the Beatles, for instance: in 5 years, they moved from “Love
 me do” to “A day in the life,” and people were following them.<br>
<br>
Now it’s seems to me that the new ways of listening music don’t allow the same liberty. How do you deal with that?<br>
<br>
“My theory is that you have to go about your business the way you go 
about your business. In other words, the world of music—and the world 
period—change constantly. If you live to be my age you’ve seen great 
changes, you know? When I started recording there were only records, 
then I saw the cassette tapes, I saw cd’s . . . These things change on a
 10 ten year or 12 year cycles, and they will continue to change 
probably forever. What doesn’t change is the artist’s commitment to his 
audience, his commitment to be understood, his commitment to creating a 
body of work that hopefully will have meaning for the listeners, and 
then you have to trust that that work will be communicated to those 
listeners in some way. Maybe not the way you intended, but I think there
 are people out there who are always searching for a deeper experience. 
Rock ‘n’ roll has been like a secular religion in the second half of the
 20th Century: there were people who sought a context for the answers to
 the daily life and daily problems and to dance and to be exhilarated 
and helped through struggling times. My job is to provide content and 
music that would address those issues. That is the way that I serve my 
people and my audience. The only thing that I know to do is to continue 
to do that, and then I look to the vehicles that are available to me at 
any given time, whether it’s the internet or a cassette tape or digital 
press, whatever . . . So that’s the way that I approach this issue and I
 don’t have all the answers and everybody does it in a different way… 
You know, I used to love the big album covers, they were magic. Well, 
they’re gone now, something else is there. You are livin’ your times and
 I always thought that if Shakespeare was alive today he would be on the
 internet!”<br>
<br>
Talking about secular religion I always thought that Dylan and yourself 
were the authors of pop music’s New Testament, the first who talked 
about adult issues in rock ‘n’ roll. You wrote “Thunder Road” in your 
twenties, but there was already a line that says, “I’m ready to grow 
young again . . .” Your characters always live with the uncertainty, the
 contradictions and the compromises of the adult world, and that’s why 
maybe “Thunder Road” talked to me when I was 15 years old and continue 
to talk to me now . . .<br>
<br>
“That was a funny song,” Bruce recalls. “It was recognising the lost of 
innocence that was throughout post-Vietnam America. Why did I say that I
 wasn’t young anymore? Because nobody after Vietnam was truly young or 
innocent anymore. Somehow, we were all been felt responsible for the 
times we lived in, and even a 24 years old young man could feel young in
 the early Seventies after 50,000 dead. Those were extremely adult 
issues and if you were a teenager you had to face it because of the 
draft, you couldn’t ignore the course of history in those days. Everyone
 knew someone who died, everyone knew someone who didn’t come back from 
the war. I liked the romance of rock ‘n’ roll but I had also to face the
 sense of the real world. We were all a sort of romantic realists, you 
know . . . and still I am, I think . . .”<br>
<br>
Show time is near. But I want to know about Bruce’s future releases.<br>
<br>
In the last couple of year you wrote some solo stuff . . .<br>
“I’m always writing,” he laughs. “I write all the time.”<br>
<br>
It should be your next project?<br>
<br>
“I don’t know. I think that the E Street Band will probably take a rest 
for a little while. But it all will happen again. We’re lifers, we’re 
gonna go on forever.”<br>
<br>
What about the Darkness on the Edge of Town box-set?<br>
<br>
“Oh yeah, that’s something we’re working on. We take it slow and try to put something together that would be nice for fans.”<br>
<br>
Bruce, before we finish . . . We were talking about requests. Can I do mine?<br>
<br>
“Sure.”<br>
<br>
I would love to hear “Once upon a time in the West” while you are 
entering on stage in Rome, like you have done a couple of times in the 
past . . .<br>
<br>
“Okay, let me write it down and see what we can do! Take care my friend.”</div>

“Bruce Springsteen’s longest season”<br>
By Robert Duncan</strong><br>
<br>
The big news the week of October 20, 1975 was a rock star and a kid who ran into President Ford's limo in Hartford.<br>
Quick. What were their names? "Everyone will be famous for 15 minutes," 
Andy Warhol once said. I don't think James Falamites would argue with 
that.<br>
Through a misjudgment on the part of Hartford police and the Secret 
Service, Falamites was cleared to pass through a Hartford intersection 
and when he struck the President's passing limo, he gained his 15 
minutes of fame. Newspapers, magazines and news shows across the country
 ran this teenager's story and later in the month, he was introduced on 
Howard Cosell's ill-fated Saturday Night Live show (not to be confused 
with NBC's Saturday Night).<br>
I don't think the rock star would argue, either. The week of October 20,
 1975 he was out on a moderately successful tour of the Midwest when, in
 a quirk almost unprecedented in periodical publishing, he appeared as 
the cover subject on the nation's two biggest weekly news magazines, 
Time and Newsweek, simultaneously. It was a similar misjudgment to that 
of the Hartford police and the Secret Service. The news weeklies were 
tossing around words like "superstar" and "hit single" and "regeneration
 of rock" in relation to this virtual unknown. Naturally, the rock press
 had preceded them with even more lavish praise. When the ink settled, 
however, it may have also been just Bruce Springsteen's 15 minutes. <br>
In the 18 months since the press' premature ejaculation, Springsteen's 
career has followed a strangely familiar script. Actually, there are two
 or three plots progressing here.<br>
Most visible of the plots, and maybe most familiar to the show biz fans,
 has been his legal battle with what some may term his "rapacious" 
manager. The gist of it is, or so the reports go: he is not making very 
much money (relatively speaking) and his manager is. While at the same 
time, his manager is trying to tell him exactly what to do—up to 
forbidding him to enter a studio with friend/producer Jon Landau to 
record. Of course, this means that the follow-up to the much-vaunted 
Born To Run is way overdue, and Columbia Records (who is also involved 
in litigation) is extremely anxious. Worse, the public presumably is 
forgetting— cover stories of a year and a half ago or no, just like they
 did with what's-his-name who smashed up Ford's limo.<br>
The second of the plots here is that Springsteen is, even at this 
moment, out touring the country—specifically, the Midwest again—just as 
he has been on and off since all the hoopla hit the fan. In other words,
 he is leading the typical life of any upper mediumly successful rock 
'n' roller.<br>
But the punchline, what all rock soap opera fans are dying to know is: 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO BRUCE Springsteen? Is a quarter of an hour in the 
spotlight long enough—or perhaps too long—for the kid from Asbury Park?<br>
I can only argue as an unrepentant fan of Springsteen and tell what I've seen and heard over the past 18 months.<br>
To backtrack: I interviewed Springsteen in Detroit where I was working 
for CREEM back in October of '75. The Time/ Newsweek covers had yet 
happened. I had seen him only the week before in Ann Arbor and thought, 
while he talked too much onstage, shuffled about a lot like some sort of
 Jersey citybilly, the show was ultimately too slick. I'd expected true 
grit from the hype, and had never stopped to think that Born To Run was 
about as far from true grit as a symphony orchestra. I also never 
thought about the fact that the last thing an honest-to-goodness true 
grit person wanted to appear as onstage was an honest-to-goodness true 
grit person. When you come from a background as mundane as Springsteen 
does, you don't celebrate it—you celebrate release from it. You go for 
the larger than life. He wasn't going to be the bus driver's son, he 
would be James Dean or Marlon Brando. While Springsteen often wore a 
T-shirt and leather jacket, they were Brando's and Dean's wardrobe, 
strictly a Hollywood version of true grit.<br>
Something like that.<br>
Anyway, the point is, I went to see Springsteen a week later in Detroit 
proper to give him a second chance. He had shaken the cold by then that 
made him sniff like a junkie throughout his set in Ann Arbor, and he and
 his powerhouse band gave a great rock 'n' roll show. Afterwards, I was 
supposed to meet him, and over the protestations of an overprotective 
publicist (you know who you are), Springsteen invited me along to dinner
 with him and Miami Steve and one or two other of the band members. We 
seemed to be getting along great: loosened up (I'd like to think) by two
 beers (Remember? He doesn't drink or take drugs, Time told us), 
Springsteen spun some terrific stories about the agony of recording Born
 To Run, real tearjerkers about not being able to finish the damn thing 
and every night going back to his girlfriend at the hotel and almost 
crying. Great stuff.<br>
I fell in love.<br>
When Springsteen jumps on the roof of his publicist's car, I later 
report in my article about the romance ("Bruce Springsteen Is Not God 
And Doesn't Want to Be," CREEM, January '76—get it now!), I laugh. It's 
the kind of wanton nonsense I expect from Rock 'n' Roll Kings. And 
furthermore, I climbed aboard the Springsteen publicity bandwagon. (Next
 stop: backlash.) About the same time as the interview, Bom To Run made 
it to number one on the charts, even—despite what Time and Newsweek 
might have you believe about the title cut—without a hit single. Which 
is a big step towards fulfilling all the media's proclamations of 
"superstar" (Newsweek). Though, as it has become readily apparent to me 
from talking to him, Springsteen could care less. He'd like to make 
money, sure, and be comfortable, but this hype and this superstar 
nonsense is too much. (In the spring of last year, before his first 
performance in London, he is caught tearing down some "Future of Rock 
'n' Roll" posters in the lobby of the hall.)<br>
But my conversion is further confirmed when, a month and a half after 
our talk in Detroit, I'm walking down New York's fabled Eighth Street 
one evening and I'm accosted—in a friendly sort of way—by this 
collegiate-looking beard in a pinstriped shirt and pea coat who 
initially I take to be some long-forgotten asshole from high school. 
Only when I catch the glint of a little gold post in his ear do I put 
together the sinuous sleaze and the face.<br>
"Springsteen!" I shout, in surprise and embarrassment. And he keeps 
going on, friendly as ever, shuffling back and forth in the cold, one 
hand in his pocket, the other arm around Karen Darvin, his slender, shy,
 redheaded girlfriend. I presumed that he was pleased with me for one 
reason.<br>
"So you read the article?" I say.<br>
"No," he responded quizzically. "What? Where?" I tell him and we depart.
 He heads for the nearby newsstand. Did I say humble? Friendly? No 
pretentions whatsoever? I mean, this guy has been on the covers of Time 
and Newsweek.<br>
My love grows.<br>
Back in Detroit, three or four months later, I'm elated to find that 
Springsteen will be playing Lansing, about an hour and a half away. But,
 as it turns out, I'm unable to go to the concert because I have to work
 that night. I send along a note with friends that reads: "Go back to 
Jersey." The next day the phone message on my desk reads "B.S. called, 
wouldn't leave his name," and included a Cleveland phone number. I 
called. I didn't recognize the voice that answered, maybe because I 
don't believe that you call phone numbers and get rock stars instead of 
an endless stream of rock Nubians.<br>
Indeed, the "regeneration of rock" himself has answered his phone, and 
is trying to convince me to catch the show there the next night.<br>
The next day Springsteen and I and Peter Laughner are cruising Cleveland
 in Laughner's marginal automobile (B.S. has foregone the CBS rental 
car), with the oldies station on per Springsteen's request. In the 
meantime, Bruce elaborates on that great and largely unexamined group of
 musicians in rock 'n' roll known as Frat Bands, who include, among 
others, Hot Nuts and the Kingsmen ("Louie, Louie"), with special notice 
to the Swinging Medallions. Man, that was a band! (They did "Double Shot
 of My Baby's Love.")<br>
The concert, as expected, creased the roof—I mean, what do you expect 
from a Swinging Medallions fan—and Springsteen added a new unfinished 
ballad called "Frankie." There's a brief postconcert party—brief, 
because these guys do it all onstage—then Bruce Springsteen and the E<br>
Street Band are off in their bus, about which—well, the bus is one notch
 above the worst leaky Trailways you've ever been on, not something your
 average "Superstar" travels in (Johnny Rodriguez moves around in a 
five-bedroom, TV, stereo, bar, motel-on-wheels), more along the lines of
 a bus the Swinging Medallions might have used. <br>
In Wallingford, Connecticut, one of those adorable New England towns 
outside of New Haven, they have an institution called the Choate School.
 It's a fine prep school that boasts among its alumni John Kennedy and 
Robert Frost, but basically, like all prep schools, it's a 24-hour 
live-in day care center for the teenage children of the wealthy. It's 
May now, and I have just moved to New York from Detroit, when the phone 
rings one Friday, and a publicist friend at Columbia asks if I want to 
see Springsteen in Connecticut.<br>
"Where?" I inquired.<br>
"Choate," comes the unusual answer. Which takes me somewhat aback. The 
adorably quaint New Englandy Choate is just not my idea of a booking for
 Asbury Park's first cover boy. As it turns out, there are extraordinary
 motives at work.<br>
John Hammond has asked Bruce to do the show.<br>
John Hammond is retiring from Columbia after some 30 years as an A8R man
 (aka talent scout). John Hammond is the man who got recording contracts
 for Billie Holliday, Benny Goodman, Aretha Franklin, and Bob Dylan. In 
other words, this paper is too light to hold the reputation of Hammond 
and the respect accorded him in the music business. To top it off, John 
Hammond is an incredibly amiable polite person.<br>
And to top all that off, John also signed Bruce Springsteen to Columbia.
 (He told Newsweek for the cover story: "The kid absolutely knocked me 
out. I only hear somebody good every 10 years, and not only is Bruce the
 best, he was a lot better than Dylan when I first heard him.") In other
 words, were Bruce Springsteen the coldest-hearted bastard on the face 
of the earth, if John Hammond asked him for a favor for his (Hammond's) 
old school, he would do it, no questions asked.<br>
In the past 18 months I've seen Springsteen perform about 18 times, in 
all imaginable circumstances. I've seen him perform in New York, Detroit
 and Cleveland in halls for the money. I saw him do a few numbers at the
 Crawdaddy’s 10th anniversary party, and absolutely rivet the crowd. But
 I have never seen him, before or since, play like he did at Choate. And
 it certainly wasn't the audience—they loved him but expressed their 
love primarily by sitting in their seats, clapping their hands and 
wiping ketchup off their ties. Granted the Asbury gig with Southside was
 for love and fun, but it was Johnny's show, so Bruce laid off. When, 
after two and a half hours a totally exhausted, sweat-drenched 
Springsteen crashed into "Rosalita," it was clear that he wasn't getting
 paid. "This one's for John Hammond," he said. That's all. The fact that
 this may have been one of the greatest rock 'n' roll shows of all time 
ever is the purest tribute one could pay to Springsteen. He did it for 
love.<br>
STOP.<br>
The attitude was I can do rock 'n' roll like a motherfucker and this is 
how I do it. Thank-you-John Hammond-for-knowing-that. He never let up. 
At the end, if you knew him, you'd realize that here was a man capable 
of a chilling generosity to an audience and an art form. The man is 
fucking rock 'n' roll.<br>
Which is why he's not the rock 'n' roll savior. Because more than 
anything these days, rock 'n' roll is run like a sausage factory. Give 
us the three-minute sausage and smile, you bastards. While no one mourns
 the stinking hippies, and their 45-minute jumbled jams or the 
psychedelic posters, the three-minute sausage is not what it's about, 
either. It's about diabolical abandonment and humor. It's about wanting 
to rip your shoes in half, it's so good. Listen to "Born To Run." It's 
about that. It's about crazy.<br>
It's about not writing stories about guys like Bruce Springsteen. Which is why the motherfucker took me so long.<br>
I'll tell you what I think about Bruce. He's a road musician now, like 
he should be. Like he essentially wants to be. He's a working stiff in 
rock 'n' roll. Nothing highfalutin. No analysis. No cover stories. No 
tell-me-what-you-meant.<br>
I'll tell you what will happen to him. No matter the outcome of all this
 bullshit litigation, he will continue on the road. He will continue to 
write songs and he will be pretty fucking healthy and happy— because he 
doesn't take drugs or crap, he takes rock 'n' roll. And someday all the 
legal crap will be over (if it isn't by the time you read this). And 
someday he'll make the best rock 'n' roll album of all time. It may not 
be the next one or the one after, but someday. He can wait. I can wait. 
We have no choice. This man is the first rock 'n' roll musician I've 
ever met or read about or heard about or anything that could be a rock 
'n' roll musician the rest of his life and still come up with something 
great when he's 70. This guy is a student (OK, I know), but most of all 
he's a lover. With a giant rock 'n' roll dick.—</div>

By Bill Flanagan<br>
Point Blank Magazine<br>
1988</strong><br>
<br>
Flanagan: You said once that a story’s only good if it’s in some way your own story. To what degree are your songs you story?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Well, the details are obviously different. The ol’ names 
have been changed to protect the innocent. It would vary; some songs 
would be autobiographical or very close. They’re all emotionally yours. 
They’re part of your emotional life and in that sense, you could say the
 songs are all yours. In the sense of the detail that you hang the 
emotions on – that’ll vary. I’ll go out and meet a kid in a bar and 
something about him will give me an idea for a song. I guess if you 
traced from the beginning to the end of the live record, that’s pretty 
much my story. It’s not my complete story, but you’d get a pretty good 
idea of the past ten years, just the stuff that I’ve been going through 
in my own life.<br>
I don’t know if I play characters, but I write in different characters. 
It’s kind of a twofold thing. If you write in or through another 
character, part of it is you get the audience to walk in somebody else’s
 shoes for a while. Which is good. And sometimes it gives you the 
distance necessary to tell a particular story, which if you told in the 
first person would come off sounding either too much or maybe too 
sentimental. It’s also a technique, and it works like that.<br>
To make it real you have to have some enormous piece of yourself in it. 
For it to be just believable, credible, to create a character that is 
living and breathing. If I sit down to write a song, that is what I want
 to do. And I’ve always done that best when I’ve had a good deal of 
myself, and the things that are at stake in my own life, in the music. 
And I’ve always done it most poorly if I fell back on a device or 
something where I just didn’t get it, where I didn’t get to the well, 
you know? I’ll write something sometimes and I’ll think, “Well, gee, 
that’s kind of clever,” or “It plays with words a certain way.” I always
 throw that stuff out. It never makes it to the record.<br>
To me a song begins when you create the living, breathing human being. 
And that goes for whether it’s “Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow” or something else. 
That’s its sense of aliveness. That is the essential thing I got from 
rock &amp; roll – a sense of aliveness, a sense of vitality, a sense 
that there is life somewhere. And that’s what I look for in my music: Is
 there somebody in there when I write a song? Have I made this person 
real? To me that’s the essential thing. And to do it you don’t have to 
write fancily or intellectually. It’s in “Twist and Shout;” it’s in 
anything that has impact. I think it has impact because some sense of 
life, sense of living, and sense of the possibilities of life and living
 has been communicated. And it’s never been better than in a song like 
“Twist and Shout.” That record! To me that’s just a great, great song. 
Very difficult to write!<br>
Chuck Berry created great characters. Which I’m sure had to be part of 
him and part of what he imagined. Like he said, he was writing all them 
high school songs when he was thirty-two! But he knew what it was about.
 His thing was fantastic – tremendous use of detail. Which in my later 
writing particularly is something I’ve really tried to work on, to get 
better at. Because I admire his music and that unbelievable sense of 
detail that would bring the whole verse alive.<br>
<br>
Flanagan: What’s an example of a song where you fell back on craft, on a device?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Oh, God. Let me think. I don’t have a pure example of it 
‘cause I figure for the most part I’ve thrown them out…I wrote “She’s 
the One” [Born to Run] because I wanted to hear Clarence play the sax in
 that solo (laughs). I sort of went back and wrote the words to it just 
‘cause I wanted to hear that beat and hear Clarence play that. That’s 
kind of a reverse way of doing it, so maybe that one. But most of the 
stuff ends up on the floor because it’s all pretty obviously bad. It’s 
just not exciting and it’s not compelling. Now things can be compelling 
just musically. On “She’s the One” I wanted that sax solo and I wanted 
the guys to play the beat and I had a production idea, and so it was 
operating on a different level, and there’s a lot of stuff that works 
like that. I think that later on I tended to get a little more 
lyric-oriented first. So even something like “Glory Days” [Born in the 
U.S.A], which I thought was a good dance record, I sang on acoustic 
guitar and tried to make sure that the people in that song were solidly 
there.<br>
<br>
Flanagan: For “She’s the One” you actually pulled lines from your old 
songs: “French cream won’t soften them boots / And French kisses will 
not break that heart” is from “Hey Santa Ana.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Oh, yeah! All those early songs. Sometimes I’ll have a 
couple of lines that can sit around for four or five years. I knew they 
were good lines but they never found exactly the right setting. In those
 days I used to switch and trade all the time. You could do it with a 
lot of that stuff. I do it a little bit now, but not as much as I used 
to. It still happens on occasion.<br>
<br>
Flanagan: Like “I got debts that no honest man could pay” showing up in both “Atlantic City” and “Johnny 99” (Nebraska).<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Yeah. That was just two songs I wrote and happened to use 
the same line in. Then when we decided that the [Nebraska demo] tape was
 what was the best record of the thing, there we were. But what I would 
do normally is go back and rewrite one of the lines in one of the songs 
(laughs). That wasn’t done intentionally.<br>
<br>
Flanagan: Ever worry that a song’s too personal? Will you change details so you won’t get nailed for it?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: It would depend on if it was good or not. If it was a good 
song and I made it work… well, I suppose you have some inner protective 
mechanism that is operating all the time that keeps you from putting out
 stuff that’s too much. And I’m generally a too much person. It just 
depends on if the song is right or not. I guess I’ve written some 
personal music, and if the song is real good it’s okay. If it’s a good 
song and you’ve treated it correctly. I mean, if it’s personal to the 
point where it’s just terribly, horribly sentimental…I go for sentiment;
 I think there’s a moment to be sentimental. The end of the live record 
was a time like that; I said, let’s end it with “Tenth Avenue 
Freeze-Out” and “Jersey Girl.” That was not a moment to be afraid of 
sentiment. So there’s a place for that. But I think you draw different 
lines at different times. If it was like, “Ooh” (makes pained face), if 
it embarrassed you terribly it would just be a bad song.<br>
I guess I’ve written some real personal song: the songs I’ve written 
about my father. Even if they’re not all exactly autobiographical, they 
have a feeling of the relationship. “My Father’s House” [Nebraska] is a 
personal song. I guess you just find a way to do it. Generally, if I 
came across that problem it just meant I hadn’t done it very well. I 
hadn’t written a very good song.<br>
<br>
Flanagan: What’s your father’s reaction to those songs?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: My relationship with him has changed a lot. Actually since I
 got out of the house, it changed almost overnight. It was very 
interesting. He changed a whole lot, and I did. I guess we were not 
people who talked directly about those sorts of things. And maybe that’s
 how I was doing it. He is not somebody who would show a reaction in one
 fashion or another. In a funny way, and certainly not the best way, the
 air kind of cleared. Some of the stuff I’ve written was pretty close, 
like the [monologue] I did on the top of “The River” on the live record.
 So that ended up being the way that I dealt with it. I did ask him once
 what were his favorite songs, and he said “The ones that are about me.”
 (Laughs). He was kind of laughing when he said it, so I don’t know. 
Like I say, it’s probably not the best way to find your way through the 
woods on those sorts of things, but it was part of the way it happened 
for me and him.<br>
I guess our relationship is a lot more direct now. So it’s a good thing.
 But it’s always hedging, y’know? I guess I did it as a way of making 
sense out of the whole thing to myself, and I figured, well, maybe 
somebody else won’t follow the exact same path. We had a lot of 
unnecessary distance for a long time. But it’s been really great for 
quite a while now. But, hey, fathers and sons.<br>
<br>
Flanagan: Your images of tough or angry little kids are pretty memorable
 – from “The Angel” (Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J) to “Used Cars” 
(Nebraska).<br>
<br>
Springsteen: I guess “Used Cars” was pretty autobiographical. My mother 
always loves that one. My parents love that song ‘cause we just had so 
much car trouble! It was beyond belief. We had some bad cars. I remember
 my dad had this one car that wouldn’t go in reverse and we constantly 
had to push it backwards out of parking places. The whole of Nebraska 
was the tone of what my youth felt like to me. From when I was a little 
kids to my early teens. That song just kind of popped out.<br>
<br>
Flanagan: Long ago you said you didn’t want to get married ‘cause you 
weren’t ready to write married songs. You knew this would come back to 
haunt you. Have you written any married songs yet?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: I’m workin’ on ‘em. (Laughs). It’s just another part of 
life. For a long time there were a whole lot of things I was trying to 
avoid. Part of it because I thought, “If I don’t do this and I don’t do 
that, well, maybe I won’t get older.” And at the same time I pursued a 
certain course that I hoped would help me learn how to grow and remain 
intact.<br>
That’s a funny quote, but that was exactly the size of it, that was 
exactly how I felt. Not only did I not…I couldn’t imagine writing any! 
And on the live record, Tom Waits sort of did the job for me. [Waits 
wrote “Jersey Girl.”] So that was a funny thing. But I had certain 
preconceived notions of what I thought the rock &amp; roll dream was 
about. And I was very immersed in it in my early twenties. I guess later
 on I realized that’s only a starting point; the whole thing’s really 
just where you get off at and start going. <br>
If I write a real good song that means something to somebody out there, 
it can only be a starting point for them. Then they have to take it and 
run with it, and I have to do the same thing. What it really asks you to
 do is to take this and find your place in the world. Maybe this’ll be 
helpful. Maybe not. Basically the whole thing is about attempting to be 
useful. So the greatest rock song, no matter what it is – “Like a 
Rolling Stone” or “Twist and Shout” or “Shout” – it’s all just a place 
to get started. It’s not something to live by. Or it’s not something to 
live within. I was at a place where I had certain ideas about the whole 
rock &amp; roll thing that I thought were right, and certain ones that 
were sort of abusive.<br>
I think the whole act of getting married – you’ve got to come in from 
the cold when you get married. This is about a relationship with 
somebody who is outside my work, outside my job. Doesn’t have that much 
to do with playing the guitar (laughs). It’s a little bit of an 
introduction to the real world. I think in a variety of different ways, 
for a quite a few years previous to when I got married, I was going in 
that direction. Not necessarily that marriage is the only thing that 
puts you in that place, but it is one of the things. And I realized that
 you can’t live within that rock &amp; roll dream that I had in my head.
 If you do then you’re really betraying its very promise. You’re 
bullshitting. If you try to, then you become some self-indulgent 
decadent asshole. And it’s not worth it. It’s not a worthwhile thing for
 a man to be involved in.<br>
That’s not in any way devaluing the importance of what that dream is or 
what it implies. But it’s really just a starting point. It’s like when I
 heard “Shout,” or “Having a Party.” “Having a Party” is a fascinating 
record – it always struck me as a very sad record. As I hear the Sam 
Cooke version, it contains a world full of sadness. Just his voice, just
 the singer.<br>
Those songs were really just a place to go from. Then you have to take 
it. Which is why getting caught up in the iconography and all the hero 
worship and idolization of rock stars or movie stars or people who win 
game shows is a distraction. The night I climbed over the wall at Elvis’
 house, I don’t know who I thought I was going to meet. I really wasn’t 
going to meet Elvis. Maybe I was going to meet some dream, or some idea I
 had of myself. And probably the biggest favor that that guard did was 
stop me at the door.<br>
So I think that all the great records and great songs say is, “Hey, take
 this and find your place in the world. Do something with it, do 
anything with it. Find some place to make your stand, no matter how big 
or small it is.” And maybe in some fashion that directs you toward some 
sort of honest life. That’s a pretty wonderful thing for a record to do.
 Particularly since it only costs about ninety-nine cents. [Laughter.] 
Hey, even if it costs seven or eight bucks, it’s still a pretty good 
deal!<br>
That’s why I always felt like playing the guitar – hey, that’s a decent 
job. You can make an honest job out of it. And at this point that’s 
really all I’m interested in. But I had to get out from under my 
misinterpretation of what that whole rock &amp; roll dream was about. It
 took me a long time to do it. Partly because to do it means you have to
 accept death itself. Which is okay, because that’s how you grab ahold 
of life, man, and go. I know a lot of people, even friends of mine, who 
just don’t want to deal with it. It’s too frightening. You have to step 
into the real world.<br>
There was a review in the Village Voice of The River. I don’t even 
remember who wrote that thing but I always remember he said the 
character in “Ramrod,” or different people on the record, were 
attempting to flee from time itself.<br>
The whole rock &amp; roll thing has become such a big thing and has 
meant so much to so many different kinds of people and has taken up such
 an enormous amount of time in people’s lives that it’s real out of 
proportion. There’s a certain loss of perspective to the whole thing. I 
sought rock &amp; roll out of for many contradictory reasons: I wanted a
 refuge, I wanted an escape, I also wanted a weapon. Ultimately, I 
wanted a vehicle for confrontation in some fashion. I think initially it
 was just the joy of pulling me out of my everyday life.<br>
Your interview with Neil [Young] was interesting. You said that the 
thing rock &amp; roll didn’t pick up from country and rhythm &amp; blues
 was the sense of consequences. I guess in my music one of the things I 
wanted to do was provide that set of consequences. You said rock &amp; 
roll was Saturday night and country was Sunday morning. Well, I wanted 
Saturday night and Sunday morning – but I also wanted Monday through 
Friday! And particularly in the stuff I was writing later on, that was 
where it was all set. Because there’s a lot more Monday through Fridays 
than there are Saturday nights or Sunday mornings. And those are the 
days you’ve got to live with. Those are the days everybody’s got to live
 with. So I wanted a music to live with – truth and consequences! 
(Laughs.)<br>
I felt like if I was going to move on, if I was going to take this stuff
 with me, it was going to have to answer those questions for me. It was 
going to have to make sense of my life now. And the thing that I found 
in “Be My Baby” is not going to answer the questions that come up when I
 have to deal with my wife now, or she has to deal with me. Not that 
that is lost. That’s a part of it, it’s a piece of it.<br>
<br>
Flanagan: Deciding to let the dream live inside you, instead of you living inside the dream.<br>
<br>
Springsteen: That’s exactly the size of it. And I think at the moment in
 ’75 when my dream in its own funny way came true, I had to deal with 
the consequences. At that particular moment I realized I did not want to
 live inside it. There was nothing there except an empty room. There 
weren’t many other people there. Now my job was to find my way out of 
it. Because that was the only way I was going to be worth anything to 
anybody, including myself. That was the only way that I was going to be 
able to maintain my own vitality and life.<br>
Once you’re inside that dream room, things about you that are important 
and relevant in the real world to your friends – and people who will 
hear your music – will just strangle and die. And so will you. But it’s 
very difficult because that room is always very comfortable and there’s 
an illusion of safety. There is an illusion of security which is all 
really an illusion. It’s really a very dangerous place. There is little 
safety there. There’s no real security there and there’s no life there. 
There’s really nothing. So then you’ve got to create something else. In 
my writing after Born to Run I’ve been trying to find that alternative: 
Where does the man with the guitar fit? Where’s my place in the world? I
 guess that’s all anybody’s trying to do really, no matter what their 
job is.<br>
<br>
Flanagan: A lot of these ideas show up in even your earliest songs: the 
character in “Lost in the Flood” (Greetings) or Spanish Johnny, who sees
 the barefoot street boys kissing each other and just doesn’t get it, 
can’t figure out the changed in his world.<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Yeah, I guess you can go back and find that stuff on the 
early records. It’s not even a result of being successful, or being a 
famous guy who plays the guitar. It’s something that people wrestle with
 their entire lives, no matter what their job is. Everybody has a choice
 whether to stay in that dream room or go out and build something that’s
 real. You can stay in there real easy. All you need is a six-pack of 
beer and a television set. You can just let yourself go in there. I 
guess that particular moment was my moment of confrontation with it, but
 it’s not a unique or unusual situation for anybody.<br>
<br>
Flanagan: In “Prove It All Night” (Darkness on the Edge of Town), you 
talked about knowing “what it means to steal, to cheat, to lie.” You 
touched on similar emotions in “The Price You Pay” (The River). It 
seemed you were forcing your audience to acknowledge a dark side of you.
 Was that a reaction to all the hoopla and hero worship that surrounded 
Born to Run?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: It was a reaction. I guess the Darkness record and the 
other records since Born to Run have been a reaction to that particular 
moment I had there: I crashed into myself. Previously we’d had a pretty 
free-floating thing going. We banged around in a station wagon or a van 
and played in clubs, and I got tremendous satisfaction out of doing that
 and enjoyed it immensely. I was single; for twenty-three it wasn’t bad,
 y’know? Darkness was when I realized that it’s a nice way to make a 
living but it’s no way to live, and I realized that…I was unusual….and I
 had something…<br>
Like I say, I had the guitar and the girl. I just crashed into one of 
the walls of the dream room. That really is what it’s about. I just 
realized, “Wait! There’s walls!” And that I was inside something. And I 
had to bust out of there, and the way to do it was, I needed some 
solidarity. If that guy on Born to Run did get away, he had to go back. 
He had to! ‘Cause that’s where the people are. That’s where everybody 
was! And basically I just wanted to be there. Just for myself. Not for 
any other reason.<br>
It’s a funny thing. I was alone and I got very used to being alone. I 
could live that way, or I had been able to Pretty easily. But there was a
 little bit of time running out on that idea and I had to see what was 
happening, what was going on, to be a part of what was going on. And I 
think that “Badlands,” that whole Darkness record, was about that. I 
wanted to come back and confront some things. What had happened after 
Born to Run? Where were my friends? Where were the people that mattered 
to me? My frivolous little trip – okay, it was fun, but in and of itself
 it just didn’t hold enough to keep me very fascinated. And I had the 
experience of watching the ones that went before. There were maps. And 
when a lot of them got to that place they read, “Dead end.” So you’ve 
got to backtrack and find a different road, one that may be passable. 
You can’t set up a house at the end of that dead-end street. I believed 
that didn’t have to happen, I believed that it could go on. The thing 
that had sustained me and given me inspiration and strength and support 
when I was a child could do the same for me as a man. If I could figure 
out a way to find it for myself. I believed that the things that 
happened to me, the perversions of life, the distortions of living that 
come with success, were truly distortions. And if you could see through 
that clearly enough, and the things that were contradictory and 
paradoxical maybe are not resolvable, but if you could just learn enough
 to not let them drive you crazy – then you could look clearly enough 
into the eyes of the guy across the street or your wife or your 
girlfriend and have something to say to them. And they could say 
something back.<br>
Really, I picked up the guitar because I wanted to talk to somebody. 
That’s really about the size of it. That was my main interest. I had 
things to say, and mainly it was just, “Hey, hello. Here I am, there you
 are. Let’s start a band, let’s do something together.”<br>
So when I got out there I realized, “Who is there to really talk to, and
 what have I got to say? If I get jammed up out here, what am I going to
 have to say that’s worth listening to?”<br>
A lot of fun comes with it, a lot of good things, but mainly the guy 
goes back to town because it’s lonely out there. There’s not enough out 
there. There’s not enough in the dream room. You come out because you 
want to talk to somebody. You’re bored and you’re lonely. And not only 
that but you have an idea. I developed an intent over the years that 
I’ve been in rock bands: that you didn’t have to come apart, you didn’t 
have to fall apart. And there are ways to deal with distortion of life 
that becomes a part of your life once you get there. If you just solidly
 and with some real thought put your energies in that direction, it can 
be done, and it should be done.<br>
I just wanted to talk to somebody. I wanted to be part of something. And
 if the end result is that you’ve got nothing to say, and that you’re in
 some isolated dream place, well then you just didn’t do it. (Laughs.) 
You didn’t do it! And I didn’t see any reason why that had to be. So 
beginning with the Darkness record, and on through, I’ve been trying to 
see (laughs) what a band would sound like with a swinging little guitar 
man.<br>
That’s me. That’s kind of how I see myself: I’m the guitar player. 
What’s it sound like out there with a guitar player? I guess it’s kind 
of a big idea on one hand, but it also just feels like common sense.<br>
A friend of mine said the other, “I get in bed at night and feel like 
I’ve had an honest day.” That’s a pretty good thing to have. It’s a 
pretty hard thing to come by and it’s hard to hold onto. The whole thing
 was such a powerful force in my own life that I just wanted to hang in 
there.<br>
“What’s everybody else doing?” Maybe that’s why. Plus, I think at the 
time I was fearful of disconnection. And I felt like there was a moment 
of truth. Well, really there isn’t any moment of truth – there’s moments
 of truth. But at the time I felt fearful. I had a tremendous mistrust 
of my own success and the things it brought with it, because I 
recognized these things as powerful. And I think that in a funny way 
those impulses probably made me dive more intensely into the stuff 
that’s on Darkness than I would have if I’d had just a moderately 
successful record. First of all I felt in a position of privilege, and I
 felt that with that came responsibility. Didn’t have to worry about the
 rent and heat now. I did it enough so I knew what it was about, and I 
saw my parents do it their whole lives. And I thought, “Well, now I 
don’t have to do it.” And maybe I felt like who I was there, at that 
moment, was where the best of me lay.<br>
I think that there probably are some funny songs to write about flying 
in Lear jets (laughs) or limousines. But all I know is, when I got to 
that place I felt that the action was back in town, in neighborhoods. 
And I was still basically there myself. I hadn’t really gone anyplace. I
 was still in Jersey. I lived on a farm most of that time.<br>
That just seemed to be where the action was, that seemed to be where the
 things that were important were. I mean yeah, you can get a laugh out 
of writing something about…<br>
<br>
Flanagan: A pink Cadillac?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Yeah. That’s fun. But it’s not something to make a career out of.<br>
<br>
Flanagan: Because you’re so well-know, you can distance yourself from a 
song or project yourself further into a song just by choosing a detail. 
For example, when you said, “I get up in the evening,” instead of 
“morning,” in “Dancing in the Dark” (Born in the U.S.A), it was like a 
flag saying “This is really about me.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Yeah, that was an interesting thing because originally that
 song was, “I wake up in the morning.” Jon (Landau) had been bothering 
me to write a single, which is something he rarely does. But he did that
 day. And he wanted something direct. That seemed to be what he was 
hitting on me for at the time. I was angry. I had written a lot of songs
 and was kind of fed with the whole thing. We’d been making the record 
for a long time and I was bored with the whole situation. That 
particular night I came home and sat on the edge of my bed and the thing
 I remember thinking first was that we had a record, but it wasn’t 
necessarily finished; I could change the whole thing right now if I 
wanted to. That’s all I remember thinking: if I wanted to I could do 
something right now that would change the whole thing.<br>
So I picked up the guitar and I had this line: “I get up in the morning 
and I ain’t got nothing to say.” I had that line for quite a while. Then
 I said, well, I’ve got to be direct, this is about me. What do I do? “I
 get up in the evening.” And that was it. The rest of the song popped 
out. I realized I’m bored, I’m tired, I’m sick of no action.<br>
Making a record tends to be a lot of mind work. Sometimes I like that, 
but I’m also oriented toward doing things and playing. How many times 
can you look at the same thing from a different angle? On one hand, the 
analytical side of my personality has been very helpful in learning, 
because I always question what I’m doing and look at it from every 
possible position, and then I change it. I’m somebody who has tremendous
 swings. I’ll do that for a long time and then I’ll swing toward a tour 
that’ll go for a year and a half and I’m out there going crazy every 
night, and then I’ll swing way back. I’ve never really balanced those 
things in a natural fashion. I do one till I want to explode and then 
bang! I’ll contain all this energy for a long time and I’ll let it loose
 and then I’ll exhaust myself. Then I’ll go back to the other thing and 
wait till I feel that way again. It provides a certain sort of 
motivation, but it doesn’t seem to be a way to live. We’ve done it a 
little extremely in that the tours have all been super-long, very 
intense, a lot of activity. And then the time off has been long also. 
I’d like to balance that out a little better in the future.<br>
<br>
Flanagan: Do you have a particular person you write for?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: No, not really. When I write it’s for whoever’s out there, 
whoever wants to listen. When I go on stage, I always remember being at a
 Who concert at Convention Hall in Asbury Park in ’65. When I come out 
on stage I always imagine a kid there. It’s different now because when 
we go out now I see a guy who was there when he was nineteen, ten years 
ago, and he’s got a kid on his shoulders and his wife with him. And then
 there’s some sixteen-, seventeen-year-old kids there. So it’s a little 
different now, but I generally think, “Maybe there’s a fifteen-year-old 
kid here who’s thinking of playing the guitar. Maybe he has some ideas. 
And tonight I’ve got to be at my best, I’ve got to be better than I ever
 was. ‘Cause I want to inspire that guy. It don’t matter if I was good 
last night or how I’m going to be the next night.” So that’s real good. 
It keeps me right in the moment.<br>
<br>
Flanagan: In “Nebraska” you sing in the voice of a killer. Did you think
 twice about creating sympathy for someone who maybe doesn’t deserve 
any?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Who doesn’t deserve sympathy? (Laughs). It’s not a question
 of sympathy or compassion; it’s more a question of what does writing 
about that sort of incident imply? It’s a funny question because 
basically, in the end, I was probably using Charlie Starkweather to 
write about myself (laughs) for the most part. If you look at a book 
like [Norman Mailer’s] Executioner’s Song, you can say, “Does just 
writing about something in some fashion glamorize or romanticize it?” I 
don’t know. I think every time you write a song like that, it’s a 
question. I guess when I wrote that song I felt pretty down, so I went 
with it.<br>
<br>
Flanagan: On that old demo “If I Was the Priest,” Jesus is coming after 
you with a gun. All through your work there’s the feeling of God chasing
 you and you saying, “Get back!” Other songwriters have the hellhound on
 their trail, but you’re usually fleeing the Hound of Heaven.<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Probably (laughs). I just had all that stuff on my ass when
 I was growing up. It’s interesting, because once I graduated grammar 
school I demanded to go to public school. My parents wanted me to go to 
Catholic high school, and I’d just had it up to here. The whole thing 
wasn’t working for me. Can’t say I ever looked at the songs in that 
light, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s in there because once I got 
out of grammar school I just wanted to be left alone by all the orthodox
 ideas. I suppose I found my own way around it. But just the heavy sale,
 the hard sell, the pressure, and all the stuff you see on the TV. Maybe
 it works for some people. Obviously it does. There’s people that are 
saved. I’d just as soon have a different way to go.<br>
I don’t really sit back and judge that particular situation at all. 
Faith is such a personal thing… whatever brings you that particular 
faith in yourself I think is important, but I’m really pretty outside 
that whole thing. That just didn’t seem to be it for me. Once I pulled 
myself out from the Catholic school in the fifties – a notorious 
experience – finding that place in some orthodox religious situation is 
just not something that came to me, or even an approach I would take 
toward solving my own particular problems or questions about what life 
is about.<br>
I guess for me it’s all the unanswered things that are important. It’s 
the holes – the mysteries – that seem to be where it is! That’s where it
 is in songwriting. It’s when you don’t know how you wrote that song 
that you’ve probably written a good one. I guess I always felt that sort
 of direct contact with whatever you believe God is, or to believe you 
know exactly what it is – “It’s Catholic and it’s not Jewish,” or “It’s 
Jewish and it’s not Fundamentalist; this is all there is to it” – that’s
 living inside the dream. For me, that’s living in the dream room. How 
could anybody ever get to the true nature of what spirituality is by 
believing that if you don’t have the green card or you don’t have the 
red card you’re going to be left out? That seems, just on the face of 
it, totally ridiculous. Not to mention just the presumptuousness of 
feeling that you know exactly! That very literal translating of the 
Bible and the belief that, “This is it, this is all there is, and don’t 
try to step outside this thing!” always seemed a little presumptuous. I 
don’t see that sort of arrogance – to believe you’ve got the inside dope
 on what the word of God is – would line up with some sort of real 
spiritual feeling.<br>
People use the cloak of spirituality as a controlling device. That just 
strikes me as false. Basically that’s how it was used on me as a child. 
There was not an interest in bringing me closer to what God really is. 
It was really used purely as a controlling device, by people who had had
 it used on them in that fashion. By the time I got to be thirteen, I’d 
had enough. I just told my parents, “No more!” And I always felt like 
that spiritual thing has run through all my music. Certainly “Born to 
Run” is, “Nebraska.” But to me it’s in the mysteries and the holes that 
the whole thing seems to lie. And that’s fine with me. That feels right 
to me.<br>
<br>
Flanagan: No outside force ever damaged the Catholic Church as much as superstitious nuns and bad teachers.<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Yeah, and it’s been spoiled for them also. So it’s a shame.
 It’s the perversion of religion and spirituality into superstition. 
That’s what it was for me. I’m sure other people have other experiences.
 I suppose it’s a shame that mine was such a negative one. So now I go 
down my own road. But I know people who have gotten a lot out of it, and
 people who have had similar experiences to mine and still get 
sustenance from it. I’m pretty open about the whole thing at this point.
 I don’t feel the need to define myself in that fashion. The closest you
 can get to what I feel about it is in my music.<br>
<br>
Flanagan: A lot of people who reach your position turn to religion: 
Elvis, the Beatles, Dylan, Michael Jackson, Prince. It seems like once 
you become the Man at the Top, it’s the only place to go.<br>
<br>
Springsteen: I think it’s ‘cause people demand too many answers. I can’t
 speak for what it was like in their particular cases ‘cause I don’t 
know. But in general, people demand answers. And in a funny way it’s 
very childish. A child wants his daddy to know everything. I suppose a 
strictly literal interpretation of holy books at least provides you with
 an illusion of those things. Maybe that’s enough for some people. Maybe
 the illusion of those things is what they’re going to live with. But I 
think the demand for those answers is arrogant. What do you need all the
 answers for?<br>
I think there are people who reached a moment where their lives weren’t 
working and the things that they thought would give them satisfaction 
did not, or did not bring peace of mind. Maybe people find it difficult 
to live with the idea that that very peace of mind involves the 
acceptance of just letting things be. So the natural thing to do is look
 around. And if you say, “I need an answer for this,” there are plenty 
of people who will give you one. “I got it right over here – it’s 
$29.95, it slices, it dices!” There’s points in people’s lives when they
 need that concreteness. There can be a point when that’s necessary. 
I’ve met people who have been on hard drugs who were saved through 
fundamentalist religion, were saved by Jesus. They really were. They 
really were. Now, once again, that’s a starting point-<br>
I guess it depends on what people’s needs are. I never felt a need for 
that particular sort of concreteness. Maybe I’m lucky. Me, I like it 
wide open. I got to places where things weren’t working for me and my 
old ideas had broken down because I’d outgrown them, but I still did not
 want to move on because of what it implied. If you outgrow an idea it’s
 got to mean you’re growing up, you’re getting old. I think people get 
to a place where their old ideas stop working, and moving on is always 
frightening. To really be alive you have to be constantly moving on into
 the unknown. You have to move out into that dark. And what you have for
 comfort is your wife, maybe your friends, a body of work, something 
you’ve done that you’re proud of. Your only comfort is going to be your 
connection with those things. And then you attempt to extend some sort 
of line out into some sort of community. That’s why people huddle 
together.<br>
And that makes sense. Because you’ve got to constantly be stepping out 
into that dark, into that unknown place. ‘Cause that’s where the next 
day is.</div>

"Springsteen's solo tour gives 'Devils' its due"<br>
By John Soeder</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
The "BROOOCE!" cheers gave way to BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! when Bruce 
Springsteen launched his solo tour last month at Detroit's Fox Theatre.<br>
<br>
Pounding out a 4/4 beat with his boot, the Boss wailed into a harmonica 
and howled into a miniature microphone. What sounded at first like a 
gritty old blues tune turned out to be a Mississippi Delta-style 
overhaul of "Reason to Believe," a declaration of hard-earned faith 
originally found on Springsteen's 1982 album "Nebraska."<br>
His new one-man show is full of surprises - and it suits him.<br>
"It's a great night for me," Springsteen said during a recent phone 
interview. "It's just you, your audience, your ideas, your music."<br>
Accompanying himself on acoustic and electric guitars and even piano at 
times, the iconic singer-songwriter has been mixing old favorites in 
concert with a hefty serving of material from his latest solo album.<br>
By turns unsettling and uplifting, "Devils &amp; Dust" is a collection 
of songs about moral crises, new beginnings and the hopes and fears of 
everyday people in uncertain times. The music ranges from roots-rock to 
folk to country.<br>
Springsteen is promoting "Devils &amp; Dust" with a 14-date U.S. tour, 
including a show tonight at Cleveland State University Wolstein Center.<br>
One of the few props keeping him company onstage is an antique lamp. 
Sharp-eyed fans might recognize it from a video for his new album's 
title track.<br>
Springsteen, 55, shed light on the lamp -- and weightier topics ranging 
from his endorsement of John Kerry for president to the future of the E 
Street Band -- when we spoke to him before a gig in Oakland, Calif.<br>
<br>
OK, first things first: What's the deal with the lamp?<br>
<br>
It's the magic lamp! (laugh) All energy emerges from the lamp! We just had it in the video, so I brought it along.<br>
It was in my house. We thought, "Let's bring that lamp and put it onstage." There's no special story behind it.<br>
It went crashing to the floor last night, however. I was stomping really
 hard. I stomped it right off the table, onto the floor. There's a big 
dent in it, but we got it back up and running.<br>
<br>
You've said the songs on "Devils &amp; Dust" deal with people whose 
souls are at risk. Did you try to stick to the same theme when choosing 
compatible songs from your previous albums to perform on this tour?<br>
<br>
No. I don't operate from the outside in. I'm usually operating from what
 feels right. Later on, I'll go back and I may make the connections, and
 I'll be able to say, "Oh, I ended up doing this."<br>
<br>
You have your 30 years of craft and you call on it, and it all works, 
hopefully, in this very integrated fashion and in a way that is not 
fundamentally an intellectual exercise. The emotions and your feelings 
are always leading the way.<br>
I may read something in a book or in a newspaper or see it in a movie. 
Somebody may say something -- anything that sparks that particular 
creative light. Then I'll follow that.<br>
That's my approach to songwriting.<br>
As far as putting a record together, once again, you go on what feels 
right. Regardless of how detailed the lyrics are, you're always being 
led by what the songs are saying emotionally.<br>
On this particular record, the main thing I was looking for was just the best record I had at that moment.<br>
I had a year off. Patti [Scialfa, Springsteen's wife and mother of their
 three children] worked on her record ["23rd Street Lullaby"] and went 
touring. So I spent a lot of time with the kids.<br>
I said, "Gee, I have good music that I was interested in before I started to work again with the E Street Band."<br>
I had all these songs that were holding up well. I was interested in those characters.<br>
All the stuff was recorded in about a take or two.<br>
I've been lucky in that I've had a lot of good material the past eight or nine years.<br>
<br>
After my review of "Devils &amp; Dust" ran, I got an e-mail from an 
angry reader who found it "outrageous" for you to deliver the title 
track from the perspective of a soldier in Iraq. The reader wrote, "You 
have to be in the soldiers' shoes to express [their] point of view . . .
 and the Boss sure doesn't speak for them." How would you respond?<br>
<br>
As a writer and as a citizen, you take in the world around you, and you take your shot at interpreting it.<br>
That was a song where I was basically trying to get at . . . some of the
 confusion that being young and being put in that position have to bring
 you. The confirmation of it is in the newspapers every day.<br>
You're put in a situation of making difficult and impossible choices 
that I believe even the best training can prepare you for only so much, 
which is why when our soldiers came home from all the wars that have 
been fought as long as I've been alive, there was an enormous period of 
attempting to readjust and to sort through the things they were asked to
 do. That's what I was trying to get at.<br>
<br>
To the delight of fans, Springsteen is back in full storyteller mode on 
the road, prefacing songs with personal anecdotes and rambling 
off-the-cuff commentaries.<br>
Before he bashed out "Part Man, Part Monkey" in Detroit, he couldn't resist a poke at the Bush administration:<br>
"Evolution is in doubt in the White House. We're just not sure about it.
 We're sure about contribution . . . retribution . . . execution. 
Evolution? Very iffy."<br>
By way of introducing "For You," an ivory-tickling valentine dating to 
his 1973 debut, "Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.," Springsteen recalled
 a hilarious lecture by his father:<br>
"My dad was explaining to me . . . that love songs are actually a 
government conspiracy, each and every one of 'em, a government 
conspiracy to get you married and force you to pay taxes."<br>
Before the rousing "Long Time Comin'," one of several "Devils &amp; 
Dust" tunes about making a fresh start, Springsteen talked about his 
relationship with his own children:<br>
"I always meet people and they go, Oh, man, your kids must think you're 
cool.' Nope. They don't think I'm cool at all. And they shouldn't. It's 
the parents' job to be uncool."<br>
<br>
You've written about family ties before, but you really hone in on bonds
 between mothers and sons on the new album. What got you thinking along 
those lines?<br>
<br>
I don't really know. Maybe it's because I hadn't written much about it in the past.<br>
Mothers, they're the soul protectors, y'know?<br>
I had a friend of mine [Fiona Chappel, to whom the ballad "Silver 
Palomino" is dedicated] who passed away and left two young sons. It was 
very difficult. That might've had something to do with it.<br>
The mother-child connection is so intense. It's so deep.<br>
On the songs I've written on this particular record, it's severed -- in 
"Silver Palomino," "Black Cowboys," "Jesus Was an Only Son" and "The 
Hitter." Those songs are [about] how people try to regain their footing 
-- or don't.<br>
<br>
On "Matamoros Banks" and the version of "The Promised Land" you're 
performing on this tour, you do this high-pitched keening, expressing a 
lot of emotion without any words. How did you come to develop that 
coyote croon, for lack of a better description?<br>
<br>
I started in the early '90s. On the "Tom Joad" tour, I would end the night with it, as I do on this tour.<br>
It removes even the lyrics from the evening, and it just becomes purely 
musical. There's something in it that sums up what you've sung.<br>
I don't know exactly what that is. But it's an unusual sound for a man to make. (laugh)<br>
You would have to go back to the doo-wop singers who sang in those 
beautiful falsettos. Those have gotten lost in the past 10 or 20 years. 
You forget all the unbelievable and beautiful falsetto singing by men 
that was occurring in the '50s and '60s. These were just amazing voices.
 They communicated an integration of men and women that was unique. 
Also, it's a very sensual sound.<br>
So it's something I've tried to develop. On this record, I got up my 
nerve to sing a whole song in it ["All I'm Thinkin' About"].<br>
I was lucky, 'cause I didn't have it before my mid-40s. Through the '70s and the '80s, I never had it.<br>
It's very unusual to sustain that if you do a lot of hard singing. The 
first thing that goes usually is your top. But it was just something I 
came upon.<br>
<br>
"Reno" continues to receive a lot of attention. The last line -- "It 
wasn't the best I ever had, not even close" -- got a laugh from the 
audience in Detroit, although I didn't take it as a punch line when I 
first heard the song.<br>
<br>
What I took that for was surprise. The cool thing about the first three 
shows [including two warm-up gigs in New Jersey] was people hadn't heard
 the record.<br>
They didn't know what was coming. So it was sort of neat.<br>
I enjoyed it myself, those first few nights where I was playing a lot of
 this music. I knew for the most part people had heard none of it.<br>
I remember when I first played ["Reno"] for Steve [Van Zandt, E Street 
Band guitarist]. He expected a different ending. It was a line that 
caught him by surprise, too.<br>
The funny thing is, since people have heard it, the surprise is kind of 
gone. It's a different experience. But it was interesting the first few 
nights.<br>
<br>
Starbucks, a growing force in the music-retail industry, opted not to 
stock "Devils &amp; Dust" after the coffeehouse chain's executives 
deemed "Reno" too hot to handle. The song's graphic depiction of an 
encounter with a prostitute leaves little to the imagination, although 
the tone is more sad than salacious.<br>
"If you brought any young kids with you, it might be a nice time to 
check out those fine T-shirts we have on sale," Springsteen said before 
he sang "Reno" on opening night.<br>
He flaunted his seldom-seen prowess on the piano during the epic "Racing
 in the Street," raised the roof with a dramatically backlit rendition 
of the Sept. 11-inspired anthem "The Rising" and struck a poignant chord
 to the tune of "Matamoros Banks," a "Devils &amp; Dust" standout about 
the dreams and death of an illegal immigrant.<br>
Nearly 2½ hours and several standing ovations after the transcendent 
concert began, a sweat-soaked Springsteen tapped a heartbeat rhythm on 
the body of his acoustic guitar as he brought it all home with a 
no-frills, all-thrills reworking of "The Promised Land."<br>
<br>
Are these solo shows more or less exhausting than a typical gig with the E Street Band?<br>
<br>
They're mentally very intense, because if there's any noise coming off 
the stage, you're making it. (laugh) There's not a sax solo.<br>
On the other hand, they're somewhat less physically taxing, because 
obviously there isn't the physical show that's involved [with the band].
 High-volume rock 'n' roll music extracts a different type of physical 
toll.<br>
They're just different. I enjoy them both very much, and I look forward 
to playing with the band again in the not-too-distant future.<br>
But this is something I also enjoy very, very, very deeply.<br>
<br>
You performed here in Cleveland last year not only on the Vote for 
Change Tour, but also at the John Kerry rally on the eve of Election 
Day. Since then, you've been asked a lot about the repercussions of 
sticking your neck out politically. Given the fact the new album debuted
 at No. 1 and given the success of the solo tour so far -- 7,000 tickets
 for the Cleveland show were snatched up in three minutes! -- I have to 
wonder: Backlash? What backlash?<br>
<br>
I never went into it expecting that. I have a long relationship with my audience that over the years has had ups and downs.<br>
Every time you make a new record, you'll get some letters: "Why didn't you make a record like the last one?" (laugh)<br>
Or "I liked it when you were writing just about the cars and the girls."<br>
You're always in the process of an ongoing dialogue with your audience. 
Whatever we did during the election ends up being a part of that 
conversation. You get letters back that are harsh or nasty. And that's 
part of the conversation.<br>
Whether I lost some fans or not, I don't know. Whether I picked up any 
fans or not, I don't know. But I think all in all, after 30 years, your 
relationship with the audience you've been playing for and singing for 
is greater than any single act.<br>
You're constantly in the process of doing a wide variety of different 
things that move you in this direction, move you in that direction.<br>
I met some Republican fans who just said they stayed away from those shows or they didn't agree. It was part of the dialogue.<br>
I have a lot of pride in my audience. I think I've built up a very close
 relationship, one that has bred, hopefully, a good deal of mutual 
respect.<br>
The audiences I've had on this tour so far are some of the best I've ever had, just amazing.<br>
<br>
The E Street Band expanded into a small orchestra on recent recordings 
and tours, with more personnel than ever. Do you foresee going back to a
 leaner, meaner E Street Band at some point?<br>
<br>
No, because everyone took many roads, and we all arrived at this 
particular location. The guys and girls who are there now, that's the E 
Street Band.<br>
I just recently heard some of us when we were a five-piece unit. It was 
quite a smaller sound. It was interesting, back in '73 and '74. If I 
went to play the piano, there was no guitar! (laugh)<br>
That was a great little band. But it was very different.<br>
It was an organic growth, in that it just moved in its own direction.<br>
I can't ever imagine -- I mean, would I ever play in a smaller band unit
 at some point, in some other type of project? I might, depending on 
what music I wrote.<br>
Some of the band things on this record aren't quite E Street Band 
material. It's a slightly different sound, a smaller, roots-rock sound.<br>
I leave all the doors open. I listen to the music, and I try to go where it takes me.</div>

2001<br>
By Bill Flanagan</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
When Bruce Springsteen was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of 
Fame in early 1999, he took the occasion to honor his comrades in the E 
Street Band, the legendary group he formed in 1973 and fronted for 
sixteen years. Shortly after that, Springsteen announced what his fans 
had been hoping for - that he and the E Street Band would reunite for a 
world tour. The tour began in early spring of '99 and ended, with ten 
emotional shows at Madison Square Garden, in June of 2000.<br>
Throughout the tour, Springsteen declined all requests for interviews. 
He said he wanted to stay below the radar, to pull himself away from the
 media hype that accompanies most major rock events these days, to let 
the audience find the music, rather than shove it in their faces. Along 
that line, the generous concerts included songs from every part of 
Springsteen's career with the notable exception of his big video hits 
from the mid-80s. There was no "Glory Days" or "I'm on Fire" or 
"Brilliant Disguise" or "My Hometown." "Born in the USA" showed up 
rewritten as an acoustic blues. The rare times he played "Dancing in the
 Dark," it was as a solo country song.<br>
Springsteen spent much of 2001 working on tapes - video and audio - of 
the Madison Square Garden shows. He made some of them into an HBO 
special, and now has put the entire show onto two DVDs for release as 
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band Live in New York City. That 
follows the release earlier this year of two other Springsteen DVDs, a 
video collection and Blood Brothers, a documentary about the E Street 
Band.<br>
Bruce invited VH1 to his farm in New Jersey, not far from the towns of 
Freehold, where he was born and raised, and Asbury Park, where he began 
his musical career. He was relaxed, hospitable, quick to laugh but also 
thoughtful with his answers. This is, after all, his life's work we're 
dealing with. It is the only interview Bruce Springsteen will give for 
this project, and it got at the heart of his relationship with the 
stage, his family, his fans, and the E Street Band.<br>
Homecoming: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band will premiere on VH1
 on Sunday, December 16 at 9/8c [2001].The special combines performances
 not seen in the HBO special with Bruce's reflections about the music, 
the tour, and his songwriting.<br>
What follows is some of the rest of what he told us:<br>
<br>
You once said that the E Street Band represented something to your 
audience that was bigger than you realized, until you went your separate
 ways. <br>
<br>
You built the thing, so you have a slightly different perspective on it.
 But you forget that music goes out into the world and has a life of its
 own, apart from whatever your ambitions may have been. One of the 
things that made me want to take the band out was I was in Freehold and 
ran into a couple of young guys in their early twenties. They came up to
 me and said, "We're big fans, but we've never seen you play with the 
band." I felt that I'd like to play for these guys, and I'd like for my 
own kids to see it. Because my band is one of the greatest bands in the 
world. When the band reformed, we realized we were important to one 
another. One of the things I was proudest of was that everybody was 
alive and well and healthy and the best that I'd ever seen them. It was a
 reflection of the values that were in our music from the beginning. We 
all had a bigger respect for the power of the band and the meaning of 
the band to our audience, just from having that time apart.<br>
<br>
What was your kids' reaction to the shows?<br>
<br>
It varied from nights where they would be excited about it to "Can I go 
home please?" [Laughs] In the end, it's your mom and dad [up there].The 
main thing was I wanted them to see us doing a job that we loved with 
our very close friends. They met Clarence, but they had never seen 
Clarence and me onstage together, or Steve and me onstage together, or 
Nils. The band is a good model of successful friendships and working 
relationships. I wanted the kids to see that it was powerful, when we 
all stand together and do this.<br>
<br>
The way you all took turns singing the verses of "If I Should Fall Behind" was a perfect summation.<br>
<br>
Yeah. In one of his interviews Danny [Federici] said, "When you're 
young, you don't know what you have." That's always true. You get a 
little older and you go, "This is a real great thing to have as part of 
your life." I was looking for a song we could all sing. The idea was: 
There's this group of very individual people. Everybody's gone off and 
followed their own careers in different ways. I wanted the symbolism of 
having their individual voices heard. Hear Clarence's voice. Hear Nils' 
voice. Hear Steve's voice. Patti's voice. They're all so particular to 
themselves. That song perfectly leant itself to that presentation. At 
the end of the night that's what it's all about, right there.<br>
<br>
When you were first going through songs for the set, did you think, "I 
don't feel like I can comfortably sing that one, but I can do a new 
thing with this one?"<br>
<br>
If the tour didn't feel present, it wasn't going to happen. We've set a 
particular mark on the bar that I didn't want to find myself falling 
short of. Initially, I went in with the idea of just playing things that
 I was excited about singing. A lot of it we pulled from Tracks, because
 it was all stuff that had the power and passion the band had, yet 
hadn't been heard very much. Then there's the Darkness on the Edge of 
Town stuff. I knew I wanted to sing some of those songs, but I didn't 
want to sing them as I'd sung them previously. We took a long time 
making our records, because we were thinking about them a lot. The songs
 were very thoughtfully written. That paid off 15 years later, because 
when I went to them, they maintained their emotional vitality and their 
realness. I wrote from a pretty adult perspective when I was very young.
 That also paid off when we went back to the music. The depth was there 
in those songs. So your 50-year-old self could reach for those different
 things that you went in after before and pull them out. Once we had 
that, I knew we were going to be very good every night. The first night 
we played for an audience, in Asbury Park, there was about 50 people 
standing outside. It was rainy, so we said, "Well, let everyone in." The
 whole thing transformed itself. I had some anxieties about, "Gee, can I
 sing this? Can I sing that?" The minute there was an audience there, it
 was shocking. I was like, "There's the element that's going to make 
this live here and now." I think we played 110 songs over the course of 
the tour. Some of them only once. Some of them every night.<br>
<br>
Some songs were changed radically live, some subtly. On "Thunder Road," 
for instance, you begin singing in the past tense and then you go into 
the story. I don't know how planned that was.<br>
<br>
I didn't realize I was doing that! [Laughs.] I think I was just trying 
to find my current voice inside the music. There were some lyric 
changes. There were definitely ways that I sang, inflections, falling on
 certain words. I wanted the audience to connect with the music that 
they loved, but I also wanted them to find a subtle new spot in it. With
 a song like "Thunder Road," we were able to do that. I sung it the way 
I'd sing now, which is different from the way you'd sing ten or fifteen 
years ago. Your inflection changes. The tone of your voice is subtly 
different. That all changes as you move along as a singer. So you're 
able to refine those songs with a slightly different voice. That was the
 main thing we were interested in. You hopefully pick up the past and 
the present. It can broaden the song in a nice way.<br>
<br>
The most striking thing was that you went out and did very different 
shows night after night, with songs from 1973 to today. But you didn't 
really play any of the big '80s video hits.<br>
We had hits at a certain moment, but we weren't much of a singles band. 
They weren't as essential as playing "Promised Land" or "Darkness on the
 Edge of Town" or something new that captured the band's essence, like 
"Land of Hope and Dreams." No one really missed them. I played "Dancing 
in the Dark" a couple of times. We had a neat little country version we 
did. But it was pretty few and far in-between. Those things can really 
date you. The people who had seen us before were coming because they 
remembered they [once] got something that they needed [from us].That was
 what our band tried to deliver. The new people were coming because they
 wanted that intensity, to see what was that thing that people needed. 
When we put the set together, my concern was playing essential material -
 things that defined my voice and the band's power. Those are the songs 
we incorporated into the show. The stuff that I felt was essential, that
 had fallen during that time period I reinterpreted in some fashion.<br>
<br>
The country thing has definitely become more of a presence in the live 
show. When I first heard you and the E Street Band it was not there. It 
was at the time of the Eagles, but yours was a band that had everything 
except country.<br>
<br>
Yeah. Before I recorded I had some things that were a little more 
country-oriented. Steve was a massive country music fan. When we were in
 the teen clubs, he was a gigantic country rock fan.<br>
He was a gigantic Youngbloods fan. Stevie played the hell out of that 
first Youngbloods album! He had a great band and played all that. And 
Nils learned to play steel guitar for the tour! I said, "I'd like to use
 steel on this thing." He said, "Let me try and see what I can do." He 
spent a month or two and learned to play that damn thing right before he
 went on the road. Amazing! That's hard to play. I can't sit down and 
make heads or tails of that, because you're using your legs and your 
hands. It's like you're rubbing your tummy and scratching your head. It 
allowed us to bring stuff that I'd gotten into through The Ghost of Tom 
Joad record, a little more of the country thing, and put it into what we
 were doing with the band. It was a nice element to throw in there.<br>
<br>
One of the other things you've always been able to do is mix material as
 profound as "Mansion on the Hill" with the showmanship of "Light of 
Day," with that fantastic New York vs. New Jersey routine as a 
centerpiece.<br>
<br>
When we grew up, rock musicians were clowns, you know? Go back to the 
Coasters and the guy standing on the stand-up bass with Bill Haley. They
 clowned. It was part of the fun of the whole thing. That came natural, 
being alongside Steve. The fun things were always a natural part of the 
band. Part of what you're there for is it's joyous and silly. That's 
maybe the most essential part. I've said often in the past, it was 
supposed to be a circus, a political rally, and a dance party. All those
 different things.<br>
<br>
Until this tour, I really never saw the great song in "Light of Day." You've done that song a lot, and<br>
I've always wondered what you see in it.<br>
<br>
That's a funny thing. It's just a pretty generic rock song, but it ends 
up being a little more than that because of the context. It's ended up 
ending the show. Partly because it gives itself over to shtick very 
easily! [Laughs] It's so basic that you can do anything with it. Start 
it. Stop it. Do all kinds of routines inside it. It's one of those 
all-purpose pieces of material.<br>
<br>
At the very end of it, when you're down on your knees. I wonder whether it's a moment of collapse or a moment of delight.<br>
<br>
I think it's all of those things. I'm collapsing and I'm delighted that I get to rest for a few minutes!<br>
Are you lost in that moment? Or are you like an actor going, "Okay, finish that scene. Let's go on to the next one."<br>
<br>
Well, it can only be real if you're really there. The hardest thing 
about the show is that I wake up in the morning and know I've got to 
turn myself into a hysterical raving lunatic later that evening. The 
trick every night is to get there, and get as far into that as you can. 
It's part of what your guarantee is, that you're going to reach that 
moment for your audience. Because if you're not there, there's nothing 
worse. Somebody once asked [the J. Geils' Band's] Peter Wolf what's the 
weirdest thing he ever did on stage. He said, "Think about what I was 
doing." That is the strangest thing you can ever do. You've got to be 
down and in it. We've got a lot of music that helps you get there, and 
I've got a band and an audience that gets me there. But you have to walk
 onstage with a complete commitment to go there. And it's absolutely 
essential that you get there, which isn't hard when there are all those 
people screaming in your face.You want to do something.<br>
<br>
For some people the ability to reconnect with that goes away.<br>
<br>
I guess it can happen. From the beginning, I've said, "You've got to go 
up there believing that it's only rock 'n' roll and it's the most 
important thing you're going to do in the world that night." You've got 
to hold both those ideas in your head simultaneously. For me it still 
remains a tremendous opportunity. I worked very hard to develop a voice 
and create a situation where I can communicate. That's something of 
extreme value to me.<br>
<br>
Is there part of you that doesn't need the audience as much any more now that you have your family?<br>
<br>
It's different. It's not completely a question of need. It's just part 
of your life. There were some simple reasons to do the tour. One was 
asking myself: "Is that who I was or who I am?" I developed all these 
skills and this craft and used it to its greatest effect in this 
context. It's just things I know how to do. I would have to have a real 
strong reason to not do them. I enjoyed playing acoustically and I 
certainly want to do that again and make records like that again. In a 
sense I'm very happy at home. I'm pretty good at not working. But at the
 same time, this is something that is part of my life. It's part of our 
lives. Once you set it in motion, all the old things come into play. All
 the old motivations, your desires, your own needs, what you get from 
the audience at night and what you deliver. You still need the audience.
 There isn't a particular night where you don't like 20,000 people 
screaming your name. That's still fun. I always used to watch this film 
Gentleman Jim with Errol Flynn and Ward Bond. Ward Bond played the great
 boxer John L. Sullivan. There was a great scene where he's coming down 
the street and there's a crowd around him. He would say to everybody 
that he met, "Shake the hand that shook the world!" I always enjoyed 
that. You go out on the town and you're sitting there and people come up
 and say, "Hi." I get something out of that. I enjoy that more often 
than not. That's still a big part of what gets you out there.<br>
<br>
You put a lot of stuff out on DVD this year.<br>
<br>
[Laughs] Catching up!<br>
<br>
Do you think of it like making an album? You seem to be putting a lot of care into it.<br>
<br>
We were getting towards the end of the tour, and hadn't filmed anything.
 I didn't film the Tom Joad tour and that was stupid. My manager Jon 
Landau said, "Look, Sony will give us these cameras and the last couple 
of nights we can film the thing. If you like it, great. If not, okay." I
 said, "Okay. As long as it doesn't get in the way of doing the last 
shows here in the city." The fellows that had worked on the video, our 
director Chris [Hilson], were with us the whole tour and knew the band 
real well. I looked at a little of it one afternoon before the show. I 
had a few suggestions about the lighting and this, that and the other 
thing. I didn't think about it after that, because it wasn't 
super-expensive. If it didn't come out good, it didn't come out good. 
Then I saw it a few weeks after we stopped and said, "Wow, this is a 
pretty good record of who the band is and what we do." The hardest thing
 to do was cut it down to the hour and 50 minutes we thought was going 
to get on television. I wanted to make sure it had the impact that I 
felt was part of the personality of our group. It was supposed to be 
straight at you, play to your insides as best we could and have that 
work on television. I felt so relieved when we saw it, because I 
realized there had not been any real extended video record of the E 
Street Band. To have captured the band at its best and in that fashion 
was something I felt really good about. Twenty years from now when my 
son Evan or somebody has their kids, they can say, "Hey, this is 
grandpop. This is what he did." I have something to put on and say, 
"This is what I've done with my life." It's nice to have that. I hope 
the fans enjoy it.<br>
<br>
It's got to give you a different perspective on the band. It must have 
been the most time you've ever spent looking at yourself and the E 
Street Band on film.<br>
<br>
I've never seen the band really, except for bits and pieces of videotape
 and things. So I had never really seen the show. It was fun to see it, 
you know? I was superstitious. Focusing on it too much like that I 
always felt was not good for the soul! [Laughs] We just go out and do 
it. I was very intent on the transitional nature of it. Tonight we're in
 Oklahoma. And this is a show for Oklahoma.<br>
We're going to do it tonight and then it's going to be gone and done and
 whoever was there saw it and that's that. That was the way that I felt 
it was supposed to be for a long time. But I certainly wanted to get 
some piece of film on everything we did from here on in.<br>
<br>
When something like this is over what happens? Does everyone say, 'Let's
 get the band in the studio?' Or does it feel like, OK, let's go make 
another Tom Joad?<br>
<br>
Actually, after Tom Joad I felt like making another Tom Joad! [Laughs.] 
But my whole thing has been a sort of yin-yang. I would make a record 
that was somewhat quiet, whether it was Tunnel of<br>
Love or Nebraska, and then I would tend to make a rock record. Even 
before I recorded I played acoustically. So I always went back and forth
 between those two things. I wrote some good songs. I didn't have enough
 for an album and I didn't think I had a record that was as good as the 
Tom Joad record. Then you get an itch to do the other thing. The 
physicality that playing in a band involves is something you don't quite
 get out of an acoustic show. Just the level of fun and excitement. 
Coming out and making a big noise. It's fun to do for people and for 
yourself. I'd like to make a record with the band, have something that I
 can go out and play on the road. We'll see where it goes. We've played a
 little bit on the studio. We came off the road, spent a couple of days 
just knocking some things down. I've made some demos of "Code of 
Silence," "Further On Up the Road," a bunch of things we started to play
 on the tour. I'm just starting to get into what that's going to pan out
 as. I think I'd like to play again live like that not too far in the 
future if everything goes all right.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Interview<br>
“The Key to the Universe”<br>
Interview took place on April 29, 1981 in Rotterdam, Holland.<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
The second night you played a different show from the first one, why?<br>
<br>
Well, the first night we played a set we've played a few times already, 
the song sequence fits well. The second night we played a new set, maybe
 the songs didn't follow each other that well, but there were moments 
which were better than the first one'. That,'s the reason why I changed 
the set; besides, I wanted to do something different because I realised 
that there were a lot of people who'd been there the night before. Both 
Dutch gigs were the gigs we've been looking forward to most, 'cause 
they've been almost one long show. I think I liked the second night 
better, that night I had a better feeling.<br>
<br>
The song sequence in the first part of the first show showed a clear 
concept from dreams to a disappointing reality, to solidarity in the 
promised land. This sequence was missing the second night.<br>
<br>
Well, we opened, the first night with 'Follow That Dream', which was the
 frame of the whole show'. The whole show is put together similar to the
 construction of the records; the second night we opened with 'Run Thru 
The Jungle', which is in fact the opposite of 'Follow That Dream'.<br>
<br>
Had the reaction of the crowd during the first night made you change your show?<br>
<br>
No, not really. Every crowd is different. On both nights I felt real 
full, as strong as iron. When the crowd jumps up and gets excited 
instead of sitting down and just listening, that doesn't touch me as 
much as in the earlier days. I know exactly what I'm doing, what I'm 
singing up there. You see, I come up and present my show; of course, you
 work up to an involvement with the people, but you got to present your 
ideas. At the end of an opening song like 'Follow That Dream', a strange
 feeling comes over me, like I'm right in the people's heads. That's the
 reason I start with that song, although really it's too slow to start a
 show, but because of that you make the people a bit doubtful, I see it 
as catching a deep breath, before making the big jump. 'Run Thru The 
Jungle' has the same effect, 'cause this song radiates the same mood of 
intimacy. But at the opening of a show, people don't expect intimacy, 
they want to get excited together, they want to jump up. So if you start
 calm, you take the people close to you from the beginning. Back in the 
States we've never done that, that's why I think that these shows are 
better.<br>
<br>
So you start with a piece of meditation, like John McLaughlin's minute of quiet?<br>
<br>
Something like that, especially with 'Follow That Dream' everything 
falls off me, so when I've finished it, I think "That's done, now we're 
gonna hit it!" The strange thing is that you feel you need guts to do 
that. But to take that risk gives me strength.<br>
<br>
At the beginning of 'Independence Day', 'Factory' and 'This Land Is Your
 Land', you gave three of your visions of the American Dream, the first 
night an intimate story about your father and grandfather, the second 
night you spoke about trying to see Elvis shortly before his death. Were
 you not afraid that stories like that would come over a bit stilted to 
Europeans?<br>
When we reached the point of leaving for Europe I told the band that we 
couldn't play 'This Land' in Europe. Well, I sing it now because I think
 that everybody can feel a certain alliance with this song, as well as 
the place where you live. Even if you don't agree with the government, 
or things in society, you can still feel a sort of alliance with your 
country, for instance you see that during wartime, 'cause every human 
being feels connected with a place. 'This Land' is about that feeling 
and about decency and respect. That song keeps a promise. This promise 
is one of the most essential characteristics.<br>
<br>
The feeling of optimism towards society and its chances lies on a higher level in the United States than in Europe. <br>
<br>
I'm not so sure about that. The promise as such is connected with human 
nature and everyone's longing for redemption. It's about proving your 
own possibilities; together with that there is also a feeling of 
solidarity, if it's only the possibility to pass on your own happiness 
to others, hoping that with sharing you can stimulate others. Boy, that 
song is so touching.<br>
<br>
In Holland it was a kind of party-hit by Trini Lopez; Woody Guthrie is almost unknown.<br>
<br>
That was like somebody in Europe, who asked why I used Status Quo's 
'Rocking All Over The World' as an encore. I said "Gee, I thought that 
song was by John Fogerty", but it doesn't matter; in the States, Lopez' 
version was a hit too. What does matter to me is that it has been used 
as phoney flagwaving, while the essence of that song has to do with the 
struggle for life. It doesn't say anything about a statement, but a 
challenge, a question. We put it in the set after I read the Woody 
Guthrie book. That man wrote such a lot of great songs.<br>
<br>
Why did you do 'Stolen Car' only on the first night?<br>
<br>
Well, the second night we did 'Racing In The Street'; we've played 
'Stolen Car' only a few times, though it's one of my favourite 'River' 
songs. I got to be in the mood to play it, to hit it. <br>
<br>
Besides the horrible theme of the song itself, it amazes me that you, 
while you're in quite a comfortable situation, you've been able to 
maintain such a sharp outlook on suffering.<br>
<br>
Everybody is afflicted with something, nobody is happier than another. 
Everyone bears expectations and fears. 'Stolen Car' has to do with the 
fear of isolation, a fear which everyone has, and which gets worse if 
you can't find the reason for it.<br>
<br>
You give the impression that you 'live' with the public.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I don't know; what we do, what we offer happens within an ideal 
situation, we reach a lot of young and older people all in one crowd. 
People who react differently to things seem to have a common interest. 
When the houselights go up I get the feeling that I belong to all these 
people and the people to me; this solidarity is what I'm after. In the 
States this means a community which acknowledges that everyone is 
different. If you're reasonable and being guided by human values, 
there's a common interest in the recognition of the variety of people in
 a community. It's about having respect for somebody else.<br>
<br>
At the same time you deal with the impossibilities of life. Your river 
doesn't just flow from A to B, it's at the same place at the same time 
and it's also a dividing line.<br>
<br>
The essence of 'The River' is militancy. Saying that you never have to 
do anything because you'll never reach the promised land, that's 
disastrous; it's about the old saying that 'life is the living'. By 
living you get a notion of certain values and of yourself. In the 
struggle to make an ideal true you find a meaning, by living you're 
searching for that meaning, that's what it's all about.<br>
<br>
What meaning is behind the disappointments that your characters in your songs come across?<br>
<br>
To face failures is one of the most important things that you have to 
learn. You have to face disappointments so that the fire that burns in 
you doesn't go out. You have to straighten out your problems. Those who 
take up with this are on this side of that slender lifeline; those who 
don't fight it will fall. They exist, but they have lost their strength 
of mind.<br>
<br>
Is this why 'promise' is the key word in your lyrics?<br>
<br>
To me, rock 'n' roll means: don't give up! Losing hope is becoming our 
greatest threat. The appearance has to be held up. The feeling that life
 holds a promise gives it a meaning and has to be respected.<br>
<br>
Then what exactly is it that makes life worth living?<br>
<br>
Good question! (laughs, enthusiastic) It's different for everybody. I can't think of a good answer to that quickly. <br>
<br>
I meant in relation to the characters in 'The River'!<br>
<br>
The point is that the meaning of life has to be found by living it. It 
seems in life that the disappointments are big and the victories small. 
Still there is something left, it's like a sediment, your biography. It 
fills you with a heart of stone. You start being someone; you get a 
sense of identity, what you want and what you believe. A lot of people 
never reach that stage because the walls are as high as life. I'm 
concerned with trying to destroy those walls so that people can meet 
themselves, see! In 'In Dreams' it says "Every man has a right to live /
 A right to a chance to give what he has to give". But what do we see? 
Crippled personalities, people who've never made themselves complete. 
They lock themselves up, filled with anger, and they join the National 
Socialists or the Ku Klux Klan, searching for an identity, a belief!<br>
<br>
From your records I understand that "the streets" form the stage for that hunt for an identity.<br>
<br>
Yeah, that's where you find the John Hinkleys. People who search outside
 themselves instead of on the inside. That possibility hasn't been 
presented to them in an understandable way. <br>
<br>
When you were talking about your old man and his old man, you said they 
spent their lives in a factory, because of lack of information about the
 forces controlling their lives. Isn't the same thing happening to all 
of us, but from an excess of information?<br>
<br>
You have to learn what is worthwhile and what isn't. Despite the excess 
of information, lack of knowledge is still contrastingly extreme. In 
school you learn a million facts without getting a straight 
understanding. <br>
<br>
Who teaches you to sift that information?<br>
<br>
You build up a system of values. Through values you can get the 
information. Such a system is - I hope - based on human values. Before 
1975 I could hardly put my ideas into words. I wanted to make records, 
sound like Phil Spector, and other things. I have relatives who can't 
put their wishes and dreams into words, but they can feel intuitively 
what's good for them, what their expectations of life can fulfil. People
 don't know what they've got inside them and what they can do with 
themselves.<br>
<br>
Your solidarity with people can be heard in all your work, while you've obtained a lot yourself.<br>
<br>
Whether somebody has a lot of money and the possibility to buy things 
which he thinks make you happy, makes no difference to me. I'm concerned
 with poverty of spirit: mental poverty. Of course social injustice does
 exist, but the difference between dying like a rich man but poisoned 
with drugs, like Elvis, and dying like a poor man with an old coat - 
that's what it's all about to me. There are all sorts of poverty and 
richness. A lot of my friends don't have a thing, but they know how to 
stay alive.<br>
Religion? I don't know the causes that have brought me here. The only 
thing I know is that when I was a kid I heard something and what I heard
 was more than I could think of at the time. Though I knew it was 
important enough to me to fight for. I went back to Hank Williams and 
Jimmy Rodgers, to soul and spirituals. Suddenly I found what I had heard
 back in the old rock 'n' roll records. Or read in that fantastic book 
'American Dreams, Lost and Found' by Studs Terkel, or seen in the movie 
'The Grapes of Wrath'.<br>
<br>
Don't you have the feeling that your childhood comes back to you, including your religion?<br>
<br>
It never left me. You carry that with you for the rest of your life. 
Religion I don't really feel tied with, because my Catholic education 
taught me to have fear. This is a religious experience in which you 
don't look up to heaven but to the people around you.<br>
<br>
Could your attempt to escape the dogma of your childhood be your most important motivation?<br>
<br>
I still remember what first frightened me: the devil. When my grandma 
said what the devil looked like, I got so scared, I thought he lived on 
our pavement. I never had the guts to go out alone! I was truly 
convinced that the devil was on my front porch! That kind of fear is 
demolishing and shameful because it darkens the spirit of religion. In 
spite of it all I like to walk into a church if I want to. Not for what 
happens on the altar, but to experience the feeling of people around me.
 In Spain I walked into a beautiful cathedral; when I looked up I saw a 
lot of details that quite struck me. The atmosphere was so immense that 
being in that church gave me a bigger feeling of infinity than heaven 
outside.<br>
<br>
Has that something to do with a feeling of eternity? With conquering death?<br>
<br>
No, it's not a feeling to do with not having to die. It's a feeling of 
being part of all that lived, died and was followed by new life. It is 
even the opposite: a feeling of mortality and in what way you're part of
 all things.<br>
<br>
During 'Stolen Car' a lot of people held lights up. It gave the atmosphere of candles in a mass service.<br>
<br>
Yeah…it's something. (Laughs briefly)</div>

MARK BINELLI<br>
Bruce Springsteen's American Gospel </strong><br>
<br>
There's a sign on the road leading to Bruce Springsteen's place that 
reads discharge of firearms prohibited. Springsteen lives on a 400-acre 
farm in Monmouth County, New Jersey, about an hour outside Manhattan, 
with his wife, Patti Scialfa, who sings backup in the E Street Band, and
 their three children, Evan, 13, Jessica, 11, and Sam, 8. The farm's 
previous owner, a painter, cherished the lush landscape and kept 
developers at bay. Then, for a time, there was talk of turning the 
property into a golf course, before Springsteen purchased it, eight 
years ago. "We got lucky," he says, standing in a field and surveying 
his land. "I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be." <br>
Springsteen walks with a slight limp — years of jumping around arena 
stages having taken their toll — but he wears it well, or at least his 
persona does, the cowboyish swagger bringing to mind a character out of 
one of the John Ford westerns he loves. Otherwise, at fifty-two, he 
looks remarkably fit. His arms, especially, bring a formidable heft. 
Today, he's sporting clothes that nudge slightly closer to the trendy — 
or at least trendy for someone normally photographed in denim and 
flannel. There are gray pants and a jacket, both by G-Star, scuffed 
black boots and an orange mesh tank top. He wears a silver wedding band 
and thin hoop earrings in both ears — three on the left — and a generous
 amount of stubble, slightly more mustache than beard. His face is 
tanned and ruddy; his hair is thinning, but only his sideburns hint at 
gray. A large cross hangs from a silver chain around his neck, three 
tiny silver hearts dangling from the cross's arms and base. Springsteen 
isn't sure about the tank top, only because he's going to be 
photographed later in the afternoon. "I've never been photographed in 
orange before," he says. "I'm so boring. I don't want to blow the 
sartorial boringness I've cultivated over the years."<br>
It's a beautiful day and Springsteen is in high spirits. Would we like 
to hear a joke? Of course. ("Why do most men name their private parts? 
Because they don't want a stranger making ninety percent of their 
decisions.") His favorite new rapper is Ludacris. He enjoys watching E 
Street Band guitarist Steve Van Zandt mug as wiseguy Silvio Dante on The
 Sopranos, though he misses Big Pussy (who, incidentally, once joined 
Springsteen onstage. Springsteen says he had a pretty good voice).<br>
A loud, unpleasant mewling erupts nearby. "We've got peacocks," 
Springsteen says, nodding at a nearby hutch. "They're great watch 
animals. They'll sit on top of the house, and if anyone comes within 
fifty feet, they'll squawk." Springsteen also keeps horses; he recalls 
one of his first, which his family named He Who Is Afraid of Small 
Things because the horse would throw Springsteen whenever a squirrel or 
rabbit crossed his path.<br>
In recent months, Springsteen's most time-consuming pastoral endeavor 
has involved making his farm organic. As he explains, it's a five-year 
process, during which inspectors regularly test the soil for chemicals. 
For now, Springsteen is growing nothing but a ground cover of reedy 
wildflowers, which will eventually be plowed back into the earth as part
 of the nonorganic purging.<br>
And so goes the life of Bruce Springsteen, five decades on. He keeps an 
eye on the homestead. Takes his kids down to the Jersey shore. Goes for 
rides in his vintage blue Corvette. Gets pissed off reading the paper — 
most recently over the stories of corporate malfeasance and the current 
administration's laissez-faire attitude.<br>
Most important, Springsteen is making rock music again — and it has been
 a while. His last studio album, 1995's The Ghost of Tom Joad, won a 
Grammy for best contemporary folk album. The new album, The Rising, is 
not Springsteen as lone troubadour, but Springsteen reunited, finally 
and completely, with the E Street Band. The group had reformed pre-Tom 
Joad to record three new tracks for a 1995 greatest-hits album, and it 
embarked on a triumphant comeback tour four years later, but The 
Risingis its first full album since 1984's Born in the U.S.A.<br>
Equally significant, The Rising is the first Springsteen album ever to 
be produced by an outsider. Springsteen's camp over the years has been 
one of the most tightly knit in the rock world. Beginning with his first
 album, 1973's Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J., Springsteen has had a 
hand in producing every one of his albums. His only production 
collaborators have been people very close to him, such as his manager, 
Jon Landau, Van Zandt and Chuck Plotkin. They are notorious 
perfectionists. The time it takes them to make an album can be epic, up 
to three years; just as epic are the conversations between Springsteen 
and Landau about the nuances of a single take. But for The Rising, 
Springsteen handed the reins to Atlanta producer Brendan O'Brien, whose 
credits include albums by Pearl Jam and Rage Against the Machine. The 
new record was finished in seven and a half weeks.<br>
<br>
The Rising is largely Springsteen's response to the tragedy of September
 11th. And though it has its stark moments — the most devastating song 
on the album is, in fact, the solo Springsteen track "Paradise" — The 
Rising is as expansive and uplifting as Springsteen's best work with the
 E Street Band, accentuating in particular the band's gospel roots. 
Rather than whisper over an acoustic guitar, Springsteen takes us to the
 river and wonders if somebody can say amen. The title song, and first 
single, sums up the feel of many of the album's fourteen other tracks. 
It ostensibly unfolds from the point of view of a New York firefighter 
entering one of the burning towers. Yet, as on many songs on The Rising,
 Springsteen takes an unexpected turn, lyrically and musically, moving 
from a dark opening verse — "Can't see nothin' in front of me/Can't see 
nothin' coming up behind" — into a hand-clapping, sanctified chorus, as 
the literal image of a man rising up a smoke-filled stairwell merges 
into a religious image of ascension.<br>
Like the album as a whole, the song uses the events of September 11th as
 a metaphorical springboard. Images of rising — rising smoke, rising 
spirits, rising waters, even (yes) rising of a sexual sort — recur in 
several songs, serving as a formidable counterpoint to that other image,
 etched into our collective consciousness, replayed endlessly on every 
network, of falling, of collapse.<br>
Springsteen acknowledges the album's gospel element, and as further 
evidence points to "Into the Fire," which happens to be the first song 
he wrote after September 11th — he began working on it a few days after 
the attack. It covers ground similar to the title track, and also 
features a chorus that doubles as a prayer: "May your strength give us 
strength/May your hope give us hope. . . ."<br>
"When we got that song down," Springsteen says, "it brought the whole 
thing home immediately, because what you get on that song, the first 
verse is the blues." He begins to sing. His voice is soft and husky, 
with the same country twang he has on the recorded version: "The sky was
 falling and streaked with blood/I heard you calling me." He explains, 
"That's country blues. I'm doubling my voice around a twelve-string 
guitar, so when you hear the beginning of that thing, you hear a spirit 
out of the past. Mandolins. Appalachian fiddles." He sings again: "Then 
you disappeared into the dust, up the stairs. . . . "Then," Springsteen 
continues, "when the chorus hits, that's the gospel. The pump organ 
comes in. That's where the thing lifts and makes sense of the first 
verse and, hopefully, tries to make sense of the experience itself. And 
my best songs have done both of those things, blues and gospel. That's 
what my band, and my writing with the band, has always been about. On an
 album like Nebraska, you can hear the blues thing, but the band is more
 like Sunday church. We're gonna shout that thing to you, right into 
your face, and try to get you to stand up. And there were the essential 
elements of what I do with the band, in the first thirty seconds or so 
of recording this album. When the drums hit on 'Into the Fire,' it comes
 down, and the whole thing just grounds itself into the earth and starts
 fightin', you know? The gospel and the blues." Springsteen looses one 
of his hoarse, full-body laughs. "That's where the fight starts. And 
that's all we do, as a band. That's all that we're built for. That's the
 service we provide."<br>
In 1982, in a house about ten minutes from his farm, Springsteen 
recorded his album Nebraska, an acoustic collection of murder ballads 
and conjured ghosts that, to this day, sounds haunted and somehow 
timeless — an album-length equivalent of Elvis' version of "Blue Moon," 
or Hank Williams' "I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive." Springsteen,
 of course, followed up Nebraska with 1984's Born in the U.S.A., which 
changed everything. As anthemic and arena-friendly as its predecessor 
had been spooky and insular, the album sold over 10 million copies, 
spawning seven hit singles and placing Springsteen atop the pantheon of 
Eighties pop stars, representing for the blue-collar rock fan alongside 
the likes of Michael Jackson and Madonna. "I was always unsatisfied with
 that album," Springsteen says today. "That was one I really struggled 
with and never felt like I got the whole thing right. But your own 
wrestling in that department doesn't really have anything to do with the
 way something is received, or the way your fans hear it."<br>
Despite, or perhaps because of, the Born in the U.S.A. juggernaut, 
Springsteen had come to seem less and less mass-culturally relevant. 
With the ascendance of alternative rock and hip-hop, something about 
Springsteen felt decidedly Reagan era. And he himself began to pull away
 from the spotlight. He broke up the E Street Band in 1990. The rock 
albums that followed (Lucky Town and Human Touch, released in 1992) 
didn't garner the notice, critical or commercial, of previous efforts. 
By 1995, Springsteen had grown a mustache and released Tom Joad, a solo 
album in the key of Nebraska that took up the causes of migrant workers 
and other dispossessed characters. It was as if, to atone for 
inadvertently providing the soundtrack to the Reagan revolution, 
Springsteen turned his back on rock radio and pulled a sort of reverse 
Dylan: unplugging his guitar and morphing into a 
folk-singer-slash-activist.<br>
It was around this time, Springsteen admits, that he wasn't sure if he'd lost what he calls his "rock voice."<br>
<br>
We're sitting in the living room of a rambling colonial house, where he 
writes and occasionally records. (Some people have a workroom, but if 
you are Bruce Springsteen, you have a whole house to work in. The family
 living quarters are elsewhere on the farm.) On the coffee table between
 us, there are a stack of books (Dorothea Lange's Ireland, a book of 
rock photos by Danny Clinch), a vase of freshly cut sunflowers and a 
ceramic grinning cowboy. Otherwise, the room is decorated with tasteful 
antique Americana. Springsteen sits in an uncomfortable-looking wooden 
chair — legs spread, heels together, arms in throne position. He laughs 
loudly and often, though when speaking, he rarely makes eye contact, 
instead gazing off into near-distant space as his words form.<br>
Springsteen felt that he began to recover his rock voice during band 
rehearsal in Asbury Park, when he wrote a new song, "Land of Hope and 
Dreams." "It was our last few days there," Springsteen recalls, "and 
having the band around just felt right. I think differently when I'm 
with them, I write differently. We're a social unit that worked, you 
know? Imagine seven, eight, nine people you went to high school with; 
imagine, you know, you're fifty-two and that's the exact same group of 
people you're working with. That's very, very unusual. I never would 
have written a song like 'Land of Hope and Dreams' for the Tom Joad 
record. I never would have used that title. I would've thought it was 
too broad, that it was a cliche. But with the band, it — it is a big 
title, but what we're gonna do with that, I think we can fill that song 
up, with this group of people, in this circumstance."<br>
"Land of Hope and Dreams" and another song, "American Skin (41 Shots)" —
 the latter inspired by the shooting of unarmed African immigrant Amadou
 Diallo by New York police officers — made it into the tour and the live
 album that followed. At this point, Springsteen knew he wanted to make 
an album with the band. But the context of the project changed again 
after September 11th. In the hours and days that followed the attack, 
Springsteen, like many Americans, was glued to his television set. That 
first day, he took a drive over a nearby bridge where, dead-center, 
there had been a perfect view of the twin towers. His kids wanted to 
know if a plane could crash into their school. He took his family to 
church, which he otherwise rarely attends. "We were in there with the 
rest of the wanna-be's, and it was jammed," he says. "But I found that 
to be very valuable. People just wanted to be with other people who were
 addressing issues of faith and hope and love."<br>
Springsteen can't recall listening to much music in the days that 
followed — though, as is often the case in his life, he took refuge in 
his own. "Yeah, I picked up a guitar," he says. "That's my life 
preserver. I mean, when I go into a strange hotel room, to this day, 
I'll take the guitar out of the case first thing and I'll play for five 
or ten minutes. Then the place feels like mine. So, yeah. Right to the 
guitar."<br>
The task at hand became more focused when Springsteen was asked to open a
 telethon held ten days later to raise money for the September 11th 
Fund. He quickly wrote two songs, "Into the Fire" and "You're Missing," 
but neither felt finished enough to perform — so instead, Jon Landau, 
Springsteen's longtime manager and one of his closest friends, suggested
 he perform "My City of Ruins," a song he'd written and performed a year
 earlier at a Christmas concert. Springsteen calls it "a sort of prayer"
 for his adopted hometown of Asbury Park, which went through a long 
period of economic hardship. The opening lines go like this: "There's a 
blood-red circle on the cold, dark ground/And the rain is falling down, 
the church door's thrown open, I can hear the organ's song/But the 
congregation's gone."<br>
"After that performance," Springsteen says, "when I sat down to write a 
song, whatever I wrote was in that emotional context. The music has to 
be physical, and there has to be a good deal of light to it. And I have 
to find that light truthfully. Which is through the darkness, you know?"<br>
It came as a surprise, then, that one of Springsteen's guides through 
the darkness turned out to be an outsider, Brendan O'Brien. A few years 
earlier, he had expressed interest in working with Springsteen. By the 
time of The Rising, Springsteen felt restless and knew he needed a 
change. "The sounds of records change every five years or so," he says, 
"the technology, the amps they use. And my production ability, it just 
wasn't current enough."<br>
O'Brien came to New Jersey, where Springsteen played him a dozen or so 
new songs. They spent the rest of the afternoon crafting a demo of 
"You're Missing," a ballad built around a melody Springsteen worked up 
one night while messing around on the piano with Patti and the kids.<br>
"At one point," Springsteen recalls, "Brendan said, 'Well, I think we 
should find another chord for this spot.' I said, 'Find another chord?! 
Wait a minute, now! Hold on, hold on!' " He laughs. " 'Those are the 
chords!' But then I'm thinking that my job, now, as the producee, is to 
say yes. So I said OK, we changed it, and it sounded good. Once I got 
comfortable with that, it was like, 'Go, man, go.' By the end of the 
day, we had a real nice demo."<br>
"The biggest difference with making this record," Steven Van Zandt 
agrees, "is that it's the first time that Bruce wrote a collection of 
songs, we went in and recorded them, and he put them out."<br>
Normally, Van Zandt says, "he'd write a bunch of songs, we'd record 
them, then, you know, hang out for a bit, he'd write another bunch of 
songs, we'd record them. What would happen is, we'd always do two or 
three or four records before one finally came out. I produced fifteen 
songs or so for Born in the U.S.A. during the first three weeks. Then I 
left and they kept working for two years! Then they ended up using 
twelve of the original fifteen, I think. So I don't ever remember a case
 where everything was done so quickly, and I think that's why this 
record, conceptually, thematically, is so coherent."<br>
"I remember, when we first went down to Georgia to record, the first 
song we did was 'Into the Fire,' " Springsteen says. "We practiced it 
maybe three times, and then Brendan said, 'OK, come on in, let's do it.'
 And when he played us back that song, I heard something I hadn't heard 
before: I heard the way we sound right now. Today. And I said, 'Well, 
that's what we need to do. If somebody has all our other records, I want
 to make sure they don't have this one.' You can't replace this one with
 some of the other ones. And I think for guys that have made records for
 a long time, that's important."<br>
<br>
<br>
Although Springsteen lived in Los Angeles for several years in the late 
Eighties and early Nineties, he's always seemed most comfortable on his 
native soil. Aside from farming, his ongoing local project has been the 
resurgence of Asbury Park, the coastal town where he lived in the early 
1970s. He played some of his first shows at the now-legendary Stone 
Pony, and he's been involved in the slow economic resurgence of the 
city, playing benefit concerts and remaining an active presence on the 
scene. "He is the Number One cheerleader and supporter of Asbury Park," 
says Domenic Santana, who resurrected the Stone Pony. Springsteen to 
this day plays unannounced shows at the club: Santana says Bruce has the
 combination to the backyard lock and a standing invitation to walk in 
off the street and take the stage whenever he wants. "He's always been 
this city's insurance," Santana says. "That's how I persuaded my parents
 and grandparents to cash in all their 401(k)s, when the banks wouldn't 
touch Asbury Park. I'll never forget, my dad said to me, 'What the hell 
are you smoking?' when I first brought him here to Beirut-by-the-Shore. I
 said, 'You don't understand, there are so many rock &amp; roll memories
 here.' As we were speaking, a bus of Japanese tourists pulled up and 
started taking pictures of the Stone Pony. This abandoned building. My 
father turned to me and said, 'How much did you pay them?' "<br>
Still, on a recent Tuesday afternoon, it's clear that Asbury Park needs 
considerable tending to. A half-mile swath of beach hosts — and this is a
 generous estimate — about thirty sunbathers. The closest, a homeless 
woman, absently fills the back of her shorts with sand. Shuttered motels
 line the main drag, along with a shuttered club called Moving 
Violations, and there's a billboard on the edge of town proclaiming 
god's light of love is still destroying the darkness. Below, a smaller 
italic addendum reads, "Even in Asbury Park!"<br>
And yet, there's a sort of magical feel to the place, thanks, perhaps, 
to the sheer amount of abandoned history. The boardwalk — its wood 
weathered gray — is bookended by grand old art-deco palaces. To the 
south, the long-empty casino sits like a dried-out bee's nest, with its 
shattered window facade and gutted interior. On the opposite end, the 
gorgeous Asbury Park Convention Hall remains dilapidated but functional.
 One of its functions, in recent years, has been as a rehearsal space 
for Springsteen and the E Street Band. This afternoon, the parking area 
houses the E Street fleet: a half-dozen SUVs, a couple of BMWs and 
Springsteen's Corvette.<br>
"I saw my first big concert here," notes Springsteen, who shows up for 
practice in jeans and a black T-shirt. A backpack stuffed with sheet 
music is slung over his shoulder. "It was the Who, Herman's Hermits and 
the Blues Magoos. The Blues Magoos opened, then it was the Who, and 
Herman's Hermits headlined! This was before people here really knew 
about the Who. Nobody knew they were going to smash their instruments. I
 must've been fifteen. I saw Janis Joplin here, and the Doors, too, 
their first time around. I sat right over there." He nods at a bank of 
empty seats, house left, before joining the band onstage. As he chats 
with Van Zandt, Patti Scialfa strolls up the ramp and tickles the back 
of his neck, then grabs her guitar.<br>
And then one of the tightest, most tireless bands of the past 
twenty-five years begins to work through a set. They start with "The 
Rising." Live, the new songs sound huge and untethered. You immediately 
notice the amount of control on the record, and also, as the songs begin
 to accumulate, the number of recurring images. There is, of course, 
smoke, fire, darkness, all of which possess certain mythic qualities. 
But other words recur as well. Touch. Skin. Hugs. Kisses. The best 
gospel songs are often only a word or two away from being great love 
songs — many times quite dirty love songs — all you have to do is 
replace the word God with my baby. Likewise, Springsteen's songs on The 
Rising are suggestive. The opening track, "Lonesome Day," works 
perfectly well, for instance, as a breakup song.<br>
The setting couldn't be more unfrilled: The house lights are up, with 
the rope ladders and ribbed underbelly of the stage clearly visible. The
 house itself remains empty except for a handful of techs, a camera crew
 and someone's Dalmatian, which has been padding around the main floor. 
Still, the band tears into the songs with a thrilled abandon. During the
 audience-participation section of "Waitin' on a Sunny Day," Springsteen
 stops singing and holds his microphone out to the empty house, while 
saxophonist Clarence Clemons coaxes invisible audience members to stand.
 "How ya doin' out there?" Springsteen asks with a smirk, then points 
his mike again. Later, during "Tenth Avenue Freeze Out," a classic song 
about an overweening desire to make it, he grins broadly and does a 
shimmy-dance across the stage.<br>
After two hours, the band retires to a backroom for dinner. Drummer Max 
Weinberg, on hiatus from his day job as Conan O'Brien's bandleader, is 
sitting at the end of a long table with a red-and-white checkered cloth,
 talking up a tension-relieving pillow he's just ordered from the 
Sharper Image catalog. Springsteen ambles over with a bowl of salad and 
grilled fish, shaking his head as he overhears this last bit. "These are
 the topics of conversation backstage now," he sighs. "Swedish pillows."<br>
"They're great pillows," Weinberg insists. "I'll turn you on to them."<br>
Scialfa, a willowy redhead who, today, is wearing a black tank top and 
pants and working on a bowl of mussels, mentions that she, too, saw the 
Doors in this very building, at the same show as her husband, though 
they didn't know each other then. "I just wanted to be Jim Morrison," 
she says.<br>
"I saw Jefferson Airplane here," Weinberg says. "Procul Harum."<br>
"I saw that show!" Springsteen exclaims happily.<br>
"I was there, too," Scialfa says.<br>
"I remember going to a Hullabaloo Club concert here," Springsteen says.<br>
"It was the first black light I'd ever seen. I walked in and couldn't 
figure out what happened to my shirt!" A few minutes later, he 
continues, without much of a segueway, "You know, my kids used to burst 
into tears whenever they saw Steve Van Zandt."<br>
Scialfa snorts out a laugh. "You couldn't wait to introduce that!" she 
says. "They were babies." She shrugs. "And he looked like a pirate."<br>
Springsteen and Scialfa have never been on the road without their kids. 
"This tour," she says, "they begged, wept, 'Please don't make us go!' It
 is isolating. Plus, who wants to watch their parents?"<br>
Soon, it is time to return to the stage. The most powerful moment comes a
 few songs in, when Springsteen sits at the piano to perform "My City of
 Ruins," while the band looks silently on. He sings, "Now there's tears 
on the pillow, darlin', where we slept, and you took my heart when you 
left. Without your sweet kiss, my soul is lost, my friend. Tell me, how 
do I begin again?"<br>
Springsteen still remembers the moment he realized that he needed to 
make this album. It was a few days after September 11th, and he was 
leaving the beach. A man drove by, rolled his window down and yelled, 
"We need ya!" Then he rolled his window up and kept going. "And I 
thought, well, I've probably been a part of this guy's life for a while,
 and people wanna see other people they know, they wanna be around 
things they're familiar with. So he may need to see me right about now. 
That made me sense, like, 'Oh, I have a job to do.' Our band, hopefully,
 we were built to be there when the chips are down. That was part of the
 idea of the band, to provide support. The most fundamental thing I hear
 from fans, constantly, is, 'Man, you got me through' — whatever it 
might be. 'My divorce. My graduation. My high school. This part of my 
life, that part.' " Bruce Springsteen chuckles once more. "And I usually
 wanna say back, 'Well, you know, you guys got me through quite a bit 
yourselves!' " Then he laughs again, this time much louder.</div>

“Blue-Collar Troubadour.”<br>
By Chet Flippo<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
At 34, Bruce Springsteen has never been better, as his barnstorming road show rolls across the U.S.A.<br>
<br>
Groaning and sweating cannonballs, Bruce Springsteen jounces along in 
the passenger seat of a packed-to-the-gunwales van barreling out of 
downtown Detroit at 4 in the a.m. He radiates waves of locker-room 
Ben-Gay powerful enough to knock down a charging rhino at 30 yards. And 
he’s happy. Happy as only a certifiably fanatical rock’n’roller can be 
when he has just strapped on his Fender Telecaster guitar and blown away
 24,039 also certifiable rock fans in the very heart of Motor City. Home
 of the Cadillac and of the Motown Sound. A tough audience. Bruce had 
just brought them to their knees with three and a half hours of 
no-mercy, flat-out rock n roll played the way God intended, and now he 
is suffering for it. Even after a half-hour rubdown by his trainer, 
Bruce aches from the grueling marathon of singing, dancing and 
screaming.<br>
Man, he rasps in that familiar Jersey Shore staccato, this was a four 
and a half tonight. A visitor crammed up against a guitar case behind 
him asks what he means. I usually lose between three and five pounds 
during a show, he says. This felt like a four point five. He laughs a 
contented laugh, and the van sails on through the night.<br>
<br>
After laying out for three years, the Boss is back with a vengeance. 
Back with no flash, no lasers, no glitter, no glove. Back with his 
highly personal brand of straight-ahead, gloves-off rock overlaid with a
 deceptively folksy vox populi that has made him the poet of the 
blue-collar baby boomers, for whom his carefully wrought songs sound 
like letters from home. Just as Hank Williams and Woody Guthrie did 
before him, Springsteen articulates the thoughts of an entire class of 
people. And right now nobody does it better. In Detroit Springsteen 
learned that his new album, Born in the<br>
U.S.A., was No. 1 on the charts, the LP s first single release, Dancing 
in the Dark, was No. 2, and the tour was steaming along at such a pace 
that he had sold 202,027 tickets—that s 10 nights—at Brendan Byrne Arena
 in home state New Jersey in just two days. And the tour (this week 
Bruce is in Washington, D.C.) is going to continue for at least a year, 
with forays to Canada, the Far East and Europe.<br>
Given all that, the trappings of rock superstardom were astonishingly 
absent backstage at Detroit s Joe Louis Arena earlier on the balmy 
summer evening. The fans milling around outside were so well-mannered 
that even the cops were yawning. No stretch limos for the rock stars; 
just unobtrusive vans. No stiletto-heeled, slit-skirted, glossy groupies
 stalking their turf. In the dressing rooms and the tunnels backstage, 
there were no drugs and nothing stronger to drink than beer.<br>
Welcome to the Hardy Boys on the Road, laughs a management associate. 
She’s kidding, of course, but there s a hearty, all-American air to the 
proceedings that one doesn’t usually find at this sort of event. Sit 
down, comes a holler from a man with a familiar rock face. He s 
assistant road manager Chris Chappel, for many years in The Who s 
organization. Chappel explains he s happy to be here for many reasons. 
For one: Sanity, no drugs. For another, he s a fan: When I first saw 
Bruce at Hammersmith Odeon [in London] in 1975, I knew immediately that 
the rock n roll torch had been passed from the Beatles and the Stones 
and The Who to him. I had never seen such a great show. And I still 
haven't." Meanwhile, Bruce is winding up his usual exhaustive soundcheck
 in a cavernous hall. He is one of the few rockers who bothers to do a 
walk-through, listening carefully from every area of the hall while his 
band is playing. Then he disappears into his dressing room, to remain 
alone until the show starts.<br>
This is a typically exuberant Bruce crowd, screaming Brr—uuu—ce chants 
that sound like "boos" to the uninitiated. They hold up lighted matches 
and those 99-cent discount lighters and scream for Br—uuce some more. 
Then they stomp and shake the floor and do the Wave and cheer each 
other. When Bruce finally gains the stage at 8:35 p.m., the spontaneous 
roar from 24,039 throats is seismic, physically felt, unsettling in its 
Intensity. Most performers never get this kind of ovation when their 
concerts end. Bruce is clearly among friends In Detroit. He's a folk 
hero in his biker boots, tight jeans, kerchief headband and 
short-sleeved sport shirt with Its sleeves rolled up to display his 
newly pumped-up biceps. And he's sporting a proud attitude that proves 
to be contagious when he rips into Born in the US.A., a blue-collar 
anthem of the '80s if ever there was one (kid gets drafted, sent to 
Vietnam, then prison and every other raw deal possible, but remains a 
"cool rocking Daddy In the U.S.A."). The applause is, of course, 
thunderous. Some of the blue collars in the $14 seats behind the stage 
(all tickets are $14 or $15) unfurl American flags.<br>
The show, measured by any rock standard, is brilliant. The E Street Band
 is solid enough to support the World Trade Center. Springsteen's pacing
 of 30 or so songs over almost four hours is improvised, based on the 
mood of the crowd. He leaps into the audience during Tenth Avenue 
Freezeout, pressing the flesh like an old pole and eliciting the 
predictable hosannas for being an authentic man of the people. Truly, 
though, of any rock star today, he is the only one who can fearlessly 
wade into a crowd and know that the crowd will protect him. He can hush 
the crowd in a second when he starts an eerie, haunting tale of a mass 
murder in the song Nebraska, his hollow vocal accompanied only by his 
own harmonica breaks and by Nils Lofgren's sepulchral guitar. Welcome to
 the First Church of Rock, brothers and sisters. Then the Reverend Bruce
 gets into his preaching rap. Waving his arms and assuming his best 
Sunday morning mode (he likes to watch TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart), he
 intones: "Do you believe, that if you die, during the course of this 
show, due to excitement, that you're going to HEAVEN?" Cheers from most,
 some of whom spill their beers and worse things on less fortunate 
brothers and sisters. "Did you know," he continues later, "that God 
created the Pink Cadillac, and He said it was great!" And with that 
Springsteen tears into Pink Cadillac, a searing rocker that cheerfully 
meets every definition of what rock haters say is wrong with rock 'n' 
roll (mainly the celebration of free will).<br>
Bruce then sits on the lip of the stage and tells stories: about how he 
almost became a baseball player before rock 'n'roll saved him, about his
 childhood, about his relationship with his father. He becomes a 
beneficent uncle, and the crowd is transformed into rapt children, 
hanging on every word and laughing at the right times. Then Bruce, like 
any savvy showman, gets them up on their feet and dancing as he piles 90
 mph encore on 110 mph encore, till he literally exhausts the crowd. 
They file out, drained and smiling, long after midnight. If you hadn't 
known better, you might have thought that a tent revival had just let 
out. Perhaps it had. An hour or so later, after getting his rubdown and 
recovering, Bruce sits down in his dressing room for a rare interview. 
He drinks mineral water and offers his visitor the same. He's wearing 
his layer of Ben-Gay beneath two sweatshirts, G.l. jungle-camouflage 
pants and suede cowboy boots. Up close, he is quite extraordinary 
looking, with the sort of sculpted features that Hollywood executives 
and art directors lust after. Though he doesn't often do so, he clearly 
likes to talk—even about the new fitness program that got him those new 
muscles.<br>
"Well," he laughs, "I had never exercised before in my whole life, 
y'know? And I didn't tour after the Nebraska record, I didn't feel like 
going out on the road. And I met this trainer, Phil Dunphy, and he said 
come on down, and he just got me into it, into strength training and 
weight training and running." (At 34, the Boss spreads a lean 155 pounds
 on his 5'10" frame.) "Do you know that I run six miles a day now?" he 
says, seemingly surprised himself. "It's really helped on the road. 
Before, I would come out the first night, and I'd almost die, wanna 
throw up, gaspin' for air."<br>
Still, Springsteen is hardly a health nut. "It's just that I'm not like I
 was," he says, which was a thin, wiry, almost waiflike junk-food 
addict. "You know, when I was growing up, I never ate in a restaurant 
till I was 22 years old; that's when I got a record deal. My parents 
never ate out. They didn't have the dough. All I knew was fast, 
fast-food. That's all I had the dough for. Later, any kind of restaurant
 was intimidating. Like, what do you say to the guy who meets you at the
 door, what do you call him…? Maitre d', right. Yeah, who knows? I 
didn't know."<br>
Springsteen's American Dream-like ascent from poverty forms the basis 
for many of his autobiographical songs. Born in 1949 in Freehold, N.J., 
he was the first of three children born to Douglas and Adele 
Springsteen. His father, a bus driver, was often out of work. An 
unexceptional student, Bruce by his own account was "dead" until he got a
 pawnshop guitar when he was 13. "I know that rock 'n' roll changed my 
life," he says with feeling. "It was something for me to hold on to. I 
had nothing. Before then the whole thing was a washout for me. It really
 gave me a sense of myself – and it allowed me to become useful, which I
 think most people want to be." Once he discovered rock 'n' roll, he 
took to it with a missionary zeal that has never abated. Music was not 
just the best thing going for Bruce; it was the only thing. Even girls 
and cars occupied a distant second and third place.<br>
He briefly tried Ocean County College and then, after staying behind 
when his family moved to California in 1969, became a permanent fixture 
of the club scene on the Jersey Shore, specifically in Asbury Park. 
Basically a seedy boardwalk town, Asbury Park, with its raucous, 
late-night rock clubs, was a magnet for scuffling young musicians. As 
the fastest guitar in town, Bruce became the Boss of a lively scene that
 included the likes of Miami Steve Van Zandt and Southside Johnny Lyon. 
As Bruce's manager, Jon Landau, points out, this was a strong bar band 
enclave that was totally isolated from the trendy music centers and one 
based entirely on traditional rock 'n' roll, on Elvis and Chuck Berry 
and Buddy Holly. On top of those foundations Springsteen built his own 
tradition with his strongest points: his ability to people his songs 
with believable characters and his genuine talent for storytelling.<br>
That he did so without compromising his musical integrity says much for 
his perseverance, especially when you remember that the biggest hurdle 
in his career was his too-much-too-soon appearances on the covers of 
Newsweek and Time the same week in 1975, just after his commercial 
breakthrough with the Born to Run single and album release. Scoffers 
charged "hype" about the hoopla, leaving Bruce wary of the press, but 
Born to Run remains a rock benchmark, encapsulating Springsteen's psalms
 on rock 'n' roll as a way of life: rock theology.<br>
A lapsed Catholic, Bruce says Born to Run "really dealt with faith and a
 searching for answers. On that record I laid out a set of values. A set
 of ideas…intangibles like faith and hope, belief in friendship and in a
 better day. But you don't really know what those values are worth until
 you test them," he admits. "So many things happened to me so fast. I 
had to focus on the music and not on what was going on around me with 
the media thing or the lawsuit thing [brought by his former manager 
about recording and publishing rights]. I always felt that if the music 
was right, I could survive. But if that went wrong, then that was the 
end of it."<br>
It went very right. At around $15 per ticket at most shows, Bruce's tour
 is not raking in what the Jacksons’ is, but this former poor boy from 
Jersey does only what he wants to. No watch or shrill alarm clocks ever 
schedules Springsteen. His world moves when he's ready. He finally 
bought a three story brick mansion in Rumson, N.J., but he doesn't get 
home often. He's still a loner, still cruising on the highway alone, 
still hitting the clubs on the Jersey Shore. Bruce's new hit single,<br>
Cover Me, suggests he might feel a need now to share his life. ("Hold me
 in your arms/Let's let our love blind us/Cover me"), but Bruce keeps 
insisting he's not ready yet to write "married music." The girlfriends 
remain just that and no more.<br>
There's no question, though, that Springsteen's life and work involve 
heavy moral overtones. Not many rock 'n' rollers would dare to say, as 
does Bruce, that "mainly all my records try to offer some sort of 
survival course. Maybe you can't dream the same dreams when you're 34 
that you did when you were 24, you know, but you _ can still dream 
something. Maybe you've got to downsize some of your expectations. I 
know I have. Just in growing up, in accepting adulthood. My characters, I
 think that's what they do. They say, 'Man, I had some --—thrown at me, 
but here I still am.' That's strong and realistic, and that's what I 
want. To just paint the heroic things. Like my sister and her husband."<br>
To Springsteen, sister Virginia, husband Mickey and their two sons are 
idols. "They were married when they were kids," says Bruce. "They went 
through some hard times, got a house and raised the kids, and I admire 
them a lot. My sister's tremendously, unbelievably strong. This is real 
inspiration. Like in the song My Hometown, these are the heroic things 
that happen in most people's lives. Everyday things between them and 
their kids. Just talks and husbands and wives and families. But those 
talks maintain a sense of continuity and a sense of values. I guess 
that's hard to do these days. I know it's hard for me to do."<br>
When it gets too much, the Born to Run kid does just that. "I like to 
travel," says Bruce. "To me, the idea is you get a band, write some 
songs and go out to people's towns. It's my favorite thing. It's like a 
circus. You just kind of roll on, walk into somebody's town and, bang ! 
It's heart to heart. Something can happen to you; something can happen 
to them. You feel you can make a difference in somebody's life. All I'm 
trying to do is wake up people's senses and do the same thing for 
myself. I want to make their bodies tingle. Make their blood run. Make 
them I scream."<br>
And the place Springsteen does that best is onstage. "Some nights when 
I'm up there, I feel like the king of the world." he says. "It's the 
greatest feeling on earth. I can go home and get in that bed and sleep 
real sound. It's a beautiful thing.Beautiful. It can tune you into 
everything, what's happening with people everywhere. For the moment I 
feel young. Young, and I'm strong. I get the strength and the energy to 
do it from the crowd. I don't want to pass that by."</div>

"Ambitions, Lies &amp; Beautiful Reward: Bruce Springsteen's Family Values"<br>
by Bill Flanagan</strong><br>
<br>
At the World Music Theatre, a big new shed sitting out in a corn field 
an hour south of Chicago, Bruce Springsteen and his new band are playing
 "Better Days" to an empty room. It's afternoon soundcheck for the first
 of two nights at the World. When Springsteen finishes the song, distant
 cheering comes from somewhere beyond the grassy embankment that rises 
behind the last row of seats. "There's people out there! Bruce calls 
into his mike and another distant roar answers. It's the sound of 
early-arriving fans, camped out beyond the gates. Bruce's wife, Patti 
Scialfa, approaches from the wings, slips on her guitar and she and 
Bruce practice their "Brilliant Disguise" harmonies three or four times.
 But Patti's got something on her mind more pressing than practice. She 
confers anxiously with her husband while the band stands in place. He 
listens, answers, listens again, then nods. Patti rushes offstage, a big
 smile on her face, saying, "Where's the E-man?" A minute later she 
comes back carrying Evan Springsteen, two years old and wearing 
protective plastic ear muffs. Evan is psyched. Patti puts him down next 
to his dad and Bruce takes Patti's vocal mike off its stand, says in an 
Elvis voice, “Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce a special 
guest," and puts the mike in Evan's hand.<br>
Bruce starts playing "Johnny B. Goode," mouthing the words for the 
little boy like come on, son, you know this one. Evan's inherited his 
father's onstage stance—he plants his little feet far apart, puts the 
mike to his mouth and—when Dad gets to the "go go"s Evan sings, "wo wo!"
 Bruce is playing, the band is tapping along, Uncle Roy Bittan comes 
down from the keyboard riser to clap Evan on and Bruce is smiling at his
 kid and insisting, "Go! Go!" and Evan is insisting "Wo! Wo! " Go, 
Johnny, Wo, Johnny, Wo Wo Johnny B. Goode. Bruce shifts to a Bo Diddley 
beat and tries to get Evan to sing, "Papa gonna buy you a mockingbird" 
but Evan won't let go of the wowos.<br>
The band, laughing (and not minding one bit that this means supper is on
 the table), slips away. Patti sits down on the stage chatting with 
bandmember Crystal Taliefero. Evan's little sister Jessica finds her way
 out and Bruce scoops up both his babies and walks around the drums with
 a kid in each arm. It could be the living room of any young family, 
except for all the musical equipment. These are Bruce Springsteen's 
better days.<br>
It's a big change," Bruce says when asked about traveling with this new 
family. "In the past I think one of the ideas of the road was the idea 
of escape. The other idea is the search for adventure or experience. For
 me, part of it was throwing off whatever your daily life is. Even when 
you're traveling in a van with six other guys, it's all-consuming. It's 
not that particular thing for me anymore. So the trick now was to make 
it all work together. It's been going good.<br>
"If I have any knowledge about the way that relationships work— whether 
it's partners or kids—it's, you gotta be there. That's what kids want—to
 see you on a steady basis. That's the most fundamental thing that you 
communicate. Particularly when they're real young. The first five or six
 weeks everybody was adjusting to it. Particularly because at the time 
the schedule was tighter and the show felt so exhausting. That took a 
little reorienting. 'I can't play this many shows this close together 
'cause then when I go home all I'm going to do is sleep.'" Springsteen 
laughs. "I'm not going to be any good to anybody. So we sorted it out, 
the spacing is slightly better, and it's been great. I've got plenty of 
energy, we all travel together. I really, really enjoy it. Part of what 
Patti<br>
does with me is say, 'Get out there and work! Get out there! Say what 
you've got to say.' And if you feel what you have to say has some value,
 that's what you want to do."<br>
On "Local Hero," one of the cornerstones of his concerts and his Lucky 
Town album, Springsteen tells the story of a man who finds his way home 
from a debilitating life of fame and travel. He is rescued by a "gypsy 
girl," he settles down with her, but Iying in bed he still hears the 
highway call. It's a funnier version of the story he told in a “Cautious
 Man" on Tunnel of Love. No matter how happy domestic life gets, the 
character still hears temptation whispering.<br>
"Oh yeah!" Springsteen says. "You got to! You don't ever not hear that. 
That never goes away. That's the point. That's what makes your choice 
mean something." Maybe what Springsteen's figured out that the Local 
Hero and the Cautious Man haven't is that it's a false choice: When the 
family man hears the road calling he can go to it—and take the wife and 
kids along.<br>
Springsteen is closing most of his shows with My Beautiful Reward, a 
song of vague dislocation, in which the narrator surveys everything he 
has and wonders why he still has not found complete satisfaction. In the
 final verse, in an unusual flight of poetry, the singer turns into a 
black bird and soars over gray fields and rivers, still searching.<br>
"I think I saw the image somewhere in a book," Springsteen says. When I 
started I planned to write a nice song about my kids. It just took a 
funny turn. It was one of those songs like 'Highway Patrolman' in that 
there was a certain inconclusiveness to it that always made me feel like
 it wasn't finished. I kept trying to make it nice and neat, to tie up 
the ending and make it more concrete. After I recorded it I thought, 'I 
didn't quite get it on this one.' But then it started to come out and I 
realized it was right the way it was. It's one of those songs you don't 
consciously write—it comes up out of your unconscious or subconscious. 
That's why it's better than the stuff you slave over. I haven't tried to
 really interpret it. It was dealing with death in some fashion." <br>
It suggests both the possibility of finally finding your beautiful 
reward, and also the chance that even when your soul is floating out of 
your body you'll still be looking for it in vain.<br>
Springsteen answers, "I think it's that there is no concrete it, that 
idea that you reach a point where a) everything's okay, b) you're going 
to be happy now forever, c) you figure out everything. That's not the 
way life is lived, that's not the human experience. I think that when 
you begin to deal concretely with your own mortality and your family and
 your partner, death becomes a big part of that equation. You see your 
children. Well. Your children are your afterlife, there they are. And 
your love with your partner is, too. That lives on through your kids. 
That's your after life.<br>
"Forty-two is still really young, but it's old enough to see the whole 
picture, and it's old enough to stop living completely for yourself and 
to start seeing the lines that you're leaving, how things start to 
spread out in front of you. That was a good song to finish the record 
with because I wasn't trying to make an Everything's Coming Up Roses 
kind of record. I was trying to make a record that was really strongly 
positive and had a feeling of real love in it and real hope. Because 
I've felt and found those things in my own life. But I wasn't trying to 
present it as a blueprint. I was trying to stay away from all the fairy 
tale stuff. That song expresses a little bit of the part of everybody 
that's always alone. It's not like any of my early road songs, it's not 
about escape. It's about coming to terms with different realities. Sort 
of a confrontation with your own individual soul or spirit. But I think 
it was an important end for that record. I was trying to write aboutlike
 in 'Big Muddy'—moral ambivalence and moral ambiguousness. Hey, morality
 is something a lot of people can't afford."<br>
One of the reasons “Beautiful Reward" comes as a surprise is that while 
his early songs contained great bursts of poetic language, Springsteen 
has for years pared his Iyrics down to basics. On this tour, when he 
performs “Growin' Up" or even “Thunder Road," the change in his 
songwriting over the years is striking. He says that change was 
premeditated.<br>
“There were two reasons. I altered the language of music. And I wanted 
to get away from the Dylan comparisons at the time. Which, really, I go 
back now and the songs had a lot of imagery in them but they weren't 
like Bob's songs at all. But at the time I was self-conscious about it 
and trying to find my own voice. I just felt like I wanted to speak more
 directly. I liked the way Robbie Robertson was writing at the time with
 the Band. Sort of colloquial. It sounded like people telling stories 
and talking about themselves, as if you were sitting on the couch. So I 
started to go in that direction. In the end I'm not sure what difference
 it makes in communicating, but at the time it was<br>
something I wanted to pursue and I've gone that way ever since. I tend 
to opt for simplicity and clarity. I like the images to be clear."<br>
Singing songs like "Growin' Up" now, Springsteen says, "They all had 
funny imagery and a lot of humor in them. And I got some of that back on
 Lucky Town. That humor's sometimes the toughest thing for me to get 
into my music."<br>
What's changed a lot on Lucky Town, though, is the degree to which 
Springsteen is writing in the first person—his new songs are sung by me"
 to "you." There's no Magic Rat, no Highway Patrolman, standing in.<br>
"You get more comfortable with who you are and you create less of a 
persona," Springsteen says. "I was concerned about the music being that.
 That's what I was looking for. That's what I waited for when I was off:
 to find something that felt like the music I should be singing now. 
Something I felt would be defining to my audience, that would help 
people get a fix on where I'm standing and who I am. I waited for quite a
 while for that stuff to come out and for me to be able to get to it. I 
initially tried to write more genre-like. Some of the better examples of
 that ended up on Human Touch. I alwavs say. 'Oh. I'll make this album 
10 rock songs or 10 this or 10 that, get away from searching searching 
all the time.' If I put more records out maybe I'd have an opportunity 
to do that. I'd like to put more records out, but I always say that and 
never do.<br>
"I had been through a lot of changes and a lot of experiences through 
the '80s. I think people listen to my music to find out about 
themselves. I've got to press to find out about myself before I can 
broaden it and present it. So it took a while. But it felt good."<br>
I tell Springsteen that it's surprising to hear how much his writing is 
affected by his expectations of how it will be heard. In the '70s he 
worried about irrelevant Dylan comparisons, in the '90s he sweats over 
what his audience expects.<br>
"I guess," he says softly. Yeah, yeah. I believe everybody who writes 
has an audience in his head, whether it's an imaginary audience or your 
real audience. I had a feeling who my audience was most of the time and 
why people came to my music or bought my records or came to my shows. I 
felt I knew what I was delivering that drew people to those things. At 
least a core of the people that have come. I always write with an 
audience in mind. Not in terms of if it'll be a big hit, but in terms of
 what the music's delivering. It's pretty simple—I try to write really 
well, I try to write emotionally. And if I feel that coming back at me 
then I feel like I'm doing my job. That's why people come to my 
music—for some emotional experience or a perspective, either on their 
own lives or on the world that they're living in, or on their 
relationships. For a perspective.<br>
"Until I get some perspective on it, I can't find it. Once I find a 
point of view, that's where I'm standing and that's when the records are
 released. That's what gives me the motivation to come out and travel 
and tour and work and try to stay a part of the thread of people's 
lives, just by doing my job." Bruce lets out a laugh. "It feels like a 
big job a lot of the time. I'm historically ambivalent at this point; 
it's just always been a part of my personality that I say,<br>
'Gee, maybe I should've been a truck driver.' It's baloney but everybody
 does it. Maybe it's a way of escaping whatever you feel the 
responsibility of your job is.<br>
"I've tried to keep my eye on the ball, to keep a clear view of those 
things. And I try to be consistent with the characters. The guy on 
'Beautiful Reward' is the guy on 'Born to Run.' Hey, that's where life 
has taken these people. I always try to make sure the stuff I'm writing 
is inclusive in that sense. That it's broad enough. It's partly about me
 but for it to work right it's got to also be partly about you. If it's 
just one or the other something's missing."<br>
Springsteen moves around his dressing room. Outside the fans are coming 
in. "I'd like to do more experimental things," he says. "Things where I 
step out of that specific chronology. I feel like I need to find an 
outlet that will sort of allow me to take a side road here and a side 
road there. If I made more records I'd be able to do that, even if they 
were less consistent in some fashion."<br>
Like Neil Young?<br>
"Yeah! He goes over here and over there. I like the idea of that 
freedom. I don't tend to do it on my own. At some point I'd like to find
 some place to move like that."<br>
Out in the backstage corridor is Roy Bittan, the happiest man in 
Illinois. I've never seen Roy this happy. He's been Springsteen's 
keyboard player for 18 years, he's been a top session pianist, he's the 
only member of the E Street Band still playing with Bruce, he 
co-produced the Human Touch album and even cowrote two songs, he's got a
 beautiful wife, a wonderful son, a beach house in Malibu, but that's 
not why Roy is so happy. "I just got the R&amp;R numbers!" he tells the 
other musicians, who may or may not know that Radio Records is a 
broadcasting tipsheet. "We're the second most added record in the 
country! Only Bobby Brown is ahead of us!" Roy is bouncing off the 
walls. No, it's not a Bruce Springsteen record he's so excited about. 
It's "Sometimes Love<br>
Just Ain't Enough by Patty Smyth with Don Henley, a single from a new 
Patty Smyth album produced by (drum roll)—Roy Bittan. Roy has been 
trying to establish himself as a record producer for years (Springsteen 
says he is especially fond of an album Roy produced last year for 
singer/songwriter Will T. Massey). The fact that Bruce made Roy 
co-producer of his album was a huge boost—but as all Springsteen albums 
are produced by a team that includes Bruce, manager Jon Landau and 
engineer Chuck Plotkin, it did not necessarily establish Roy as a 
first-call record maker in the eyes of the industry. Getting a hit for 
Patty Smyth does. I mention to Roy that I could call a friend at 
Billboard to find out next week's chart position. Roy's eyes light up. 
We go to a pay phone and Roy stands there saying (or praying), "Let it 
go to number nine. Nine, nine, nine, nine."<br>
"It's number seven, Roy." "SEVEN! IT'S NUMBER SEVEN!! I'M TOP TEN!" Roy 
goes off to share the good news with Landau, co-manager Barbara Carr, 
the crew, the cook, the security guard....<br>
Roy is the link between the glory days of the E Street Band and the 
risky new course Springsteen's set out on. Chances are the E Street Band
 will play again (as he started this tour Springsteen surprised his old 
bandmates with a generous and unexpected gift—royalties on all the 
albums they made together), but Springsteen talks about wanting the 
freedom to make any kind of album with any different musicians. He talks
 about making a whole album with the sort of bass-driven, dense sound of
 the re-mixed "57 Channels," or an album that builds songs to 
accommodate his guitar playing, instead of the other way around. He has a
 lot of ideas and this band is only the first of them.<br>
This band started with Bruce and Roy and a young trio—guitarist Shane 
Fontayne (ex-Mick Ronson, Mick Taylor, Lone Justice, with Jimmy Page 
hair, stagger and British accent), Tommy Sims (a session bassist for 
everyone from Divinyls to Garth Brooks who has never before gone on the 
road) and Zachary Alford, the young drummer of the New York band 
Bodybag. That was the band that did "Saturday Night Live" and played a 
private showcase at New York's Bottom Line. At that Bottom Line show 
Bruce brought up singer Bobby King to duet on a couple of the more 
soul-based songs from Human Touch. After the show, King was invited to 
do the whole tour. Back in Los Angeles, with the first date of the tour 
breathing down their necks and a live nationwide radio<br>
broadcast even closer, Springsteen started auditioning background 
singers. To save time he had them come in and sing in groups, 
eliminating vocalists one by one until there was no one else he could 
bear to cut. That's how Bruce ended up with four backup vocalists beside
 King— Cleopatra Kennedy (ex-Diana Ross and James Cleveland), Gia 
Ciambotti (from the Graces), Carol Dennis (longtime Dylan backup) and 
Angel Rogers (Stevie Wonder, Paula Abdul). Five days before the radio 
broadcast they made one more addition—Crystal Taliefero, a 
singer/guitarist/ percussionist/sax player who has become Bruce's main 
onstage foil. All these musicians took a little time to become a band. 
Some of them weren't even all too sure who Bruce Springsteen was and 
were startled at the size and fervor of his audiences. During an 11-show
 stand at the Brendan<br>
Byrne Arena in New Jersey in July and August the band found itself. 
Initially Bruce was carrying the whole show without the safety net the E
 Street Band had always provided. Early concerts felt a little too 
careful, as if the players were more scared than enthused, which 
sometimes forced Bruce dangerously close to the line where great 
showmanship slips into shtick. Afternoon soundchecks were spent with 
Bruce teaching the band more and more songs from his catalog, which 
they'd perform in public that night. No wonder some of them looked a 
little shellshocked. But over the course of those 11 Jersey concerts the
 musicians relaxed, got to know the songs and each other a lot better, 
and found their confidence as a unit. By the last night, when Bruce 
pulled out "Sandy" and "Rosalita," the new group seemed to have learned 
the lesson of the rollercoaster—how to have fun with terror. They rolled
 into Massachusetts with what some longtime fans dared to call the best 
Springsteen concerts ever. Band consensus is that they topped those in 
Philadelphia. Tonight in Illinois, they are sailing. The balance between
 new material and old, which tilted backward in New Jersey, is moving 
toward the new stuff again. "57 Channels" has grown from the 
Albert-Ayler-learns-guitar version of "Saturday Night Live" into a 
raging indictment of Republican policy with police sirens wailing and a 
throbbing chant of "No justice, no peace." "Souls of the Departed" has 
become one of several guitar blow-outs where Springsteen challenges his 
usual limits. Tonight he<br>
takes it into Hendrix's "Star-Spangled Banner." Soul Driver" has lost 
its gospel lilt and become a slow, moody piece a little like something 
from Van Morrison's Veedon Fleece. Springsteen rewards the attention his
 fans pay to this new material with lots of his hits, as well as 
crowd-pleasing bonuses like Working on the Highway" and "Darlington 
County."<br>
Bruce explains, “I had a variety of theories before I started the tour 
about what I was going to do, but you don't know until you get out 
there. I thought I was gonna be playing a shorter show." He laughs. 
"That's almost always wrong. The minute you step in an arena. . . An 
arena is a funnv thing. Just the word itself: the stadium. the coliseum.
 the forum. The scale of the places generally calls for some large 
heroic or antiheroic action. I think the size of the show over the years
 expanded to meet that particular thing I felt in air. That's kinda what
 people come for. The arena is a bigger-than-life experience. I think 
once you step out of the theater it's a different ball game. So I'm 
probably playing longer than I thought I would be and playing more old 
things than I thought I would be as the result of playing longer. As the
 show expanded I followed the line of the way the thing moved and felt 
and what resonated best. About 60 per cent new stuff and 40 per cent old
 is what feels good on a nightly basis right now.”<br>
Springsteen was always a cautious man about how to present his live 
shows. He played clubs until long after he was big enough to fill 
theaters, he stayed in theaters when arenas made more sense, he stuck to
 arenas when stadiums were beckoning, finally moved to stadiums with 
great success in 1985, and then—for the 1988 Tunnel of Love tour 
insisted on going back to arenas. <br>
“I was always paranoid of expansion," Bruce says. "What was I going to 
lose? That's how I approached life in general: I couldn't imagine what 
I'd gain, I could only see what I'd lose."<br>
It's between sets and I settle into the backstage hospitality room when a
 horde of people with guest passes pour through the door en masse and 
start stripping the buffet. It's like the stateroom scene in Night at 
the Opera, they fill the place and keep coming. Ah, I figure, radio 
contest winners ! No, I'm corrected, Crystal Taliefero's guest list. 
Crystal—a fireball on and offstage—grew up in nearby Indiana and played 
in local hero John Mellencamp's band. Everyone she ever met called her 
for tickets to this. After the show, at a private party at a chic 
restaurant that's been opened just for the band, I'm introduced to 
Crystal's dad Charles, a real nice man. He asks what I do and I tell him
 I work at a music magazine, that I got a call yesterday at suppertime 
asking if I could be in Chicago the next morning to spend three days 
with Springsteen. It was a mad rush, I say, but you know, I gesture to 
the fancy surroundings, there are harder jobs. "Yeah," he says. "You 
could work in an oil refinery. Like me."<br>
We get the word that soup's on and choose tables while waiters pile up 
our plates. Bruce and Patti arrive like the bride and groom at a wedding
 reception and go around the room saying hi. During some shows Bruce 
tells the crowd that since he's not selling records anymore, he's had to
 take on a sponsor this tour. The fans boo and he tells them, “But it's 
not a beer! It's not an athletic sneaker! This tour is sponsored by 
LOVE!” Now it's not my place to say this, but I think the company that 
might be able to overcome Springsteen's historic aversion to corporate 
sponsorship is Chef Boy-ar-Dee. Because, let me tell you, this tour is 
the pasta express. There's noodles cooking in the hospitality room, 
there's angel hair steaming in the catering room, before Bruce goes on 
stage he sits in his dressing room chowing down on spaghetti, and 
tonight—for a special treat—he's leading everybody through a fancy 2 
a.m. multi-pasta dinner. In spite of his Dutch name, Springsteen is of 
Irish and Italian heritage. If his father's Irishness sometimes emerges 
in the black fatalism that underlines even his most joyous music, his 
mother's Italianness sure dominates Bruce's menu.<br>
Bruce and Patti take a seat at a table with Zack, Shane and Gia and 
Bruce regales his new musicians with tall tales of the E Street Band's 
adventures. There was the Jersey club owner who thought an amp was too 
loud, so he pulled out a gun and shot it. There was the time when the 
band reached football stadiums that Roy Bittan and Nils Lofgren were so 
engrossed in a ping-pong game that they didn't know the rest of the band
 had gone on. The musicians who were onstage could not get the attention
 of an excited Springsteen, who looked out at the mass of humanity and 
screamed "ONE TWO THREE FOUR! Instead of Roy's majestic synthesizer hook
 opening "Born in the U.S.A.," he heard the dink dink dink of Danny 
Federici playing the line on the high end of the piano. Bruce laughs and
 says, "I looked down and saw 80,000 people going huh?"<br>
That story gets a big laugh from the new musicians, but it sends a chill
 through crew members who were there. They remember Bruce coming 
offstage at intermission and looking for the guy whose job was to 
collect the band before the show. Bruce held up his hand and asked, "How
 many fingers? Five? How many with this hand, too? Ten? Now how many 
people in the band? How high do you have to be able to count?”<br>
There's a lot that's fun in hitching along on Springsteen's ride, but 
there's a lot of responsibility, too. Jon Landau is Springsteen's 
manager, his record producing partner, probably his best friend. Landau 
is considered to be one of the shrewdest and toughest powers in the 
record business. But it would be a mistake to think of Springsteen as 
the friendly guy, Landau as the tough one; Bruce as the pal, Jon as the 
boss; Bruce as the music, Jon as the business. They're both both. They 
work together so well<br>
because they are a lot alike. Over at his table, Landau talks quietly 
about Springsteen's relationship with Columbia Records, the subject of a
 lot of scrutiny and gossip. First, it was widely perceived that 
Landau's public expression of lack of faith in former Columbia boss 
Walter Yetnikoff helped bring Yetnikoff down. Second, other record 
labels have made little secret of their hunger to sign Springsteen, 
which would be an embarrassment to Columbia. Third, the two new albums<br>
Springsteen released last spring, Human Touch and Lucky Town, did not 
sell in the multi-platinum numbers that were expected. One might think 
that Landau would have doubts about the current Columbia regime led by 
Tommy Mottola and Don Ienner. But Landau says nothing is further from 
the truth. In fact, he brings up the subject in order to dispel it. 
Sure, he says, there was some tension before the albums were delivered. 
Mottola had been waiting for three years—who could blame him if he was 
impatient? And Ienner had come over from Arista; who could blame him if 
he said, hey, if a Bruce Springsteen album is a smash I won't get the 
credit, Yetnikoff will. But, Landau insists, since the albums have not 
done as well as expected, Mottola and Ienner have been incredible. They 
have refused to give up, they have kept working the records, they have 
been wonderful. Landau says he and the Columbia chiefs are closer now 
than they ever were before.<br>
One place Springsteen and Landau do part company a bit is in how much 
each cares about commercial success. Virtually everyone who knows Bruce 
well—even those with hard feelings about other things—says he is 
motivated by devotion to his art; the marketplace does not much interest
 him. Now that Bruce is on the road, playing the music he loves to the 
audience who loves him, Jon has had to twist Bruce's arm to get him to 
agree to do any promotion at all. Tonight Jon is relieved that he just 
finished the exhausting task of convincing Bruce to do an acoustic 
television concert for MTV's "Unplugged." He says that like every such 
decision, it was a huge tug of war. "And now that Bruce has agreed to do
 it he'll spend the next three weeks—two of which are his 
vacation—obsessing over it. It will occupy all his thoughts until it's 
done."<br>
The next afternoon I ask Bruce about it. I find him in his dressing room
 two hours before show time, strumming an acoustic guitar.<br>
"Yeah, I'm gonna take a stab at that," he says. "A lot of the new songs,
 particularly on Lucky Town, are pretty folkbased. It's all stuff I can 
sing by myself or with a band. They work a lot of different ways. I have
 some ideas for some small arrangements that'll push the songs 
themselves out front and give me a chance to present the material in a 
different way.<br>
"At some point I want to do an acoustic tour by myself and play in 
theaters. It's something I've been wanting to do for a long time. When I
 did the Christic Institute benefit I said, 'Oh, I can do this.' I'd 
like to work more steadily now if I can get myself to do it. And Patti's
 got her record coming [in February] and she's going to be working in 
some fashion, so we're trying to figure a way to make it all work out. 
Theoretically I'd like to work more, whether I have a new record out or 
not. Just go out and play. There's so many things I could do that I 
haven't done yet, so many ways of presenting the music that I haven't 
done that I'm anxious to do. I'd like to do something out of this 
particular rhythm I've gotten into. I think that's in the cards. In the 
'90s I want to do a lot of different things. I feel freer to branch 
out."<br>
Springsteen mentions that at the Christic Institute benefit concert in 
1990 he got to sit down and do some songs at the piano, something else 
that vanished when his shows moved from theaters to arenas in the late 
'70s. Although Bruce had spent the '60s playing in local New Jersey rock
 bands, he only got discovered when he went up to Greenwich Village in 
the '70s and played folk clubs.<br>
“It was a funny time, '72, '73," he says. “I used to come down to Max's 
Kansas City and play by myself. Paul Nelson would bring some people 
down. I used to open for Dave Van Ronk, Odetta, all those people were 
still around. David Blue came down one night and as I was walking 
offstage he said, 'Hey man, that was great! Come with me.' We got in a 
cab and went downtown to the Bitter End where I met Jackson Browne. He 
had his first album out. I auditioned forJohn Hammond at the old 
Gaslight. And then late at night the New York Dolls would play at Max's.
 They'd play at 2 a.m. Max's was still really thriving at the time, the 
whole downstairs scene was going on. It was the cusp of those two 
things. I was opening for, like, Biff Rose but there was that whole 
other scene starting to come in."<br>
I ask Springsteen when he realized that he could compete with Dylan, 
with Robbie Robertson—when did you know you could work at that level?<br>
Springsteen answers slowly. “I just thought I was gonna be a guy who was gonna have to…work really hard.”<br>
We both crack up laughing. "I wanted to have my own vision and point of 
view and create a world of characters, which is what the writers I 
admired did. It was a world unto itself, a world you slipped into, and 
yet a world that felt connected to the real world in some very important
 ways. I knew when I was very young I wanted to do that. Dylan's 
writing—that's just what felt exciting. So I took off in that direction.
 Hey, everybody shoots for the top! You don't know where it's gonna lead
 you. I just took it a day at a time. I had a real serious dedication to
 it, but I always felt I'd have to really sweat it out, to work really 
hard at it.<br>
"I think I wrote ambitiously. From the beginning I wrote wildly big with
 the idea of taking the whole thing in and being definitive in some 
fashion. I think the show took on that approach also. I was ambitious. 
He laughs. "I was ambitious. I was shooting for the moon." He adds 
quietly, “And I guess somewhere inside I felt like I could hit it."<br>
Tonight is the last night of the summer tour. Everyone has two weeks off
 before reconvening in L.A. to begin the autumn stretch. It's a 
beautiful September evening. During The River a bright half moon shines 
through an opening in the roof next to the stage. Springsteen pulls out 
all the stops. The show climaxes with an electrifying version of “Light 
of Day," the song Bruce wrote for Paul Schrader's movie about a rock 
band. Springsteen has played “Light of Day" on other tours, but it 
didn't lift off the way it was meant to—it seemed to try too hard to be 
joyous and came off as a sort of weaker "Out in the Street." This tour, 
though, he's brought out what he must have known was inside the song, 
'cause it's the high point of the concert. Springsteen hurls the band 
through “Light of Day” in a wailing frenzy, drives the audience 
completely crazy, and then freezes in place as the music slams to a 
stop. This is not a new trick but Bruce really milks it, standing rigid 
as a statue while flowers, hats, and other objects fly past him (I ask 
later how he avoids flinching when an object comes sailing out of the 
dark and just misses his eye. Bruce: "That would be bad form! "). Then 
he screams and the whole band slams back into action. This may be 
repeated once, twice, even three times during the song, the crowd 
getting wilder each time. Sometimes Bruce fills the silence between 
stops with Dirty Harry's "Are you feelin' lucky, punk?" speech. Usually 
he flicks his eyes from one side of the house to the other, creating 
eruptions of cheering wherever his glance falls. Tonight he falls over 
flat on his back. The singers rush to prop him up by the mike stand and 
after a dramatic, James Brown-like pause Bruce screams and kicks it in 
again. From that point on all bets are off. He doesn't even bother 
leaving the stage between finishing the usual hour of encore numbers and
 pulling out the bonus Working on the Highway." It's midnight as that 
song plays. Outside in the moonlight, Patti Scialfa is doing donuts in 
the parking lot in the promoter's 1960 El Dorado convertible, a 
beautiful machine with tail fins you could shave with. "Working on the<br>
Highway" ends, the crowd explodes, and out the back door comes the running, sweating, laughing, towelling band.<br>
Last show! Last show! Standing in the parking lot they hug and say 
goodbye to each other, to Patti, to Landau, to Barbara Carr. They break 
into small groups and climb into the waiting vans. Inside they give each
 other handslaps and...uh-oh...Where's Bruce? Roadies come running out 
the back door yelling, "He's back onstage! " The musicians whoop and 
pour out of the vans, race up the steps, in the back door, down the 
backstage corridor, through the stage doors, into the wings, across the 
ramps and back onstage as Bruce kicks into "Bobby Jean." By the time he 
starts "Hungry Heart" and climbs up on top of the speaker columns. it's 
clear nobody in this audience is going to work in the morning. As a 
police car leads the speeding vans through the crowds and traffic and 
back toward Chicago, Roy Bittan, the old vet, congratulates the young 
recruits on finishing their first campaign. "We made it, boys! 
Thirty-eight shows! Half the tour! All are exhausted, elated, delighted.
 The cop leading the vans hits his siren and Bobby King says, ''Oops, I 
thought it was the intro to '57 Channels'! I almost started chanting 'No
 justice, no peace!'” Tearing up the highway toward Chicago, Roy talks 
about how strange it was to be told the E Street Band was ending, live 
with that for three tough weeks, and then be invited by Bruce to get 
back together—to collaborate on songwriting and production as well as 
playing! When the E Street Band ended he took it as a sign that it was 
time to give himself fully to producing. He was in L.A., he got 
management—and then Bruce called back. Did he hesitate at all before 
reenlisting? "Are you kidding? Bittan asks. "No! Artistically, Bruce is 
the best. I hope to always work with him. And the fact that we were 
writing together meant our relationship was progressing. That was 
important to me. " As we drive down Michigan Avenue, past the jutting 
castle tower of the Chicago Waterworks, Roy tries to explain to 
undomestic Shane why every building, every house, must have a small pipe
 coming through the roof to accommodate water pressure. Shane stares at 
Roy with polite incomprehension. Roy says, "Think of it as a parametric 
equalizer for your toilet." He is the man they call Professor.<br>
Bruce lands in the hotel bar and raises a glass of champagne to his 
bandmates. I compliment him on the guitar solo he took on "Human Touch,"
 a keening, almost whistling lead quite different from his usual 
playing. Bruce says he's been working on his guitar playing a lot 
lately, and often thinks that if he'd stuck with that—his first 
vocation—instead of switching his concentration to songwriting he might 
have become a really good guitarist.<br>
"In my first band I was hired as the lead guitarist," Bruce says."I 
couldn't play much lead but I could play a little more than everybody 
else. Like any at a/l! There was a time when the general playing ability
 in the local bands was really rudimentary. And it seems like everybody 
learned a lot slower. I think these days kids pick up a guitar and in a 
year or two they've got the Eddie Van Halen licks goin'!"<br>
I tell Bruce we shouldn't have this discussion in the bar. Let's go up 
and get the tape recorder out. Bruce Springsteen is a cautious man. He 
wants to work this out. It's quarter to two. Bruce wants to go get a 
massage, which he reckons will take until quarter of three. Then he 
wants to get some dinner. He asks if it would be okay if he came by my 
room to tape some more interview at 4 a.m. Sure, I say, great, see you 
then. At 4:15 Bruce calls and says, let's wait till morning. Fine, I 
say. I close my eyes and it seems like about two seconds later I hear 
"shave and a haircut" knocking on my door. I open it and there's Bruce. 
He comes in, sits down and starts talking. An hour, two hours, three 
hours. The phone rings, he's going to miss his ride to the airport. 
Bruce doesn't stop.<br>
"I didn't sing in the Castiles, my first band," he says. I basically 
played the guitar. Everybody in the band felt that I couldn't sing at 
all. I think I got to sing one Dylan song. Over the years I started to 
sing a little bit more, eventually I think we ended up splitting a lot 
of the vocals. And after that I went off and had my own bands.<br>
"I put together a real Hendrix/Cream three-piece group called Earth for 
quite a while. That was the Day of the Guitarist. Alvin Lee and Jeff 
Beck and Clapton and Hendrix. And locally I was the guitarist, I was the
 fast gun at the time.<br>
“When I got my record deal I was in a place where I'd said, 'Gee, 
there's a lot of guys who play really well. There's not a lot of guys 
who rite that well.' I think I'd decided that if I was going to create 
my own point of view, my own vision, it wasn't going to be 
instrumentally—it was going to be more through songwriting. So I put a 
lot of my energy into that. I had no band for a while, I just wrote a 
group of songs that felt unique to me, and that was when I went up and 
met [Columbia's] John Hammond—that was the stuff I played for him.<br>
"Then I was typecast as an acoustic act for a while. Locally I took a 
tremendous amount of heat. When the first record came out people were 
incensed that there was no electric guitar on it! It was like I screwed 
up. All I heard everyplace I went was 'Where's the guitar, man? What 
happened?' I had such a big local reputation in the Jersey area—and a 
little bit down south, 'cause we'd play in Vlrginia and Carolina—as a 
hard-rockin' guitar band that when the first record came out people were
 sort of, 'What happened?'<br>
"But I felt like I knew what I was doing, I stuck with it, I put the 
band together after that record. I became more arrangement-orientated, i
 got more interested in how the thing was going to function as an 
ensemble. If there needed to be a solo I tended to give it to Clarence. 
I'd like to play a little bit more now, but I still relegate it to the 
song. I always felt the song was my fundamental means of<br>
communication. It would be nice to do something that was out of that 
context, something that was less immediately song-oriented. More 
texture-oriented or abstract or something.”<br>
When you were playing in Earth, were you playing like Alvin Lee and Hendrix?<br>
"Oh yeah."<br>
Did you have better chops in 1969 than you had in, say, 1975?<br>
"Because I played so much more, I probably had a wider range of things 
that I played. Right now I'm playing pretty well in a sort of limited 
vein. It's the old story, you gotta play a lot. I have sort of an area 
that I'm playing in. There was a lot of fast guitar playing at the time 
because that's what was going on. Eventually I moved away from that 
idea. I got more into what B.B. King was doing, I liked the idea of less
 notes. Yeah, I probably had a little more flexibility - or dexterity at
 the time. But it doesn't really leave you that much, it doesn't go that
 far away. Generally I haven't created a context where I allow myself 
the freedom to stretch out and play and investigate ideas more 
instrumentally. But maybe I'll get to it.”<br>
You do have a very distinct, emphatic guitar style which you use to 
convey strength, anxiety, joy—but you very rarely use guitar to convey 
tenderness or melancholy. You tend to go to harmonica for that.<br>
"Yeah. I played a little bit on 'If I Should Fall Behind' and in the 
early days I had 'Sandy.' A little bit, not that much. I was probably 
more confident of my voice in my songs than I was in developing a 
distinct voice on the guitar. And when you're leading the band, singing,
 and writing the songs eventually you've got to make some choices. I 
choose to go away from a long, jamming sort of style, even though I did 
it for a long time when I was younger. As I got older I wanted to be 
more direct, clear, immediate and not waste a lot of time."<br>
The talk turns to his new work. On "Real World," a central song on Human
 Touch, Springsteen sings, "I still got a little faith but what I need 
is some proof.n On Lucky Town the birth of his son brings him "Living 
Proof."<br>
"Yeah,” Bruce smiles, "that's what people do for each other. My 
relationship with Patti—she just somehow managed to bring to me a lot of
 self-acceptance. Just the way she looked at me or the way she was with 
me. People can come in and help center you and pull out the best of you 
and tell you when you should cut yourself some slack and when you ought 
to be working a little harder. That's what we do for each other when 
it's working right. Kids do it too. Kids make you rise above yourself."<br>
Some successful musicians discover that when they find the secure love of a family, they no longer need the love of an audience.<br>
"There's people who feel the other way, too. There's people who feel, 'I
 get what I need when I go onstage and I don't need the rest.' I felt 
like that for a long time. I always got to a point in relationships 
where if it got too complicated or there was too much pressure, whether 
it was right or not I'd say, 'Hey, I don't need this!' That's the 
classic line. I don't need this. The only thing I've been able to figure
 is, that's never true. You do need it.<br>
"But I figure it can work the other way, too. The connection with your 
audience is something you want and you need. I guess I feel that's how I
 impact upon the world. I didn't see any reason why both of those things
 couldn't nurture each other. That was the idea anyway. And the tour is 
when you experience it the most. Both things are happening: My family's 
here and the audience is out there. It's a balancing act. Some days you 
do it poorly and some days you do it really well.<br>
"But I can understand that feeling. Because I think if you develop a 
real happy family thing you're always tempted to take refuge in it. 
Which is part of why it's there. Just like you can take refuge in your 
work. That's partly why it's there. But if you hide in either one of 
those things, maybe you're cutting off a part of yourself.<br>
''The idea is that you and the audience learn together. You ferret out 
your own illusions. That's what my work is about—people stumbling across
 their own illusions, letting them drop to the wayside, then trying to 
move on a little further, finding something that's real. And then you 
bump into your deeper illusions." Bruce laughs. You try to let some of 
them slip. And through it all you try not to get lost in the distortion 
of fame or success, or the different things that the job brings along 
with it." Bruce looks up and smiles and says, 'It's a trip."<br>
It's hard for anyone who's not famous to talk about what being famous 
does to you, but it sure does seem that Springsteen's been working to 
dismantle his superstardom ever since the Tunnel of Love album and tour.<br>
"I feel less famous at the moment!" Bruce says and he lets out a big 
laugh."And it's good. The zeitgeist is...All I know is, I feel able to 
get on with my own life, it's just a little easier. Things are really 
good right now. I don't know what my intentions were. Your intentions 
are always complicated. On one hand, it's fun to have a big smash and 
you want your music to be powerful and to reach as many people as 
possible. But there's all sorts of different issues, and none of them 
are clear. A big audience may not be your best audience. I don't know. 
How you feel about it can vary any given night. The main thing I was 
concerned with was taking the whole thing down, making it feel more 
human-scaled, less iconic and more about everyday issues, which I 
thought the Tunnel of Love record and my new records dealt with. That's 
basically what I did.<br>
"Outside of that, your control over the thing has a life and dynamic of 
its own. You have some control over it. But I don't try to exert that 
much. I thought Born in the USA would be a popular record; I didn't 
think it would be the thing it ended up being. That's just what 
happened. I thought Tunnel of Love or these records would be more 
popular, but that's what happened there. Hey, you ride along with it."<br>
So fame's not so bad?<br>
“While there's a lot of stress and tension involved, a good part of me 
enjoyed the whole thing. Except for '75—I was kinda young and pressed at
 the time. But hey, I could have not been on those covers of Time and 
Newsweek if I didn't want to! I didn't have to do those interviews. I 
remember sitting in a room saying, 'Gee, do I want to do this? It seems 
scary.' 'Yeah, but I don't want to to be sitting on my porch when I'm 60
 saying, Oh, I shoulda, I coulda, I woulda!' Hey! You got one ride. So I
 said, Let's go! " <br>
Like giving up your freedom to get married—every time you give up one thing you gain something else.<br>
"Yeah. I think that I was real protective over my music. Probably too 
much so. The stuff isn't so fragile or precious. But that's how I felt. 
Maybe I was trying to protect myself at times. The world is threatening.
 You can feel that big breath on the back of your neck right before you 
step into those particular decisions. You go, 'Hmm, I think the heat's 
gonna get turned up here.' And it does. Part of it can make you 
miserable, but part of you also may just ride with it and go Woooo! 
You're flying by the seat of your pants. So it's sort of both those 
things. It's been a good ride, you know.<br>
"Like you say, you tend to not have an idea what you're going to get, 
even in painful experience. Some of the best things I learned were 
learned from getting beat up, making mistakes. And if you're afraid to 
do that, to step out and fall, that's living in fear. If you can't take 
the pain you're not going to get to that higher place. My fear of 
failure always held me back in dealing with people and relationships. I 
always stopped right before I committed to the place where if it failed 
it would really hurt. 'I'm okay up to here but there, no.' It wasn't 
until I stepped out into that other place that I realized what the 
stakes were, what the rewards were, the pleasures. The past eight years 
have been a tremendous time of learning for me. One of the best times of
 my life. Really difficult but definitely..." Bruce stops and thinks 
about it. "To be sitting here with the kids, Patti, my music—it's a nice
 seat."<br>
Bruce's new albums are full of songs about being set free by having your
 lies exposed— as opposed to Tunnel of Love, where songs like "Two Faces
 and "Brilliant Disguise talked about how hard it is to live with 
getting away with lies.<br>
"Everybody lives with their illusions," Bruce says, drumming his fingers
 on a water glass. "Nobody's who they think they are. Not completely. 
There's a limit to how much you can know yourself. Or all the little 
things we do on a daily basis to live with ourselves. I guess what I've 
found satisfying is that if you try to strip away as much of this stuff 
as you can and find out what you're about— whether it's pretty or ugly 
or what—you do find some sort of freedom. But no matter how much you're 
doing it you feel you're still being cowardly with it. You can always 
push harder. But I think just singing the song is an act of 
self-awareness. Those people in the songs, they know. Whether they do 
something about it, the characters are copping to it. They're saying, 
'This is how I see it, this is what I'm doing.' That's always the first 
step. But it's tough."<br>
Listen to some of the lines on the new albums: "A little sweet talk to 
cover all the lies," "Chippin' away at this chain of my own lies," "I 
had some victory that was just failure in deceit," “You get paid and 
your silence passes as honor and all the hatred and dirty little lies 
are written off the books…"<br>
"Everybody lies in some fashion or another," Bruce says. "Big ones, 
little ones. Really, if I was trying to capture anything on those 
records. it was a sense of a less morally certain universe. Perhaps in 
some of my earlier music—though those ideas are in 'Prove It All 
Night'—people may have felt a greater degree of moral certainty. I think
 it might have been one of the things that attracted people to my music.
 That's obviously not the way the real world is. I guess on these 
records I was interested in trying to paint it as I saw it. Wlth your 
own weaknesses and the places where you fail and get caught up in the 
Big Muddy. I was interested in taking a less heroic stance. I think 
that, despite my protestations over the years in some of my Iyrics, 
there was a heroic posture to a lot of the music I created. You try to 
do the right thing, and as you get older you realize how hard it is to 
do the right thing.<br>
"When you isolate yourself off in the world of music it allows you a 
flexibility and control that the real world just doesn't allow. If you 
step outside that and begin to engage with people, it's gonna get messy.
 Painting the mess was part of what I wanted to do on those records. 
Because that's the way it really is. But that can also be less appealing
 or less compelling for some people. That moral certainty is attractive 
in a world that's so fundamentally confusing. That's why fairy tales are
 popular. That's why so many action movies are big. The first thing 
people want to know when they hear about any conflict is, 'Who's the 
good guy? Who's the bad guy?' Tabloid entertainment, TV news all comes 
down to 'Who's the good guy? Who's the bad guy?' It's rarely as simple 
as that. Particularly in 'The Big Muddy,' that's what I was tryin' to 
get to: Your moral certainty is a luxury. What passes for 'family 
values' or gets twisted under the umbrella of 'family values' is a 
luxury for a lot of people. It's something that a lot of people can't 
afford. 'The Big Muddy' wrestles with that. It's not here, it's not 
there, it's somewhere in the middle and you're down in it."<br>
As Bruce and I are talking, President Bush's latest surge in the polls 
has collapsed and Bill Clinton is pulling away. Maybe with so many 
Americans financially strapped, the Family Values crusade of the G.O.P. 
is ringing the national bullshit meter.<br>
"And they know that's what it is!" Bruce nods. "First of all, Bush just 
isn't as good, he can't present it like Reagan presented it. Plus, 
hey—we heard that last time! And that sounds like bullshit. People are 
really saying,<br>
'Hey—that's BULLSHIT. It's too real out here!' That's not gonna work. I 
really don't think it's gonna work." Springsteen sighs. "Most of popular
 culture is based on childhood fairy tales. It just continues. That's 
what a lot of political discourse became. There's a real patronizing 
aspect to the whole thing. I just think people at this point have become
 fundamentally skeptical and cynical—in a good way. The answers are 
complex. Even though some part inside of us yearns for a morally certain
 world, that world doesn't exist. That's not the real world. And at some
 point you've got to make that realization, make your choices, and do 
the best that you can."</div>

 November 15, 2010<br>
<br>
In 1975, the album Born to Run catapulted Bruce Springsteen from a regional critical favorite to a worldwide megastar.<br>
<br>
But after Born to Run's release, a legal battle with his former manager,
 Mike Appel, kept Springsteen from making a follow-up album for nearly 
two years. Springsteen spent his time touring extensively across the 
U.S. with the E Street Band. When he returned to the studio, in 1977, he
 brought with him dozens of songs that he had written during his exile.<br>
<br>
Those studio sessions produced Springsteen's fourth album, 1978's 
Darkness on the Edge of Town. It was musically very different from Born 
to Run — and drew thematically from the punk-rock movement, the Vietnam 
War and Springsteen's own reflections about wanting to stay connected to
 his roots.<br>
<br>
But many of the songs Springsteen wrote for that album were never released.<br>
<br>
"Darkness on the Edge of Town came out of a huge body of work that had 
tons of very happy songs," Springsteen told actor Ed Norton at the 
Toronto International Film Festival in September. "It was all music that
 we recorded, we wrote and made a very distinct decision to not use."<br>
<br>
Twenty-one songs Springsteen originally recorded for Darkness on the 
Edge of Town are now being released for the first time as part of a 
collection called The Promise. Here, we feature some of Springsteen's 
conversation with Norton at the Toronto International Film Festival, 
where the two men talked about the making of Darkness, as well as a new 
documentary about the album, titled The Promise: The Making of 'Darkness
 on the Edge of Town.'<br>
<br>
Many of the songs cut from Darkness on the Edge of Town are being 
released in the box set The Promise, which comes out tomorrow.  The box 
set also includes a remastered version of Darkness, 2 CDs of songs that 
were recorded but not used for the album, along with the documentary, 
The Promise, and DVDs of other live performances.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">On Darkness In Music</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
"Some of the greatest blues music is some of the darkest music you've 
ever heard. And I had maps. Obviously, Dylan had come when I was 15, and
 obviously I listened to his music first, and his music contained a lot —
 I used to say when I heard 'Highway 61,' I was hearing the first true 
picture of how I felt and how my country felt. And that was 
exhilarating. Because I think 1960s small-town America was very 
Lynchian. Everything was there, but underneath, everything was rumbling.
 ... I think what Dylan did, was he took all that dark stuff that was 
rumbling underneath, and I think he pushed it to the surface with irony 
and humor, but also tremendous courage to go places where people hadn't 
gone previously. So when I heard that, I knew I liked that, and I was 
very ambitious, also.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">On The Timing Of Darkness’ Release</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
"I think Darkness came out of a place where I was afraid of losing 
myself. I had the first taste of success [with Born to Run], so you 
realize it's possible for your talent to be co-opted and for your 
identity to be moved and shifted in ways that you may not have been 
prepared for. I was the only person I'd ever met who had a record 
contract. None of the E Street Band, as far as I know, had been on an 
airplane until Columbia sent us to Los Angeles. ... It was a smaller, 
smaller world. And we were provincial guys with no money. So there was 
this whole little street life in Asbury Park, and New York was a million
 miles away. Localism, as a movement, hadn't occurred yet in music. So 
there was nobody saying, 'I need to see what those bands in New Jersey 
are doing.' It was a very different time. But the good part about it was
 you were very, very connected to place and you had a real sense of 
place. And it was unique, the place where you lived and where you grew 
up."<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">On Where The Tracks On Darkness Originated</strong><br>
<br>
"No one knows anyone else who has any money. They only know you. And at 
the time, even though we're making a lot of records, we're not making 
much money, because we didn't know how to make records, or because I 
signed a lot of bad deals and it all went away. My desire to not get 
disconnected from my parents and their history and a lot of the people I
 cared about; I said, 'These things aren't being written about that 
much. I'm not sure. And those were the topics I decided to take on for 
that particular record, not so much out of any social consciousness, but
 as a way of survival of my own inner life and soul."<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">On Musical Influences<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
"I don't know if I know anyone, with the exception of the early 
inventors of rock music [who wasn't influenced by something]. And even 
then, the kind of study that had to go on — like the gospel background 
in Jerry Lee Lewis' piano playing, and it's completely informed with 
church and honky-tonk — and you have to study that stuff. I don't mean 
study in the sense of literal schooling, but you're drawn to things that
 make you seek out what they're about. That's studying. And whether 
you're drawn to gospel music or church music or honky-tonk music, it 
informs your character and it informs your talent."<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">On Great New Music</strong><br>
<br>
"If you're good, you're always looking over your shoulder. I mean, 
that's the life — that's the gun-slinging life. It's like, 'Yes, you are
 very fast, my friend, but there's some kid in his garage tonight, and 
just about 10 minutes from now...' You can't make any mistake about it. 
The record and documentary show that [that album] was carved 
meticulously and consciously out of a big chunk of stone over a long 
period of time, with a huge amount of ego and ambition and hunger, 
hopefully for the right things."</div>

<br>
<br>
In early 1989, Walker Percy penned a fan letter "of sorts" to Bruce 
Springsteen, praising the musician's "spiritual journey" and hoping to 
begin a correspondence between them. At the time, Springsteen hesitated 
in responding, but he later picked up a copy of The Moviegoer and began a
 new journey into Dr. Percy's writing. Walker Percy died in May 1990, 
and the two never met, but Percy's novels and essays, among other books 
and films, have had a most profound impact on Springsteen's songwriting.
	 <br>
 <br>
In 1995, Springsteen recorded The Ghost of Tom Joad, a richly lyrical 
album that forged a new purpose for his music, linking him in some ways 
to the tradition of such artist-activists as John Steinbeck (Joad is the
 radical hero of The Grapes of Wrath) and folk music icon Woody Guthrie.
 Springsteen's songs tell us, in their familiar narrative style, about 
ordinary people struggling through life's twists and turns, presenting a
 cast of characters that includes immigrant families, border patrolmen, 
midwestern steelworkers, and America's poor and disenfranchised. The 
populist sensibility of Guthrie can be heard throughout: it is music 
competing for the public conscience.<br>
 <br>
Following an Atlanta concert promoting the album, Will Percy, Walker's 
nephew, met Springsteen backstage, and the two talked for hours. When 
Springsteen mentioned his regret at never having written back to Will's 
uncle, Will encouraged him to write to his aunt, Walker's widow. A few 
months later, Springsteen, who likes to say that "it's hard for me to 
write unless there's music underneath," sat down and wrote four pages-a 
letter years in the making.<br>
<br>
Last fall, Will Percy and Springsteen had the chance to meet again, this
 time on the Springsteen farm in central New Jersey, not far from the 
small town where Springsteen grew up or from the Jersey Shore clubs 
where he first made his mark in the 1970s. With a tape running, the two 
explored the importance of books in Springsteen's life, most recently 
his discovery of Dr. Percy's essays in The Message in the Bottle. Like 
the long-in-coming letter to Mrs. Percy, perhaps this is part of the 
conversation that Bruce Springsteen might have had with Walker Percy.<br>
 <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"> <br>
Will Percy: When did books start influencing your songwriting and music?
 I remember as early as 1978, when I saw you in concert, you mentioned 
Ron Kovic's Born on the Fourth of July, and you dedicated a song to him.</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen:</strong> I picked up that
 book in a drugstore in Arizona while I was driving across the country 
with a friend of mine. We stopped somewhere outside of Phoenix, and 
there was a copy of the paperback in the rack. So I bought the book and I
 read it between Phoenix and Los Angeles, where I stayed in this little 
motel. There was a guy in a wheelchair by the poolside every day, two or
 three days in a row, and I guess he recognized me, and he Þnally came 
up to me and said, "Hey, I'm Ron Kovic"-it was really very strange-and I
 said, "Oh, Ron Kovic, gee, that's good." I thought I'd met him before 
somewhere. And he said, "No, I wrote a book called Born on the Fourth of
 July." And I said, "You wouldn't believe this. I just bought your book 
in a drugstore in Arizona and I just read it. It's incredible." Real, 
real powerful book. And we talked a little bit and he got me interested 
in doing something for the vets. He took me to a vet center in Venice, 
and I met a bunch of guys along with this guy Bobby Muller who was one 
of the guys who started VVA, Vietnam Veterans of America.<br>
I go through periods where I read, and I get a lot out of what I read, 
and that reading has affected my work since the late seventies. Films 
and novels and books, more so than music, are what have really been 
driving me since then. Your uncle once wrote that "American novels are 
about everything," and I was interested in writing about "everything" in
 some fashion in my music: how it felt to be alive now, a citizen of 
this country in this particular place and time and what that meant, and 
what your possibilities were if you were born and alive now, what you 
could do, what you were capable of doing. Those were ideas that 
interested me.<br>
The really important reading that I did began in my late twenties, with 
authors like Flannery O'Connor. There was something in those stories of 
hers that I felt captured a certain part of the American character that I
 was interested in writing about. They were a big, big revelation. She 
got to the heart of some part of meanness that she never spelled out, 
because if she spelled it out you wouldn't be getting it. It was always 
at the core of every one of her stories-the way that she'd left that 
hole there, that hole that's inside of everybody. There was some dark 
thing-a component of spirituality-that I sensed in her stories, and that
 set me off exploring characters of my own. She knew original sin-knew 
how to give it the þesh of a story. She had talent and she had ideas, 
and the one served the other.<br>
I think I'd come out of a period of my own writing where I'd been 
writing big, sometimes operatic, and occasionally rhetorical things. I 
was interested in Þnding another way to write about those subjects, 
about people, another way to address what was going on around me and in 
the country-a more scaled-down, more personal, more restrained way of 
getting some of my ideas across. So right prior to the record Nebraska 
[1982], I was deep into O'Connor. And then, later on, that led me to 
your uncle's books, and Bobbie Ann Mason's novels-I like her work.<br>
I've also gotten a lot out of Robert Frank's photography in The 
Americans. I was twenty-four when I Þrst saw the book-I think a friend 
had given me a copy-and the tone of the pictures, how he gave us a look 
at different kinds of people, got to me in some way. I've always wished I
 could write songs the way he takes pictures. I think I've got half a 
dozen copies of that book stashed around the house, and I pull one out 
once in a while to get a fresh look at the photographs.<br>
WP: I find it interesting that you're inþuenced a lot by movies -you 
said you're more influenced by movies and books than music. In the liner
 notes of The Ghost of Tom Joad you credited both the John Ford Þlm and 
the book The Grapes of Wrath by Steinbeck.<br>
: I came by the film before I really came by the book. I'd read the book
 in high school, along with Of Mice and Men and a few others, and then I
 read it again after I saw the movie. But I didn't grow up in a 
community of ideas-a place where you can sit down and talk about books, 
and how you read through them, and how they affect you. For a year, I 
went to a local college a few miles up the road from here, but I didn't 
really get much out of that particular place. I think I'm more a product
 of pop culture: films and records, films and records, Þlms and records,
 especially early on. And then later, more novels and reading.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">WP:Where did you draw your musical influences in your earlier writing as compared with this last album?</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">BS-</strong>  Up until the late seventies, 
when I started to write songs that had to do with class issues, I was 
inþuenced more by music like the Animals' "We Gotta Get Out of This 
Place" or "It's My Life (And I'll Do What I Want)"-sort of 
class-conscious pop records that I'd listen to-and I'd say to myself: 
"That's my life, that's my life!" They said something to me about my own
 experience of exclusion. I think that's been a theme that's run through
 much of my writing: the politics of exclusion. My characters aren't 
really antiheroes. Maybe that makes them old-fashioned in some way. 
They're interested in being included, and they're trying to Þgure out 
what's in their way.<br>
I'd been really involved with country music right prior to the album 
Darkness on the Edge of Town [1978], and that had a lot of affect on my 
writing because I think country is a very class-conscious music. And 
then that interest slowly led me into Woody Guthrie and folk music. 
Guthrie was one of the few songwriters at the time who was aware of the 
political implications of the music he was writing-a real part of his 
consciousness. He set out intentionally to address a wide variety of 
issues, to have some effect, to have some impact, to be writing as a way
 to have some impact on things: playing his part in the way things are 
moving and things change.<br>
I was always trying to shoot for the moon. I had some lofty ideas about 
using my own music, to give people something to think about-to think 
about the world, and what's right and wrong. I'd been affected that way 
by records, and I wanted my own music and writing to extend themselves 
in that way.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">WP: I notice that you talk about "writing" and not "songwriting." Do you sit down and write lyrics and then look for music?</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">BS :</strong> When I'd write rock music, 
music with the whole band, it would sometimes start out purely 
musically, and then I'd find my way to some lyrics. I haven't written 
like that in a while. In much of my recent writing, the lyrics have 
preceded the music, though the music is always in the back of my mind. 
In most of the recent songs, I tell violent stories very quietly. You're
 hearing characters' thoughts-what they're thinking after all the events
 that have shaped their situation have transpired. So I try to get that 
internal sound, like that feeling at night when you're in bed and 
staring at the ceiling, reþective in some fashion. I wanted the songs to
 have the kind of intimacy that took you inside yourself and then back 
out into the world.<br>
I'll use music as a way of defining and coloring the characters, 
conveying the characters' rhythm of speech and pace. The music acts as a
 very still surface, and the lyrics create a violent emotional life over
 it, or under it, and I let those elements bang up against each other.<br>
Music can seem incidental, but it ends up being very important. It 
allows you to suggest the passage of time in just a couple of quiet 
beats. Years can go by in a few bars, whereas a writer will have to come
 up with a clever way of saying, "And then years went by. . . ." Thank 
God I don't have to do any of that! Songwriting allows you to cheat 
tremendously. You can present an entire life in a few minutes. And then 
hopefully, at the end, you reveal something about yourself and your 
audience and the person in the song. It has a little in common with 
short-story writing in that it's character-<br>
driven. The characters are confronting the questions that everyone is 
trying to sort out for themselves, their moral issues, the way those 
issues rear their heads in the outside world.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">WP: While your previous albums might all 
come from personal experience-from the people and places you grew up 
with in New Jersey and elsewhere-you seem to have started writing more 
about other people and topics now, Mexican immigrants, for instance, in 
songs like "Sinaloa Cowboys." With that song, I remember you said in 
concert that it started out when you met a couple of Mexican brothers in
 the desert once when you were traveling</strong>.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">BS -</strong> There's no single place where 
any of the songs come from, of course. True, I drew a lot of my earlier 
material from my experience growing up, my father's experience, the 
experience of my immediate family and town. But there was a point in the
 mid-eighties when I felt like I'd said pretty much all I knew how to 
say about all that. I couldn't continue writing about those same things 
without either becoming a stereotype of myself or by twisting those 
themes around too much. So I spent the next ten years or so writing 
about men and women-their intimate personal lives. I was being 
introspective but not autobiographical. It wasn't until I felt like I 
had a stable life in that area that I was driven to write more 
outwardly-about social issues.<br>
A song like "Sinaloa Cowboys" came from a lot of places. I'd met a guy 
in the Arizona desert when I happened to be on a trip with some friends 
of mine, and he had a younger brother who died in a motorcycle accident.
 There's something about conversations with people-people you've met 
once and you'll never see again-that always stays with me. And I lived 
for quite a while in Los Angeles, and border reporting and immigration 
issues are always in the paper there. I've traveled down to the border a
 number of times.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">WP: Why would you travel down to the border?</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">BS </strong>: With my dad, I'd take trips to
 Mexico a few years back. We'd take these extended road trips where we'd
 basically drive aimlessly. The border wasn't something I was 
consciously thinking about, it was just one of those places that all of a
 sudden starts meaning something to you. I'm always looking for ways to 
tell a particular story, and I just felt the connection, I can't explain
 what it was exactly-a connection to some of the things I'd written 
about in the past.<br>
I don't think you sit down and write anything that isn't personal in 
some way. In the end, all your work is a result of your own psychology 
and experience. I never really write with a particular ideology in mind.
 As a writer, you're searching for ways to present different moral 
questions-to yourself because you're not sure how you will respond, and 
to your audience. That's what you get paid for-from what I can tell. 
Part of what we call entertainment should be "food for thought." That's 
what I was interested in doing since I was very young, how we live in 
the world and how we ought live in the world. I think politics are 
implicit. I'm not interested in writing rhetoric or ideology. I think it
 was Walt Whitman who said, "The poet's job is to know the soul." You 
strive for that, assist your audience in finding and knowing theirs. 
That's always at the core of what you're writing, of what drives your 
music.<br>
It's all really in your uncle's essay "The Man on the Train," about the 
"wandering spirit" and modern man-all that's happened since the 
Industrial Revolution when people were uprooted and set out on the road 
into towns where they'd never been before, leaving families, leaving 
traditions that were hundreds of years old. In a funny way, you can even
 trace that story in Chuck Berry's "Johnny B. Goode." I think that we're
 all trying to find what passes for a home, or creating a home of some 
sort, while we're constantly being uprooted by technology, by factories 
being shut down.<br>
I remember when my parents moved out to California-I was about eighteen.
 My folks decided that they were going to leave New Jersey, but they had
 no idea really where to go. I had a girlfriend at the time and she was 
sort of a hippie. She was the only person we knew who'd ever been to 
California. She'd been to Sausalito and suggested they go there. You can
 just imagine-Sausalito in the late sixties! So they went to Sausalito, 
three thousand miles across the country, and they probably had only 
three grand that they'd saved and that had to get them a place to live, 
and they had to go out and Þnd work. So they got to Sausalito and 
realized this wasn't it. My mother said they went to a gas station and 
she asked the guy there, "Where do people like us live?"-that's a 
question that sounds like the title of a Raymond Carver story!-and the 
guy told her, "Oh, you live on the peninsula." And that was what they 
did. They drove down south of San Francisco and they've been there ever 
since. My father was forty-two at the time-it's funny to think that he 
was probably seven or eight years younger than I am now. It was a big 
trip, took a lot of nerve, a lot of courage, having grown up in my 
little town in New Jersey.<br>
But that story leads back to those same questions: how do you create the
 kind of home you want to live in, how do you create the kind of society
 you want to live in, what part do you play in doing that? To me, those 
things are all connected, but those connections are hard to make. The 
pace of the modern world, industrialization, postindustrialization, have
 all made human connection very difficult to maintain and sustain. To 
bring that modern situation alive-how we live now, our hang-ups and 
choices-that's what music and film and art are about-that's the service 
you're providing, that's the function you're providing as an artist. 
That's what keeps me interested in writing.<br>
What we call "art" has to do with social policy-and it has to do with 
how you and your wife or you and your lover are getting along on any 
given day. I was interested in my music covering all those bases. And 
how do I do that? I do that by telling stories, through characters' 
voices-hopefully stories about inclusion. The stories in The Ghost of 
Tom Joad were an extension of those ideas: stories about brothers, 
lovers, movement, exclusion-political exclusion, social exclusion-and 
also the responsibility of these individuals-making bad choices, or 
choices they've been backed up against the wall to make.<br>
The way all those things intersect is what interests me. The way the 
social issues and the personal issues cross over one another. To me, 
that's how people live. These things cross over our lives daily. People 
get tangled up in them, don't know how to address them, get lost in 
them. My work is a map, for whatever it's worth-for both my audience and
 for myself-and it's the only thing of value along with, hopefully, a 
well-lived life that we leave to the people we care about. I was lucky 
that I stumbled onto this opportunity early in my life. I think that the
 only thing that was uncommon was that I found a language that I was 
able to express those ideas with. Other people all the time struggle to 
find the language, or don't find the language-the language of the 
soul-or explode into violence or indifference or numbness, just numbed 
out in front of TV. "The Language"-that's what William Carlos Williams 
kept saying, the language of live people, not dead people!<br>
If I'm overgeneralizing, just stop me. I'm not sure if I am or not, but 
in some fashion that's my intent, to establish a commonality by 
revealing our inner common humanity, by telling good stories about a lot
 of different kinds of people. The songs on the last album connected me 
up with my past, with what I'd written about in my past, and they also 
connected me up with what I felt was the future of my writing.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">WP: Do you think your last album, which 
wasn't a pop or rock-and-roll record, had the same impact on the larger 
public that other records of yours had?</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">BS :</strong> I've made records that I knew 
would Þnd a smaller audience than others that I've made. I suppose the 
larger question is, How do you get that type of work to be heard-despite
 the noise of modern society and the media, two hundred television 
channels? Today, people are swamped with a lot of junk, so the outlets 
and the avenues for any halfway introspective work tend to be 
marginalized. The last record might have been heard occasionally on the 
radio, but not very much. It's a paradox for an artist-if you go into 
your work with the idea of having some effect upon society, when, by the
 choice of the particular media, it's marginalized from the beginning. I
 don't know of any answer, except the hope that somehow you do get 
heard-and there are some publishing houses and television channels and 
music channels that are interested in presenting that kind of work.<br>
I think you have to feel like there's a lot of different ways to reach 
people, help them think about what's really important in this 
one-and-only life we live. There's pop culture-that's the shotgun 
approach, where you throw it out and it gets interpreted in different 
ways and some people pick up on it. And then there's a more intimate, 
focused approach like I tried on Tom Joad. I got a lot of correspondence
 about the last album from a lot of different people-writers, teachers, 
those who have an impact in shaping other people's lives.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">WP: Do you think pop culture can still have a positive effect</strong>?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">BS :</strong> Well, it's a funny thing. When
 punk rock music hit in the late 1970s, it wasn't played on the radio, 
and nobody thought, Oh yeah, that'll be popular in 1992 for two 
generations of kids. But the music dug in, and now it has a tremendous 
impact on the music and culture of the nineties. It was powerful, 
profound, music and it was going to find a way to make itself heard 
eventually. So I think there's a lot of different ways of achieving the 
kind of impact that most writers and filmmakers, photographers, 
musicians want their work to have. It's not always something that 
happens right away-the "Big Bang"!<br>
With the exception of certain moments in the history of popular culture,
 it's difficult to tell what has an impact anymore, and particularly now
 when there's so many alternatives. Now, we have the fifth Batman movie!
 I think about the part in the essay "The Man on the Train" where your 
uncle talks about alienation. He says the truly alienated man isn't the 
guy who's despairing and trying to find his place in the world. It's the
 guy who just finished his twentieth Erle Stanley Gardner Perry Mason 
novel. That is the lonely man! That is the alienated man! So you could 
say, similarly, the guy who just saw the fifth Batman picture, he's the 
alienated man. But as much as anyone, I still like to go out on a 
Saturday night and buy the popcorn and watch things explode, but when 
that becomes such a major part of the choices that you have, when you 
have sixteen cinemas and fourteen of them are playing almost exactly the
 same picture, you feel that something's going wrong here. And if you 
live outside a major metropolitan area, maybe you're lucky if there's a 
theater in town that's playing films that fall slightly outside of those
 choices.<br>
There's an illusion of choice that's out there, but it's an illusion, 
it's not real choice. I think that's true in the political arena and in 
pop culture, and I guess there's a certain condescension and cynicism 
that goes along with it-the assumption that people aren't ready for 
something new and different.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">WP: Do you think that the culture of 
celebrity is a cause of some of those problems? You seem to have escaped
 some of the problems that go along with being a celebrity.</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">BS :</strong> I don't know, it's the old 
story-a lot of it is how you play your role. My music was in some sense 
inclusive and pretty personal, maybe even friendly. I've enjoyed the 
trappings from time to time, but I think I like a certain type of 
freedom. Of course, I enjoy my work being recognized, and when you get 
up on stage in front of twenty thousand people and you shake your butt 
all around, you're asking for some sort of trouble. I hope I've kept my 
balance. I enjoy my privacy.<br>
I don't think the fascination with celebrities will ever really go away.
 An intellectual would say that people in the Industrial Age left their 
farms and their towns, so they couldn't gossip with their neighbors over
 the fence anymore-and all of a sudden there was a rise of a celebrity 
culture so we could have some people in common that we could talk about.<br>
The substantive moral concern might be that we live in a country where 
the only story might be who's succeeding and who's number one, and what 
are you doing with it. It sure does become a problem if a certain part 
of your life as a writer-your "celebrity," or whatever you want to call 
it-can blur and obscure the story that you're interested in telling. 
I've felt that and seen that at certain times. One of the most common 
questions I was asked on the last tour, even by very intelligent 
reviewers was, "Why are you writing these songs? What are you 
complaining about? You've done great." That's where your uncle's essay 
"Notes on a Novel about the End of the World" was very helpful to me and
 my writing. Your uncle addresses the story behind those same comments: 
"The material is so depressing. The songs are so down." He explains the 
moral and human purpose of writing by using that analogy of the canary 
that goes down into the mine with the miners: when the canary starts 
squawking and squawking and finally keels over, the miners figure it's 
time to come up and think things over a little bit. That's the 
writer-the twentieth-century writer is the canary for the larger 
society.<br>
Maybe a lot of us use the idea of "celebrity" to maintain the notion 
that everything is all right, that there's always someone making their 
million the next day. As a celebrity, you don't worry about your bills, 
you have an enormous freedom to write and to do what you want. You can 
live with it well. But if your work is involved in trying to show where 
the country is hurting and where people are hurting, your own success is
 used to knock down or undercut the questions you ask of your audience. 
It's tricky, because American society has a very strict idea of what 
success is and what failure is. We're all "born in the U.S.A." and some 
part of you carries that with you. But it's ironic if "celebrity" is 
used to reassure lots of people, barely making it, that "Look, someone's
 really making it, making it big, so everything is all right, just lose 
yourself and all your troubles in that big-time success!"<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">WP: Do you think you're through making music videos?</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">BS :</strong> I don't know. I probably am. 
There's nobody waiting with bated breath out there for my next video 
right now. I've never been much of a video artist. I was "prevideo," and
 I think I remain "prevideo," though maybe I'm "postvideo" now.<br>
Music videos have had an enormous impact on the way that you receive 
visual images on television and in the theaters-and it sped up the 
entire way the music world worked, for better or for worse. When I 
started, you had a band, you toured two or three, four years, you did a 
thousand shows or five hundred shows, that's how you built your 
audience, and then maybe you had a hit record. I feel sorry for some of 
these talented young bands that come up: they have a hit record, a video
 or two, and then it's over. I think it might have made the music world 
more fickle. In some ways, it may be more expedient for some of the 
young acts, but I think it's harder also, because you don't have the 
time to build a long-standing relationship with your audience.<br>
There was something about developing an audience slowly-you'd draw an 
audience that stood with you over a long period of time, and it got 
involved with the questions you were asking and the issues you were 
bringing up. It's an audience who you shared a history with. I saw the 
work that I was doing as my life's work. I thought I'd be playing music 
my whole life and writing my whole life, and I wanted to be a part of my
 audience's ongoing life. The way you do that is the same way your 
audience lives its life-you do it by attempting to answer the questions 
that both you and they have asked, sometimes with new questions. You 
find where those questions lead you to-your actions in the world. You 
take it out of the aesthetic and you hopefully bring it into your 
practical, everyday life, the moral or ethical.<br>
"Man on the Train" helped me think about these things in some fashion, 
where your uncle dissects the old Western movie heroes. We have our 
mythic hero, Gary Cooper, who is capable of pure action, where it's 
either all or nothing, and he looks like he's walking over that abyss of
 anxiety, and he won't fail. Whereas the moviegoer, the person watching 
the movie, is not capable of that. There's no real abyss under Gary 
Cooper, but there is one under the guy watching the film! Bringing 
people out over that abyss, helping them and myself to realize where we 
all "are," helping my audience answer the questions that are 
there-that's what I'm interested in doing with my own work.<br>
That's what I try to accomplish at night in a show. Presenting ideas, 
asking questions, trying to bring people closer to characters in the 
songs, closer to themselves-so that they take those ideas, those 
questions-fundamental moral questions about the way we live and the way 
we behave toward one another-and then move those questions from the 
aesthetic into the practical, into some sort of action, whether it's 
action in the community, or action in the way you treat your wife, or 
your kid, or speak to the guy who works with you. That is what can be 
done, and is done, through film and music and photography and painting. 
Those are real changes I think you can make in people's lives, and that 
I've had made in my life through novels and films and records and people
 who meant something to me. Isn't that what your uncle meant by 
"existentialist reþection"?<br>
And there's a lot of different ways that gets done. You don't have to be
 doing work that's directly socially conscious. You could make an 
argument that one of the most socially conscious artists in the second 
half of this century was Elvis Presley, even if he probably didn't start
 out with any set of political ideas that he wanted to accomplish. He 
said, "I'm all shook up and I want to shake you up," and that's what 
happened. He had an enormous impact on the way that people lived, how 
they responded to themselves, to their own physicality, to the 
integration of their own nature. I think that he was one of the people, 
in his own way, who led to the sixties and the Civil Rights movement. He
 began getting us "all shook up," this poor white kid from Mississippi 
who connected with black folks through their music, which he made his 
own and then gave to others. So pop culture is a funny thing-you can 
affect people in a lot of different ways.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">WP: Did you always try to affect the audience like that? When you first started out, when you were young?</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">BS: </strong>We were trying to excite 
people, we were trying to make people feel alive. The core of rock music
 was cathartic. There was some fundamental catharsis that occurred in 
"Louie, Louie." That lives on, that pursuit. Its very nature was to get 
people "in touch" with themselves and with each other in some fashion. 
So initially you were just trying to excite people, and make them happy,
 alert them to themselves, and do the same for yourself. It's a way of 
combating your own indifference, your own tendency to slip into 
alienation and isolation. That's also in "Man on the Train": we can't be
 alienated together. If we're all alienated together, we're really not 
alienated.<br>
That's a lot of what music did for me-it provided me with a community, 
filled with people, and brothers and sisters who I didn't know, but who I
 knew were out there. We had this enormous thing in common, this "thing"
 that initially felt like a secret. Music always provided that home for 
me, a home where my spirit could wander. It performed the function that 
all art and film and good human relations performed-it provided me with 
the kind of "home" always described by those philosophers your uncle 
loved.<br>
There are very real communities that were built up around that 
notion-the very real community of your local club on Saturday night. The
 importance of bar bands all across America is that they nourish and 
inspire that community. So there are the very real communities of people
 and characters, whether it's in Asbury Park or a million different 
towns across the land. And then there is the community that it was 
enabling you to imagine, but that you haven't seen yet. You don't even 
know it exists, but you feel that, because of what you heard or 
experienced, it could exist.<br>
That was a very powerful idea because it drew you outward in search of 
that community-a community of ideas and values. I think as you get older
 and develop a political point of view, it expands out into those 
worlds, the worlds of others, all over America, and you realize it's 
just an extension of that thing that you felt in a bar on Saturday night
 in Asbury Park when it was a hundred and fifty people in the room.<br>
What do you try to provide people? What do parents try to provide their 
children? You're supposed to be providing a hopeful presence, a decent 
presence, in your children's lives and your neighbors' lives. That's 
what I would want my children to grow up with and then to provide when 
they become adults. It's a big part of what you can do with song, and 
pictures and words. It's real and its results are physical and tangible.
 And if you follow its implications, it leads you both inward and 
outward. Some days we climb inside, and some days maybe we run out. A 
good day is a balance of those sort of things. When rock music was 
working at its best, it was doing all of those things-looking inward and
 reaching out to others.<br>
To get back to where we started, it can be difficult to build those 
kinds of connections, to build and sustain those kinds of communities, 
when you're picked up and thrown away so quickly-that cult of celebrity.
 At your best, your most honest, your least glitzy, you shared a common 
history, and you attempted both to ask questions and answer them in 
concert with your audience. In concert. The word "concert"-people 
working together-that's the idea. That's what I've tried to do as I go 
along with my work. I'm thankful that I have a dedicated, faithful 
audience that's followed along with me a good part of the way. It's one 
of my life's great blessings-having that companionship and being able to
 rely on that companionship. You know, "companionship" means breaking 
bread with your brothers and sisters, your fellow human beings-the most 
important thing in the world! It's sustained my family and me and my 
band throughout my life.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">WP: Do you think you've extended your 
audience to include some of the kinds of people that you're writing 
about now: Mexican immigrants, homeless people? Do you feel that you're 
doing something for those people with your music?</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">BS </strong>: There's a difference between 
an emotional connection with them, like I think I do have, and a more 
physical, tangible impact. There was a point in the mid-eighties where I
 wanted to turn my music into some kind of activity and action, so that 
there was a practical impact on the communities that I passed through 
while I traveled around the country. On this last tour, I would meet a 
lot of the people who are out there on the front line-activists, legal 
advocates, social workers-and the people that they're involved with. It 
varied from town to town, but we'd usually work with an organization 
that's providing immediate care for people in distress, and then also 
we'd find an organization that's trying to have some impact on local 
policy. It helped me get a sense of what was going on in those towns, 
and the circumstances that surround the people that I'm imagining in my 
songs, in the imagined community I create with my music.<br>
I'm sure I've gotten a lot more out of my music than I've put in, but 
those meetings and conversations keep me connected so that I remember 
the actual people that I write about. But I wouldn't call myself an 
activist. I'm more of a concerned citizen. I think I'd say that I'm up 
to my knees in it, but I'm not up to my ass!<br>
I guess I'm-rock bottom-a concerned, even aroused observer, sort of like
 the main character of Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. Not that I'm 
invisible! But Ellison's character doesn't directly take on the world. 
He wants to see the world change, but he's mainly a witness, a witness 
to a lot of blindness. I recently heard two teachers, one black and one 
white, talking about that novel, and it sure got to them; it's what 
Ellison wanted it to be, it's a great American story-and in a way we're 
all part of it.</div>

<br>
December 15, 2012</strong><br>
<br>
IT'S 60 seconds before showtime. Bruce Springsteen, the E Street Band 
and almost a dozen additional musicians are huddled in a circle behind a
 stage in Anaheim, California. A stone's throw from Disneyland, the full
 house holds almost 20,000 fans making a helluva noise in anticipation 
of Springsteen's arrival.<br>
<br>
Holding hands, the band leans in to hear Springsteen offer a few rousing
 words of encouragement. Mugging for the occasion, Springsteen looks 
serious and finally comes out of a long pause and grimaces.<br>
<br>
"Thirty-six years ago, Little Steven [Van Zandt] and I came here to 
visit the happiest place on earth - and they kicked us out for wearing 
bandanas.<br>
<br>
"Tonight ... we take our revenge."<br>
<br>
And that's what Springsteen proceeds to do: the arena is alight as the 
man who recently tipped his hat to James Brown by referring to himself 
as the hardest working white man in show business delivered the greatest
 rock 'n' roll show on earth.<br>
<br>
Springsteen has pledged his professional life to his promise and his 
audience: "night after night after night". His ticket is his handshake 
and as the old soul song goes, "ninety-nine and a half just won't do". 
It's a sentiment echoed by his long-time manager Jon Landau: "Bruce 
always gives 100 per cent of what he has, every day."<br>
<br>
In his dressing-room a couple of hours before showtime, Springsteen is 
relaxed in a pale T-shirt and dark jeans. Suntanned and in an upbeat 
mood, he's strumming an acoustic guitar and being asked to ruminate on 
something he has spent almost five decades trying to achieve: creating 
magic with the songs he has written in front of an audience looking to 
be uplifted.<br>
<br>
"You don't want to overthink it," Springsteen muses on what may lie ahead once the tour manager rings the proverbial bell.<br>
<br>
"It's all about complete commitment when the moment arrives. You can be 
back here [in the dressing room] feeling like: 'I don't feel so good'; 
for the show itself, you need to use your mind, but that's not the 
moment to be intellectual. I'm out there just trying to see what catches
 fire. I'm trying to set myself on fire while I'm at it."<br>
<br>
A high-octane show, the set lists on his Wrecking Ball tour run the 
gamut of the artist's career. As the core E Street Band is joined on 
stage by a small army of brass players and additional singers, 
Springsteen's range of material goes back to his 1973 debut Greetings 
from Asbury Park, New Jersey through to his latest album, this year's 
Wrecking Ball. As at any time during Springsteen's career, no single 
show is the same.<br>
<br>
As he says, over so many nights on tour, Springsteen wants his audience 
to exit the arena with "your back hurting, your voice sore and your 
sexual organs stimulated".<br>
<br>
"If you're willing to let things happen ... you don't know what you're 
going to find out there on any given night," says Springsteen as he's 
reminded of a moment two nights earlier in Oakland, California, when a 
fan in the crowd held up a sign that simply read "Dance with a Hungarian
 Girl". The Boss complied.<br>
<br>
To a man, the E Street Band refers to itself as a bar band. It's just 
that the rooms kept getting bigger. After playing stadiums throughout 
the year in Europe, the bulk of the venues the band will perform in on 
their upcoming Australian tour are comparatively cosy.<br>
<br>
"It's all relative," Springsteen explains. "After playing in Europe for 
three or four months, an arena feels like you're back in the club. The 
bottom line and the mechanics are the same wherever you are. There are 
some subtle differences in the way you have to approach your 
presentation.<br>
<br>
"Smallness allows for more informality, though we've gotten very good at
 creating an enormous amount of informality, even in the biggest places.
 We have a 16 or 17-piece band up there that turns on a dime. It plays 
like a three-piece band."<br>
<br>
As a child Springsteen flirted briefly with folk music. A cousin taught 
him some rudimentary chords; then he saw Elvis Presley on The Ed 
Sullivan Show in 1956 and his world changed. If ever there were a big 
bang in Springsteen's youth, that was it. Just as the boy who grew up in
 Freehold, New Jersey, was inspired to move by Elvis, later he had his 
mind freed by Bob Dylan.<br>
<br>
Now 63, Springsteen has had a long career fusing those twin powers, 
adding other influences - his own twist - and coming up with something 
unique. Soul music, rhythm and blues and early rock 'n' roll are part of
 Springsteen's bedrock. As a writer with a gift for detailed 
portraiture, he's an American great ranking alongside Dylan and John 
Steinbeck. As a performer, there's no other artist in the world like 
him.<br>
<br>
"Next year I'll be doing it for 50 years," he considers. "That's 50 
years of not just doing it but studying it and watching - I still watch 
everything that comes along. It's an ongoing, an endless work in 
progress."<br>
<br>
Musically, he's partial at the moment to the likes of the Gaslight 
Anthem and Against Me! He jams with the Roots, and Rage Against the 
Machine's Tom Morello is called onstage, tonight, as is Social 
Distortion's Mike Ness. Soul music remains a passion and a few nights 
later he'll barnstorm the crowd to find an empty seat next to the great 
Sam Moore (Sam &amp; Dave) to engage in a little call and response.<br>
<br>
Backstage the conversation moves to Elvis Presley. Whereas Presley 
engaged his audience but, largely, kept a regal distance, Springsteen is
 one of us: the everyman who kicked down the fourth wall; the gun for 
hire, both the loner and the leader of the gang and myriad other ideals 
his audience wants to project on to him. Springsteen first saw Presley 
in concert, before his own fame, in New York City, a few years before 
jumping the wall at Graceland to offer the King, who was absent, a song.<br>
<br>
"By the time I saw him in the 70s, I was studying everything I saw," he 
offers. "I can be there both as a fan and as a student. When he came out
 on stage my recollection was he was great. [But] the Ed Sullivan 
performances were a classic example of how somebody can convert a cool 
medium into something that delivers an enormous amount of heat. It's 
very hard to do. That's why we stayed off television for a long time. We
 weren't on television until 1994, live, because it's fundamentally a 
cooler medium and we bring the heat. Elvis was hot; but the Beatles were
 quite cool and classical. It was all in the math and the beauty of 
their songs and talent."<br>
<br>
During the sound check Springsteen arrives on stage busting slow motion 
dance moves that wouldn't be out of place on Soul Train. His laugh is 
infectious and it fills the empty arena. It's here Springsteen further 
fine-tunes an arrangement or two.<br>
<br>
Unlike any other band with similar stadium drawing power, back in his 
dressing-room with his notebooks, laptop and lozenges, pre-show, 
Springsteen handwrites a list of songs to be performed that night, which
 is essentially a "guide" for how the concert will play out. The E 
Street Band calls the missing links "audibles", which means Springsteen 
will pull a song out of thin air, or he may spot a sign requesting a 
tune that's held up by a member of the audience and launch into that.<br>
<br>
It's seat-of-the-pants stuff, as guitarist Van Zandt says: "Bruce tells 
me, I tell Roy [Bittan] and everyone else fends for themselves." That's 
when the band catches Springsteen's signals and turns on that dime. When
 it happens, it's a thing of wonder.<br>
<br>
"What people are paying for is the intensity of your presence," 
Springsteen says. "They want to hear their favourite songs and all that 
stuff, but I always believe what they really respond to is the intensity
 of your presence on any given night. If the set becomes too rote you 
can sort of rest on its laurels [or] you can rest on its form and its 
formula. I don't want the band to be resting on any particular formula. 
We have a general blueprint. Some songs appear in the beginning, some 
songs appear towards the end. I may switch that completely. Lately we've
 been starting with Land of Hope and Dreams, which we've been ending the
 shows with for the past bunch of years.<br>
<br>
"Sometimes you just turn it all completely on its head and suddenly 
everything is new again and the band and myself are pushed into the 
moment, which is where you want to be and what people are coming to 
see."<br>
<br>
Like the Rolling Stones, the E Street Band is a magnificent unit built 
on the sum of its parts. Max Weinberg is a powerhouse on drums. Bittan 
is virtuosic on piano. Nils Lofgren, in Springsteen's words, "is the 
greatest, most overqualified" second guitarist in the world, and there's
 rock-solid Garry W. Tallent on bass. Springsteen's wife, Patti Scialfa,
 plays when family life permits and Van Zandt remains Bruce's best pal 
and consigliore while earning a reputation as a DJ and an actor in The 
Sopranos and Norwegian drama Lilyhammer. Sadly missing are organist Dan 
Federici, who died from melanoma in 2008, and Springsteen's on-stage 
foil and soul brother, saxophonist Clarence Clemons, who died last year.
 "My relationship with [Clarence] fired my imagination and my own 
dreams," Springsteen said when Wrecking Ball was launched in Paris. "It 
made me want to write for those sax sounds. Losing him is like losing 
rain or air - it's elemental. It'll take a village of men to replace the
 Big Man!"<br>
<br>
And indeed it has. Apart from the four-piece horn section on stage each 
night, Springsteen has called on Clarence's nephew Jake Clemons to play 
with the ensemble while taking his uncle's signature parts in concert 
staples such as Badlands, Jungleland and Thunder Road.<br>
<br>
A key theme of the tour is dealing with loss, honouring the past and 
walking alongside your own ghosts. Friendship, faith, spiritual 
rejuvenation and personal renewal are threads that pepper Springsteen's 
onstage dialogue. The experience is heightened by the shared experience 
of the songs between the songwriter and his audience. For Springsteen, 
the Wrecking Ball concerts also allow his audience to say goodbye to 
Federici and "the Big Man".<br>
<br>
"We've been on the road for a while now," Springsteen continues, "but 
basically we're going to every place for the first time. If people have 
seen the band before they haven't seen us since Clarence was gone, so 
we're trying to help them in just dealing with that experience. I knew 
[this acknowledgment] was going to be a permanent fixture of the show 
for certainly this tour. People need a chance to say hello again and 
goodbye. They need to feel Clarence, both his absence and his 
permanence. We try to bring that into the show on a nightly basis."<br>
<br>
While Charlie Giordano now plays organ in the band, Springsteen's troupe
 features additional percussion, violin and four heavenly singers who 
bring a little more gospel to the choruses. In a way Springsteen has 
moved the band forward by looking over his shoulder.<br>
<br>
"If you go back to the band I had in 1971, before I made records, I had a
 10-piece band and I had singers and horns in it. I didn't have as big a
 vocal section or horn section but it was basically this set-up. Steve 
played the guitar, Garry played the bass, and I think Davy Sancious was 
the organist at the time. We carried that band - couldn't carry it too 
long because it was so many people. So in a funny way it's a very 
similar set-up that I had when I was very young at one time. It's a band
 that can play so many different types of music, from hard-rock music to
 gospel and soul and some jazz, traditional jazz, New Orleans, it covers
 so much territory."<br>
<br>
Already eight-odd shows into the Wrecking Ball Tour, Springsteen is 
showing no signs of slowing down. At the musical core of the night are 
Springsteen classics and material from the critically acclaimed Wrecking
 Ball album. Taking its handle from the few tonnes of mongrel metal that
 brought down New Jersey's Giants Stadium, Wrecking Ball ruminates on 
much that has gone sour with the American, and more broadly, the Western
 dream in recent years.<br>
<br>
When writing the album, the fire in Springsteen's belly was stoked by 
the fallout from 2008's financial crisis; in particular the effect it 
had on individuals, the loss of jobs and dignity, failure of the system 
to take responsibility for that collapse and the eventual formation of 
the Occupy movement.<br>
<br>
A highlight in concert, the rousing We Take Care of Our Own, which opens
 Wrecking Ball, is crucial to the writer's approach in sequencing an 
album.<br>
<br>
"If you look at my records, say The River, for example, it starts out 
with The Ties that Bind and the rest of the record deals with that 
idea," Springsteen told me before the tour began. "If you listen to 
Darkness on the Edge of Town, the album starts with Badlands and the 
rest of the record deals with philosophical questions that come up in 
Badlands. Born to Run starts with Thunder Road, which is two people off 
on a journey of some sort, and the rest of the record tries to figure 
out where they're going. I do it very often in many of my records.<br>
<br>
"[We Take Care of Our Own] in that sense, it was summational, but it 
also postulated what I was thinking about at that particular moment in 
time, which was what a 'record' does. It's the record of your thoughts, 
feelings and experiences at a given moment. That came at a moment 
obviously with the terrible financial crash, which saw an enormous price
 paid by so many people when that occurred. It was just a question and a
 declaration at the same time. It's one of those songs that has a lot of
 different layers to it."<br>
<br>
In Oakland, Springsteen went out among the crowd gathering up signs used
 by fans to write their requests. Hits, deep cuts and obscurities are 
all called for. In Anaheim actor Rob Lowe asked to borrow a pen to make a
 makeshift sign using a large napkin. He asked for a full band version 
of The Promise.<br>
<br>
A greener fan holds up a placard for Born to Run: Bruce assures the audience they don't need a sign for that one.<br>
<br>
Later in the night he revisits his own rock 'n' roll past and lifts a 
girl out of the audience to dance with him during Dancing In the Dark. 
It's a perfect moment where a fan meets her idol and whole room is 
willing them on.<br>
<br>
"It's a rock song now," says Springsteen of how he has reinvented the 
work. "We've moved it a bit from its pop inception - it's now a more 
spit-out version of it than it was on the record. But it still contains 
its essence: it sets the joint alight because it was such a big hit," he
 adds, laughing.<br>
<br>
"It was a hit because there was something really universal in it. That's
 just one of those perfect pop songs that come out and catch a 
particular attitude and feeling at a certain moment. It maintains its 
urgency, which is the secret to anything that we play at night."<br>
<br>
With the passing of time the song carries a little more weight than when
 it was a synth-driven smash in the mid-80s and totally unlike anything 
else in the Springsteen songbook. "It was a song partly about ageing and
 'the joke's on me' little bridge is pretty nice. That was an element of
 it, which has always been an element of my music, going back to Thunder
 Road and maybe before. People tend to forget that in the 70s the oldest
 pop musicians were probably 30-something ... maybe, and that's the 
oldest." He laughs. "Dylan and the Stones were only in their 30s. Those 
guys are only about six or seven years older than me - it doesn't feel 
like much now. It's a short generational jump, between the second and 
third generation of rock musicians. It's brief."<br>
<br>
Politics is never far from Springsteen's conversation. Springsteen is a 
Democrat supporter, along with Jay Z and Will.I.Am, and his input into 
this year's election was seen as crucial in giving Barack Obama's 
flagging campaign the lift it required in the final stages. When he was 
called, Springsteen turned up at rallies across the country armed with 
an acoustic guitar and was prepared to do his bit.<br>
<br>
"[My involvement] began with the Bush presidency ... things got very bad
 ... [they were] dire. But it's nice to be there the night before the 
day. I always put my two cents in if we are asked. I was glad to be 
involved and certainly glad of the outcome."<br>
<br>
With Obama's win so striking, one wonders whether the US could be on the threshold of a new liberalism.<br>
<br>
"It's hard to say," Springsteen says. "Through history [America] tends 
to be a pretty centrist country at the end of the day. I think that 
obviously the voter demographic is changing dramatically. It certainly 
affected this election, and you can't have a political party that's 
going to succeed while trying to just appeal to older white males at 
this point. That's not going to work.<br>
<br>
"Those changes were acknowledged as facts, as historical facts, as a way
 the country is moving. You can figure that out in the mid-90s in 
California when I wrote The Ghost of Tom Joad, which was basically a 
record about immigrants, and you could say - you knew in California in 
the mid-90s that this was the way the rest of the country was going to 
go 10 or 15 years later. That's exactly what happened.<br>
<br>
"I'd like to think there's a more progressive push - it's hard to say - I
 actually felt the Republican presence was so poor in the election. It 
was sad. The country needs debate and exchange about different ways of 
doing things. But I think this election was a watermark and 
acknowledgment that the country is changing."<br>
<br>
An hour after showtime, the stage is being pulled down and about to be 
shipped to the next city. Springsteen is back in his civilian clothes, 
tired but glowing like a man half his age. Thirty odd years ago he said 
it best: "When you get out there man ... you gotta be rockin!" Sparks 
fly on E Street.<br>

<br>
Rod Tootell, Rock's Backpages, December 2012</strong><br>
<br>
IN SEPTEMBER 1974, a Swedish journalist was interviewing a rock singer 
pretty much unknown in Sweden. His name was Bruce Springsteen.<br>
<br>
"Are you a pessimist?" the journalist asked.<br>
<br>
"No, I think I'm real optimistic," Springsteen quickly replied. But 
listening to him talk during that interview, it's hard not to hear 
weariness in his voice.<br>
<br>
"As you go along," he said, "it gets more difficult. It's like blocks. 
You've got your first block and the second one, and then you've got to 
put something on top of that and it gets higher each time."<br>
<br>
Springsteen was not selling enough records. Columbia, his record 
company, was deliberating as to whether he was worth the effort. His one
 ally there, Clive Davis, had left the label. Possibly the situation was
 down to the way both he and his manager Mike Appel were behaving. 
Springsteen stubbornly refused to give up any artistic control, while 
Appel was out and about haranguing radio stations and Columbia, telling 
them that they were a bunch of schmucks for not being 100% supportive of
 his protégé.<br>
<br>
To Jerry Gilbert of ZigZag, Springsteen admitted that he hadn't paid the
 band in three weeks: "Rents are due, and alimony, and we just don't 
have the money."<br>
<br>
Things had not always been that tough. Fifteen months earlier, he didn't
 have to try. The future was looking bright. He had one album under his 
belt and the money to make another. Everything was about to come 
together. The album would be called The Wild, the Innocent and the E 
Street Shuffle.<br>
<br>
"Blackie's down by the railroad track, he sinks low in the backseat of 
his Cadillac..." So begins Bruce Springsteen's whispered elegy to the 
Big City. It was April 1973 and he called it 'New York Song'. In those 
days his songs never stayed the same for long. They might change title, 
verse and chorus in the space of a day or a week. This was just another 
small step in a progression that had started in earnest since he had 
decided to put the guitar down for a while and try to do something all 
the other guitar players couldn't do – write songs.<br>
<br>
Initially they were hard to come by. The songs had little real 
definition and few melodic hooks. Mike Appel, who believed in him when 
no one else did, saw something in them but told him to go write some 
more. By the time Appel managed to bludgeon his way into the offices of 
legendary Columbia producer and talent scout John Hammond, Springsteen 
had a few really good ones, including 'Growin' Up' and 'Its Hard to be a
 Saint in the City'.<br>
<br>
Apart from the songs, Hammond – along with Appel – recognised 
Springsteen's extraordinary faith in himself, a star quality. At 
Hammond's instigation Springsteen headed for 914 Sound Studios to make 
his first album, Greetings from Asbury Park. But in the process of 
becoming a songwriter, Springsteen had left behind a bunch of musicians 
who had played with him in various bands of the previous five years. 
These he called up to join him on the album. By the time it was 
finished, he had written two more songs that were to serve him in good 
stead, 'Spirit in the Night' and 'Blinded by the Light'. The former 
became a live favourite and the latter was eventually a hit for Manfred 
Mann.<br>
<br>
But there was a one-dimensional quality to Springsteen's songwriting at 
this point. As many reviewers remarked when Greetings came out, the 
songs were so riddled with imagery, so packed with more words, that it 
was as if he wanted to get everything down in case he never had the 
chance to do it again.<br>
<br>
The songs were just plain eccentric. They did a certain job, though. He 
didn't sound like anybody else, not even Bob Dylan – a comparison that 
was often wheeled out by critics at the time. They also went down a 
storm at his concerts: 'Spirits in the Night', 'Bishop Danced', 
'Thundercrack', 'Blinded...', 'Hard to be Saint...', 'Growin' Up', 'Does
 this Bus Stop at 82nd St?'. Springsteen toured these songs on 130 dates
 all over the Eastern States, often as a support act, doing forty-minute
 sets or less.<br>
<br>
With Clarence Clemons on saxophone, Danny Federici on organ, Garry 
Tallent on bass and Vini "Mad Dog" Lopez on drums, it was a solid band. 
But the formula was lacking something. Columbia gave the green light to 
book the studio for a second album, and this time Springsteen came up 
with something altogether different.<br>
<br>
Various factors could be attributed as to why The Wild, the Innocent and
 the E St Shuffle is such a special album and why Springsteen's 
songwriting matured so much around the time of these sessions. Even 
though the first album had not sold well, he had no reason to take this 
badly and there was little pressure on him at the time. He knew the 
studio already and felt relaxed there. Mike Appel was out there fighting
 his battles for him, albeit a little too zealously. The band was no 
longer a new combination: they had paid their dues on the road, a 
circuit that offered little glamour, and were still there for him.<br>
<br>
But there were two big changes. Danny Federici had not played on the 
first album, although he was gigging with Springsteen at the time. His 
organ and accordion sound would contribute hugely to the sound of the 
second one. The main contribution, though, would come from another 
part-time band member, pianist David Sancious.<br>
<br>
Sancious was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, and began playing music on
 a cheap guitar at the age of four. Two years later he went on to learn 
the piano. His parents loved music, whether it was jazz, classical, rock
 or blues. They passed this on to their three sons. David, however, was 
to take it quite a few steps further.<br>
<br>
David Sancious: I left high school when I was 15 years old, which in New
 Jersey at that time you could do without your parents' consent. I had 
already been playing in clubs since I was about 13. I lied about my age 
for a lot of years. I was 19 years old for about six years. Yeah, for at
 least five or six years I was 19 years old. I don't think anyone 
believed me because I had a really young face and a young voice, but I 
got away with it a lot.<br>
<br>
Right after school I worked a few jobs, got a job in a guitar factory – 
the Danelectro guitar factory – for awhile. I worked as a landscaper for
 a while, you know, stuff like that, and then playing on the weekends. I
 was pretty much restricted to that. Out of school, all I did was music 
full-time. I was either practising at home by myself every day, and at 
night I would just play, wherever I could play, as much as possible.<br>
<br>
There were a lot of bands playing along the Jersey shore at the time, 
many breaking up and reforming into different incarnations. It was 
almost inevitable that Sancious would eventually run into Springsteen.<br>
<br>
DS: I met Bruce at Upstage – a club in Asbury Park – through Gary 
Tallent. Gary and I had met and worked together before. I think we did a
 recording session for someone at a studio session and we hit it off 
right away. One night we were going to Upstage and Bruce was putting a 
jam session together for the second half of the night, which used to run
 from one o'clock until five in the morning. I was walking up the stairs
 and Gary introduced me to Bruce. Bruce asked if I was interested in 
playing in our jams. I said sure. We were used to playing for hours at a
 time and that was the start of it. He had a band called Steel Mill that
 he was going to break up.<br>
<br>
We closed the place. It was five o'clock in the morning and we were 
walking out, and at that hour the last thing you can do is go right home
 and go to bed and go to sleep so we all used to, you know, walk down to
 the ocean and hang out. If you live nearby, you're walking home or 
catching a ride back to Belmar or wherever you came from. And we were 
walking out of the club and he said, "I'm going to be breaking up Steel 
Mill and starting a new band, would you be interested?" I said, "Yeah, 
absolutely". He was going to start this new band which became, 
eventually, the E Street Band. It wasn't called that for a long time, it
 was just Bruce Springsteen. Then we had a band called Dr Zoom &amp; the
 Sonic Boom. That was like a kind of Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen thing, 
music and theatre at the same time.<br>
<br>
Before meeting Bruce I was just like everybody else, just in that club 
scene you know, I was more concerned about getting really good on the 
instrument and I'd also sort of secretly started playing guitar around 
that time, which I kind of kept to myself for a while and then I broke 
it out one night. But that was it, just the club scene around Asbury 
Park, a lot of practising and jam sessions.<br>
<br>
Southside Johnny: It was really a great crucible and sort of our 
college, because we were teenagers back then, and we learned so many 
styles of music, country and western, blues, guitar rock, because no one
 ever said no to anything. They were all, "I'm gonna be a musician", not
 "I'm gonna try to be a musician". They were so determined that was 
going to be what they did. No fallback, no college, no learn another 
craft, forget it.<br>
<br>
Sancious did not play continuously with Springsteen. He played on 
Greetings from Asbury Park, most notably on 'Lost in the Flood', but 
afterwards returned to where he was based in Richmond, Virginia, and was
 not part of the band that toured to promote the album.<br>
<br>
But in the words of Danny Federici, who had known him from playing 
around the area years before, Sancious "disappeared from the scene for a
 few years and then he came back as this unbelievable piano player". 
When he joined the sessions for the second album he had become a truly 
gifted player, able to move effortlessly from one genre to another, 
fitting in with whatever was happening musically at the time. His part 
in the sessions seemed to glue together a lot of elements in the general
 sound of the band. At least four or five of the tracks that would 
eventually make it on to the album were already recorded when Sancious 
joined the sessions, but when it was finished he would be all over it, 
especially the second side. He was joining up with a band that had been 
together for two years.<br>
<br>
DS: We weren't the only good musicians around the shore, but it was a 
collection of pretty much the best players who were around that area at 
that time, you know. Bruce was absolutely the guitar hero of the whole 
area. The band was always really interesting. Vini Lopez had a really 
unique style, Gary's a fantastic bass player, Danny's great on the organ
 and accordion... and Clarence, of course.<br>
<br>
The producers' roles were once again taken up by Mike Appel and his 
partner Jim Cretecos, but subject to Springsteen's vision. 914 Sound 
Studios were situated in Rockland County, a few miles into New York 
State over the border from New Jersey. As with the sessions for the 
first album, Mike Appel had chosen 914 as a way to economise.<br>
<br>
DS: I remember that when we started the recording for the album, 
everybody was a little run down physically. Clarence had tonsillitis, I 
had a kind of cold or something, you know it was a bunch of people who 
were just working, because you had to do that, and then everybody got 
better of course, and carried on. But I do remember the atmosphere in 
the sessions as being fairly relaxed, not too uptight, not too tense, 
but it was a lot of work. We worked a lot of hours. We started in the 
morning, we used to drive up to 914 from New Jersey and then I think 
they put us in a hotel across the road from it or something. But we put 
in a really seriously full day and night.<br>
<br>
Some reports suggest that the musicians slept in tents at the back of the studio.<br>
<br>
DS: There was a place where you could go in the back of the studio and 
crash out for a while if you were tired. I definitely remember everybody
 taking advantage of that at some point .I don't remember a tent. It 
doesn't mean it wasn't there.<br>
<br>
Springsteen set about recording some songs already written and some that developed during the sessions.<br>
<br>
'The E Street Shuffle' is one of the latter, an instruction to a dance 
step that one might spontaneously start up at a party. Springsteen would
 write these songs all through his career to get the crowd moving at his
 concerts. Albee Tellone, Springsteen's sound manager at the time, 
recalls that the song was in its infancy when Sancious joined. Seeing 
him and Springsteen working on it at the pianist's house, he assumed 
that they had written it together. The song snaps and fizzes like a 
firecracker out of control. The band would play it fast and on another 
night play it slow.<br>
<br>
Along with 'The 'E Street Shuffle', 'Kitty's Back' is another track that
 would bolster Springsteen's live shows, each made up of different 
sections which could be expanded to allow each musician to solo if 
necessary. Set to a tune reminiscent of Van Morrison's 'Moondance', with
 the title taken from an advertisement at a Stripper's Lounge, it starts
 with Springsteen's spare guitar, playing clipped notes like Robbie 
Robertson, and leads into a jazz mix of organ and horns.<br>
<br>
There is so much going on in these two songs. Where Springsteen went 
into lyrical overdrive on his first album, here he achieves a similar 
effect musically. He would never again get so near to jazz until the 
Seeger Sessions tour of 2006.<br>
<br>
'Wild Billy's Circus Story' had been in the band's live itinerary over 
the previous year. It describes the colourful elements of circus life 
and how a young boy becomes drawn into it. Springsteen later recalled 
the song was "a black comedy based on my memories of the fairs and the 
Clyde/Beatty Circus that visited Freehold" [Springsteen's hometown] when
 he was a kid.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen: They'd set up a midway and pitch their tents in a 
field across from the racetrack not far from my house. It was also a 
song about the seduction and loneliness of a life outside the margins of
 everyday life. At 24, already having spent a good deal of time on the 
road, for better or worse, that was the life I wanted to lead.<br>
<br>
Springsteen managed to bring together the combination of the wondrous 
and the scary facets of the carny life, made vivid by Garry Tallent's 
tuba and Federici's accordion.<br>
<br>
It's on '4th July Asbury Park (Sandy)' and the three tracks on the 
second side of the album that everything changed. Where all 
Springsteen's previous songs were packed full of almost cartoon-like 
city scenarios, these four songs have much more characterisation and 
sense of place. Even though the main character in the songs may not be 
Springsteen exactly, these were his first attempts at credible 
narrative. He began to write of love and hurt, triumph and failure, set 
in the vibrant world of the Jersey boardwalk and the harsher one of New 
York City. His phrasing has more flow .The melodies are unforgettably 
gorgeous.<br>
<br>
'Sandy' is a magical song, the singer telling his friend/girlfriend how 
things aren't going his way anymore, that the summer and the summer 
scene is probably over. With the melodramatic introspection of a 
22-year-old, he tells her they should get out of town. This is where 
Danny Federici really shines. His accordion evokes the calliope sounds 
of the carousels on the New Jersey, shore while Sancious' electric piano
 sprinkles stardust over the top.<br>
<br>
Whether he intended it or not, the three tracks that make up the second 
side have an operatic and thematic whole, even if they do lack a 
continuous storyline. They blend into each other so well that, to some 
listeners, they will always follow each other. It also says something 
about the ease that Springsteen must have felt at the time.<br>
<br>
'Incident on 57th Street' may be the greatest song Springsteen ever 
wrote. Starting and finishing with Sancious' trickling piano, the story 
of Spanish Johnny and Puerto Rican Jane evokes many story lines from the
 movies of the '50s and '60s. Johnny wants to lead the straight and 
narrow life for his girl, but keeps being drawn back to the criminal 
world of the Big City .The air is hot and damp. The languor suggests 
that nothing will really change.<br>
<br>
Springsteen talked in 1974 about how, compared to New York, growing up in Jersey gave him a little more room to make choices:<br>
<br>
I was fortunate enough to have the option of splitting to the city. When
 it got too much I could always go back. There were a lot of cats that 
didn't have that particular option, so I tried to choose the best of 
both worlds. I can write optimistically about a lot of tough subjects, 
how good it is to be in the city in the summer, but a lot of people get 
trapped.<br>
<br>
Every member of the band delivered on this track – apart from Clemons, 
who doesn't feature on it. The piano rides the high road above the 
organ, while the drums and bass seem to just go off where they feel like
 going. The guitar just builds and builds.<br>
<br>
Both 'Incident' and the last track on the second side, 'New York City 
Serenade', are unashamedly romantic – stories of young love frozen in 
time.<br>
<br>
'Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)' is the track that most fans will know from
 the album. It was for years the highlight of Springsteen's live show, 
bringing to the fore the huge saxophone sound of Clarence Clemons. The 
song never seems to finish .It just gets better and better, higher and 
higher. The story of a young man's hope of liberating his girl from the 
curfewed existence in her parent's home was based on Springsteen's own 
experience.<br>
<br>
BS: It's a rocker, a dance song. When I was a kid, I had this one girl, I
 was 17, I had a court injunction put out against me. The mother 
disliked me a lot, she would call the cops a lot if I came around. At 
night you would walk by the house, stand under the window...<br>
<br>
Considering the lack of "state of the art" equipment at the studio, 
Springsteen was still able to make this song sound larger than life 
simply by the sheer energy he injected into it. You can hear what each 
instrument is doing, and the sound is live and exhilarating. By the end 
of the track the concert is surely over... except for one last song.<br>
<br>
'New York City Serenade' is a perfect example of how, during these 
sessions, Springsteen was able to pull an extraordinary song out of 
something quite unremarkable. It came about through fusing together two 
earlier compositions called 'New York Song' and 'Vibes Man'. Like much 
of his earlier songwriting they both have a dirge-like quality. Their 
hybrid child takes it to a whole other level. Beginning with a long, 
almost classical, introduction by Sancious, with an unmistakable nod to 
Gershwin, the song settles down into a simple four-chord structure that 
gently carries you along. Springsteen alternately whispers and sighs in 
this musical love affair of the New York streets. When the song is 
finished you have forgotten what you were thinking when you put the 
needle down.<br>
<br>
'New York City Serenade' has been praised and in some cases derided by 
music critics, but for many Springsteen fans there is something 
elusively irresistible about it.<br>
<br>
DS: One of these people got in touch with me to say how much they 
appreciated the song and my contribution to it. He was saying he was 
kind of hypnotised by it. He kept on listening to it over and over 
again.<br>
<br>
Sancious indeed played a major role in formulating the piece, and Springsteen gave him the room to do it.<br>
<br>
DS: Well, you know, it comes from the fact that he wrote a beautiful 
song. The song itself is not complex, but he did an interesting thing 
where he sort of dressed up a fairly simple song in an elegant kind of 
way, like having a classically-orientated acoustic piano. And then the 
addition of the strings as well, you know. To put that song in the 
middle of all that texture was a brilliant idea.<br>
<br>
I think the producer or the engineer found these three guys, these three
 violinists who were music-school teachers from the local area. The 
whole string section was three people who got overdubbed. It wasn't a 
string section of people. The engineer, Louis Lahav was the first one to
 turn me on to the technique of doing that with strings. I knew about 
overdubs but if you don't have access to a whole bunch of string players
 you can tape three – or four preferably, if you really want to sound 
big –and you get them to play the entire arrangement about three times.<br>
<br>
These guys were lovely, and that was the first string arrangement I had 
ever written. I've written a few more since then for different people 
but that was my first opportunity and I was so excited about it. I 
worked really hard on it and I stayed up all night for several days, and
 then came the day that we got picked up to go do it. I was 
triple-checking everything, and I checked the harmony and wrote out the 
parts by hand. I was just leaving nothing to chance and it really worked
 beautifully. It had some interesting movement in it. And I also got to 
conduct them. I wouldn't call it conducting now, you know – these guys 
didn't need me to keep time but they needed a little bit of direction, I
 guess, as to where sections were. So I'm standing there conducting 
these three guys who were the age of the teachers I had in high school, 
and it was all working so beautifully. I just remember everyone being 
really, really happy with it, and Bruce was thrilled.<br>
<br>
Mike Appel: With Sancious you're dealing with an instrumentalist. And 
when he does his own thing he becomes more self-absorbed and a little 
more obscure than if he's forced into a Bruce Springsteen song 
structure. Then he only has a little bit for himself, a little spotlight
 for himself to shine, and I have found that there are a few musicians 
who are extraordinary when they are forced into that situation. It's 
almost like what Duke Ellington says, you know, "I don't need more time.
 I need a deadline". So it's like, "Davey, look, we need a little 
something here, can you help us out?" and then he just listens and 
doodles a bit and the next thing you know he comes up with an 
extraordinary thing. You say, "That's it, Davey. You couldn't have done 
anything better". And nobody could have.<br>
<br>
Even though he temporarily halted their subsequent tour to apply 
finishing touches to the album, Springsteen left the studio and went 
back out on the road as money was tight and they were ready to promote 
the album. With Sancious in the line-up, there was an extra component 
that changed the sound of what was soon to be known as the E Street 
Band. There was a new fluidity, a jazz sensibility that fitted perfectly
 with this collection of versatile musicians.<br>
<br>
Listening to the few live recordings of the time – from Max's Kansas 
City, where they were supported for six nights by the original line-up 
of the Wailers, to Gaston Hall in Georgetown and Liberty Hall in Houston
 – the band play at their most controlled but also at their most 
abandoned.<br>
<br>
"Hyperactivity was our business," said Springsteen when he later 
described the energy of the band at the time. Vini Lopez's drumming was,
 he said "wildly eccentric". When Lopez was forced to quit the band in 
February 1974 due to an altercation with the management and also 
possibly due to that eccentricity no longer fitting with where the band 
was heading, Sancious suggested his friend Ernest "Boom" Carter as a 
replacement. This made the band even more jazz orientated as Sancious 
and Carter started throwing all kinds of shapes into the mix.<br>
<br>
DS: Once Ernest was in the band... it's really a shame that there's not 
more of him officially recorded, but it really took off, I think. You 
know the change of drummer, it wasn't comfortable, but Bruce calculated 
that it was necessary musically and I think he was right. That band, it 
was really, really something and we were playing a lot and playing long 
shows. Bruce likes to play a long time, as you know, and there's nothing
 like getting a band in shape, you know, night after night after night, 
whether you are sick or well or whatever. There's nothing like... not 
just whipping a band into shape but having its own nature evolve.<br>
<br>
There is no doubt that, over the next year, there wasn't a cooler band 
in town. Looking at Barry Schneier's photos of the tour, they look like 
they're at the top of their game. Along with Springsteen's songs they 
played everything from 'Satin Doll' to 'Walkin' the Dog' to '634-5789'. 
But it took time for the songs on the album to become fully-fledged live
 regulars.<br>
<br>
'New York City Serenade' became a fixture almost immediately. Often they
 would begin the concert with it. Sancious would improvise the 
introduction, sometimes continuing for five minutes before Springsteen 
cut in, bending notes with his acoustic guitar. The crowd loved it.<br>
<br>
DS: I mean, it was pretty much complete freedom. Bruce said you can play
 whatever you like as long as you like, and when you've finished – when 
you feel you said what you wanted to say – just look up give me a nod 
and start the song. That's how we always did it live.<br>
<br>
'Sandy' and 'The E Street Shuffle' were also put straight into the show,
 but 'Kitty's Back' and 'Rosalita' did not become permanent parts of the
 live show until early 1974. For the rest of 1973, 'Thundercrack' 
fulfilled the role of lifting the crowd towards the end of the show. 
'Incident on 57th Street' never really took off live until Suki Lahav, 
wife of Louis Lahav, joined the band in September 1974. Her violin intro
 and outro gave it a wistful quality that was present on the album 
version. This wonderful version can now be heard on the recording of the
 show at the Main Point in Philadelphia in 1975, released in 2011.<br>
<br>
Halfway through 1974, Springsteen played a few gigs at a small club 
called Charlie's Place in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Attending one of the
 shows was journalist and producer, Jon Landau.<br>
<br>
DS: I remember that night 'cause I complained about the condition of the
 piano in the place and it was really not nice, it was not a good 
instrument. It wasn't clean and I was just fed up with playing... you 
know when you're a guitar player and it's your guitar it doesn't matter 
how good or bad the club is, it's your personal instrument.<br>
<br>
Piano players back in those days didn't have the luxury of having their 
own thing, so you're at the mercy of various places. As part of the 
condition of playing there, they rented a brand new Yamaha. It was a 
seven-foot grand piano, which was like heaven, and I really remember 
enjoying playing that night. But that show... I think Jon Landau sat on 
my left-hand side 'cause it was not a huge place so there was no big 
gulf of space between the band and the audience.<br>
<br>
A month later Landau returned to Boston to see Springsteen again. This 
time he wrote a life-affirming review of the show describing Springsteen
 as "rock and roll's future". From a position where Springsteen was 
winning converts, he now found himself having to live up to a messianic 
expectation that the review stirred up. At the same time, he now knew 
that the The Wild, the Innocent and the E St Shuffle had shifted few 
units. Columbia records' policy, as far as new bands on the label were 
concerned was: "Show us that you can sell records and we'll back you big
 time, until then you sink or swim." Springsteen was barely treading 
water. Columbia grudgingly allowed him one last chance. He would have to
 make an album that would live up to the "Great Prophecy".<br>
<br>
In August, Sancious and Carter left the band, having contributed to the 
first track that Springsteen recorded at 914 Studios for his next album –
 a song he would then agonise over for the next year. It was called 
'Born to Run'. Sancious had been offered a recording contract and left 
to form his own band, Tone, taking Carter with him. Over the next few 
decades Sancious would indeed "break out the guitar", releasing seven 
albums and playing with all manner of legendary musicians, including 
Aretha Franklin, Billy Cobham, Stanley Clarke, Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce 
and most notably with Peter Gabriel and Sting. Gabriel has described him
 as the "the musician's musician". Gabriel and Springsteen toured 
together during 1988's Amnesty International tour, when Sancious sat in 
with the E Street Band occasionally. He reunited briefly with 
Springsteen in 1992, playing on the Human Touch album.<br>
<br>
When Sancious left that August, Springsteen was generous to him, though it must have been a blow at the time.<br>
<br>
DS: There was never any kind of negative vibe from him. It was nothing 
to do with not being happy in the situation. It's just that I'd been 
working on my own music the whole time, always with an aim to do the 
very same kind of thing that he was doing. And he was the most 
supportive person in the world, actually. I mean, super-supportive. Even
 when I got signed to Columbia back then, and I was on the Epic records 
division of it, he went out of his way to smooth the way for me with 
certain people. I'm not saying he did anything that dramatic but 
whatever influence he had to make sure that I was going to have a good 
time, I think he just quietly did that. It might have just been like, 
"Hey... he's really a good guy, he deserves, you know, a shot or 
whatever". But totally supportive, and I got my first record done. I had
 a test pressing and I was living in Belmar and he was living in Long 
Branch. And I got in the car and drove down to his place and we hung out
 and listened to my whole record. He wanted to hear it and he was really
 complimentary about all kinds of stuff.<br>
<br>
But during his time in the band, Sancious had also given a lot to 
Springsteen. Whether or not his presence allowed Springsteen the room to
 mature musically and lyrically, there is no doubt that – for a short 
while – he was the catalyst that expanded Springsteen's musical journey.<br>
<br>
For Springsteen, however, the agenda changed with the upping of the 
stakes. He would now be forced to manage his career on a "now-or-never"'
 basis. No more risks, no more flirting with "carnival sounds" and 
free-form jazz. Over the next nine months, with a new pianist and 
drummer, the sound of the band was reined in. The E Street Band became a
 rock band. Only 'Meeting across the River' on Born to Run has any of 
the feel of the Sancious days.<br>
<br>
The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle became known more as 
"the album that bombed" and is rarely heralded in its own right as the 
great album that it is. Sandwiched between two records that deal with 
their subject matter in a dark monochrome, The Wild... is bursting with 
colour, characters, humour, abundant musicality and romance. It has been
 criticised for being under-produced, but that, in a way, is part of its
 charm. It would be a while before Springsteen would again be caught 
quite so off-guard, so unselfconscious.<br>
<br>
In hindsight it is unlikely that Sancious, Carter, and Lopez would ever 
have fitted in with Springsteen's subsequent musical journey. They were 
right for the time, for the moment. Looking at the photo by David Gahr 
on the back of the album it is easy to get the feel of that moment. This
 was a summer album and the band have a look on their faces that 
twenty-year-olds should have when things are going their way. When this 
interviewer showed Sancious the picture he paused and exhaled. It 
appeared that he had not seen it in forty years.<br>
<br>
DS: Well, first of all, I'm barefoot! I remember I used to go round 
barefoot in summertime. Look at Clarence, we're both barefoot. That was a
 summer thing. Gary's got clogs on, and he's kind of barefoot. Danny's 
the nicest-dressed one in this picture. He looks like he's going to have
 his photo taken for a record album. The rest of us look like somebody 
just stopped us and said, "Listen, just stand still".<br>
<br>
I remember that day... and look how dark Bruce is, he really got so dark
 in the summer. We used to tease him like he was becoming Puerto Rican. I
 mean, he got really dark, he used to tan really well. He used to surf 
back then, too. He was really into surfing. I wonder if he still does 
that. But yeah, I sure remember this picture, man. Wow.<br>
<br>
It is probable that, for Springsteen, the surfing days were over. After 
completing Born to Run, he headed out on the road again, had his picture
 simultaneously on the front cover of Time and Newsweek and became an 
international star. They still played 'New York City Serenade', only it 
never quite sounded the same. But in September 1974 Springsteen was 
still entranced by the song's indefinable quality:<br>
<br>
BS: Every time we do it a little differently. I like to do that number 
when we play. That's forever, you know, it gets that beat, it gets that 
groove going and it just goes on forever, it's just one of those songs. 
It hooks up with a rhythm and it just goes on into the night. That song 
is really special to me, I don't know why. It's hard to talk about. I 
really can't explain it.</div>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: Reborn and Running Again<br>
<br>
Harvey Kubernik, Melody Maker, 10 June 1978<br>
<br>
EVEN BEFORE the two brilliant concerts at the Spectrum earlier in the 
week, Bruce Springsteen could have been the Mayor of Philadelphia if he 
had ever decided to campaign.<br>
<br>
I arrived at the Spectrum two hours before showtime, looking for a 
burger stand and a chance to talk with ticket holders on their way to 
Springsteen's long-sold-out shows.<br>
<br>
I chatted with a guy named Dave, who works in a record and tape retail 
outlet in South Philadelphia, and explained Springsteen's drawing power 
in this Eastern city: "The first day 'Born To Run' was released it sold 
20,000 copies and another 20,000 copies the next day."<br>
<br>
Local FM station WMR first broke Springsteen five years ago when his 
Greetings From Asbury Park NJ album was issued. Bruce and his band have 
been big in this city long before the rest of the United States and the 
world.<br>
<br>
In the next few months, Springsteen and Co. will play 75 concerts before a planned trip to Europe and England in the autumn.<br>
<br>
I'll say this now: I've probably seen 2,000 concerts and club dates over
 the last 20 years. Based on the two performances I attended in this 
city by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, I would rank them right
 at the top of my all-time check list.<br>
<br>
The two-and-a-half hour programme is awesome. Springsteen keeps getting 
better with age and the E Street Band are just as arresting.<br>
<br>
When Bruce Springsteen comes to Philadelphia it's an event, not a 
concert. He played the Spectrum in 1976 and his return to this site is 
greeted with the same expectations one associates with the Rolling 
Stones, without the drugs or arrests.<br>
<br>
LAST MONTH I was walking down Santa Monica Bvld in West Hollywood, 
waiting for the light to change at the Sweetzer intersection and I 
noticed a familiar figure hoofing it down the pavement. It was Bruce 
Springsteen.<br>
<br>
We chatted for a while, talked a bit about his new album, which he was mixing in LA, and as usual he was very friendly and warm.<br>
<br>
I've seen this guy play 15 times over the last five years. From his 
legendary Troubadour club date to the cosmic Roxy stint in October 1975,
 he always dazzles.<br>
<br>
And I've got to thank Kim Fowley for taking me to my initial Springsteen
 concert in 1973 at the Ahmanson Theatre, where Clive Davis hosted the 
Week To Remember concert series.<br>
<br>
At the time Kim was writing songs for The New Riders Of The Purple Sage,
 who shared the bill with Springsteen that evening. I'll never forget 
Springsteen doing 'Wild Billy's Circus', and the CBS executive leaning 
over across the aisle and whispering to Kim: "What do ya think of this 
guy? Some of these words are from Mars."<br>
<br>
And in true Fowley tradition, Kim replied: "I wish I had his publishing on any planet."<br>
<br>
The record company employee laughed and later that night I told the 
story to Clive Davis, who treated us like royalty for the rest of the 
engagement.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's catalogue has charted very well in the US. The Hollies 
covered 'Sandy', Manfred Mann hit number one with 'Blinded By The 
Light', and Greg Kihn ('For You'), Patti Smith ('Because The Night'), 
and Robert Gordon ('Fire') have all benefited by Springsteen's songs. 
Bruce is even on the next Dictators album in a cameo role, just like 
he's on the latest Lou Reed album.<br>
<br>
The point is, Bruce Springsteen always delivers. He helps people get on 
the chart, or get back on the chart, as well as giving some of the best 
rock 'n' roll concerts available on the circuit. And he's so unassuming.<br>
<br>
Getting back to the street corner on Santa Monica Bvld. I asked him 
about the live gigs he was starting at the end of the month. "It's gonna
 be hot," he mentioned. He was modest. The gigs were as hot as Las Vegas
 in August.<br>
<br>
We parted, and I ran into him that night at the Starwood where Blondie 
were playing. He was watching with the people on the floor and not 
sitting in the reserved section upstairs.<br>
<br>
Knowing him, he probably paid to get in and didn't even bother going 
through the VIP entrance. I offered him a ride back to his hotel at 2.30
 am but he politely declined, opting to walk down the street.<br>
<br>
ANOTHER thing that impresses me about the Philadelphia Springsteen 
concerts is that everyone knows the names of all the band members. It's 
like a baseball team, where people have followed the progress of the 
players since they hit the big leagues.<br>
<br>
On stage, the band are so passionate and energetic, I sometimes think 
they are the best kept secret in showbiz. Bruce and the E Streeters use 
tools and roots from the Fifties and Sixties, but the topics and themes 
explored in the songs have such a contemporary veneer.<br>
<br>
And, unlike a lot of entertainers who mouth off in the music press about
 nationalistic zeal, this is one person who is so American that he'll 
present a real image of America which the press always hides from the 
people.<br>
<br>
A Springsteen performance is a dramatic rock 'n' roll show which one never tires of.<br>
<br>
Roy Bittan's piano work has graced Bowie's Station To Station, the Peter
 Gabriel solo album and the Meat Loaf album. Bittan is a fine piano 
player.<br>
<br>
The sound mix for a Springsteen concert is remarkable: you can hear all the piano notes without straining.<br>
<br>
After the first night, I had a chance to speak to Roy. "It's 
unbelievable playing again. Feels great. We can see the light at the end
 of the tunnel."<br>
<br>
Another impressive addition to the Springsteen sound is organist Danny 
Federici. His playing reminds me of Stevie Winwood and it's ironic to 
find out from bassist Garry Tallent that before Federici joined the 
band, they used to do a live rendition of 'Gimme Some Lovin'', the 
Spencer Davis song.<br>
<br>
Danny does very few solos in the show, but is a functional player who 
offers well-defined passages and, like the rest of the band, doesn't 
fall into the trap of egotism. This is team work on display.<br>
<br>
Danny was also quite pleased by the Philadelphia fan reaction "Bruce has
 always been popular here, even before I joined the band. He dedicated 
'For You' to the audience tonight. They have been with him from the 
start."</div>
