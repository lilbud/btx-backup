‘Bruce,’ a Springsteen Biography, by Peter Ames Carlin<br>
<br>
By DWIGHT GARNER<br>
Published: November 6, 2012<br>
<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen has been, almost from the start of his career some 40 
years ago, among the most dignified and articulate musicians in American
 pop history, a worthy heir to Woody Guthrie and Hank Williams and Elvis
 Presley and Bob Dylan, with a bit of James Brown’s showmanship thrown 
in for axle grease.<br>
<br>
By Peter Ames Carlin<br>
Illustrated. 494 pages. Touchstone. $28.<br>
<br>
So it was all the more shocking and funny when, in 1985, the cartoonist 
R. Crumb published a drawing of himself chasing a Springsteen fan with a
 club, shouting: “I hate Bruce Springsteen!! Shlockmeister!! Polluter of
 souls! Deceiver of the innocent! Pimp! Panderer! Sleazeball hustler!!”<br>
<br>
The fan he’s pursuing speaks for the reader when he yelps: “Help! Police! He’s nuts!”<br>
<br>
Mr. Crumb, who collects old-timey 78 r.p.m. jazz and blues recordings, 
isn’t a Springsteen kind of guy. Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor
 and ardent Springsteen admirer, could pop the skeletal cartoonist into 
his mouth like a kipper. But Mr. Crumb’s anti-Springsteen rant caught 
something in the air. In 1985 the Boss was at the height of his 
post-“Born in the U.S.A.” fame, and he was badly overexposed. Even Mr. 
Springsteen began to feel, he told a journalist, “Bruced out.”<br>
<br>
Among the best things about “Bruce,” a new biography of Mr. Springsteen 
by Peter Ames Carlin, is his portrait of Mr. Springsteen at this career 
crossroads. He dissolved the E Street Band — he wouldn’t record an album
 with its members again for more than 15 years, until “The Rising” in 
2002 — causing bruised feelings.<br>
<br>
He married, divorced and remarried, while almost simultaneously making 
what some consider the best of his mature albums, the heartsick and 
reverberating “Tunnel of Love” (1987). He licked psychic wounds, 
self-inflicted and otherwise.<br>
<br>
The revelations in Mr. Carlin’s biography include details about the 
decades of psychotherapy Mr. Springsteen has undergone, and the 
antidepressants he began taking in 2003. His superb run of live shows 
over the past decade seem, in retrospect, like the grooviest Celexa ads 
of all time.<br>
<br>
Mr. Carlin is a former People magazine writer and previously the author 
of biographies of Brian Wilson and Paul McCartney. His “Bruce” is the 
umpteenth Springsteen bio to come down the pike. Its special claim on 
our attention is that Mr. Springsteen has cooperated with him. This is 
the first time he’s given access to a biographer, we are told, in some 
25 years. Mr. Springsteen had no control, Mr. Carlin says, over the 
book’s contents.<br>
<br>
“Bruce” gets the bedrock story told. It appraises Mr. Springsteen’s 
lower-middle-class childhood in Freehold, N.J., and his brooding father 
who worked menial jobs. We witness the rental of a first guitar after 
Mr. Springsteen saw Elvis on “The Ed Sullivan Show.” “The first day I 
can remember lookin’ in the mirror and standin’ what I was seein’,” Mr. 
Springsteen told a Newsweek reporter in 1975, “was the day I had a 
guitar in my hand.”<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen played in Jersey Shore bands with names like The 
Castiles, Child and Steel Mill before auditioning for John Hammond at 
Columbia Records in 1972. He was in his wharf-rat phase (Mr. Carlin 
likens his beard at the time to Spanish moss) and made two word-drunk 
early LPs before breaking through with “Born to Run” in 1975. A brutal 
legal battle with his manager delayed the recording of his 1978 
masterpiece, “Darkness on the Edge of Town.”<br>
<br>
This material is well known. The Springsteen obsessive — I rate myself 
at about an 8.1 out of a possible 10 — will hunt instead for smaller, 
juicier nuggets. On this front “Bruce” delivers. We learn, for example, 
that one of Mr. Springsteen’s early bands almost played Woodstock. We 
witness Janis Joplin drooling over him that same year.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen nearly named one of his early groups, the author writes,
 the Intergalactic Pubic Band. He and his musician friends liked to play
 a cutthroat version of Monopoly for which they would add handmade cards
 to the Chance and Community Chest piles. If you drew the Race Riot! 
card, all your houses and hotels burned down.<br>
<br>
Robert De Niro stole his “You talkin’ to me?” riff in “Taxi Driver” from
 Mr. Springsteen’s stage patter. The Boss and his longtime manager, Jon 
Landau, came close to firing the drummer Max Weinberg during the 
sessions for “The River” (1980); Mr. Weinberg took drum lessons to stay 
in the band.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen originally intended to give what became his first Top 10
 single, “Hungry Heart,” to the Ramones. After Sept. 11 he was moved by 
how many of the brief profiles that ran in The New York Times under the 
heading “Portraits of Grief” mentioned his name. He reached out to many 
of those people’s families.<br>
<br>
“Bruce” doesn’t read like hagiography. Mr. Carlin lingers on the sullen 
streak in Mr. Springsteen. He sometimes treated women badly, and 
reportedly struck one of them. “His whole thing in those days,” an old 
girlfriend tells the author, “was, ‘When I want to see you, you need to 
be here, and when I don’t, you need to be gone.’ ”<br>
<br>
He could be cruel to his band members, and was said to fine staff 
members for small infractions. “I could replace any of those guys in 24 
hours,” Mr. Springsteen reportedly once said, referring to the E Street 
Band. “Except for Clarence,” he said about Clarence Clemons, his 
larger-than-life saxophonist. “Replacing Clarence would take some time.”<br>
<br>
Mr. Carlin lingers, to hilarious effect, on Mr. Springsteen’s poor diet 
as a young musician. “His idea of a meal,” one observer recalls, “was 
Ring Dings, Devil Dogs and a Pepsi.” Mr. Springsteen had, the author 
writes, “the gastronomic sophistication of a feral dog.”<br>
<br>
He lingers too on his subject’s increasingly outspoken left-leaning 
politics. He gets the following origin story: “I came home one day and 
asked my mother if we were Republican or Democrats,” Mr. Springsteen 
tells the author. “She said we were Democrats, because they’re for the 
working people.”<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen is a great American artist who deserves a great American
 biography, a book to rival those Peter Guralnick has composed about 
Elvis Presley. “Bruce” has its nice moments, and it’s far from a 
disaster, but it’s not that volume. It has a distant quality. It has no 
consistent graininess or depth of argument about, or real feeling for, 
Mr. Springsteen’s work. There’s little about his family life or 
children. His band members don’t quite come to life.<br>
<br>
Mr. Carlin strains for bad jokes. There are too many hacky sentences. We
 read about Mike Appel, Mr. Springsteen’s early manager: “He turned 
naysayers into fools and made the powerful lick his hand.” And there’s 
this about a few days Mr. Springsteen spent in Japan with his first 
wife, the actress Julianne Phillips: “It was all true love and lollipops
 in the land of the rising sun.” This book’s footnotes are whatever the 
opposite of scholarly is, many of them completely daft.<br>
<br>
Mr. Carlin gets across why Mr. Springsteen has meant so much, for so 
long, to so many people, however. He quotes a thumbnail review of 
“Darkness on the Edge of Town” that ran in Rolling Stone. It can stand 
in for my sense of this man’s career: “Springsteen aims for moon and 
stars; hits moon and stars.”</div>

<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen<br>
Human Touch<br>
<br>
By ANTHONY DECURTIS<br>
April 30, 1992</strong><br>
<br>
With his two new albums — his first in nearly five years and first as a 
declared solo artist — Bruce Springsteen completes an emotional triptych
 begun in 1987 with Tunnel of Love. On that album, "Tougher Than the 
Rest" articulates the early Springsteen code on love: Commitment is a 
triumph of the will. You make a vow, you keep it. But at the center of 
that album stand three songs — "Tunnel of Love," "Two Faces" and 
"Brilliant Disguise" — that suggest the virtual impossibility of knowing
 yourself well enough (let alone another person) to make any vow 
meaningful forever. To enter the tunnel of love is to take a night 
journey on which the definitions of your identity dissolve and you 
encounter aspects of yourself that seem profoundly foreign and 
disturbing. In short, Tunnel of Love is a study of deception — and more 
chillingly, self-deception — in matters of the heart.<br>
<br>
Human Touch (begun in 1989, completed in early 1991) and Lucky Town 
(recorded in a two-month burst shortly after Human Touch) describe the 
effort of building a realistic life after the code has been shattered, 
in Springsteen's case by an affair and a divorce. Intriguing companion 
pieces, they're Lose Your Illusion I and II.<br>
<br>
Beginning with the pulsing title track, which stands among Springsteen's
 best work, the fourteen songs on Human Touch explore the movement from 
disenchanted isolation to a willingness to risk love and its attendant 
traumas again. At first the moves are tentative, motivated more by 
loneliness — a need for "a little of that human touch" — than by love's 
golden promise or, even more remote, the prospect of actual lasting 
happiness with another human being. Also, as the bluesy "Cross My Heart"
 makes clear, the certainties of the past ("Once you cross your 
heart/You ain't ever supposed to lie") are starting to be replaced by a 
more shaded outlook: "Well you may think the world's black and white/And
 you're dirty or you're clean/You better watch out you don't 
slip/Through them spaces in between."<br>
<br>
Aptly, the introspective, self-questioning mood of Human Touch shifts 
near its midpoint with "Roll of the Dice," the most generic-sounding 
Springsteen rocker — glockenspiel and all — on either of these albums. 
With renewed energy, even optimism, the singer accepts the emotional 
dangers of love and his own failings ("I'm a thief in the house of 
love/And I can't be trusted"), stops fretting and determines to get on 
with living. The superb "Real World" then offers an inspiringly lucid 
vision of a love that can sidestep fantasy to take a dignified place in 
"the real world," and the slamming "All or Nothin' at All," graced by a 
soaring, catchy chorus, insists on commitment rather than flees it.<br>
<br>
After that, however, both "Man's Job" and "Real Man" flirt perilously 
with soft, contemporary clichés about masculinity ("If I can find the 
guts to give you all my love/Then I'll be feelin' like a real man"). 
Fortunately, Springsteen stops short of songs about his inner child or 
flagging self-esteem. The slick, annoyingly seductive keyboard riff of 
"Real Man" also ventures closer to Phil Collins territory than anything 
Springsteen has done before. More positively, "Pony Boy," a traditional 
tune performed acoustically by Springsteen on guitar and harmonica, with
 his wife, Patti Scialfa, providing harmony, closes Human Touch on a 
tender, disarming note.<br>
<br>
The childlike charm of "Pony Boy" provides an effective, understated 
transition to Lucky Town, on which Springsteen examines his life as a 
family man, negotiates a truce with his demons and achieves a hard-won 
sense of fulfillment. Dedicated to Scialfa and the couple's two 
children, the album's ten songs paint a convincing — and only rarely 
cloying — portrait of domestic life and its contents. The rousing 
opener, "Better Days," ably sets the tone; it's a bracing antinostalgia 
blast that asserts: "These are better days baby/Better days with a girl 
like you." The song also takes on with impressive candor the Springsteen
 myth ("It's a sad funny ending to find yourself pretending/A rich man 
in a poor man's shirt") and the immeasurable degree of his material 
comfort ("A life of leisure and a pirate's treasure/Don't make much for 
tragedy").<br>
<br>
With characteristic sure-footedness, however, Springsteen does not 
permit heartfelt satisfaction to slip into self-satisfaction. If "Leap 
of Faith," "If I Should Fall Behind," "Living Proof" and "Book of 
Dreams" all convey a nearly swooning appreciation of the pleasures that a
 settled home life affords, "The Big Muddy," "Souls of the Departed" and
 "My Beautiful Reward" intimate that, for Springsteen at least, the 
attainment of love is inextricable from the fear of its loss. A brooding
 blues evocatively colored by Springsteen's acoustic slide guitar, "The 
Big Muddy" takes a knowing look at infidelity, greed and moral 
compromise, concluding, "There ain't no one leavin' this world 
buddy/Without their shirttail dirty/Or their hands bloody." The 
churning, guitar-driven "Souls of the Departed" depicts the singer, one 
of "the self-made men" in the Hollywood Hills, under siege as violence 
rages in the Middle East and, closer by, in East Compton. The death of a
 child in a barrio shooting causes him to wonder, in an aching drawl, 
"Tonight as I tuck my own son in bed/All I can think of is what if it 
would've been him instead."<br>
<br>
"My Beautiful Reward," an elegant, folkish ballad, ends Lucky Town on an
 almost surreally unsettled note. The calm, gentle music belies 
dreamlike imagery of falling, wandering and abandonment. The striking 
verse that closes the song and the album — "Tonight I can feel the cold 
wind at my back/I'm flyin' high over gray fields my feathers long and 
black/Down along the river's silent edge I soar/Searching for my 
beautiful reward" — harks back to the restlessness at the heart of Human
 Touch and hints of a darkness on the edge of Lucky Town.<br>
<br>
Musically, neither of these two albums represents much of a departure 
for Springsteen, despite the breakup of the E Street Band. Produced by 
Springsteen, Jon Landau, Chuck Plotkin and former E Street Band 
keyboardist Roy Bittan, Human Touch is more richly textured than Lucky 
Town, which Springsteen recorded in his home studio and pretty much 
produced himself, with help from the other three men. Along with the 
impeccable Bittan on keyboards, the studio pros on hand for Human Touch —
 bassist Randy Jackson and drummer Jeff Porcaro — do fine; Porcaro even 
manages on occasion to approach the muscle and finesse of the brilliant E
 Street Band drummer, Max Weinberg. Springsteen handles virtually all 
instruments except drums (played by Gary Mallabar) on Lucky Town with 
expressiveness and flair; on both albums his guitar playing is plentiful
 and gripping, a cry from the soul.<br>
<br>
Without question, the aesthetic and thematic aims of Human Touch and 
Lucky Town would have been better realized by a single, more carefully 
shaped collection that eliminated their half-dozen or so least essential
 songs. But taken together, the two albums chart the fascinating 
progress of one of the most compelling artists of our time, a man who 
has found what he was looking for and who is searching still.<br>

Bruce Springsteen<br>
Greatest Hits<br>
<br>
By PARKE PUTERBAUGH<br>
April 6, 1995</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is a peerless songwriter and consummate artist whose 
every painstakingly crafted album serves as an impassioned and literate 
pulse taking of a generation's fortunes. He is the foremost live 
performer in the history of rock &amp; roll, a self-described prisoner 
of the music he loves, for whom every show is played as if it might be 
his last. Though some may argue the point, Springsteen single-handedly 
rescued rock &amp; roll from its banal post-'60s doldrums. Moreover, his
 music developed a conscience that didn't ignore the darkening of the 
runaway American dream as the country greedily blundered its way through
 the '80s.<br>
<br>
With the mighty exception of Born in the U.S.A., however — a veritable 
greatest-hits album in itself — Springsteen's standing as a singles 
artist has seemed an incidental byproduct of his main focus: arraying 
his songs in theme-driven album-length statements. For this reason, 
Greatest Hits comes across as a collection of familiar songs, each 
stellar in its own right, that somehow adds up to something less than 
the sum of its parts — even with the grafted-on bonus of four new tracks
 recorded with the E Street Band.<br>
<br>
First of all, this album is not even what it purports to be. A 
straightforward program of Springsteen's greatest hits would at least 
have had the virtue of a governing logic. Although some Bruce-smitten 
critic blessed with second sight will no doubt divine a wishful thesis 
about the "story" it tells, the simple fact is that Greatest Hits 
liberally violates its stated premise. Absent for reasons unfathomable 
are five Top 10 hits ("Cover Me," "I'm Goin' Down," "I'm on Fire," "War"
 and "Tunnel of Love"), as well as such essential charting singles as 
"Prove It All Night" (No. 33), "Fade Away" (No. 20) and "One Step Up" 
(No. 13). Also missing is anything preceding "Born to Run," which leaves
 out a big chunk of the Springsteen story. If the album's assemblers 
could find reason to include "Atlantic City," which failed to crack the 
Top 100, surely there was room for "Blinded by the Light" and "Rosalita 
(Come Out Tonight)." Those, too, rank among his greatest hits — ask 
anyone partial to FM radio or Springsteen concerts — despite the lack of
 corroboration from the charts.<br>
<br>
In the early years of his career, a whole new palette of possibilities 
emerged from Springsteen's energetic vision — a playful, swinging 
landscape in which Bob Dylan met Roy Orbison at the Jersey Shore to a 
soundtrack produced by Phil Spector. All of that seemed to sour after 
Born to Run as Springsteen simultaneously fought a bruising legal battle
 with a former manager and tasted superstardom freighted with its share 
of hype. Thereafter, he began taking ever more penetrating and 
disillusioned looks into the troubled American psyche. His melancholy 
songs were often so intimate and personal (witness Nebraska) that the E 
Street Band eventually seemed an encumbrance, though he puffed out his 
chest for tours with them after the releases of Born in the U.S.A. and 
Tunnel of Love. In hindsight, Greatest Hits documents Springsteen's 
discomfort with the spotlight, the diminishing role of the E Street Band
 in his music and his rueful view of lives disintegrating against a 
backdrop of red, white and blues. After a certain point, he didn't want 
to be the Boss anymore.<br>
<br>
By lining up a batch of Springsteen's biggest radio tracks, Greatest 
Hits unintentionally reveals a creaky, leaden quality that occasionally 
crept into the music he made in the post-Born to Run era. Plucked out of
 context, such popular hits as "Hungry Heart" and "Born in the U.S.A." 
sound stiff and muscle-bound now. The former is weighted by awkward 
lyrics ("Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack") that sentimentalize 
abandonment, the latter grinds a ponderous riff into the ground, and 
both are stamped with a metronomic snare sound that's leagues removed 
from the natural swing of the band circa The Wild, the Innocent and the E
 Street Shuffle. The notion occurs that "Better Days," featuring one of 
Springsteen's most thoughtful lyrics, would have benefited from a 
subtler vocal treatment than the histrionic growl sustained throughout. 
And spanning 20 years, isolated from the albums that gave them meaning, 
these songs don't mix particularly well, nor do they portray a 
remarkable career in a flattering or accurate light. Every album 
Springsteen has made is best heard in toto; this vivisection is largely 
for dilettantes, come-latelies and radio programmers who wouldn't delve 
deeply anyway.<br>
<br>
As for the four unreleased songs — three of them newly recorded with the
 E Street Band for this project — they sound more like a final coda than
 a new beginning. Two of them, "Secret Garden" and "Blood Brothers," are
 so restrained that the E Streeters' involvement adds nothing that 
session musicians couldn't have provided just as well with their 
competent anonymity. On "Blood Brothers," a barely electrified folk tune
 that recalls Dylan's Blood on the Tracks, Springsteen's harmonica is 
featured far more prominently than Clarence Clemons' sax or Nils 
Lofgren's guitar. The uptempo songs — "Murder Incorporated" and "This 
Hard Land" — don't restore or redefine the band members' roles in any 
way that suggests they have a future together. "Murder Incorporated" 
(originally recorded in 1982 and remixed for this album) is broad and 
bombastic enough to be a hit, while "This Hard Land" repeats some of 
Springsteen's most pronounced tics — the use of rivers, seeds and rides 
as metaphors, the contrived device of addressing his words to some 
fictional "sir." Musically it begs comparison with Woody Guthrie's 
populist folk songs.<br>
<br>
This may, in fact, be where Springsteen is headed. It wouldn't be 
surprising if, on his next travels, he walked alone with a guitar and 
harmonica for companions.<br>

Bruce Springsteen<br>
The Rising<br>
Columbia</strong><br>
<br>
By KURT LODER<br>
July 30, 2002<br>
The heart sags at the prospect of pop stars weighing in on the subject 
of September 11th. Which of them could possibly transmute the fiery 
horror of that day with the force of their art, or offer up anything 
beyond a dismal trivialization?<br>
<br>
The answer, it turns out, is Bruce Springsteen. With his new album, The 
Rising, Springsteen wades into the wreckage and pain of that horrendous 
event and emerges bearing fifteen songs that genuflect with enormous 
grace before the sorrows that drift in its wake. The small miracle of 
his accomplishment is that at no point does he give vent to the anger 
felt by so many Americans: the hunger for revenge. The music is often 
fierce in its execution, but in essence it is a requiem for those who 
perished in that sudden inferno, and those who died trying to save them.
 Springsteen grandly salutes their innocence and their courage, and 
holds out a hand to those who mourn them, who seek the comfort of an 
explanation for the inexplicable:<br>
<br>
Picture's on the nightstand, TV's on in the den<br>
Your house is waiting . . . for you to walk in<br>
But you're missing, you're missing<br>
<br>
It's wonderful to hear these finely calibrated lyrics borne aloft by the
 E Street Band, brought back at last for a record that rocks as broadly 
as Born in the U.S.A., the last studio album for which they all 
gathered, eighteen years ago. However heavy of heart the new songs may 
be, this three-guitar incarnation of the band (with Steve Van Zandt and 
Nils Lofgren standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Springsteen — never a 
slouch in the screaming-guitar department himself) propels them with 
resounding power. Like Born in the U.S.A. before it, The Rising sounds 
unlike any other record of its time; in an era of rock murk and heavy 
synthetics, it flaunts its hard, bright guitars and positively walloping
 beats.<br>
<br>
Springsteen addresses the spiritual dislocations of the World Trade 
Center attack — and the unquestioning bravery of the rescuers who lost 
their lives in it — with "Into the Fire," a song that starts out with 
the simplicity of a white-gospel hymn ("I need your kiss/But love and 
duty called you someplace higher"), then blossoms into a luminous 
anthem:<br>
<br>
May your strength give us strength<br>
May your faith give us faith<br>
May your hope give us hope<br>
May your love bring us love<br>
<br>
Elsewhere, Springsteen acknowledges the fury that welled up in many 
bereft New Yorkers after the destruction of Manhattan's two most 
towering landmarks: "I want a kiss from your lips/I want an eye for an 
eye/I woke up this morning to an empty sky." And in the lush, haunted 
ballad "Nothing Man," he seems to give voice to the emptiness and 
incomprehension felt by some of that day's surviving heroes:<br>
<br>
I never thought I'd live to read about myself<br>
In my hometown paper<br>
How my brave young life was forever changed<br>
In a misty cloud of pink vapor<br>
<br>
Not every song on the album was written in the wake of September 11th: 
"Waitin' on a Sunny Day," for example, with its big, meaty riff and 
strutting lyrics. "Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin)," with its entirely 
unexpected beach-beat bounce, wouldn't seem at first listen to fit in 
here. But every song on the album is unified, to an extent, by a mood of
 romantic longing and a yearning for human connection. In the end, they 
all flow together.<br>
<br>
As with Born in the U.S.A., the title of this album may mislead some who
 hear it, particularly those intent on retaliation, which Springsteen 
himself shows little interest in contemplating. His concern is not with a
 national uprising but with a rising above: the transcending of 
ever-mounting losses and ancient hatreds.<br>
<br>
His most inspired gesture comes in "Worlds Apart," a track that writhes 
with the sounds of qawwali, the intense, God-conjuring, life-affirming 
vocal music of the mystical Sufi sect of Islam — a branch of the faith 
much detested (and often suppressed) by death-trumpeting fundamentalist 
imams. Hearing ecstatic qawwali ululations underpinning a song in which 
Springsteen sings "May the living let us in/Before the dead tear us 
apart" is a truly soul-stirring experience.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen has gathered many a superlative over the years. His 
most resonant works stand as milestones in the lives of millions of 
fans. Even for him, though, The Rising, with its bold thematic 
concentration and penetrating emotional focus, is a singular triumph. I 
can't think of another album in which such an abundance of great songs 
might be said to seem the least of its achievements.<br>

Devils and Dust <br>
<br>
By DAVID FRICKE<br>
May 5, 2005</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen's thirteenth studio album is, in many ways, his most 
conventional singer-songwriter record since his 1973 debut, Greetings 
From Asbury Park, N.J. Devils and Dust is twelve songs of assorted 
vintage and narrative setting, rendered with a subdued, mostly acoustic 
flair that smells of wood smoke and sparkles in the right places like 
stars in a clear Plains sky. There is no connected, redemptive urgency 
to these stories; this is not The Rising. And there is no E Street Band 
to turn Springsteen's trademark compulsion to save and be saved into 
fireball baptism: You get Steve Jordan on drums, producer Brendan 
O'Brien on bass and Springsteen on almost everything else, with his 
wife, singer Patti Scialfa, and E Street violinist Soozie Tyrell making 
brush-stroke appearances.<br>
<br>
Yet Devils and Dust is, in striking and affecting ways, also 
Springsteen's most audacious record since the home-demo American Gothic 
of 1982's Nebraska. It opens with mortal sin — the title song, a 
sand-caked letter home from a war where both sides kill in God's name — 
and ends in death: "Matamoros Banks," a prayer for remembrance by an 
illegal immigrant who doesn't make it across the Rio Grande. With its 
tender fingerpicking, singing-wire curls of dobro and soft, billowing 
orchestration, "Reno" floats like a night breeze through an open bedroom
 window. But the sex inside is adulterous and graphic, and it costs: " 
'Two hundred dollars straight in/Two-fifty up the ass,' she smiled and 
said."<br>
<br>
In the next song, "Long Time Comin'," Springsteen uses the word "fuck" 
for the first time on record, in the sense of swearing never to screw up
 again. There is no apology, though, in "The Hitter": A fallen boxer 
frankly recalls the brutality of a life in which a man is paid to all 
but murder other men for entertainment. Springsteen first played the 
song in his 1995-1997 solo acoustic shows; he sings it here with a 
vivid, craggy exhaustion. The knockout punch actually comes in the first
 verse — the palooka is confessing to his mother. After that, it's all 
blood, shards of bone and universal guilt: "Understand, in the end, Ma, 
every man plays the game/ If you know one different, then speak out his 
name."<br>
<br>
"The Hitter" is one of several songs on Devils and Dust that Springsteen
 wrote almost a decade ago, in a concentrated burst of inspiration as he
 toured behind the spectral-country song cycle, 1995's The Ghost of Tom 
Joad. He reprises the dust-bowl topography and marooned spirits of that 
album with moving results. In "Long Time Comin'," a rustic sprint lit 
with square-dance fiddle and pearly steel guitar, a father prays for his
 children as the family sleeps rough, under "the sword of Orion": "If I 
had one wish in this Godforsaken world, kids/It'd be that your mistakes 
would be your own."<br>
<br>
But Devils and Dust is also as immediate and troubling as this morning's
 paper. These people are our neighbors, and these worries are 
Springsteen's, too. He wrote the title song in 2003, after the start of 
the Iraq War, and it shows. His cracked, vocal agony when he looks his 
God in the eye ("I've got my finger on the trigger/And tonight faith 
just ain't enough") is as old as Stephen Crane and as fresh as Fallujah.
 "All the Way Home," in contrast, is much older than it seems, predating
 Springsteen's plunge into party politics last fall with the Vote for 
Change Tour. But he steps into the first lines — "I know what it's like 
to have failed, baby/With the whole world lookin' on" — with the 
grizzled force of experience. The specific echoes of the Rolling Stones'
 "Street Fighting Man" — the bees-army buzz of sitar and tamboura 
coating the rolling twang — are no accident either.<br>
<br>
There are times, like Springsteen's outbreak of whispered falsetto in 
the campfire rockabilly of "All I'm Thinkin' About," when you can't help
 waiting for the E Street payoff that never comes. But many of 
Springsteen's best songs, going back to "Born to Run," are about the 
salvation just out of reach, around the next curve and over the next 
hill — and what it takes to get there. The rewards are often slender 
here, when they come at all. Still, the promise never fades. "These days
 I don't stand on pride/ And I ain't afraid to take a fall," Springsteen
 sings with gravelly swagger in "All the Way Home" — like a guy already 
back on his feet.<br>
<br>

Bruce Springsteen<br>
Magic<br>
<br>
By DAVID FRICKE<br>
October 18, 2007</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen's first album of original songs with the E Street Band
 since he lost the vote for change in 2004 starts with guitars — a wall 
of angry, droning treble that, for the three minutes of "Radio Nowhere,"
 is blessedly louder than the oceanic static of bent truths, partisan 
reporting and general bullshit that passes for life-and-death debate in 
the new wired order. Springsteen isn't just pissed about the state of 
rock &amp; roll radio — that's like kicking a corpse — although he is 
blunt about what's missing. "A thousand guitars . . . pounding drums," 
he demands against the racing squall of his band. But "Radio Nowhere" is
 actually about how we speak and listen to each other through the murk —
 "Is there anybody alive out there?" he growls, over and over — and how a
 firm beat, some Telecaster sting and the robust peal of Clarence 
Clemons' saxophone can still tell you more about the human condition 
than a thousand op-ed words.<br>
<br>
Magic is, in one way, the most openly nostalgic record Springsteen has 
ever made. The arrangements, the performances and Brendan O'Brien's 
wall-of-surf production are mined with echoes and near-direct quotes of 
classic records, including Springsteen's: the early-Sixties beach-radio 
bounce of "Girls in Their Summer Clothes" the overcast-Pet Sounds 
orchestration of "Your Own Worst Enemy" the "Jungleland" ring of Roy 
Bittan's piano rainfall in "I'll Work for Your Love." "You'll Be Comin' 
Down" sounds like it strutted over from The Wild, the Innocent and the E
 Street Shuffle. "Livin' in the Future" is "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" 
with a new, thick coat of twang and a full tank of lust. After wrapping 
himself in a thousand fiddles on The Seeger Sessions, Springsteen has 
rediscovered the boardwalk-dance-party power of Born to Run and the 
Mitch Ryder and Jackie DeShannon encore covers in his 1975 and '78 
shows.<br>
<br>
But Springsteen's songwriting here is also intricately wired with 
outrage and disbelief. The pain, courage and genuine love of country 
that he saw and felt after 9/11 and put to song with the E Street Band 
on The Rising have gone up in flames and betrayal. He makes no direct 
references to Iraq, Bush or the so-called Patriot Act. He doesn't need 
them. The pared metaphors and straight talk carry the weight and body 
count. Like "Born in the U.S.A.," "Gypsy Biker" is the sober homecoming 
of a war veteran with images of anxious preparation ("We pulled your 
cycle out of the garage/And polished up the chrome") and wasted effort 
("The speculators made their money on the blood you shed"). Except this 
time, the soldier is returning in a coffin, and the devastated singer is
 numb with grief, mourning over lines of cocaine. "Last to Die" takes 
off like "Thunder Road," but into a darkness of unknown depth. "Who will
 be the last to die for a mistake?" Springsteen sings, gripping the 
wheel and marking the miles in fires and martyrs from both sides of the 
road. And the title song, a skeleton dance of acoustic guitar and 
cimbalom, is a catalog of tricks, not magic. At the end, Springsteen 
adds up the high price of White House snake oil in a voice strained with
 exhaustion: "There's bodies hangin' in the trees/This is what will be, 
this is what will be."<br>
<br>
If we let it. Even when he was gunning Chevys in his old turnpike songs,
 Springsteen never wrote merely about escape. "Growin' Up," "Rosalita 
(Come Out Tonight)" and "Backstreets" were about choices, the work of 
freedom. The same goes for Magic and its vintage Stone Pony-a-go-go. 
Only the stakes are even higher. In "Long Walk Home," a muscular update 
of "My Hometown," a father tells his son, about to ship out, the true 
meaning of national service and sacrifice: "You know that flag/Flying 
over the courthouse/Means certain things are set in stone/Who we are, 
what we'll do/And what we won't." We only know who dies last for a 
mistake when we all stand up and say, "Enough."<br>
<br>

W<strong class="text-strong">orking on a Dream<br>
<br>
By BRIAN HIATT<br>
January 21, 2009</strong><br>
<br>
To understand the romantic sweep and swaggering musical ambition that 
define Bruce Springsteen's first album of the Obama era, you have to go 
all the way back to an artifact of the Ford administration: 1975's Born 
to Run. In those days, Springsteen was driving the E Street Band without
 a seat belt, staying up all night piling on overdubs: glockenspiel, 
surf guitar, violins, motorcycle noises. With a few exceptions, he's 
been paring down ever since. But on much of Working on a Dream, 
Springsteen finally reignites his early infatuation with the pop 
symphonies of Roy Orbison and Phil Spector. It's all there from the 
first track, an eight-minute-long, tragicomic Old West fable called 
"Outlaw Pete," where he does everything short of dragging an actual 
horse into the studio: There are tempo changes, chugging cellos, Once 
Upon a Time in the West harmonica wails, massed strings, crescendo after
 crescendo — and a lyrical closing guitar solo worthy of "Jungleland."<br>
<br>
Working on a Dream is the richest of the three great rock albums 
Springsteen has made this decade with the E Street Band — and moment for
 moment, song for song, there are more musical surprises than on any 
Bruce album you could name, from the Chess Records vocal distortion on 
the bluesy "Good Eye" to the joyous British Invasion pep of "Surprise, 
Surprise." Producer Brendan O'Brien seems to have shaken something loose
 in Springsteen, who by the Nineties was so focused on his 
ever-more-novelistic lyrics that melodies and chord changes could feel 
like an afterthought. On their last collaboration, 2007's Magic, 
Springsteen suddenly started writing lush, retro-pop tunes with 
inventive arrangements ("Girls in Their Summer Clothes" and "Your Own 
Worst Enemy") — and singing out in an unexpectedly rich, open voice, one
 that for the first time in decades owed more to Orbison than latter-day
 influences Hank Williams and Woody Guthrie.<br>
<br>
Working picks up where those Magic tunes left off, and then goes 
further. As much as anyone, Springsteen has mastered the key sounds of 
rock's golden age, and he deploys them at will on this album, diving 
deep into influences that he's only hinted at before on record. At least
 two tracks lean hard on the Byrds — the jagged, sitarlike guitars on 
"Life Itself" are pure "Eight Miles High," as are the close vocal 
harmonies on the tough little rocker "What Love Can Do." The twisted pop
 fantasia "Queen of the Supermarket" — the lonely narrator has an 
overblown obsession with a checkout girl — has a Sixties AM-radio vibe 
reminiscent of Manfred Mann's "Pretty Flamingo." And the dreamy, stacked
 backing vocals on the celestial love tune "This Life" owe as much to 
the Turtles as they do to Spector.<br>
<br>
For all the overdubs on this album, the uptempo songs have a bracing, 
first-take feel, capturing the E Street Band's elusive live essence — 
Springsteen's freewheeling Seeger Sessions album may have helped bring 
that out. Roy Bittan's deliberately sloppy roadhouse piano and Max 
Weinberg's splattering cymbals make the standout "My Lucky Day" sound 
like Exile on E Street, with Springsteen and Steven Van Zandt sharing 
the chorus Mick-and-Keith-style. Springsteen has had trouble writing 
happy-relationship songs that rock (see Human Touch and Lucky Town), but
 he nails it on "My Lucky Day," which is as much fun as his best 
Eighties hits.<br>
<br>
The youthful energy of the album's music collides neatly with the 
all-too-adult truths of the lyrics, which — at least on the surface — 
return to the personal and domestic, after the global sweep of his last 
few records. The sunny title track is a rare and timely moment of 
unabashed optimism, and there are some of Springsteen's least 
conflicted, most devotional love songs here. But even the title 
character of "Outlaw Pete" can achieve no more than temporary 
redemption, and Springsteen wonders on several songs how we can hold on 
to our attachments — and the best parts of ourselves — in the face of 
"the burdens of the day . . . the weary hands of time." Some of those 
tunes recount rough patches in a relationship that could stand in for 
larger, national issues: "Why do the things we treasure most slip away 
in time/Till to the music we grow deaf and to God's beauty blind," 
Springsteen sings on the disquieting "Life Itself," which builds tension
 with claustrophobic rhythms anchored by Garry Tallent's droning bass. 
"Why do the things that connect us slowly pull us apart?"<br>
<br>
If you don't count the soundtrack tune "The Wrestler," tacked on as a 
bonus cut, the album ends with "The Last Carnival," a plain-spoken, 
heart-rending elegy for E Street Band organ player Danny Federici, who 
died of cancer last year. The tune doubles as a sequel to Springsteen's 
beloved 1973 song "Wild Billy's Circus Story," in which the romance of 
the circus stood for life on the road — here, the circus is moving on 
without Billy. "Sundown, sundown/They're taking all the tents down," 
Springsteen sings in a choked hush, at the bottom of his range. "Where 
have you gone, my handsome Billy?" The song ends with a choir of what 
sounds like Springsteen's and Patti Scialfa's layered voices, vaulting 
up to infinity: For a fallen comrade, it's one last opera out on the 
turnpike.<br>

Bruce Springsteen<br>
Wrecking Ball<br>
<br>
By DAVID FRICKE<br>
March 6, 2012</strong><br>
<br>
Wrecking Ball is the most despairing, confrontational and musically 
turbulent album Bruce Springsteen has ever made. He is angry and 
accusing in these songs, to the point of exhaustion, with grave reason. 
The America here is a scorched earth: razed by profiteers, and suffering
 a shameful erosion in truly democratic values and national charity. The
 surrender running through the chain-gang march and Springsteen's 
muddy-river growl in "Shackled and Drawn"; the double meaning loaded 
into the ballad "This Depression"; the reproach driving "We Take Care of
 Our Own," a song so obviously about abandoned ideals and mutual blame 
that no candidate would dare touch it: This is darkness gone way past 
the edge of town, to the heart of the republic.<br>
<br>
Springsteen has been here before, a lot. He drew from his own father's 
working life for the numbed spirits on the assembly line in 1978's 
"Factory." But the diminished dreams haunting The River and the cycles 
of hunger and violence in "The Ghost of Tom Joad" always came with 
light: a stubborn faith in American honor and our beter natures. Even 
The Rising, Springsteen's response to the crushing anguish and moral 
challenges of 9/11, was written and played to heal and unify, a 
masterful balance of mourning and the guitar-army backbone of the E 
Street Band.<br>
<br>
On Wrecking Ball, Springsteen throws nuance to the curb. "Death to My 
Hometown" is an obvious allusion to the battered nostalgia of "My 
Hometown," on 1984's Born in the U.S.A. But even the vacant storefronts 
in the latter song are gone now; the place has been flattened. "I never 
heard a sound/The marauders raided in the dark/And brought death to my 
hometown," Springsteen sings, a blunt indictment of cold greed and 
congressional impotence. And he delivers it like delicious revenge, with
 a robust Irish-wake rhythm and noble-warrior glaze: a sample from a 
1959 Alan Lomax recording of the Alabama Sacred Harp Singers. The effect
 is a dance through ashes with a reminder: In a righteous fight, music 
is still good ammo. "They'll be returning sure as the rising sun," 
Springsteen warns. "Get yourself a song to sing.... Sing it hard and 
sing it well/Send the robber barons straight to hell." It's Woody 
Guthrie in this foreclosure era with a new sticker on his guitar: THIS 
MACHINE KILLS GIANT VAMPIRE SQUID.<br>
<br>
Wrecking Ball is Springsteen's first album of new songs without the 
full, disciplined fire of his E Street Band since 2005's Devils &amp; 
Dust. It is his first, too, with a new co-producer, Ron Aniello, whose 
more pop-oriented credits include a 2007 solo album by Springsteen's 
wife and E Street vocalist, Patti Scialfa. Springsteen gives a pair of 
prominent guitar solos to fellow traveler Tom Morello of Rage Against 
the Machine, including the high, warming cries that counter the 
heartsickness in "My Depression." But for the most part, Springsteen and
 Aniello are their own basic-track combo: working with loops lathered in
 thick, wet echo, playing many of the instruments themselves before 
laying on the strings, folk-jubilee accordion, pealing brass and choral 
voices.<br>
<br>
The effect is a manic, compelling seesaw between intimacy and blowout, 
anguish and uplift, that echoes the emotional zigzags and hair-trigger 
temper in the songwriting. "The blood on our hands will come back to us 
twice," Springsteen laments in the sufferer's hymn "Rocky Ground," over a
 hip-hop tension with storefront-chapel choruses. He is also ready to 
brawl. "C'mon and take your best shot/Let me see what you got," 
Springsteen taunts in "Wrecking Ball," a song he debuted live in 2009 as
 a goodbye to the old Giants Stadium but repurposes here as a battle of 
wills ("Hold tight to your anger/And don't fall to your fears") with 
big-band charge and Jersey-hardass swagger.<br>
<br>
Actually, for an election year, Wrecking Ball is a boldly apolitical 
record. The basic premise is that the true business of politics – 
responsible governing, a commerce of shared rewards – is broken, with 
plenty of guilt to go around. It may be a sign of how hard optimism is 
to come by that Springsteen covers himself here – reviving "Land of Hope
 and Dreams," originally released on 2001's Live in New York City – to 
insist all is not lost. He makes a glorious case. The new arrangement is
 Phil Spector gone to church with help from Curtis Mayfield. You get 
resurrection, too. The late Clarence Clemons is featured on saxophone, a
 beautiful extension of his life with Springsteen.<br>
<br>
But Springsteen's most gripping new song on Wrecking Ball is the one 
that ends in the worst kind of frustration. In the weighed-down moan and
 slow-walk piano of "Jack of All Trades," Springsteen plays a guy from 
the new permalance working class, skilled and drifting, with no 
benefits, security or, by the end, patience. "If I had me a gun, I'd 
find the bastards and shoot 'em on sight," he swears between Morello's 
strafing bursts of guitar. Because there is no such thing as free 
enterprise. Someone, usually at the bottom of the chain, pays for that 
share price. And someday, that stone may demand blood in return.</div>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: It's Sign Up a Genius Month<br>
"When our band goes to a Holiday Inn, we step up in the world," says Springsteen<br>
   <br>
April 26, 1973<br>
<br>
NEW YORK — It's more than a decade since John Hammond Sr. of Columbia 
Records signed Bob Dylan to a recording contract. Since then, Hammond 
has signed a number of other successes and, by his own admission, a 
number of "stiffs." Now he has signed Bruce Springsteen, 23, of Ashbury 
Park, New Jersey, and Hammond says: "He's much further along, much more 
developed than Bobby was when he came to me."<br>
<br>
Much about Springsteen reminds people of Dylan — the slept-in 
appearance, foggy manner, the twang, the lyrics and the phrasing of his 
songs. It seems only natural that Hammond should have signed him. But to
 Bruce ". . . it was just plain weird.<br>
<br>
"I mean a couple of weeks ago I had just finished reading Dylan's 
biography and now I find myself sitting in Hammond's office with my 
beat-up guitar, and like the whole thing I've been reading about is 
about to happen to me. But what Mike was doing was even weirder."<br>
<br>
<br>
Mike is Mike Appel, who with Jim Cretecos manages and produces Bruce. 
Appel and Cretecos' previous teamwork includes the creation of a couple 
of gold singles for the Partridge Family. For Springsteen, the 
managerial strategy is to ". . . start at the top and work down."<br>
<br>
"Mike is a funny guy," said Bruce. "He's like a real hyper, and he gets 
into the whole thing like playing the role. So I'm sitting in the corner
 with my old beat-up guitar, when all of a sudden Mike jumps up and 
starts hyping John Hammond. I couldn't believe it. I had to start 
laughing. John Hammond told me later that he was ready to hate me. But 
he asked me to do a song, so I did 'It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City.<br>
<br>
Despite the hype, Hammond signed him and Bruce moved from his free 
wheelin' stage into phase two — exploitation. It worked like this:<br>
<br>
A member of the press would get a phone call from the publicity 
department at Columbia and be told he would receive an advance copy of a
 record by a new artist (not unusual), and after he had a chance to 
listen to it, President Clive Davis would appreciate a call to get his 
reaction (highly unusual).<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, visitors to the CBS Building encountered publicity personnel 
and suited executives alike greeting people with the question, "Hi . . .
 have you heard Bruce Springsteen yet?"<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is admittedly surprised by all the attention, but is 
showing no signs of stress. "Well, shit man, you know, what do I care, 
I'll do anything once. If it works it works. But I don't wanna be 
concerned with too much of what's going on with promotion. That don't 
seem so important to me, but it's important to Mike. I trust whatever he
 does. Anyway it never seemed like I had it that bad before," he 
laughed.<br>
<br>
"I'll admit it seems a little weird the way these record company dudes 
operate. Seems like one dude says 'hey everybody's signing up geniuses 
this month. Genius is going to be good for business, we better lock one 
up fast.' But as I say, I'll do anything. I mean I have nothing else to 
do. I have nothing else to do at all."<br>
<br>
Bruce was 13 when his hometown cousin in Freehold, New Jersey, showed 
him how to make the same music on the guitar that the Beachboys, the 
Shirells, Gary (US) Bonds, the Chiffons, and his other favorites were 
making on the radio. That was enough to alter his fantasy of becoming a 
baseball player to a fantasy of becoming a rock &amp; roll star.<br>
<br>
The new fantasy stuck, and long after his cousin had gone on to a 
non-musical career at Freehold Raceway, Bruce continued to do nothing 
but play music.<br>
<br>
"Well, actually, I did work as a gardener once, but that didn't last too
 long, even though I guess it was the only real job I ever had. I did go
 to college once, too. Ocean County Community College. But one day I got
 called into the nuttiedoctor's office, and remember this was before a 
lot of people were getting weird . . . . The shrink asked me what was 
the matter. So I told him nothing could possibly be the matter getting 
to hang around a fine place like that campus. But then he told me that 
students had been complaining about me. That's what the dude said. Well I
 figured there was no use hanging around there so I split."<br>
<br>
Bruce's musical career has not been interrupted since. A brief army 
physical cleared him of military duty, "for reasons of weirdness," and 
left him free to play bars and weddings, fronting for various groups, 
the most successful being a "Humble Pie-type band" called Steel Mill, 
which stayed together for a couple of years building a reputation in New
 Jersey, and the least successful being Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom, 
which featured everybody he knew who could play an instrument.<br>
<br>
Dr. Zoom died after only a couple of booms, which left Bruce to form the
 (ten-piece) Bruce Springsteen Band, which was more successful, but not 
by much. At 21, Bruce unplugged and set out on a solo acoustic career.<br>
<br>
His present band of brilliant unknowns was put together here and there 
at bars Bruce was playing. And now, by his own account, they're living 
high off the hog. "When our band goes into a Holiday Inn we step up in 
the world. The beds are nice. They got color TV. I love those places. 
When we go there we know we're gonna eat good and have a good time. I 
can't understand why those places get such a bum rap."<br>
<br>
Bruce's only national exposure so far came via recording of his live 
performance broadcast over 53 FM stations as part of the debut of the 
King Biscuit Flower Hour.<br>
<br>
His recent week's appearance at Max's Kansas City, however, created 
quite the scene in the Big Apple. The house was packed by the time he 
walked on stage each night. People were crammed on each other's laps. 
His sets ran close to an hour followed by an impatient demand for an 
encore, which, because of time, and because he was playing second bill 
to Biff Rose, he could not fullfill.<br>
<br>
Onstage, he projected a dirty sexual energy that rivaled the best of the
 established stars with whom he has been compared (Robbie Robertson, 
Richie Havens, Van Morrison), coupled with a loose, cavalier attitude.<br>
<br>
A number of distinguished guests not previously known to venture so far 
downtown showed up at Max's, including Mrs. Ted Kennedy. "Yeah they told
 me Mrs. Kennedy was out there," Bruce said. "But I found that hard to 
believe. I mean, I had to ask myself, what would she be out there for?"<br>

<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen: reaffirmed the remarkable bond between him and his fans <br>
by David Cheal<br>
October  22 2002<br>
The Daily Telegraph</strong><br>
<br>
Is there any sound in popular music that is more exhilarating, more 
joyful, more uplifting, more life-affirming than that of Bruce 
Springsteen and the E Street Band in full flight? I don't think so.<br>
Having been one of the lucky witnesses of this, the only UK date on 
Springsteen's tour of Europe, I feel able to reiterate what has been 
said so many times by so many people (and by me): that when it comes to 
live performance, no one can touch Bruce and his buddies.<br>
They played their hearts out, sang their hearts out, gave their all, the
 band producing a triumphant display of ensemble musicianship while 
Bruce reaffirmed the remarkable bond that exists between him and his 
fans. In short, it was sensational.<br>
Apart from all the usual things that make a night with Bruce Springsteen
 so memorable - the drama, the passion, the noise from the crowd, the 
almost palpable waves of affection that cascaded on to the stage, Born 
to Run, Badlands, Thunder Road, Clarence Clemons's saxophone solos - 
what was remarkable about this show was that so many of the songs from 
his recent The Rising album fitted so comfortably into the scheme of 
things; the redemptive Waitin' on a Sunny Day and the exuberant Mary's 
Place, for instance, had the fans singing along as if they had been part
 of his repertoire for decades.<br>
The addition of a violinist, meanwhile, gave the music an extra 
dimension, a note of plangency floating above the exquisitely warm, 
rich, bright wall of sound being produced by the rest of the band.<br>
As for Bruce himself, I doubt there has ever been a more authentic, 
emotionally honest performer. From the very first song, the title track 
from the new album, he was possessed by the spirit of music, his face 
contorted with emotion, his voice crackling (but not cracking), his 
sinews straining.<br>
At its best, live music can make you feel that you have been on a 
journey, and Bruce took us on an epic trip lasting almost three hours, 
from the sombre depths of September 11-inspired songs such as Into the 
Fire and the militant "prayer for peace", Born in the USA, to the 
unfettered, reckless joy of Born to Run. And at the end of this 
cynicism-stripping journey, when many of us would have been happy to go 
round again, he said just the words we wanted to hear: "See you in 
springtime."</div>

FINDING GRACE IN THE CONCERT HALL COMMUNITY AND MEANING AMONG SPRINGSTEEN FANS<br>
<br>
Thesis under the direction of Lynn S. Neal, Ph. D. Professor of Religion</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen’s music and performances have provided an emotional 
outlet for thousands of fans all over the world. Using the statements of
 these fans, as well as the life and music of Springsteen, this paper 
documents the reasons why, as well as the ways in which fans are 
inspired to create a community. This community reflects both their 
emotional and spiritual attachment as well as their attempts to live 
according to the moral precepts they find through this music. 
Springsteen himself has laid the groundwork for this community through 
his words, music, and deeds. To many, these feelings and values are as 
valid and alive as any other spiritual tradition, and are a legitimate 
spiritual outlet.<br>
The thoughts and actions of these fans, and the motivating forces behind
 them, allow a glimpse into how nontraditional spiritual values can be 
formed and acted on outside the gates of what is normally seen as 
conventional church-going behavior. By acknowledging the legitimacy of 
personal spiritual connection outside a sectarian landscape, it is hoped
 that appreciation and tolerance for different belief systems and system
 formations can be cultivated and nourished.<br>
v<br>
INTRODUCTION Joining the Church of Bruce and the Ministry of Rock ‘n Roll<br>
“May your faith give us faith, may your hope give us hope...”<br>
(Into the Fire, 2002) Living in Upstate New York in 1999, I was already a
 card-carrying member of AARP, and far removed from the rockin’ and 
rollin’ days of my youth, when I could spend days on end listening and 
dancing to rock music. But one blustery winter’s day while walking down 
Main Street something caught my eye. The poster in the music store 
window was advertising tickets for Bruce Springsteen and the E Street 
Band’s first show together in fourteen years. Seeing this, I remembered 
that moment twenty four years before when I first ‘discovered’ Bruce, as
 his fans familiarly refer to him. The album was Born to Run, and the 
poetry and imagery had overwhelmed me with its emotion and 
understanding. But life moves on, babies are born, and life and locale 
changes. After seeing him in concert once in 1975, I gave little thought
 to either the man or the music over the course of the next two decades.
 Life got in the way as it always does, and the demands of job, home and
 family, as well as living in remote areas of the country where rock 
artists did not tend to tour, superseded concert attendance. Thirty plus
 years went by like a fading memory. But something pulled at me when I 
saw this poster, and I decided to buy tickets and go eventhough I had 
long since given up attending rock concerts. I dutifully lined up at the
 appointed ticket-buying time and waited in line with thirty or so other
 people that morning to get my two ducats to the show – no mean feat as I
 later<br>
came to realize.<br>
1<br>
Three months later I found myself in an arena with many thousands of 
other fans, with a dawning realization that I was a novice among 
acolytes. In spite of the fact that Bruce had not toured with this band 
in fourteen years, everyone seemed to know all the songs, participating 
as a group in a display of gestures and call-and-response to the 
performance. The anthropologically-inclined side of me saw this as 
‘interesting’ while the emotionally hungry side felt the meaning and 
emotion in the building. Something was happening here. I was overwhelmed
 and nearly speechless by Mr. Springsteen’s performance as well as the 
lyrical content of his songs. I passed the three hours enthusiastically 
and then headed home, dodging the deer on the interstate and mulling 
over every nuance of the evening..<br>
I spent some time reflecting about the emotions that the concert evoked 
within me, and came to no real conclusions other than the rather trite 
‘music is the universal language’ kind of thing. Some time shortly after
 this show, I read that Springsteen and company were playing a show in 
Charlotte, North Carolina. I had a friend who lived in North Carolina, 
and so I called her and asked her to get us tickets for the event. She 
and I went, and again, I experienced a sense of wonder at the amount of 
emotion that flooded me, emotion that I at first wrote off as contagious
 enthusiasm. In fact, only one other ‘public’ experience in my life even
 came close to resembling my Springsteen experience, and that was a 
Billy Graham Crusade I attended as a young teen. Springsteen’s music and
 words spoke to me, to some inner longing, as much as Billy Graham had 
some forty years earlier, and this was both intriguing and mystifying. I
 had never been a ‘joiner,’ never been really passionate about anything.
 I listened to this man sing:<br>
“I believe in the love that you gave me, I believe in the faith that can save me,<br>
2<br>
I believe in the hope and I pray That someday it may raise me Above these badlands...<br>
For the ones who had a notion, a notion deep inside That it ain’t no sin to be glad you’re alive” (Badlands, 1978)<br>
I felt some emotional cog slip into place feeling a part of something 
bigger than myself, something bigger than that room with 18,000 people 
in it, but something that included all of us there. How do you put a 
name to this feeling, to this communion? This man was singing to the 
audience, not at them; the audience was the “you” in the song. Bruce was
 singing our shared experiences and emotions, creating a common frame of
 reference that was inclusive of all of us in the arena. Yes, he told us
 in song, I have felt that despair, but look! There’s hope here too... I
 found myself suddenly seeing the audience as comrades, fellow travelers
 on this rocky road called life. “No retreat, baby, no surrender” (No 
Surrender 1986). Without ever having exchanged a word with another fan, I
 knew we were sharing something meaningful and potent even if I could 
not name that feeling.<br>
And I felt just as surely that the man singing on stage was being not 
only honest and straight-forward, but also completely sincere and 
earnest. After this show I began to comb the internet to see what I 
could find out about the man Bruce Springsteen, to verify the 
impressions I felt. I wanted to know why he gave me hope, and if this 
was something others felt, or if I was suffering from some sort of 
mid-life crisis of faith, or simply slipping into early-onset dementia. 
It was during this process that I began to have some idea of the 
vastness and depth of the Springsteen community. I discovered websites 
where one could obtain unofficial copies of live concerts (“not for sale
 – trade only”), get<br>
3<br>
advance notification of ticket sales for shows, buy or sell tickets 
(“face value only”), discuss my favorite song or the quality of my day, 
and even find a brownie recipe (“use miniature marshmallows ONLY”). Here
 were people who were sharing their lives, in varying degrees, with each
 other on the basis of nothing more tangible than an interest in a 
musician. I was as welcome in this community as in any church 
congregation of which I had ever been a part.<br>
“Come on up for The Rising...”	The journey continues...<br>
(The Rising, 2002) The September 11, 2001 tragedy may eventually claim to be the inspiration for<br>
any number of urban myths; Springsteen can make claim to one of those. 
Legend claims that: “A few days after 11 September, Bruce Springsteen 
was pulling out of a beach parking lot in the Jersey Shore town of Sea 
Bright when a fan rode by. The man rolled down his window, shouted ‘We 
need you!’ and drove on. It was the kind of moment, Springsteen says, 
that made his career worthwhile. ‘That’s part of my job. It’s an honour 
to find that place in the audience’s life 
(themorningnews.org/archives/opinions/i_ 
Know_youre_lonely_for_words_that_i_aint_spoken.php). And I thought, 
well, I've probably been a part of this guy's life for a while, and 
people wanna see other people they know, they wanna be around things 
they're familiar with. So he may need to see me right about now. That 
made me sense, like, 'Oh, I have a job to do.'” (Binelli 2002: 64 ). 
Shortly after, Springsteen performed on the televised “A Tribute to 
Heroes,” the first of many benefits held to raise money for the 
survivors of that day, singing “My City of Ruins,” a song written about 
Asbury Park, but eerily fitting for the occasion.<br>
4<br>
The album The Rising was recorded and released and a promotional world 
tour commenced before the first anniversary of this tragedy. This 
collection of songs focused not on revenge or blind patriotism, but on 
healing the wounds the September 11th attack had left. I found out about
 the tour through the internet sites I had begun to visit, and made 
plans to again attend the Albany, NY show. This time, however, I could 
enlist no one to go with me, and so went alone. To this point in my 
life, I had never attended a concert or theatrical performance alone; 
this was new territory for me. Yet, I went unhesitatingly because I 
wanted to see if that first rush of emotion and feeling I felt in Albany
 could be duplicated, or if it was a fluke; perhaps I had merely been 
caught up in the moment, perhaps it was a singular experience not able 
to be replicated. In the intervening months, I would come to question 
what I had felt, and I needed to test my feelings.<br>
This proved to be a terrific and transforming experience for me. And 
that is what it truly was – an experience - so much more than a rock ’n’
 roll concert. My initial response from two years prior was validated. 
In some fashion, I felt redeemed and forgiven for all my bad life 
decisions. My response was completely emotional and un- intellectual, 
and utterly unexplainable in the moment. I felt in unison with the 
crowd, in communion with the spirit, in sync with the music. This time I
 left wanting more, and not at some distant as yet unscheduled time in 
the future: I wanted it NOW. To feel a part – me, a fifty-three year old
 middle-aged woman – of this joyous, raucous celebration of life, love, 
friendship, and music was an extraordinary encounter, in the very 
literal sense of the word - extraordinary. I experienced transcendence, 
inclusion, and redemption, and a part of the performance. Then I 
realized I wanted to know why I wanted more, and why I<br>
5<br>
felt these decidedly spiritual and emotional waves. I needed to know more, to understand why.<br>
Sitting alone in the concert hall, I heard and felt a truth and 
sincerity in the music engulfing me, a truth that touched me in a way no
 other music or musician had ever done. I am a child of the rock and 
roll generation; I cut my teeth to Elvis, learned to drive to the 
Beatles and the Rolling Stones, and had been ‘saved’ by Billy Graham - 
twice. What I felt after seeing Springsteen more clearly resembled the 
raw emotion I felt at the Billy Graham Crusades attended rather than the
 multitude of rock and roll shows seen in the course of the past 
thirty-eight years. I felt this man speaking to my heart, to my life’s 
wins and losses. He identified with my struggles and frustrations, while
 not waiting for me to identify with him, and perhaps that is his talent
 and genius. Bruce places the onus of understanding on himself, and not 
the listener. His job is to convince us that he knows what we know, to 
provide us with hope, and not to ask us to understand him. Sitting 
there, I felt as surely as I knew my own name that this man needed me as
 much as I needed him. Later readings verified his absolute 
acknowledgement of his personal need for audience acceptance and 
approval, as well as his feelings of insecurity and displacement as an 
adolescent; but his performance said it all. He was able to articulate 
all the angst and frustrations of life, while offering the gift that 
there is always hope, “that faith will be rewarded, dreams will not be 
thwarted” (Land of Hope and Dreams, 2001). And I accepted his covenant 
of faith - “you be true to me and I’ll be true to you” (Be True, 1988) -
 baptized in the flames of the fiery ministry of rock and roll. My 
conversion was completed that night; I believed him when he said “Grab 
your suitcase and your ticket, thunder’s rollin’ down the track” (Land 
of Hope and Dreams, 2001). I was now a devout,<br>
6<br>
devoted “Tramp,” (as the faithful refer to themselves, taken from the 
line “tramps like us, baby we were born to run” from the Springsteen 
song Born to Run, 1975).<br>
Prior to the Albany concert in December 2002, I knew that one of the 
Springsteen fan sites – greasylake.org – had planned a get together 
before the show, but I had been too apprehensive and anxious to attend. 
After all, I was already far past prime rockin’ and rollin’ age. I 
believed that most of the attendees would be decades younger than myself
 - weren’t all people who went to rock concerts twenty-three at the 
most? I had noticed older people – my age cohorts – at the shows I 
attended, but I doubted that these were the people haunting the fan 
sites I had been reading. Mature adults do not attend rock concerts and 
meet total strangers in restaurants or bars, or so I thought.<br>
However, over that winter of 2002-2003, I began to realize that the 
dimensions of devotion to the Springsteen credo and values did not 
exclude my peer group, but rather embraced all age groups, and perhaps 
most especially mine because of the shared historical time (after all, 
we were the same age, Bruce and I). I began reading and posting on 
several websites and cultivated at least an e-relationship with many 
fans. By the end of The Rising tour (all tours tend to be named after 
the album they support), I had attended several fan site organized 
tailgate get-togethers and met dozens of fans of all ages and 
geographical locations. These people were from a variety of lifestyles, 
but almost to a ‘man’ (and yes, the preponderance of fans I met were 
male, contrary to what might be the popular assumption of fans being 
women) they were possessed by the same spirit that I was – the spirit 
cast by a man of conviction, empathy, and intuitive understanding, a 
blue- collar prophet. These traits seemed contagious, and the fans I met
 were trying – each in his or her own way – to exercise the emotions and
 values depicted in Springsteen’s songs.<br>
7<br>
At one such gathering of 200-300 fans in August of 2003, I managed to 
collect nearly $3000 for the Second Harvest Food Bank of New Jersey in 
less than an hour. Total strangers were shoving fifty dollar bills into 
my hand. No one asked for receipts, or questioned my motives; for weeks 
after, checks kept arriving in the mail. If you were to ask any of these
 people what made them donate this money to a total stranger, the answer
 would have been something in the vein of “because she’s a fan, she 
wouldn’t deceive us” or some similar sentiment.<br>
Curious as to why this man and his music could motivate strangers to 
toss money at me, I began to explore Springsteen’s back catalog of 
songs, reading lyrics and listening to album after album. It is all 
there in his lyrics, laid naked for the pilgrim to see: concerns about 
justice and fairness, about friendship and honesty, about rejection and 
personal revelation, and ultimately, redemption. There is little mystery
 about Bruce Springsteen, only stark openness that appears to reveal his
 soul to any and all comers. It would seem that he believes what he 
writes, and further lives what he believes. For thirty- five plus years,
 people have been trying to see ‘behind’ the man, to expose his ugly, 
soft under-belly, and to date no one has. Either he is genuine, or he is
 the all-time absolute best actor. His fans – and I include myself in 
that multitude – have decided he is the ‘real deal.’<br>
What further intrigued me was the way that Springsteen fans referred to 
the concerts, and to their discovery of his music and fan community; the
 language was that of religion, where fans spoke of “conversions” and 
“redemption,” “epiphanies” and “faith.” Concerts are congregations of 
the faithful gathered in joyous celebration with the Minister of Rock 
and Roll, Bruce Springsteen. To be clear, not one fan I have ever<br>
8<br>
spoken with has ever alluded to Springsteen being a deity. Yet the 
obvious fact remains that many fans take away from his music and 
performances much of the feeling and comfort that a traditional worship 
service offers – by their own assertions. Moreover, the connection that 
individual fans feel towards each other mirrors the connections members 
of worship-communities share, and is reflected in a number of group 
activities and actions.<br>
In the following pages, I illustrate the ways in which Springsteen has 
sown the seeds for this fan community, and laid the groundwork for this 
spiritual ‘home’ the fans have created, influenced by his words, music, 
and deeds. This home works to provide much of the same sorts of 
emotional, social, and spiritual sustenance that traditional worship 
communities offer, as explained and defined by the fans themselves. By 
identifying with the persona of Bruce Springsteen and his working-class,
 ordinary Joe image, fans derive more than entertainment from his 
performances and music, finding faith and inspiration that serves them 
in their daily lives. My approach to this subject uses the 
anthropological notion of an insider, or emic, perspective because of my
 own involvement with, and within, the Springsteen community. Much of 
the information included in this thesis comes from personal experience 
and participant observation, as well as from conversations over the 
years with members of the fan community and concert audiences. In 
particular, two websites that are representative of the fan community 
have been invaluable sources of information: <a href="http://www.greasylake.org/" class="postlink">www.greasylake.org</a> and <a href="http://www.backstreets.com/" class="postlink">www.backstreets.com</a>.
 Fans from all over the world post on these sites that operate as cyber 
bulletin boards and that serve as the locus for much of the social 
activity and fund raising efforts common in the fan community. Using 
participant-observation as my<br>
approach and the words of the people involved, I also show the ways in 
which fan admiration and love have manifested as charitable actions 
patterned after the real – or assumed – actions of Mr. Springsteen.

<br>
CHAPTER 1 RELEASING RELIGION<br>
<br>
“We pray for your love, Lord We pray for the lost, Lord We pray for this
 world, Lord We pray for the strength, Lord We pray for the strength, 
Lord”<br>
<br>
(My City of Ruins, 2002) “Religion” said Dr. Gregory House, on a recent episode of the currently-popular<br>
television show House, “is a symptom of irrational belief and groundless
 hope.” This fictional persona, House, was attempting to diagnose a 
patient who had recently converted to Hasidic Judaism; he considered 
this conversion to be a symptom of her undiagnosed condition, and 
therefore of diagnostic significance rather than spiritual importance 
(as it turns out, there was no connection between the two). As on this 
show, religion comes at us through all mediums these days, whether in 
the form of fictionalized characters on a TV drama, Christian rock on 
the radio, or televangelists attempting to save our souls; it is 
everywhere. And just as we are assaulted with any number and kinds of 
religious messages daily, so are we confronted with multiple concepts of
 what religion is.<br>
<br>
Clifford Geertz says that religion is a set of symbols that “establish 
powerful, pervasive, and long lasting moods and motivations,” and that 
offer an ultimate explanation of the world (Pals 2006: 270). Durkheim 
says these symbols unite us into “moral communities” where we are 
concerned not simply with our individual well-being, but rather with the
 welfare of the group (Pals 2006: 96). In these days of frozen dinners 
for one, single-cup coffee makers, solitary internet communication, and 
rabid individualism, many people search for that “moral community” and 
sense of belonging. The (institutionalized) Church - regardless of 
religion or denomination - is no longer the sole proprietor of this 
territory - if it ever was - as many seek far and wide for some reason 
to believe, and some place to belong. Various people, it seems, are 
either replacing traditional religion with more meaningful spiritual 
practices or are adding other resources to supplement their traditional 
religion. In the twenty-first century, what theologies, products, and 
forms will offer us solace and spiritual nourishment, what will provide 
us with a sense of community or belonging to something bigger than 
ourselves? What will inspire and challenge us to become better people?<br>
Organized religion has become more, well, organized. Formal religion has
 diminished as a source of comfort and inspiration for many people and 
for some music has stepped in to fill the gaps (Lynch 2006). According 
to a recent survey conducted by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public 
Life, mainline Protestant churches are suffering diminishing 
congregations and more people are declaring themselves ‘unaffiliated.’ 
Church attendance is falling as well as participation in the rites and 
rituals associated with religion such as Christenings, baptisms and 
church weddings (Lynch 2006: 481). And this loss is not restricted to 
Christianity; synagogues and mosques (in non-Muslim majority countries) 
are also suffering (Lynch 2006: 481). More than twenty-five percent of 
the people surveyed have left the faith of their family of origin, while
 twenty-five percent of the adults aged eighteen to twenty-nine deny any
 religious affiliation at all. Among the age group that includes most 
Springsteen fans, ages thirty to forty-nine, forty<br>
12<br>
percent claim no religious affiliation (pewforum.org). This might help 
account for the spiritual identification many fans have with the music; 
there is no need to worry about conflicts with church dogma or policies 
if there is no church. But to claim no religious affiliation is not the 
same as claiming no spirituality.<br>
Additionally, the areas of heaviest fan population in the United States –
 the states of Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, 
Maryland and Virginia - corresponds geographically with those polled who
 self-identified as unaffiliated (pewforum.org). This information is 
submitted anecdotally, and in no way implies that all Northeast corridor
 residents claiming no religious affiliation are Bruce Springsteen fans,
 or the reverse. (Springsteen’s core audience initially was cultivated 
in the bars and clubs on a circuit that extended from Asbury Park north 
through Boston, and south through the beach towns of Virginia; when he 
began recording, it was the radio stations in these areas that were 
responsible for the bulk of airplay he initially received.) However, the
 information/statistics are suggestive.<br>
There may also be some connection between the lack of official church 
association and the large number of Springsteen fans in Europe, where 
secularization has been the rule rather than the exception – what 
Religion and Ethics Weekly refers to as “Europe’s long and dramatic 
decline in church attendance” (see also Lynch 2006). As Gordon Lynch 
says, “...alternative spiritualities are providing social spaces and 
cultural resources for religious affiliation, identities, and 
meaning-construction beyond the walls of the church, synagogue, or 
mosque (2006:482).” This alternative spirituality carries its 
congregants into the concert hall and the ‘ministry’ of Bruce.<br>
13<br>
“I’m just out here searchin’ for my own piece of the cross...”<br>
(I’ll Work for Your Love, 2007)<br>
To ferret out the meaning individuals derive from anything in their 
lives it becomes necessary to focus on action and active involvement. 
Lynch states “...it is inadequate to make inferences about the values 
and beliefs of Western culture simply through studying popular culture 
‘texts’ (2004: 164).” People tend to take the information that they need
 to make a decision or to find personal meaning and make it work for 
them. This interpretation of ‘meaning’ cannot be controlled by the 
producer of the resource used, or manipulated to ‘give’ meaning, but 
rather the meaning may be translated differently (decoded) and 
independently depending on each consumer’s own individual circumstance 
and taste – through a personal lens (Lynch 2004: 163). Stuart Hall calls
 the delivery system by which this information is received - and used 
effectively in popular culture - as “encoding” (Lynch 2004: 163). 
Information is presented in such a way as to extract a particular 
response or interpretation. But during the “decoding” process, the 
‘audience’ or receptor (consumer) decodes the information in a manner 
that best suits them, sometimes creating different meanings than those 
initially intended, meanings that are situationally dependent (Lynch 
2004: 165). Here is where individuals determine what is meaningful for 
them, based on their own personal needs. It is not useful therefore to 
try to interpret these encoded messages without observing the specific 
situation within which the message is delivered, and where the people 
involved decode for themselves. Herein lays the value of participant 
observation and conversation, where one can have the opportunity to 
qualitatively describe the whys and hows of individuals’ actions and 
beliefs based on context, their context.<br>
14<br>
Until fairly recently, the domain of assigning appropriate labels to 
cultural/spiritual rites and customs has resided in the academy 
(Chidester 1996:760). Academics and scholars have told us what is and is
 not a “real” religion, what constitutes a cult, and what is simply 
social practice and custom. Other outside attempts (academic and 
scholarly) to identify practices and belief systems as religion have 
been ridiculed and dismissed out of hand (Chidester 1996: 760). Many of 
the new religious movements have been called “cults” and denied the 
status of religion. Instead they have been labeled as “entrepreneurial 
businesses, politically subversive movements, or coercive, mind- 
controlling, and brain-washing ‘cults’ (Chidester 1996: 760).” The 
ordinary man and woman feeling something outside the parameters of 
proscribed “official” religion in unorthodox settings had no way – and 
apparently no authority – to determine or even translate the 
spirituality of these feelings.<br>
However, recent scholarship and the myriad forms of popular culture have
 challenged this narrow definition of religion. Popular culture – “that 
which is (or has been) accepted or approved of by large groups of people
 (Forbes 2000: 4)” – can be a conduit into another world (Albanese 1999:
 465), a world where we can explore meanings and meaningfulness for 
ourselves. In these other worlds, we can experience a place of 
transcendence from the trials and travails of ordinary life. Popular 
culture can provide a platform upon which our definitions of religion 
can be expanded and grow to accommodate new ways of ‘believing.’ 
Cultural religion reflects our search for religious experience and our 
need for a feeling of community based on mutual involvement in something
 beyond the traditional definition of religion, as well as our right to 
define “religion” for ourselves (Albanese 1999: 465). Seekers find their
 own way across this<br>
15<br>
landscape, searching for that transcendent moment, that feeling of 
connection and inclusion, that one “...face that ain’t looking through 
me” (Badlands, 1978).<br>
David Chidester proposes that religion be classified as an activity that
 is organized and that functions as traditional churches do (1996: 744).
 In this rendering, religion is comprised of symbols and systems of 
symbols that are sacred, and that imbue the world with value for 
‘believers’ that utilize these symbols (Chidester 1996: 744). Chidester 
maintains that the explication of religion is “constantly at stake in 
the interchanges of cultural discourses and practices (1996: 745),” an 
attribute that keeps it vital and growing. Chidester’s analysis of 
baseball as religion provides us with a good, working model for 
identifying the Springsteen fan community as a ‘congregation’ using this
 skeletal framework of continuity, uniformity, sacred space, and sacred 
time (1996: 745).<br>
Looking through this lens, continuity is maintained by the musician’s 
(Springsteen) thirty-five plus year career of thoughtful lyrics and 
public appearances. Steadfastness of viewpoint and delivery as well as 
personal civic activity has created a model of ideals over time with his
 blue-collar/everyman persona, cementing his position as Bard of the 
working class A large part of Springsteen’s audience has been attending 
his shows for most of these thirty-five years, and sharing the memories 
of these shows with other, younger fans maintains the legacy and myths 
that surround Springsteen. Uniformity and a sense of belonging emanate 
from the mutual admiration for Mr. Springsteen, and from the fans’ 
attendance at shows. Fans know that they are in the company of other 
acolytes and trust is established (to varying degrees) around this fact;
 there is a belief that fans all maintain and practice similar core 
values. The concert hall or<br>
16<br>
stadium becomes a place filled with like-minded individuals - “tramps” 
all - joined in mutual admiration and trust (again, a reference to the 
song Born to Run and the line “tramps like us”). The concert spot itself
 represents the sacred space and is similar to one’s customary place of 
worship, a place where all believers are welcome. This is also the spot 
of sacred time and ritual, where congregants can celebrate the music 
itself as well as celebrate in the music. To a lesser extent, this sense
 of ‘home’ can be derived from recordings, but the real celebration of 
faith takes place in the concert hall. True believers travel from city 
to city, attending and participating in as many services as possible. 
Just as outsiders unfamiliar with the rituals and responses required of 
congregants at, say, a Catholic worship service may be confounded by the
 service, so may outsiders or non-fans be confounded by the activities 
of the audience during a show. Their performed ‘rituals’ – the pumping 
of fists during “Badlands” or the chorus of oh- oh-oh-oh-ohs sung only 
by the audience during the same song, the audience singing the first 
verse of “Hungry Heart” before the band chimes in - help define and 
delineate believer from non-believer, and affirm and reinforce the 
“social solidarity of a community...meeting personal needs and 
reinforcing social integration” (Chidester 1996: 748). Not 
coincidentally, in this same article, Chidester also speaks about the 
“...inherently religious character of rock ‘n roll” (1996: 753).<br>
Popular music, in the guise of rock and roll, and its inherent attitude 
of dis- organization and looming chaos has presented some seekers with a
 replacement of or supplement to the community once found through 
religion: Bruce Springsteen and the devoted fan community that surrounds
 him. In many ways this community now functions as both a social network
 and a spiritual community. Much as the organized church has in the 
past, the Springsteen congregation offers belonging and support and 
presents a vehicle for doing “good works.” For numerous fans, the music 
and concert events and pre-concert gatherings offer the same support, 
relief, release, and connection that traditional worship services offer 
their congregations. “Belief systems always rest upon a social 
base...and in modern society the social structures” underpinning 
commitment have moved away from the society at large to smaller units of
 shared experience (Roof 1978: 52). As the church once did, and still 
does for some, the music, person, and concert experience of the audience
 at a Bruce Springsteen concert offers transformation and transcendence 
through the “majesty, the ministry of rock and roll” (Springsteen in 
concert). These are hard things to talk about – the genesis of feelings,
 the origins of emotion and faith, but they cannot be denied because 
there is no scientific measure of meaning, no “big-bang” theory of 
origin. If this were truly the case, no one could ever meaningfully 
discuss faith.<br>
Rock ‘n roll can also function as a tool to teach religious beliefs and 
values, and is increasingly melded into Protestant and Catholic liturgy 
(Kotarba 2002: 122). Many churches offer special services for their 
congregations, targeting younger church members with a more contemporary
 form of worship, often using rock combos to deliver the musical 
component of the service. This past winter I attended a “U2-charist” at a
 local Episcopal Church, a communion service designed entirely around 
the music and lyrics of the rock band U2. And this April, a Methodist 
Church in Greensboro will be conducting services during the month of 
April around the songs of Bruce Springsteen. (See Appendix 4).<br>
Given this, the analysis of rock ‘n’ roll as religion is a natural, but 
why Bruce Springsteen? Why are legions of fans the world over so 
dedicated and devoted to this particular musician? His music and lyrics 
are meaningful, his imagery vivid, and his stage show is decidedly that –
 a stage performance part Broadway, part carnival, part down-home gospel
 tent revival; yet even the trite and cheesy parts delight and engage 
the fans, as some part of Mr. Springsteen shines through. His sincerity 
is never in doubt by his ‘followers.’ As one fan, a Methodist minister I
 call Reverend B, told me, Springsteen speaks to the human condition, 
something to which we can all relate (Reverend B.).<br>
”We’ll let blood build a bridge, over mountains draped in stars”<br>
(Worlds Apart, 2002) Springsteen’s appeal has roots in his lyrical history of visible integrity, empathy,<br>
understanding and compassion as well as his perceived personal sincerity
 and genuineness. Of no little contribution to his persona is his 
history of quietly contributing to charities and causes that dates back 
more than twenty-five years. In the fashion of<br>
20<br>
effective organizations, not unlike religious outreach organizations and
 missions, Springsteen has allocated funds for food banks working with 
the unemployed, workers’ unions, and organizations that provide home 
repairs for the needy (Walker 2004). Since 1984, he has invited local 
food banks and other charitable organizations to set up collections in 
the arenas and stadiums where he plays. At each show, he will make a 
plea from the stage for attendees to please consider contributing and 
working with these organizations to help facilitate change. (“In the 
end, nobody wins unless everybody wins” is an oft-quoted phrase repeated
 at shows during the Born in the USA Tour that exemplifies how fans see 
him.) Usually, there is a song dedicated to these workers on what 
Springsteen calls “the front lines.” These are not the glamorous causes 
of the celebrity world, or the Hollywood-touted disease du jour 
foundations, but rather the low- profile, gritty organizations trying to
 help the hardworking man and woman, the migrant farm worker, the people
 on the margins of society. In his own words: “I want to try and just 
work more directly with people; try to find some way to tie into the 
communities we come into” (Walker 2004). His concern for social justice 
for those least represented and/or able to advocate for themselves is 
obvious and reminiscent of many of the finest spiritual and community 
leaders. Part of his appeal to his fans is this “everyman” persona, his 
concern for the plight of the hard-working, struggling American, where 
his sincerity and genuineness seem almost palpable.<br>
While this common-man persona Bruce projects may be part public 
relations fabrication, his facade has not slipped during his thirty-five
 years in the spotlight under the scrutiny of an ever-increasingly 
cynical public. His steadfastness of ideals and his consistent actions 
support the persona his fans see, and they respect as well as revere<br>
21<br>
Bruce. He is continually heralded as being one of us, a man who knows 
and remembers his origins and roots. In reading hundreds of accounts of 
encounters with Bruce I have seen no negative responses, heard no story 
of rudeness or even the ordinary day to day unpleasantness that even the
 best of us can sometimes exhibit. Most fans respect his privacy when he
 is with his family, and the lore has it that citizens of his hometown 
territory in New Jersey are fiercely protective of his privacy. To 
better understand how his fans come to this place, it becomes necessary 
to know more about Bruce Springsteen and the forces that helped shape 
the man he has become.<br>
22<br>
CHAPTER 2 GENESIS<br>
“I come from down in the valley where mister when you’re young they bring you up to do like your daddy done”<br>
(The River, 1980) To understand a person – and the people who hold him 
or her in esteem - it is necessary to know the texture, the fabric of 
his or her life, the emotional warp and woof that results in the 
finished cloth. Bruce Frederick Springsteen was born September 23, 1949,
 and raised in Freehold, New Jersey to working class parents of Dutch, 
Irish and Italian ancestry. The section of town where his family resided
 was lower-middle-working class, and his neighborhood, known as “Texas” 
because of the large number of southerners who’d migrated there, was on 
the proverbial wrong side of the tracks (Marsh 2004: 24). His childhood 
and adolescence are outwardly unremarkable. Mom Adele worked as a 
secretary and dad Douglas filled any number of different jobs including 
bus driver, prison guard and mill worker. The family lived for many 
years with one or the other set of grandparents when financially 
strapped. The oldest child, Bruce has two sisters, Pamela and Virginia. 
Life in blue-collar New Jersey was not easy for the family, with Douglas
 moving from job to job. The tension and frustration the elder Mr. 
Springsteen carried with him influenced his son in ways that would 
manifest years later in song and story on stage in a public exorcism and
 attempt to understand and make sense<br>
of his parents’ experiences. In Springsteen’s own words: “There was a 
promise of a right to a decent life, that you didn’t have to live and 
die like my old man did” (Smith 2002: 135). “When I was really young, I 
don’t remember thinkin’ about it<br>
23<br>
much. But as I got older, I watched my father...how he would come home 
from work and just sit in the kitchen all night. Like there was 
somethin’ dyin’ inside of him, or like he’d never had a chance to 
live...until I started to feel there was somethin’ dyin’ inside of me” 
(Marsh 2004:319).<br>
Years later, when inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, he would
 admit to the audience that the working-man’s clothes he wore in concert
 was his way of honoring his father (Sawyer 2004: 2).<br>
Bruce relates that he did not really start living until he ‘found’ music
 in the form of rock ‘n roll. In his own words: “I lived half of my 
first 13 years in a trance. I was thinking of things, but I was always 
on the outside looking in (Sandford 1999: 15).” Music became his anchor 
and hope. “The only thing that kept me from giving up when I was young 
was in the rock ’n’ roll music I heard – that there was a meaning in 
life, a meaning in living” (Smith 2002: 135). This belief in a 
“meaningful life” will continue to echo throughout his career. In one 
concert tale often told early on in his career, Bruce talks about a nun 
at St. Rose of Lima elementary school who stuffed him into a trashcan 
under her desk because that is where, she said, he belonged. This story 
reveals that Springsteen’s feelings of separateness and alienation 
formed early on in his childhood, and they have remained vivid. At 7, 
Bruce saw Elvis Presley appear on the Ed Sullivan Show, and decided to 
become a musician. As every Springsteen disciple knows, his mother Adele
 took out a loan to buy a teenaged Bruce a guitar, an act memorialized 
in the Springsteen song The Wish (1998):<br>
24<br>
Dirty old street all slushed up in the rain and snow Little boy and his 
ma shivering outside a rundown music store window That night on top of a
 Christmas tree shines one beautiful star And lying underneath a 
brand-new Japanese guitar I remember in the morning, ma, hearing your 
alarm clock ring I'd lie in bed and listen to you gettin' ready for work
 The sound of your makeup case on the sink And the ladies at the office,
 all lipstick, perfume and rustlin' skirts And how proud and happy you 
always looked walking home from work If pa's eyes were windows into a 
world so deadly and true You couldn't stop me from looking but you kept 
me from crawlin' through And if it's a funny old world, mama, where a 
little boy's wishes come true Well I got a few in my pocket and a 
special one just for you It ain't no phone call on Sunday, flowers or a 
mother's day card It ain’t no house on a hill with a garden and a nice 
little yard I got my hot rod down on Bond Street, I'm older but you'll 
know me in a<br>
glance We'll find us a little rock 'n roll bar and baby we'll go out and
 dance Well it was me in my Beatle boots, you in pink curlers and 
matador pants Pullin' me up off the couch to do the twist for my uncles 
and aunts Well I found a girl of my own now, ma, I popped the question 
on your<br>
birthday She stood waiting on the front porch while you were telling me to get out<br>
there<br>
25<br>
And say what it was that I had to say Last night we all sat around 
laughing at the things that guitar brought us And I laid awake thinking 
'bout the other things it's brought us Well tonight I'm takin' requests 
here in the kitchen This one's for you, ma, let me come right out and 
say it It's overdue, but baby, if you're looking for a sad song, well I 
ain't gonna<br>
play it.<br>
These decidedly un-rock-like lyrics thanking his mother, a decidedly 
unlikely topic for a rock musician, give some glimpse into the 
attraction his music will eventually offer many millions of fans the 
world over. After all, how many other popular musicians have written 
songs of gratitude to their mothers? The lyrics of the above song 
indicate the debt and love that Springsteen obviously feels for his 
mother. He credits her with saving him from his father’s life, from 
keeping him from “crawling through” into that dead world of limited 
possibilties and abandoned hope. His mother opened up the possibility of
 a world of freedom and release, symbolized in that guitar. But, he 
tells her in this song, he hasn’t changed. “I’m older but you’ll know me
 in a glance.” Adele Springsteen had an obvious impact on her son’s view
 of the working life as something in which to take pride.<br>
His relationship with his father, however, was tense and difficult, as 
the elder Springsteen had no understanding or tolerance for his son’s 
musical aspirations. Family and life conflicts became the fodder of 
on-stage stories; the Springsteen-lore is replete with many of these 
concert stories of paternal conflict preceding certain songs, “It’s My 
Life” among them:<br>
“I used to always have to go back home. And I’d stand there in that driveway, afraid to go in the house, and I could see<br>
26<br>
the screen door, I could see the light of my pop’s cigarette. And I 
remember I just couldn’t wait until I was old enough to take him out 
once. I used to slick my hair back real tight so he couldn’t tell how 
long it was getting’. And try to sneak through the kitchen. But the old 
man he’d catch me every night and he’d drag me back into the 
kitchen...we’d start talkin’ about nothin’ much. How I was doin’. Pretty
 soon he’d ask me what I thought I was doin’ with myself, and we’d 
always end up screamin’ at each other. My mother she’d always end up 
runnin’ in from the front room, cryin’ and tryin’ to pull him off me, 
try to keep us from fightin’ with each other. And I’d always, I’d always
 end up runnin’ out the back door...tellin’ him how it was my life and I
 was gonna do what I wanted to do.” Bruce Springsteen (Marsh 
2003:25-26).<br>
It was at this point that Bruce would launch into the song “It’s My 
Life,” not one he’d written, but obviously one with which he emotionally
 identified.<br>
A male friend once told me that if you wanted to make a man cry, just 
ask him about his father. Bruce obviously carried around many 
conflicting feelings about his own father and what sort of role he 
played in his life, and again, this is one of the things that fans can 
relate to – the conflicts with our families, and the cascade of emotions
 we can experience when dealing with our families. Bruce also talked 
about his father’s referring to “that goddamned guitar.” (Since his 
father’s death in 1998 these stories have migrated<br>
27<br>
into the oral history, and are no longer used by him in his 
performances) One frequently told tale was that of Bruce’s convalescing 
from a motorcycle accident at home, and his father paying a barber to 
come to the house to cut Bruce’s unruly long hair. Yet when Bruce was 
rejected by the Selective Service Board and classified 4-F (physically 
unfit for service) in the late sixties, Douglas Springsteen’s reaction 
was a quiet but heartfelt “Good.” This was, after all, in 1968, and the 
Vietnam War with its military draft posed a reality for teenaged boys 
that the Iraq War does not for today’s youth. By telling this story, 
Springsteen was releasing any resentment towards his father, and 
acknowledging that Douglas was not the uncaring father depicted in the 
previous story. And by doing this in a performance, he provided an 
example for men in the audience who perhaps had their own father issues.<br>
Despite circumstances that could have made him a bitter and mean young 
man, Bruce Springsteen showed a level of understanding, empathy, and 
compassion towards his father as he aged and matured. The 1980 album The
 River included the song “Independence Day” that illustrated his 
capacity for empathy and forgiveness.<br>
Well, Papa go to bed now it’s getting late Nothing we can say can change
 anything now I’ll be leavin’ in the morning from St. Mary’s gate We 
wouldn’t change this thing even if we could somehow Cause the darkness 
of this house has got the best of us There’s a darkness in this town 
that’s got us too But they can’t touch me now and you can’t touch me now<br>
28<br>
They ain’t gonna do to me What I watched them do to you Now I don’t know
 what it always was with us We chose the words, and yeah, we drew the 
lines There was just no way this house could hold the two of us I guess 
that we were just too much of the same kind.<br>
These are not the words of a grudge-holding, rebelling adolescent, but 
an understanding adult, and the sort of lyrics upon which Springsteen’s 
emotional legacy is built. There is an understanding in this song of the
 forces that pluck at us, over which we have no control; we can only 
change how we deal with these forces in spite of the outcome. Our 
responsibility is in the way we deal with situations that we have no 
control over. This song is also a public forgiveness of his father, as 
well as an apology to Douglas Springsteen: “I guess that we were just 
too much of the same kind.” His words come from situations understood if
 not experienced, and this empathy pours out in his music; his songs 
show a remarkable ability to understand whatever situation he is writing
 about, whether it is an illegal immigrant working in a methamphetamine 
lab, or a Vietnam veteran seeking work. Songs of love and moon and June 
we are accustomed to hearing from other musicians, but Springsteen’s 
lyrics mine the deeper emotional waters of unwed mothers and desolate 
souls searching for a little peace and happiness, walking on the 
backstreets looking for hope.<br>
Many of his songs sound potentially autobiographical, and indeed there 
must be a component of self in any good writing. But Springsteen 
disavows literal historiography<br>
29<br>
saying “the songs are not literally autobiographical but in some way they’re emotionally autobiographical” (Primeaux 1996: <img class="smilies" src="_assets/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" width="15" height="15">.
 However, in “Songs,” Springsteen admits to some actual history, telling
 the reader that “I often wrote from a child’s point of view: ‘Mansion 
on the Hill,’ ‘Used Cars,’ ‘My Father’s House’ – these are all stories 
that came directly out of my experience with my family” (2003: 138). In 
concert, Springsteen told the story of an old family car that didn’t 
have reverse gear, so his father would park the car on a hill so it 
would be easier to start driving. The words to “Used Car (1982)” reflect
 more than mere auto-frustration:<br>
My little sister’s in the front seat with an ice cream cone My Ma’s in 
the backseat sittin’ all alone As my Pa steers her slow out of the lot 
for a test drive down Michigan Avenue<br>
Now my Ma she fingers her wedding band And watches the salesman stare at
 my old man’s hands He’s tellin’ us ‘bout the break he’d give us if he 
could but he just can’t Well if I could swear I know just what I’d do 
Now mister, the day the lottery I win I ain’t ever gonna ride in no used
 car again Now the neighbors come from near and far As we pull up in our
 brand-new used car I wish he’d just hit the gas and let out a cry And 
tell ‘em all they can kiss our asses goodbye<br>
30<br>
My dad he sweats the same job from mornin’ to morn Me I walk home on the
 same dirty streets where I was born Up the block I can hear my little 
sister in the front seat blowin’ that horn The sounds echo all down 
Michigan Avenue Now mister, the day my number comes in I ain’t ever 
gonna ride in no used car again<br>
It is lyrics in this vein, of the songs quoted above that give the 
public a window into Springsteen’s childhood and the forces that helped 
shape the man he has become. The examples are there for the world to 
read, hear, and see, and have been analyzed and dissected by pop writers
 and scholars alike. Fans have heard his music and recognize the 
humanity of the writer, felt his compassion via his music, and judged 
him accordingly. They feel connected to this man, who most have never 
and will never meet, but who nevertheless is as familiar as a lover.<br>
Fans know their history - the Springsteen creation myth, if you will. 
The elder Springsteens took their life’s savings and moved from their 
home in Freehold, New Jersey to California in 1969, but nineteen year 
old Bruce decided to remain in New Jersey pursuing his music, moving to 
the shore community of Asbury Park. And here the ‘legend’ begins to take
 shape. Springsteen’s name has come to be inextricably intertwined with 
that of Asbury Park, New Jersey, a seedy little seaside town on the 
Jersey shore immortalized on his first album Greetings from Asbury Park 
(1973). Asbury at the time – and perhaps presently - suffered from 
run-of-the-mill political corruption, and funds targeted for urban 
development never manifested in change for the city. As<br>
31<br>
subject to racial conflict as the rest of late 60’s and early 70’s urban America, July 1970 saw race riots in Asbury Park (<a href="http://www.beyondthepalace.com/newjersey/asburypark" class="postlink">http://www.beyondthepalace.com/newjersey/asburypark</a>.).
 Nevertheless, there was a flourishing music scene that included any 
number of bands, one of which was Bruce Springsteen’s, in whatever the 
moment revealed: The Castiles, Earth, Child, Dr. Zoom and the Sonic 
Boom, Steel Mill, and the Bruce Springsteen Band to name some 
incarnations of his bands. It was an “era of shared apartments and 
skimpy meals” (Cross 1989: 26).<br>
The legendary record executive John Hammond signed Springsteen to a 
recording contract with Columbia Records in 1972, and released Greetings
 from Asbury Park in 1973. In May of 1974, rock critic Jon Landau of 
Boston’s Real Paper was present at a Springsteen performance at the 
Harvard Theater, and wrote the prescient, legendary “I have seen the 
future of rock and roll and its name is Bruce Springsteen” review (Marsh
 1987: 155). Springsteen’s live performances, where he forged his 
connection to his audience through both his musical outreach and his 
active attempts to involve them, were becoming legendary, and his fans 
many and loyal. Somehow, his absolute sincerity cut through any rock ‘n’
 roll pretenses and touched those who saw him perform.<br>
But it was with the release of his third album, the critically acclaimed
 Born to Run, that the rest of the country and the world began to hear 
the name Bruce Springsteen and his nickname, ‘the Boss.’ Both Newsweek 
and Time magazines featured his face on the cover of their respective 
magazines the same week in 1975. Springsteen and his music had become 
ubiquitous, so much so that during his first visit and performances in 
London, Springsteen rebelled and tore down posters promoting his concert
 there. Again, these are the unlikely actions of a future rock-icon, but
 that are indicative of the kind of man and<br>
32<br>
performer Bruce was and still is. In his words, “I wasn’t interested in 
immediate success or how much each particular record sold. I was 
interested in becoming part of people’s lives and, hopefully, growing up
 with them – growing up together” (Sawyer 2004: 1). Instinctively, fans 
feel this.<br>
Springsteen’s live shows, constructed as if made of fire and performed 
from the heart, continued to create a loyal following, and his fame grew
 quickly. The ferocity and zeal with which he performed as well as the 
prolonged performances of three, four, even four and a half hours became
 the stuff of legends. Because of contractual and legal issues, however,
 (he had fired and brought suit against his manager Mike Appel during 
the recording of Born to Run) he was legally prohibited from recording 
until his legal problems were resolved (Sawyers 9). When he finally 
reentered the recording studio two years later slightly more jaded and 
disillusioned with the record business after this legal struggle, it was
 with a stylistically more somber and adult set of songs. “After Born to
 Run I wanted to write about life in the close confines of the small 
towns I grew up in...I felt a sense of accountability to the people I'd 
grown up alongside of...I wanted to ensure that my music continued to 
have value and a sense of place” (Springsteen 2003:66).<br>
“I believe in the love that can save me...”<br>
(Badlands, 1978) The strength of Springsteen’s character and its reflection in his lyrics becomes<br>
important when critically looking at his fan following. His “sense of 
place and value” are evidenced in both his writings and in his presented
 persona, and create a loyal and devoted fan-base. Put quite simply, 
fans believe what he sings and what he says. He is not seen as 
infallible or impervious to human failings; his more politically 
conservative<br>
33<br>
fans see his politics as naïve and simplistic. Indeed, the break-up of 
his first marriage to Julianne Phillips was acted out on the pages of 
tabloids all over the world. Yet somehow even this marital dissolution 
seemed to work in Springsteen’s favor, earning him more emotional 
capital with his audience; he left his super-model wife for a back-up 
singer in his band, a real ‘Jersey girl,’ Patti Scialfa, and married 
her. They have remained married and have three children together.<br>
Over the course of the past thirty-five years, the musicians performing 
behind Springsteen as the E Street Band have maintained a constant 
line-up, with only one break from performing together. These band 
members had played together since their teens, some members for as long 
as twenty years, when Springsteen “fired” them in 1989. For reasons only
 truly known to Springsteen, he formed a new touring band and recorded 
two albums. The loyal fans took this break-up hard, and never really 
embraced what came to be known as the “other band.” For nearly 15 years 
the E Street Band had been the foils for Springsteen’s on-stage antics, 
and their personas seemed entwined with Bruce’s. Even the name of the 
band, “The E Street,” harkened back to their teenage years, as the house
 where they practiced was on E Street. Fans felt a little betrayed: 
these were extended family members, almost as beloved as Bruce himself. 
(Some never truly forgave Bruce for this, and posts regularly show up on
 the internet still debating the quality of the music produced with 
them). The E Street Band members themselves were for the most part 
silent. The ‘break-up’ continued until January 1995, when the E Street 
band reunited with Bruce to record several cuts for his Greatest Hits 
compact disc. And in 1999, Springsteen accompanied by the reunited E 
Street Band launched their Reunion Tour, playing 120<br>
34<br>
shows in eighty two countries, concluding with ten shows at New York’s Madison Square Garden.<br>
A musicologist’s analysis of Springsteen’s music and performance cites 
expression rather than “virtuosic control” as the lynchpin of his work: 
the audience experiences and internalizes his performance as an “honest 
man giving his emotional all” (Berger &amp; Del Negro 2004: 58, 59). 
This succinct summation says what millions of fans have been saying for 
thirty five years. Berger and Del Negro describe Springsteen fans as 
“engaging in romantic detail vertigo” and state that the listeners’ 
attention is drawn more to the emotion and meaning than to the technical
 rendering of the performance (2004: 59). Ultimately, these scholars 
maintain that this reflexivity is important to performance:<br>
“the reflexive metacommentary by which a performer signals her awareness
 of herself as a participant in an interaction – and by which she 
signals her awareness of the audience’s attention to her – colors and 
informs all of the ‘primary’ communication in the performance and plays a
 crucial role in the overall aesthetics of the event” (Berger &amp; 
DelNegro, 2004: 95).<br>
The translation of this for Springsteen and fans is that Bruce knows – 
as do the fans – that the audience is an integral part of the event. He 
feeds off the audience, and gives them responsibility for a more highly 
charged performance or a less energetic show, playing them like another 
instrument in his performing repertoire. For example, during a 1980<br>
35<br>
performance in Stockholm, Bruce acknowledged his growing awareness of the necessity of audience involvement:<br>
There’s a Marvin Gaye and Tammy Terrell song: it’s called ‘It Takes 
Two.’ In the song, Marvin Gaye sings, ‘It takes two to make a dream come
 true.’ And I guess that’s why we’re here tonight talking to you and you
 guys are talking to us. Because it’s funny, you know, on this tour 
since we’ve been over here, I’ve learned...I’ve learned a lot over here.
 I’ve learned the importance of the audience, the importance of you in 
the show. Because we come out and we play, and we play hard and try to 
tell you about the things that mean a lot to us, and when you respond 
the way you have tonight and last night, it’s like...it’s a big, like 
‘me too,’ you know. It’s in a buncha little things. I want you to know 
that it means a lot to us...(Marsh 2003:282)<br>
For performances during his younger years, an important part of his 
compact with his followers was throwing himself – literally – into the 
audience, being carried by their hands, and getting deposited back 
on-stage with the audience’s help. Today, an older Bruce, no longer any 
more able to perform these strenuous physical gyrations than the rest of
 us fifty-somethings, has replaced these audience-dives with moving to 
the edge of the stage and encouraging the lucky faithful to strum his 
guitar, while others touch the edges of his jeans or boots. A communion 
of sort, sharing guitar strings and denim<br>
instead of bread and wine, there is no fear here; Bruce trusts his 
audience in the same way they trust him. This is part of the covenant 
that has given birth to the community and unity fans feel with each 
other and with Bruce Springsteen, and that creates a climate conducive 
to actively witnessing for Bruce, honoring both his humanity and our own
 by actively working for a better world and striving for personal 
integrity: “Baby you be true to me and I’ll be true to you” (Be True, 
1988). To be ‘true’ to him, we need to be ‘true’ to each other and 
ourselves.</div>

‘Tramps Like Us...”<br>
(Born to Run, 1975) William Romanowski says the popularity of any “...given cultural element is<br>
directly proportional to the degree to which that element is reflective 
of audience beliefs and values” (2001: 18). This is certainly true of 
Springsteen’s audiences, but with a twist: the ‘faithful’ see themselves
 as a reflection of the ideals espoused by Springsteen. The lyrical 
content of his music contained within the popular culture rubric finds 
itself dealing with emotions readily experienced by the majority. And 
because music can work as a conveyance system of shared meanings, a 
component of religion and culture both, the lines can further blur when 
sitting in the audience. George Barna’s categorization of Christians 
suggests that those people he calls cultural Christians (in Romanowski 
2001, 28) hold this idea of works-based faith, again echoed in the 
Springsteen fan community. This is not to say that all Springsteen fans 
are either religious or Christian, however. Romanowski claims also that 
it is a perspective that makes a work religious, that “...there is 
something right about the way he creates popular music,” and that the 
music “...captures a sense of religious longing and daily struggle that 
resonates...” with listeners (2001:93, 30).<br>
But what, exactly, is a fan? One working definition in use now, that of 
an enthusiastic supporter of a sports team or celebrity, differs 
considerably from the original definition of a religious zealot 
(Cavicchi 1998: 38). Yet there is a component of the zealot in any true 
fan. To be a fan indicates a certain level of devotion to the object of 
one’s fandom. Most fans initially become ‘converts’ and experience this 
transformation<br>
38<br>
through an introduction to and identification with the music and lyrics.
 The language these converts use is that of spiritual conversion, not 
unlike the language and imagery a recently ‘saved’ Christian might use, 
calling themselves ‘believers (Steven).” One French fan told me that she
 attended her first concert in 1992 and “saw the face of God (janiss).” 
Some terms commonly used to describe a Springsteen-event are 
‘redemption’ and ‘salvation,’ most decidedly religious, as is the 
burning need the converted masses feel to bring others into the fold, to
 convert them. Being a Springsteen fan is not unlike being a missionary 
for Bruce.<br>
In the Springsteen-world, there are ‘casual fans’ and ‘real fans:’ a casual fan<br>
might attend a concert, but would probably not alter life-plans to do so, while a ‘real fan’<br>
does whatever it takes within their means to attend a show. Every ‘real’ fan knows<br>
exactly how many times they have seen Springsteen, with some fans counting triple-digit<br>
performances as proof of their devotion. Springsteen fans also proclaim their solidarity<br>
with each other, casual or true, and exhibit this unity at shows by responding at various<br>
times during the performance with specific hand gestures and vocal responses. As one<br>
‘follower’ stated, “...any one Bruce fan could somehow speak for ALL Bruce fans...part<br>
of being a Bruce fan was being a member of the shared history of the Bruce fan<br>
Community. You knew any Bruce fan was a friend of any other Bruce fan” (Steven).<br>
Going to a concert is like spending time with 20,000 of your closest friends you’ve not<br>
yet met.<br>
“making grown men cry and women dance”<br>
(Bruce Springsteen on “60 Minutes”) Who are these fans? Most are men, more evident in the European audiences than<br>
in the United States. A cursory examination of the audience in Cologne, Germany at a<br>
39<br>
December 2007 concert revealed an approximate ratio of men to women 
around six to one; the Paris audience appeared even more male, with what
 looked to be about a ten to one ratio, male to female. Concert goers 
assured me that part of this was due to the “crazy Italian men fans” 
that traveled all over Europe following Bruce in concert. Indeed, at the
 Paris show of December 2007, there looked to be twenty to thirty men in
 the “pit” (the standing area closest to the stage) all wearing orange 
shirts, and waving Italian flags. In the Bruce-fandom world, the Italian
 fans are legendary, with fans of other nations wistfully coveting shows
 in Italy.<br>
A recently published book of fan stories, For You, contains the 
fan-written and contributed stories of what Bruce means to them as well 
as stories relating personal encounters with him. The stories presented 
in the following chapters echo the same themes found in Kirsch’s book, 
of “finding” Springsteen and what that means to the individual. These 
fans self-identify to whatever extent they are comfortable, using either
 their actual given names or screen names. In examining the book, I 
tallied up the gender of the contributors, and found that some one 
hundred and sixty three were identifiable as males, while sixty seven 
were women; sixteen I classified as gender unknown, as the names were 
either unisex or unknown to me (Kirsch 2007). This supports what I have 
observed at concerts and the larger number of male attendees.<br>
In terms of age, fans run the spectrum from very young (under ten) to 
over sixty. The majority of fans range between forty to fifty years old.
 In 2007 I asked people (on a fansite where I am a member, <a href="http://www.greasylake.org/" class="postlink">www.greasylake.org</a>)
 to email me and tell me a little about their bruce-ness. Thirty four 
people responded, and the majority were between the ages of forty-one to
 fifty (thirteen). Nine people were between the ages of thirty-one and 
forty,<br>
40<br>
while seven people were age eighteen to thirty. There were two respondents over sixty, and three between fifty-one and sixty.<br>
For the most part, the people who communicated with me were well 
educated, with all but two people having at least some college. Twelve 
were women, with again the majority being male. Most of these particular
 fans had at least some college education, with two indicating a 
doctorate. Incomes were spilt almost equally for those who answered, 
with seventeen people making less than fifty thousand dollars a year, 
and seventeen people making more than fifty thousand dollars a year. 
Their occupations spanned everything from judges (one) and lawyers (two)
 to a full-time homemaker and a chef. No one reported being a manual 
laborer, and everyone for the most part seemed to have white-collar 
jobs.<br>
This casual polling also revealed that twenty of these fans did not 
regularly attend any church, temple, or mosque other than The Church of 
Bruce; one devoted congregant however, who has attended over fourteen 
shows and who has been a fan for twenty five years, reported he was a 
Bible student at a Jehovah Witnesses’ Kingdom Hall. When asked, the fans
 expressed seeing no conflict between the spiritual nourishment they 
received through Springsteen and his music and whatever ‘regular’ church
 they attended. The feeling seemed to be that whatever faith you found 
that helped you get through the day was valid, regardless of where you 
found it: finding it in Bruce just makes sense to his fans.<br>
One of the things I queried the cyber-site about was how many times 
people had seen Springsteen. Answers varied from once to over two 
hundred times, with a riotous variation between the two. Almost everyone
 collects “brucelegs” – bootleg recordings<br>
41<br>
made surreptitiously of Bruce’s live performances that stretch back to 
the late sixties. These brucelegs serve as a sort of communal offering, 
freely traded and supplied to the faithful, all done gratuitously. 
Indeed, those individuals who are found to be selling these recordings 
and videos are severely chastised and frequently excommunicated from the
 loyal Springsteen congregation. At the very least, the offender’s name 
is spread far and wide amongst the community, with his or her sins 
revealed to all via the electronic sources available to the fans- 
websites, cyber bulletin boards, and emails.<br>
This (mostly) unspoken ethical rule also applies to the reselling of 
tickets to concerts. Springsteen tickets are among the hardest concert 
tickets to come by, and because of this, fans who do manage to get 
tickets often will get more than they personally need. These “spare” 
tickets are then offered up at face-value or less to other fans. It is 
also not uncommon for fans to “faerie” (as these bestowers of spare 
tickets are called) others – to give away a ticket to a loyal disciple. I
 have been both the recipient and the faerie, receiving a coveted 
Christmas performance ticket from someone I never met, gratis, and 
likewise buying a ticket for someone, freely giving this to him. While 
it may be better to give than receive, receiving is definitely a joy not
 to be denied! At present, I am in receipt of a ticket for an Atlanta 
performance scheduled for late April sent to me by someone I know only 
by screen name, with the understanding I can pay him when I see him. I 
have no address, meeting place, or even a real name for this person! The
 community truly does operate on the principle of treating others as you
 would be treated. “The thinking is, if you’re a fan of Bruce, it means 
you can be trusted. You’re an honest person and you can sleep on my 
couch” (Perusse). The community works on this ethical principle, again 
assumed to be derived from Springsteen’s own actions. It is not<br>
42<br>
quite WWBD (what would Bruce do) but it is close to that. Fans who act 
outside of the accepted behavioral parameters and violate these 
“bruce-ethics” (my term, not commonly used by fans) are chastised as not
 being “real” fans, or not “listening” to Bruce; “real” fans act in 
accordance with the principles that they find in Springsteen’s music.<br>
“Everybody’s got a hungry heart”<br>
(Hungry Heart, 1980) “...when I see Bruce Springsteen reaching to his audience –<br>
to every corner of a large arena, to every mind in the hall – I find the
 kind of fulfillment and community that only the best friendships and 
kinships might bring one, which is to say, I see an oath of love and 
meaning played out with a full heart.”<br>
Mikal Gilmore (Marsh 2004: 433-34)<br>
While I have personally only witnessed concerts in three different 
countries – France, Germany, and the United States, I have nevertheless 
met fans from at least eleven different countries. The connection is the
 same with these fans as with my own countrymen and women – all things 
Bruce ties us together. Courtesies are extended and trust freely given, 
simply on the basis of our mutual membership in the Church of Bruce.<br>
My first experience meeting a foreign Bruce fan happened in 2004 
Northern Ireland. Through a mutual but equally unmet friend, I was given
 the name and phone number of a family living outside Belfast – husband 
and wife were both avid fans and members of a cyber bulletin board 
sponsored by Sony Music – brucespringsteen.net. In spite of our all 
being members of this site, I had never ‘spoken’ to J. or D. until we<br>
Comment [WFU1]: Connect this up to the page above.... It will make sense when you see the rest below<br>
43<br>
actually arrived in Northern Ireland. I called, introduced myself, and 
we made plans to meet that week. My traveling companion and I arrived 
early one afternoon at their lovely cottage, and immediately jumped 
head-first into Bruce-lore, comparing concerts and favorite songs. We 
had a wonderful time, and when we left we were no longer strangers.<br>
During a recent trip to Europe to observe Springsteen and fans, I met a 
number of fans from all over Europe, as well as some expatriate 
Americans. The language and emotions expressed echoed that of American 
fans, even if the audience responses differ slightly. (Euro-fans tend to
 be more enthusiastic and loud, waving and clapping in a hypnotic, 
synchronized fashion.) One German fan in front of me in line said that 
every man wants to be him while every woman wants to meet him. Another 
Danish fan who had driven eight hours to see a show in Berlin, and who 
had just finished driving another five to get to Cologne said he 
traveled to see Bruce as much as he could. I was also assured that the 
German audience at this show would make American audiences pale in 
comparison, a point of great pride for the Europeans. Hobbes, a German 
fan, proudly showed me a tattoo of Bruce’s signature right where he’d 
signed her arm. She expressed the idea that Bruce was her emotional and 
spiritual light in a dark reality.<br>
Aussiebrucefan, an Australian, is a drug and alcohol rehabilitation 
counselor who says he was attracted to Bruce because of the “music, 
lyrics, and social responsibility thing.” S. also from Australia, says 
she can’t wait to make the Asbury pilgrimage during the next tour. 
Springsteen has appeared in Australia and New Zealand, but not with any 
sort of regularity, and so fans ‘down under’ must travel to him. 
Corvettesue, from New Zealand says that “...integrity and Bruce” has 
given her a whole new life and many friends where she once had few. In 
talking, she also used the term “Church of Bruce,”<br>
44<br>
and when I commented that he did not give us actual direction, she 
vehemently replied “But he does.” These fans see the guidance and moral 
challenges set forth in Springsteen’s music as guidelines and 
suggestions for a mode of behavior in their personal lives, much as a 
member of any religious community follows the examples set by its 
spiritual leader. It is not necessary for Springsteen to say “This is 
what you must do or not do.” His songs, if examined as parables, contain
 their own moral, their own cause and effect outcome. Blueguitar, an 
American, had this to say:<br>
He was great, but flawed as we all are. He knew it, and wasn’t afraid to
 admit it. A rock and roller? Sure, but to me he was so much more. He 
inspired me to do more with my life, to go out into the world and make a
 difference. To do MY job a little better, just like he did. To know you
 had given your all, just like he did. I believe in the power and faith 
that Bruce Springsteen preaches about.<br>
Fan all4eddie took his autistic son to a recent concert, along with a particularly meaningful sign he wanted Bruce to read:<br>
Bruce stopped playing, read every word, and seemed to be a little choked
 up...then he reaches out and hands Eddie his harmonica, needless to say
 the tears began to flow, my hands were shaking as they are now 
retelling this story...our sign read “Your music taught our autistic son
 to speak.”<br>
Brianzai says Bruce provides “a place of mercy and healing.” Hanaree 
explains “ it again feels like God speaking directly to me through these
 words: I will provide for you/I’ll stand by your side/ you’ll need a 
good companion for this part of the ride...Bruce<br>
45<br>
provides spiritual connection.” BjorntorunMN told me that Bruce was the 
one thing that provided him comfort on “those dark nights” after a bad 
divorce and job loss. And Reverend Suzanne Meyer posits: “Bruce 
incarnates his message, becomes a conduit for hope” and calls his 
concerts “nothing less than revival meetings.” Clearly, for these fans 
Springsteen provides spiritual sustenance and all that implies: hope, 
understanding, forgiveness, and redemption as well as community and 
acceptance and a connection to something ineffable and greater than the 
sum of all these parts. Clearly, there is a spiritual element and energy
 here that works as well as any religious service.<br>
One of the common threads that run through most fan meet-ups is the 
initial ‘witnessing’ that takes place; each person wants to relate their
 conversion story, to share how they ‘came’ to Bruce. The discussions 
usually then migrate to “what’s your favorite song?” and “how many times
 have you seen him?” In an odd sort of way, these add social capitol to 
the exchange – the more shows, the greater number of “Bruce-points.” 
This also serves as a way of making an initial connection to each other,
 and in a way, validating one’s character. In short, the more avid a 
fan, the greater the internalization of the message conveyed through the
 performance, and therefore, the more trustworthy the person.<br>
When discussing any given show, fans will not only ask how the band 
sounded, but also what Bruce’s energy was like, as well as how the 
audience responded. Missed cues or sour notes play less into the fans’ 
enjoyment than the entire experience as a whole. Flaws in the 
performance sometimes actually seem to enhance the experience and make 
it more personalized. Seeing the human side of Springsteen and the band 
in the form of forgotten lyrics or missed cues comes to be endearing and
 relished as a shared human<br>
46<br>
experience between fan and performer. The feeling that Bruce is human, 
he is really one of us prevails, as does the idea that “we” are an 
important component of the performance. Outside of the concert hall, 
fans commune on-line at one of several cyber fan-sites<br>
discussing a myriad of topics, not all limited to Springsteen-world. The
 membership to these sites is free and most are open to anyone with the 
exception of several sites that are by invitation-only; memberships on 
these open sites number in the thousands. At <a href="http://www.greasylake.org/" class="postlink">www.greasylake.org</a>, membership stands at 11,392, while <a href="http://www.backstreets.com/" class="postlink">www.backstreets.com</a>
 boasts over 20,000. These cyber-communities offer a way to connect with
 like-minded people and talk. There are forums for discussing just-Bruce
 related topics and activities, forums for seeking and finding song 
chords for musicians, forums for acquiring copies of compact disks of 
entire concerts that have been surreptitiously recorded, and others for 
just general discussion and moral support. It is on these websites that 
the feeling of community becomes accentuated and nurtured. There are 
parties planned, softball games organized, and personal alliances set 
up. When a tour is in full-swing, fans ‘gather’ at their computers at 
the show time of whatever city Springsteen and company are performing in
 to await word of what is being performed, vicariously experiencing the 
show. Called the set-list watch, a fan at the concert text messages or 
calls someone else to post on the internet what is being played so that 
the ‘watchers’ can keep track of songs played. This functions as a kind 
of round-table, where small talk is exchanged and personal experiences 
shared while waiting the three to six minutes it takes for the present 
song to be completed. Fans also keep track of where those members 
present in the venue are in relation to the stage, which promotes a kind
 of vicarious experience. While nowhere close to the experience of being
 at the show, the set-list watch helps to expand<br>
47<br>
48<br>
each cyber participant’s knowledge of and relation to the other fans 
on-line participating. After the show, attendees will post their 
impressions and reviews for those who were not there, all of which 
serves to reinforce the inclusiveness and community on the ‘boards’ and 
in the greater Springsteen community.<br>
CHAPTER FOUR COMMUNITY IN THE SPRINGSTEEN FAN FAMILY<br>
“You can’t break the ties that bind...”<br>
(The Ties that Bind, 1980) Because the word ‘community’ is so often used, it is necessary to specify exactly<br>
how I am using it in the context of the Bruce Springsteen fan community.
 Social science literature provides many different conceptual ideas of 
what constitutes community. The term has been used in the past to 
identify an actual geographical location as well as to indicate a 
connection with others who share common customs and identities (Brown 
2002: 3). In his 1995 book, Amitai Etzioni described the important 
aspects of community: “What is needed, rather, is a strengthening of the
 bonds that tie people to one another, enabling them to overcome 
isolation and alienation...to establish in communities the moral voice 
that leads people to encourage one another to behave more virtuously 
than they would otherwise (iii).” In this sense, the Springsteen fan 
community definitely fits within the parameters of Etzioni’s 
description, and Bruce is that moral voice that ties us together.<br>
The fan community also occupies a geographical space, but that space is 
fluid, changing from one concert venue to another, in this sense 
creating a global community. The concert audience in any country will 
have fans from any number of countries who have traveled to see 
Springsteen and to meet others who share their love of his music. I have
 met fans from Denmark, Italy, England, Ireland, Sweden, Germany, 
Canada, Singapore and Australia at concerts in New Jersey, as well as at
 concerts in Cologne,<br>
49<br>
Germany and Paris, France. Indeed, I have met some of these same fans in New Jersey and Europe.<br>
If a ‘community’ needs a unifying principle, as some scholars have said 
(Keller 2003: 3), the Springsteen community has that in the music, 
performances, and person of Springsteen. Fans are able to overcome 
feelings of isolation, if only temporarily and occasionally, when in the
 presence, either real-time or cyber-time, of other fans who understand 
how they feel. Yet, some scholars have defined this feeling as 
communitarianism rather than community: “to qualify for community, 
social categorizations must be translated into a consciousness of a 
kind, a sense of belonging, and a shared identity, past or future 
(Keller 2003: <img class="smilies" src="_assets/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" width="15" height="15">.”
 Community is then concrete and rooted in place, while communitarianism 
is abstract and more a set of moral principles (Keller 2003: <img class="smilies" src="_assets/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" width="15" height="15">.
 The Springsteen fan community fulfills the criteria for both community 
and communitarianism, with the qualification of the fixed geographical 
space as defined above in the form of the concert arena; our shared 
identity is Bruce.<br>
However, we need to reconfigure the idea of community as requiring a 
location, and give consideration to the cyber-communities of which so 
many people are members. These on-line ‘communities’ help to fulfill the
 need we all crave to fill “...regardless of race, gender, culture, or 
social class: acceptance (Bugeja 2005: 1).” While people may want to 
posit that the age of technology has adversely affected us and created a
 sense of isolation, which it undoubtedly has, in this internet-age the 
network has become a hometown to some (Bugeja 2005: 3). “Neighbors” are 
as close as our keyboard and internet connection. This may be as good as
 it gets for those who immerse themselves in<br>
50<br>
video games and on-line communication, a surrogate for live, human connection. (Waldinger 2005).<br>
Springsteen fans make use of these virtual-communities – “social 
aggregations that emerge from the [internet] to form webs of personal 
relationships in cyberspace (Rheingold 1993: 5).” These cyber-sites are 
usually fan-run, and offer a glimpse into the Springsteen-fan world. 
They represent community, offering a unifying principle (Springsteen and
 his music) and filling a variety of functions. The fan-site serves as a
 place to discuss current and personal events, share emotions, get the 
latest updates on the musician’s activities and news, and to form 
friendships. Some fan-sites have extremely lively forums for political 
discussions that often become heated; mutual admiration does not 
necessarily translate into homogeneous politics!<br>
Writing about the Protestant Church in 1978, Wade Clark Roof describes the “primacy of belonging” aspect of community:<br>
Participation in the religious community exposes the believer to others 
sharing the faith, which, in turn, helps to reinforce personal 
commitments...religion fulfills a quasi-ethnic role in providing a sense
 of belonging, the meaning aspects of religion...intimately rooted in 
the belonging. (54).<br>
Following this reasoning, Bruce fans are therefore not only members of 
the same ‘church,’ but also their own ‘ethnic’ group, with a shared 
culture. Attending concerts reaffirms the belief in Bruce and in the fan
 community solidarity.<br>
51<br>
Several of the larger Springsteen fan cyber-sites are administered and 
moderated over by non-American fans (further indicating his popularity 
outside the United States). Cosmickid is the Danish architect and 
founder of one of the largest of these fan sites, greasylake.org. He saw
 his first Bruce concert in 1988 and was dramatically impacted by it:<br>
Something had changed in me. When I realized the possibilities of the 
Internet I knew I’d found my medium... Real people getting together over
 a shared passion. And real people, strangers, once again grabbing each 
other’s hands, if only virtually, just like I’d seen them do that night.
 ...a life-altering experience that I still feel today. It’s been one 
hell of a ride and still is.<br>
Cosmickid is only one of many fervent non-American followers, and he 
like many of the others has made the ‘pilgrimage’ to Asbury Park, and 
the legendary bar, the Stone Pony where Bruce was a regular fixture 
early on in his career. Visitors can take a tour of Asbury Park and 
Freehold, New Jersey, seeing the places mentioned in Springsteen’s 
earlier songs, and the sites of his youth (njrockmap.com). Almost every 
European fan that I have spoken with who has visited the United States 
has made a point to make this pilgrimage to eat pizza at Federici’s (a 
local pizzeria), have a beer at the StonePony, take their picture in 
front of Madame Marie’s fortune telling stand, and cruise down Kingsley –
 all places and things that have meaning for the fan, and are part of 
the Springsteen<br>
52<br>
mythology. These pilgrimages are not unlike the Holy Land tours I observed when in Israel.<br>
When asked what the internet fan community meant to the people 
frequenting these Springsteen websites, the responses I received 
indicated the similar and repeated belief that anyone who is a fan of 
Bruce is welcome. Likewise, the fans on these sites felt at ease, at 
home. “We are a group of people that share the same passion and love for
 Bruce...{the website bulletin board is} our home away from home if you 
will” (GL1). Attending concerts is likened to “...where you can meet and
 bond with total strangers...it is like nothing I have experienced”(GL2)
 Another fan says “...being in this community is like a 
neighborhood...when someone is in need there’s usually a great bunch of 
folks willing to step up” (btx1). The fans readily display the depths to
 which Springsteen has influenced them, and he is credited as such: “we 
all appreciate that Bruce has enriched our lives to a greater or lesser 
degree, to a point where people who have not yet ‘got Bruce’ will never 
understand” (GL4). Another member of greasylake.org says “I think of the
 ‘Radio Nowhere’ lyric, ‘trying to make a connection to you’ and I think
 that is what this community is about: human connection...TO BE TRULY 
ALIVE!” (GL5) Doah expresses his feeling particularly well, using the 
bible to support his vision:<br>
Now, outside of Greasy Lake and Springsteen, and the second I saw the 
word "community" in your post, the very first thing I think of is Acts 
2:41-42 and Acts 4:32-37. Those two passages are the most beautiful 
picture of a community I have ever read with things like, "fellowship," 
"shared meals," and<br>
53<br>
having things in common. Community, in general,<br>
is the best we can be a part of this side of Heaven. (GL 6)<br>
“And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one 
soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he 
possessed was his own; but they had all things in common.” (Acts 4: 32)<br>
The sense of community among Springsteen fans is palpable and across the
 board taken for granted, much as a member of a religious group takes 
for granted his or her fellow members’ beliefs. This fan society is 
indeed inclusive and embracing (Turner 1982: 51).<br>
One of the important things that the Springsteen fans – those active on 
these ‘boards’ as they are called – experience is their shared sense of 
‘getting it.’ Invariably, this term is always used when discussing the 
depths of feeling Springsteen and his music and performances elicit. 
Victor Turner called this spontaneous communitas, this “getting it,” and
 described it as “...a flash of lucid mutual understanding on the 
existential level. When even two people believe that they experience 
unity, all people are felt by these two, even if only for a flash, to be
 one” (1982: 47-48). In this way, fans relate directly to one another, 
free of “culturally defined encumbrances” (Turner 1982: 48). Turner 
calls communitas the “shared flow” (1986: 133), and this is indeed how 
it feels, an emotion flowing from one fan to another, an electric jolt 
of mutual understanding. Cultural differences fall away and become 
inconsequential and language is no barrier. There is something visceral 
and elemental also about this flash of instant communion.<br>
This “flow” translates into activities as diverse as strangers hugging 
during a particularly intense musical moment during a show, or in giving
 what the world outside the fan community would call a total stranger a 
ride to or from a show, or offering these strangers places to stay. It 
is evidenced in the free trading or giving away of concert recordings 
called ‘bootlegs;’ and this good will and shared emotional state 
ultimately creates the climate for the charity works done in Bruce 
Springsteen’s name.<br>
A more cynical – and hence, less fan-accepted – analysis is that a 
devotee of any particular cultural commodity is in actuality not a 
member of a real community, but rather a member of a 
consumption-community; the feeling of community lasts not much past the 
act of consumption itself (the concert), “...and then fades away, which 
is why we must consume repeatedly” (Joe). I feel it necessary here to 
emphasize that the speaker “Joe” is by his own admission NOT a ‘fan’. It
 is too simple an explanation, and while it may apply to concert-goers 
of other groups, the idea of community as an act of consumption does not
 hold up. Some fans on these websites have never seen a concert, only 
vicariously experiencing a live show through reviews or listening to 
brucelegs, yet still feel the inclusion of the community. And the 
demonstrable evidence points to the contrary – Springsteen fans conduct 
themselves as a community beyond and outside of the concert-going milieu
 and spread the good news.</div>

“American religion needs an American voice...As Jesus was a man of the 
people who spoke to them out of the experience of their day to day lives
 and proclaimed justice and freedom even in the midst of oppression – 
good news to the captive, etc. –<br>
so too must we listen for that liberating word in today’s vernacular.” (Reverend S. Meyer)<br>
A thoughtful and deliberate writer, Springsteen’s early lyrics center 
around themes familiar to and of concern to many people – belonging, 
inclusion, freedom, and future. These themes transcend age groups, and 
as one teenaged fan wrote: “What I love most about his music is I can 
hear him tell a story and yea I’ve been in that situation, and in some 
cases take advice he gave back in 1985 and apply to 2004...whenever I 
hear something in his music that I can relate to it draws me closer to 
it” (badscooter). ‘Converts’ see their own experiences reflected in 
Springsteen’s words. His honesty and the hope highlighted in his songs 
provide members of the ‘congregation’ with the tools – philosophy, 
philanthropy, compassion – to cope in an increasingly inhospitable 
society. Devotees find solace in these songs in much the same way that 
devoutly practicing religious people find solace in the sacred texts of 
their religions. There is a Springsteen line appropriate for most any 
event.<br>
As mentioned previously, Springsteen describes his music and songs as 
being “...not	literally	autobiographical...but	in	some	way	they’re	
emotionally<br>
56<br>
autobiographical...some emotional thread you’ve tried to use to make 
your own way through what can feel like a particularly imponderable 
existence” (Primeaux 1996: 8,17). In this we, his audience, can see 
ourselves. He is obviously not singing about himself, but about those 
people suffering, hurting and struggling in this ‘imponderable 
existence.’ It is this “empathetic identification,” this “reaching out 
to the other for the other” (Primeaux 1996: 96) that the fans respond 
to, coupled with his apparent authenticity and corresponding behavior. 
His fans in some fashion trust in his work as a reflection of the man, 
and appreciate his fierce commitment to his audience (Smith 2002: 123). 
It is also this identification that leads to the “works of faith” 
performed by a variety of the initiated, as described in the next 
chapter.<br>
Connecting Mr. Springsteen’s music to faith and spirituality is not 
difficult for one who has listened to his music, and indeed, numerous 
articles in both the popular press and professional journals by clergy 
and lay people alike attest to this. Biblical allusions abound in his 
lyrics while portraying themes of alienation and community, hope, 
betrayal, redemption, grace and generosity (Yamin 1990: 17). Sermons 
have been written using his lyrics (see appendix 2). While calling 
himself a ‘lapsed-Catholic,’ Springsteen seems unable – and unwilling – 
to escape his Catholic upbringing. Christopher Stratton, in his piece 
“Springsteen and the Minor Prophets” likens Bruce to Micah: both are 
seeking to imbue a nation with moral guidance, “drawing them back to 
God” and giving hope back to the people while proclaiming the 
“culpability of all” (2007). Stratton may be speaking in hyperbole when 
he proclaims, by quoting Abraham Joshua Heschel, that Springsteen is one
 “...whose image is our refuge in distress, and whose voice and vision 
sustain our faith.’ His red baseball cap and blue jeans are to America 
what camel’s hair<br>
57<br>
and locust were to ancient Israel” (2007). But to his fans, Springsteen 
does function as a source of both inspiration and solace. And yes, some 
do apotheosize him. As one fan said, “...in the end, the only church 
that’s ever worked for me is the Church of Bruce Springsteen...I don’t 
think he’s the Messiah, although he may very well be a Bodhisattiva” 
(Somerset 2007).<br>
Sowing Seeds of Spirituality: The Covenant<br>
“Show a Little Faith, There’s Magic in the Night” (Thunder Road 1975) “I
 know this is idealistic but part of the idea our band had from the 
beginning was that you did not have to lose your<br>
connection to the people you write for. I don’t believe that fame or 
success means that you lose that connection, and I don’t believe that 
makin’ more money means you lose it. Because that’s not where the 
essence of what you are lies. That’s not what separates people. What 
separates people are the things that are in their heart. So I can just 
never surrender to that idea. Because I know that before I started 
playing, I was alone. And one of the reasons I picked up the guitar was 
that<br>
I wanted to be part of something...and I ain’t about to give it up 
now...one of the things always on my mind to do was to maintain 
connections with the people I’d grown up with, and the sense of 
community where I came from...the danger of fame<br>
is in forgetting...” Bruce Springsteen (Marsh 2004: 315)<br>
58<br>
There is little doubt that a Springsteen concert awards the faithful 
with a sense of community and communion, if not holiness. This sense of 
connection that Springsteen mentions in the above quote works to form 
the basis of the covenant between Bruce and his fans, to never forget 
who and where he came from, and the debt and responsibility he owes his 
followers: to be honest and ‘true’ to his audience while expecting the 
same in return. And it is what creates the intimacy and sense of 
connection with Springsteen. This is also an oecumenical congregation, 
embracing all faiths. While the imagery in Springsteen’s songs is 
decidedly Christian, and more pointedly Catholic, the lyrics read in 
such as way as to be more inclusive should one choose to look past the 
Christian images. One long-standing and stalwart fan has written a book,
 “Greetings from Bury Park,” that details growing up Muslim in England, 
and how Springsteen played a part in his maturation (Manzour 2007). 
Another beloved fan tale tells the “parable” of a young man who met 
Bruce in a movie theatre and invited him home to meet his parents; this 
young man was an Orthodox Jew, wearing the garb of his sect. All are 
welcome in the Ministry of Rock and Roll, an embracing and inclusive 
congregation.<br>
Mircea Eliade said that the spiritual man lives near his sacred space to
 be closer to his God, to share the mystery and might of the “divine 
presence;” this is the spot where he can receive “the revelation of a 
reality” beyond that of his ordinary life (1959:24). Bruce has said that
 some people pray and some people play music (Yamin 1990: 3). The 
concert hall serves as Springsteen’s divine/sacred space, and he is able
 to pass this holiness on to his congregants, the faithful fans gathered
 for the ‘service.’ George Yamin, in the Journal of Religious Studies, 
says that Springsteen’s music is “nothing less than a modern-day 
theological epic – implicitly written in accordance with a single,<br>
59<br>
comprehensive design – in which Springsteen assimilates and 
reinterprets, in terms suitable for his listeners, many of the essential
 ideas of the Hebrew-Christian tradition” (Yamin 1990: 4).<br>
“Rock and roll,” says Danny Duncan Collum, “is a communal affair” (2000:
 55), and indeed Springsteen and his audience know this. This is the 
basis of the covenant Springsteen has implicitly made with his fans: 
“you be true to me, and I’ll be true to you.” He has stated time and 
again in numerous interviews that his is a job, and he owes his audience
 honesty and sincerity, as well as a damn good rock show. He seems self-
 reflective enough to realize and acknowledge that the fans are in part 
responsible for keeping his creative impulses flowing. “...I think 
that’s what people come for; they want to be lifted up and grounded at 
the same time...hey, you’re not alone, I’m not alone...” (Graff 2005: 
xx). When questioned about his absolute complete abandon in concert and 
why he seemed to give so much of himself, he answered:<br>
said:<br>
There may be no tomorrow...if you start rationing, you’re living life 
bit by bit...that’s what I get the most satisfaction out of: to know 
that tonight when I go to bed I did my best. If you go to the show, the 
kid has a ticket for tonight. He’s got no ticket for the show in L.A. or
 New York...You can’t live on what you did yesterday or plan what’s 
gonna happen tomorrow. That’s what rock ‘n’ roll is” a promise, an oath.
 It’s about being as true as you can be at any particular moment.<br>
(Cross 1989: 81) In concert during The Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, a more mature and older Bruce<br>
Our mission is a search for beauty, and in beauty there is<br>
60<br>
hope, and in hope there is some sense of divine love, of faith, of 
community and possibility, of things that would combat the brutality and
 the violence and the suffering. That’s what I’m trying to lay out 
there. It’s a survival guide.<br>
For many of his faithful, his music is exactly that – a survival guide 
fed on divine love. “I believe in the love that you gave me, I believe 
in the faith that can save me, I believe in the hope and I pray that 
someday it may raise me above these badlands” (Springsteen 2003: 71) – 
these words could be as easily directed to his God as well as his 
audience. And the audience responds as joyously as any congregation 
responding to the Gospel, the Q’uran, or any other sacred text or hymn.<br>
One group of dedicated fans from Northern California refers to itself, 
with more than a little seriousness, as the “Church of Bruce” (Sanders 
2003), a term echoed in other fan communities. “Bruce feeds my 
soul...it’s like a religion, you just can’t explain it,” says one fan, 
while another says “He gives us hope love and faith...it’s like church. I
 get spiritually uplifted” (Sanders 2003). The terms used by many fans 
when describing their Springsteen connection include hyperbolic terms 
such as transformative, life-changing, redemptive, and other expressions
 usually associated with a deeply religious experience.<br>
Good news, good works<br>
Of no small significance is the way in which fans also unite to help 
each other out. One of the members of the group mentioned above fell on 
hard times recently, losing health, employment, and housing. Unknown to 
this person, the group took up a collection and presented fan x with a 
sizeable check to help defray living expenses. And some years<br>
61<br>
ago, on the official Sony Springsteen website now lost to the Ethernet, 
brucespringsteen.net, one California fan was homeless and jobless as a 
result of devastating wildfires that had spread through Southern 
California. She posted her plight, and the members of a forum thread 
called “Tramps Like Us” took up a collection and sent money as well as 
catnip and cat food for the fan’s cat to help her through those hard 
times. This same group of fans also managed to get a Christmas tree and 
presents to a single-mom fan who’d recently lost her home and job. Other
 fans collect toiletries to send to military personnel in Iraq while 
maintaining a neutral position on the war itself. These supply drives 
and charitable collections could be the equivalent of the passing of the
 collection plate in other houses of worship.<br>
The Clergy is also represented among the Springsteen faithful. Reverend 
B. is the 44 year old senior minister at a Methodist church in North 
Carolina. A graduate of a Kentucky Baptist Divinity School, he chose to 
leave the Baptist church and become a Methodist minister after what he 
called a “fundamentalist takeover.” He and his wife have been 
Springsteen fans for over thirty years, and have seen any number of live
 shows. This April, Reverend B is planning a series of sermons and 
services crafted around the songs of Bruce Springsteen. (See appendix 2 )
 His church offers two services on Sundays: a 9am contemporary service, 
complete with a rock ensemble made up of congregation members, and an 11
 o’clock service that he termed more traditional. He has no qualms about
 conducting the 9 o’clock services, but says he is carefully weighing 
how to present the Springsteen songs to his more traditional audience. I
 asked him if he felt any misgivings about using contemporary rock songs
 within the context of his religious service, and he replied, “Not at 
all. Bruce speaks to the human condition that we all<br>
62<br>
experience; I will just need to present it more carefully at my later 
service.” He also believes that the music connects to “something 
deeper.” This plays into the supposition posited by Gordon Lynch that 
there is a longing felt by many people for a spirituality that is 
“liberated from the certainties of the institutional Church...” and who 
are looking for spiritual inspiration, for want of a better term, from 
someone who is more like themselves, someone with whom they can more 
readily identify (Lynch 2004: 163). The idea that a Springsteen concert 
can closely resemble a religious service – albeit a high-spirited one – 
did not seem like a foreign idea to Reverend B. I asked him why he chose
 Springsteen, and he replied because the music was fairly popular and 
referenced spiritual things in the lyrics. In the past, he has 
constructed sermons and services around other music and, given Bruce’s 
scheduled appearance in April, he decided that now was the proper time 
for Springsteen.<br>
Reverend B, who has a long-standing familiarity and love of 
Springsteen’s music, took his then 17 year old son with him to see The 
Rising Tour in Greensboro on December 8, 2002, and called it “One of the
 best nights I had with my teenager. When he went into ‘The Rising’ my 
son turned to me and said ‘Dad, I’ve never seen anything so amazing!’” 
He went on to speak about the healing that this particular tour and 
album provided for many fans after the horrific events of September 11, 
2001. Reverend B was so taken with the performance and the emotional 
fulfillment it provided that he went to see another show in Chapel Hill 
the following spring. (This is a repeated pattern amongst Springsteen 
fans, the need to see multiple shows on any given tour.)<br>
Reverend B also spoke about the shared – actual or assumed – character 
of mutual fans, and the trust this shared musical experience creates, 
echoing opinions of other fans<br>
63<br>
with whom I have spoken. Many devotees see a deeper meaning in their 
musical experience, citing the stimulus to “...never sit back...always 
remember that we are here for others, not just for ourselves. And I 
think that’s also a basic tenet of religion. I do good things because 
it’s the right thing to do...and I think that is a core of many songs 
(LOFG).” One practicing, deeply Christian fan told me:<br>
I realize that the joyful exuberance I feel at a Bruce Springsteen 
concert is God-given, just as Bruce’s creative genius and masterful 
performing skills are God-given. Just as I am made up of body, soul, and
 spirit in a way I can’t explain, but know to be true, Bruce’s songs 
connect with my spirit and thereby enrich my life. My life has followed 
the wonderful, fulfilling, surprising path that God, in His wisdom, has 
laid out for me. In some mysterious, unnamable fashion, Bruce 
Springsteen, the man, and his music has accompanied me along the 
journey. Perhaps that is why our creator God who made us in His image 
gave us the gift of art. I cannot imagine my life without the art of 
Bruce Springsteen. (jj)<br>
This ineffable quality again repeats in fans’ descriptions of what they 
hear and feel both in and through Springsteen’s music. (It is of 
interest to note here that the above quoted person is the mother of five
 and not your typical rock and roll fan – if there even is such a 
creature.) Other fans talk about Springsteen’s songs as “...God speaking
 directly to me through these words” (hanaree), or connecting them to 
“...a better/higher realization and<br>
64<br>
recognition” (yark). Hardgirloneasystreet says: “...I was truly in the 
church of Bruce. I believe that some people are put on this earth to 
unite us, move us, fill us with joy. That is Bruce.” Blueguitar had this
 to say about a recent show:<br>
He (Bruce) made his case for fighting back against the squalor with 
nothing but sweat drenched desire, his own personal fight to open the 
door and let people dance away their own demons with a physically 
demanding show that was touched with the stirring intellectuality and 
spiritual hope, all in the guise of a rock and roll show...Bruce used 
the echo and call to get them (the audience) to respond to him...Bruce 
sang, “It’s all right, it’s all right, it’s all right,” and the audience
 threw up their hands and yelled back “yeah,” a positive confirmation to
 counter this world of pain and negativity.<br>
In concert, Bruce can take his audience from “...hell to this blessed 
life...in the spiritual Church of Springsteen...the only redemption that
 matters is the “Beat of your heart, the beat of your heart, the beat of
 your heart” (blueguitar).<br>
The Reverend Suzanne Meyer, the Unitarian minister who sees Springsteen 
as the “America’s religious voice”, has also fashioned a service and 
sermon around Bruce Springsteen. (See appendix 3) In a personal email, 
she stated that the author “...of a new gospel is anyone who has the 
courage and conviction to step out of the crowd and speak the truth...” 
and she sees Springsteen as one of these messengers.	The	desire	to 
introduce family and friends to the experience of Springsteen’s live 
shows and to share<br>
65<br>
the emotional and spiritual connection is another common trait of the 
Springsteen fan community. While ‘finding’ Bruce may have been a 
solitary and individual experience similar to the Protestant “born 
again” conversion (Cavicchi 1998:43), the ‘convert’ now imbued with such
 joy wishes to share it. Every fan I have spoken with has related the 
experience of taking a close friend or loved one to a show in the hopes 
that lightening will strike, the uninitiated’s eyes will be opened, and 
another fan will be imbued with the joy and converted. In particular, 
many parents take their children in the hopes of creating that bridge of
 communication music can provide and facilitating their ‘conversion.’ I 
have met families of three generations of Springsteen fans at shows: Mom
 H. brought both her eighty-plus year old mother and teenaged daughter 
to a 2003 show in Boston. It is a common sight to see families in the 
audience with children of all ages. While in France to attend a concert 
in 2007, I met a family from the U.S. – Mom, Dad, and three pre-teen and
 teenaged children attempting to obtain tickets to the Springsteen show 
in Paris. Much like the joy that is found in a newly-embraced religious 
belief, sharing Bruce and watching the convert ‘get it’ creates a 
feeling of sanctity and holy gratitude.<br>
66<br>
CHAPTER SIX SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT – GOOD NEWS THROUGH SOCIAL JUSTICE<br>
“...and remember, nobody wins unless everybody wins”<br>
Bruce Springsteen in concert “Ye shall know them by their fruits.” Matthew7: 16<br>
On September 20, 1981, Bruce played a sold-out concert in Los Angeles, 
with all the proceeds going to the Vietnam Veterans Association, raising
 over a quarter of a million dollars: “Without Bruce and that evening, 
we would not have made it, we would have had to close down” said 
then-VVA president Bob Muller (Marsh 2004: 310). At the beginning of 
that night’s performance, Muller took the stage and addressed the 
audience. One particular poignant section of speech talked about the 
lack of help that the Vietnam Vets were getting from the government or 
private industry:<br>
It’s a little bit ironic that for the years that we’ve been tryin,’ when
 the businesses haven’t come behind us and the political leaders have 
failed to rally behind us that, when you remember the divisions within 
our own generation about the war, it ultimately turns out to be the very
 symbol of our generation – rock and roll! – that brings us together. 
And it is rock and roll that is<br>
going to provide the healing process that everybody<br>
needs. (Marsh 2004: 313). Without Springsteen, Muller says, there would have been no Vietnam Veterans movement (Marsh 2004:314).<br>
67<br>
This benefit was one of the initial examples of the “nobody wins unless 
everybody wins” tenet that was an often spoken line by Bruce while 
onstage during the mid to late eighties, the Springsteen equivalent of 
the Golden Rule, frequently repeated by his fans, and one he seems to 
take to heart. This line may also reflect a literal manifestation of 
what Bruce was – and still - is doing behind the scenes, and away from 
the public eye and tabloids. Springsteen has been privately and without 
fanfare supporting a number of charitable organizations over the past 
several decades.<br>
Prior to 1984, Springsteen and the E Street Band, or Springsteen solo, 
had appeared at several big-name rock and roll benefits. The near - 
catastrophic disaster at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island prompted a 
group of West Coast musicians to form MUSE – Musicians United for Safe 
Energy – and to organize an all-star fund raiser at Madison Square 
Garden in New York City in late 1979 that came to be known via album and
 video as No Nukes (Marsh 2003:214). While No Nukes was a moderate 
success, it was the Vietnam Vets’ benefit that seems to have been the 
real spiritual turning point for Bruce. In an interview with Rolling 
Stone Magazine’s Kurt Loder, Springsteen said:<br>
I want to try and just work more directly with people, try to find some 
way that my band can tie into the communities that we come into...human 
politics. I think that people on their own can do a lot...Where do the 
aesthetic issues that you write about intersect with some sort of 
concrete action, some direct involvement in the communities that your 
audience comes from? (Marsh 2003:489).<br>
68<br>
Springsteen and his management team began to search for groups around 
the country that benefited “the hungry, the homeless, and the 
unemployed” (Marsh 2003:489).<br>
This was done without fanfare and publicity, and to this day, it is 
difficult tracking all of Springsteen’s charitable donations. In each 
city he visited, he met with local groups, expressing his “concern for 
depressed conditions” in the communities, and presented them with a 
significant donation; there was a stipulation included with the 
donation, though, that the organization wait until after the first show 
to discuss the contribution (Marsh 2003: 498). [When asked by the press 
why he chose not to make a statement, his assistant Barbara Carr 
replied, “This is his statement” (Marsh 2003: 498).] He began making 
announcements from the stage encouraging his fans to get involved, 
either through donations, or by working with the organizations. At a 
show in Syracuse, New York he asked if anyone in the audience could 
donate a forklift to the new Food Bank of Central New York; within a 
week, someone did (Marsh 2003: 510). A favorite cause, and one that he 
still actively supports, the local food banks and representatives were 
invited to collect at each performance; tickets were also provided to be
 auctioned off with proceeds going to the food bank. These organizations
 helped the people that Bruce most related to, people who must have 
reminded him of his childhood and what his life could have been.<br>
These charitable connections happened, and continue to happen, in each 
and every city visited and in each and every country as well. In 
England, Springsteen contributed to a local miners’ union strike fund, 
donating some 16,000 pounds to the Miners’ Wives Support Group. In 
Australia, he donated to the Childrens Hospital/Youth Ward, the Prince 
Alexander Hospital Transplant Trust Fund, and the Vietnam Veterans<br>
69<br>
Association of Australia. In Japan, Springsteen’s people had to dig hard
 to find an appropriate social organization as food banks did not exist 
there; instead, he donated to a fund that helped “unmarriageable widows 
of men who had died in traffic accidents” (Marsh 2003:530). In Clifton, 
Arizona, Springsteen provided the means to keep the People’s Clinic open
 in a town ravaged by a years-long copper miners’ strike. Days away from
 closing, Bruce’s donation enabled the clinic to move to a better 
facility and remain open (Marsh 2003: 500). In Los Angeles County, he 
visited the union hall for steelworkers Local 1845 and participated in a
 theater workshop, leaving concert tickets for the union members (Marsh 
2003: 501).<br>
For Springsteen, the American Dream “...ain’t about two cars in the 
garage. It’s about people living and working together without steppin’ 
on each other” (Marsh 2003: 503-04). He literally put his money where 
his populist mouth was to the tune of $10,000 to $25,000 depending on 
the venue (Marsh 2003: 493-94). He continues to do this today, 
supporting the Second Harvest Food Banks as well as the Community for 
Fairness and Dignity for the Homeless, and the National Union for the 
Homeless, among other causes (See appendix 4 for a partial list of 
charities to which he now regularly contributes – some two dozen 
different organizations). Recently, a minister in North Carolina told me
 that each time Springsteen plays in the state, he donates $10,000 to 
the Christian Urban Ministry – but I was unable to verify this. It is 
policy apparently in the Springsteen management organization to decline 
to talk about what Bruce must see as a private matter. The best leaders 
lead by example, and Bruce has set the bar high; fans see his efforts to
 contribute to change and feel inspired to do so themselves – maybe not 
all fans, and not<br>
70<br>
to the extent that Bruce does, but we try and do what we can. “Nobody wins unless everybody wins.”<br>
More recently, it appears that Springsteen’s interest in, and support 
of, local food growing initiatives has been increasing. At a recent show
 in Rochester, New York (March 6, 2008), an organization called 
“Rochester Roots” had representatives collecting in the arena. When I 
approached a worker and attempted to find out if Bruce had made a 
monetary donation, the worker quite politely told me that she was not 
free to give me that information, consistent with Springsteen policy. 
This organization, according to their literature, is committed to 
creating a local and sustainable food system that is “nutritionally, 
ecologically, and economically sound” through education, advocacy and 
community development. They also run a school community garden project, 
turning underutilized schoolyards into urban gardens; at present, they 
work with three local elementary schools located in areas of Rochester 
“where food insecurity is high” (rochesterroots.org).<br>
In the same vein, a recent email alerted me to the news that 
Springsteen’s people had contacted a Greensboro grassroots group related
 to the University of North Carolina- Greensboro campus. Called Project 
Greenleaf (Greenleaf.uncg.edu), it is a similar type of program as the 
Rochester organization, and they have been invited to ‘pass the hat’ at 
the upcoming April 2008 show. Their website states:<br>
The mission of Project Green Leaf is to promote and support a local 
agro-food system. Project Green Leaf is dedicated to sustaining local 
agriculture by strengthening community between farmers and consumers, 
thus providing for better<br>
71<br>
quality of living. By promoting various activities, such as direct 
marketing and educational/outreach programs, we assist in developing the
 connections necessary for a local agro-food system.<br>
According to Project Greenleaf’s founder, the Springsteen representative
 who made contact stated that Greenleaf was “the wave of the future.” 
These initiatives are in line philosophically with the organizations in 
which Bruce has historically been interested, organizations that allow 
people to help themselves.<br>
In addition to the food bank donations all over the country, Springsteen
 also gives freely of his services in diverse settings and for diverse 
reasons. He has performed benefits to keep a struggling magazine afloat 
(Pulitizer prize winning author Robert Cole’s “Double Take”), to buy 
uniforms and instruments for the Asbury Park High School marching band 
as well as emergency medical equipment for the local rescue squad 
(Christmas shows), for his children’s school (Rumson County Day School),
 for the Light of Day foundation which funds Parkinson’s Disease 
research, and for the Kristen Ann Carr Sarcoma Fund, as well as a fund 
raiser in Pittsburg after floods there in 2004. Rarely will Bruce appear
 at the more celebrity-laden charity events.<br>
This idea of sharing the best of ourselves, to help “everybody win,” can
 be seen in the number of charitable events and organizations organized 
in Springsteen’s name. One such site is run by the Orel family who also 
host a website with many different kinds of Springsteen trivia and 
information (matt.orel.ws/index.html). But additionally, the Orel family
 has made an arrangement with the website amazon.com to act as a portal 
to Amazon. Any purchases made by using the Orel link to Amazon result in
 a commission<br>
72<br>
that the Orel family then matches and donates to a charity favored by 
Bruce Springsteen. (See appendix 5 for an accounting from the fourth 
fiscal quarter of 2005 through the third fiscal quarter of 2007). For 
the first three quarters of 2007, this family distributed $265 to three 
different charities. You can also read reviews of some of the several 
dozens shows that Matt, the webmaster and involved Springsteen fan, has 
attended.<br>
Dedicated fans following Springsteen’s example have organized and made 
sizable donations to a number of charities. Prior to a recent show in 
Buffalo, New York, members of the website backstreets.com organized a 
pre-show party. Fans signing up for the party paid ten dollars, and this
 got them a name tag with their screen name on it and assorted 
appetizers. People had donated a variety of items to be raffled off, and
 the proceeds of this raffle, along with the ten dollar fees minus the 
restaurant bill, was donated to the Western New York branch of Second 
Harvest Food Bank – some $500.00. As mentioned previously, at a 2003 
show, I was able to collect nearly $2000 in a matter of minutes at a 
tailgate party of another website, greasylake.org. Currently, 
backstreets.com members are sponsoring a women’s build day at a Habitat 
for Humanity site in New Jersey; twenty women have signed up to help 
build this house, the maximum number of volunteers Habitat can handle 
that day.<br>
One of the most ambitious of the fan initiatives is the “Bruce Sent Me” campaign (<a href="http://www.brucesentme.com/" class="postlink">www.brucesentme.com</a>). To quote from the website,<br>
“The idea is to demonstrate in a tangible way what a difference the 
music we love can make in the world... ‘WITH THESE HANDS’ we are making a
 difference. Bruce Sent Me is not interested in collecting your money.<br>
73<br>
We simply want to inspire you to share and to look out for those less 
fortunate. We were moved by Bruce's encouragement to "rise up" and we 
are simply here to pass that thought along. Although Bruce Springsteen 
is not affiliated in any way with Bruce Sent Me (if you're looking for 
his official site, a link is provided below), we'd like to believe he 
approves of the way we heeded his advice. If you feel it too, please 
share this idea with others in any way you feel comfortable. To borrow a
 phrase from<br>
the Boss, "Turn it up!" (note: “Turn it up” is a line from “Mary’s Place)<br>
The idea for “Bruce Sent Me” had its birth in a posting on the fan site 
Backstreets.com encouraging fans to heed Bruce’s evening ‘public service
 announcement’ as he called it, and donate to suggested charities. 
Within days, thousands of dollars were raised (Brucesentme). A notice on
 the home page of the site says succinctly that “Bruce Sent Me is not 
interested in collecting your money. We simply want to inspire you to 
share and look out for those less fortunate.” Were it not for the 
concerned spirit of Bruce himself, it is doubtful that this site would 
exist. Shortly after its inception and just prior to Thanksgiving, the 
only refrigerated truck owned by the Community Food Bank of New Jersey 
was involved with an accident on the New Jersey Turnpike, losing its 
entire shipment of 2000 turkeys targeted for needy families. Within a 
week, Bruce Sent Me raised $6000 to assist in the replacement of the 
truck and the Thanksgiving turkeys (Strauss 2003: 1). (Note: Bruce 
himself has been known to simply drop in to the warehouse of the food 
bank to help unload trucks.) Links on the Bruce Sent Me site take one 
directly to America’s Second Harvest Food Banks website, where the food 
bank has arranged that donations can be acknowledged as Bruce Sent Me 
donations (<a href="http://www.secondharvest.org/how_to_help/Bruce_Sent_Me.html" class="postlink">http://www.secondharvest.org/how_to_hel ... nt_Me.html</a>).<br>
What, really, can be more spiritual than doing ‘good works,’ to treat 
each human being with the dignity and respect awarded them by the 
Creator? Words come cheaply, but actions again can be love made 
manifest. These deeds are all a direct result of fans being touched by 
Bruce’s music and more pointedly his humanity and compassion; this is a 
tangible way for fans to honor their avatar. Without his example, likely
 none of this fan- sponsored altruism would take place.<br>
And faith will be rewarded sometimes: on July 31, 2004, during a Habitat
 for Humanity work day organized by btxers, as members of the 
backstreets.com website are known, Springsteen showed up to share pizza 
and beers at the end of the day (Celano 2004. see photo in appendix 2). 
Whether by word, music, or deed, Bruce serves as a moral compass in some
 fashion for his followers, reminding us that we are, indeed, our 
brothers’ keeper, and we are all out here on this road together.</div>

“I’ll work for your love, dear, I’ll work for your love”<br>
(I’ll Work for Your Love, 2007)<br>
To understand the emotional depths of fan involvement in the community 
both actual and virtual, it is best to hear what fans have to say 
themselves, to hear their witnessing and conversion stories as they tell
 them in their own words. The stories all have a familiar ring and 
progression: alone, hearing a song that strikes a chord, experiencing a 
sudden epiphany and realization of joy – again, not unlike my experience
 being saved at a Billy Graham Crusade. And this also feeds into the 
sense of shared experience, knowing that fellow fans have felt this way,
 have been hit by the same bolt of Springsteen. The only identification 
used for these stories are screen names used on internet bulletin 
boards. Some of these stories deserve to be told unedited, while others 
will be excerpted. The names used are the screen names used on-line. 
SpringsteenMagic:<br>
When I was born, my parents – especially my father – were huge Bruce 
fans. I grew up on his music...the first song I remember my dad playing 
for me was “Thunder Road”, on the Greatest Hits CD. As I grew up, I 
learned to appreciate the music more and more. My dad was diagnosed with
 MS before I was born. As I got older, he began to get sicker, and was 
eventually<br>
put in the hospital, unable to walk or use his arms. My sister and I were there with him all the time and he would always<br>
76<br>
ask my mom to put on his Bruce CDs. The Rising album came out when he 
was in the hospital, and I still remember listening to it with him for 
the first time. I can’t really describe it, but I remember not saying a 
word the whole time the album ran...Bruce began to be extremely 
important to me...I began to start my own Bruce collection, and his 
music helped me a lot when my dad was sick. My father passed away almost
 three years ago, and The Rising was<br>
the album that got me through it. Some of my best times with my dad I 
associate with Bruce, because his music was always in the background. I 
remember his face when his cousin brought him a t-shirt from The Rising 
tour...I hadn’t seen him smile like that in a while. Hearing “Thunder 
Road” live in Hamilton was absolutely incredible – I couldn’t help but 
cry, I was extremely moved, and felt like my dad was there somehow. The 
last few years have been rough for me, and I can honestly say that – at 
times – as strange as it sounds, I felt like Bruce was my best friend, 
and the only one who understood what I felt, because I heard it all in 
his songs. So as much as I love the rock ‘n’ roll aspect to his songs, 
the words that he has written have meant so much more to me, and really 
helped shape who I am today.<br>
77<br>
This notion of Bruce “understanding” who his fans are, what they are 
going through, is a strand that runs through many fan stories and no 
doubt accounts for much of the emotional attachment many fans feel. The 
question of whether this is true is insignificant to the feeling.<br>
Passiac factory says that a Springsteen performance gives “...a chance 
for my old heart to beat young again...”. Misadventure says the shows 
are “...communal rituals...it’s not unlike church. It’s also a sort of 
contact – communion. Bruce responds to his audience...he feeds off of us
 and we feed off of him.” Another younger fan, Doah, says:<br>
It’s not just simply good rock ‘n’ roll. I find it more like a spiritual
 experience. I would also swear that there’s some sort of chemical 
reaction that occurs in my body that causes euphoria! I know I’ve 
mentioned the “spiritual” word to you before, but I mean it. The only 
other analogy I can come up with is a drug. My wife has asked me before,
 “honey, do you have to see him more than once a week? You’re seeing him
 Monday, why do you have to see him on Tuesday?” I’m like, Well, does a 
heroin addict say, “you know, I already shot up last night so I think 
I’ll pass tonight.” I don’t think so!<br>
Again, the experiencing of euphoria is also something found in the 
evangelical experience of being ‘born again.’ In this sense, fans are 
‘born anew’ at each performance they attend. Other comments state that 
seeing Springsteen recharges spiritual and emotional batteries.<br>
78<br>
The faithful all have a ‘come-to-Bruce’ story that usually involves 
hearing a particular song for the first time. “I went home and put on 
side one...I didn’t play anything but side two for a month” (diane). 
Some stories are a bit more involved and poignant, such as NC’s:<br>
In Dec. 1980 I moved to Palmer Alaska. I was miserable because I had to 
leave my school &amp; friends. I hated it here. It was a small town 
about 40 miles from Anchorage. The night before John Lennon was shot 
(note: 12/8/80)<br>
I was in my room and found on the top shelve of my closet and old clock 
radio. I remember the color was a god-awful dull yellow. Wasn’t sure if 
it even worked but I plugged it in. Sure enough it worked. I was able to
 pick up an album oriented rock station out of Anchorage. At 10:00 pm 
every Sunday they would play an album in its entirety. As fate would 
have it that Sun. night they played The River. BOTH ALBUMS! Anyway, That
 night I was in my room with the lights off and the curtains open 
watching the aurora borealis and I listened to every song... every word.
 Sometimes I think back and wonder what if I<br>
had not found that old clock radio in my closet. Redheadfromtoronto remembers hearing the title song from the album mentioned<br>
above, The River, on her grandmother’s white kitchen radio, and being 
“haunted by the ending.” “Now those memories come back to haunt me, they
 haunt me like a curse. Is a dream a lie if it don’t come true, or is it
 something worse...”<br>
79<br>
Leahinjersey says she first identified with the Tunnel of Love album, 
written during a time of emotional turmoil for Springsteen: “I was going
 through a divorce from my first husband, some major depression...”. 
Whoresandgamblers story started with the Live 75-85 set of albums: “the 
songs the stories of teenage angst. Dedicating a song to the young 
people ‘Because the next time they are going to be looking to you, and 
you will need a lot of information to know what you are going to 
do.’...Everything was like Bruce a speaking directly to me.” Some years 
later, this man and his wife were separating, and he:<br>
...grabbed a random tape and stuck it in. “Darkness” (note: Darkness on 
the Edge of Town, from the album of the same name) was playing and while
 I had heard the song many times before, something struck a chord in the
 lyrics to that song. Suddenly my Bruceness<br>
was rededicated. LINYC (Live in New York City, a dvd) picked up where 
Live 75-85 left off. It was different, things had changed people had 
grown up, but Bruce was there singing directly to me and knowing exactly
 what I needed to hear. It took me to 2002 to get<br>
to a live show but I have since been to 8. Bruce music has been the soundtrack of my life.<br>
BigOldDinosaur says that after seeing a show, “...I was completely 
hooked. I’d never seen someone perform with such energy, just laying it 
all out there like that. 4 days later I went to Utica, and the odyssey 
had begun and is still continuing 160+ shows later.”<br>
80<br>
And chestercat, a late-comer to the fold has this to say about her first
 concert at the age of forty in 2002: “A couple of bars into the first 
song, I got hit by something. I started to sob and cried pretty much 
through the whole thing. Roostershmoo and I went back the next night...”
 Other fans speak of being “baptized in the fires of the majesty, the 
ministry of rock ‘n’ roll.” The passion and fervor that fills these 
fan-recollections is obvious and potent, and reminiscent of the 
religious fever of a revival meeting. The sentiments of unigus sums up 
the feelings of most in the Springsteen community, but more pointedly 
those participants on the various internet sites:<br>
Bruce has always been the soundtrack of my life...he has always 
vocalized my thoughts, fears, hopes, and dreams. His songs always remind
 me of people and places, connecting me in ways I never would have 
fathomed, bringing me to a better/higher realization and recognition...I
 am so thankful that I’m in the presence of friends that I will never 
have to explain that to cause you to GET IT.<br>
This is one common sentiment repeated over and over by fans, regardless 
of their geographical location, gender, sexual orientation or social 
class - that Bruce has provided them with the soundtrack of their lives,
 Bruce ‘understands’ them. Close to fifty percent of all fans I have 
spoken with over the years have expressed these feelings.. Given that 
Springsteen has long been called the quintessential ‘American’ artist, I
 found it curious that fans in other countries would also feel this way.
 The American love affair with the automobile, and the car imagery in 
Springsteen’s songs do not seem very European. Invariably, however, when
 I questioned fans in Germany and France about this, and what they found
 to identify with in Bruce’s music, their answers dismissed his 
‘American-<br>
81<br>
82<br>
ness’ and focused on his humanity and the greater human themes of love 
and sorrow, rejection and redemption, fulfillment and disappointment.<br>
CHAPTER EIGHT CONCLUSION<br>
“Tomorrow There’ll be Sunshine and All this Darkness Past”<br>
(Land of Hope and Dreams, 2001)<br>
“Now I’m out here on this road, alone on this road tonight<br>
I close my eyes and feel so many friends around me in the early evening light.<br>
And the miles we have come, and the battles won and lost<br>
Are just so many roads traveled, and just so many rivers crossed.<br>
And I ask God for the strength and faith in one another<br>
‘Cause it’s a good night for a ride ‘cross this river to the other side<br>
My blood brothers.”<br>
(Blood Brothers, 1995)<br>
This thesis has documented the ways in which fans have created a 
community and a spiritual home for themselves, open and welcoming to all
 those likewise inspired by the words, music, and deeds of Bruce 
Springsteen. Springsteen has himself laid the groundwork for this and 
consequently can claim some credit for the positive ways in which his 
fans are working towards maintaining this community and doing good work 
in the world. To paraphrase Springsteen: the world we carry in our 
hearts is waiting, we just need to help manifest its potential 
greatness. By their own accounts, these congregants have been supplied 
with spiritual/emotional sustenance, gaining solace and companionship in
 some fashion equal to the comfort and companionship provided by church 
congregations or ministerial counseling. Bruce says this is his job:<br>
That’s my business, that’s what it’s all about – trying to<br>
83<br>
connect to you. It comes down to trying to make people happy, feel less 
lonely, but also about being a conduit for a dialogue about the events 
of the day, the issues that impact people’s lives, personal and social 
and political and religious. That’s how I always saw the job of our 
band. That was my service...I can’t do it by myself. I need my 
audience.. You’re in that room together, that dark room together. (Levy 
2007: 52).<br>
For this man Bruce Springsteen, rock ‘n’ roll is serious business, 
sacred business. “What are the things that bring you ecstasy and bliss, 
what are the things that bring on the darkness...what can we do together
 to combat those things?” (Levy 2007:52). His music and performances 
serve as a conduit for the faithful to that larger sense of the divine, 
the light that counters the darkness, the vehicle for some of that 
ecstasy and bliss we all need in our lives. And if the truer measure of 
religion is found in what it does for its believers rather than what it 
is, then fans really are closer to being a congregation than a mere 
audience (Mazur &amp; McCarthy 2001:5). For those without close 
religious affiliations, this connection with Springsteen and fellow fans
 presents a way out of isolation and alienation and a way into 
relationship, a refuge and solace from everyday life every bit as 
legitimate and meaningful as any religious institution. What Bruce has 
in common with all of the great religious leaders throughout time is his
 way of speaking. Ultimately, when talking about spiritual leaders, we 
are talking about story-tellers. Buddha, Jesus, Mohammed – their stories
 captured the people, drew them in and left them open to the higher 
truths of existence and faith. And if there is one thing that Bruce 
Springsteen is, it<br>
84<br>
is a storyteller of the people. As Sarfraz Manzoor, a Muslim and devoted
 Springsteen disciple says, Springsteen fans are “defined not by 
geography, race, or religion, but by passion” (2007:103). Bossfan950 
sums it up:<br>
In our world of Bruce we get to forget our problems for 2 and a half 
hours or so. We hide on the backstreets and as dogs on Main Street howl,
 we howl and dance and sing and hug and love and live and die in the 
company of our blood brothers and sisters.<br>
Thank you Bruce and thank you my blood brothers and sisters for being 
with me on this part of the ride. We may all agree to disagree. We have 
our fights. But in the end we all share the music, a bond that we may 
bend but we cannot and will not break.<br>
“Tonight my baby and me we’re gonna ride to the sea,<br>
and wash these sins off our hands.”<br>
(Racing’ in the Street, 1978)<br>

<br>
By JON PARELES, Special to the New York Times<br>
Published: February 27, 1988<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen wants to grow up, settle down and remind his huge 
audience that there's no escape from responsibility. ''One of the 
hardest things for me over the past 10 years,'' he said Thursday as he 
introduced and partly disavowed a song from 1975, ''Born to Run,'' ''has
 been trying to understand what growing up and being a man is all about -
 trying to make some kind of home for myself and then trying to hold on 
to it.''<br>
<br>
But he also wants to rock out, and for Mr. Springsteen, the two goals 
are almost always at odds. In the opening show of his first United 
States tour since 1986, which immediately sold out the 13,000-seat 
Centrum here, he did his duty by the somber, fatalistic ballads about 
uncertain love and diminishing prospects that have filled his albums 
since the 1978 ''Darkness on the Edge of Town.'' And a supercharged rock
 and soul finale turned the last half-hour of the nearly three-hour show
 into a rip-roaring, cinderblock-shaking jubilee.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen's past tours have earned him a reputation for 
indefatigable showmanship and anthemic sing-alongs. The current tour 
still includes dramatic monologues, songs not available on his albums, 
sing-alongs, oldies, occasional band shtick and a re-enactment of the 
''Dancing in the Dark'' video clip. Once he had documented his concerts 
on the five-LP set ''Live: 1975-1985,'' however, Mr. Springsteen scaled 
down the arrangements and changed subjects for his 1987 album, ''Tunnel 
of Love.'' His early albums were about boyish dreams; his next ones were
 about men's work; ''Tunnel of Love'' is about men and women who are in 
love or married but not living happily ever after. Most of the songs are
 midtempo ballads or pop-rock hymns: ruminations on love, not anthems.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen performed eight songs from ''Tunnel of Love,'' and from 
the rest of his catalogue, with a few exceptions (including a searing 
version of ''Seeds,'' about migrant workers stranded by the Texas oil 
bust), he's chosen songs about relationships rather than economic 
troubles. Where he used to end his concerts with, ''I'm a prisoner of 
rock-and-roll,'' he now shouts, ''I'm a prisoner of love!''<br>
<br>
Most of the songs have an earnest, troubled tone, and it's not easy to 
build a rock-and-roll show around them. The music is solid and assured. 
Mr. Springsteen plays cutting lead-guitar lines, and his E Street Band 
and a five-man horn section recruited from the Asbury Jukes fill out the
 arrangements with warm keyboard sounds and horn-section chords.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen has taken to heart his responsibilities as a 
mass-audience performer. Unfortunately, his good intentions can make him
 didactic. Where his older songs were kaleidoscopic in everything from 
vocal delivery to arrangements to wordplay, his newer songs are 
virtually monochromatic; Mr. Springsteen stands still, sings in one tone
 - a moan or a rasp or a choked-back croon - and links images to deliver
 a parable. The songs are well made, with memorable keyboard mottoes and
 telling images, but their earnestness undermines them.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen hasn't entirely misplaced his sense of humor. In the 
second half of the concert he came up with ''Part Man, Part Monkey,'' a 
reggae-style defense of Darwin, and ''I'm a Coward When It Comes to 
Love,'' which crossbreeds ''Rockin' Pneumonia'' and Gino Washington's 
''Gino Is a Coward'' and states his latest themes with comic hyperbole. 
He also reclaimed his own ''Light of Day'' from the Paul Schrader film, 
and for his encores he revived the wild, woolly ''Rosalita'' and a 
soul-oldie medley including ''Devil With a Blue Dress On,'' ''Shake'' 
and more. By then he was racing around the stage and even dancing on Roy
 Bittan's piano.<br>
<br>
Clearly, Mr. Springsteen is grappling with the demands of maturity. 
Songs like ''Part Man, Part Monkey'' suggest that, at least part of the 
time, he knows he doesn't have to be solemn to be serious.</div>

				<div class="content">Reviews/Music; Springsteen at the Garden<br>
<br>
By STEPHEN HOLDEN<br>
<br>
Published: May 17, 1988<br>
<br>
''There comes a time when you've got to take the past and put it behind 
you,'' Bruce Springsteen said at Madison Square Garden last night during
 the opening show of his ''Tunnel of Love Express Tour.'' Mr. 
Springsteen's reflection was part of a monologue that introduced a 
powerful, hard-edged new rock song, ''Spare Parts,'' about young love, 
pregnancy and abandonment, but his words also evoked the transitional 
position in which America's quintessential rock hero finds himself.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen is no longer a romantic rock-and-roll cutup striking 
rebel poses and evoking a world of youthful fuel-injected passion. Now 
38 and married, and having left the New Jersey shore for a home in New 
York City, he is an adult who maintains a kid's enthusiasm for rock 
while trying to make grown-up sense out of relationships and the social 
order.<br>
<br>
As the wonderful new songs in the ''Tunnel of Love'' album demonstrate, 
Mr. Springsteen has entered a new phase. These songs are the first in 
which he takes a hard look at the reality of personal relationships, 
sorting through all the ambiguities of love - commitment and fear, 
security and boredom, sexual selfishness and emotional generosity. He 
finds the terrain perilous and unpredictable, yet manages to remain 
affirmative, in much the same way that ''Born in the U.S.A.'' 
scrutinized ordinary lives caught in the vise of social upheaval, yet 
managed to sound optimistic. Mr. Springsteen is, as he once wrote, a 
believer in ''The Promised Land.''<br>
<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen's gift is his ability to translate all of these 
ambiguities into basic, non-analytical argot that speaks as much to the 
body and the emotions as to the mind. In concert, he has also figured 
out how to string songs into extended journeys that take on a cumulative
 power as the evening proceeds. His ''Tunnel of Love Express Tour,'' 
which is to play four more Garden shows, all of them sold out, might be 
described as a serious carnival ride from confusion into jubilation.<br>
<br>
Last night's first set, which opened with the new album's title song, 
tunneled into the heart of darkness and reached depths of anguished 
frustration in ''Seeds'' and ''Roulette,'' the howling laments of 
working men victimized by social change. The second set, which included 
such Springsteen classics as ''I'm On Fire,'' ''Born to Run,'' ''Dancing
 in the Dark'' and ''Hungry Heart,'' was more upbeat, with Mr. 
Springsteen poking fun at television evangelists and delivering 
rollicking renditions of ''Glory Days'' and ''Rosalita'' - raucous, 
punchy songs with a nostalgic clout.<br>
<br>
The locomotive-driven arrangements by Mr. Springsteen and members of the
 E Street Band, augmented by a roaring five-man horn section, skillfully
 underscored the songs' deeper themes without ever seeming fussy. The 
keyboard textures on ''Tunnel of Love'' and other songs walk a perfect 
tightrope between churchy seriousness and carnival sleaze, and the 
jackhammer rhythms of ''Roulette'' evoke both patriotic zeal and 
murderous fantasy.<br>
<br>
Drawing just the right shadings was Mr. Springsteen's magnificent 
performance, almost operatic in its oratorical power and at the same 
time a ferociously joyful roar of exuberant freedom. While he's onstage,
 Mr. Springsteen reconciles seemingly unreconcilable concepts: a sober 
awareness of social and erotic realities and a boundless faith in life.</div>
