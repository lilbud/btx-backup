<br>
By Sarfraz Manzoor</strong><br>
Daily Telegraph (UK)<br>
<br>
September 23, 2014<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen turns 65 today. This barely seems believable; I was 16
 when I first discovered his music so that would make me 43, which also 
does not seem possible.<br>
<br>
In my book Greetings from Bury Park, I have written about how 
Springsteen exerted a huge influence on my young life. When I was a 
teenager, he was a role model because his songs carried the promise of 
an optimistic future, a promise that would be honoured if you worked 
hard, stayed true to your ideals and, in the words of one song, were 
prepared for the price you pay.<br>
<br>
His music was not suffused with cynicism; these were songs that provided
 a map that I believed could guide all of us who hailed from 
unprivileged families in unpromising towns towards the Promised Land. 
Springsteen inspired me in my youth, but unlike so much of what I 
listened to then, Springsteen has not been discarded; he has more to say
 to me now I am a middle-aged man than he did when I was a boy.<br>
<br>
I recently had some bad news and I was feeling pretty low. The future 
seemed uncertain, and not in a good way. I was wondering if my best days
 were behind me. What could I do? <br>
<br>
I had written and performed a one-man showwhich argued that it was 
possible to find the answer to all of life’s questions by consulting the
 lyrics of Bruce Springsteen. That had been a cute pitch for the show, 
but was it true? I rifled through my Springsteen albums and eventually 
settled upon the title track to his 2012 album Wrecking Ball. That album
 has been described as Springsteen’s most political record, but 
listening to it I heard something else. "Bring on your wrecking ball," 
Springsteen sings. "Come and take your best shot, let me see what you’ve
 got, bring on your wrecking ball." This was a song about a man 
declaring he is not going to lie down and let life kick him around. The 
wrecking ball could be an employer, a former lover or maybe time itself.
 I listened to that song and it made me feel better and it got me off 
the floor.<br>
<br>
In youth Springsteen’s songs offered hope; in middle-age they offer defiance. <br>
<br>
They say that the story is not yet fully written and there is time to 
still add new chapters. Springsteen has in the last year directed a 
short film, has been involved in writing a children’s book based on one 
of his songs, and has made his first cameo appearance in a television 
drama. He seems less worried now about trying new things than he did in 
when he was in his twenties and thirties.<br>
<br>
In music, he is more productive than ever: in the last 12 years he has 
released seven albums - the preceding 12 years produced only three. The 
quality of the work has not been as astonishing as during the Seventies,
 but the best of it can easily stand alongside his earlier work, and as a
 live act he remains unsurpassed.<br>
<br>
He could easily spend his days in his big house counting his money, so 
what drives him to keep pushing? I think it is the same reason he 
continues to look ridiculously good for his age.<br>
<br>
It is a desire to be the best version of himself at any given time. That
 means remaining creatively and politically engaged with the moment. His
 music charts the changing fortunes of the United States during the last
 four decades - the eighties recession produced Nebraksa, the Presidency
 of (the first) George Bush led to The Ghost of Tom Joad, 9/11 inspired 
The Rising and the most recent recession was depicted in Wrecking Ball. 
He has not become a nostalgia act, content to, in the words of another 
song, give his audience nothing more than "boring strories of glory 
days".<br>
<br>
When I was young, Springsteen’s love songs gave me a glimpse of what 
love could feel like. That hyper-romantic stuff does not quite ring so 
true these days, but what now appeals to me are the songs about a more 
mature love. In 1975’s Born to Run he was telling his lover "we can live
 with the sadness, I'll love you with all the madness in my soul". By 
1992 he was acknowledging that "everyone dreams of a love lasting and 
true, but you and I know what this world can do." That was in a song 
called If I Should Fall Behind, about the promises we make to each other
 when we commit. It was one of the readings at my wedding.<br>
<br>
By 2009’s Kingdom of Days, Springsteen’s writing on love had evolved 
still further. "When I count my blessings and you’re mine for always," 
he sings, "we laughed beneath the covers and count the wrinkles and the 
grays". Springsteen is the perfect role model for the middle-aged 
because his music has detailed how love changes over time.<br>
<br>
Springsteen has been married to Patti Scialfa for 24 years. He lives 
close to the town where he was born and is, based on every account and 
story I have read, a thoroughly decent and grounded fellow. He has 
managed the trick - one that we all aspire to - of making his work and 
his passion one and the same, and when gets on stage he is accompanied 
not only by his wife but by band-members who have been with him since 
they were all kids growing up on the streets of New Jersey. There are 
some figures who can only be admired if one separates the glorious work 
from the less than glorious individual; Springsteen is an exception.<br>
<br>
It is one of the pleasures and terrors of youth that so much of the 
future is uncertain. Middle age holds other terrors, and other 
pleasures. The pleasures are in the memories of the life one has led; 
the terror is in the thought that the best has already been.<br>
<br>
In youth we latch onto charismatic figures - musical, literary, even 
religious - who can accompany us as we stumble towards maturity. These 
guides are often discarded in adulthood, and rightly so.<br>
<br>
Springsteen, however, remains. In the way he has lived his life, the 
work he has created and the influence his work has had, Springsteen 
remains an inspiration. When he was recently asked what explained his 
relentless productivity, he said, "There is nothing like the light of 
the coming train to focus the mind."<br>
<br>
The train will eventually come for all of us, but Bruce Springsteen 
remains a heroic role model of how to make the most of the time we are 
here. I do not listen to his music today to be reminded of my glory 
days; I listen because his music offers the hope that there are still 
better days ahead.</div>

				<div class="content">FOUR DISCS, 26 YEARS: THE MAKING OF BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN'S ''TRACKS''<br>
Jan 1, 1999 12:00 PM, Dan Daley<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen's impressive career was launched with Greetings From 
Asbury Park in 1973. He was signed based on demos supervised by the 
legendary John Hammond Sr. Two years and two albums later, Born To Run 
made the Freehold, N.J., native a household name, and by 1984, Born in 
the U.S.A. had made him a mega-star. But a dozen or so albums over more 
than 25 years of recording barely scratch the surface of this prolific 
artist's career. When recording studio albums, he would often ignore all
 the songs he'd been working on between records, and he's famous for 
recording more songs than he needed for many of his albums: For example,
 for Born in the U.S.A. about 60 tracks were recorded in total; on Human
 Touch in 1992, around 40 songs went into the can.<br>
<br>
The Springsteen canon is massive, so it's no surprise that the 
retrospective undertaken by Springsteen and his team in early 1998-a 
four-disc collection called Bruce Springsteen: Tracks, released in 
November-was an archival endeavor of Homeric proportions. Tracks offers 
many songs no one but Springsteen and his inner circle have ever heard 
before. Aside from those rarities are treats such as the four-song demo 
that John Hammond produced for Springsteen's Columbia signing and 
several B sides of singles, such as "Pink Cadillac," which was slated to
 appear on Born in the U.S.A. but which wound up being relegated to the 
flip side of the "Dancin' in the Dark" single instead.<br>
<br>
"We knew that this was going to be quite an undertaking," recalls Toby 
Scott, who has worked as an engineer for Springsteen for the past two 
decades. Scott was Chuck Plotkin's engineer at the producer's studio, 
Clover, in Los Angles in 1978 when Plotkin was called in to finish mixes
 for Darkness on the Edge of Town. Over time, Springsteen came to rely 
more and more on Scott, both in the studio and for recording live 
performances, and Scott has handled nearly all of Springsteen's 
recording work since 1980. But one of Scott's greatest contributions is a
 computerized database that he began working on in 1985; Scott created 
it in order to help Springsteen find specific songs in his rapidly 
growing treasury of demos, outtakes and songs that didn't make it onto 
albums, so Springsteen could keep rotating them into his ever-changing 
live sets.<br>
<br>
"In February [1998], Bruce had been recording material for a new album, 
and in the middle of it he just stopped and said, 'Let's do the boxed 
set,'" recalls Scott, who began the project working from his home in 
Whitefish, Montana. "That's what we had always referred to this project 
as. We knew since the 1980s that he would do it at some point." 
Springsteen gave Scott a list of more than a hundred songs, and Scott 
began researching them in the catalog. Most of the material was in 
rough-mix form, and for a time the creative crew of Springsteen, Plotkin
 and manager Jon Landau considered releasing those mixes, even doing a 
tentative initial mastering session to see what they would sound like. 
But a listening session in June among the three produced a 
decision-prompted mainly by Landau-to do remixes from the original 
masters.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Sony Music had been alerted that the project was under way, 
and the record company's corporate machine ground into gear, creating 
its own timetable and setting a September deadline for master 
submission. "We didn't even have a final list of songs for the project 
in June, and here we were facing a three-month deadline in which we were
 going to have to find, remix and master dozens of songs," recalls 
Scott. "It was almost overwhelming."<br>
<br>
Almost. But the database project Scott had started and maintained helped
 enormously in locating the desired multitrack reels. These were sent to
 Springsteen's South Jersey estate, a working farm with several 
additional buildings on the property, one of which-a 185-year-old 
farmhouse-is his personal recording studio (profiled in Mix in June 
'96). Scott had first put Springsteen's home recording setup together 
back in 1982, when the artist was working on Born in the U.S.A. and 
recording new songs to cassette. Springsteen had become enamored of the 
stark tonal quality he could achieve with an acoustic guitar and a 
cassette, and that experience eventually contributed to Nebraska. But as
 Springsteen seemed to increasingly enjoy working outside the 
conventional studio setting, Scott offered to put together a more 
sophisticated recording operation for him. Initially, it was an 8-track 
MCI recorder and a 16-input Trident Trimix console, which would mix down
 to the early digital F-1 format, which essentially was little more than
 a stereo A-D converter and a VHS VCR. "It was awkward, but it was 
digital and 16-bit, either 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz," says Scott. "He did over
 a dozen songs on that format, and two wound up on the boxed set. He 
really needed a home studio back then, if only so we didn't end up 
mastering cassettes for the rest of his career."<br>
<br>
Beginning in late June of last year, Scott organized how to get the 
songs for the boxed set (which had grown to 128 in number) located and 
remixed if necessary in the increasingly short window ahead of them. The
 solution was to turn the farmhouse into a recording complex. By this 
time, the home studio had been considerably updated-after going to 
24-track analog (another MCI machine, an expanded Trident; later a 
62-input Amek Angela and the first of what would be two of the early 
Sony 3324 digital multitracks), it now features a 96-input Euphonix 
CS2000 console and a pair of Sony 3348 digital multitracks, with mixdown
 mainly to DAT. Over the years, as he updated the database of 
recordings, Scott's thoroughness extended to having original masters 
transferred to digital multitrack formats, and this helped considerably 
when the boxed set project began-by then most of the masters were 
already transferred to digital. The Euphonix room was dubbed Studio A. 
Next, it was arranged for Kooster McAllister's Record Plant Remote truck
 to come to the estate, where it would act as Studio B, parked across 
the driveway from the farmhouse. Finally, longtime Springsteen mixer Bob
 Clearmountain came onboard. Because of scheduling conflicts, he worked 
from his SSL-equipped home studio in Los Angeles, and Scott arranged for
 ISDN lines and an EDNet digital conversion system to be linked to the 
New Jersey site. Engineer Ed Thacker was brought in to do mixes on the 
Euphonix, and Thom Panunzio, who was an assistant engineer for 
producer/engineer Jimmy Iovine on Born To Run at the old Record Plant 
Studios in Manhattan, was hired to mix from the Record Plant truck.<br>
<br>
"We realized that there was no way to meet the deadline of September 10 
if we just used one studio to remix all of this," Scott says. "The math 
just didn't work. And there were scheduling issues to deal with when you
 have more than one mixer. Ed was available from July through September;
 Bob was booked almost through August; Thom had time in the end of July 
and all of August. So we had to have multiple studios working and 
multiple mixers mixing at the same time, if necessary."<br>
<br>
Through early August, Scott was coordinating virtually all of this by 
phone, awaiting the birth of his first child in Whitefish. He hired 
engineer Greg Goldman, whom he had worked with before, to act as his 
eyes and ears on the ground in New Jersey. All the mixers shared Yamaha 
NS-10 monitoring in common-Springsteen's own favorite studio 
speaker-coupled with dB Technologies A-D converters (Clearmountain used 
Apogee converters). This gave an element of consistency to the project, 
which would cover 26 years' worth of Springsteen recordings and 
encompass a broad array of recording formats and technology.<br>
<br>
Artistically, Plotkin assigned songs from various eras of Springsteen's 
career among the three engineers chronologically. "The earlier stuff 
went to Thom, because he was actually around for some of it," Scott 
explains. Thacker was also given some of that material, as well as a lot
 of the middle period Springsteen. Clearmountain remixed later pieces, 
from the Human Touch era forward. "As a result, there was enough 
material so that most of the time the mixers weren't crossing over 
between eras," Scott says. "For instance, CD three is all Thacker and CD
 four is all Clearmountain. And the material itself has so much internal
 variation between periods that there really isn't a consistency issue 
in most of it. It stands alone. Besides, we've all heard a few Bruce 
Springsteen mixes before."<br>
<br>
Thacker's connection to Springsteen was peripheral until he was called 
for this project. He had been friends with Plotkin for years and had 
been working in recent years on music projects with E Street Band 
keyboardist Roy Bittan. However, that, combined with a highly evolved 
working knowledge of the Euphonix console, made him a good choice for 
Studio A, says Scott. From Thacker's point of view, the experience was 
much more than simply a gig. "Bruce's records had been a big influence 
on me as an engineer in terms of their power and content," he observes. 
"The interesting thing about them is that they're not as guitar-driven 
as you might remember them. Once I opened up the tapes I realized that 
the guitars are more like the foundation of the rhythm and the keyboards
 have these little interlocking melodies that really give you the hook."
 After mixing 38 of the 66 songs in the boxed set, Thacker found, too, 
that Springsteen had changed his attitude toward reverb. "We all recall 
his vocals as being very big and sitting in the track surrounded by 
reverb," he says. "But in several instances he asked me to make the 
vocals drier than they might have been 20 years ago; make them a little 
more personal. We weren't trying to re-create the past with this 
project; the songs and the music do that themselves."<br>
<br>
A typical day in August, when all three engineers were working 
simultaneously on mixes, was both complex and cacophonous. Panunzio and 
Thacker would generally set up a mix during the evenings, returning the 
next morning to complete it. Springsteen would call in during the 
afternoons and show up between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. to listen to mixes and 
make any suggested changes. Plotkin was also present, adding his input.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Clearmountain was doing the same, but with a three-hour time 
difference, with his mixes being played back in real time over NS-10s in
 the living room at Springsteen's recording compound. By then, Scott's 
wife had delivered and he was back on-site and, along with assistant 
engineer Ross Petersen (who was also assisting Thacker in Studio A), 
using the mornings to handle any maintenance tasks that had cropped up 
overnight. "It got so you could hear music coming from all over the 
place," Scott recalls of those bustling dog days of summer. "It was an 
old building, and you could hear everyone's mixes coming through the 
walls around you." It was a beehive-like production line that was 
creating what would eventually become 66 songs for Tracks in less than 
90 days.<br>
<br>
Thom Panunzio had specified the Record Plant Remote truck, which ran on 
an external generator for the first few weeks until Kooster McAllister 
found a 240-volt source in the greenhouse attached to the farmhouse. But
 inside, it could have been the Record Plant in Manhattan, circa 1975, 
with McAllister's discrete API console and the classic outboard 
complement that included Pultec EQP-1As, Fairchild 670s and LA-2As. 
"Some of this stuff had originally been recorded 20 years ago, and they 
wanted to re-create that effect for this mix," McAllister says. There 
was an occasional overdub, as well. "In a lot of cases, Bruce had 
started a song and then moved on to the next one, so some of them needed
 a guitar part or a tambourine or a harmony," he recalls. "Bruce just 
stood in the back of the truck and did it. Usually in one take."<br>
<br>
For Panunzio, who had assisted engineer/producer Jimmy Iovine on 
Darkness on the Edge of Town at the original Record Plant, it was a time
 trip. "It was a flashback to open up the tapes and hear me and Jimmy 
talking over the talkback. When you think about it, there's no other 
artist who could have had so many great songs not make it onto their 
records in the first place."<br>
<br>
At the same time, Scott had rented (and learned to operate) a Sonic 
Solutions workstation, chosen because it was the same platform that 
mastering engineer Bob Ludwig would use for the finished productions. 
Scott loaded the final remixes into the Sonic's hard drives. He 
assembled them in sequence and according to which disc they would reside
 on for the final boxed set, setting spacings and doing crossfades and 
other editing tasks. "That would make the mastering stage go that much 
faster," he says. "And once we had material to fill one of the CDs, that
 would give us all a chance to reevaluate it artistically in sequence."<br>
<br>
Mastering was completed in a week, from hard drives sent to Gateway 
Mastering in Portland, Maine. Scott, Plotkin and Springsteen capped that
 process off with three days of listening there, making final tweaks to 
the four-disc set before sending it off for replication.On schedule.<br>
<br>
Scott credits everyone who worked on the complex project as contributing
 to its on-time completion, from the technical aspects to the artistic 
wrestling that went into choosing which songs would appear on this 
career-defining showcase. But the project also had one other tangential 
accomplishment that seemed to particularly gratify Scott's orderly 
proclivities: Sony Music has recently created its own archive database, 
and in doing so has made extensive use of Scott's cataloging efforts 
over the last decade. "Now I can just call up Sony and get whatever 
Bruce Springsteen song I need," he says. Which will be very helpful for 
Tracks II, if it ever happens.<br>

<br>
ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE<br>
<br>
JANUARY 2014<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PART 1</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
1- BORN TO RUN - 1975<br>
<br>
When a 24-year-old Bruce Springsteen began writing "Born to Run," he had
 a title, a surf-guitar riff indebted to Duane Eddy's "Because They're 
Young" and the Tornados' "Telstar," and some desperate, extravagant 
hopes. "I had these enormous ambitions for it," said Springsteen, who 
was, at the time, a hitless cult artist in dire danger of losing his 
record deal. "I wanted to make the greatest rock record that I'd ever 
heard. I wanted it to sound enormous, to grab you by your throat and 
insist that you take that ride, insist that you pay attention – not just
 to the music, but to life, to being alive." Springsteen started work on
 the song one day in early 1974, sitting in his bed in a rented cottage a
 couple of blocks from the beach in Long Branch, New Jersey, and the 
record then took shape in a small Hudson Valley studio, via six months 
worth of overdubs, some never used: endless acoustic and electric 
guitars, electric and acoustic piano, organ, glockenspiel, strings, 
violin, synth, engine noises and a choir.<br>
"We went through a lot of different ways of playing it," said former E 
Street Band drummer Ernest "Boom" Carter, who left the band shortly 
after finishing the song. "I became a pretty good dart player, pool 
player, hanging out in that studio." Springsteen hit his target, ending 
up with a brash, careening masterpiece that became his signature anthem.
 At age 64, he's still able to infuse passion and meaning when he plays 
it with the E Street Band under blazing house lights.<br>
"It was a record of enormous longing," he says, "and those emotions and 
desires never leave you. You're dead when that leaves you. The song 
transcends your age and continues to speak to that part of you that is 
both exhilarated and frightened about what tomorrow brings. It will 
always do that – that's how it was built."<br>
<br>
2- BADLANDS -1978<br>
<br>
"I came up with titles, and I went in search of songs that would deserve
 the title," Springsteen said, describing the writing of Darkness. 
"'Badlands' – that's a great title, but it would be easy to blow it! But
 I kept writing, and I kept writing, and I kept writing and writing 
until I had a song that I felt deserved that title." He nicked a riff 
from the Animals' "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" and tapped the 
ferocity of the punk singles he'd been listening to at the time and 
ended up with a song that perfectly fits Pete Townshend's definition of a
 rock anthem: "praying onstage." "I believe in the faith that can save 
me/I believe and I hope and I pray/That someday it will raise me/Above 
these Badlands," Springsteen sings. "That's him singing the high part, 
while his other voice, this full-throated thing, continues below," says 
Jackson Browne. "It's cool and thrilling. There is an economy of 
language that comes in here. He's building a persona, a lexicon of 
references."<br>
<br>
<br>
3- THUNDER ROAD – 1975<br>
<br>
Springsteen was sure that Born to Run would open with its title track – 
until he wrote "Thunder Road." "'Thunder Road' was just so obviously an 
opening, due to its intro," he says. "It just set the scene. There is 
something about the melody of 'Thunder Road' that just suggests a new 
day, it suggests morning, it suggests something opening up." He wrote 
"Thunder Road" on the piano in his living room; later, keyboardist Roy 
Bittan elegantly extrapolated Springsteen's parts. Said Springsteen, 
"Roy's attack and formulations of what I showed him really created a 
very, very unique sound, and, in the end, if people hear that today, 
they go, 'That sounds like the E Street Band.'" Like many of 
Springsteen's early songs, the lyrics hint at a perspective beyond his 
years: "So you're scared and you're thinking maybe we ain't that young 
anymore." "The songs were written immediately after the Vietnam War, and
 you forget­ everybody felt like that then," Springsteen says. "There's 
quite a sense of dread and uncertainty about the future and who you 
were, where you were going, where the whole country was going, so that 
found its way into the record."<br>
<br>
<br>
4- RACING IN THE STREET -1978<br>
<br>
Side one of Darkness on the Edge of Town closes with the most quietly 
devastating song in Springsteen's catalog. Although it was also recorded
 as a fiery full-band rocker, the version on the album is a stripped 
piano ballad, sung from the perspective of a small-town loser with a 
souped-up car and a tired-eyed girl. Introducing the song live in 1978, 
Springsteen said it was inspired by "this little fire road" outside 
Asbury Park. The lyrics riff on Martha and the Vandellas' Motown classic
 "Dancing in the Street" and even recommend engine heads for a '69 
Chevy. But as the song's solemn instrumental coda rolls on, you know 
there's no happy ending on the horizon ("Tonight my baby and me, we're 
gonna ride to the sea/And wash these sins off our hands," Springsteen 
sings). "The meaning is as much in the parts where he doesn't sing as 
where he does," says Tom Morello. "You really feel this endless 
helplessness as they drive on into an uncertain future."<br>
<br>
<br>
5- THE RIVER – 1980<br>
<br>
Many of the tragic characters in Springsteen's songs are fictional. But 
the teenage couple in "The River" were drawn from his own real-life 
experience. Springsteen's sister Ginny became pregnant at age 18 and 
quickly married her child's father, Mickey Shave, who took a 
construction job to support his family. "They had to struggle very hard 
back in the late Seventies, like so many people are doing today," 
Springsteen said when he performed The River live in its entirety in 
2009. He turned their story into his most moving working-class lament, a
 slow, sparse ballad with a mournful harmonica part that starts to sound
 like a funeral dirge as the song ends. Springsteen debuted "The River" 
at the No Nukes concert in September 1979, shortly after recording it 
with the E Street Band at New York's Power Station studio. His sister 
was in the crowd, but she didn't know that Springsteen had written a 
song about her. "Every bit of it was true," Ginny told Springsteen 
biographer Peter Ames Carlin. "And here I am, completely exposed. I 
didn't like it at first – but now it's my favorite song." Today, Ginny 
and Mickey are still happily married.<br>

6- BACKSTREETS – 1975<br>
<br>
In his Rolling Stone review of Born to Run, Greil Marcus said Roy 
Bittan's cascading piano intro to "Backstreets" was so powerful "it 
might be the prelude to a rock &amp; roll version of The Iliad." The 
song has invited many interpretations: It may be about Springsteen's 
early-Seventies ­girlfriend Diane Lozito, or a close male friendship 
that's faded (some hear homoerotic undertones in the song). He contrasts
 tragic images – "Remember all the movies, Terry, we'd go see/Trying to 
learn how to walk like heroes we thought we had to be" – and triumphal 
music that echoes mid-Sixties­ Bob Dylan (especially in its Blonde on 
Blonde-style organ). It's taken on deep personal meaning; he played it 
frequently in 2007, after longtime assistant Terry Magovern died, and it
 opened the first show the E Street Band played after organist Danny 
Federici died in 2008 (poignantly, minus the organ part). "Put on 
'Backstreets' and everyone holds up their whiskey and sings along," says
 Bethany Cosentino of Best Coast. "It really brings people together."<br>
<br>
7-ATLANTIC CITY -1982<br>
<br>
Nebraska was my entry, how I got into Bruce. That was the easiest one to
 spend time with, because it was so bare and so direct. And the 
storytelling is so interesting. The song "Nebraska" – you hear the first
 couple of notes, and you are right in this world.<br>
Our [2004] album, Funeral, was not exactly the record you want to put on
 at any minute of the day. It takes a certain amount of engagement to 
make a connection with it. In a way, it's like Born to Run, which 
demands something of you. Whereas Nebraska – it can be on in the 
background, and it sucks you in. It's not asking for your complete 
attention. There is not this huge band hammering in your face. It can 
sneak up on you.<br>
"Atlantic City" has a hook. The pop aspect to it backs up the 
storytelling. You find yourself humming that song all the time. And that
 is the connection point. And there are these little details in that 
song that you don't hear in a pop song: "Put on your stockings, baby, 
'cause the night is getting cold." But it's got this incredible hook to 
it.<br>
There are certain limitations to rock &amp; roll, the sounds you can 
make. But there are an infinite number of stories. This record is about 
storytelling and using music to heighten the story.<br>

8- DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN - 1978<br>
<br>
If Born to Run was dominated by romantic visions of escape, its 
follow-up was about finding a place to make a stand. The street-racing 
narrator of Darkness on the Edge of Town's album-closing title track has
 lost his wife, his money and his hope for a better life, but he remains
 defiant: "Tonight I'll be on that hill 'cause I can't stop," 
Springsteen snarls over a stately, archetypally E Street arrangement. 
Springsteen described the song's hero as having "reached a point where 
you just have to strip yourself of everything to get yourself together."
 Steve Van Zandt said it highlights the feel of the whole album. "It 
looks heroic, sometimes it feels heroic, but it's actually an obsession,
 a compulsion," he says. "The song just sums up that record very 
accurately, in terms of 'the stories now, we're gonna not necessarily 
have a happy ending.' You still have the cinematic thing going on, but 
it's smaller. The cameras are zooming in. It's more of an independent 
film now."<br>
<br>
<br>
9 –BORN IN THE USA - 1984<br>
<br>
Both "Born in the U.S.A." and its eventual B side, the quieter veteran's
 lament "Shut Out the Light," had its origins in a third, never-finished
 song, "Vietnam." That composition split in two after Springsteen 
grabbed the phrase "Born in the U.S.A." from the title page of a Paul 
Schrader screenplay he'd been sent. Springsteen recorded a solo acoustic
 version of "Born in the U.S.A." in the same cassette-demo sessions that
 produced Nebraska, but the song seemed unspectacular in that format. 
"It was one of the lesser songs on the Nebraska tape," said producer Jon
 Landau. But Springsteen revived the song in E Street Band sessions, 
where it instantly came to spectacular life: "We just kinda did it off 
the cuff," Springsteen said. "I never taught it to the band. I went in 
and said, 'Roy, get this riff.' And he just pulled out that sound, 
played the riff on the synthesizer. We played it two times, and our 
second take is on the rec­ord. That's why the guys are really on the 
edge. . . . To me, [Max Weinberg] was right up there with the best of 
them on that song. There was no arrangement. I said, 'When I stop, keep 
the drums going.' That thing in the end with all the drums, that just 
kinda happened."<br>
<br>
<br>
10 – THE PROMISED LAND – 1978<br>
<br>
The distinctly non-Jersey imagery of this song – tornadoes, a 
"rattlesnake speedway in the Utah desert" – was inspired by a road trip 
Springsteen took as he worked on Darkness on the Edge of Town. The 
simple, straightforward music, meanwhile, is one of the best examples of
 Springsteen stripping down in the aftermath of the wall-of-sound 
grandeur of Born to Run: "I remember him telling me he really wanted to 
downsize the scale, that big sound," producer Jon Landau said years 
later, describing the transition out of the highly orchestrated Born to 
Run. Bittan's spare but expansive piano and Weinberg's driving beat fit 
lyrics that balance images of isolation and frustration with a hunger 
for independence within a larger community. "It really begins our 
folk-based rock," Springsteen said of "The Promised Land." "It goes back
 to blues and folk, and folk structures – I was not trying to be really 
melodic, because that immediately pulls you into the pop world. I was 
trying to create this mixture, this sort of rock-folk music that 
stretches back all the way, in some ways, to Woody Guthrie and country 
music and up through the Animals."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
11 "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)"<br>
1973<br>
<br>
Springsteen wrote his first real anthem for exactly the purpose it ended
 up serving for decades: to blow the roof off concert venues of all 
shapes and sizes. The cadence and melody of the song appeared in a Van 
Morrison-style soul-folk tune called "Henry Boy," which he performed 
solo acoustic in 1972. By the time he recorded "Rosalita" in early 1973,
 it was a surging, exultant, breathless rocker – not to mention, a 
totally true story: "Tell him this is his last chance/To get his 
daughter in a fine romance/Because the record company, Rosie, just gave 
me a big advance." Springsteen later said, "The stuff I write is the 
stuff I live with. . . . They're all true. Even the names – Big Balls 
Billy, Weak-Kneed Willie, all of 'em." (Ex-girlfriend Diane Lozito is 
believed to have inspired the song, but Springsteen has never given any 
indication as to Rosie's true identity.) The song's romantic dilemma – 
Rosie's dad has locked her away – is presented with fierce urgency, 
except for one lyric, which Springsteen later called "one of the most 
useful lines I've ever written": "Someday we'll look back on this and it
 will all seem funny."<br>
<br>
<br>
12 "The Ghost of Tom Joad"<br>
1995<br>
<br>
After three very personal albums in a row – Tunnel of Love, Human Touch 
and Lucky Town – writing "Streets of Philadelphia" helped remind 
Springsteen that some of his best songs reached beyond his own 
experience and, as he put it, "had some sort of social theme." "It was 
about re-finding that place in myself," said Springsteen, who had long 
admired John Ford's film adaptation of The Grapes of Wrath. "That's 
really how the song 'Tom Joad' came about. I was interested in 
reconnecting to those things and reconnecting to the part of myself that
 had written about them." In writing "Joad," he was also thinking about 
the Republicans' assault on the social safety net: He dedicated one live
 version to the "Gingrich mob." He originally intended it as a rock 
song, but released it in a hushed acoustic arrangement. Two years later,
 Rage Against the Machine radically retooled it into an unlikely 
modern-rock hit – and Springsteen would go on to do the definitive live 
version with Rage guitarist Tom Morello.<br>
<br>
13 "Jungleland"<br>
<br>
1975<br>
<br>
Springsteen once described Born to Run's grand finale as a "spiritual 
battleground." He was referring to the song's narrative, but he could 
just as well have been talking about its creation. Recording began in 
mid-1974 alongside "Born to Run," but the sessions hit a wall, prompting
 Springsteen to change studios. A Spanish-­flavored intro was cut, 
numerous takes were made and discarded, and most famously, in a 16-hour 
fit of inspired obsessive-compulsiveness, Springsteen led Clarence 
Clemons through every note of his soaring sax part, over and over, until
 it was perfect. "All we could do was hold on – smoke a lot of pot and 
try to stay calm," said Clemons of the sessions. The result was a 
nine-minute epic, a tale of outlaw love gone wrong, beginning with Suki 
Lahav's searching violin and Roy Bittan's jazzy piano and building into a
 miniature rock opera, peaking with Clemons' magnificent extended solo, 
which was in fact edited together from pieces of takes by Springsteen. 
It was worth the effort, wowing even Clemons, who considered the solo 
collage a pinnacle of his musical partnership with Springsteen. "To me,"
 the sax man said in his memoir, "that solo sounds like love."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
14 "Nebraska"<br>
1982<br>
<br>
"Nebraska was about that American isolation: What happens to people when
 they're alienated from their friends and their community and their 
government and their job," Springsteen said of his stark 1982 acoustic 
album. On its arresting title track, he sings in a flat, almost 
emotionless voice as he steps into the mind of Fifties serial killer 
Charles Starkweather, who with his girlfriend killed 11 people in 
Wyoming and Nebraska. The song was inspired by seeing Terrence Malick's 
film Badlands on TV. Springsteen's bare-bones acoustic-guitar/harmonica 
version fit the vividly descriptive lyrics best. "I was interested in 
writing kind of smaller than I had been," Springsteen said.<br>
<br>
15 "4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)"<br>
<br>
1973<br>
<br>
Carried by the seaside swell of Danny Federici's accordion and 
Springsteen's crystalline lead-guitar intro, this elegiac spiritual 
descendant of the Beach Boys' "Surfer Girl" remains one of his most 
moving songs. Springsteen has called it a "love note and a goodbye song"
 to his musical home of Asbury Park – its imagery of "carnival life on 
the water" is an early display of ample storytelling and scene-setting 
gifts. Its depiction of Seventies Asbury is certainly romanticized: "No 
one would ever go under the boardwalk," said then-E Street drummer Vini 
"Mad Dog" Lopez. "There were rats under the boardwalk!"<br>
<br>
<br>
16 "Prove It All Night"<br>
<br>
1978<br>
<br>
This heroic rocker – a glorious showcase for the E Street Band and the 
first single released from Darkness – went through a series of changes: 
Springsteen's book Songs includes nine pages of handwritten revisions. 
Originally, he said, "Prove It All Night" had "a chorus but few lyrics."
 Explaining one of its possible inspirations, Springsteen credited a 
mythically gritty source: a New York cabbie he'd ridden with. "He was 
just talking about how . . . all your life you gotta prove something to 
somebody," Springsteen told a concert audience in 1978. "He says, 'I 
gotta go home, I gotta prove it to my wife – I come to work, I gotta 
prove it to my boss.'"<br>
<br>
<br>
17 "Incident on 57th Street"<br>
<br>
1973<br>
<br>
"'Incident' featured a theme I'd return to often in the future: the 
search for redemption," Springsteen said. "Over the next 20 years I'd 
work this one like only a good Catholic boy could." This steamy-summer, 
mean-streets ballad (originally titled "Puerto Rican Jane") sets up 
Spanish Johnny with Jane, who "sleeps in sheets damp with sweat" while 
her man slips out to "make a little easy money tonight." It's a sort-of 
test run for the expansive urban storytelling of "Jungleland," and 
Clemons later said that when it was played live, "you can hear the 
opening violin and piano intro that morphed into the opening of 
'Jungleland.'" <br>
<br>
<br>
18 - STATE TROUPER <br>
<br>
1982<br>
<br>
Recorded in just a single take at Springsteen's home studio, the 
extremely low-fi "State Trooper" is a bracing song about a paranoid 
criminal barreling down the New Jersey Turnpike on a rainy night. 
Drawing heavy inspiration from New York synth-punk duo Suicide's 1977 
song "Frankie Teardrop," Springsteen plays the same droning chords on 
the acoustic guitar over and over as his character slowly loses his 
mind, then lets out an unhinged scream as the song fades. "I don't know 
if it's even really a song or not," Springsteen wrote in a note to Jon 
Landau. "It's kinda weird."<br>
<br>
<br>
19 <br>
The Promise, 2010<br>
<br>
Springsteen spent two years writing and recording songs for Darkness on 
the Edge of Town. Many were quickly tossed aside, but he kept returning 
to "The Promise," making slight lyric changes to the tale of two friends
 torn apart by a vague betrayal. Inspired by his lawsuit with former 
manager Mike Appel, it was eventually set aside because it was "too 
self-referential," but the song became a fan favorite when he added it 
to his live set. "There's a lot going on in those lyrics," says Van 
Zandt. "He's leaving it open as to who broke the promise. You have to 
recognize the possibility that one can break [a] promise to one's self, 
and compromise when maybe they shouldn't have."<br>
<br>
20 "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out"<br>
<br>
1975<br>
<br>
Even Springsteen can't explain what a Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out is. "I 
still have no idea," he said with a chuckle in 2005. "But it's 
important." Beyond the title, the song is about the formation of the E 
Street Band. The group had been named for only about a year by this 
point, but Springsteen was already crafting a mythological narrative 
about when "Scooter and the Big Man bust this city in half." The song 
also brought a new member aboard. Longtime friend Van Zandt dropped by 
the studio while the tune was being recorded and helped craft a horn 
arrangement for it. Springsteen liked what he heard, and the E Street 
Band had a new guitarist.<br>
<br>
21 "I'm on Fire"<br>
<br>
1984<br>
<br>
When I first met Bruce, his first album wasn't out yet. I had just 
released my first album. The way I'd hear about his early records – it 
wasn't on the radio. It was my wife: "You gotta hear this guy." I think 
it was "Incident on 57th Street." He made those first two albums before 
he really blew up and everybody knew him. He's an artist that has had 
many major turns and awakenings. A lot of surprising stuff has happened 
along the way.<br>
"I'm on Fire" is one of his most intimate songs. And it's not claiming 
any high ground. It's about fundamental deep-seated desire. The drums 
are played with a cross stick [on the snare]. He says, "I'm on fire," 
but he lets all this muscular playing fall away. The performance has its
 own power. It's something that exists in him. It's just there. And it's
 astonishing to see somebody who relied that much on physical power to 
let the music and his voice be understated like this. It's a great 
moment.<br>
"My Hometown" [on this album] is the same thing. It's the same thing 
that had begun to happen in "Atlantic City" – beginning to recognize 
that you're in this place with all of these other people, that where 
you're from will always be with you.<br>
It's the reverse of "Thunder Road" and "Born to Run." It's growing up. 
That had to happen. You couldn't go on being the outsider, rejecting 
everybody, believing that redemption only existed under the hood of his 
car. And at this point, his descriptive prowess is in full force. "I'm 
on Fire" is a beautifully, economically drawn picture. He has this 
ability to say so much in very few words.<br>
It's interesting that Bruce never wanted to act. But what he's doing is 
above that. There is acting taking place – a willingness to portray. 
He's created a body of work that is possible to perform and act out.<br>

<br>
22 "Dancing in the Dark"<br>
1984<br>
<br>
When Jon Landau heard Born in the U.S.A., he felt something was missing.
 "He suggested we didn't have a single," said Springsteen. "[So] I wrote
 'Dancing in the Dark.' It went as far in the direction of pop music as I
 wanted to go – and probably a little farther." The glossy, synth-driven
 song masks a story of outright desperation, but it helped reach a whole
 new audience (especially after Springsteen filmed a video where he 
dances with 20-year-old Courteney Cox), and it remains his most 
successful single. "It was much, much, much more produced," says Van 
Zandt. "I didn't like that song when I first heard it. Much later I 
learned to like it."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
23 "Land of Hope and Dreams"<br>
<br>
2012<br>
<br>
When Springsteen reunited with the E Street Band in 1999, he was 
determined to make the shows something more than exercises in nostalgia.
 The first public concert wrapped with this new song, a gospel-tinged 
number about a train that carries saints, sinners, whores and gamblers. 
After being an essential highlight of almost every Springsteen show over
 the previous 14 years, it finally saw an official release on 2012's 
Wrecking Ball. "That song was a wonderful reintroduction of what has 
become a very different E Street Band," says Van Zandt. "We just opened 
with it the other night, and the whole fucking stadium took off."<br>
<br>
24 "Streets of Philadelphia"<br>
<br>
1993<br>
<br>
In 1993, Jonathan Demme asked Springsteen to write a song for his new 
movie about the AIDS crisis. Transposing the intimate feel of recent 
albums into a sonic context, he went to his home studio with a drum 
machine and no musicians. What emerged was a sparse, haunting ballad 
that flew up the charts all over the world, genuinely challenged his 
audience and earned him a Grammy, a Golden Globe and even an Academy 
Award. "To write from the perspective of someone who is emaciated, with 
AIDS, is to forsake all of the strength Springsteen had staked his 
career on," says Jackson Browne. "It is quite a feat."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
25 "Stolen Car"<br>
<br>
1980<br>
<br>
This dark, piano-driven track was retooled several times during the 
River sessions; an early rendition featured the phrase "hungry heart" 
that Springsteen used in the song of that name. In the final version, 
the narrator, coping with the end of a marriage, drives off into the 
night. (One alternative take, included on Tracks, hints at a positive 
resolution.) The song, Springsteen later said, was "concerned with those
 [relationship] ideas: that if you don't connect yourself with your 
family and to the world, you feel like you're disappearing, fading away.
 I felt like that for a very, very long time. Growing up, I felt 
invisible."<br>
<br>
26 "Tunnel of Love"<br>
<br>
1987<br>
<br>
"There's a world of love there, and there's a world of fear, 
too. . . . Very often that fear feels a lot realer and certainly more 
urgent than the feeling of love," Springsteen said in recalling the 
inspiration for Tunnel of Love. Recorded with a stripped-down version of
 the E Street Band at his home studio in Rumson, New Jersey, the somber 
title track looks boldly into that romantic anxiety (Springsteen's 
marriage to model-actress Julianne Phillips ended in 1988). In keeping 
with the song's intimate tone, the amusement-park sounds at the song's 
end sampled a real family (the Schiffers) riding a roller coaster in 
Point Pleasant, New Jersey.<br>
<br>
27 "Highway Patrolman"<br>
<br>
1982<br>
<br>
"It's the thin line between stability and that moment when time stops 
and everything goes to black," Springsteen said of the darkest moments 
on Nebraska. "Highway Patrolman" shows how rich that harsh palette can 
be. "My name is Joe Roberts, I work for the state," he sings, opening 
the story of a cop chasing his criminal brother to the Canadian border, 
only to let him escape. The song is an Oscar-worthy drama compressed 
into a few hushed acoustic verses, with allusions to Vietnam and rural 
hardship weaved into its sibling narrative. "There are these interesting
 family dynamics," says Arcade Fire's Win Butler. "It's like looking 
through someone's old wedding photos."<br>
<br>
<br>
28 "The Rising"<br>
2002<br>
<br>
Of all the haunting images to emerge from 9/11, the one that struck 
Springsteen the most was the one of firemen going up the stairways of 
the buildings. "You could be ascending a smoky staircase," Springsteen 
said in 2002. "You could be in the afterlife, moving – moving on." This 
anthemic song – told from the perspective of a rescue worker and 
recorded in producer Brendan O'Brien's Atlanta studio – was the first 
single from the first album he recorded with the E Street Band in 18 
years. "You are able to project your own images onto it," says Melissa 
Etheridge. "I think 'The Rising' is a man coming face to face with his 
spirituality."<br>
<br>
<br>
29 "Brilliant Disguise"<br>
<br>
1987<br>
<br>
I purchased Tunnel of Love when I was 16. I know that for most people, 
especially bandwagon critics, that album might have been seen as a 
letdown, because it had to follow the massive eclipse of Born in the 
U.S.A. But I've always felt it got shafted. It's his divorce album, and I
 love breakup records – like Marvin Gaye's Here, My Dear, or Bill 
Withers' +Justments, or even Richard and Linda Thompson's Shoot Out the 
Lights. On "Brilliant Disguise," Bruce is so open about saying it's 
over. Most people in the public eye go to great lengths to be private, 
even in the celebrity-obsessed society we live in. But he's just like, 
"We gave it our best shot, and it didn't work." It's unresolved. You 
don't get that type of honesty and vulnerability from music very often.<br>
Last year, I spent two weeks going to Springsteen shows. I went to, 
like, four of them – night after night, at the Apollo, at the Garden, in
 Philly and in Jersey. I watched him literally climbing the walls of the
 Apollo. He's in his sixties! I couldn't do that, and I'm way younger 
than him. I started studying his catalog even more after that.<br>
When Bruce came on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, that was one of the 
most magical moments ever in the show. He's so all-inclusive, and so not
 full of ego. I mean, I've seen acts walk through here with, like, 12 
bodyguards just to go to the bathroom. Meanwhile, Springsteen walks in 
our dressing room without knocking, takes a guitar and starts telling us
 about Nebraska. That's just him. When we performed "E Street Shuffle," 
he just said, "Follow my lead," and brought the audience up to dance 
with us. We were all out on the floor, including the entire staff – 
wardrobe, makeup, producers, everything. He just has this 
circus-ringleader quality about him. It's awesome.<br>
<br>
By Questlove<br>
<br>
30 "Wreck on the Highway"<br>
1980<br>
<br>
This song takes its title and some of its lyric inspiration from country
 singer Roy Acuff's 1940s car-crash parable. It portrays the aftermath 
of an accident from the point of view of a witness who ponders the loss 
experienced by "a girlfriend or a young wife" as he sees the victim and 
is haunted by the wreck. After trying it in rehearsal in a country-style
 arrangement, Springsteen settled on a slower, brooding version 
highlighting Danny Federici's meditative organ. "The highway's closed at
 a certain point," Springsteen says of the death-obsessed song. "You 
have a certain amount of miles that you can make. It's a recognition of 
mortality."<br>
<br>
31 "New York City Serenade"<br>
1973<br>
<br>
"My romantic ideas and fantasies of New York City," was how Springsteen 
described this song and "Incident on 57th Street." The 10-minute epic – 
the longest track on any Springsteen studio album – combined fragments 
of two earlier songs, "New York City Song" and "Vibes Man" (the latter 
of which contained images of domestic violence that Springsteen edited 
out). Arranged by David Sancious, who played its sweeping, jazzy piano 
lead, it's full of Mean Streets imagery, spooled out over a song that 
bridges Dylanesque storytelling, doo-wop and Latin jazz via Richard 
Blackwell's subtle conga playing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
32 "Because the Night"<br>
2010<br>
<br>
In 1977, Springsteen was working on an early version of this 
cathedral-size passion play when Patti Smith, recording in the same 
studio, heard about it from producer Jimmy Iovine. Iovine, who was 
working with both musicians, brought Smith a demo of the song, and Smith
 added her own lyrics, recording it for her album Easter, and scoring 
her first and biggest hit single. "Bruce did the hook, Patti the words 
and we [the Smith band] gave it the cannon-blast beat," said Smith's 
guitarist Lenny Kaye. Springsteen's excellent studio version wasn't 
officially released until The Promise, more than 30 years later.<br>
<br>
<br>
33 "Spirit in the Night"<br>
1973<br>
<br>
When Columbia Records president Clive Davis asked Springsteen to write 
more radio-friendly tunes for his debut, he quickly came back with two 
songs: "Blinded by the Light" and this teenage fairy tale about kids 
escaping out to Greasy Lake. Of all the tracks on Greetings From Asbury 
Park, "Spirit" hints most closely at the (still-unnamed) E Street Band's
 future direction, thanks to the nearly nonstop use of Clemons' 
saxophone – until these final sessions for the album, Springsteen hadn't
 even been able to locate Clemons to get him into the studio. The song's
 swaying bass line was played by Bruce himself.<br>
<br>
34 "Adam Raised a Cain"<br>
1978<br>
<br>
"I don't make 'em up," Springsteen said in reference to the songs he's 
written about conflicts with his father, Douglas – a withdrawn 
working-class guy who shared Bruce's struggles with depression. "Adam 
Raised a Cain" is a pile driver, featuring a remarkably heavy groove and
 some of Springsteen's most searing guitar work. The bitter lyrics 
(partially inspired by Elia Kazan's 1955 film East of Eden) give 
father-son tension an almost biblical depth: "You're born into this life
 paying for the sins of somebody else's past," he sings. Before his 
death in 1998, the elder Springsteen was asked which of his son's songs 
he liked best. "The ones about me," he answered.<br>
<br>
35 "Tougher Than the Rest"<br>
<br>
1987<br>
<br>
Night after night, on the Tunnel of Love tour, this subtle ballad made 
for a singularly intimate duet between Springsteen and his future wife, 
Patti Scialfa. "I couldn't have written any of those songs at any other 
point in my career," Springsteen said at the time. "I wouldn't have had 
the knowledge or the insight or the experience to do it." Spare and 
tense, "Tougher Than the Rest" is about an emotionally bruised couple 
meeting at a bar, each hoping this time will be different. "This song is
 unusual in that it applies this macho way of talking to something 
sensitive," says Win Butler of Arcade Fire. "But it's even better 
hearing Patti sing it live with Bruce."<br>
<br>
36 "Shut Out the Light"<br>
<br>
1984<br>
<br>
For anyone wondering if "Born in the U.S.A." was an endorsement or a 
condemnation of the American dream, all they had to do was flip the 
single over and play its gripping B side. "Shut Out the Light" took 
inspiration from the book Born on the Fourth of July, by Vietnam veteran
 Ron Kovic. Over a supple acoustic backdrop and Soozie Tyrell's violin, 
Springsteen sings about Vietnam's hellish psychological aftermath. (He 
removed two verses, one of which alluded to the protagonist's drug 
problem.) Performing the song in stadiums during the Born in the U.S.A. 
tour, he said, "This song is about leaving home and not being able to 
find your way back."<br>
<br>
<br>
37 "No Surrender"<br>
1984<br>
<br>
Springsteen recorded this defiant anthem at the very end of the Born in 
the U.S.A. sessions, but he was hesitant to include it on the album, 
feeling its lyrics were misleadingly romantic. "You don't hold out and 
triumph all the time in life," he said. "You compromise, you suffer 
defeat." But Van Zandt convinced him otherwise. "It had a little bit of 
the 'Born to Run' swagger, if you will, and he was concerned he was 
being a little bit redundant with it," he said. "I just said, 'Look, 
there are certain things, certain themes, certain emotions that it's OK 
to be redundant with. . . . Rock &amp; roll is redundant by definition, 
to be honest.'"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
38 "For You"<br>
1973<br>
<br>
An early example of Springsteen's gift for character-driven story-songs:
 In the back of an ambulance, the narrator talks with his girlfriend, 
who may have attempted suicide. Some believe it's based on his ex Diane 
Lozito; Springsteen – who calls the song one of his "twisted 
autobiographies" – says he "changed names to protect the guilty." 
Onstage, he introduced it by saying, "Back in 1971 . . . I was breaking 
up with this girlfriend of mine, and when I was away one weekend, she 
came and painted all the walls of my room black. . . . That's not 
true . . . she painted 'em all blue."<br>
<br>
<br>
39 "My City of Ruins"<br>
<br>
2002<br>
<br>
Springsteen debuted "My City of Ruins" in December 2000 at a pair of 
Christmas shows in his adopted hometown of Asbury Park, which had fallen
 on hard times since its heyday as a picturesque beach town. But the 
song took on a new meaning when he performed a gospel-tinged rendition 
(with just a few lyric tweaks) at a TV telethon for the victims of 9/11,
 and it served as a devastating closing track to The Rising, recalling 
the Band's "The Weight." In 2012, the song took on yet another meaning 
when it became a nightly tribute to Clemons on the Wrecking Ball tour. 
The "City of Ruins" was now the E Street Band itself.<br>
<br>
40 - YOUNGSTOWN<br>
1995<br>
<br>
Springsteen's response to the economic devastation of the Reagan years 
came in the form of this tense portrait of an unemployed steelworker who
 sees the opportunities of his father dying away. The lyrics were 
inspired by the book Journey to Nowhere: The Saga of the New Underclass:
 "I put it down and I laid awake and I thought, 'What if somebody came 
and told me that the one thing I could do, well, that wasn't necessary 
anymore and how would I come home at night and face my family?'" The 
arrangement, featuring pedal steel guitarist Marty Rifkin and Soozie 
Tyrell's haunting violin, is as intensely brooding as Springsteen's 
lyrics.<br>
<br>
<br>
41 "If I Should Fall Behind"<br>
<br>
1992<br>
<br>
As hushed and solemn as a hymn, Springsteen's ballad from Lucky Town was
 a tender letter of devotion to wife Scialfa, as they navigated a new 
life (the couple had their first child in 1990 and were married in 
1991). "You and I know what this world can do/So let's make our steps 
clear that the other may see," he sang. As Springsteen told a 1992 crowd
 in California, "This is my best song about making even small 
connections." To achieve that intimate feel, Springsteen played every 
instrument himself on the track save for the drums, which fell to 
ex-Steve Miller Band member Gary Mallaber.<br>
<br>
42 "Meeting Across the River"<br>
<br>
1975<br>
<br>
Springsteen dashed off "Meeting Across the River" in "about an hour." 
But he wasn't that fond of it. His then-manager Mike Appel claims he had
 to lobby to get the song on Born to Run. "That's a great song," he told
 Springsteen. "Reminds me of Naked City." Roy Bittan's somber late-night
 piano figure and Randy Brecker's noir trumpet back a short, open-ended 
tale about small-time hoods going across the Hudson to do a deal. "That 
two grand's practically sitting here in my pocket," Springsteen sings, 
though you get the sense that's not how the night will end. The 
suggestive track even birthed a 2005 short-story collection in which 
various authors took inspiration from Springsteen's shadowy tale.<br>
<br>
43 "Wrecking Ball"<br>
<br>
2012<br>
<br>
Bruce wrote this song for our final shows at Giants Stadium in 2009 
before they tore it down. It's one of those road songs written for the 
band. They tend to take on a very comfortable arrangement because 
they're being written for the live band and with the live band. It's not
 like he's going home in between and writing it and demo'ing it and 
showing it to the band later. He's playing us the song backstage on his 
acoustic guitar, just like the old days. Songs like that take on a 
different sort of immediacy because they're literally being worked up at
 soundcheck.<br>
But it's become a bigger song than merely about a physical wrecking 
ball. We had a long conversation about whether it should be the title of
 our last album. I thought once it's elevated to the title of the album 
it actually will take on an additional metaphorical significance that 
can turn around the defensive negative implications of a wrecking ball 
smashing a structure or metaphorically smashing one's past or history or
 dreams. There's some of that in there. The song begins to say, "We are 
now the wrecking ball. We're out here wrecking your passivity. We're 
wrecking your acceptance of mediocrity. We're out here living it with 
you in the pouring rain, we're not afraid of anything. Bring on the 
wrecking ball." In order to be reborn, one must die. That's what it 
became.<br>
I think it's a great example of how good craft becomes art. I really 
believe that is how most of it happens. It's rare that someone sets out 
to do something that is great art and actually succeeds at it. Most of 
the time that's not the thought. Bruce certainly does that more than 
most.<br>
<br>
By Steven Van Zandt<br>
<br>
<br>
44 "Downbound Train"<br>
<br>
1984<br>
<br>
Like "Born in the U.S.A.," "Downbound Train" was a song from the 
Nebraska demo. Yet despite a slow, hard-bitten feel that's keeping with 
the mood of Nebraska, it was actually first written as a jumpy 
rockabilly tune, over which Springsteen dubbed an echoing moan. The 
slowed-down version he eventually went with brings out the desolation in
 lyrics about a guy bouncing from job to job as he ­watches his life 
fall apart. The song was recorded at New York's Power Station studio 
during one of the early Born in the U.S.A. sessions, with the demo's 
moan mirrored in Roy Bittan's brooding synth. "It has a kind of 
plainspoken poetry that ties it to great country music," says <br>
<br>
Melissa Etheridge.<br>
<br>
<br>
45 "Candy's Room"<br>
<br>
1978<br>
<br>
Darkness on the Edge of Town is full of morose and lost characters, but 
Candy may be the saddest. In interviews, Springsteen refuses to admit 
that she's a prostitute, but it's pretty clear why she has "fancy 
clothes and diamond rings" and "men who give her anything she wants." 
(In "Candy's Boy," a tortured ballad Springsteen demo'ed during the 
Darkness sessions, he sings from the perspective of Candy's jilted 
boyfriend.) "Candy's Room" has torrid guitars and a tightly coiled beat 
that brings out its dark urgency. "There's something really romantic 
about that one," says Craig Finn of the Hold Steady. "It's like a rocket
 ship that blasts out of somewhere private into the world."<br>
<br>
46 "This Hard Land"<br>
<br>
1995<br>
<br>
"We recorded about 80 songs for Born in the U.S.A. Some of them are 
great," said Max Weinberg. "'This Hard Land,' which didn't make it on 
the record, is just fantastic. That's probably my favorite song we've 
done." The song's mix of stark Dust Bowl folk and swirling Jersey Shore 
barroom rock is a perfect split between that LP's rave-up Americana and 
the dark acoustic demos of Nebraska. It didn't appear on either album. 
But it became a concert staple and was rerecorded in 1995 for Greatest 
Hits; the folk-rockier, superior original surfaced later on Tracks. "I 
don't understand how I could let it be unreleased for so long," 
Springsteen said in 1998.<br>
<br>
<br>
47 "Lost in the Flood"<br>
<br>
1973<br>
<br>
With its images of returning veterans, Chevy races and post-Vietnam 
America beginning to erode, this grand, apocalyptic parable foreshadows 
themes Springsteen would explore throughout his career. It was, he says,
 about "trying to get a feeling for . . . the forces that affected my 
parents' lives . . . the whole thing of the wasted life." (Tellingly, he
 performed it during the Vote for Change concert in 2004.) The recording
 also marks Van Zandt's first appearance on a Springsteen album: 
Although he didn't play guitar, Van Zandt supplied the sound-effects 
blast that opens the song.<br>
<br>
48 "Growin' Up"<br>
<br>
1973<br>
<br>
Few songs in rock capture coming-of-age swagger and wonderment like this
 ode to Springsteen's adolescence – that period when he was, as the song
 goes, "the cosmic kid in full costume dress." And the music, pushed 
along by David Sancious' elegant piano and Vini "Mad Dog" Lopez's drums,
 is a heady rush. This was one of the handful of tunes Springsteen 
played for Columbia Records honchos during his 1972 audition for the 
label, and he would often preface it in concert with a wry take on that 
meeting: "There was Clive Davis, the head of the company, dressed in a 
white robe and a wreath on his head. I fell to my knees and played the 
guitar."<br>
<br>
<br>
49 "Johnny 99"<br>
<br>
1982<br>
<br>
In September 1984, after Ronald Reagan misappropriated "Born in the 
U.S.A." for his re-election campaign, Springsteen took his revenge 
onstage. "The president was mentioning my name the other day, and I 
kinda got to wondering what his favorite album musta been," he said in 
Pittsburgh one night. "I don't think it was the Nebraska album." Then he
 ripped into "Johnny 99" – the pitch-dark tale of a laid-off autoworker 
who kills a man in a moment of drunken despair, then begs a judge for 
understanding. "Johnny 99" is supposed to inspire empathy, not horror: 
"You kinda just gotta know what that feels like, somewhere," Springsteen
 said of the song.<br>
<br>
50 "Death to My Hometown"<br>
<br>
2012<br>
<br>
"It sounds like an Irish rebel song, but it's all about what happened 
four years ago," Springsteen said to Jon Stewart in 2012 about the fiery
 third single from Wrecking Ball, a devastating indictment of a society 
that no longer cares about the working class. Springsteen sings some of 
his angriest lyrics ever over a Celtic-rock stomp, indicting "the greedy
 thieves who came around/And ate the flesh of everything they found." 
The musical adventurousness fit a theme he wanted to run through 
Wrecking Ball. "I used a lot of music from the 1800s and the 1930s to 
show these things are cyclical," Spring­steen explained at the time. 
"The album is resonant with history."<br>
<br>
51 "One Step Up"<br>
<br>
1987<br>
<br>
The dissolution of Springsteen's first marriage, to Julianne Phillips, 
which echoed through the pensive Tunnel of Love, is particularly present
 in this downcast ballad: "Another fight and I slam the door on/Another 
battle in our dirty little war," he sings. Adding to the mood of 
isolation, Springsteen played all the instruments himself on this track 
(which was recorded in Los Angeles in the summer of 1987), with only 
future wife Scialfa joining in to sing a lovely harmony. Of the songs he
 was writing at the time, Springsteen said, "I thought, 'OK, we're 
growing up together, me and my audience,' and I took that idea 
seriously."<br>
<br>
<br>
52 "I'm Goin' Down"<br>
<br>
1984<br>
<br>
This fun, straightforward rocker almost didn't make it onto Born in the 
U.S.A. – "It was either this or 'Pink Cadillac,'" Springsteen said years
 later when introducing it live. The song ended up being the sixth Top 
10 single from the album (even though some heard it as an allusion to 
oral sex). Despite it being one of his catchiest songs, Springsteen has 
always seemed somewhat ambivalent about its relatively simple depiction 
of romantic distress. Since the Born in the U.S.A. tour, the E Street 
Band has rarely played it live. At one of its rare concert appearances, 
he jokingly called it "one of my more insightful songs about men and 
women."<br>
<br>
<br>
53 "Hungry Heart"<br>
<br>
1980<br>
<br>
Springsteen's first top 10 hit was almost the one that got away: He 
initially planned to give the song to the Ramones (after seeing them at a
 club in Asbury Park), until Jon Landau successfully argued that he'd be
 crazy not to keep it for himself. Landau was right, of course. The 
lyrics, about a guy who walks out on his wife and kids, are actually 
pretty dark, but you'd never know it from the sunny Beach Boys melody 
and arrangement; co-producer Chuck Plotkin sped up the tape on the track
 so Springsteen's voice would sound higher. "It just had this groove," 
Van Zandt said. "So I said, 'Let's get some extra-high harmony on it.'"<br>
<br>
<br>
54 "Streets of Fire"<br>
<br>
1978<br>
<br>
Though the Darkness sessions were driven by Springsteen's huge backlog 
of material post-Born to Run, "Streets of Fire" was actually written in 
the studio. It's one of his bluesiest, most desolate tracks. Producers 
of a noirish 1984 rock movie titled Streets of Fire wanted to use a 
version of the song by the New Wave band Face to Face, but Springsteen 
turned them down – and wisely so, since the film tanked.<br>
<br>
<br>
55 "Independence Day"<br>
<br>
1980<br>
<br>
This pensive ballad was one of several from this period that detailed 
Springsteen's famously fraught relationship with his father. "He was 
always just sitting at the kitchen table at night, drinking too much, or
 off at work," Springsteen told an audience in 1981 when introducing the
 song. "It took us 30 years to be able to tell each other that we loved 
each other." Clemons' brief solo adds a powerful blast of emotional 
catharsis.<br>
<br>
<br>
56 "Lucky Town"<br>
<br>
1992<br>
<br>
"I wrote and recorded that whole record in three weeks in my house," 
Springsteen said of Lucky Town. The understated title track was a moving
 celebration of hard-won romantic salvation, with Springsteen playing 
every instrument except drums, handled by sturdy session man Gary 
Mallaber. The calmly rocking tone of "Lucky Town" fit Springsteen's 
mood. "These are the stories I have to tell," he said. "This is what's 
important in my life right now."<br>
<br>
<br>
57 "Girls in Their Summer Clothes"<br>
<br>
2007<br>
<br>
This lovely song has what Jon Landau called "a Pet Sounds feeling mixed 
with the E Street Band." Springsteen undercuts a radiant melody and 
producer Brendan O'Brien's lush orchestration with melancholic lyrics 
about aging amid youthful beauty – "girls on the Jersey Shore with their
 little short-shorts and bleach-blond hair," says Best Coast's Bethany 
Cosentino.<br>
<br>
<br>
58 "Loose Ends"<br>
<br>
1998<br>
<br>
"Loose Ends" was going to be the final song on The Ties That Bind, the 
album-in-progress that Springsteen decided to scrap in 1979 because it 
"seem[ed] inadequate." Van Zandt reportedly argued for it to be included
 on The River, to no avail. The harrowing rocker about a fading 
relationship didn't get an official release until the Tracks box, two 
decades after it was recorded.<br>
<br>
59 - REASON TO BELIEVE- <br>
<br>
1982<br>
<br>
The closing song on Nebraska is a thin ray of hope, a driving, soulful 
song in which Springsteen expresses amazement that people can keep their
 faith despite the harsh reality of everyday life. "Sometimes people 
need something to believe in so bad that they'll believe in anything 
that comes along – just so that they got some reason to believe," 
Springsteen said while introducing the song live.<br>
<br>
<br>
60-You’re Missing<br>
<br>
2002<br>
<br>
Cut in 1994, this tense track was shelved and then revived and rewritten
 after 9/11, when its title phrase became even more evocative of those 
who died that day. Along with "Into the Fire," "You're Missing" sparked 
ideas for other songs: "I'd come up with one, and that would lead to 
another and lead to another and lead to another," said Springsteen. 
"Then you start to tell a story. . . . You're soul-mining."<br>
<br>
<br>
61 - Point Blank <br>
1980<br>
<br>
Talking about the ways in which rock &amp; roll can capture joy as well 
as bleakness, Springsteen once said, "How could a happy song like 
'Sherry Darling' coexist with 'Point Blank' . . . ?" Swept along by Roy 
Bittan's dramatic piano, this grand passion-play ballad was indeed one 
of Springsteen's gloomiest relationship songs. Although he's never 
discussed who inspired it, it's long assumed the woman in the song is an
 ex who dealt with drug problems.<br>
<br>
62- Radio Nowhere<br>
2007<br>
<br>
"It's a little more sonically guitar-driven than any past Bruce album," 
Jon Landau said of Magic. The album's opening track set the tone: "Radio
 Nowhere" rides waves of guitar noise in a place of isolation and 
hunger. Its desperate energy locked into feelings of Bush-era 
helplessness and rage. "I have something to say not just to your dad or 
your older brother," Springsteen said. "I have something to say to you, 
if you're 15 or 16 years old, about right now."<br>
<br>
63- She's The One<br>
1975<br>
<br>
A pounding, fifties-influenced song about a coldhearted woman, "She's 
the One" rides a Bo Diddley beat ("the beat of the universe," as 
Springsteen called it introducing the song live) and really takes off 
during Clemons' towering sax solo; Springsteen later said that he wrote 
the song so he could hear the solo he heard in his head. It's also the 
song Roy Bittan played along to when he auditioned for the E Street 
Band.<br>
<br>
64- American Skin <br>
2001<br>
<br>
This song was bizarrely thought to be controversial in the wake of the 
police murder of Amadou Diallo in 1999. Bruce played it once in a show 
in Atlanta, and then it got this huge reaction in the New York press. 
One of the themes in the song was, sometimes when you're black in the 
United States, you get shot by police officers. As if that's a 
controversial thing to report in a song. Bruce is able to distill 
universal themes into these small narratives, and "American Skin" is 
certainly a case. It's a song that, I think, transcends the crime. I 
went to the last Madison Square Garden show of that reunion tour, and 
there was some controversy with the local law enforcement, a scenario 
that I was very familiar with at the time. Backstage, I told Bruce, 
"Welcome on board!" I was impressed by his courage. He played that song 
every night of the homestand and did it so fearlessly.<br>
<br>
By Tom Morello<br>
<br>
<br>
65- Walk Like A Man<br>
1987<br>
<br>
This might be the most tender song Springsteen has written about his 
father – "All I can think of is being five years old following behind 
you at the beach/Tracing your footprints in the sand/Trying to walk like
 a man," he sings, then reflects on his shaky emotions as his dad 
watched him get married. Springsteen said the song was about "struggling
 toward some tenuous commitment, knowing that when you make that stand, 
the clock starts."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
66- Glory Days<br>
1984<br>
<br>
Originally, "Glory Days" had a downcast verse about Springsteen's dad, 
who "ain't never had glory days" – but Bruce removed it, preserving the 
song's light tone of wry nostalgia. "Occasionally, you need some comic 
relief," said Van Zandt, who improvised the climactic mandolin solo into
 his vocal mic. "I wanted to get a merry-go-round organ sound, like a 
roller rink," Springsteen said. "That's a happy sound."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
67-Seeds <br>
1986<br>
<br>
Initially known as "Gone Gone Gone," this Born in the U.S.A. outtake 
became a political centerpiece of the subsequent tour, as can be heard 
on Live/1975-85, where it gets packaged alongside Edwin Starr's "War," 
"The River" and "Born in the U.S.A.," drawing a grim American picture. 
"These four songs together were telling different things," Jon Landau 
said of the live set piece. "Things never heard before on any of our 
albums."<br>
<br>
<br>
68- You're Own Worst Enemy<br>
2007<br>
<br>
As with "Girls in Their Summer Clothes," Springsteen and Brendan O'Brien
 created a "big pop production" – with lyrics that implicitly tap the 
mood of a nation that has lost its moral compass post-Iraq War. "It's 
all about self-subversion," Springsteen said. "You can take it 
personally or politically. That's what gives the record its tension, 
those two things – the perfect pop universe and then what's at its 
center."<br>
<br>
<br>
69- Cadillac Ranch<br>
1980<br>
<br>
After an initial stab at cutting The River, Springsteen took a break – 
and, after resuming work, out came this party-ready rocker. It's a 
pivotal song – combining a rousing arrangement with darker lyrics that 
use the real-life Cadillac Ranch (a Texas art project where 10 Caddys 
are half-buried) as a metaphor for death. Before that, he said, "I 
hadn't figured out a way to synthesize it into one song."<br>
<br>
<br>
70- Lucky Town<br>
1992<br>
<br>
One of the few Springsteen songs to feature an American Idol judge – 
that's Randy Jackson on bass – this Lucky Town rocker is Springsteen's 
roaring anthem about the satisfaction he'd found with Scialfa in the 
early Nineties. Featuring one of his most strenuous vocals, it also sees
 him poke deprecating fun at his own myth: "And it's a sad, funny ending
 to find yourself pretending/A rich man in a poor man's shirt."<br>
<br>
<br>
71- Jack of All Trades<br>
2012<br>
<br>
Like most of the songs on Wrecking Ball, "Jack of All Trades" is about 
the Great Recession's disproportionate impact on the working class. "The
 banker man grows fat," he sings. "Working man grows thin. It's all 
happened before and it'll happen again." The brokenhearted song picks up
 at the end with a searing guitar solo by Tom Morello. "You cannot have a
 social contract with the enormous income disparity," Springsteen told 
Jon Stewart in 2012.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
72- Gypsy Biker<br>
2007<br>
<br>
Although it doesn't get into specifics, this jittery, high-voltage song 
has often been interpreted as the emotional funeral of a soldier 
returning from Afghanistan or Iraq. "We kind of live in Orwellian times 
where what's true can be made to seem a lie, and what's a lie can be 
made to seem true," he said, introducing the song in New Jersey in 2007 –
 right in the midst of those two wars.<br>
<br>
<br>
73- Rocky Ground<br>
2012<br>
<br>
The righteously angry Wrecking Ball takes a turn toward redemption on 
this groove-driven song. It’s fueled by decades of African-American 
music – from a sample of a Forties gospel choir to Nineties-flavored 
hip-hop loops and, in a first for Springsteen, an actual rap verse, 
written by him and delivered by duet partner Michelle Moore. Fittingly, 
the song had its live debut at New York’s Apollo Theater.<br>
<br>
<br>
74- Johnny Bye Bye<br>
1985<br>
<br>
The title is a homage to Chuck Berry's "Bye Bye Johnny," but this 
stripped-down Born in the U.S.A. outtake (later issued as a B side to 
"I'm on Fire") is about Elvis Presley. Springsteen was devastated by his
 death in 1977; the song took three years to write. "The type of fame 
Elvis had . . . the pressure of it, the isolation that it seems to 
require, has gotta be really painful," Springsteen said.<br>
<br>
<br>
75- We Are Alive<br>
2012<br>
<br>
Springsteen was nearly done with Wrecking Ball when he realized it could
 use one song to wrap it up. "I needed a strange kind of party," he 
said. "A party filled with ghosts. It's a party filled with the dead, 
but whose voices and spirit and ideas remain with us." Max Weinberg said
 they originally cut the song sort of like the Ramones would have, but 
they eventually settled on a folkier vibe, built around a horn riff 
borrowed from Johnny Cash's "Ring of Fire."</div>

1988<br>
<br>
This outtake from The River sessions emerged in 1988 as the B side to 
"One Step Up." By then its frenetic spitfire tale of a desperate man 
trying to save his family after the Three Mile Island nuclear disaster 
took on a chilling new meaning following the Chernobyl meltdown. 
Explaining why he left it off The River, Spring­steen said, 
"Maybe . . . I thought it was too specific."<br>
<br>
<br>
77- Two Faces<br>
1987<br>
<br>
"Two Faces" is the bleakest song on Tunnel of Love, with Springsteen 
singing about making his wife cry and destroying the relationship. "I 
wanted to write a different kind of romantic song," he said. "One that 
took in the different types of emotional experiences of any relationship
 where you are really engaging with that person and not involved in a 
narcissistic romantic fantasy or intoxication or whatever."<br>
<br>
<br>
78- My Hometown<br>
1984<br>
<br>
"I used to think that once I got out of town, I was never going to come 
back," Springsteen said of his native Freehold, New Jersey, where he 
grew up. "I realized I would always carry a part of that town with me no
 matter where I went or what I did." Springsteen was living in 
California when he wrote "My Hometown," a scathing indictment of 
post-industrial America. Originally titled "Your Hometown," it was 
demo'ed as a speedy rockabilly tune.<br>
<br>
<br>
79- The Ties That Bind<br>
1980<br>
<br>
Springsteen's love for mid-Sixties garage rock and British Invasion hits
 runs through the opening track from The River. Although Springsteen is a
 meticulous record-maker, this song was cut fast, in a day, to retain 
its freshness. "I knew I wanted more of the roughness and spontaneity of
 our live show," Springsteen wrote in Songs, describing his approach to 
The River. "I was determined to let the band play live and let the music
 happen."<br>
<br>
<br>
80- Out in The Street<br>
1980<br>
<br>
Springsteen's homage to The Easybeat's " Friday On My Mind, "Out in the 
Street" turns the one-take bar-band feel Springsteen wanted for The 
River into what might be his most unencumbered declaration of freedom 
through community. Van Zandt, who became a co-producer on the album, 
shares euphoric vocals, and Max Weinberg's clarion song-opening shot 
more than meets Springsteen's demand: "I wanted the snare drum to 
explode."<br>
<br>
81- Night<br>
1975<br>
<br>
"The characters on Born to Run were less eccentric and less local than 
on Greetings and . . . Innocent," Springsteen wrote in Songs. "They 
could have been anybody and everybody." That's certainly true of 
"Night": The only song on Born to Run under three minutes, it's an 
archetypal straight-ahead car song with a Chuck Berry-esque opening line
 Springsteen grafted from a 1970 Steel Mill song called "Oh Mama."<br>
<br>
<br>
82- Drive All Night<br>
1980<br>
<br>
Springsteen first recorded the hypnotic "Drive All Night" for Darkness 
on the Edge of Town, but it had little chance of making that album: A 
lengthy, soul-based love song, it didn't mesh with Darkness' concise 
tracks. He inserted bits of "Drive All Night" into live versions of 
"Backstreets" and found room for it on The River. Until 1999's "Land of 
Hope and Dreams," it seemed like it would be the last of his sprawling 
epics.<br>
<br>
<br>
83- Lonesome Day<br>
2002<br>
<br>
With this driving E Street showcase, Springsteen found a way to combine 
his more personal Nineties songwriting with a broader outlook (and to 
replace his overused synths with violin). "The first verse, it feels 
like it's a guy who's talking to his girl," he said. "The second 
verse . . . I switched out of this personal thing to this sort of 
overall emotional mood and the feelings that were in the air in the 
States. But . . . one thing works with the other."<br>
<br>
<br>
84- Pink Cadillac<br>
1984<br>
<br>
Combining an image from Elvis Presley's "Baby Let's Play House" with a 
lean rockabilly rhythm, Springsteen emerged with one of his sexiest 
tracks. "This is a song about the conflict between worldly things and 
spiritual health, between desires of the flesh and spiritual ecstasy," 
he once said onstage. It was the B side to "Dancing in the Dark," and 
Natalie Cole had a surprise hit with the song in 1988.<br>
<br>
<br>
85- Fade Away<br>
1980<br>
<br>
Springsteen described the mood of this hushed, agonized ballad as 
follows: "Have you ever felt a love that you've had slipping away? That 
is an ugly feeling. You don't know what you can do to fix it, probably 
nothing." The song also suggests heartbroken girl-group pop, and the 
choked, almost adenoidal vocals borrow from Elvis Costello circa 
"Alison." It's one of Van Zandt's favorite Springsteen songs.<br>
<br>
<br>
86- Restless Nights<br>
1998<br>
<br>
In the summer of 1979, Springsteen practically wore out his cassette of 
Raspberries' Best. "They were great little pop records – I loved the 
production, and when I went into the studio, a lot of the things we did 
were like that," he recalled. "Two-, three-, four-minute pop songs, 
coming one after another." One of the best of his power-pop nuggets is 
this outtake from The River – few other artists would toss aside such a 
perfectly catchy chorus.<br>
<br>
<br>
87- Bobby Jean<br>
1984<br>
<br>
"If you got a good friend out here . . . that means something to you, 
this is for you, 'cause there ain't nothing like it," Springsteen said, 
introducing this song in 1984. This Born in the U.S.A. rocker was widely
 seen as his farewell to Van Zandt, who left the band just before the 
album's release (but returned about 15 years later). The song's aching 
nostalgia is summed up in one of Clemons' most evocative sax solos.<br>
<br>
<br>
88- Devils and Dust<br>
2005<br>
<br>
Devils &amp; Dust, 2005<br>
<br>
Much of Devils &amp; Dust was written during the Tom Joad tour, but the 
title track was inspired by the Iraq War. "It is basically a song about a
 soldier's point of view," Springsteen said. "But it kind of opens up to
 a lot of other interpretations." It was attempted as an angry rocker 
and a ballad, before Brendan O'Brien found a middle ground. Said 
Springsteen, "It picks up a little instrumental beef as it goes."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
89- Blinded By The Light<br>
1973<br>
<br>
Springsteen wrote this in hopes of meeting his label's desire for a hit –
 and in fact Manfred Mann took it to Number One three years later. 
Springsteen has described the track – written with "a rhyming dictionary
 in one hand and a notebook in the other" – as a sort of coded 
autobiography: "I wanted to get blinded by the light, I wanted to do 
things I hadn't done, see things I hadn't seen."<br>
<br>
<br>
90- Back In Your Arms<br>
1998<br>
<br>
The 1995 documentary Blood Brothers shows Springsteen and a reunited E 
Street Band painstakingly working on this song. After it finally ended 
up on Tracks, fans fell in love with its sad, organ-fueled recollection 
of a past love. When the group played it on the 1999 reunion tour, it 
seemed Springsteen was singing about his bandmates in the line "all the 
love I've thrown away and lost."<br>
<br>
<br>
91- Ramrod<br>
1980<br>
<br>
"Ramrod" isn't exactly Springsteen's deepest song. It's simply a 
barnburner about a hard-working guy looking to take a pretty girl on a 
drive. "His cleanest, coolest, purest track," said superfan Stephen 
King. The song explodes onstage, often stretching into the 10-minute 
range with false stops and James Brown-like collapses, causing Van Zandt
 to "revive" the fallen Springsteen.<br>
<br>
<br>
92- Sad Eyes<br>
1998<br>
<br>
Recorded shortly after Springsteen had broken up the E Street Band and 
relocated to L.A., this rarity wasn't released until eight years after 
it was recorded. Studio musicians like bassist Randy Jackson and Toto 
drummer Jeff Porcaro give it a modern feel. It also harks back to rock's
 past, from a lyric that could have been in any number of lovelorn 
Fifties hits to Springsteen's falsetto. "I tried to write something that
 was soul-oriented," he said.<br>
<br>
<br>
93- The E Street Shuffle<br>
1973<br>
<br>
The slippery junkyard funk of this track, complete with clavinet, tuba, 
bongos and a horn riff interpolated from Major Lance's "The Monkey 
Time," is utterly unlike the stadium stomp that would become the E 
Street Band's signature. Few songs give a better sense of what the 
earliest incarnations of the group sounded like live. Says Craig Finn, 
"The way he references the band, it's like a mission statement."<br>
<br>
<br>
94- If I Were The Priest<br>
1972<br>
<br>
The first time Springsteen met John Hammond, the legendary talent scout 
asked whether he had any songs that he would never perform live. 
Springsteen responded with this cowboy ballad about a town where Jesus 
is the sheriff and the Virgin Mary runs the Holy Grail Saloon. "When he 
sang that song," Hammond later recalled, "I knew he could only be 
Catholic."<br>
<br>
<br>
95- All That Heaven Will Allow<br>
1987<br>
<br>
Like so many of the great songs on Tunnel of Love, "All That Heaven Will
 Allow" lays bare the hope and fear of a man in love. Springsteen sings 
about steps in a couple's life together – a date in a nightclub, sharing
 a house, the dread of dying too young. He even tries to talk his way 
past a nightclub bouncer ("Come on, Slim, slip me in, man"). The song 
became a centerpiece of the 1988 tour, with a long introduction 
co-starring Clemons and set on a park bench.<br>
<br>
<br>
96- Long Walk Home<br>
2007<br>
<br>
"Long Walk Home" reflects a turbulent time in America, marked by 
economic decline, constitutional decay and endless foreign wars. It's no
 accident that this is the song Springsteen quoted when he endorsed 
Barack Obama for president in 2008. "He speaks to the America I've 
envisioned in my music for the past 35 years," Springsteen said. "A 
place where 'nobody crowds you, and nobody goes it alone.'"<br>
<br>
<br>
97- County Fair<br>
2003<br>
<br>
Cut in 1983, this song didn't get its first official release for another
 20 years. And though "County Fair" was written in the wake of Nebraska,
 it feels worlds away from that album's stark hard-luck tales. It opens 
with acoustic guitar and the sound of crickets chirping, as Spring­steen
 sings about small-town romance on a summer evening, riding the roller 
coaster and dancing to a local band called James Young and the Immortal 
Ones.<br>
<br>
<br>
98- Brothers Under The Bridge<br>
1998<br>
<br>
There's a Springsteen song with a nearly identical title: an uptempo E 
Street rave-up left off Born in the U.S.A. This "Brothers" is entirely 
different, a stripped-down Vietnam ballad that puts all the pain up 
front. Over military drum taps, Springsteen sings about a homeless vet 
who hides out with other men like him at a California campsite, trying 
to avoid the highway patrol and his own memories.<br>
<br>
<br>
99- American Land<br>
2012<br>
<br>
Originally recorded during The Seeger Sessions in 2006, "American Land" 
turns a poem written by a 19th-century steelworker (and set to music by 
Pete Seeger) into Springsteen's version of a Pogues song. It's a rowdy 
Irish jig celebrating the American-immigrant experience, the Celtic 
strain in the roots-rock tradition and the unbridled joy of performing, 
in this land or any other.<br>
<br>
<br>
100- Fire<br>
1986<br>
<br>
One of Springsteen's most covered tunes (it's been done by everyone from
 Cher to Link Wray), "Fire" was written in 1977 to be sung by Elvis 
Presley; as Spring­steen has said, "I sent [Elvis] a demo of it, but he 
died before it arrived." The Pointer Sisters' rendition became a Number 
Two hit, but Springsteen's take on Live/1975-85 ignites the 
Fifties-style torch song's soft-loud dynamic like no one else's.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen- By the book<br>
<br>
New York Times Review of Books<br>
<br>
Oct 30, 2014</strong><br>
<br>
The musician and author of the new picture book “Outlaw Pete” likes 
reading about cosmology: “I find men and women struggling to answer the 
deepest questions we can ask freeing.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What books are currently on your night stand?<br>
<br>
I just finished “Moby-Dick,” which scared me off for a long time due to 
the hype of its difficulty. I found it to be a beautiful boy’s adventure
 story and not that difficult to read. Warning: You will learn more 
about whales than you have ever wished to know. On the other hand, I 
never wanted it to end. Also, “Love in the Time of Cholera,” by Gabriel 
García Márquez. It simply touched on so many aspects of human love.<br>
<br>
Who is your favorite novelist of all time, and your favorite novelist writing today?<br>
<br>
I like the Russians, the Chekhov short stories, Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky.
 I never read any of them until the past four years, and found them to 
be thoroughly psychologically modern. Personal favorites: “The Brothers 
Karamazov” and, of course, “Anna Karenina.”<br>
<br>
Current favorites: Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy and Richard Ford. It’s 
hard to beat “American Pastoral,” “I Married a Communist” and “Sabbath’s
 Theater.” Cormac McCarthy’s “Blood Meridian” remains a watermark in my 
reading. It’s the combination of Faulkner and Sergio Leone’s spaghetti 
westerns that gives the book its spark for me. I love the way Richard 
Ford writes about New Jersey. “The Sportswriter,” “Independence Day” and
 “The Lay of the Land” are all set on my stomping grounds and, besides 
being poignant and hilarious, nail the Jersey Shore perfectly.<br>
<br>
Who are your favorite New Jersey writers?<br>
<br>
Roth for his bawdy, rowdy humor, excellence and longevity. Ford, as I 
mentioned above; and of course Walt Whitman is pretty good. The summer 
always makes me want to pick up “Leaves of Grass” for a while and sit on
 the front porch. I come away happier.<br>
<br>
What book, if any, most influenced your decision to become a songwriter 
and musician or contributed to your artistic development?<br>
<br>
I skipped most of college, becoming a road musician, so I didn’t begin 
reading seriously until 28 or 29. Then it was Flannery O’Connor; James 
M. Cain; John Cheever; Sherwood Anderson; and Jim Thompson, the great 
noir writer. These authors contributed greatly to the turn my music took
 around 1978-82. They brought out a sense of geography and the dark 
strain in my writing, broadened my horizons about what might be 
accomplished with a pop song and are still the cornerstone literally for
 what I try to accomplish today.<br>
<br>
Who are your favorite musician-writers? Your favorite memoir by a musician?<br>
<br>
I’m not familiar with the musician/novelist, but as far as memoirs, it’s
 hard to beat Keith Richards’s love of music that shines through in 
“Life.” I also found Eric Clapton’s autobiography to be surprisingly 
revealing and very moving. Of course I loved Bob Dylan’s “Chronicles.” 
It made me proud to be a musician.<br>
<br>
What books might we be surprised to find on your shelves?<br>
<br>
Continue reading the main storyContinue reading the main story<br>
I read a lot on cosmology and a reasonable amount of philosophy. I also 
like to read about baseball, having just finished Mariano Rivera’s 
autobiography. For cosmology, “Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos,” by Dennis 
Overbye, was one of my first favorites. I find men and women struggling 
to answer the deepest questions we can ask freeing. It also puts in 
scale whatever my small problems of the day might be. The book that 
turned me on to philosophy was Bertrand Russell’s “The History of 
Western Philosophy.” I just finished “Examined Lives,” by Jim Miller, 
and “How to Live; Or, A Life of Montaigne,” by Sarah Bakewell.<br>
<br>
What are the best books about music you’ve read?<br>
<br>
At the top of my list remains Greil Marcus’s “Mystery Train,” followed 
closely by Peter Guralnick’s “Last Train to Memphis.” I’d include 
Dylan’s “Chronicles” and a recent book by Daniel Lanois, “Soul Mining,” 
that gives insights into the making of music I found unique from any 
other book out there. “Sonata for Jukebox,” by Geoffrey O’Brien, has 
some lovely chapters in it, particularly its opening discussions of Burt
 Bacharach’s career.<br>
<br>
What’s the last book you read that made you laugh?<br>
<br>
Richard Ford’s “The Lay of the Land.”<br>
<br>
The last book that made you cry?<br>
<br>
Cormac McCarthy’s “The Road.”<br>
<br>
The last book that made you furious?<br>
<br>
“Too Big to Fail,” by Andrew Ross Sorkin; Michael Lewis’s “The Big 
Short”; and “Someplace Like America,” by Dale Maharidge, with 
photographs by Michael S. Williamson. These are a few of the books I 
read on the recent financial collapse, and I contributed the foreword to
 “Someplace Like America.” The criminal outrage and recklessness 
described in these books led directly to my “Wrecking Ball” album.<br>
<br>
What kind of reader were you as a child?<br>
<br>
The first book I read was “The Wizard of Oz,” one lazy summer on my 
front porch on Randolph Street in New Jersey. I remember being thrilled 
by the book and the act of reading. Over time my most beloved character 
became the great and powerful Oz himself. He’s summed up by that great 
quote that’s in the film, but not in the book: “Pay no attention to that
 man behind the curtain.” He’s a carny phony, in way over his head, who 
manages to pull it off anyway. “Pay no attention to that man behind the 
curtain.” One of the great quotes in American literature.<br>
<br>
If you had to name one book that made you who you are today, what would it be?<br>
<br>
One would be difficult, but the short stories of Flannery O’Connor 
landed hard on me. You could feel within them the unknowability of God, 
the intangible mysteries of life that confounded her characters, and 
which I find by my side every day. They contained the dark Gothicness of
 my childhood and yet made me feel fortunate to sit at the center of 
this swirling black puzzle, stars reeling overhead, the earth barely 
beneath us.<br>
<br>
You’re hosting a literary dinner with three writers. Who’s invited?<br>
<br>
Philip Roth, Keith Richards, Tolstoy — and one extra, Bob Dylan. A lot 
of life experience there, and the babbling in different tongues would be
 wonderful.<br>
<br>
What books do you find yourself returning to again and again?<br>
<br>
I don’t read many books twice, but Jim Thompson novels — due to their 
concise, dirty power, their relentless violence and purity — can always 
draw me in for a second time. Some of the most psychological crime 
writing ever done. I love James M. Cain and Elmore Leonard, but Jim 
Thompson holds a special place in my heart.<br>
<br>
What books are you embarrassed not to have read yet?<br>
<br>
I read “The Grapes of Wrath” very late, long after I’d written the song 
“Ghost of Tom Joad.” However, it ended up being everything I’d hoped it 
to be. I haven’t read “East of Eden” yet, and I’d like to.<br>
<br>
What do you plan to read next?<br>
<br>
I loved “The Adventures of Augie March,” by Saul Bellow, and someone 
just gave me “Henderson the Rain King,” so that may be up next.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">When Bruce Springsteen Helped Bring Down the Berlin Wall<br>
Greg Mitchell<br>
Huffington Post<br>
 11/04/2014 </strong><br>
<br>
With the 25th anniversary of the fall of the first break in the Berlin 
Wall coming later this week, I posted here at few days ago about a 
landmark concert by Bob Dylan in East Berlin two years before that, in 
1987 -- and a secret police (Stasi) document on the event. Dylan gave a 
rather lackluster, apolitical performance, but a year later Bruce 
Springsteen took quite a different turn.<br>
<br>
Springsteen arrived to play to his biggest crowd ever -- at 300,000 
nearly four times what Dylan drew. And the climax of his show was a song
 that Dylan didn't choose to sing: "Chimes of Freedom." <br>
<br>
As the No. 2 editor at Crawdaddy for almost the entire decade of the 
1970s -- and an early promoter and friend of Bruce Springsteen -- I've 
always been fascinated by claims that he played a part in helping to 
"knock down" the Wall. There's even a recent book about it, Rocking the 
Wall (Berlinica), also based partly on Stasi files. This is a general 
subject I'm starting to delve into deeply for an upcoming book and film.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's epic four-hour show, beyond the outdoor concert grounds, 
was beamed to millions more via state television. You might ask why, 
given the decades long official repression in the Communist state. But 
tensions and anger among young people had been building in East Germany 
as controls loosened in some other Eastern bloc nations in the era of 
Gorbachev's "glasnost." State officials deemed the occasional concert by
 a Western rock star as a way for the kids to blow off steam rather than
 take to the streets in protests. So they allowed the party's youth 
organization to invite a few rockers.<br>
<br>
But Springsteen that day in July 1988 went much farther than others. "It
 was a nail in the coffin for East Germany," one fan who attended told 
The Guardian years later.<br>
<br>
Bruce played one of his very long sets -- 32 songs -- and delivered an 
impassioned speech in grade school but effective enough German: "I'm not
 here for any government. I've come to play rock 'n' roll for you in the
 hope that one day all the barriers will be torn down." Apparently Bruce
 decided at the last minute to change his original word, "walls," to 
"barriers." But the Dylan song that followed includes the key reference 
to "while the walls were tightening."<br>
<br>
A German historian, Gerd Dietrich, would tell Erik Kirschbaum, author Rocking the Wall:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">"Springsteen's concert and speech certainly 
contributed in a large sense to the events leading up to the fall of the
 wall. It made people ... more eager for more and more change ... 
Springsteen aroused a greater interest in the west. It showed people how
 locked up they really were."</em><br>
<br>
And Springsteen would later reflect: "Once in a while you play a place, 
you play a show that ends up staying inside of you, living with you for 
the rest of your life," he said. "East Berlin in 1988 was certainly one 
of them." And showing another side of his political interests: Not long 
ago, Bruce penned the preface for my book on Bush, and media, failures 
on Iraq.</div>
