****<br>
Los Angeles Times , <br>
September 26, 2007<br>
By Mel Evans<br>
<br>
There comes a point in most believers' lives where when faith transforms
 from an inevitability to a choice. Something alters life's usual 
patterns - a personal tragedy, perhaps, or an intellectual realization -
 and what seemed so true suddenly can't be trusted. This isn't true just
 for God-fearing people; any creed is vulnerable to such a crisis. 
Getting past it can feel like an accomplishment or a sneaking betrayal, 
depending on whether you genuinely renew your convictions or just decide
 that credulity is the best way to survive. <br>
<br>
Few artists must feel the obligation to keep the faith as heavily as 
Bruce Springsteen. For nearly 40 years, he's relentlessly returned to 
one great subject: that moment when an ordinary person confronts some 
higher power, whether it's love or death or the state patrol, and makes 
an ennobling if sometimes fatally wrong-headed commitment to act. <br>
<br>
Springsteen's fascination with these personal epiphanies has earned him a
 massive cult, and why not? His lyrics blend religious and secular 
scenarios to describe the various apocalypses his fans might encounter 
in their own lives. Rife with Catholic imagery but attached to the kind 
of rousing rock that follows directly from American revivalist and black
 church traditions, Springsteen turns his tales into rituals. Each 
hearing allows the committed fan to renew her devotion, not just to the 
Boss, but to her own path. <br>
<br>
What happens, though, when the prophet begins to wonder if it's all a 
hollow game? That's when the choice comes in, to reinvest or abandon 
ship. On "Magic," Springsteen's 16th studio album and the latest to 
reunite him the E Street Band - his gospel choir - he recommits fully to
 the uplifting oomph of his rock 'n' roll formula. <br>
<br>
Zealots (and when it comes to the Boss, the most casual rock fans become
 zealots) will thrill to what the E Street Band accomplishes on "Magic,"
 which gets a full release Tuesday after a vinyl sneak last week. 
Roadhouse rock that would lie flaccid in anybody else's hands hooks the 
ear, sounding not exactly fresh, but urgent, necessary. <br>
<br>
Springsteen pulls out all of his vocal tricks - the breathy bluesman's 
bark, the ex-choirboy croon, the vaguely Western hobo snarl - and smiles
 as they sell so beautifully. He does the same thing with his lyrics; it
 seems impossible that this catechism-quoter could get away with another
 line like "Your tears, they fill the rosary/at your feet, my temple of 
bones," but within the somber and deliberately repetitive setting of 
"I'll Work for Your Love," he does. Even for a lapsed Springsteenian 
like this critic, the sheer backbone of this album offers delight. <br>
<br>
But a sadder and wiser willfulness permeates these 12 tracks. It's 
present in Brendan O'Brien's production, the music, which removes all 
gunk from the formulas Springsteen's been using forever and gets them 
shining. And it's deeply embedded in lyrics that examine what happens 
after illusions are shattered, and life just goes on. <br>
<br>
The first doubter Springsteen confronts is himself. "Radio Nowhere," the
 album's lead track and first single, depicts the Boss lost on a lonely 
highway, wondering if he can connect to anything pop has to offer now. 
The song is discouragingly fogeyish if considered from a topical 
standpoint: Tom Petty already wrote a protest song about corporate 
radio, and Springsteen's refrain, "I just want to feel some rhythm," 
seems an odd complaint, considering how much Kanye West and Beyonc? gets
 airtime these days. <br>
<br>
But as an opening invocation, "Radio Nowhere," gains force. Producer 
Brendan O'Brien compresses the nine-piece E Street Band's contributions 
into a single groove, all seemingly emanating from Nils Lofgren's? 
choogling guitar riff. The circular structure Springsteen often employs -
 in which one phrase tumbles into another like Jack Kerouac's unfurling 
scroll - takes his words beyond surface meaning. The chanted refrain, 
which soon transforms to "I just want to feel your rhythm," signals 
entry into that sacred zone where the communal clout of the E Street 
Band turns worn rock tropes into revelations. <br>
<br>
From that point on, "Magic" unfolds beyond any reference point besides 
Springsteen's own body of work - which makes sense, since it's a ritual 
object, with every song designed to fit into the arena shows where 
devotees will soon commune. <br>
<br>
Elements of old favorites continually surface: - "Livin' in the Future" 
resurrects the jumping horns of "Tenth Avenue Freeze Out,"; there's a 
whiff of "I Wanna Marry You" around "Girls in Their Summer Clothes,"; 
the descending chorus of "Long Walk Home" reaches back to "My Hometown."
 Under O'Brien's relentlessly strict guidance (this is one clean, 
tight-sounding record), every E Streeter finds his Zen: the keyboards 
build moodily, sax man Clarence Clemons blusters with more focus than 
usual, those Lofgren/Steve Van Zandt guitar riffs rip, and Max Weinberg 
is a big-hearted machine on the drums. <br>
<br>
And though the songs on "Magic" tell stories, only one - the eerie 
"Devil's Arcade," in which a lover pleads with the ghost, perhaps 
living, of her desert-damaged soldier boy - aims for the specificity of 
earlier ballads such as "Meeting Across the River" or "Sinaloa Cowboys."
 <br>
<br>
Instead, some revisit very familiar scenarios, like a girl's front porch
 or a highway at night, but inject much more ambiguity into the scenes. 
Others, like "Your Own Worst Enemy" and the title track, aren't story 
songs at all. They're extended metaphors, exploring the emotional 
experience of self-questioning in ways that end up feeling surprisingly 
personal. <br>
<br>
Fans have had decades of fun scouring the Jersey Shore for the origins 
of Springsteen's characters, but those he gives life to on "Magic" could
 exist in many contexts. The manipulative ing?nue in "You'll Be Comin' 
Down" could be Marilyn or Britney; the lost bohemian warrior of "Gypsy 
Biker" might be a war casualty, but by verse three he seems to have 
transformed into Terry Magovern?, Springsteen's longtime personal 
assistant, who died in July (he's also the subject of the hidden track 
"Terry's Song"). <br>
<br>
"Magic" is a record of this moment - Springsteen makes quiet reference 
throughout to what he sees as an errant Bush administration and, 
alternately, to a marriage at sometimes shaky mid-life - but it also 
aims for timelessness. <br>
<br>
It's the way Springsteen injects his American Bible stories with the air
 of disbelief that makes "Magic" a truly mature and memorable album. He 
knows his fans need that rush, that jump outside their own feelings of 
disappointment and limitation, that he's given them for so long. Yet 
more and more, he seems to realize that disappointment and limitation 
are his m?tier, and that sometimes a giant saxophone fill and a chorus 
about hungry hearts can't solve the problem. "Magic" bares its own 
devices beautifully, providing a kind of transcendence that allows for 
listeners to keep their feet on the ground. It's worthy of the choice to
 believe</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen: Back at his barnstorming best</strong><br>
<br>
More than three decades since 'Born to Run' catapulted him to fame, 
Bruce Springsteen is back at his barnstorming best. His epic new album 
lays bare the fault lines running under contemporary America ? and the 
tunes are great, too<br>
<br>
The Independent , <br>
September 27, 2007<br>
By Andy Gill<br>
<br>
Next Monday sees the release of Bruce Springsteen's new album Magic, a 
long-awaited reunion with his old comrades The E Street Band. It follows
 a sustained period in which his musical interests have leant 
predominantly towards more low-key, folksy settings, with 2005's Devils 
and Dust, a sombre series of character studies in the bleak acoustic 
manner of Nebraska, succeeded last April by his hootenanny tribute to 
the godfather of politicised folk music, The Seeger Sessions. <br>
<br>
Already acclaimed as a return to the ebullient style of those classic 
crowd-pleasers Born to Run and Born in the USA, and hailed ahead of its 
release as his most significant work in years, it's a great piece of 
work, its pumped-up wall of sound and lacquered surfaces disguising the 
kind of troubled ruminations on society and morality that have made 
Springsteen the pre-eminent political songwriter of his era. Not that 
everyone sees it that way, of course. His manager Jon Landau, for 
instance - the man who, as a Rolling Stone rock critic, came up with the
 now legendary claim: "I have seen rock'*'roll's future, and its name is
 Bruce Springsteen" ? has described Magic as "a very bright record", the
 primary intention of which is not political. To which one can but 
respond in the time-honoured manner of aggrieved NME letter-writers: 
"Was he listening to the same record as me?" Songs such as "Gypsy 
Biker", " Last to Die", "Devil's Arcade" and "Your Own Worst Enemy" are 
not just clearly political, they represent the most complete and damning
 denunciation of Bush's foolhardy adventurism in Iraq yet thrown up by 
rock music. <br>
<br>
But then Springsteen, like any articulate songwriter grappling with 
complex issues beyond the pop imperatives of dancing and romancing, has 
always been prey to misinterpretation ? most spectacularly when Ronald 
Reagan's campaign chiefs managed to mis-read "Born in the USA" as a 
feelgood patriotic anthem, rather than an indictment of the country's 
social decay as seen through the eyes of a Vietnam veteran. Quite 
obviously, in that case at least, they absolutely weren't listening to 
the same record as the rest of us. <br>
<br>
For me, the success of this latest batch of songs resides in the way 
Springsteen approaches his subject. Firstly, the big issue is never 
mentioned directly, looming intangibly instead, as he depicts the 
effects of combatants' death or disability on friends and relatives in 
the US ? a distancing technique that has the paradoxical effect of 
bringing the war closer to home. Secondly, in order to convey the 
longer-term ramifications of the conflict, several songs feature 
projections into a scarred, uncertain future, rather than into the 
romantic past that once dominated his albums. And thirdly, there is ? or
 there "appears" to be, I should perhaps phrase it in the circumstances ?
 an underlying theme of illusion and deception running throughout the 
album that surely allegorises the ethical sleight-of-hand that has 
thrown his country's moral compass out of alignment. Betrayal is a 
constant companion in these songs, whether it's the craven media 
lambasted in "Radio Nowhere" as Bruce vainly spins his radio dial 
searching for "a world with some soul", the " speculators [who] made 
their money on the blood you shed" in " Gypsy Biker", or the "sinkin' 
sound of somethin' righteous goin' under" as the groundswell of 
post-9/11 patriotism is hijacked to perfidious ends in "Livin' in the 
Future". As Springsteen warns in the title-track, "Trust none of what 
you hear, and less of what you see. " <br>
<br>
That advice, however, might well be heeded by those of us ? myself 
included ? who would try to confine Springsteen to their own preferred 
interpretation of him. Just as there are many fans ? particularly 
non-American fans ? who like to characterise Bruce as a man of virtue 
and probity, one of the last hold-outs for an increasingly tarnished set
 of American values, there are doubtless millions of others who'd prefer
 to draw a discreet veil over the conscience-tweaking concerns of The 
Ghost of Tom Joad, and simply exult in The Boss's capacity for 
good-time, boozy rock'*'roll fun. And who is to say they are wrong? <br>
<br>
Certainly not Springsteen himself, who remains a firm believer in the 
notion of individuals having "multiple selves". During his VH1 
Storytellers show in 2005, he recounted an amusing tale of how a couple 
had spied him leaving a New Jersey strip-joint and upbraided him in the 
parking lot, telling him he shouldn't be there. "I'm not," he responded 
mischievously. "I am simply an errant figment of one of Bruce's many 
selves. I drift in the ether over the highways and byways of the Garden 
State, often touching down in image-incongruous but fun places. Bruce 
does not even know I am missing. He is at home right now, doing good 
deeds!" Which is a lot more fun ? and considerably more polite ? than 
just telling them to mind their own damn business, the inalienable right
 of any public figure pestered during their private time. <br>
<br>
For a long time, however, Bruce Springsteen would not have turned any 
heads as he exited a strip club. An ineffectual high-school student 
sustained by dreams of rock'*'roll stardom, he spent his teenage years 
performing in local New Jersey bands like The Castiles, Steel Mill, 
Sundance Blues Band and Dr Zoom &amp; The Sonic Boom, groups whose names
 indicate the diverse range of musics with which he developed a 
familiarity: R&amp;B, rock'*'roll, heavy metal, blues, soul, and 
whatever psychedelic delights were indulged by Dr Zoom. By the time he 
was 23, he had assembled around him the musicians who would form the 
core of The E Street Band, and had developed the facility at writing 
verbose, Dylanesque songs that originally attracted the attention of 
John Hammond, the legendary talent scout who had discovered Billie 
Holiday, Charlie Christian, Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin and Leonard 
Cohen. <br>
<br>
As with Dylan before him, it initially seemed as if Springsteen would be
 another "Hammond's Folly", as his early albums Greetings from Asbury 
Park, NJ and The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle struggled 
to find an audience, and the "new Dylan" millstone seemed like it might 
become the headstone on his faltering career. By the time he came to 
make his third album, he knew it was his last throw of the dice, and so 
pulled out all the stops, his band spending months painstakingly 
layering the instrumental parts that might help realise his vision of a 
combination of Dylan's wordiness, Roy Orbison's operatic delivery, and 
Phil Spector's Wall of Sound. Finally, after Clarence Clemons had spent 
16 hours piecing together, fragment by fragment, the sax solo on " 
Jungleland", Springsteen declared the album finished, even though by 
that time he had grown thoroughly sick of the way it "ate up everyone's 
life" . Born to Run was released on 25 August 1975. Two months later, 
Bruce Springsteen achieved the unprecedented feat of appearing on the 
covers of both Time and Newsweek simultaneously. <br>
<br>
Born to Run almost instantly became one of rock's landmark works, while 
the years of playing small clubs now paid off handsomely, as Bruce's 
band became famous as the most thrilling and cathartic live act on the 
circuit. But the vertiginous turnaround in his fortunes also had a 
seismic effect on Springsteen's life. As he explained in an insightful 
interview by Phil Sutcliffe in Mojo: "Fame... is interesting because it 
makes you very present and you have a lot of impact, but it also 
separates you and makes you very singular. You're now having an 
experience that not many other people you know are having. Its irony is 
that it carries its own type of loneliness." <br>
<br>
His response to that loneliness was evident on the 1978 follow-up album 
Darkness on the Edge of Town. Where Born to Run had been brash and 
ebullient, an optimistic celebration of rock'*'roll's liberating spirit 
and a romanticised indulgence of its street mythology, new songs like 
the title-track and "Racing in the Street" were sombre pieces, haunted 
by failure, regret and spurned hope, while the protagonists of "Factory"
 and "The Promised Land" were frustrated working men with " death in 
their eyes" and violence on their mind. In the three years since he had 
been catapulted to stardom, Springsteen had developed the social 
conscience that increasingly came to dominate his work, from sources as 
diverse as John Ford's film of The Grapes of Wrath and the writings of 
historian Henry Steele Commager, which he claimed was: "The first thing I
 read that made me feel part of a historic continuum," and which 
cemented his ideas about civic duty and collective responsibility. His 
1980 work The River offered a rapprochement of sorts between the popular
 party anthems of Born to Run and the blue-collar anxieties of Darkness 
on the Edge of Town, but 1982's stark, solo acoustic offering Nebraska 
blindsided fans with its bleak, brutal depictions of cops, killers, 
lifers and losers, desperate men pushed to their limits and beyond. It 
didn't sell too well. <br>
<br>
Born in the USA, however, sold by the shedload. The 1984 release, a 
return to the bi-facial, party'*'ponder approach of The River, remains 
one of rock's most successful albums, shifting over 15 million copies in
 America alone. The E Street Band climbed back on the tour bus ? now 
more likely to be a private jet ? and hauled their way around the 
world's football stadia for a record-breaking concert schedule, during 
which Springsteen met model Julianne Phillips, who would become his 
first wife in May 1985. Sadly, it would prove a troubled union, the 
singer's unhappiness being reflected in the subsequent Tunnel of Love, 
an album replete with misgivings, reproach, and the kind of unfulfilled 
hopes that on previous releases would have been ascribed to downtrodden 
working men. <br>
<br>
Ironically, it was during the subsequent Tunnel of Love Express Tour in 
1988 that Springsteen's affair with backing singer Patti Scialfa would 
become public knowledge. He and Phillips divorced in 1990, and 
Springsteen married Scialfa the following year. With its low-key 
arrangements featuring drum machines and synthesiser, Tunnel of Love was
 unlike anything else he had recorded, and though it remains a critical 
and fan favourite, the circumstances surrounding it have made him 
reluctant to perform its songs live. <br>
<br>
Happily, his marriage to Scialfa has proven much more durable, producing
 three children, now aged between 13 and 17. As so often when creative 
types' demons are subdued, however, Springsteen's work has since largely
 lacked the bite and edge that once drove his muse. Subsequent releases 
such as Human Touch, Lucky Town and the mostly acoustic, overly 
finger-wagging The Ghost of Tom Joad were pale, anaemic affairs by his 
standards, and the post-9/11 offering The Rising, despite selling well 
in his homeland, seemed an ineffectual, confused response to the 
tragedy, short on insight and uncertain in its reaction to events. Once 
acutely aware of the tarnish on the great chrome bumper of the American 
Dream, in common with many of his countrymen he now seemed to exhibit a 
degree of difficulty in visualising his own country as it appeared from 
outside its borders. <br>
<br>
Thankfully, Springsteen's political gyroscope has since re-levelled, and
 he played an important part in the Vote For Change campaign encouraging
 the young, poor and minorities to register to vote, and his song "No 
Surrender" was adopted as John Kerry's campaign anthem during his 
unsuccessful run for president. And in 2006, Springsteen became absorbed
 in the project honouring the activist folk-singer Pete Seeger, for so 
long America's conscience, recording a selection of politicised 
traditional songs associated with Seeger in rumbustious hootenanny 
manner. It seemed to some like an acknowledgement of his true heritage, 
an acceptance that ultimately, he would have to assume Seeger's mantle 
as People's Tribune, and that when that time came, he would do so 
willingly. <br>
<br>
With Magic, he's getting his troops back in line behind him. It's 
Springsteen's most complex, textured work in years, as rich as any in 
his catalogue, with songs that both challenge, inform and entertain. He 
once observed, in his lyrics anthology Songs, that a song's emotional 
centre is dependent on the fellowship the writer feels with his subject,
 that when a lyric falls perfectly into place, "your voice disappears 
into the voices of those you've chosen to write about". On Magic this 
happens time and time again, as he proves himself a master of the 
empathy required to bring his characters to life in all their 
contradictory, multiple selves.</div>

<br>
Hartford Courant , <br>
October 3, 2007<br>
By Eric R. Danton<br>
<br>
New songs, new tour: Of course Bruce Springsteen was going to be good 
when he and the E Street Band opened their fall outing Tuesday night at 
the Hartford Civic Center. <br>
<br>
The Boss went one better, though, and put on a show he'll be 
hard-pressed to top between now and December, when the tour ends. Sorry,
 Philly. <br>
<br>
Playing for more than two hours, Springsteen struck a near-perfect 
balance between old songs and new, making the former as fresh and eager 
as he made the latter sound classic and vital. <br>
<br>
"So it begins!" he bellowed after the first number, "Radio Nowhere." 
It's also the first tune on his new album, "Magic," which was released 
Tuesday. Springsteen's gritty guitar riff echoed around the arena, 
Clarence Clemons' saxophone tore through the song like a runaway rocket 
and the Boss pleaded, "I just want to hear some rhythm" in the refrain. <br>
<br>
There was no shortage of that: The band played 23 songs, building 
momentum as the show went on: "Lonesome Day," the dark new song "Gypsy 
Biker," "Reason to Believe." <br>
<br>
And then it happened, on "Night": The Rock 'n' Roll Moment. It's that 
spark when an instant frozen in time seems to suddenly unspool, when the
 whole band locks in, turns a corner together and just takes off. <br>
<br>
Little Steven Van Zandt's over sharing the microphone with Springsteen, 
Clemons plants himself like an anchor and pumps his lungs into that sax,
 bassist Gary Tallent bops in the back and drummer Max Weinberg holds it
 all together with no-frills rhythm. <br>
<br>
It's glorious and it's rare, yet it happened time after time as 
Springsteen and his band resurrected the secret hopes and guarded dreams
 of a generation that found release in his music. <br>
<br>
It happened on "She's the One," the crowd roaring at the piano vamp that
 sends it off and thrills to the massive bomp-bomp-bomp, bomp-bomp Bo 
Diddley beat and Clemons' thunderous solo. <br>
<br>
It happened on "The Rising," Springsteen's somber anthem paying tribute 
to the heroes of 9/11; and on "Badlands" and, of course, "Born to Run," 
songs about transcending limitations and conquering the world. For a 
night in Hartford, Springsteen, his band and his fans did exactly that. <br>
<br>
It's a different world now from when Springsteen wrote those early 
songs, and he talked frankly at times about the differences. He decried 
"illegal wiretapping, rendition, black sites, an attack on the 
Constitution" before playing "Livin' in the Future," and introduced new 
song "Magic" as an allegory about an "Orwellian moment when what's true 
can be made to seem like a lie and what's a lie can be made to seem 
true, and we've witnessed the consequences over the past six years." <br>
<br>
All is not lost, however, and Springsteen ended the show on a hopeful 
note with "American Land," an Irish reel stacked with fiddle, accordion 
and penny whistle. Springsteen played the tune frequently last year 
during a tour for his album of songs popularized by Pete Seeger, and it 
made for an uncharacteristic, if joyful way to finish his first night on
 tour.</div>

</strong><br>
Philadelphia Inquirer , <br>
October 6, 2007<br>
By Dan DeLuca<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band concerts have a reputation 
that's 30+ years long to live up to as exhausting and exhilarating 
marathons that mix together enough musical inspiration and working-class
 perspiration to restore one's faith in the redemptive powers of rock 
and roll. <br>
<br>
On Friday night at the Wachovia Center, Springsteen took the stage 
dressed in black to the introductory instrumental strains of "The Daring
 Young Man on the Flying Trapeze," and shouted out a question to the 
sold-out crowd of middle-aged moms and dads (and their sons and 
daughters): "Is there anybody alive out there?" <br>
<br>
The two-hour-and-fifteen-minute show that followed - beginning with the 
hard-driving, straight to the solar plexus "Radio Nowhere," the first 
single from the 58-year-old Jersey guy's new album, Magic - certainly 
lived up to his vaunted rep, even if it was a little short by 
Springsteenian standards. <br>
<br>
The road to redemption on this night, though, was a rocky one. <br>
<br>
That's partly because Philadelphia was only the second stop on this 
tour, so momentum didn't always flow effortlessly and all the 
transitions in the 23-song set, which came to a close with the reeling 
Irish immigrant saga "American Land," weren't seamless. <br>
<br>
But it's largely because Springsteen doesn't go in for easily won, 
fairy-tale happy endings. And beneath its rollicking veneer, Magic is a 
dark journey through a house of mirrors of mistrust and deceit. <br>
<br>
The Boss filled Friday night's set with songs from his catalog whose 
protagonists feel the ground shake beneath their feet, like Tunnel of 
Love's "Brilliant Disguise," whose hero asks for "mercy on the man who 
doubts what he's sure of." Or the guy from the bleak Nebraska in "Reason
 To Believe," which was transformed into a rowdy roadhouse blues, who 
can't understand how people find the faith to keep on keepin' on. <br>
<br>
The E Streeters first with Springsteen in town since 2003 was filled 
with rousing rockers, many of which, from "Promised Land" to "Waitin' On
 A Sunny Day," made use of Clarence Clemons' wailing saxophone, almost 
always a signal of communal strength in a Springsteen song. <br>
<br>
The three lead guitarists all got their licks in: Nils Lofgren, the most
 gifted of the bunch, Steve Van Zandt, Sylvio Dante in a black babushka 
and snakeskin boots, and Springsteen, who played a five-alarm lead on 
"Candy's Room." <br>
<br>
But on a tour that's about getting back to rock and roll fundamentals, 
Soozie Tyrell's violin is as key an instrument as the guitar. Her 
sorrowful fiddle keyed the new album's title track, which "isn't about 
magic, it's about tricks," Springsteen said, as well as the gorgeously 
wrought war story "Devil's Arcade" and warmly melodic streetscape "Girls
 In Their Summer Clothes." <br>
<br>
Springsteen did most of his talking early on, before Magic's deceptively jaunty "Livin' In The Future." <br>
<br>
He said Philadelphia was full of things "we love about America: Philly 
cheese steaks . . . the Bill of Rights . . . baseball. I predict they 
will rise, though I can't guarantee it!" <br>
<br>
Then he grew more serious, saying the song was about "things happening 
these last six years that we never thought would happen in America: 
illegal wiretapping, no right to habeas corpus, the rolling back of 
civil liberties." <br>
<br>
The blue state crowd greeted him with some cheers, and some boos. <br>
<br>
The intertwining of the personal and the political was more powerfully 
expressed musically in a four strong stretch that brought the show to an
 emotional crescendo. The title track to Springsteen post-9/11 album, 
"The Rising," which seeks spiritual answers to the horrors of the Twin 
Towers falling, was followed by "Last To Die," which traces the death 
toll in Iraq to a belligerent response to Sept. 11. <br>
<br>
Then came "A Long Walk Home," a hymn that slowly built the strength to 
believe that faith can be restored. And that was followed by "Badlands,"
 the rousing warhorse that sounded as fresh as the day it was born and 
found the redemption Springsteen was looking for, every inch of it 
earned. <br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band will play at the Wachovia Center again at 7:30 Saturday night. The show is sold out.</div>

<br>
New York Times , <br>
October 19, 2007<br>
By Jon Pareles<br>
<br>
The Madison Square Garden crowd joyfully sang along with Bruce 
Springsteen on Wednesday night, not for the first or last time, as he 
reached the chorus of ?Lonesome Day?: ?It?s all right, it?s all right, 
it?s all right, yeah.? That?s what the sound of the E Street Band always
 says, surging past every bit of disillusionment, loss, bewilderment and
 bitterness in the verses. <br>
<br>
The sheer vitality of Mr. Springsteen, 58, belting an entire set of 
showstoppers straight from the gut and working the stage with his 
longtime band, provides all the hope the lyrics struggle to find. He?s 
as serious as any public figure alive, but he leaves audiences euphoric ?
 a paradox that only grows more profound as he endures. <br>
<br>
The music Mr. Springsteen makes with the E Street Band is grounded in 
the invincible sound of the pop he grew up on, particularly Phil 
Spector?s Wall of Sound. It echoes the glory days of early rock ?n? roll
 and an America that ? after World War II and before Vietnam ? was 
prosperous, confident and outwardly unified. <br>
<br>
His favorite chord progressions hark back to doo-wop; so do the 
saxophone tags of Clarence Clemons. There?s camaraderie in the music and
 among the musicians. The video screens above the stage would constantly
 intercut close-ups of the band members with their boss. <br>
<br>
Even when those old chords carry lyrics that are far more troubled than 
those of girl-group love songs, and even when songs expand into anthems 
and suites (like ?Thundercrack,? the encore Mr. Springsteen revived from
 his barnstorming live shows in the early 1970s), the music itself 
harbors no doubts, no second thoughts. <br>
<br>
Yet for decades Mr. Springsteen has sung about a world that grinds down 
dreams and betrays the promise of America. Six years into the second 
Bush administration, he is open about his political anger. He introduced
 the title song from his new album, ?Magic? (Columbia), with a comment 
about our ?Orwellian times,? when ?what?s true can be made to seem like a
 lie, and what?s lying can be made to seem true.? <br>
<br>
Playing the jovial M.C. while the band vamped the intro to another song 
from the album, ?Livin? in the Future,? he started out naming ?things 
that we love about America, like cheeseburgers, the Jersey Shore, the 
Bill of Rights, the Constitution,? and went on to warn about ?rolling 
back civil rights? and ?sleeping through all those changes that 
shouldn?t have happened here.? <br>
<br>
Concentrating on new songs, the set built into something like an 
extended argument about the meaning of home. Except for ?Brilliant 
Disguise,? a song about a troubled marriage that Mr. Springsteen sang in
 harmony with his wife, Patti Scialfa, there were few old hits before 
the encores. Instead Mr. Springsteen brought back songs like ?Adam 
Raised a Cain? and ?The Promised Land.? <br>
<br>
Most of the arrangements followed their recorded versions, with a vivid 
exception: ?Reason to Believe,? a quiet song from ?Nebraska? remade as a
 harmonica-huffing, John Lee Hooker-style blues boogie, tapping the 
blues for its alchemy of hard luck into pleasure. <br>
<br>
The set?s conclusion was an emotional seesaw: a new ballad, ?Devil?s 
Arcade,? for a soldier wounded in a desert war, and then ?The Rising,? 
nothing less than an incantatory ritual of mourning and redemption. 
?Last to Die? and ?Long Walk Home? contemplated the current morass. <br>
<br>
Then ?Badlands? vowed to push through: with the colossal beat of Max 
Weinberg?s drums and Gary Tallent?s bass, the chime-topped keyboard 
chords of Roy Bittan and Danny Federici, Mr. Clemons?s saxophone, Soozie
 Tyrell?s fiddle and the triple-barreled guitar strumming of Nils 
Lofgren, Steve Van Zandt and Mr. Springsteen. When the band paused, the 
audience sang at top volume: all burdens, all misgivings were cast off 
once again. <br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band will be at the United Center in Chicago on Sunday and Monday.</div>

<br>
Chicago Tribune , <br>
October 22, 2007<br>
By Greg Kot<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen?s work was done for the moment. The first set had 
ended Sunday at the sold-out United Center, the chords of ?Badlands? 
still ringing, and he was waving his appreciation to the audience. But 
he didn?t let go of his guitar, hoisting it above his head as the E 
Street Band gathered around him. <br>
<br>
It was a fitting image for an evening in which Springsteen chopped away 
at his guitar like he was going to war, driving his band through 135 
no-nonsense minutes. It was a terse concert by Springsteen?s epic, 
three-hour-plus standards, but that relative brevity kept the energy 
high and the momentum-sapping shtick low. <br>
<br>
?Is there anybody alive out there?? Springsteen shouted at the outset, 
and turned the show?s first 45 minutes into a rousing wake-up call. He 
buzzed through eight songs nonstop, one feeding into the next with a 
verve that recalled the band?s ferocious heyday, circa 1978. There has 
been a lot of shucking, jiving and mugging on recent E Street tours, but
 this time sidekick Steve Van Zandt was all business and Clarence 
Clemons hung in the shadows in between sax solos. Van Zandt was back in 
his element as Springsteen?s foil as a guitarist and vocalist, and the 
show revolved around their fevered interplay. <br>
<br>
The duo set the tone by slamming down the chords of ?Radio Nowhere,? 
then traded piercing leads on ?Gypsy Biker.? Van Zandt channeled John 
Lee Hooker?s ?Boogie Chillen? on a blues-drenched ?Reason to Believe,? 
Springsteen matching him with an appropriately swampy, fuzzed-out tone 
on harmonica. ?Adam Raised a Cain? raised a few goosebumps, Springsteen 
conjuring a wall of drone with his guitar overtones. <br>
<br>
Max Weinberg was robo-drummer all night, his steely precision matched by
 the cobra-like snap of his wrists on the Bo Diddley syncopation of 
?She?s the One.? A few party rockers helped keep the mood buoyant; the 
best was ?Cadillac Ranch,? with bassist Garry Tallent pumping the rhythm
 oil. The worst was ?Thundercrack,? a rambling frat-rocker that should 
have stayed in the New Jersey bars where Springsteen first played it in 
the early ?70s. <br>
<br>
Mostly, the set list emphasized the band?s most aggressive side, with 
three tracks from the 1978 ?Darkness on the Edge of Town? album, and a 
thundering ?Backstreets? from the 1975 ?Born to Run.? <br>
<br>
The intensity matched the subject matter. Nine of the 23 songs were 
drawn from Springsteen?s latest album, ?Magic,? a series of bleak 
state-of-the-union snapshots from a dissenter?s scrapbook. The only 
awkward moment came in the show?s first hour, when Springsteen paused to
 address the fans at length for the only time. The rushed, mumbled 
monologue about citizens rights and the Constitution briefly broke the 
momentum, and came off as sheepish next to his music. <br>
<br>
Springsteen was better off when he channeled that anger through the 
instrument in his hands. And for most of the night, it gave one heck of a
 speech. <br>
<br>
The set list: <br>
<br>
1. ?Radio Nowhere?: The downstroke of Springsteen?s right hand on his guitar sets the pace for this end-of-the-world rocker. <br>
<br>
2. ?No Surrender?: Springsteen and Van Zandt share the microphone and 
their boyhood memories. ?We learned more from a three-minute record than
 we ever learned in school.? <br>
<br>
3. ?Lonesome Day?: Here?s hoping this one gets weeded out in future concerts; it slows things down here. <br>
<br>
4. ?Gypsy Biker?: Springsteen and Van Zandt at each other?s throats again with their guitars in a foul mood. <br>
<br>
5. ?Magic?: Eerie tune, with a scary message. ?This is not about magic, it?s about tricks,? Springsteen says. <br>
<br>
6. ?Reason to Believe?: Deep blues via John Lee Hooker. <br>
<br>
7. ?Adam Raised a Cain?: The most unhinged Springsteen guitar-playing of the night. <br>
<br>
8. ?She's The One?: Max Weinberg delivers syncopation and swing with titanic force. <br>
<br>
9. ?Livin' In The Future?: Rambling speech undercuts the song?s impact. <br>
<br>
10. ?The Promised Land?: Momentum returns with classic ?Darkness?-era track. <br>
<br>
11. ?Your Own Worst Enemy?: Lovely keyboards and violin embroider the melody. <br>
<br>
12. ?Backstreets?: Staggering, as usual. <br>
<br>
13. ?Cadillac Ranch?: Everybody?s got a big ?ol stupid grin on their face for this one, and why not? Garage-rock perfection. <br>
<br>
14. ?Devil?s Arcade?: Soozie Tyrell?s violin embellishes the haunted atmosphere <br>
<br>
15. ?The Rising?: The most orchestrated song of the night, and somewhat ponderous because of it. <br>
<br>
16. ?Last to Die?: Brisk, biting protest rock. <br>
<br>
17. ?Long Walk Home?: Emotions, guitars build to a combustive finish. <br>
<br>
18. ?Badlands?: A concert peak, with the crowd singing backing harmonies long after the band leaves the stage. <br>
<br>
Encore <br>
<br>
19. ?Girls in Their Summer Clothes?: The E Street Band momentarily 
morphs into the Drifters for a song that?s not quite as sunny as it 
sounds. <br>
<br>
20. ?Thundercrack?: A blueprint for ?Rosalita,? but not nearly as good. <br>
<br>
21. ?Born to Run?: Obligatory, but the E Streeters knock it out of the park. <br>
<br>
22. ?Dancing in the Dark?: Weinberg lays down a relentless beat, and Springsteen pogos. <br>
<br>
23. ?American Land?: A Pete Seeger homage, with the E Streeters playing an accordion-inflected jig</div>

<br>
The New Jersey bard and the E Street Band embrace their coming of age in a rousing show at the L.A. Sports Arena.</strong><br>
<br>
Los Angeles Times , <br>
October 31, 2007<br>
By Randy Lewis<br>
<br>
THE moment the lights went down Monday night at the L.A. Sports Arena 
for Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band's return to a Southland 
concert stage, a vintage-looking calliope surfaced from beneath that 
stage playing not just any vintage-sounding midway number but "That 
Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze." <br>
<br>
At 58, Springsteen certainly can't call himself young anymore -- at 
least not chronologically. Despite the hurricane force he and the E 
Street Band frequently mustered during their two-hour show, plenty of 
fans cheering them on no doubt could recall the nights of yore when this
 fabled group was just starting to break a sweat at the two-hour mark. <br>
<br>
ADVERTISEMENT <br>
Still, what this outfit does on stage each night remains fairly daring, 
and the older they get, the greater the risk of the without-a-net 
abandon with which they administer the sacrament of rock 'n' roll. <br>
<br>
The invigorating thing about the New Jersey bard is the way he and his 
merry band embrace their second coming of age. For all the kudos 
Springsteen's new "Magic" album is earning for the joyful rocking it 
delivers, it's rife with self-doubt, disillusionment, anger and 
acceptance of the disappointments and compromises life inevitably 
presents the thinking person. <br>
<br>
"I'm trying to find my way home," Springsteen sang as he opened the show
 with his latest single, "Radio Nowhere," a song that taps into the 
classic-rock musical lexicon of Blue Oyster Cult's "Don't Fear the 
Reaper" as well as Tommy Tutone's "867-5309/Jenny." <br>
<br>
Over the course of the night it became more apparent that the search 
he's on -- and he's intent on bringing those who will listen with him --
 is for the core values he had the luxury of taking for granted once 
upon a time, in less-conflicted days. <br>
<br>
Springsteen is too observant to look back with simple nostalgia on the 
glory days of a different era. He knows the difference is the result of 
individual experience and growth, not the societal or political changes 
around him, though he had some choice, well-publicized words on that 
front too. But by following "Radio Nowhere" with "No Surrender," he put 
the youthful purity of that 23-year-old song into high relief against 
the portrait of alienation of a man closing in on 60. <br>
<br>
"Girls in Their Summer Clothes," a pop confection crafted on the 
Spector-Shirelles-Brian Wilson blueprint, could be sung by anyone half 
Springsteen's age, but it would lose the melancholy of his recognition 
that those girls, and time, are passing him by. He's no longera 
participant in that momentof life but an observer lookingin. <br>
<br>
Throughout the show it was less about individual performances than the 
context in which Springsteen places his new and old songs. "Girls" came 
between "Badlands" and the very early "Thundercrack," a celebration of 
raging hormones that's now virtually a distant memory for him and his 
peers. <br>
<br>
Much of his music in recent years has wrestled with the dilemma of 
reconciling reality against youthful fantasy of how the world ought to 
be. And with real-world examples of fading ideals and loss of faith all 
too easy to spot, it's a dilemma with no quick fix. <br>
<br>
"We've seen things happening that shouldn't be happening," he said as he
 introduced another of the "Magic" songs, "Living in the Future." 
"Tonight we're going to do something about it. We're going to sing about
 it. That's what we do because we're musicians. But it's a start." <br>
<br>
That start clearly is a source of liberation for the members of the 
mighty E Street Band, especially in light of the treatment they were 
afforded on "Magic" by producer Brendan O'Brien. This band has a sound 
that's bigger than a Cadillac, but O'Brien has compressed it into a 
sonic Subaru on much of the album. The aural space the band got live 
brought back the grandeur of the E Street sound. <br>
<br>
Clarence Clemons bade most of his stage time tapping tambourines or 
valiantly rattling maracas between infrequent sax solos, most of which 
allowed him only to re-create for the umpteenth time a classic riff from
 a long-ago recording session. Guitarists Steve Van Zandt and Nils 
Lofgren got considerably more opportunity to enter into the musical 
dialogue with their Boss, spinning out searing solos that elevated the 
dialogue ever higher. <br>
<br>
As if to tease those who bypassed his "Seeger Sessions" album and tour 
because it jettisoned the E Street Band to explore old folk songs rather
 than new Springsteen tunes, he closed with the E Streeters' take on 
that sound for the final number, "American Land," which toasts this 
nation's defining immigrant history and quickly scolds those who would 
mon- key with the melting-pot tradition. <br>
<br>
The phalanx of electric guitars, swirling keyboards and pounding piano 
gave way to dual accordions, acoustic guitars, mandolin and Clemons 
wrapping his meaty fingers around a tiny tin whistle for the 
Irish-rooted tune. It was Dylan's electric revolution in reverse, 
Springsteen restating the power of folk music after an evening of 
plugged-in mayhem. <br>
<br>
The kind of thing you might expect from a daring young man.</div>

<br>
Can the Boss still rock? <br>
<br>
Yes, we know that Bruce Springsteen has morphed with age from the poet 
of rock 'n' roll to an increasingly acoustic troubadour. So, is his 
heart still in the unique blend of eloquent RB and working-class anthems
 that brought him stardom three decades ago? <br>
<br>
Well, judging from Friday night's St. Paul stop with his beloved E 
Street Band ... it's hard to tell. Springsteen still puts a lot of 
energy into a show, but his passion seems to now lie in the ballads of 
recent vintage. <br>
<br>
Not until late in the show did he seem excited about his old material 
again, providing a satisfying ending to a show that at times sagged a 
bit under the weight of nostalgia. <br>
<br>
There was a time when Springsteen and his bandmates seemed to enjoy 
pouring every ounce of musicianship they had into his songs. <br>
<br>
But "the Boss" isn't quite the collaborator he once was, the one who 
helped build complex and intricate arrangements that played to his 
musicians' strengths. <br>
<br>
He instead favors a simpler, stripped-down sound that leans more upon 
comfort and familiarity than urgency and the element of surprise. <br>
<br>
That said, there were moments at the sold-out Xcel Energy Center on 
Friday when the 58-year-old Springsteen seemed as intensely urgent as 
the one who played the St. Paul Civic Center on the same site in the 
late '70s. <br>
<br>
After a string of rockers of recent years (dropping in 1984's "No 
Surrender"), he seemed to hit his stride on the haunting, hypnotic title
 track of his latest album, "Magic," the unapologetically political 
songsmith's dark reaction to the current powers that be. <br>
<br>
Following it was one of the evening's most memorable moments, a John Lee
 Hooker blues vamp that turned into 1982's "Reason to Believe" 
reimagined as harmonica-fueled nightmare. <br>
<br>
But a pair from "Born to Run" - "Night" and "She's the One" - came off 
as pale shadows of their '70s selves, as did an ambling, uninspired 
reading of "The Promised Land." <br>
<br>
However, he still found some passion in his old material, as evidenced by a gripping rendition of "Incident on 57th Street." <br>
<br>
In some respects, the old Boss didn't really emerge until a five-song encore. <br>
<br>
He showed hints of the master of stage banter who feeds off the energy 
of both his musicians and fans, delivering a surge of welcome adrenaline
 to "Thunder Road" and "Born to Run." <br>
<br>
And the crowd of over 19,000 roared its approval, many of them packed tightly onto a standing-room-only main floor. <br>
<br>
It's still early in this tour, so perhaps more of the old camaraderie 
and collaborative spirit between Boss and Band will have returned when 
they hit the Xcel Energy Center again on March 16, a show announced at 
concert's end. <br>
<br>
Tickets will go on sale next Saturday.</div>

<br>
Detroit News , <br>
November 6, 2007<br>
By Susan Whitall<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen brought his seemingly recession-proof "Magic" tour to 
The Palace of Auburn Hills on Monday, performing to a near-sellout 
crowd. Put it this way: The scattered empty seats were so high up in the
 nosebleed section your ears would pop. <br>
<br>
Southeastern Michigan might be staggering from waves of layoffs and 
mortgage meltdowns, but Springsteen is one future that you don't sell 
short. <br>
<br>
"Is anyone alive out there?" he yelled out as a greeting, and he and the
 E Street Band hit the ground running, performing as intensely on the 
first song, "Radio Nowhere," as they did heading for the encores (which 
included "Born to Run," and "Dancing in the Dark." <br>
<br>
The set list was heavy on songs from his new album, "Magic," including 
the title song, which Springsteen said "isn't really about magic, it's 
about tricks ... lies spun into truth, and truth into lies." <br>
<br>
He introduced "Living in the Future" with a rant about illegal 
wiretapping, "no habeas corpus" and other practices he termed an 
"assault on the Constitution, and therefore an assault on us as 
Americans." <br>
<br>
"The E Street Band is here to do something about it. We'll sing about it," Springsteen roared. <br>
<br>
And he did, with the E Streeters providing the party in a box behind 
him. Some may pine for Springsteen's solo days when he isn't locked into
 his Boss persona, when the lyrics aren't sometimes lost in the frenzy 
onstage (at one point there are five guitars being played at once), but 
there are few bands that can inspire simple joy in an audience just by 
pounding out two-plus hours of solid rock and roll. <br>
<br>
It's a feeling that harkens back to the no-holds-barred rock of 
Springsteen's childhood, when every song Gary U.S. Bonds did sounded 
like a lie-on-your-back rave-up. <br>
<br>
When Steven Van Zandt chopped out a relentless boogie beat on "Reason," 
right out of Canned Heat's "Up the Country," the crowd melted, and Max 
Weinberg, with his militaristic time-keeping, pounded the life out of 
variation No. 101 of the Bo Diddley beat on "She's the One." <br>
<br>
They motorvated through "Promised Land," and got to "Tunnel of Love" on 
which Patti Scialfa sang one of several keening duets with her husband, 
their faces almost touching, in a moment almost too intimate for a 
20,000-seat arena. <br>
<br>
Springsteen danced around and bopped hands with people in the first few rows, including a boy who looked to be about 4 or 5. <br>
<br>
At one point, he held up a sign that said "RAMROD PLEASE," as a song 
request. "I don't believe it; if that kid was 16 he'd be home asleep," 
Springsteen snorted.</div>

				<div class="content">CONCERT REVIEW: Bruce Springsteen<br>
<br>
Here's why Springsteen is still the ultimate concert<br>
Richmond Times Dispatch ,<br>
November 12, 2007<br>
By Melissa Ruggieri<br>
<br>
The knees might be a little creaky and the shows aren't the epic three 
and four-hour marathons of the '70s, but Bruce Springsteen is still the 
ultimate live act. <br>
<br>
Why? Let us count the ways. <br>
<br>
1. Start with the manic intensity he brings to a song, evidenced Sunday 
night in the perfect show opener, "Radio Nowhere," as his right arm 
ferociously pumped his guitar and his neck veins bulged from singing so 
hard. <br>
<br>
2. Then there's the infectious energy that he and the E Street Band 
project. They really are a cast of characters, a band of brothers (plus 
Springsteen's wife, Patti Scialfa, and violinist Soozie Tyrell) and it's
 impossible for an audience not to be affected by their enthusiasm. <br>
<br>
3. Everything works because of its simplicity. The stage is open on all 
sides with nothing on it but the band and their equipment. Two smallish 
video screens flank the top of the stage. The lights consist of a 
colored ring above the band -- but far more effective were the plain ol'
 houselights when Springsteen ordered them up for the 
still-chill-inducing "Born to Run." <br>
<br>
4. With a canon of 35 years of heartfelt blue collar anthems and 
sociological screeds, Springsteen has plenty of material to pull from. 
And unlike many veteran acts, he intentionally mixes song choices, 
adding or subtracting on a whim sometimes, to give fans (especially the 
dedicated who attend several shows) a varied experience (Sunday night 
saw the tour debut of "Growing Up"). <br>
<br>
5. The guy loves to perform and it shows. <br>
<br>
At Sunday's concert -- the first of a two-night sold-out stand at the 
Verizon Center in D.C. -- a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 20,000-plus, 
screamed themselves hoarse as Springsteen and the E Streeters barreled 
through "No Surrender" and "The Promised Land." <br>
<br>
In his traditional uniform of black jeans and black shirt with the 
sleeves rolled up, Springsteen didn't flail around the stage, dripping 
sweat onto the crowd and skidding on his knees as on tours past. What do
 you want from a guy at 58? <br>
<br>
But he was hardly stationary, as he played to all sides of the arena, 
grinning broadly and baptizing his disciples with water from a bucket he
 used to cool himself. Springsteen followers truly do worship the guy. 
They thrust their fists when he thrusts his, shush when he shushes them 
-- as he did before launching into a blazing harmonica solo to usher in 
"Reason to Believe" -- and sing along with a zeal developed from years 
of practice in the car or in front of a bathroom mirror. <br>
<br>
Though the classics from the '70s and '80s drew the most fervent reactions, fans seemed to relish the new material, too. <br>
<br>
The recently released "Magic" is more than an excuse for Springsteen and
 the band to tour -- it's a consistently strong and accessible album 
that, like most of Springsteen's material, flourished live. <br>
<br>
Nine of the album's 12 songs were scattered throughout the almost 
two-and-a-half hour set, with the squealing solos traded between 
Springsteen and Steven Van Zandt a highlight of "Gypsy Biker." <br>
<br>
Given Springsteen's unabashed political views, it was unlikely that he 
would visit the nation's capital without comment, but he also seemed to 
realize the purpose of his platform at the moment. <br>
<br>
"This is a song about things we never thought would happen here," he 
said, introducing the easy-swinging "Livin' in the Future." As he began 
to recite a list of social injustices, a smattering of boos mixed with 
cheers as he continued, "And the E Street Band is going to do something 
about it, and play music!" <br>
<br>
He also dedicated the new "Devil's Arcade," a somber, moody song delivered like a passionate poem, to Veterans Day. <br>
<br>
It's unlikely that any devotee could be disappointed with a set list 
that ranged from "Tunnel of Love," its '80s sheen roughed up by Nils 
Lofgren's stinging solo, to 1973's "Kitty's Back." <br>
<br>
And though them all, Springsteen's voice sounded as if it had been 
dragged under a truck for miles gritty, grainy and perfectly Bruce.</div>

<br>
A Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert circa 2007 comes with 
an implicit quality guarantee. While it might not say as much on your 
ticket, you know going in that the show will have a particularly high 
base line, given that the group is more or less incapable of proffering a
 poor live performance. Indifference and creative implosions simply 
aren't on the list of possibilities; even on their worst nights, the 
band is at least good. <br>
<br>
Sunday night at Verizon Center was not one of those nights. Instead, 
Springsteen and his longtime band were simply great, performing a 
well-considered set with heightened intensity and a very clear sense of 
purpose. <br>
<br>
The guiding principle of a Springsteen show is to deliver salvation and 
hope through song. Forging bonds is critical, as well -- no audience is 
more important to Springsteen than the one he's currently trying to win 
over -- and so he set out to do just that with the audience here 
immediately. "Is there anybody alive out there?" he wondered. " Is there
 anybody alive out there?" And away he and the E Street Band went with 
"Radio Nowhere," a chugging new single about searching for connections 
in a disconnected world. <br>
<br>
Performing the first of two sold-out nights at the arena, Springsteen 
and his nine-piece band delivered a marvelous 24-song set that included 
some of his greatest hits ("Born to Run," "Dancing in the Dark," 
"Badlands") but was particularly heavy on songs from "Magic," a new 
album whose central figures are isolated, alienated and disillusioned. 
They've been betrayed and deceived, and so there's a riptide of angst 
tugging at those who occupy this wartime Americana. <br>
<br>
Springsteen articulated that in both music and words: The song "Magic," 
he said, is about how "the truth gets twisted into lies, and lies get 
twisted into the truth." In introducing "Livin' in the Future," he 
talked about rendition and wiretapping and a Constitution under 
"attack." "The E Street Band is here tonight to do something about it!" 
he said. "We're going to sing about it. We're musicians. It's a start." <br>
<br>
His moaning harmonica set the tone for "Gypsy Biker," a haunting tale 
about a soldier who comes home in a casket. "Last to Die" was a soaring,
 impassioned antiwar rant. "Devil's Arcade" -- dedicated to Veterans Day
 -- was a moving, meditative lament from a soldier's lover who lost her 
man to the military. <br>
<br>
Their ideas were big, and the sound was bigger. Sometimes too big: With 
the audio mix muddy throughout the arena, instrumental parts stuck 
together and some vocals were swallowed whole. It was a shame, given 
just how tight the band's playing was, from Nils Lofgren's pealing 
guitar leads to Max Weinberg's tempo-pushing drumming, so furious yet so
 steady. <br>
ad_icon <br>
<br>
Still, the message rang clear: All is not well in the promised land of 
America. But all is not lost, either. "At the end of every hard-earned 
day, people find some reason to believe," Springsteen sang as the band 
turned "Reason to Believe," one of his stark "Nebraska" songs, into a 
bluesy stomp. <br>
<br>
Springsteen remains one of the most potent live performers in popular 
music -- largely because he's among the most committed practitioners of 
the form, draining all of his creative energy every time he's onstage. 
(And there is much to drain, as his well runs exceptionally deep, even 
at the age of 58.) He also maintains an unwavering faith in the power of
 rock-and-roll; in turn, his own power is undeniable. Add the E Street 
Band to the calculus, and the result can be exhilarating and explosive, 
whether they're performing Springsteen's trenchant political poetry, his
 brittle working-class anthems or his rich, youthful narratives. <br>
<br>
Sunday's 2-hour 15-minute set touched on all of Springsteen's thematic 
hallmarks, and even reached deep into his catalogue for a pair of songs 
from 1973, back before he'd established himself as one of the most 
gifted and important voices in rock. Among them was the shifty 
blues-jazz of "Kitty's Back," a most welcome and thrilling stylistic 
curveball thrown into a marvelous set that was heavy on muscular rockers
 with overdriven guitars. <br>
<br>
There were songs about love and broken hearts, about refusing to grow 
old ("No Surrender") and the reality of growing even older ("Girls in 
Their Summer Clothes"), and, in "Night" -- an old warhorse that somehow 
still sounds fresh -- about restless, romantic young souls whose world 
is busting at its seams. <br>
<br>
Arguing about whether the concert would have been better served if only 
they'd eschewed such-and-such (off "Magic" in this case) for so-and-so 
(from the "The River," no?) is something like an Olympic sport among 
Springsteen die-hards, and those debates have been raging since the last
 note of the old-time folk finale "American Land" faded inside the arena
 on Sunday. Which just goes to show you how hard Springsteen and the E 
Street Band have it: When you're always good, simply being great might 
not be good enough.</div>

Pittsburgh Tribune-Review , <br>
November 15, 2007<br>
By Regis Behe<br>
To be sure, there were moments of sheer and utter brilliance during 
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band's concert Wednesday at the 
Mellon Arena. <br>
<br>
But more prevalent were the moments of recognition, the merging of the 
performers with the audience, a union of people more alike than not. <br>
<br>
Unlike Mick Jagger, who affects an imperious air, or the strange mystic 
that is now Bob Dylan, Springsteen is the uber everyman. Dressed in 
jeans, a work shirt and boots, he could have been any one of a thousand 
or so guys in the audience Wednesday night. <br>
<br>
But then again, not. From the first chords of the opener, "Radio 
Nowhere," there was a sense of Springsteen as an avatar, a leader who 
offers hope in dark times. Dipping heavily into material from his new 
release, "Magic," he offered a sturdy if unspectacular version of "Gypsy
 Biker" and the summery intoxication of "Girls in Their Summer Clothes."
 <br>
<br>
Best, however, was "Livin' in the Future," and its dark lyrics, notably 
"my ship Liberty sailed away on a bloody horizon" even as he held out 
hope that "none of this has happened yet." Which was followed by the 
redemption of "The Promised Land," the band powerful, propulsive, one of
 those moments when you feel the music coursing through your veins. <br>
<br>
For better or worse, the E Street Band has become a quasi-orchestra, 
with very little room for soloing save a few licks here and there by sax
 player Clarence Clemons or guitarists Nils Lofgren. This approach, for 
the most part, works on songs such as "The Ties That Bind" and "She's 
the One." <br>
<br>
But the evening's best moments were surprises, diverging from the E 
Street formula: A stirring, stark version of "Youngstown" that featured 
just Springsteen and his acoustic guitar. Better still was a shocker, 
the unexpected "Kitty's Back" from 1973's "The Wild, the Innocent and 
the E Street Shuffle," brilliantly understated with organist Danny 
Federici and pianist Roy Bittan given room to shine, the song 
percolating with almost a jazz-like feel until its rousing climax. Which
 was followed by the bombastic glory of "Born to Run" enough to sate 
both the diehards and casual fans.</div>

Albany Times Union , <br>
November 16, 2007<br>
By Casey Seiler<br>
<br>
Is it too late in his career to start thinking about Bruce Springsteen as a great dancer? <br>
<br>
<br>
Not dancer in the boogie-down sense, although he can still pull that 
off. I'm talking in the Martha Graham sense, as in someone who's 
mastered the evocation of mood and meaning through the use of his body. <br>
<br>
At 58, Springsteen isn't throwing himself around like Baryshnikov, but 
the sold-out Times Union Center crowd saw a man who can fill an arena 
stage like few performers half his age. He planted his feet and 
declaimed the lyrics, sculpting the air in front of him and punctuating 
each line. He stalked the catwalk exhorting the crowd to lean in, raise 
their hands, sing along. As if they needed convincing. <br>
<br>
The E Street Band's first Albany appearance in almost five years was 
looser and more wide-ranging than either the 1999 reunion tour or the 
shows that attended "The Rising." This one was pitched a little closer 
to Springsteen's July 2005 solo show behind "Devils and Dust," in which 
the artist pushed his songs in fascinating directions. <br>
<br>
One of the tunes reworked in that show, "Reason to Believe," was the 
clear highlight here: With all hands on deck, this "Nebraska" track 
built from a Howlin' Wolf blues vamp to a roadhouse guitar workout 
worthy of early ZZ Top; Springsteen delivered the last verse through a 
fog of distortion, sounding like the world's oldest man. <br>
<br>
The terrific new album "Magic" was given the showcase it deserves 
without overwhelming the set. The politically significant title track 
was full of coiled menace ("Every night we tell the people it's not 
really about magic," Springsteen said. "It's about tricks"), while 
"Gypsy Biker," "Last to Die" and "Long Walk Home" sounded fuller live. <br>
<br>
The band reached back more than three decades for "4th of July, Asbury 
Park (Sandy)" and a light-fingered, deeply funky take on "The E Street 
Shuffle." "Darkness of the Edge of Town" yielded its title track as well
 as "Candy's Room" (a showcase for drummer Max Weinberg), "Badlands" and
 "The Promised Land." <br>
<br>
The extended encore included "Dancing in the Dark," "Born to Run" and 
more, finally ending with a rousing "American Land" from the Seeger 
Sessions project. <br>
<br>
The band (minus Springsteen's wife, Patti Scialfa) remain firmly in each
 other's pockets. If there was a standout, it was the interplay between 
Steven Van Zandt and Nils Lofgren, who balance out Springsteen's own 
blunt guitar with their own respective talents for raw power and 
delicacy.</div>

<br>
To borrow a title from the artist's own songbook, Bruce Springsteen once
 again proved it all night as he and a reunited E Street Band rocked the
 Bradley Center here before a near capacity crowd Monday. <br>
<br>
There were a few empty patches of seats, mostly behind the sports 
arena's stage, but they were hard to see amid the joyous audience's 
dancing and singing during an aggressive two-and-one-half-hour set. <br>
<br>
Springsteen, 58, and his eight-member black-clad band have slowed a 
little since their earlier days. Some have put on weight, others have 
lost their hair and saxman Clarence Clemons seems to have trouble with 
his legs, walking stiffly and often sitting between solos on a large 
wooden chair. <br>
<br>
But the E Streeters are still inhabited by the edgy energy that 
characterized early performances, along with an only slightly subdued 
joie de vivre The Boss brings to his work. <br>
<br>
Stage patter was minimal as one song flowed into another, creating a 
lengthy list of career-spanning hits. Selections included "It's Hard to 
Be a Saint in the City," drawn from "Greetings from Asbury Park," 
Springsteen's first album released in 1973, to "Radio Nowhere" and 
"Livin' in the Future" from "Magic," recorded last year. <br>
<br>
During the last few decades, Springsteen's career has evolved to include
 folkish numbers, solo acoustic tours, an Academy Award for "Streets of 
Philadelphia," and the Seeger Sessions Band, honoring the influence of 
folk artist Pete Seeger. But the E Street Band sound has remained 
Springsteen's core musical value, and that's where the bulk of Monday's 
concert focused. <br>
<br>
With an 8:30 p.m. start time, Springsteen kicked the show off with "No 
Surrender," an anthem of sorts for the aging rockers. Original drummer 
Max Weinberg kept a loud, aggressive beat with the help of bassist Garry
 Tallent. Pianist Roy Bittan and keyboard player Charles Giordano, 
substituting for an ill Danny Federici, completed the back line. In 
addition to Springsteen and Clemons, the front line included guitarists 
Steve Van Zandt and Nils Lofgren and multi-instrumentalist Soozie 
Tyrell. Singer and Springsteen spouse Patti Scialfa was home with the 
couple's three teenagers, The Boss said. <br>
<br>
"Streets of Fire," an extended "She's the One" and "Promised Land" 
segued into the more soulful "My Home Town," "Devil's Arcade" and "The 
Rising," A hard-rocking "Badlands" closed the initial set. In a rare 
moment of group-wide consciousness, the audience en masse kept repeating
 the song's unarticulated chorus until the band took the stage once 
again. <br>
<br>
During the encore, fans were surprised at the performance by a 
guitar-less Springsteen, Bittan on the grand piano and UW School of 
Music professor Richard Davis on bass. (Davis had recorded with 
Springsteen early in the rocker's career.) The trio performed a version 
of "Meeting Across the River" that was striking in its contrasting 
musical accomplishment. <br>
<br>
The band returned for the seminal "Born to Run," one of the show's 
closers, sliding immediately into another number, seemingly content to 
keep proving it for an even longer night.</div>

Cincinnati Enquirer , <br>
March 23, 2008<br>
By Bill Thompson<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen's latest album is called "Magic" for good reason. He cast a spell over U.S. Bank Arena Saturday night. <br>
<br>
In his first visit since August 2005, Springsteen and the E Street Band 
added seven new songs, but delivered what the near-capacity crowd came 
to hear: an evening of powerhouse rock 'n' roll that had everyone on 
their feet from the opening strains of "Darlington County.'' <br>
<br>
Springsteen's songbook covers 35 years, and many in the audience have 
been there from the start. Friends high-fived each other before singing 
every word of favorites such as "Prove It All Night," "She's the One" 
and "Badlands,'' temporarily transported back to a time when the hair 
was a little fuller and a little darker, and the T-shirts were a few 
sizes smaller. These folks grew up with the Boss, and he's as much a 
part of their lives as the kids who stood next to more than a few 
parents. The young ones might not know all the words to "Promised Land" 
(yet), but they were just as enthusiastic as their fist-pumping elders. <br>
<br>
This is part of Springsteen's magic. He is one of the biggest stars in 
the world, but seems like he could be your pal (if you happen to be 
friends with a virtuoso musician who writes great songs). You can 
empathize with him: his wife, singer-guitarist Patti Scialfa, missed the
 gig because she was home in New Jersey tending to their three teenage 
children. You have to admire the superstar couple that doesn't leave the
 kids with hired hands. <br>
<br>
But speaking of hired hands, longtime fans know that much of 
Springsteen's success comes from the best band in America. The singer 
takes time off for solo and side projects, such as the Seeger Sessions 
album and tour of a couple of years ago, but his heart lives on E 
Street. And why not? What could be more fun than playing music with your
 longtime friends? <br>
<br>
Watch Springsteen trade guitar licks with Miami Steve Van Zandt and Nils
 Lofgren, and see the fantasy of every teenage American boy (or girl, 
too) come true. Keyboard players Roy Bittan and Charlie Giordano 
(filling in for the ailing Danny Federici) add texture to every tune, 
and teamed up for a smokin' accordion duet during the encore of 
"American Land." Max Weinberg might be the best rock drummer ever. And 
as Springsteen says of saxophonist Clarence Clemons: ''You know you want
 to be like him, but you can't.'' <br>
<br>
Springsteen has changed a few things over the years. The show lasted a 
little more than two hours as opposed to the legendary four-hour 
sessions of the early days. At 58, he doesn't slide across the stage on 
his knees or jump up on the piano any more. <br>
<br>
But time seems to have strengthened his resolve to speak out more 
forcefully. He made a couple of comments about the mistakes "of the past
 eight years," referring to the Bush administration. Some of the new 
songs, especially "Last to Die," take direct aim at policies he believes
 to be wrong. <br>
<br>
But in the end, Springsteen isn't a preacher. Nor a magician or a 
politician. He's a songwriter and a performer extraordinaire. Midway 
through Saturday's encore, the band played "Dancin' in the Dark," the 
hit single from "Born in the USA." In 1984, the song coincided with the 
rise of MTV, and Springsteen made an awkward video where he pulled a 
girl (a pre-"Friends" Courteney Cox) from the audience to dance with 
him. Flash forward almost 24 years, but this time he invited a 
delightful youngster who could actually dance onto the stage, and the 
two of them proceeded to charm everyone in the building. <br>
<br>
It was just the way one of your friends might do it.</div>
