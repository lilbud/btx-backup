Concert review:<br>
 Bruce Springsteen, workin' for a livin' while defying age<br>
 by David Menconi <br>
 April 25, 2014</strong><br>
<br>
RALEIGH — Thursday night, late in his encore at PNC Arena, Bruce 
Springsteen stripped down to a T-shirt and shucked his guitar, surveying
 the house as the crowd roared. He bobbed and weaved like a boxer about 
to enter the ring. Yet another marathon performance was under his belt, 
and he still looked fit enough to jog to the next city on his tour.<br>
<br>
Springsteen will turn 65 in September, retirement age for most people, 
and you figure he’s got to slow down at some point. But he showed no 
signs of doing so anytime soon, running through 26 songs in just under 
three hours.<br>
<br>
The E Street Band, Springsteen’s long-time backup ensemble, has gone 
through plenty of phases and stages over the past 40 years, including 
the deaths of two members since 2008. The current incarnation that 
Springsteen presides over is a rock ’n’ roll orchestra, 18 pieces 
strong, capable of an impressive wall of sound when they hit it at full 
blare.<br>
<br>
One of the band’s most dramatic changes of recent years has been the 
addition of Tom Morello, guitarist in Rage Against the Machine, who 
brings an intriguing new dimension to the arrangements. Morello added a 
healthy dose of jagged-edge skronk to the opening number “High Hopes,” 
and he turned “The Ghost of Tom Joad” -- a song Springsteen originally 
recorded as a quietly reflective ballad in the mid-1990s -- into a 
sprawling guitar faceoff.<br>
<br>
Still, if you want to talk E Street Band drama, it all comes down to 
saxophonist Clarence Clemons, the late great Big Man, who died in 2011 
and still casts a long shadow over his former bandmates. During the “Big
 Man has joined the band” line of “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,” there was a
 video-screen tribute to both Clemons and keyboardist Danny Federici 
(who died in 2008), a gesture that was both moving and classy.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Clarence’s nephew Jake Clemons has developed into a 
more-than-capable stand-in for his uncle, playing his solos in a style 
that honors the original parts without being too slavish about the 
details. He has also stepped into his uncle’s role as Springsteen’s 
physical foil, joining him at the center-stage microphone more than 
once.<br>
<br>
Thursday’s show also served as a matriculation party for Springsteen’s 
daughter Jessica, who he announced is graduating from Duke University. 
Dad brought his daughter onstage to dance as Jake Clemons played the 
saxophone solo of “Dancing in the Dark,” which was a very sweet touch.<br>
<br>
But the party wasn’t limited to immediate family. The stage setup 
included a catwalk that bisected the PNC Arena floor, and Springsteen 
spent a lot of time out in the crowd letting people maul him (and his 
guitar) and take pictures that are no doubt already all over social 
media. He brought up a few of his daughter’s friends to sing during 
“Growin’ Up,” and two very cute little girls for “Waitin’ on a Sunny 
Day.”<br>
<br>
The crowd played its part with the customary unbridled adoration, 
including song requests via poster-board signs. Springsteen obliged the 
audience requests with “Brilliant Disguise,” “I’m on Fire” and a cover 
of Manfred Mann’s 1960s-vintage hit “Pretty Flamingo” (to the delight of
 his backup-singer wife Patti Scialfa).<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, the best moments were the songs you knew he’d play, the 
ones you’d feel cheated if he left them out. Going on 40 years later, 
“Born to Run” is still among the most amazing songs in the arena-rock 
canon, a delirious audience sing-along that was as powerful as always. 
Same for “Badlands,” “The Promised Land” and “Thunder Road.”<br>
<br>
On a more fun and less epic note, the encore cover of the Isley Brothers
 party standard “Shout” gave Springsteen the perfect venue for making 
the standard spiel he gives at the end of every show:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">You’ve just seen…The heart-stopping, 
pants-dropping, house-rocking, earth-quaking, booty-shaking, 
Viagra-taking, love-making…le-gen-dary…E! Street! Band!</em><br>
<br>
Long may they wail.</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Double Shot<br>
Darkness Tour<br>
Notre Dame University, IN<br>
September 9, 1978<br>
</span><br>
One of my friends in college had purchased a block of tickets for the 
show during the summer. When we arrived on campus, he began trying to 
sell them. I wasn’t all that familiar with Springsteen at the time 
despite Born to Run. I remembered the Time Magazine article about him 
being the new Dylan who I was not a big fan of at the time. My friend 
basically made me an offer I couldn’t refuse. He offered to give me the 
ticket and if I didn’t think the show was great I wouldn’t owe him 
anything. It was a Saturday night. Notre Dame was the defending National
 Champs and had lost to Missouri that afternoon in a shocking upset. 
Only about 3000 people showed up for the concert (the ACC held about 
11,000.) A group of eight of us went to the concert. The show opened and
 I was blown away. The amount of energy Springsteen put forward was 
incredible. Jumping up on the piano. Playing off the Big Man and Miami 
Steve, the energy was amazing. I passed over the price of the ticket 
during his cover of We Got to Get Out of This Place. He singled out two 
guys in the front row that had been following him all summer. He 
launched into a song “that this is the only place in the known Universe 
we have ever played it” It was Double Shot of My Baby’s Love. The song 
broke down during the intro. He just laughed and they started over. The 
crowd was singing the choruses at the end. He then launched into Louie, 
Louie, after hearing a request from the audience. “Don’t tempt me!” 
before deciding to play the song. Candy’s Room was a song that really 
stood out for me at the time as did Adam Raised a Cain. I was taken back
 by his stories and the acting that went with them. He told a song about
 a gypsy woman who appeared before them and transformed them into their 
various personas. For Bruce, nothing happened. “I was still a bum!” I 
think he introduced For You with that song. After three plus hours of 
playing and an intermission, the concert ended with endless encores. The
 lights went up and we waited but reluctantly headed for the exits. We 
were almost out of the ACC when we heard a roar and headed running back 
to our seats. With the house lights on, the band came out and played 
Twist and Shout with the crowd handling the harmonies. A food fight 
broke out with the roadies. It was the most incredible concert 
experience I had or would ever have. On that Monday, I headed to the 
bookstore to buy the four albums that we’re out at the time. I was a 
complete convert. Two weeks later,Yes came to the ACC and I remember how
 bored we were with the entire concert. Springsteen returned in 1981 to 
Notre Dame and sold out the venue. Before, he played Double Shot he told
 the audience this is the only place in the known universe we play this 
song. From different areas of the arena came cries of Double Shot!</div>

Concert review: Bruce Springsteen digs deep at Atlanta show <br>
By Melissa Ruggieri<br>
Atlanta Jounal</strong><br>
<br>
There are two types of Bruce Springsteen shows: The ones that offer a 
bounty of the blue collar anthems that will never, ever rust despite 
their age (the “Jungleland”s and “Thunder Road”s). And the ones that 
detour into the creases of his remarkable catalog, happily surprising 
the legions of die-hards but sending casual fans home with a 
disappointed shrug because he didn’t play “Jungleland” or “Thunder 
Road.”<br>
Saturday night’s two hour and 45-minute romp at Aaron’s Amphitheatre at 
Lakewood should have appeased both camps. The first 90 minutes 
zig-zagged from the punky burst of The Clash’s “Clampdown” – with the E 
Street Band brass section ingeniously recast as a drumline – to a trio 
of memories from “The River,” including Springsteen’s solo spin behind 
Roy Bittan’s white baby grand for the pensive “Independence Day.”<br>
Springsteen, a black-clad musical Jedi sporting flexible wrist braces 
and a rocker scruff (has he been hanging around fill-in guitarist Tom 
Morello too much?), didn’t travel from behind his mic stand much at 
first. But he did stroll in tandem with the top-hatted Nils Lofgren for 
“The Ties That Bind” and stepped aside to allow Jake  Clemons some space
 as he blasted his first solo of the night, much to the approval of the 
whooping crowd.<br>
Those E Streeters – and newly minted Rock and Roll Hall of Famers – are a
 small convention of musicians and, as always, they balanced 
Springsteen’s emotion and passion with a steady snap (drummer Max 
Weinberg) and melodies that veered from pretty shuffles (“She’s the 
One”) to sticky stomps (“Adam Raised a Cain”).<br>
The addition of Morello, the Rage Against the Machine guitarist (and 
Springsteen pal) replacing Steven Van Zandt while he fulfills his acting
 duties, is an interesting one. Morello’s spiky guitar adds a 
metal-edged, squawky dimension to songs that doesn’t always sound 
natural in E Street land and his showboating on “High Hopes” (playing 
with his teeth) and “The Ghost of Tom Joad” (scratching at his guitar 
like it was a turntable), while exciting in a live setting, seemed 
misplaced against the band’s cool charisma.<br>
That isn’t to say that Morello isn’t a guitar wizard. He’s a tremendous player, but Van Zandt was missed.<br>
Springsteen didn’t neglect his tradition of scouring the audience – 
primarily the general admission pit in his sightline – for sign requests
 and scored a beauty with one that read, “Help! A NY-er Trapped in GA.” 
With a nod and a grin, Springsteen obliged with a cover of Jimmy Cliff’s
 “Trapped,” and led the nearly sold-out crowd in the song’s air-punching
 chorus.<br>
An early sing-along accompanied the easy-swinging “Cadillac Ranch,” but 
it wasn’t until the band kicked into “Badlands” – with the umpteenth, 
yet always welcome, Springsteen count in of “ah-one, two, three, fah” – 
that a subtle shift occurred and those casual fans suddenly put down 
their beers and popped out of their seats again.<br>
Even those who didn’t know “Drive All Night” (back to “The River” we 
go!) had to feel their insides tighten a little as Springsteen clenched 
his eyes and ripped the heart out of the tortured love song.<br>
But seconds later, the houselights flipped up and the “whoa-oh-oh-oh”s 
of “Born to Run” filled the venue, again marking itself as a pinnacle of
 any live concert experience.<br>
The crew hustled through “Dancing in the Dark,” that anthem of 
middle-aged discontentment wrapped in a jaunty melody, but not before 
Springsteen scooped up a young girl from the crowd and hoisted her on 
his shoulders, the two of them sharing rhythm and song as he crouched 
down to allow her to sing.<br>
While this wasn’t Springsteen’s most physical show – his shirt didn’t 
even appear sweat-soaked until halfway through the set, which is beyond 
an anomaly – he is still the hardest-working cat out there (and at 64, 
no less).<br>
But it was a blissful sight when he stripped down to a bicep-baring 
T-shirt, climbed atop the piano, then hopped down and glided into some 
boxing jabs as the smooth intro to “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” unfurled.<br>
This was Springsteen’s chance to mingle in the crowd – and he did – and 
also the time to memorialize Clarence Clemons (“and the Big Man joined 
the band”) and keyboardist Danny Federici on video during the song. The 
heart-wrenching musical time out that Springsteen employed during the 
2012 tour following Clemons’ death has been eliminated, but the tribute 
is no less significant.<br>
Wrapping the night with “Shout” and a suitably crunchy cover of AC/DC’s 
“Highway to Hell,” Springsteen might have disappointed a few fans hoping
 to hear a greater number of familiar songs.<br>
But with an inventory as vast as his – and at this point in a career 
that might not always include two-year tours – it’s advised to 
appreciate every moment.</div>

By PHIL KLOER<br>
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution<br>
June 15, 2009</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen turns 60 in September. That is a fact. So what 
happened Sunday night at Philips Arena had to be some sort of consensual
 hallucination, because there is no way a guy that age can put out that 
level of energy for nearly three hours.<br>
Surrounded by full-throated fans his own age (a 40-year-old was a mere 
pup at Philips on Sunday), Springsteen fed off of their rowdy adulation,
 delivering a show that proves boomer-oriented rock 'n' roll can still 
tear it up.<br>
Springsteen and his E Street Band are ostensibly touring to support his 
new album, "Working on a Dream," but his set lists haven't been 
overcrowded with the new songs (some of which have elicited shrugs, even
 from fans). Instead, this seems to unofficially be the Havin' A Blast 
Tour, with surprise cover tunes, unexpected deep cuts and a sense of 
youthful enthusiasm.<br>
One of many highlights was the Stump the Band segment, in which fans 
bring big signs printed with the names of songs the E Street Band has 
rarely, if ever, played in concert. Springsteen chose "96 Tears," the 
garage-rock classic by ? and the Mysterians. "You think the greatest bar
 band in the land doesn't know '96 Tears'?" he teased. They did, in a 
loose way, although Springsteen didn't try to hide that he was reading 
the lyrics off a stage-level TelePrompTer.<br>
Other fan signs requested songs that aren't part of the tour's set list,
 which led to a rare and stunning "Jungleland" on Sunday. Fans stood, 
but not to dance; it was more like rising for the national anthem. You 
can tell how deeply the hard-core Springsteen fans are moved or 
impressed by the volume of "Bruuuuuce!" at any point in a show, and 
"Jungleland" got the Bruuuce-iest response of any song.<br>
Always a relaxed natural with his crowds, Springsteen goofed by handing 
his mike over to kids in the audience to sing along on "Waitin' for a 
Sunny Day," and even let them play his guitar on "Born to Run," the 
evening's closer (before the five-song finale).<br>
Other notes:<br>
• Springsteen's wife and band member Patti Scialfa missed the Philips 
show (and several others) after falling off a horse Wednesday; she's OK,
 just out of action. He dedicated "Kingdom of Days" to her.<br>
• Drummer Max Weinberg's son Jake sat in for a few songs, very 
forcefully, and helped raise the rock quotient of "Radio Nowhere" 
considerably.<br>
Finally, the Boss just flat out looks great: pumped, toned, all in 
black. Some of the guys in the band look their age; maybe bringing in 
young Jake is a step toward an ageless Springsteen fronting the Sons of 
the E Street Band.</div>

According to Fréttablaðið, the singer and songwriter’s private jet

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">ALBUM REVIEW: Springsteen’s fascinating and revelatory ‘Promise’<br>
2010 November 15<br>
by Pete Chianca<br>
The Lincoln Journal</strong><br>
<br>
Well, with “The Promise,” it’s official: If you want a sanctioned 
release of raw, unexpurgated Bruce Springsteen outtakes and alternate 
versions, you’ll have to pry it from his cold, dead hands. Unlike Billy 
Joel, who can be heard yelling out chord changes on his “My Lives” set, 
or even Bob Dylan, whose unfinished “She’s Your Lover Now” is a 
highlight of his “Bootleg Series Vol. 1,” Springsteen is far too much of
 a perfectionist for such antics.<br>
“The Promise,” available as a 2-CD or 3-LP set or as part of a mammoth 
boxed set of CDs and videos, is being billed as the lost tracks from the
 sessions for Springsteen’s 1978 masterpiece, “Darkness on the Edge of 
Town.” But what it really contains is a re-imagining of those unfinished
 and discarded songs, filtered through decades of time and experience, 
and completed — in some cases with newly recorded vocals — in a way that
 reflects both Springsteen’s original vision and where he’s come since.<br>
If that sounds like cheating to you, you’re probably the type of 
Springsteen fan who already has some of these songs on original vinyl 
bootlegs you bought off the back of a truck in the early ’80s. You may 
want to stick with those. For the rest of us, “The Promise” is a welcome
 addition to the Springsteen canon, always riveting and, at times, 
revelatory.<br>
Maybe it’s because we’re so familiar with the bleak classics that make 
up “Darkness,” but it’s the earlier versions of those songs that are 
actually the album’s weak spot. A “rock” version of “Racing in the 
Street” lacks the final version’s tragic majesty, and compared to the 
breakneck assault of “Candy’s Room,” “Candy’s Boy” is positively sleepy.
 The exception is “Come On (Let’s Go Tonight),” which is not as lean and
 striking as the song it would become, “Factory,” but shares that 
track’s sense of desperate resignation.<br>
Other songs we may already know from other artists’ versions, like 
“Fire,” “Because the Night” and “Rendezvous,” also seem like steps 
backward in comparison to Springsteen’s subsequent live versions. But 
it’s the “new” material that really makes this collection, a good 15 
songs that perfectly capture the artist’s influences and offer a telling
 glimpse at his creative process.<br>
Part of the enjoyment involves spotting the bits and pieces that 
eventually made their way into other songs (hey, “Spanish Eyes” has the 
opening verse of “I’m On Fire”!). But all of these tracks hold their own
 individual pleasures. “Gotta Get That Feeling” is a nostalgic 
girl-group romp that couldn’t have sounded more out of place in the 
disco era, and on “Ain’t Good Enough For You,” whose melody would 
eventually find its way into “This Little Girl” for Gary U.S. Bonds, 
Springsteen is at his most playful, even as he sings about a doomed 
relationship — he could be the narrator of “I’m Goin’ Down” before he’s 
completely given up.<br>
Song after song is fascinating, first in style — besides ’60s soul, 
there’s the Orbison-esque pop that Springsteen would return to on last 
year’s “Working on a Dream,” and even Latin influences, like on the 
mariachi-tinged “The Brokenhearted.” But they also resonate lyrically, 
with songs like “Outside Looking In” and “Wrong Side of the Street” 
reflecting the sense of isolation that would eventually envelop the 
final version of “Darkness.”<br>
That said, it’s striking how unlike the rest of “Darkness” most of these
 tracks are, often light and jaunty where that album is bleak and 
driving — “Talk To Me,” eventually recorded almost identically by 
Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes (whose debt to Springsteen’s 
late-’70s style was never more apparent) is downright house-party 
energetic.<br>
The exception of course is the title track, “The Promise,” a tale of 
dead ends and broken dreams that some say reflected Springsteen’s 
frustration with the legal battle that kept him out of the studio after 
his breakthrough “Born to Run,” or with the shallow nature of fame 
itself, or both. A sparse 1999 version sounded like a lament, but this 
recording, with full orchestration, would have fit in perfectly with the
 album’s sound, not to mention its theme of acquiescence giving way to 
indignation.<br>
As for Springsteen’s tinkering with the original tracks, it doesn’t feel
 like an attempt to put one over on us; instead, it informs these songs 
with both the influences of his past and the knowledge and context of 
his present work. The result on a song like “Save My Love,” recorded in 
its entirety this year, is a stirring addition to Springsteen’s 
catalogue that fits perfectly with his most recent output even as it 
reflects his songwriting of decades past.<br>
<br>
I’d argue that the one thing “The Promise” does best, though, is justify
 Springsteen’s judgment. These are a terrific batch of songs, and 
thrilling in the context of his career as a whole — but they don’t 
necessarily make up the Great Lost Springsteen Album that some people 
(including Columbia’s marketing department) may want it to be.<br>
Had this collection been released, say, in 1977 as the follow-up to 
“Born to Run,” it would have made a fine album, but without the stark 
focus that eventually provided the backbone for “Darkness on the Edge of
 Town.” “The Promise” shows that Springsteen made the right choices — 
and that “Darkness” was worth waiting for.</div>

<br>
Slane Castle in 1985 was the first time Bruce Springsteen played to 
100,000 people. In 1999 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of 
Fame by Bono. When he toured The Seeger Sessions album he chose The 
Point Depot in Dublin as the venue for the live DVD.<br>
<br>
Clearly he has a special connection with Ireland, as we saw again this 
week at his concerts in the RDS. And fans still on a high after the 
music who want to delve deep into his life's work will find much to 
study in this book.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is probably the distillation of all that is best about 
American music rolled into one great artist, and in this book Marc Dolan
 goes into immense detail to prove it.<br>
<br>
Dolan is a professor of English at City University New York and it 
shows. This is not a showbiz biography but a serious book which analyses
 Springsteen entirely through his work.<br>
<br>
The book opens with a short history of rock rather than an overview of 
Springsteen's life. We skip quickly through his family and childhood, 
moving on instead to Springsteen's greater music family, that of the 
bands playing the Jersey shore area.<br>
<br>
The detail that Dolan has gathered about early rehearsals and bar gigs 
with his early garage and pub bands is astonishing. He maps out who 
played what instrument in which band and at what gig.<br>
<br>
In the early chapters of the book, Springsteen is one of a number of 
characters (including Steve Van Zandt) playing the Asbury Park music 
scene and in particular the now infamous 'Upstage Club' where 
Springsteen and his contemporaries convened late after their paying gigs
 to jam together late into the night.<br>
<br>
If ever a 'music scene' existed then this sounds like the kind every 
musician dreams of. Springsteen went on to draw from this pool of talent
 for his various studio and live bands.<br>
<br>
From the earliest demos and live recordings, even down to studying old 
set lists, Dolan has deciphered the evolution of Springsteen's music and
 lyrics and all the possible influences that might have shaped it.<br>
<br>
While Dolan barely covers the break-up of the marriage to actress 
Julianne Philips, he does provide great analysis of the songs it gave 
rise to on the Tunnel of Love album such as 'Brilliant Disguise'.<br>
<br>
He describes Springsteen's unusual route to Columbia Records (CBS) via a
 complicated deal with the production company 'Pocket Full of Tunes' and
 the subsequent lawsuit with his possessive manager Mike Appel (who once
 wrote songs for The Partridge Family!).<br>
<br>
But every story centres on Springsteen's musical life. Album by album, tour by tour, this is the pattern throughout the book.<br>
<br>
The painstaking months it took to finish the Born To Run album make for 
great reading. Springsteen recorded the title track long before the 
album itself, but due to waning support from his record label they 
wouldn't release it until he had the album finished.<br>
<br>
In the interim, his manager, Mike Appel, released cassettes of the song 
to radio stations and accidentally created a massive teaser campaign. 
Listeners loved the song, fans coming to the concerts knew the song, but
 ironically no one could buy it.<br>
<br>
Halfway through recording the album Springsteen brought a rock 
journalist friend of his, Jon Landau, into the studio to help him finish
 the record. But Springsteen just couldn't sign off on the album doing 
mix after endless remix. It was Landau who convinced Springsteen that 
the album was complete.<br>
<br>
When the album was finally released it sold more copies than his 
previous two albums combined, changing Springsteen's status from artist 
to superstar.<br>
<br>
In 1982, after giving the E Street Band six months off, Springsteen got 
them into the studio to jam the new songs he had been working on. One of
 them, a song called ' Vietnam', was transformed by the band into the 
track we now know as 'Born In The USA'.<br>
<br>
Others, the ones he had worked hardest on, didn't sound so great with 
the band. So, Springsteen compiled the acoustic demos into a collection 
and with a couple of new recordings thrown in called it Nebraska and 
released it as a solo album, selling over a million copies without even a
 promotional tour.<br>
<br>
Then he went back to finish the band album. In 1983, when it was nearing
 completion, his manager/ producer Landau suggested that the album 
needed a big hit single. So Bruce went off and wrote 'Dancing In The 
Dark'.<br>
<br>
Within a month of its release, Born In The USA went platinum. It gave 
rise to seven hit singles and a two-year tour playing to over a million 
and a half people. Inspiring stuff indeed.</div>
