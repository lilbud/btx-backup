<br>
Tampa Tribune , <br>
November 25, 2002<br>
By Curtis Ross<br>
<br>
The power of Bruce Springsteen's album ``The Rising'' was brought home 
Sunday night to a crowd of 19,644 at the St. Pete Times Forum. 
Springsteen and the E Street Band began the show with the album's title 
track, its circular keyboard riff glinting like a ray of sun through the
 clouds. Guitarist Steven Van Zandt joined Springsteen for some 
heart-swelling harmonies. ``Lonesome Day'' was pushed to a new level by 
Max Weinberg's drums. They don't call him ``Mighty Max'' just for the 
alliteration. Later in the show, ``Mary's Place'' revealed its roots in 
Memphis soul. Springsteen's performance suggested the song could have 
been a lost Eddie Floyd number.<br>
<br>
Springsteen set older numbers such as ``The Ties That Bind'' and 
``Night'' side-by-side with his newer songs, showing the material is of a
 piece. Bruce went as far back as his first album, 1973's ``Greetings 
From Asbury Park, N.J.,'' playing such little-heard gems as ``It's Hard 
to Be a Saint in the City'' and ``Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?'' 
One of the show's highlights was a solo piano version of ``Incident 
on57th Street.'' The passionate performance showed Springsteen hasn't 
lost touch with the ``Spanish Johnnys'' and ``Puerto Rican Janes'' of 
his early songs.<br>
<br>
Springsteen asked for quiet, and almost got it, before singing two of 
the saddest songs from ``The Rising'': ``Empty Sky'' and ``You're 
Missing.'' Patti Scialfa added ghostly harmonies on the former, and the 
emotional intensity Springsteen brought to both numbers was almost 
unbearable. Springsteen eased some of the tension with ``Waitin' on a 
Sunny Day.'' ``Badlands'' and ``She's the One'' were as powerful as 
ever. ``Darkness on the Edge of Town'' hasn't lost a bit of its strength
 in 24 years.<br>
<br>
The E Street Band was, as always, amazing. Weinberg drove his band mates
 relentlessly. Bassist Garry Tallent provided the steady pulse. Newest 
member Soozie Tyrell provided extra color on the new numbers. Clarence 
Clemons, recently recovered from eye surgery, sounded especially fine on
 ``She's the One.'' The show reached a peak with powerful performances 
of ``Born in the U.S.A.'' and a rousing ``Twist and Shout.''</div>

Blue-collar guitar slinger earns hero's welcome<br>
<br>
Canada Press ,<br>
December 15, 2002<br>
By James McCarten<br>
<br>
America's beloved blue-collar guitar slinger earned a hero's welcome 
Thursday as Bruce Springsteen and the legendary E-Street Band paid a 
power-packed courtesy call to their northern neighbour.<br>
<br>
One by one, they strode cockily aboard a wide, Spartan stage bathed in 
ash-grey light, the adoring crowd saving its loudest ovations for the 
Boss and the "Big Man" himself, sax man Clarence Clemons. "Evening, 
Toronto," Springsteen chortled after kicking off his only scheduled 
Canadian stop with gun-barrel renditions of Sept. 11 anthems The Rising 
and Lonesome Day.<br>
<br>
"It's nice to be back here over the border."<br>
<br>
Clad in his trademark black jeans, vest and plaid flannel, Springsteen 
stood with his back to the crowd, his arms hanging out in gunslinger 
fashion and face glistening with sweat, as his E-Street stalwarts 
churned through Never Surrender, a national anthem from 1984's Born in 
the U.S.A.<br>
<br>
A chilling version of Candy's Room, the minor-key masterpiece from the 
1978 album Darkness on the Edge of Town, offered an unexpected respite 
before another sombre trio of songs from The Rising, a moving -- if a 
tad heavy -- musical homage to his homeland's terrorist scars.<br>
<br>
After a stirring acoustic version of Empty Sky with wife and guitar 
player Patti Scialfa sharing vocal duties he segued effortlessly into 
You're Missing and Waitin' on a Sunny Day.<br>
<br>
But it was the classics this eclectic, middle-aged crowd came to hear, and they weren't disappointed.<br>
<br>
Pink Cadillac was the night's surprise crowd favourite, followed by an 
energetic reading of Worlds Apart off The Rising, followed by Badlands 
-- the ever-robotic drummer Max Weinberg keeping efficient time from his
 lofty drum riser -- and the soulful She's the One, from 1975's 
legendary Born to Run.<br>
<br>
Together with the kerchief-clad guitarist and new-found SopTogether with
 the kerchief-clad guitarist and new-found Sopranos star Steven Van 
Zandt, Springsteen mugged for the cameras as he steered an appreciative 
audience through the classic back catalogue before mugging a little for 
the cameras.<br>
<br>
"I think it's quittin' time; I think it's Canadian bedtime," a spry, if 
sweaty, Springsteen jeered after two hours on stage. "What time is it?"<br>
<br>
"Boss time," sneered Van Zandt.<br>
<br>
With that, the house lights went up and Springsteen and company, not a 
pyrotechnic or fog machine in sight, commanded the attention of a 
capacity Air Canada Centre with nothing but the title track from Born to
 Run.<br>
<br>
Indeed, as he introduced what history has come to know as one of the 
tightest bands in rock, Springsteen might have been a tiny bit put out 
by what at times seemed a downright lethargic audience.<br>
<br>
"Rule number 1: the music's got to be raucous," he growled. "Rule number
 2: You've got to get up off your ass. You ain't at home."<br>
<br>
With that, and flanked by Van Zandt and diminutive guitar legend Nils 
Lofgren, Springsteen tore into another round of crowd faves that 
included Born to Run's Thunder Road and Dancing in the Dark, the 1984 
single that made him a megastar.<br>
<br>
But the Boss didn't leave town before moistening a few eyes and pitching a few causes.<br>
<br>
There was even a commercial of sorts, this one for Toronto's Daily Bread
 Food Bank -- the second-largest food bank in Canada -- before a moving,
 piano-and-vocals turn of My City of Ruins, Springsteen's personal New 
York love letter.</div>

<br>
Birmingham News , <br>
November 21, 2002<br>
By Mary Colurso<br>
<br>
Let's start with the obvious. Bruce Springsteen is a tremendous talent, 
and he really knows how to lead a rock'n' roll band. Birmingham was 
fortunate enough to get a date on Springsteen's tour to support his 
latest album, "The Rising," and Tuesday's 8:30 p.m. show two-and-a-half 
hours long and 23 songs full lived up to his reputation as committed, 
charismatic hall of famer.<br>
<br>
The Boss was in charge all the way, from the surging opening number to 
the final, muscular encore. As guitarist Nils Lofgren said, Springsteen 
gives 100 percent from his command post on stage, backed by the powerful
 team known as the E Street Band. Too bad that about half of the seats 
were empty in the arena's upper tier, which means that several thousand 
fans missed out on an exciting evening of honest, authentic, hard-played
 American music.<br>
<br>
As expected, about half of the set list was devoted to "The Rising," a 
CD that offers heartfelt commentary on the aftermath of the Sept. 11 
tragedies. Springsteen, 53, doesn't slap you in the face with patriotism
 in these songs; he provides subtle observations that have the ring of 
truth. He's at his best when describing the particular, telling stories 
about everyday people that stir up universal emotions. Superior examples
 of this skill were offered on Tuesday night, in tunes such as "You're 
Missing," "Empty Sky," "Into the Fire," "Lonesome Day" and the 
mournfully beautiful "My City of Ruins." If you weren't on the floor, in
 the special general-admission area up front, you really needed to look 
at the large video screens on the sides of the stage during these 
moments. Springsteen's face, raw with feeling, was displayed there in 
moving close-up.<br>
<br>
While the poignancy of "The Rising" provided a sad, sweet touchstone for
 the performance, Springsteen would never turn any show of his into a 
funeral dirge. There was upbeat material aplenty, including "Dancing in 
the Dark," "Glory Days," "Darlington County," "Badlands," "She's the 
One," "Cadillac Ranch" and "Born to Run." A couple of new songs, 
"Waiting on a Sunny Day" and "Mary's Place," upheld and expanded the 
party mood. Springsteen also counted off the crowd pleaser "Bobby Jean" 
and surprised the audience by bringing up Birmingham native Emmylou 
Harris for a duet on "My Hometown."<br>
<br>
The E Street Band sounded typically strong, although saxophone player 
Clarence Clemons appeared more tentative and less flamboyant than usual.
 It's likely that he's still recovering from a recent bout of eye 
surgery, though, and the other nine band members (especially guitarists 
Steven Van Zandt and Lofgren) more than took up the slack.<br>
<br>
Springsteen proved to be such a dynamic showman, his band introductions 
(reminiscent of a gospel preacher) seemed like an event to savor. 
Throughout the performance, he thrilled fans by tossing a microphone 
into the crowd, jumping on a piano, sliding the length of the stage and 
allowing folks down front to play his guitar en masse. The next band to 
hit the BJCC certainly has a tough act to follow. So why three and a 
half stars instead of four? Well, not even Springsteen could live up to 
the massive hype surrounding his hotly anticipated concerts. This wasn't
 a transcendent religious experience, just an amazingly good show.</div>

				<div class="content">Springsteen still rules rock?s roost - Three-hour jam in Cincy proves his points, again<br>
<br>
Dayton Daily News , <br>
November 14, 2002<br>
By Ron Rollins<br>
<br>
Concertgoers heading into U.S. Bank Arena on Tuesday night passed by 
protesters urging artists to boycott Cincinnati because of its 
well-publicized racial strife--and apparently, Bruce Springsteen knew 
they were out there, too. Springsteen took the arena stage in a calm, 
subdued manner and stood at the mike as he waited for the near sell-out 
crowd to hush its long calls of "Broooooooooooce!" Then he said he'd 
been contacted by the groups "who are working to end what amounts to a 
cultural apartheid and racism that goes through all levels of our 
society--not just here in Cincinnati, but all through our country."<br>
<br>
A few people started to boo, and Springsteen shushed them with a wave 
before proceeding. Then he sang American Skin (41 Shots), his 
controversial song about a New York police shooting, and dedicated the 
show to the protesters. Say what you will about media hype, rock 
iconography, expensive tickets or festival seating--Springsteen reminded
 one and all that he remains the closest thing in American popular music
 to a loud social conscience.<br>
<br>
Later in the show, before the plaintive My Hometown, he discussed the 
mission and needs of Cincinnati's food bank, and introduced Born in the 
U.S.A. as a "Vietnam song we've been singing for 20 years; now it's a 
prayer for peace." Dialing President Bush . . .<br>
<br>
But he doesn't overdo the message, either. The lion's share of material 
he presented with the E Street Band came from his new hit album, The 
Rising, written after 9/11. The album views the violence and loss from 
both sides of the attacks - and yet Springsteen never directly spoke to 
the audience about terrorism, fear or any of the messages implied in The
 Rising's songs. Maybe that was just fine, letting the songs speak for 
themselves. They did with this crowd, which sang along with the new 
tunes just as loudly as ever.<br>
<br>
Musically and technically, the concert was an artistic high point for 
Springsteen, whose shows in the past decade often lacked the focus and 
fire of his earlier marathons. The band was in terrific shape, and the 
audience seemed to especially enjoy seeing guitarist Steve Van Zandt get
 introduced as Silvio, his Sopranos character, and saxman Clarence 
Clemons in full apparent recovery from the eye surgery that postponed 
shows in Columbus and Indianapolis and threatened Cincy's.<br>
<br>
After The Rising was presented nearly whole (and yes, Mary's Place is 
the new Rosalita), the set ran mostly to the 1970s, ranging from Does 
This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?, an early career rarity, and good cuts 
from Born to Run and Darkness on the Edge of Town. The '80s and early 
'90s got an unfortunate short shrift--but now we're nitpicking, which is
 what Bruce junkies do.<br>
<br>
Suffice to say this: For nearly three hours, Springsteen reminded us 
he's back in a very big way, entertained with an eclectic, well-chosen 
song list, left everyone begging for more and wrapped it all in an 
intelligently patriotic, thoughtful package with a punch. Not bad. Not 
bad at all.</div>

Seattle Post-Intelligencer <br>
By Gene Stout<br>
August 22, 2002<br>
<br>
It was a night of two Bruces Wednesday at the Tacoma Dome.<br>
<br>
The first was anguished yet hopeful, performing songs from his new album, "The Rising," about the mood of post-Sept. 11 America.<br>
<br>
The second was wildly exuberant, reminiscent of his 1980s heyday and the unabashed optimism of that era.<br>
<br>
In a 2 1/2-hour show featuring the reunited E Street Band, the two sides
 of Bruce Springsteen came together in a powerful, inspirational 
performance.<br>
<br>
Yet despite the new chart-topping album, attendance was down. The Tacoma
 Dome can hold more than 20,000, but only 13,000 turned out. Those with 
extra tickets before the show had a tough time finding buyers. Indoors, 
entire upper seating sections went unused, and a curtain divided the 
room.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, the faithful made their presence known. Concertgoers began
 chanting "Bruuuuce!" shortly after the scheduled start time of 7:30 
p.m. Springsteen and the E Street Band finally arrived onstage at 8:17.<br>
?<br>
It was worth the wait. Springsteen performed nearly two dozen songs, 
sticking closely to a set list he has followed in other cities on the 
tour, adding a couple of cherished songs from the past -- a "classic" 
version of "Dancing in the Dark" and the rocking old favorite "Ramrod."<br>
<br>
This wasn't a greatest-hits show, but there were plenty of hand-clapping, arm-waving favorites to send fans into ecstasy.<br>
<br>
Wearing a blue work shirt, black jeans and black oxfords and sporting a 
few days' stubble, Springsteen could have been a man snatched from an 
unemployment line.<br>
<br>
Backing him -- and sounding terrific -- were E Streeters Clarence 
Clemons, Steven Van Zandt, Roy Bittan, Nils Lofgren and Max Weinberg.<br>
<br>
Springsteen opened with "The Rising," the bold title track from a new 
album reflecting the pain, suffering and heroism related to the 
terrorist attacks. Wife Patti Scialfa and guitarist Van Zandt joined 
Springsteen on vocals, leaning into the microphone with anguished 
expressions.<br>
<br>
"Lonesome Day" was followed by "Prove It All Night" and "The Fuse," a 
darkly sexual but life-affirming new song. Springsteen's face was eerily
 bathed in red light as the song came to a close. He followed with the 
moody "Darkness on the Edge of Town."<br>
<br>
Springsteen didn't say much during the first half of the show, which was
 filled with the dark stories of Sept. 11. But later he loosened up.<br>
<br>
"It's nice to be back in Tacoma," he said. "I spent a week here one night. I got so sick."<br>
<br>
The crowd laughed at the reference to Springsteen's bout with the flu during a 1984 appearance at the Dome.<br>
?<br>
The New Jersey-bred rocker then asked for "some quiet" for two songs 
from the new album, the devastatingly sad and moving "Empty Sky" and 
"You're Missing." The latter was about a firefighter killed in the World
 Trade Center attacks. He and Scialfa sang together on the former tune; 
guest musician Soozie Tyrell was featured on violin on the latter.<br>
<br>
The mood was more upbeat on another song, "Waitin' on a Sunny Day," which prompted an audience singalong.<br>
<br>
"The Promised Land" led right into "Worlds Apart," recorded for the new 
album with Pakistani qwali singer Asif Ali Khan. The live version of the
 latter, a lament about cultural divides, featured Springsteen and 
Scialfa on vocals and was extended by a lengthy jam.<br>
<br>
The old Bruce returned with a rousing, guitar-heavy "Badlands" and 
continued with the party songs "Bobby Jean" and the new "Mary's Place."<br>
<br>
"Are you ready for a Tacoma-style house party?" Springsteen said, beaming.<br>
<br>
He introduced the E Street Band as "the greatest house band in the whole
 world." When he got to wife, Scialfa, he described her lovingly as "my 
natural Viagra."<br>
<br>
The band resumed playing the exuberant "Mary's Place," with Springsteen 
shouting "Turn it up! Turn it up!" to the dancing, cheering crowd. 
"Countin' On a Miracle," "Thunder Road" and the melancholy "Into the 
Fire" closed the main set.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and company returned for the first of two encores, 
performing the uplifting "Dancing in the Dark," the hard-partying, 
butt-shaking "Ramrod" and the anthemic "Born to Run."<br>
<br>
During his second encore, Springsteen sat down at the piano to perform 
the inspirational "My City of Ruins," his most powerful post-Sept. 11 
song. "C'mon, rise up!" he sang, as the crowd went into a frenzy.<br>
<br>
Springsteen made a plug for Tacoma's Food Lifeline and spoke about the importance of civil rights and due process.<br>
<br>
"It goes with the turf when you're born in the U.S.A.," he said before 
launching into the classic "Born in the U.S.A." Like other songs of his 
heyday, it has held up well and still packs a wallop.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and the E Street Band finished the show with "Land of Hope 
and Dreams," tying together the many themes and emotions of his vast 
musical repertoire.</div>

				<div class="content">Springsteen Backtracks - Columbia Box Surveys Music Off The Record<br>
<br>
Billboard , <br>
November 7,1998<br>
<br>
By Melinda Newman<br>
<br>
"Bruce Springsteen: Tracks," a four-CD set coming from Columbia Nov. 10,
 offers listeners a road map to the artist's musical journey, albeit via
 an alternate route. The collection features 66 tunes, 56 of them 
previously unreleased, that were left off his albums not because they 
didn't meet his high standards but because, he says, they didn't fit in 
with the tone or themes he mined for each set. For Springsteen, "Tracks"
 is a way to let the listeners into his creative process, a chance to 
broaden their understanding of how each record was created.<br>
<br>
The idea behind the set was not, as he says, to "put out the seventh or 
eighth outtake from 'Born In The U.S.A.' or 'Thunder Road' " but to 
deliver to his fans companions to the music they already knew so well. 
"I tried to just choose music that was as vital today as when we cut 
it," he says in an exclusive talk with Billboard, noting that the songs 
were culled from between 200 and 300 tunes. "It was like taking 25 years
 of music and making a new record with it. If you follow the trail of 
it, it traces alongside the path that my other records cut, but in a 
slightly different way. You get these all new and different songs that 
take you on a similar journey."<br>
<br>
The primarily chronological project opens in 1972 with Springsteen's 
audition tapes for Columbia Records and also covers songs recorded 
during sessions for the albums "Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J." 
(1973), "The Wild, The Innocent &amp; The E Street Shuffle" (1973), 
"Born To Run (1975), and "Darkness On The Edge Of Town" (1978).<br>
<br>
Disc two highlights sessions for "The River" (1980), "Nebraska" (1982), 
and "Born In The U.S.A." (1984). The next disc highlights additional 
music also recorded for "Born In The U.S.A.," as well as songs from the 
"Tunnel Of Love" sessions (1987). The final CD covers the '90s, 
including tracks recorded for "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town" (both 
1992), as well as "The Ghost Of Tom Joad" (1995).<br>
<br>
Speaking from his New Jersey home base and perhaps giving a tip of his 
hand to what's next for him musically, the voluble Springsteen says the 
upbeat nature of many of the tracks "made me think it's fun to make some
 noise again."<br>
<br>
Q: How did this boxed set come about?<br>
<br>
A few years earlier I'd asked my engineer, Toby Scott, to collect 
everything from the vault. For a week or so, I just listened to 
everything that I'd done that we hadn't put out. I made some very brief 
notes in a notebook, and then I just put it away. It was something that I
 could do at some point when I get to that place in a new project where 
I'm not sure how long it's going to take and it would be nice to sort of
 fill the gap so the fans wouldn't be so long without hearing any music 
from me.<br>
<br>
Q: Did you have any guidelines for what went on the set?<br>
<br>
The thing I stuck to on this particular boxed set was that everything I 
put on it relates back to a specific record. So if you liked "The Wild, 
The Innocent, &amp; The E Street Shuffle," you could put on the first CD
 and there's four or five things that we cut at that time for that 
record and it sort of just punches out the edges of that record for you .
 . . We made three or four albums when we cut "The River." The second CD
 is almost the completely other album from "The River." If you liked 
songs that were written about relationships or men and women, go to the 
fourth CD and it's a deeper investigation, another angle, on those 
ideas.<br>
<br>
Q: It's important that people know these aren't songs that you felt were
 inferior. They just weren't in line with the statement you were trying 
to make at that time.<br>
<br>
What happens is I was forging my identity. That was really paramount in 
many of the decisions that I made, because, first of all, you're trying 
to let people know who you are, what you're about, and you're trying to 
work your way into their lives and start a relationship basically, which
 is based on knowing one another. So at that time many of the choices I 
made for my records were both musical and then also, what was I trying 
to say and how did I want to say it.<br>
<br>
Q: Can you give me an example?<br>
<br>
Take after "Born To Run." At that time, I said, "Well, this is a moment 
when people often go wrong or get lost after the first shot of some 
success." So [with] "Darkness On The Edge Of Town," I wanted to make a 
record that specifically sent a message to my audience that I wasn't 
going to be blocked in by the success I'd had in terms of what kind of 
music I created. So the editing on "Darkness" was based around creating a
 record that had a seriousness of tone. Meanwhile, there were all these 
bar band records that we had cut [like] "Give The Girl A Kiss" and "So 
Young And In Love." So I had all this music that I couldn't use at that 
time that just got put to the side.<br>
<br>
Q: Tell me about the cover photo.<br>
<br>
This was in the Main Point [nightclub] in Philadelphia in '74. I really 
remember this couch; it was in the back of the basement. The thing I 
remember the most is this was the room where I first saw my first actual
 record. Somebody brought down a copy of "Greetings From Asbury Park, 
N.J.," and pulled it out of the sleeve. It was on that red Columbia 
label, and to me, it was like an impossibility, because I pulled 
"Highway 61 [Revisited]" out of that sleeve with the red label on it. 
Seeing my name on that red label was quite miraculous.<br>
<br>
Q: The set opens with you auditioning for legendary Columbia talent scout John Hammond. What do you remember about that day?<br>
<br>
Big day, very big day. I think I remember just about everything. I was 
probably 22 years old. I'd played in John's office earlier in the week, 
and he [said], "You need to play for [then Columbia president] Clive 
Davis, and I want you to do a recorded audition." It would have been an 
unusual recording session by today's standards. The engineer had a shirt
 and a tie on; everybody was dressed in jackets and shirts. The first 
thing you hear on the CD is John's voice where he reads off the session 
number. And I just stood up and sang the best songs I had. I was 
incredibly excited. I felt very confident about what I was doing and 
being there, and nervous at the same time.<br>
<br>
Q: How do those songs hold up to you today?<br>
<br>
I went through a period quite a while back where I felt like there were 
too many words in them and I'd written too much, but now I really like 
them because they were very free and very spontaneous. They were sort of
 written when no one was listening. And that has an effect on how you 
write and what you write. That's why I've ended up recording at home, 
because nobody is listening at home, really.<br>
<br>
I think what I like about the songs now is they're actually quite 
original. At the time, they were sort of put under the new-Dylan 
category, but if you listen to them now, you realize they really weren't
 that at all. They were just something of their own. They come up out of
 my own experience and the place and the people that I grew up around. I
 took those things and I made my own folk music out of it.<br>
<br>
Q: "Seaside Bar Song" on disc one is the first song on the set to 
feature saxophonist Clarence Clemons. You instantly hear how much he 
brought to the band.<br>
<br>
Initially, Clarence was hard to find; that's why he's only on a couple 
of things on the first record. The way that he ended up on the record at
 all is I handed it in to Columbia and Clive Davis sent it back and 
said, "There are no singles on this record. I want you to write two more
 songs." And I said, "Well, OK," and I went home and wrote "Blinded By 
The Light" and "Spirit In The Night," and we took two not very good 
songs off. I was able to find Clarence at that time, and so he ended up 
coming in and playing on those two [added] cuts.<br>
<br>
Q: "Thundercrack" is eight minutes of the band bursting wide open that 
allows the listener to really hear the band stretch out for the first 
time.<br>
<br>
I used that song as a show ender at that time. It was the precursor to 
"Rosalita." At the end of the night, I needed something that would just 
knock people out, that's gonna go on and on and they're not going to 
know when it's going to stop. And so it was nice to get it on here, 
because an early, early fan would remember that this song was a big part
 of the early shows.<br>
<br>
Q: Just as "Seaside Bar Song" features lyrics that found their way into 
"Born To Run," "Iceman" is the first to contain words from 
"Badlands"--"I wanna go out tonight. I wanna find out what I got." The 
ability to see what you nicked from your earlier material for future 
songs is part of what makes the set so compelling.<br>
<br>
That line is what I was thinking about at that time. I hadn't recorded 
in a couple of years. I was stuck in that big lawsuit [with former 
manager Mike Appel] in the early part of my career, and there was a 
tremendous amount of "whatever happened to" articles at that time. That 
whole record was a record where I felt like I was going to have to test 
myself and that was what I wanted to know, so that line ended up in a 
few different songs.<br>
<br>
Q: "Where The Bands Are" is a frothy tune. That's hardly something you're known for.<br>
<br>
That's probably why it got left off the record at the time... It was a 
very pop song. I always loved those three-minute pop songs. They tended 
to be the ones that fell away from my own records because of something I
 was trying to do at that particular moment, but I made a lot of that 
kind of music, and I think when you go to that second CD, that's what 
you hear.<br>
<br>
Q: However, not all the material on the second disc is lighthearted, 
especially "Wages Of Sin," a heart-stopping tale of the hopeless 
dynamics in a relationship.<br>
<br>
That was a real find. I forgot I wrote it. It may have been one of those
 songs that cut too close to the bone at the time, so I put it to the 
side. [Laughs] It was actually cut for "Born In The U.S.A." What happens
 is very often you have your own personal sensitivities about a 
particular piece of music or you may be uncomfortable with the way 
you've sung or what the song is about and you steer away from that a 
little bit, and I think that's what happened on that one.<br>
<br>
Q: This brings us to the version of "Born In The U.S.A." on here that's 
much slower, less anthemic than the hit version. It seems much truer to 
the spirit of the lyrics.<br>
<br>
At the time that I cut it, I wasn't sure that it was finished, but I had
 that same feeling about a lot of songs on "Nebraska," which [was] demos
 I made in my bedroom. My memory of it, after not having heard it for 15
 years, was that it was incomplete in some fashion. And when I listened 
to it again, I realized it was fine.<br>
<br>
Q: But how did it go from what's here on the boxed set to what we heard on the "Born In The U.S.A." album?<br>
<br>
Part of what happened is I had this song and then at the same time, 
because I was cutting both the "Nebraska" and "Born In The U.S.A." 
albums simultaneously, I went in and I cut the one with the band, and 
that came out so good, I forgot about this one.<br>
<br>
At that time, there was a lot of discussion about what to do with the 
two records I was making. They were so different that it was very 
confusing. There was a moment when we talked about releasing them as a 
double album; one would have been the acoustic record and one would have
 been the electric record. I tried to cut the "Nebraska" material with 
the band. I could tell that it wasn't working, so there was a lot of 
different things that could have happened at that particular moment. 
[Ultimately,] "Nebraska" came out in '82 and "Born In The U.S.A." in 
1984.<br>
<br>
Q: "Johnny Bye Bye" clocks in at one minute, 49 seconds. Is that the shortest song you've ever recorded?<br>
<br>
I like that sort of succinctness. I cut that for a record after 
"Nebraska." I enjoyed making "Nebraska" so much, I pursued it before I 
went back to making ["Born In The U.S.A."], and I did a series of songs 
with a small, little rhythm section, but they were still basically 
acoustic. "Johnny Bye Bye" and "Shut Out The Lights" both came from 
sessions that I did in my garage in California. There was almost a whole
 record that I ended up not putting out, and these are the best things 
from that.<br>
<br>
Q: Let's talk about the hilarious "TV Movie," which reminds me of Buck 
Owens' "Act Naturally." It shows your sense of humor, which you don't 
let come across in your music very often.<br>
<br>
I always envied writers who were able to incorporate that in their 
music. A lot of my favorite rock performers were clowns. When you see 
Little Richard or the Coasters or Jerry Lee [Lewis], there was some 
element of that in all of them. I loved the desire to make your audience
 laugh on some level. Onstage I had the physical ability to incorporate 
that in what I did, but I found it a lot more difficult to write into my
 music. If I did come up with it, very often when I was making the final
 cut, that's what I'd leave off.<br>
<br>
Q: One of the most affecting songs on this disc is "The Wish," a clearly
 autobiographical song about a son whose mother buys him a guitar at a 
great sacrifice.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, that was my mother, that was my mother completely. That's 
probably why I didn't use it on the record; it's one of the most 
autobiographical things I ever really wrote. I wrote it for "Tunnel Of 
Love" and she just might have been more of presence in my life at that 
particular time. I got married, and I was reconnecting with my family in
 a way I hadn't for quite a while.<br>
<br>
Standing outside that music store, the guitar was $ 60. That was an 
enormous, enormous amount of money at that time. It was simply money 
that we just really didn't have. My folks were always in debt to the 
finance company. It was right around the corner from our house, and all I
 remember is my mother going back and forth. They'd borrow for this and 
pay it off just in time for Easter and pay it off in time for the next 
thing.<br>
<br>
So [buying the guitar] was a great, a very meaningful gesture of faith 
at that time from her. I told her I needed an electric guitar so I could
 play in a band so I might have a chance to make some money. And we 
stood outside of the music store in Freehold, N.J., and that's where the
 song opens up.<br>
<br>
Q: It segues into some beautifully descriptive memories of your mother getting ready for work and your childhood.<br>
<br>
I remember very particularly the sounds that came from the bathroom 
while she got ready for work, the sounds of the sink and the water 
running. The makeup case hitting the surface of the sink. And the place 
where she worked was filled with women, secretaries. When I came in, I 
was a little boy, probably 8 years old, 9, 10, and they all'd gather 
around you and make a big fuss over you. My mother's desk was all the 
way in the back, so I had to walk past all their desks, and everybody 
would come up and give you a pat on the head.<br>
<br>
Q: Do you think you have a keener sense of observation than most people?<br>
<br>
I don't know. I don't know if writers have a keener sense of observation
 or if you simply develop a language with which you can express what you
 see. I think a lot of writers and artists are people who, very 
naturally, their first response was to watch and see what was happening 
and then join in or not.<br>
<br>
Q: That leads right into "Lucky Man." There's a romanticism about being a
 loner in a lot of your songs. What's your fascination with that?<br>
<br>
The loner is an archetype and just a deep part of the American 
character. Who were all those people who took off out West? Who were all
 those guys who took off on their own? It's that sort of a character 
type that's at the core of a lot of my characters who struggle. It 
manifested itself in some fashion on almost every record I make.<br>
<br>
Q: Disc four is just you, keyboardist Roy Bittan, and studio musicians. 
You can almost feel the freedom to experiment that you were afforded by 
that.<br>
<br>
We recorded a lot of music for the "Human Touch" record, and it was just
 in search of what was I trying to say. I knew I wanted to develop the 
ideas I'd written about on "Tunnel Of Love." I felt that was where I had
 something of value to communicate.<br>
<br>
Initially during that record, I thought about putting out a record that 
was basically a bass, a synthesizer, and rhythm, and it created a very 
austere context for [the] songs to come forth in. I think that happens 
on "Over The Rise," "When The Lights Go Out," "Loose Change," "Goin' 
Cali" . . . They were experimental pieces, and they were away from the 
rock music I was making at the time. Even though it's electric music, it
 has more to do with "Nebraska."<br>
<br>
Q: The most recent recording on here is "Gave It A Name," a tale of a wife beater that you recorded this August.<br>
<br>
What happened is I cut the original at the time I cut these other songs,
 but we couldn't find the master tape of it, and I really liked the 
song. So Roy came out, and we recut in August.<br>
<br>
Q: Like so many of your songs, it has Biblical references. Have you ever formally studied the Bible?<br>
<br>
No, I haven't really. I mean, I read through it from time to time, but 
those particular references are just a part of everyone's internal 
landscape at this point. Everyone knows those stories and understands 
what you're talking about when you use those references... I guess [the 
song] was sort of a study of what people do with the parts of themselves
 they don't like very much.<br>
<br>
Q: What kind of stuff are you working on now?<br>
<br>
I had some acoustic things and I had some electric things, and 
basically, at some point, I'll return to those things. But I don't have a
 set project at the moment that I'm committed to. I'm writing and seeing
 what comes out.<br>
<br>
Q: Are you going to tour behind this boxed set?<br>
<br>
It's sort of something that I'm thinking about, but I don't have any committed plans as of yet.<br>
<br>
Q: Are you and the E Street Band getting back together?<br>
<br>
Well, I don't know. It's been 10 years, and everybody's living in 
different places and doing different things. But I love all the guys, 
and we made music together that was very, very special. It was just a 
great, great, great time in my life playing with those guys. I know we 
have young fans who have never seen us, so it's always a subtext of our 
conversations and it's always there in the air somewhere, but at the 
moment we don't have any particular plans.<br>
<br>
Q: In an interview several years ago, you were asked if, by moving to 
L.A. and buying a big house, you had let your fans down. You said, "No, 
I've kept my promise." Do you still feel like you have a promise to keep
 to your fans?<br>
<br>
Oh, basically you just try to keep them to yourself, and then you hope 
it works out for everybody else. You think who you want to be, and 
there's days when you're that person and there's days when you're not. 
Everybody struggles with that part of themselves, and my work maps out 
that struggle.<br>
<br>
I've got my own life to live and I sort those issues out for myself, and
 in turn, hopefully when I go into my work, there are things that help 
my fans sort through their own struggles and their own issues. You know,
 that's just what I've always tried to do, and that's what I still try 
to do.</div>

				<div class="content">Springsteen, band born to run a reunion tour<br>
<br>
Washington Times , <br>
February 1, 1999<br>
By George Varga<br>
<br>
Fans who hope the impending reunion of Bruce Springsteen and his fabled E
 Street Band will be a long-term affair may be in for a disappointment. 
That's the word from "Late Night With Conan O'Brien" drummer and band 
leader Max Weinberg, who on March 1 begins a leave of absence from the 
NBC show to start rehearsals for perhaps the most-anticipated rock 
reunion tour of the decade.<br>
<br>
"I think you can only reunite once, and that's what this endeavor is," 
Mr. Weinberg says from the Manhattan studios for "Late Night," whose 
seven-man band he has led since the show's 1993 debut. The full lineup 
for the reunited E Street Band has yet to be disclosed, though bassist 
Garry Tallent and guitarists Nils Lofgren and Steve Van Zandt also have 
been confirmed.<br>
<br>
"This came about around the holidays, when Bruce asked me," Mr. Weinberg
 says. "I'm very much looking forward to the tour, and to returning to 
'Late Night' sometime after summer. I have found the second act of my 
life at NBC with Conan to be something I truly and deeply enjoy.<br>
<br>
"It's been enormously satisfying to me, and I was in no way looking to 
make any changes, temporary or otherwise. This tour is the result of 
positive dialogue between all the parties - Conan, NBC and Bruce's 
people."<br>
<br>
Mr. Weinberg was the third and best-known drummer in the E Street Band, 
which he joined in 1974. His solid, no-nonsense playing anchored Mr. 
Springsteen's music until 1989, when the Boss unexpectedly disbanded the
 group, which had become synonymous with his name.<br>
<br>
Apart from a brief E Street Band reunion in early 1995 to record a few 
new songs and film a video, Mr. Weinberg has not formally worked with 
Mr. Springsteen during the past decade. He is featured, however, on many
 of the 66 songs on "Tracks," the new four-CD box set that features 56 
previously unreleased Boss songs recorded between 1972 and last year.<br>
<br>
"When the E Street Band broke up in '89, my reaction was I would never 
get to play these songs again," says Mr. Weinberg, a married father of 
two. "And I've gotten over that; we've been broken up for 10 years and 
I've gotten over it. But now I'm really looking forward to playing these
 songs again, and bringing the maturity I've gained in the last 10 years
 to them."<br>
<br>
The veteran drummer predicted the reunion tour would begin after several
 weeks of rehearsals, which are scheduled for early March. He declined 
to disclose when or where it would begin, though several unconfirmed 
reports indicate the tour will likely kick off in Europe before hitting 
the United States in early summer. No cities or dates have been 
confirmed.<br>
<br>
Mr. Weinberg did say the tour will be in progress by April 13, when 
he'll celebrate his 48th birthday. He was less certain whether the E 
Street Band would perform with Mr. Springsteen on March 15 in New York 
City, when the Boss will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of 
Fame.<br>
<br>
"No one's ever mentioned that to me," Mr. Weinberg says. "It's safe not 
to assume anything. But I'm delighted he is being honored in that 
fashion. No one deserves it more."<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen and the E Street Band's reunion tour will not be in 
support of an album of newly recorded material. Consequently, it could 
be viewed by some as an onstage embodiment of "Glory Days," the 
bittersweet 1984 Springsteen song about nostalgic yearning.<br>
<br>
"When you play with the E Street Band, nothing about that experience 
resembles nostalgia," Mr. Weinberg says. "It's extremely immediate, it's
 hard work, it's the top of the field, as far as I'm concerned. I can 
tell you this There will be plenty of music that we've never played live
 before.<br>
<br>
"We have never played a lot of the songs that people will be hearing. 
We've recorded them, but not played them live. I think the 'Tracks' 
box-set is a good indication of a lot of the things I'm working on now 
to learn for the tour .<br>
<br>
"I've had to deal with a repertoire that I've never performed, to a 
large extent, so it's sort of like new songs. Plus, there are all the 
songs people would expect to hear. . . . And it's up to the performers 
to imbue those songs with the proper emotion. In terms of the E Street 
Band, I have no doubt it will be as exciting and intense as ever."<br>
<br>
"This will be hard-hitting, and I think it will be a fairly lengthy 
show. I know one thing I can't stop till Bruce says to stop."</div>

<br>
November 29, 1998<br>
By Roelof Aucamp<br>
<br>
If you go for a drink in any bar in the American heartland and you start
 calling the Pope a mushroombrain after a few drinks, chances are you'll
 get no reaction. If you consume a few more and call President Clinton 
stuff that would make Larry Flynt proud, the chances of getting your 
butt kicked would move up to about twenty percent. But you would have to
 be very drunk or stupid (or both) to proclaim anything remotely 
negative about Bruce Springsteen. Not only is Bruce Springsteen a rock 
superstar, but he is also an American blue-collar icon. During the 70s 
and 80s he not only sang about the everyday challenges and triumphs of 
the ordinary worker, he also put his money where his mouth was. He 
donated millions to a fund helping the laid off workers of a Detroit 
motor plant. He donated much needed dollars to keep American heartland 
towns out of the red during the harsh Reagan era. Ordinary people 
weren't forgotten either. Like the cancer-ridden waitress whose whole 
medical bill was paid by Springsteen.<br>
<br>
Most of these 'endeavours' were not publicised at all. Dr. Ruth (the 
well-known sex therapist) seemed to encapsulate the feeling of a nation 
when she said"... Bruce is a national monument. This is what America is 
all about!" But that was during the Springsteen heyday in the 80s. 
Lately, however, Springsteen has struggled to keep at the forefront of 
rock.<br>
<br>
The fans received his first two albums of the nineties, "Lucky Town" and
 "Human Touch" somewhat coolly. Although entering at no 2 and 1 on the 
UK charts respectively (and no 3 and 2 on the US charts) the sales 
quickly cooled. A few weeks later "Lucky Town" could only be found at no
 45 on the US charts. The overall reaction from disappointed record 
storeowners was that "the albums weren't as good as people expected". 
However, both albums sold more than seven million copies worldwide, and 
joined all the other Bruce albums on the platinum list. But the critics 
and the fans were wondering if Bruce had lost touch with his fanbase. 
After all, the trappings of his rock wealth began to show a mansion and 
farm in New Jersey, big cars and elegant suits. How could the typical 
blue collar identify with him? They waited with baited breath for the 
next Bruce product. All secretly hoping for a second "Born in the USA". 
But Bruce, as always, did the unexpected and in 1995 he released his 
"Greatest Hits". Critics and fans alike mourned the fact that it was 
more of a historical review than an actual greatest hits compilation. 
The album didn't feature songs like "Tunnel of Love", "Fade Away", 
"Cover me" and "I'm on Fire" to name but a few. But the album still 
carried enough of Springsteen's older songs to debut at no 1 on the 
charts. Just before that the adult orientated sync-laden "Streets of 
Philadelphia" gave him a much-needed representation on the singles 
charts in both Europe and America. The song won an Oscar and five Grammy
 awards. It became the most successful Springsteen single yet. 
Springsteen then recalled the E Street Band to the studios and the world
 was abuzz. Was Springsteen finally back on the right track? Would we 
see another "Born in the USA"?<br>
<br>
But true to form, Springsteen yet again elected to do the opposite. He 
decided to fulfill a dream he long cherished to bring out a fully 
acoustic album and do a solo acoustic world tour. The critics raved over
 the album "The Ghost of Tom Joad", saying that the fire and steel that 
lacked in the Springsteen of the early nineties, were now again in 
evidence. This album won Springsteen a Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk
 Album. But the fans chose to ignore Springsteen where it hurt the most 
sales. To date "The Ghost of Tom Joad" remains the only Springsteen 
album not to be certified platinum. A stark contrast from his previous 
acoustic endeavour "Nebraska" that reached no 3 on both sides of the 
Atlantic in 1983. If the sales where disappointing (Columbia refused to 
let Bruce record another acoustic album) the tour was a revelation. All 
the venues were sellouts. Critics claimed it as the best Springsteen 
performance for at least a decade. The tour also brought Springsteen the
 coveted Swedish "Polar Music Award". This prize is awarded to the 
musician that contributed the most to his/ her art form. But still there
 seem to be something missing from Springsteen's music. Something he 
enjoyed throughout his career but lost in the nineties relevance. For it
 was losing the relevance to his audience that was the main reason for 
his waning record sales this decade. But Springsteen also needs to find 
new social relevance, time has changed since the 80s and Springsteen 
will have to adapt to that fact. If not, Springsteen will find himself 
left behind like so many other former great rock stars. Stuck in the 
marshes of aging rock and roll. His fans have high expectations of their
 "musical saviour", but it has been more than ten years since Bruce's 
last real relevant outing 1987's "Tunnel of Love". How much more 
difficult and complex would it be to satisfy the fans now?<br>
<br>
The answer, Springsteen decided, lay at his roots. By going back to his 
roots he could utilise his huge store of unreleased songs from the 70s 
and 80s. With this he not only hopes to retain his relevance with his 
fans, but also some of the dizzy heights of a super rock star that he 
enjoyed so emphatically in the eighties. Now the world will see the 
launch of this bid for relevance a four CD box set titled "Bruce 
Springsteen Tracks". This box set contains 66 songs (over four hours of 
music) that span Springsteen's entire 25-year career. "Tracks", however,
 is not another Greatest Hits in that sense. Nearly all the songs on 
this box set (56 songs to be precise) have not been officially released 
before. These songs have been great favourites at Springsteen concerts 
over the past decades and fans have keenly awaited the official release 
of songs like "Rendezvous", "Roulette" and "Frankie". But will "Bruce 
Springsteen Tracks" be successful in its aim to provide Springsteen with
 much needed relevance? A good indicator of relevance won would be the 
sales of Springsteen's first box set "Live 1975-1985". That box set has 
sold the most of any box set in the history of the record industry. 
(About 12 million copies in the US alone.) If this new box sells 
anywhere near that figure Springsteen's relevance would be restored. But
 if this boxset do succeed, Springsteena would still have to come up 
with a new album to cement this newfound relevance. Whether or not 
Springsteen will face up to this challenge only time will tell. For now,
 however, "Bruce Springsteen Tracks" is the buoy that he chose to 
resurface him into rock's mainstream in time for his induction in 1999.<br>
<br>
Next year (1999) will see the induction of Springsteen into the Rock and
 Roll Hall of Fame. The sales of this new 4 CD box set "Bruce 
Springsteen Tracks" will determine if he does so as a relevant modern 
superstar of rock, or (as so many before him) a great rock star 
belonging to the past. For the sake of rock let's hope its 70s and 80s 
saviour's latest outing lives up to the expectations.</div>

<br>
The New York Times , <br>
November 19, 195<br>
By Jon Pareles<br>
<br>
The voice is big and gutsy, with strength behind its rasp. It aches and 
it exults; it pleads, and it accuses. Behind it, the band sounds 
muscular and polished, with power chords chiming atop a big unswerving 
beat, propulsive but unhurried. Within the new songs are traces of old 
ones, half-remembered hits from the days of Phil Spector and Roy Orbison
 and the early British Invasion, evoking an unbroken rock heritage.<br>
<br>
A decade ago, that could have described the music of Bruce Springsteen. 
But Springsteen has pulled back from his old, heroic sound; his new 
album, ``The Ghost of Tom Joad'' (Columbia), broods quietly over 
unemployment, frustration and short, wasted lives.<br>
<br>
In some ways, it's like a hi-fi, West Coast sequel to ``Nebraska,'' the 
homemade album he released in 1982 between the grander statements of 
``The River'' and ``Born in the U.S.A.'' It's also where his 
award-winning, AIDS-haunted ``Streets of Philadelphia'' has led, to a 
territory of sober rumination and chronic bummers. Yet many listeners 
rely on music to stoke a sense of hope, and the sound Springsteen and 
others honed was too uplifting to discard. The triumphal tone of 
Springsteen's old songs has been taken up by younger performers like 
Counting Crows, Hootie and the Blowfish and, most dramatically, Melissa 
Etheridge, whose new album, ``Your Little Secret'' (Island), follows her
 five-million-selling ``Yes I Am'' with more of the confident blare of 
mid-1980s rock. It's not a revival but a continuation of the 
arena-filling sound of the era, which backs up unironic earnestness with
 ringing major chords and proclaims it in singing that grows more 
vehement with every verse.<br>
<br>
In the 1980s, songwriters often tied their fervor to causes or 
characters, like the troubled narrators in Springsteen's ``Hungry 
Heart'' or ``Born in the U.S.A.'' In the 1990s, however, people belt for
 their own romance, and the search for love becomes an all-consuming 
quest. ``I want to lose all your demons and go,'' Etheridge sings. ``I 
want to tear off your chains 'cause I know.'' Etheridge has entered a 
zone of rock that was briefly neglected, that of the arena anthem. While
 early-1990s rock bands turned to the self-lacerating introspection of 
grunge or the self-mocking frenzy of punk, Etheridge sang for people 
whose main anxiety came from unrequited love.<br>
<br>
Grunge and punk reveal a crisis of masculinity for intelligent rockers, 
who can no longer take for granted the sense of dominance that used to 
come with maleness and a loud guitar. (The raw misogyny of so much 
hip-hop faces male insecurity with an exaggerated reaction in the 
opposite direction.) But the old rock swagger was up for grabs by a 
woman, and Etheridge grabbed it. Tina Turner and Joan Jett may be among 
her models, but so are male rockers: Springsteen, Rod Stewart (whose 
``Maggie May'' has become a staple of Etheridge's live shows), Bob 
Seger, Bryan Adams and, on the new album, U2.<br>
<br>
Etheridge and her co-producer, Hugh Padgham, have outdone their previous
 collaboration on ``Yes I Am.'' Etheridge's newer songs are more 
spacious and more memorable, with arrangements that hold her voice in 
reserve and then let her break through with redoubled urgency. And she 
homes in on the topic that makes her fans shout along: the way passion 
conquers reason. ``To hell with the consequence,'' she insists in ``I 
Want to Come Over,'' ``You told me you love me.''<br>
<br>
``Yes I Am'' was tied to Etheridge's strummed acoustic guitar, keeping 
her close to the Midwestern rock of John Mellencamp. ``Your Little 
Secret'' features Mellencamp's brilliant drummer, Kenny Aronoff, and the
 album's first single, the title song, picks up Mellencamp's 
Rolling-Stones-in-Indiana guitar crunch. But the album continually looks
 over its shoulder at Springsteen - not his storytelling, but his music.<br>
<br>
Etheridge and Padgham have studied the way Springsteen and his producer,
 Chuck Plotkin, use sustained keyboard chords as unobtrusive cushions. 
Songs take up Springsteen's marching tempos: the Phil Spector beat in 
``I Want to Come Over,'' the expansive acoustic-guitar march in ``All 
the Way to Heaven'' and the thoughtful keyboard march in ``Nowhere to 
Go,'' which also borrows guitar from U2's ``With or Without You.'' U2's 
resolute pace and resonant guitars reappear in ``This War Is Over,'' as 
Etheridge sings, ``Melt all the chains in my soul.''<br>
<br>
After ``Yes I Am'' was released, Etheridge acknowledged that she is a 
lesbian, but in her songs the object of desire remains ``you,'' with no 
description to restrict anybody's fantasy. She does sometimes drop a 
geographical detail, like ``the muddy waters of the mighty Mo'' 
(presumably the Missouri River) in ``Nowhere to Go.'' But Etheridge 
labors to stay generic, setting herself up as a middle-American 
Everygal, with details out of Gap ads. ``Just my jeans and my T-shirt 
and my blue Chevrolet,'' she sings in ``Nowhere to Go.'' Staying 
up-to-date, two songs bring up tattoos. Etheridge also refers indirectly
 to her new status as rock's most popular acknowledged lesbian. Under 
its cliches and its melodramatic buildup, ``I Could Have Been You'' 
replies to those who condemn homosexuals for choosing an immoral 
orientation: ``A path I didn't choose,'' Etheridge insists, adding, 
``With hate you justify your crime/A crime compassion can erase.'' And 
in ``Shriner's Park,'' another slow-building march, the inevitable 
pronoun is ``you,'' but the scenario could easily be the story of 
teen-age lesbian trysts with a girlfriend who decided to stay straight.<br>
<br>
Most of ``Your Little Secret'' sticks with common situations - 
temptation and seduction, cheating and losing - and Etheridge hurls 
herself into them, capturing obsession and infatuation in songs like 
``An Unusual Kiss'' and ``I Want to Come Over.'' Her songs don't 
withdraw into desire; they make desire fill the whole world. But only in
 pop songs can people live exclusively for passion. Even when he was 
helping invent the arena anthem, Springsteen rarely devoted the style to
 simple love songs. He saw not just potential lovers but friendships, 
jobs, families. As he matured, he lost adolescent visions of heroic 
romance and started to consider how adults make it through everyday 
life.<br>
<br>
On ``The Ghost of Tom Joad,'' Springsteen never raises his voice; he 
sings as if he's humbled by what he knows. He gently picks his acoustic 
guitar; keyboards and whispering drums waft in behind him, as the tunes 
rise a few notes, then fall to earth. It's Springsteen in Woody Guthrie 
mode, setting stories from newspaper articles and thinking about justice
 for the downtrodden. The title song, named after a character in John 
Steinbeck's ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' vows that Tom Joad's ghost will 
appear ``wherever there's somebody fightin' for a place to stand/Or a 
decent job or a helpin' hand.''<br>
<br>
A few other songs also point fingers: ``Sir you tell me the world's 
changed,'' a furnace worker sings in ``Youngstown.'' ``Once I made you 
rich enough/Rich enough to forget my name.'' But only a few songs are 
heavy-handed. In most of them, Springsteen doesn't find lessons as 
Guthrie would; he just tells another tale of someone up against the 
insurmountable.<br>
<br>
The songs are about hobos, ex-convicts and small-town bank robbers, as 
well as people new to Springsteen songs: immigrants from Mexico and 
Vietnam, contracting AIDS as hustlers or watching their shrimp boats 
burn. After a night with the woman he loves, a man in ``Dry Lightning'' 
is told, ``Ain't nobody can give nobody what they really need anyway.''<br>
<br>
There's not much hope, but Springsteen sees the glimmer that makes 
people keep trying. Amid the dead-end stories, there's an anthem tucked 
on to the album: ``Across the Border'' is the prayer and vow of a man 
planning to migrate with his lover: ``I know love and fortune will be 
mine.'' Like the singer, we know they'll have to worry about more than 
the next night's rendezvous; along with the music, we're pulling for 
them anyway.</div>

				<div class="content">Springsteen rocks, amen - The Boss' church meeting at the Garden sends fans into a frenzy<br>
<br>
Boston Globe , December 15, 1992<br>
By Jim Sullivan<br>
<br>
The Church of Bruce reconvened Sunday night at 8 O'clock and the service
 was expected to last 3-1/2 hours. I say expected because one of the 
curses of being a rock reviewer on deadline is you never see more than 
half of Springsteen's second set, which happened Sunday night at Boston 
Garden, and as to the seasonal fave rave, "Santa Claus Is Coming to 
Town, "the slated final encore, well, forget about it. Anyway, the 
church was packed and the faithful yelled the "BROOOOCE!" mantra 
throughout the night. Springsteen took the stage like a supernova, 
kicking the festivities off with the brightly anthemic "Better Days".<br>
<br>
Now: Was I redeemed and reborn? Redrenched in the baptismal rock 'n'roll
 font Springsteen has long offered? Yes, but not totally. Three 
problems. One: This band he's assembled is very good and very tight - 
and I like the way the four women (plus occasionally Boss wife Patti 
Scialfa) mix it up with the boys in the band - but I miss the E Street 
Band and the camaraderie they embodied. Hey, I miss the presence and sax
 sound of Clarence Clemons. Two: Springsteen played an awful lot of 
material from his latest discs, "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town," and 
those are, by and large, B-level albums (by his standards). Three: 
Sunday night's set list was fairly similar to what Springsteen played at
 the beginning of the tour. Part of the old fun used to be the way 
Springsteen juggled every night.<br>
<br>
Enough carping. Yes, it's possible that his better days might just be 
behind him; he's admitted he's not the "prisoner of rock 'n' roll" he 
once was. But there was a lot of magic in the air Sunday night, and, 
frankly, Springsteen and this band were a lot looser than the E Street 
Band was when I saw them on the "Tunnel of Love" tour. Clearly, 
Springsteen likes the creaky old Garden. "It's nice to be in this town,"
 he said. "This is a great old building. It's real easy to work up a 
seat in here."<br>
<br>
Springsteen is the rare rock artist who, in his songs, wants to traverse
 the whole emotional gamut. Joy, love, lust, anger, rage, betrayal - 
they're all part of the mix. Chances are pretty good he's not going to 
leave you feeling depressed. One of the high points of the first set was
 "Trapped," a bif surging song that sealed the bond between artist and 
crowd. Everyone feels trapped; Springsteen, at least, is giving a way 
out for an evening. And, maybe, not to be too hokey about it, leaving 
folks with the idea hat they can muster the courage to change their 
lives for the better.<br>
<br>
Two of the best songs Sunday night were "Souls of the Departed" and 
"Born in the USA". The former was dangerous, brooding, clamorous; the 
latter, perennially misinterpreted as a fist-waving bonehead rock 
anthem, is much terser and tougher now. If you missed the rage in 
Springsteen's voice Sunday night, you just weren't paying attention. 
Ditto for "57 Channels (And Nothin' On)." It's not one of his greates 
songs, but Sunday night it took on a snarling testiness that isn't 
captured on the recorded version. He prefaced it with a simple statement
 of fact: "It's 1992 and American cities are burning again."<br>
<br>
One of the strong points of the night was the guitar playing, by both 
Springsteen and Shayne Fontayne. Springsteen has always liked to stretch
 his lead lines in concert, and he's one of the best at it. The guitar 
excursions never seem like padding; they always lift the melody to a 
more intense level.<br>
<br>
Springsteen talked about how the lines between right and wrong, good and
 evil, become more blurry with age. He chatted about his kids, his wife 
and his sex life. Yes, Springsteen said, he'll be putting out a $50 sex 
book, too. (Joke.) He slid into the crowd for a bit of body surfing 
during "Leap of Faith". He dedicated "If I Should Fall Behind" to 
"husbands, wives and Bill Clinton." He danced up a storm with all the 
bandmates during "Man's Job," near the close of the first set. It was at
 that moment that the thought struck once again: No one does this job 
quite like Springsteen does. He then came back with "Roll of the Dice," 
riffing heavily on the "feels so lonely" line.<br>
<br>
The second set? Well, we can tell you it began with "Gloria's Eyes," and
 the guitar playing on "Cover Me" was sizzling. Scialfa came out to sing
 with her hubby on "Brilliant Disguise," doing a 
John-and-Paul-singing-into-one-mike thing and looking pretty erotic 
while they were doing it. Soon after that I was Globe-bound, but staffer
 Patti Hartigan rang in to say Springsteen closed the regular set with 
"Light of Day", spat water out of his mouth, and looked "pretty hot".<br>
<br>
One thing Springsteen has never lost is the ability to tap into his own 
hopes, dreams and fears and translate them to the public at large. If 
his music was more emotionally wrenching at some other point in his 
career ? the "Darkness on the Edge of Town" and "The River" period come 
to mind - so be it. This is still pretty strong stuff.</div>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen Shows That He's No Longer the 'Boss'<br>
<br>
The concert had it's high points, but the rock star needs the E Street Band<br>
<br>
Syracuse Post , <br>
November 14, 1992<br>
By Larry Hoyt<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is rock'n'rolls man-in-the-middle. As he repeatedly 
showed during his mixed-bag marathon concert at the Carrier Dome Friday 
night - before a less-than-sell-out crowd of around 30,000 - the 
singer-songwriter once referred to in pop music as "the Boss" is no 
longer the top player in the rock'n'roll ballgame. Neither a "golden 
oldie" nor an upstart challenger on the cutting edge, Springsteen is 
now, at 43, a cagy rock veteran busy redefining his image, his sound, 
and the focus of his message.<br>
<br>
The concert began shortly after 8 p.m. with Springsteen's warm greetings
 to the crowd: "Hello, my friends. Ready for a big night in the big 
room?" Then came Springsteen's drill-sargeant countdown - one of the 
most familiar send-offs in the annals of rock: "One, two, a one two 
three FOUR." Springsteen and his new 10-piece band tore into "Better 
Days". one of the better songs from Springsteen's two recent albums, 
"Lucky Town" and "Human Touch," opening the show on a positive note. 
Raising his right hand in the air, as if he were "testifying" at a 
gospel revival meeting, Springsteen set the stage for the flow of gospel
 and R'n'B musical influences that appear more regularly in his recent 
work. "Local Hero," one of his lesser new songs, followed, complete with
 an extended dual electric guitar jam with second guitarist Shane 
Fontayne that turned into a jumble of overamplified, earpiercing 
distortion.<br>
<br>
In years past, when Springsteen toured with his former band mates, the E
 Street Band, Springsteen's melodies often soared in arrangements 
featuring Clarence Clemons' saxophone, the keyboard work of Danny 
Federici, and the tasteful guitar work of Nils Lofgren or Little Steven 
Van Zandt. On this tour, the E Street Band has been left behind, and 
their presence is sorely missed.<br>
<br>
While a former E-Streeter, "Professor" Roy Bittan, still adds his own 
trademark keyboard licks to such Springsteen classics as "Darkness on 
the Edge of Town" and "Badlands," too much of Springsteen's new sound 
relies solely on the sonic attack of the electric guitar. Too many times
 Friday night, the dual guitar assault from Springsteen and Fontayne 
came across, not as a melodic exchange, but rather as a chaotic 
cat-fight. Springsteen's current band features a five-member vocal 
chorus that added a luch texture to the gospel qualities of "Real 
World," and complemented the moodiness of "Darkness on the Edge of 
Town". Backup singer Bobby King was especially impressive when he 
stepped out front with Springsteen for "A Man's Job" and the strolling 
exhortations of "Roll of the Dice."<br>
<br>
Also included in the first of two roller-coaster sets were new tunes 
"Lucky Town," "Big Muddy," the overwrought "57 Channels (And Nothing 
On)," "Living Proof," "I'm Waiting for You" - this dedicated to Bill 
Clinton ? and the rollicking "Leap of Faith." Generally, the older songs
 received the best audience response - "Trapped," "The River," "Cover 
Me," "Bobby Jean," "Thunder Road," "Working on the Highway" and "Born to
 Run." To his die-hard fans, Springsteen may still be Boss, but to a 
good part of the mainstream rock audience, the Boss's glory days are 
fading.</div>

				<div class="content">Springsteen proves he's still in charge - Palace show is perfect blend of old and new<br>
<br>
Detroit Free Press , <br>
August 18, 1992<br>
By Gary Graff<br>
<br>
There are still tickets left for tonight's Bruce Springsteen concert at 
the Palace. If you haven't already done so - and if you like a generous,
 lusty rock 'n' roll show - buy one. When Springsteen stepped onstage 
Monday night, there were skeptics among the 17,811 at the Palace. They 
wondered if his live performance would pack the same punch without the E
 Street Band, his cohorts from 1972 to 1989. And they wondered if his 
personal songs from his new albums, "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town," 
would resonate as powerfully as his broader, populist anthems such as 
"Badlands," "Born to Run," and "Born in the USA."<br>
<br>
With a two-set show that rocked well into the night, Springsteen offered
 "Living Proof" - the song and the evidence - that neither has changed 
his position as rock 'n' roll's pre-eminent stage performer. Springsteen
 showed that his new music could fit comfortably with his old favorites 
and that a spirit of adventure had returned to his shows after the more 
rigid standards of his '80s mega-stardom.<br>
<br>
Springsteen surprised from the start of Monday's concert, playing solo 
at center stage and rolling through a prurient and unreleased song 
called "Red-Headed Woman" ("You ain't lived/'til you've had your tires 
rotated/ By a red-headed woman"). From there, it was into a trio of 
rockers from "Lucky Town" - "Better Days," "Local Hero," and the title 
track - before he reached back for "Darkness on the Edge of Town," which
 benefited from gospel-style backup vocals and prompted the first of the
 deep "Broooooce" chants.<br>
<br>
Then came more surprises: a moody rendition of "Dancing in the Dark," 
with Springsteen accompanied only by his electric guitar and Crystal 
Taliefero's tambourine; and a bluesy acoustic version of "Spirit in the 
Night." There were thematic moments as well. A sharp combination of "57 
Channels," Jimmy Cliff's "Trapped," and "Badlands" made for ringing 
social commentary, while "the love part of the show" - "Leap of Faith," 
"Man's Job," and "Roll of the Dice" - was buoyant and playful.<br>
<br>
Springsteen made his own "Leap of Faith" during that song, jumping into 
the front rows of fans, who promptly hoisted him in the air, held him up
 and then passed him over their heads and back to the stage. Springsteen
 kept most of his between-song comments brief - "Let the music do the 
talking" he said at one point - but the father of two did offer poignant
 comments about parenthood and humorous comments about love's ability to
 "drive a spike right through your heart" and "put your face in the 
dirt... but you keep coming back!"<br>
<br>
And with his performance Monday, Springsteen gave ample reason for his 
faithful - even the skeptics among them - to keep coming back for his 
shows too.</div>

				<div class="content">Soul of the Departed - Springsteen Writes A New Contract<br>
Los Angeles Weekly , April 3, 1992<br>
By Steve Erickson<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen has always been a prisoner. Sometimes he was the 
self-proclaimed prisoner of rock and, later, the prisoner of love, but 
as the '70s turned into the '80s and the '80s fell away to the '90s he 
became the prisoner of his own audience and impact...When people say 
they hate Springsteen what they usually mean is they hate Robert 
Hillburn. They also mean that they think Springsteen's a phony, the L. 
Ron Hubbard of pop music whose artistic conscience, apparently alone 
among rock stars, cannot afford the luxury of becoming rich and famous. 
People who shrugged off the gall of a very wealthy John Lennon singing 
"Imagine" or "Working Class Hero" find Springsteen's relatively recent 
elevation in socio-economic status hypocritical, perhaps irredeemable. 
By the lights of his news albums, Human Touch and Lucky Town, 
Springsteen may think they have a point.<br>
<br>
What's striking about Springsteen in retrospect isn't that his music in 
the '70s now sounds uneven or sometimes dated...but that he was somehow 
completely relevant and utterly anomalous at once, by way of a passion 
that matched punk's on one hand and a romanticism that defied the 
post-modern moment on the other... But after surviving a potentially 
fatal lawsuit in '76 and '77 Springsteen didn't need credentials, 
conducting his stormy 1978 concert tour like a guerrilla march across 
the American shadow lands; and his best song of the decade, "Thunder 
Road," flung down the gauntlet in a gesture so defiantly pure-of-heart 
it's endured wildly different interpretations in hundreds of 
performances over the years. You can pretty much divide the world into 
those who are still swept up by it and those who aren't.<br>
<br>
By the end of the '70s, Springsteen's vision sounded exhausted. Even 
though I liked him a lot I figured it was over, that the endgame of what
 he could do was already in sight and two or three strong albums were as
 good a run as anyone got, particularly in the midst of a punk ethic 
which held that music wasn't about careers but rather blurts of venom 
and meaning that hot-wired one moment's propulsion to the next until all
 the moments just finally ran out. I was reconciled to a mediocre Bruce 
Springsteen album before he ever made one, which - with the exception of
 the perplexingly inconsequential live box - he's yet to produce. That 
in the aftermath of this apparent creative exhaustion he produced his 
two best albums, 1980's The River and 1987's Tunnel Of Love, pushing the
 scope of his music beyond its early assault on his own spiritual 
resignation, seemed an act of will as much as talent.<br>
<br>
The audience's bond with Springsteen was obviously more than musical; it
 was uncomfortably messianic...Bob Dylan found such a relationship 
intolerable almost from the beginning. Springsteen, being less subject 
to the turbulences of genius and a nicer guy, was patient a little 
longer. Then he fired his band. Then he fired us.<br>
<br>
Only rank sentimentality - to which Springsteen's audience is no 
stranger - can divert one from the conclusion that both were smart 
moves...The sound of the [E Street] band was so much a part of the 
Springsteen presence he finally needed to jettison it, not to launch any
 revolutions but to strip things down: other than a piano and backup 
singer of two and the vapour of a Mark Isham trumpet floating across one
 track, the new records are all guitars and drums that detonate like 
terrorists blowing up tourists cafes. Leaner and louder, crisp if never 
slick, less stately than the E Street Band and occasionally evoking 
early-'70s Stones like they might have sounded on Sun Records, the music
 is largely played by Springsteen himself.<br>
<br>
In the years since Tunnel Of Love, Springsteen's authentic 
self-examination may have reached a point just short of critical mass; 
and just short of dying as an artist altogether he had no choice but to 
shed not only his band and his audience but the weight of his own 
significance. It's really the only explanation for the decision to 
release these 24 songs as two separate albums rather than a double, 
which by its very form would have taken on the dimensions of a major 
statement.<br>
<br>
The evidence of HT and LT is not that Springsteen has abandoned the 
heroism that his audience has thrust upon him but that its now become 
existential rather than romantic - leading, at any rate, no 
congregations...I suspect the new albums will appeal most to those who 
have always been wary of Springsteen's mythology, bringing into the 
coalition of his audience a new segment of begrudging admirers to 
displace the yuppies who quickly retreated back to the Doobie Brothers 
once the furor was over and the glitterati who moved on to Mariah Carey 
once the trendy cachet of Springsteen's mid-'80s popularity was plumbed.
 It will make for better company. As Springsteen takes his new contract 
to the unknown audience it remains to be seen who arrives 30 minutes 
late and leaves 40 minutes early, but whatever the ravages of heroism 
and success, love and adulthood, Springsteen is certain to be there from
 the beginning and, as he's always done, play his destiny into 
submission.</div>

New York Times , <br>
May 22, 2009<br>
By Nate Chinen<br>
<br>
Reclaiming the Izod Center stage for his encore on Thursday night, Bruce
 Springsteen paused for what seemed at first like a spontaneous 
reflection. ?We?ve played here at the Meadowlands many, many times,? he 
said. High above the crowd, directly within his sightline, a banner 
provided specifics: ?56 Sell-Outs.?<br>
<br>
Then, without missing a beat, Mr. Springsteen struck a pitchman?s tone: 
he and the E Street Band would return to the complex in the fall ?to say
 goodbye to old Giants Stadium.? (Those dates are Sept. 30 and Oct. 2 
and 3; tickets will go on sale June 1.) ?Before they bring the wrecking 
ball,? he crowed, ?the wrecking crew is coming back!?<br>
<br>
It was a plainly triumphant declaration, if a mildly awkward one, coming
 as it did before ?Hard Times Come Again No More,? the Stephen Foster 
song that has led off every encore on the E Street Band?s current tour. 
?There are many, many people truly struggling in these times,? Mr. 
Springsteen said by way of introduction, even as some in the audience 
were no doubt still making mental adjustments to their fall concert 
budgets.<br>
<br>
But the song, which began in something approaching an a cappella gospel 
style, got the show back on track. The sober solicitation of its lyrics ?
 ?Let us pause in life?s pleasures and count its many tears,? as one 
line goes ? echoed the evening?s staunchest theme.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen has long been a champion chronicler of the hard-bitten 
and the luckless, and the self-directed spokesman for an idealized 
American conscience. Here, when it was time to charge through ?Working 
on a Dream,? the title track from his most recent album, he literally 
sermonized, adopting a revivalist preacher?s tone.<br>
<br>
?We?re going to build a house!? he barked, soon adding: ?We can?t do it by ourselves!?<br>
<br>
Then came a segue into ?Seeds,? an old song that found new life on this 
tour, probably for topical reasons. Its lyrics depict an oilman brought 
to ruin, but Mr. Springsteen slyly widened his scope.<br>
<br>
?The banker man said, ?Sorry son, it?s all gone,? ? he sang, naming a 
previously unspecified villain. The next song, ?Johnny 99,? felt even 
more resonant, opening on the image of a shuttered auto plant and 
building up to this pitiful cry: ?The bank was holding my mortgage, 
they?re coming to take my house away.?<br>
<br>
The band worked admirably on these and other tough-minded songs, with a 
fine, chugging fury. And there was news in that regard: as in some other
 recent shows, the drum chair was occupied not by Max Weinberg but by 
his 18-year-old son, Jay.<br>
<br>
The substitution went off without much of a hitch, even if the younger 
Mr. Weinberg has yet to find the deeper currents of the group. At times 
he got carried away by his own fills, landing slightly late on a 
downbeat crash. But his pounding energy was the right sort of fit.<br>
<br>
And, perhaps unintentionally, he helped nudge the band toward a renewed 
set of priorities: grittiness over glossiness, looseness over 
exactitude, vitality over just about everything else. Strikingly, as a 
consequence, there were a few flubbed parts and missed cues.<br>
<br>
But the general impression was arresting and potent, beginning with the 
example of Mr. Springsteen. He gave his usual force-of-nature 
performance, barreling through some tunes and savoring others, with 
strategic pockets of space cleared for crowd singalongs.<br>
<br>
This leg of Mr. Springsteen?s tour ends here on Saturday, before a 
two-month stretch in Europe and eventually his Meadowlands return. At 
that point the band will be sending off a structure destined for rubble,
 a hulk with a glorious history but no future. A character, in other 
words, right out of a song.</div>

Really, when all was said and done, it was Jay Weinberg's night.<br>
<br>
Jay who? Jay Weinberg.<br>
<br>
Jay is the 18-year-old son of Max Weinberg, longtime drummer for Bruce 
Springsteen and the E Street Band, and as of Thursday night he is the 
new drummer for Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, at least for a 
little while.<br>

"This is the first night in 35 years that somebody else sat at the 
drums," Springsteen shouted to the sold-out house at the Times Union 
Center on Thursday as Weinberg fils made his full-show debut.<br>
<br>
And how.<br>
<br>
This kid fills Dad's shoes and then some.<br>
<br>
It was clear that Weinberg has re-energized an already pumped-up band, many members of which are three times his age.<br>
<br>
But then Springsteen could rock the house with nobody on the drums.<br>
<br>
The show kicked off with "Badlands" and criss-crossed albums from 1973 to 2009.<br>
<br>
The newest offering, "Working On A Dream," doesn't live up to the sheer 
power of 2007's "Magic," but the melodramatic "Outlaw Pete" and the 
inspirational title tune both worked well live.<br>
<br>
Springsteen also dedicated "Dream's" "Kingdom of Days" to his wife Patti
 Scialfa, who is still recuperating from a horse-riding injury.<br>
<br>
More impressive was a run of requests that Springsteen honored after culling hand-printed signs from then audience.<br>
<br>
Merely holding up the posterboard emblazoned with "Thunder Road" 
elicited cheers of delight, and performing the song garnered even more.<br>
<br>
The same went for requests "Mony Mony" (yes, the Tommy James and the 
Shondells AM radio staple) and the always-stunning "Backstreets."<br>
<br>
Later in the evening Springsteen wowed the faithful by pulling out a bright pink and yellow sign stating "Kitty's Back."<br>
<br>
Weinberg was brilliant on the tune, a blues-tinged blast of organ jazz 
and beatnik poetry stabbed with electric guitar. Springsteen just beamed
 at the kid.<br>
<br>
The Boss also gave his other pals room to shine. Nils Lofgren's solo in 
"The Ghost of Tom Joad" was jaw-dropping; Little Steven Van Zandt was a 
frequent presence at his side; and the Big Man, Clarence Clemons honked 
his legendary sax on the encore of "Land of Hope and Dreams" and tooted a
 pennywhistle on "American Land."<br>
<br>
Perhaps most satisfying was a flint-edged take of Stephen Foster's 150-year-old classic "Hard Times."<br>
<br>
This visit was not quite the soaring, spiritual adventure of 
Springsteen's November 2007 downtown concert, but it was a night of rock
 and roll that won't soon be forgotten.</div>
