The Guardian, Wednesday August  7, 2002<br>
'What are you doing in Pittsburgh?" It was a perfectly fair question to 
ask and Bruce Springsteen had as much right to ask me as anyone. It was 
April 26 2000 and I was in the city to review a concert by Bruce 
Springsteen and the E Street Band for a music magazine. But, if truth be
 told, I had only ever got into journalism for opportunities such as 
these.<br>
<br>
In the 12 years since I first saw him live, I have been to around 30 
Springsteen concerts and have met him a few times outside hotels and 
stage doors, where he has scribbled his name across an album cover or 
posed for a photograph. While working for Channel 4 News, I spent a week
 sitting near him in the high court during a case he was pursuing 
against a record label.<br>
<br>
I didn't think that these fleeting meetings had made much impact on him 
but there I was, in the cavernous Mellon Arena, cheering with the 
thousands, when, during Out in the Street, he ambled towards the side of
 the stage to get closer to the whooping crowd. He was only yards away 
when he spotted me and smiled broadly. It must have seemed strange to 
see a vaguely familiar face in the middle of an anonymous Pittsburgh 
crowd and his question was a reasonable one. To be a passionate fan at 
16 is natural - and normal - but to remain one in your 30s is to invite 
derision and suspicion. I did not think of myself as socially 
inadequate; nor did I still live with my mother. So what was I doing in 
Pittsburgh?<br>
<br>
I was not always a Bruce Springsteen fan. For the first 16 years of my 
life, I was only dimly aware of his existence. Mine was a working-class 
Pakistani family and so the music I heard as a young boy in Luton 
consisted mostly of songs from Indian films; the only time western pop 
music smuggled itself into my consciousness was through the television. 
That all changed when I was 12 and I bought my first radio. Since we 
didn't have a record player, it became my sole window on to pop culture.
 That might help explain why when others went through the 80s listening 
to The Smiths, Husker Du or The Pixies, I spent my teenage years in the 
company of Duran Duran, A-ha and Lionel Ritchie. It was only later that I
 appreciated how tragic that was; at the time I was not looking for 
profound truths or insightful lyrics, and so didn't care if the music 
was not nutritious or inspiring. It didn't have to be; after all, it was
 only music.<br>
<br>
When I first met Amolak we were both 16 and had just started sixth-form 
college in Luton. Like me, he was from a working-class Asian family and,
 like me, he liked his music. The first time I saw him he had a pair of 
headphones wrapped over his turban. I asked him what he was listening to
 and he replied that it was Bruce Springsteen. I laughed. Bruce 
Springsteen? The millionaire who made his millions from singing about 
the working class? Why on earth was a Sikh boy from Luton so keen on 
this white American who looked like a mechanic, and who made music for 
white Americans who looked like mechanics?<br>
<br>
Amolak was so enthusiastic about Springsteen that I agreed to listen to a
 cassette of songs that he had made. That evening, I waited for my 
parents to go to bed and for the house to fall silent. I turned off the 
lights in my bedroom, popped the cassette into my personal stereo, hit 
the play button and closed my eyes. It was like nothing I had ever heard
 before. Here was someone singing not about dancing on the ceiling or 
total eclipses of the heart, but about real lives that I could identify 
with: about wanting to leave a town of losers; about working in 
factories and not getting on with your father. Listening to Springsteen 
made me realise that everything with which I had been feeding my ears 
until then was nothing more than the plastic posing of irrelevant fools.
 The next day I went to college and asked Amolak if he had any more 
cassettes.<br>
<br>
During the next few months I got hold of everything Springsteen had ever
 recorded. I would come home from college and go straight to my room and
 play Born to Run four, sometimes five, times straight. It wasn't as if I
 had anything else to do. Being a working-class Pakistani teenager in 
Luton in the 80s was to live a life of itchy claustrophobia. I had 
drifted through adolescence experiencing few of the things that defined 
such times: no childhood holidays, no playing football with my dad, no 
family gatherings at Christmas; no sense that there was anything beyond 
our three-bedroom semi. I knew that there had to be some way out, but 
until I heard Springsteen, I did not know how.<br>
<br>
He may have sung about American characters seeking their share of the 
American dream, but something in his music touched a chord. I heard a 
man - also from a working-class background - singing about people who 
were also living lives of quiet desperation but who had not given up 
hope. Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town, The River: these albums
 were more than just collections of songs; they were windows into an 
infinitely more compelling world than anything I had experienced. 
Springsteen sang about highways jammed with broken heroes on a 
last-chance power ride; all I knew was going to the Arndale Centre at 
weekends. It was the sound of another world, the hint of another life: 
the promise of freedom.<br>
<br>
But it wasn't just romantic escapism. On a bootleg concert tape, I heard
 Springsteen say that, "It was easy to let the best of yourself slip 
away". I translated this to mean that I could not accept a life like so 
many of those with whom I had gone to school: a life of soul-crushing 
work and early families. The moral of Springsteen's music was not to 
become a character in a Springsteen song. More than anything else, it 
was Bruce who gave me the motivation to leave Luton, and provided the 
map of how to escape.<br>
<br>
Fast-forward a decade and a half and the 16-year-boy did get out of 
Luton; I now have a career and lifestyle that my teenage self would have
 thought unattainable. During those years, Springsteen provided the 
looping soundtrack to my changing life. On June 25 1988, Amolak and I 
went to see him at Wembley stadium. That night I got to see him in the 
flesh for the first time, singing the songs that I had been living with 
for the past nine months. At 19, I went to the United States for the 
first time; my vision of America as a troubled promised land had largely
 been formed by his music and in our week there, Amolak and I made a 
pilgrimage to Asbury Park in New Jersey where Springsteen had started 
out.<br>
<br>
Two years later, I missed my graduation to see him at Wembley Arena 
after having queued for two days straight to get front-row tickets. 
Graduation day was no great loss; after all - as all Bruce fans know - 
you learn more from a three-minute record than you ever did at school. 
Just before the concert, as Amolak parked the car, I waited outside the 
back entrance to the Arena. A people-carrier rolled in, and a familiar 
face stepped out and walked slowly towards the small crowd awaiting him.
 Minutes later, I was face to face with Springsteen. There was no time 
for conversation; I simply handed him my copy of Born to Run, which he 
duly signed. By the time Amolak returned from parking the car, Bruce had
 disappeared and I had an autographed album and a very pissed-off 
friend.<br>
<br>
Over the years, I would meet Springsteen again and have the chance to 
have proper conversations with him. Even though he has had a colossal 
impact on my life, it was strangely undaunting to talk to him; he never 
cultivated an aloofness like other stars; and besides, it was never 
about him, it was about the music.<br>
<br>
When Springsteen returned to play acoustic shows in early 1996, it was 
only months after my father's death and I was out of work: the concerts 
offered blessed relief during my darkest days. That autumn I started 
work and with a decent job came the money and the opportunity to travel 
to see Springsteen across the country and all over the world from 
Birmingham to Barcelona, Paris to Pittsburgh.<br>
<br>
And so to today and a brand new Springsteen album - The Rising - and a 
new world tour which starts tonight in New Jersey. I'll be there, as a 
fan, for that show as well as his gigs in Washington and New York. You 
might be wondering why anyone would want to see one singer so many 
times, but Springsteen concerts are like nothing else in rock music. His
 fans have been described as belonging to an invisible church and it is 
at his concerts that the faithful gather, seeking salvation and 
redemption. It's probably no coincidence that I fell into Springsteen's 
music around the same time that I started losing my religion.<br>
<br>
It isn't cool to have heroes, and if you are going to have one, 
Springsteen is perhaps not an obvious choice for someone like myself. 
But to me, Bruce is the last, if not the only, great American hero. He 
has never let his fans down and his music has always been rooted in 
integrity and honesty. At 52, he is still making great music, surrounded
 by a band of brothers he has known for 30 years. He is the living 
embodiment of the ideals of his work - a working-class guy who made 
something of his life and won big, but who still carries the broken 
spirits of all the other ones who lost. That is why I am proud to call 
myself a Springsteen fan, and why I will be at the Continental Arena in 
New Jersey tonight, along with 20,000 others, to cheer the local hero 
back on stage. He probably won't speak to me as he did in Pittsburgh, 
but it won't matter: his music has been talking to me for years.</div>

Bruce Springsteen's family values<br>
Musician ,  November, 1992<br>
By Bill Flanagan<br>
<br>
At the World Music Theatre, a big new shed sitting out in a corn field 
an hours south of Chicago, Bruce Springsteen and his new band are 
playing "Better Days" to an empty room. It's afternoon soundcheck for 
the first of two nights at the World. when Springsteen finishes the 
song, distant cheering comes from somewhere beyond the grassy embankment
 that rises behind the last row of seats. "There's people out there!" 
Bruce calls into his mike and another distant roar answers. It's the 
sound of early-arriving fans, camped out beyond the gates. Bruce's wife,
 Patti Scialfa, approaches from the wings, slips on her guitar and she 
and Bruce practice their "Brilliant Disguise" harmonies three or four 
times. But Patti's got something on her mind more pressing than 
practice. She confers anxiously with her husband while the band stands 
in place. He listens, answers, listens again, then nods. Patti rushes 
offstage, a big smile on her face, saying "Where's the E-man?" A minute 
later she comes back carrying Evan Springsteen, two years old and 
wearing protective plastic ear muffs. Evan is psyched. Patti puts him 
down next to his dad and Bruce takes Patti's vocal mike off its stand, 
says in an Elvis voice, "Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce a 
special guest," and puts the mike in Evan's hand. <br>
<br>
Bruce starts playing "Johnny B. Goode," mouthing the words for the 
little boy like "come on son, you know this one". Evan's inherited his 
father's onstage stance - he plants his little feet far apart, puts the 
mike to his mouth and - when Dad gets to the "go go"s Evan sings, "wo 
wo!" Bruce is playing, the band is tapping along, Uncle Roy Bittan comes
 down from the keyboard riser to clap Evan on and Bruce is smiling at 
his kid and insisting, "Go! Go!" and Evan is insisting "Wo! Wo!" Go, 
Johnny, Wo, Johnny Wo Wo, Johnny B. goode. Bruce shifts to a Bo Diddley 
beat and tries to get Evan to sing, "Papa gonna buy you a mockingbird" 
but Evan won't let go of the wo-wos. <br>
<br>
The band, laughing (and not minding one bit that this means supper is on
 the table), slips away. Patti sits down on the stage chatting with 
bandmember Crystal Taliefero. Evan's little sister Jessica finds her way
 out and Bruce scoops up both his babies and walks around the drums with
 a kid in each arm. It could be the living room of any young family, 
except for all the musical equipment. These are Bruce Springsteen's 
better days. <br>
<br>
"It's a big change," Bruce says when asked about traveling with this new
 family. "In the past I think one of the ideas of the road was the idea 
of escape. The idea is the search for adventure or experience. For me, 
part of it was throwing off whatever your daily life is. Even when 
you're traveling in a van with six other guys, it's all-consuming. It's 
not that particular thing for me anymore. So the trick now was to make 
it all work together. It's been going good. <br>
<br>
"If I have any knowledge about the way that relationships work - whether
 it's partners or kids - it's, you gotta be there. That's what kids want
 - to see you on a steady basis. That's the most fundamental thing that 
you communicate. Particularly when they're real young. The first five or
 six weeks everybody was adjusting to it. Particularly because at the 
time the schedule was tighter and the show felt so exhausting. That took
 a little reorienting. 'I can't play this many shows this close together
 ' cause then when I go home all I'm going to do is sleep.'" Springsteen
 laughs. "I'm not going to be any good to anybody. So we sorted it out, 
the spacing is slightly better, and it's been great. I've got plenty of 
energy, we all travel together. I really, really enjoy it. Part of what 
Patti does with me is say, 'Get out there and work! Get out there! Say 
what you've got to say.' And if you feel what you have to say has some 
value, that's what you want to do." <br>
<br>
On "Local Hero", one of the cornerstones of his concerts and his Lucky 
Town album, Springsteen tells the story of a man who finds his way home 
from a debilitating life of fame and travel. He is rescued by a "gypsy 
girl," he settles down with her, but lying in bed he still hears the 
highway call. It's a funnier version of the story he told in "Cautious 
Man" on Tunnel of Love. No matter how happy domestic life gets, the 
character still hears temptation whispering. <br>
<br>
"Oh yeah!" Springsteen says. "You got to! You don't ever not hear that. 
That never goes away. That's the point. That's what makes your choice 
mean something." Maybe what Springsteen's figured out that the Local 
Hero and the Cautious Man haven't is that it's a false choice: When the 
family man hears the road calling he go to it - and take the wife and 
kids along. <br>
<br>
Springsteen is closing most of his shows with "My Beautiful Reward", a 
song of vague dislocation, in which the narrator surveys everything he 
has and wonders why he still has not found complete satisfaction. In the
 final verse, in an unusual flight of poetry, the singer turns into a 
black bird and soars over gray fields and rivers, still searching. <br>
<br>
"I think I saw the image somewhere in a book," Springsteen says. "When I
 started I planned to write a nice song about my kids. It just took a 
funny turn. It was one of those songs like 'Highway Patrolman' in that 
there was a certain inconclusiveness to it that always made me feel like
 it wasn't finished. I kept trying to make it nice and neat, to tie up 
the ending and make it more concrete. After I recorded it I thought, 'I 
didn't quite get it on this one.' But then it started to come out and I 
realized it was right the way it was. It's one of those songs you don't 
consciously write - it comes up out of your unconscious or subconscious.
 That's why it's better than the stuff you slave over. I haven't tried 
to really interpret it. It was dealing with death in some fashion." <br>
<br>
It suggests both the possibility of finally finding your beautiful 
reward, and also the chance that even when your soul is floating out of 
your body you'll still be looking for it in vain. <br>
<br>
Springsteen answers, "I think it's that there is no concrete it, that 
idea that you reach a point where a) everything's okay, b) you're going 
to be happy now forever, c) you figure out everything. That's not the 
way life is lived, that's not the human experience. I think that when 
you begin to deal concretely with your own mortality and your family and
 your partner, death becomes a big part of that equation. You see your 
children. Well, your children are your afterlife, there they are. And 
your love with your partner is, too. That lives on through your kids. 
That's your afterlife. <br>
<br>
"Forty-two is still really young, but it's old enough to see the whole 
picture, and it's old enough to stop living completely for yourself and 
to start seeing the lines that you're leaving, how things start to 
spread out in front of you. That was a good song to finish the record 
with because I wasn't trying to make and Everything's Coming Up Roses 
kind of record. I was trying to make a record that was really strongly 
positive and had a feeling of real love in it and real hope. Because 
I've felt and found those things in my own life. But I wasn't trying to 
present it as a blueprint. I was trying to stay away from all the fairy 
tale stuff. That song expresses a little bit of the part of everybody 
that's always alone. <br>
<br>
"It's not like any of my early road songs, it's not about escape. It's 
about coming to terms with different realities. Sort of a confrontation 
with your own individual soul or spirit. But I think it was an important
 end for that record. I was trying to write about - like in 'Big Muddy' -
 moral ambivalence and moral ambiguousness. Hey, morality is something a
 lot of people can't afford." <br>
<br>
One of the reasons "Beautiful Reward" come as a surprise is that while 
his early songs contained great bursts of poetic language, Springsteen 
has for years pared his lyrics down to basics. On this tour, when he 
performs "Growin' Up" or even "Thunder Road", the change in his 
songwriting over the years is striking. He says that the change was 
premeditated. <br>
<br>
"There were two reasons. I altered the language of music. And I wanted 
to get away from the Dylan comparisons at the time. Which, really, I go 
back now and the songs has a lot of imagery in them but they weren't 
like Bob's songs at all. But at the time I was self-conscious about it 
and trying to find my own voice. I just felt like I wanted to speak more
 directly. I liked the way Robbie Robertson was writing at the time with
 the Band. Sort of colloquial. It sounded like people telling stories 
and talking about themselves, as if you were sitting on the couch. So I 
started to go in that direction. In the end I'm not sure what difference
 it makes in communicating, but at the time it was something I wanted to
 pursue and I've gone that way ever since. I tend to opt for simplicity 
and clarity. I like the images to be clear." <br>
<br>
Singing songs like "Growin' Up" now, Springsteen says, "They all had 
funny imagery and a lot of humor in them. And I got some of that back on
 Lucky Town. That humor's sometimes the toughest thing for me to get 
into my music." <br>
<br>
What's changed a lot on Lucky Town, though, is the degree to which 
Springsteen is writing in the first person - his new songs are sung by 
"me" to "you". There's no Magic Rat, no Highway Patrolman, standing in. <br>
<br>
"You get more comfortable with who you are and you create less of a 
persona," Springsteen says. "I was concerned about the music being that.
 That's what I was looking for. That's what I waited for when I was off:
 to find something that felt like the music I should be singing now. 
Something I felt would be defining to my audience, that would help 
people get a fix on where I'm standing and who I am. I waited for quite a
 while for that stuff to come out and for me to be able to get to it. I 
initially tried to write more genre-like, Some of the better examples of
 that ended up on Human Touch. I always say, 'Oh, I'll make this album 
10 rock songs or 10 this or 10 that, get away from searching, searching 
all the time.' If I put more records out maybe I'd have an opportunity 
to do that. I'd like to put more records out, but I always say that and 
never do. <br>
<br>
"I had been through a lot of changes and a lot of experiences through 
the '80s. I think people listen to my music to find out about 
themselves. I've got to press to find out about myself before I can 
broaden it and present it. So it took a while. But it felt good." <br>
<br>
I tell Springsteen that it's surprising to hear how much his writing is 
affected by his expectations of how it will be heard. In the '70s he 
worried about irrelevant Dylan comparisons, in the '90s he sweats over 
what his audience expects. <br>
<br>
"I guess," he says softly. "Yeah, yeah. I believe everybody who writes 
has an audience in his head, whether it's an imaginary audience or your 
real audience. I had a feeling who my audience was most of the time and 
why people came to my music or bought my records or came to my shows. I 
felt I knew what I was delivering that drew people to those things. At 
least a core of the people that have come. I always write with an 
audience in mind. Not in terms of if it'll be a big hit, but in terms of
 what the music's delivering. It's pretty simple - I try to write really
 well, I try to write emotionally. And if I feel that coming back at me 
then I feel like I'm doing my job. That's why people come to my music - 
for some emotional experience or a perspective, either on their own 
lives or on the world that they're living in, or on their relationships.
 For a perspective. <br>
<br>
"Until I get some perspective on it, I can't find it. Once I find a 
point of view, that's where I'm standing and that's when the records are
 released. That's what gives me the motivation to come out and travel 
and tour and work and try to stay a part of the thread of people's 
lives, just by doing my job." Bruce lets out a laugh. "It feels like a 
big job a lot of the time. I'm historically ambivalent at this point; 
it's just always been a part of my personality that I say, 'Gee, maybe I
 should've been a truck driver.' It's baloney but everybody does it. 
Maybe it's a way of escaping whatever you feel the responsibility of 
your job is. <br>
<br>
"I've tried to keep my eye on the ball, to keep a clear view of those 
things. And I try to be consistent with the characters. The guy on 
'Beautiful Reward' is the guy on 'Born to Run'. Hey, that's where life 
has taken these people. I always try to make sure the stuff I'm writing 
is inclusive in that sense. That it's broad enough. It's partly about me
 but for it to work right it's got to also be partly about you. If it's 
just one or the other something's missing." <br>
<br>
Springsteen moves around his dressing room. Outside the fans are coming 
in. "I'd like to do more experimental things," he says. "Things where I 
step out of that specific chronology. I feel like I need to find an 
outlet that will sort of allow me to take a side road here and a side 
road there. If I made more records I'd be able to do that, even if they 
were less consistent in some fashion." <br>
<br>
Like Neil Young? <br>
<br>
"Yeah! he goes over here and over there. I like the idea of that 
freedom. I don't tend to do it on my own. At some point I'd like to find
 some place to move like that." <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Out in the backstage corridor is Roy Bittan, the happiest man in 
Illinois. I've never seen Roy this happy. He's been Springsteen's 
keyboard player for 18 years, he's been a top session pianist, he's the 
only member of the E Street Band still playing with Bruce, he 
co-produced the Human Touch album and even co-wrote two songs, he's got a
 beautiful wife, a wonderful son, a beach house in Malibu, but that's 
not why Roy is so happy. "I just got the R&amp;R numbers!" he tells the 
other musicians, who may or may not know that Radio &amp; Records is a 
broadcasting tipsheet. "We're the second most added record in the 
country! Only Bobby Brown is ahead of us!" Roy is bouncing off the 
walls. No, it's not a Bruce Springsteen he's so excited about. It's 
"Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough" by Patty Smyth with Don Henley, a 
single from a new Patty Smyth album produced by - (drum roll) - Roy 
Bittan. Roy has been trying to establish himself as a record producer 
for years (Springsteen says he is especially fond of an album Roy 
produced last year for singer/songwriter Will T. Massey). The fact that 
Bruce made Roy co-producer of his album was a huge boost - but as all 
Springsteen albums are produced by a team that includes Bruce, manager 
Jon Landau and engineer Chuck Plotkin, it did not necessarily establish 
Roy as a first-call record maker in the eyes of the industry. Getting at
 hit for Patty Smyth does. <br>
<br>
I mention to Roy that I could call a friend at Billboard to find out 
next week's chart position. Toy's eyes light up. We go to a pay phone 
and Roy stand there saying (or praying), "Let it go to number nine. 
Nine, nine, nine, nine." <br>
<br>
"It's number seven, Roy." <br>
<br>
"SEVEN! IT'S NUMBER SEVEN!! I'M TOP TEN!" Roy goes off to share the good
 news with Landau, co-manager Barbara Carr, the crew, the cook, the 
security guard.... <br>
<br>
Roy is the link between the glory days of the E Street Band and the 
risky new course Springsteen's set out on. Chances are the E Street Band
 will play again (as he started this tour Springsteen surprised his old 
bandmates with a generous and unexpected gift - royalties on all the 
albums they made together), but Springsteen talks about wanting the 
freedom to make any kind of album with and different musicians. He talks
 about making a whole album with the sort of bass-driven, dense sound of
 the re-mixed "57 Channels", or an album that builds songs to 
accommodate his guitar playing, instead of the other way around. He has a
 lot of ideas and this band is only the first of them.<br>
<br>
This band started with Bruce and Roy and a young trio - guitarist Shane 
Fontayne (ex-Mick Ronson, Mick Taylor, Lone Justice, with Jimmy Page 
hair, stagger and British accent), Tommy Sims (a session bassist for 
everyone from Divinyls to Garth Brooks who has never before gone on the 
road) and Zachary Alford, the young drummer of the New York band 
Bodybag. That was the band that did "Saturday Night Live" and played a 
private showcase at New York's Bottom Line. At that Bottom Line show 
Bruce brought up singer Bobby King to duet on a couple of the more 
soulbased songs from Human Touch. After the show, King was invited to do
 the whole tour. <br>
<br>
Back in Los Angeles, with the first date of the tour breathing down 
their necks and a live nationwide radio broadcast even closer, 
Springsteen started auditioning background singers. To save time he had 
them come in and sing in groups, eliminating vocalists one by one until 
there was no one else he could bear to cut. That's how Bruce ended up 
with four backup vocalists beside King - Cleopatra Kennedy (ex-Diana 
Ross and James Cleveland), Gia Ciambotti (from the Graces), Carol Dennis
 (longtime Dylan backup) and Angel Rogers (Stevie Wonder, Paula Abdul). 
Five days before the radio broadcast they made one more addition - 
Crystal Taliefero, a singer/guitarist/percussionist/sax player who has 
become Bruce's main onstage foil. <br>
<br>
All these musicians took a little time to become a band. Some of them 
weren't even all too sure who Bruce Springsteen was and were startled at
 the size and fervor of his audiences. During an 11-show stand at the 
Brendan Byrne Arena in New Jersey in July and August the band found 
itself. Initially Bruce was carrying the whole show without the safety 
net the E Street Band had always provided. Early concerts felt a little 
too careful, as if the players were more scared than enthused, which 
sometimes forced Bruce dangerously close to the line where great 
showmanship slips into shtick. Afternoon soundchecks were spent with 
bruce teaching the band more and more songs from his catalog, which 
they'd perform in public that night. No wonder some of them looked a 
little shell-shocked. But over the course of those 11 Jersey concerts 
the musicians relaxed, got to know the songs and each other a lot 
better, and found their confidence as a unit. By the last night, when 
Bruce pulled out "Sandy" and "Rosalita", the new group seemed to have 
learned the lesson of the roller coaster - how to have fun with terror. <br>
<br>
They rolled into Massachusetts with what some longtime fans dared to 
call the best Springsteen concerts ever. Band consensus is that they 
topped those in Philadelphia. Tonight in Illinois, they are sailing. The
 balance between new material and old, which tilted backward in New 
Jersey, is moving toward the new stuff again. "57 Channels" has grown 
from the Albert- Ayler-learns-guitar version of "Saturday Night Live" 
into a raging indictment of Republican policy with police sirens wailing
 and a throbbing chant of "No justice, no peace." "Souls of the 
Departed" has become one of several guitar blow-outs where Springsteen 
challenges his usual limits. Tonight he takes it into Hendrix's 
"Star-Spangled Banner". "Soul Driver" has lost its gospel lilt and 
become a slow, moody piece a little like something from Van Morrison's 
Veedon Fleece. Springsteen rewards the attention his fans pay to this 
new material with lots of his hits, as well as crowd-pleasing bonuses 
like "Working on the Highway" and "Darlington County". <br>
<br>
Bruce explains, "I had a variety of theories before I started the tour 
about what I was going to do, but you don't know until you get out 
there. I thought I was gonna be playing a shorter show." He laughs. 
"That's almost always wrong. The minute you step in an arena... An arena
 is a funny thing. Just the word itself: the stadium, the coliseum, the 
forum. The scale of the places generally calls for some large heroic or 
anti-heroic action. I think the size of the show over the years expanded
 to meet that particular thing I felt in air. That's kinda what people 
come for. The arena is a bigger-than-life experience. I think once you 
step out of the theater it's a different ball game. So I'm probably 
playing longer than I thought I would be and playing more old things 
than I thought I would be as the result of playing longer. As the show 
expanded I followed the line of the way the thing moved and felt and 
what resonated best. About 60 per cent new stuff and 40 pe cent old is 
what feels good on a nightly basis right now." <br>
<br>
Springsteen was always a cautious man about how to present his live 
shows. He played clubs until long after he was big enough to fill 
theaters, he stayed in theaters when arenas made more sense, he stuck to
 arenas when stadiums were beckoning, finally moved to stadium with 
great success in 1985, and then - for the 1988 Tunnel of Love tour 
insisted on going back to arenas. "I was always paranoid of expansion," 
Bruce says. "What was I going to lose? That's how I approached life in 
general: I couldn't imagine what I'd gain, I could only see what I'd 
lose." <br>
<br>
It's between sets and I settle into the backstage hospitality room when a
 horde of people with guest passes pour through the door en masse and 
start stripping the buffet. It's like the stateroom scene in Night at 
the Opera, they fill the place and keep coming. Ah, I figure, radio 
contest winners! No, I'm corrected, Crystal Taliefero's guest list. 
Crystal - a fireball on and offstage - grew up in nearby Indiana and 
played in local hero John Mellencamp's band. Everyone she ever met 
called her for tickets to this. After the show, at a private party at a 
chic restaurant that's been opened just for the band, I'm introduced to 
Crystal's dad Charles, a real nice man. He asks what I do and I tell him
 I work at a music magazine, that I got a call yesterday at suppertime 
asking if I could be in Chicago the next morning to spend three days 
with Springsteen. It was a mad rush, I say, but you know, I gesture to 
the fancy surroundings, there are harder jobs. "Yeah," he says. "You 
could work in an oil refinery. Like me." <br>
<br>
We get the word that soup's on and choose tables while waiters pile up 
our plates. Bruce and patti arrive like the bride and groom at a wedding
 reception and go around the room saying hi. During some shows Bruce 
tells the crowd that since h's not selling records anymore, he's had to 
take on a sponsor this tour. The fans boo and he tells them, "But it's 
not a beer! It's not an athletic sneaker! This tour is sponsored by 
LOVE!" Not it's not my place to say this, but I think the company that 
might be able to overcome Springsteen's historic aversion to corporate 
sponsorship is Chef Boy-ar-Dee. Because, let me tell you, this tour is 
the pasta express. There's noodles cooking in the hospitality room, 
there's angel hair steaming in the catering room, before Bruce goes on 
stage he sits in his dressing room chowing down on spaghetti, and 
tonight - for a special treat - he's leading everybody through a fancy 2
 a.m. multi-pasta dinner. In spite of his Dutch name, Springsteen is of 
Irish and Italian heritage. If his father's Irishness sometimes emerges 
in the black fatalism that underlines even his most joyous music, his 
mother's Italianness sure dominates Bruce's menu. <br>
<br>
Bruce and Patti take a seat at a table with Zack, Shane and Gia and 
Bruce regales his new musicians with tall tales of the E Street Band's 
adventures. There was the Jersey club owner who thought an amp was too 
loud, so he pulled out a gun and shot it. there was the time when the 
band reached football stadiums that Roy Bittan and Nils Lofgren were so 
engrossed in a ping-pong game that they didn't know the rest of the band
 had gone on. The musicians who were onstage could not get the attention
 of an excited Springsteen, who looked out at the mass of humanity and 
screamed "ONE TWO THREE FOUR!" Instead of Roy's majestic synthesizer 
hook opening "Born in the U.S.A.", he heard the dink dink dink of Danny 
Federici playing the line on the high end of the piano. Bruce laughs and
 says, "I looked down and saw 80,000 people going huh? <br>
<br>
That story gets a big laugh from the new musicians, but it sends a chill
 through crew members who were there. They remember Bruce coming 
offstage at intermission and looking for the guy whose job was to 
collect the band before the show. Bruce held up his hand and asked, "How
 many fingers? Five? How many with this hand, too? Ten? Now how many 
people in the band? How high do you have to be able to count?" <br>
<br>
There's a lot that's fun in hitching along on Springsteen's ride, but 
there's a lot of responsibility, too. Jon Landau is Springsteen's 
manager, his record producing partner, probably his best friend. Landau 
is considered to be one of the shrewdest and toughest powers in the 
record business. But it would be a mistake to think of Springsteen as 
the friendly guy, Landau as the tough one; Bruce as the pal, Jon as the 
boss; Bruce as the music, Jon as the business. They're both both. They 
work together so well because they are a lot alike. <br>
<br>
Over at his table, Landau talks quietly about Spingsteen's relationship 
with Columbia Records, the subject of a lot of scrutiny and gossip. 
First, it was widely perceived that Landau's public expression of lack 
of faith in the former Columbia boss Walter Yetnikoff helped bring 
Yetnikoff down. Second, other record labels have made little secret of 
their hunger to sign Springsteen, which would be an embarrassment to 
Columbia. Third, the two new albums Springsteen released last spring, 
Human Touch and Lucky Town, did not sell in the multi-platinum numbers 
that were expected. One might think that Landau would have doubts about 
the current Columbia regime led by Tommy Mottola and Don Ienner. But 
Landau says nothing is further from the truth. In fact, he brings up the
 subject in order to dispel it. Sure, he says, there was some tension 
before the albums were delivered. Mottola had been waiting for three 
years - who cold blame him if he was impatient? And Ienner had come over
 from Arista; who could blame him if he said, hey, if a Bruce 
Springsteen album is a smash I won't get the credit, Yetnikoff will. 
But, Landau insists, since the albums have not done as well as expected,
 Mottola and Ienner have been incredible. They have refused to give up, 
they have kept working for the records, they have been wonderful. Landau
 says he and the Columbia chiefs are closer now than they ever were 
before. <br>
<br>
One place Springsteen and Landau do part company a bit is in how much 
each cares about commercial success. Virtually everyone who knows Bruce 
well - even those with hard feelings about other things - says he is 
motivated by devotion to his art; the marketplace does not much interest
 him. Now that Bruce is on the road, playing the music he loves to the 
audience who loves him, Jon has had to twist Bruce's arm to get him to 
agree to do any promotion at all. Tonight Jon is relieved that he just 
finished the exhausting task of convincing Bruce to do an acoustic 
television concert for MTV's "Unplugged." He says that like every such 
decision, it was a huge tug of war. "And now that Bruce has agreed to do
 it he'll spend the next three weeks - two of which are his vacation - 
obsessing over it. It will occupy all his thoughts until it's done." <br>
<br>
The next afternoon I ask Bruce about it. I find him in his dressing room
 two hours before show time, strumming an acoustic guitar. <br>
<br>
"Yeah, I'm gonna take a stab at that," he says. "A lot of the new songs,
 particularly on Lucky Town, are pretty folk-based. It's all stuff I can
 sing by myself or with a band. They work a lot of different ways. I 
have some ideas for some small arrangements that'll push the songs 
themselves out front and give me a chance to present the material in a 
different way. <br>
<br>
"At some point I want to do an acoustic tour by myself and play in 
theaters. It's something I've been wanting to do for a long time. When I
 did the Christic Institute benefit I said, 'Oh, I can do this.' I'd 
like to work more steadily now if I can get myself to do it. And Patti's
 got her record coming and she's going to be working in some fashion, so
 we're trying to figure a way to make it all work out. Theoretically I'd
 like to work more, whether I have a new record out or not. Just go out 
and play. There's so many things I could do that I haven't done yet, so 
many ways of presenting the music that I haven't done that I'm anxious 
to do. I'd like to do something out of this particular rhythm I've 
gotten into. I think that's in the cards. In the '90s I want to do a lot
 of different things. I feel freer to branch out." <br>
<br>
Springsteen mentions that at the Christic Institute benefit concert in 
1990 he got to sit down and do some songs at the piano, something else 
that vanished when his shows moved from theaters to arenas in the late 
'70s. Although Bruce had spent the '60s playing in local New Jersey rock
 bands, he only got discovered when he went up to Greenwich Village in 
the '70s and played folk clubs. <br>
<br>
"It was a funny time, '72, '73," he says. "I used to come down to Max's 
Kansas City and play by myself. Paul Nelson would bring some people 
down. I used to open for Dave Van Ronk, Odetta, all those people were 
still around. David Blue came down one night and as I was walking 
offstage he said, 'Hey man, that was great! Come with me.' We got in a 
cab and went downtown to the Bitter End where I met Jackson Browne. He 
had his first album out. I auditioned for John Hammond at the old 
Gaslight. And the late at night the New York Dolls would play at Max's. 
They'd play at 2 a.m. Max's was still really thriving at the time, the 
whole downstairs scene was going on. It was the cusp of those two 
things. I was opening for, like, Biff Rose but there was that whole 
other scene starting to come in." <br>
<br>
I ask Springsteen when he realized that he could compete with Dylan, 
with Robbie Robertson - when did you know you could work at that level? <br>
<br>
Springsteen answers slowly. "I just thought I was gonna be a guy who was
 gonna have to... work really hard." We both crack up laughing. "I 
wanted to have my own vision and point of view and create a world of 
characters, which is what the writers I admired did. It was a world unto
 itself, a world you slipped into, and yet a world that felt connected 
to the real world in some very important ways. I knew when I was very 
young I wanted to do that. Dylan's writing - that's just what felt 
exciting. So I took off in that direction. Hey, everybody shoots for the
 top! You don't know where it's gonna lead you. I just took it a day at a
 time. I had real serious dedication to it, but I always felt I'd have 
to really sweat it out, to work really hard at it. <br>
<br>
"I think I wrote ambitiously. From the beginning I wrote wildly big with
 the idea of taking the whole thing in and being definitive in some 
fashion. I think the show took on that approach also. I was ambitious." 
He laughs. "I was ambitious. I was shooting for the moon." <br>
<br>
He adds quietly, "And I guess somewhere inside I felt like I could hit it." <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Tonight is the last night of the summer tour. Everyone has two weeks off
 before reconvening. During "The River" a bright half moon shines 
through an opening in the roof next to the stage. Springsteen pulls out 
all the stops. The show climaxes with an electrifying version of "Light 
of Day", the song Bruce wrote for Paul Schrader's movie about a rock 
band. Springsteen has played "Light of Day" on other tours, but it 
didn't lift off the way it was meant to - it seemed to try too hard to 
be joyous and came off as a sort of weaker "Out in the Street". This 
tour, though, he's brought out what he must have known was inside the 
song, 'cause it's the high point of the concert. Springsteen hurls the 
band through "Light of Day" in a wailing frenzy, drives the audience 
completely crazy, and then freezes in place as the music slams to a 
stop. This is not a new trick but Bruce really milks it, standing rigid 
as a statue while flowers, hats, and other objects fly past him (I ask 
later how he avoids flinching when an object comes sailing out of the 
dark and just misses his eye. Bruce: "That would be bad form!"). Then he
 screams and the whole band slams back into action. This may be repeated
 once, twice, even three times during the song, the crowd getting wilder
 each time. Sometimes Bruce fills the silence between stops with Dirty 
Harry's "Are you feelin' lucky, punk?" speech. Usually he flicks his 
eyes from one side of the house to the other, creating eruptions of 
cheering wherever his glance falls. Tonight he falls over flat on his 
back. The singers rush to prop him up by the mike stand and after a 
dramatic, James Brown-like pause Bruce screams and kicks it in again. 
From that point on all bets are off. He doesn't even bother leaving the 
stage between finishing the usual hour of encores numbers and pulling 
out the bonus "Working on the Highway". <br>
<br>
It's midnight as that song plays. Outside in the moonlight, Patti 
Scialfa is doing donuts in the parking lot in the promoter's 1960 El 
Dorado convertible, a beautiful machine with tail fins you could shave 
with. "Working on the Highway" ends, the crowd explodes, and out the 
back door comes the running, sweating, laughing, toweling band. Last 
show! Last Show! Standing in the parking lot they hug and say goodbye to
 each other, to Patti, to Landau, to Barbara Carr. They break into small
 groups and climb into the waiting vans. Inside they give each other 
handslaps and... uh-oh... Where's Bruce? Roadies come running out the 
back door yelling, "He's back onstage!" The musicians whoop and pour out
 of the vans, race up the steps, in the back door, down the backstage 
corridor, through the stage doors, into the wings, across the ramps and 
back onstage as Bruce kicks into "Bobby Jean". By the time he starts 
"Hungry Heart" and climbs up on top of the speaker columns, it's clear 
nobody in this audience is going to work in the morning. <br>
<br>
As a police car leads the speeding vans through the crowds and traffic 
and back toward Chicago, Roy Bittan, the old vet, congratulates the 
young recruits on finishing their first campaign. "We made it, boys! 
Thirty-eight shows! Half the tour?" All are exhausted, elated, 
delighted. The cop leading the vans hits his siren and Bobby King says, 
"Oops, I thought it was the intro to '57 Channels'! I almost started 
chanting 'No justice, no peace!'" Tearing up the highway toward Chicago,
 Roy talks about how strange it was to be told the E Street Band was 
ending, live with that for three tough weeks, and then be invited by 
Bruce to get back together - to collaborate on songwriting and 
production as well as playing! When the E Street Band ended he took it 
as a sign that it was time give himself fully to producing. He was in 
L.A., he got management - and then Bruce called back. Did he hesitate at
 all before reenlisting? "Are you kidding?" Bittan asks. "No! 
Artistically, Bruce is the best. I hope to always work with him. And the
 fact that we were writing together meant our relationship was 
progressing. That was important to me." <br>
<br>
As we drive down Michigan Avenue, past the jutting castle tower of the 
Chicago Waterworks, Roy tries to explain to undomestic Shane why every 
building, every house, must have a small pipe coming through the roof to
 accommodate water pressure. Shane stares at Roy with polite 
incomprehension. Roy says, "Think of it as a parametric equalizer for 
your toilet." He is the man they call "professor." <br>
<br>
Bruce lands in the hotel bar and raises a glass of champagne to his 
bandmates. I compliment him on the guitar solo he took on "Human Touch",
 a keening, almost whistling lead quite different from his usual 
playing. Bruce says he's been working on his guitar playing a lot 
lately, and often thinks that if he'd stuck with that - his first 
vocation - instead of switching his concentration to songwriting he 
might have become a really good guitarist. <br>
<br>
"In my first band I was hired as the lead guitarist," Bruce says. "I 
couldn't play much lead but I could play a little more than everybody 
else. Like any at all! There was a time when the general playing ability
 in the local bands was really rudimentary. And it seems like everybody 
learned a lot slower. I think these days kids pick up a guitar and in a 
year or two they've got Eddie Van Halen licks goin'!" <br>
<br>
I tell Bruce we shouldn't have this discussion in the bar. Let's go up 
and get the tape recorder out. Bruce Springsteen is a cautious man. He 
wants to work this out. It's quarter to two. Bruce wants to go get a 
massage, which he reckons will take until quarter of three. Then he 
wants to get some dinner. He asks if it would be okay if he came by my 
room to tape some more interview at 4 a.m. Sure, I say, great, see you 
then. For the next two hours I discover the truth in "57 Channels and 
nothing on". At 4:15 Bruce calls and says, let's wait till the morning. 
Fine, I say. I close my eyes and it seems like about two seconds later I
 hear "shave and a haircut" knocking on my door. I open it and there's 
Bruce. He comes in, sits down and starts talking. An hour, two hours, 
three hours. The phone rings, he's going to miss his ride to the 
airport. Bruce doesn't stop. <br>
<br>
"I didn't sing in the Castiles, my first band," he says. "I basically 
played the guitar. Everybody in the band felt that I couldn't sing at 
all. I think I got to sing one Dylan song. Over the years I started to 
sing a little bit more, eventually I think we ended up splitting a lot 
of the vocals. And after that I went off and had my own bands. <br>
<br>
"I put together a real Hendrix/Cream three-piece group called Earth for 
quite a while. That was the Day of the Guitarist. Alvin Lee and Jeff 
Beck and Clapton and Hendrix. And locally I was the guitarist, I was the
 fast gun at the time. <br>
<br>
"When I got my record deal I was in a place where I'd said, 'Gee, 
there's a lot of guys who play really well. There's not a lot of guys 
who write that well.' I think I'd decided that if I was going to create 
my own point of view, my own vision, it wasn't going to be 
instrumentally - it was going to be more through songwriting. So I put a
 lot of my energy into that. I had no band for awhile, I just wrote a 
group of songs that felt unique to me, and that was when I went up and 
met [Columbia's] John Hammond - that was the stuff I played for him. <br>
<br>
"Then I was typecast as an acoustic act for a while. Locally I took a 
tremendous amount of heat. When the first record came out people were 
incensed that there was no electric guitar on it! It was like I screwed 
up. All I heard everyplace I went was 'Where's the guitar, man? What 
happened?' I had such a big local reputation in the Jersey area - and a 
little bit down south, 'cause we'd play in Virginia and Carolina - as a 
hard-rockin' guitar band that when the first record came out people were
 sort of, 'What happened?' <br>
<br>
"But I felt like I knew what I was doing, I stuck with it, I put the 
band together after that record. I became more arrangement-oriented, I 
got more interested in how the thing was going to function as an 
ensemble. If there needed to be a solo I tended to give it to Clarence. 
I'd like to play a little bit more now, but I still relegate it to the 
song. I always felt the song was my fundamental means of communication. 
It would be nice to do something that was out of that context, something
 that was less immediately song-oriented. More texture-oriented or 
abstract or something." <br>
<br>
When you were playing in Earth, were you playing like Alvin Lee and Hendrix? <br>
<br>
"Oh yeah." <br>
<br>
Did you have better chops in 1969 than you had in, say, 1975? <br>
<br>
"Because I played so much more, I probably had a wider range of things 
that I played. Right now I'm playing pretty well in a sort of limited 
vein. It's the old story, you gotta play a lot. I have sort of an area 
that I'm playing in. There was a lot of fast guitar playing at the time 
because that's what was going on. Eventually I moved away from that 
idea. I got more into what B.B. King was doing, I liked the idea of less
 notes. Yeah, I probably had a little more flexibility or dexterity at 
the time. But it doesn't really leave you that much, it doesn't go that 
far away. Generally I haven't created a context where I allow myself the
 freedom to stretch out and play and investigate ideas more 
instrumentally. But maybe I'll get to it." <br>
<br>
You do have a very distinct, emphatic guitar style which you use to 
convey strength, anxiety, joy - but you very rarely use guitar to convey
 tenderness or melancholy. You tend to go to harmonica for that. <br>
<br>
"Yeah. I played a little bit on 'If I Should Fall Behind' and in the 
early days I had 'Sandy'. A little bit, not that much. I was probably 
more confident of my voice in my songs than I was in developing a 
distinct voice on the guitar. And when you're leading the band, singing,
 and writing the songs eventually you've got to make some choices. I 
choose to go away from a long, jamming sort of style, even though I did 
it for a long time when I was younger. As I got older I wanted to be 
more direct, clear, immediate and not waste a lot of time." <br>
<br>
The talk turns to his new work. On "Real World", a central song on Human
 Touch, Springsteen sings, "I still got a little faith but what I need 
is some proof." On Lucky Town the birth of his son brings him "Living 
Proof." <br>
<br>
"Yeah," Bruce smiles, "that's what people do for each other. My 
relationship with Patti - she just somehow managed to bring to me a lot 
of self-acceptance. Just the way she looked at me or the way she was 
with me. People can come in and help center you and pull out the best of
 you and tell you when you should cut yourself some slack and when you 
ought to be working a little harder. That's what we do for each other 
when it's working right. Kids do it too. Kids make you rise above 
yourself." <br>
<br>
Some successful musicians discover that when they find the secure love 
of a family, they no longer need the love of an audience. <br>
<br>
"There's people who feel the other way, too. There's people who feel, 'I
 get what I need when I go onstage and I don't need the rest.' I felt 
like that for a long time. I always got to a point in relationships 
where if it got too complicated or there was too much pressure, whether 
it was right or not I'd say, 'Hey, I don't need this!' That's the 
classic line. I don't need this. The only thing I've been able to figure
 is, that's never true. You do need it. <br>
<br>
"But I figure it can work the other way, too. The connection with your 
audience is something you want and you need. I guess I feel that's how I
 impact upon the world. I didn't see any reason why both of those things
 couldn't nurture each other. That was the idea anyway. And the tour is 
when you experience it the most. Both things are happening: My family's 
here and the audience is out there. It's a balancing act. Some days you 
do it poorly and some days you do it really well. <br>
<br>
"But I can understand that feeling. Because I think if you develop a 
real happy family thing you're always tempted to take refuge in it. 
Which is part of why it's there. Just like you can take refuge in your 
work. That's partly why it's there. But if you hide in either one of 
those things, maybe you're cutting off a part of yourself. <br>
<br>
"The idea is that you and the audience learn together. You ferret out 
your own illusions. That's what my work is about - people stumbling 
across their own illusions, letting them drop to the wayside, then 
trying to move on a little further, finding something that's real. And 
then you bump into your deeper illusions." Bruce laughs. "You try to let
 some of them slip. And through it all you try not to get lost in the 
distortion of fame or success, or the different things that the job 
brings along with it." Bruce looks up and smiles and says, "It's a 
trip." <br>
<br>
It's hard for anyone who's not famous to talk about what being famous 
does to you, but it sure does seem that Springsteen's been working to 
dismantle his superstardom ever since the Tunnel of Love album and tour.
 <br>
<br>
"I feel less famous at the moment!" Bruce says and he lets out a big 
laugh. "And it's good. The zeitgeist is... All I know is, I feel able to
 get on with my own life, it's just a little easier. Things are really 
good right now. I don't know what my intentions were. Your intentions 
are always complicated. On one hand, it's fun to have a big smash and 
you want your music to be powerful and to reach as many people as 
possible. But there's all sorts of different issues, and none of them 
are clear. A big audience may not be your best audience. I don't know. 
How you feel about it can vary any given night. The main thing I was 
concerned with was taking the whole thing down, making it feel more 
human-scaled, less iconic and more about everyday issues, which I 
thought the Tunnel of Love record and my new records dealt with. That's 
basically what it did. <br>
<br>
"Outside of that, your control over the thing has a life and dynamic of 
its own. You have some control over it. But I don't try to exert that 
much. I thought Born in the USA would be a popular record; I didn't 
think it would be the thing it ended up being. That's just what 
happened. I thought Tunnel of Love or these records would be more 
popular, but that's what happened there. Hey, you ride along with it." <br>
<br>
So fame's not so bad? <br>
<br>
"While there's a lot of stress and tension involved, a good part of me 
enjoyed the whole thing. Except for '75 - I was kinda young and pressed 
at the time. But hey, I could have not been on those covers of Time and 
Newsweek if I didn't want to! I didn't have to do those interviews. I 
remember sitting in a room saying, 'Gee, do I want to do this? It seems 
scary.' 'Yeah, but I don't want to be sitting on my porch when I'm 60 
saying, Oh, I shoulda, I coulda, I woulda!' Hey! You got one ride. So I 
said, Let's go!" <br>
<br>
Like giving up your freedom to get married - every time you give up one thing you gain something else. <br>
<br>
"Yeah. I think that I was real protective over my music. Probably too 
much so. The stuff isn't so fragile or precious. But that's how I felt. 
Maybe I was trying to protect myself at times. The world is threatening.
 You can feel that big breath on the back of your neck right before you 
step into those particular decisions. You go, 'Hmm, I think the heat's 
gonna get turned up here.' And it does Part of it can make you 
miserable, but part of you also may just ride with it and go Woooo! 
You're flying by the seat of your pants. So it's sort of both those 
things. It's been a good ride, you know. <br>
<br>
"Like you say, you tend to not have an idea what you're going to get, 
even in painful experience. Some of the best things I learned were 
learned from getting beat up, making mistakes. And if you're afraid to 
do that, to step out and fall, that's living in fear. If you can't take 
the pain you're not going to get to that higher place. My fear of 
failure always held me back in dealing with people and relationships. I 
always stopped right before I committed to the place where if it failed 
it would really hurt. 'I'm okay up to here but there, no.' It wasn't 
until I stepped out into that other place that I realized what the 
stakes were, what the reward where, the pleasures. The past eight years 
have been a tremendous time of learning for me. One of the best times of
 my life. Really difficult but definitely..." Bruce stops and thinks 
about it. "To be sitting here with the kids, patti, my music - it's a 
nice seat." <br>
<br>
Bruce's new albums are full of songs about being set free by having your
 lies exposed - as opposed to Tunnel of Love, were songs like "Two 
Faces" and "Brilliant Disguise" talked about how hard it is to live with
 getting away with lies. <br>
<br>
"Everybody lives with their illusions," Bruce says, drumming his fingers
 on a water glass. "Nobody's who they think they are. Not completely. 
There's a limit to how much you can know yourself. Or all the little 
things we do on a daily basis to live with ourselves. I guess what I've 
found satisfying is that if you try to strip away as much of this stuff 
as you can and find out what you're about - whether it's pretty or ugly 
or what - you do find some sort of freedom. But no matter how much 
you're doing it you feel you're still being cowardly with it. You can 
always push harder. But I think just singing the song is an act of 
self-awareness. Those people in the songs, they know. Whether they do 
something about it, the characters are copping to it. They're saying, 
'This is how I see it, this is what I'm doing.' That's always the step. 
But it's tough." <br>
<br>
Listen to some of the lines on the new albums: "A little sweet talk to 
cover all the lies," "Chippin' away at this chain of my own lies," "I 
had some victory that was just failure in deceit," You get paid and your
 silence passes as honor and all the hatred and dirty little lies are 
written off the books..." <br>
<br>
"Everybody lies in some fashion or another," Bruce says. "Big ones, 
little ones. Really, if I was trying to capture anything on those 
records, it was a sense of a less morally certain universe. Perhaps in 
some of my earlier music - though those ideas are in 'Prove It All 
Night' - people may have felt a greater degree of moral certainty. I 
think it might have been one of the things that attracted people to my 
music. That's obviously not the way the real world is. I guess on these 
records I was interested in trying to paint is as I saw it. With your 
own weaknesses and the places where you fail and get caught up in the 
Big Muddy. I was interested in taking a less heroic stance. I think 
that, despite my protestations over the years in some of my lyrics, 
there was a heroic posture to a lot of the music I created. You try to 
do the right thing, and as you get older you realize how hard it is to 
do the right thing. <br>
<br>
"When you isolate yourself of in the world of music it allows you a 
flexibility and control that the real world just doesn't allow. If you 
step outside that and begin to engage with people, it's gonna get messy.
 Painting the mess was part of what I wanted to do on those records. 
Because that's the way it really is. But that can also be less appealing
 or less compelling for some people. That moral certainty is attractive 
in a world that's so fundamentally confusing. That's why fairy tales are
 popular. That's why so many action movies are big. The first thing 
people want to know when they hear about any conflict is, 'Who's the 
good guy? Who's the bad guy?' Tabloid entertainment, TV news all comes 
down to 'Who's the good guy? Who's the bad guy?' It's rarely as simple 
as that. particularly in 'The Big Muddy', that's what I was tryin' to 
get to: Your moral certainty is a luxury. What passes for 'family 
values' or gets twisted under the umbrella of 'family values' is a 
luxury for a lot of people It's something that a lot of people can't 
afford. 'The Big Muddy' wrestles with that. It's not here, it's not 
there, it's somewhere in the middle and you're down in it." <br>
<br>
As Bruce and I are talking, president Bush's latest surge in the polls 
has collapsed and Bill Clinton is pulling away. Maybe with so many 
Americans financially strapped, the Family Values crusade of the G.O.P. 
is ringing the national bullshit meter. <br>
<br>
"And they know that's what it is!" Bruce nods. "First of all, Bush just 
isn't as good, he can't present it like Reagan presented it. Plus, hey -
 we've heard that last time! And that sounds like bullshit. People are 
really saying, 'Hey - that's BULLSHIT. It's too real out here!' That's 
not gonna work. I really don't think it's gonna work." <br>
<br>
Springsteen sighs. "Most of popular culture is based on childhood fairy 
tales. It just continues. That's what a lot of political discourse 
became. There's a real patronizing aspect to the whole thing. I just 
think people at this point have become fundamentally skeptical and 
cynical - in a good way. The answers are complex. Even though some part 
inside of us yearns for a morally certain world, that world doesn't 
exist. That's not the real world. And at some point you've got to make 
that realization, make your choices, and do the best that you can."</div>

<br>
Rising from the ruins</strong><br>
<br>
September 9 2002<br>
<br>
The Rising . . . Springsteen channels the zeitgeist.<br>
<br>
Sydney Morning Herald <br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen, shattered by the September 11 terrorist attacks, has dug deep to express his pain, Sean Sennett reports.<br>
<br>
Backstage at Washington State's Tacoma Dome, Bruce Springsteen strums a 
few chords and flips through a green notebook littered with notes and 
lyrics. It's two hours until show time, and he is in the middle of a 
46-date US tour with a reconstituted E-Street Band.<br>
<br>
Today, the sight of Springsteen performing in America is like attending a
 revivalist rally. His US No1 album The Rising sees him largely 
reflecting on the events and aftermath of September11.<br>
<br>
A full month after the World Trade Center towers were brought down, 
funerals were being held on a daily basis at the church close to 
Springsteen's New Jersey home. His natural instinct was to pick up a 
guitar. "I wasn't sitting there putting pieces together from a puzzle," 
he says. "I was writing from the inside."<br>
<br>
Deeply affected by the tragedy, Springsteen has never shied away from 
documenting the times in which we live. First came the songs Into The 
Fire and You're Missing: songs that celebrate the life of ordinary 
people and the inexplicable loss generated by extraordinary events.<br>
<br>
Springsteen began by telling the stories of people from his extended 
community, many of whom, as part of his audience, he had shared a 
certain communion with over the past 30 years. Obituaries appeared in 
local newspapers where widows recounted the impact Springsteen had had 
on lost loved ones. In some cases, Springsteen picked up the phone to 
offer support as well as writing songs to celebrate their life. <br>
<br>
"The starting-off place was to probably write as emotionally as I could 
about the feelings that were going on in my community and the country at
 large at the time," he says quietly. "I just took it song by song. The 
natural context I was writing in led me down certain paths. I had a 
30-year history of talking to an audience in maybe a particular way that
 I think may have suited itself to this particular moment in time.<br>
<br>
"[With] Into The Fire and then You're Missing, I felt I had something 
going. These were the concerns I was going to be addressing in some 
fashion, the ideas of loss and a certain shattered spirituality. How do 
those things get put back together? What do those people leave behind? 
What's their contribution to the living, beyond their valour and duty 
served? What are the living left with?<br>
<br>
"With The Rising and My City Of Ruins, what do the ruins leave you with?
 Where's the seed of the next day? Where's the seed of the next life? 
And how does that continue on from the feelings of loss to getting 
people moving again and feeling alive? Those issues were the central 
questions to the record."<br>
<br>
Springsteen heeded the call of his audience. Like most of the world, he 
watched the terrorist attacks on television. A couple of days later he 
drove to a New Jersey bridge to look across the water at where the 
towers once had been. A week later Springsteen was climbing into his car
 when a stranger driving by rolled down the window and yelled "We need 
you!".<br>
<br>
Previous Springsteen records have intimated the ticking of the human 
clock. On The Rising, the artist draws us into a world where there's a 
stillness in the imagery. It's an unconscious technique that adds to the
 emotional clout of the song.<br>
<br>
"I hadn't thought about it until you mentioned it, but I think that was 
part of its emotional drift and purpose when I was writing it. I was 
probably trying to get myself to do the same thing," Springsteen says.<br>
<br>
"[The songs] express a moment of tremendous disorientation. If you've 
experienced those kind of moments, you can feel suspended within them 
until you can get your feet back down and start moving again. It's a 
moment where things feel as if they've just stopped. Reflection, some 
spiritual searching and certainly, if not answers, reasons, are called 
for to help you get moving forward again.<br>
<br>
"The work that the record does is to try and pull you ultimately out of 
that moment and get your feet back on the ground and get you moving."<br>
<br>
The writing on the album has Springsteen using "broad strokes". He has 
described the songs as having "the blues in the verses" and "the gospel 
in the chorus". It's a potent mix. On stage Springsteen seizes the 
moment and, at times, lapses into a fire and brimstone character that 
promises righteous music from the E-Street Band engine room.<br>
<br>
"I'm sticking more to a basic pop form," he admits. "There's hooks and 
choruses and things you just sing along with, because I needed to get 
people engaged.<br>
<br>
"The idea of getting your feet back on the ground means you have to 
engage someone in a variety of different ways. I was interested in 
engaging the audience actively. It wasn't just a listening experience 
this time out. It was standing up and clapping, throwing your arms 
around the person next to you.<br>
<br>
"It was that transcendent emotional ecstasy we try to pull out of the 
audience at night. I see that on people's faces. We're going after that 
effect, we were trying to rawly excite people, just to get their 
adrenaline up and pumping and get them to feel themselves emotionally 
and physically."<br>
<br>
Of course The Rising, which was recorded in Atlanta, Georgia, with 
producer Brendan O'Brien, can be enjoyed on a level other than a direct 
interpretation of feelings and events post September 11.<br>
<br>
"I think I was interested in those general ideas as they tangentially 
applied to not what happened here in the States, but just generally," 
Springsteen says. "You could take The Rising or Into The Fire and put 
them on Darkness On The Edge Of Town [1978]. You could take Promised 
Land off Darkness and put it on this record.<br>
<br>
"For the song to work and have its own inner integrity, I think you have
 to write independently of events. I think you need to be able to play 
the record for somebody who has no idea what the songs refer to, and 
they'll still experience it."<br>
<br>
The Rising is out now on Columbia Records.<br>
<br>
The boss down under<br>
<br>
"We are coming to Australia," Bruce Springsteen confirmed. "I felt bad 
that we didn't get there last time [we toured]. It was kinda the result 
of putting the band back together and trying to reconstitute our 
audience here in the States.<br>
<br>
"I still have three young children, which limits our travelling to some 
degree. We're definitely set up to come in the new year and I know we'll
 be there. I look forward to seeing all my Australian fans. I'm looking 
forward to bringing the band down there again. It'll be very exciting."<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band will tour Australia in early 2003.<br>

<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band<br>
Sydney Morning Herald , 2003-03-24<br>
By Bernard Zuel<br>
<br>
Somebody got greedy, so we had to pay. </strong><br>
<br>
There's a degree of contempt in any decision to stage an outdoor 
concert. No matter how it's dressed up, the bottom line is the bottom 
line came first, not the fans, not the music. You simply can't have the 
best sound, the best sightlines or the best atmosphere in an outdoor 
stadium or racetrack. But you certainly can make the most money in the 
shortest possible time. <br>
<br>
It matters less then that people 500 metres or more from the stage can 
only see tiny figures and must spend their time watching the action on 
screens; that they may have disconcerting echo bouncing off the stands; 
that they have to hope that winds don't blow the sound away before it 
gets to them. <br>
<br>
Normally the person blamed for this situation is the promoter. But in 
many cases, as I suspect it is with Bruce Springsteen's tour, the 
promoter is had over a barrel by the artist's management who demand so 
much money that the only chance to make a profit or avoid a loss is to 
bung on one big outdoor concert. <br>
<br>
Sometimes, as with U2, you can get away with it, just. Other times, as with this Springsteen concert, you fail miserably. <br>
<br>
Unbelievably for a production and act of this level, the sound failed 
four times within the first hour. It was poor organisation and 
frustrating for both band and fans, particularly as each time the power 
went out it was just as the songs were shifting up a gear. But as Badly 
Drawn Boy can attest, bad things happen and equipment failure can work 
under Murphy's Law no matter who you are. <br>
<br>
What can't be forgiven, though, was the woefully inadequate sound 
provided for the bulk of the audience who weren't in the high 
ticket-price seats near the stage. At the back of the ground it was 
thin, wafty and inconsistent, draining the songs of a lot of their 
power, physical and emotional. <br>
<br>
You're supposed to feel an E Street Band show but the best way to 
describe what we could hear at the SCG is to imagine you put on a CD at 
home but instead of it coming through your expensive stereo speakers, it
 comes out your television's tinny ones. <br>
<br>
The guitars, bass and backing vocals were absent from the mix pretty 
much the whole night. Springsteen's vocals often dropped by half, 
rousing songs such as Badlands, Mary's Place, Born to Run and Rosalita 
were limp, and intense, quieter songs such as Empty Sky, You're Missing 
and Into the Fire sounded like they would be special but didn't have the
 sonic presence to fill the space. <br>
<br>
These failures weren't because the songs were being played poorly. As 
much as could be told from up the back, the band seemed in fine form, 
particularly on the live arrangements of songs from the recent album The
 Rising. And not because the song selection didn't work. This was a set 
list for diehards (throwing in Darlington County, Out in the Streets and
 Darkness on the Edge of Town thrilled) as well as casual fans (who got 
their dose of Dancing in the Dark and Glory Days). The failures were 
because no one, it seems, paid attention to what would have been best 
for the audience. <br>
<br>
I have to confess that this hasn't been an objective review. I didn't go
 as an impartial observer curious to see how this would work. Like most 
people there I went as a fan, excited by the prospect of seeing one of 
the great rock performers, the writer of some of the finest songs in 
contemporary popular music, put on the kind of show I've only read about
 or heard two steps removed on CD or television. <br>
<br>
Instead I left depressed and angry, wondering would it have hurt 
Springsteen, his management, the promoter, anyone, if they had played 
maybe two shows, to roughly the same number of paying customers, at the 
Superdome? It was good enough even for the Rolling Stones, a group not 
known for forging money, who could have filled the SCG if they had 
chosen. <br>
<br>
Judging by the reactions of those in front of the stage there was a 
good, maybe even great show going on last night. Somewhere. Just not 
where most of the people who paid to see it were.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Robert Hilburn : Bruce Springsteen Picks Actress As 'Mrs. Boss'<br>
<br>
May 11, 1985</strong><br>
<br>
". . . a time comes when two people should think of these things.<br>
<br>
Having a home and a family, Facing up to their responsibilities."<br>
<br>
--Bruce Springsteen's "I Wanna Marry You," 1980.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen's wedding plans gave the rock 'n' roll world this week
 one of its hottest pieces of gossip since the "Paul Is Dead" rumors in 
the '60s. Only this time, the reports turned out to be true.<br>
<br>
The uproar began Thursday when a Portland, Ore., radio station announced
 that the 35-year-old-Springsteen--who once said he couldn't picture 
ever getting married--would wed Julianne Phillips, a 25-year-old model 
and actress, in a Portland suburb, possibly that afternoon.<br>
<br>
Almost immediately, female Springsteen fans began calling rock radio 
stations demanding to know, "Is there really going to be a \o7 Mrs. 
Boss?\f7 "<br>
<br>
Most of the calls were good natured, but some were a tad hysterical.<br>
<br>
By evening, the rock star's fans had their answer: Phillips' parents had
 confirmed in Portland that the wedding would take place, probably next 
week.<br>
<br>
But what about Bruce's family?<br>
<br>
"Yes, it's true," a member of Springsteen's immediate family confirmed 
Friday. Though she asked not to be identified, the relative added, 
"We're all thrilled. She's just a wonderful girl."<br>
<br>
The couple apparently broke the news to friends over the weekend at a 
small dinner party Bruce gave for his mother, Adele, at a Los Angeles 
restaurant. The occasion celebrated both Adele's birthday, which was 
Saturday, and Julianne's, which was Monday. The ceremony is expected to 
take place in a Catholic church.<br>
<br>
Neither Springsteen nor Phillips was available for comment Friday, but 
Springsteen's friends had known for weeks that the romance--which began 
when the couple met backstage during the rock star's appearances last 
October at the Los Angeles Sports Arena--was \o7 very \f7 serious. There
 had even been engagement rumors.<br>
<br>
But what about Springsteen's suggestions a decade ago that marriage just "isn't for me?"<br>
<br>
In a 1975 interview with the British pop publication Melody Maker, 
Springsteen suggested that all his energy was devoted to his work and 
that a family was simply out of the question. "I couldn't bring up 
kids," he said. "I couldn't handle it . . . . A kid--like you better be 
ready for them. I'm so far out of line that it would be disastrous. I 
just don't see why people get married. "<br>
<br>
However, when I talked to him in January, Springsteen indicated a far 
different attitude about marriage and family. In his dressing room after
 a concert in Greensboro, N.C., he acknowledged that he sensed something
 missing in his life. A friend from one of Springsteen's early bands, 
Steel Mill, had joined him on stage that night, and Bruce mentioned how 
the friend had a wife and three children, and how much they meant to 
him.<br>
<br>
Asked if he felt the need for a permanent relationship, Springsteen 
said: "Everybody feels (that need) all the time. I guess relationships 
have been (hard for me ) just because I've traveled for my whole adult 
life, and it was difficult to settle into something and make those types
 of sacrifices."<br>
<br>
Then, he added: "(But) I think you can make anything happen. That's my 
approach. To blame something on your job is an excuse, no matter what it
 is. It can be difficult, no doubt about it. But in the end, you do what
 you want to do. That's what I basically believe. All the rest is 
excuses."<br>
<br>
People who work with Springsteen also have noted how the rock star--for 
years a notorious loner--seemed to be opening up more in recent months.<br>
<br>
"Everything about him tells me he's happier now than at any time since I
 met him (a decade ago)," a close friend said a few weeks ago.<br>
<br>
Springsteen, who has a house in Los Angeles as well in his native New 
Jersey, just finished an Australian tour with his E Street Band and is 
due next month to begin a lengthy European series of dates. It may be 
known as the Honeymoon Tour because Phillips, who has appeared in a .38 
Special video and two TV movies ("Summer Fantasy" and "His Mistress"), 
is expected to join him on the dates.<br>
<br>
Added good news for Springsteen: Columbia Records has just announced 
that his "Born in the U.S.A." album is the biggest domestic seller in 
the label's history. Sales through April: 6.5 million.</div>

Greg Smith 1998<br>
<br>
________________________________________________________________________<br>

 <br>
<br>
"Is a dream a lie if it don't come true, or is it something worse ...".<br>
<br>
â€“Bruce Springsteen, "The River".<br>
<br>
AS THE SHIFT in literary criticism from "traditional/canonical" to the 
broader arena of "cultural/popular" studies becomes ever more pronounced
 (thankfully eradicating, in the process, many of the arbitrary and 
elitist prejudices separating "high" from "low" art), scholars are 
discovering not only that "literary" and "popular" texts often share the
 same social and psychological concerns, but also that in dealing with 
such concerns many of these "popular" texts are equally compelling, 
sensitive, and exciting. Walt Whitman, with his well-known poetic 
emphasis on and desire to be considered the bard of the American working
 people, would seem to lend himself nicely as the starting point for a 
study of this sort, particularly one connecting Whitman's fairly 
idealized and antiquated vision of the American working people with 
contemporary reflections on the reality of working-class life in a 
popular culture medium which the American working class itself 
engendered: rock and roll. Although in terms of subject matter rock 
music has obviously expanded far beyond its working-class origins since 
the early 1950s, it could be argued that the most vital and authentic 
American performers in the genre draw heavily on â€“ and in most cases are
 indeed descendant from â€“ these social roots. Of the numerous rock 
artists who can stake such a claim, Bruce Springsteen is without 
question the foremost purveyor of American working-class rock and roll. 
While he is often mistakenly stereotyped as a sentimental and patriotic 
blue-collar hero (such as he was not only by Ronald Reagan in a 
particularly disturbing 1984 campaign speech, but also by conservative 
journalist George Will in a New York Daily News column with the 
unforgivably jingoistic title of "A Yankee-Doodle Springsteen"), 
Springsteen is actually the working-class rock poet supreme, laying out 
in uncompromising terms and detail the shattered lives and broken 
countenances that make up the dark side of American existence as it is 
experienced by working people for whom the American Dream is a taunting,
 cruel, and ungraspable abstraction. Clearly, the people who populate 
Springsteen's songs are not the jolly and rugged tradesmen so often 
found in Whitman's poetry. Nonetheless, Springsteen is not just a 
cynical contemporary crank bitterly refuting the vision of working class
 America proffered by an idealistic poet over a hundred years ago. 
Whitman envisioned the American working class of the future having a 
better existence than those of his own day, and Springsteen is strongly 
concerned with improving the lives of contemporary American workers, as 
both his songwriting and consistent acts of charity demonstrate. 
Certainly Bruce Springsteen would have no qualms with Whitman's 
aspirations for the American working class, but he would likely point 
out that the romanticizing of their lot is perhaps not the best way to 
go about achieving such aspirations.<br>
<br>
To speculate whether or not Whitman would have liked an aspect of 
popular culture such as rock and roll might appear somewhat farcical, 
but to assume that he would have respected its ability to reach the vast
 audiences that he himself desired but failed to reach during his own 
lifetime does not seem presumptuous. It also does not seem presumptuous 
to assume that Whitman would have respected its origins as a decidedly 
working-class form of expression, although it is true that he probably 
would not have cared for the unpleasant social realities often reflected
 in this music of the American working class; it should be remembered 
that Whitman was wont to envision the future "masses generally and to 
pin his hopes for their proper education upon literature" (Clark, 138). 
Despite the fact that in "A Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads" (1889) 
Whitman proudly claimed that " w ithout yielding an inch the working-man
 and working-woman were to be in my pages from first to last," and for 
all of the heartfelt romanticizing of the American working class 
throughout his work, Whitman felt that what he referred to as the 
"democratic average" had not been achieved among the working masses in 
his time and would have to be a goal for the future, helped along by a 
guide in the form of the "divine literatus." In other words, Whitman 
foresaw a future America resting on the shoulders of a profoundly 
educated, literary, and satisfied working class. According to Ezra 
Greenspan, however, Whitman's romantic vision of the working class and 
its future was beginning to be compromised even toward the end of 
Whitman's life:.<br>
<br>
The problem with this otherwise perfectly enchanting vision of a nation 
of individual workers, each one singing his or her song of contentment, 
is that, even as an ideal, it belongs to a bygone world of small, 
independent mechanics, craftsmen, and farmers. That world ... was being 
bypassed by the age of mass production and modern technology. Rather 
than singing Whitman's song of self-contentment and self-help, American 
workingmen in the period following the Civil War would increasingly be 
given to chanting the slogans of emergent unions, a movement, 
significantly, with which Whitman had little sympathy. (216).<br>
<br>
Given Whitman's love of and hope for peaceful unity among all American 
people, his lack of support for the developing labor movement is hardly 
surprising, especially considering the conflict between workers and 
management that Whitman surely knew would result. That Whitman had a 
genuine affection for and vested interest in the working people of 
America should not be disputed, as evidence to the contrary permeates 
his work. What qualifies this affection and interest on Whitman's part 
somewhat from a contemporary perspective that is sympathetic with the 
often unpleasant realities of working-class existence is his tendency to
 romanticize the actual condition of being a working person. This may be
 due to the fact that usually in Whitman's poetry, the working people 
are presented through Whitman's eyes as representatives of the 
democratic ideal he cherished, so that in effect they are more symbols 
of his romantic vision of America than they are reflections of real 
working people. As Greenspan has noted, Whitman's working people seem "a
 perfectly enchanting vision of a nation of individual workers," and 
while they are powerful and poignant because they constitute an integral
 part of a stirring poetic treatise in defense and support of American 
democratic ideals, as symbols of those ideals, they are also subservient
 to the resultant vision (216). In other words, the working people in 
Whitman's writings do not exist in contrast to the vision of democratic 
unity they symbolize â€“ while we are sure to be presented in Leaves of 
Grass with hearty, satisfied "joes" who share a meal around a campfire 
with the poet, we are less likely to encounter disgruntled, weary, and 
underpaid stiffs.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the best example of Whitman's working people occurs in his poem 
"I Hear America Singing." Although the poem is straightforward enough 
that it requires little, if any, explication, it is worth reproducing 
here in its entirety both as a succinct representation of Whitman's 
romanticized vision and a beginning reference point from which to 
consider Springsteen's lyrics:.<br>
<br>
I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear,<br>
Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong,<br>
The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,<br>
The mason singing as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work,<br>
The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deckhand singing on the steamboat deck<br>
The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing as he stands,<br>
The wood-cutter's song, the ploughboy's on his way in the morning, or at noon intermission or at sundown,<br>
The delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work, or of the girl sewing or washing,<br>
Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else,<br>
The day what belongs to the day â€“ at night the party of young fellows, robust, friendly,<br>
Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs.<br>
<br>
As evocative and picturesque an image of the working class as this may 
be, it finally does not ring true; to readers familiar with the plight 
of the contemporary American working class, in fact, the workers in "I 
Hear America Singing" may seem suspiciously placid, as if they had just 
stepped into the poem from a Norman Rockwell painting on an adjoining 
page. Where is the fatigue? Where is the stress? Where are the bosses? 
Where are the insubstantial wages? In short, where is the reality? Even 
given that the projection of contemporary labor concerns onto a poem 
originally penned in 1860 is anachronistic, it seems difficult to 
believe that the working people of Whitman's time were as carefree and 
contented as those in "I Hear America Singing." Nonetheless, Whitman 
believed in the power of his working-class vision, and his failure to 
adequately portray the reality of the people and conditions it arose 
from is ultimately less important to his art, it would seem, than his 
conviction that the reality and the vision might someday be one and the 
same.<br>
<br>
Regardless of whether or not Whitman was overtly romanticizing the 
workers of his own day, he did have faith that the working class would 
evince his ideals in the future, and whatever songs Whitman might have 
imagined issuing forth from America's laborers some decades down the 
road, it is certain that he would not have envisioned the type of songs 
written by Bruce Springsteen. One major variable which Whitman failed to
 foresee in relation to his future vision was that concerning the 
enormous and far-reaching effect which the industrialization of America 
would have upon its working class. In the wake of industrialization, 
with its countless array of factories, mines, and mills, Whitman's 
vision of an America brimming with happily pastoral working people would
 amount less to the American Dream than to a pipe dream. Somewhat 
ironically, it is the familiar notion of the American Dream (so much 
like Whitman's future vision) with its promises of prosperity, equality,
 and mobility for all, which haunts the working people who populate 
Springsteen's music. In Springsteen's songs, the stark realism of 
contemporary American working-class life is presented as a powerful 
reminder that the idealism surrounding this notion of the American dream
 is often just that--an inspirational concept of the way things should 
be, but by no means an accurate reflection of the way they are. Indeed, 
Springsteen's songs are frequently centered around the ironic 
discrepancy between what the American Dream offers in theory and what 
actual working people often get in reality. As such, the Cadillac which 
greets the working man "when his day is done" in "Cadillac Ranch" from 
The River (1980) is not only a luxury car the speaker longs to own, but a
 luxury car, he hints to his friend, that he knows he and his family 
will probably "own" only in death as their hearse:<br>
<br>
There she sits, buddy, just a-gleaming in the sun<br>
There to greet a working man when his day is done<br>
I'm gonna pack my pa and I'm gonna pack my aunt,<br>
Gonna take em down to the Cadillac Ranch<br>
Eldorado fins, buddy, whitewalls and skirts;<br>
Rides just like a little bit of heaven here on Earth<br>
Well, buddy, when I die, throw my body in the back,<br>
And drive me to the junkyard in my Cadillac <br>
Cadillac, Cadillac, long and dark, shiny and black ...<br>
<br>
Although not Springsteen's most sophisticated lyrical accomplishment 
dealing with the discrepancy between the American Dream as ideal and the
 reality of working class America, the rollicking "Cadillac Ranch" 
nonetheless serves as a fine encapsulation of this theme, which 
Springsteen develops elsewhere in his songwriting with greater 
complexity, political impact, and a poignancy drawn from his own 
personal background.<br>
<br>
Born and raised in Freehold, New Jersey, a small and poverty-stricken 
industrial town not far northeast of Whitman's own final resting place 
in Camden, Springsteen witnessed firsthand the unpleasant reality of 
contemporary working-class America, from the dead-end factory jobs and 
shutdowns, to the disproportionate governmental sapping of the working 
class for soldiers to conduct the Vietnam conflict. Although his first 
two recordings â€“ the Dylanesque pair Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J. 
(1973) and The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle (1974) â€“ 
deal peripherally with such issues, it was with his landmark third album
 Born to Run in 1975 that Springsteen began his exclusive thematic focus
 on American working people. Prominent English music critic Simon Frith 
offers perhaps the best synopsis of how this focus informs and enriches 
Springsteen's music:<br>
<br>
The point of his autobiographical anecdotes is not to reveal himself but
 to root his music in material conditions. Like artists in other media 
(fiction, film) Springsteen is concerned to give emotions (the essential
 data of rock and roll) a narrative setting, to situate them in time and
 place, to relate them to the situations they explain or confuse. He's 
not interested in abstract emotions, in vague sensation or even in 
moralizing. He is, to put it simply, a story-teller, and in straining to
 make his stories credible he uses classic techniques. Reality is 
registered by conventions first formulated by the nineteenth-century 
naturalists--a refusal to sentimentalize social conditions, a compulsion
 to sentimentalize human nature.<br>
Springsteen's songs (like Zola's fictions) are almost exclusively 
concerned with the working class, with the effects of poverty and 
uncertainty, the consequences of weakness and crime; they trawl through 
the murky reality of the American Dream; they contrast utopian impulses 
with people's lack of opportunity to do much more than get by.... 
Springsteen's protagonists, victims and criminals, defeated and enraged,
 are<br>
treated tenderly, their hopes honoured, their failure determined by circumstance. (98-99).<br>
<br>
That Springsteen does not (as Frith points out) moralize in his 
songwriting is a testament to the quality of his work--as do those 
writers considered by academics to be the great American naturalists 
(Crane, Norris, Dreiser, et al), Springsteen deals repeatedly with 
themes that reflect complex social and political realities. Like the 
naturalists, Springsteen presents in his songs the unpleasant 
circumstances which often complicate the lives of working class people, 
and he does so in a way that grants integrity to these people without 
passing judgment on them. Because the characters who populate his songs 
are not of the impossibly romantic "noble savage" stereotype often found
 in much working-class rock and country music (a stereotype quite 
reminiscent of Whitman's workers in some ways), and because he invests 
his characters with a basic humanity that this more familiar stereotype 
necessarily eschews, Springsteen is able to connect the lives of these 
characters to the lives of listeners for whom such a class-conscious 
stereotype would otherwise prove a boundary. "You can't tell people how 
to think," Springsteen has said, commenting on the ineffectualness of 
smarmy moralizing, but "you can show them something by saying 'Put these
 shoes on, walk in these shoes. People then recognize themselves in 
characters whose lives on the surface seem to have no relation to 
theirs" (Gunderson, 16d). For the past twenty years, from 1975's Born to
 Run to 1995's The Ghost of Tom Joad, Springsteen has done this more 
successfully and consistently than any other artist in rock (or very 
possibly any artist at all, for that matter), in the process revealing 
an American working class that Whitman had not considered or foreseen.<br>
<br>
The opening lines of the Born to Run title track can be seen as the 
thematic umbrella under which the majority of Springsteen's subsequent 
work rests:<br>
<br>
In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American Dream,<br>
And at night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines.<br>
<br>
This is nothing less than a summation of the circumstances facing 
working people in all of Springsteen's music; taunted by promises of an 
American Dream which is out of reach but which they still must chase by 
way of day jobs out of economic and sometimes psychological necessity, 
these people are left to fantasize at night in cars and on roads that go
 nowhere. As such, the idea of getting out is important to Springsteen's
 character; in the ironically titled "The Promised Land" from Darkness 
on the Edge of Town (1978), the speaker utters a less grandiose version 
of the above couplet: "Working all day in my daddy's garage / Driving 
all night, chasing some mirage." It is often the idea, "mirage" though 
it may be, that they will somehow be able to escape their dead-end jobs 
that allows Springsteen's characters, sadly and paradoxically, to 
continue working at them. Even characters in Springsteen's songs who act
 on the impulse to get out don't really make it, as can be seen from the
 beautiful "Thunder Road" (Born to Run) and its equally striking 
companion piece, the title track from The River. In the first lyric, a 
disillusioned but still hopeful male speaker is attempting to persuade 
his friend Mary to start a romance with him, the most attractive part of
 his offer being the promise to take her out of town in search of 
brighter horizons: "Well, now, I'm no hero, that's understood / All the 
redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood." Although the 
speaker's monologue never reveals Mary's response to his offer, "Thunder
 Road" ends on a seemingly optimistic note:<br>
<br>
There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away<br>
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets<br>
They scream your name at night in the street<br>
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet<br>
And in the lonely cool before dawn, you hear their engines roaring on<br>
But when you get to the porch they're gone on the wind<br>
So, Mary, climb in; it's a town of losers and I'm pulling out of here to win.<br>
<br>
Five years later, however, we encounter this same speaker in "The 
River," now involved in a failed marriage with Mary, laid-off from his 
union job, presumably still living in the same town he and Mary grew up 
in. The concluding verse of "The River" is a stark contrast to its 
counterpart from "Thunder Road":<br>
<br>
I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company<br>
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy<br>
All those things that seemed so important, well mister, they vanished right into the air<br>
Now I just act like I don't remember, and Mary acts like she don't care<br>
But I remember us riding in my brother's car, her body tan and wet down at the reservoir<br>
At night on them banks I'd lie awake and pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take<br>
Now those memories come back to haunt me, they haunt me like a curse<br>
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true, or is it something worse<br>
That sends me down to the river, though I know the river is dry,<br>
That sends me down to the river tonight?<br>
<br>
In these two songs, the runaway American Dream and the suicide machines 
from "Born to Run" become literally manifested. The car which the 
speaker presents as his own in "Thunder Road" and promises to take Mary 
away in turns out to be his brother's, a "suicide machine" in the sense 
that it leads him not to romantic salvation with Mary somewhere else but
 instead to a bad marriage and a worthless job â€“ and these two things 
together constitute the antithesis of the American Dream, the "lie" 
which leaves the speaker hinting, the final verse of "The River," at 
suicide.<br>
<br>
Just as Whitman had to deal with the impact of the Civil War on his 
America, Springsteen has had to deal with the impact of Vietnam on his. 
The most notable instance of this concern in Springsteen's repertoire is
 probably the title track from his now infamous 1984 album Born in the 
U.S.A. An out-of-work veteran whose name, significantly, is never 
revealed to the listener, the speaker in "Born in the U.S.A." traces 
with powerful brevity his life experience as a working class conscript, 
cramming the whole desolate narrative into four verses that indict his 
country for failing to help him when he returns home after being 
forcibly sent to serve its own questionable interests in Vietnam:.<br>
<br>
Born down in a dead man's town,<br>
the first kick I took was when I hit the ground<br>
End up like a dog that's been beat too much,<br>
till you spend half your life just covering up<br>
Born in the U.S.A.,<br>
I was born in the U.S.A.<br>
<br>
Got in a little hometown jam, so they put a rifle in my hand<br>
Sent me off to a foreign land, to go and<br>
kill the yellow man<br>
Born in the U.S.A.,<br>
I was born in the U.S.A.<br>
<br>
Come back home to the refinery,<br>
hiring man says, "So, if it was up to me ..."<br>
Went down to see my V.A. man, he says,<br>
"Son, don't you understand, now?"<br>
I had a brother at Khe-Sahn,<br>
fighting off the Viet Cong;<br>
they're still there, but he's all gone<br>
<br>
He had a woman he loved in Saigon,<br>
I've got a picture of him in her arms, now<br>
Down in the shadows of the penitentiary, <br>
out by the gas fires of the refinery,<br>
I'm ten years burning down the road,<br>
nowhere to run, ain't got no-where to go<br>
Born in the U.S.A.,<br>
I'm a long-gone daddy in the U.S.A.<br>
<br>
The most popular Vietnam protest song ever written, it is interesting to
 note that "Born in the U.S.A.," recorded roughly ten years after the 
end of the war, was widely misinterpreted as patriotic rock and roll 
sloganeering. Hearing only the repeated line "Born in the U.S.A." and 
not, as renowned rock critic Greil Marcus points out, the "furious 
irony" the refrain carries within the context of the song's entire 
lyrical structure (270), audiences and politicians caught up in the 
rampant neo-conservatism of the Reagan era were quick to herald 
Springsteen as the archetypal working class stiff who had make it big, 
and he became an unwitting poster child for the very notion of the 
American Dream he had been trying to dispel. In a November, 1984 article
 in Artforum, two months after incumbent presidential candidate Ronald 
Reagan had shamelessly appropriated Springsteen's publicly 
misinterpreted image during a campaign speech in New Jersey, Marcus made
 a plea for "Born in the U.S.A." to be recognized for what it was:<br>
<br>
The song is about the refusal of the country to treat Vietnam veterans 
as something more than nonunion workers in an enterprise conducted off 
the books. It is about the debt the country owes to those who suffered 
the violation of the principles on which the country was founded, and by
 which it has justified itself ever since. (Ranters, 270).<br>
<br>
Politicians on the right and rock critics on the left may have been 
battling it out over what his song's message was (and if one had 
actually read the lyrics, it is hard to see how there could be much 
doubt), but Springsteen had three years earlier given a benefit concert 
in Los Angeles to support the Vietnam Veterans of America, an 
organization which was on the verge of going under because the Reagan 
administration refused to either fund or officially recognize it. The 
full proceeds from this show enabled the organization to survive and 
garner lobbying status, prompting Bobby Muller, head of the V.V.A., to 
claim that " w ithout Bruce Springsteen, there would be no Vietnam 
veterans movement" (Marsh, 66-75). Springsteen himself failed his draft 
physical (a fortunate happenstance that he implores audiences not to 
applaud about when he mentions it during live performances), but he 
witnessed nonetheless the effects of the Vietnam draft on blue-collar 
Freehold: "The drummer I had then, Bart Haynes, and this fellow Walter, 
they both died in Vietnam when we were in our teens ... I can still see 
them in their uniforms. Those are very powerful images. The factories. 
It still finds its way into my work" (Schoemer, 68).<br>
<br>
While Springsteen often deals with the experiences of working-class 
American men in his songs, he does not deal with men on an exclusive 
basis, and his exceptionally honest and sensitive depictions of 
working-class women have drawn praise from critics as diverse as 
political scientist Ray Pratt and Emily Dickinson scholar Martha Nell 
Smith. Unlike Whitman, who is known for romanticizing American working 
women primarily as mothers from whom the next generation of robust 
American working men will issue forth, Springsteen depicts women who 
face problems that are equally difficult and unsettling as those faced 
by their male counterparts in other songs. "Spare Parts," from 1987's 
Tunnel of Love, is perhaps the best example of this facet of 
Springsteen's work:<br>
<br>
Bobby said he'd pull out, Bobby stayed in;<br>
Janey had a baby, it wasn't any sin<br>
They were set to marry on a summer day, but Bobby got scared and he ran away<br>
Jane moved in with her ma on Shawnee Lake;<br>
she sighed, "Ma, some- times my whole life feels like one big mistake."<br>
She settled in a back room, time passed on; later that winter a son came along<br>
<br>
Spare parts and broken hearts<br>
keep the world turning around<br>
<br>
Now Janey walked that baby across the floor night after night<br>
But she was a young girl and she missed the party lights<br>
Meanwhile, in south Texas, in a dirty oil patch<br>
Bobby heard about a son being born and swore he wasn't ever going back<br>
<br>
Spare parts and broken hearts <br>
keep the world turning around.<br>
<br>
Janey heard about a woman over in Calverton who<br>
Put her baby in the river, let the river roll on<br>
She looked at her boy in the crib where he lay,<br>
Got down on her knees, cried till she prayed<br>
Mist was on the water, low run the tide<br>
Janey held her son down at the riverside<br>
Waist-deep in the water, how bright the sun shone<br>
She lifted him in her arms and carried him home<br>
<br>
As he lay sleeping in her bed, Janey took a look around at everything,<br>
Went to a drawer in her bureau and got out her old engagement ring<br>
Took out her wedding dress, tied that ring up in its sash,<br>
Went straight down to the pawn shop, man,<br>
and walked out with some good cold cash<br>
<br>
Spare parts and broken hearts <br>
keep the world turning around.<br>
<br>
Here we have a refreshing depiction of a woman in a contemporary song, 
particularly one written by a male rock star. Deserted by her worthless 
boyfriend during pregnancy, Janey makes the difficult but inspiring 
choice to fend for herself and her son, which she begins to do, 
symbolically enough, by hocking her engagement ring. Prior to making 
this decision Janey contemplates drowning her son in the river, an 
"easy" way out not unlike that which Bobby has chosen. Instead, however,
 she chooses to trade her broken romantic dreams in for "some good cold 
cash," an entity both more practical and reliable. Martha Neel Smith 
elaborates:<br>
<br>
Springsteen's woman rises above the romance surrounding the anguish of a
 woman victimized by male irresponsibility and broken promises, and thus
 rises above a plot that ends with a rescuing knight in his shining 
limousine or the woman in utter ruin. Janey sells the symbols of 
romantic promises so she can deal competently with the material facts of
 life. Departing from the standard for popular culture storytelling and 
sounding much more like a woman writer and revisionist mythmaker, 
Springsteen writes beyond the ending of patriarchal resolution. (844).<br>
<br>
As with the couple from "Thunder Road" and "The River," Janey learns 
that following the glittering promise of romance is akin to following 
the glossy promise of the American Dream, and that, like the deceptively
 open and enticing stretches of road which beckon Springsteen's 
characters in other songs, these two promises lead nowhere. In a society
 when grandiose romantic notions of love and success are frequently 
interrelated and showcased as models after which to strive, Janey learns
 that just surviving is the most difficult and honorable thing she can 
do. An avid vocal and monetary supporter of organizations for both 
single mothers and battered women, Springsteen realizes that Janey is 
not simply a dramatic fiction, but a working symbol for the all-too-real
 plight of numerous American women.<br>
<br>
In Springsteen's songs, however, even the "just surviving" evidenced by 
Janey is categorically stripped of any romantic associations. His 
characters survive not in order to be held aloft as awe-inspiring 
examples of gritty pioneer spirit who have managed to eek out existences
 against all odds, but simply because, if they're not willing to court 
suicide (as does the speaker from "The River") or murder (an option 
rejected by Janey in "Spare Parts" but acted on by the Charlie 
Stark-weather-like speaker in 1982's harrowing "Nebraska") they have to.
 The notion of America as "the land of opportunity" is a familiar enough
 rhetorical pat on the back in our country, and while it is certainly 
true to a degree, it is not absolutely true. Springsteen knows this, and
 while he doesn't denounce notions of America as "the land of 
opportunity" as entirely false, he does hold that a general and 
rhetorical application of such notions to the public at large is 
dangerous, as he pointed out in 1984:<br>
<br>
People want to forget. There was Vietnam, there was Watergate, there was
 Iran--we were beaten, we were hustled, and then we were humiliated.... 
People got a need to feel good about the country they live in. But 
what's happening, I think, is that that need--which is a good thing--is 
getting manipulated and exploited. And you see the Reagan reelection ads
 on TV â€“ you know: "It's morning in America." And you say, "Well, it's 
not morning in Pittsburgh. It's not morning above 125th Street in New 
York. It's midnight, and, like, there's a bad moon rising." (Pratt, 
191).<br>
<br>
In other words, Springsteen recognizes that unquestioning public 
adherence to the "truth" of chord-striking patriotic phrases like "the 
land of opportunity" and "the American Dream" serves as a convenient way
 for America at large to deny the problems of its working class. By 
1995, Springsteen had become so concerned with getting his message to 
the contrary out that he released the Steinbeck-influenced album The 
Ghost of Tom Joad, an acoustic recording for which he toured with just a
 guitar and a harmonica. Upon taking the stage for each of this tour's 
shows, Springsteen sternly counciled the audience not to make any noise 
while the songs were being performed so that they would hear and 
understand his lyrics (Schoemer, 66). The Joad album, performed nearly 
in its entirety each night of the tour, deals more closely and complexly
 with the American working-class themes Springsteen has cultivated since
 Born to Run. The album's title track provides a chilling summation of 
these themes in the wake of the Bush administration:<br>
<br>
Man walking 'long the railroad tracks<br>
Going someplace and there's no going back<br>
Highway patrol choppers coming up over the ridge<br>
Hot soup on a campfire under the bridge<br>
Shelter line stretching around the corner<br>
Welcome to the "new world order"<br>
Families sleeping in their cars in the Southwest<br>
No home, no job, no peace, no rest<br>
<br>
The highway is alive tonight,<br>
but nobody's kidding nobody about where it goes<br>
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light<br>
searching for the ghost of Tom Joad<br>
<br>
He pulls a prayer book out of his sleeping bag,<br>
The preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag<br>
Waiting for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last<br>
In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass<br>
Got a one-way ticket to the promised land<br>
You got a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand<br>
Sleeping on a pillow of solid rock,<br>
Bathing in the city aqueduct<br>
<br>
The highway is alive tonight,<br>
but where it's headed everybody knows<br>
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light<br>
waiting on the ghost of Tom Joad<br>
<br>
Now Tom said, <br>
"Mom, wherever there's a cop beating a guy,<br>
Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries,<br>
Where there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air,<br>
Look for me, Mom, I'll be there.<br>
Wherever there's somebody fighting for a place to stand,<br>
Or a decent job or a helping hand<br>
Wherever somebody's struggling to be free,<br>
Look in their eyes, Mom, you'll see me."<br>
<br>
Well, the highway is alive tonight, <br>
but nobody's kidding nobody about where it goes<br>
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light <br>
with the ghost of old Tom Joad.<br>
<br>
With this, the promising image of the living American highway is 
blatantly undercut and emptied out by the knowledge that "nobody's 
kidding nobody about where it goes" anymore, as the protagonist in 
"Thunder Road" had done once long ago. Springsteen effectively evokes 
the Tom Joad character from Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath here for a 
couple of reasons: first, Tom Joad is a widely recognized working-class 
archetype from American liternature; and second, the working-class 
dilemmas faced by Tom Joad and his family within the Depression-era 
context of Steinbeck's novel haunt contemporary working-class America 
not only as a ghost from our fiction, but a ghost from our actual past. 
Just as there were homeless people and families searching unsuccessfully
 for work in Depression-era America, so there are now as well. Our 
country has come a long way in a lot of areas, Springsteen seems to be 
saying in this lyric, but some things have not progressed much at all. 
The unemployed Ohio steel worker of "Youngstown," also from Joad, echoes
 this sentiment more directly, contrasting his mill's production output 
with management's glib explanation for shutting it down: "Seven hundred 
tons of metal a day, now sir you tell me the world's changed / Once I 
made you rich enough, rich enough to forget my name." Similar cynical 
proclamations issue forth from characters throughout The Ghost of Tom 
Joad, from the Spanish migrant worker brothers of "Sinaloa Cowboys" who 
turn to dealing methamphetamine because they "could spend a year in the 
orchard / Or make half as much in one ten-hour shift," to the small-town
 New Mexico stripper of "Dry Lightning," who chillingly declares that 
"nobody can give nobody what they really need, anyway." In "My Best was 
Never Good Enough," the album's final song, Springsteen takes bitter jab
 at Forrest Gump, the latest "land of opportunity" and "American Dream" 
blockbuster propaganda film to waltz out of Hollywood under the guise of
 a "triumph of the (American) human spirit" tour de force: "'Now life's 
like a box of chocolates, you never know what your going to get / Stupid
 is as stupid does and all the rest of that shit...." This continuous 
romanticizing of both the American Dream and the opportunities available
 to American working people, Springsteen suggests strongly in Tom Joad, 
is part of a cycle by which our past continues to haunt us.<br>
<br>
To lay the blame for these romanticized conceptions at the feet of Walt 
Whitman would be ridiculous, of course, and that is certainly not my 
intent. Whitman's American working people may be nothing more than a 
product of his profound optimism; writing at a time when the future of 
young America stretched ahead in many ways like the open roads he 
cherished, Whitman's romanticizing of them is not only understandable, 
but even touching, inspirational, and good-natured. Nonetheless, 
contemporary America is a place where such romantic views of our working
 people seem both anachronistic and dangerous â€“ indeed, the fact that 
ultra-conservative presidential candidate Pat Buchanan drew large 
numbers of working-class Americans away from their traditional 
Democratic party alliance during the 1996 primaries by accusing both the
 Clinton administration and the moderate Republicans of having similar 
romanticized views speaks volumes. Bruce Springsteen has been using his 
own artistic medium for over twenty years in an attempt to debunk the 
romantic myths surrounding the American working people, and to whatever 
extent rock and roll is a political force, he has at least succeeded in 
putting his message out. According to Pratt, the.<br>
<br>
real importance of the Springsteen phenomenom ... lies less in itself 
and more in the continued moral bankruptcy of a political system against
 which a rock star had to serve the function of tribune of the poor and 
dispossessed, the strung out, the beaten down, losers in an American 
dream gone out of control.... The Springsteen phenomenon is only one 
part of a developing story of an evolving popular consciousness seeking 
to find a role for itself through a collective discourse made up of 
elements of national popular culture. In Springsteen's case, there has 
been an acute sensitivity to the lives of ordinary people, together with
 populism and class identification, and a critique of the promise of a 
political economy that spins out lies and engenders dreams that can 
never be fulfilled. (192-93).<br>
<br>
Although he is not a "poet" in the same academic or intellectual sense 
that most literary critics would agree Whitman is, Springsteen is 
nonetheless an important contemporary American artist. He is important 
not because he plays a modern-day foil to Whitman's romanticized 
conceptions concerning American laborers, but because he, like Whitman, 
cares enough about the future of his country's working people to bring 
them to public attention via popular art. It is said that Whitman 
envisioned the future American people carrying his poetry around in 
their pockets. In 2000 America, though, we would probably be more likely
 to find the front seats of cars littered with Springsteen cassettes 
than with copies of Leaves of Grass. But if those people listening to 
Springsteen aren't "paying attention to the words," then they're doing a
 disservice to more than his artistic integrity.<br>

REBORN IN THE U.S.A</strong>.<br>
<br>
Although the glory days of the mid-'80s have passed, Bruce Springsteen 
is content writing songs again about blue-collar ideals and struggles â€“ 
and taking them to the people they depict<br>
<br>
By Robert Hilburn<br>
<br>
YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio<br>
<br>
The enthusiastic audience in the elegant old Stambaugh Auditorium has 
been cheering after each of the first dozen songs in Bruce Springsteen's
 solo acoustic concert, from the stark observation of "Darkness on the 
Edge of Town" to the bittersweet commentary of "The Ghost of Tom Joad."<br>
<br>
But the crowd is hushed now as Springsteen begins introducing 
"Youngstown." The song from his demanding new album tells how the town's
 very soul was torn from it when the steel mills began shutting down in 
the late '70s, leaving more than 10,000 workers unemployed.<br>
<br>
"This is about the men and women who lived in this town and who built 
this country," Springsteen tells the heavily bundled crowd on a night 
when foot-deep snow from the Blizzard of '96 covers the ground outside.<br>
<br>
"It's about (the people) who gave their sons and daughters to the wars 
that were fought ... and who were later declared expendable."<br>
<br>
The people of Youngstown know the story of the song all too well. Many 
in the hall either worked in the mills or are related to someone who 
did.<br>
<br>
To some of them, the song is a salute to the generations of workers who 
built the steel for, among other things, the tanks and planes that 
helped win the nation's wars. To others, "Youngstown" is a painful 
reminder of the betrayal they felt when owners closed the mills rather 
than upgrade them to better compete with foreign rivals.<br>
<br>
Except for a cheer the first time "Youngstown" is mentioned in the song, the audience listens in silence:<br>
<br>
Well my daddy come on the Ohio works<br>
When he come home from World War Two.<br>
Now the yard's just scrap and rubble,<br>
<br>
He said, "Them big boys did what Hitler couldn't do." ...<br>
My sweet Jenny I'm sinkin' down,<br>
Here darlin' in Youngstown.<br>
<br>
It's a wonderfully emotional moment -- the "Jenny" in the song refers to
 one of the city's historic blast furnaces, the still-standing but 
shuttered Jeannette.<br>
When the song ends, the tension in the hall breaks and the crowd gives 
Springsteen a standing ovation. Moments later, hundreds jam the aisles 
in front of the stage to shake his hand.<br>
<br>
It's a scene reminiscent of Springsteen's glory days, when he wrote 
about blue-collar idealism with a passion that placed him at the 
creative and commercial center of rock -- not unlike Youngstown's own 
status for decades in the steel world.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and the E Street Band filled stadiums around the world in 
the '80s, and his album "Born in the U.S.A." spent seven weeks at No. 1 
in 1984, selling more than 15 million copies in the United States alone.
 To millions of fans, he was the Boss.<br>
<br>
But now Springsteen is playing 2,500- to 5,000-seat theaters on his own,
 and "The Ghost of Tom Joad" failed to crack the national Top 10. After 
eight weeks in stores, it is languishing at No. 93 on the charts. Radio 
has generally ignored the album.<br>
<br>
Although the disc's bleak melodies and biting commentaries about hard 
times and injustice are defiantly uncommercial by today's pop standards,
 many observers see only the bottom line -- and they see a career 
suddenly as cold as the ground outside this hall.<br>
<br>
From a distance, the facts could point to a sobering conclusion: Time 
has passed the rock star by, the same way it has passed by Youngstown 
and blue-collar America.<br>
<br>
But while this downsizing of popularity could be devastating to an 
artist, Springsteen's mood seems anything but defeated. He is thrilled 
by the audience response on the tour, which he hopes will help draw 
attention to music he considers among the most personally satisfying of 
his long career.<br>
<br>
"If you look at the general arc of my career, I've had a very large cult
 audience from when I started," Springsteen says of his '80s 
superstardom. "Then I hit 'Born in the U.S.A.' -- and suddenly a lot of 
people who weren't interested in my music before and who haven't been 
interested in me since bought that record.<br>
<br>
"I always felt that whole 'the Boss' thing is fundamentally silly. I 
never for a second had the slightest idea or interest in going out and 
trying to (duplicate that success). I knew what it was the minute it 
happened -- it was an anomaly. I knew my audience would go back to its 
regular level. I didn't see that it might happen. I knew that it would 
happen."<br>
<br>
*<br>
<br>
You don't have to resort to counting album or ticket sales to document 
the changes in Springsteen's career during the last decade. You could 
just add up the press credentials at Stambaugh Auditorium, which is just
 10 minutes from the mills that stand silently at the western edge of 
town as ghostly reminders of Youngstown's better days.<br>
If Springsteen had taken a break during his "Born in the U.S.A." tour to
 play a small hall in a town he had just written a song about, an army 
of writers and TV crews would have followed him. Those were the days 
when Springsteen was such a force on the cultural scene that both 
presidential candidates in 1984 evoked his name.<br>
<br>
Tonight, however, only critics from the nearby Cleveland and Akron 
papers have joined the entertainment editor from the Youngstown 
Vindicator in reviewing the show. The only TV crews are from the local 
stations. "60 Minutes" did do a profile on him last Sunday, but that 
program tends to be as slow as the Grammys in catching up with rock 
artists.<br>
<br>
Details magazine, which takes pride in being the voice of the young and 
ultra-hip, slammed "Tom Joad" in its February issue, calling the album a
 "sad attempt" by Springsteen "to reinvent himself as a tasteful 
acoustic folk singer." In England, Q magazine described the album as the
 ghost of Springsteen himself, calling him "the blue-collar rock god who
 went missing at the end of the '80s."<br>
<br>
Other reviewers, however, have been wildly supportive. Rolling Stone 
called the album Springsteen's best in a decade and among the bravest 
works by anyone in the '90s. The Village Voice also hailed it: "As 
evidence regarding the gap between (the) gold-card rich and (the) 
dirt-poor mounts, and the public good grows as obsolete as any factory 
town, it becomes imperative for artists to go beyond themselves and draw
 attention to what we are losing."<br>
<br>
The irony in the debate over Springsteen's role in contemporary pop is 
that concert promoters say he could still gross upward of $150 million 
if he toured with the E Street Band, which he broke away from after the 
Amnesty International world tour of 1988 to explore other musical 
directions. And his "Greatest Hits" album -- which contained E Street 
Band classics, new band recordings and his Grammy- and Oscar-winning 
"Streets of Philadelphia" -- entered the charts at No. 1 last winter.<br>
<br>
So what's he doing in Youngstown?<br>
<br>
At 46, Springsteen no longer resembles the hungry young rocker on the 
cover of "Born to Run" or even the underdog warrior of "Born in the 
U.S.A." His hairline is receding and there are lines in his face. In the
 late afternoons, when he walks through the near-empty theaters, he can 
easily be mistaken for a stagehand.<br>
<br>
When he steps to the microphone on this tour, however, he seems a man 
rejuvenated. In interviews, too, he speaks with a sense of mission and 
perspective.<br>
<br>
"You don't start with the audience and then make a piece of music to fit
 that," he says. "That's where a lot of people make a mistake. They get 
caught up in the race, and it can be dangerous to your creativity and, 
probably, your sanity.<br>
<br>
"What you have to do is start with a piece of music and then search out 
the audience for it, and if this is the audience for the new album, 
that's fine. That's where I should be right now," he says, referring to 
his tour of small halls.<br>
<br>
In response to the inevitable question about an E Street Band reunion, Springsteen sighed.<br>
"I don't know if it pays to project too much into the future," he says. 
"I don't have any plans at the moment for the band, but I assume at some
 point we will play together in some fashion again. We enjoyed getting 
together for the greatest-hits thing. But we don't have any plans."<br>
<br>
There was excitement here over the song "Youngstown" as soon as 
Springsteen's new album was released in November. Local radio stations 
played it, and business was brisk at the Music Oasis record store in the
 Boardman Plaza.<br>
<br>
"There has been a good cross section of age groups coming in for it," 
says Robert Kane, assistant manager of the store, which sells 30 to 35 
copies of the album a week. "Mostly, it's people in their 20s and 30s, 
but a few teenagers are also caught up in it. They're not usual 
Springsteen fans, but they're intrigued that he wrote about their town."<br>
<br>
Interest heightened further after Springsteen's concert date was 
announced. All 2,600 tickets were sold in record time for the show at 
Stambaugh Auditorium, a showcase patterned after the Pantheon in Paris 
that was built in 1926 for $1.5 million and donated to the city by a man
 who earned part of his fortune from the steel mills.<br>
<br>
On the day of the show, fans began lining up in the icy hours before 
curtain time, hoping that extra tickets might be put on sale. David 
Yatsco, 36, drove three hours from Columbus. He's a Springsteen fan, but
 he also wanted to share in Youngstown's moment of glory. Some of his 
relatives once worked the mills.<br>
<br>
Such excitement is rare these days in this city of 95,000 on the Pennsylvania border.<br>
<br>
"When I came to Youngstown in '67, it was a vibrant town," says Michael 
Braun, an editor at the Youngstown Vindicator, standing in the 
newspaper's editorial conference room. "You'd go downtown and find 
people, cars, all kinds of stuff going on.<br>
<br>
"After the mills started closing, it was like the city's soul was taken 
away and all that was left was the husk. You go downtown now and almost 
every single building is shuttered. There's also been increased divorce,
 crime, alcoholism, suicide. It's a shame."<br>
<br>
You could say that Springsteen's path to Youngstown began 20 years ago 
when he first saw John Ford's 1940 film "The Grapes of Wrath." There was
 something in the adaptation of John Steinbeck's 1939 novel about the 
heroism of Tom Joad and the rest of his oppressed migrant farm family 
that touched the singer-songwriter from the blue-collar Jersey shore.<br>
<br>
"The film dealt with social and spiritual issues, the pursuit of 
justice," Springsteen says, sitting in his dressing room after his show 
the night before at the luxurious 5,000-seat Fox Theater in downtown 
Detroit. "I saw all these things as interconnected in people's lives.<br>
<br>
"You see how a single decision can affect a person's life or a whole 
country's life, and if the decision is wrong, you see how it can damage 
your soul, whether it's Vietnam or abandoning people in the inner city 
or seeing people's lives destroyed by taking their jobs away."<br>
In the early days of his career, Springsteen wrote about following one's
 dreams, winning over all odds. As he got older, he began worrying that 
he was not reflecting the harsher realities of the world. The images and
 questions of the Ford film came back to him.<br>
<br>
In key moments of such albums as "The River," "Nebraska" and even "Born 
in the U.S.A.," he found room for darker tales of society's victims -- 
people whose hopes had been destroyed by bad decisions, sometimes their 
own, sometimes those of ruthless authorities. The songs drew upon the 
tradition of folk, blues and country artists such as Woody Guthrie, Hank
 Williams and Robert Johnson, not the rock and soul heroes of his youth.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's writing took a turn after "Born in the U.S.A." He began 
focusing more in his albums "Tunnel of Love," "Human Touch" and "Lucky 
Town" on the tensions and joys of relationships. It was a natural 
subject because Springsteen, after devoting himself almost entirely to 
his music through his early 30s, began aggressively seeking a permanent 
relationship himself. He is now married to singer Patti Scialfa and the 
couple have three children -- Evan James, 5; Jessica Rae, 4, and Sam 
Ryan, 2.<br>
<br>
Springsteen was three-fourths of the way through another album about 
relationships in 1993 when director Jonathan Demme asked him to write a 
song for his AIDS drama "Philadelphia."<br>
<br>
In "Streets of Philadelphia," Springsteen addressed the subject with 
such compassion that it somehow reconnected him with the social 
observation and commentary of his earlier albums, especially the 
acclaimed "Nebraska" (1982).<br>
<br>
He set aside the other collection and began writing about the Tom Joads 
of today, including the country's new arrivals from Mexico and Vietnam 
who are suffering the same injustices as the migrant workers of the 
'30s.<br>
<br>
Yet he had no delusions about the album's sales potential in today's pop climate.<br>
<br>
If you can judge them by their buying habits, most young rock fans 
appear to be too caught up in music that expresses the anger and 
alienation of adolescence to deal with songs about society's other 
problems. At the same time, older pop fans have turned to the more 
soothing and comforting sounds of bands like Hootie &amp; the Blowfish. 
Realizing that radio probably wouldn't play the new album any more than 
it played "Nebraska," Springsteen decided to take his case to the road.<br>
<br>
"People turn to entertainment for a lot of different reasons -- to 
dance, to forget their troubles -- and that's fine," he says. "If I'm 
working 9 to 5, that's plenty of reality for me during the week, you 
know. Come the<br>
weekend, I want some fun.<br>
<br>
"At the same time, I think there are plenty of people who do go to music
 and film and novels and art as a way to find something that feels 
reflective of the world as they know it. I find tremendous comfort in 
that type of work."<br>
<br>
Despite his reputation as one of rock's premier performers, Springsteen 
was anxious about this tour -- unsure whether his audience would accept 
him in a solo acoustic format. He had often included moments of social 
observation in his shows, but they had been surrounded by uplifting rock
 'n' roll celebration.<br>
"For the music to work, you have to have silence," he says. "These songs
 come to life in the quiet, and I knew intrusions on that quiet would 
chip away at the mood you are trying to convey.<br>
<br>
"The show has a lot of elements. The spoken passages are as important as
 the songs in a way. It's theater and it's music. Ideally, I appear in 
between songs, but when the music starts, I disappear and the characters
 in the songs fill the stage with their lives and their experience."<br>
<br>
Audience acceptance has been so good that he is now thinking of 
extending the tour to the summer and possibly beyond, perhaps stepping 
up to even larger halls in selected cities. Things were so loose on the 
tour by the time he reached Detroit that he felt free to play a goofy 
novelty song about infomercials that he had written on a plane the same 
day.<br>
<br>
His tour nervousness returned, however, in the hours before the 
Youngstown concert. He's aware of the dangers of commenting on someone 
else's hometown. In writing the song, Springsteen had closely followed 
the facts in "Journey to Nowhere: the Saga of the New Underclass," a 
1985 book by photographer Michael Williamson and writer Dale Maharidge 
that discussed Youngstown.<br>
<br>
Still, Springsteen wondered if he got the tone right.<br>
<br>
The response at Stambaugh Auditorium left him jubilant.<br>
<br>
"This feeling was great," he tells a group of visitors backstage after 
the show. "It was like playing the VFW hall in my hometown -- the 
feeling of community. The response was very, very moving."<br>
<br>
Springsteen had been scheduled to leave town right after the show, but 
he decided to stay over for a day to visit historic sites in the area. 
As he lingered backstage for nearly two hours before returning to his 
hotel, he seemed more comfortable with his music and career than he had 
in years.<br>
<br>
The questions of his relevancy aren't new. They've been asked in one 
form or another ever since the "Born in the U.S.A." superstardom, which 
made him a multimillionaire.<br>
<br>
There was the issue of whether a rich man could truly identify with 
blue-collar woes, and whether Springsteen, the settled family man, had 
lost his creative edge.<br>
<br>
Staughton Lynd, a lawyer who represented local unions in a 1979 suit to 
prevent U.S. Steel from shutting its Youngstown mills, scoffs at the 
notion that Springsteen's music is irrelevant.<br>
<br>
"It's hard to name all the people who have just passed by while this 
town was bleeding and dying," Lynd said the day after the concert. "But 
(Springsteen) walked across the street. He cared -- and hopefully people
 in other cities will remember the song and learn from what happened 
here."<br>
<br>
Taconite coke and limestone<br>
Fed my children and made my pay.<br>

BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN (Interview)<br>
<br>
<br>
by Dave Marsh<br>
<br>
Springsteen returns from his two year marathon in the studio and 
introduces some new characters and insights along with some older 
influences, roaring to life the cylinders of his instinctive sense of 
emotional event. Dave Marsh examines the view from inside the mind of 
the last Roadside Romantic.<br>
<br>
A year ago, taking a respite from recording to play two nights of the 
M.U.S.E anti-nuke concerts, Bruce Springsteen pared his normal three 
hour show down to a more everyday 90 minutes: The result was pandemonium
 just this side of Beatlemania. Following the biggest stars in American 
soft rock to the Madison Square Garden stage, Springsteen and the E 
Street Band upstaged everyone, including the issue itself. The air in 
the hall that night was one of fanaticism and conversion, as though 
Springsteen were a rock 'n' roll evangelist and the Garden his 
tabernacle.<br>
<br>
It's easy to imagine that Springsteen was just a pro rising to an 
occasion which included a camera crew and a recording truck, not to 
mention a backstage full of peers. What is harder to explain, unless 
you've seen him onstage before a crowd that might not include so much as
 a weekly newspaper reviewer, is that the M.U.S.E. shows were just a 
fragment of what he usually does. "After those shows went over so great,
 I just figured that that's what we'd be doing on this tour," remembers E
 Street guitarist Steve Van Zandt. "Just 90 minutes, a couple of 
ballads, and make people as crazy as you can, like the old days. We can 
do that. But not Bruce. What we ended up doing was just adding that 90 
minutes to the show we always did."<br>
<br>
By late October, when the E Streeters hit L.A. for four shows at the 
15,000 seat Sports Arena, they were playing four and one half hour 
shows, five nights a week. Going on at 8:30, they'd break at 1O, and 
return a half hour later to play until 12:45 -- or 1:00 or 1:15. And 
they weren't playing the ebb-and-flow show offered by most bands who 
play so long. We're talking about four hours of ensemble rock and roll 
here, in which even the ballads are attacked more strenuously than most 
modal jams. Yet Jan Landau, his manager, said one night, "I think Bruce 
might actually play longer, except that the band just gets worn out." 
True enough, drummer Max Weinberg often spends intermission taping 
bleeding fingers, and the others are spared such medicaments only 
because their instruments are less physically demanding.<br>
<br>
Generally, Springsteen did 32 or 33 songs, including 17 or 18 from "The 
River," a half dozen from "Darkness on the Edge of Town," five from 
"Born to Run," the perennial set closer "Rosalita" from "The Wild, The 
Innocent and the E Street Shuffle," plus "Fire" and "Because the Night" 
from his seemingly bottomless supply of unrecorded hits. And, of course,
 the Mitch Ryder medley which was the highlight of the "No Nukes" LP. 
But the show has that shape only on nights when Springsteen hasn't 
declared a special occasion, which is a rare night in itself. On 
Halloween, the second night in L.A., he cooked up a version of "Haunted 
House," the old Jumpin' Gene Simmons hit, at soundcheck, and opened the 
set with it -- after appearing from a coffin, and being chased around 
the stage by ghoul-robed roadies during the guitar break.<br>
<br>
On Saturday, Bruce added an acoustic guitar and accordion version of 
"The Price You Pay," and debuted "Fade Away," the one song from "The 
River" he'd avoided. On Monday night, with Bob Dylan in the house for a 
second night (he'd come with Jim Keltner on Thursday, and been 
impressed), Springsteen put "The Price You Pay" back in and dedicated it
 to his "inspiration." Plus a lengthy version of "Growing Up," from his 
first album. On both nights, he ended the encores with Jackson Browne, 
dueting on "Sweet Little Sixteen." On neither night did the inclusion of
 the additional songs mean the removal of any of the others.<br>
<br>
"Yeah, but you really missed it in St. Paul," said Van Zandt. "He turned
 around and called 'Midnight Hour,' and we all just about fainted. Funky
 (bassist Garry Tallent) didn't even believe we were doing it until 
about the second chorus." The band had not rehearsed the song, and it's 
unlikely that the E Street Band's present lineup had ever played it 
before in its five years together. But even the musicians thought that 
it sounded great.<br>
<br>
The expansiveness and elasticity of Springsteen's show is a conundrum, 
because arena rock is in all other hands the surest route to formula. 
One of the most miserable summers of my existence was spent watching 15 
Rolling Stones shows in 1975. By the fifth, I was fighting to stay 
awake; by the tenth I'd stopped fighting, a circumstance I ascribed to 
the band's senility until it occurred to me that no one was meant to 
look at more than one or maybe two of their damn fiestas.<br>
<br>
That's rock and roll for tourists. Springsteen plays for the natives. 
Although he would probably put it more idealistically, he's really just 
never lost the consciousness of a bar band musician, who knows that a 
good part of the house may be seeing all three sets. And like a bar band
 veteran, he refuses to resort to gimmicks. Mark Brickman's lighting is 
the best in rock, but it's based on relatively simple theatrical gels 
and an authoritative sense of timing with follow spots; any funk band in
 the Midwest might have a more elaborate concept, but nobody with lasers
 achieves such an effective result. (Brickman has a computer along on 
this tour, but only, he told me, because "if you can figure out a way to
 program Bruce's show, you can figure a way to make it work for 
anything." Most nights, Brickman and soundman Bruce Jackson might as 
well throw their set lists away.)<br>
<br>
But what reveals Springsteen bar band roots more than anything is his 
sense of intimacy with the crowd. One night during this tour, someone 
told me, he actually announced from the stage, "If the guy I met at the 
airport yesterday is here, please come to the stage at the break. I've 
got something for you," which is about as close to sock hop mentality as
 you could ask. At his show in Phoenix, during "Rosalita," Bruce made 
one of his patented leaps to the speakers at the side of the stage. But 
this time he missed.<br>
<br>
The crowd just kept on cheering, but back at the soundboard where 
Jackson and I were sitting, the tension was thick. Bruce might do 
anything, but this was weird; the band was holding the chord, and the 
chords of "Rosalita" are not meant to be held for five seconds, much 
less fifteen.<br>
<br>
It's a good long drop from the speakers, two feet high, to the floor, a 
good eight or nine feet away. All there was between Bruce and the hard 
concrete floor was the band's monitor mixing board, but as he tumbled 
down, roadie Bob Werner reached out and broke the fall. (He sprained his
 wrist in the process.)<br>
<br>
Neither the band nor the crowd could see any of this. The next thing any
 of us knew, the guitar appeared, tossed atop the speakers. Then a pair 
of hands and at last, Springsteen's head, with his 
silly-faced-little-boy grin. He shook his head, pulled himself the rest 
of the way up, and strapped on his guitar, went back into action as if 
nothing had occurred.<br>
<br>
This moment is presumably on film - there was a crew shooting a 
commercial that night - though from what angle I cannot say. But what 
that incident proclaims, more than anything, even Bruce's sense of 
spontaneity, is his sense of event. The cardinal rule of his shows is 
that something always happens. It's not only, as he says in the 
interview below, that he's prepared for whatever happens. Somehow, he 
always makes sure that something does occur. I've seen at least 100 
shows in the past six or seven years. The worst of them was fascinating,
 but maybe the most awesome have been the times when, after four or five
 nights of hell raising action, he manages to make it different again. 
This guy does not know the meaning of anticlimax.<br>
<br>
But there's the bright side. There are darker ones. In Los Angeles, 
where ticket scalping is legal, front row seats for this extravaganza 
were going for $180, $200, $250. And fans wrote Bruce to complain, not 
just that tickets were being scalped, but that the best ones were. It's 
an old story, and most bands would let it slide, but Bruce took a stand.
 Each night in L.A., he gave the crowd the name of a state legislator, 
and a radio station, who'd agreed to campaign to change the scalping law
 in California. This might qualify as a gesture -- although the night 
after Landau got a pre-show phone call from a "ticket agent" suggesting 
that Bruce "do what he does, and I'll do what I do, so why don't he just
 lay off," he made the announcement three times -- but he's also hired 
investigators to get to the bottom of the mess, with intentions of 
turning the information over to the proper authorities, if any hard 
evidence can be turned up.<br>
<br>
And this reflects the spirit in which Springsteen played M.U.S.E. 
Although he was one of only two musicians at the benefit who did not 
make a political statement in the concert program (the other was Tom 
Petty), Springsteen upstaged the issue only accidentally. He felt that 
particular problem to his marrow: "Roulette," the song he wrote right 
after Three Mile Island, is the scariest piece of music he's ever done, 
for my money more frightening that even the last lines of "Stolen Car," 
and unmistakably based on the event. (Not to mention Del Shannon's 
paranoic "Stranger in Town.") There is more to come.<br>
<br>
"The River" itself feels like a farewell to innocence. As Springsteen 
notes in the interview below, the innocent characters on this album are 
anachronisms. Their time is gone. That guy lying by the side of the road
 in "Wreck on the Highway" is not only the guy in "Cadillac Ranch" and 
"Ramrod," he is also Spanish Johnny, the original man-child hero of "The
 Wild, the Innocent and The E Street Shuffle."<br>
<br>
"The River" is, I think, Bruce Springsteen's best album for this very 
reason. It sums up seven years of work, and it does not shy away from 
the errors of his career thus far, nor does it disown them. He remains a
 romantic and a bit of a juvenile, after all this, for who but a 
romantic juvenile could conceive of a purposeless car thief as a genuine
 figure of tragedy? But he is also capable now of tying together his 
hopes and fears -- the most joyous of songs are awash with brutal 
undercurrents.<br>
<br>
"The River" wasn't the record anyone would have predicted Bruce 
Springsteen would make. Epics aren't anticipated (although they might be
 the subject of certain fervent hopes). But if "The River" was 
unpredictable, the album that will follow it is almost unimaginable. And
 not only because the society that shaped Springsteen's most beloved 
characters and the musical tradition he cherishes is now crumbling.<br>
<br>
Among other things, "The River" is a Number One record. "Hungry Heart" 
looks likely to be his first Top Ten single. Things change when that 
happens, and we have not yet seen the rock and roller who is strong 
enough to withstand those changes. It would be naive to expect Bruce 
Springsteen to be any different.<br>
<br>
Yet Bruce Springsteen's career is all about naive faith. Who else could 
have survived The New Dylan, The Future of Rock and Roll, The Hype, The 
Boss? And emerged not only successful, but respected. It's easy to play 
cynical rock journalist and suppose the worst -- no one else has exactly
 cruised through success -- but the fact is. Bruce Springsteen is the 
only human I have ever met who cannot sell out. He doesn't have a price,
 because the things he wants are quite literally beyond price. You don't
 have to believe me. Just wait and see. As Miami Steve says, "For the 
first time, I can really imagine rock and roll at 40." The interview 
below took place at the Fiesta Motel in Tempe, Arizona on Nov. 6th, from
 about 3:30 AM until dawn. (The time frame is typical.) Bruce had just 
completed a show at Arizona State University, and in a strange way, what
 I'll remember about that night isn't talking with him or even the fall 
off the speakers but the lines he sang just after the fall, that 
climactic verse of "Rosalita:"<br>
<br>
Tell your daddy this is his last chance<br>
If he wants his daughter to have some fun<br>
Because my brand new record, Rosie<br>
Just came in at Number one<br>
<br>
He won't forget, either.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: Here you are, "The River" is a Number One album, the single is
 a hit, you're playing great shows in the biggest halls, and selling 
them out. In a sense, a lot of goals you must have had are now achieved.
 What goals are left?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Doing it is the goal. It's not to play some big place, or 
for a record to be Number One. Doing it is the end -- not the means. 
That's the point. So the point is: What's next? Some more of this.<br>
<br>
But bigness -- that is no end. That as an end, is meaningless, 
essentially. It's good, 'cause you can reach a lotta people, and that's 
the idea. The idea was just to go out and to reach people. And after 
tonight, you go out and you reach more people, and then the night after 
that, you do that again.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: One of the things that "The River" and also the show, its 
length and certain of the things you say between songs, are about is 
seeing more possibilities, more opportunities for things to do.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Yeah. There's an immense amount. and I'm just starting to 
get some idea about what I want to do. Because we've been in a 
situation, always, until recently, there's been a lot of instability in 
everybody's life. The band's and mine. It dates back to the very 
beginning, from the bars on up to even after we were successful. Then 
there was the lawsuit.<br>
<br>
And then there's the way we work, which is: We're SLOW. And in the 
studio, I'm slow. I take a long time. That means you spend a lotta money
 in the studio. Not only do you spend a lotta money, you don't make any 
money, because you're out of the stream of things. It's like you can 
never get ahead, because as soon as you get ahead, you stop for two 
years and you go back to where you were.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: Is that slowness as frustrating for you as it is for everybody else?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: I'm lucky, because I'm in there, I'm seeing it every step 
of the way. I would assume that if you didn't know what was going on, 
and you cared about it, it would be frustrating. With me, it was not 
frustrating.<br>
<br>
You know, we started to work [on the album] and I had a certain idea at 
the beginning. And at the end, that was the idea that came out on the 
record. It took a very long time, all the coloring and stuff, there was a
 lot of decisions and songs to be written. Right up until the very last 
two weeks, when I rewrote the last two verses to "Point Blank." "Drive 
All Night" was done just the week before that. Those songs didn't exist,
 in the form that they're on the record, until the last few weeks we 
were in the studio. So there's stuff happening all the time. But we get 
into that little bit of a cycle, which hopefully we'll be able to break 
-- maybe, I don't know.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: In a lot of ways, "The River" feels like the end of a cycle. 
Certain ideas that began with the second and third albums have matured, 
and a lot of the contrasts and contradictions have been - not resolved -
 but they've been heightened.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: On this album, I just said, "I don't understand all these 
things. I don't see where all these things fit. I don't see how all 
these things can work together." It was because I was always focusing in
 on some small thing: when I stepped back, they made a sense of their 
own. It was just a situation of living with all those contradictions. 
And that's what happens. There's never any resolution. You have moments 
of clarity, things become clear to you that you didn't understand 
before. But there's never any making ends meet or finding any time of 
longstanding peace of mind about something.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: That's sort of like "Wreck on the Highway," where, for the 
first time in your songs, you've got the nightmare and the dream in a 
package.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: That was a funny song. I wrote that song real fast, in one 
night. We came in and played a few takes of it and that's pretty much 
what's on the album, I think. That's an automatic song, a song that you 
don't really think about, or work on. You just look back and it sorta 
surprises you.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: On this record, it also feels like you're relying a lot more 
on your instincts, the sort of things that happen on stage.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Yeah, that's what happens the most to make the record 
different. A lot of it is real instinctive. "Hungry Heart" I wrote in a 
half hour, or ten minutes, real fast. All the rockers -- "Crush On You,"
 "You Can Look," "Ramrod" -- were all written very quickly, from what I 
can remember. "Wreck on the Highway" was; "Stolen Car" was. Most of the 
songs were, sit down and write 'em. There weren't any songs where I 
worked -- "Point Blank" I did, but actually those last two verses I 
wrote pretty quickly. "The River" took awhile. I had the verses, I never
 had any chorus, and I didn't have no title for a long time.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: But you always had the basic arrangement?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: No, on that song, I had these verses, and I was fooling 
around with the music. What gave me the idea for the title was a Hank 
Williams song, I think it's "My Bucket's Got a Hole In It," where he 
goes down to the river to jump in and kill himself, and he can't because
 it dried up. So I was just sitting there one night, thinking, and I 
just thought about this song, "My Bucket's Got a Hole In It," and that's
 where I got the chorus. [Actually, he's referring to "Long Gone, 
Lonesome Blues" - D.M.]<br>
<br>
I love that old country music. All during the last tour that's what I 
listened to a whole lot -- I listened to Hank Williams. I went back and 
dug up all his first sessions, the gospel kind of stuff that he did. 
That and the first real Johnny Cash record with "Give My Love to Rose," 
"I Walk the Line," "Hey Porter," "Six Foot High 'and Risin'," "I Don't 
Like It But I Guess Things Happen That Way." That and the rockabilly.<br>
<br>
There was a certain something in all that stuff that just seemed to fit 
in with things that I was thinking about, or worrying about. Especially 
the Hank Williams stuff. He always has all that conflict, he always has 
that real religious side, and the honky tonkin', all that side. There's a
 great song, "Settin' the Woods on Fire." That thing is outrageous. 
That's "Ramrod," that had some of that in it. And "Cadillac Ranch."<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: Earlier, you said that "Ramrod" was one of the saddest things you'd written. Why?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: (Laughs) Well, it's so anachronistic, you know. The 
character -- it's impossible, what he wants to do. One of the ideas of 
it, when I wrote it, it was sort of like a partner to "Cadillac Ranch" 
and a few things, it's got that old big engine sound. That song is a 
goddam gas guzzler (laughing). And that was the sound I wanted, that 
big, rumbling, big engine sound. And this guy, he's there, but he's 
really not there no more. He's the guy in "Wreck on the Highway" -- 
either guy, actually. But he's also the guy, in the end, who says, "I'll
 give you the word, now, sugar, we'll go ramroddin' forevermore." I 
don't know; that's a real sad line to me, sometimes.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: If you believe it, you mean.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Yeah, but it's a funny kinda thing. I love it when we play 
that song on stage. It's just a happy song, a celebration of all that 
stuff that's gonna be gone -- is gone already, almost.<br>
<br>
I threw that song ten million times off the record. Ten million times. I
 threw it off "Darkness" and I threw it off this one, too. Because I 
thought it was wrong.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: You mentioned something similar about "Out in the Street," that it was too much of a fantasy to possibly believe it.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: I was just wary of it at that time, I guess for some of the
 same reasons. It always seemed anachronistic, and at the time, I was 
demanding of all the songs that they be able to translate. All the 
characters, they're part of the past, they're part of the future and 
they're part of the present. And I guess there was a certain frightening
 aspect to seeing one that wasn't part of the future. He was part of the
 past. To me, that was the conflict of that particular song. I loved it,
 we used to play it all the time. And there was that confusion too. 
Well, if I love playing the damn thing so much, why the hell don't I 
want to put it on the record?<br>
<br>
I guess I always made sure that the characters always had that foot 
planted up ahead somewhere. Not just the one back there. That's what 
makes 'em viable, or real, today. But I also knew a lotta people who 
were exactly like this. So I said, well, that's OK. There was just a 
point where I said, that's OK, to a lot of things where I previously 
would not have said so.<br>
<br>
I gained a certain freedom, in making the two record set, because I 
could let all those people out, that usually I'd put away. Most of the 
time, they'd end up being my favorite songs, and probably some of my 
best songs, you know.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: You mean the kind of songs that would show up on stage, but 
not on record? ["Fire," Because the Night," "Sherry Darling"]<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Yeah. I'm the kind of person, I think a lot about 
everything. Nothin' I can do about it. It's like, I'm a thinkin' fool. 
That's a big part of me. Now, the other part is, I can get onstage and 
cut that off and be superinstinctive. To be a good live performer, you 
have to be instinctive. It's like, to walk in the jungle, or to do 
anything where there's a certain tightrope wire aspect you need to be 
instinctive. And you have to be comfortable at it also.<br>
<br>
Like tonight, I was falling on my head. I wasn't worryin' about it. I 
just went, it just happened. (Laughs) You just think, what happens next?
 When I was gonna jump on that speaker, I couldn't worry about whether I
 was gonna make it or not. You can't. You just gotta do it. And if you 
do, you do, and if you don't, you don't, and then something else 
happens. That's the point of the live performance.<br>
<br>
Now, when I get into the studio, both things operate. When we perform on
 this record, I feel that we have that thing going that we've got live. 
To me, we're not rockin' that stuff better live than a lot of it is on 
the record. I can still listen to it. Usually, two weeks after we're out
 on the record, I cannot listen to my record any more. 'Cause as soon as
 I hear some crappy tape off the board, it sounds ten times better than 
what we spent all that time doing in the studio. This is the very first 
album that I've been able to go back and put on to play, and it sounds 
good to me.<br>
<br>
But in the studio, I'm conceptual. I have a self-consciousness. And there's a point where I often would try to stop that.<br>
<br>
"No, that's bad. Look at all these great records, and I betcha they 
didn't think about it like this, or think about it this long." You 
realize that it doesn't matter. That's unimportant, it's ridiculous. I 
got into a situation where I just said, "Hey, this is what I do, and 
these are my assets and these are my burdens." I got comfortable with 
myself being that kind of person.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: But only after going to extremes. "Darkness" is the least spontaneous of your records.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: That's right. And it's funny because "Darkness on the Edge 
of Town," that cut is live in the studio. "Streets of Fire" is live in 
the studio, essentially. "Factory" is live. It's not a question of how 
you actually do it. The idea is to sound spontaneous, not be 
spontaneous.<br>
<br>
So at this point, I just got settled into accepting certain things that 
I've always been uncomfortable with. I stopped setting limits and 
definitions -- which I always threw out anyway, but which I'd always 
feel guilty about. Spending a long time in the studio, I stopped feeling
 bad about that. I said, that's me, that's what I do. I work slow, and I
 work slow for a reason: To get the results that I want.<br>
<br>
When you try to define what makes a good rock and roll record, or what 
is rock and roll, everyone has their own personal definition. But when 
you put limits on it, you're just throwing stuff away.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: Isn't one of your definitions that it's limitless?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: I think it is. That's my definition, I guess. Hey, you can 
go out in the street and do the twist and that's rock and roll. It's the
 moment, it's all things. (Laughs) It's funny, to me, it just is.<br>
<br>
You know, my music utilizes things from the past, because that's what 
the past is for. It's to learn from. It's not to limit you, you 
shouldn't be limited by it, which I guess was one of my fears on 
"Ramrod." I don't want to make a record like they made in the '50s or 
the '60s or the '70s. I want to make a record like today, that's right 
now.<br>
<br>
To do that, I go back, back further all the time. Back into Hank 
Williams, back into Jimmy Rodgers. Because the human thing in those 
records, that should be at least the heart of it. The human thing that's
 in those records is just beautiful and awesome. I put on that Hank 
Williams and Jimmy Rodgers stuff and Wow! What inspiration! It's got 
that beauty and the purity. The same thing with a lot of the great 
Fifties records, and the early rockabilly. I went back and dug up all 
the early rockabilly stuff because... what mysterious people they were.<br>
<br>
There's this song, "Jungle Rock" by Hank Mizell. Where is Hank Mizell? 
What happened to him? What a mysterious person, what a ghost. And you 
put that thing on and you can see him. You can see him standing in some 
little studio, way back when, and just singing that song. No reason. 
(Laughs) Nothing gonna come out of it. Didn't sell. That wasn't no 
Number One record, and he wasn't playin' no big arena after it, either.<br>
<br>
But what a moment, what a mythic moment, what a mystery. Those records 
are filled with mystery: they're shrouded with mystery. Like these wild 
men came out from somewhere, and man, they were so alive. The joy and 
the abandon. Inspirational, inspirational records, those records.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: You mentioned earlier that when you went into the arenas that you were worried about losing certain things.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: I was afraid maybe it would screw up the range of artistic 
expression that the band had. Because of the lack of silence. A couple 
things happened. Number one, it's a rock and roll show. People are gonna
 scream their heads off whenever they feel like it. That's fine -- 
happens in theaters, happens in clubs. (Laughs) Doesn't matter where the
 hell it is, happens every place, and that's part of it, you know.<br>
<br>
On this tour, it's been really amazing, because we've been doing all 
those real quiet songs. And we've been able to do 'em. And then we've 
been able to rock real hard and get that thing happening from the 
audience. I think part of the difference is that the demands that are 
made on the audience now are much heavier, much heavier on the audience 
that sees us now than on the last tour.<br>
<br>
But the moment you begin to depend on audience reaction, you're doing 
the wrong thing. You're doin' it wrong, it's a mistake, it's not right. 
You can't allow yourself, no matter what, to depend on them. I put that 
mike out to the crowd, you have a certain faith that somebody's gonna 
yell somethin' back. Some nights it's louder than other nights and some 
nights they do, and on some songs they don't. But that's the idea. I 
think when you begin to expect a reaction, it's a mistake. You gotta 
have your thing completely together -- boom! right there with you. 
That's what makes nights special and what makes nights different from 
other nights.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: On the other hand, the only way to do a really perfect show is
 to involve that audience. Maybe an audience only gets lazy if the 
performer doesn't somehow keep it on its toes.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: I'm out there for a good time and to be inspired at night, 
and to play with my band and to rock those songs as hard as we can rock 
'em. I think that you can have some of the best nights under the very 
roughest conditions. A lotta times, at Max's or some of the clubs down 
in Jersey, they'd be sittin' on their hands or nobody wants to dance, 
and the adversity is a positive motivation.<br>
<br>
The only concern is that what's being done is being done the way it 
should be done. The rest you don't have control over. But I think that 
our audience is the best audience in the world. The amount of freedom 
that I get from the crowd is really a lot.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: The way the stage show is organized is that the first half is 
about work and struggling: the second half is about joy, release, 
transcending a lot of those things in the first half. Is that conscious?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: I knew that I wanted a certain feeling for the first set. That's sorta the way it stacks up.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: What you rarely get a sense of around rock bands is work, 
especially rock and roll as a job of work. Yet around this band, you 
can't miss it.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: That's at the heart of the whole thing. There's a beauty in
 work and I love it, all different kinds of work. That's what I consider
 it. This is my job, and that's my work. And I work my ass off, you 
know.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: In Los Angeles one night, when you introduced "Factory," you 
made a distinction between two different kinds of work. Do you remember 
what it was?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: There's people that get a chance to do the kind of work 
that changes the world, and make things really different. And then 
there's the kind that just keeps the world from falling apart. And that 
was the kind that my dad always did. Cause we were always together as a 
family, and we grew up in a... good situation, where we had what we 
needed. And there was a lot of sacrifice on his part and my mother's 
part for that to happen...<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: "The River" has a lot of those sorts of workers -- the people in "Jackson Cage," the guy in "The River" itself.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: I never knew anybody who was unhappy with their job and was
 happy with their life. It's your sense of purpose. Now, some people can
 find it elsewhere. Some people can work a job and find it some place 
else.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: Like the character in "Racing in the Street"?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Yeah. But I don't know if that's lasting. But people do, they find ways.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: Or else... ?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: (Long pause) Or else they join the Ku Klux Klan or 
something. That's where it can take you, you know. It can take you a lot
 of strange<br>
places.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: Introducing "Factory" on a different night, you spoke about 
your father having been real angry, and then, after awhile. not being 
angry anymore. "He was just silent." Are you still angry?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if I know myself 
that well. I think I know myself a lot but I'm not sure. (Laughs) It's 
impossible not to be [angry] when you see the state of things and look 
around. You have to be, somewhat.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: Tonight, you were saying on stage that you found the election 
terrifying. That seems to go hand in hand with playing the M.U.S.E. 
benefits, and striking back at ticket scalpers in L.A. You wouldn't have
 done those things two years ago, I don't think. Are you finding social 
outlets for that anger now?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: That's true. It's just a whole values thing. Take the 
ticket thing. It's a hustle. And a hustle has become... respected. In a 
lot of quarters -- on a street level, dope pushers -- it's a respectable
 thing, to hustle somebody. I mean, how many times in the Watergate 
thing did people say about Nixon, "Well, he just wasn't smart enough to 
get away with it." Like his only mistake was that he didn't get away 
with it. And there's a certain point where people have become cynical, 
where the hustle, that's the American way. I think it's just turned 
upside down in a real bad way. I think it should lose its respect.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: Do you feel that way about nuclear energy?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: It's just the whole thing, it's the whole thing. It's 
terrible, it's horrible. Somewhere along the way, the idea, which I 
think was initially to get some fair transaction between people, went 
out the window. And what came in was, the most you can get. (Laughs) The
 most you can get and the least you can give. That's why cars are the 
way they are today. It's just an erosion of all the things that were 
true and right about the original idea.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: But that isn't something that was on your mind much until the "Darkness" album?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Up to then, I didn't think about too many things. In 
"Greetings from Asbury Park," I did. And then I went off a little bit, 
and sort of roundabout came back to it.<br>
<br>
I guess it just started after "Born to Run" somehow. I had all that time
 off, and I spent a lotta time home. We were off for three years, and 
home for a long time. It came out of a local kind of thing -- what my 
old friends were doing, what my relatives were doing. How things were 
affecting them, and what their lives were like. And what my life was 
like.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: Did you have a sense that no one else was telling that story?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: I didn't see it too much, except in the English stuff. Things were being addressed that way in that stuff.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: You mean, for instance, the Clash?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Yeah, all that kinda stuff. I liked it, I always liked that
 stuff. But there wasn't too much stuff in America happening. It just 
seemed to me that's the story. But there was a crucial level of things 
missing, and it is today still. Maybe it's just me getting older and 
seeing things more as they are.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: On "Darkness," the character's response is to isolate himself 
from any community, and try to beat the system on his own. The various 
characters on "The River" are much more living in the mainstream of 
society.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: That guy at the end of "Darkness" has reached a point where
 you just have to strip yourself of everything, to get yourself 
together. For a minute, sometimes, you just have to get rid of 
everything, just to get yourself together inside, be able to push 
everything away. And I think that's what happened at the end of the 
record.<br>
<br>
And then there was the thing where the guy comes back.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: And "The River" is what he sees?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Yeah, these are his feelings. it's pretty much there, and 
in the shows, it's there now, too, I guess. I hate to get too literal 
about it, because I can never explain it as well as when I wrote about 
it. I hate to limit it. I look back at "Darkness" or the other records, 
and there were other things going on that I never knew were going on.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: Do you like "Born to Run" and "Darkness" better now?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Not particularly. On "Darkness," I like the ideas. I'm not 
crazy about the performances. We play all those songs ten times better 
live. But I like the idea. "Born to Run," I like the performances and 
the sound. Sometimes, it sounds funny.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: Young and innocent?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Yeah, yeah. Same thing with "The Wild and the Innocent." I 
have a hard time listening to any of those records. Certain things on 
each record I can listen to: "Racing in the Street," "Backstreets," 
"Prove it All Night," "Darkness on the Edge of Town." But not a lot, 
because either the performance doesn't sound right to me, or the ideas 
sound like a long time ago.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: Do you remember when you threw the birthday cake into the crowd, at the second M.U.S.E. concert?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: (Laughs) Oh yeah. That was a wild night.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: You'd just turned 30 that night, and didn't seem to be 
overjoyed by it. But a couple weeks ago in Cleveland, I was kidding 
Danny about turning 30, and said, "Oh yeah, we're 30 now, can't do what 
we used to do." You said, real quick, "That's not true." What happened 
in that year? Was that significant, turning 30?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: I don't remember. It just made me wanna do more things. I 
think, as a matter of fact, when we were in the studio, that was the 
thing that was big. I didn't feel we were going too slow for what we 
were doing. But I felt that I wanted to be quicker just to have more 
time. I wanted to be touring, for one thing. I wanted to be touring 
right now.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: But by the time you finish this tour, you'll be crowding 32. 
Then, if you're right and it's just gonna take a year or so to make a 
record, you'll be 33 or 34 by the time you get out again. Can you still 
have the stamina to do the kind of show you feel the need to do?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Who knows? I'm sure it'll be a different type of show. It's
 impossible to tell and a waste of time guessin'. When I was in the 
studio and wanted to play, it wasn't the way I felt in a physical kind 
of way, it was what I felt mentally. I was excited about the record and I
 wanted to play those songs live. I wanted to get out there and travel 
around the world with people who were my friends. And see every place 
and play just as hard as we could play, every place in the world. Just 
get into things, see things, see what happens.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: Like in "Badlands"?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: That's it. That's the idea. I want to see what happens, 
what's next. All I knew when I was in the studio, sometimes, was that I 
felt great that day. And I was wishing I was somewhere strange, playing.
 I guess that's the thing I love doing the most. And it's the thing that
 makes me feel most alert and alive.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: You look awful before a show, and then those hours up there, which exhaust everyone else, refresh you.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: I always look terrible before the show. That's when I feel 
worst. And after the show it's like a million bucks. Simple as that. You
 feel a little tired but you never feel better. Nothing makes me feel as
 good as those hours between when you walk offstage, until I go to bed. 
That's the hours that I live for. As feelings go, that's ten on a scale 
of ten. I just feel like talking to people, going back and meeting those
 kids, doing any damn thing. Most times I just come back and eat and lay
 down and feel good. Most people, I don't think, get to feel that good, 
doing whatever they do.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: You can't get that in the studio?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Sometimes, but it's different. You get wired for two or 
three days or a week or so and then sometimes, you feel real low. I 
never feel as low, playing, as I do in the studio.<br>
<br>
You know, I just knew that's what I wanted to do -- go all over and 
play. See people and go all over the world. I want to see what all those
 people are like. I want to meet people from all different countries and
 stuff.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: You've always liked to have a certain mobility, a certain freedom of movement. Can you still walk down the street?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Oh sure, sure. It depends where you go. Usually... you can 
do anything you want to do. The idea that you can't walk down the street
 is in people's minds. You can walk down any street, any time. What you 
gonna be afraid of, someone coming up to you? In general, it's not that 
different than it ever was, except you meet people you ordinarily might 
not meet - you meet some strangers and you talk to 'em for a little 
while.<br>
<br>
The other night I went out, I went driving, we were in Denver. Got a car
 and went out, drove all around. Went to the movies by myself, walked 
in, got my popcorn. This guy comes up to me, real nice guy. He says, 
"Listen, you want to sit with me and my sister?" I said, "All right." So
 we watch the movie (laughs). It was great, too, because it was that 
Woody Allen movie "Stardust Memories," the guy's slammin' to his fans. 
And I'm sittin' there and this poor kid says, "Jesus, I don't know what 
to say to ya. Is this the way it is? Is that how you feel?" I said, "No,
 I don't feel like that so much." And he had the amazing courage to come
 up to me at the end of the movie, and ask if I'd go home and meet his 
mother and father. I said, "What time is it?" It was 11 o'clock, so I 
said, "Well OK."<br>
<br>
So I go home with him; he lives out in some suburb. So we get over to 
the house and here's his mother and father, laying out on the couch, 
watching TV and reading the paper. He brings me in and he says, "Hey I 
got Bruce Springsteen here." And they don't believe him. So he pulls me 
over, and he says, "This is Bruce Springsteen." "Aw, g'wan," they say. 
So he runs in his room and brings out an album and he holds it up to my 
face. And his mother says (breathlessly) "Ohhh yeah!" She starts yelling
 "Yeah," she starts screaming.<br>
<br>
And for two hours I was in this kid's house, talking with these people, 
they were really nice, they cooked me up all this food, watermelon, and 
the guy gave me a ride home a few hours later.<br>
<br>
I felt so good that night. Because here are these strange people I 
didn't know, they take you in their house, treat you fantastic and this 
kid was real nice, they were real nice. That's something that can happen
 to me that can't happen to most people. And when it does happen, it's 
fantastic. You get somebody's whole life in three hours. You get their 
parents, you get their sister, you get their family life, in three 
hours. And I went back to that hotel and felt really good because I 
thought, "Wow (almost whispering), what a thing to be able to do. What 
an experience to be able to have, to be able to step into some 
stranger's life."<br>
<br>
And that's what I thought about in the studio. I thought about going out
 and meeting people I don't know. Going to France and Germany and Japan,
 and meeting Japanese people and French people and German people. 
Meeting them and seeing what they think, and being able to go over there
 with something. To go over there with a pocketful of ideas or to go 
over there with just something, to be able to take something over. And 
boom! To do it.<br>
<br>
But you can't do one without the other. I couldn't do it if I hadn't 
spent time in the studio, knowing what I saw and what I felt right now.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: Because then you wouldn't have that pocketful of ideas?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Then, if you don't have that, stay home or something. If 
you have some ideas to exchange, that's what it's about. That's at the 
heart of it. I just wouldn't go out and tour unless I had that. There 
wouldn't be a reason.<br>
<br>
The reason is you have some idea you wanna say. You have an idea about 
things, an opinion, a feeling about the way things are or the way things
 could be. You wanna go out and tell people about it. You wanna tell 
people, well, if everybody did this or if people thought this, maybe it 
would be better.<br>
<br>
When we play the long show, that's because it gives the whole picture. 
And if you aren't given the whole picture, you're not gonna get the 
whole picture. We play the first part... that first part is about those 
things that you said it was about. That's the foundation, without that 
the rest couldn't happen. Wouldn't be no second half without the first 
half; couldn't be all them other things, without those things. Without 
that foundation of the hard things, and the struggling things, the work 
things. That's the heart, that's what it comes down to. And then on top 
of that, there's the living, the things that surround that. That's why 
the show's so long. "You wanna leave out 'Stolen Car'? No, that's a 
little part of the puzzle. "You wanna leave this out?" No, that's a 
little part of the puzzle. And at the end, if you want, you can look 
back and see... just a point of view really. You see somebody's idea, 
the way somebody sees things. And you know somebody.<br>
<br>
People go to that show, they know me. They know a lotta me, as much as I
 know that part of myself. That's why, when I meet 'em on the street, 
they know you already. And you know them, too. Because of their 
response.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: Even these days, it's still not very far from the dressing room to the stage for you, is it?<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: I don't know if it is. I don't know if it should be. I 
don't know for sure how different the thing is or how it's perceived. 
Except a lot of the music is real idealistic, and I guess like anybody 
else, you don't live up to it all the time. You just don't. That's the 
challenge. You got to walk it like you talk it. That's the idea. That's 
the line. I guess that's pretty much what it's about.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The E Street Band's Equipment<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen: Guitars: 1954 Esquire, modified with extra Telecaster
 pick-up (THE guitar); 1956 Telecaster (spare); 1954 Telecaster (spare);
 Ovation six-string acoustic; two Rickenbacker 12-string electric, 1958 
Gibson J-200 Acoustic guitar (this is the same guitar as Elvis's 
original, and was a gift from crew members Mike Batlan, Marc Brickman 
and Bob Chirmside). Amps: Four pre-CBS Fender Bassman amps, ca. 
1958-1962; two Peavey Vintage amps (imitation Bassmans) -- one of each 
is used onstage under the drum riser. Also: a prime time digital delay 
and harmonizer and an MXR distortion box. The Fender Esquire is modified
 with a battery operated impedence transformer for long cable lengths. 
Information supplied by Mike Batlan, who also notes that there is an 
asterisk in front of the Esquire's serial number, indicating that is was
 a factory reject, probably originally sold as a reject.<br>
<br>
Miami Steve Van Zandt:<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: What equipment do you use on stage?<br>
<br>
VAN ZANDT: I don't know, you've gotta ask Dougie (Sutphin, E Street roadie).<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: When was the last time you did know?<br>
<br>
VAN ZANDT: In '65, I bought a Telecaster, and that's the last thing I remember.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: But lately, you've begun to use those Ovation 12 strings on stage...<br>
<br>
VAN ZANDT: I went to [actor] Sal Viscuso's house here in L.A., and he 
had homemade pasta, homemade bracciola, he had provolone and mozarrella 
flown in from New York. And the strangest thing happened: I went home 
and dreamed I was Leadbelly with an Italian accent.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN: So not paying attention to the technical details doesn't have much effect on your sound?<br>
<br>
VAN ZANDT: No. I'll tell you, I've got a secret technique. I play 
everything at 10. That's the great equalizer, you'd be surprised how 
similar everything sounds when you do that.<br>
<br>
MUSICIAN eventually did track down Doug Sutphin, doing laps at Malibu 
Grand Prix. At a pit stop, Sutphin informed us that Van Zandt has two 
Stratocasters, a '57 and a '67, a Gibson Firebird (a spare which he 
almost never plays onstage), and two hollow-body 12-string Ovation 
guitars, with pickups. One of the Ovations and one of the Strats is 
capo'd. Van Zandt has a Mesa Boogie amp with Electro-Voice speakers. two
 Roland Jazz Choirs (120) amps, and a 10O-watt Hi Watt brain and 
cabinet, plus an MXR distortion unit. And yes, he does play it all at 
10.<br>
<br>
Clarence Clemons: The Big Man plays Selver Mark VI tenors (a whole bunch
 of 'em) and altos, Yamaha baris and sopranos. with La-Voz reeds and 
Berg Larson mouthpieces. He uses a variety of Latin percussion (claves, 
tambourines, cowbell, etc.) and maracas by the Argentinian Hernandez 
company. His horns are miked with a device invented by Clemons and Bruce
 Jackson.<br>
<br>
Roy Bittan: Bittan, who's almost as well known for his session playing 
(with Meat Loaf, Dire Straits and others) as for his work with the E 
Street crew, uses a Yamaha C-7 grand piano as his basic instrument. He 
also plays a Yamaha CS80 synthesizer on a couple of numbers. The piano 
is fitted with a modified Helpinstill pickup. "The most important 
thing," the Professor says, "is ten fingers and fast hands."<br>
<br>
Danny Federici: Danny Federici is surrounded by banks of equipment 
onstage, which is unfortunate, since it tends to obscure some of the 
fanciest footwork in human history. While dancing, Federici plays a 
Hammond B-3 organ (with a spare backstage -- one of them was cut down by
 John Stilwell), two Farfisa combo compacts, and an Acetone (Top 5 
model), used exclusively for "Wreck on the Highway." The sound is 
channeled through two customized Leslies, with 12 2" speakers, Gauss HF 
4000 horn drivers and IF 15" speakers, and speed relays for both. 
Federici's amp rack, designed by Sound Specialties of Philadelphia, 
holds a Marantz 51O MR (600 watts) for the low end, a Phase Linear 400 
for the horns, a Urei 521 cross-over system, a Bi-Amp Model 270 graphic 
equalizer, and a Roland RU100 reverb unit.<br>
<br>
Danny also plays a keyboard operated glockenspiel, which is, he thinks, 
one of only two or three in the world. (When the E Streeters toured 
England and Scandinavia in '75, they managed to find one to complement 
his pair.) That runs through a standard Leslie 122 mounted in an Anvil 
case with an acoustic chamber and permanent mikes for off-stage miking.<br>
<br>
Federici's organ modifications (B3 cutdown, speed switches and relays) 
were done by John Stilwell, of Ithaca, N.Y., and Springsteen sound man 
Bruce Jackson.<br>
<br>
Max Weinberg: The Mighty Max. as he's introduced nightly, brought to his
 drum list as highly developed a sense of detail as he brings to his 
playing. He uses a 24" x 14" Ludwig 6-ply bass, with an Emperor head and
 14 coats of white varnish; it's stuffed with two old down pillows and 
miked with a Beyer 88.<br>
<br>
Weinberg's toms are also Ludwigs; he uses both a 10" x 14" and a 16" x 
16". The rack tom has Countryman contact mikes taped to the inside shell
 and a Sennheiser 421 mike for the top head. The floor tom is miked with
 just the 421. The toms are slightly muffled with Green Bay paper towels
 -- Weinberg insists on that brand.<br>
<br>
His stage snare is a 6.5" x 14" Pearl Snare, with a Diplomat snare head,
 and a Durotone batter head, miked inside with a Countryman, outside 
with a Shure SM81 and another Sennheiser 421 . (For recording, he 
prefers a black 5.5" x 14" snare.)<br>
<br>
Weinberg plays with Pro Mack 5B sticks (no varnish), uses a Cameo Chain 
pedal (squared off), a Pearl Hi Hat Stand and Pearl hardware. A custom 
welded roll bar holds his three Zildjian cymbals (18" crash, 21" ride 
and 20" medium thin crash), mikes (AKG451 EB CK-1 Cart, and 3 
Countrymen) and snare -- this eliminates mike and cymbal stands.<br>
<br>
"I've got four drums, " says Weinberg. "Anything more is redundant. Besides, I tend to trip over things."<br>
<br>
Garry Tallent: "I use a Music Man bass, with four strings (two of which I
 seldom use) -- they're D'Addario halfrounds. The only modification is a
 can of black lacquer. I've got a Countryman direct box. which is what 
everybody hears. Plus my own special Funky setup, which I've thought 
about long and hard for two years. It includes a solid state amplifier, 
Acoustic 320, with an equalizer that I never use, and four Music Man 
bass cabinets with 15" Lansings, which I never hear. The rest is up to 
God and Bruce Jackson."</div>

<br>
Author: Michael McGuire<br>
Source: RHETORICAL DIMENSIONS IN MEDIA: A CRITICAL CASEBOOK, edited by 
Martin J. Medhurst and Thomas Benson, Kendall/Hunt Publishing, Dubuque, 
Iowa, Second edition, 1991.<br>
 <br>
<br>
Investigation of the rhetorical dimensions of music and song is still in
 its infancy. The few studies that have been conducted to date focus 
primarily on social protest music; songs that are blatantly didactic in 
purpose, method, and content.(l) Consequently, artists perceived 
primarily as musicians rather than musical orators have received less 
attention than might otherwise be warranted. One such artist is Bruce 
Springsteen.<br>
<br>
During the week of October 27, 1975, Springsteen appeared on the covers 
of both Time and Newsweek where, among other accolades, he was 
proclaimed the new Bob Dylan.(2) That same year John Landau, music 
editor of Rolling stone, wrote: "I have seen the future of rock 'n roll,
 and its name is Bruce Springsteen."(3) Over a decade later, Springsteen
 remains a rock phenomenon. His concerts are sellouts and his album 
sales run into the hundreds of thousands. He is on the verge of becoming
 a cultural myth as well as a rock legend. References to "the Boss" 
punctuate primetime television, and an educational album featuring 
"Bruce Stringbean" has been produced by Jim Henson and the Muppets.<br>
<br>
In this essay I offer a rhetorical analysis of the three themes that 
bind together most of Springsteen's music: despair, optimism, and 
responsibility. To understand Springsteen's message is not only to 
recognize these central themes, but to appreciate the complex, 
dialectical relationships between and among them. We will focus on three
 of Springsteen's most popular albums: Born to Run (1975), Darkness on 
the Edge of Town (1978), and The River (1980).(4) Realizing that lyrics 
cannot be criticized *in vacuo* as if they were poetry independent of 
important musical accompaniment, we will observe relationships between 
the words and music. However, our purpose is to uncover the synthesis 
Springsteen structures among his three major themes of despair, 
optimism, and responsibility by observing first the nature of each theme
 and then their interrelationships.<br>
<br>
A few words about our method of inquiry are in order at the outset. We 
will not focus on the chronological growth of Springsteen as an artist 
or the sequential development of his music, as if we saw it reaching 
toward some goal or endpoint. Such discussions could prove interesting 
and valuable, and popular authors have been providing them to 
demonstrate Springsteen's development, especially as a composer and 
producer.(5) But with contemporary rock music we confront an art form 
especially suited to nonsequential analysis. The average rock album 
contains from eight to twelve songs, and even when we consider what has 
come to he called a "concept album," there is not usually a necessary 
sequence of songs.(6) The "concept" generally is one of instrumental or 
lyrical unity which does not require serial or diachronic presentation 
to he grasped. To grasp the thematic unity of a single rock album often 
requires a restructuring of its units; the same observation applies to 
an attempt to isolate themes that recur in a number of albums.<br>
<br>
This sort of structuralist approach to rhetorical criticism has been 
both advocated and illustrated. In The Philosophy of Literary Form 
Kenneth Burke discusses finding "associational clusters" in artistic 
works and a process for examining such clusters to disclose "what goes 
with what."(7) The disclosure of clusters usually involves some 
deconstruction and reconstruction of an author's works to put together 
the parts of the clusters which fit thematically but not narratively. A 
similar process of reconstruction is the heart of structuralist 
criticism which seeks out thematic units and the relationships among 
them.(8)<br>
<br>
I<br>
<br>
To Springsteen fans it will come as no surprise that the musician offers
 pictures of despair as a form of social criticism. Such images are 
rendered subtle by their essentially individual, existential nature. 
Without becoming blatantly didactic and advocating changes or assigning 
blame, Springsteen sings of people in despair and the situations which 
have produced such an outcome. The label despair was chosen for the 
theme being reconstructed here because it best encompasses the breadth 
of images ranging from hopelessness to ennui from a deeply and 
personally felt despondency to a sort of bored surrender to the monotony
 of modern life. Springsteen's critical attitude toward these images 
will emerge in the analysis which follows and he discussed in summary; 
what remains by way of introduction is to comment about the narrative 
structures in this theme.<br>
<br>
Within the despair theme, we find both first and third person narration.
 Generally, first person narration conveys the extreme of hopelessness 
and third person shows people the singer regards as being in hopeless 
circumstances, whether they are aware of them or not. The songs which 
provide the images for this theme are not addressed to a specific 
person, but once or twice a comment is made to a specific woman within 
the narrative, and one first person plural is addressed to a friend 
named Eddie. We will consider first the more personal and extreme images
 of the despair theme.<br>
<br>
Broken loves and broken dreams and promises are the sources of some of 
the most intense expressions of despair in Springsteen's music. This 
deeply felt hopelessness is not always clearly attributed to a specific 
cause, unless we could say that high hopes dashed is the supreme cause 
from which all others follow. A convenient touchstone for the theme of 
despair is expressed in the intensity of feeling in "Streets of 
Fire."(9)<br>
<br>
"Streets of Fire" resembles some of Springsteen's earliest work in the 
sense that it does not offer narrative development, but only images of 
feelings. There is no story of "she done me wrong" or "the whole world 
is falling apart," but only one voice located in no particular time, 
place, or plot crying out about what happens when "you realize how they 
tricked you this time/And it's all lies." Neither "they" nor "it" is 
defined by any other part of the song; however, no mood of flaming 
paranoia is developed, either. The singer finds the world empty, but it 
may be the world of his own making, he says. That is, he tells us that 
when "the weak lies and cold walls you embrace/Eat at your insides and 
leave you face to face with/Streets of fire," that's when "you don't 
care anymore." In sum, there is a hopelessness to existence built on 
fabrication penned in by the coldness which only genuine emotions can 
thaw. But this singer finds nothing genuine: "I live now, only with 
strangers/I talk to only strangers/I walk with angels that have no 
place." Strangers are those we know only through lies, not "really." 
"Streets of Fire" is a metaphor for the isolation and desperation of 
anyone who ever felt totally betrayed. Its mood, considered lyrically, 
vocally, or instrumentally, ranges from soft and somber to intensely 
wailing.<br>
<br>
Just as "Streets of Fire" affirms no particular time or place, it 
expresses no particular cause of despair. The song offers a glimpse into
 the mind of a person betrayed and bitter. The song expresses a feeling;
 it does not tell any story. The effect of this unspecified situation 
may be to open up a universality by focusing, not on what makes us feel,
 but how we may feel, even if each for our own reasons. Life is often 
symbolized by travel, paths, or roads; the sojourner singing this song 
to us finds the trip sufficiently punishing to conceptualize it as 
"Streets of Fire," as he wanders "a loser down these tracks." The music 
sets the mood for us to receive this unhappy, anguished message. 
"Streets of Fire" is a reminder that things and people are not always 
what they seem, and that betrayal may lead one to a false consciousness 
or bad faith ("the weak lies and cold walls you embrace") resulting 
ultimately in despair.<br>
<br>
Not all despair is inflicted on us by others, however. Most people can 
relate to the experience of feeling betrayed, but an even more common 
experience may be the disappointment of unfulfilled hopes. Springsteen 
tells his audience about dreams, in connection with despair, dreams that
 do not come true. Two examples of this rhetoric are especially clear. 
The song, "Racing in the Street" is the story of a man who competes for 
money by racing his car in the streets.(10) The racer seems to assert 
that he has triumphed over problems that others experience, primarily 
boring lives. He will "only run for the money, got no strings attached."
 But this very quality, built carefully in details for the first two 
thirds of the song, gives way to an ironic and tragic picture. Suddenly 
there is mention of a woman he met "on the strip three years ago/In a 
Camaro with this dude from L.A." When he won the race, of which he 
boasts, she rode away with him. It was, we gather, her dream to ride to 
the top with the winner, and it was a mistake: "But now there's wrinkles
 around my baby's eyes/And she cries herself to sleep at night." Here is
 a rhetoric, not of betrayal, but of misperception and wrong 
expectations; he still has "got no strings attached" because he never 
promised them to her. Her despair is described as total:<br>
<br>
She sits on the porch of her daddy's house<br>
But all her pretty dreams are torn,<br>
She stares off alone into the night<br>
With the eyes of one who hates for just being born.<br>
<br>
Her life's streets aren't for racing; they are dead ends. Her life is so
 awful to her with her dreams ended that she "hates for just being 
born."<br>
<br>
He is aware of her plight and understands it. In the next section of the
 song he holds out some hope of fulfilling her dreams: "Tonight my baby 
and me are gonna ride to the sea/And wash these sins off our hands." But
 that expression is spoken, not to the woman, but to the song's 
audience. That it is a hollow promise is made clear by the final chorus 
telling us, "summer's here and the time is right/For racin' in the 
street." We can only expect the situation shown to us to continue 
unchanged; the very thing which makes him feel alive has destroyed her. 
This slowpaced, somewhat mournful song matches lyrical tragedy with 
instrumental and vocal sadness. The tone is more thoughtful or 
meditative than sympathetic; that is, our narrator understands the 
woman's plight and even its origins. Yet his analysis of the situation 
is selfcentered:<br>
<br>
Some guys they just give up living<br>
And start dying little by little, piece by piece,<br>
Some guys come home from work and wash up,<br>
And go racin' in the street.<br>
<br>
Our narrator is unwilling to die in a mundane life; the result is that 
his woman suffers while he goes "racin' in the street." The situation is
 not a betrayal; it is a case of delusion which has run its course, 
leaving nothing.<br>
<br>
The two examples of despair we have examined thus far show us the 
personal, experienced, or felt side of despair. These descriptions have 
two rhetorical qualities. First, the sound and meaning of each song are 
expressive of how hopelessness feels--both can serve a cathartic 
function for some audiences. Second, both songs can serve rhetorically 
as warnings. Neither picture is a happy one: the singer of "Streets of 
Fire" and the woman in "Racing in the Street" have given up on life. The
 audience, while invited to look at despair, is simultaneously cautioned
 against it. Nevertheless, the examples we have considered thus far are 
intensely personal statements of feelings. Somewhat different from these
 personalized accounts are Springsteen's descriptions of how social 
systems and expectations can wear people down.<br>
<br>
One of Springsteen's most vivid descriptions of the endless ennui which 
can overtake and numb people in mass society is ''Factory.''(11) A 
poignant, third person narrative, "Factory" is the story of "man," whose
 life is started every day by the factory whistle he hears telling him 
it's time to get up: "Man rises from bed and puts on his clothes,/Man 
takes his lunch, walks out in the morning light/It's the working, the 
working, just the working life." The man is summoned into his repetitive
 routine as another faceless, lunchboxcarrying blue collar worker.(12) 
The motivation for "man" to walk through the "mansions of fear" and 
"mansions of pain" is the same as most of his kind: "Factory takes his 
hearing, factory gives him life." The kind of life it provides is 
suggested again by the last verse of the song; the factory whistle 
"cries" out the end of another day, and: "Men walk through these gates 
with death in their eyes,/And you just better believe, boy, somebody's 
gonna get hurt tonight/lt's the working, the working, just the working 
life." The song is sung to the heat of a dirge, which reinforces the 
lyrical message of depression and monotony.<br>
<br>
This picture of despair is complex as it reveals how a social system can
 simultaneously support and crush someone. The singer feels despair for 
the worker who trudges dutifully, unthinkingly off to the job which 
deafens him, but puts groceries on his table; a job which provides his 
family with shelter from the weather and hunger, but not from his own 
rage or fists. "Factory" is a picture of how some people live in a 
contemporary, lower class, nottooquiet desperation. "Factory" is a 
protest against that lifestyle, but it is individual or existential, not
 social. We hear Springsteen sing mournfully and decide, "that life's 
not for me," but he never says "don't be like this," nor does he call 
upon Congressmen, Senators, workers, Americans, or anybody else. He just
 describes the desperate situation at the individual level. Neither 
music nor lyrics hint at any hope that this life will change. The 
repetitions in the chorus ("It's the working, the working, just the 
working life") reinforce the impressions of monotony and endlessness. 
The life of the factory worker is one of ennui--listlessness and 
dissatisfaction resulting from a total lack of interest.<br>
<br>
There are many more images and stories of despair in Springsteen's 
works, but we have seen examples of the two dominant types of despair 
with the limited examples we have considered. "Factory" is a criticism 
and rejection of "the working life" in assembly line plants; but this 
social criticism focuses on the effects of the social system on the 
individual and family. Springsteen's examples are not used to generalize
 about the whole society, but to illustrate one slice of life; and 
nowhere evident are the typical bombast and assignment of blame which 
characterize so much protest and propaganda music. The song remains 
within a single, existential universe which can be felt personally. In 
the last analysis, if blame is or can be assigned for the despair of 
"Factory" or "Streets of Fire" or other of Springsteen's songs, it 
appears to lie within the individual. Social systems ranging from 
factory labor to interpersonal commitment exert pressure on individuals 
to conform or surrender: "Some guys just give up living." But as 
Springsteen says to a victim in another song, "You took what you were 
handed and left behind what was asked/but what they asked, baby, wasn't 
right, you didn't have to live that life," and "did you forget how to 
love, girl, did you forget how to fight?''(13) Springsteen's socially 
critical images of despair acknowledge the pressures that can grind 
people down, but he does not absolve either the system or the individual
 of some responsibility for what happens. Whether the individual can 
triumph over social systems is a question not answered by the songs in 
which the despair themes appear. But individual triumph is the very core
 of the optimism which other Springsteen songs depict, and it is to 
those we turn now.<br>
<br>
II<br>
<br>
A buoyant optimism pervades some of Springsteen's music and lyrics, 
telling us "that it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive.''(14) 
Springsteen advocates saying "yes" to a life infused with value. 
Optimism is a theme built on images of hopefulness, success, and 
independence. Here feelings of power and pictures of overcoming 
dominate. That a rhetoric of approval is operating is signaled by the 
exclusive reliance on first person narrative; the singer is himself 
involved in these messages. The dominant sources and expressions of 
optimism in Springsteen's music contrast sharply and directly with the 
causes of despair. These songs explore the promise of love, in contrast 
to the broken promises and shattered dreams we saw leading to despair. 
Here are songs which declare an escape from and break with the monotony 
of daily working life--not surrender to modern life, but triumph over 
it. These two different optimistic tendencies very frequently occur 
within a single song, and sometimes in direct comparison with despair.<br>
<br>
One of the songs that reveals the promise of love and the strength to 
conquer a reality that drags others down is "Thunder Road.''(15) The 
herosinger of "Thunder Road" addresses his message to Mary, whom he is 
trying to persuade to run away with him. As the narration opens, the 
singer has come to Mary's house where, appropriately, she is dancing to 
Roy Orbison's "Only the Lonely," which is playing on the radio:<br>
<br>
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely <br>
Hey that's me and I want you only<br>
Don't turn me home again <br>
I just can't face myself alone again.<br>
<br>
Loneliness, especially like that felt by the singer of "Streets of 
Fire," is a source of despair for which the solution is companionship. 
The singer claims that only Mary's companionship will help him and his 
comments illustrate that an ongoing relationship of some kind exists 
which he wants to escalate. He urges her:<br>
<br>
Don't run back inside <br>
Darling you know just what I'm here for <br>
So you're scared and you're thinking <br>
That maybe we ain't that young anymore <br>
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night <br>
You ain't a beauty, but hey you're alright <br>
Oh and that's alright with me.<br>
<br>
Again we see that some continuity of relationship between the two 
exists, so she knows exactly what he wants--to run off with total 
commitments. People might tend to associate such an impulse or desire 
with youthfulness; Springsteen attributes such a skepticism to Mary, but
 offers the rebuttal, "Show a little faith, there's magic in the night."
 Even if broken dreams and promises lead to despair, we are told that 
dreams and promises are our hope.<br>
<br>
Dreams and promises hold out hope for the future only if one can 
overcome both dwelling on the past and dreaming of perfection. He tells 
her:<br>
<br>
You can hide 'neath your covers <br>
And study your pain <br>
Make crosses from your lovers <br>
Throw roses in the rain <br>
Waste your summer praying in vain <br>
For a saviour to rise from these streets.<br>
<br>
But he does not advocate that she crucify herself on a cross of lost 
love or dwell on her pain, hoping for the perfect saviour. Instead, he 
says, "I'm no hero," and "All the redemption I can offer girl/Is beneath
 this dirty hood." He urges her, however, to take the chance and go with
 him:<br>
<br>
With a chance to make it good somehow <br>
Hey what else can we do now <br>
Except roll down the window <br>
And let the wind blow Back your hair.<br>
<br>
The answer is to leave, and he urges her on. "These two lanes will take 
us anywhere," and what he has in mind is "heaven's waiting on down the 
tracks." He says he is "riding out tonight to case the promised land." 
This theme of escaping is stated clearly and powerfully in the last two 
lines of "Thunder Road": "It's a town full of losers/And I'm pulling out
 of here to win." Those lines are sung in a confident and loud voice, 
and followed by a triumphant saxophone solo to reinforce the mood of 
power and success. The individual plans to escape the sort of mundane 
existence of "Factory" and the pain of "Streets of Fire." Finally, the 
song offers other lyrical evidence that these are not young people or 
people lacking a long history together. The singer, urging Mary to take 
the chance with him, tells her "we got one last chance to make it real,"
 and he acknowledges, "I know it's late we can make it if we run."<br>
<br>
In sum, "Thunder Road" is a picture of someone believing that escape is 
the route to happiness. He is optimistic that heaven awaits if he can 
run away with Mary and escape the "town full of losers" like the man in 
"Factory." "Thunder Road" is representative of Springsteen's approach to
 optimism. On the same album, the title song, "Born to Run," contains 
the same themes. The man singing is tired of a life in which "In the day
 we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream" and a town 
which "rips the bones from your back/It's a death trap, it's a suicide 
rap." Like the singer of "Thunder Road" he is sure that "Someday, girl, I
 don't know when, we're gonna get to that place/Where we really want to 
go/And we'll walk in the sun." He adds the refrain, "But till then 
tramps like us/Baby, we were born to run," suggesting that he sees the 
need to flee a desperate situation and look for something better. Both 
songs offer the audience optimism about the chances of the singer's 
success, and both bind the optimism to a love relationship.<br>
<br>
As the despair found in Springsteen's music is not necessarily 
loverelated, so neither is the optimism imagery necessarily contingent 
upon such relationships. The singer of "The Promised Land" has in mind 
no relationship, but a break with a deadend life that has no more 
specific goal than "the promised land.''(16) The singer seems to view 
his life as one that has been aimless and over which he needs to exert 
control. He says he has been "just killing time/Working all day in my 
daddy's garage/Driving all night, chasing some mirage/Pretty soon little
 girl I'm gonna take charge." If this singer can take charge he will he 
doing more than the man in "Factory." A dream of control lures him away 
from his misery, as described by the song's chorus:<br>
<br>
The dogs on main street howl, 'cause they understand, <br>
If I could take one moment into my hands Mister, <br>
I ain't a boy, no, I'm a man, <br>
And I believe in a promised land.<br>
<br>
What the dogs on main street must understand is that our singer has been
 living their kind of life. That life is like the lives of those in 
despair.<br>
<br>
The singer has been trying to "live the right way" by getting up and 
going to work like the man in "Factory." He cannot give in, however:<br>
<br>
But your eyes go blind and your blood runs cold <br>
Sometimes I feel so weak I just want to explode <br>
Explode and tear this town apart <br>
Take a knife and cut this pain from my heart <br>
Find somebody itching for something to start<br>
<br>
His weaknesses are caused by conforming to the work and the town instead
 of following his own instincts to escape. Surrender to these social 
systems is weakness; strength can be felt only in opposing them. His 
opposition is expressed by his resolve to leave: "I packed my bags and 
I'm heading straight into the storm." The storm he sees ahead is, 
perhaps, reflective of himself--a "twister to blow everything down":<br>
<br>
Blow away the dreams that tear you apart <br>
Blow away the dreams that break your heart <br>
Blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and brokenhearted.<br>
<br>
Those lines are followed by the chorus and refrain, "I believe in a 
promised land." The promised land is different from other dreams and 
lies. The twister, the storm envisioned by our singer, will blow away 
everything "that ain't got the faith to stand its ground." In "The 
Promised Land" we see, as we did in the despair imagery, that some 
dreams are hollow, some promises broken, some faith misplaced. What has 
"the faith to stand its ground" endures, and that is the promised land. 
Faith in the self has strength, while faith in the "runaway American 
dream" or the factory is bad faith which leads to despair.<br>
<br>
In stark contrast to the images of despair, the optimism we have found 
in Springsteen's music suggests that the chance for happiness is not out
 of reach. Perhaps it is more to the point to observe that Springsteen 
describes feelings of intense despair and feelings of enthusiastic 
optimism. Both are part of the human situation, and if despair is 
optimism's failure, optimism is also the drive to escape despair. 
Springsteen shows us a powerful, optimistic faith in the self and the 
ability to escape the loneliness of life without love, as well as the 
boring depression of life servicing machines or false dreams. "Thunder 
Road" and "Born to Run" show the hopefulness of strength to love and be 
loved--at least, gladly to take the risk, if blindly, too. "The Promised
 Land" shows the optimism with which we all may start journeys, real or 
metaphorical, to escape from slavery and misery into freedom and 
joy.(17) Optimism in Springsteen's music is a theme with recurrent 
images of strength of self and triumph of the individual. There are many
 optimistic songs on Springsteen's albums and they all emphasize either 
success at love or the achievement of independence. Yet success at love 
and the achievement of independence do not come free of charge in this 
life. The third major theme of Springsteen's musical rhetoric is a theme
 of responsibility and realism to which we now turn our attention.<br>
<br>
III<br>
<br>
Between oppressive despair and enthusiastic optimism must lie some 
middle ground. At the very least we need to understand why particular 
people occupy either end of the continuum from despair to optimism. The 
answer lies in the third major theme of Springsteen's music, 
responsibility. Responsibility may seem an unlikely theme for music, but
 the theme as conceptualized here is hinted at by the songs we already 
have examined. Responsibility here refers to individual choice making 
and the need to acknowledge its twosided nature. On one hand, choice is a
 prerogative and privilege which allows us to seek rewards, and on the 
other hand, every choice precludes other possibilities, and so entails 
two prices: first, one loses the possibilities not selected; second, one
 must accept responsibility for one's own outcomes, good or had. 
Responsibility is first and foremost responsibility to one's self; the 
"responsibility" of the factory worker to others and his job is false, 
and produces despair. We will see that Springsteen challenges the 
individual to accept responsibility to the self as the necessary first 
step in escaping despair, and as a moderating check on naive optimism.<br>
<br>
In "Thunder Road," which we considered above, the singer is urging Mary 
to run away with him. We observed that the people in that song are not 
adolescents, but adults, in contrast to the couple in "Born to Run." One
 other sign of their maturity is what he says while urging her to get 
into his car:<br>
<br>
And my car's out back <br>
If you're ready to take that long walk <br>
From your front porch to my front seat <br>
The door's open but the ride it ain't free<br>
<br>
Those lines, while they are sufficient when understood literally, beg 
for a metaphoric or symbolic interpretation. How much Mary's front porch
 life is like that of the woman in "Racin' in the Street" is unclear, 
but it certainly represents her stable or stagnant past and present. And
 it's a long walk from one's own front porch to another's front seat; 
from the certainty of one lifestyle to the uncertainty of taking the 
chance on someone else. Even when the other opens wide the door, entry 
is never free; something must he lost, given up. The singer wants to 
persuade Mary that she is giving up something hopeless if she comes with
 him to chase a better life. Even in his optimistic message, assuring 
her they can make it to a promised land, he acknowledges that the ride 
ain't free. His plea to her is that she owes herself enough that she 
should go; what she will owe him when she does is unstated.<br>
<br>
A similar entreaty occurs in "Prove It All Night," when the singer tries
 to persuade a woman to run off with him for "a gold ring and pretty 
dress of blue.''(18) He wants "a kiss to seal our fate," and he 
acknowledges the price she must pay. After he tells her he knows she 
wants and deserves more than she has, he says:<br>
<br>
But if dreams came true, oh, wouldn't that he nice, <br>
But this ain't no dream we're living through tonight,<br>
Girl, you want it, you take it, you pay the price <br>
And prove it all night, prove it all night....<br>
<br>
That is not an altruistic offer, hut a proposal to trade; he wants her 
commitment to him, and not for a one night stand, but for life. And he 
tells her she will have to have strength to resist when she hears "the 
voices tell you not to go/They made their choices and they'll never 
know/. . . What it's like to live and die/To prove it all night...." 
Individuals' choices introduce the theme of responsibility in 
Springsteen's music as people are challenged to take risks and make 
strong decisions, even when those go against the grain of social mores.<br>
<br>
The clearest single illustration of the responsibility theme is 
Springsteen's "I Wanna Marry You.''(19) The song is a firstperson 
narrative addressed to a specific but unnamed woman in a situation not 
uncommon today. He tells her he sees her walking down the street with 
her baby carriage and knows that she is alone, and perhaps wants a man. 
As he sees her, she is unhappy:<br>
<br>
You never smile girl, you never speak <br>
You just walk on by, darlin', week after week <br>
Raising two kids alone in this mixed up world <br>
Must be a lonely life for a working girl<br>
<br>
In spite of the implication that he does not know her well--if at 
all--the chorus asserts repeatedly, "Little girl, I wanna marry you." 
Furthermore, his proposal explains at length his very realistic 
attitudes toward the situation:<br>
<br>
Now, honey, I don't wanna clip your wings <br>
But a time comes when two people should think of these things <br>
Having a home and a family <br>
Facing up to their responsibilities <br>
They say in the end true love prevails <br>
But in the end true love can't be no fairytale <br>
To say I'll make your dreams come true would be wrong <br>
But maybe, darlin', I could help them along<br>
<br>
His modest proposal merits our consideration.<br>
<br>
In contrast to a "promised land," the singer offers facing up to the 
responsibilities of family, which the woman already has. Facing reality 
is the entire point of his proposal: "true love can't be no fairytale," 
and he knows he can't make dreams come true. Here is a rhetoric of 
moderation and realism; we can, after all, help each other toward many 
of the goals we set in life, even though we cannot make life perfect.<br>
<br>
Not all responsibility is responsibility to others; as the introduction 
to this section of our exploration observed, the self is a central 
concern of the images which make up the theme of responsibility. 
"Independence Day" expresses most clearly an individual's decision to 
act against a social system and in behalf of himself.(20) Both personal 
and social pressures are involved in the singer's decision to leave home
 and hometown:<br>
<br>
Cause the darkness of this house has got the best of us <br>
There's a darkness in this town that's got us too <br>
But they can't touch me now <br>
And you can't touch me now <br>
They ain't gonna do to me <br>
What I watched them do to you<br>
<br>
Our best referent for what they did to the father being addressed is the
 picture of the man in "Factory." We are told in the same song that our 
singer is not alone, that "There's a lot of people leaving town now." 
The singer does not dwell on his inability to get along with his father,
 but observes:<br>
<br>
Now I don't know what it always was with us <br>
We chose the words, and yeah, we drew the lines <br>
There was just no way this house could hold the two of us <br>
I guess that we were just too much of the same kind<br>
<br>
That observation acknowledges responsibility, shared responsibility, for
 what has happened to the two: "yeah, we drew the lines."<br>
<br>
The singer is leaving for reasons both personal and external. 
Responsible to and for himself, he acknowledges that "It's Independence 
Day all boys must run away," and "All men must make their way come 
Independence Day." To grow up strong enough to set out on life's roads 
alone is natural. Leaving the nest may be accelerated by extrafamilial 
factors: "Because there's just different people coming down here now and
 they see things in different ways/And soon everything we've known will 
just be swept away." As the world changes, responsible people must 
somehow make significant changes for their own well being. The man 
declaring that it's independence day is not running blindly out of fear,
 nor is he leaving with a declared expectation of finding heaven. He's 
just got to go.<br>
<br>
The responsibility theme, then, shows pictures of responsibility both to
 others and to self. That is not said to imply that responsibility 
toward others excludes or precludes responsibility toward self. Rather, 
within the theme of responsibility in Springsteen's music we have found 
acknowledgement that there are always prices one must pay to he free or 
to he committed. Above all, the choice must be conscious and deliberate.
 The man leaving home in "Independence Day" is exhibiting responsibility
 no less than the man singing "I Wanna Marry You," but the two are in 
very different circumstances. In fact, one way for us usefully to view 
the responsibility theme is to see it as a mediator of the contradiction
 between optimism and despair. That view will establish the 
relationships among the themes we have been examining in Springsteen's 
music.<br>
<br>
IV<br>
<br>
What has gone before has established three themes that emerge with 
clarity from Springsteen's music: despair, optimism, and responsibility.
 But in at least two ways, that view is incomplete. First, the overall 
rhetoric of Springsteen's music is more complex than these themes alone;
 the interactions among them are necessary to understand the total 
picture. Second, analysis at the thematic level necessarily neglects 
other things which may be of value. The second of these issues we will 
address below; here it remains to conclude thematic analysis by putting 
together the three themes we have isolated.<br>
<br>
By any yardstick, despair and optimism are contradictory. Two of the 
songs we chose to illustrate despair, "Streets of Fire" and "Factory," 
seem to offer no connection with optimism except contradiction. "Racing 
in the Street," on the other hand, afforded us a view of a situation in 
which one man's optimism and life caused one woman's despair. One 
connection between despair and optimism is their dialectical necessity 
to one another; that is, without high hope there can be no contrasting 
despair, and vice versa. But that is a simple, perhaps obvious 
connection, and one based upon abstract form, not concrete content. 
Springsteen's pictures of optimism and despair suggest an unusual set of
 causal relationships.<br>
<br>
First, both despair and optimism may he brought about by the same 
things. The deeply felt despair of "Streets of Fire" and "Racing in the 
Street" has the same root cause as the optimism of "Thunder Road" and 
"Born to Run": the quest for love as salvation. To be sure, we are shown
 different stages of the quest. Second, the form of despair we saw in 
"Factory" and called ennui plays a role in the songs about optimism. The
 singer of both "Thunder Road" and "Born to Run" wants to grab love and 
leave the "town full of losers," the "death trap," before he gets stuck 
in a "Factory" lifestyle. Like the singer of "The Promised Land," he 
believes that just getting up and going to work every day is not all 
there should he to life. The voice speaking to us out of the songs of 
optimism encourages us to dream and promise, and to flee, to run, in 
pursuit of those dreams and promises. But if we do, as we just observed 
above, we may end up feeling that "it's all lies." Nonetheless, the 
ennui and unhappiness lying about on the edges of the optimism theme 
play a motivating role for characters developed there.<br>
<br>
How can we say that the contradictory nature and mutual causation of 
optimism and despair are mediated by the theme of responsibility? First,
 both despair and optimism as presented in Springsteen's songs are 
extreme. On that very quality hinges at least a substantial part of 
their mutually causal relationship. To illustrate, we would have to say 
that only the dashing of very high hopes would cause one to "stare off 
alone into the night with the eyes of one who hates for just being 
born"; and likewise, the powerful hope of "Born to Run" is strengthened 
or made more extreme because the place--the life--that has to he escaped
 is "a death trap, a suicide rap," and not merely a minor irritant. The 
themes of optimism and despair are extreme, and so is the music to which
 they are set: "Factory" is a dirge, while "Born to Run" sounds like an 
accelerating motor.<br>
<br>
Between these extremes is set the possibility of something more calm, 
which we have argued is a theme of responsibility. Between "Streets of 
Fire" and "The Promised Land" is reality. That is not to deny the 
reality or the legitimacy of feelings of despair or optimism, but to 
underscore that the very unreality of the most extreme dreams is what 
prevents their realization and fulfillment: such extremes are certainly 
real inside the head, but the impossibility of a promised land is 
exactly what leads to despair. Springsteen expresses a more responsible 
view: "To say I'll make your dreams come true would be wrong/But maybe, 
darlin', I could help them along."<br>
<br>
The other principal component of the responsibility theme is 
acknowledgment of choice. The relationship of choice to despair and 
optimism is complicated. The images of despair involve people who have 
refused or denied choice. That is, the man in "Streets of Fire" blames 
others ("they tricked you") for his condition; the man in "Factory" 
lives in bad faith, allowing the employment machine to dictate his life 
instead of choosing it. These people are like those Springsteen mentions
 in "Racing in the Street": "Some guys they just give up living/And 
start dying little by little, piece by piece." Viewed from this 
perspective, the perspective of choosing, the people in despair have 
given up their prerogative to choose, and are denying life. Within the 
songs making up the despair theme we are invited to adopt a sympathetic 
view to the man ground down by the factory or the man whose life is 
nothing but streets of fire. From the perspective of responsibility and 
choice, however, we are given a less sympathetic perspective.<br>
<br>
The songs which make up the optimism theme share a more complex 
relationship with the issue of choice. In these songs we seem to hear 
someone choosing and asserting strength of life. The men in "Born to 
Run" and "Thunder Road" are telling women of two choices: first, the 
choice to leave the place where they are, and second, the choice of a 
woman companion. The man in "Promised Land" is so angry with his place 
that he wants "to explode," and so is leaving. We seem invited to 
approve these instincts of strength and the choice to say, "It's a town 
full of losers/And I'm pulling out of here to win." But when we consider
 these messages within the vision of responsibility and choice, we may 
see a different picture. These people are running away in pursuit of 
unrealities--of "heaven waiting on down the tracks" and "the promised 
land." In contrast, the young man in "Independence Day" is simply 
leaving, and keeps imploring his father, "Just say goodbye, it's 
Independence Day." He doesn't describe the place he is leaving with 
hatred at all. And the man in "I Wanna Marry You" isn't running away at 
all; he believes life can he improved, but dreams can't come true. In 
sum, the characters expressing optimism have had their choices dictated 
to them by running away and not toward. And they are chasing dreams in 
their flight, not working to improve real situations. The optimistic 
characters appear irresponsible when we consider them in this light.<br>
<br>
What, then, shall we say about the thematic quality of Springsteen's 
musical rhetoric? Above all, we must not emphasize the posture of 
advocate in Springsteen's music. Springsteen describes the three themes 
we have examined, but he does not prescribe any of them explicitly or 
condemn any of them. Springsteen's approach is to show the audience 
possibilities, not to tell his hearers what to think or do. This is a 
narrative rhetoric, not a didactic one. Its thematic unity and focus are
 derived from the very different subjectivities of despair, optimism, 
and responsibility being displayed vividly for our examination. Whether 
these are our only alternatives is moot; that they are possible 
attitudes toward life is what is important. These feelings may be 
unavoidable for adults to experience at some time. That fact may account
 for a certain ambivalence on the part of audience and artist toward the
 themes. It also points us toward considering, by way of conclusion, 
what sort of audience is invited by these themes, and what aspects of 
music, especially Springsteen's, are not disclosed fully by thematic 
analysis.<br>
<br>
V<br>
<br>
Both the complexity of Springsteen's message and the themes themselves 
define and limit his audience. Springsteen's message does not have 
meaning for adolescents or children; an adult audience may relate to 
lines like, "I lost my money and I lost my wife/Them things don't seem 
to matter much to me now," but high school students are not likely 
to.(21) Stylistic detail and thematic force solicit the identification 
of an adult audience. Yet in stylistic details or background, 
Springsteen also excludes many adults.<br>
<br>
The stylistic details of Springsteen's musical rhetoric center around 
urban American lower class people and values. Gangs meet "'neath that 
giant Exxon sign"; one man's sixtynine Chevy waits outside the 711 
store; downtown "the black and whites . . . cruise by"; Roy Orbison is 
on the radio; and "In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a 
runaway American dream." Album and song titles also suggest America: on 
Greetings from Ashury Park, N.J. is "Mary Queen of Arkansas"; on Born to
 Run is "Thunder Road"; on Darkness on the Edge of Town is "Racing in 
the Street"; on The River is "Cadillac Ranch"; on Nebraska, in addition 
to the title song, is "Atlantic City." The background images of 
Springsteen's lyrics are not universal. Millions of Americans can relate
 to racing in the street in a '69 Chevy with a 396, but the imagery 
would be lost on many foreigners; there are not many 711 stores outside 
the United States; and Cadillac Ranch is a freakish exhibit of cars nose
 down in the dirt near Amarillo, Texas. While these images of American 
scenes may trigger sweeping meanings for listeners familiar with the 
movie Thunder Road or Roy Orbison's "Only the Lonely," they are not 
Springsteen's focus. Springsteen's rhetoric is not centered around fast 
cars and street life; those are elements of the background in which 
people find themselves. They do lend a sense of concrete reality to the 
lyrics, and are interesting for us as detail; but they are setting, not 
action. Springsteen is not writing idylls.<br>
<br>
In addition to the many specifically American references, Springsteen 
has a focus on lower class people. These are people who drive to the 
unemployment office, live on welfare checks, load crates on the dock, 
work in a factory. Readers will have noticed the frequency of 
ungrammatical language in the passages explicated in this essay. The 
language of the lower class American is full of the casual contraction 
"ain't" and double negatives; it is in that language that Springsteen 
writes, which makes his work all the more amazing or impressive. There 
may be much ungrammatical in his lyrics, but he is not inarticulate or 
unimaginative.<br>
<br>
Springsteen writes about what he knows first hand. The themes, 
background, and emotions reflect his background and life. The audience 
that identifies most with his rhetoric is made up of people close to his
 own age (41 in 1990) who are familiar with urban, lower class, American
 street life. Springsteen's audience consists of people who like rock 'n
 roll music and concerts. Concert audiences demonstrate high familiarity
 with his music. During his 1978 tour when playing "Thunder Road," he 
would stop after the line "So you're scared and you're thinking that 
maybe we ain't that young any more" and point his microphone at the 
audience, which would chant the next lines: "Show a little faith, 
there's magic in the night/You ain't a beauty but, hey you're 
alright."(22) Springsteen's audience evidences knowledge of his lyrical 
message.<br>
<br>
We have been able here to catch only a glimpse of the rhetorical aspects
 of music not written expressly to advocate social changes. Springsteen 
serves as an example of a broader phenomenon. Music expresses meanings, 
especially lyrically, in which act it becomes rhetorical. Music 
functions both as an expression of the artist and as an invitation to 
the audience to identify with the themes, ideas, and emotions expressed.
 If rhetoric is conceptualized either as constructing or interpreting 
reality, music is a powerful part of that process, even when it is not 
part of a propaganda or agitative campaign. Springsteen's music is one 
example of the rhetorical potentialities of nondidactic lyrics, and as 
such merits continued investigation.<br>

JOURNAL OF SPEECH 69 (1983), 114. Most of these studies deal minimally, 
if at all, with music. Irvine and Kirkpatrick suggest that the 
interaction of lyrical and musical elements should be studied, but they 
don't do so; Booth observes that lyrics have to live with music and 
should not be evaluated independent of that fact; Gonzalez and Makay 
provide a few guitar chords Dylan plays, but their descriptions of 
instrumentals (p. 13) are too brief and undescriptive to capture the 
sound one would hear. In defense of the studies mentioned, most focus on
 protest or propaganda music in which, to paraphrase Booth, the music as
 music is the lesser half at best. Springsteen has a message, but he is 
first and last a musician; he is nowhere the social protester in the 
classic sense, as our analysis will reveal.<br>
In the week of October 27, 1975, Time ran its story, "Backstreet Phantom
 of Rock," and Newsweek, adopting a slightly different angle, printed 
"Making of a Rock Star." Over the weeks following, both magazines were 
deluged in mail about their matching cover stories, and the editors were
 prompted to reply. There had been only four previous instances of Time 
and Newsweek having the same cover story (other than political stories).
 On November 17, 1975, letters to Newsweek included these comments: "Why
 not put a picture of the real Bob Dylan on your cover instead of an 
imitation named Springsteen?" "We cannot understand why a prestigious 
magazine of your calibre will waste its cover on a 'freak' like Bruce 
Springsteen." "It was a pleasure to see Newsweek take the initiative and
 do a cover story on the most deserving Bruce Springsteen. Maybe now 
he'll receive the recognition he's earned." One week later, a reader 
consoled the editors, "Take it easy don't worry about your recent cover 
matchup with Time. It simply proves the point that Bruce Springsteen is a
 new rock 'n roll sensation." Letters to Time were similar in the 
November 17 issue: "I am beginning to wonder about the intellect of 
Time's editors when they are so quick to put a mushmouthed, offkey 
nothing like Bruce Springsteen on their cover and yet take five years to
 bestow that honor on the one who deserves it most--Elton John." "Please
 do not imply that American youth is eating up the products of 'rock's 
new sensation.' I am not." "Bruce Springsteen is a living example of 
Longfellow's, 'All things come round to him who will but wait! "'<br>
The letters are revealing to those who know about Springsteen's career 
and music. Both studio hype and early critical attention compared 
Springsteen with Dylan. Peter Gambaccini, Bruce Springsteen (New York: 
Quick Fox, 1979), p. 31 observes, "The 'new Dylan' tag on Springsteen 
began early; indeed, it was so prevalent that Dylan . . . was at times 
referred to as 'the old Springsteen."' Some people resented the 
comparison. Springsteen's physical appearance resembled Dylan in 1973, 
although by 1975 he had a somewhat harder, urban look which some people 
may have found freakish. The young man who complained to Time that 
American youth was not enthralled with Springsteen reflected the fact 
that Springsteen's music appeals to an older crowd than most pop or rock
 music. We will consider that fact later in this essay.<br>
Landau quoted in Gambaccini, Springsteen, p. 50.<br>
By 1983, Springsteen had released six albums: Greetings from Asbury 
Park, N.J., Columbia Records, KC 31903, 1973; The Wild, The Innocent, 
and The E Street Shuffle, Columbia Records, KC 32432, 1973; Born to Run,
 Columbia Records, PC 33795, 1975; Darkness on the Edge of Town, 
Columbia Records, JC 35318, 1978; The River, Columbia Records, PC2 
36854,1 980; Nebraska, Columbia Records, TC 38358, 1982. Lyrics quoted 
are taken from printed lyric sheets accompanying the albums, even when 
those differ slightly from what is sung on the album; E Street Shuffle 
does not have a printed lyric page. Also in my possession are illegally 
reproduced tapes and records which cannot be identified practically. 
Such widely available "bootleg" recordings are of concerts and 
interviews, e.g., in San Francisco and Cleveland during 1978.<br>
See, for example, Gambaccini.<br>
An exception would be Tommy, MCA Records, MCA210005, 1972 (previously Decca, DXSW7205), a rock opera by The Who.<br>

The faceless "man" is Springsteen's own father, as the line "See my 
daddy walking through them factory gates in the rain" suggests. In 
concert, Springsteen introduces this song by talking about his childhood
 and his father.<br>
"Point Blank," The River.<br>
"Badlands," Darkness on the Edge of Town.<br>
Born to Run.<br>
Darkness on the Edge of Town.<br>
Springsteen's music contains abundant Biblical imagery which an 
Aristotelian analysis undoubtedly would connect with his childhood in 
Catholic schools. There are many references to "promised land" and 
"angels," one song on Darkness on the Edge of Town is called "Adam 
Raised a Cain." These details may be important, but they lie in the 
background of the music, and this method of reconstruction cannot deal 
with them adequately.<br>

Field Test," HUMAN COMMUNICATION RESEARCH, 3 (1977), 243-249.</div>

Born Again<br>
<br>
by Mans Ivarsson<br>
<br>
On the eve of his world tour, Bruce Springsteen sat down in Stockholm, 
Sweden, to discuss his new band, his new albums and his new life â€“ no 
longer a frustrated kid aching to get out on the road, he's now a family
 man with a new sense of his place in the world.<br>
<br>
by Mans Ivarsson, "Beats," August 1992, Volume 16, Issue 174<br>
<br>
In spite of the less than spectacular sales of his two latest albums, in
 spite of the ignominy of being elbowed out of the charts by backwards -
 dressing youngsters Kris Kross, in spite of the fact that a lot has 
happened in the music world since Born ln The U.S.A. â€“ in spite of all 
that, Bruce Springsteen is still Bruce Springsteen, and his live show is
 still a major event. Springsteen's current world tour kicked off in 
Stockholm, Sweden, on June 15. On the eve of the first show, Springsteen
 sat down to talk about his new albums, his new tour, his new band and 
his new life, as a happily married husband and father of two.<br>
<br>
During the tour rehearsals Springsteen had 10 musicians surrounding him,
 as well as a large team of light and sound technicians. At all times he
 seemed very aware of every tiny detail of how each and every one of all
 those people performed their tasks. He's in control, and has very firm 
opinions on just about everything - from what color the spotlights 
should be to every beat on the hi-hat. Afterwards, in the dressing room,
 however, he downplayed that aspect of himself.<br>
<br>
"What happens is, the whole thing up there is an organism," he explains.
 "I'm standing up there letting the whole thing roll over me, and I feel
 instinctively if something isn't right â€“ like a spotlight, for example.
 I mean I know these songs â€“ I wrote them! â€“ and if you listen closely 
enough, the songs will tell you what the character is like, how it ought
 to be lit and so on.<br>
<br>
"But songs tend to change with time. Like 'Born to Run,' for example. To
 me today it has turned into a song about spiritual things, like how you
 find some place that feels like home to you."<br>
<br>
Why start the tour off in Stockholm?<br>
<br>
"Stockholm and Sweden have been fantastic to us," he says. "I will never
 forget the Konserthuset in 1975. That was my first tour outside the 
States. We had started off in London, which was pretty tough going; the 
audience was sheer ice. Then we came to Stockholm and the audience went 
completely wild. It was the first time that I had stood in front of a 
truly enthusiastic audience. Unforgettable.<br>
<br>
For the first time since their breakthrough to mass popularity, Bruce 
will be touring without his legendary E-Street Band. "It was time for a 
change, time to move on," is his brief explanation. The result is that 
Springsteen has created his biggest group ever, consisting of 11 people,
 seven of whom are black and five are women. That makes for a most 
unlikely collaboration: a rock group and a gospel choir. For the first 
one or two numbers the combination is a little strange. But hearing the 
choir accompaniment to the classics "Born In The U.S.A." and "Glory 
Days" makes it clear that Bruce Springsteen has had a stroke of genius.<br>
<br>
How do you get the audience to forget the old, beloved E Street Band? 
You replace it with a gospel choir that gives the choruses such power 
that everyone in the hall stands up to sing along. The latest recruit is
 Crystal Talifiero on voice, guitar and percussion, whose performance is
 likely to make her Bruce's most visible companion onstage.<br>
<br>
Is there any significance in the fact that nearly half the band is 
female? "Quite a lot, in fact," Springsteen replies. "My wife Patti 
joined the E Street Band back in 1985 and around that time, 1984-6, I 
discovered things in life that no school had ever taught me to cope 
with. I had never learned how you get on with women! And with this new 
band I felt, hey, I don't want to work with a boys' club any longer, you
 know, rock groups tend to be some sort of macho street gang, very 
masculine. And I thought of bands like Sly &amp; the Family Stone which 
broke all traditions: guys and gals, family and relatives. All for one 
and one for all. Apart from all that, all I have to say is: women are 
exciting!"<br>
<br>
Bruce laughs his hoarse laugh. "People think it was rock that brought me
 to the music scene. But that's all wrong. What got me playing, in fact,
 was soul, and the way soul bands used to operate. Mainly the way they 
can create an almost spiritual experience. Not exactly in the religious 
senses of the word, but a human spiritual mood where the band succeeds 
in carrying the audience up with them, all the way."<br>
<br>
He gestures towards the heavens and continues, "My new band and my new 
music reflect that search, which I have been making these last few 
years. And I don't know whether I want to call what I've found 
'religion,' but it is, in any case, a kind of spiritual experience born 
out of life itself, having kids, being together with Patti. I 
discovered, nonetheless, that it took me back to my roots in soul. And I
 don't know, we're still at the rehearsal stage, but when we get up 
steam with the band, the whole shape of the landscape will change."<br>
<br>
Is Springsteen's enormous fame and the attendant media attention a 
problem for him? "Not really. People have a mistaken impression of what 
it really is like. And I've actually managed to live relatively 
anonymously in the last few years. It's possible in a city like Los 
Angeles; that's one of the reasons why I moved there. There's always so 
many other games going on in that town that keep people occupied."<br>
<br>
Over the years Springsteen has talked to his audience quite a bit about 
his troubled relationship with his father. Has becoming a father himself
 helped? "Yes," he says. "Actually, during the time we were expecting 
our first child my father started coming around a lot. And he who never 
used to talk talks a lot now. Something really happened when I became a 
dad. Maybe it takes some hard times to get to see the best of each 
other.<br>
<br>
"The thing is, kids take you out of your own head. My job is all about 
me, all about self-involvement. And all around you people just stand 
saying, 'Yes, yes, yes.' To them every idea you have is just fantastic. 
Well, actually, the people I work with aren't like that, but that's what
 it's like in this business in general. Anyway, kids don't react like 
that. You can no longer spend the afternoon thinking about whether you 
should wear white or brown shoes. Because kids need you there with them.
 They take you out of your own head and into the real world."<br>
<br>
Before his children were born Bruce says he went through the toughest 
time of his life. "When the last [Tunnel Of Love] tour ended in 1989 
there were so many things going on in my life and somehow it was like my
 old ways had caught up with me," he says. "I needed to do something new
 but I didn't have the nerve. I went through a very confusing time, a 
depression, really. I began to reassess everything I'd gone through. 
Like the success I'd had with 'Born in the U.S.A.' Did I like it? Did I 
want to do something like that again? Was I misunderstood?<br>
<br>
"I also thought a lot about the iconic status that my music had 
attained. Sure, my music had always had a mythic edge to it, but, well, I
 just fell overwhelmed by the whole thing. I felt dehumanized."<br>
<br>
He reveals that he went into therapy to solve his emotional problems. 
"It really did help," he says. "I feel more open and free now. At last I
 managed to break free from my past, I stopped chasing old ghosts. I 
needed to live in the present. In the end I was forced to drive down a 
road I had never traveled before. And I found love, children, and a new 
faith in my place in the world."<br>
<br>
Bruce seems willing to turn his back on the past on all levels. The folk
 hero of his home state, New Jersey, has moved out. "I really have tried
 to distance myself from my past," he agrees. "It was time to move on, 
find something new, and I also wanted to get away from the image which 
had been created around my person, which felt like a burden. People had 
very clear expectations. And the point about moving to L.A. is that L.A.
 is a place where the present counts. My music is rooted in the 
here-and-now. This is me today, this is what I am thinking, what I'm 
doing â€“ I only hope people like it."<br>
<br>
Springsteen says that after the Tunnel Of Love tour he also found it 
very difficult to write songs - in fact, he didn't write anything at all
 for more than a year. "And when I finally did, I kept coming up with 
songs like the stuff on Tunnel Of Love, but not as good," he recalls. 
"Or stuff that reminded me of Nebraska. I felt like I had said it 
before, and had said it better. So I finally called up Roy Bittan."<br>
<br>
Keyboardist Bittan is the only member from the E Street Band who's 
included in the new group. He'd written some instrumental music that 
Bruce took to his garage apartment to work on. "And the words started 
coming to me," Springsteen says. "It became 'Roll Of The Dice,' and the 
start of the Human Touch album. I remember I was so happy when I 
finished it that I ran into the house and woke Patti up to get her to 
listen to it. It was three o'clock in the morning. In that song I 
suddenly felt some sort of energy, and it was like, 'Yeah, this is what 
I've been searching for.'<br>
<br>
"'Human Touch' became some sort of soul album; certainly my most 
soul-influenced work since 'The Wild, The Innocent And The E Street 
Shuffle' a long way back. I finished the album, then I realized 
something was missing. I hadn't told the story about my life today. My 
life had really changed a lot, with Patti and the kids. So I wrote the 
song 'Living Proof' about it. And I felt like, 'Yeah, this is really me,
 with my feet firmly in the present."<br>
<br>
That breakthrough led to the quick writing of a whole new album. The 
lyrics to that one, Lucky Town, are very private and read almost as an 
open diary. "Well, people tend to believe that everything an artist 
sings is self-experienced, but in reality that's only a part of what 
you're singing," he explains. "But yeah, I guess my whole work is an 
emotional diary. The guy in 'Living Proof' is the same guy as the one in
 'Born To Run,' except he's covered a lot of miles in between."<br>
<br>
Discussing the track "My Beautiful Reward," Bruce says, "It just came 
out! The best stuff is generally the stuff that you don't know how you 
did, like 'Highway Patrolman' on Nebraska. It just came to me; I felt it
 coming, I started to write it down... You tend to try and make some 
changes afterwards, but it never gets as good."<br>
<br>
Springsteen saw the riots in Los Angeles at close quarters. In fact, the
 corner shop across the road from his studio was looted. "Three blocks 
from here you can find the ruins of burnt-out buildings," he says. The 
riots made an obvious impression: for the new single, "57 Channels," 
Little Steven made a collage of TV voices which changed the song into a 
commentary about the riot.<br>
<br>
"You get frustrated," he comments. "The inner cities have been neglected
 for a decade now. It comes as no surprise that this has led to rioting.
 What is surprising is that they didn't occur sooner."<br>
<br>
Bruce then begins to talk about politicians and the forthcoming 
presidential elections ("It's just like a cartoon, completely crazy") 
and what he's listening to now. "There's a guy called David Baerwald who
 does some terrific writing," he enthuses. "I like the band Social 
Distortion; they have a song called 'Born To Lose' that's really good. 
And Dylan, of course. I still like the Oh Mercy album, and some of the 
stuff on his CD box set is really great."<br>
<br>
Later I am standing among an audience of 11 at a rehearsal for the tour.
 In true Springsteen style, what was planned as a 50-minute concert 
becomes 2 1/4 hours. The small audience notwithstanding, he plays all 21
 songs with the same enthusiasm as if he were standing in front of 
50,000. Starting with "Better Days" and "Born In The U.S.A.," he ends 
with "Dancing In The Dark" and "Bobby Jean." In "Glory Days" he takes 
the opportunity to joke about the fact that his two discs have not been 
selling as well as expected, and exhorts his choir with "Soon we'll 
overtake both Kris Kross and Def Leppard!"<br>
<br>
Then he quips about his divorce and his new marriage by yelling: "take a
 piece of advice from a man who's stepped down the aisle time or two." 
And before "Leap Of Faith," which gives the clearest idea of what the 
new band sounds like, he throws in a dedication: "This is for my two 
kids, the miracle of which helps me cope with living in the world of 
today. And to my dearest Patti." The rock star who thought happiness was
 a car and an open road has gone. Bruce Springsteen has been reborn as a
 family man.</div>

Born To Run is a magnificent album that pays off on every bet ever 
placed on Bruce Springsteen -- a '57 Chevy running on melted down 
Crystals records that shuts down every claim that has been made. And it 
should crack his future wide open.<br>
<br>
The song titles by themselves -- "Thunder Road," "Night," "Backstreets,"
 "Born to Run," "Jungleland" -- suggest the extraordinary dramatic 
authority that is at the heart of Springsteen's new music. It is the 
drama that counts; the stories Springsteen is telling are nothing new, 
though no one has ever told them better or made them matter more. Their 
familiar romance is half their power: The promise and the threat of the 
night; the lure of the road; the quest for a chance worth taking and the
 lust to pay its price; girls glimpsed once at 80 miles and hour and 
never forgotten; the city streets as the last, permanent American 
frontier. We know the story: one thousand and one American nights, one 
long night of fear and love.<br>
<br>
What is new is the majesty Springsteen and his band have brought to this
 story. Springsteen's singing, his words and the band's music have 
turned the dreams and failures two generations have dropped along the 
road into an epic -- an epic that began when that car went over the 
cliff in Rebel without a Cause. One feels that all it ever meant, all it
 ever had to say, is on this album, brought forth with a determination 
one would have thought was burnt out years ago. One feels that the music
 Springsteen has made from this long story has outstripped the story; 
that it is, in all its fire, a demand for something new.<br>
<br>
In one sense, all this talk of epic comes down to sound. Rolling Stone 
contributing editor Jon Landau, Mike Appel and Springsteen produced Born
 to Run in a style as close to mono as anyone can get these days; the 
result is a sound full of grandeur. For all it owes to Phil Spector, it 
can be compared only to the music Bob Dylan &amp; the Hawks made onstage
 in 1965 and '66. With that sound, Springsteen has achieved something 
very special. He has touched his world with glory, without glorifying 
anything: not the unbearable pathos of the street fight in "Jungleland,"
 not the scared young lovers of "Backstreets" and not himself.<br>
<br>
<br>
 "Born to Run" is the motto that speaks for the album's tales, just as 
the guitar figure that runs through the title song -- the finest 
compression of rock &amp; roll thrill since the opening riffs of "Layla"
 -- speaks for its music. But "Born to Run" is uncomfortably close to 
another talisman of the lost kids that careen across this record, a 
slogan Springsteen's motto inevitably suggests. It is an old tattoo: 
"Born to Lose." Springsteen's songs -- filled with recurring images of 
people stranded, huddled, scared, crying, dying -- take place in the 
space between "Born to Run" and "Born to Lose," as if to say, the only 
run worth making is the one that forces you to risk losing everything 
you have. Only by taking that risk can you hold on to the faith that you
 have something left to lose. Springsteen's heroes and heroines face 
terror and survive it, face delight and die by its hand, and then watch 
as the process is reversed, understanding finally that they are paying 
the price of romanticizing their own fear.<br>
<br>
One soft infested summer<br>
Me and Terry became friends<br>
Trying in vain to breathe<br>
The fire we was born in...<br>
Remember all the movies, Terry<br>
We'd go see<br>
Trying to learn to walk like the heroes<br>
We thought we had to be<br>
Well after all this time<br>
To find we're just like all the rest<br>
Stranded in the park<br>
And forced to confess<br>
To Hiding on the backstreets<br>
Hiding on the backstreets<br>
Where we swore forever friends....<br>
<br>
Those are a few lines from "Backstreets," a song that begins with music 
so stately, so heartbreaking, that it might be the prelude to a rock 
&amp; roll version of The Illiad. Once the piano and organ have 
established the theme the entire band comes and plays the theme again. 
There is an overwhelming sense of recognition: No, you've never heard 
anything like this before, but you understand it instantly, because this
 music -- or Springsteen crying, singing wordlessly, moaning over the 
last guitar lines of "Born to Run," or the astonishing chords that 
follow each verse of "Jungleland," or the opening of "Thunder Road" -- 
is what rock &amp; roll is supposed to sound like.<br>
<br>
The songs, the best of them, are adventures in the dark, incidents of 
wasted fury. Tales of kids born to run who lose anyway, the songs can, 
as with "Backstreets," hit so hard and fast that it is almost impossible
 to sit through them without weeping. And yet the music is exhilarating.
 You may find yourself shaking your head in wonder, smiling through 
tears at the beauty of it all. I'm not talking about lyrics; they're 
buried, as they should be, hard to hear for the first dozen playings or 
so, coming out in bits and pieces. To hear Springsteen sing the line 
"Hiding on the backstreets" is to be captured by an image; the details 
can come later. Who needed to figure out all the words to "Like a 
Rolling Stone" to understand it?<br>
<br>
It is a measure of Springsteen's ability to make his music bleed that 
"Backstreets," which is about friendship and betrayal between a boy and a
 girl, is far more deathly than "Jungleland," which is about a gang war.
 The music isn't "better," nor is the singing -- but it is more 
passionate, more deathly and, necessarily, more alive. That, if 
anything, might be the key to this music: As a ride through terror, it 
resolves itself finally as a ride into delight.<br>
<br>
"Oh-o, come on, take my hand," Springsteen sings, "Riding out to case 
the promised land." And there, in a line, is Born to Run. You take what 
you find, but you never give up your demand for something better because
 you know, in your heart, you deserve it. That contradiction is what 
keeps Springsteen's story, and the promised land's, alive. Springsteen 
took what he found and made something better himself. This album is it.<br>

The Boss' Triumphant Return<br>
Rolling Stone , 1978-07-27<br>
By Dave Marsh<br>
Occasionally, a record appears that changes fundamentally the way we 
hear rock &amp; roll, the way it's recorded, the way it's played. Such 
records?Jimi Hendrix' Are You Experienced, Bob Dylan's "Like a Rolling 
Stone," Van Morrison's Astral Weeks, Who's Next, The Band?force 
response, both from the musical community and the audience. To me, these
 are the records justifiably called classics, and I have no doubt that 
Bruce Springsteen's Darkness on the Edge of Town -will someday fit as 
naturally within that list as the Rolling Stones' "(I Can't Get No) 
Satisfaction" or Sly and the Family Stone's "Dance to the Music." <br>
<br>
One ought to be wary of making such claims, but in this case, they're 
justified at every level. In the area of production, Darkness on the 
Edge of Town is nothing less than a breakthrough. Springsteen?with 
coproducer Jon Landau, engineer Jimmy lovine and Charles Plotkin, who 
helped lovine mix the LP?is the first artist to fuse the spacious 
clarity of Los Angeles record making and the raw density of English 
productions. That's the major reason why the result is so different from
 Born to Run's Phil Spector wall of sound. On the earlier album, for 
instance, the individual instruments were deliberately obscured to 
create the sense of one huge instrument. Here, the same power is 
achieved more naturally. Most obviously. Max Weinberg's drumming has 
enormous size, a heartbeat with the same kind of space it occupies 
onstage (the only other place I've heard a bass drum sound this big). <br>
<br>
Now that it can be heard, the E Street Band is clearly one of the finest
 rock &amp; roll groups ever assembled. Weinberg, bassist Garry Tallent 
and guitarist Steve Van Zandt are a perfect rhythm section, capable of 
both power and groove. Pianist Roy Bittan is as virtuosic as on Born to 
Run, and saxophonist Clarence demons, though he has fewer solos, evokes 
more than ever the spirit of King Curtis. But the revelation is organist
 Danny Federici, who barely appeared on the last LP. Federici's style is
 utterly singular, focusing on wailing, trebly chords that sing (and in 
the marvelous solo at the end of "Racing in the Street," truly cry). <br>
<br>
Yet the dominant instrumental focus of Darkness on the Edge of Town is 
Bruce Springsteen's guitar. Like his songwriting and singing, 
Springsteen's guitar playing gains much of its distinctiveness through 
pastiche. There are echoes of a dozen influences?Duane Eddy, Jimmy Page,
 JefF Beck, Jimi Hendrix, Roy Buchanan, even Ennio Morricone's Sergio 
Leone soundtracks ?but the synthesis is completely Springsteen's own. 
Sometimes Springsteen quotes a famous solo?Robbie Robertson's from the 
live version of "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues" at the end of "Something 
in the Night," Jeff Beck's from "Heart Full of Soul" in the bridge of 
"Candy's Room"? and then shatters it into another dimension. In the end 
the most impressive guitar work of all is just his own: "Adam Raised a 
Cain" and "Streets of Fire" are things no one's ever heard before. <br>
<br>
Much the same can be said about Springsteen's singing. Certainly, Van 
Morrison and Bob Dylan are the inspirations for taking such extreme 
chances: bending and twisting syllables; making two key lines on 
"Streets of Fire" a wordless, throttled scream; the wailing and humming 
that precede and follow some of the record's most important lyrics. But 
more than ever, Springsteen's voice is personal, intimate and revealing,
 bigger and less elusive. It's the possibility hinted at on Born to 
Run's "Backstreets" and in the postverbal wail at the end 
of'Jungleland." In fact, Springsteen picks up that moan at the beginning
 of "Something in the Night," on which he turns in the new album's most 
adventurous vocal. <br>
<br>
One could say a great deal about the construction of this LP. The 
programming alone is impressive: each side is a discrete progression of 
similar lyrical and musical themes, and the whole is a more universal 
version of the same picture. Ideas, characters and phrases jump from 
song to song like threads in a tapestry, and everything's one long 
interrelationship. But all of these elements?the production, the 
playing, even the programming?are designed to focus our attention on 
what Springsteen has to tell us about the last three years of his life. <br>
<br>
In a way, this album might take as its text two lines from. Jackson 
Browne: "Nothing survives?/ But the way we live our lives." But where 
Browne is content to know this, Springsteen explores it: Darkness on the
 Edge of Town is about the kind of life that deserves survival. Despite 
its title, it is a complete rejection of despair. Bruce Springsteen says
 this over and over again, more bluntly and clearly than anyone could 
have imagined. There isn't a single song on this record in which his 
yearning for a perfect existence, a life lived to the hilt, doesn't play
 a central role. <br>
<br>
Springsteen also realizes the terrible price one pays for living at 
half-speed. In "Racing in the Street," the album's most beautiful 
ballad, Springsteen separates humanity into two classes: "Some guys they
 just give up living / And start dying little by little, piece by piece /
 Some guys come home from work and wash up / And go racin' in the 
street." But there's nothing smug about it, because Springsteen knows 
that the line separating the living dead from the walking wounded is a 
fine and bitter one. In the song's final verse, he describes with 
genuine love a person of the first sort, someone whose eyes "hate for 
just being born." In "Factory," he depicts the most numbing sort of life
 with a compassion that's nearly religious. And in "Adam Raised a Cain,"
 the son who rejected his father's world comes to understand their 
relationship as "the dark heart of a dream"?a dream become nightmarish, 
but a vision of something better nonetheless. <br>
<br>
There are those who will say that "Adam Raised a Cain" is full of hate, 
but I don't believe it. The only hate I hear on this LP is embodied in a
 single song, "Streets of Fire," where Springsteen describes how it 
feels to be trapped by lies. And even here, he has the maturity to hate 
the He, not the liar. <br>
<br>
Throughout the new album, Springsteen's lyrics are a departure from his 
early work, almost its opposite, in fact: dense and compact, not 
scattershot. And if the scenes are the same?the highways, bars, cars and
 toil? they also represent facets of life that rock &amp; roll has too 
often ignored or, what's -worse, romanticized. Darkness on the Edge of 
Town faces everyday life whole, daring to see if something greater can 
be made of it. This is naive perhaps, but also courageous. Who else but a
 brave innocent could believe so boldly in a promised land, or write a 
song that not only quotes Martha and the Vandellas' "Dancing in the 
Street" but paraphrases the Beach Boys' "Don't Worry Baby"? <br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen has a tendency to inspire messianic regard in his 
fans?including this one. This isn't so much because he's regarded as a 
savior?though his influence has already been substantial?but because he 
fulfills the rock tradition in so many ways. Like Elvis Presley and 
Buddy Holly, Springsteen has the ability, and the zeal, to do it all. 
For many years, rock &amp; roll has been splintered between the West 
Coast's monopoly on the genre's lyrical and pastoral characteristics and
 a British and Middle American stranglehold on toughness and raw power. 
Springsteen unites these aspects: he's the only artist I can think of 
who's simultaneously comparable to Jackson Browne and Pete Townshend. 
Just as the production of this record unifies certain technical trends, 
Springsteen's presentation makes rock itself whole again. This is true 
musically?he rocks as hard as a punk, but with the verbal grace of a 
singer/songwriter?and especially emotionally. If these songs are about 
experienced adulthood, they sacrifice none of rock &amp; roll's 
adolescent innocence. Springsteen escapes the narrow dogmatism of both 
Old Wave and New, and the music's possibilities are once again 
limitless. <br>
<br>
Four years ago, in a Cambridge bar, my friend Jon Landau and I watched 
Bruce Springsteen give a performance that changed some lives?my own 
included. About a similar night. Landau later wrote what was to become 
rock criticism's most famous sentence: "I saw rock &amp; roll future and
 its name is Bruce Springsteen." With its usual cynicism, the world 
chose to think of this as a fanciful way of calling Springsteen the Next
 Big Thing. <br>
<br>
I've never taken it that way. To me, these words, shamefully mistreated 
as they've been, have kept a different shape. What they've always said 
was that someday Bruce Springsteen would make rock &amp; roll that would
 shake men's souls and make them question the direction of their lives. 
That would do, in short, all the marvelous things rock had always 
promised to do. <br>
<br>
But Born to Run was not that music. It sounded instead like the end of 
an era, the climax of the first twenty years of this grand tradition, 
the apex of our collective adolescence. Darkness on the Edge of Town 
does not. It feels like the threshold of a new period in -which we'll 
again have "lives on the line where dreams are found and lost." It poses
 once more the question that rock &amp; roll's epiphanic moments always 
raise: Do you believe in magic? <br>
<br>
And once again, the answer is yes. Absolutely.<br>
<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen Raises Cain  by Dave Marsh. 1978<br>
<br>
One of Bruce Springsteen's most popular early songs is called "4th of 
July, Asbury Park (Sandy)." That he is spending this Independence Day on
 the shores of the wrong ocean is an irony that escapes no one, 
including himself. L.A. is not terra incognita, but Springsteen does not
 yet reign here as he does back east, and perhaps the time is auspicious
 to change that. Although he has been up all night mixing tapes recorded
 at his last concert (Saturday night, in Berkeley), he is at the pool 
soaking up the sun by eleven a.m.<br>
<br>
If God had invented a hotel for rock bands, it probably would look like 
the Sunset Marquis, where Springsteen and the E Street Band are staying.
 Nestled on a steep side street just below Sunset Strip, the Marquis is a
 combination summer camp and commune. Its rooms are laid out around the 
swimming pool and guests on the first floor use the pool terrace as a 
sort of patio. In the daytime, the poolside is jammed, and at night, 
it's easy to tell who's home by the lights inside, behind curtained 
glass doors. Springsteen, the band, their crew and entourage occupy 
thirty rooms, including all those around the pool.<br>
<br>
At noon, producer/manager Jon Landau, Bruce and I disappear into 
Springsteen's room to play the Berkeley concert mixes. There are two 
mixes of an eight-minute rendition of "Prove It All Night" that shatters
 the LP version, and one mix of an unnamed, shorter instrumental, often 
called "Paradise by the Sea," which opens the second half of his 
concerts. Even on a small cassette player, it's clear that something 
considerable is going on.<br>
<br>
For years people have been begging Springsteen to make a live album, and
 "Prove It All Night" shows why. The song is considered the lightest 
item on Darkness on the Edge of Town, his new album, but onstage it 
becomes what pianist Roy Bittan, for one, thinks is the most exciting 
song of the show, featuring a lengthy guitar and keyboard improvisation 
that sounds like an unholy alliance between the Yardbirds and Bob Dylan.
 When the introduction gives way to the melody of the song, "Prove It" 
is transformed from something potentially light and dismissible into an 
emotional crucible. Hearing it, you may wonder if "Prove It All Night" 
is a hit single, but you know it's a great song.<br>
<br>
"Paradise by the Sea" is its alter ego. Only Springsteen, touring behind
 a new album, would have come up with this to open the second half of 
the show: a five-minute instrumental featuring Clarence Clemons' sax and
 Danny Federici's organ, which simultaneously evokes Duane Eddy and 
Booker T. and the MGs.<br>
<br>
Clemons walks into the room with an unbelievably joyous look on his 
face, and when the tape ends, he takes Bruce by the arm and shouts, 
"Everybody into the pool!" The next sound is a series of splashes, and 
in a few moments they reappear, bathing suits dripping, and listen 
again, then repeat the performance. Soon, the tiny hotel bedroom is 
crowded with half a dozen people dripping wet and exuberant.<br>
<br>
At 6:30 p.m., Bruce is at KMET-FM to do an on-the-air interview with 
disc jockey Mary Turner. There are a couple of bottles of champagne, 
which may be a mistake; Bruce gets loose pretty easily. And in fact, he 
is a little sloshed as the interview begins, but Turner plays it 
perfectly, fishing for stories. She gets at least one winner.<br>
<br>
"When my folks moved out to California," Bruce begins in response to a 
question about whether he really knows "a pretty little place in 
Southern California/Down San Diego way" as he claims in "Rosalita," "my 
mom decided -- see my father and I would fight all the time -- and she 
decided that we should go to Tijuana [he laughs his hoarse laugh, 
reserved for the truly absurd]. So we got in the car and drove down 
there, arguing all the way. First I drove and he yelled at me, and then 
he drove and I yelled at him.<br>
<br>
"Anyway, we finally go there, and of course, my old man is the 
softest-hearted guy in the world. Within fifteen minutes, some guy has 
sold him some watch that must've run for all of an hour and a half 
before it stopped. And then some guy comes up and says, 'Hey would you 
guys like to have your picture taken on a zebra?'<br>
<br>
"Well, we looked at each other -- who could believe this, right? Zebras 
are in Africa. And so we said, 'Well if you've got a zebra, we 
definitely want to have our picture taken.' So we give him ten bucks and
 he takes us around this corner, and he's got . . . he's got a damn 
donkey with stripes painted on its side. And he pulls out these two hats
 -- one says Pancho, one says Cisco -- I swear -- and he sits us on the 
donkey and takes our picture. My mother's still got that picture. But 
that is all I knew about Southern California at the time I wrote 
'Rosalita.'"<br>
<br>
This is the easiest I have ever heard Bruce speak of his father. "Adam 
Raised a Cain," from the new album, may have exorcised a lot of ghosts. 
In some of the stories Bruce has told onstage about their relationship, 
however, his father seems like a demon, which of course, he is not.<br>
<br>
In fact, Douglas Springsteen has lived a very rough working-class life. 
For a great deal of Bruce's childhood, his family (he has two sisters, 
both younger) shared a house with his grandparents while his father 
worked at an assortment of jobs -- in a factory, as a gardener, as a 
prison guard -- never making as much as $10,000 a year. Later he moved 
the family from New Jersey to northern California, where he is now a bus
 driver. Bruce says that the tales of their conflicts are true ("I don't
 make 'em up"), but that they're meant to be "universal." He is not 
exactly enthusiastic about discussing the relationship, although in a 
couple of the songs that didn't make it onto Darkness, particularly "The
 Promise" and "Independence Day," he has chronicled his preoccupation 
with fathers as thoroughly as did John Steinbeck in East of Eden, the 
film that inspired "Adam."<br>
<br>
Bruce is so loose by now that when an ad for Magic Mountain's roller 
coaster -- the largest in the world -- comes on, he discusses great 
roller coasters he has known, and his desire to see this one. "You wanna
 date?" he asks Turner, in front of who knows how many listeners. She 
makes the perfect reply: "Only if we sit in the front seat."<br>
<br>
After the interview, we head to the car and a beach house in Santa 
Monica, where there's a promise of food and fireworks. We race straight 
out Santa Monica Boulevard to the freeway. It's like something out of a 
Steve McQueen movie (Bullitt). I haven't spent as reckless a moment as 
this one in years. But Bruce, who isn't driving, is determined to see 
those fireworks. "C'mon," he says, over and over again. "I don't wanna 
miss 'em." He's like a little boy, and the car whips along, straight 
into a traffic jam at the end of the Santa Monica Freeway, where we can 
see hints of the fireworks -- blue, red, gold, green -- cascading out 
over the ocean.<br>
<br>
It's a chill night and the party is outside, Band and crew members 
shiver on the patio, chewing on cold sandwiches (Swiss cheese, ham, 
turkey, roast beef) and sucking down beer and soda. Bruce quickly 
decides this won't do. He heads for the gate leading to the beach. 
"C'mon," he says to one and all. "Let's walk up to the pier. I want a 
hot dog."<br>
<br>
And so we strike out down the beach. The pier is a mile south, far 
enough so that it's lights are only a glow on the horizon. And covering 
the beach the entire distance are people shooting off their own 
fireworks, Roman candles and skyrockets. We haven't gone a hundred yards
 before the scene has become a combat zone. I suggest a strategic 
retreat to the highway. Bruce gives me a look. "C'mon, what's the worst 
that can happen? A rocket upside the head?" He giggles with joy and 
keeps trudging on through the sand.<br>
<br>
The rockets are exploding directly over our heads now, and once in a 
while, closer than that. A rocket upside the head is not unimaginable. 
Bruce strikes out closer to the water, where the sand is more firmly 
packed and the walking is easier. Down here there are other sorts of 
activity: lovers in sleeping bags and drinkers sitting in sand pits, 
nursing themselves against the chill with liquor. The rockets, fewer 
now, drift out into the water to die with a hiss or a fizzle, and Bruce 
Springsteen moves through it all, just another cloud in a hurricane, a 
natural force or maybe just another kid.<br>
<br>
Two hot dogs with relish and an hour of pinball later, we walk back 
along the highway to the car and zip back to the hotel. Tour manager Jim
 McHale, David Landau (Warren Zevon's lead guitarist and Jon's brother) 
and booking agent Barry Bell are talking in Jon's room when Bruce bursts
 through the poolside curtains. His face is glowing. "We're goin' to 
make the hit," he shouts, and ducks back out. McHale's jaw drops and he 
races from the room. "I think they're going to paint the billboard," 
says David.<br>
<br>
The raid isn't completely a surprise. Sunday night, driving up the Strip
 on the way to see The Buddy Holly Story, Bruce had first noticed the 
billboard looming above a seven-story building just west of the 
Continental Hyatt House. Billboards are a Hollywood institution -- 
they're put up for every significant album and concert appearance -- and
 this one uses the Darkness cover photo, poorly cropped, to promote both
 the new record and the group's Forum appearance tomorrow night. As we 
passed this enormous monument, which rears up forty feet above the 
building, Bruce had groaned and slumped in his seat. "That is the 
ugliest thing I've ever seen in my life," he said.<br>
<br>
The billboard is only a few blocks up the street. According to all 
accounts, Springsteen, Clemons, bass guitarist Garry Tallent and several
 crew members approached with some stealth the office building on which 
the billboard is perched. Much to their surprise, the building was wide 
open, and the elevator quickly took them to the roof. There, McHale, 
perhaps figuring that cleverness is better than a bust, quickly 
organized them. There were twenty cans of black spray paint, quickly 
distributed, and Bruce, Garry and Clarence quickly took positions on the
 paperhangers' ledge. Bell was positioned across the street to watch for
 cops. At a signal from McHale, the painting began: PROVE IT ALL NIGHT 
spread across the billboard from edge to edge, the middle words nearly 
lost in the dark photo of Bruce. Then Bruce stood on Clemons' shoulders 
and painted another legend above NIGHT: E STREET, it said. As they were 
clambering down, a signal came -- the cops. Some headed back for the 
elevator, but Bruce, Clarence and McHale left Cagney-style, down the 
outside fire escape. It was a false alarm anyway.<br>
<br>
In the hotel lobby at a quarter to three, Bruce is exhilarated. "You 
shoulda been there," he says, running over the event like a successful 
general fresh from battle. Was he worried about getting caught? "Naw," 
he says. "I figured if they caught us, that was great, and if we got 
away with it, that was even better." He looks down at himself, hands 
black with paint, boots ruinously dusty from the beach, and laughs. 
"There it is," he says. "Physical evidence . . . The only thing is, I 
wanted to get to my face and paint on a mustache. Bu tit was just too 
damn high." He terms the paint job, "an artistic improvement."<br>
<br>
Wednesday, July 5th<br>
<br>
Last night, as we were getting into the car after the KMET interview, 
Bruce began to talk about the reviews Darkness on the Edge of Town has 
been getting. It is a subject on which he qualifies as something of an 
expert: more has been written about him -- and about what has been 
written on him -- than any other rock performer of recent years, with 
the possible exception of Mick Jagger. The miracle is, I guess, that the
 scars barely show -- instead Springsteen looks at the press with avid 
interest.<br>
<br>
"It's a weird thing about those reviews," Bruce says. "You can find any 
conceivable opinion in them: one guy says the record's exactly like Born
 to Run and it's great, the next one says it's not like Born to Run and 
it's great, the next one says, it's not like Born to Run and it's 
awful." This amuses him. The nearly unanimous opinion that the album is 
grim and depressing doesn't.<br>
<br>
It's the title, I suggest. "I know, I know," he says impatiently. "But I
 put in the first few seconds of 'Badlands,' the first song on the 
album, those lines about 'I believe in the love and the hope and the 
faith.' It's there on all four corners of the album" By which he means 
the first and last songs on each side: "Badlands" and "Racing in the 
Street," "The Promised Land" and the title song. He is clearly 
distressed: he meant Darkness to be "relentless," not grim.<br>
<br>
Later, I ask him why the album lacks the humor that buoys his shows. "In
 the show, it's a compilation of all the recorded stuff," he says in the
 halting way he uses when he's taking something seriously. "If you go 
back to The Wild and Innocent, 'Rosalita' is there, and all that stuff. 
But when I was making this particular album, I just had a specific thing
 in mind. And one of the important things was that it had to be just a 
relentless . . . just a barrage of the particular thing.<br>
<br>
"I got an album's worth of pop songs, like 'Rendezvous' and early 
English-style stuff. I got an album's worth right now, and I'm gonna get
 it out somehow. I wanna do an album that's got ten or eleven things 
like that on it. But I didn't feel it was the right time to do that, and
 I didn't want to sacrifice any of the intensity of the album by 
throwing in 'Rendezvous,' even though I knew it was popular from the 
show."<br>
<br>
The other criticism that is easily made of Darkness concerns the 
repetition of certain images: cars, street life, abandonment by or of 
women, family and friends. Those who like this call it style; those who 
don't say Springsteen is drilling a dry hole. But perhaps Springsteen's 
greatest and most repeated image is the lie.<br>
<br>
"It's hard to explain without getting too heavy. What it is, it's the 
characters' commitment. In the face of all the betrayals, in the face of
 all the imperfections that surround you in whatever kind of life you 
lead, it's the characters' refusal to let go of their own humanity, to 
let go of their own belief in the other side. It's a certain loss of 
innocence -- more so than in the other albums."<br>

I drove out to the Forum this afternoon with <strong class="text-strong">Obie.
 Obie is twenty-five, and she has been Bruce Springsteen's biggest fan 
for more than a decade. When he was still just a local star, she waited 
overnight for tickets to his shows to make certain she'd have perfect 
seats. She is now secretary to Miami Steve Van Zandt, Springsteen's 
guitarist and manager/producer of Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes.
 This means what while Springsteen is on tour, Obie is the de facto 
manager of the Asbury Jukes. But she's also something more. She makes 
some of the jackets and suits Bruce wears onstage. She is also a 
historian; there are a thousand Asbury Park legends behind her twinkling
 eyes. More than anything, she is a fan who counts the days between 
Springsteen shows. Her loyalty is rewarded. Whenever she comes to a 
show, in any town, the front-row center is reserved for her.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"></strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It is partly this that makes Bruce Springsteen so attractive: he is 
surrounded by real-life characters that form the kind of utopian 
community most of us lost when we graduated high school; one of the 
reasons Springsteen is such a singular performer is that he has never 
lost touch with this decidedly noncosmopolitan gang.<br>
<br>
Part of the legend is the E Street Band. "Ya know, you can tell by 
looking at 'em," Bruce explains to me, "that this isn't a bunch of guys 
with a whole lot in common. But somehow the music cuts right through all
 that."<br>
<br>
There's a lot to cut. Bassist Garry Tallent is a consummate rockabilly 
addict who looks the part. He's been known to use Brylcreem. Organist 
Danny Federici has an angel face that could pass for the kind of tough 
guy Harvey Keitel plays in Fingers. Pianist Roy Bittan and drummer Max 
Weinberg are seasoned pros, veterans of recording studios and Broadway 
pit bands. Miami Steve Van Zandt is a perpetual motion machine, a comic 
version of Keith Richards' Barbary pirate act, with a slice of 
small-town-boy-made-good on the side. And Clarence Clemons, last of all,
 dwells in a land all his own, not quite like the universe the rest of 
us inhabit, though it is seemingly available to all comers. Clemons 
transforms any room he enters, as a six-foot plus black man with the 
bulk of a former football player often can do, but even in his own digs 
at the Marquis, there's something special happening -- his hospitality 
is perfect, and it is in Clarence's room that the all-night part is most
 likely to run.<br>
<br>
Bruce stands distinctly outside this group. "It's weird," he says, 
"'cause it's not really a touring band or just a recording band. And 
it's definitely me, I'm a solo act, y'know." But there is also a sense 
in which Bruce Springsteen does not mesh in any society, and it has a 
great deal to do with what makes him so obsessive about his music.<br>
<br>
Before he landed a record contract, all of the Asbury Park musicians 
held day jobs -- Garry Tallent worked in a music store, Clemons was a 
social worker, Van Zandt was in the construction union. The exception, 
always, was Bruce, who never held any other job, apparently because he 
could not conceive of doing anything else. At age eight, when he first 
heard Presley, lightning struck, and when he picked up the guitar at 
thirteen, another bolt hit him. "When I got the guitar," he told me 
Wednesday night, "I wasn't getting out of myself. I was already out of 
myself. I knew myself, and I did not dig me. I was getting into myself."<br>
<br>
By fourteen, he was in his first band; by sixteen, he was so good that 
when he practiced in his manager's garage, neighborhood kids would stand
 on milk crates at the windows with their noses pressed to the glass, 
just to hear. The only other things besides music that ever meant much 
to him, Springsteen says, were surfing and cars. But nothing -- even 
girls -- ever got in the way of his obsession with his music; there is a
 certain awe in the way that people who have known him for many years 
speak of his single-minded devotion to playing. It's as if he always 
knew his destiny, and while this hasn't made him cold -- he is one of 
the friendliest people I know -- it has given him considerable distance 
from everyday relationships. One does not ever think of Bruce 
Springsteen married and settled down, raising a family, having kids; 
that would be too much monkey business.<br>
<br>
What keeps the band so tight is the two-to-three hour sound check before
 each gig. Today's began at 3:30 p.m. -- it's a 7:30 show on the ticket 
-- and didn't end until nearly seven. In part, these are informal band 
rehearsals, with Bruce working up new material: as we enter the hall at 
five, he is singing Buddy Holly's "Rave On," a number he has never done 
live. But there's more to it than that.<br>
<br>
On this tour, Springsteen's sound mixer is Bruce Jackson, a tall blond, 
Australian who worked for Elvis Presley for several years. He is amazed 
at Springsteen's perfectionism. "At every date," he says, "he goes out 
and sits in every section of the hall to listen to the sound. And if it 
isn't right, even in the last row, I hear about it, and we make changes.
 I mean every date, too -- he doesn't let it slip in Davenport, Iowa, or
 something." Presley, on the other hand, was concerned only with the 
sound he would hear in the onstage monitors.<br>
<br>
("Anybody who works for me," Springsteen says, without a trace of a 
joke, "the first thing you better know is I'm gonna drive you crazy. 
Because I don't compromise in certain areas. So if you're gonna be in, 
you better be ready for that.")<br>
<br>
Which perhaps explains the consistently high quality of Springsteen's 
life performances. I must have seen forty over the years, and no two are
 alike. Even if the songs are the same, which they hardly ever are, 
Bruce brings something different to every one. Tonight's is 
conversational -- the loosest I've ever seen, and at the same time, 
frighteningly intense. He begins immediately after "Badlands," the 
opening number, by talking about the walk on the beach last night ("It's
 like a combat zone out there") and makes some self-deprecating remarks 
about his press attention, which has mushroomed this week: Robert 
Hilburn had given him a rave advance notice in the Sunday Los Angeles 
Times, and Ed Kociela had more than matched it with a pair of pieces -- 
interview and Berkeley concert review -- in Monday's Herald-Examiner. In
 a way, Springsteen was taking Los Angeles by storm, as he had taken New
 York in August 1975 with the release of Born to Run and ten shows at 
the Bottom Line. There are some who must find such excessive praise 
threatening or suspicious -- though only a fool would think that such 
enthusiasm could be manufactured -- but Bruce diffuses it easily: "See 
all that fancy stuff in the papers about me? Big deal, huh? I gotta tell
 you, I only levitate to the upper deck on Wednesdays and Fridays . . 
.Wednesdays and Fridays, and I don't do no windows."<br>
<br>
Perhaps the most nervy and nerve-racking antic Springsteen has retained 
in making the transition to hockey arenas is his trademark leap into the
 audience during the third song, "Spirit in the Night." He looks frail 
-- at an extremely agile five-foot-nine, he is not -- and one is always 
worried that his consummate trust in his fans is going to let him down. 
But night after night he gets away with it. Somehow. Tonight, the 
security doesn't get the picture and tries to drag the fans off Bruce as
 he ascends an aisle deep in the loges. "You guys work here or 
something?" Springsteen demands. "Get outta here. These guys are my 
friends." The crowd roars.<br>
<br>
His parents have come down from their home near San Francisco for the 
show, and the evening is sprinkled with allusions to them and his 
sixteen-year-old sister, Pam. The stories he tells are always among his 
best moments, but what gets me tonight are the asides and dedications: 
he tells about the billboard ("We made a few improvements,"), about 
asking Mary Turner for a date, and when he does "For You," he dedicates 
the song to Greg Kihn, who recorded the song for Berserkley Records a 
year ago. And because Gary Busey is here, he tells about seeing The 
Buddy Holly Story. It's the perfect review.<br>
<br>
"It's funny because I could never really picture Buddy Holly moving. To 
me, he was always just that guy with the bow tie on the album cover. I 
liked the picture because it made him a lot more real for me."<br>
<br>
But the encores are the evening's highlights. First, "The Promise," a 
quiet ballad that was one of the first things Springsteen wrote for the 
new album, and which was finally dropped from it. In an earlier version,
 "The Promise" was taken by many listeners to be a metaphor the lawsuit 
with former manager Mike Appel that delayed production of the new LP for
 more than a year. But tonight, with a new verse added in the studio, 
it's obviously about something more universal: "Now my daddy taught me 
how to walk quiet/And how to make peace with the past/And I learned real
 good to tighten up inside/And I don't say nothin' unless I'm asked."<br>
<br>
And then, to top it all, he does his two most famous songs, back to 
back: "Born to Run" and "Because the Night," the latter in a version 
that shrivels the Patti Smith hit. When the night finally ends, it is 
with "Quarter to Three," houselights up full and the crowd singing along
 as spontaneously as I've ever heard 14,5000 people do anything.<br>
<br>
Backstage I run into Jackson Browne. "Good show, huh?" I say. He looks 
at me querulously, like I was just released from the nut house. "Uh 
unh," Jackson says. "Great show."<br>
<br>
At midnight, local FM stations broadcast an announcement that 
Springsteen will play the Roxy, the 500-seat club and record-company 
hangout on Sunset Strip, on Friday night, one show only. Lines begin 
forming almost immediately.<br>
<br>
Thursday, July 6th<br>
<br>
Walking through the lobby of the Marquis last night, just after two 
a.m., I ran into Bruce, who asked if I wanted to walk over to Ben 
Frank's for something to eat. On the way I mentioned that there must be a
 lot of people in line at the Roxy just up the street. Bruce gave me a 
look. "I don't like people waiting up all night for me," he said.<br>
<br>
Bruce ate another prodigious meal: four eggs, toast, a grilled-cheese 
sandwich, large glasses of orange juice and milk. And the talk ranged 
widely: surfing (Bruce had lived with some of the Jersey breed for a 
while in the late Sixties, and he's a little frustrated with trying to 
give a glimmer of its complexity to a landlocked ho-dad like me), the 
new album and its live recording ("I don't think I'll ever go back to 
the overdub method," he said mentioning that almost all of the LP was 
done completely live in the studio, and that "Streets of Fire" and 
"Something in the Night" were first takes). But mostly we talked or 
rather, Bruce talked and I listened.<br>
<br>
Springsteen can be spellbinding, partly because he is so completely 
ingenuous, partly because of the intensity and sincerity with which he 
has thought out his role as a rock star. He delivers these ideas with an
 air of conviction, but not a proselytizing one; some of his ideas are 
radical enough for Patti Smith or the punks, yet lack their 
sanctimonious rhetoric.<br>
<br>
I asked him why the band plays so long - their shows are rarely less 
than three hours - and he said: "It's hard to explain. 'Cause every time
 I read stuff that I say, like in the papers, I always think I come off 
sounding like some kind of crazed fanatic. When I read it, it sounds 
like that, but it's the way I am about it. It's like you have to go the 
whole way because . . . that's what keeps everything real. It all ties 
in with the records and the values, the morality of the records. There's
 a certain morality of the show and it's very strict." Such comments can
 seem not only fanatical, but also self-serving. The great advantage of 
the sanctimony and rhetoric that infests the punks is that such flaws 
humanize them. Lacking such egregious characteristics, Bruce Springsteen
 seems too good to be true when reduced to cold type. Nice guys finish 
last, we are told, and here's one at the top. So what's the catch? I 
just don't know.<br>
<br>
At the end of every show, before the first encore, Bruce stands tall at 
the microphone and makes a little speech. "I want to thank all of you 
for supporting the band for the past three years," he concludes and then
 plays "Born to Run." I wondered why.<br>
<br>
"That's what it's about," he said. "Everything counts. Every person, 
every individual in the crowd counts -- to me. I see it both way. There 
is a crowd reaction. But then I also think very, very personally, one to
 one with the kids. 'Cause you put out the effort and then if it doesn't
 come through it's a . . . it's a breakdown. What I always feel is that I
 don't like to let people that have supported me down. I don't like to 
let myself down. Whatever the situation, as impossible as it is, I like 
to try to . . .I don't wanna try to get by."<br>
<br>
And so it was no surprise that, waking up this morning, I found that all
 hell had broken loose. Only 250 seats for the Roxy show were available 
for public sale, which meant that a great many of those who had waited 
up weren't going to get in. And Bruce was not just upset about this; he 
was angry. It was a betrayal, however well intentioned, and the fact 
that another 120 tickets would go to fans through radio-station 
giveaways did not mollify him. People had been fruitlessly 
inconvenienced by him. It did not matter that at most similar small club
 gigs, the proportion of public to industry is reversed. This was his 
show, and it should have been done properly.<br>
<br>
Friday, July 7th<br>
<br>
Whatever bad blood had erupted from the overnight Roxy fiasco is gone. 
In its place, one begins to get a sense of Springsteen's impact on L.A. 
Polaroids snap at the billboard modifications up the Strip, and the band
 seems prepared for a big night. At six p.m. there's a media first: 
Springsteen is interviewed on KABC, the first time he has ever been on 
TV in any way, shape or form. It's a good interview -- "It's probably 
the only thing that I live for. When I was a kid, I didn't know nothin' 
about nothin' until rock &amp; roll got into my house. To me it was the 
only thing that was ever true, it was the only thing that never let me 
down. And no matter who was out there, ten people or 10,000 people, 
there's a lot to live up to . . .What happens is, there's a lotta 
trappings, there'' a lotta things that are there to tempt you, sort of. 
It's just meaningless. And I just try to . . .I play Buddy Holly every 
night before I go on, that keeps me honest."<br>
<br>
But even more striking are the filmed performances of "Prove It All 
Night" and "Rosalita" that accompany the interview. Even on this small 
screen, Springsteen is a visual natural, mugging like a seven-year-old 
and leaping like the rocker of someone's dreams; I know why so many film
 directors, seeing him for the first time, have virtually drooled in 
anticipation.<br>
<br>
After the Forum, the Roxy seems cramped. The broadcast is set for nine, 
but it's a quarter past by the time the band takes the stage. The place 
is packed -- even the balcony box above Roy Bittan's piano looks like it
 is holding twice the customers it was intended for. And while there are
 celebrities here -- Cher and Kiss' Gene Simmons, Jackson Browne, Irving
 Azoff and Glenn Frey, Karla Bonoff, Busey, Tom Waits -- it is mostly a 
crowd of kids and young adults.<br>
<br>
The crowd rustles as Bruce steps to the mike, but he holds up his hand. 
"I want to apologize to everybody," he says, "for what happened with the
 tickets to this show. It was my fault, and I'm really sorry. I wasn't 
trying to make this no private party -- I don't play no parties anymore.
 Except my own." I think that Mrs. Springsteen, sitting in the back, 
must be very proud to have such a son. And he steps to the mike and 
sings: "Wel-a-well-a little things you say and do . . ." It's "Rave On" 
and the joint explodes. Garry Tallent, who loves this music as much as 
anyone I have ever met, is singing the choruses, his face shining. "I've
 always wanted to sing Buddy Holly onstage," he tells me later in his 
quiet way.<br>
<br>
But "Rave On" is only the ignition. Having decided to play a special 
show, Springsteen goes out of his way. He dances on the tabletops, and 
the crowd leaps to grab him. He adds "Candy's Room," one of the Darkness
 songs he never performs, and halfway through the first set, he 
introduces a "new song that I wrote right after I finished Darkness. 
It's called 'Point Blank,' and it's about being trapped." And he tells a
 story of a friend of his who has to work two jobs, as does her husband,
 to make ends meet, and "they're" still trying to take the couple's 
house away. And when he sings, it's very real, living up to that title: 
"Point blank, right between the eyes/They got you, point blank/Right 
between them pretty lies that they tell . . . . No one survives 
untouched/No one survives untouched/No one survives."<br>
<br>
Near the end of the first set, he tells this story: "Last summer, I went
 driving out in the desert near Reno -- we just flew to Phoenix and 
rented a car and drove around. And in the desert we cant upon a house 
that this old Indian had built of stuff scavenged from the desert. And 
on his house there was a sign: THIS IS THE LAND OF PEACE, LOVE, JUSTICE 
AND NO MERCY. And at the bottom of the sign, there was an arrow pointing
 down this old dirt road. And it said: THUNDER ROAD." This gets the 
biggest hand of the evening.<br>
<br>
The second half is, if anything, harder to believe. It begins, after the
 usual twenty-minute intermission, with Bruce stepping to the mike and 
saying: "All right all of you bootleggers out there in radioland. Roll 
them tapes!" And he comes on with a performance that deserves to be 
preserved: when a guitar has to be sent backstage for repairs, he calls a
 brief conference, and the band suddenly steps forward and sings, of all
 things, "Heartbreak Hotel," with Bruce as the very incarnation of his 
hero. There's an encore performance of "Independence Day," another of 
those songs that didn't make Darkness, this one the most moving ballad 
version of "Adam Raised a Cain" story I have ever heard. During "Quarter
 to Three," three hours into the set, Bruce climbs to the balcony and 
sings a chorus there before he leaps ten feet down to the piano, by some
 miracle uninjured. The houselights go up, and the kids are on their 
feet, chanting -- no one is going home. And even with the announcement 
comes that the band has left the building, no one moves. "Br-u-ce, 
Br-u-ce" the chant goes on and on, and suddenly the curtain is raised, 
and there they are (Max Weinberg fresh from the shower). They roll into 
"Twist and Shout" and finally, nearly four hours after it all began, the
 show is over.<br>
<br>
Los Angeles Times rock critic Robert Hilburn is at a loss for words. 
"How do I come back and review this show," he says despairingly, "after I
 just said that the Forum was one of the best events ever in Los 
Angeles? Who's gonna believe me?" Maybe, I can only suggest, that is 
everybody else's problem.<br>
<br>
Phoenix, Saturday, July 8th<br>
<br>
My favorite comment on last night's show came from Max Weinberg on this 
morning's flight. "You know, I was thinking in the middle of the show 
that when I was twelve years old, this is exactly what I wanted to be 
doing."<br>
<br>
Later, I ask Springsteen why he had apologized. "It just seemed like the
 only thing to do," he says. "I couldn't imagine not. There was a little
 naivete in thinking that the kids are gonna come and when somebody 
tells them that there's no more tickets, they're gonna go home. They're 
not. All I know is, it should've been done better."<br>
<br>
Still, I suggest, he could have gotten away without an apology. "I 
couldn't have gotten away with it," he says, throwing me a look. "That's
 all I try to do -- live so I can sleep at night. That's my main 
concern."<br>
<br>
It's going to be a task tonight. It was 109 degrees when we got off the 
plane and into this oven, and a film crew has shown up to shoot 
tonight's performance for a TV commercial. They'll be at the sound 
check, and they'll also have cameras -- and additional lights -- at the 
show.<br>
<br>
Springsteen seems more open and eager to promote Darkness than any of 
his other albums. Despite the massive amounts of ink he has attracted, 
he has never been a particularly accessible interview, and he has never,
 ever appeared on TV. I wonder why the change.<br>
<br>
"I always had a certain kinda thing about all those things - like the TV
 ad or this ad or that ad. But I realized shortly after this album came 
out that things had changed a lot since Born to Run. I just stopped 
taking it as seriously, and I realized that I worked a year - a year of 
my life - on somethin' and I wasn't aggressively tryin' to get it out 
there to people. I was super aggressive in my approach toward the record
 and toward makin' it happen - you know, nonrelenting. And then when it 
came out, I went, 'Oh, I don't wanna push it.'<br>
<br>
"It's just facing up to certain realities. It was ridiculous to cut off 
your nose to spite your face. What it was, was I was so blown away by 
what happened last time, I initially thought of doing no ads. Just put 
it out, literally just put it out."<br>
<br>
It is the first time I have ever heard Springsteen refer to a negative 
effect of the past three years of litigation and layoff. It's strange 
he's not more bitter, I suggest. "At the time that that went down," he 
explains," I wasn't mentally prepared. I knew nothin' about it. It was 
all distressing to me. There were some good times, but what it was, was .
 . .the loss of control. See, all the characters [on the LPs] and 
everything is about the attempt to gain control of your life. And here, 
all this stuff, whether it had a good effect or a bad effect, I realized
 the one thing it did have was it had a bad effect on my control of 
myself. Which is why I initially started playing, and why I play. That's
 what upset me most about it. It was like somebody bein' in a car with 
the gas pedal to the floor."<br>
<br>
(I have only heard him explain his relationship with former manager Mike
 Appel better on one occasion: "In a way, Mike was as naive as me," he 
said then. "'You be the Colonel, and I'll be Elvis.' Except he wasn't 
the Colonel, and I wasn't Elvis.")<br>
<br>
There are of course other reasons for the TV commercial: while 
Springsteen is enormously popular in certain areas, in others he is all 
but unknown. This is particularly true of the South. And it is 
especially difficult for people who live in the Northeast and Southwest,
 where Springsteen already is a star, to grasp his commercial 
difficulties elsewhere. Anyone who sells out both the Los Angeles Forum 
and Madison Square Garden (three nights at the latter) ought to be a 
national star, but for a variety of reasons, Springsteen is still not 
there yet. Most of this has to do with his lack of acceptance on AM 
radio - on that side of the dial, he is a virtually invisible quantity: 
"Born to Run" made it to Number Seventeen, and "Prove It All Night" will
 be fortunate to be that high, principally because both emphasize 
electric guitars, which makes them hard rock, not exactly what AM 
program directors are currently looking for.<br>
<br>
In Phoenix, however, all of this can be forgotten. Phoenix was the first
 town outside of the New York-New Jersey-Philadelphia-Boston region 
where Springsteen became popular. In the words of Danny Federici, "This 
is the first place I ever felt like a star." It's hard to believe, 
driving past these deserted desert streets at 7:30 on a Saturday 
evening, that the 10,000-seat Veterans Memorial Coliseum is sold out. 
But when the show is over, I know what Robert Hilburn felt.<br>
<br>
It's not that it's just another fantastic show. This is another goddamn 
event, and it goes farther than the Roxy, with all of that's show's 
intimacy, innocence and vulnerability, but with an added factor of 
pandemonium. It's the sweetest-tempered crowd I've ever seen, and at the
 same time, the most maniacal. Bruce dedicates the show to the town in 
memory of the time "when this was about the only place I could get a 
job," and the crowd gives it back. During "Prove It All Night," three 
extremely young girls in the front row hold up a hand-lettered sign 
written on a bedsheet. Quoting the song, it says, JUST ONE KISS WILL GET
 THESE THINGS FOR YOU. And he gets them, during "Rosalita," one after 
another, as they race up to kiss him, lightly, on the cheek. A fourth 
darts up, and just. . .reaches out and touches his hand. And finally, 
three more race up and bowl him over. ("This little girl, couldn't have 
been more than fifteen, and she had braces on her teeth," Springsteen 
exclaims later. "And she had her tongue so far down my throat I nearly 
choked.")<br>
<br>
I've never seen anything like this in such a big hall. Before the 
encores -- which include "Raise Your Hand" and the inevitable "Quarter 
to Three" -- are over, not seven, but seventeen girls have climbed up to
 hiss him, and there are couples dancing, actually jitterbugging, on the
 front of the stage. The cameramen are torn between filming Bruce, who 
is pouring it all out, and simply shooting the crowd, which is pushing 
him farther and farther.<br>
<br>
It's a perfect climax to a week of rock &amp; roll unparalleled in my 
experience. All I know is, it lives up to the grand story Bruce told in 
the midst of "Growin' Up." The story has become a virtual set-piece by 
now, but that night he added a special twist. You should get to hear it 
too. Maybe it fills in some of the cracks, maybe it explains just why 
Bruce Springsteen pushes people to the edge of frenzy.<br>
<br>
It began with a description of his family, house and home, and his 
perennial battles with his father. "Finally," he says, "my father said 
to me, 'Bruce, it's time to get serious with your life. This guitar 
thing is okay as a hobby, but you need something to fall back on. You 
should be a lawyer' -- which I coulda used later on in my career. He 
says, 'Lawyers, they run the world.' But I didn't think they did -- and I
 still don't.<br>
<br>
"My mother, she's more sensitive. She thinks I should be an author and 
write books. But I wanted to play guitar. So my mother, she's very 
Italian, she says, 'This is a big thing, you should go see the priest.' 
So I went to the rectory and knocked on the door. 'Hi, Father Ray, I'm 
Mr. Springsteen's son. I got this problem. My father thinks I should be a
 lawyer, and my mother, she wants me to be an author. But I got this 
guitar.'<br>
<br>
"Father Ray says, 'This is too big a deal for me. You gotta talk to 
God,' who I didn't know too well at the time. 'Tell him about the lawyer
 and the author,' he says, 'but don't say nothin' about that guitar.'<br>
<br>
"Well, I didn't know how to find God, so I went to Clarence's house. He 
says, 'No Sweat. He's just outside of town.' So we drive outside of 
town, way out on this little dark road.<br>
<br>
"I said, 'Clarence, are you sure you know where we're goin'?' He said, 
'Sure, I just took a guy out there the other day.' So we come to this 
little house out in the woods. There's music blasting out and a little 
hole in the door. I say, 'Clarence sent me,' and they let me in. And 
there's God behind the drums. On the bass drum, it says: G-O-D. So I 
said, 'God, I got this problem. My father wants me to be a lawyer and my
 mother wants me to be an author. But they just don't understand -- I 
got this guitar.'<br>
<br>
"God says, 'What they don't understand is that there was supposed to be 
an Eleventh Commandment. Actually, it's Moses' fault. He was so scared 
after ten, he said this is enough, and went back down the mountain. You 
shoulda see it -- great show, the burning bush, thunder, lightning. You 
see, what those guys didn't understand was that there was an Eleventh 
Commandment. And all it said was: LET IT ROCK!'"</strong></div></blockquote><strong class="text-strong"><br>

Blue Collar Troubadour<br>
<br>
At 34, Bruce Springsteen has never been better, as his barnstorming road show rolls across the USA<br>
<br>
<br>
by Chet Flippo<br>
<br>
Groaning and sweating cannonballs, Bruce Springsteen jounces along in 
the passenger seat of a packed-to-the-gunwales van barreling out of 
downtown Detroit at 4 in the a.m. He radiates waves of locker-room 
Ben-Gay powerful enough to knock down a charging rhino at 30 yards. And 
he's happy. Happy as only a certifiably fanatical rock 'n' roller can be
 when he has just strapped on his Fender Telecaster guitar and blown 
away 24,039 also certifiable rock fans in the very heart of Motor City. 
Home of the Cadillac and of the Motown Sound. A tough audience. Bruce 
had just brought them to their knees with three and a half hours of 
no-mercy, flat-out rock 'n' roll played the way God intended, and now he
 is suffering for it. Even after a half-hour rubdown by his trainer, 
Bruce aches from the grueling marathon of singing, dancing and 
screaming.<br>
<br>
"Man," he rasps in that familiar Jersey Shore staccato, "this was a four
 and a half tonight." A visitor crammed up against a guitar case behind 
him asks what he means. "I usually lose between three and five pounds 
during a show," he says. "This felt like a four point five." He laughs a
 contented laugh, and the van sails on through the night.<br>
<br>
After laying out for three years, the Boss is back with a vengeance. 
Back with no flash, no lasers, no glitter, no glove. Back with his 
highly personal brand of straight-ahead, gloves-off rock overlaid with a
 deceptively folksy vox populi that has made him the poet of the 
blue-collar baby boomers, for whom his carefully wrought songs sound 
like letters from home. Just as Hank Williams and Woody Guthrie did 
before him, Springsteen articulates the thoughts of an entire class of 
people. And right now nobody does it better. In Detroit Springsteen 
learned that his new album, Born in the U.S.A., was No. 1 on the charts,
 the LP's first single release, Dancing in the Dark, was No. 2, and the 
tour was steaming along at such a pace that he had sold 202,027 
tickets--that's 10 nights--at Brendan Byrne Arena in home state New 
Jersey in just two days. And the tour (this week Bruce is in Washington,
 D.C.) is going to continue for at least a year, with forays to Canada, 
the Far East and Europe.<br>
<br>
Given all that, the trappings of rock superstardom were astonishingly 
absent backstage at Detroit's Joe Louis Arena earlier on the balmy 
summer evening. The fans milling around outside were so well-mannered 
that even the cops were yawning. No stretch limos for the rock stars; 
just unobtrusive vans. No stiletto-heeled, slit-skirted, glossy groupies
 stalking their turf. In the dressing rooms and the tunnels backstage, 
there were no drugs and nothing stronger to drink than beer.<br>
<br>
"Welcome to the 'Hardy Boys on the Road,' " laughs a management 
associate. She's kidding, of course, but there's a hearty, all-American 
air to the proceedings that one doesn't usually find at this sort of 
event. "Sit down," comes a holler from a man with a familiar rock face. 
He's assistant road manager Chris Chappel, for many years in The Who's 
organization. Chappel explains he's happy to be here for many reasons. 
For one: "Sanity, no drugs." For another, he's a fan: "When I first saw 
Bruce at Hammersmith Odeon [in London] in 1975, I knew immediately that 
the rock 'n' roll torch had been passed from the Beatles and the Stones 
and The Who to him. I had never seen such a great show. And I still 
haven't."<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Bruce is winding up his usual exhaustive sound check in a 
cavernous hall. He is one of the few rockers who bothers to do a 
walk-through, listening carefully from every area of the hall while his 
band is playing. Then he disappears into his dressing room, to remain 
alone until the show starts.<br>
<br>
This is a typically exuberant Bruce crowd, screaming Brr--uuu--ce chants
 that sound like "boos" to the uninitiated. They hold up lighted matches
 and those 99-cent discount lighters and scream for Br--uuce some more. 
Then they stomp and shake the floor and do the Wave and cheer each 
other. When Bruce finally gains the stage at 8:35 p.m., the spontaneous 
roar from 24,039 throats is seismic, physically felt, unsettling in its 
intensity. Most performers never get this kind of ovation when their 
concerts end. Bruce is clearly among friends in Detroit. He's a folk 
hero in his biker boots, tight jeans, kerchief headband and 
short-sleeved sport shirt with its sleeves rolled up to display his 
newly pumped-up biceps. And he's sporting a proud attitude that proves 
to be contagious when he rips into Born in the U.S.A., a blue-collar 
anthem of the '80s if ever there was one (kid gets drafted, sent to 
Vietnam, then prison and every other raw deal possible, but remains a 
"cool rocking Daddy in the U.S.A."). The applause is, of course, 
thunderous. Some of the blue collars in the $14 seats behind the stage 
(all tickets are $14 or $15) unfurl American flags.<br>
<br>
The show, measured by any rock standard, is brilliant. The E Street Band
 is solid enough to support the World Trade Center. Springsteen's pacing
 of 30 or so songs over almost four hours is improvised, based on the 
mood of the crowd. He leaps into the audience during Tenth Avenue 
Freezeout, pressing the flesh like an old pol and eliciting the 
predictable hosannas for being an authentic man of the people. Truly, 
though, of any rock star today, he is the only one who can fearlessly 
wade into a crowd and know that the crowd will protect him. He can hush 
the crowd in a second when he starts an eerie, haunting tale of a mass 
murder in the song Nebraska, his hollow vocal accompanied only by his 
own harmonica breaks and by Nils Lofgren's sepulchral guitar. Welcome to
 the First Church of Rock, brothers and sisters. Then the Reverend Bruce
 gets into his preaching rap. Waving his arms and assuming his best 
Sunday morning mode (he likes to watch TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart), he
 intones: "Do you believe, that if you die, during the course of this 
show, due to excitement, that you're going to HEAVEN?" Cheers from most,
 some of whom spill their beers and worse things on less fortunate 
brothers and sisters. "Did you know," he continues later, "that God 
created the Pink Cadillac, and He said it was great!" And with that 
Springsteen tears into Pink Cadillac, a searing rocker that cheerfully 
meets every definition of what rock haters say is wrong with rock 'n' 
roll (mainly the celebration of free will).<br>
<br>
Bruce then sits on the lip of the stage and tells stories: about how he 
almost became a baseball player before rock 'n' roll saved him, about 
his childhood, about his relationship with his father. He becomes a 
beneficent uncle, and the crowd is transformed into rapt children, 
hanging on every word and laughing at the right times. Then Bruce, like 
any savvy showman, gets them up on their feet and dancing as he piles 90
 mph encore on 110 mph encore, till he literally exhausts the crowd. 
They file out, drained and smiling, long after midnight. If you hadn't 
known better, you might have thought that a tent revival had just let 
out. Perhaps it had.<br>
<br>
An hour or so later, after getting his rubdown and recovering, Bruce 
sits down in his dressing room for a rare interview. He drinks mineral 
water and offers his visitor the same. He's wearing his layer of Ben-Gay
 beneath two sweatshirts, G.I. jungle-camouflage pants and suede cowboy 
boots. Up close, he is quite extraordinary-looking, with the sort of 
sculpted features that Hollywood executives and art directors lust 
after. Though he doesn't often do so, he clearly likes to talk -- even 
about the new fitness program that got him those new muscles.<br>
<br>
"Well," he laughs, "I had never exercised before in my whole life, 
y'know? And I didn't tour after the Nebraska record, I didn't feel like 
going out on the road. And I met this trainer, Phil Dunphy, and he said 
come on down, and he just got me into it, into strength training and 
weight training and running." (At 34, the Boss spreads a lean 155 pounds
 on his 5'10" frame). "Do you know that I run six miles a day now?" he 
says, seemingly surprised himself. "It's really helped on the road. 
Before, I would come out the first night, and I'd almost die, wanna 
throw up, gaspin' for air."<br>
<br>
Still, Springsteen is hardly a health nut. "It's just that I'm not like I
 was," he says, which was a thin, wiry, almost waiflike junk-food 
addict. "You know, when I was growing up, I never ate in a restaurant 
till I was 22 years old; that's when I got a record deal. My parents 
never ate out. They didn't have the dough. All I knew was fast, 
fast-food. That's all I had the dough for. Later, any kind of restaurant
 was intimidating. Like, what do you say to the guy who meets you at the
 door, what do you call him . . . ? Maitre d', right. Yeah, who knows? I
 didn't know."<br>
<br>
Springsteen's American Dream-like ascent from poverty forms the basis 
for many of his autobiographical songs. Born in 1949 in Freehold, N.J., 
he was the first of three children born to Douglas and Adele 
Springsteen. His father, a bus driver, was often out of work. An 
unexceptional student, Bruce by his own account was "dead" until he got a
 pawnshop guitar when he was 13. "I know that rock 'n' roll changed my 
life," he says with feeling. "It was something for me to hold on to. I 
had nothing. Before then the whole thing was a washout for me. It really
 gave me a sense of myself, and it allowed me to become useful, which I 
think most people want to be." Once he discovered rock 'n' roll, he took
 to it with a missionary zeal that has never abated. Music was not just 
the best thing going for Bruce; it was the only thing. Even girls and 
cars occupied a distant second and third place.<br>
He briefly tried Ocean County College and then, after staying behind 
when his family moved to California in 1969, became a permanent fixture 
of the club scene on the Jersey Shore, specifically in Asbury Park. 
Basically a seedy boardwalk town, Asbury Park, with its raucous, 
late-night rock clubs, was a magnet for scuffling young musicians. As 
the fastest guitar in town, Bruce became the Boss of a lively scene that
 included the likes of Miami Steve Van Zandt and Southside Johnny Lyon. 
As Bruce's manager, Jon Landau, points out, this was a strong bar-band 
enclave that was totally isolated from the trendy music centers and one 
based entirely on traditional rock 'n' roll, on Elvis and Chuck Berry 
and Buddy Holly. On top of those foundations Springsteen built his own 
tradition with his strongest points: his ability to people his songs 
with believable characters and his genuine talent for storytelling.<br>
<br>
That he did so without compromising his musical integrity says much for 
his perseverance, especially when you remember that the biggest hurdle 
in his career was his too-much-too-soon appearances on the covers of 
Newsweek and Time the same week in 1975, just after his commercial 
breakthrough with the Born to Run single and album release. Scoffers 
charged "hype" about the hoopla, leaving Bruce wary of the press, but 
Born to Run remains a rock benchmark, encapsulating Springsteen's psalms
 on rock 'n' roll as a way of life: rock theology.<br>
<br>
A lapsed Catholic, Bruce says Born to Run "really dealt with faith and a
 searching for answers. On that record I laid out a set of values. A set
 of ideas... intangibles like faith and hope, belief in friendship and 
in a better day. But you don't really know what those values are worth 
until you test them," he admits. "So many things happened to me so fast.
 I had to focus on the music and not on what was going on around me with
 the media thing or the lawsuit thing [brought by his former manager 
about recording and publishing rights]. I always felt that if the music 
was right, I would survive. But if that went wrong, then that was the 
end of it."<br>
<br>
It went very right. At around $15 per ticket at most shows, Bruce's tour
 is not raking in what the Jacksons' is, but this former poor boy from 
Jersey does only what he wants to. No watch or shrill alarm clocks ever 
schedules Springsteen. His world moves when he's ready. He finally 
bought a three-story brick mansion in Rumson, N.J., but he doesn't get 
home often. He's still a loner, still cruising on the highway alone, 
still hitting the clubs on the Jersey Shore. Bruce's new hit single, 
Cover Me, suggests he might feel a need now to share his life. ("Hold me
 in your arms / Let's let our love blind us / Cover me"), but Bruce 
keeps insisting he's not ready yet to write "married music." The 
girlfriends remain just that and no more.<br>
<br>
There's no question, though, that Springsteen's life and work involve 
heavy moral overtones. Not many rock 'n' rollers would dare to say, as 
does Bruce, that "mainly all my records try to offer some sort of 
survival course. Maybe you can't dream the same dreams when you're 34 
that you did when you were 24, you know, but you can still dream 
something. Maybe you've got to downsize some of your expectations. I 
know I have. Just in growing up, in accepting adulthood. My characters, I
 think that's what they do. They say, 'Man, I had some -- thrown at me, 
but here I still am.' That's strong and realistic, and that's what I 
want. To just paint the heroic things. Like my sister and her husband."<br>
<br>
To Springsteen, sister Virginia, husband Mickey and their two sons are 
idols. "They were married when they were kids," says Bruce. "They went 
through some hard times, got a house and raised the kids, and I admire 
them a lot. My sister's tremendously, unbelievably strong. This is real 
inspiration. Like in the song My Hometown, these are the heroic things 
that happen in most people's lives. Everyday things between them and 
their kids. Just talks and husbands and wives and families. But those 
talks maintain a sense of continuity and a sense of values. I guess 
that's hard to do these days. I know it's hard for me to do."<br>
<br>
When it gets too much, the Born to Run kid does just that. "I like to 
travel," says Bruce. "To me, the idea is you get a band, write some 
songs and go out to people's towns. It's my favorite thing. It's like a 
circus. You just kind of roll in, walk into somebody's town and, bang! 
It's heart to heart. Something can happen to you; something can happen 
to them. You feel you can make a difference in somebody's life. All I'm 
trying to do is wake up people's senses and do the same thing for 
myself. I want to make their bodies tingle. Make their blood run. Make 
them scream." And the place Springsteen does that best is onstage. "Some
 nights when I'm up there, I feel like the king of the world," he says. 
"It's the greatest feeling on earth. I can go home and get in that bed 
and sleep real sound. It's a beautiful thing. Beautiful. It can tune you
 into everything, what's happening with people everywhere. For the 
moment I feel young. Young, and I'm strong. I get the strength and the 
energy to do it from the crowd. I don't want to pass that by."</div>

Landau's Creative Touch with Springsteen<br>
<br>
<br>
by Thom Duffy<br>
<br>
NEW YORK--On June 15, Bruce Springsteen will kick off his first 
worldwide tour in four years in Stockholm, showcasing his two new 
Columbia Records albums "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town" with a new 
band--guitarist Shane Fontayne, drummer Zachary Alford, bassist Tommy 
Simms, and E Street Band keyboardist Roy Bittan. He previewed the tour 
June 5 with a live international broadcast from Los Angeles syndicated 
by the Album Network and will open his U.S. tour at New Jersey's 
Meadowlands Arena July 23.<br>
<br>
Recently, Springsteen's longtime manager and producer, Jon Landau, sat 
down for a rare interview with Billboard to discuss the making and the 
marketing of these new albums and his role in bringing forth 
Springsteen's music, in what Landau calls a 17-year-long creative 
dialog.<br>
<br>
Billboard: This is the first time Bruce has opened a tour in Europe.<br>
<br>
Jon Landau: We've had a growing and wonderful relationship with the 
audience in Europe. Sometimes what happens is, you put your record out 
and an artist concentrates so exclusively on their home base, that by 
the time you turn your attention elsewhere, the record has gone through 
its initial cycle. So this time, we thought, let's begin with an 
old-fashioned, essentially promotional tour there before we dig down in 
North America for the rest of the year. I think it's going to be an 
exciting way to start. We've really had success there that has built 
steadily since "The River," which was the first real tour we did in 
Europe [in 1981]. We've had great assistance from Bob Summer [president 
of Sony Music International] and Bob Campbell [VP of creative operations
 at Sony Music International] and the heads of all the companies we've 
gotten to know over the years.<br>
<br>
BB: The summer shows announced thus far are all indoor dates.<br>
<br>
JL: My feeling, both here and in Europe, was just to start out indoors, 
with two new records and a new band, especially because it's Bruce's 
intention to concentrate heavily on the new music.<br>
<br>
BB: This is the first major tour without the E Street Band.<br>
<br>
JL: For the '70s and '80s, no artist could have been better served by a 
band than Bruce was by the E Street Band. That's just a fact. Fantastic 
people. Fantastic musicians. Bruce and the E Street Band could have 
toured forever.<br>
<br>
But at some point, he just needed to sort of shake things up, just to 
give himself some new challenges and new inspiration. After the Amnesty 
International tour ended [in late 1988], it was pretty clear he didn't 
want them waiting on him. This was a time for everyone to make their 
individual moves.<br>
<br>
This wasn't a totally sudden thing. He made the "Nebraska" album by 
himself, made "Born In The U.S.A." with the band, then made "Tunnel Of 
Love" basically by himself. So the logical extension of that, having 
made two of the three last studio records by himself, was, "Let's see 
what somebody else sounds like."<br>
<br>
BB: "Human Touch" was recorded largely with drummer Jeff Porcaro, 
bassist Randy Jackson, Roy Bittan on keyboards, and other guest 
musicians. How then was the tour band recruited?<br>
<br>
JL: We tried to be pretty discreet about it and we looked at some 
incredible musicians. We had people come in and had a half-dozen songs 
that represented the musical range we were looking at. It got to a 
certain point where Zach and Tommy and Shane felt like the right choices
 and we had them come back for a week. At the end of the week, we said, 
"Let's go for it." That was two weeks before "Saturday Night Live." And 
I've got to tell you -- just as an original Bruce fan -- I can't wait to
 see the shows because of what's already happening. These guys are very,
 very hot. And they're really in sync with each other.<br>
<br>
BB: Let's talk about how these albums took shape, first "Human Touch."<br>
<br>
JL: The very first song that is on the records was created in December 
1989. It was "Roll Of The Dice." Bruce had been writing for a while but 
hadn't found his voice yet for this particular work. Both musically and 
in terms of the inspirational quality of the lyric, the touch of 
R&amp;B, many different factors in that song turned out to have meaning 
for the record as a whole.<br>
<br>
After that, a number of songs emerged fairly quickly. But in the spring 
of 1990 was when he came up with "Human Touch." There was the unifying 
piece, there was the statement, and we were all real excited at the 
time. "57 Channels," which was one of the very last songs to be written 
[for "Human Touch"], was a great little moment because its inclusion 
brought another dimension in terms of the music and the humor. Those 
were some of the high points.<br>
<br>
BB: "Lucky Town," in contrast, was written comparatively quickly by Bruce, alone in his home studio.<br>
<br>
JL: That type of record... "Born To Run," "Nebraska," "Tunnel Of Love," 
and "Lucky Town" were all albums where what's on the record is almost 
all of what he's created. "Darkness," "The River," "Born In The U.S.A.,"
 "Human Touch" are albums where there's a lot of experimentation and 
recording beyond what's on the record. So there's two different modes. 
So anyway, we had finished "Human Touch" and he said, "I feel this album
 is finished but I still feel like writing." He was working at home. He 
called me and he had something. It was "Living Proof' and "Waist Deep In
 The Big Muddy." I told him in so many words, "Hey, if there's any more 
where this came from, let's just keep going." I went out there a little 
while later and he played me the "Lucky Town" album, 85% to 95% the form
 that it's in. That was in the summer of '91. It was just breathtaking.<br>
<br>
BB: Why did you decide on the simultaneous release of the albums?<br>
<br>
JL: We thought about putting one out and holding one back. And we 
thought about mixing them together. But it really was two separate 
musical experiences that were made consecutively, in relatively the same
 time frame. And the reason we came up with the simultaneous release was
 that it simply was the truest representation of what had occurred. He 
made two albums.<br>
<br>
BB: What was Columbia's reaction?<br>
<br>
JL: It was really dreamlike for me. Their enthusiasm was heartfelt. I 
told them about it in a sensational meeting in October [1991] that I had
 with Tommy [Mottola, president of Sony Music] and Donnie [Ienner, 
president of Columbia Records]. I can truthfully say there was no 
discussion on the point at all. They understood it.<br>
<br>
BB: Let's go back to the recording of "Human Touch." From a production 
standpoint, were things done differently this time around?<br>
<br>
JL: Not really. You're dealing at all times in the studio with Bruce, 
the writer. The dominating factor is the song. In terms of [fitting] 
contemporary taste, it's just not something that's actively discussed. 
There's sure a lot of guitar for a '90s record and there's a lot of 
guitar because that's what felt right for these songs. On the other 
hand, there was some general awareness that we're making a record in the
 '90s for the '90s. And we certainly wanted to meet the prevailing taste
 halfway -- which is to say you want to show some intelligent 
flexibility as long as you're being true to your work.<br>
<br>
BB: How would you describe your role in Bruce's creative process?<br>
<br>
JL: My role has evolved over the years. There's a level at which it's 
just this one big dialog we've had for 17 years. This is all one big 
conversation. Sometimes it's about tours, sometimes it's about songs. At
 this point, Bruce is thoroughly knowledgeable about the studio and, 
along with Chuck Plotkin and Roy Bittan, I'm there trying to, number 
one, fill any gaps that I think anybody's missing and, number two, I 
find myself focusing a great deal on the songs and the singing, and 
interacting with Bruce about the songs. It's a very comfortable, 
ongoing, and fulfilling interaction and, as you say, sometimes it means 
stepping back. In the case of the "Lucky Town" album, Bruce was in his 
home studio setup and he sent me the tape and I said, "Hey, just keep 
doing what you're doing."<br>
<br>
BB: From the studio to the marketplace, your role shifts.<br>
<br>
JL: Now we are into the artist and manager [relationship]. But again, 
it's a collaboration. Bruce is a person who is in control of his own 
destiny, so it is a collaboration.<br>
<br>
BB: The broader issue is how a top artist and manager respond to changes in today's marketplace.<br>
<br>
JL: The response is real obvious and I think we're accomplishing that. 
We generally like to put the records out in a very direct fashion, not 
pre-digested for everybody with a lot of pre-interviews and things that 
can feel too hyped. Having done that, now is obviously the time to step 
forward and let people know what's on your mind and get out and do these
 shows.<br>
<br>
BB: That low-hype launch, however, may have resulted in the lower chart positions of these albums.<br>
<br>
JL: Once again, we're very aware of that. But we tend to get our 
priorities internally and then find our best way of getting the music 
out there. We're in this for the long haul. And the records went up. The
 records are where they are now. The records are going to go back up. 
The life of these records will be long.<br>
<br>
BB: What philosophy guides your business and marketing decisions?<br>
<br>
JL: The point is, with Bruce, the creative leads. Songs, records, shows,
 and now videos. That's the body of work. That's the career. So what we 
try to do is make anything that calls attention to Bruce to be related 
to one of those four things. In other words, we're not trying to go for 
things that simply publicize the person as a celebrity because Bruce 
long ago decided that, if he was going to be well known, [it would be] 
for what he did. We're trying to help increase the focus on what Bruce 
has created, to help people find what it is there that might be of use 
to them. You go to radio with the things that work for them and 
collaborate with radio. They have been friends to us for 20 years. But 
you also have to go supplement that, and in the case of a great touring 
artist like Bruce, the tour has become the centering experience. It's a 
gathering point and it personalizes the experience for people in a way 
nothing else can.<br>
<br>
BB: Barbara Carr has worked with you for the past 12 years. What is her management role?<br>
<br>
JL: We function as a team; 90% of the work we do has become 
interchangeable. She participates with me in the creation and execution 
of all our ideas in presenting Bruce's work to the public.<br>
<br>
BB: Some say your management style is fairly secretive.<br>
<br>
JL: I have learned from a history of working with Bruce that when you're
 in the studio, things change. And the reporting of information that's 
outdated as soon as it's printed just confuses people. So the approach 
we've taken over the years, for better or worse, is that we really have 
nothing to say until we're done, then we try to be as informative as we 
can be. Although that can make a certain amount of sense to us, the down
 side can be for a long period of time to go by without us saying 
anything. And maybe that's not the best thing. That's something I would 
think about doing differently when this particular part of the process 
recurs because it's not our intention to withhold information.<br>
<br>
BB: You have chosen not to discuss the terms of Springsteen's record 
deal at Columbia. But there has been widespread speculation about 
Springsteen's future with the label.<br>
<br>
JL: We have not had discussions with anyone else. We have no plans to, 
and we couldn't be happier with their performance to date. Tommy 
[Mottola] and Don [Ienner] have shown a tre- [article has a cut here - 
ed] keting needs of the '90s. There's no question they're at the top of 
their game. I would go a step further and say that, in the course of 
working together, we have all started to develop the kinds of 
collaborative relationships that augur well for the future.<br>

BB: Looking back and looking ahead, what is your perspective of your work with Bruce Springsteen?<br>
<br>
JL: We hooked up over what I took to be something unique about Bruce's 
creativity and some ability I had to help in the process by which he 
expresses himself. And after all this time, it's continued to be as 
rewarding and fulfilling a form of work as I could have ever hoped for. 
Certainly, everything I do with Bruce is designed to add to the sum of 
worthwhile music that's being created in our generation's time. If we 
talk, as we have, about the record-company things and marketing 
things... I love all that stuff and I never undervalue it and its part 
of my job.<br>
<br>
But at the end of the day, for me, when Bruce cranked into "Living 
Proof" at "Saturday Night Live," or as I look ahead to our first night 
in Stockholm, and the true force of what we're going to do next is 
revealed, that's what it's all about for me. It's what it's been all 
about for me since the first time I saw Bruce perform. As long as I feel
 that way about it, then I remain totally motivated.</div>

<br>
ON his dyspeptic 1983 album, ''Trouble in Paradise,'' Randy Newman 
recorded a song in which Bruce Springsteen confesses that he is tired of
 being ''the Boss.'' So he asks Mr. Newman, that sardonic 
singer-songwriter, if he would briefly fill in as America's most beloved
 working-class hero. This is one of the few instances in pop-cultural 
history where anyone dared to poke fun at the sanctified Mr. 
Springsteen, where anyone had the nerve to take the mickey out of the 
Boss and his studiously manicured image as the poet of the proles.<br>
<br>
Recording ''My Life Is Good'' was the kind of jaundiced, disrespectful 
gesture that has long made Mr. Newman an outcast at life's rich feast. 
Making fun of the Boss was like snickering during a Holy Communion 
service, like plopping down on a whoopee cushion during a State of the 
Union address. Was Mr. Newman not aware that ridiculing Bruce Almighty, 
at least in the minds of white baby boomers, was like sneering at Mom, 
apple pie and the American flag? Was Mr. Newman not aware that lines 
like ''At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines'' 
rivaled T.S. Eliot and William Carlos Williams for symbolic nuance and 
verbal ingenuity? Was Mr. Newman not aware that yea, verily, Mr. 
Springsteen sat at the right hand of the Father? What was wrong with 
this guy?<br>
<br>
<br>
These thoughts are occasioned by ''Springsteen: Troubadour of the 
Highway,'' a very serious, very portentous, generally yuck-free 
exhibition that pays homage to New Jersey's beloved poet laureate. The 
traveling exhibit is now at the Newark Museum through Aug. 29, and 
includes videos, memorabilia and more than 70 photographs by artists as 
varied as Annie Leibovitz, Frank Stefanko and David Rose; 41 of the 
photos are by Mr. Springsteen's kid sister Pamela.<br>
<br>
Promotional materials on the museum's Web site (<a href="http://www.newarkmuseum.org/" class="postlink">www.newarkmuseum.org</a>)
 say the show ''explores Springsteen's use of cars and highways as 
motifs in his music and in related visual imagery'' in much the same way
 that Raphael once used religious iconography in his work. The publicity
 materials continue: ''From his songs 'Thunder Road' to 'The Ghost of 
Tom Joad,' and at every point along the way, Bruce Springsteen has 
employed images of cars and the highway as central features of his 
music. His restless characters are on the move, sometimes on the hustle 
and often on the run. Speeding off the edge of town, down the Jersey 
Turnpike, or across the desert, their physical movement matches their 
psychic and spiritual searches. His images work as metaphors for 
Springsteen's meditations on both the promise and disappointments of 
America.''<br>
<br>
Oddly, the museum does not mention that Mr. Springsteen's father was a 
bus driver, which may explain the singer's metaphorical obsession with 
vehicles that can attain prodigious speeds without the encumbrance of 
making frequent stops, as this would impede his characters' psychic and 
spiritual searches. Nor does it mention that you kind of need a car to 
get around in suburban New Jersey, as public transportation is at a 
premium, further illuminating the Boss's fixation on automobiles. But 
that is the subject for another show, perhaps one with even more photos 
by his sister.<br>
<br>
Many of the exhibit's photographs are widely known, like ''Asbury Park''
 by Ms. Leibovitz and ''Corvette, Winter'' by Mr. Stefanko. But Ms. 
Springsteen's lesser-known images are a byproduct of the 1995 release of
 ''The Ghost of Tom Joad.'' This was the lugubrious, commercially 
unsuccessful record inspired by Steinbeck's ''Grapes of Wrath''; when 
Mr. Springsteen sings material from this album in concert, the audience 
generally nods off or takes a bathroom break.<br>
<br>
This is where it might be advisable to bring Randy Newman back into the 
conversation. As a super-hunky (check out those forearms) Mr. 
Springsteen vogues down the ribbon of highway in his sister's photos, it
 is difficult for those of a Newmanian frame of mind to suppress a 
chuckle. Thirty years after he attained immense fame and fortune and 
bade farewell to down-at-the-heels Freehold forever, Mr. Springsteen is 
still working his Everydude act for all it is worth. The working-class 
hero who dumped the band that helped make him famous, moved to the West 
Coast and married a model, and then took up residence in tony Rumson, 
where he became bosom buddies with the late risk arbitrageur John A. 
Mulheren, who was once arrested on suspicion of plotting to kill Ivan 
Boesky, is still getting gussied up as a forlorn migrant worker who 
dreams of one day living on that mansion on the hill. This is 
inadvisable. As John Steinbeck might put it: ''Bruce: I knew Tom Joad. I
 created Tom Joad. And, Bruce, you are no Tom Joad. Tom Joad didn't pump
 iron with risk arbitrageurs.''<br>
<br>
Inadvertently, ''Troubadour of the Highway'' captures the cognitive 
dissonance that characterizes the Springsteen experience. ''Born in the 
U.S.A.,'' one of the Boss's catchiest anthems, is actually an 
anti-American diatribe deploring this nation's ill-starred endeavor in 
Southeast Asia. But nobody pays attention to the lyrics; even 
Republicans love it. ''My Hometown'' laments the closing of factories, 
even though risk arbitrageurs like John Mulheren are precisely the kinds
 of people who help get factories closed. A typical Springsteen concert 
contains several paeans to working stiffs, but the audience for these 
songs is largely affluent baby boomers and party-animal frat boys. 
Unlike Pete Seeger and Billy Bragg, who sing left-wing songs for a 
left-wing audience, Mr. Springsteen sings quasi-left-wing songs for an 
audience that really only came to hear ''Rosalita.'' This is not an 
indictment; it is a fact.<br>
<br>
This is not to accuse Mr. Springsteen of being a fake, but merely to 
indicate that popular culture thrives on some sort of healthy hypocrisy.
 It is a safety valve of sorts that lets the prosperous middle class 
walk on the wild side. How many people shelling out $57 to see Mr. 
Springsteen at the Meadowlands last year have ever been anywhere near 
the Badlands? How many teenagers from Totowa have ever been within 15 
miles of the darkness at the edge of town? At a certain point, most 
adults -- and all suburbanites -- realize that they cannot live rock 'n'
 roll lives, so they accept the nearest substitute: a rock 'n' roll 
attitude. They live tough, edgy lives, vicariously, through singers who 
live tough, edgy lives, vicariously. Let's face it: Who would listen to a
 bunch of songs about people torn between buying a Lexus and a Saab?<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen's music, strangely, has spawned precious few imitators 
and almost no progeny. It's the musical equivalent of a Ronald Reagan 
stump speech: peppy, assertive, highly anecdotal, occasionally 
censorious, fiercely obvious. Whatever he started out to accomplish as a
 youth, when he first emerged as a poor man's Bob Dylan, Mr. Springsteen
 has perfected a thoroughly American sound that is as wholesome and 
reassuring as Lawrence Welk's.<br>
<br>
But in the end, the genius of Bruce Springsteen is that he not only gets
 to sing songs like ''Mansion on the Hill,'' but actually gets to live 
in the Mansion on the Hill. In fact, he gets to live in the Mansion on 
the Hill precisely because he sings about people who do not live in the 
Mansion on the Hill, but who like to buy records about people who would 
like to live in the Mansion in the Hill, but cannot afford it, so they 
live in Secaucus.<br>
<br>
Here, we come to the central dilemma of pop music: How do you write 
about the plight of life's victims when you yourself have been in the 
highest tax bracket since the Ford administration? How do you deplore 
the false promise of the American dream when you are the very 
incarnation of it? Do you take a cue from the Rolling Stones and David 
Bowie and just leave the class warfare stuff alone? Or do you write from
 memory? Springsteen, for whatever the reason, has chosen the latter 
course. He lives in Rumson, but his heart is still in Asbury Park.<br>
<br>
Gazing at Sis's cornball photos of big brother Bruce, one cannot help 
thinking that America probably needs some rigorous guidelines governing 
the donning of the proletarian alter ego. Faux proles should be forced 
to spend a month doing community service in a housing project where they
 could meet some real working-class people. Ex-proles like Mr. 
Springsteen should accept that there is a statute of limitations on the 
migrant-worker shtick.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is a great star, and New Jersey (and the nation) is 
lucky to have him. But exhibitions like ''Troubadour of the Highway'' 
belong in the lobby of the record company (Columbia Records/Sony Music) 
that helped underwrite this exhibit, not in an art museum. Art museums, 
like it or not, are for serious people, not rock stars who like to get 
dolled up as migrant workers, the way Marie Antoinette and her frivolous
 entourage use to frolic as shepherdesses.<br>
<br>
It is probably true that the highways are jammed with broken heroes on a
 last chance power drive. But there's no reason museums should be jammed
 with them.<br>
