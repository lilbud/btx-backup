STANDING in the pit at a Bruce Springsteen concert will spoil you for life.<br>
After experiencing five of his concerts in the past year from various 
vantage points - and loving every minute of it - good fortune put me on 
the floor at the front for the only Sydney concert on this victory lap 
of Australia.<br>
There, the crowd is full of friendly disciples of this rock god and the 
mighty E Street Band, people who have dedicated their lives, and 
probably tens of thousands of dollars, to worship at their rock’n’roll 
church.<br>
It is a happy, sweaty place full of smiling, singing, dancing, sign-waving acolytes.<br>
Bruce Springsteen is a performer without equal. <br>
Above them and sometimes among them, is a performer who has become the 
benchmark for anyone who believes music can make a difference.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s songs have always wielded power to provoke thought and feeling.<br>
Yet it is in the live arena where they transcend their execution in the studio to become a celebration of the magic of music.<br>
Springsteen is an artist of surprises and even though the most ardent 
followers expect them, you had to be blindsided by the incendiary kick 
off of the Allphones Arena concert with The Easybeats’ Friday On My 
Mind.<br>
The Boss ripped it up, clearly thrilled to be adopting this Australian 
anthem into the seemingly inexhaustible repertoire of the E Street Band<br>
<br>
As they have done at every show with their tribute to The Saints with 
Just Like Fire Would and later last night with the wholly unexpected 
rendition of INXS’s Don’t Change.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is always astutely attuned to his environment and would of course be aware of the band’s current rejuvenation.<br>
As many of his diehard fans had predicted, The Boss continued with his now Australian tradition of revisiting an album in full.<br>
Melbourne got Born In The USA and Born To Run, Sydney got Darkness On The Edge Of Town.<br>
<br>
It is rare, actually never until tonight, that playing an entire album 
in the middle of a concert is a monumental occasion. At this time, in 
the life of this band, it is something you will never forget.<br>
<br>
Then so many, many songs to keep you anchored in the joyous and at times
 deeply emotional abandon of a concert you know will always stay with 
you.<br>
Waiting On A Sunny Day, Shackled And Drawn, The Ghost Of Tom Joad, 
Darlington County, Dancing In The Dark, Born To Run, Land Of Hope and 
Dreams and a version of Dream Baby Dream which brought tears.<br>
Through it all, you believed every one of his beaming grins, every 
intense frown as he ripped out the solos, every entreaty to rise to the 
occasion, the chug of beer, the crowd surf and all that booty shaking. 
That man knows how to shake his ass.<br>
And to see it and hear it and feel it from just a few metres away, is to know why music matters.<br>
Yep, it really was that good.<br>
Bruce Springsteen performs at the Hope Estate, Hunter Valley on Saturday
 and Sunday and Brisbane Entertainment Centre on Wednesday.</div>

 February 26, 2014<br>
<br>
FEBRUARY 27, 2014 <br>
THE AUSTRALIAN</strong><br>
		<br>
FROM the surprise opening song - a version of The Bee Gees’ Stayin’ 
Alive - to a celebratory climax with Highway to Hell, Bruce 
Springsteen’s show at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre last night was 
one none of those present will ever forget.<br>
By the time Pearl Jam’s Eddie Veddie joined Springsteen and the E Street
 Band for the AC/DC anthem, the band had been on stage for more than 
three-and-a-half hours, but Springsteen wasn’t done with yet.<br>
<br>
He returned for one final song, with just his acoustic guitar and 
harmonica, a dramatic, intense version of Thunder Road from his classic 
Born To Run album.<br>
Earlier, the show had unfolded in ways that not even the Boss or the 
band were expecting, delving into songs from his first album, Greetings 
from Asbury Park, N.J., then playing his 1973 album, The Wild, The 
Innocent and the E Street Shuffle, start to finish.<br>
<br>
That opening version of Stayin’ Alive sounded more like Curtis Mayfield 
than The Bee Gees, but it certainly paid respect to the city’s most 
famous band. There was some more of that with a sizzling version of The 
Saints’ Just Like Fire Would.<br>
<br>
And respect - to his audience, to the power of his band, to the timeless
 power of 40 years of songs, to the revitalising power of rock’n’roll - 
is what a Springsteen show is all about.<br>
<br>
At one point he gives a rap about the E Street Band, working the stage 
like a revivalist preacher, asking the audience: “We have come all this 
way to ask one question, ‘Have you got the spirit?’” before launching 
into a roaring version of early song Spirit in the Night. The song is 
one of their earliest yet they attack it with relish, making it sound as
 exciting as something they had just written at soundcheck.<br>
<br>
There are parts of the show which people now are coming, the young boy 
from the audience asked on stage to sing, inevitable highlights like 
Badlands, Dancing in the Dark and Tom Morello’s guitar pyrotechnics on 
The Ghost of Tom Joad. But there are other parts of the show which are 
completely in the moment.<br>
<br>
There is the joy of seeing his long-time guitar lieutenant Steve Van 
Zandt, who missed last year’s Australian tour, return to the fray, and 
the way that Springsteen bounces off his energy. He goes crowd-surfing 
and returns to the stage with a toy kangaroo and someone’s phone stuff 
in his pocket, at time working his way down near the back of the room to
 get closer to his fans, still singing.<br>
<br>
With Van Zandt back on board the E Street Band are an 18-strong force of
 nature. I still have no idea how they can respond to crowd requests, 
held aloft on signs in the audience, with about three seconds’ notice, 
and somehow play them as perfectly as something they have rehearsed for 
months. Springsteen is delighted to go off-script, playing requests like
 You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch) and Sherry Darling from 1980 
album The River.<br>
Playing The Wild, The Innocent and the E Street Shuffle is not an 
obvious choice but they make that work too, concluding with the tension 
and release of the extraordinary Rosalita, and the song suite New York 
Serenade, joined by guest Brisbane string players for the occasion.<br>
<br>
The question for the crowd at this sold-out concert was how could it 
match those two shows in this venue last year? But they left nothing in 
the tank as they delivered the kind of intensity rarely heard in stadium
 shows. They matched those shows all right.<br>
On it goes: Darlington County, The Rising, Born To Run, the nightly 
rendition of Tenth Avenue Freeze-out, honouring the memory of the late E
 Streeters Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and his band have loved every minute of these two Australian
 tours in the past year, and Springsteen leaves the stage promising to 
return.<br>
And this morning there are 12,000 people walking on air saying, I saw it and I still don’t believe it. Incredible.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band put Adelaide under their spell<br>
<br>
FEBRUARY 14, 2014<br>
THE AUSTRALIAN<br>
ADELAIDE </strong><br>
<br>
ON Wednesday night, I tossed a few dollars into The E Street Band 
Jukebox, made 12,000 people dance and broke the keyboard of Professor 
Roy Bittan via the feet of Bruce Springsteen.<br>
It’s mid-encore, just after Born To Run, the house lights are up and the
 Adelaide Entertainment Centre is rocking on the second of two nights 
for The Church of Bruce in the city of churches.<br>
Where to next?<br>
I grab my homemade sign from between my sweaty knees where it has been nestled for the past 2.5 hours.<br>
It was made just after a breakfast that morning, with a $3.25 black 
texta and a free used cardboard box from Boost Juice in the Rundle Mall 
after buying a mango magic smoothie.<br>
On one side of the sign I scrawled “Reason To Believe” from 
Springsteen’s 1982 Nebraska solo record to be worked up into the bluesy,
 full-band swagger it is played with these days.<br>
On the other side, I wrote the Eddie Floyd cover“Raise Your Hand”, which
 the E Street Band made their own as a show-stopping party song and 
released in 1986 on Live 75/85.<br>
One needs options, depending on the mood.<br>
There can only be one choice at this time, however. “Raise Your Hand” it is. We need a call to the dance floor.<br>
The sign is now above my head — I’m in the third row in the pit in front
 of Springsteen and guitarist Steve Van Zandt — when the strangest thing
 happens.<br>
The Boss looks at me and his eyes light up. We have eye contact. We’re in.<br>
I will have to check the bootleg but he may have even said “OK, buddy” or something similar. Maybe I imagined that.<br>
<br>
<br>
There is someone off to my right, very excited, jumping up and down, 
waving their arms around crazily, who thinks their sign has got up, but I
 don’t have the heart to break it to them.<br>
Bruce walks down to the front of the stage to me, takes my sign and 
takes it back and puts it at the base of his mic stand as is tradition 
with audience requests.<br>
Everything from now on is a bit of a blur. One also becomes very selfconscious.<br>
Is my handwriting OK? Would my mother and father, both teachers, be proud of the shape of that letter A?<br>
Why didn’t he take my “Summertime Blues — 41 degrees” sign the night 
before — they beat me to it and opened with it — when I’d spaced out the
 letters so evenly?<br>
Does The Boss realise that the sign he is holding has been wedged between my sweaty legs all night on this 42-degree day?<br>
Bruce yells out “Stevie!!” or something similar — I don’t think it was 
“Miami Steve!!!” like on the live album but I’ll forgive him — and Van 
Zandt hits that lick. The E Street Band join him.<br>
The crowd are up. Bruce is up, too, on top of the piano. He is dancing on Roy’s piano at my whim. Holy smokes.<br>
That’s when trouble strikes: Bruce is too excited, stumbles on to Roy’s adjacent keyboard and breaks it.<br>
“I broke Roy’s keyboard,” Bruce tells the crowd, laughing.<br>
There doesn’t seem to be any keys in the sound mix at all now. Bruce pauses as the song limps along for a few bars.<br>
It sounds like my request is all over, 60 seconds in. This is not what I envisioned. I kind of want to hide.<br>
Not to worry. This is the legendary E Street Band.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Professor is suddenly heard again — maybe he just stopped playing 
the piano in shock or has now swapped instruments — and the song roars 
back to life.<br>
Bruce does a lap of the arena through the crowd. By now, it feels like everyone in the pit has high-fived me.<br>
Whatever they played would have got a great response, of course.<br>
But there is something magical about watching Bruce Springsteen and The E
 Street Band — recently named the greatest live act on the planet by 
Rolling Stone — play your song live, without notice, on the spot, and 
get the whole house bouncing to it.<br>
Springsteen has never needed encouragement to mix up his shows, though 
the “stump the band” sign requests have become a tradition up to several
 times at each show in recent years.<br>
During last year’s 10 Australian shows the band played 79 different 
songs. This year, after the first five shows in Perth and Adelaide, they
 have already hit that mark.<br>
<br>
<br>
I attended all last year’s shows and have seen him play great runs in 
Europe and the US in recent years — Hyde Park with Sir Paul McCartney 
and Paris on Independence Day — but this Australian tour so far has been
 more varied than any.<br>
<br>
Some fans believe the recent decision to release live downloads of each 
gig is driving Springsteen to overhaul his set lists even more than 
normal each night.<br>
NJ.com blogger Stan Goldstein, a longtime New Jersey fan who reports on 
each show around the world, wrote after the Adelaide double-header of 
Springsteen’s “hot streak” in Australia.<br>
“Bruce is mixing up the set list like a mad scientist,” he wrote.<br>
Where to next?<br>
The initial reaction is to try and find a YouTube clip to relive that song on Wednesday night.<br>
Then again, maybe it is better to keep it as a memory, a moment in time, never to be relived again.<br>
I just hope “The University of Musical Perversity” doesn’t bill me for the keyboard.<br>
Sorry, Professor. But I blame The Boss.</div>

SPRINGSTEEN HONORS MUSICAL MENTOR</strong><br>
<br>
Jean Mikle, @jeanmikle <br>
August 19, 2014<br>
<br>
<br>
In the mid-60's a little known Jersey Shore band called the Motifs was 
packing venus, until their young frontman was sent to Vietnam.<br>
<br>
Growing up, David and Bryan Cichon had heard many stories about their Dad.<br>
<br>
Mostly it was their Mom, Carolee, who told them. But sometimes other 
family members and friends would reminisce as well. They'd talk about 
this band, The Motifs. Their Dad, Walter Cichon, was the band's lead 
singer.<br>
<br>
"They told us how popular they were," said David Cichon, now 47, who 
lives in Morris Plains. "My mom used to say if he hadn't gone to 
Vietnam, he would have been as big as Bruce." Bruce Springsteen, that 
is.<br>
<br>
That sounded so preposterous that the brothers just had to laugh. "We took it all with a grain of salt," David Cichon said.<br>
<br>
Then, nearly 10 years ago, the two brothers heard "The Wall," a searing 
ballad about a deceased Marine whose friend visits the Vietnam Veterans 
Memorial in Washington, D.C., searching for his name on the black wall.<br>
<br>
"Cigarettes and a bottle of beer, this poem that I wrote for you; This 
black stone and these hard tears are all I got left now of you," 
Springsteen had written. "Your high boots and striped t-shirt, ah, Billy
 you looked so bad; Yeah you and your rock and roll band, you were the 
best thing this --- town ever had."<br>
<br>
Before performing the song in concert, Springsteen had spoken of Walter Cichon, talked about how the song was inspired by him.<br>
<br>
"It kind of just blew us away," Cichon said. "After we heard that song, 
my brother and I both tried to reach out to him." It took awhile, but in
 2008, Springsteen invited the Cichon boys to his concert in Orlando. 
Bryan Cichon lives in Jacksonville, and David flew down to meet him and 
attend the concert. Afterward, the brothers met Bruce.<br>
<br>
"It was just basically him reminiscing about those days," David Cichon 
said. "He said to us, 'Your father was one of the best frontman I ever 
saw.' This coming from one of the very best frontmen there is, it was 
just amazing."<br>
<br>
They thanked him for writing the song. "We need to get that on an album one day," Springsteen said.<br>
<br>
The Cichon boys didn't know if he was serious, but they left their 
meeting with Springsteen believing that their father had star power 
after all.<br>
<br>
'Ahead of his time'<br>
<br>
Back in the summer of 1967, almost everyone knew it.<br>
<br>
The Motifs — from Western Monmouth County — were the hottest band on the
 Jersey Shore, and dreamed of making it big in the music business. And 
why not? They had worked every weekend, had a local hit song, and had a 
reputation as the "bad boys" of the music scene, with their shaggy hair 
and their raw sensual swagger on stage.<br>
<br>
And they had Walter Cichon, a lead singer from Howell who wore tight 
black pants and pointy-toe boots, and grew his dark hair dangerously 
long. Quiet and soft-spoken offstage, Cichon, who would turn 21 late 
that summer, was working as a printer's apprentice, hoping to learn the 
printing trade to support his young family. Wickedly intelligent, with 
an IQ of 163, Cichon, so polite and unassuming offstage, turned into a 
dynamo when he grabbed a microphone.<br>
<br>
The teenagers who packed The Motifs' shows — at venues like the I.B. 
Club in Howell or Long Branch's West End Casino — pushed up to the stage
 to get closer when Walter started to sing.<br>
<br>
"He was lean, muscular, with a chiseled face," said "Stormin'' Norman 
Seldin, 67, who was only 17 when he began managing the band. "When he 
got onstage he would instantly sweat. His hair would be drenched and it 
would hang down. You can't make what he had. He was just dynamic. He was
 special."<br>
<br>
Planting his feet on stage, his dark hair dripping sweat, Cichon would 
pound a tambourine, bang a cowbell, or shake maracas as he sang. 
Slightly menacing and a little bit wild, he was unlike any other 
frontman on the scene. And his songs, "Molly," and "If I Gave You Love,"
 were raw and deeply personal, with bits of The Kinks, The Animals and 
The Rolling Stones mixed in.<br>
<br>
"Molly," produced by Seldin and released on his Selsom Record label, 
sold 2,000 copies and drew praise from WMCA disc jockey Joe O'Brien, who
 said The Motifs "have a new, original sound, that is strictly their 
own."<br>
<br>
Springsteen dubbed Cichon "the best front man in New Jersey at the time," in a 1999 interview he gave to Mojo magazine.<br>
<br>
"He was ahead of his time," said Cichon's band-mate and best friend, 
Murray Bauer, who now lives in Cherry Hill. "The songs he wrote, they 
were really coming from inside him. They were very personal." Bauer and 
his girlfriend, and Walter and Carolee, who would become his wife, would
 double-date all the time. He and Walter would finish each other's 
sentences. They did everything together.<br>
<br>
Seldin, a teenage music entrepreneur, had met The Motifs after the band 
called his father's Red Bank jewelry store and asked if Norman would be 
interested in managing them. Seldin at the time was managing and 
recording six different rhythm and blues bands from Asbury Park and Long
 Branch. He had already brought bands like The Duprees and The Coasters 
to the Shore. The Motifs wanted to meet him.<br>
<br>
They came to Seldin's parents' house in Fair Haven for an audition, and 
set up their amps in the living room. The first song they played was The
 Kinks' "You Really Got Me." He didn't know what to make of them. They 
were loud and raucous and raw. They didn't sound like the R&amp;B 
groups, or anyone else he had heard.<br>
<br>
"My mother convinced me to give them a chance," Seldin said. He took 
them in the studio and produced their single. From there, the band took 
off quickly.<br>
<br>
Hottest band on the Shore<br>
<br>
They played the West End Casino in Long Branch and more than 800 kids 
paid $2 each to see them. "We must have sold 200 records that night," 
Seldin remembered.<br>
<br>
They began opening for bigger bands at shows Seldin produced at the 
Keyport-Matawan Rollerdome, including The Duprees and The Young Rascals.<br>
<br>
The Motifs could earn $125 or more for gigs, at a time when 
Springsteen's first major band, "The Castiles," took home $75 a show. 
The teenage Springsteen, often accompanied by his Castiles' bandmate, 
George Theiss, would frequently go to Motifs' shows and sometimes 
aggravated the group's young female fans by angling their way closer to 
the stage so that Bruce could study Walter up close.<br>
<br>
Walter's brother, Raymond, the group's lead guitar player, showed the 
young Springsteen some guitar riffs when Bruce would come over to the 
Cichons' house in Howell. Bruce liked the homemade pierogies that Helen 
Cichon, Walter's mom, made for the boys. He also liked watching The 
Motifs practice and discussing guitar techniques with Ray.<br>
<br>
"He said we were the first rock stars he ever met," said John 
Lewandoski, The Motifs' drummer, "but he could approach us, because we 
were all friends. We would be practicing and Bruce would come over. He 
said Ray was the best guitar player on the Shore."<br>
<br>
Walter's younger sister, Anna Vance, remembers going to see the band at 
the I.B. Club, and watching the teenagers throng toward the stage. The 
band even made a television appearance, she said, performing on Jerry 
Lewis' Muscular Dystrophy Telethon very early in the morning in 1967.<br>
<br>
"I remember my Mom getting me up to watch it on TV," said Vance, who 
lives in Toms River. "There were on at five o'clock in the morning, some
 oddball hour."<br>
<br>
The band's future seemed bright. But then, in the fall of 1967, Walter 
Cichon was drafted. He joined Company A, 3rd Battalion of the Army's 8th
 Infantry.<br>
<br>
The Vietnam War was raging. Walter had a wife, Carolee, and two very 
young sons. But, having completed his training, Staff Sgt. Cichon 
volunteered to go to Vietnam.<br>
<br>
"He really didn't want to go into the service," said Bauer, the band's 
rhythm guitarist, who was drafted the same day as his best friend. "He'd
 say, 'Now that we're doing so good, I'm going to get drafted.' But once
 he was in the service, he was like an All-American, he gave it 100 
percent."<br>
<br>
"He felt the kids going over there were so young," Cichon's late mother,
 Helen, said In a 1999 interview with the Asbury Park Press. "He was a 
little older, and he thought maybe he could help the younger soldiers."<br>
<br>
Cichon was 21 when he went to Vietnam. On March 30, 1968, in Kantom, 
then-South Vietnam, witnesses said he emerged from a trench with a hand 
grenade and was shot in the head. An Army buddy told his mother that he 
held Walter in his arms until the rest of the unit was forced to retreat
 under heavy enemy fire.<br>
<br>
Walter and about 10 other dead or wounded soldiers were left behind. His
 body was never recovered, and he was declared missing in action. His 
oldest boy, Gordon Bryan, was almost two; his second son, David, was 11 
months old. The boys were split up. Bryan was raised by their 
grandparents and David stayed with Carolee. They would never get to know
 their father, who received two Purple Hearts, one with an Oak Leaf 
Cluster.<br>
<br>
In July 1975, the Army paid for his funeral. A white memorial marker was placed at Evergreen Cemetery in Farmingdale.<br>
<br>
'It was never the same'<br>
<br>
"I just pretty much gave up my music altogether after he died," Bauer said.<br>
<br>
Seldin agreed. "I really thought he would come back because he was such a
 survivor," he said. "After that, it wasn't the same. Before, it was raw
 and it was honest.. Where are you going to get that again?"<br>
<br>
Walter's father, the senior Walter Cichon, died in 1969, a year to the 
day after his son's death. Helen Cichon, who passed away in 1999, said 
in an interview with the Press that her husband "went a little crazy 
after Walter died. He was drinking so heavily. He never really recovered
 from it."<br>
<br>
The family was to experience even more tragedy. In 1980, his brother, 
Raymond Cichon, who had become a salesman for a Freehold food service, 
died suddenly at his mother's house, several days after telling her and 
other friends that he had been beaten up. No charges were ever brought 
in the case.<br>
<br>
The Motifs continued on after Cichon and Bauer were drafted, but they 
were a different, lesser band. "All the originality was gone after 
Walter left," Motifs' drummer John Lewandoski said. "We became more of a
 club band."<br>
<br>
Personnel came and went, times changed, and the band finally fell apart 
by the late 1970s, after briefly going through a disco phase. Bass 
player Vinnie Roslin had left much earlier, to join Springsteen in his 
band, Child, which became Steel Mill, the Boss' most popular pre-E 
Street Band. Roslin passed away in 2012.<br>
<br>
Seldin still performs regularly in the Shore area, playing piano and 
singing his original songs, as well as some cover tunes. In 2008, he 
released a two-cd set of music he'd produced, "Asbury Park Then and 
Now," which included The Motifs' two songs among its 45 tracks.<br>
<br>
Walter's wife, Carolee, remarried and had two more children. She was 59 when she died in 2007.<br>
<br>
Springsteen, of course, went on to become a rock and roll icon. Although
 many on the Shore may have forgotten about Walter Cichon, Bruce 
Springsteen never did.<br>
<br>
The title of the song "The Wall" and its inspiration came from 
Springsteen's long-time friend and sometimes songwriting partner Joe 
Grushecky, but the song was not written until after Springsteen and his 
wife, Patti Scialfa, paid a visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in 
Washington, D.C. While there, they had looked up Walter Cichon's name, 
Springsteen later said.<br>
<br>
Springsteen first performed the song in 2003, and then again in 2005. 
But he did not release it until this year, when it was included on his 
eighteenth studio album, "High Hopes."<br>
<br>
If there was ever any doubt that the song was about Walter Cichon, 
Springsteen erased it in his liner notes for the album, along with a 
longer piece about The Motifs' frontman that appeared on his official 
website. He described The Motifs as "a local rock band that was always a
 head above everybody else. Raw, sexy and rebellious, they were the 
heroes you aspired to be."<br>
<br>
"He still performs somewhat regularly in my mind, the way he stood, 
dressed, held the tambourine, the casual cool, the freeness," 
Springsteen wrote. "The man who by his attitude, his walk said 'you can 
defy all this, all of what's here, all of what you've been taught, 
taught to fear, to love and you'll still be alright.' His was a terrible
 loss to us, his loved ones and the local music scene. I still miss 
him."<br>
<br>
His bandmates do, too.<br>
<br>
"When I think about what could have been, it blows me away sometimes," 
said Lewandoski, 68, who lives just south of Allentown, Pa., and is 
retired after a career as a sales manager in the food business.<br>
<br>
Bauer, 67, is also retired, after 42 years in real estate. "I think 
about it myself sometimes. If Walter hadn't died,"" his voice trailed 
off. "It would have been a whole different life."<br>
<br>
Springsteen dubbed Cichon "the best front man in New Jersey at the time."</div>

<br>
Even the music industry is astonished by Bruce Springsteen. An industry,
 peerless in the generation of legend around nonentities, of vast 
conceit around minimum competence, has seen its most carefully nourished
 protégés eclipsed at a stroke by this New Jersey loafer aged 26 who 
seems in every way the antithesis of star material. In America, his 
album, Born To Run, has earned unprecedented acclaim, while his stage 
performance is compared to that of Dylan, Presley and Mick Jagger. The 
most jaded American palates have concluded him to be the only hope for 
the regeneration of rock music. <br>
<br>
Any musician who has appeared simultaneously on the covers of Time and 
Newsweek magazines, and whose record company is apt to purchase one 
fifth of a theatre’s seats to encourage him, must be either wonderful or
 bad beyond the worst description of his species.<br>
<br>
Having seen Springsteen at Hammersmith and being careful now in weighing
 my words, I can only say that he is indeed wonderful. He is as 
devastating a talent has pop music has ever produced, more so for having
 been practically produced by accident. <br>
<br>
His records, as good as they are, leave one unprepared for the strength 
of his stage performance. He is discovered alone in the spotlight, a 
small unkempt figure in baggy trousers and a woolen hat. No studio has 
yet captured the resonance of his voice. <br>
<br>
Of all analogies, the one with Dylan is the most appropriate and yet 
misleading. There is the same originality, uncontrollably, raging, 
uttered in its own unmistakable voice. But Dylan is a convert where 
Springsteen was born. He is a child of rock and roll and all its 
clichés; the motor cycles, the funfairs the drag racers. He sees them 
with both illusion and disillusion with punk love and weary hindsight.<br>
<br>
In rock’s terrible conformity there is the further excitement to be felt
 at the birth of an entirely new character. Insubstantial, strangely 
innocent with his shirt hanging out, he is somehow excluded from even 
the smart dressed members of the E Street Band.  Perhaps we see rock 
music’s first Charlie Chaplin. Whatever we see it does represent 
extraordinary hope.  Let us hope he remains ignorant of his power for a 
little while yet. <br>

THE TIMES (UK) <br>

<br>
Bruce Springsteen is here at last. Not to save rock and roll or to 
present us with a vision of its future but to lead us to a rediscovery 
of all the qualities, great and small, which made it mean something in 
the first place; and in so doing, to entertain us like we have never 
been entertained before. <br>
<br>
Wednesday night’s three hour concert, the second of his long delayed 
British tour, ended in an explosion of fun, whose completeness was made 
possible only be Springsteen’s ability to take us to the other extreme: 
we dance more euphorically to “Rosalita” and “Cadillac Ranch” because 
for having experienced the bitter nostalgia  and rich ironies of “Racing
 In the Street” an the searing intensity of “Badlands”. <br>
<br>
Springsteen and his infinitely flexible, almost absurdly enthusiastic 
six piece band, seemed to be at the top of their form. They began with a
 dramatic arrangement of “Follow That Dream” , an old Presley song whose
 lyric served as a manifesto of the entire evening; ten minutes later 
the singer was already down among the audience delivering a verse of 
“Tenth Avenue Freezeout”  while hoistered high on the shoulders of his 
supporters. <br>
<br>
Other expressions of ebullience abounded, the best example coming, 
amazingly, from the dark side of the footlights. As Springsteen prepared
 himself to sing the first verse of “Hungry Heart”, his most likeable 
song, he was beaten to it by the fans, who carried the melody lustily 
and with praiseworthy precision. <br>
<br>
An awareness of his responsibilities leads Springsteen to vary the 
content of his concerts from night to night. Manchester’s surprises 
included the dedication of Woody Guthries, “This Land Is Your Land” to 
Bob Marley and a storming folk rock treatment of John Fogerty’s “Who’ll 
Stop The Rain”. There was the debut too of a song which examines 
someone’s responses on the night that Presley died told in quick images 
and pop references stitched together with a kind of flash cutting 
technique and arranged in the spare Nashville inflected style of “Wreck 
On the Highway” , a mode which seems increasingly likely to provide his 
next  major source of musical inspiration. <br>
<br>
There were sequences which illuminatingly juxtaposed songs of similar or
 contrasting attitudes and there was the warming realisation  that his 
new up tempo songs , disappointingly thin when heard on “The River”, 
worked perfectly in the context for which they, clearly,  they had been 
designed. <br>
<br>
He left us with a new illusion; that after 25 years of larking about 
this at last was rock and roll and what everybody else does ought to go 
by some other name.<br>

<strong class="text-strong">A PROMISE FULFILLED…BY NOW WHAT ?<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN AND THE E STREET BAND<br>
LIVE AT WEMBLEY STADIUM -JUNE 4, 1985<br>
<br>

<br>
London always get something special from Bruce Springsteen. In 1975 when
 he was a promising but marginal figure it was where he found himself 
confronted for the first time by the hard sell that record companies 
sometimes inflict upon their contracted artists.  The lesson was taken 
to heart. On his return, six years later, he tore into Wembley Arena 
like a man hell bent on exorcism as if London was where he had to prove 
to himself and the world that he had achieved success without 
compromising the integrity he fights so hard to define and by which he 
stands or falls. <br>
<br>
On Wednesday evening, in the vastness of Wembley Stadium, he chose a 
rare moment of calm towards the end of his three hour concert to remind 
his 72,000 listeners of the importance he attaches to that relationship.
 It was one of several signs that, despite his newfound  status as the  
tabloid  newspapers favourite  pop sensation, he continues to respond 
primarily to the whisper of his conscience. <br>
<br>
There had, after all, been plenty of scope for doubt. Was the  “Born In 
The USA” album  not a too calculated simplification of his virtues ? Who
 among his old admirers had not been dismayed by the announcement that 
his 1985 British tour would consist only of stadium concerts ?  Could it
 not be said in fact that the past year<br>
had been the story of a sell far harder than anything attempted in 1975 ?<br>
<br>
Perhaps in pop music there are no alternatives.  Perhaps the only thing 
 is to be more popular than you were last year. At Wembley on Wednesday,
 as the end of the first 75 minutes and when Springsteen and The E 
Street Band took their customary break, the sun was bright, the 
temperature high and the crowd were cheerful, yet for all but the few 
hundred crushed closest to the stage there was no feeling of true 
engagement at all.<br>
<br>
Only a brand new song, s steel braced road narrative called “Seeds” had 
illuminated  set otherwise deficient in surprise or zest. No this was 
just another rock and roll picnic –another hot ticket. It was like 
Wimbleton; you see more on television and you don’t get your pocket 
picked. <br>
<br>
Then the second half began and the shadow of the stadium rim started to 
spread across the field, he began to unfold us in his magic. Where even 
“Thunder Road” had sounded coarse and perfunctory, now “Hungry Heart” 
and “Rosalita” shouted their joy across the darkening sky. Prefaced by a
 heartfelt retelling of his old Elvis story, the first batch of encores 
came and went in a rush. For the final gallop ending with “Twist and 
Shout”, he was joined by his old lieutenant Steve Van Zandt whose 
humorous  presence had been badly missed. <br>
<br>
Now the promise was being fulfilled. The contract kept. The stadium 
reduced to the dimensions of a club. Now even those in the far distance 
could forget the way the ropey sound lagged behind the image on the 
giant video screens. But bigger – louder –brighter –what happens next ?</div>

<br>
In the evening I go with Nancy to the Bruce Springsteen concert at the 
Hammersmith Odeon. This is the first show outside the US for a 26 year 
old Jersey Boy who has been hailed as the new Dylan, Lennon, Van 
Morrison and so on. The trouble is that the enormous reputation has been
 chiefly created by CBS Records and there is a certain skepticism <br>
around as to the legendariness of Springsteen. So,  was this the new 
Messiah ?  Was this to be one of those concerts that fathers tell their 
sons about in years to come ?<br>
 Of course, the concert didn’t start until fourty five minutes after the
 advertised time-and we kept having wretched announcements about it 
being your last chance to get cigarettes and smokes before the concert 
began. The air inside the Odeon was so foul and heavy that this was 
hardly doing anyone a favor.<br>
Nor did Springsteen start too well. A solo with piano. His croaking 
straining voice sounding as though  he had just done a six week Gumby 
season- the spotlights all over the place. No, definitely no magic until
 the full six piece band strolled on and everyone was riveted by the 
white suit and matching white trilby of the tubby, middle aged sax 
player, Clarence Clemmons.<br>
The band went off at such a lick that one could sense the relief. 
Springsteen leapt into action-twitching and leaping and throwing himself
 into strange spasms as he urged the band on. The sound system failed to
 make head nor tail of Springsteen’s poetry, but the band kept the 
evening alive –and he did three encores.<br>
Afterwards –a party given by CBS in the balcony bar. Talked with John 
Walters, a very funny man….Final word on Springsteen from Walters –<br>
<br>
“ We came expecting the Messiah but we got Billy Graham instead.”<br>

“ An interesting film idea via Angela Elbourne. A proposal that I should
 be seen in the US trying to track down Bruce Springsteen; using his 
songs as an excuse to visit various parts of the US; viz Asbury Park. In
 the end, we would meet and exchange whatever. The idea that intrigued 
the authors of this proposal is the difference between English 
public-school middle class comedy writer and American working class rock
 idol – or the similarity.</div>
