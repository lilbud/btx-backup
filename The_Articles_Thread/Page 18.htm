BY TIMOTHY FINN<br>

Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band at the Sprint Center</strong><br>
<br>
That church from Topeka that preaches the blasphemy of (among other 
things) rock and roll exercised its freedom of speech across the street 
from the Sprint Center on Saturday night. But the more spiritual and 
evangelical expressions of the heart and soul occurred inside the arena,
 where for more than three hours Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band
 unleashed a show for the ages. It was one steeped in love, respect, 
compassion, sorrow, elation, grief and regret and one that rocked, 
stirred and inflamed the congregation from the floor to the rafters 
nearly all night.<br>
<br>
The inferno was ignited immediately, when Springsteen and his band, now 
bulked up with a big horn section and several more background vocalists,
 greeted the crowd with a brassy, soulful version of “Kansas City.” 
After that came two songs from “Darkness on the Edge of Town”: “Prove It
 All Night” and an urgent version of “Candy’s Room,” one highlight in an
 evening of many.<br>
<br>
The setlist this night was stellar, drawing both hits and deep-album 
cuts from across his bountiful catalog. It included favorites like 
“Hungry Heart” and “Badlands” and standards, like “Born to Run,” but 
also a few classics for his early fans, such as “The E Street Shuffle” 
and “Incident on 57th Street.” That one, performed upon request from a 
fan bearing a handwritten sign, isn’t necessarily a great live song, but
 it was a much-appreciated treat for anyone who has followed Springsteen
 since the music that preceded his career-changing “Born to Run” album.<br>
<br>
As appreciated as the redemption of that request was, it was probably 
the only lull in a show that was otherwise relentless and soul-stirring 
from start to finish. Since 2008, the E Street Band has lost two 
founding members: Danny Federici and, more recently, saxophonist 
Clarence Clemons. For this Wrecking Ball Tour, named after Springsteen’s
 latest album, the band has absorbed its losses by expanding, adding a 
vocal section now called the E Street Choir and a five-piece horn 
section that includes Jake Clemons, nephew of Clarence. The additions 
have transformed an already stout and steady rock/soul ensemble into a 
brawny and brassy rock/soul/gospel orchestra. At times the differences 
were profound, as during the remodeled version of “The E Street 
Shuffle.” Other times the band showed its diversity, as during “Shackled
 and Drawn,” a rousing gospel ballad from “The Wrecking Ball” album.<br>
<br>
The orchestra deserves a torrent of hosannas for its freewheeling 
precision, and they all start with the leader of the band, who still 
lives up to a reputation born in the early 1970s: for being a fireball 
of energy and unrepentant zeal. He is a preacher, a salesman, a secular 
revivalist, a healer and a huckster, hokey at times, but never 
insincere. During “Hungry Heart,” he waltzed along the satellite walkway
 halfway up the floor, then crowd surfed, on his back, back to the 
stage. And what he’s selling is exactly what his congregants ordered: a 
blitzkrieg of rhythm and soul and rock and roll and sermons that promise
 justice, deliverance and redemption, no matter how dire the 
circumstances that precede it.<br>
<br>
Springsteen was an open supporter of President Obama, yet there was no 
overt political pandering this evening, only songs like “We Take Care of
 Our Own,” a rock-hymn whose themes are as spiritual as they are 
political. But most of this show was about themes deeper than politics. 
In the wake of the storm that destroyed so much of the northeast, songs 
like “My City of Ruins” evoked a heavier gravity.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, in these anxious times, songs like “Dancing In the 
Dark” — which rocked the joint as hard as any song — evoked an even 
warmer message of hope and perseverance. During that one, Springsteen 
responded to more signs in the crowd, pulling women on stage to dance 
with Clemons, Nils Lofgren and himself (Bruce got the mother/daughter 
combo). For the bright and poppy “Waitin’ On a Sunny Day,” he brought on
 stage a girl who looked no older than 7 years old to sing a verse or 
two. Things got really cute for a while.<br>
<br>
They ended with one of his most beloved songs, which became a tribute to
 one of his most beloved band members. After he sang the signature line 
in “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” — “as the change was made uptown and the 
big man joined the band” — everyone on stage froze and the video screens
 broadcast images of Clarence Clemons (and Federici, too). For several 
minutes, the crowd applauded and cheered and whistled and roared as it 
regarded those images. Then Jake Clemons ripped into the song’s 
signature saxophone riff and the room went berserk one more time.<br>
<br>
There could be no better ending to this evening, which preached a few 
sermons: that that life survives the deepest of sorrows; that the heart 
may not forget but it does heal and forgive and discover redemption and 
salvation; and that, if you’re going to hand-paint signs for public 
display, better they promote music and love than hatred and intolerance.<br>

<br>
Bruce Springsteen in concert at the Wachovia Spectrum on Oct. 20, 2009. </strong><br>
<br>
And so it ends. Or at least the Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street 
Band chapter does.  The Boss played his last show at the Spectrum in 
South Philadelphia on Tuesday, bringing it all back home with a taut, 
toughened up Born in the U.S.A. and a show that held together from start
 to finish more cohesively than any other in the run, while also 
providing the broadest sampling of work from the full range of his 
career.<br>
<br>
Along with B. in the U.S.A., the album that got a welcome shot of 
attention was The River, the masterful 1980 double LP that sadly got 
left off the played-in-its-entirety list. Springsteen made amends by 
opening with the sorrowful "The Price You Pay," and soon followed that 
with "Out In The Street."<br>
<br>
Instead of following the completed B in the U.S.A. with "Waiting On A 
Sunny Day," Springsteen moved the requests portion of the show till the 
end, and kept the vibe serious with "Promised Land" and "The River," the
 latter finished off with a wordless coda sung in the near falsetto 
voice that he's often employed to eerie effect in his non-E Street 
shows. And for another sort-of shot of The River, there was "Loose 
Ends," the yearning outtake that surfaced on Tracks that's way up 
towards the top of my own personal list of Springsteen songs that fell 
through the cracks.<br>
<br>
Let's see, what else marked this as the best of the four final Spectrum 
shows? An encore that began - after Springsteen name checked food bank 
Philabundance - with "Spirit in the Night," with original E Street 
drummer Vini "Mad Dog" Lopez taking over the throne from Max Weinberg 
for the tune. There was a "Kitty's Back" that swung as suavely as if it 
was 1973, with Springsteen, pianist Roy Bittan and most welcome 
trumpeter Curt Ramm improvising to most satisfying effect.<br>
<br>
As always, there was the hectic Irish jig set-staple "American Land," 
the pro-immigration inclusionary agit-prop frenzy where Springsteen 
shouted out to "the Blacks, the Irish, Italians, the Germans and the 
Jews," among others, giving his listeners the history lesson that "the 
ones that built our country, we're all trying to keep down." And after 
Clarence Clemons got his now usual intro - "Saxophonist... Libertine... 
Author.. He's bigger than Shakespeare!," there was an off the cuff, 
sweetly soulful cover of  "Save The Last Dance For Me," appropriately 
addressed to "Brother Spectrum" that brought the number of different 
songs played over the course of the four-night stand to 73.<br>
<br>
And of course, that wasn't all: After the appropriate finisher "Thunder 
Road," gave us all a chance pull out of the dirty old building to win, 
there was a final "Rosalita," who came out after all, even though she 
wasn't on the set list. Springsten then bid his people adieu: "Thank you
 Philly! Thank you Spectrum!"<br>
<br>
Sorry to get carried away there, but it was a truly great show. How 
great? As great as the Spectrum 50th birthday show of September 1999, 
I'm saying, and Springsteenophiles will know what I mean. Nice one, 
Boss. You did your part in closing the building down in style.<br>

Review: Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band at the Wells Fargo Center<br>
 <br>
The Philadelphia Inquirer</strong><br>
<br>
There’s a Bruce Springsteen quote on the wall of the National 
Constitution Center, which is currently housing an exhibit called From 
Asbury Park to the Promised Land. It reads: “The American idea is a 
beautiful idea. It needs to be preserved, served, protected and sung 
out. Sung out.”<br>
<br>
Four miles south at the sold-out Wells Fargo Center on Wednesday night, 
Springsteen went to work, putting enthusiastic emphasis on those final 
words.<br>
<br>
The nearly three hour show that ensued was - remarkably, considering the
 gravity of the State of the Union subject matter on his defiant new 
album Wrecking Ball, and the fact that, let’s face it people, the guy is
 now 62 years old - every bit the ecstatic revival meeting and master 
class in rock and soul catharsis that Springsteen’s ardent fans have 
come to expect over the course of a 40 year career.<br>
<br>
Yes, with the support of his now 16 strong E Street Band - augmented 
with two back up singers, a percussionist and a five man horn section, 
including the late Clarence Clemons’ nephew Jake Clemons, who acquitted 
himself just fine  on saxophone - he ventured out to sing into the 
middle of the Wells Fargo floor before crowd surfing all the way back to
 the stage.<br>
<br>
Yes, he slid on his knees across the stage, just like in the old days. 
And yes, he included a pair of especially-for-Philly nuggets from back 
in the day: The roller rink organ rarity “Seaside Bar Song.“ which he 
prefaced by saying “I played this at the Main Point… I think,” and the 
joyous Dylanesque ramble “Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street,” from his 
1973 debut album Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.<br>
<br>
(There was also a Celtic-tinged rocked-out take on Nebraska's "Atlantic 
City," that was a late addition to the set list. The song, whose 
hope-against-hope theme fit in nicely with the concerts thematics, might
 have been added due to its "they blew up the Chicken Man in Philly last
 night line" or perhaps to spite New Jersey's Republican Governor Chris 
Christie, the Springsteen superfan who the day before had called for the
 Boss to play Atlantic City's new Revel casino and plans to attend the 
Wells Fargo show on Thursday but was absent last night.)<br>
<br>
At the start, Springsteen introduced himself as “Mr. Badlands, the 
Jersey Devil himself …His latest record stood on the top of the 
Billboard chart for ONE consecutive week!” And in the end, he tore the 
house down with the old-school R &amp; B one-two punch of Eddie Floyd’s 
“Raise Your Hand” and “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,”  taking to the crowd 
and sitting down in the row in front of this critic to have a swig of 
somebody’s beer during the former.<br>
<br>
But amidst all those hijinks, the Boss also took the time to pose 
probing musical questions about the condition of the populist, communal 
ethos that he sees as being at the heart of the American idea.<br>
<br>
And he went looking for answers. “Where’s the promise, from sea to 
shining sea?” he sang, over Max Weinberg’s pounding drums, in the 
opening salvo, “We Take Care Of Our Own,” which suggests that we should,
 and concludes that we don’t. (On the concourse, volunteers for 
FoodTrust.org were collecting cash, doing their best to help out.)<br>
<br>
Later, he banged a big marching band bass drum himself, on the downcast 
soul ballad “Jack Of All Trades,” an only moderately successful Wrecking
 Ball tune that stepped up its game with mournful elegance in its live 
version.  <br>
<br>
This iteration of the E Street Band has more vocal power than ever, and 
Springsteen put it to use in digging deep into gospel and soul grooves. 
He prefaced “My City Of Ruins,” a song originally written for a 
crumbling Asbury Park that fit seamlessly on 2002’s post-9/11 
spirit-lifter The Rising, by saying “It’s good to be back in the City of
 Brotherly Love. Brotherly love, that’s hard to come by these days.”<br>
<br>
For years, Springsteen has spoken like a preacher in the pulpit, 
ministering to his flock. And with singers Cindy Mizelle and Curtis King
 adding their voices to the mix, he has a more powerful arsenal of vocal
 weapons to make a 20,000 seat arena seem like church.<br>
<br>
He brought that power to bear directly on a soul music interlude that 
included covers of Smokey Robinson’s “The Way You Do the Things You Do” 
and Wilson Pickett’s “634-5789,” as well as his own gospel-suffused 
songs like “Land Of Hope and Dreams.“<br>
<br>
And a spiritual element was clearly present in “American Skin (41 
Shots),” the song that Springsteen wrote after the death of Amadou 
Diallo,  who was shot and killed by four police officers in New York in 
1999. In introducing it, Springsteen mentioned slain Florida teenager 
Trayvon Martin, and the song that turns on the phrase, “You can get 
killed just for living in your American skin” was clearly performed in 
his honor.<br>
<br>
Not everything was seamless. The Smokey Robinson segment could have been
 more silky, less shouted out. The band has only been on tour for a 
couple of weeks, and there were reports of uneven sound in different 
pockets of the arena. “Rocky Ground,“ the gospel-rap experiment that 
works so well on Wrecking Ball, is still coming together live, with 
singer-MC Michelle Moore joining Springsteen on stage to drop 16 
well-placed bars of rhyme into the middle of the song.<br>
<br>
It’s a work in progress in performance, but deserved a better reaction 
than the smattering of boos that came from disgruntled hip-hop haters. 
Rap has been around for nearly as long as Springsteen, but part of his 
fan base, it seems, would still prefer that it didn’t exist.<br>
<br>
There was another moment of Philadelphia booing, but it was more good 
natured. It came during “Wrecking Ball,” a song written in 2009 to mark 
the then-impending destruction of  Giants Stadium, with Bruce fans 
letting him have it, as he egged them on, after the line “Here where the
 blood is spilled, the  arena’s filled, and Giants played the games.”<br>
<br>
 “Wrecking Ball,” the second song Springsteen and the E Streeters 
performed, set the scene for the expertly paced evening that followed. 
It’s a song about decay and hard times and how, inevitably, “all our 
youth and beauty has been given to the dust,” and there‘s nothing we can
 do about it.<br>
<br>
Nothing, that is, except look that instrument of fateful destruction in 
the eye and say: “C‘mon and take your best shot, let me see what you‘ve 
got / Bring on your wrecking ball.” Take a good look around and assess 
just how bad things are, and along with your rock and roll band, find a 
way to celebrate all the good that remains. That’s what Springsteen 
does, and - still - he does it better than anybody else.</div>

July 14, 2002<br>
<br>
 by Robert Hilburn</strong><br>
<br>
  In a new album colored by 9/11,<br>
Bruce Springsteen powerfully fights the darkness of the soul.<br>
<br>
"I didn't want to write literally about what happened, but the emotions in the air," Springsteen says.<br>
<br>
 NEW YORK--From the bridge near his house in Monmouth County, N.J., 
Bruce Springsteen could see the twin towers of the World Trade Center on
 clear days. His sharpest memory now of Sept. 11 is driving across that 
bridge and seeing an empty sky.<br>
"I must have seen those towers a thousand times from the bridge," 
Springsteen says, sitting in a Manhattan recording studio about a dozen 
subway stops from ground zero.<br>
<br>
"I spent most of Sept. 11 in front of the television like everybody 
else, watching those pictures of the towers collapsing over and over, 
but it all didn't really hit home until I took a ride across the bridge 
and there was nothing where the towers used to be. The real world, I 
guess, is always more dramatic than something on television."<br>
<br>
Almost immediately, Springsteen began writing a salute to the hundreds 
of rescue workers who rushed into the skyscrapers the morning of the 
terrorist attacks. He planned to sing the song, "Into the Fire," on the 
nationally televised Sept. 21 telethon, but he didn't finish it in time.
 He substituted "My City of Ruins," an older song about the life being 
sucked out of Asbury Park, N.J.<br>
<br>
With its uplifting call to "rise up" from despair, "City" worked well in
 the solemn context of the telethon. Yet Springsteen remained so haunted
 by Sept. 11 that he not only finished "Into the Fire," but also began 
writing other songs, including "You're Missing" and "Empty Sky," that 
expressed the delicate emotions he felt in the days and weeks after the 
tragedy.<br>
<br>
Those tunes form the heart of "The Rising," which will be released July 
30 by Columbia Records. It's Springsteen's first studio album with the E
 Street Band since 1984's "Born in the U.S.A.," and it will be followed 
this summer by an extensive U.S. and European tour with the band. The 
tour begins Aug. 7 in East Rutherford. N.J., and includes a stop Aug. 24
 at the Forum in Inglewood.<br>
<br>
In both its length (73 minutes) and its variety of emotional tones, "The
 Rising" feels closest to "The River" among Springsteen's previous 
works. There are moments, however, as stark and disheartened as 
"Nebraska," and others as rich and joyful as "Rosalita."<br>
<br>
On a more contemporary scale, "The Rising" is reminiscent of U2's "All 
That You Can't Leave Behind." Both albums are conscious steps by major 
artists to reconnect with their classic sounds.<br>
<br>
After a series of albums with other musicians and ones that focused on 
Springsteen's transition to adulthood, "The Rising" looks at the outside
 world and tries to make sense of it all.<br>
<br>
One of the most moving songs, "Empty Sky," conveys the heartache of 
losing a loved one. The imagery seems drawn from that post-Sept. 11 view
 from the bridge:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">I woke up this morning<br>
I could barely breathe<br>
Just an empty impression<br>
In the bed where you used to be.<br>
I want a kiss from your lips<br>
I want an eye for an eye<br>
I woke up this morning to an empty sky.</em><br>
<br>
"The atmosphere in the days after Sept. 11 felt like it must have during
 wartime--the uncertainty and the anxiety and the concern," Springsteen 
says. "I don't think anyone will ever forget it, particularly here in 
New Jersey. The local communities were hit pretty hard. There were 
150-plus casualties from Monmouth County alone. You would drive by the 
church every day and there was another funeral."<br>
<br>
For those who listened in the '70s and early '80s to Springsteen's dark,
 desperate tales of isolation and the search for a sense of family and 
comfort, it's touching to see him in the corner of the Manhattan studio 
with the oldest of his three children.<br>
<br>
Springsteen, who was 14 when he began his rock 'n' roll journey, is 
describing recording equipment to Evan, 11, the same way a T-ball father
 might explain how to grip a baseball.<br>
<br>
"We have a recording setup at home, but it's not a 'studio' studio," 
Springsteen, 52, says, after introducing Evan and two cousins to a 
visitor. "It's movable equipment so one day it might be in the living 
room, then some other room.<br>
<br>
"It's so familiar to the kids that it's just like another piece of 
furniture. It's a lot more exotic to them in a place like this that is 
built for recording."<br>
<br>
It's much different interviewing Springsteen now than in the '70s and 
'80s, when you wondered if he was ever going to find relief from the 
feelings of isolation and uncertainty that shadowed him.<br>
<br>
I used to think he didn't talk about his personal life because he wanted
 it to be private But it became clear that he had no personal life in 
the traditional sense. There were girlfriends at various points and 
certainly joy over the way his music was being received, but his sights 
were always set on the next song, the next concert, the next album. 
That's where he seemed to find self-affirmation and comfort. .<br>
<br>
It wasn't until marriage to his band member Patti Scialfa and the birth 
of their first son that he felt the love and generosity of spirit he had
 long sought.<br>
<br>
Today, he's much more relaxed, talking about his family as well as his 
music. In the liner notes for the new album, Springsteen thanks Scialfa 
for "making it all possible."<br>
<br>
Although he still has a house in Los Angeles, Springsteen now lives most
 of the year with his wife and their children (Evan, Jessica, 10, and 
Sam, <img class="smilies" src="_assets/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" width="15" height="15"> near his native Freehold, N.J.<br>
<br>
"I love California," he says, wearing a sweatshirt and jeans. "I loved 
writing about it. Some part of me still feels very connected to 
California, but we have a big family at home. I grew up around many, 
many aunts and cousins. We had a street where we had six houses on it, 
my family did.<br>
<br>
"So I wanted my kids to have the same opportunity. I have a lot of great
 memories of having a big family and the different kinds of characters 
of who were in it, the different kinds of things we did. I have the 
luxury of being able to give that to my kids because my job is movable."
 He laughs.<br>
<br>
Springsteen takes the role of local citizen seriously, frequently 
performing at benefit concerts in the area. Rather than join Paul 
McCartney, the Rolling Stones and others in "The Concert for New York 
City" on Oct. 20 at Madison Square Garden, he joined some local 
musicians for two nights the same week at the 1,400-seat Count Basie 
Theatre in Red Bank, N.J. The shows raised $1 million for families of 
World Trade Center attack victims from Monmouth County.<br>
<br>
This sense of family and community runs through much of "The Rising," 
whose overriding feeling is about rallying back after the loss of 
someone close to you.<br>
<br>
Springsteen has touched on the theme before. In "Souls of the Departed" 
on 1992's "Lucky Town," he wrote about a 7-year-old boy who was killed 
in gang shootout. Reflecting a parent's protective fear, he sang, "I 
want to build a wall so high that nothing can burn it down."<br>
<br>
The events of Sept. 11 demonstrated that no wall is high enough to 
guarantee safety. There is a sense we've all entered a different 
world--and there is a prayer-like, spiritual underpinning to several of 
the songs. In "Worlds Apart," Springsteen sings, "May the living let us 
in, before the dead tear us apart."<br>
<br>
Ten months after the tragedy of Sept. 11, people still stand five and 
six deep along Liberty Street here to look through a fence at the 
remains of the World Trade Center. The most striking thing is the size 
of the gaping hole--so much larger than any TV screen could convey. You 
see reminders of Sept. 11 throughout the city. At the boarded-up fire 
station across the street from the tower site, hundreds of rescue 
workers from around the country have left uniform patches on a wall, in 
tribute and solidarity.<br>
<br>
Given the trauma of Sept. 11, it's surprising how silent pop music has 
been on the subject. Maybe other musicians have been intimidated by the 
challenge. Shortly after Sept. 11, the Onion, the satirical publication,
 published a fictional story about President Bush urging singers to 
resist recording one of those mawkish charity ballads. "To America's 
recording artists," Bush pleads, "I just want to say, please, there has 
already been enough suffering."<br>
<br>
Springsteen laughs when told about the Onion story. "I didn't set out to
 write a 9/11 album," he says. "I didn't want to write literally about 
what happened, but the emotions in the air. In the purest sense, that's 
what a songwriter does."<br>
<br>
Reinvigorated after a 1999-2000 reunion tour with the E Streeters, the 
singer looked forward to making an album with the band. Wanting "fresh 
ears" in the studio after years of co-producing his albums with a team 
that included his manager, Jon Landau, and producer Chuck Plotkin, 
Springsteen hired Brendan O'Brien, a rock producer whose credits include
 albums by Pearl Jam.<br>
<br>
Preparing for the album, Springsteen played O'Brien demo tapes of songs 
written in recent years with the E Street Band in mind--including 
"Nothing Man," which O'Brien particularly liked.<br>
<br>
One of the most powerful tracks on "The Rising," it tells of a man so 
shaken by a life-threatening moment that he becomes nearly suicidal. 
He's troubled by being described in his local paper as a hero when he 
was just doing his job. In the chilling final lines, he's sitting on the
 bed, "the pearl and silver" gun resting on his night table.<br>
<br>
It sounds like stories we've heard about some of the firefighters who 
came away from Sept. 11 feeling unworthy of the cheers, and perhaps a 
little guilty that they were still alive when some of their co-workers 
were killed while trying to rescue victims from the towers.<br>
<br>
But Springsteen says the song, which was written shortly after "Streets 
of Philadelphia" in 1994, is about the self-doubts and confusion anyone,
 including a soldier, might feel after going through a cataclysmic 
event.<br>
<br>
In addition to "My City of Ruins" and "Nothing Man," the upbeat, 
sing-along "Waitin' on a Sunny Day" and the spiritually tinged "Further 
on up the Road" were also written before Sept. 11.<br>
<br>
Most of the album's 15 songs, however, were shaped in some form by the events of the day.<br>
<br>
Like most albums that break the 50-minute barrier, from Bob Dylan's 
Grammy-winning "Time Out of Mind" to Eminem's "The Eminem Show," "The 
Rising" feels bloated in places. It would have been more consistent if a
 couple of the upbeat tracks, especially the generic soul exercise 
"Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin)," had been omitted.<br>
<br>
The heart of "The Rising," however, ranks with Springsteen's most moving
 work. The moods range from the somberness of "Nothing Man" and "Empty 
Sky" to the party-time zest of "Mary's Place."<br>
<br>
The latter is a warm tribute to the therapeutic powers of rock 'n' roll,
 with Springsteen reverting to his youth in the lyrics as he talks about
 dropping a needle on a vinyl record rather than pushing the "play" 
button on a CD player. As if trying to exceed even the trademark energy 
of "Rosalita," one of his most enduring concert numbers, Springsteen and
 producer O'Brien supplement the seven-piece E Street Band with backup 
singers, cello, violin and a five-piece horn section. The result is a 
glorious avalanche of sound. "Into the Fire" and the album's title track
 are both inspirational looks at living up to one's 
responsibilities--even in the face of life-threatening danger.<br>
<br>
Springsteen needs the resilience and optimism of such tunes as "Mary's 
Place," "Waitin' on a Sunny Day" and "The Rising" to offset some of the 
darkness in the album. The team also expands the E Street Band in other 
places, bringing in some R&amp;B vocalists on "Let's Be Friends (Skin to
 Skin)" and Pakistani musicians led by Asif Ali Khan to accent musically
 the cultural differences outlined in "Worlds Apart."<br>
<br>
The album's most compelling track, "Paradise," is a gripping personal 
testimony, and it's fitting that Springsteen returns to the solo, 
acoustic mode of "Nebraska."<br>
<br>
In the song, Springsteen looks at life and death from various vantage 
points--from the suicide bombers in the opening verse to the wife of a 
terrorist's victim in the second. The final verse tells of someone so 
shattered by the death of a loved one that he looks forward to the 
comfort of drowning. In the final lines, however, he chooses life: "I 
break the waves / I feel the sun upon my face."<br>
<br>
Just as U2 spoke of "All That You Can't Leave Behind" as a return to its
 core sound, Springsteen sees "The Rising" as a return to the "center of
 the dialogue" he has had with his fans in such landmark albums as "Born
 to Run," "Darkness on the Edge of Town," "The River" and "Born in the 
U.S.A."<br>
<br>
In 1997's "Tunnel of Love," one of his best collections, Springsteen 
began moving in a different direction. He was talking about adulthood 
and the relationship between men and women. He addressed some of those 
themes in 1992's "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town."<br>
<br>
"I think some fans were very interested in those themes and some 
probably weren't as interested," he says now. "I met a guy outside a 
restaurant after 'Tunnel of Love' and he said, 'Hey Bruce, I like the 
[old] songs about the cars and the girls.' I thought, 'Hey, if I'm 
listening to Chuck Berry, I like the songs about the cars and the girls 
too,' so I could understand what he was saying.<br>
<br>
"But I think it's important to move around as an artist to stay alive 
creatively. You can't just sit in one spot for 30 years. There is a time
 when you want to get back to the center of what you do, however, and 
that's what we've done with this record. It's more about writing with a 
little more about the world outside in mind.<br>
<br>
"This is a tough city and a tough country, and they'll both be all 
right. I felt a lot of anxiety in the air after 9/11, but I also felt a 
lot of optimism and faith and spirit. That's what I wanted to capture in
 the album."</div>

SPRINGSTEEN SAVES!<br>
<br>
By Robert Duncan<br>
Creem, October 1978</span><br>
<br>
 I walk with angels that have no place - Bruce Springsteen, "Streets Of Fire."<br>
The middle-aged white man who runs the biggest oldies shop in the very 
old city of New Orleans is ranting hysterically on the edge of tears. He
 has recently seen the movie American Hot Wax and senses that history 
has passed him by one last time.<br>
"That's right. I was a disk jockey in Canton, Ohio when Alan Freed was a
 d.j. in Akron. I was playing nigger records, and you know what Alan 
Freed was playing??? He was playing country &amp; western! Country &amp;
 western music! Then he starts playing nigger records and they fire him 
after a day. One day.<br>
<br>
"Well, I'm sitting in this coffee shop with him afterwards, and he's 
stirring his coffee real slow and looking over my shoulder out the 
window. I says to him, 'Alan, just look at what you're doing. 'And he 
says, 'What?' And I say, 'Alan, you're stirring your goddamn coffee with
 a spoon! And there's the cream and sugar sitting right over there and 
you haven't put a one of them in!'<br>
<br>
"Then I tell him that I'm just going to have to write his next contract 
for him and that he's not going to get fired no more! A no-fire 
contract! I told him that you got to ask for what you want' cause if you
 don't, they figure you ain't worth nothin' anyway! And I did it! I did 
the contract! I did his contract! Listen to me! I created Alan Feed!!! 
Did you read that in the history??? Did you see that in the goddamn 
movie??? I said, Did you see that in that goddamn movie???"<br>
<br>
And he falls into a little red-faced jig behind his cash register with 
one arm stretching forward to detain us further and the other stretching
 beseechingly towards the sky. All we asked was how much for a Huey 
Smith record.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Several hundred miles up the road from New Orleans, in an empty, 
hermetically modern conference room that is acutely air conditioned 
against the buttery summer air, Bruce Springsteen, who's never met the 
white man in New Orleans, tells me what he has been thinking about.<br>
<br>
"It's a real simple story. You grow up, and they bury you. They keep 
throwing dirt on you, throwing dirt on and dirt on, and some guys they 
bury so deep they never get out. Six foot, twelve foot down. Other guys,
 something comes along and they're able to get some of it away. They get
 a hand free or they get free one way or another.<br>
<br>
"I don't think you ever really blow it all off, but the idea is to keep 
charging. It's like anything. Everybody can't make it. You can see the 
guys on the street who aren't going to make it, and that's a frightening
 thing.<br>
<br>
"That's what I'm talking about. That some people get dug in so deep that
 there's a point where it stops getting shovelled on them and they roll 
over and start digging down. They literally roll over and start digging 
down themselves.Because they don't know which way is up. You get down so
 deep that you don't know which way's up. You don't know if you're 
digging sideways, up, down, you don't know.. until something comes 
along, if you,re lucky, and shakes you 'til all of a sudden you have a 
certain sense of direction and at least know where you're going.<br>
<br>
"A lot of people don't ever get that. You go into the bars and you see 
the guys wandering around in there who got the crazy eyes. They just 
hate. They're just looking for an immediate expenditure of all this 
build-up. They're just screaming to throw it all off. But you can't and 
it turns into, like, death throes. A guy walks into a bar, a little guy,
 and he walks up to another guy, a dome, and the little guy's looking to
 get creamed. Looking to get massacred. He wants to. 'Look,' he's 
saying, 'I'm dying here and I don't know what the fuck to do.' It's a 
scary thing when you see the guys that ain't gonna get out, just ain't 
gonna get out.<br>
<br>
"But i guess it comes down to ...You just see too many faces, you just 
see too many.. I's a funny kind of thing. It's the kind of thing where 
you can't save everybody, but you gotta try."<br>
<br>
I remember the guy in New Orleans and how his herky-jerky movements and 
his near-weeping are less like death throes than like the throes of 
post-death, the confused, bizarre, parodistic behavior of a dead body 
responding to the last garbled signals of the brain. It seems a 
remarkable burden for Bruce Springsteen to have to "try" with this guy. 
But Bruce is radiant in the sense of his mission these days, reminding 
me of no one so much as Catcher In The Rye's Holden Caulfield, whose 
similar passion steered him straight to the nuthouse. Bruce has never 
read the book, so I tell him about the key scene where Holden tells his 
baby sister Phoebe. Says Holden:<br>
<br>
"You know what I'd like to be? I mean if I had my goddam choice?"<br>
"What? Stop Swearing."<br>
<br>
"You know that song, 'If a body catch a body comin' through the rye'? I'd like-"<br>
<br>
"It's 'If a body meet a body coming through the rye'!" old Phoebe said. "It's a poem by Robert Burns."<br>
<br>
"I know it's a poem by Robert Burns."<br>
<br>
She was right, though. It is "If a body meet a body coming through the rye. "I didn't know it then, though.<br>
<br>
"I thought it was 'If a body catch a body,' " I said. "Anyway, I keep 
picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of 
rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around - nobody big,
 I mean - except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. 
What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over 
the cliff - I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're 
going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd 
do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's 
crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be. I know it's 
crazy."<br>
<br>
"Wow," says Bruce when I finish telling him the story. "That's wild."<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Three years ago, Bruce Springsteen, a nice boy who loved rock 'n' roll 
more than anything, was dragged into the ugly and brutal fluorescence of
 American celebrity. For all his naivete (that same naivete that allowed
 him, for one thing, to love rock'n' roll so much when everybody else 
had given up and gotten a job), and perhaps because of it, he bore up 
under the relentless scrutiny, managing in the process to acquit himself
 remarkably well during his first big league rock'n' roll tour. In the 
meantime, his record company made hay from his new celebrity and hustled
 his Born To Run album to number one on the charts and eventually to 
platinum sales figures. And, so, three years ago a "superstar" was born;
 surely, the poet must die.<br>
<br>
Darkness On The Edge Of Town took eleven months to record. Legal 
disputes of the kind that tend to accrue to anyone who is suddenly rich 
and famous occupies the remainder of his over two year layoff. But what 
appears to have really happened during this period is that Bruce 
Springsteen stood back, took stock of his world both in and, more 
importantly, out of rock 'n' roll, and focused back on his career with a
 newly keen and powerful vision, becoming more the artist than ever. 
This talent no longer overwhelms him of Darkness but is harnessed fully 
to a coherent, usually incisive, and definitely more mature view of the 
world. "This album's stripped down," Sprngsteen says, "to run as clean 
as possible and stay true."<br>
<br>
Paradoxically while it is stripped down, it is also more complete. Where
 there was once only hope, now there is also warning. Where he once 
dealt only with youthfulness and "kids," he now also deals with age 
("Racing In The Street") and parents ("Factory," "Adam Raised A Cain"). 
Where everything used to be about movement, the faster the better, now 
there is a concern with standing still and stiller ("Factory," "Streets 
Of Fire"). Where a sense of community was all-important, with Spanish 
Johnny and the Magic Rat and Puerto Rican Jane and Eddie and a whole 
host of people crisscrossing one another's lives, now a man stands alone
 on a hill, having lost everything and everyone, in "Darkness On The 
Edge Of Town." Where he once put certain things into occasionally 
inadequate words, now he knows to wail wordlessly. Not that Bruce has 
forsaken the highway, the kids, the gang, the words, or any of that, 
just that on this new album these concerns have unfolded to reveal their
 many facets, their true intricacies and subtleties. "Darkness," says 
Springsteen, "is a confrontation with a lot of things. Born To Run had a
 certain romantic feel. This is more realistic."<br>
<br>
But realistic is a misleading description. There's nothing cold and 
hardedged about Darkness. The realism here is more naturalism or social 
realism, realism with a purpose beyond the mere representational, 
something along the lines of what the WPA artist of the 30's employed to
 inspire the common man from his massive malaise. No doubt, there is a 
reformer, a helper at work on this record and one who seems especially 
driven to the task by deep spiritual connections. I ask Springsteen if 
he feels religious.<br>
<br>
"Yeah, well, but no in the organized way," he responds. "I was raised 
Catholic and everybody who was raised Catholic hates religion. They hate
 it, can't stand it. It's funny, I went to a funeral the other day and 
all my relatives were there and we go to talking about it. It's a funny 
thing, they're all in their thirties, my sister and all, and they all 
feel the same way I do. But their kids go to Catholic scholl and to 
church every Sunday. They're really under the gun to this Catholic 
thing.<br>
<br>
"I quit that stuff when I was in eighth grade. By the time you're older 
than 13 it's too ludicrous to go along with anymore. By the time I was 
in eighth grade I just lost it all. I decided to go to public high 
school, and that was a big deal. If you got up in eighth grade class and
 said that next year you were going to Freehold Regional it was like... 
'Are you insane??? You are dirt! You are the worst! You're a... 
barbarian!'" He gives a short laugh.<br>
<br>
I tell him that what I wanted to get at is where the idea for a song like "Adam Raised A Cain" came from.<br>
<br>
Springsteen explains: "I did read the Bible some. I tried to read it for
 a while about a year ago. It's fascinating. I got into it quite a ways.
 Great stories. Actually, what happened was I was thinking of writing 
that particular song, and I went back trying to get a feeling for it."<br>
<br>
Elsewhere Bruce has mentioned The Grapes Of Wrath (speaking of social 
realism and religious allegory) as having been a source of inspiration 
for Darkness. He readily volunteers that the movie was "one of the big 
influences," but waxes a bit guilty when asked about the book. "I 
haven't read it yet," he says, adding quickly, "but I've got it in my 
suitcase. I have got it.<br>
<br>
"The movie affected me a lot. It brought up a lot of questions I didn't 
think about before. There's the great part where he's coming back from 
prison and he finds that little guy hiding in the closet. Little guy 
says, 'They're coming.' 'Well, who's coming?' 'They're coming. Taking 
away all the land.' And then the guy comes on the tractor and it's their
 friend. They ask him, 'Who's doing this?' And the tractor guy just 
says, 'Well, I got my orders from this guy and it goes back to him.'<br>
<br>
"To me, it's like, Where do you point the gun? There's no place to take 
aim. There's nobody to blame. It's just things, just the way. Whose 
fault is it? It's a little bit of this guy, a little bit of that guy, a 
little bit of this other guy. That was real interesting to me... And it 
was great that when that movie came out it was a very popular movie." As
 I write, Darknesss is an immensely popular record.<br>
<br>
Darkness On The Edge Of Town is not a tour de force like Born To Run. 
That could never be because the things on Darkness and in Bruce 
Springsteen have become too complex, too ambiguous. The album is a 
transitional piece, in two ways. It is transitional as far as content in
 that it is a questioning of the old values and a broadening towards the
 new; it is transitional as far as Springsteen's career goes because it 
marks a full ripening of his artistic powers and the emergence as well 
of a serious social conscience.<br>
<br>
Bruce is telling me why he likes touring. "Home never had a big 
attraction for me. I get excited staying in all these different hotels, 
in a whole lot of rooms. I'm always curious what the wallpaper's gonna 
be like. Do I have a big bed or a little one? And what's this funny 
painting? Always a sense of transition." Darkness is a transitional 
record because Springsteen is devoted to the transition that is living.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
I was on the road three days and nights with Bruce Springsteen and the E
 Street Band, and that's about as good a time stand in which to hold a 
resurrection as I can think of. The problem is I don't know who exactly 
was more resurrected, Bruce and the band or me. Soutside Johnny once 
spoke glowingly of Bruce in terms of "charisma." But charisma has the 
odor of the secular. After what I saw, heard , and felt, I'm looking for
 a word that's something more in the religious price range. And maybe 
three confirmed miracles.<br>
<br>
No sweat. It's 100 degrees in Houston in July. The death toll from the 
Texas heat has topped 20 persons and is still rising and Bruce 
Springsteen is not sweating at the intermission of his titanic 
three-hour show. Now, some among our rock stars would approach such an 
accomplishment from the obvious direction - e.g. no effort, no sweat. 
But not Springsteen. "I'm jumping around and there's oceans of sweat 
coming off arms and face and all of a sudden... no more sweat! I feel my
 face, bone dry. I gues I just got no more. Weird."<br>
<br>
And then he went out for another hour and a half.<br>
<br>
Having not seen Springsteen and the band perform for nearly two years, 
what initially strikes me my first night on the road - besides the fact 
that the new songs sound great, besides the fact that he does superior 
versions of both "Fire" and "Because The Night," besides the fact that 
the band is as tight and expressive a rock'n' roll unit as I've ever 
seen, besides the fact that Clarence has achieved such elegance, such 
authority on stage and on the sax that he more than fills his billing as
 "King of the World," besides all that and much, much more - is simply 
the fact that the set is so gruelling and the tour is so long. No sweat,
 no wonder.<br>
<br>
In Houston, it occurs to me that Springsteen's rap in the middle of 
"Growin Up" is sort of the glue that binds them. He talks about the days
 when he and Steve were playing around Asbury, waiting to be discovered,
 how they can't figure out what the missing X factor is and how the 
ex-manager of the Byrds and the ex-manager of so and so have all said 
they'll come down and see them and so forth. Eventually, Bruce winds it 
around to Clarence descending from a spaceship to make the band 
complete. Space travel aside, it's clear that this is pretty much the 
way it was with this band (indeed, what band didn't count on the helping
 hand of the friend of a friend of an ex-manager sometime?), and that 
reciting the story, remembering their humble beginnings, their shared 
past, provides a sense of - if you'll pardon me - roots. That, along 
with love.<br>
<br>
As if to confirm my theory, Bruce later tells me another story about the
 early days when they first travelled to Boston and were staying in the 
attic of a friend's house where there were only four mattresses. "So 
every night after the gig we had to try and figure out whose turn it was
 to sleep on the floor." He laughs. "But it really didn't matter. The 
guys were great. They're guys who you can go through that sort of stuff 
with. It was never a down. Me and Steve would always sit back and say, 
'As bad as this is right now, it will never be as bad as it was before 
we made an album or got a break.' Who are we to complain? This is Easy 
Street. I'm lucky number one. So are all those guys. A bunch of lucky 
jokers. It's a lot of work, but you're doing something you like. We 
always considered ourselves to be way in front with the whole ball game.<br>
<br>
"I know what it's like not to be able to do what you want to do, 'cause 
when I go home that's what I see. It's no fun. It's no joke. I see my 
sister and her husband. They're living the lives of my parents in a 
certain kind of way. They got kids, they're working hard. They're just 
real nice, real soulful people. These are people you can see something 
in their eyes. It's really something. I know a lot of people back 
there..." The picture looms vivid in his mind, so does what can only be 
described as his mission. "That's why my album, a big part of it, is the
 way it is. It's about people that are living the lives of their 
parents, working two jobs... It's also about a certain thing where they 
don't give up. I asked my sister, 'What do you do for fun?' 'I don't 
have any fun,' she says. She wasn't kidding... I'm just really thinking 
about a whole lot of things."<br>
<br>
He thinks at his hands for a moment. "A whole lot of stuff went down on 
me in the last year or two and then I was around home a lot and there 
was a lot of stuff going on with the people I was friends with back 
there, and I see it from all sides. Which is why I can't go out on stage
 at night and not try and bring it home. Because... what an ingrate??? 
What a spit in the face of everything that is anything??? I could never 
do that. I'd rather get thrown off the bus. They should throw me off the
 bus at 60 m.p.h. 'You don't belong in the bus!' It's funny when I read 
something I say about this stuff. I always sound like some kind af 
fanatic, some kind of zealot. But I think there's things that people 
take for granted. How can you take it for granted? I stick too close to 
the other side to know what's real about this side. And I still got too 
many people who are close to me who are still living on that other 
side."<br>
<br>
The Bruce Springsteen tour rolls on into New Orleans in a sort of time 
warp trip from Houston, a forbidding city of the future, into this 
forbidden city of the past. "Who you got in here?" the cop who lolls 
about the lobby of our French Quarter hotel asks the desk clerk watching
 the unusual activity. "Bruce 'Springsteen,' "drawls the clerk, adding 
in his mind no doubt, "You know, that Jewish fellow from up north." 
Bruce Springsteen? That's right, or at least that's how they've got him 
on the guest manifest.<br>
<br>
Music. It's everywhere. If anyplace, American music was born here, right
 down the block from the hotel at what is now called Jackson Square and 
what was once called Congo Square because that's where all the blacks 
and their music were auctioned into slavery. Musicians. There's probably
 more per square foot in New Orleans than anyplace in the world. (Just 
ask the white man at the biggest oldies shop.) Always a horn blowing 
somewhere in the heat. It's not quite the 20th Century here. It's not 
quite reality. Maybe it's the movies, but it's not faked. around the 
corner the Good Friends Bar has amended its factory-printed sign with 
some hand-lettering: "Under new management - Same old customers." No 
future, only past in New Orleans. In the middle of Bourbon Street, a 
scrawny black kid dances a little circle, metal taps taped onto his 
raggedy sneakers. I take that back: No future, only New Orleans here. An
 existence outside of time.<br>
<br>
He's a teetotalling Yankee, whose songs these days have more in common 
with the rural West than the South. But when he talks about rock'n' roll
 as if it were some spirit creature that takes possession of a man, or, 
indeed, when he is playing on a stage like a man possessed, it is clear 
that he belongs in New Orleans, this musician/poet/Catholic/fallen-away 
Catholic/religious seeker/religious person (?)/exhortator/mad dancer and
 raspy-voiced shaman Bruce Springsteen along with his E Street tent 
show. Does he even know where he is? It's hard to tell. But of the three
 shows I saw this tour, this one is the best.<br>
<br>
Halleujah! The bibical wailing of "Adam Raised A Cain" becomes a voodoo 
chant here. The fever and "The Fever," a song he has added in Houston, 
burn white-hot, turning the soaking air to steam. The jungle drums and 
jungle sound effects of "Not Fade Away"/"She's The One" bounce off 
Jackson Square and echo back to the coastline of Africa. Like the 
spontaneous Dixieland parades that can spil down Bourbon Street at a 
moment' notice, Bruce and Clarence spil off the stage and up the aisles 
into the reaching and exultant crowd, a rock 'n' roll parade. Then 
there's "The Rap."<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen as usual steps out in the middle of "Growin' Up" to 
talk. In Houston, he told a sci-fi/horror movie story about things that 
aren't really spooky; tonight, he invokes the real thing, and it goes 
something like this:<br>
<br>
"When I was a boy there were two things in my house that my parents 
didn't like. One was me. The other was the guitar. 'That goddam guitar!'
 my father used to say. I think he thought all the things in my room 
were made by the same company, 'That Goddamn guitar. The Goddamn stereo.
 Those Goddamn records...' Anyway, one day my parents called me 
downstairs for a talk. And they sit me down at the kitchen table with 
'em and they start telling me it's about time I start getting serious 
with my life. 'And don't tell me about that goddamn guitar!' my father 
says. See, my father wants me to be a lawyer and my mother wants me to 
be an author. 'Be a lawyer,' my father tells me, 'then you'll be all 
set. Lawyers own the world!' Now, my mother's Italian and my father's 
Irish - and I'm stuck here in the middle - so they decide I should go 
around the corner and have a talk with the priest about my life. 'And 
don't say anything about the goddamn guitar!'<br>
<br>
"Okay, I go around the corner and I walk up the steps to the rectory and
 I ring the bell and after a while the priest comes out. "I'm Mr. 
Springsteen's son,' I say to the priest, 'and he told me I should come 
over to you and have a serious talk what I'm gonna do with my life. 'The
 priest, he thinks for a minute, and then says to me, 'Have you tried 
praying, my son? I think you should speak to God about this.'<br>
<br>
"So I go home and I'm thinking about how I've got to speak to God and 
how to find him and then I call up the Big Man, Clarence, 'cause he 
knows everybody. I say, 'listen, I got to talk to God about my life. You
 know where I can findhim?' 'Sure,' he said to me, 'I spoke to him last 
night. He'll be up on the hill by the cemetery tonight.' Great.<br>
<br>
"That night I go over to the hill by the cemetery and it's real dark and
 I'm climbin' the hill and climbin' until I'm almost at the top and I 
stop and I'm lookin' all around. Then I look up at the sky and I say, 
'God?'"<br>
<br>
Perfectly timed, right on the mark, out of the cavernous rapture of the 
audience a New Orleans kid yells in response: "What?" And Springsteen 
cracks up. Still laughing, he tosses back, "God's in the cheap seats 
tonight. ...Listen, God, if I'd've know I could've at least gotten ya a 
backstage pass or something." The crowd whoops. The shaman is back in 
control.<br>
<br>
Springsteen says, "'God? You there?'" At which point, Danny Federici 
hits an eerie, piercing electronic note that ricochets around his 
speakers like a bolt from heaven. Springsteen crouches in the spotlight 
in awe and in alarm. "'God, ya gotta help me. My mother wants me to be 
an auther, and my father wants me to be a lawyer and they told me to go 
to the priest and he told me to come to you and all I want to do'" - he 
pauses reverentially - "'is play my guitar...!" He pauses again. The 
music swells slightly but otherwise, there's complete silence. The 
audience sits breathless, waiting to see: Can this Yankee rock'n' roller
 conjure too? Springsteen resumes in a harsh, rushed whisper. "All of a 
sudden, there's this light in the sky above me and a great big voice 
booms out and says..." Beat. The music drops down. "'Let it rock!'" And 
the band hits it, Springsteen singing, "I stood stone-like at 
midnight..." The audience is on their feet cheering. It works!<br>
<br>
After the show a group of European journalists is ushered backstage for 
an informal press conference with Bruce. While the rest of the band 
members casually make their way to the postconcert party on the other 
side of town. Springsteen, who is as uplifting and inspiring a performer
 as there is, becomes almost vehement denying an English reporter's 
suggestion that rock'n' roll is about nihilism. Two days later I remind 
Bruce of the exchange. He makes a small boxlike gestures with his hands 
to try and contain this belief he feels is too big to contain.<br>
<br>
"Sometimes people ask," he tells me, "who are your favorites? My 
favorites change. Sometimes it's Elvis. Sometime it's Buddy Holly. 
Different personalities. For me, the idea of rock'n' roll is sort of my 
favorite. The felling. It's a certain thing... Like; rock'n' roll came 
to my house" - again, rock'n' roll becomes palpable, become flesh - 
"where there seemed to be no way out. It just seemed like a dead end 
street, nothing I like to do, nothing I wanted to do except roll over 
and go to sleep or something. And it came into my house - snuck in ya 
know, and opened up a whole world of possibilities. Rock'n' roll. The 
Beatles opened doors. Ideally, if any stuff I do could ever do that for 
somebody, that's the best. Can't do anything better than that. Rock'n' 
roll motivates. It's the big gigantic motivator, at least it was for me.<br>
<br>
"There's a whole lot of things involved, but that's what I think you 
gotta remain true to. That idea, that feeling. That's the real spirit of
 the music. You have to give to the audience and try to click that 
little trigger, that little mechanism. It's different things to 
different people. I got in a cab with a guy down South, and we're riding
 around then he says, 'Hey, you know what I like about your shows is I 
go see a concert and I'm fixed all day for the next day, and when I go 
to your shows I fell good for a week.' " Springsteen wheezes a laugh. 
"This is what it is. I thought that was a good review."<br>
<br>
Another good review: During the show that night in New Orleans, a 
primitively fortyish woman leans over the edge of the stage and hands 
Bruce a tiny object. At the end of the song, I see him lean back down to
 her, trying to return the gift, but she won't budge. Finally, there is 
nothing he can do but pocket the gift and get on with the show. "It was a
 ring. And I looked at it, and it looked like a real thing, you know, 
with stones in it. So I tell her - I can't keep this. And she tells me 
it was her grandmother's engagement ring, and she wants me to have it! 
That's gonna make me keep it? Maybe if she'd told me she'd told me she'd
 just bought it at Woolworth's for 39 cents... but her grandmother's 
engagement ring??? Wow, what's that?"<br>
<br>
That, I tell him, must be True Love. He leaves the ring with the hall 
manager with the instructions to return it to the lady should she come 
around looking, having had a change of heart. That is caring.<br>
<br>
Bruce heads back to the hotel after the press conference, and I'm over 
at the party at Acy's Pool Hal &amp; Restaurant on Sophie Wright Place. 
Situated in a poor black and white neighborhood outside the French 
Quarter, Acy's is a windowless cement floor dump where the only light is
 from the abrasive fluorescent lamps swinging over the six fully 
occupied pool tables. Something right out of the movie Fat City (there 
is in fact a city outside of New Orleans called Fat City).<br>
<br>
By the time I arrived, the crew and band had decimated the Dixie beer, 
leaving only Miller and Pabst Blue Ribbon, and Ernie K. Doe and his 
pick-up band playing off in the corner have decimated the band and crew.
 Ernie K. Doe had his one and only hit record with "Mother-In-Law" in 
the early 60's and until an intrepid advance scout from Springsteen 
party unearthed him, had been living in relative obscurity like so many 
other greats of his era in New Orleans. As I walk in, Ernie K. Doe, 
dapper in a beige multivented suit over a dark open-neck silk shirt, 
every hair carefully pomaded into place, has run out of words to the 
song.<br>
<br>
But he doesn't want the folks to stop dancing, and is repeating "Well, 
all right" endlessly over the solid locomotive beat. When after a good 
five minutes Ernie K. Doe has run out of "Well, all right"'s , he brings
 the music down and introduces the band - but not by name. "Let's have a
 hand for the man on the bass!" he shouts, and there's a round of 
applause. "Let's have a hand for the man on the drums!" and so on, until
 he gets to Clarence Clemons, who is sitting in discreetly with his sax.
 I wonder. For all Ernie K. Doe knows, Clarence is just another guy who 
sauntered in off the street. Like I say, music is at least second nature
 to New Orleans. I listen carefully to his introductions. Without 
missing a beat, with not the slightest emphasis, Ernie K. Doe calls out,
 "Let's have a hand for the man on the tenor sax!" The locomotive beat 
continues. Ernie K. Doe falls silent (these party gigs get tired after a
 while) and then while the steady semi-drunk dance floor continues to 
bop, Ernie K. Doe goes through the introductions (one more time!) for 
want of somthing better. "Let's have another hand..." Clarence Clemons 
plays on discreetly, diligently, strictly "the man on the tenor sax" 
playing for the love of rock'n' roll.<br>
<br>
As much as you can take any of the Confederacy at face value (you can't 
really), you can say that Jackson, Mississippi looks like a simple, 
sleepy town, and that it is. After a day off in New Orleans, the 
Springsteen/E Street juggernaut is off to Jackson, a couple hundred 
miles up the Delta. The auditorium there is probably the newest and 
largest structure in town, and two different times, as I'm standing in 
front of it, cars full of kids pull up to ask where they can find it. I 
tell them and assume they do, because the hall in Jackson is full later.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen says that playing new halls like this makes him 
nervous. He much prefers a place that's been "broken into rock'n' roll."
 I understand his point. The crowd here is relatively subdued, almost 
indifferent to the carpeting and new chandeliers. But belying his 
statement, the show is about as loose as Bruce and the band get.<br>
<br>
"Let's get some lights on ya. I got a pimple on my face and you probably
 look better than I do," Springsteen says to the crowd at one point in 
the show. By intermission, of course, caution has been cast to the wind 
and everyone's clapping and bopping, and crowding the front of the stage
 as much as the older security guards will allow.<br>
<br>
One underfed blond boy is particularly excited. Oblivious to the 
exhortations of the guards, he is dancing wildly at the edge of the 
stage, eyes riveted on his favorite rock'n' roller. At one point, 
between songs, he tosses a Bruce Springsteen belt buckle onstage, a 
present. Bruce picks it up, admires it, thanks the boy, and without 
thinking asks jokingly, "So where's the belt?" Need I say more? In a 
second, the fan has ripped off his belt and tosses it up, too. Next 
comes his shirt. The guards make their move. "I had my eyes closed to 
sing a verse," says Bruce, "and the next time I looked, the kid's shirt 
is on the stage. I'm looking around for his pants, when I see the guard 
grab him."<br>
<br>
There is a slight scuffle (slight compared to the heavy head-busting 
tactics of most of the sadisto New York security goons), and the boy 
disappears into the crowd. Bruce tramps the edge of the stage looking 
for the boy; implicit in his warning to the guard to cool it. Then he 
runs back to Miami Steve who relays the message to one of the road crew.
 "'Find him. Find the kid,' is what I said," says Bruce. "'Cause I don't
 want him going out.' What happens is that a lot of the security in a 
lot of places don't understand. Kids get real excited, but they're not 
mean; they're just excited. I always watch out. Like in San Diego, I had
 to jump down and get this kid out. One of the security guards had the 
kid by the head. I'd seen the kid at a couple of shows and I'd talked to
 him outside. This kid's not looking for trouble. What happens is the 
kids have a reaction to security, which is if the security guard grabs 
'em, they think they're gonna get thrown out and they try to get away. 
People just don't wanna get thrown out of the show. Anyway, this kid in 
San Diego's real excited. He runs up to the stage. They grab him and try
 to pull him back and he tries to get away. So I went down and I pulled 
the kid away and the security guards are trying not to let go 'cause 
they're afraid he's gonna do something. Finally, we sent him up onstage 
and let him sit on the side. You gotta watch. You gotta do that. I can't
 watch kids getting knocked down in the front row because that's me. 
That's a part of me."<br>
<br>
Did someone say something about a fisher of men? Maybe the times are too
 complicated for miracles. Maybe, as Springsteen says, "The enemy's 
complicated, much more subtle now." Maybe it's just hard to be a saint 
in America. Too much dirt. Too many faces.<br>
<br>
The underfed blond kid without his shirt has brought one more present to
 the backstage entrance after the show where he's waited an hour a half 
for Springsteen to make his customary appearance (I have detained Bruce 
with this interview). Springsteen picks the kid out of the small crowd 
around the door, asks him how he is, laughs and then carefully 
autographs the boy's pro-offered frisbee. "Thanks!" the kid says 
feverishly. "Thanks for comin'!" says Springsteen.<br>
<br>
As Bruce turns his attention to other fans, the hungry boy looks at his 
back with intense hungry eyes, hesitates for a second, his jaw hanging 
open, his tongue secretly wrapping itself around a pronunciation he 
wants to get right. Then as the crowd flows between the boy and his 
idol, the boy decides to do it and then blurts at Bruce's back. It's a 
word he's been working on for days, weeks, maybe months or years: it's 
his last and dearest gift to this Yankee guy who means so much to him. 
"Shalom!" he shouts. That his final, extra special gift goes unheard in 
the hubbub doesn't matter. The boy dashes off, happy to be saved again 
(at least for the week), happier that he has tried something for Bruce 
Springsteen.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
"Where you all from?"<br>
<br>
"New York City," my companion and I respond.<br>
<br>
"I was producing shows at the Fox and then Alan came up and was 
producing shows at the Fox and Paramount, too. We were both doing shows,
 but you might say I created New York City!!!" The white man in the 
oldies shop goes on and on. We're not allowed to leave.<br>
<br>
"And that Hank Williams story, that movie, ya know [Your Cheating Heart,
 1956]. There he is lying in the back of the car all dead on booze and 
pills and where was he headed for? Canton, Ohio! Did you read that? Did 
you see that in the movie? There I am backstage, cussing him all up and 
down, saying that when I get my hands on that son-of-a-bitch I'm gonna 
tear him limb from limb. I'm out 750 bucks! I was producin' a Hank 
Williams show that night and I'm out 750 bucks! 750 bucks I don't have! 
Wouldn't that've made a much better ending for that movie? Me standing 
backstage pulling out my hair and cussing him out 'cause I'm out 750 
bucks! Did you ever hear about that?<br>
<br>
"Huey Smith, the same Huey 'Piano' Smith right here on this record. 
(He's a preacher now. Don't make no money. Nooo! Huey 'Piano' Smith mows
 lawns for two bucks an hour!) So Huey says to me he just wants to make 
enough money so he can sue that produer of his. I say, 'You got it all 
wrong, Huey. That's not the way to approach it.' I say, 'Huey, I got an 
idea. You and me are gonna put on a show with all the old New Orleans 
people and were gonna do it right over there in that Superdome! And then
 you know what? Huey? We are gonna laugh all the way to the bank!'"<br>
<br>
But he isn't laughing. And as we edge out the door he's talking again. 
Half a block away as we round the corner, I'm sure he's talking still. 
Weeks later, I'm sure he's still talking and almost weeping. I'm sure 
that somewhere in the murky city of New Orleans a white man is detaining
 rock'n' roll fans with his past. And somewhere out in the heartland, 
Bruce Springsteen is digging after him.</div>

One of the best shows EVER!<br>
Madison Square Garden - New York, NY - Sun, Nov 8, 2009<br>
Featured Review</strong><br>
<br>
As a performer, Bruce Springsteen never disappoints. Last night, he and 
the E-Street Band reached back to their roots with a performance of The 
River that literally shook Madison Square Garden. I am not exaggerating 
when I say the ground moved beneath my feet!   I 've seen Bruce and the 
boys more than fifty times since 1977 and I can honestly say that I have
 never- repeat NEVER- seen a better Bruce Springsteen concert than this 
extraordinary show.<br>
<br>
Bruce has always known how to pace a concert and, as an album, The River
 follows that expert pacing. Last night's show featured lots of 
rollicking music interspersed with a more contemplative tune here and 
there to let you catch your breath....or get up and take a bathroom 
break!  And the songs were played so God damn tight !  Some of the River
 cuts are played rarely but it never showed.  The absolute highlight was
 a chilling  performance of " Stolen Car" , Bruce bathed in a soft light
 intoning- <br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">"..Each night I wait to get caught.......but I never do"</em><br>
<br>
When they finished performing The River, the band played for at least 
another hour. The entire show was 3 hours and 15 minutes, bringing us 
back to the good old days when a Springsteen concert never ended before 
midnight. The encore went on forever, with a mix of Springsteen tunes 
such as Waiting on a Sunny Day, Badlands, No Surrender and...do I even 
have to speak its name....Born to Run, as well as the old Sweet Soul 
Music, Can't Help Falling In Love and (Your Love is Taking Me) Higher 
and Higher.<br>
An amazing show from an amazing group of performers, led by The Boss- an
 E Street Band concert that will be remembered for the ages.<br>
<br>
Opening act(s): There's no time for an opening act at a Sprinsteen show!</div>

THE FIVE HUNDRED GREATEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME<br>
Rolling Stone<br>
<br>
No 18- Born To Run<br>
Bruce Springsteen<br>
Columbia, 1975</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen spent everything he had – patience, energy, studio 
time, the physical endurance of his E Street Band – to make his 
masterpiece. There are a dozen guitar overdubs on the title track alone.
 "The album became a monster," Springsteen recalled. But in making his 
third album, he was living out the central drama in its gun-the-engine 
rock &amp; roll: the fight to reconcile big dreams with crushing 
reality. He found it so hard to re-create the sound in his head – the 
Jersey-bar dynamite of his live gigs, Phil Spector's grandeur, Roy 
Orbison's melodrama – that he nearly gave up and put out a live album. 
But his attention to detail produced a timeless record about the labors 
and glories of aspiring to greatness.</div>

Wrestling With Demons in a Hotel Tryst<br>
<br>
The New York Times</strong><br>
<br>
By KELEFA SANNEH<br>
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., May 19 - Bruce Springsteen wanted everyone to 
know that the next song would be a "love song." He paused and then 
clarified, "But it doesn't go that well."<br>
<br>
It does, however, go pretty far. The song was "Reno," which may already 
be the most talked-about thing on his quiet but fervent new album, 
"Devils &amp; Dust" (Columbia). The song takes place in a hotel room, 
and the narrator is out on the sort of date that begins with a menu. 
"Two hundred dollars straight in," his companion tells him, though it 
turns out there's also a way to spend $50 more.<br>
<br>
Maybe that's what the recorded voice on the loudspeakers meant when it 
promised concertgoers an intimate evening. After the clatter and 
optimism of those pro-Kerry rallies last fall, Mr. Springsteen has 
returned to the road for a series of almost-solo shows (those 
atmospheric synthesizer sounds must have come from somewhere) largely 
devoted to "Devils &amp; Dust." At the beginning of Thursday night's 
performance at the theater at the Continental Airlines Arena (the same 
old hockey rink, bisected by a curtain), he announced, "I can use as 
much quiet as I can get." He got as much as his fans could bear to give.<br>
<br>
All right, back to that hotel room, site of one of the most titillating 
scenes in the Springsteen songbook. The only thing standing between the 
audience and unadulterated voyeuristic excitement was, of course, the 
singer himself, who absolutely oozes decency. Hearing Mr. Springsteen 
sing about a man and a woman exchanging cash and fluids is a bit like 
looking at nude photographs with an incorrigibly high-minded art 
instructor: you try to think mature thoughts, hoping he doesn't catch 
you staring at the naughty bits.<br>
<br>
That decency is a heavy weight, and perhaps no rock star less sturdy 
than Mr. Springsteen (and are there any more sturdy?) could hope to 
carry it. His new album isn't nearly as gloomy as its most similar 
predecessor, the 1995 "Ghost of Tom Joad," though it's also not as 
consistent as the beloved "Nebraska." Still, the best songs, like 
"Reno," are keenly observed and relatively unsentimental. As Mr. 
Springsteen promised, the assignation in the hotel room "doesn't go that
 well," but the lyrics only hint at shame and despair. You hear more 
about what happens in the narrator's pants than about what happens in 
his head.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen sang some songs seated at a piano, and it wasn't the 
best way to hear him; the piano songs were among the low points. One of 
these was a treacly version of "The Wish," a mother-and-son narrative 
that he prefaced with a charming apology: "Singing about your mother is 
risky in my business," he said, though he allowed that a few performers 
(including Tupac Shakur) had done it well.<br>
<br>
All night, the somber songs on "Devils &amp; Dust" inspired Mr. 
Springsteen to add long, witty remarks between songs that verged on 
stand-up comedy. He went on a rant about the controversy over teaching 
evolution: "The president says that the jury's out on evolution," he 
said, then added, "Here in New Jersey, we're counting on it." More than 
once, he mentioned that some relatives were in the audience; if he was 
rattled, it only helped.<br>
<br>
As he proved last year, Mr. Springsteen isn't afraid to risk alienating 
his audience. The night's second song was a radical version of "Reason 
to Believe," arranged as a blues song and sung through a microphone so 
wildly distorted that many fans didn't recognize it until the second 
chorus. And the concert ended the way many concerts on this tour have 
ended, with an incantatory cover of "Dream Baby Dream" by the pioneering
 electronic duo Suicide - hardly a song this crowd knew by heart.<br>
<br>
Watching Mr. Springsteen struggle under the weight of his own decency, 
watching him chronicle characters shuttling between hard times and 
hard-won joy, it's easy to see why so many rock stars avoid decency 
altogether. That commitment to goodness can have a flattening effect, 
turning songs into allegories and singers into figureheads; Mr. 
Springsteen's least convincing songs seem to go on forever as he rasps 
about stock characters nobly struggling to survive.<br>
<br>
But let's return, one last time, to the hotel room where one of Mr. 
Springsteen's more memorable narrators spends two and a half verses 
hearing a price list, daydreaming about an old lover and - finally, 
anticlimactically - getting down to business. There is a lot to love 
about Mr. Springsteen's commitment to decency, which lets him get 
through the naughty bits without smirking, to find whatever it is that 
lies on the other side.<br>
<br>
In "Reno," the encounter ends with a celebration that isn't, and Mr. 
Springsteen sang it the way he sang many of these songs: in a gruff 
whisper that echoed his characters' disappointment. " Here's to the best
 you ever had," the woman says, and then the narrator recalls: "We 
laughed and made a toast/It wasn't the best I ever had/Not even close." 
Mr. Springsteen was still strumming when he delivered that last line, 
but it didn't matter. The crowd promptly obliterated the quiet he had 
asked for, and he didn't complain.</div>

Born to Strum<br>
<br>
By WILL HERMES<br>
Asbury Park, N.J.</strong><br>
<br>
ON a bright, brisk April afternoon in one of America's most famous faded
 seaside resorts, the sycamores are budding and the dogwoods are in 
bloom. New construction near the shore points to the town's long-rumored
 revitalization. Yet rows of boarded-up homes, along with the crumbling 
remains of the old Metropolitan Hotel and the Baronet Theater, suggest 
that any turnaround is still a ways off.<br>
<br>
Over on Ocean Avenue, a patron sits with a lunchtime shot and beer in 
the Wonder Bar, which advertises a dance party tonight with DJ Jersey 
Joe. Down the block is the Stone Pony, the nightclub where Bruce 
Springsteen, the Jersey Shore's world-famous son, made his name. Among 
other acts, its marquee advertises a show by Nils Lofgren, guitarist for
 Mr. Springsteen's longtime collaborators, the E Street Band.<br>
<br>
Across the street, straddling the boardwalk, is the Convention 
Hall-Paramount Theater complex, a majestic structure designed in the 
1920's by Warren &amp; Wetmore, the architects of Grand Central 
Terminal. Inside the Paramount — which opened in 1930 with a show 
featuring the Marx Brothers, and which shows its age — Mr. Springsteen, 
56, is rehearsing new songs with a new band.<br>
<br>
"Do we have an intro on this? No?" Mr. Springsteen yells to the 17 
players surrounding him onstage. "Okay ... one-two-three-four!" The band
 lurches — no other word will do — into "John Henry," the folk standard 
about a heroic hammer-wielding railroad worker that dates to the 19th 
century and has remained a potent American myth.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen lifts one leg, scrunches up his face and hollers into 
his microphone. Behind him the fiddles of Sam Bardfeld and Soozie Tyrell
 conjure Texas swing, while Charles Giordano's accordion adds a 
Cajun-zydeco feel and the brass section (with members of the Miami 
Horns, longtime E Street associates) kick in some Dixieland braying. 
Other band members clap and shout; their boss hammers away on a battered
 acoustic guitar.<br>
<br>
The rehearsal includes versions of other folk standards — the old labor 
song "Pay Me My Money Down," the spirituals "O Mary Don't You Weep" and 
"Eyes on the Prize," the Irish war ballad "Mrs. McGrath" — whose 
political weight is upstaged by their rousing joie de vivre. It also 
features radically revamped versions of Mr. Springsteen's "Johnny 99" 
and "Open All Night" from his 1981 album "Nebraska." The band, which 
includes Mr. Springsteen's wife, Patti Scialfa, and Marc Anthony 
Thompson (who records as Chocolate Genius), makes a huge, glorious 
noise, full of tugging cross-rhythms and wayward notes. Coffeehouse folk
 music it ain't — sports arena folk is more like it.<br>
<br>
The traditional numbers will appear on Mr. Springsteen's new record, "We
 Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions," a collection of songs popularized
 by the venerable folk singer Pete Seeger, to be released April 25. Mr. 
Springsteen and this band begin a European tour in early May, to be 
followed by American dates in May and June. He plans to introduce the 
material at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival on April 30.<br>
<br>
If you hear a groan off in the distance, it may be a portion of Mr. 
Springsteen's fan base greeting the news of his second consecutive 
project forsaking his well-known brand of rock, along with the E Street 
Band. Since his last album with the band, "The Rising," in 2002, he has 
released a mostly acoustic solo album, last year's "Devils &amp; Dust," 
and an expanded reissue of his 1975 classic "Born to Run."<br>
<br>
Since much of the material on "Devils &amp; Dust" was written and 
recorded years ago, and since "The Seeger Sessions" is his first 
all-covers collection, some fans wonder not simply about the future of 
the E Street Band, but also if the songwriter may be running low on 
fuel.<br>
<br>
"Nah, I write all the time," Mr. Springsteen said reassuringly, leaning 
back on a cream-colored couch in one of the Paramount's small, slightly 
grimy dressing rooms after the day's rehearsals were done. "The stuff on
 'Devils &amp; Dust' — I just liked those songs and didn't want to see 
them get lost. I have an E Street Band record that I have a lot of stuff
 written for. I'm just waiting for the right time to do it."<br>
<br>
Sporting a beatnik-style soul patch under his lower lip and with a 
remarkable lack of gray in his hair, Mr. Springsteen looked vigorous and
 pumped from his afternoon's work. He wore his usual uniform of rumpled 
shirt — top buttons undone, sleeves rolled up — jeans, boots, small 
hoops in both ears and macramé bracelets circling his left wrist. 
Holding a large bottle of Fiji water in his lap, he occasionally stared 
off toward some distant point during an animated hourlong conversation, 
searching for a word, recalling old times in the neighborhood or 
offering his ideas about folk music.<br>
<br>
"The Seeger Sessions" came about, he explained, from a clutch of songs 
he recorded in 1997 for a Pete Seeger tribute album titled "Where Have 
All the Flowers Gone," released on the Appleseed label. After his 
"Devils &amp; Dust" tour last year, he intended to take a break and to 
release a follow-up to "Tracks," a 1998 four-disc set of rare odds and 
ends. He sent a bunch of recordings to his longtime manager, Jon Landau,
 and they both agreed there was something special in the first Seeger 
session.<br>
<br>
"Whenever I'd get tired of what I was working on, I'd go back to it," 
the singer said of the session tape, which included "Jesse James," "My 
Oklahoma Home," "Pretty Boy Floyd" and the only song ultimately used for
 the "Flowers" tribute, "We Shall Overcome." "Listening to it was a 
relief, you know? It was just people playing. It sounded like fun."<br>
<br>
The idea for "Tracks Volume 2" was shelved, and seven years after the 
first Seeger session, Mr. Springsteen reconvened the same musicians to 
record again in the same setting: the living room of his farmhouse in 
Rumson, N.J. Microphones were set up, candles were lighted, alcoholic 
beverages were poured. It was quite a crowd. The horn section had to be 
relegated to the hall. (A DVD feature included with "The Seeger 
Sessions" shows the band at work and play; Mr. Springsteen in particular
 seems to have imbibed a bit.)<br>
<br>
"It allowed me to go back to some of the musical eclecticness I enjoyed 
in my early days and just be musical," he said enthusiastically. 
"There's jazz in there. Swing. Sam brings this Eastern European thing; 
Soozie's a totally down-home country sound. 'Jacob's Ladder' has this 
Kansas City-Dixieland horn thing on top of the gospel. There's no 
straight two-and-four, no rock tempos. This band rolls."<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen also spoke about the difficulty of tackling songs that 
have accrued tremendous cultural weight, like the CD's title track, a 
civil rights anthem in the 60's.<br>
<br>
"When the idea came up to do 'We Shall Overcome,' I was like, 'I can't 
do that,' " he said. "Everyone knows that song as an icon. But what was 
it before it became that? So I went back and looked and realized: 'Oh, 
this is a prayer. I can do that. I know how to pray.'<br>
<br>
"The approach to the song is, I start with this very alienated person, 
because that's me," he said, laughing. "That never changes. And the guy 
can barely sing it — he can barely believe it. But as he moves into it, 
and people start singing with him, he finds his place in the song, in 
history, and that alienation eases."<br>
<br>
One thing Mr. Springsteen seemed reluctant to address, except in the 
abstract, was the political side to the material on "The Seeger 
Sessions." Mr. Seeger, who turns 87 next month, is of course a hero of 
the left, a musician, songwriter and song collector-historian who helped
 spur the politically tinged folk music revival of the 50's and 60's. He
 spoke out against the Vietnam War and has remained an activist, notably
 on environmental issues.<br>
<br>
"That's there," Mr. Springsteen said of the political element. "But I 
approached the entire thing musically. I didn't come to it with any 
ideological perspective, or idea of showing this or that. I just took 
the songs that I liked from Pete's records."<br>
<br>
Mr. Seeger, who declined to be interviewed, is currently busy completing
 an expanded edition of his autobiographical songbook "Where Have All 
the Flowers Gone," first published in 1993. But while he was not 
involved in Mr. Springsteen's project, he said he was happy to hear 
about it.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen's own political involvement has occurred in fits and 
starts. He was thrust into the political spotlight in 1984 when Ronald 
Reagan, in his re-election campaign, tried hitching a ride on the 
popularity of Mr. Springsteen's huge hit "Born in the U.S.A." — a 
complex song about America's treatment of Vietnam veterans whose simple 
chorus lent itself to easy jingoism. More recently, he wrote the song 
"American Skin (41 Shots)" about the controversial shooting of Amadou 
Diallo by New York City police officers, and lent his support to John 
Kerry's presidential bid, moves that displeased some fans.<br>
<br>
While Mr. Springsteen claims to have approached the material on "The 
Seeger Sessions" without a political agenda, he acknowledges that 
context can color things, and suggests that ideology is in the ear of 
the beholder. "What makes these songs vital, and catch fire now," he 
said, "is all the connections you're making, in your head, to this 
moment."<br>
<br>
Indeed. "Mrs. McGrath," a mother's lament for her son who lost his legs 
on the battlefield, carries powerful resonance in the era of Cindy 
Sheehan. And one can only imagine how the boisterous Mardi Gras version 
of "Pay Me My Money Down" will go over at the New Orleans Jazz and 
Heritage Festival in front of thousands of locals still awaiting 
government relief in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.<br>
<br>
There were many more questions worth asking Mr. Springsteen. But his 
associates were pounding on the dressing room door. There was plenty of 
work to do before their day was done.<br>
<br>
So, to cut to the chase: Has he been following this season of HBO's New 
Jersey gangster drama, "The Sopranos," in which the guitarist Steve Van 
Zandt — Mr. Springsteen's right-hand man in the E Street Band — plays 
Silvio Dante, right-hand man to the mob boss Tony Soprano?<br>
<br>
"You know, I missed the last two episodes, what with working on all 
this, but someone told me Stevie's been having aspirations to boss-dom,"
 said the artist still known to fans as the Boss, with a grin. "I got to
 see this!"</div>

GROWIN' UP AND ROCKIN' OUT</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
GLORY DAYS Bruce Springsteen in the 1980s. By Dave Marsh. Illustrated. 478 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. $18.95.<br>
<br>
HERE we are, not even through the decade, and Dave Marsh has already 
written a book with the subtitle ''Bruce Springsteen in the 1980s.''<br>
<br>
Springsteen: he's an honorable topic. A man who once exemplified 
intelligent, passionate rock-and-roll - and therefore secured himself a 
position as a medium-sized draw and a resonant cultural figure for those
 who follow rock - Springsteen has blossomed into the sort of icon and 
political symbol Madison Avenue craves and, in his case, exploits. Five 
million people shelled out $100 million to see his last tour in 1985 - 
the biggest in rock history - and he simultaneously pulled in two 
disingenuous requests for political endorsements, from both the Reagan 
and the Mondale sides, and inspired a slew of sound/look-alike 
advertisements.<br>
<br>
Mr. Marsh has taken his subtitle too seriously, though, as if it gave 
him the license to drag us through everything the man did between 1981 
and the release last November of ''Bruce Springsteen and the E Street 
Band Live/1975-1985,'' a marathon five-record set. Author of the 
best-selling 1979 biography of Springsteen, ''Born to Run,'' Mr. Marsh 
takes a couple of different routes to get to ''The Boss.'' Part fan 
deep-breathing (''The cameras loved Bruce outside, too,'' he writes of 
outdoor concerts), part close analysis of the lyrics, part political 
explication, the book is also part daily journal. The end result is a 
hagiography, and a dull one at that. Mr. Marsh's ''Glory Days'' presents
 Springsteen as a torn figure, someone uncomfortable with moving into 
the highest rank of stardom. Early in his career, he shied away from 
performing in big stadiums, finding them too impersonal, and Mr. Marsh 
admires that dedication to his audience. He avoided merchandising 
himself and rarely gave interviews. He bravely released a solo acoustic 
album, ''Nebraska,'' risking his popularity. And importantly, he updated
 the rock-and-roll archetype by becoming an adult and still rocking out.<br>
<br>
But Springsteen changed, and the change forces Mr. Marsh to hustle as an
 apologist. Under the tutelage of his manager, Jon Landau - the book 
could easily have been titled ''The Education of Bruce Springsteen,'' as
 Mr. Landau, a former rock critic for Rolling Stone, feeds him books, 
movies and political thinking -Springsteen begins playing the largest 
venues possible. According to Mr. Marsh, ''He needed the artistic 
challenge the vast spaces of the football fields afforded.'' He starts 
giving interviews to ''Entertainment Tonight'' and People, since ''the 
already wobbly rock press had further deteriorated.'' He allows himself 
to be merchandised: ''Bruce had accepted the need for selling his 
concertgoers some sort of merchandise, noting the demand of his audience
 for even the low-grade junk sold in the streets around his shows by 
't-shirt bootleggers.' '' He tries to cultivate a black audience for his
 work; that he can't obviously damages Springsteen's credibility as the 
great American pop culture figure, and Mr. Marsh spends a solid three 
pages mulling that one over. BUT the most amazing thing about <br>
<br>
Springsteen's later career - and Mr. Marsh sees this and rightly admires
 him for it - is his ability to maintain his identity and to keep his 
extraordinary communication with the audience. Mr. Marsh likes the 
newfound success for another reason: Springsteen's populist stance 
reaches more people, fitting the myth of the homespun hero. He rakes in 
endorsements from George Will to Bill Bradley, making me figure that 
perhaps his message wasn't as pointed and efficacious as it might be.<br>
<br>
The book sells itself as an inside look at Springsteen, and in a sense 
it is. Jon Landau is a good friend of Dave Marsh and a business 
associate of Mr. Marsh's wife. This gives Mr. Marsh - who's up front 
about all of this - an insider's perspective, but it leaves me wondering
 about what I'm reading. Fame is a dance with the devil in the record 
industry, and it can make people - even as good a soul as Springsteen - 
become contorted. Mr. Marsh's whitewashing is tedious; the connection 
makes it suspect as well.<br>
<br>
A less sanitized version of Springsteen's trek may not be written for a 
few years. By then the story might not make any difference - in which 
case Mr. Marsh, by laying out a cardboard, mythologized version of 
Springsteen, has done a disservice not only to us, but to Springsteen as
 well.</div>

SOLD-OUT SPRINGSTEEN CONCERT WILL OPEN JERSEY ARENA JULY 2</strong><br>
<br>
By ALFONSO A. NARVAEZ, Special to the New York Times<br>
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., June 23— Although the lockers and dressing rooms 
will not be finished, the building's sound system will not be functional
 and painters and technicians will still have hundreds of jobs left, the
 20,000-seat Brendan Byrne Arena at the Meadowlands Sports Complex will 
be packed with rock-music fans in less than two weeks.<br>
<br>
On July 2, the concrete-and-steel arena four miles west of the Lincoln 
Tunnel will be opened with the first of six Bruce Springsteen concerts 
that were sold out 36 hours after they were announced.<br>
<br>
''The response was tremendous,'' said Loris F. Smith, general manager of
 Giants Stadium and the new arena, which dominate the 730-acre Sports 
Complex site. ''We got 50,000 pieces of mail the day after the radio 
spots were played. The next day we had to turn back another 50,000 
pieces of mail at the Post Office.''<br>
<br>
Work Behind the Scenes<br>
<br>
The arena - 110 feet high, 408 feet wide and 475 feet long - will also 
be used for sporting events and exhibitions and as a convention center. 
The use of 428-foot steel roof trusses provides audiences with an 
unobstructed view<br>
<br>
''The public will not be aware that there is still work going on,'' Mr. 
Smith said, noting that the unfinished work would be in behindthe-scenes
 areas such as exhibition areas and locker rooms.<br>
<br>
Construction began in December 1979 and is still going on despite a $2.5
 million payment to Terminal Construction Corporation, the contractors, 
for overtime work aimed at meeting a December 1980 deadline. Design 
modifications and other factors have raised the cost from an estimated 
$55.1 million in 1979, when the first bonds were sold, to almost $85 
million, with some elements, such as an electronic scoreboard and a 
250-seat restaurant, still to be added.<br>
<br>
The new arena here is expected to have some initial impact on Madison 
Square Garden, but officials of the New York City arena anticipate no 
long-term competitive effects. Michael Burke, the Garden's president, 
said many events would be booked into both facilities. 'The Garden Is 
the Gareen'<br>
<br>
''I don't see attendance dropping off at the Garden,'' he said. ''This 
is a huge area and we have an enormous public on which to draw. The 
arena may have an initial competitive advantage because it is brand-new 
and because of its pricing policy.<br>
<br>
''They will rent the arena to people for less than what our rate card 
is, but the Garden is the Garden is the Garden. No amount of bricks and 
mortar can replace the intangible magic that comes from the name.''<br>
<br>
Mr. Burke said that while the Garden had lost a track meet to the new 
arena because there was a conflict in scheduling dates. ''Disney's World
 on Ice,'' for example, will open at the Byrne Arena and then go to the 
Garden, he said.<br>
<br>
Officials said that the decision to name the arena after Governor Byrne 
was introduced in an executive session of the sports authority last fall
 and approved by unanimous vote at a public session in November. The 
Governor, they added, had nothing to do with the decision.<br>
<br>
''The Governor had no say about it,'' said a spokesman for Mr. Byrne, 
who is in the Soviet Union on a trade mission with officials of the Port
 Authority of New York and New Jersey. ''He can't name the arena and he 
can't unname it - it was solely a function of the sports authority.''<br>
<br>
The Springsteen concerts will take place before the arena's official 
dedication at noon July 14, a few hours before ''Disney's World on Ice''
 moves in for a two-week, 25-performance stand. The ice show will be 
followed by Hambletonian Week early in August, with the Meadowlands 
Grand Prix horse competitions and a three-day sale of standardbred 
yearlings.<br>
<br>
''We feel that week will tie the three facilities together and really 
tell the story of what this complex is all about,'' said Robert E. 
Mulcahy 3d, chairman of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, 
which oversees the operations of the stadium, the race track and the 
arena. Soccer, Sulkies and Singing<br>
<br>
The Cosmos of the North American Soccer League will play Jacksonville, 
Fla., at Giants Stadium on Aug. 2, he said, and later that evening, the 
$1.7 million Woodrow Wilson Pace for 2-year-old pacers - the ''richest 
race in the world'' - will be staged at the Meadowlands track. Later in 
the week, the $800,000 Hambletonian, one of harness racing's most famous
 events, will held at the track and a concert by John Denver will be 
presented in the arena.<br>
<br>
The New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association, who will 
test the floorboards in their new home in October, had been scheduled to
 play some games in the arena last season, but construction delays 
forced them to use the Rutgers gymnasium in Piscataway. The authority 
was required by its contract to lend the team's owners, Meadowlands 
Basketball Associates, $2.05 million - $50,000 for each of last season's
 41 home games that could not be played at the arena - at 12 percent, 
with only interest payments due in the first year.<br>
<br>
Officials estimate that 225 dates will be booked during the arena's 
first year of operation. But although the arena can serve as the home 
rink for a major-league hockey franchise, no team will be using it as a 
home arena for the coming season. Last Friday, arena officials announced
 that the Major Indoor Soccer League had signed a five-year lease for a 
team yet to be named, and today the Cosmos announced the signing of a 
10-year lease on the arena for the team's indoor schedule.<br>
<br>
When work on the arena is finished in a few months, Mr. Mulcahy said, 
the Sports and Exposition Authority will study the operation of the 
three main centers before going ahead with any further major 
construction.<br>
<br>
''We want to make sure that we can move the people into the site and 
within the site before we look at anything else,'' he said. ''Once we 
know everything is functioning as it should, we will sit down and take a
 look at where we are going from here.''</div>

First the good news: 20 minutes of Springsteen. The bad news is a 
further 80 minutes of concert and behind-the-scenes footage which, 
unless you're a fan of the soft rock icons of the late '60s, looks like a
 catalogue of aged hippies reliving their former glory. Filmed during 
five concerts performed for free and organised by Musicians United for 
Safe Energy (MUSE), it's a pity that the movie builds so obviously 
towards Springsteen's appearance, defusing the very real political 
message of the MUSE team (Nuclear Energy is BAD for you) and turning 
Springsteen into nothing more than a crowd-puller. His performance is 
astonishing , joyous and revelatory.  (Haskell Wexler directed the

<br>
BY: JEFF MIERS<br>
<br>
Buffalo News <br>
<br>
18 November 2012</strong><br>
<br>
If you’ve ever witnessed an extended Bruce Springsteen guitar solo in 
concert and realized it was as much exorcism as celebration; if you’ve 
been flabbergasted by folks who treat a subdued, introspective 
in-concert rendering of “Mansion On the Hill” as an opportunity to talk 
loudly or head to the refreshment stand for yet another beer; if you 
realize that the late career, Bush-era masterpiece “Magic” is as good an
 album as “Born to Run,” and a better one than “Born in the U.S.A.”; if 
you heard, from the beginning, the sense of moral outrage and 
humanitarian disgust at the heart of the oft-misinterpreted “anthem” 
that is the song “Born in the U.S.A.,” and wondered how anyone hearing 
it could miss the point – then Peter Ames Carlin’s “Bruce” is for you.<br>
<br>
There have been abundant biographies, philosophical exegeses, fan 
tributes, socioeconomic discourses and cultural theses penned in the 
name of Springsteen. Invariably, these have been, at least, worth 
reading. Occasionally, they have come across as absolutely essential – 
Dave Marsh’s “Born To Run” and “Glory Days” sitting at the top of this 
short list. But if ever again a disbeliever confronts me with the 
standard “Just what exactly is the deal with this Springsteen character 
you’re always babbling on about like a religious zealot?” it will be 
Carlin’s “Bruce” that I’ll thrust forward by way of response.<br>
<br>
Why? It’s simple. Carlin is the biographer who has gone the deepest into
 Springsteen’s character. He’s the only one to cogently posit a 
desperate need to claw one’s way out of the darkness and toward 
something resembling the light as the central motivating factor in 
Springsteen’s career arc.<br>
<br>
Carlin, more than any other writer, offers us a Springsteen for whom 
making music is an act of existential self-affirmation. In the process, 
he rescues Springsteen from the unfortunate popular conception that he’s
 some sort of simpleton who writes proletarian anthems and bar-room 
rockers for white people to drink beer to. Perhaps to some portion of 
his audience, that’s all Springsteen is. But the development of the 
music over the years, and the way the biographical data fills in around 
and complements that music, suggests a much more fleshed-out portrait. 
Carlin’s Springsteen is an infinitely more complex man and musician, a 
figure wrestling with demons planted during childhood, and haunted, even
 in the midst of massive success, by, as he puts it himself in “The 
Promise,” “the broken spirits of all the other ones who lost.”<br>
<br>
Carlin greatly benefited from first-person access here – not just to 
Springsteen’s oldest friends, bandmates, ex-lovers and former business 
partners, but to the man himself, who agreed to be interviewed as long 
as the author conceded to a single caveat – that he refrain from making 
Springsteen appear as some sort of saint. Carlin held up his end of the 
agreement. Though he’s clearly a fan, the author does not shy away from 
the ugly underneath, and presents many anecdotes in which Springsteen 
emerges in less than heroic form.<br>
<br>
More than any previous Springsteen biographer, Carlin is hip to the 
aspect of Faulknerian tragedy at the heart of Springsteen’s art and 
family history alike. The book begins with a recounting of the death of 
Virginia Springsteen – sister of Bruce’s father, Douglas – who was 
struck and killed by a truck at the age of 5. Her death left a desolate 
emptiness in the core of the family before Bruce even entered it. 
Douglas Springsteen never seemed to get over the loss. Bruce’s 
grandparents didn’t either, and the fact that the young boy spent much 
of his childhood living with those grandparents cast a deep pall over 
his experience. His grandparents doted on him, but also placed no 
restrictions on him, offered little in the way of guidance, and emerged 
from their fog of grief only to suggest that there was little reason for
 young Bruce to even bother attending school, when he was fully capable 
of entering the work force as his father had done immediately after 
completing ninth grade.<br>
<br>
Springsteen maintained a nourishing relationship with his mother Adele, 
but his father appears as a Kafka-esque presence in “Bruce,” an 
unsmiling and stoic figure who worked various factory jobs by day and 
spent his nights seated at the kitchen table in the dark, chain-smoking,
 drinking beer and staring into the middle distance – “with the eyes of 
one who hates for just being born,” to borrow a Springsteen lyric. His 
son’s obsession with music did not assuage Douglas Springsteen’s misery;
 by the time Bruce was a long-haired ’60s teenager regularly gigging 
around Freehold, N.J., the two were at loggerheads.<br>
<br>
Many of Springsteen’s strongest songs detail the father/son dichotomy in
 the family home. The postcard-from-hell that is “Adam Raised A Cain” 
does so perhaps most viscerally: “Daddy worked his whole life for 
nuthin’ but the pain/Now he walks these empty rooms lookin’ for 
something to blame/But you inherit the sins, and you inherit the 
flames/Adam raised a Cain,” the singer howls in imagery clearly gleaned 
from his own unpleasant experience in Catholic schooling. It’s easy to 
see in Carlin’s portrait that, for Springsteen, music was much more than
 an opportunity to meet girls and escape a dire economic reality – it 
was the only means available to him to transcend the darkness and death 
he felt surrounding him at home.<br>
<br>
All wasn’t misery, of course. Springsteen attempted to be a happy kid, 
tried to fit in, played baseball, made an effort to turn off his brain 
and sit still in class.<br>
<br>
“But no matter how sweet the boyhood moments,” Carlin writes, “Bruce 
still had his old man’s fragile psyche to deal with.” “You couldn’t 
access him, you couldn’t get to him, period,” says Bruce, recalling his 
many attempts to talk to his father. “You’d get 40 seconds in, and you 
know that thing that happens when it’s not happening? That would 
happen.” “When dinner was over and the dishes were done, the kitchen 
became Doug’s solitary kingdom. With the lights out and the table 
holding only a can of beer, a pack of cigarettes, a lighter and an 
ashtray, Doug passed the hours alone in the darkness.”<br>
<br>
Of course, Carlin’s “Bruce” doesn’t concern itself only with the 
dysfunctional father-son relationship – the book moves with agility and 
insight through its subject’s formative musical years, his evolution 
into an in-demand virtuoso lead guitarist, bandleader, songwriter and 
Jersey shore “bum” living only for the next gig, and the one after that.
 The early years, the formation of a partnership with manager Mike 
Appel, the hard work that finally yielded an audition for Columbia’s 
legendary John Hammond, the years of tireless road work and faltering 
commercial success that made the making of “Born to Run” into a 
desperate last stand with the threat of being dropped from his record 
label dangling over Springsteen’s head – all get their due.<br>
<br>
The bulk of “Bruce” thoroughly covers the significant milestones in 
Springsteen’s transition from revered cult figure into stadium-filling 
superstar, among them the falling out with Appel; the lawsuit launched 
by Springsteen to retain the rights to his music, and the attendant 
existential crisis that led to the masterpiece “Darkness on the Edge of 
Town”; the creation of “The River,” and following it, a success that 
finally yielded financial security; the dichotomy between the stark 
“Nebraska” and its more polished counterpart, the massively successful 
“Born in the U.S.A”; and each tour and album cycle that followed. Carlin
 does an excellent job of presenting Springsteen’s personal evolution 
alongside his growth as musician, songwriter and public figure.<br>
<br>
Yet, at the heart of the story remains the image of Douglas Springsteen 
seated at his kitchen table in the dark, staring out the window in 
search of God knows what. It’s his father, and so many like him, that 
Springsteen struggled so desperately to escape, and then spent the rest 
of his career writing about.<br>
<br>
The image of that man whose dreams have been crushed beyond recognition 
informs Springsteen’s political consciousness, his need to speak for 
those who’ve been denied the right to speak. As Carlin makes clear, the 
failure to communicate with his father pushed Springsteen to seek 
communication on a mass level, and ultimately, to reconcile the loner in
 himself with the need for community, connection, family, civic 
involvement. With connection came commitment – to the ideals the music 
always represented for him; to his band mates; to consistent charity 
work; to marathon concert rituals even as a 63- year-old man; to 
bountiful campaign stops in key states supporting Barack Obama in 2008 
and 2012.<br>
<br>
Carlin’s “Bruce” is a complex and often troubling tale, but ultimately, 
it’s a story of triumph over adversity, of a poor kid from New Jersey 
whose ability to rise above family tragedy, isolation, alienation and 
lingering despair in order to become a voice “for all the other ones who
 lost.”</div>
