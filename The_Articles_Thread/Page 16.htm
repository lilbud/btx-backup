				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">July 31 / Olympic Stadium / Helsinki, FINLAND</strong><br>
<br>
An Olympic feat tonight at Helsinki's Olympic Stadium, as Bruce and the E
 Street Band make the myth real, finally doing what the legends say 
they've done for years: play a four-hour show. Four hours and five 
minutes, actually, Springsteen's longest show to date by a fair margin —
 and that's not even counting a special acoustic set before the main 
event. Desiree Koh reports.<br>
<br>
When Bruce launched into "Light of Day," a sign request, and "100 
miles... 200 miles... 300 miles...," I knew exactly what he meant — I 
had traveled 5,000 of them from Singapore to Scandinavia to follow him 
and the band across the region and close Europe out. I knew I was on the
 right train with that heartfelt show in Oslo, and I could feel the 
expectations build as we traveled east, particularly after Gothenburg's 
groundbreaking (if not stadium-breaking) second show. Sure, there was no
 media blitz, page ones, and special sections as in Norway and Sweden, 
but as 50,000 of us made our way into Helsinki's Olympic Stadium, the 
same questions roamed through everyone’s minds: will they break four 
hours? Can what many now considered the best show of the tour so far — 
or of the decade — be topped?<br>
<br>
The answer is yes, and no, which is the beauty of these legendary tours:
 you never get what you anticipate, and I mean that in a good way. But 
first, an opening act — a solo troubadour named Bruce Springsteen took 
the stage at 6:15pm with a guitar (and a harmonica that never worked out
 and was discarded quickly). The stadium was about one-third full at 
this point, and Bruce showed why patience (and faith) would be rewarded,
 playing an acoustic five-song set for "the regulars," which included 
three tour premieres: "I'll Work For Your Love," "Leap of Faith," and 
"Blinded By the Light." Throughout, he acknowledged the faces he 
recognized and the love of his more hard-core fans — “You're all broke 
and homeless, and it's my fault!" After the 30-minute warm-up — during 
which he sounded like he was fighting a cold (for the rest of the 
evening, he coughed, blew his nose and had tissue paper on hand several 
times) — he spent another ten shaking hands, chatting, and making some 
ladies very happy with kisses on the cheek. It was tough to doubt that 
that night's show would be anything but less than phenomenal and 
stratospherically special when he left the stage.<br>
<br>
The full band came out at 7:54pm and powered right into "Rockin' All 
Over the World," the first of five — count them all! — tour premieres 
for this last show on the continent. Without skipping a beat for the 
next eight songs, the band surged from song to song, including an epic 
"Prove It All Night" with the 1978 intro during which Bruce soloed 
ferociously with the usual classy support from the Professor's keys.<br>
<br>
While songs such as "Because the Night" soared with that Lofgren 
slashing guitar aria you never tire of, and "Darlington County" was that
 firecracker of a hootenanny you can't get enough of, "Loose Ends" and 
"Be True" were refreshing change-ups, and the "My City of Ruins" roll 
call got a few more touching ruminations than usual: "I’m going to stand
 right here where time can't get to me."<br>
<br>
Springsteen had more fun with sign requests than at the other Nordic 
shows, joking that Americans knew nothing about public transportation 
before calling for "Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?" and vaguely 
toying with the idea of "Secret Garden" before going with "Back in Your 
Arms" instead. The soulful rendition drove straight to that part of the 
heart where the sun doesn't usually reach, verses interspersed with 
monologues about hopes, dreams, and that special someone, but ending on 
that high note that you often get to when Bruce is in the driver's seat.<br>
<br>
When the tour premiere of "Detroit Medley" made its grand appearance 
like a knee slide across the stage after "Born to Run," followed by 
"Glory Days," you started looking at your watch like soccer fans at a 
match and, sure as the ticking of the clock on the wall, you did the 
math and knew the end wasn’t near. After "Tenth Avenue Freeze-out," 
Bruce pointed out emphatically that "The Finns aren't finished!" and 
happily obliged a sign request for the tour premiere of the Steve-penned
 "I Don't Want to Go Home," nudging his friend repeatedly to take the 
lead and mic on a stripped-down, duet rendition. Although there were 
snags in the audience participation portion of "Higher and Higher," the 
final tour premiere (Bruce ended up calling for "singers, help me out!" 
to straighten the parts out), there was no denying that everyone knew 
what to do during "Twist and Shout." At the 
three-hour-and-fifty-eight-minute mark, a crew member ran out to tell 
Bruce what was happening, and he seemed surprised — of course, that only
 motivated him to take this favorite closer where it's never been 
before. For one, Jon Landau was helping out on guitar — for nearly 10 
minutes, he was living in the future of rock 'n' roll.<br>
<br>
I am a marathon runner and half-Ironman finisher, but Bruce’s feat of 
endurance Tuesday night never once flagged in passion, dedication, and 
undying commitment to send everyone home delirious with rock 'n' roll 
salvation in their spirits. It was all that Helsinki — no, Heavensinki —
 would allow.<br>

your 1st post a Table of Contents listing each article's title, source, 
date &amp; other details so, peeps could easily see what you loaded

also made it easier to locate desired reads. <br>
<br>
The Creem Oct. '78 interview by Robert Duncan should be included - It is Essential!<br>
<br>
I don't know if it is or not &amp; I'm not wading thru all that's there

Why I still love Bruce Springsteen.<br>
<br>
By Stephen Metcalf|Monday, May 2, 2005<br>
<br>
In his early live shows, Bruce Springsteen had a habit of rattling off, 
while the band vamped softly in the background, some thoroughly 
implausible story from his youth. This he punctuated with a shy, 
wheezing laugh that let you know he didn't for a second buy into his own
 bullshit. Back then, in the early 1970s, Bruce was still a regional 
act, touring the dive bars and dive colleges of the Atlantic coast, 
playing any venue that would have him. As a matter of routine, a 
Springsteen show would kick off with audience members throwing gifts 
onto the stage. Not bras and panties, mind you, but gifts—something 
thoughtful, not too expensive. Bruce was one of their own, after all, a 
scrawny little dirtbag from the shore, a minor celebrity of what the 
great George Trow once called "the disappearing middle distance." By 
1978, and the release of Darkness on the Edge of Town, the endearing 
Jersey wharf rat in Springsteen had been refined away. In its place was a
 majestic American simpleton with a generic heartland twang, obsessed 
with cars, Mary, the Man, and the bitterness between fathers and sons. 
Springsteen has been augmenting and refining that persona for so long 
now that it's hard to recall its status, not only as an invention, but 
an invention whose origin wasn't even Bruce Springsteen. For all the 
po-faced mythic resonance that now accompanies Bruce's every move, we 
can thank Jon Landau, the ex-Rolling Stone critic who, after catching a 
typically seismic Springsteen set in 1974, famously wrote, "I saw rock 
and roll future, and its name is Bruce Springsteen."<br>
<br>
Well, Bruce Springsteen was Jon Landau's future. Over the next couple of
 years, Landau insinuated himself into Bruce's artistic life and 
consciousness (while remaining on the Rolling Stone masthead) until he 
became Springsteen's producer, manager, and full-service Svengali. 
Unlike the down-on-their-luck Springsteens of Freehold, N.J., Landau 
hailed from the well-appointed suburbs of Boston and had earned an 
honors degree in history from Brandeis. He filled his new protégé's head
 with an American Studies syllabus heavy on John Ford, Steinbeck, and 
Flannery O'Connor. At the same time that he intellectualized Bruce, he 
anti-intellectualized him. Rock music was transcendent, Landau believed,
 because it was primitive, not because it could be avant-garde. The 
White Album and Hendrix and the Velvet Underground had robbed rock of 
its power, which lay buried in the pre-Beatles era with Del Shannon and 
the Ronettes. Bruce's musical vocabulary accordingly shrank. By Darkness
 on the Edge of Town, gone were the West Side Story-esque jazz suites of
 The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle. In their place were 
tight, guitar-driven intro-verse-chorus-verse-bridge-chorus songs. 
Springsteen's image similarly transformed. On the cover of Darkness, he 
looks strangely like the sallower cousin of Pacino's Sonny Wortzik, the 
already quite sallow anti-hero of Dog Day Afternoon. The message was 
clear: Springsteen himself was one of the unbeautiful losers, flitting 
along the ghostly fringes of suburban respectability.<br>
<br>
Thirty years later, and largely thanks to Landau, Springsteen is no 
longer a musician. He's a belief system. And, like any belief system 
worth its salt, he brooks no in-between. You're either in or you're out.
 This has solidified Bruce's standing with his base, for whom he remains
 a god of total rock authenticity. But it's killed him with everyone 
else. To a legion of devout nonbelievers—they're not saying Bruuuce, 
they're booing—Bruce is more a phenomenon akin to Dianetics or 
Tinkerbell than "the new Dylan," as the Columbia Records promotions 
machine once hyped him. And so we've reached a strange juncture. About 
America's last rock star, it's either Pentecostal enthusiasm or total 
disdain.<br>
<br>
To walk back from this impasse, we need to see Springsteen's persona for
 what it really is: Jon Landau's middle-class fantasy of white, 
working-class authenticity. Does it derogate Springsteen to claim that 
he is, in essence, a white minstrel act? Not at all. Only by peeling 
back all the layers of awful heartland authenticity and rediscovering 
the old Jersey bullshitter underneath can we begin to grasp the actual 
charms of the man and his music. A glimpse of this old bullshitter was 
recently on display when Springsteen inducted U2 into the Rock 'n' Roll 
Hall of Fame on March 14. Springsteen had recently caught the new iPod 
commercial featuring the Irish rockers. "Now personally, I live an 
insanely expensive lifestyle that my wife barely tolerates," the old 
BSer confided to the audience of industry heavyweights, adding,<br>
Now, I burn money, and that calls for huge amounts of cash flow. But, I 
also have a ludicrous image of myself that keeps me from truly cashing 
in. You can see my problem. Woe is me. So the next morning, I call up 
Jon Landau … and I say, "Did you see that iPod thing?" and he says, 
"Yes." And he says, "And I hear they didn't take any money." And I said,
 "They didn't take any money?" and he says, "No." I said, "Smart, wily 
Irish guys. Anybody—anybody—can do an ad and take the money. But to do 
the ad and not take the money … that's smart. That's wily." I say, "Jon,
 I want you to call up Bill Gates or whoever is behind this thing and 
float this: a red, white and blue iPod signed by Bruce 'The Boss' 
Springsteen. Now remember, no matter how much money he offers, don't 
take it!"<br>
Every now and again, the majestic simpleton breaks character, and winks;
 and about as often, he works his way back to subtlety and a human scale
 and cuts a pretty great song or album. From the post-Landau period, the
 harrowing masterpiece Nebraska is the only record you can push on the 
nonbelievers, followed by the grossly underrated Tunnel of Love. The 
Oscar-winning "Streets of Philadelphia," an account of a man with AIDS 
slowly fading into his own living ghost, is the equal of any song he's 
written. In 1995 Springsteen produced The Ghost of Tom Joad, the 
culmination of a 15-year obsession with Woody Guthrie, whose biography 
he had been handed the night after Reagan defeated Carter, in 1980. The 
album is stronger than its popular reception might lead one to believe. 
"Across the Border" and "Galveston Bay" are lovely and understated and 
bring home the fact that Springsteen—a man who wrote monster hits for 
acts as diverse as Manfred Mann, the Pointer Sisters, and Patti 
Smith—remains a skilled melodist. Nonetheless, the record is a little 
distant in its sympathies, as if Springsteen had thumbed through back 
issues of The Utne Reader before sitting down to compose.<br>
His new album, Devils &amp; Dust, is a sequel to The Ghost of Tom Joad. 
It's mostly acoustic and intimate in scale; but Springsteen appears to 
have taken criticism of Tom Joad to heart, and Devils &amp; Dust is 
warmer, and in patches, fully up-tempo. It's hard to describe how good 
the good songs are. The title song is classic Springsteen—"a dirty 
wind's blowing," and a young soldier may "kill the things he loves" to 
survive. And on "Black Cowboys," Springsteen unites a visionary 
concision of detail with long lines in a way that channels William 
Blake:<br>
Come the fall the rain flooded these homes, here in Ezekiel's valley of 
dry bones, it fell hard and dark to the ground. It fell without a sound.
 Lynette took up with a man whose business was the boulevard, whose 
smile was fixed in a face that was never off guard.<br>
Though initially signed as a folkie, Springsteen has never been much of a
 technician on the acoustic guitar, compared to, say, the infinitely 
nimble Richard Thompson. But on Devils &amp; Dust there's a new comfort 
with the instrument; and he decorates many of the songs with a lovely, 
understated filigree. Ah, but how hard the lapses in taste! The strings 
and vocal choruses used to punch up the sound are—what other word is 
there?—corny. Next to, say, Iron and Wine, Devils &amp; Dust too often 
sounds like a chain store selling faux Americana bric-a-brac. One always
 suspects with Springsteen that, in addition to a blonde Telecaster and 
"the Big Man," a focus group lies close at hand. The album is 
suspiciously tuned in to two recent trends, the exploding population of 
the Arizona and New Mexico exurbs; and the growing religiosity of the 
country as a whole. Devils &amp; Dust is very South by Southwest—Mary is
 now Maria, there's a lot of mesquite and scrub pine, and one song even 
comes with a handy key to its regional terminology (Mustaneros: 
Mustangers; Pradera: Prairie; Riata: Rope). It's also crammed with 
Biblical imagery, from a modern re-telling of the story of Leah to 
Christ's final solacing of his mother. The first is a silly throwaway; 
the second is a fetching, Dylan-inspired hymn that ends with the teasing
 rumination, "Well Jesus kissed his mother's hands/ Whispered, 'Mother, 
still your tears,/ For remember the soul of the universe/ Willed a world
 and it appeared.' "<br>
The high watermark for Springsteen commercially, of course, was 1984, 
when "Born in the USA" somehow caught both the feelings of social 
dislocation and the euphoric jingoism of the Reagan era. Landau's mythic
 creation, the blue-collar, rock 'n' roll naif, has never held such 
broad appeal since. In recent years, Springsteen has settled into a 
pattern of selling a couple million albums (Born in the USA sold 15 
million) to the Bruce die-hards. A clue to who these people are can be 
found in Springsteen's evolving persona, which is no longer as 
structured around his own working-class roots. On a short DV film on the
 CD's flip side, Springsteen says he tries to "disappear" into the 
voices of the migrant workers and ghetto prisoners whose stories make up
 Devils &amp; Dust: "What would they do, what wouldn't they do, how 
would they behave in this circumstance, the rhythm of their speech, 
that's sort of where the music comes in." With Landau nowhere in 
evidence (he's thanked, but excluded from the album's formal credits), 
it is up to Springsteen alone to impersonate the voices of the 
dispossessed. The pupil has finally surpassed the master.<br>
Nonetheless, here I am, starting to hum its tunes, growing a little 
devil's patch, hitting the gym, and adding a distant heartland twang to 
my speech. (My wife, meanwhile, curls up on the sofa in shame.) You old 
bullshitter, you got me again.</div>

				<div class="content">ESSAY; Springsteen's Brilliant Disguise<br>
By JOE QUEENAN<br>
Published: June 20, 2004<br>
<br>
New York Times<br>
<br>
ON his dyspeptic 1983 album, ''Trouble in Paradise,'' Randy Newman 
recorded a song in which Bruce Springsteen confesses that he is tired of
 being ''the Boss.'' So he asks Mr. Newman, that sardonic 
singer-songwriter, if he would briefly fill in as America's most beloved
 working-class hero. This is one of the few instances in pop-cultural 
history where anyone dared to poke fun at the sanctified Mr. 
Springsteen, where anyone had the nerve to take the mickey out of the 
Boss and his studiously manicured image as the poet of the proles.<br>
<br>
Recording ''My Life Is Good'' was the kind of jaundiced, disrespectful 
gesture that has long made Mr. Newman an outcast at life's rich feast. 
Making fun of the Boss was like snickering during a Holy Communion 
service, like plopping down on a whoopee cushion during a State of the 
Union address. Was Mr. Newman not aware that ridiculing Bruce Almighty, 
at least in the minds of white baby boomers, was like sneering at Mom, 
apple pie and the American flag? Was Mr. Newman not aware that lines 
like ''At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines'' 
rivaled T.S. Eliot and William Carlos Williams for symbolic nuance and 
verbal ingenuity? Was Mr. Newman not aware that yea, verily, Mr. 
Springsteen sat at the right hand of the Father? What was wrong with 
this guy?<br>
<br>
These thoughts are occasioned by ''Springsteen: Troubadour of the 
Highway,'' a very serious, very portentous, generally yuck-free 
exhibition that pays homage to New Jersey's beloved poet laureate. The 
traveling exhibit is now at the Newark Museum through Aug. 29, and 
includes videos, memorabilia and more than 70 photographs by artists as 
varied as Annie Leibovitz, Frank Stefanko and David Rose; 41 of the 
photos are by Mr. Springsteen's kid sister Pamela.<br>
<br>
Promotional materials on the museum's Web site (<a href="http://www.newarkmuseum.org/" class="postlink">www.newarkmuseum.org</a>)
 say the show ''explores Springsteen's use of cars and highways as 
motifs in his music and in related visual imagery'' in much the same way
 that Raphael once used religious iconography in his work. The publicity
 materials continue: ''From his songs 'Thunder Road' to 'The Ghost of 
Tom Joad,' and at every point along the way, Bruce Springsteen has 
employed images of cars and the highway as central features of his 
music. His restless characters are on the move, sometimes on the hustle 
and often on the run. Speeding off the edge of town, down the Jersey 
Turnpike, or across the desert, their physical movement matches their 
psychic and spiritual searches. His images work as metaphors for 
Springsteen's meditations on both the promise and disappointments of 
America.''<br>
<br>
Oddly, the museum does not mention that Mr. Springsteen's father was a 
bus driver, which may explain the singer's metaphorical obsession with 
vehicles that can attain prodigious speeds without the encumbrance of 
making frequent stops, as this would impede his characters' psychic and 
spiritual searches. Nor does it mention that you kind of need a car to 
get around in suburban New Jersey, as public transportation is at a 
premium, further illuminating the Boss's fixation on automobiles. But 
that is the subject for another show, perhaps one with even more photos 
by his sister.<br>
<br>
Many of the exhibit's photographs are widely known, like ''Asbury Park''
 by Ms. Leibovitz and ''Corvette, Winter'' by Mr. Stefanko. But Ms. 
Springsteen's lesser-known images are a byproduct of the 1995 release of
 ''The Ghost of Tom Joad.'' This was the lugubrious, commercially 
unsuccessful record inspired by Steinbeck's ''Grapes of Wrath''; when 
Mr. Springsteen sings material from this album in concert, the audience 
generally nods off or takes a bathroom break.<br>
<br>
This is where it might be advisable to bring Randy Newman back into the 
conversation. As a super-hunky (check out those forearms) Mr. 
Springsteen vogues down the ribbon of highway in his sister's photos, it
 is difficult for those of a Newmanian frame of mind to suppress a 
chuckle. Thirty years after he attained immense fame and fortune and 
bade farewell to down-at-the-heels Freehold forever, Mr. Springsteen is 
still working his Everydude act for all it is worth. The working-class 
hero who dumped the band that helped make him famous, moved to the West 
Coast and married a model, and then took up residence in tony Rumson, 
where he became bosom buddies with the late risk arbitrageur John A. 
Mulheren, who was once arrested on suspicion of plotting to kill Ivan 
Boesky, is still getting gussied up as a forlorn migrant worker who 
dreams of one day living on that mansion on the hill. This is 
inadvisable. As John Steinbeck might put it: ''Bruce: I knew Tom Joad. I
 created Tom Joad. And, Bruce, you are no Tom Joad. Tom Joad didn't pump
 iron with risk arbitrageurs.''<br>
<br>
Inadvertently, ''Troubadour of the Highway'' captures the cognitive 
dissonance that characterizes the Springsteen experience. ''Born in the 
U.S.A.,'' one of the Boss's catchiest anthems, is actually an 
anti-American diatribe deploring this nation's ill-starred endeavor in 
Southeast Asia. But nobody pays attention to the lyrics; even 
Republicans love it. ''My Hometown'' laments the closing of factories, 
even though risk arbitrageurs like John Mulheren are precisely the kinds
 of people who help get factories closed. A typical Springsteen concert 
contains several paeans to working stiffs, but the audience for these 
songs is largely affluent baby boomers and party-animal frat boys. 
Unlike Pete Seeger and Billy Bragg, who sing left-wing songs for a 
left-wing audience, Mr. Springsteen sings quasi-left-wing songs for an 
audience that really only came to hear ''Rosalita.'' This is not an 
indictment; it is a fact.<br>
<br>
This is not to accuse Mr. Springsteen of being a fake, but merely to 
indicate that popular culture thrives on some sort of healthy hypocrisy.
 It is a safety valve of sorts that lets the prosperous middle class 
walk on the wild side. How many people shelling out $57 to see Mr. 
Springsteen at the Meadowlands last year have ever been anywhere near 
the Badlands? How many teenagers from Totowa have ever been within 15 
miles of the darkness at the edge of town? At a certain point, most 
adults -- and all suburbanites -- realize that they cannot live rock 'n'
 roll lives, so they accept the nearest substitute: a rock 'n' roll 
attitude. They live tough, edgy lives, vicariously, through singers who 
live tough, edgy lives, vicariously. Let's face it: Who would listen to a
 bunch of songs about people torn between buying a Lexus and a Saab?<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen's music, strangely, has spawned precious few imitators 
and almost no progeny. It's the musical equivalent of a Ronald Reagan 
stump speech: peppy, assertive, highly anecdotal, occasionally 
censorious, fiercely obvious. Whatever he started out to accomplish as a
 youth, when he first emerged as a poor man's Bob Dylan, Mr. Springsteen
 has perfected a thoroughly American sound that is as wholesome and 
reassuring as Lawrence Welk's.<br>
<br>
But in the end, the genius of Bruce Springsteen is that he not only gets
 to sing songs like ''Mansion on the Hill,'' but actually gets to live 
in the Mansion on the Hill. In fact, he gets to live in the Mansion on 
the Hill precisely because he sings about people who do not live in the 
Mansion on the Hill, but who like to buy records about people who would 
like to live in the Mansion in the Hill, but cannot afford it, so they 
live in Secaucus.<br>
<br>
Here, we come to the central dilemma of pop music: How do you write 
about the plight of life's victims when you yourself have been in the 
highest tax bracket since the Ford administration? How do you deplore 
the false promise of the American dream when you are the very 
incarnation of it? Do you take a cue from the Rolling Stones and David 
Bowie and just leave the class warfare stuff alone? Or do you write from
 memory? Springsteen, for whatever the reason, has chosen the latter 
course. He lives in Rumson, but his heart is still in Asbury Park.<br>
<br>
Gazing at Sis's cornball photos of big brother Bruce, one cannot help 
thinking that America probably needs some rigorous guidelines governing 
the donning of the proletarian alter ego. Faux proles should be forced 
to spend a month doing community service in a housing project where they
 could meet some real working-class people. Ex-proles like Mr. 
Springsteen should accept that there is a statute of limitations on the 
migrant-worker shtick.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is a great star, and New Jersey (and the nation) is 
lucky to have him. But exhibitions like ''Troubadour of the Highway'' 
belong in the lobby of the record company (Columbia Records/Sony Music) 
that helped underwrite this exhibit, not in an art museum. Art museums, 
like it or not, are for serious people, not rock stars who like to get 
dolled up as migrant workers, the way Marie Antoinette and her frivolous
 entourage use to frolic as shepherdesses.<br>
<br>
It is probably true that the highways are jammed with broken heroes on a
 last chance power drive. But there's no reason museums should be jammed
 with them.</div>

<br>
Houston Culture<br>
BY JIM BEVIGLIA<br>
<br>
When you consider the staggeringly consistent brilliance with which 
Bruce Springsteen has conducted his career for the past four decades or 
so, it would seem like splitting hairs to say that any one era was 
better than another.  Boss backers are never shy with their opinions 
though, and many often point to the period surrounding the release of 
Darkness On The Edge Of Town in 1978 as a time when Bruce and the E 
Street Band reached a peak with their live shows.<br>
<br>
The evidence arrives in the new box set, The Promise, which, among its 
many other features, includes a show from December 12, 1978 at The 
Summit in Houston. (For those too young to remember, The Summit is now 
Lakewood Church.) You might think it odd for Bruce to choose a location 
for a live release far from his Jersey-based stronghold in the 
Northeast, but it makes sense upon further review.<br>
<br>
Part of it was likely dictated by what footage was available, and the 
stuff we’ve got here, albeit on the dark side video-wise, certainly 
features a pretty pristine audio representation of the show.  But, more 
importantly, the fact that the video comes from a relatively foreign 
area for Springsteen makes it the perfect place for a showcase of the 
band circa ’78, because they were clearly out on the stage with 
something to prove.<br>
<br>
As great as the band was on its most recent tour, everything that Bruce 
does now can seem like a victory lap, and deservedly so. The Houston 
show harkens back to a time when, despite all of the hoopla garnered by 
Born To Run just a few years before, Springsteen still wasn’t a national
 force the way some of his peers were. He was determined to change all 
that though, and the three hours worth of effort he gives forth here is 
evidence of that.<br>
<br>
The Darkness songs (seven of the 10 are included in this performance) 
also were key in bringing a different element to a Springsteen 
performance. Whereas the songs from the first two albums and Bruce’s 
astute selections of vintage rock cover songs brought the good times, 
and the Born To Run songs played up the theatrics, the songs from 
Darkness were the most brutally realistic of his career to that date. 
Included here, they help to round out the other aspects of the show and 
make for a musical evening that leaves little else that an audience 
member could possibly desire.<br>
<br>
Bruce zealots will get a kick out of the “new” songs previewed here:  
“Independence Day”, “The Ties That Bind," and “Point Blank” would of 
course become linchpins of The River. The sequencing is brilliant here 
as well; he uses the first set to showcase Darkness, then comes out 
after the intermission (remember those?) with a slew of good-time songs 
(“Santa Claus Is Coming To Town”, “Rosalita”, “Fire”) and extended set 
pieces (“She’s The One” with an elongated intro, “Because The Night” 
featuring Bruce shredding on lead guitar.)  The concert glides 
seamlessly from one exhilarating crescendo to the next.<br>
<br>
Watching the Houston show as a longtime Springsteen fan, it’s impossible
 to not feel a little nostalgic. Yes, the band is still going strong, 
but there’s something indelibly moving about watching Bruce and Clarence
 Clemons dancing in unison during “Detroit Medley," or seeing the 
original seven-piece band churning out hit after hit at the absolute 
pinnacle of their game, or, most of all, hearing the late Dan Federici’s
 mournful organ swirling alongside Roy Bittan’s piano on “Racing in the 
Street."<br>
<br>
As for Bruce himself, nothing much has changed. In ’78, the hair was a 
little thicker, the muscles were a little leaner, but he was as powerful
 a performer as ever. Houston Bootleg ’78 may be a specific document of a
 stellar time in the career of a great artist.  But it’s not unique in 
showing the Boss’ passion for rock and roll; that’s on display every 
single time he takes the stage.</div>

<br>
WINTERLAND NIGHT<br>
<br>
In 1979 ( or possibly early 1980) I acquired my very first bootleg 
recording, thereby gaining my first experience of a live Springsteen 
concert.  The 3-LP set I discovered on a London market stall was called 
Live In The Promised Land (Slipped Disc Records/Piste Disques) and it 
contained the majority of Springsteen’s Winterland Concert of 15 
December 1978.  I was overwhelmed by the quality of the performance and 
with good reason.  Crystal Cat’s booklet calls this “a performance that 
is commonly regarded by many Bruce Springsteen fans as one of the all 
time classics.”  The Killing Floor Database  states that ”the 
performance was one of the best ever.”  Lynn Elder, author of the early 
1990s Springsteen bootleg CD guide, You Better Not Touch, is 
particularly effusive when writing  about Great Dane’s later CD 
incarnation of the show:<br>
“One of the most important shows Springsteen ever performed, and one of 
legendary status among fans, this boot captures Springsteen in his 
prime…The performance is simply monumental and must be considered one of
 Springsteen’s best ever.  An essential item for any Bruce fan to own.”<br>
Live In The Promised Land appeared in three packages: a box, a gatefold 
sleeve and a single sleeve.  It also spawned several copies on various 
labels, some in very shoddy packaging.  However, there was also an LP 
version of the full concert, the 4-disc Winterland (no label).  The show
  was released on CD in 1989 by the Great Dane label as Live In The 
Promised Land and reissued the following year in improved sound quality 
in their Master Plus series.  There was also a version on the Golden 
Stars label entitled Live At Winterland, which I believe was a copy of 
the original Great Dane version.  The CD-R Santa Claus In Winterland 
(Alternative Edge Productions) was also a knock-off of the Great Dane 
release.  The Brucebase website mentions a further version of the show 
called Prodigal Son At Winterland – 25th Anniversary Edition.  Although 
this is more recent than the Crystal Cat version under review, I have no
 further knowlege of this release.<br>
Unlike Great Dane, Crystal Cat’s release includes a DJ from KSAN-FM 
welcoming the listeners from the various radio stations also 
broadcasting the concert.  This is followed by Bill Graham’s 
introduction, in which he asks the audience to welcome “the chairman of 
the board, the great one – Bruce Springsteen.”  (Having had to suffer 
the negative consequences of excessive hype on more than one occasion 
already in his career, one wonders whether Springsteen would have been 
pleased by being described in such terms.)<br>
The show itself begins with a thunderous rendition of Badlands, which 
heralds a slew of songs from Springsteen’s then-latest LP Darkness On 
The edge Of Town.  Seven of the first eight numbers come from the new LP
 (the exception being a boisterously enjoyable Spirit In The Night).  
Tougher, darker and bleaker than Springsteen’s earlier albums, it has 
often been described as a more “adult” work (as opposed to the 
”adolescent” Born To Run).  This harder edge comes across very 
effectively in the renditions of Badlands, Streets Of Fire, Darkness On 
The Edge Of Town, Factory and The Promised Land, all of which are played
 in performances very close to the LP versions, but with even greater 
fire and energy (or, in the case of the slower and quieter Factory, more
 poignancy).  The renditions of Streets Of Fire and Darkness On The Edge
 Of Town are particularly impassioned.<br>
Having been greatly impressed thus far, I was stunned by what came next.
  Prove It All Night opens with some melodic mid-paced piano from Roy 
Bittan and then, after a brief spoken introduction, continues with a 
superbly played guitar solo from Springsteen which builds in intensity 
until it culminates in an explosive opening to the song itself.  At the 
end of a stirring performance further guitar work brings this 
eleven-minute number to a triumphant conclusion.  The song was played 
regularly in this fashion on the Darkness On The Edge Of Town tour but 
this is the finest version I have heard.<br>
An excellent rendition of Racing In The Street follows, featuring 
mellifluous piano from Bittan, whose playing provides a bridge into an 
equally fine full-band performance of Thunder Road.  The epic Jungleland
 brings the first set, though not the first disc, to a close.  The 
second set is too long to fit on one CD and so Crystal Cat  end disc one
 with its first song, an enjoyable performance of the then-unreleased 
The Ties That Bind.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Disc 2 begins with a spoken introduction to Santa Claus Is Coming To 
Town.  Springsteen relates the story of how he and Steve Van Zandt, 
carrying their guitars and amps home from a gig, run into Santa Claus 
himself.  Judging by the deep-voiced “Ho! Ho! Ho!” and the audience 
cheers Santa is played by a thinly-disguised Clarence Clemons.  The band
 then launch into the song itself with great gusto, producing their best
 live rendition of an admittedly throwaway number. This is followed by  a
 smokily atmospheric rendition of The Fever with Danny Federici’s organ,
 Roy Bittan’s piano and Clarence Clemons’ saxophone combining to great 
effect.  Fire continues in a similar vein and then the tempo changes 
with the breathless Candy’s Room and an inspired seven-minute Because 
The Night.  Much as I enjoy Patti Smith’s lighter and more melodic 
version (described in Angus MacKinnon’s New Musical Express review as “a
 near perfect single”), it must be said that Springsteen takes the song 
to a different level.  With a harder edge than the Smith recording, this
 version features further superb guitar work from Springsteen – a slow 
opening features an effective combination of guitar and piano and a 
faster guitar solo appears later in the song.<br>
Like the version of Prove It All Night the next song, Point Blank, is 
one of the highlights not just of this set, but of Springsteen’s entire 
recorded live work.  After an superbly atmospheric introduction 
featuring Bittan’s piano backed with Max Weinberg’s shimmering cymbals 
and Clemons’ triangle, the song, driven by Bittan’s haunting piano, 
delivers a shattering account of life lived in poverty and in the grip 
of drug dependency.  The song made its debut at The Roxy in Los Angeles 
on 7 July 1978 and Springsteen explained that it concerned a couple he 
knew who had to work two jobs a day to avoid having their house 
repossessed.  However, there is also a clear theme of drug use (“And so 
you stumble out into the morning/Searching for your usual fix”). 
According to Patrick Humphries and Chris Hunt in Blinded By The Light 
this was the result of  ”a girl friend’s drug addiction”.  The harrowing
 nature of the lyrics comes from the sense of utter hopelessness.  As 
Springsteen went on to say at The Roxy, it is “a song about being 
trapped and not being able to get out”  – and, even worse, not even 
being able to comprehend who is responsible for your plight (“So you go 
home and you pack your pistol/And you go out looking for someone/But, 
girl, can’t you see they got you caught in the middle?/You don’t know 
where to aim your gun”).  The version of this song on The River, as well
 as being inferior in execution, dilutes the emotional impact by 
introducing a relationship break-up theme (prompted, according to 
Christopher Sandford in Point Blank, by the ending of Springsteen’s 
relationship with Lynn Goldsmith).<br>
She’s The One follows, prefaced, as often, not just with Mona but with a
 brief excerpt from Springsteen’s own The Preacher’s Daughter.  The 
performance culminates in the “I Get Mad” section, which Humphries and 
Hunt list as a discrete song.  Then comes the third stunning highlight 
of this concert, a heartfelt Backstreets which features the most 
impassioned and poignant version of the spoken “Sad Eyes” interlude.  
Having been betrayed by his lover in the  number itself (“But I hated 
him and I hated you when you went away”) the song’s protagonist meets 
his ex-lover long after the relationship’s end, which culminates in an 
almost unbearably sad reminiscence (“You promised you’d never leave 
without me…like everything else from those days, you promised…and you 
lied”).<br>
Astoundingly, Springsteen then introduces Rosalita as  “the saddest song
 we’re gonna play all night.”  The conceit here is that Rosie has left 
him and that he is on “a nationwide hunt [for her] disguised as a rock 
and roll tour.”  After the genuine emotion of Backstreets, this comes 
across as unbelievably crass.  Fortunately, the song itself, replete 
with band introductions, brings the second set to its usual triumphant 
conclusion.<br>
The encores consist of  raucous versions of Born To Run and the Devil 
With The Blue Dress Medley, followed by  exuberant renditions of Tenth 
Avenue Freeze Out and (after a pause and some DJ comments) Eddie Floyd’s
 Raise Your Hand.  The concert should have ended here and the disc 
contains parting comments from the DJs.  However, Springsteen and the 
band returned unexpectedly to perform a wild version of Quarter To 
Three.<br>
The quality of the sound on these CDs is excellent.  According to the 
booklet, “this release offers the finest sound quality that this show 
has ever been graced with, transferred digitally from the radio station 
master reels and mastered with the customary care and attention!”  The 
sound is not absolutely perfect, however, but this seems to be more to 
do with the sound balance achieved by Iovine during the recording.  As 
the Killing Floor Database states: “This release was not taken from the 
same tape as the GDR release.  The sound is PERFECT, even if not 
perfectly mixed, so that some instruments lose something.  Anyway, 
surely the best quality you can get for this show by now.”  The CDs are 
housed in a thick jewel case with a trifold booklet.   The photos appear
 to be from the actual concert (though this is not specified) and the 
discs themselves are printed in colour.  This release is exemplary in 
every way and it should be a key component of every serious Springsteen 
collection.</div>

<br>
Amazon.com review<br>
<br>
This collection of music videos shows Springsteen's sometimes love/hate 
relationship with the music video format. He obviously recognized their 
value but never quite seemed comfortable in front of the camera. Not 
surprisingly, the best videos here are the live performance clips, 
although some of the conceptual pieces are impressive.<br>
Here's a breakdown of some of the highlights (and lowlights):<br>
<br>
Disc One:<br>
<br>
"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)": This is one of Springsteen's great 
concert songs, filmed in 1978, which some people consider the best 
period of his performing career. The production values are a little 
rough. The camera angles are limited and the print quality is poor, but 
the performance overcomes both of these shortcomings.<br>
<br>
"The River" and "Thunder Road": Both of these were taken from the 
concert film "No Nukes," a record of the 1979 protest concert. The 
performance is first rate and the production values are a giant leap 
forward from "Rosalita."<br>
<br>
"Atlantic City": This is the first "concept" video in Springsteen's 
career. In reality, it's a rather low-key montage of black and white 
images of the eponymous city. Bruce does not appear in the video.<br>
<br>
"Dancing In The Dark": Springsteen's first conscious stab at the music 
video format. This is a pseudo-live performance clip filmed at the first
 couple of shows of the 1984 tour. Stiff and uninspired, it's better 
known for having introduced the world to Courtney Cox.<br>
<br>
"Born In The U.S.A": Another less-than-successful attempt at a music 
video. It features live footage of Springsteen in a shotgun marriage to 
the studio version of the song. The lack of mobility for the camera, 
combined with the poor lip-synching between the film and the music, show
 Springsteen still struggling with the music video.<br>
<br>
"I'm on Fire": Springsteen leaps into the conceptual video with both 
feet. A totally non-performance video, it features Bruce playing an auto
 mechanic. As an actor, he acquits himself adequately, but I don't think
 Robert DeNiro will lose any sleep.<br>
<br>
"Glory Days": Probably the most successful concept video of the Born in 
the U.S.A. era, it combines footage of Springsteen as a 
baseball-obsessed construction worker with a lip-synched performance of 
the entire E-Street Band in a working class bar. It also shows why Bruce
 will never win the Cy Young Award.<br>
<br>
"My Hometown": The first of several purely live performance video, this 
one was taken form the L.A. Coliseum shows of October, 1985. Simple but 
effective, it shows Springsteen in his element, playing one of his best 
songs.<br>
<br>
"War": A blistering version of Edwin Starr's classic protest song, this 
video comes from the same show as "My Hometown." If you look closely, 
you can see Bruce checking the cheat sheet taped to his arm as he was 
still just learning this song.<br>
<br>
"Fire": A lively and humorous version of the classic song, this was 
taken from the first Bridge School Benefit concert in 1986. Although 
this was to promote the live album, this video does not feature the same
 version of the song. Taken from the in-house video system, the video 
quality is a little spotty but the performance more than makes up for 
it.<br>
<br>
"Born to Run": A live cut from the 1985 stadium tour, it also intercuts 
this footage with various shots taken from other shows. No concept here,
 other to show Bruce Springsteen in his natural element (live in 
concert) playing one his greatest live songs.<br>
<br>
"Brilliant Disguise": This is a bizarre video, showing Bruce alone in a 
kitchen with his guitar, singing live to a recorded instrumental track. 
There are no cuts as the camera slowly zooms into his face in one long 
continuous shot. It's an effective performance and certainly unique for 
its minimalist approach.<br>
<br>
"Tunnel of Love": This video shows a formula that Bruce would use a 
several more times, combining Bruce-less conceptual footage with shots 
of Springsteen lip synching. This video probably marks the first time he
 used the non-concert video format to its fullest advantage.<br>
<br>
"One Step Up": Another video in the "Tunnel of Love" tradition, feature 
shots of Bruce as a straying husband in a girly bar (probably includes 
the most skin of any Bruce video). The fact that this video predates his
 affair with Patti Scialfa and his messy divorce from Julianne Phillips 
makes this one interesting on a whole other level.<br>
<br>
"Tougher Than The Rest": This is the first live video from the 1988 tour
 featuring very well-shot concert footage intercut with shots of various
 couples kissing and clowning outside the auditorium. On a side note, I 
don't see anyone could have seen the goo-goo eyes Bruce and Patti 
Scialfa were making at each other and not known *something* was up 
between them. Okay, maybe they were acting, but history says otherwise.<br>
<br>
"Spare Parts": Another live video, taken from a show on the 1988 
European tour. It features a long opening piano interlude with Bruce 
trying too hard to explain the significance of the song. There's nothing
 wrong with the performance but the video quality is a little subpar. 
This may have something to do with PAL video being coverted over to 
American NTSC standards.<br>
<br>
"Born to Run": This is the acoustic-only version of the song from the 
1988 tour (same show that produced the "Tougher Than The Rest" video). 
This has always been one of my favorites versions of this song and the 
video shows it well, although a concert video of one guy with an 
acoustic guitar probably won't excite the casual fan, but then they'll 
probably tune out during Springsteen's LONGwinded introduction.<br>
<br>
Disc Two:<br>
<br>
"Human Touch": The first video of the post-E-Street-Band era, this comes
 from the same director responsible for "Tunnel of Love" and "One Step 
Up" and shows the same basic approach. The pictures are pretty but the 
formula was starting to get a little repetitive by this point.<br>
<br>
"Better Days": One of Bruce's least known videos, it breaks away from 
the "Tunnel of Love" formula, even though its from the same director, 
featuring a live-in-the-studio performance of the song, interspersed 
with Bruce clowning with his new band and his kids (someone's kids 
anyway). The ragged, uneven end to the song is oddly endearing.<br>
<br>
"57 Channels (And Nothing On)": I had never even heard of this video 
before getting this DVD. It's as close as Bruce ever got to the 
too-literal "match the image to the lyric" school of video. Probably the
 least interesting pure-conceptual video Bruce has done.<br>
<br>
"Leap of Faith": Another video from the same director as the live 
"Tougher Than The Rest" clip and it shows the same basic approach, 
mixing in footage from other songs and even other concerts. The 
performance is energetic enough but the formulaic approach and the lack 
of the E-Street Band's chemistry undercut the video somewhat.<br>
<br>
"Streets of Philadelphia": The video for Bruce's Oscar and Emmy-winning 
song from the Jonathan Demme movie. Similar in some respects to "My 
Brilliant Disguise", combining the studio instrumental track with a new 
live vocal track by Bruce recorded as his walks the aforementioned 
streets. Clever editing lets Bruce exchange meaningful glances with Tom 
Hank's character from the movie.<br>
<br>
"Murder Incorporated": A live version of the legendary "lost" 
Springsteen song (It was to be the title track of the album Springsteen 
scrapped in favor of the more upbeat and accessible "Born In The 
U.S.A."), this was Bruce's first performance with the E-Street Band in 
almost seven years. Filmed in front of an audience at a small New York 
club, the cramped quarters limited the mobility of Jonathan Demme's 
cameras and the inadequate lighting makes Bruce and the band look almost
 sinister. The blistering performance, however, carries the day.<br>
<br>
"Secret Garden": Bruce's love letter to the fairer sex, he's the only 
person with a Y Chromosome in this video, showing a large variety of 
women of all shapes, sizes and ages, emoting for the camera. Tender and 
beautifully filmed, this is one of my favorites of Springsteen's recent 
videos. There are actually two versions of the video on this DVD, the 
second using the alternate "Strings" mix of the song.<br>
<br>
"Hungry Heart": This is a really strange bird, apparently filmed for an 
anniversary release of the song in Germany, it was filmed "live" in 
Berlin with a new vocal by Bruce over the original 1980 instrumental 
track. Features shows of a Bruce playing with a local band and driving 
around the city past sections of the Berlin Wall.<br>
<br>
"Dead Man Walking": Unlike "Streets of Philadelphia", this video 
features significant footage from the film that insprired the song, 
making it more of a trailer for the film than the video. Nothing wrong 
with that I guess, but makes for one of the lesser contribution to 
Springsteen's video oeuvre.<br>
<br>
"The Ghost of Tom Joad": In a lot of ways, this is the spiritual cousin 
to "Atlantic City", in that it combines black and white 
documentary-style footage and nothing of the singer (except as a 
silhouette in a couple of shots). This is the more effective of the two 
because the footage is a better match to the theme of the song.<br>
<br>
"The Ghost of Tom Joad": The second video for the same song, this was 
taken from Bruce's appearance on the Tonight Show. I don't have anything
 against this performance or this song, but if they were going to take a
 second video for a song from a talk show, I would have preferred the 
version of "Murder Incorporated" he did on the Letterman show earlier 
that year.<br>
<br>
"Highway Patrolman": Here's a video with a long, unique history. A song 
recorded in 1982 inspires a Sean Penn film in 1991 and the two get 
combined for a music video in the year 2000. I'll say this much, it made
 me want to see the film ("The Indian Runner").<br>
<br>
"If I Should Fall Behind": Shot during rehearsal for the 1999-2000 
reunion tour, this features a single camera shot of the E-Street Band 
trading vocals on Springsteen's 1992 song. Unfortunately, the vocals are
 a bit overwrought. The version on the second disc of the "Live in NYC" 
DVD is more restrained and more effective.<br>
<br>
"Born In The U.S.A.": If the last video was OVERwrought, this video is 
badly UNDERwrought. From Bruce's appearance on the "Charlie Rose Show", 
the best description I can offer of Bruce's performance is "autistic." 
It's a kinder word than "lifeless." If I had been a member of 
Springsteen's inner circle, I would have sat on Bruce until he came to 
his senses and left this video off this collection. It brings the second
 disc to a limp and unsatisfying conclusion.</div>

<br>
The Hollywood Reporter<br>
<br>
It what’s likely to be remembered as the Milan Marathon, the veteran 
group -- which features a half-dozen sexagenarians and a 58-year-old -- 
kept many in the crowd at San Siro Stadium up past their bedtimes with a
 three-hour, 40-minute gig for the ages. Springsteen’s publicists said 
it was the second-longest in the band’s 40-year history, behind only the
 legendary and widely bootlegged New Year’s Eve 1980 show at Nassau 
Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y.<br>
The band hit the stage to strains of Italian Ennio Morricone’s theme 
from Once Upon a Time in the West and wrapped 33 songs later with a 
cover of The Isley Brothers classic “Twist and Shout.” By contrast, they
 played a mere 25 songs over a paltry two hours and 40 minutes at their 
Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena show in April.<br>
<br>
The bulked-up band, stretched to 16 pieces for the current Wrecking Ball
 tour, played a truly career-spanning set Thursday, though the 1990s 
went unrepresented. Twenty of the songs came from Springsteen’s first 
seven albums covering the years 1972-84 -- that’s including "The 
Promise," which was recorded circa 1978 during the Darkness on the Edge 
of Town sessions but not released until decades later -- along with 
three from 2002’s The Rising and eight from this year’s Wrecking Ball.<br>
Six tracks from 1984’s worldwide smash Born in the U.S.A. were deployed,
 compared with only one (“Dancing in the Dark”) at the L.A. show two 
months ago. The only other album Springsteen touched on Thursday was 
2007’s Magic, whose lead single, “Radio Nowhere,” was played late in the
 main set. “Twist and Shout” was the night’s lone cover.<br>

The Milan show harkened to more than a quarter-century ago, when 
Springsteen and the band played way past the three-hour mark nearly 
every night. They are on their first tour without longtime saxman 
Clarence Clemons, who died nearly a year ago at 69. They are set to play
 22 more European shows through July before returning to North America, 
where multiple-date stadium gigs are booked for Boston, Philadelphia and
 East Rutherford, N.J. More U.S. dates are expected to be announced.<br>

Springsteen's early grit revealed on famous 1975 show<br>
<br>
The Sydney Morning Herald<br>
<br>
May 12, 2011<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen fans have been waiting more than three decades to hear this.<br>
<br>
A concert witnessed by fewer than 300 people has passed into legend among devotees of "the Boss".<br>
<br>
Record company Columbia had lost $150,000 on his first two LPs. 
Springsteen, though, displayed the drive that was to make him a star 
when playing in Bryn Mawr ("Big Hill" in Welsh), Pennsylvania.<br>
<br>
The gig was broadcast on local radio station WMMR and has been the subject of murky bootlegs under different titles.<br>
<br>
Now Live at the Main Point 1975 shows clearly why critic Jon Landau was proclaiming Springsteen as the future of rock.<br>
<br>
I've seen many Springsteen concerts from the 1980s in which he played as his life depended on it.<br>
<br>
Never was the "make or break" truer than at the now-defunct Main Point 
as he previewed songs for the soon-to-be-released Born to Run.<br>
<br>
Its title-track lyric speaks of "broken heroes on a last-chance power drive". Springsteen could be talking about himself.<br>
<br>
The disc is worth seeking out, if only for Wings for Wheels. This is an early version of Thunder Road, with different verses.<br>
<br>
Another standout is New York City Serenade, which has an expanded monologue and instrumentals that push it towards 20 minutes.<br>
<br>
The E Street Band sound great, boosted by violinist Suki Lahav.<br>
<br>
Still, they were to get even better when guitarist Steve van Zandt joined soon after.</div>

<br>
SPUTNIK MUSIC <br>
John Cruz <br>
<br>
January 23rd, 2006 <br>
<br>
Summary: The Boss gets married to a model/actress and soon after fails 
at marriage and decides to sing about it. Heartfelt, real, and very 
knowing Bruce searches his soul on Tunnel Of Love and comes up empty. He
 may not feel good, but it makes for great art.<br>
<br>
In mid 1984 after an extended break which came at the end of The River 
tour and the release of an accidental, near classic demo tape called 
Nebraska in 1982, Bruce Springsteen finally released the album that 
would help cement his place in Rock n Roll history for the ages. Born In
 The USA, or as Bruce likes to call it, "that rock record" released in 
mid 1984 amidst the Reagan era in America and a recession in the 
American economy, was a shot of twangy, stripped down homespun rock n 
roll heard around the country and around the world. Polished, loud, at 
times bombastic, and less soulful then the records which came before it,
 it was a direct bullseye of a rock n roll record. It didn't matter that
 the songs were written for the most part at the same time the songs for
 the dark and desperate Nebraska were written, or that in large part 
lyrically they were similarly downbeat and desperate, if not quite as 
dark. The music snapped, crackled and popped, the American flag was 
draped across the cover, and an all american homeboy from New Jersey was
 inviting you to come along for the ride and dance away all your worries
 and concerns about economic hardship, the cold war, and a county 
divided by politics. Born In The USA was the right album at the right 
time, and after years of hard work and even harder touring, Bruce was a 
bonafide rock n roll household name and superstar at last. The train 
that had been coming for the past decade had finally arrived for Bruce 
Springsteen and the E Street Band. And they rode it for all it was 
worth.<br>
<br>
But with success of this kind also comes the trappings of success. And 
among those trappimgs are women. A lot of women. Bruce was never known 
as a groupie hound or rock n roll party dude. It was the music that 
mattered to him, and for the most part he had the image of someone on 
the straight and narrow. Women came and women went, and he had in his 
past a couple of steady but discreet girlfriends as well. But like the 
cover of Tom Waits "Jersey Girl" he would sometimes perform live 
suggests, when Bruce settled down he would surely pick a rose from the 
garden of New Jersey, right? How could he not? He was Jersey born and 
bred, through and through. Well, wrong. Caught up in his own success and
 what a "Rockstar" is supposed to do, Bruce met and married Hollywood 
model/actress Julianne Philips soon after he was introduced to her. And 
whatever his real motive for doing so, it was a mistake that would shape
 this album and his next two to come, and in fact change his artistic, 
creative, and spiritual life for many years.. And it is the Tunnel Of 
Love album that got those wheels of change turning.<br>
<br>
Tunnel Of Love gets started on familiar Springsteen ground with the solo
 acoustic rave up "Ain't Got You". But something is different in the 
lyrics. Sung from a first person perspective rather then creating a 
character or story as is often the case with Bruce, it'a tense tale of a
 man who seemingly has it all except the one thing that would make it 
all worth it: The woman of his choice and desire. Never one to represent
 in song those who have "all the riches any man ever knew" and still not
 satisfied, the listener is brought to wonder just who the subject of 
the song is as Springsteen huffs and puffs frustratedly into the mic. 
But by songs end it becomes clear as the lines "I been all around the 
world and across the seven seas/Been paid a kings ranson for doing what 
comes naturally" clearly exposes the singer as his own subject. After 
this acoustic rave up the listener is prepared for an explosion. 
Afterall, this is the guy who has been rocking around the world for the 
past three and a half years. The Boss. Certainly he has come to keep the
 rock n roll train moving? And he's off to a fiery start. "1-2-3-4- I 
was Born In The USA, Part 2" is certainly up next, right? Nope. And so 
the turn away from his past begins.....<br>
<br>
An album of three parts really, what we get first is very much typical 
Springsteen, however unexpected or different then what we've gotten on 
his previous 7 albums. The stark acoustic treatment of "Ain't Got You" 
gives way to big drums and lush keyboards for the next song up, and the 
album gets off to it's real start after a somewhat curious opener. 
"Tougher Then The Rest" is a mid-tempo ballad with a country flavor 
built around twangy guitar, harmonica, and strong direct vocals that 
leave no doubt about it's statements of romantic commitment. The guy in 
the song making his plea is certainly no prize for most, but he's ready 
to offer what he has to give, and promises to be true and steady to the 
object of his affection. "All you have to do is say yes" is his only 
condition, and it's as heartfelt an offering as he can muster to someone
 he recognizes might need someone or something just like him. It's an 
all or nothing, take what you can get kind of romantic offering. But 
he's willing to stick it out if only given a chance. Or walk away if 
not. <br>
<br>
The E Street Band make their first appearance on the album for the dirty
 in Texas rocker "Spare Parts" that kicks off the next segment of the 
album. "Bobby said he'd pull out/Bobby stayed in" kicks the song off, 
and you can guess the rest. The band plays it straight and true with 
just a hint of danger and forboding flair, and it suits this cautionary 
tale to a tee. Ultimitely a song about moving on at all cost and simply 
playing the cards that are dealt you (and that you have dealt yourself) 
"Spare Parts" could of easily fit somewhere on The River LP that came 
several years before. Desperate, lonely and dispairing, Bruce does here 
what he has done so many times before, making a heroine out of the young
 lady stuck between a rock and a hard place and having her find 
redemption by putting away her past and moving on by songs end. This, 
for all intents and purposes is a valentine to all the single mothers 
out there who have ever wanted to take it all back if only they could. 
And the message seems to be you can still find reason, purpose, and 
meaning to go on even if built from the broken pieces of your past. The 
only real rocker on the album (and one of only two where he utilizes his
 entire band) this is familiar ground for the songwriter and he hits the
 nail on the head. And The E Street Band back him up nicely all the way 
through.<br>
<br>
The first half of the album ends with what is perhaps Bruce's most 
personal and revealing song up until this point in his career, and it 
also marks a change in tone for the record. Coming after the "newly in 
love" songs that began the album and the cautionary tales of Spare Parts
 and Cautious Man, Walk Like A Man is the first time on the record where
 Bruce becomes reflective about his own experiances with the fear and 
trepidation that something like marraige can bring. A song about losing 
the innocence of childhood but not being quite sure of yourself as an 
adult entering life with another, Walk Like A Man is a tender ballad 
that explores the questions of what it means to be committed to 
something that is larger then you, and your responsibilty to that 
commitment. Ultimatley a song about a boy and his father, Bruce has gone
 down this road before, as he and his dad were often at odds with each 
other, and he had written songs before inspired by his father. Here, he 
seems to let go of those differences to realize he perhaps needs some of
 what his father once had that used to divide them to get through the 
task at hand. And as he sings "Well tonite you step away from me and 
alone at the alter I stand/As I watch my bride coming down the aisle I 
pray for the strength to walk like a man", while at the beginning of the
 song he recalled "Being five years old following behind you at the 
beach tracing your footprints in the sand/Trying to walk like a man", 
you understand things have come full circle for the singer, but that 
perhaps he isn't quite ready to take those steady steps that are 
nessesary to see the job through. So although he speaks with resolve by 
songs end, the meloncholy tone of the music and the reflective lyrics 
leave you with the impression that enough doubt still remains to bring 
it all crumbling down. <br>
<br>
The E Street Band make their second appearance for the next song and it 
is interesting to note that they never play as a full group on the 
album, making this for all intents and purposes a Bruce Springsteen 
"solo" album in the truest sense of the word. He plays all instruments 
(including drums) except where otherwise noted, and the saxaphone of 
Clarence Clemons, which had been a staple of the E Street Band sound for
 over ten years, is nowhere to be found whatsover. In fact, seven of the
 twelve songs are performed by Bruce alone, and yet on others various 
members show up as what seems to be token gestures at best. It has been 
said that Tunnel Of Love is a Springsteen album for people who don't 
like Bruce Springsteen, as well as for people who do. And his 90 degree 
turn away from his band may be one of the biggest reasons why. No longer
 tied to expectations of what or who he is supposed to be as a recording
 artist, the album finds him touching on themes and exploring sounds 
that up until now you would never associate with Bruce in the past. And 
he pulls the entire thing off with uniform brilliance.<br>
<br>
But it's the stirring title track and next three songs after which are 
the true heart of the album. "Tunnel Of Love" "Two Faces" "Brilliant 
Disguise" and "One Step Up", each of which are about the deception we 
sometimes lose ourselves in for the sake of love or the illusion of 
love, are among the best songs ever written by the songwriter. "Two 
Faces", about making promises you can't hope to keep and hurting the one
 you love in spite of your best intentions, in spite of yourself (or 
perhaps because of yourself), and the inability to do anything about it,
 finds Bruce sorrowful, defiant, and confused despite knowing exactly 
what the problem is. "One that laughs/One that cries/One says hello/One 
says goodbye/One does things I don't understand/Makes me feel like half a
 man" is all he can make of it, and he seems helpless to do anything 
about it except challenge himself in futile self posturing against it, 
while he hurts the one he loves and breaks the promises once so easily 
made. "One Step Up" similarly finds him struggling with trying to 
measure up to ideals and principles he was was once so sure of and 
finding that these cannot be applied to matters of the heart, and it is 
these matters of the heart that can take those things from you if you 
don't watch your step. "When I look at myself I don't see/The man I 
wanted to be/Somewhere along the line I slipped off track/I'm caught 
moving one step up and two steps back" he sings before describing being 
lonely and tempted to adultery by some random girl in a bar while he 
pretends to be unattached. Certainly these are not the thoughts and 
words of a man newly wedded to a beautiful Hollywood actress and model. 
But they were Bruce at that moment in time. And "Brilliant Disguise", 
perhaps the most boldly revealing and truthful song Springsteen has ever
 committed to record, lays it all to rest by expressing doubt about 
everything from his wedding night to his wife to himself to the words of
 his best man on his wedding day, and ending the song with the lyric of 
"God have mercy on the man/Who doubts what he is sure of".<br>
<br>
Tunnel Of Love is significant as an album and interesting as a document 
not because it is a groundbreaking work or Springsteen's best album. But
 because it is the sound of an artist leaving his past behind, closing 
the door on old things, and opening a door to new ones. With this album 
we saw many things for this guy we call "The Boss" come to an end. It 
was the beginning of the end of his band whom we all came to know him 
by, it was the beginning of the end of his marriage which he had put so 
much faith in, and it was the beginning of the end of the way he had 
connected with his audience for most of his career. No longer feeling 
like a "man of the people" after all the glory and riches his stardom 
had thrust upon him, Springsteen picked up the broken pieces of faith 
and hope he had once thought were so firmly in his grasp and started 
looking for a new common ground from where he could make that contact 
once again. And never again on record would he ever be Born To Run, Born
 In The USA, or hiding out on the Backstreets. Instead over his next two
 albums and even to this day he would focus his music on faith, love, a 
place to call home, and the joys that love and family can bring despite 
losses and hardship. No longer running, this album is the sound of an 
artist finally growing up. And giving all who are willing to grow up 
with him something new to believe in.</div>

<br>
.Things got even more interesting on 'Tunnel of Love'…a remarkable bunch
 of tunes, where our leader starts having a go at himself, and the 
hypocrisy of his own heart, before anyone else could. But the tabloids 
could never break news on Bruce Springsteen. Because his fans -- he had 
already told us everything in the songs.  -Bono, March 15, 1999 
Inducting Bruce Springsteen into the Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame<br>
Whenever an artist sells north of ten-million copies of a single album 
the expectations for a follow-up are enormous and completely 
unrealistic. Peter Frampton, Michael Jackson, Shania Twain, Whitney 
Houston and dozens of others have tried, but ultimately you can't catch 
lightning in a bottle no matter how hard you try. It doesn't matter how 
many talk shows you appear on, how many morning radio shows you do, how 
many high profile events you attend or how expensive your music videos 
are. Ultimately, no one will remember all that jazz in twenty-years 
time…but if the music's good, they will. Bruce Springsteen was keenly 
aware of this and chose not to even attempt a follow-up. In some ways he
 rode his career momentum in the fall of 1986 with his immense 
three-disc/ 5 LP collection Live 1975-1985, it was an obvious choice and
 it sold a few million copies to appease the suits at CBS/Columbia. 
However, his true follow-up was Tunnel of Love released in October 1987.<br>
Tunnel of Love is an album that disappointed millions upon release. They
 wondered where their jean and bandana wearing patriot had gone. He 
hadn't gone anywhere, he just wasn't the Springsteen they had come to 
love and adore. Despite a slick and styled Springsteen that appeared on 
the cover, inside the record he was a mess. A normal artist would want 
to defend their title and would most likely second guess every move on 
their next record, but Springsteen did what he had always done; speak 
the truth and write from within. Towards the end of the Born in the 
U.S.A. tour, Springsteen married actress Julianne Philips, however, one 
listen to Tunnel and it was apparent that there was trouble in paradise.
 In his book, Songs Springsteen claims the work was not a first person 
account, but more of a man who was in his latter thirties questioning 
his place in the world and inside the home. Tunnel of Love is an album 
void of anthem and choruses so immense they could swallow you. Instead 
it is a collection of a dozen songs that look deeply into love. What has
 made mach one of Springsteen's journeys (1973-1987) so amazing is his 
uncanny ability to reflect his age and experience in each album. Writing
 about Friday nights at the drive-in and car washes wouldn't suffice 
this time around. He had heavier things on his mind and it showed. The 
album was written and recorded quickly in the spring of 1987 mostly in 
his home studio. Members of the E Street Band were brought in later to 
overdub their parts. Only drummer Max Weinberg made consistent 
appearances throughout the album. Springsteen took his characters that 
he obsessed about in the outside world and took them inside the house to
 confront their true demons. Springsteen breaks down the heavy emotions 
that come with commitment and shines a light on the sorrows that don't 
just come from the outside world, but from inner doubt with those 
closest to you.<br>
"Ain't Got You" begins the cavalcade of emotions. Semi-autobiographical,
 Springsteen has a kick at himself and his fame ("Well I got all the 
riches baby any man ever knew, but the only thing I ain't got honey I 
ain't got you"). The rudimentary Bo-Didley beat is harnessed by a 
harmonica and acoustic guitar. The track aches with a longing that no 
amount of success or money could satiate. Little did we know back in 
1987 that he was writing from first-person. "Tougher Than The Rest" may 
appear to be pedestrian at first, but there are swelling emotions as his
 voice trickles with resignation and ultimately defiance ("I want you to
 know I'll walk it for you anytime"). Sung in a lower register, almost 
monotone delivery, the song is anchored by Max Weinberg's steady drums 
and Roy Bittan's revealing synthesizers which never overpower the song 
but make a statement with their pronounced sonics. Holding emotions 
inward on such a proclamation of love may appear to be a mistake, but 
one listen to the harmonica solo at the end and you feel the emotional 
release. "All That Heaven Will Allow" is a pretty little ditty of a song
 with a narrator who is light on his feet, a fast talker and someone who
 is beyond content with life. It's about finding your space in the world
 with a love that is blue and true. Sometimes there is triumph in the 
simplicities of life and when one is truly in love, it makes all of the 
other obstacles placed in front of us that less important. "Spare Parts"
 is a hybrid of country and rock of a female who feels the world crush 
in on her from all angles; an unwanted pregnancy, a boyfriend who has 
fled, longing for her youth and desertion. This song is the most E 
Street of all the songs on the album. Eventually the love for her child 
forces her to move on when she sells off two items that represent dashed
 dreams; her engagement ring and her wedding dress. The character, like 
many in Springsteen's cannon, feels despair, but ultimately comes to 
terms with her lot in life and takes control. "Cautious Man" is the 
quietest and most misunderstood track on the album. It was performed 
only once on the tour that followed months later. The character sketch 
paints a visceral picture full of metaphors ("On his right hand Billy 
tattooed the word love and on his left hand was the word fear"). The 
character of "Billy" struggles with dichotomy of life; his love is 
profound but he is conflicted about it simultaneously. Eventually he 
realizes what he has. We all have doubts and feel trapped by life, the 
weight of being responsible and having to answer to another person is 
enough to overwhelm some and "Billy" feels the crush, but in a waking 
moment of clarity, he knows that while he has doubts, his commitment is 
true ("At their bedside he brushed the hair from his wife's face as the 
moon shone on her skin so white, filling their room with the beauty of 
God's fallen light"). "Walk Like A Man" is another father-son story, but
 this isn't one of resentment and reproach, but one of true sincerity. 
It finds a man on his wedding day speaking of his youthful love for his 
father. People look for the strength to make a happy life and it proves 
to be something far harder than anyone could imagine. In some ways, it's
 a reconciliation between father and son. Time softens anger and the 
narrator pledges to "keep on walking" in his continued growth in life. 
The song begins to see life from his father's point of view after years 
of being at each others throats. The tender lullaby has an appreciation 
for how much hard work goes into relationships and as side-one comes to a
 close, a devastating questions is asked in one of the verses as the 
narrator reminisces about watching wedding with his sister in his youth 
and they ponder "would they ever look so happy again". This brings the 
listener to the second side of the voyage.<br>
Opening side-two is the title track, "Tunnel of Love". The liveliest 
track on the album takes the listener on a dark and mystical ride, much 
like marriage. It's full of metaphors comparing marriage to a carnival 
ride. Featuring an incendiary guitar solo from Nils Lofgren, it could 
hint at the tension and fights that occur when two become one. Love is 
full of ups and downs and staying on the ride is what's vital to its 
survival. When one or the other hops off, they steer off course, 
marriage isn't easy, but in a stunning lyric, Springsteen sums it up 
best, "You've got to learn to live with what you can't rise above if you
 want to ride on down in through this tunnel of love". There is great 
reward in fighting for your love, staying on course and not hopping off 
the roller coaster. Split personalities reign supreme on "Two Faces". 
The narrator struggles to come to terms with his own demons and 
insecurities and even resigns himself to prayer. There are many shades 
to relationships, their formation and ultimately their survival. The 
narrator struggles with his insecurities and is full of contradictions, 
but it's just the tip of the iceberg; wait until the next track. 
"Brilliant Disguise" may be one of Springsteen's greatest achievements. 
It's a evocative and illuminating take on coming to terms with one's 
uncertainties, worries and suspicions. The question arises, do we ever 
open ourselves enough to allow anyone else in? Throughout five verses 
the character tries to fulfill his duty, but can never fully come to 
terms with his qualms. The bracing drums and flourishes of piano add to 
the haunting atmosphere. However, it's the final lyric that haunts you 
as the song fades out.<br>
Tonight our bed is cold  I'm lost in the darkness of our love  God have mercy on the man  Who doubts what he's sure of<br>
Never before has a relationship song been broken down to such simple, 
yet profoundly poetic terms. Most love songs are black and white and on 
"Brilliant Disguise" the area is very grey. Falling in love is easy, 
finding a way to make it work over a long period is the challenge and 
struggle. "One Step Up" takes the self-loathing and fears of the heart 
one step further. Filled with elegiac metaphors, it's essentially about 
two people reaching the end of their marriage. The narrator isn't 
perfect and doesn't see how it can work. But when tempted by another 
woman, a unforgettable lyric is spoken, "Last night I dreamed I held you
 in my arms, the music was never-ending, we danced as the evening sky 
faded to black". On all of Tunnel of Love the characters are not 
profoundly jealous or in seek of revenge, they're lost souls praying for
 God to lead the way. These are everyday people, who struggle with the 
complexities of marriage and long term relationships.<br>
"When You're Alone" finds characters at a crossroads. One leaves home 
swearing never to return and the other stands by contemplating their 
absence. Hinting at shades of earlier character sketches that had 
defined his work, this song is a turnabout of sorts as the characters on
 "Born To Run" and "Thunder Road" were escaping their miserable 
existences, but on "When You're Alone", they may escape but they soon 
realize that comfort is not always found on the open road alone. In the 
final verse, the narrator sends a final send off to his absent lover, 
but it's the final two verses that sting, "It's just nobody knows baby 
where love goes, but when it goes it's gone gone". The irony of course 
is that the one who was left behind in some ways is the one who makes 
the final escape. The album's closer, "Valentine's Day" is an eye 
opening revelatory hymn. At the crux of Tunnel of Love are people trying
 to make sense of their lives, especially within a marriage. Once born, 
you're thrust into the world as you attempt to find your own place and 
create your own unique voice. When you think you've found it, you get 
married and a whole other series of questions and misgivings begin to 
attack your mind. The self-assurance you once had dissipates and the 
cocksure confidence is a shadow of its former self. If you're lucky, you
 find a partner to share these dreams, desires and nightmares with. 
However, others find challenges in lowering their masks. The sexiest 
thing anyone could ever do in front of a loved one is be vulnerable. The
 characters on Tunnel of Love don't trust their partners enough to do 
this. Not only do they not let their guards down, but they have a hard 
time looking themselves in the mirror. The narrator of "Valentine's Day"
 has had his doubts, but he's learned that the world is bigger than 
himself and his dreams. He speaks to a friend who just had a baby and he
 could hear "the light" in his voice. He's come to terms with his fears 
and broken dreams and none of them seem to matter in this moment, all he
 can think of is the loneliness he'd experience without his love ("What 
scares me is losing you"). Unlike the character in "The River", he can 
see through the darkness and realizes that he's in possession of that 
inner light.<br>
Tunnel of Love wasn't the album anyone expected Bruce Springsteen to 
make and in truth, it may be the bravest and most daring record ever 
released by a mega-selling artist. If any other artist had tried to 
release a gloomy and intimate collection songs about love following an 
album that sold twelve-million copies, they would have been committed to
 an institution. What I admire so immensely about this album is that 
Springsteen lowered the expectations before anyone could claim it to be a
 failure. Those who dismissed it for its absence of electrifying guitars
 and bludgeoning drums need to return to this record and revisit it. 
It's an unsettling collection of tunes that tells stories that don't 
always have happy endings but is completely authentic and is still a 
haunting document of a marriage at the crossroads more than two-decades 
after its release. In some ways we feel cheated by artists who write 
syrupy love songs we can't identify with, however, Tunnel of Love steers
 away from vanilla offerings and delves into relationships with a vigor 
only a few others ever had before. None of us have had a relationships 
where it's all love and roses, there are thorns in every relationship 
and this album reminds us, helps make sense and tries to steer us away 
from pricking out finger with one of the thorns. Tunnel of Love may not 
be Bruce Springsteen's most popular album, but anyone who has ever 
listened closely to it intimately will never forget it and its dark 
ride.</div>

<br>
By Ken Takata<br>
The Chicago Reader<br>
Columbia Records CBS 40999<br>
<br>
First let's set the stage.<br>
<br>
June 1984--Bruce Springsteen releases Born in the USA. Later that year, 
he becomes unofficial speech writer for both Ronald Reagan and Walter 
Mondale, as each reaches for a piece of the Springsteen zeitgeist. 
Pressing the flesh and kissing babies in Bruce's home state of New 
Jersey, Reagan says something like: "You have a native son of this great
 state who shares the same aspirations for this country as I do, and I 
can assure you, my campaign for presidency will be born to run!"<br>
<br>
Lee Iacocca offers Springsteen $10 million to become official copywriter
 for Chrysler's commercials, an offer Springsteen declines. Miller Beer 
appropriates what it can from Springsteen's album without precipitating a
 lawsuit, proclaiming that its beer is "born and brewed in the USA."<br>
<br>
Bumper stickers flower on the freeways, exclaiming "Bruce: the Rambo of Rock!"<br>
<br>
The album eventually sells 18 million units worldwide. And everyone from
 presidential candidates to bespectacled TV commentators to beer 
companies hurries to cash in on Brucemania, to claim a part of the 
Springsteen ethos for themselves.<br>
<br>
In October 1987--Springsteen releases Tunnel of Love, with "Brilliant 
Disguise" as its first single. Its refrain goes something like this:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">So when you look at me<br>
<br>
You better look hard and look twice<br>
<br>
Is that me baby<br>
<br>
Or just a brilliant disguise?</em><br>
<br>
Most reviewers of Tunnel of Love will look at the album's title and at 
that refrain and tell you that this latest Springsteen album reflects 
his recent marriage to Julianne Phillips, that it is an album about 
romance. And those reviewers would be right--Tunnel of Love is partly 
about marriage and affairs of the heart. But it's also an album about 
success, the sort of success Springsteen has enjoyed--or 
tolerated--these past three years. Or more precisely, Tunnel of Love is 
about apprehension, apprehension about loving a disguise and calling 
that romance, apprehension about becoming so popular that half one's 
audience mistakes a bitter declamation of faith and betrayal like "Born 
in the USA" for a simple affirmation, for the sort of patriotic salute 
that tests no faith and suffers no betrayal.<br>
<br>
In one sense, Tunnel of Love is a response, Springsteen's reaction to 
all that has happened to him publicly and privately in the last three 
years. And accountably the album is shot through with images of wealth 
and of marriage . . . and also of deep suspicion. In the album's 
greatest moment, these images fuse, take on the same face, the same 
form, until it becomes impossible to tell the romance from its disguise,
 the hope for success and wealth from its uglier consequences. On "Walk 
Like a Man," Springsteen describes a wedding with these words:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Well, would they ever look so happy again<br>
<br>
The handsome groom and his bride<br>
<br>
As they stepped into that long black limousine<br>
<br>
For that mystery ride?</em><br>
<br>
Read those words literally, and it's obviously a song about a honeymoon.
 Listen to those lines in the context of the whole song, the whole 
album, and it begins to sound like more--maybe it's a song about 
success, fancy cars, doing well, getting rich. Spin the words one more 
time and out tumble threats, references to two Elvis songs, allusions 
and images that turn into riddles, and once one knows the references, 
harbingers of fear. One of those Elvis songs is about a poor country 
girl who takes to the city, dies in a car crash, and rides to the 
graveyard in a long black limousine. The other Elvis song, "Mystery 
Train," goes one step beyond "Long Black Limousine," replacing the 
certitude of tragedy in that song with a complete and open-ended 
ambiguity much like that in Tunnel of Love:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Train I ride is sixteen coaches long<br>
<br>
Train I ride is sixteen coaches long<br>
<br>
The girl I love is on that train and gone</em><br>
<br>
Gone where? To someone else, to the city, or to her death? Elvis never 
tells us, and neither does Springsteen. You can read Springsteen's 
mystery ride as just a honeymoon, or even as just the road to endless 
wealth and fame, but that won't negate the threat that underlies those 
long black limousines, won't prevent that ride from turning suddenly 
into a funeral procession. The long black limousine that holds all the 
hopes of romance and wealth is the same car that drives us to the 
graveyard. What emerges from the album's lyrics are ambiguity and an 
enormous suspicion; this is a worried man, speaking softly and moving 
very cautiously.<br>
<br>
But in that sort of caution is the album's greatest paradox. Lyrically, 
"Walk Like a Man" is brilliant. With this song and a few others, 
Springsteen stakes his claim to being the greatest rock 'n' roll 
wordsmith since Chuck Berry, the writer most acutely aware of the 
poetics and subtleties of everyday speech. But musically "Walk Like a 
Man" is a disaster, synthesizers warbling along where you'd expect the E
 Street Band, Roy Bittan's piano, Danny Federici's organ fills. What 
makes "Walk Like a Man" brilliant lyrically--its caution--makes it 
musically a mush, a sort of noncommittal sidestep that stakes no claim, 
moves nowhere.<br>
<br>
The rest of the album musically is likewise hesitant, which is 
especially maddening if one has had a chance to hear some of the 
material that Springsteen chose not to include. One such song, "Murder 
Incorporated" (which is available only on unofficial releases), 
confronts many of the same questions as Tunnel of Love--shows the same 
concern that success means only that people will distort your words into
 whatever they want. But instead of answering with caution, "Murder 
Incorporated" responds violently with a "No! in thunder." Musically a 
cross between "All Along the Watchtower" and "Gimme Shelter," it 
surpasses anything on Tunnel of Love.<br>
<br>
The figure of Elvis Presley hangs over at least one song from Tunnel of 
Love and, I think, over the whole album; he represents, in Greil 
Marcus's words, "the specter of possibility--in rock and roll, pop 
culture, America, modern life--and he remains the fact of ruin." Elvis 
gives us not only a vision of success, wealth, fame, and romance but the
 bloated, drug-riddled corpse of the consequences.<br>
<br>
Everybody has a pet theory, somehow linked to Elvis's success, to 
explain his decline--perhaps because there are so many "obvious" 
reasons. Elvis went downhill because he went to Hollywood and made cheap
 movies, because he went to Las Vegas, because he got fat and old, 
because he released so much utter trash.<br>
<br>
But no one will be able to say the same about Springsteen, because 
compared to Elvis, he hasn't done any of the stupid things, hasn't 
succumbed to any of the obvious traps of stardom, hasn't gone on TV to 
sell you a Chrysler or gone to Hollywood to make bad movies, hasn't 
gotten fat and old. Most of all, he hasn't dumped on his fans the way 
Elvis did, put out trash so sloppy and worthless that it becomes an 
absurd, perverse joke.<br>
<br>
Tunnel of Love is a finely crafted album, careful, cautious, lyrically 
brilliant in places. But its caution, possibly Springsteen's response to
 his own success, may also signal the beginning of the end.</div>

<br>
DENVER POST<br>
<br>
 The Bottom Line Bruce puts energy and committment in his performances. You will always get your money's worth. <br>
<br>
Ditching the Born In The USA days, scruffy blue-collar muscle shirt 
personna for a black suit, bolo string tie and a crisp white shirt, New 
Jersey rocker Bruce Springsteen put on a riveting performance with the 
Tunnel of Love tour that literally shook Denver, CO on April 20, 1988. 
It was an intense, rousing 3-hour mega performance super-enhanced with a
 dynamic 5-piece horn section, a Jersey bar band, La Bamba and the 
Hubcaps. This horn section was new, and it was a thrilling musical 
treat. Periodically, they popped on the stage and their stage presence 
was a powerful addition. <br>
<br>
Thankfully, this is an indoor arena at the now demolished McNichols 
Arena; the ecstatic sound vibrated the huge arena with great acoustics. 
It was loud and at times thunderous! Springsteen makes you feel his 
energy and stage presence. The arena was packed, the stage was set with 
lighting that ranged from dark and somber to light and bright. Taking a 
different approach to his standards with “the love tour”, it was still 
Bruce. <br>
<br>
Tunnel of Love is dark! <br>
The opening was unusual, the band members strolling onto a carnival 
booth. The theme of this concert was love, just plain romantic love, and
 a departure from his usual blue-collar road warrior, he is so famous 
for. <br>
<br>
It’s all about relationships, as he said, "the CD is a reflection of the
 doubts and fears and mistakes that most people will experience in a 
real relationship." Bruce also comments that "man meets woman and they 
fall in love, but the house is haunted and the ridge gets rough." And 
love songs they were, including the sensual and lusty I’m on Fire ...hey
 little girl is your daddy home...did he go an leave you all alone.. ohh
 ohh ohhh I’m on Fire. The intro to that song is memorable while the 
song is soft as a man aches for a woman. Included in that love theme was
 the hit One Step Up. <br>
<br>
Bruce launched the first half with the dark theme of romantic tunes. 
When he crooned the beautiful Tougher Than The Rest, and band member 
Patti Scialfa  joined him, you couldn’t miss the chemistry between the 
two. A romantic song with his raspy voice...somebody left somebody’s 
heart in a mess, so if you’re looking for love, baby, I’m tougher than 
the rest.   Ms Scialfa  was stunning with her flaming red hair captured 
in the spotlight. She wore a tiny black mini skirt with little boots. <br>
<br>
Another love song Bruce says is about a woman struggling to understand 
her value of her own independent existence the value of life of her 
child down the road. Spare Parts, is about parts of her past that are 
keeping her down trying to find something new and beautiful and meanful 
in her life today. It’s not a slow ballad, it has energy. <br>
<br>
Springsteen kicked  off the second set with some raucous 60’s oldies, 
Devil with a Blue Dress, Good Golly Miss Molly, and Sweet Soul Music. He
 brought the audience out of the darken tunnel. It was nonstop musical 
hype. He added Glory Days and the ever popular 70’s Rosalita. These 
performances were so emotionally vigorous they were exhausting to watch!
 It seemed like he was playing forever with these classics, they were 
long songs, and he did this one justice. Bruce responds wild for the 
crowd, he’s sweaty and wet. And what a treat this was with the 
enhancement of musical sounds by the 5-piece horn section joining in for
 several songs. <br>
<br>
I never did like War..what is it good for..absolutely nothing. I still don't like it even if Bruce recorded and sang it! <br>
<br>
Acoustic version of Born to Run <br>
Cranking out the hits too, Bruce with his guitar and harmonica did an 
acoustic on Born to Run, which is normally a wild fast song. From Hungry
 Heart to Born in the USA, and oh the crowd loves that sing-along verse 
from Hungry Heart, got a wife and kids in Baltimore Jack..I went out for
 a ride and never came back.... Bruce always includes the audience on 
this one. <br>
<br>
There hasn’t been a performance by Springsteen that would duplicate the 
power this concert projected. It was emotional, exciting, fun and 
included some fantastic songs!</div>
