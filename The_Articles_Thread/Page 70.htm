<br>
The album collection –PART 1<br>
<br>
BY MIMI DENT<br>
19 June 201<br>
<br>
POP MATTERS</strong></span><br>
<br>
Who is this artist, Bruce Springsteen? How should his work be judged, 
and what’s to be made of it? The final stretch of 2014 brought legacy 
releases from him and others that may make finding answers to these 
questions more interesting, if not necessarily any easier, given the 
nature of the musicians at hand, the sounds they’ve produced, and the 
roles they’ve played in culture.<br>
<br>
<br>
The comparisons Springsteen faces have frequently been to Bob Dylan. 
This was and still is misguided. The newly definitive edition of The 
Basement Tapes, casual fragments bracketed on both ends by Dylan’s most 
compelling work, shows this in spades. Once surreptitiously bootlegged 
as The Great White Wonder and always heard as a spiritual embodiment of 
colloquial American tradition, nothing else near the genres upon which 
these bootlegs riff on even come close to it. (Unless, of course, one 
goes straight to the source, and that’s of another matter entirely.) 
Dylan is indisputably first after those who had truly come first, and 
the transformation he underwent through a gnostic wrangle with musical 
logic, with the Band at his side and on equal footing, is as tangled as 
it gets. Fitting given their apocryphal legend, The Basement Tapes are 
Alpha and Omega, covering all that between. Dylan might recognize the 
word for this middle ground as ehmet. What he experienced there and 
returned with irrevocably changed him, and there’s a profound message to
 be heard in The Basement Tapes if one is willing to listen.<br>
<br>
Springsteen has always been more Catholic in his tastes, once finding a 
motherlode of inspiration in homegrown garage mayhem, shlocky 
monster-mash dramaturgy, and mock-heroic teen anthems, the latter being 
the music of his youth heard on the radio.<br>
<br>
Accordingly, his primary sources were openly mercantile rather than 
strictly vernacular, and this is where he and Dylan have always differed
 in applying the ethos common to their trade as song-and-dance men. It’s
 a pivotal point that’s nearly lost today, where artists roll in the hay
 with software companies and coyly cock-block digital streaming services
 to better position their product, and is therefore almost impossible to
 make. To Springsteen’s everlasting credit, there was an infectious joy 
found in his love for those nearly forgotten tunes that his willful 
earnestness could never quite efface. It’s rarely heard in the artist’s 
late work, shackled as it is to broadly generic themes like “dreams” and
 “hope” that unduly circumscribe the expressive options upon which he 
may draw, where a fustian kind of therapeutic holy activism gamely 
masquerades as spectacular arena rock.<br>
<br>
Was it always like this? Given the immense shadow Dylan cast, it was 
nigh impossible to strip the hype from Springteen’s earliest recorded 
efforts and gauge the music on its merits unless, as lore attests, one 
caught him live. With Springsteen, this is where the essential was 
always glimpsed. Given his impeccable showmanship and the milieu from 
which it sprung, today it may abruptly dawn on any discerning listener 
that Springsteen’s closest peer is and has always been another 
undisputed master of dazzling stagecraft: David Bowie.<br>
<br>
<br>
If this comparison once seemed counterintuitive, by now it should be 
quite clear. The two have always warily admired one another from a 
distance, since their first meeting at Sigma Studio in Philadelphia, 
where Bowie was laying down the limey R&amp;B pulp that would become 
Young Americans. Following on the heels of the release of Dylan’s 
complete Basement sessions in 2014, December 2014 retrospective sets 
from both Springsteen and Bowie further elucidate their affinities. The 
two are unquestionably among the greatest heirs to Dylan’s achievement, 
yet for their strong similarities Springsteen ultimately differs from 
Bowie in subtly crucial ways that are performative, affective, and 
ultimately symbolic.<br>
<br>
Bowie reflects on fifty years of artistry with his new career 
compilation, Nothing Has Changed, a slyly formatted three-version 
offering which includes various remixes along with bonus tracks. Each of
 the three editions of the album highlight the glamourous snarl, plastic
 soul, and remorseless chill that have always animated his gambit as the
 quintessential postmodern Übermensch. One of the set’s three sleeves 
portrays him before his dressing mirror as an elegantly tailored 
beneficiary of the Third Way, reserved, self-possessed, perhaps bemused,
 and with an unsettling blind spot predominant behind the artist’s 
flawlessly combed head. It’s a fatally honest portrait, and utterly 
disarming in its putative sincerity, something of which Springsteen 
knows much.<br>
<br>
Unlike that of Ziggy, the Thin White Duke, or the Man Who Fell to Earth,
 the Springsteen artifice hasn’t been built upon avant-garde role play 
or the tempering of immaculately forged technique into tenebrously 
enigmatic cunning, the cynically winking ruse, the wryly knowing 
conceit. All signs point to quite the opposite. Nonetheless, 
Springsteen’s 42-year run has been as blocked as a Sunday matinee, 
presenting a figure of authenticity upon which the perception of his 
constructed persona as humble, hardworking Everyman has always depended.<br>
<br>
Do insinuations of Machiavellian influence lurk behind the proscenium of
 this production? Since Springsteen’s heralded breakthrough in 1975 they
 have and do, but those objections don’t much pertain to the 
machinations of simply getting things done, the de facto dogma of 
neoliberalism, the economic regime under which the Springsteen outfit 
has earned its keep. This past year alone, the famiglia known in fan 
circles as Bruce Inc did its job well, and reaped more wheat than there 
is in Kansas. Indeed, take these words to heart: pay no attention to the
 man behind the curtain. Springsteen himself has admonished his admirers
 as much of late. This said, there’s likely no better chronicle of 
deskilling and its social ravages than the one he’ll leave to a nation 
decimated by the sleight of hand endemic to those policies.<br>
<br>
So where is focus directed? Towards the figure in the world? Towards the
 artist’s status in society? Or towards the blunt facticity of the art? 
The art forms the foundation upon which a legacy rests, and how a 
reputation will one day be judged. The art and its magic, which is the 
significant, meaningful part, must bear this kind of scrutiny. 
Spectatorship and posterity guarantee this, something of which Bowie has
 always had a brilliant grasp and which Dylan understood long before 
anyone else had a glimmer of avowal. Yet in Springsteen’s case, cardinal
 discrepancies have shaped the work from the beginning, complicating its
 form, its reception, and most tellingly, its meaning.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s new box set presents his first seven remastered LPs in the
 starkest terms possible. Bruce Springsteen: The Album Collection: Vol 
1, 1973-1984 offers no alternatives or embellishment to its content, and
 appears assembled with the intention of dispelling any lingering 
skepticism about the artist’s current place while obliquely assessing 
his future. In this sense, and against all logic, it doesn’t look back.<br>
<br>
This volume rightly frames Springsteen during his classic period as a 
principled artist who increasingly spoke only when he had something to 
say, in terms that were fiercely his own and not easily lent to others. 
This was the self-professed samurai code which informed the isolation of
 Darkness on the Edge of Town and the promise that it held, but the peak
 of this mindset came with the bleeding emotional candor on display at 
“The Night for Veterans” in 1981, with Springsteen and the E Street Band
 on tour in support of The River.<br>
<br>
While the premise behind the show was of negligible risk following the 
box office victories of Michael Cimino’s The Deer Hunter and Hal Ashby’s
 Coming Home, that bonafide gesture of empathetic solidarity from a 
critically lauded cult figure shared with those still thanklessly cast 
as a nation’s pariahs laid the foundation for the visionary lo-fi pathos
 of Nebraska, and for the massive commercial coup of Born in the USA. 
The boldly calculated moves of those two successive LPs by an artist in 
complete command of his metier eventually left an iconic Springsteen, by
 the wrap of his red, white, and blue blockbuster USA tour, arguably the
 second-biggest pop star in the world, precariously untethered from both
 his life and his art, and by his own weary description: “Bruced out”.<br>
<br>
The structural underpinnings of this identity crisis were to be found in
 the ‘70s, but it took ten years for them to fully surface before being 
promptly elided by the artist’s tremendous, sudden celebrity. The seven 
albums of this Album Collection, taken as a whole, thus mask a conflict 
Springsteen labored mightily to resolve as he sought a mature voice. 
When signed to Columbia by John Hammond, Springsteen was a 
preternaturally gifted beach bum, and perhaps the most driven raw genius
 to ever pick up a guitar, one whose terrific ambition away from his 
natural home on the boards often threatened to swamp his alienated 
monomania in the studio. In disingenuously accepting to oversee the 
career of a scruffy solo act who also played killer music with a pesky 
hangdog band, Rolling Stone critic and Born to Run co-producer Jon 
Landau recognized a mercenary opportunity to further his interests by 
stoking the narcissistic insecurities of a provincial autodidact. In the
 process, he took the artist under his learned wing, flattering 
Springsteen into believing that big was important, important was 
serious, and serious was scarce.<br>
<br>
<br>
Without doubt, by 1978 it was the newly appointed manager’s imperative 
to impress upon his client that it was him, Springsteen, above all, that
 was most important. Given time, the columns didn’t lie, yet they 
obscured a deeper reality far from a solely statistical truth: 
Springsteen was absolutely incomparable and at his unabashed best 
fronting the indispensable group he led. This fact that has never really
 come through on his records, even as a celebrated slew of pirated live 
leads one to question why that is the case. Eventually, the strategy 
Landau devised to promote Springsteen as a uniquely worthy musician of 
individual knack ultimately splintered what may have been the best act 
to ever simply plug in and play. This served the artist badly in the 
creative long term, when admittedly wanting it all quickly became 
scarcely enough.<br>
<br>
The serious problem with that desire and the means available to fulfill 
it is that there’s always more to be had. Perhaps it’s easy to blame the
 pernicious influence of another ‘80s phenomenon, MTV, and the undue 
pressure the network exerted on artists to hew to its formula. The MTV 
model is one that leveraged a distinctly fabricated style in its 
capricious arbitration of taste, with novelty exponentially factoring 
the rewards promised. If this somehow looks like two steps sideways 
around the ‘50s scandal of payola, with those involved at each level 
equally complicit, then in hindsight it’s certain that for all of 
Springsteen’s winning charisma and dogged intensity, he wasn’t 
particularly well-suited for the short-form promotional video.<br>
<br>
The MTV music video format served to polish a one-dimensional image of 
the artist dimly held in the mainstream imagination to this day, casting
 Springsteen as a corporate character always “playing Springsteen” in 
some fashion from that moment forward, with the distilled complexities 
of his band adroitly blended into a smoothly synthetic brand. This may 
be where Springsteen handily matched Bowie, and perhaps even bested him 
at his own game by enacting a critique that doubled the thing being 
critiqued.<br>
<br>
To wit, the Boss, always a dubious moniker which Springsteen himself 
allegedly hated, chose at that professionally challenging juncture in 
1984 to become completely inauthentic, ostensibly in order to be seen 
as, well, “authentic”. If expressive of the zeitgeist, with actor Ronald
 Reagan in the White House and attempts to co-opt Springsteen’s 
visibility for political gain the depressing norm, there was a hefty 
price to be paid for this manufactured mass appeal. Something vital of 
his art, the pure E Street profile, the lightning in the bottle, was 
exchanged for wider recognition. It was exactly this dilemma that pushed
 long-time consigliere, guitarist and co-producer Steven Van Zandt, into
 the street on the eve of the band’s biggest payday, and into a 
grass-roots global activism. Always deeply self-directed, and apropos of
 this paradox, Springsteen later asked with faux-messianic aplomb, why 
cross the desert and not climb the mountain? Following its client, Bruce
 Inc. ascended beyond the management of a mere rock and roll star into 
the more rarefied air seemingly beyond both art and politics.<br>
<br>
That rhetorical question Springsteen posed about what he’d once quipped 
was his “vocation” shouldn’t pass without comment in any assessment of 
the artist’s career. At the very least, it’s one freighted with the 
Elvis Presley obsessions that have preoccupied him and entertainers like
 Dylan and Bowie for the bulk of their creative lives. Springsteen 
couldn’t imagine anyone not wanting to be Presley. While fantastically 
rich but not quite the King, what became increasingly dicey for Bruce 
Inc following Springsteen’s superstar close-up was that their client 
held an uncontested spot atop an industry heap soon set to crumble. 
Since releasing the introspective masterpiece Tunnel of Love in 1987, an
 album strangely deemed outside the purview of this survey despite 
containing his most devastating writing, Springsteen has incessantly 
gambled with his ability to conjure any convincingly original territory 
between the expansive and the intimate. This is where one finds the 
dynamic tension, or as the purported “New Dylan” manqué put it early on,
 the recklessly defiant affirmation of sheer blinding fun, that even in 
its bleakest moments has always animated his triumphantly best work, 
where better days always seemed to beckon.<br>
<br>
In 2014, by taking a long view and presenting these seven albums as the 
initial volume in a presumed series, Springsteen plays it forward by 
offering possibilities to hear them afresh. It’s pressing we do so, and 
they couldn’t have arrived sooner. As much as could be said for all Vol.
 1 has to recommend it, the music Springsteen made in those eleven 
years, and this is but a slight fraction he’s chosen to release over his
 storied run, has kept a fragile secret close to the author’s vest. 
While deeply nostalgic, these LPs reckon with a time when the present 
hadn’t yet slipped into the past, and a wild diversity of sounds 
coexisted as one very big sound, perhaps one of the biggest ever made by
 humankind in its history.<br>
<br>
Addressing the relationship of popularity to populism, or more 
accurately, that of the common to the communal, in both personal and 
political terms, have always been at the core of Springsteen’s concerns.
 With this in mind, these are fundamentally records of voices, his and 
those of countless others, with the music designed in its stunningly 
magnificent complexity to rival the great hits of the mythic ‘60s. If 
Springsteen has any regret, it may only be he made it to the party a bit
 late, but this is unlikely. The sounds he’s made are unforgettable. 
Written with an unwavering commitment, sung with a stylish assurance, 
and performed almost to a fault with a shit-hot band, Springsteen’s best
 songs here are brashly celebratory yet rife with restless dread, 
haunted by specters which have stalked this land since its birth and 
with whom we each must find our peace.<br>
<br>
The album most evocative of that intuition, The River, cuts a great 
sonic swath through the set, carrying its metaphors forward in the grand
 sweeping arc of tradition founded by the ancients, making it impossible
 to be heard the same way twice. There’s a prescience in the wisdom of 
this gift that’s beyond compare, which is how this music deserves to be 
heard, at its most profoundly elemental and its most ecstatic, beside 
ourselves and out of our heads, where the everyday turns round and 
begins to fade away before us—just so, but not quite yet.<br>
***<br>
A new archival series of concert recordings aims to rectify live albums 
long overlooked by a casual audience. One of the first to garner 
attention, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band: The Agora Cleveland 
1978, is a remastered set selected from a legendary tour rightly 
cherished by hardcore followers. Superlatives aside, this is a historic 
performance, not the least due to the clubby “you are there” quality 
that comes across in its hearing even today.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:200%;line-height:116%"><strong class="text-strong"><br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN AND THE E STREET BAND: THE AGORA CLEVELAND 1978<br>
(SELF-RELEASED)<br>
US: 24 DEC 2014<br>
UK: 24 DEC 2014</strong></span><br>
<br>
Frequently bootlegged for years, the date is part of a holy trinity of 
bang-up Cleveland moment, the first being Alan Freed’s “Moondog 
Corporation Ball”, universally recognized as the world’s first rock ‘n’ 
roll concert, with the second being the infamous “Beer Night” riot at 
the old Municipal Stadium, where Texas Rangers manager Billy Martin 
grabbed a fungo bat and went mano-a-mano against a few thousand 
fractious Tribe fans. Conceived as an exultant one-off, Springsteen’s 
appearance at Hank LoConti’s legendary venue uncannily reflected the 
attitude of the city at that specific juncture, before working-class 
aspirations went completely to shit and the Disneyfication of the 
post-industrial landscape commenced apace. No private party: No Bobby, 
no Jack, no Marty, no Warren in the house, no one but a fervent crowd of
 unruly blue-collar fans packed into a local bar with a blistering group
 headlining.<br>
<br>
The cymbal splash and cracking snare, the tambourine, and the chugging 
slapback riff of “Summertime Blues” announced the just intentions of an 
act enamored of their calling, with nothing to lose and mercilessly 
willing to prove it. The band and its audience were nearly out of 
control by the encores—“Willoughby sucks!”. The original radio broadcast
 was three hours of sweat and muscle and thunder and lightning, utter 
delirium going out over the airwaves to three million souls, thanks to 
the Kid and WMMS. While not exactly a dangerous gig, the potential for 
chaos among what was then still Springsteen’s familiar cohort is what 
distinguishes this performance as unique.<br>
<br>
That August evening on the cusp of autumn was when the artist sensed all
 wasn’t right with the Republic, and the wheels began coming off his 
imagination of the American carnivalesque, with those present sharing in
 his desperation and his fury. The fourth wall seriously buckled, as 
with punk, yet there was a magic in that night that made this show 
special. One doesn’t just hear it. Given a close listen, it can actually
 be felt, not just in the music, but also in its reception.<br>
<br>
What exactly is that “it”? Can’t say for sure, but The Agora, Cleveland 
1978 is mysteriously righteous in ways unlike any show of its time, or 
any other since.</div>

WIDENER NEWS<br>
<br>
By Dan Hanson<br>
</strong><br>
</span><br>
The Widener student working the door to the Bruce Springsteen and the E 
Street Band show on a freezing February night in 1975 looked quizzically
 at Michael Turner when he presented his $6 ticket.<br>
<br>
<br>
"What's that?" the student asked, his gaze fixed on the large case slung over Turner's shoulder.<br>
<br>
Turner didn't miss a beat. "I have a breathing problem and this is a portable iron lung," he said.<br>
<br>
Either satisfied with Turner's answer or too cold to inquire further, 
the student took Turner's and his friend Jeff Audet's tickets and waved 
them through the entrance to the Schwartz Athletic Center field house.<br>
<br>
Turner and Audet didn't know it at the time, but their "portable iron 
lung"—actually Audet's Sony Portapak video camera and reel-to-reel video
 recorder—would record some of the earliest and rarest concert footage 
of Springsteen, a New Jersey rocker with a strong regional following 
poised to become a music industry icon.<br>
<br>
Springsteen played three Widener concerts—one on April 5, 1974, and 
consecutive nights on February 6 and 7, 1975—before his Born to Run 
album launched him to superstardom and landed him on the covers of both 
TIME and Newsweek in October 1975. Video Turner and Audet shot of the 
first 1975 show became a hot commodity on the bootleg music market for 
years, first on VHS and then on DVD, before gaining a worldwide audience
 on YouTube. "We didn't know it would be a piece of Springsteen 
history," said Turner, who grew up in Broomall, Pennsylvania, and was 
attending Temple University when he and Audet recorded the concert. "We 
would show the video at parties in my parents' recreation room, hang 
out, and drink beer. We just thought it was pretty cool to have this 
thing."<br>
<br>
Glory Days<br>
<br>
Vivid images of Springsteen's shows also live in the heads of Widener 
alumni who attended the concert as students almost 40 years ago. New 
Jersey-native Anthony Zizos '75 was accustomed to seeing Springsteen 
play at the Jersey Shore prior to his rise in popularity. "It was as if 
he followed me to college, bearing comfortable memories of my high 
school days," Zizos wrote. "The indoor track was packed that night with a
 crowd so electrified it rivaled the Saturday afternoon rousing crowds 
watching the magic of Billy Johnson, Richie Weaver, and the PMC drill 
team on the football field behind Old Main. That concert was amazing!"<br>
<br>
Paul Shandelman '79 was lucky to have a roommate, Ron Siarnicki, who 
worked behind the scenes at the field house and had backstage access. 
Siarnicki recruited Shandelman to help with concert preparations, and he
 got to meet Springsteen in person. "I asked for his autograph, but all 
we had was a magic marker," Shandelman said. "Springsteen's piano player
 lifted my shirt and drew two eyes and a face, and Springsteen signed 
it, 'Nice belly, Bruce Springsteen.' It was pretty awesome."<br>
<br>
As a photographer for the Widener yearbook, Daniel Upton '75 had a pass 
to photograph the concert, and took the images that appeared in the 
yearbook and in this magazine. "I was there with my future wife, Jean, 
and remember it being a good show with a very energetic crowd," Upton 
said. "He's a great entertainer, musician, and poet."<br>
<br>
And Mark J. Luongo '78 remembers moving into his dorm as a freshman in 
fall 1974 and seeing posters for Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. 
plastered on walls and doors. "I recall asking myself what was the fuss 
over this guy named Springsteen," Luongo said. "I remember going to the 
field house and sitting on the track covered with a huge rubber sheet 
and waiting for this show to begin. Then one of the biggest people I had
 ever seen came out and started playing a saxophone, and that's how I 
was introduced to Clarence Clemons. Then this little, greasy guy hops 
out on stage, and the energy was phenomenal. I was mesmerized and came 
back for the next show. I have been a Boss fan ever since."<br>
<br>
Tracking "The Holy Grail" of Bruce Videos<br>
For many years, the identity of who recorded the Widener concert footage
 was unknown. Springsteen fans on the Internet speculated that the video
 was shot by Widener students with authorization from Springsteen's 
management.<br>
<br>
As a Springsteen fan and director of public relations at Widener, I set 
out to solve the mystery. I solicited information on the Widener 
Magazine blog, but the request yielded nothing. While reading comments 
left by viewers of the video on YouTube, I stumbled across a response to
 a comment that led me to Michael Turner.<br>
<br>
Turner said that he and Audet gave a copy of the reel-to-reel tape to a 
popular Philadelphia radio disc jockey, and they believe that's how it 
was distributed. Other than that, Turner and Audet made a handful of 
copies for friends and family with the advent of VHS video technology 
several years after the show.<br>
<br>
Now anyone can access the video. Go to YouTube.com and search 
"Springsteen Widener" and be transported 38 years back in time to 
February 6, 1975—three months before the release of Born to Run. Through
 a haze of smoke, Audet's video camera focuses on a 25-year-old 
Springsteen belting out favorites from his first two albums, Greetings 
from Asbury Park, N.J. and The Wild, The Innocent, and the E-Street 
Shuffle. The grainy black-and-white image jumps, goes in and out of 
focus, and cheering concertgoers temporarily block the camera's view of 
the band.<br>
<br>
As the concert progresses, you are there with Turner and Audet, moving 
closer to the stage as they move closer with the camera. You hear 
familiar tunes from Born to Run as they are heard by many for the first 
time—including the title track and the song "Wings for Wheels," which 
would become "Thunder Road" on the album. Comments left by viewers of 
the concert footage on YouTube treat it as a rare archaeological find. 
"This is the Holy Grail of Boss performances," writes one. "This is like
 finding an early version of the Gettysburg Address. Priceless!" says 
another.<br>
<br>
The rarity of the video is unmistakable according to Erik Flannigan, a 
national expert on digital media and the senior editor of Backstreets, 
the official Springsteen fan magazine. "When it surfaced, it was a 
revelation," Flannigan said of the Widener concert footage. "Nobody had 
ever seen any footage of Springsteen from this era unless they attended 
those shows in person. In 1975, it was almost unthinkable that someone 
would sneak a video camera into a concert. They were almost the first 
ones to do it."<br>
<br>
When a documentary on Born to Run was released on the 30th anniversary 
of the album in 2005, Turner, as a devoted Springsteen fan, purchased a 
copy. Watching the documentary in his living room, he was blown away by 
what he saw. There, in all of its grainy, black-and white glory, was 
Turner and Audet's footage of the song Born to Run they shot at Widener.
 "I was flabbergasted," Turner said. "I had no knowledge that it would 
be on there."<br>
Turner said he doesn't know if the original half-inch reel-to-reel 
exists anymore. Even if he could find it and the video was worth big 
money, Turner said it probably wouldn't be for sale. "I'm not sure I 
would take money for it. I would rather donate it to Springsteen or the 
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame." He paused for a moment and added, "But I 
would take a couple of front row tickets to a Springsteen concert for 
it."<br>
<br>
Turner's and Audet's efforts to film the Springsteen show has allowed a 
younger generation of Springsteen fans, such as William Mikolajewski, a 
2011 graduate of Widener's School of Engineering, to connect with the 
legendary shows here. "I was not in attendance at this concert as I was 
not born yet, but I couldn't help but respond to how amazing this show 
was," Mikolajewski said. "The set list has to be one of Bruce's best. A 
show with 'Rosalita,' 'Born to Run,' 'Spirit in the Night,' and a 'Wings
 for Wheels' rendition is to be remembered for the ages. As a younger 
Bruce fan who has attended Widener, this show will always hold special 
meaning to me, and remain a frequent play on my iPod."</div>

How Bruce Got His Grove Back<br>
Radio.com<br>
August 3, 2015<br>
By Brian Ives <br>
<br>
“Whatever Happened To Bruce?”</strong><br>

So read the June 5, 1992 cover of Entertainment Weekly. The 
then-2-year-old magazine’s feature focused on the disappointing sales of
 Bruce Springsteen‘s simultaneously released Human Touch and Lucky Town 
albums, which had debuted at No. 2 and No. 3 on the Billboard charts, 
respectively, and plummeted from there.<br>
Keeping them out of the top slot? Def Leppard‘s Adrenalize, which came 
out the same day (March 31, 1992). A week later, Def Lep dropped from 
#1, but Bruce’s albums were again blocked, this time by Kris Kross, a 
hip-hop duo whose members weren’t yet born when Born To Run was 
released.<br>
<br>
Twenty-three years later, Bruce is widely regarded as a seminal 
influence on generations of younger rock and pop musicians; he is an 
example of someone who achieved an insane level of stardom while 
managing to never (or rarely) embarrass himself and his fans. A guy who 
can jam with Paul McCartney one night, and with a bar-band the next. An 
artist whose catalog is stocked with classic rock chestnuts, but who 
still gets our attention when he releases new music. A performer who 
could easily coast on his catalog at live shows, but instead challenges 
his band, crew and his audience every night, as if he still has 
something to prove.<br>
<br>
But back in ’92, he was singing about living “Better Days,” and who 
would begrudge him that—didn’t he deserve to enjoy his new family, and 
the spoils of his millions of albums sold? His domestic happiness, 
though, came a catch. After years of albums that were bona fide events 
for music fans, now Bruce’s records seemed more like the new releases 
from his middle-aged peers. At best, a collection of new songs to let 
you know that they’re still here; maybe one or two of those songs would 
hold up to the legacy, and would make it to the set lists. But by the 
’90s, many albums by classic rockers were simply centerpieces to a 
marketing campaign that were more about the tour than about new music; 
the songs would signal “bathroom break” to audiences.<br>
<br>
Less than a decade before EW‘s cover story, Springsteen stood, along 
with Michael Jackson, Madonna and Prince, as one of the biggest, most 
dominant, most relevant pop stars in the land. His 1984 album Born in 
the U.S.A. was a multi-format smash with multiple singles in high 
rotation on various radio formats, and several inescapable videos on 
MTV. Thirty (and thirty-one) summers ago, the album was unavoidable. On 
August 5, 1985, he kicked off his first stadium tour.<br>
<br>
What had changed in the subsequent seven years? EW speculated that 
Bruce’s aging audience were more domesticated than they used to be, and 
their priorities probably no longer included going out to buy records on
 release day (or even release week). Or, fans may have been disenchanted
 by their hero firing the E Street Band and ditching New Jersey for Los 
Angeles (living in the same exclusive neighborhood as Ronald Reagan, of 
all people). Or maybe – just maybe – that, as he found domestic bliss as
 a husband and father, he’d lost his fire as an artist. But there was 
another issue: the world was changing. It was hard to see where 
Springsteen fit within the pop mainstream of the ’90s: “New voices have 
arrived to shape pop’s agenda — on the conservative side, country 
voices,” EW pointed out. This was, after all, the era of Garth, Wynonna,
 Reba and Clint. “And out on the edge, the younger, sharper, more 
insistently angry voices of militant rappers and rock bands like Nirvana
 and Metallica.”<br>
<br>
In the summer of 1992, rock and roll was alive and well. It was just a 
very different rock and roll landscape than the one the Springsteen had 
conquered in the ’70s and ’80s. The Lollapalooza tour, in its second 
year, had the zeitgeist firmly in it’s newly tattooed hand: headlined by
 the Red Hot Chili Peppers, it also featured Ice Cube, Soundgarden and 
Pearl Jam; it would be hard to imagine Springsteen finding any common 
ground with the fans filling the furious, dusty, muddy moshpits that 
broke out when those artists performed. 1992’s biggest tour was by 
Springsteen superfans U2, but their Achtung Baby album and tour seemed 
to shed their Americana (and Springsteen) influences for much more 
European and industrial fare. In the ’80s, U2 often used roots rockers 
Lone Justice as an opening act . This time it was the Pixies, the 
Sugarcubes, Primus and Public Enemy. (Oddly enough, Shane Fontayne, 
formerly the guitarist in Lone Justice, was now in Springsteen’s touring
 band.)<br>
<br>
Another huge tour that summer featured the union of hard rock and metal 
powerhouses Guns N Roses and Metallica, who were co-headlining stadiums.
 In fact, when that tour hit New Jersey for a two night stand at Giants 
Stadium, Springsteen’s tour was in the midst of an eleven night 
residency at the Brendan Byrne Arena, right across the highway. The 
arena had a huge “Welcome Home, Bruce” banner draped across its roof, 
which GNR/Metallica opener Faith No More‘s frontman Mike Patton mocked 
from the stage. Later on, Metallica’s James Hetfield chuckled from the 
stage, “Welcome home, Bruce,” to jeers. Springsteen was being mocked by a
 younger, angrier audience, right in his backyard.<br>
<br>
Soon after the EW story, the more Bruce-friendly Rolling Stone did their
 cover story on him, in which he confessed, “I really enjoyed the 
success of Born in the U.S.A., but by the end of that whole thing, I 
just kind of felt ‘Bruced’ out.” It seemed that younger generations – 
and younger musicians – were “Bruced” out too.<br>
<br>
Chris Phillips spends as much time as anyone thinking about Springsteen:
 he’s the editor of Backstreets, the best Springsteen site on the web 
(he’s even interviewed the man himself on more than one occasion). He 
tells Radio.com, “When you have the global success that he had, being so
 overexposed, that tends to take a lot of ‘coolness’ away, no matter who
 you are. I think that happened to the Nth degree with Bruce. Also, the 
macho ‘Rah! Rah! U.S.A!’ imagery that was associated with Bruce—even 
though it was inaccurate—might have turned a lot of people off.”<br>
<br>
Future Springsteen collaborator Tom Morello echoed that sentiment in 
this 2010 interview: “I was kind of off-put by the promotional blitz 
surrounding the Born in the U.S.A. record,” he said, noting that it 
would take a few years for him to realize that Springsteen had a lot in 
common with his favorite artist, Clash frontman Joe Strummer (who was, 
himself, a Springsteen fan). In the same roundtable interview, New 
Jersey singer/songwriter Pete Yorn (who has covered a number of 
Springsteen songs, including “Dancing in the Dark,” “Your Own Worst 
Enemy” and “NYC Serenade”) shared a similar experience: he said that, 
like Morello, he was a metal fan during the mid-’80s. “I was kind of 
turned off: he was so popular and he was so close to home, and I was 
just not interested for some reason.” Years later, in college, he became
 a fan.<br>
Springsteen has said that Born in the U.S.A.‘s follow-up, Tunnel of 
Love, was an attempt to reintroduce himself in a “non-iconic” way. Which
 was fitting, as much of the album focused on the unravelling of his 
marriage; he’d soon divorce first wife Julianne Phillips. Human Touch 
and Lucky Town humanized him even more: “Local Hero” made fun of his 
iconic status; “57 Channels (and Nothin’ On)” showed that, hey, he 
watches TV too, just like us! And, in “Souls of the Departed,” he sang 
about his reaction to violence in Compton, not too far from his new 
mansion: “Tonight as I tuck my own son in bed/All I can think of is what
 if it would’ve been him instead/I want to build me a wall so high 
nothing can burn it down/Right here on my own piece of dirty ground.” By
 ’92, Bruce was living in the mansion on the hill that he’d sung about a
 few years earlier on Nebraska; in “Souls of the Departed,” he was just 
being honest to acknowledge that he was living far, far away from the 
mean streets of L.A. If he wanted to build a wall around his home, it 
could happen after just a few phone calls and a meeting with the zoning 
board.<br>
<br>
The ’92 Rolling Stone interview posed the question to Springsteen: Do 
you think that a teenager who is into rap or heavy metal would be 
interested in your new albums? His response: “I don’t know… All I can do
 is put my music out there. I can’t contrive something that doesn’t feel
 honest. I don’t write demographically. I don’t write a song to reach 
these people or those people.” But he also admitted: “Of course, I’m 
interested in having a young audience. I’m interested in whoever’s 
interested in what I’m doing. And what I have to say is ‘This is how 
I’ve grown up. Maybe this will have some value. These are the places 
I’ve been, and these are the things I’ve learned.'”<br>
<br>
But it seemed that, at that point in time, most young people weren’t 
interested in the places Springsteen had been, or in the things he 
learned. His tour with the so-called “Other Band” [whom he hired for his
 first post-E Street tour] did well in New Jersey, but he wasn’t selling
 as many tickets as he had on prior tours. The tour – and the “Other 
Band” itself – was history by mid-’93. At the end of the year, he 
surfaced with a new song, sporting a very new sound, based around drum 
loops, samples and synthesizers. “Streets of Philadelphia,” from the Tom
 Hanks/Denzel Washington film Philadelphia, reminded the world that 
Springsteen could still tackle big topics. Backstreets‘ Phillips says 
that “Streets of Philadelphia” marked a turning point in Springsteen’s 
public perception: “He was identifying with the issues that mattered to 
young people. You could probably point to that as the beginning of the 
road back to Bruce’s status as cool elder statesman.”<br>
Springsteen was rewarded for his efforts with an Oscar and four GRAMMYs.
 Some artists would have taken the hint and delivered more of the same: 
indeed, Springsteen recorded an entire album of material based on 
samples and loops, but only “Missing” (from the 1995 film The Crossing 
Guard) has been released.<br>
<br>
He adopted a less modern sound for 1995’s The Ghost of Tom Joad. He was 
returning to the tackling of “big ideas,” but minus the iconic imagery 
and anthems of the Born In The U.S.A. era. Springsteen may have been 
recalling an argument he’d had with ex-E Street Band guitarist and 
consigliere Steven Van Zandt years earlier, during the making of 1987’s 
Tunnel of Love. As Van Zandt told the New Yorker, after hearing Bruce’s 
comical autobiographical song “Ain’t Got You,” “We had one of our 
biggest fights of our lives. I’m like, ‘This is bull***t. People don’t 
need you talking about your life. Nobody gives a s*** about your life. 
They need you for their lives. That’s your thing. Giving some logic and 
reason and sympathy and passion to this cold, fragmented, confusing 
world—that’s your gift. Explaining their lives to them. Their lives, not
 yours.’ And we fought and fought and fought and fought. He says ‘F*** 
you,’ I say ‘F*** you.’ I think something in what I said probably 
resonated.”<br>
<br>
By 1995, he was again ready to address “their lives,” on what was the 
least commercial album of his career. Gone were the anthems of Born in 
the U.S.A. – he still wasn’t ready to return to that. But he was ready 
to return to tell the stories of the less fortunate, albeit in a more 
subtle, quieter way. As Mikal Gilmore said in his review of the album 
for Rolling Stone (giving it just three out of five stars), “Plaintive, 
bitter epiphanies like these are far removed from the sort of anthemic 
cries that once filled Springsteen’s music, but then, these are not 
times for anthems. These are times for lamentations, for measuring how 
much of the American promise has been broken or abandoned and how much 
of our future is transfigured into a vista of ruin. These are pitiless 
times.” And perhaps, therein lies a clue to Bruce Springsteen’s return 
to relevance.<br>
Two years later, in 1997, Morello’s Rage Against The Machine – then one 
of the most popular and credible rock bands in America – recorded a 
surprising cover of “The Ghost of Tom Joad.” Where Bruce’s original was a
 sorrowful rumination on how things haven’t changed much since the 
Depression, Rage’s take was a call to arms to fight against a world that
 allows anyone to “sleep on a pillow of solid rock.” It was a reminder 
of how powerful Springsteen’s lyrics were, when set to rock music 
(albeit rock music radically different than any he’d ever composed). It 
also recast him as an artist with something to say to a younger 
generation.<br>
<br>
Another thing happened in 1997 that isn’t as well remembered, but may 
have been significant. At the MTV Video Music Awards, Springsteen joined
 the Wallflowers – whose Bringing Down the Horse was one of the best 
selling albums of the year – for their hit “One Headlight.” It was the 
first time in a long time that a large audience saw Springsteen playing 
his iconic yellow Fender Telecaster, fronting a rock band and playing an
 anthem. Backstreets’ Phillips notes, “He looked great: I thought he 
blew Jakob Dylan off the stage. It was like, ‘Ah, that’s how it’s done. 
That’s a rock star.'”<br>
<br>
Springsteen spent much of 1998 in the studio, but he wasn’t working on 
new music. Instead, he allowed himself a look back, as he and a team of 
engineers went through a trove of tapes – hundreds of songs worth. They 
gave the songs proper mixes and then he pared down a 66 song list for a 
four CD box set of rarities, Tracks. By year’s end, the box set was in 
stores. And the (unsurprising) news was out that Bruce would be inducted
 into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in ’99. And then he announced a 
reunion tour with the E Street Band.<br>
<br>
When the induction came on March 15, 1999, it was Bono who had the task 
of doing the speech, and he didn’t disappoint. While U2’s latest album, 
Pop, didn’t show much Bruce influence (and its kitch factor lowered U2’s
 cultural cache quite a bit — they would later experience their own 
comeback in 2000) his speech reminded everyone why Springsteen was so 
beloved in the first place. “Bruce has played every bar in the USA, and 
every stadium,” he reminded the audience. “Credibility? You couldn’t 
have more, unless you were dead. But Bruce Springsteen, you always knew,
 was not gonna die stupid. He didn’t buy the mythology that screwed so 
many people. Instead, he created an alternate mythology – one where 
ordinary lives became extraordinary and heroic.” Back then, the 
induction ceremonies were held at the posh Waldorf Astoria in New York 
City. But as soon as the band kicked into the song that told the story 
of their legend – “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,” the high-rolling 
jewelry-rattling seen-it-all crowd were on their feet.<br>
<br>
Three days later, Springsteen and the E Street Band returned to the 
Jersey Shore to get back to work, for two public warm up shows at the 
Asbury Park Convention Center. Springsteen announced that the show was a
 “rebirth” and a “re-dedication of our band, and the job that we do, and
 the commitment to serve.” And those weren’t idle words. What could have
 been a well-deserved victory lap and nostalgia trip – which they’d have
 had every right to do – it truly was a re-dedication, and a committed 
one. Largely avoiding the hits from Born in the U.S.A., they stuck with 
their ’70s material – hits and album tracks – but also E Street-ized 
some of the more challenging ’90s material, notably “The Ghost of Tom 
Joad,” “If I Should Fall Behind” and “Youngstown,” as well as “Streets 
of Philadelphia.” There were also the never-before-performed songs from 
Tracks – “My Love Will Not Let You Down” opened many of the shows – as 
well as new ones. One of those was “Land of Hope and Dreams,” a song 
which still makes the encores today. The other was “American Skin (41 
Shots).”<br>
<br>
The latter song, of course, may well have been Springsteen’s most 
controversial. Premiered on June 4, 2000 in Atlanta, he played it at all
 ten nights at his closing string of shows at New York’s Madison Square 
Garden. The song was written about the February 1999 death of 22 year 
old African immigrant Amadou Diallo, shot by four plainclothes police 
officers. The officers were looking for a rapist said to be wandering in
 the Bronx, and called to Diallo who was walking to the doorway of his 
apartment building. An immigrant who had not been in America for long, 
he reached for his ID in his wallet; that would be normal procedure in 
his home country of Guinea. One or more of the police mistook this 
action, thinking he was reaching for a gun and 41 shots were fired, 19 
hitting him, wounding him mortally. However, the song’s lyrics were not 
completely a critique of the police: in fact, some of the lyrics, sung 
from the point of view of an officer, empathized with the impossible 
decisions that police need to make in a split second: “Is it a gun/is it
 a knife/is it a wallet/this is your life.” It’s one of the few songs – 
by any artist – that asks the listener to look through the eyes of a 
cop. Of course, many only saw insults in Springsteen’s song: New York’s 
State Fraternal Order of Police President, Bob Lucente, called 
Springsteen a “dirtbag” and a “floating fag.” Patrick Lynch, president 
of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, wrote a letter to PBA members
 calling for a boycott of Springsteen’s shows, saying, “I consider it an
 outrage that [Springsteen] would be trying to fatten his wallet by 
reopening the wounds of this tragic case at a time when police officers 
and community members are in a healing period.”<br>
<br>
Whatever side of that particular debate you may fall on, anyone would 
agree one thing: at that particular point in Bruce Springsteen’s career,
 he didn’t need to write such an overtly political song – one that 
addressed a highly emotional and polarizing story as it was still 
unfolding. And he certainly didn’t need to perform it, especially not at
 the world’s most famous arena, in the media center of the world. It 
certainly wasn’t “fattening his wallet” – all ten MSG shows had sold out
 far in advance, and he didn’t officially release the song for another 
year. Commercially, he would have been far better off playing one of the
 many hits that didn’t make the setlist on any given night. But just as 
he had told the story of blue collar workers in “Factory,” “The River,” 
and so many other songs; just as he told the story about a Vietnam vet 
in “Born in the U.S.A.,” in “American Skin (41 Shots),” he was telling 
the story of a police man and an immigrant trapped in a cycle of fear, 
racism and violence. Springsteen was indeed serious when he said that 
the band had been “reborn”: as the tour showed, the E Street Band could 
rock a party better than any other band in the land, but they could also
 tell the truths that are sometimes uncomfortable to hear.<br>
<br>
Craig Finn is the frontman of the Hold Steady, a band with a clear 
Springsteen influence (they’ve covered “Atlantic City”), and he told 
Radio.com that the tour had a big impact on him:  “When he came back 
with the E Street Band on the reunion tour… once you see him live you’re
 like, ‘S***!’ You know? There’s like all this stuff like Sonic Youth 
and Fugazi, that are great. But this is the best thing. This is 
literally the best thing. And I think just by showcasing that, he became
 undeniable.”<br>
Finn also noticed that Springsteen wasn’t simply preaching to the 
converted, he was actually doing some converting: “My girlfriend is 
younger than me; she thought he was kind of lame, so I took her to a 
concert, and after the show she said, ‘I know I didn’t like him before 
walking in, but now he’s my favorite artist of all time.’ That’s the 
power of his live show.”<br>
Patterson Hood leads the Drive-By Truckers, and is a longtime 
Springsteen fan (his band often covers “State Trooper”). He says that 
the reunion tour, and particularly the fact that Springsteen went out on
 a limb to play “American Skin (41 Shots)” at all ten New York shows, 
reminded him (and many others) that Springsteen was still a vital 
artist, willing to take risks. “I think he was probably surprised how 
much s*** he got for singing that. But he didn’t back down and I really 
applaud that. It had to be extremely unnerving for someone who has 
always played the role of the ‘good guy.’ That’s one of the things that 
sets him apart, he’s willing to do that. For someone like him, who 
speaks to millions and millions of people, to be willing to go there… we
 need more of that. We need more artists who have the balls to speak out
 about what they believe in.  He’s not just preaching to the converted: 
his audience cuts across all lines. I mean, God, Chris Christie’s a huge
 Springsteen fan! Even if he did fall asleep at a show, ha ha. There’s 
value in having a fan base that doesn’t all necessarily feel the same 
way that you do all the time.” Springsteen’s attitude has likely 
informed the Truckers’ career, as they are a proudly southern band with 
proudly progressive politics, and also have a large segment of their 
audience with whom they don’t see eye-to-eye, politically.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s gravitas was on display in the aftermath of another 
tragedy, a little over a year later. Ten days after 9/11, on September 
21, 2001, over 30 networks aired America: A Tribute to Heroes, a 
telethon to raise money for families of victims of the 9/11 attacks. 
Bruce opened the show with a somber but uplifting song that few had 
heard: “My City of Ruins.” A song originally written about Asbury Park 
before September 11, it took on a new meaning post-9/11 and became an 
instant classic among Bruce’s fans.<br>
<br>
That song would be recorded for Springsteen’s comeback album. The Rising
 served as his reunion album with the E Street Band and his rumination 
on the September 11 attacks. It paid tribute to the first responders 
(“Into the Fire”), attempted to console the families of the victims 
(“Lonesome Day,” “You’re Missing”), provided a rallying cry to move 
forward in the aftermath of horror (the title track) and even tried to 
understand what would lead someone to terrorism (“Paradise”). While some
 of the more immediate musical responses to 9/11 from his peers were a 
bit hamfisted (Paul McCartney’s “Freedom,” Neil Young’s “Let’s Roll,” 
Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Red, White and Blue”), The Rising had a sensitivity 
and nuance that most 9/11 songs lacked. It eschewed chest thumping for 
something a lot more difficult, and ultimately, more rewarding. (It’s 
interesting to note that Springsteen’s youngest child, Sam, graduated 
from firefighting academy last year.)<br>
“He was the absolutely perfect artist to speak about that and to sing 
about that and to write about that,” Hood says. “As a society, we sort 
of needed what he does, right at that time. It seemed like the time for 
him to come out and be that guy again. We kind of needed somebody in our
 culture to speak to us about that.”<br>
<br>
Backstreets’ Phillips adds, “It kind of spoke to the fact that art, at 
its best, can help us make sense of things that we struggle with, in a 
way that not much else can. There’s a lot of sort of difficult, dark 
stuff that Bruce touches on over the course of his career. The Rising 
was a real moment, doing something that very few people can do: making 
people feel better after a tragedy, and feel inspired.”<br>
<br>
Where Bruce’s not being able to fit in with the pop mainstream in the 
’90s was something of a hindrance to him, now it was an asset: what 
other musician could address what we had been through? NSYNC? P. Diddy? 
Britney? Avril? Tellingly, Bruce and the E Street Band opened the 2002 
MTV Video Music Awards; elder statemen rarely get booked on that show, 
especially if it isn’t as part of a collaboration with a younger artist;
 but Bruce’s new songs were starting to resonate with a new audience. 
Time magazine put him on the cover; in contrast to the Entertainment 
Weekly story from ’92, this one, nearly a decade later, read “Reborn in 
the U.S.A.” His tour for the album was massively successful, and he 
played about eight songs from the new album per night, to amazing 
response. This is no small point: by the turn of the millennium, there 
was no easy outlet for artists from Bruce’s era to get their new music 
played. As a result, legacy acts had a harder time getting any reaction 
when they tried to play new music at their concerts. But fans of varying
 ages were listening to The Rising, and it was addressing their lives at
 that moment, as Born to Run and Born in the U.S.A. had in previous 
decades.<br>
The Rising may have made amends with the audience that were off-put by 
“American Skin (41 Shots),” but during the tour, Springsteen reminded 
fans that he was becoming more and more politically progressive, and 
more comfortable talking about it. At sold-out stadium shows, he spoke 
to the audience each night, often around “My City of Ruins,” making a 
“public service message” (his term) to remind fans to keep an eye on 
what the government did in the name of “national security” (including 
the invasion of Iraq). This was an obvious criticism of President Bush, 
and was not always well-recieved. This writer attended no less than six 
stadium shows in the NY/NJ area in the summer and fall of 2003; for each
 “P.S.A.,” the stadium filled with a buzzing cacophony of cheers and 
boos that blended into an uncomfortable, nearly violent, roar. The 
following year, Springsteen took the E Street Band on a brief string of 
dates as part of “Vote for Change,” essentially an A-list tour that 
encouraged thousands of fans per night in swing states to vote for John 
Kerry. After the tour ended, he went on the campaign trail with Kerry, 
serving as the candidate’s opening act.<br>
Phillips recalls, “That tour was when he put his flag in the sand and 
really pissed a lot of people off. When he spoke about Bush, a whole 
bunch of people were up in arms. That tour was the most vitriol I saw at
 his shows.”<br>
But it didn’t turn everyone off: Hood says, “It made him more relevant 
to me. I was glad to see him talking about Bush. Of course I’m not gonna
 get mad about it, I couldn’t stand Bush. I still don’t like him!”<br>
Springsteen’s next projects veered a bit from the mainstream – 2005’s 
Tom Joad-like Devils and Dust and acoustic big-band rave up of 2006’s We
 Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions (the latter being a huge influence 
on one of the biggest rock bands of the past decade, Mumford &amp; Sons,
 as they told Rolling Stone in 2013).<br>
2007’s Magic, however, saw him back with the E Street Band in order to 
bring his message to the masses; that message was that he wasn’t happy, 
at all, with the direction that the country was going in after nearly 
two terms of the Bush administration. Around this time, he also endorsed
 Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, which didn’t help him with his 
own conservative fanbase, but they knew to expect this by now. It also 
may have endeared him to younger fans, whose vote powered Obama’s 
victory.<br>
When the E Street Band hit the road for the tour, Springsteen leaned 
heavily on Magic, and still offered a nightly politically progressive 
“public service announcement,” but not at the exclusion of giving the 
audience a good time. This was the tour where he began to take request 
signs from the audience. For young people experiencing their first 
Springsteen show, it would have been nothing like anything they’d seen, 
at least from an artist at that level of popularity. A frontman who puts
 his politics front and center, but also demands that everyone has a 
blast, no matter their political stripe, and to boot, leads a band who 
is seemingly had a limitless ability to play any song on command. It was
 also during this tour that Win Butler and Régine Chassagne of Arcade 
Fire joined Springsteen and the E Street Band on stage in Ottowa for his
 “State Trooper” (which they had been covering) and their own “Keep the 
Car Running.” (In this fan-shot video of the latter song, younger fans 
sound deliriously shocked that the E Street Band would take on the indie
 rock favorite.)<br>
<br>
Soon after, Springsteen and Butler shared the cover of an issue of Spin 
magazine, and sat for a joint interview; the writer Steve Kandell noted 
“A new generation of bands — of which Arcade Fire are certainly at the 
forefront — reveres him as much for his varied body of work as for the 
fact that he just seems to have done things the right way. Never 
embarrassed himself, never embarrassed those who look up to him.”<br>
2009 saw Springsteen reach out to new audiences in a way that he hadn’t 
for a long time: the year began with his performance at “We Are One,” 
President Obama’s inauguration celebration. A few weeks later on 
February 1, the E Street Band performed at Super Bowl XLIII  (allegedly 
after turning it down for years). He even made the (rare) misstep of 
offering an exclusive “Greatest Hits” album to Wallmart, seemingly an 
olive branch to middle American fans who might be reaquainted with him 
after the Halftime show. That annoyed his politically progressive fans, 
due to the fact that Wallmart’s record with organized labor  ran counter
 to Springsteen’s politics (they don’t recognize unions). And even then,
 he handled his error well, admitting to The New York Times “We didn’t 
vet it the way we usually do. We just dropped the ball on it. Given its 
labor history, it was something that if we’d thought about it a little 
longer, we’d have done something different. It was a mistake.” He added,
 rightfully so, “Our batting average is usually very good, but we missed
 that one. Fans will call you on that stuff, as it should be.”<br>
That year’s tour – for Working on a Dream – saw Springsteen reaching out
 to younger audiences via performances at large festivals, including 
Bonnaroo (where he jammed with Phish – a band with a decidedly different
 audience than his) and at England’s Hard Rock Calling (where he jammed 
with Gaslight Anthem, and Gaslight frontman Brian Fallon joined the E 
Street Band for their set).<br>
Around that time, a number of his fans paid tribute to him, via YouTube 
covers and testimonials, all of which were part of the “Hangin’ Out On E
 Street” series on Springsteen’s official YouTube channel: the Avett 
Brothers, Gaslight Anthem, Sara Bareilles, Ted Leo, Pete Yorn, Against 
Me!, Tegan and Sara, Mat Kearney and the Bouncing Souls were among those
 that who weighed in. A lineup quite so hip and current paying tribute 
to Springsteen would have been hard to imagine in the ’90s.<br>
Later that year, Springsteen was one of the recipients at the Kennedy 
Center Honors ceremony: tellingly, the tributes came from not just his 
peers (John Mellencamp and Sting) but younger artists who cited him as 
an influence: Ben Harper, Melissa Etheridge, Jennifer Nettles of 
Sugarland and even ’90s icon Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam (who had covered,
 and jammed with, Springsteen over the years). Also tellingly: two of 
the songs performed were from The Rising: Sting did the title track, 
while Vedder sang “My City of Ruins.” Bruce’s recent music was still an 
important part of his story.<br>
In 2013, the GRAMMYS feted Springsteen with their MusiCares Person of 
the Year Award (although they mostly snubbed his Wrecking Ball album at 
the GRAMMY Awards, giving him three nominations in the rock categories; 
he didn’t win any of them). Like the Kennedy Center, his peers were 
included, but the show also included younger artists, including some of 
the biggest hitmakers in country (Tim McGraw and Faith Hill performed 
together, Kenney Chesney and Zac Brown were also on the bill) and pop 
(John Legend, Mumford and Sons) as well as some edgier acts (Jim James 
of My Morning Jacket, Alabama Shakes and Ken Casey of punk rock legends 
Dropkick Murphys).<br>
<br>
Chris Cornell is the frontman of Soundgarden, a band who seemed to have 
little in common with Springsteen during the height of their popularity 
in the ’90s. (He’s also a former bandmate of Morello’s in Audioslave.) 
On his solo acoustic tours, he’s been known to cover “Atlantic City” and
 “State Trooper.” He told Radio.com that Springsteen’s return to the 
zeitgeist is no surprise: “I think there’s a natural cycle, it happened 
with Bob Dylan, it happened with Neil Young. No matter how influential 
you were, no matter how successful you were, that will be followed by a 
period where everyone rejects you. That’s the way it’s supposed to be. 
Whatever everyone agreed on, it has to also be what everyone later 
agrees to reject, at least for a while. And then, everyone grows up, and
 suddenly you’re not self-conscious about saying that you like Bruce 
Springsteen.”<br>
<br>
Tori Amos, another iconic ’90s artist, agrees with Cornell (she’s 
covered “I’m On Fire” and “Streets of Philadelphia”). “There’s always a 
place for a bard; Bruce Springsteen is a master storyteller. When you 
have somebody who can tell a story about anything, younger people will 
realize what he can do and what he possesses. You can’t just buy that at
 Guitar Center. You can practice your instrument all day long and not be
 that. Good for those bands who can see it in him.”<br>
Part of his appeal to a younger generation, though, is the fact that he 
still makes great albums, and that his shows raise the bar for all 
artists, regardless of age. Pete Yorn told Radio.com, “The guy’s just 
connected to some sort of freaking spirit. I try to strive for that 
myself. We all fight against the inertia of life and not wanting to go 
out and do stuff. And Bruce has this amazing energy. The fact that he’s 
still doing it on such an amazing level, while still putting out new 
music, is inspiring.”<br>
Amos adds, “He is a guiding light, he truly is. For anybody who says 
that ‘As you get older, surely you can’t beat what you did at 30’… I 
don’t know if you beat what you did at 30, but what you do now can hold 
up equally. He’s an example of that.”<br>
Phillips says, “From my standpoint, to watch artists feel like they can 
‘come out’ and say it and claim him as an influence has been great, and 
he’s now at a place where he’s beyond cool or uncool. It’s the place 
where Dylan sits, or Johnny Cash sits – eternal cool. So when the 
reviews for a record aren’t glowing, it’s not the end of the world. I 
don’t think you’re ever gonna get another magazine cover asking 
‘Whatever Happened to Bruce?'”<br>
Oh yeah, about that: it took just about two decades, but Entertainment 
Weekly admitted the error of their ways. The August 10, 2012 issue 
included a brief feature called “We Were Wrong,” which listed a few of  
examples “of our prognosticating skills gone horribly awry.” Among them:
 “The X-Files” (“This show’s a goner”), Jennifer Love Hewitt (”the 
odds-on favorite to become the next Molly Ringwald”), and yes, 
Springsteen. They recalled that they’d asked, ”Will he ever matter as 
much [again]?” Now we know the answer.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen, Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers: Max's Kansas City, New York NY<br>
Michael Watts, Melody Maker, 11 August 1973<br>
<br>
Wailers fail to catch afire</strong><br>
<br>
NEW YORK: I'd like to say that the Wailers were a fantastic success at 
their opening set at Max's but this wouldn't be strictly accurate; not 
because they weren't good, simply that reggae has not yet achieved any 
real momentum in America.<br>
<br>
Generally, The Harder They Come has not made much impact in the States, and neither has its star, Jimmy Cliff.<br>
<br>
It's been the reggae-orientation of Johnny Nash and the dabblings of 
such as Paul Simon and J. Geils which have registered Jamaican music, 
but only to the point where the general public thinks of it as a 
novelty.<br>
<br>
Thus, although the Wailers arrived fresh from an apparently triumphant 
residency in Boston, they found themselves playing to largely 
unconverted ears at Max's, and, with virtually no exception, white ears.<br>
<br>
To compound matters, most of the audience was there for Columbia's new 
rising star, Bruce Springsteen, While the seated policy of the club was 
hardly conducive to a natural, bodily response to what's essentially 
dance music.<br>
<br>
This is not to make too many apologies, however, for the Wailers, who 
were rather stiff for most of their set. In fact, Bob Marley sounded 
somewhat thin and unconvincing on lead vocals.<br>
<br>
In all truth, they didn't appear to be enjoying themselves, and this 
reserve held back their music, which if anything relies heavily on its 
infectiousness.<br>
<br>
There aren't many of us who aren't West Indians that have been exposed 
much to live reggae, so it's difficult to place the Wailers in a 
critical context. But, although it may be a little unfair to use them as
 a test case for a whole musical culture, they've made a lot of friends 
and alienated no-one. It's a start.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen has not only started, he's fully emerged within the 
space of four months. His first album resembled the manic outpourings of
 an autistic child, but there's never any doubt in my mind that he's an 
original talent. Those who've dismissed him have simply never seen him.<br>
<br>
He and his band — with more than a passing reference to the giant black 
tenorist, Clarence Clemmons — are the most voluble and exciting club act
 to have appeared this year.<br>
<br>
Springsteen, with his half-smiling, befuddled air, still sounds like 
he's spent time in a mental institution, but that impression only 
heightens the desperate, tumbled intensity of his performance.<br>
<br>
He plays spirited guitar on uptempo numbers, but he's more particularly 
effective on piano, where he employs his more reflective songs (there 
was an especially involving one about growing up in Asbury Park, N.J., 
where he lives).<br>
<br>
His lyrics are invariably oblique — hardly narrative — and he would 
benefit only by not straining after effect and crowding image upon 
image. As an artist he still hasn't defined himself, but when he's 
learned to discipline the neurotic impulse that forces him into a kind 
of absurd speed writing Without losing his fierce compulsiveness, he'll 
have something major to say.<br>
<br>
As it is, he's an arresting talent who expresses himself best live, 
where this jarring note is passed over in the physicality of the music. 
He's a lot of fun, too.<br>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Steve Van Zandt: Miami, Bruce, and Roots<br>
<br>
Harvey Kubernik, Melody Maker, <br>
<br>
November  6 1976</strong><br>
<br>
LOS ANGELES: Miami Steve Van Zandt has been in Bruce Springsteen's band 
for over a year now, and also finds time these days to guide the career 
of Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes.<br>
<br>
When I saw him in L.A. he was clad in a baggy white suit and matching 
loafers, along with a tam covering his curly brown hair. Dressed to 
kill, he resembled a big city pimp. A far cry from the puka shells in 
the audience at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium that night.<br>
<br>
Steve smiles when asked about the outstanding version of 'It's My Life',
 the Animals classic which has been worked up into a 20-minute 
mini-drama in Bruce's act.<br>
<br>
"That was at a soundcheck," he remembers. "When we do a soundcheck we 
jam and mess around on songs by the Four Tops, Marvin Gaye and the 
Sixties English things. 'It's My Life' started there. Bein' the 
brilliant cat he is, Bruce put that rap in which was so revealing.<br>
<br>
"We learned a lot on the Southern tour we Just did. We learned that Time
 and Newsweek cover stories are meaningless to people. These magazines 
make sense to the people who already know you or the small portion in 
big cities who respond to that. Down there it was very much Bruce who? 
It was especially rewarding when they were standing at the end."<br>
<br>
Some people were turned off by the hard-sell presentation of Bruce and 
the E Street gang as the greatest thing since sliced bread. Did Steve 
think the deserved hype turned off some potential fans?<br>
<br>
"I don't think it did anything except for the people who never saw the 
band live. Like Steve Stills, He said some pretty heavy things against 
us, and I know he never saw us in action. I ran into him and invited him
 down, and he didn't show.<br>
<br>
"Once somebody sees the band they can't possibly not like it. There's a 
difference between recording and the live situation. The albums give you
 a chance to know the songs and lyrics, and then that's expanded playing
 live.<br>
<br>
"It gives you a broader sense of who he is," he argues. "It would be kinda boring to see an identical record."<br>
<br>
From their last L.A. appearance at the Roxy, pianist Roy Bittan has 
worked with Bowie, tenorist Clarence Clemons has acted in New York, New 
York, the Martin Scorsese film, and Steve is heavily involved with the 
career of Southside Johnny. With all this alternative activity, the band
 are still thick as thieves.<br>
<br>
"Bruce is the best possible boss," he says, munching over a kosher dill.
 "He's hip enough to let everybody do their own thing, to express in 
other ways. All that does is make your gig better. When you go back to 
playing in the band it's like comin' home to foundation and security.<br>
<br>
"We look like we have fun on stage 'cause we do. Ninety-nine out of 100 
shows I enjoy as much as the audience. I think it shows up there. We're 
not playing baseball stadiums.<br>
<br>
"People aren't spectators, they're friends. The people stay with us. We 
have a real loyal following. In anybody else's case two years between 
albums would have been a disaster because Bruce Springsteen isn't a 
household word.<br>
<br>
"The people we play to don't like us – they love us. It comes from 
playing clubs and small theatres two years longer than the business 
would have suggested.<br>
<br>
"Small places have created this thing other bands seem to miss when they
 go for the bread and the 50,000-seaters. That's cool. It doesn't matter
 to me."<br>
<br>
Springsteen's is one of the few groups around today carrying on 
traditional rock and roll. "I don't wake up in the morning feeling I'm 
carrying on a tradition," Van Zandt smiles.<br>
<br>
"We're a roots rock group. We're conscious of it. I'm doing things not 
innovative, but we're always modernising the situation as much as 
possible. That's one of the reasons we use Jimmy Iovine as engineer. 
He's the best. A contemporary cat. We get a balance between us. If I had
 it my way we'd do the records in mono," he laughs.<br>
<br>
"I think it's a prerequisite that it's derivative. It's obvious where it
 comes from. I just worry it will be considered a throwback or an oldie.
 These words scare me.<br>
<br>
"I go home and someone puts on the new Peter Frampton album, and I then 
put Sam &amp; Dave's Greatest Hits on the turntable and I feel it was 
released yesterday. In Bruce's case, he's cool. He's innovative, and 
creative, and lyrically beyond any problems.<br>
<br>
"Every night I hear him change the rap between songs. That's gotta 
happen. We're not robots or actors. Why write a song or play one if it 
doesn't change or no-one is getting off? That's why I never understood 
the top 40 trip.<br>
<br>
"Every night you respond to something different. Tonight he mentioned 
Kingsley and Ocean Avenue in 'It's My Life'. I know where he's comin' 
from, but only 15 people in the crowd know where the f – those streets 
are.<br>
<br>
"But there's universal street corners, and no-one feels isolated or left
 out. The Stones used to talk about places in England (Knightsbridge in 
'Play With Fire') and everyone could relate. Maybe it even added to it, 
not being a common place.</div>

<br>
The Atlantic Daily<br>
<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen’s breakout album embodied the lost ‘70s—the tense, 
political, working-class rejection of an increasingly unequal society.<br>
<br>
JOSHUA ZEITZ </strong><br>
<br>
Forty years ago, on the eve of its official release, “Born to Run”—the 
song that propelled Bruce Springsteen into the rock-and-roll 
stratosphere—had already attracted a small cult following in the 
American rust belt.<br>
At the time, Springsteen desperately needed a break. Despite vigorous 
promotion by Columbia Records, his first two albums, Greetings from 
Asbury Park, N.J. and The Wild, The Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle, 
had been commercial flops. Though his band spent virtually every waking 
hour either in the recording studio or on tour, their road earnings were
 barely enough to live on.<br>
Sensing the need for a smash, in late 1974 Mike Appel, Bruce’s manager, 
distributed a rough cut of “Born to Run” to select disc jockeys. Within 
weeks, it became an underground hit. Young people flooded record stores 
seeking copies of the new single, which didn’t yet exist, and radio 
stations that hadn’t been on Appel’s small distribution list bombarded 
him with requests for the new album, which also didn’t exist. In 
Philadelphia, demand for the title track was so strong that WFIL, the 
city’s top-40 AM station, aired it multiple times each day. In 
working-class Cleveland, the DJ Kid Leo played the song religiously at 
5:55 p.m. each Friday afternoon on WMMS, to “officially launch the 
weekend.” Set against the E Street Band’s energetic blend of horns, 
keyboards, guitars, and percussion, “Born to Run” was a rollicking 
ballad of escape, packed full of cultural references that working-class 
listeners recognized immediately.<br>
<br>
The rise of Bruce Springsteen is in many ways a typical rock success 
story, but it also reveals a great deal about one of America’s most 
contested eras. Since 1976, when Tom Wolfe branded the seventies as “the
 Me Decade,” Americans have tended to write off the era as a socially 
and politically barren time during which millions of people descended 
into mindless self-absorption. Standing in sharp contrast with the 
turbulent ‘60s, the ‘70s seem to have given rise to a popular 
repudiation of the high-minded spirit evident in the civil-rights, 
student, and anti-war movements.<br>
But the story of the ‘70s is much more complicated. Far from being an 
era of complacency and narcissism, the decade gave rise to social, 
political, and cultural debates that built on and even surpassed the era
 of Kennedy and King. Some issues, like civil rights, the sexual 
revolution, and Vietnam, belonged as much to the ‘70s as to the ‘60s. 
Others, like feminism, abortion, gay rights, busing, the tax revolt, and
 Christian Right politics, seemed altogether new.<br>
<br>
Considered in this context, Bruce Springsteen’s phenomenal breakthrough 
in 1975 can only be understood against a backdrop of profound 
dislocation and urgent activism, particularly in the working-class 
communities that absorbed so many of the decade’s economic and cultural 
shocks.<br>
<br>
Reflecting on his formative years in Freehold, New Jersey, Springsteen 
once described the home he grew up in as a “dumpy, two-story, two-family
 house, next door to the gas station.” Several companies had 
manufacturing plants there—3M, Nescafé, the odd rug mill or paper 
plant—but by the post-war era, the city, like so many other middling 
urban areas, was dying. “Freehold was just a … small, narrow-minded 
town,” Springsteen told the English radio interviewer Roger Scott in 
1984, “no different than probably any other provincial town. It was just
 the kind of area where it was real conservative. It was just very 
stagnating. There were some factories, some farms and stuff, that if you
 didn’t go to college you ended up in. There wasn’t much, you know; 
there wasn’t that much.”<br>
<br>
Home wasn’t a happy place for Springsteen, and neither was school. A 
loner by nature, he coasted anonymously without leaving much of a mark. 
At Freehold Regional High School, he played no sports, participated in 
no extracurricular activities, and barely passed his classes, according 
to the biographer Dave Marsh. “I didn’t even make it to class clown,” 
Bruce later remarked. “I had nowhere near that amount of notoriety.”<br>
<br>
Years later, as the writer Eric Alterman recounts, one of Springsteen’s 
classmates reflected, “If he hadn’t turned out to be Bruce Springsteen, 
would I remember him? I can’t think of why I would. You have to 
remember, without a guitar in his hands, he had absolutely nothing to 
say.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s only passion was music. He joined his first band, the 
Castilles, when he was still in high school. Their professional debut at
 the West Haven Swim Club led to a smattering of engagements at local 
roller-skate rinks, junior-high-school dances and supermarket openings.<br>
<br>
After an unremarkable stint at Ocean County Community College, he 
relocated to Asbury Park, a gritty coastal community that scarcely 
resembled the glitzy seaside resort of its earlier days. By that time, 
jet travel and air conditioning had made distant locations like 
California, Florida, and the Caribbean more attractive to local 
vacationers. Deeply segregated and suffering from massive unemployment, 
the city erupted in violence between black rioters and a mostly white 
police force in July 1970, resulting in $4 million of property damage 
and 92 gunshot casualties. The town soon became a shadow of its former 
self—a half-desolate collection of small beach bungalows, decaying 
hotels, a modest convention center, and a handful of greasy-spoon 
diners.<br>
But what it lacked in vigor and polish, Asbury Park made up for in 
artistic vitality. Lining its boardwalk were a motley assortment of bars
 where aspiring Jersey musicians like the drummer Vini Lopez, the 
keyboardists Danny Federici and David Sancious, the saxophonist Clarence
 Clemons, and the guitarist Steve Van Zandt—all of whom eventually 
played alongside Springsteen—forged a dynamic, interracial, and 
working-class rock-and-roll scene. The artists who eventually united 
under the banner of the E Street Band were revolting against the 
soft-pop sensibilities of acts like Donny Osmond, the Bee Gees, Chicago,
 America, Elton John, and the Carpenters, all of whom dominated the 
charts in the early ‘70s. Combining elements of jazz, funk, Motown, and 
rhythm-and-blues, the various incarnations of Springsteen’s bands—Child,
 Steel Mill, Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom, the Bruce Springsteen Band, 
and, finally, the E Street Band—enjoyed increasingly wide appeal among 
men and women from blue-collar families who frequented the Jersey shore 
music scene and who found the prevailing sound an inadequate soundtrack 
to their youth.<br>
<br>
Living in a dingy apartment atop a mom-and-pop drug store, Springsteen 
churned out hundreds of original songs packed with the rich imagery of 
working-class life. According to Marsh, Springsteen later observed that 
he “wasn’t brought up in a house where there was a lot of reading and 
stuff.” Yet for his lack of formal education, he developed into a master
 wordsmith, able to capture in lyrics the experience of millions of 
people who were trying to find their way in the troubled 1970s.<br>
<br>
<br>
The ‘70s were a punishing time for America’s working-class communities. A
 brutal combination of commodity supply shocks, loose monetary policy, 
and federal deficits—the latter, a hangover effect from the Vietnam 
War—created both sky-high inflation and unemployment; the resulting 
phenomenon, which economists dubbed “stagflation,” interrupted a 
quarter-century of seemingly boundless growth and prosperity.<br>
Compounding these challenges, many of the well-paying industrial jobs 
that once lifted blue-collar workers into the ranks of the American 
middle class began to disappear. In Youngstown, Ohio, steel plants were 
shuttering their doors by mid-decade, the result of foreign competition 
and failure to invest in new technology. In Elizabeth, New Jersey, the 
slow demise of the Singer sewing-machine plant, once the mainstay of the
 city’s economy, ushered in a period of post-industrial ruin. Sixty 
miles south on the New Jersey turnpike, Camden, the worldwide anchor of 
the Campbell Soup company, saw its manufacturing base drop from 38,900 
jobs in 1948 to just 10,200 in 1982. Though each industry experienced 
its own, unique set of circumstances, the prevailing narrative was one 
of industrial decline.<br>
<br>
Amid all this, blue-collar Americans were still reeling from the Vietnam
 War, a conflict that saw working-class men of all races do most of the 
fighting and dying. They were no less immune than anyone else to the 
general dissolution of authority—be it paternal, governmental, or 
civic—that seemed everywhere on display. And they were fully implicated 
in the creative cultural disruption of second-wave feminism and the 
modern gay-rights movement. In response to the decade’s turbulence, 
working-class communities exhibited a full range of grassroots political
 expression. Sometimes that activist spirit turned ugly, as with the 
anti-busing movement. But often, it didn’t.<br>
<br>
Between 1967 and 1977 the average number of workers on strike climbed by
 30 percent and the number of work days lost to stoppages by 40 percent.
 “At the heart of the new mood,” argued The New York Times, “there is a 
challenge to management’s authority to run its plants.” From striking 
postal workers in New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey to the United 
Auto Workers’ dramatic walkout against General Motors in 1970, 
blue-collar Americans demonstrated a degree of militancy unseen since 
the end of World War II.<br>
<br>
In response to the decade’s turbulence, working-class communities exhibited a full range of grassroots political expression.<br>
<br>
Speaking to the grassroots labor engagement that pulsed through America 
in the ‘70s, a UAW official observed that “it’s a different generation 
of workingmen. None of these guys came over from the old country poor 
and starving, grateful for any job they could get. None of them have 
been through a depression. They’ve been exposed—at least through 
television—to all the youth movements of the last ten years … They’re 
just not going to swallow the same kind of treatment their fathers did 
... They want more than just a job for 30 years.”<br>
Workers didn’t limit their opposition to management. Often, they turned 
their sites on union leadership. The decade gave rise to unlikely heroes
 like Ed Sadlowski, the 38-year-old director of the United Steel 
Workers’ largest district (encompassing Chicago, Illinois and Gary, 
Indiana) who ran as a reform candidate for the presidency of his union’s
 international chapter. His fellow workers called him “Oilcan Eddie.” 
Rolling Stone magazine dubbed him an “old-fashioned hero of the new 
working class.”<br>
<br>
Running on a multi-racial, multi-ethnic ticket, Sadlowski lost to the 
union’s establishment candidate by a convincing margin, but his brash 
style and willingness to acknowledge the drudgery associated with 
industrial labor played better than expected. His coalition—young, 
integrated, and restive—resembled nothing so much as Bruce Springsteen 
and the E Street Band.<br>
In the opening lines of “Born to Run,” Springsteen invoked one of his 
favorite metaphors—the automobile as an engine of escape from the many 
dead ends and disappointments that seemed to constrain young, 
working-class Americans. “In the day we sweat it out in the streets of a
 runaway American dream / At night we ride through mansions of glory in 
suicide machines / Sprung from cages out on highway 9 / Chrome wheeled, 
fuel injected, and steppin' out over the line / Baby this town rips the 
bones from your back / It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap / We gotta 
get out while we're young.” It was a fitting emblem for its time.<br>
<br>
<br>
By the mid-70s, Springsteen was widely hailed as a “rock ‘n’ roll 
poet—someone who had ‘watched the crowds pass down the street, observed 
the hookers, the pushers, experienced the loose girls on the block and 
yet managed to keep just far enough away to keep out of major trouble,’”
 in the words of the Bucks County Courier Times. He radiated 
working-class authenticity. His songs “contain lyrics guaranteed to blow
 you away,” wrote a critic for the Syracuse Post-Standard, “telling of 
tenements, back alleys, greasers, pimps, jukeboxes, ‘switchblade 
lovers,’ ‘romantic young boys’ and ‘Billy,’ who’s ‘down by the railroad 
tracks, sitting low in the back seat of his Cadillac.’”<br>
<br>
Lester Bangs, Rolling Stone’s highly influential rock critic, was an 
instant fan. “Hot damn, what a passel o’ verbiage!” he crowed. Some of 
his lyrics “can mean something, socially or otherwise, but there’s 
plenty of ‘em that don’t even pretend to.”<br>
<br>
On October 27, 1975, both Time and Newsweek featured Springsteen on 
their covers, with Time hailing him as a “glorified gutter rat from a 
dying New Jersey resort town.” Praising his album as a “regeneration, a 
renewal of rock,” the magazine approvingly characterized Springsteen’s 
music, in his own words, as being principally concerned with “survival, 
how to make it through the next day.” Given the state of the country in 
October 1975—other topics that concerned Time that week included two 
assassination attempts on President Gerald Ford, New York City’s fiscal 
crisis, and the persistent after-shocks of Watergate—survival struck the
 editors as a noble enough goal on its own terms.<br>
Newsweek disagreed. The magazine argued that Springsteen was a creature 
of his record label, which had launched a $250,000 promotional campaign 
for Born To Run. Indeed, not everyone was buying the hype. <br>
<br>
“Springsteen is said to be a new Bob Dylan,” quipped the syndicated 
columnist Mike Royko. “Bob Dylan was said to be a new Woody Guthrie. 
Woody Guthrie was not a new anybody. He was just Woody Guthrie. I guess 
that’s why he’s never going to be as big a star as Bob Dylan or Bruce 
Springsteen.”<br>
<br>
When Kid Leo played “Born to Run” at 5:55 each Friday afternoon to “kick off the weekend,” he was offering musical escape.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s critics misread his appeal. Absent from their analysis was
 class. The young heroes in “Thunder Road” and “Born to Run” are in 
flight from a very specific condition. Marsh recounts an interview in 
which Bruce explained, “I know what it’s like not to be able to do what 
you want to do, because when I go home, that’s what I see. It’s not fun,
 it’s no joke. I see my sister and her husband. They’re living the lives
 of my parents in a certain kind of way. They got kids; they’re working 
hard. These are people, you can see something in their eyes ... I asked 
my sister, ‘What do you do for fun?’ ‘I don’t have any fun,’ she says. 
She wasn’t kidding.”<br>
<br>
When Kid Leo played “Born to Run” at 5:55 each Friday afternoon to “kick
 off the weekend,” he was offering musical escape. In “Thunder Road,” 
the narrator begs Mary to “roll down the window and let the wind blow 
back your hair/ Well the night’s busting open/ These two lanes will take
 us anywhere/ We got one last chance to make it real/ To trade in these 
wings on some wheels.” With 16 percent of non-college educated youth 
either unemployed or underemployed, and many of their more fortunate 
peers awaiting the next round of layoffs or cutbacks, the flight in 
Springsteen’s music had special resonance.<br>
<br>
Shortly after Born to Run was released, Springsteen became embroiled in a
 highly public lawsuit with Mike Appel, his manager, who, in addition to
 demanding an excessive portion of his profits, badly mismanaged his 
concert and recording revenues. Only after the two parties reached a 
settlement in 1977 were Bruce and the E Street Band clear to return to 
lay down their next record. The product of their labors, Darkness On the
 Edge of Town, was released in 1978 to critical acclaim, followed by 
another best-selling record, The River, in 1980.<br>
<br>
Both LPs revisited many of the same themes introduced in Born to Run. 
Rolling Stone called The River “a contemporary, New Jersey version of 
The Grapes of Wrath, with the Tom Joad/Henry Fonda figure—nowadays no 
longer able to draw on the solidarity of family—driving a stolen car 
through a neon Dust Bowl.” But what made the album “really special” was:<br>
[Its] epic exploration of the second acts of American lives. Because he 
realizes that most of our todays are the tragicomic sum of a scattered 
series of yesterdays that had once hoped to become better tomorrows, he 
can fuse past and present, desire and destiny, laughter and longing, and
 have death or glory emerge as more than just another story.<br>
<br>
To appreciate Bruce Springsteen’s social and political bent, it’s 
helpful to compare Born to Run to the competition. As popular as that 
album was, for millions of Americans who came of age in the 1970s, it 
was James Taylor, the six-foot-three, long-haired son of a wealthy North
 Carolina doctor, who supplied the decade’s soundtrack. With his sad 
eyes and brooding stare, Taylor captured the melancholy disposition of a
 country still reeling from the sixties<br>
<br>
Released in 1970, his second album, Sweet Baby James—the one that made 
him famous—sold 1.6 million copies in just one year. Like his fellow 
singer-songwriters of the seventies, a talented and varied group that 
included Carol King, Joni Mitchell, Jim Croce, and John Denver, Taylor 
was interested in the mysteries of the self. “What all of them seem to 
want most,” Time noted, “is an intimate mixture of lyricism and personal
 expression—the often exquisitely melodic reflections of a private ‘I.’”<br>
<br>
Springsteen embodied the lost seventies—the tense, political, working-class rejection of America’s limitations.<br>
<br>
Over the years, Taylor would give generously of his time and talent, 
appearing on stage to support liberal causes and political candidates. 
But social and economic concerns rarely seeped into his seventies-era 
compositions. There was too much personal ground to cover. Time noted 
that “like so many other troubled, dislocated young Americans, Taylor 
may at first seem self-indulgent in his woe. What he has endured and 
sings about, with much restraint and dignity, are mainly ‘head’ 
problems, those pains that a lavish quota of middle-class 
advantages—plenty of money, a loving family, good schools, health, 
charm, and talent—do not seem to prevent.” What was true of Taylor was 
also true of the era’s most successful singer-songwriters—from Carol 
King and Joni Mitchell, to Billy Joel and Jim Croce.<br>
Critics of this new genre of songs about the self (known also as 
“I-rock”) risked glorifying earlier generations of musicians. Indeed, 
there was nothing especially political about the better part of the 
American songbook that predated the ‘70s. Those who longed for a more 
meaningful past would have strained to find deeper meaning in the 
bubblegum pop of the early and mid-‘60s. Even Bob Dylan eschewed most 
political themes after 1963, at least on the surface. But there was a 
distinction between the singer-songwriters and rock balladeers like 
Bruce Springsteen. Singer-songwriters represented the inward turn that 
we most popularly associate with the ‘70s—a very real phenomenon with 
authentic cultural resonance. By contrast, Springsteen embodied the lost
 ‘70s—the tense, political, working-class rejection of America’s 
limitations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lost amid popular memories of kitsch—of waterbeds and pet rocks, mood 
rings and self-help books—is the story of a more complicated decade. The
 enduring sway of Born to Run isn’t just thanks to the music, which 
stands up strongly, four decades later. It stems also from the unique 
time and place in which Americans first came to know Bruce Springsteen.<br>
An intensely private figure, Springsteen rarely sat for interviews, 
particularly in the early years. But when he did, politics was never far
 from his mind. “I don’t think the American Dream was that everyone was 
going to make it or that everyone was going to make a billion dollars,” 
he later said (as captured in the anthology, Bruce Springsteen Talking).
 “But it was that everyone was going to have an opportunity and the 
chance to live a life with some decency and a chance for some 
self-respect.”<br>
<br>
It’s been 40 years since “Born to Run” first captivated the popular 
imagination. In many ways, we’re living in a comparatively prosperous 
decade: Downtown Freehold has been restored to its original splendor, 
and the Asbury Park boardwalk is lined with upscale bars and restaurants
 catering to an upwardly mobile crowd. Yet Americans still grapple with 
the same concerns that animated a young Bruce Springsteen. The place and
 condition of one’s birth continue to define the outer boundaries of 
possibility. All of which makes the music as meaningful as it ever was.</div>

Bruce Springsteen on Making 'Born to Run': 'We Went to Extremes'<br>
In a never-before-published 2005 interview, Springsteen goes in-depth on the writing and recording of the 1975 classic<br>
<br>
BY BRIAN HIATT August 25, 2015<br>
 <br>
<br>
"We were considered not a success at that particular moment, and so 
'Born to Run' was pretty critical," says Springsteen of his 1975 
materpiece.<br>
<br>
He had one last chance to make it real. Or at least that's how the story
 goes. With 1975's Born to Run, a 25-year-old Bruce Springsteen felt 
like his very life was on the line, which is probably why he drove 
himself — and the E Street Band — to the brink of breakdown over the 
tortured months of its creation. In November 2005, a couple of hours 
before going onstage for a show on his solo Devils and Dust tour, 
Springsteen called Rolling Stone to talk about making Born to Run. On 
the 40th anniversary of the album's release, here is the full transcript
 of that conversation, published for the first time.<br>
<br>
<br>
I talked to Steve Van Zandt today, and he said that there was a real 
sense that Born to Run could have been it for you as a recording artist.
 How true does that feel to you?<br>
<br>
 I was signed [to Columbia Records] with John Hammond and Clive Davis, 
and then after my first record, Clive Davis was gone and I fell into 
disfavor for the second record. A different group of people came in. 
Nobody had an investment in me, and we were just slipping through the 
cracks. I think when The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle 
came out it, wasn't particularly promoted and I always remember going to
 radio stations where they didn't know I had a second record out 
[laughs]. I remember everybody coming down to watch some promising young
 band who was opening for us —and then leaving when we came on. It was 
at My Father's Place [in Roslyn, Long Island] and [former manager] Mike 
Appel was at the door taking down their names, writing down who left. So
 the atmosphere was very, very combative. At the time, there was a great
 disagreement over The Wild and the Innocent, and I was asked to record 
the entire album over again with studio musicians. And I said I wouldn't
 do it, and they basically said, "Well hey, look, it's going to go in 
the trash can." That's the record business, you know.<br>
<br>
The "Born to Run" single came out far in advance of the album.<br>
<br>
Yeah, when Born to Run came out, we had the unusual thing of the single 
being out six months before the album came out. We took so long with the
 record that we gave the song to the radio stations thinking we were 
going to be almost done, but that's not what happened. So a lot of time 
passed before the album came out and a couple of good things happened. 
One is that the song itself did get quite a bit of radio play, and there
 was a big buzz on it. I think what made the album have a buzz on it was
 the fact that "Born to Run," the cut, had been played for quite a while
 on the FM radio stations. And the other good thing that happened was 
there was a guy named Irwin Segelstein who came in to run the company. 
Irwin came in from the television department to take over the record 
company and he had a son who was going to school at some college...<br>
<br>
Brown, I think.<br>
<br>
Yeah. So he came and saw the show, and the next day I was lambasting the
 record company in the school newspaper, with some school reporter, and I
 believe the son went home to the father and said, "Hey, what about 
these guys?" Then Irwin Segelstein called us up and got together with us
 and said, "Gee, let's bury the hatchet." But we were on very shaky turf
 the whole time, and we didn't know what was going to happen. We were 
considered not a success at that particular moment, and so Born to Run 
was pretty critical — we were hoping to get some attention and make a 
dent, so yeah, I think Steve is right. On the other hand, I mean, I 
don't know if it would have finished us — because what the hell else 
were we going to do [laughs]? There's that element, too. And the night 
the guys from the record company walked out of the show, I told the 
band, "Look, they may think we are going to go away, except we have no 
place to go." [Laughs]<br>
<br>
That's quite a pep talk.<br>
<br>
I said, "Don't worry fellas — we have no place to go. We're not going 
away. We're going to continue." And the live shows were getting a great 
response from the audience and there was no going back to your day job. 
Nobody had any day jobs, and they were ill-prepared for such a thing. So
 we knew wherever we were, that's where we were gonna be.<br>
<br>
"Part of what made the record good is that we went to extremes to 
structure it and compose it and play it in this very detailed and 
drive-yourself-crazy fashion."<br>
<br>
When you heard a mastered version of the album, you hated it and threw 
it into a pool. You've said the truth is that you were afraid. What were
 you afraid of?<br>
<br>
I've always had a bit of an ambivalent attitude towards... what was I 
afraid of? Change, I don't know [laughs]. Also, it was a moment when 
your music was the totality of your identity, and so you were so caught 
up and so invested in it. Part of what made the record good is that we 
went to extremes to structure it and compose it and play it in this very
 detailed and drive-yourself-crazy fashion. I hadn't listened to it in 
about 20 years or so, and I recently listened to it because we 
remastered it and I said, "Wow." It held up really well, because it was 
just structured and built like a tank. It was indestructible, and that 
came from an enormous amount of time that we put in, an unhealthy amount
 of obsessive-compulsiveness. So part of it was, I was afraid of 
releasing the record and just saying, "Well, this is who I am," for all 
the obvious reasons that people are afraid of exposure and putting 
themselves out there: This is who I am, this is everything I know, this 
is my best, this is the best I can do right now.<br>
<br>
You also had lost perspective on it at that point.<br>
<br>
I lost the ability to hear it clearly, certainly towards the end of the 
production. After the long period of time we spent on it, I could only 
hear what was wrong with it or what I thought was weak with it. And 
also, the way we listened to the master was, we went downtown in 
Richmond, Virginia to the local stereo outlet and we asked the guy if we
 could play something on a stereo in the store. The guy made a big fuss 
and finally he sent us to the back of the store and we just put it on a 
record player that was on the shelf. Then we stood there in the middle 
of the store listening to the whole thing, attempting to judge what we 
thought of it. It was just really me not wanting to let it go and not 
wanting to admit that it was the best that I could do and that I was 
finished. To accept that our fortunes were going to rest on whatever 
this was, for better or for worse. That was a big responsibility at the 
time, and we were putting everything we had on what we'd done. So it was
 just traumatic. And you're young, 24 or 25, and you don't have the 
stability or the history to be able to put it in any kind of 
perspective. It was just all that there is and all that there was gonna 
be. [It felt like] there were gonna be no more records after this 
record. We were all going off a cliff the next day, as far as my 
approach to it. It was just, "This was it."<br>
<br>
"[It felt like] there were gonna be no more records after this record. 
We were all going off a cliff the next day, as far as my approach to 
it."<br>
<br>
You were 24 or 25 – still young — when you wrote, "You're scared and 
you're thinking that maybe you ain't that young anymore." What was that 
about?<br>
<br>
The songs were written immediately after the Vietnam War and you forget,
 everybody felt like that then. It didn't matter how old you were, 
everybody experienced a radical change in the image they had of their 
country and of themselves. You were going to be a different type of 
American than the generation that immediately preceded you. A radically 
different type, so that line was just recognizing that fact. A lot of my
 heroes influenced that album. But I realized that I was not them. I was
 someone else; I was not them. I embraced what made us singular, 
individual. It wasn't just a mishmash of previous styles. There was a 
lot of stuff we loved in it from the music we loved, but there was 
something else too — and that something else was quite a sense of dread 
and uncertainty about the future and who you were, where you were going,
 where the whole country was going. That found its way into the record.<br>
<br>
The lyrical, major-key style of the album's piano parts – "Thunder 
Road," "Backstreets" — became a big part of what people think of as your
 sound. Where did that come from? What were the musical touchstones for 
you there?<br>
<br>
The fact that those things had these elaborate introductions and melodic
 parts and a variety of movements, you can trace that back to the way 
the Roy Orbison records were composed. But, also, it was just something 
that I liked. I had a little old Aeolian piano sitting in the front of 
my living room, and I knew I was interested in writing on the piano at 
that time, partly because I was interested in those thematic movements. I
 suppose when you do it correctly, a good introduction and a good outro 
makes the song feel like it's coming out of something and then evolving 
into something. Like it's part of some sort of continuity, and it was 
also dramatic and it was meant to set up the song. I think somebody 
asked me about it in the little film we made, and I said part of the 
idea was to make it feel that something auspicious was going to occur. 
And it just set the scene. There is something about the melody of 
Thunder Road that just suggests "new day," it suggests morning, it 
suggests something opening up. That's why that song ended up first on 
the record, instead of "Born to Run" — which would've made sense, to put
 "Born to Run" first on the album. And we still put it on the top of the
 second side. But "Thunder Road" was just so obviously an opening, due 
to its intro. And these things evolve. I think there's only eight songs 
on Born to Run — I don't think it's much more than 35 minutes long. But 
as you move into it, where every song comes up in the sequence makes a 
lot of sense — though we weren't thinking about it; we were going on 
instinct at the time.<br>
<br>
"I wanted to make the greatest rock record that I'd ever heard, and I 
wanted it to sound enormous and I wanted it to grab you by your throat 
and insist that you take that ride, insist that you pay attention, not 
to just the music, but just to life, to feeling alive, to being alive."<br>
<br>
Before you recorded a note of the song "Born to Run," what picture of the thing did you have in your mind?<br>
Just, exhilarating, orgasmic [laughs]. I remember when the riff came 
into my head. I'd been listening to the record "Because They're Young" 
by Duane Eddy, and I'd been listening to quite a bit of Duane Eddy 
because I was into the twangy guitar sound at the moment. But it was one
 of those things that I can't completely trace back. I mean, I had these
 enormous ambitions. I wanted to make the greatest rock record that I'd 
ever heard, and I wanted it to sound enormous and I wanted it to grab 
you by your throat and insist that you take that ride, insist that you 
pay attention, not to just the music, but just to life, to feeling 
alive, to being alive. That was sort of what the song was asking, and it
 was taking a step out into the unknown. And that's the big difference, 
say, between "Born to Run" and "Born in the U.S.A." "Born in the U.S.A" 
was obviously about standing someplace. "Born to Run" wasn't; it was 
about searching for that place. It was a moment when I was young and 
that's what I was doing. I was very untethered and you had a rough map 
and you were about to set out in search of your frontier — personally 
and emotionally — and everything was very, very wide open. And that's 
how the record felt, just wide open, full of possibilities, full of 
fear, you know, but that's life [laughs].<br>
<br>
When you play "Born to Run" now in concert, people who are settled down —
 who aren't running anywhere — get as excited as ever, and sing along 
like it's still their anthem. And you aren't really running anymore, 
either. So what does the song mean now that's different from what it 
meant then?<br>
<br>
I think that those emotions and those desires — and it was a record of 
enormous longing, tremendous longing — that never leaves you. You're 
dead when that leaves you. It's just about, "Hey, you're gonna take that
 step into the next day and nobody knows what tomorrow brings." No one 
can know that. And so the song continues to speak to that part of you — 
it transcends your age and continues to speak to that part of you that 
is both exhilarated and frightened about what tomorrow brings. It'll 
always do that, that's how it was built.<br>
<br>
"Meeting Across the River," for me, presaged Nebraska and a lot of your 
other stripped down story songs. What was the origin of that?<br>
<br>
I had that little piano riff, and I'm not exactly sure where the lyric 
came from. I don't know, there was something North Jersey in it; I can't
 quite explain... There was that New York–New Jersey, 
big-time/small-time thing, you know? It's funny, because back then, when
 you lived in New Jersey, you could've been a million miles from New 
York City and yet it was always there. By that time, I think we'd been 
counted out, and it probably had something to do with that, a feeling I 
had about myself maybe, that you'd been underestimated. Most of the 
folks that go into my business have had the experience of someone 
counting them out, or of being underestimated, of someone judging your 
life as being without great value. So that song grew out of, "Hey, that 
guy's sort of a small-time player, but he's still got his sights set on 
what's across that river." I suppose that was where the emotions of it 
came from. <br>
<br>
When you look at the newly released footage of your Hammersmith Odeon concert, what strikes you?<br>
I guess the main thing that surprised me was, we just had an amazing 
setlist. "Born to Run" came up in the middle of the set! It was just 
like, your new song. And I remember that was hard to play because it was
 a studio production and I never felt like we had a strong enough 
version of it for it to be a closer for the first year or two. It's 
interesting how really good the band was — it's a relatively new band 
you're seeing, really. Steven had just gotten in the band; Max and Roy 
were new members in the band — this was their first tour and their first
 record. And if you look at the version of the band before that, that's a
 very different band, that's a real carnival band. So the band was new, 
and it had just morphed into what would be its defining shape. So it was
 fun seeing that when it was just poppin' out of the box. We were just 
very good. We were very good.</div>

The Globe<br>
August 24, 2015<br>
<br>
Forty years ago today, Bruce Springsteen released his seminal record 
Born to Run. To mark the occasion, we dug up a Globe review of one of 
Springsteen’s first Canadian concerts, at Seneca College in Toronto on 
Dec. 21, 1975.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is not God. Despite the hysterical adulation of fans 
in some parts of North America, his picture on the cover of Newsweek and
 continuous coverage of virtually every bodily function by Rolling Stone
 magazine, Springsteen is most emphatically not the new pop messiah.<br>
<br>
Last night Springsteen performed for the first time in Canada [his first
 Canadian show was actually in Montreal two days prior, followed by one 
in Ottawa] at the field house at Seneca College. It was suitably 
symbolic, since the place was essentially an overgrown gymnasium and 
Springsteen plays the sort of music that used to be found at high school
 dances in gyms back when.<br>
<br>
The walls and ceiling of the gym had been draped in cloths to eliminate 
echoes and soften the sound and the result made the place look rather 
like a set for an exotic film like Son of the Sheik.<br>
<br>
That fits Springsteen, too, for he is also something of an exotic 
creature, a man who combines the innocent rebellion of the fifties with 
the sophisticated poetic lyrics of the sixties, all played in the 
context of the advanced technology of the seventies.<br>
<br>
That mean that technically, the concert was excellent. The lighting was 
brilliantly orchestrated and precisely coordinated to every fluctuation 
in the temp and mood of the music. The sound, too, given the limitations
 of the hall, was also much better than might have been expected.<br>
<br>
But the whole feeling, the ambiance, of the concert was wrong. For a man
 who supposedly played basic rock’n’roll that celebrated the agonies of 
adolescence and cried out for freedom from them, the audience was all 
wrong. It was not composed of young people who were sharing an 
experience with one of their number who had managed to articulate their 
feelings through music.<br>
<br>
The house was full of university students and young adults who looked as
 though they wanted Springsteen to lead them back to some innocent and 
half-remembered youth, in which freedom really could be found in a 
beat-up car and an endless highway.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and his music might be believable, first, if his audience 
were young enough and second, if he addressed himself to the problems 
that young people have today.<br>
<br>
Springsteen didn’t do that. Instead, he addressed himself to some 
mythical never-never-land of adolescent romanticism that justified his 
appearing on stage in a tight black T-shirt and a pair of baggy pants. 
Who has seriously worn such a costume in the past 20 years?<br>
<br>
Who does Springsteen hope to represent? Who is he talking to? Is it 
aging rock critics like Rolling Stone’s Jon Landau, who proclaimed him 
the future of rock’n’roll and quit his job as review editor for the 
magazine in order to produce Springsteen’s third album, Born to Run?<br>
<br>
Who is listening to him? There were 3,100 people at the field house at 
Seneca College last night. Is their present so unbearable that they will
 settle for the supposed past that Springsteen represents?<br>
<br>
Some of Springsteen’s songs, lest they be overlooked in the 
philosophical foofaraw, are decent enough rock songs. She’s the One is a
 driving song. Born to Run, a little overblown on record, was handled 
very nicely and with some restraint by Springsteen and band in live 
performance.<br>
<br>
The six-piece band, by the way, was tightly orchestrated and highly 
supportive of Springsteen’s efforts but in the end, I was left wondering
 if the band’s efforts were worth the trouble or was Bruce Springsteen 
really just a one-man Sha Na Na?</div>

<br>
By Joe Posnanski<br>
<br>
August 2015</strong><br>
		<br>
Born to Run was the first rock and roll song I ever heard, but it’s 
important to define our terms, particularly the phrase “rock and roll” 
and the word “heard.” Rock and roll is a big beautiful mess of a thing, a

<br>
But the rock and roll I’m talking about isn’t that big and overwhelming 
thing but, instead, an individual feeling that washes over you when you 
hear your rock and roll song. How do you know it’s your rock and roll 
song? Well, it doesn’t make you want to dance, not exactly, that’s 
something different. Instead, your rock and roll song, I don’t know, it 
makes you want to, well, it’s hard to put into words …<br>
“I want to die with you Wendy on the street tonight, in an everlasting kiss. Hgugh!”<br>
<br>
Yes, that’s it. That’s what it makes you want to do. Die on the street 
tonight in an everlasting kiss. A great rock and roll song is a white 
hot magnifying glass, illuminating, amplifying, intensifying, burning 
holes through you. Bigger. Bolder. Wilder. It makes you feel impossible 
highs, excruciating lows, it makes art out of desperation and a party 
out of Saturday night and a whirlwind out of heartbreak.<br>
<br>
The thing about it is, I was obviously the least rock and roll kid in 
the world, with my thick glasses and my nerdy love of sports and my TJ 
Maxx clothes. I was utterly invisible in high school, utterly invisible 
in college, everybody else seemed to know things I didn’t know. The boys
 would walk around with their Rush T-shirts, their Molly Hatchett 
T-shirts, their Def Leppard T-shirts, and they seemed filled with this 
brooding sense of wonder and this dark understanding of the world that 
completely eluded me. And the girls … they could look right through me 
if they ever looked at me.<br>
<br>
And this is what I mean by “heard.” I’d listened to many rock and roll 
songs before Born to Run, so many, but I did not hear them. And then, 
suddenly, runaway American dreams and suicide machines and death traps 
and suicide raps, hemi powered drones, broken heroes and someday girl, I
 don’t know when, we’ll walk in to sun. And, in my room, with the 
broken-frame bed, the torn Al Oliver poster on a wall, the Nerf hoop, 
the boxes of baseball cards in the corner, the broken down stereo and 
Chris Evert calendar stapled to the door, I could feel my heart blast 
through my chest and my mind go supersonic and all that teenage lunacy.<br>
<br>
You don’t choose the first rock and roll song that grips you and moves you and takes your breath away. It chooses you.<br>
* * *<br>
I’m pretty sure it was Robert Wuhl who used to do a comedy bit about 
“Born to Run” becoming the state song of New Jersey, as some were 
hoping. I don’t remember the whole bit, but I remember him talking about
 how state songs probably shouldn’t have the word “suicide” in them and 
that the line, “We’ve got to get out while we’re young,” might not be 
the best tourism slogan in the world.<br>
If you could come up with categories for rock and roll songs, I suppose 
you would have the love songs, the drug songs, the “isn’t it great to be
 alive” songs, the “isn’t the world a terrible place” songs, the protest
 songs, the angry songs, the naughty songs, the haughty songs, the party
 songs, the broken heart songs, the broken soul songs, the I’m Still 
Standing songs (yeah, yeah, yeah!), the womp-bop-a-loo-bop-a lop-bam-bom
 songs, the he-will-regret-it songs, the danger songs, the sex songs, 
the I wanna be young forever songs, the rock and roll is here to stay 
songs, the war songs, the peace songs, the fear songs and “Kung Fu 
Fightin’.”<br>
<br>
“Born to Run” has little pieces of many of these, maybe all of them — 
after all, the young Bruce Springsteen was going all out to write the 
greatest rock and roll song ever written — but, in the end, it is an 
escape song. And I must admit those are my favorite kinds of songs, my 
favorite kinds of movies, my favorite kinds of books. When I first heard
 “Born to Run,” I also first read “Catcher in the Rye,” and I also first
 began to think about writing for a living. It is so hard for me to 
recapture for people how implausible — even impossible — the writing 
path seemed. Writing? Where did that come from? It’s not like I was the 
star English student. It’s not like my teachers made a fuss over my 
words. Heck, I was barely getting by in English. My essays were messes. 
And we didn’t know any writers. We were a  family living in an apartment
 (townhouse, we used to say, to make it sound a little grander). My 
father worked in a factory. My mother had gone back to community 
college. Writer? Heck, astronaut would made more sense.<br>
<br>
I worked in a grocery store as a bagger. I was terrible at it. Milk on 
top of the eggs. Honeydews on top of the Wonderbread. What difference 
did it make anyway? The manager said I wasn’t cut out for customer 
service. I worked at a mortgage company. I would call delinquent 
customers to set up payment schedules. Some threatened me. Most never 
answered the phone. I couldn’t last. I worked in the photo department of
 store in the mall. “Hi I’m calling from the photo department. You 
signed up for a free 3×5 photograph, and I was just hoping to schedule a
 time for you come in to get your free picture.” Some threatened me. 
Most never answered the phone. I kept writing “CB” on the customers 
cards. That meant, “Call back.”<br>
<br>
What difference did any of it make? I mowed lawns. I moved boxes. I sold
 furniture on the side of the road. Childhood is so much about big 
dreams. I was going to be a major league baseball player. I was going to
 be professional tennis player. I was going to be a famous musician and 
ride around the country in a double decker bus — and the basic fact that
 I played no instrument and could not carry a tune did not seem a 
particularly troublesome hurdle. That’s a great thing about being a 
child. To dream you only need dreams. Reality is a distant storm cloud; 
it barely registers.<br>
<br>
Then, suddenly, the storm cloud is overhead, lightning and thundering, 
and it’s hard to concentrate on dreams — they spark and flicker and go 
out like trick candles. It’s a death trap. It’s a suicide rap.<br>
<br>
Escape. That’s what Holden Caufield wanted: “I keep picturing all these 
little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. 
Thousands of little kids, and nobody’s around — nobody big I mean — 
except me. And I’m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have
 to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff — I
 mean if they’re running and they don’t look where they’re going I have 
to come out of somewhere and catch them. That’s all I do all day. I’d 
just be the catcher in the rye and all.”<br>
<br>
Escape. That’s what Bruce wanted:<br>
“Together we could break this trap<br>
We’ll run till we drop, baby we’ll never go back<br>
Huh-Oh! Will you walk with me out on the wire?<br>
`Cause baby I’m just a scared and lonely rider.”<br>
<br>
Escape. There’s such a powerful longing when you’re young … to escape 
from your parents, to escape from your town, to escape from your chains,
 to escape from yourself. All I heard in Born to Run was the last of 
those, a chance to escape from the awkwardness and the ugliness and the 
sheer boredom of who I was. The crazy thing about Born to Run is that 
you can tell there’s something Bruce knows: They ain’t gonna make it. 
The kid. Wendy. They’re not going to make it. But making it isn’t the 
point. Endeavoring is the point. Trying is the point. Running is the 
point. They weren’t born to just accept the awkwardness and ugliness and
 boredom. No. They were born to run.<br>
* * *<br>
Every time I see Bruce in concert, I wait for Born to Run. I’ve heard 
him do it so many times now that I know every move, every pause, every 
note. I know that on ‘Baby we were born to run,” he now goes a little 
higher on “Baby” and emphases “Born” a little more. I know that he will 
keep the music going for a long time before counting down into “The 
highway’s jammed …”  I know how he will lift his arm, and how the fans 
will lift their arms, and how I will lift my arm. It is all as familiar 
as Thanksgiving dinner.<br>
<br>
Born to Run was a dangerous song when I first heard it. Dangerous in the
 emotions it inspired. Dangerous in the innuendo of Wendy strapping her 
hands across his engines. Dangerous in the way it made me long for 
something more, something crazy. I can’t tell you that I became a writer
 because of “Born to Run,” but I can tell you I would listen to Born to 
Run again and again in those moments I sought courage. How many times 
have I heard it in my lifetime? Ten thousand? Twenty-five thousand? Some
 days, when I was trying to write those first stories, I would listen to
 it on a loop, 20 or 30 times it must have played.<br>
<br>
The song doesn’t sound dangerous now. It sounds like an old friend. I 
wait for it at every Bruce concert and I look to see if Bruce — now in 
his 60s, no longer a tramp, no longer seeking Wendy, no longer — can 
bring it one more time. He always does. I wonder sometimes his 
inspiration. I suppose it’s partly showmanship and it’s partly his love 
of the stage. But to play that same song, night after night, town after 
town, 40 years and counting, I suspect he hears something still that 
keeps him running, keeps him dreaming, keeps him howling.<br>
And that’s what I hear in Born to Run now. The kid I was, against odds 
and everyone’s better judgment, did try to become a writer. I know how 
scared he was. I know how defeated he felt. I remember how sure he was 
that he would fail miserably and horribly. I can see him — see myself — 
in that little apartment bedroom, listening to Born to Run, hunching 
over a spiral notebook and writing page after page of awful poetry and 
gimmicky short stories and pointless sports columns. Sometimes, I run 
across one of those old notebooks, and I cringe as I read the words but 
I’m also proud of that kid. He didn’t know. He was a scared and lonely 
rider.<br>
I listen to Bruce sing that song now, and we’re all older, and he gets to that part, my favorite part:<br>
<br>
“Someday girl, I don’t know when<br>
“We’re gonna get to that place where we really wanna go<br>
And we’ll walk in the sun.”<br>
<br>
“I love that part,” I tell my own daughter, Elizabeth, who is 14. She 
shrugs. That’s the beauty of rock and roll. She will have her own song</div>

By Louis P. Masur<br>
<br>
September 2, 2015</strong></span><br>
<br>
It's hard to believe now, but Bruce Springsteen almost didn't reach 
stardom. He had a nice local following in New Jersey and, for some 
reason, pockets of fans in Virginia and Texas, but in 1974, when he 
entered the studio to begin recording his third album, Born to Run, he 
was widely seen by industry types and disc jockeys as a carbonated 
prospect who had fizzled. His first two albums had hardly sold, despite 
positive reviews. He carried the burden of being labeled the next Dylan 
by none less than John Hammond, the executive who discovered the 
original. Springsteen was signed by Columbia as a solo act, but he 
showed up with a band. Those who saw him in small clubs loved his 
spirited, tireless live performances, but there were lots of riveting 
artists who wrote a decent song or two, drew some acclaim, and then 
faded away.<br>
<br>
Springsteen knew that the stakes for the third album were high. Garry 
Tallent, the bassist in the E Street Band, recalls, “We were ready to be
 booted from the label.” Keyboardist Roy Bittan remembers that Bruce 
“felt everything was on the line.” Guitarist Steve Van Zandt says that 
if the third record “didn't make it, it seemed obvious that it was going
 to be the end of the record career.” To make matters more difficult, 
Bruce's ambition was as towering as the pressure. He would not settle. 
Years later, he recalled, “When I did Born to Run, I thought, ‘I'm going
 to make the greatest rock ’n’ roll record ever made.’ ”<br>
<br>
It took him six months during the spring and summer of 1974 to record 
the title track. Van Zandt now laughs at the thought of it. “Anytime you
 spend six months on a song, there's something not exactly going right,”
 he says. “A song should take about three hours.” But Bruce was working 
with classic-rock motifs and images, searching for the right balance 
musically and lyrically. Born to Run marked a change in Springsteen's 
writing style. Whereas previously it seemed as if he had a rhyming 
dictionary open beside him, now his lyrics became simultaneously more 
compact and explosive. What mattered to him was to sound spontaneous, 
not to be spontaneous. “Spontaneity,” he said, in 1981, “is not made by 
fastness. Elvis, I believe, did like 30 takes of ‘Hound Dog,’ and you 
put that thing on,” and it just explodes.<br>
<br>
The alternate mixes of “Born to Run” that are available reveal some of 
the ways in which Springsteen experimented musically. In one, a female 
chorus joins him in the background when he sings, “get out while we're 
young,” “got to know how it feels,” and “walk in the sun.” Musically, 
the strings at various points are more prominent than they would be in 
the final version. It's easy to see why Bruce rejected this mix: The 
chorus and strings make the song too ethereal and distance it from the 
driving force of the beat. In another mix, Springsteen's lead vocal is 
doubled, the chorus is still intact, and the strings at the end of the 
song are even more pronounced. Two other mixes play with the balance of 
strings and bass. At one point, the band experimented with different 
sound effects such as streetcars and drag racing.<br>
<br>
The earliest live version of the song that is available dates from July 
13, 1974, at the Bottom Line in New York, more than a year before a 
string of shows at the same venue that would astonish the industry. 
While musically the song is almost set, lyrically it is dramatically 
different from the final version, so much so that its meaning shifts. 
After “runaway American dream,” Springsteen sings, “At night we stop and
 tremble in the heat/ With murder in our dreams.” The song is darker. He
 is not singing to Wendy, whose name does not appear. The second verse 
opens, “So close your tired eyes little one/ And crawl within my reach. 
... [W]e'll ride tonight on the beach/ Out where the surfers, sad, wet, 
and cold/ As they watch the skies/ There'll be a silence to match their 
own.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen is working the themes of loneliness and violence to the 
extreme. After “boys try to look so hard,” he sings, “Like animals 
pacing in a dark black cage/ Senses on overload/ They're gonna end this 
night in a senseless fight/ And then watch the world explode.” Clearly, 
he is trying to stay consistent with other songs that he is considering 
for the album—at the same show he premiered “Jungleland.” The “broken 
heroes” of this early version of “Born to Run” have “a loneliness in 
their eyes,” and instead of loving “with all the madness in my soul,” 
the narrator seeks to “drive through this madness/ Oh burstin' off the 
radio.” Sometime between July and the end of the summer, Springsteen 
transformed “Born to Run.” He told one writer, “I'm still fiddling with 
the words for the new single, but I think it will be good.” The notes of
 alienation, loneliness, and violence yielded to love, companionship, 
and redemption.<br>
<br>
Peter Knobler, a writer for Crawdaddy, got an early listen in 
Springsteen's Long Branch house. The place was cluttered with motorcycle
 magazines and old 45s. Over Bruce's bed was a poster of Peter Pan 
leading Wendy out the window. The detail is suggestive: “Wendy let me 
in, I wanna be your friend/ I want to guard your dreams and visions.” To
 Knobler, the “song sounded huge, like a Spector spectacular. I still 
couldn't make out many words, but through a wall or on a cassette Bruce 
had worked up to simulate a car radio, it sounded to me like Hit City. 
The end was fairly pulsating and as it faded, Bruce chimed in ‘WABC!’ 
[AM hit radio] and, honest to God, it sounded inevitable.”<br>
<br>
By early 1975, any attempts to shorten or change the song would have 
been too late, because it had already become something of a hit. Mike 
Appel, Springsteen's manager, was eager to get the single airtime on the
 radio. It had been a year since the previous album, The Wild, the 
Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle. On Nov. 3, 1974, Springsteen 
appeared with DJ Ed Sciaky on WMMR in Philadelphia. Sciaky was an early 
and boisterous supporter. He had a surprise for listeners that day: the 
radio premiere of “Born to Run.”<br>
<br>
Within weeks, Appel also sent tapes to Scott Muni at WNEW in New York, 
Maxanne Sartori at WBCN in Boston, and Kid Leo (Lawrence Travagliante) 
at WMMS in Cleveland. To Leo: “ ‘Born to Run’ was the essence of 
everything I loved about rock ’n’ roll. Bruce held on to the innocence 
and the romance. At the same time, the music communicates frustration 
and a constant longing to escape.” Leo played the song every Friday 
afternoon at 5:55; one fan remembers it as the start to the weekend 
happy hour. Nearly two dozen more stations had it by the new year. All 
this exposure, with no record in sight, made the record company nervous.
 When listeners heard something they liked, they usually wanted to buy 
it right away. But in this case, hearing the song on the radio helped 
build anticipation for the album.<br>
<br>
That Bruce and the band had “Born to Run” down is evident from a show at
 the Main Point in Bryn Mawr on Feb. 5, 1975. Whereas the premiere 
performance of “Thunder Road” and performances of other songs that would
 appear on Born to Run later in the year only partially resembled the 
final recorded versions, the band rocked “Born to Run” as if they had 
been playing it for years. Bruce had a lot of work ahead of him in the 
studio, but “Born to Run” was done.<br>
The rest of the album proved just as challenging. “We were recording 
epics at the time,” recalls Bittan, who along with Max Weinberg joined 
the band after “Born to Run” was recorded. “I mean ‘Jungleland’ and 
‘Backstreets’ are not easy songs to record,” Bittan maintains. “It's 
like trying to drive a Grand Prix course: Every time you go around one 
turn, there's another.”<br>
<br>
Bruce kept struggling to get on tape the sound he had in his head, and 
at times it seemed like he was ready to give up. Long nights at the 
studio ended in misery, the atmosphere tense and rancorous. To stay 
awake, engineer Jimmy Iovine would take a piece of gum, throw it away, 
and chew on the aluminum wrapping. In the end, Springsteen was 
miserable: “After it was finished? I hated it! I couldn't stand to 
listen to it. I thought it was the worst piece of garbage I'd ever 
heard.”<br>
He almost didn't release it. But Jon Landau, who had stepped in as a 
producer, helped persuade him to let go. According to writer Dave Marsh,
 Landau called Springsteen and said, “Look, you're not supposed to like 
it. You think Chuck Berry sits around listening to ‘Maybellene’? And 
when he does hear it, don't you think he wishes a few things could be 
[changed]? Now c'mon, it's time to put the record out.” The album 
appeared in 1975, and it launched Springsteen toward megastardom, 
getting him on the covers of Time and Newsweek simultaneously. Reviewing
 the album in Rolling Stone, Greil Marcus proclaimed, “It is a 
magnificent album that pays off on every bet ever placed on him—a '57 
Chevy running on melted down Crystals records that shuts down every 
claim that has been made. And it should crack his future wide open.”<br>
<br>
Born to Run, song and album, fulfilled its destiny. By fusing the pop 
sounds of the 1950s and 1960s to the generational desires of the 1970s, 
it defined its time and transcended it. Even Springsteen eventually came
 around to appreciate what he had accomplished. In 2005, on the 30th 
anniversary of the album's release, he admitted that “<em class="text-italics">t's
 embarrassing to want so much, and to expect so much from music, except 
sometimes it happens—the Sun Sessions, Highway 61, Sgt. Peppers, the 
Band, Robert Johnson, Exile on Main Street, Born to Run—whoops, I meant 
to leave that one out.”</em></div>

<br>
What's the best concert you ever saw?<br>
<br>
Springsteen. I went to see him at the Ice Arena in Lewiston, Maine, in 
1977. He played for about four hours. It was fantastic. There's so much 
energy, so much generosity in the show, and so much real life in the 
music. He was totally athletic, and he'd jump into the crowd, lay on his
 back and spin around. He was a great showman.<br>
<br>
Do you respect him as a storyteller?<br>
<br>
I respect him as a songwriter and the insight in his songs. My favorite 
album of his is Nebraska. I knew from the beginning of "Atlantic City" 
that it was amazing. He had really grown as a songwriter. He's done 
stuff in music that nobody else has done. That line in "The River," "Now
 I just act like I don't remember, and Mary acts like she don't care." 
Let's put it this way, it's a long way from "Palisades Park" by Freddy 
Cannon.<br>
<br>
I feel like you and Bruce would both be doing what you're doing, even if you weren't paid for it.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I think it's fair. And it'd be fair to say that we were both 
self-taught with a lot of ambition, a lot of drive to succeed, because I
 have that in me too. I have this one thing that I can do, and that's 
something Bruce expresses in a lot of his music.</div>
