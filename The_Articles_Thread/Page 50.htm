 Brisbane Entertainment Centre, February 26, 2014<br>
Brisbane Courier Mail</strong><br>
<br>
		 <span style="text-decoration:underline">FEBRUARY 27, 2014</span><br>
<br>
FROM the surprise opening song - a version of The Bee Gees’ Stayin’ 
Alive - to a celebratory climax with Highway to Hell, Bruce 
Springsteen’s show at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre last night was 
one none of those present will ever forget.<br>
<br>
By the time Pearl Jam’s Eddie Veddie joined Springsteen and the E Street
 Band for the AC/DC anthem, the band had been on stage for more than 
three-and-a-half hours, but Springsteen wasn’t done with yet.<br>
<br>
He returned for one final song, with just his acoustic guitar and 
harmonica, a dramatic, intense version of Thunder Road from his classic 
Born To Run album.<br>
Earlier, the show had unfolded in ways that not even the Boss or the 
band were expecting, delving into songs from his first album, Greetings 
from Asbury Park, N.J., then playing his 1973 album, The Wild, The 
Innocent and the E Street Shuffle, start to finish.<br>
That opening version of Stayin’ Alive sounded more like Curtis Mayfield 
than The Bee Gees, but it certainly paid respect to the city’s most 
famous band. There was some more of that with a sizzling version of The 
Saints’ Just Like Fire Would.<br>
<br>
And respect - to his audience, to the power of his band, to the timeless
 power of 40 years of songs, to the revitalising power of rock’n’roll - 
is what a Springsteen show is all about.<br>
<br>
At one point he gives a rap about the E Street Band, working the stage 
like a revivalist preacher, asking the audience: “We have come all this 
way to ask one question, ‘Have you got the spirit?’” before launching 
into a roaring version of early song Spirit in the Night. The song is 
one of their earliest yet they attack it with relish, making it sound as
 exciting as something they had just written at soundcheck.<br>
<br>
There are parts of the show which people now are coming, the young boy 
from the audience asked on stage to sing, inevitable highlights like 
Badlands, Dancing in the Dark and Tom Morello’s guitar pyrotechnics on 
The Ghost of Tom Joad. But there are other parts of the show which are 
completely in the moment.<br>
<br>
There is the joy of seeing his long-time guitar lieutenant Steve Van 
Zandt, who missed last year’s Australian tour, return to the fray, and 
the way that Springsteen bounces off his energy. He goes crowd-surfing 
and returns to the stage with a toy kangaroo and someone’s phone stuff 
in his pocket, at time working his way down near the back of the room to
 get closer to his fans, still singing.<br>
<br>
<br>
With Van Zandt back on board the E Street Band are an 18-strong force of
 nature. I still have no idea how they can respond to crowd requests, 
held aloft on signs in the audience, with about three seconds’ notice, 
and somehow play them as perfectly as something they have rehearsed for 
months. Springsteen is delighted to go off-script, playing requests like
 You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch) and Sherry Darling from 1980 
album The River.<br>
<br>
Playing The Wild, The Innocent and the E Street Shuffle is not an 
obvious choice but they make that work too, concluding with the tension 
and release of the extraordinary Rosalita, and the song suite New York 
Serenade, joined by guest Brisbane string players for the occasion.<br>
<br>
The question for the crowd at this sold-out concert was how could it 
match those two shows in this venue last year? But they left nothing in 
the tank as they delivered the kind of intensity rarely heard in stadium
 shows. They matched those shows all right.<br>
On it goes: Darlington County, The Rising, Born To Run, the nightly 
rendition of Tenth Avenue Freeze-out, honouring the memory of the late E
 Streeters Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and his band have loved every minute of these two Australian
 tours in the past year, and Springsteen leaves the stage promising to 
return.<br>
And this morning there are 12,000 people walking on air saying, I saw it and I still don’t believe it. <br>
<br>
Incredible.<br>
<br>

<strong class="text-strong">Review: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band<br>
AUCKLAND HERALD<br>
By Russell Baillie<br>
<br>
 Sunday Mar 2, 2014</strong><br>
<br>
What a difference a decade makes. The last time Bruce Springsteen and 
the E Street Band came to Auckland, it certainly wasn't the greatest of 
nights.<br>
<br>
That 2003 Western Springs show, his first appearance in New Zealand, got
 a 20,000-plus crowd on a drizzly evening. Much of the night was devoted
 to his deep, dark post 9/11 album The Rising which was his first record
 after a less than productive previous decade.<br>
<br>
It was an okay concert but really not one to leave much to remember it by.<br>
<br>
This time, it was different. This felt like An Event - right from the 
moment Springsteen strolled on to deliver a haunting solo acoustic and 
harmonica-assisted Royals.<br>
<br>
As well as turning Lorde's song of teenage disaffection into something 
that sounded dusty and ancient - and given those reference to trains and
 Cadillacs, something oddly Springsteenesque - his version offered wry 
lyrical changes.<br>
<br>
"Long ago I was the next big thing," he sang near the song's end. "Now I'm in love with being king."<br>
<br>
Unsurprisingly, this first song on the first of two near sellout 40,000-capacity concerts at Mt Smart went down a treat.<br>
<br>
What followed was a wonderful exhausting near-religious experience of a 
show. One that confirmed Springsteen's status as the reigning long 
distance champ of live rock'n'roll. <br>
<br>
That reputation might explain his increased local drawing power, 
possibly more than the half dozen studio albums he's released since The 
Rising.<br>
<br>
It still was a night of inevitable rituals that come with a show by The 
Boss. As well as a songwriter's songwriter he's a showman's showman. 
Which can make for a fair few mood swings of an evening.<br>
<br>
He can be lamenting injustice and blue collar struggle in one song, then
 a few minutes later doing his best to turn the E Street rock'n'soul 
revue into a comedy one too.<br>
<br>
Song-wise, it was a night that offered plenty to the hardcore Springsteen fan and casual follower alike.<br>
<br>
Yes, he played the mandatory likes of Born to Run. Actually, he played 
the entirety of his most hit-laden mega-selling album, 1984's Born in 
the USA, a track by track performance of which became the 12-song core 
to his 30-song three-plus hours on stage.<br>
<br>
Springsteen had been inserting performances of early albums into his 
Australian dates in past weeks, where he had already toured early in 
2013 without heading here.<br>
<br>
In Oz, the tracklist-to-setlist was a smart way of refreshing the show to fans after a short gap.<br>
<br>
Here, after a longer eleven-year wait, delivering all of Born in the USA
 risked bogging things down in a nostalgic wallow and losing the element
 of surprise for much of the show. It did remind that as hit-laden as it
 was, USA wasn't filler-free.<br>
<br>
But that set-within-the-set offered some of the night's best quieter 
moments like an aching I'm on Fire and a Christchurch-dedicated My 
Hometown.<br>
<br>
That part of evening also offered entertaining outbreaks of fan interactivity.<br>
<br>
One woman was dragged up for a spot of karaoke during Glory Days. While 
on Dancing in the Dark, a pan-generational chorus line of mostly female 
fans ended up on stage at Springsteen's beckoning which made for a nice 
variation on the song's original video which featured the 
girl-who-was-later-in-Friends.<br>
<br>
While on the subject of Born in the USA, it must be said the now 64 
year-old whose denim-clad bum featured on its cover 30 years ago looks 
like he'd still fit those jeans.<br>
<br>
Elsewhere, there was still seat-of-the-pants (ho ho) spontaneity.<br>
<br>
After Royals, Springsteen and band started out with album out-take My Love Will Not Let You Down.<br>
<br>
Then after a robust rousing Badlands, delivered as if it was the last 
song of the night, Springsteen picked out a fan placard for the "very 
obscure" Loose Ends, one of his more Orbison-esque tunes.<br>
<br>
But outside the USA anthems and the older standards, much of the night's
 highlights came from his most recent offerings 2012's GFC-themed 
Wrecking Ball and this year's High Hopes.<br>
<br>
Wrecking Ball's title track and the swirling Irish folk-rock of Death to
 My Hometown from the same LP came delivered vitally and forcefully by 
the E Street Band's enhanced ensemble which came with 18-or-so-musicians
 on stage.<br>
<br>
Later, Land of Hope and Dreams became a glorious gospel-rock runaway 
locomotive eventually shunting elegantly into Curtis Mayfield's People 
Get Ready.<br>
<br>
High Hopes, another cover, was a raucous barnstormer while the night's 
singularly most stirring moment came via a momentous The Ghost of Tom 
Joad.<br>
<br>
The Grapes of Wrath-inspired song was originally the title track of 
Springsteen's acoustic 1995 album, but re-recorded for the High Hopes 
album with guitarist Tom Morello, whose political rap-metal outfit Rage 
Against the Machine covered the song.<br>
<br>
Morello is now a guest E-Streeter and their vocal duet on the song, 
combined with Morello's guitar fireworks was something else: Imagine if 
Hendrix had played All Along the Watchtower alongside Dylan rather than 
just covering it himself.<br>
<br>
Yep, that kind of something else.<br>
<br>
So was the rest of show. He might be in love with being king but on 
nights like this Springsteen shows why his rock'n'roll crown is earned 
rather than bestowed. And then some. Just brilliant.<br>

Bruce Springsteen delivers sermon to Boondall crowd in Brisbane<br>
Sydney Morning Herald<br>
February 27, 2014</strong><br>
<br>
Tony Moore<br>
<br>
Ladies and gentleman, the Very Reverend Bruce Springsteen and E Street 
Band delivered the champagne in a sparkling, four-hour sermon of 
top-flight, gospel-charged soul in their last Australian concert for 
2014 at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre on Wednesday.<br>
<br>
It finished at 11.55pm after Springsteen delivered a touching, clear version of Thunder Road alone with his acoustic guitar.<br>
<br>
"Australia, the E-Street Band loves you," the still fit, gritty-voiced singer said.<br>
<br>
"But we'll be back," he said, walking slowly off stage after delivering a
 staggering 30-song set which took the audience from the Bee Gees’ 
Redcliffe, through the heart of New York circa 1974, back to modern 
times and then out through AC/DC's Highway to Hell.<br>
<br>
It started at 8.05pm with Bruce thanking his Australian fans before 
teasing his way into the set, with the cover song that he identified 
most with each capital city.<br>
<br>
It was the Bee Gees’ turn in the city last night.<br>
<br>
Their disco hit Stayin' Alive became a Motown monster groove that had the E Street Band horn section taking solos straight up.<br>
<br>
They then punched through three songs from their 1973 debut album, 
Greetings from Asbury Park: It's Hard to be a Saint in the City, Does 
this Bus Stop at 82nd Street and Growin' Up.<br>
<br>
Here Springsteen reminisced about his super-heroes; The Flash, the Human Torch and Batman.<br>
<br>
Springsteen remains legendarily close to his fans, again on Wednesday 
night letting them dance with him, play his acoustic guitar, sing with 
him, crowd-surf him back to the stage, hug him and kiss him.<br>
<br>
At one stage - after again being crowd-surfed back to the stage, he 
tells the crowd he has found someone's cell phone in his back pocket.<br>
<br>
"That's a first, I didn't feel a thing!"<br>
<br>
He fumbles to get it to work.<br>
<br>
He in turn confides in them, his light-hearted weaknesses to new technology.<br>
<br>
"I'm a late converter, I'm still working out my iPhone," he says drawing laughs.<br>
<br>
The band kicked into Spirit in the Night, again from Asbury Park, after 
Springsteen mock-pleaded with the crowd like a malicious preacher.<br>
<br>
"How do you stay alive?" he pleaded, "Can you feel the spirit?"<br>
<br>
"Can you feel it right now?"<br>
<br>
Wham. Ladies and gentleman Reverend Bruce was back in the house!<br>
<br>
Down went the overdrive pedal.<br>
<br>
High Hopes, the title track from his latest album, was followed by his 
second nod to Brisbane, the soul-charged version of The Saints’ Just 
Like Fire Would, where the E-Street Band locked into the song's horn 
line like they owned it.<br>
<br>
Then Springsteen picked songs to play from the signs held by the 
audience, holding up the sign to the E-Street Band and counting in the 
songs.<br>
<br>
That's when you know the band is good.<br>
<br>
One, two, three bam!<br>
<br>
We got scorching versions of You Can Look, (But You Better Not Touch) 
and Sherry Darling from The River, before the quieter Save My Love, 
originally recorded for Darkness on the Edge of Town album, but released
 years later.<br>
<br>
"It's pretty obscure. It was just too happy to get on that album," he laughed.<br>
<br>
Then they play guitarist Stevie Van Zandt's favourite song, Fade Away, a
 mid-tempo pessimistic tune recorded for The River, which Springsteen 
jokes he had to play for Little Stevie once every tour.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and Van Zandt have a ball together on stage, singing, 
joking, pulling faces, a change from last year's Australian tour when 
Van Zandt was filming his television show, Lilyhammer, in Norway.<br>
<br>
But by this time the crowd had taken over and Bruce is asking for requests.<br>
<br>
The outcome, the seven songs from their second album, The Wild, the 
Innocent and the E-Street Shuffle, that was released in 1973 and shook 
world music with its funky soulful jazz and street blues sound.<br>
<br>
From the opener, E-Street Shuffle, to the gorgeous closing track, New 
York City Serenade, each E-Street Band member absolutely shone, with 
Springsteen excelling on guitar parts that helped shape his career, and 
Roy Bittan influential in absolutely everything on keyboards.<br>
<br>
Jake Clemons, played the sax parts his uncle, Clarence Clemons, famously
 played in 1973, following The Boss through the audience.<br>
<br>
This is the sound that Springsteen and the early E-Street Band eventually took to the world.<br>
<br>
On Wednesday night the E-Street band took Brisbane a step back to New Jersey 1973-74 to see where it all started.<br>
<br>
While for most, it was a splendour to see, Springsteen seemed to 
understand some in the crowd may have been left behind, becoming fans 
after this album.<br>
<br>
Out came the crowd favourites; Darlington County, Waiting on a Sunny Day
 - where one young boy sang solo on stage, a stirring emphatic version 
of The Rising, before The Ghost of Tom Joad and Badlands.<br>
<br>
Last year, guest guitarist Tom Morello, from Rage Against the Machine, 
was a sensation in Tom Joad, sharing the vocals with Bruce and playing a
 solo that started in conventional blues, went to contemporary sound 
effects and back again.<br>
<br>
Again, his popping, wailing, solo had people turning their heads on 
Wednesday night producing big grins from guitarists Nils Lofgren, Stevie
 Van Zandt and Springsteen himself.<br>
<br>
Badlands just swaggered with rude intent, Glory Days sounded like the 
radio gem it is, and Born to Run remains the perfectly constructed rock 
song, with the sax solo and the descending run in the middle simply 
anthemic.<br>
<br>
There the show went to Bobby Jean (from Born in the USA), then Dancing 
in the Dark - when it seemed a dozen people from the crowd were invited 
up to dance, play guitar and sing - before the sexy Tenth Avenue Freeze 
Out.<br>
<br>
Here Bruce went through the crowd one last time, while the big screens 
played a tribute to the late E-Street Band sax man Clarence Clemons 
overhead.<br>
<br>
And then there was Eddie Vedder.<br>
<br>
The E-Street Band absolutely crunched AC/DC's Highway to Hell, with the 
Pearl Jam frontman just loving his time punching out the vocals, while 
each of the four guitarists; Lofgren, Morello, Van Zandt and Bruce had 
their shake at Angus Young's famous guitar break.<br>
<br>
It was stage magic, but suddenly that magic was over.<br>
<br>
And just before the stroke of midnight, Bruce returned alone to thank 
Australian audiences, to talk a little about our surfing beaches.<br>
<br>
And to drive down our Thunder Road.<br>
<br>
"Don't tell anybody about this shit you've got down here OK? People will start coming.<br>
<br>
"Good night."<br>
<br>
I can't tell you how it compared to Bruce's concerts of the 1980s, but if you thought 2013 was great, 2014 went the step beyond.</div>

<br>
By Chris Talbott <br>
Associated Press  •  <br>
Friday March 16, 2012 <br>
<br>
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band closed out
 a powerful run at South By Southwest with a concert that was part 
political protest, part moving memorial and all rock `n' roll.<br>
<br>
Springsteen played a guest-packed socially conscious set, beginning and 
ending with tributes to Woody Guthrie, and heavy with songs from his new
 album, "Wrecking Ball," a scathing look at America in the 21st century.<br>
<br>
He noted how the economic crisis has "put people out of their homes, 
taken away their retirement and split this country down the middle," 
before launching into the powerful new song "Jack of All Trades."<br>
<br>
He mostly let the music do the talking, however, bringing up reggae 
legend Jimmy Cliff to sing "The Harder They Come," "Time Will Tell" and 
"Many Rivers to Cross" and Eric Burdon of The Animals to sing "We Gotta 
Get Out of This Place."<br>
<br>
The Boss took over Austin for 24 hours, making a surprise appearance at 
the Austin Music Awards to jam with Alejandro Escovedo and Joe Ely on 
Wednesday night, then delivering an often hilarious tour-de-force 
keynote speech Thursday afternoon that was one of the most anticipated 
events at the South By Southwest Music Conference and Festival this 
year.<br>
<br>
He capped the evening with a special show that went nearly three hours 
at the Austin City Limits Live venue and served as a preview of his 
upcoming tour, which starts Sunday in Atlanta. He paid tribute to "old 
friends," making an allusion to late saxophonist Clarence Clemons, who 
died last year. And he pulled Clemons' nephew and new E Street horn 
section member Jake Clemons down to the front of the stage to play solos
 several times. He even crowd surfed briefly.<br>
<br>
"I can't believe you're not dancing yet," Springsteen shouted early in 
the show while pointing out a section of sitting fans. "Get your asses 
out of those seats. This is a dance party!"<br>
<br>
Along with new songs "Wrecking Ball," "We Take Care of Our Own" and 
"Shackled and Drawn" from his 17th studio album, which debuted at No. 1 
in 14 countries after release last week, Springsteen played a handful of
 old favorites. That included a scorching version of "The Ghost of Tom 
Joad" that featured a mind-bending solo by guest guitarist and social 
activist Tom Morello.<br>
<br>
The show was the perfect distillation of Springsteen's keynote speech, 
during which he showed he didn't need his backing band to bring out his 
outsized charisma on stage. He took a rapt audience of about 1,000 on a 
personal music history journey and also gave young rockers salient 
advice.<br>
<br>
"Good morning, good morning, good morning," Springsteen said after 
taking the stage at 12:30 p.m. "Why are we up so (expletive) early. How 
important is this speech if we're giving it at noon? Every musician in 
town is asleep, or they will be by the time I finish this speech."<br>
<br>
He name-checked all the musicians that have inspired him over the years 
from Elvis to James Brown and Woody Guthrie to Johnny Rotten in the 
50-minute speech, which was carried live via Internet stream by NPR.<br>
<br>
Among those attending was Juanes, the Colombian rock star who saw 
Springsteen live for the first time just last Friday at The Apollo. He 
loved Springsteen's riff on creativity most of all.<br>
<br>
"It was great," said Juanes, who sang in English in public for the first
 time during a tribute to Guthrie before the speech. "It was like a 
lesson if you go to a university. He's got the whole career. I was 
thinking and thinking, it's like inside me, many things that he was 
saying. I feel the same, how we're so connected."<br>
<br>
Springsteen talked about first seeing Elvis and his pelvis on "The Ed 
Sullivan Show," the exquisite agony of Roy Orbison, the way The Beatles,
 Bob Dylan and The Animals set music free, and the rise of punk rock and
 soul music as forces of change in the 1970s. He related often hilarious
 and poignant personal stories about each along the way.<br>
<br>
Springsteen also talked about the profound importance of Guthrie and his
 personal idol Pete Seeger before leading the audience in a sing-along 
of a rare verse from Guthrie's "This Land is Your Land," which he also 
used to cap the night with the help of members of Arcade Fire, The Low 
Anthem, Ely and Escovedo.<br>
<br>
In closing his speech, he urged all "10,000 bands" in Austin to bring it hard every night - then he went out and did it.<br>
<br>
"Here we are in this town, young and old, celebrating each perhaps in 
our own way a sense of freedom that was Woody's legacy," Springsteen 
said. "So rumble, young musicians, rumble. Open your ears and open your 
hearts. Don't take yourself too seriously and take yourself as seriously
 as death itself. Don't worry. Worry your ass off. Have ironclad 
confidence, but doubt. It keeps you awake and alert. ... And when you 
walk on stage tonight to bring the noise, treat it like it's all we 
have. And then remember it's only rock `n' roll."</div>

Bombastic approach undercuts anthems<br>
<br>
By Greg Kot <br>
CHICAGO TRIBUNE  •  <br>
Tuesday March 6, 2012 <br>
<br>
Call it patronage, insider politics, Wall Street privilege.<br>
<br>
It has given rise worldwide to the Occupy movement — a yearlong 
citizens’ protest against the entitled that, until now, didn’t have a 
soundtrack.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen tries earnestly to provide one on his 17th studio album, Wrecking Ball, out today.<br>
<br>
The chorus of the opening song should ring true to anyone who expected 
fairness from a civic or business leader and wound up with something 
less. We Take Care of Our Own is one of Springsteen’s most pointed 
political statements, outlining a vision of what he thinks America 
should be and how it has fallen short.<br>
<br>
The album is primarily the work of Springsteen and producer Ron Aniello,
 with dozens of guests — including since-deceased E Street Band 
saxophonist Clarence Clemons, who is heard on two tracks. The sound is 
less E Street Band rock than a mix of traditional music (folk-based 
country, blues, gospel) and electronic filigree (samples of vintage 
recordings and rhythm loops). It’s also swamped in harmony vocals, with 
no less than 12 backup singers, as well as a choir.<br>
<br>
As is the case with a number of recent Springsteen albums, the 
production seems forced. The songs are about the death of something — 
not only jobs but belief and spirit — and the fight to restore them. Yet
 that desperation rarely comes across in the music.<br>
<br>
Death to My Hometown rages about a community toppled without a shot 
being fired by “the robber barons.” But it sounds almost cheery, with 
penny whistle and accordion leading a jaunty march down Main Street and 
Springsteen even adopting an Irish accent.<br>
<br>
Shackled and Drawn conjures up a prison work song. Yet the arrangement 
employs a cast of thousands in a rousing chorus, as if to undercut the 
dire reality of the lyrics.<br>
<br>
The album could have been the sequel to Nebraska, Springsteen’s 1982 
album about ordinary people struggling to retain their jobs, their 
dignity, their moral compass. But, with a stadium tour looming with the E
 Street Band, Springsteen opted for Born in the U.S.A.-style 
fist-pumpers.<br>
<br>
The album is bookended by its best songs, We Take Care of Our Own and 
the twangy We Are Alive, which echoes Johnny Cash’s Ring of Fire.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s heart is in the right place. But he went for stadium 
bombast instead of the grit that such stories of hard times demand.</div>

Friday March 6, 2009 <br>
Columbus Dispatch<br>
<br>
CLEVELAND (AP) -- Seeking something fresh and exciting to complement its
 upcoming induction ceremony, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum 
has gotten its fondest wish - the cooperation of 1999 inductee Bruce 
Springsteen in launching a new exhibit solely dedicated to the Boss.<br>
<br>
The hall on Friday announced plans to open the exhibit "From Asbury Park
 to the Promised Land: The Life and Music of Bruce Springsteen" on April
 1, three days before the hall holds its induction ceremonies in 
Cleveland. Featuring various memorabilia from Springsteen, the exhibit 
is expected to run through the spring of 2010.<br>
<br>
"He's someone we've always wanted to do a big exhibit on," said Jim 
Henke, the Rock Hall's curator. "So it's one of those things that I'd 
bring up with his manager from time to time. Last summer they said, 
'Yes, it makes sense now.'"<br>
<br>
It's perfect timing for a year that has been pretty Springsteen packed 
already. He performed during festivities surrounding the inauguration of
 President Barack Obama, released his latest album, "Working on a 
Dream," in January, then was the halftime entertainment at the Super 
Bowl last month. He's planning a major tour to kick off April 1 in San 
Jose, Calif., and will even make an appearance at the Bonnaroo Music 
&amp; Arts Festival in June.<br>
<br>
Henke says the Springsteen exhibit may be the most extensive exhibit on a
 rock star ever done at the hall. Previous exhibits have focused on the 
lives and careers of John Lennon, Bob Dylan and Ray Charles.<br>
<br>
Springsteen has provided various guitars, including the one he holds on 
the cover of "Boto Run," the album that helped rocket his popularity. 
The exhibit also will have scrapbooks and notebooks in which Springsteen
 wrote many song lyrics.<br>
<br>
"Once (Bruce) knew this was real, that it would really happen, he wanted
 it to have as much depth as it could possibly have," said Jon Landau, 
Springsteen's manager and board member of the hall. "He is fully behind 
this exhibition and the effort the museum has made to really get things 
right."<br>
<br>
Henke is hopeful that eventually Springsteen will make his first visit 
to the Rock Hall since it opened nearly 14 years ago. Landau said he's 
sure that the Boss eventually will visit the exhibit.<br>
<br>
"I think we'll have to visit at some other time than the official 
opening, but Bruce is looking forward to seeing it as soon as it's 
possible for him," Landau said.</div>

<br>
By Dan DeLuca <br>
THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER  •  Sunday January 12, 2014 <br>
<br>
  <br>
Bruce Springsteen’s new album, High Hopes, would seem to have hodgepodge written all over it.<br>
<br>
None of the songs is brand new. Eight are originals that didn’t make the
 cut onto studio albums. Some are longtime staples of Springsteen’s live
 performances and three are covers, including the title track.<br>
<br>
High Hopes couldn’t possibly cohere as a unified artistic statement, or 
count as a significant addition to the prodigious Springsteen songbook, 
could it?<br>
<br>
Well, no and yes. It is true that his 18th studio album, which will 
officially be released on Tuesday, doesn’t stick to a single stylistic 
or thematic tone. And it makes use of an array of implements in the New 
Jersey rocker’s musical toolbox.<br>
<br>
But that isn’t such a bad thing. Since reuniting in 1999 with the E 
Street Band, Springsteen has been in his most prolific recording period.<br>
<br>
Which isn’t to say that High Hopes is teeming with lost masterpieces. It
 is uneven in spots and suffers at times from an overload of Tom 
Morello, the Rage Against the Machine guitarist who filled in for Steven
 Van Zandt on an Australian tour last year.<br>
<br>
Morello in many ways is to be credited with the album’s existence: He 
suggested that the rousing, brassy High Hopes, which serves up musical 
uplift while looking grim reality in the eye, be added to the set list.<br>
<br>
The new friend of the Boss plays on 10 tracks, and sings a duet on a 
thunderous remake of The Ghost of Tom Joad, the folkie title track to 
Springsteen’s 1995 solo album. Including an extended guitar freakout, it
 runs seven-plus minutes.<br>
<br>
Faring better as a sweeping epic is American Skin (41 Shots). It was 
originally written in response to the 1999 death of African immigrant 
Amadou Diallo.<br>
<br>
Throughout High Hopes, Springsteen moves from full-throated rockers to 
whispery folk. In the latter category, the keeper is Hunter of Invisible
 Game, one of three songs that will be featured on tonight’s episode of 
the CBS drama The Good Wife.</div>
