Perth<br>
The Guardian ( UK)<br>
Feb 6 2014</strong><br>
<br>
'The remotest place on earth'<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen opened his Australian tour with a first ever West 
Australian concert last night, the first of three sold-out shows at 
Perth Arena. The three-hour extravaganza reaffirmed the Boss's 
reputation as the best live performer in rock‘n’roll. Celebrating the 
biggest hits of his famous catalogue interspersed with newer material, 
the show was a masterclass in audience interaction and the virtuoso jams
 of an 18-piece E Street Band.<br>
<br>
“Hey Perth! It’s great to be in the remotest place on earth,” 
Springsteen exclaimed before a note was sung. The Boss teamed up with 
old sparring partner Steve Van Zandt to sing opener Frankie Fell in 
Love, from new album High Hopes. That album’s title track followed 
before a cover of Australian punks the Saints’ Just Like Fire Would, 
then Badlands, taking us back to 1978.<br>
<br>
From there the floodgates opened: a great Hungry Heart, then The E 
Street Shuffle, during which The Boss let most of the band have a solo. 
The extended jam culminated in Springsteen himself performing an 
astounding blues guitar solo, a reminder of what a great player he is.<br>
<br>
Formidable solos became a theme for the evening, with Springsteen and 
Van Zandt joined in axe worship by Nils Lofgren and ex-Rage Against The 
Machine guitarist Tom Morello. Lofgren’s epic lead on Because the Night 
saw him spinning like a whirling dervish, while Morello’s technically 
jaw-dropping shred on The Ghost of Tom Joad – on which he also duetted –
 was mesmerising.<br>
<br>
Then there were the songs that sent emotions flying the other way. 
Wrecking Ball, The River and American Skin (41 Shots) were moving to the
 point of tears for many, their themes of struggle, hope and despair 
getting to the core of why Springsteen is the king of heartland rock. 
For You was performed solo on grand piano after Springsteen saw a sign 
calling for it in the crowd. The 1973 track never sounded so affecting.<br>
<br>
Deep cuts were dressed up with invitations for lucky punters to join the
 Boss on stage, the funniest of which was Stevie’s Angels, a group of 
girls worshipping Van Zandt, who twerked their way through Ramrod.<br>
<br>
And there were hits. The Rising. Born to Run. Dancing in the Dark. No 
Born in the USA but it didn’t matter. And when it seemed that it 
couldn’t get any better, with the E Street Band finally retired 
following a raucous take on the Isley Brothers' Shout, The Boss returned
 solo, performing Thunder Road to close the show.<br>
<br>
It was a once in a lifetime end to a show that could hardly have been bettered.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Just hours before his first show ever in Perth, Bruce Springsteen said 
he was determined to "keep changing things up" for his audiences and to 
keep on surprising them.<br>
<br>
Coming less than a year after he last rocked arenas across Australia to 
critical acclaim, you could be forgiven for doubting whether he could 
offer any more than he had already delivered with his Wrecking Ball 
tour.<br>
You could be forgiven for thinking that, but you would be so very wrong.<br>
<br>
In a three hour and five minute show, Springsteen didn't just add a few 
new tracks from his latest album into an already established set list, 
he took the sell-out audience on a ride through his extensive work and 
showed them why he is able to come Down Under twice in one year and 
still leave you wanting more.<br>
Starting with three tracks from Springsteen's latest album High Hopes, 
the E Street Band wasted no time in displaying just how tight and slick 
they have become after an extensive world tour.<br>
Frankie Fell In Love and High Hopes were well received as openers, 
despite a slight microphone malfunction for Springsteen and Stevie Van 
Zandt midway through the first song.<br>
Then cheers went up for Just Like Fire Would, Springsteen's cover of 
Aussie band The Saints' song that the 18-member band, including last 
year's stand-in for Van Zandt, Tom Morello, clearly enjoyed belting out.<br>
But it was the tracks from some of his earliest releases that really 
showed the quality and experience of Springsteen and the band that took 
the first night of the Australia and New Zealand to a whole new level.<br>
A fun, horns-blaring rendition of The E Street Shuffle was followed by 
an extensive performance of fellow second album alumni Kitty's Back.<br>
Here Springsteen showed for anyone who still doubted, why he's known as 
The Boss as he conducted the five-piece horn section and carried the 
song over to Roy Bittan's piano for a rollicking solo, before taking on 
lead guitar duties - over the three other famously talented lead 
guitarists on the stage - with a blistering solo. He even blended a 
little sample of Roy Orbison's Pretty Woman into the mix.<br>
If that taste of The Wild, The Innocent and The E Street Shuffle wasn't 
enough to satisfy fans of his earlier work, Springsteen returned to his 
formative years with the only request of the night.<br>
Taking a sign from the crowd and a cry to Bittan to "use the piano for a
 second", Springsteen gave the entire band a break as he took the 
"Professor's" seat for a slowed down version of For You - previously a 
faster song from his debut album.<br>
Other show-stopping moments included the formidable guitar solos from 
Morello and Nils Lofgren on Ghost of Tom Joad and Because The Night, 
respectively.<br>
Meanwhile the regular elements of a Springsteen show such as the young 
child singing a chorus of Waitin' On A Sunny Day and the female fan 
pulled out to join him on stage for her Courtney Cox moment during 
Dancing In The Dark are still carried out with that driving enthusiasm 
and commitment for the show-of-a-lifetime; you wouldn't think it had 
been done hundreds of times.<br>
After a cover of Shout that had Perth Arena's audience jumping to an 
energetic party closer, Springsteen saw off the band before taking an 
acoustic guitar and harmonica for a solo, final and unforgettable encore
 performance of Thunder Road.<br>
The Boss promised surprises to keep this tour as fresh as possible from 
his 2013 shows in Australia, and he definitely delivered.<br>
If you only see two shows this year, see this one. Twice. (And then see it again.)<br>
Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band play at the Perth Arena again on Friday and Saturday.</div>

</strong></span><br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">"Bruce thought that we should really go for the raw feeling of the show,"</em> manager Jon Landau tells Rolling Stone<br>
<br>
By Andy Greene<br>
Rolling Stone<br>
February 7, 2014 <br>
<br>
By the time Bruce Springsteen wraps his tour of South Africa, Australia 
and New Zealand in early March, he will have released roughly three 
times as many live sets as he did in the first 50 years of his 
professional career. It's due to the simple fact that he's now posting 
recordings of his shows online about two or three days after they end. 
Fans can buy MP3s of complete shows for $9.99 or high-quality FLACs for 
$14.99.<br>
<br>
<br>
The move seemed out of the blue to Springsteen's large fan base, but 
manager Jon Landau doesn't see it that way. "It didn't feel sudden to 
us," he says. "But Bruce does have a long history of being very 
conservative about what he releases. It's one of the reasons that his 
music has remained so focused. But the ability to release more material 
in more varied ways via the Internet has been perfected. This just felt 
like the right time to Bruce to start exploring these options in depth."<br>
<br>
When the plan was first announced, fans were told they'd have to buy a 
$38 USB wristband before they could download a show. "The wristband is a
 bit of a hybrid: it's a combination of a download, souvenir of the show
 and bracelet," says Landau. "The wristbands are sold primarily through 
venues via the usual T-shirt stands and cost around the same as a 
T-shirt. As we speak, we have only put one show up, but the response in 
Cape Town was very positive. We had decided on the wristband first just 
because there was a good plan in place."<br>
<br>
The price point for the wristbands was substantially higher than what 
most other artists charge for official downloads, and there was a 
massive outcry from Springsteen fans as well as a petition drive for a 
more affordable option. The Springsteen camp responded quickly by 
announcing the $9.99 MP3 and $14.99 FLAC option, which is right in line 
with what other artists charge. The petition was immediately suspended. <br>
<br>
<br>
"We had always planned to offer the shows as direct downloads at prices 
similar to those of such great artists as Pearl Jam and Phish, who have 
been doing this for years," says Landau. "But there was an immediate fan
 demand for these direct-download formats that caused us to accelerate 
the pace at which we moved ahead. I heard from quite a few fans directly
 with very thoughtful comments." <br>
<br>
The downloads are an undoctored presentation of the concerts, regardless
 of bum notes or any other mistakes. "Bruce thought that we should 
really go for the raw feeling of the show rather than reworking anything
 in a studio," says Landau. "[Front-of-house mixer John Cooper] does a 
very quick and light remix for continuity and simple adjustments in 
balances, including bringing the audience mics into the picture. Our 
goal is to have each show up and ready to be downloaded in not more than
 seventy-two hours, and hopefully less. I have been thrilled with the 
initial shows. They are exciting, raw and different than the approach 
that we have often taken in the past."<br>
<br>
Springsteen often plays cover songs during his shows, and any publishing
 issues this may cause with the downloads will have no impact on his set
 list selections. "He will approach the show exactly as he always has," 
says Landau.<br>
<br>
As of now, only new shows have been put up for sale. Has there been talk
 of posting archival shows at some point in the future? Landau offers 
just one word: "Yes."</div>

<br>
SAM KELTON <br>
THE ADVERTISER FEBRUARY 12, 2014 </strong><br>
<br>
AFTER more than 40 years on the rock’n’roll road, Bruce Springsteen gave
 Adelaide the Boss we’ve all been waiting for and made up for lost time 
with a mammoth three-hour-plus, career-spanning set on Tuesday night.<br>
<br>
His sold-out show had fans packed into the Entertainment Centre and 
Springsteen and his legendary E Street Band played their first ever 
concert here without a backdrop, creating an almost intimate 
in-the-round show.<br>
<br>
Springsteen wasted no time screaming “Adelaide, why is it so f..... hot 
here” before he and his 17-piece band launched into a rocking version of
 Summertime Blues, then took us right back to the beginning of rock with
 his Detroit Medley.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen kicked off his Adelaide show in style by skolling a beer handed to him by the audience.<br>
Then it was the Boss at what he does best with the anthemic Badlands ringing out to deafening screams.<br>
<br>
After 40 minutes he was barely breaking a sweat as the unofficial 
American anthems of 2012, We Take Care of our Own and Wrecking Ball, had
 Adelaide taking part in a fist pumping singalong.<br>
<br>
His energy was infectious, and his presence commanding — and you could 
close your eyes and imagine he was singing to just you but he inclusion 
of both Stevie Van Zandt and Tom Morello on this tour made sure that the
 distorted guitars filled every square inch of the arena.<br>
<br>
With so many musicians on stage, the boss’s style was by no means 
cramped and all eyes were on the 64-year-old, who is in the prime of his
 life.<br>
<br>
He relished in every scream of the fans and each sign paying tribute to 
the hits that have become the soundtrack to our lives, across five 
generations.<br>
<br>
But The Boss clearly wasn’t content with his bandmates filling the arena and took to racing around it himself.<br>
<br>
Giving fans an up close and personal experience, Springsteen traversed the auditorium throughout the night.<br>
<br>
Shaking hands with fans who thought they were unlucky enough to be at 
the back, skolling a beer provided by a fan and even kissing one lucky 
lady.<br>
<br>
As usual, even veteran fans who have seen the Boss many times were unsure where the set would go next.<br>
<br>
Adelaide got to hear the ’90s era Bruce of Human Touch for the first 
time and a roaring version of Darlington County — which was sung 
predominantly to the audience behind the stage.<br>
<br>
Springsteen shredded on the guitar, giving not only the fans but his 
fellow players goosebumps before launching into Prove it All Night and 
newbie This is Your Sword, which had all the charms of many songs its 
senior.<br>
<br>
Undoubtedly the highlight of the night was when Springsteen grabbed a 
young boy out of the audience to sing Waitin’ on a Sunny Day — which 
drew a raucous response and ear to ear smiles from all who watched on.<br>
<br>
The boy was triumphantly carried on Springsteen’s shoulders before the Boss announced: “There’s the future of rock”.<br>
<br>
But things would only heat up from there.<br>
<br>
The Ghost of Tom Joad became a highlight on the Wrecking Ball tour of 
last year and, one year on from the stirring rendition, which has just 
been released on his latest record, it hasn’t lost its charms.<br>
<br>
Former Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello was unleashed in a
 show-stopping moment that displayed the exact point of two glorious 
rock worlds colliding before your eyes.<br>
<br>
Finishing with a somewhat lukewarm cover of AC/DC’s Highway to Hell 
(sorry boys, but if Angus Young can make it tougher with just him and 
his brother on guitar — you should be able to nail it with three — or 
four) and a deafening singalong of the iconic Born to Run with the 
lights on.<br>
<br>
But wait ... there’s more.<br>
<br>
Dancing in the Dark followed as many tried their hand at being Courteney
 Cox down the front before Tenth Ave Freeze Out and a spine tingling 
acoustic of Thunder Road closed off more than three hours of pure 
showmanship.<br>
<br>
The best thing is — we get to do it all over again Adelaide on Wednesday
 night, letting us once again bare witness to America’s greatest 
songwriter presenting arguably the best, most personable and uplifting 
rock show on earth.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">The night Springsteen almost bombed in Milwaukee...<br>
By Eric Beaumont<br>
Published Nov. 27, 2001</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
The best gig ever... Those are usually the first words in a long 
argument between devoted music fans. Our intrepid correspondent Eric 
Beaumont gets the lowdown on some of Cream City's most (in)famous gigs 
of the 20th Century from Milwaukeeans who were there. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band<br>
Uptown Theater, 2323 N. 49th St. (razed), October 2, 1975</strong><br>
<br>
Singer/guitarist/songwriter/attorney Michael Plaisted was there with his
 best friend. Plaisted says, "For legendary status, nothing can top the 
Springsteen bomb scare show. It was general admission and I stood in 
line for quite some time that day and ended up in the third row in the 
middle. The only thing I knew about him at the time was the recent hype 
and the "Born to Run" album that only came out a couple of weeks 
before."<br>
<br>
"The show began slowly and beautifully -- I could see music building to 
what would well have been earth-shattering without the bomb scare. He 
was the street poet then, caressing his odes to the boardwalk life (a 
killer "Meeting Across the River"). During "Spirit in the Night," he 
crawled up and down the aisle of the small theater, the first of many 
demonstrations of trust in humanity and his fans.<br>
<br>
"...(A)fter 45 minutes (that used to be a whole concert, remember?), 
(WQFM DJ Bob) Reitman came out and said something to Bruce. There were 
worried faces and confusion. Two people looked all over and under the 
piano before Bruce sat down to play himself, solo, a tense, riveting 
"Thunder Road." Then Bruce said, "My friend here got something to say," 
and Reitman gave us the news in his best "don't panic" voice. (A bomb 
threat had been phoned in from an anonymous caller, rumored to have been
 a racist irked by Springsteen's Jewish-sounding surname.) They said we 
all had to get out, but we could come back at midnight if we saved our 
ticket stubs.<br>
<br>
"My friend and I headed outside to a bar in the area that had not seen a
 younger crowd in a while. We soon headed back to the theater. I think 
my car was parked right in front of the theater, so we stood in line 
listening to Bruce on the radio as the DJs tried to figure out what was 
going on.<br>
<br>
"The false alarm was rescinded and we headed back in at midnight. My 
friend and I were now in the front row, to the far right. Everything had
 changed. Gone were the melodramatic mood and the somber intellectual 
pretentions. Springsteen came out with his stocking cap pulled down 
almost over his eyes, and all bets were off. Listening to the bootleg 
now, I can hear the magic, the wild abandoning of whatever they planned 
for that night. It was suddenly the Stone Pony (one of Springsteen's 
Jersey haunts), or maybe better.<br>
<br>
"There was a guy there from out east that I kind of knew from an English
 class in Madison before I (temporarily) dropped out a couple of years 
before. He was far more aware of the Springsteen catalog than I was. He 
was in the front row in the middle and went absolutely nuts over one 
song that I was hearing for the first time. His face was as close to 
rapture as I'll ever see. He was rocking back and forth toward the 
stage, singing back at the right parts Looking back, that could only 
have been one song, heard (live) that night and never since: "Kitty's 
Back."<br>
<br>
"At the end, Bruce announced that we got to have one more song and it 
was by Gary "U.S." Bonds. My friend, to my surprise, was the only one in
 the crowd who yelled, "Quarter to Three!" Bruce came right over to us 
and said, "Wha?" My friend yelled it again (I wanted to help, but it was
 like some dream where you just can't get it out) and Bruce said, "Wha?"
 This went on for what seemed like an eternity, until my friend said it 
one more time and Bruce said, "Well, alright!" and there they went. I 
wanted the bootleg just for that moment, and there it is: the 
call-and-response between Bruce Springsteen and my best friend. You 
can't hope for anything better than that night. Can't happen."</div>

The Age ( Melbourne)<br>
February 16, 2014</strong><br>
<br>
Martin Boulton<br>
<br>
Rating: 5 out of 5 stars<br>
Almost three astonishing hours into his return Melbourne show, Bruce Springsteen cranked up, unbelievably, yet another gear.<br>
<br>
"Are you ready to get this party started?," the amped-up 64-year-old 
asked his adoring crowd, a huge smile stretched across his face.<br>
<br>
And with that question lingering in the steamy night sky, the E Street 
band burst into the classic `50s rockabilly tune Seven Nights to Rock, 
which is basically what the Boss has been doing since his tour began 12 
months ago – rocking every other day of the week with no signs of 
slowing.<br>
<br>
It was another cover version that opened this extraordinary performance 
in front of 32,000 spectators when Springsteen appeared on stage with 
Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder in a full-throated rendition of AC/DC’s 
Highway to Hell.<br>
<br>
Vedder knows all about marathon rock shows, having just finished a run 
of Big Day Out performances that each ran for 2.5 hours. But the E 
Street Band have raised the bar well beyond anything this town has seen,
 or is likely to see any time soon, when it comes to playing heart on 
the sleeve, pumping rock ‘n roll.<br>
<br>
Guitarist Tom Morello was again sharing the stage as a full-time member 
of the E Street Band and Steve Van Zandt was back in the fold on guitar,
 having completed filming commitments that prevented him from touring 
Australia last year.<br>
<br>
The long-time chemistry between Springsteen and Van Zandt was soon on 
show, the pair trading guitar licks and cheekily peering over the 
microphone at each other as they belted out High Hopes from the recently
 released album of the same name and Just Like Fire Would, a wonderful 
cover of The Saints’ song from the same album.<br>
<br>
As if Springsteen with his scratched Telecaster, Van Zandt and Morello 
all shredding on guitar wasn’t enough, Nils Lofgren, who first played 
with the E Street Band in the mid `80s, adds another wow factor to 
Springsteen’s star-studded line-up, which also features saxophonist Jake
 Clemens, the nephew of the late E Street Band member Clarence Clemons.<br>
<br>
"We had such a great time (last year) we just wanted to come back," 
Springsteen told the euphoric crowd after a rousing rendition of Hungry 
Heart that was followed by Born in the U.S.A. and Cover Me.<br>
<br>
Tracks from the Born in the U.S.A. album were given a mighty work out and didn’t the fans just love that special treat.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s set list changes every night, but never at any stage does it feel like there’s something missing.<br>
<br>
Some 20 albums into a career that began with 1973’s Greeting From 
Astbury Park, the Boss has more than enough ‘favourites’ to fill his 
epic three-hour shows.<br>
<br>
This one stretched to almost three-and-a-half hours by the time he’d 
worked through a spine-tingling version of I’m on Fire, My Hometown, 
Born to Run, and countless other classics.<br>
<br>
His right hand partially strapped like a boxer and with a black 
sweatband on his other wrist, Springsteen has the look of a man ready to
 rumble, except everyone’s on his side, waiting for his next great 
moment.<br>
<br>
And there are plenty of moments.<br>
<br>
This night Morello came close to stealing one of the greatest with his 
guitar solo in The Ghost of Tom Joad, which left jaws on the floor as 
the one-time Rage Against The Machine member extracted sounds you might 
expect from a DJ with a turntable, but not from a guitar player.<br>
<br>
However, Morello is no ordinary guitar player. And the E Street Band is no ordinary band.<br>
<br>
Longtime drummer Max Weinberg is a picture of consistency and precision 
as Springsteen bounces around the stage, while backing vocalist Cindy 
Mizelle even brought the Boss to his knees at one stage.<br>
<br>
Another nod to Australian music came with a seriously hip-shaking 
version of Shout, the Isley Brothers song made famous by Johnny O’Keefe,
 while closing song Thunderoad with just Springsteen on stage drew some 
of the loudest applause of the night.<br>
<br>
They don't call him The Boss for nothing.</div>
