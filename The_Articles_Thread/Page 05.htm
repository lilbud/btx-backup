<br>
By Marcus Lauglio<br>
<br>
<br>
It has been argued that Rock and Roll is one of the most valuable things
 that America has contributed to the world over the last fifty years. 
And there is no artist in rock who can claim to represent America better
 than Bruce Springsteen. The Springsteen fanzine Backstreets calls Born 
in the USA "a record so deeply rooted in the American experience that 
it's a national treasure" (Cross 10). Distinguished by his American 
accent, Springsteen's songs are peopled by everyday heroes with names 
(quite literally) like Joe and Jane. His music provides an in- depth 
analysis of Americans in their work and play; and through his career, 
Springsteen has been an enduring cultural symbol for America. The 
purpose of this paper is to establish Springsteen's music as irrefutably
 tied to American culture and experience. I will take various defining 
aspects of American culture and show how Springsteen has explored, and 
sees himself in relation to, these characteristics. <br>
<br>
For someone who has become such a symbol of positive and traditional 
American values, Bruce Springsteen's view of this country comes across 
as impressively multi-faceted and balanced. He is certainly proud to be 
American, but he is also aware of the negative things that America is 
responsible for, both to its own people and the world. Despite his scorn
 of education and academic learning at the time, he was aware as early 
as 1975 that, "In this country we've got plenty of things to be proud of
 and plenty of things to be ashamed of" (Duffy 60). Dave Marsh, who has 
written two of the most extensive biographies on Springsteen, calls him,
 "the first American hard rock hero since Elvis himself" (Marsh BTR back
 cover). Yet by recognizing the problems facing the nation, and his 
willingness to confront them head-on, Springsteen proved to a be far 
more representative symbol of America than Elvis ever was. <br>
<br>
However, in regard to his feelings about America, Springsteen has also 
been one of the most misunderstood figures in popular music; largely as a
 result of his single most famous song. To most people, Springsteen is 
still viewed as that beefy Rambo-lookalike rocker scrubbing a guitar and
 screaming out "I WAS BAAAWN IN THE USA." It is an unfortunate paradox 
though, that Springsteen's best known song is also perhaps rock's most 
misinterpreted one. Even today, millions still don't understand that the
 song is not a glorious American pop anthem, but really a look at a 
humbled and bruised nation. "Born in the USA" is in fact, a bitter song 
about a Vietnam veteran who has survived the war, only to find that his 
own country is ashamed of him, and wants to forget about the sacrifices 
he made for it. Springsteen himself notes that, "I guess the same fate 
awaited Woody Guthrie's 'This Land is Your Land' around the campfire. 
But that didn't make me feel any better." (Springsteen 164). In truth, 
the mass misinterpretation of "Born in the USA" can be partly seen as 
Springsteen's fault. Even after it was evident that casual fans were 
mistaking the song to be a jingoistic anthem, he continued to open his 
shows with this song, punching his fist defiantly in the air, repeatedly
 roaring out the chorus in front of a huge American flag that filled up 
the whole wall behind the stage. The majority of eager new fans only 
knew the contagious chorus. To them, the song was a patriotic and 
gung-ho soundtrack to 1984; a year when the presidential election and 
the Olympics held in Los Angeles contributed to a wave of nationalism 
all over the country. Even President Reagan tried to cash in on 
Springsteen's popularity by alluding to him while campaigning for 
re-election in New Jersey 1) . Anyone who was listening carefully would 
have no problems understanding just where Springsteen's political 
sentiments lay. Springsteen's songs of the mid-Eighties were about the 
everyday struggles, victories, and defeats of blue collar America. 
Springsteen, who saw himself opposed to everything Reagan stood for, 
stepped up his support of various organizations that he felt merited his
 support, speaking on behalf of food banks and trade unions. The 
American tradition for volunteer help and community service had clearly 
not been lost on him. <br>
<br>
Springsteen has tradtionally been viewed as the spokesman of the 
American working class; and up through the Eighties, it was almost 
exclusively working class heroes who populated his songs. His early 
songs are about adolescent street heroes, with weird and wonderfull 
names such as Crazy Janey, Jack Knife, and Magic Rat, living fast and 
boisterous lives. Springsteen was not yet viewing his music as a 
political statement. The protagonists were blue collar all right, but 
they had not yet grown up. Springsteen's first three albums did not 
address the struggles of blue collar adults that he is most associated 
with today. Springsteen's young heroes would lose their innocence in 
1978 with Darkness on the Edge of Town 2), the first album where 
Springsteen started examining the situation of working class adults. The
 song "Factory" would prove to be a defining tune for the future of 
Springsteen's song writing. His sympathies for the working man are all 
too clear in lyrics like, "End of the day, factory whistle cries / men 
walk through these gates with death in their eyes / and you better 
believe boy, someone's gonna get hurt tonight / it's the working, the 
working , just the working life" 3). It was against this kind of 
background that much of Springsteen's subsequent work would be based, 
although, in most cases, the prevailing mood would not be quite so dark.
 <br>
<br>
However, Springsteen's ambitions and song writing scope would prove to 
stretch much further than merely addressing working class white America.
 As the Eighties drew to a close, Springsteen moved his focus to other 
groups in society. It was becoming apparent that Bruce was no longer 
working class himself; he was in fact a very wealthy superstar. 
Eventually he even moved to Los Angeles, away from the homestate of New 
Jersey that he had mythologized and with which he was identified. 
Springsteen found himself writing songs from the point of view of a 
wealthy man living in Hollywood. Interestingly enough, songs like "Aint 
got You" were often about the longing for things that money cannot buy. 
Springsteen had started singing more and more about love and 
relationships, and these songs were more universal in their appeal and 
were no longer rooted in working class environments. Springsteen's 
sympathies have always been with society's underdogs though; and his 
1995 album The Ghost of Tom Joad once again saw him addressing the dark 
flip-side of the American dream. This album, however, was characterized 
by several songs about illegal Mexican immigrants living in the 
Southwest. In fact, the only large group of Americans that Springsteen 
has not directly addressed in a single song is the African Americans. 
Unsurprisingly, he has enjoyed extremely little popularity among this 
group. Producer Arthur Baker, who engineered electronic dance mixes of 
several of Springsteen's mid-eighties singles, is quoted as pointing 
out, "The one last frontier Bruce has is obviously black people. I heard
 someone say that he had more black people on stage than in his 
audience." (qtd. in Marsh GD 209) 4). <br>
<br>
One of the most prominent aspects of American tradition that is also an 
essential part of Springsteen's work is that of isolation and 
individuality. Ever since the rough and tumble world of the Wild West, 
which has subsequently become glorified by Hollywood, the ideal of the 
American as a survivalist in a competitive environment has influenced 
how Americans view themselves. Americans have through history been torn 
between their interests in and cultural ties to the rest of the world, 
and pursuing vigilant isolationism. Americans have also had the need to 
live independent of influence from one another. American culture favours
 the strong and competitive. Individualism and isolation, though often 
related, represent two different sides of America, both of which are 
represented amply in Springsteen's work. He knows all too well the 
individualisic urge to move on, frequently represented by the car (or 
occasionally the train or the river) which is used as a symbol or a 
metaphor. Yet Springsteen is also aware of the the terrible results that
 isolation can have upon people. While embracing the American need for 
individualism, Springsteen's songs are ultimately about the need for 
community between people . <br>
<br>
One of the standard ingredients in a Bruce Springsteen song is the all 
American car. The automobile has always been a very American cultural 
symbol; and America is a culture obsessed with its cars. American urban 
planners have always assumed that people are going to get around in 
cars, when designing American cities. Furthermore the automobile is a 
symbol of the technological breakthroughs of industrial age in America, 
the materialistic success of our capitalistic system. Americans are 
proud of their cars. Although cars have always been an important theme 
in Rock and Roll ," Springsteen has utilized auto-imagery to a degree 
where it has become one of the defining traits of his song writing 
style. The cars Springsteen chooses for his songs always fit the social 
framework of the song. Springsteen's celebratated working class anthems 
are filled with numerous referrences to Chevrolets, Cadillacs and Fords.
 By the nineties, Springsteen found himself singing about life as a 
millionaire; in "57 Channels (and Nothing On)" from 1992, he is singing 
about his "Japanese car". Springsteen has at times approached cars with 
almost a religious reverence. For instance, "Eldorado fins, whitewalls 
and skirts / rides just like a little bit of heaven here on earth / well
 buddy when I die throw my body in the back / and drive me to the 
junkyard in my Cadillac" from highway rocker "Cadillac Ranch". Cars are 
however, not always viewed as glorious getaway vehicles in Springsteen's
 songs. In "Used Cars" the singer gives vent to the humility of having 
to drive around with his family in a shabby second-hand car. "Wreck on 
the Highway" uses a tragic car crash as a symbol of the fragility of 
life. While Springsteen has been criticized for his repeated use of the 
car icon, one must realize that these songs are rarely so much about the
 actual cars, as about the people driving them. The cars themselves are 
used as vehicles, background, or symbols. The car itself has always been
 a characteristic American icon and symbolizes in addition to the 
abovementioned themes, the urge to move on in life; and Springsteen has 
given this kind of explanation when talking about his virtual obsession 
with auto imagery. <br>
<br>
The urge to move on is another characteristic of this country, being 
initiated by the European settlers who "discovered" America. Travelling 
is as much about searching for a specific goal (such as the pioneers 
did, pushing the frontier westwards until they came to the West Coast) 
as it is about escaping one's present situation (as did many of the 
Europeans who emmigrated to America to escape persecution or famine). 
This tradition of traveling is imprinted upon the American spirit. 
Today, many Americans move around the country every five years or so, 
never settling down for life. Americans are quite simply not terribly 
used to be rooted down. <br>
<br>
Springsteen's music embraces both the urge of traveling to escape, and 
the urge of traveling to reach something better. While these two "sides"
 of the traveling theme can be interlinked, they are distinctly 
different. Early on in his career, Springsteen was more interested in 
the getaway aspect. After all, Rock and Roll had been the instrument 
which had enabled Springsteen to avoid joining the ranks of the 
disillusioned working men of "Factory". However, as he matured, 
Springsteen realized that in the end, all his heroes in their cars 
needed somewhere to go. When introducing his signature anthem "Born to 
Run" in 1988, Springsteen told the audience: <br>
<br>
When I wrote it, I guess I figured it was a song about a guy and a girl 
who wanted to run and keep on running. But as I got older and as I sang 
it over the years, it sort of opened up, and I guessed I realized that 
it was about two people searching for something better. Searching for a 
place they could stand and try and make a life for themselves. And I 
guess in the end they were searching for home, something that I guess 
everybody looks for all their lives. ( Pond 265). <br>
<br>
A similar conclusion can be drawn from looking at a song like "Hungry 
Heart", Springsteen's first real commercial hit single. The song starts 
off with an alarmingly heavy dose of ambivalent wanderlust: "Got a wife 
and kids in Baltimore Jack / I went out for a ride and I never went 
back", but by the end of the song , the singer reaffirms that there's no
 place like home, "Everybody needs a place to rest / everybody wants to 
have a home / don't make no difference what nobody says / ain't nobody 
like to be alone". So what happens when the search for community brings 
people nowhere? <br>
<br>
Springsteen confronted the dangers of isolation head on with his sparse 
acoustic masterpiece Nebraska. Isolation can be said to be an 
unfortunate American trait that by necessity accompanies the 
individualistic independence that is based on the urge to seek one's 
fortune in a competetive winner-takes-all culture. Springsteen said of 
Nebraska," The record was just basically about people being isolated 
(...) And I think when that happens, there's just a whole breakdown. 
When you lose that sense of community, there's some spiritual breakdown 
that occurs. You just get shot off somewhere where nothing really 
matters"(Duffy 48). Rolling Stone called the album "Bruce Springsteen's 
abrasive, clouded, and ultimately glorious picture of America" (Pond 
133). The prevailing mood is one of loneliness and dispair, but there is
 an underlying element of hope in a few of the songs. The album is 
permeated by crime and violence, (again American themes). The songs of 
Nebraska are peopled by criminals, losers and struggling everyday 
heroes, some whom have already given up hope for anything better in 
life. Yet it is the element of hope that underlies some of the songs on 
the album that make it a truly great album. In "Atlantic City" the 
beaten down narrator sings: "Everything dies, baby, that's a fact / but 
maybe everything that dies someday comes back ". Springsteen would 
continue to sing about society's quiet losers and bitter criminals, on 
The Ghost of Tom Joad, but never with quite the same conviction. <br>
<br>
America is a country obsessed with, but very hung up about, sex. 
Americans are bombarded by all kinds of images from the media and the 
entertainment industry that depict, allude to, or advocate sex. In this 
country, sex sells. At the same time, this is a society that is 
remarkably reluctant to deal with issues about sex in an upfront manner.
 Reluctance to educate our youth about sex results in high rates of teen
 pregnancies and STDs. Homosexuality is still more of a taboo subject 
here than in much of the rest of the western world. The few times the 
country does "deal with sex" up front, it tends to blow things out of 
proportion; the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal was taken very seriously in 
America, while much of the rest of the world was astounded that America 
was making such a big deal out of it all. Considering America's 
obsession with the subject, Springsteen would not be a representative 
American icon, if he avoided the subject of sex and desire altogether. <br>
<br>
It might come as a surprise to someone with only a fleeting familiarity 
with Springsteen's music, to realize the full extent to which sexual 
desire plays a role in the man's music. After all, Springsteen has 
refrained from flaunting his sex life for the media like some other rock
 stars, and has generally been known as one of Rock and Roll's "good 
boys"; no trashed hotel rooms, groupies, drugs, or alcohol abuse. 
However, anyone paying even the slightest attention to his rock albums 
or attending his concerts can testify to the fact that carnal desire is 
an important part of what he sings about. Singing about sex is certainly
 nothing new in the field of popular music. However, it is interesting 
to take a look at the way Springsteen, who has been quite a sex symbol 
in his time, has dealt with the subject. Springsteen avoided provoking 
the older generation like The Rolling Stones had, because he came across
 as very wholesome. Women were often viewed as sex objects in his songs,
 but like all the people in his songs, they were also viewed with 
respect as human beings: <br>
<br>
Strangers from the city call my baby's number and they bring her toys 
when I come walking she smiles pretty she knows I wanna be Candy's boy 
There's a sadness hidden in that pretty face a sadness all her own from 
which no man can keep Candy safe <br>
<br>
Even the woman of "Candy's Room", who appears to be a mistress with 
several lovers (if not indeed a prostitute), is the subject of the 
singer's naive love - not just lust . She is also vulnerable as only a 
human can be. <br>
<br>
If America is a country that is very hung up about sex, then any rock 
artist who is to be embraced, not only by youth as a pop star but also 
by the entire country as a positive semi- political national icon , must
 avoid embarrassing the American public. Young people may be happy 
enough with role models like Michael Jackson, but older generations will
 only approve of pop culture icons if these live up to the nation's more
 traditional values. From a social and political standpoint, Springsteen
 was a safe artist to be drawn to. Despite singing a great deal about 
sex, or at least desire, Springsteen managed to avoid the label of 
sex-obsessed randy rock star for several reasons. For one, Springsteen 
never brought up the topic of sex as a means to provoke his audience. 
Nor did he get too graphic for his American audiences, preferring to 
sing about sex and desire in metaphors and symbols. ("Pink Cadillac" is 
not a song about pink cars of any kind.) In his onstage stories, 
Springsteen always talked about sex and desire in a humorous way, 
earning roars of approval from the audience. Also, by the time 
Springsteen had reached his superstar status in the mid Eighties, times 
and standards had changed. People had accepted that a lot of pop music 
was going to be about sex. And Springsteen presented a socio-politically
 safe sexual image compared to the other artists who shared the 
limelight with him: <br>
<br>
In the months that followed, the handsome, youthfully thirty-something 
Springsteen came to represent a vibrant, working class white male 
heterosexuality in pop music. At a time when Michael Jackson's sexual 
identity was unclear, Prince's eroticism boldly crossed gender 
boundaries, and Madonna turned femininity into a series of disposable 
images, Springsteen represented the vital center: short hair, blue 
jeans, work shirt, and an occasional bandanna or baseball cap to absorb 
the sweat of his brow. (Cullen 125-126) <br>
<br>
America embraced Springsteen's portrayal of sex because it was 
appropriately indirect, decidedly heterosexual, and innately wholesome 
in its expression. As times change, new problems arise, and new 
attitudes are formed. In 1994, Springsteen's song "Streets of 
Philadelphia", which was written specifically for Jonathan Demme's movie
 Philadelphia, got worldwide acclaim and was honored with an Oscar at 
the Academy Awards. Coming from as indisputably heterosexual a figure as
 Bruce Springsteen, the song was about a homosexual man dying of AIDS. 
In an era when AIDS has become a huge global problem, the song was 
received very well. <br>
<br>
One characteristic of this country that Americans are far more open 
about is the relative prominence of religion in everyday life 5). Like 
the rest of the Western world, America has gradually become increasingly
 secularized over the last fifty years or so. However, religion plays a 
huge role in America's history; and the vast majority of Americans today
 would still claim to adhere to some sort of religion to the degree that
 they believe in a "God" of some kind or other. One of the largest 
groups of immigrants to America today is the Latin Americans, many of 
whom are observant Christians. If through secularization, the country is
 "losing interest" in religion, many American traits that were sprung 
from religious ideas are still going strong. The country is still very 
rigid in its ideas about for instance censorship. Fundamentalist 
Christians make up a significant part of the political right wing, and 
are certainly a political force to be reckoned with. <br>
<br>
Springsteen's work has predictably reflected the influence of religion 
on his experiences; and Christianity is a theme that illustrates 
Springsteen's changing attitudes in life. Springsteen was, much to his 
own dismay, given a Catholic upbringing and education. This is evident 
on his first album, Greetings from Asbury Park, NJ, where he frequently 
utilizes religious images, for example with songs titles like "It's Hard
 to be a Saint in the City" and "The Angel". Springsteen used religious 
vocabulary to convey his often garbelled message of street culture. 
Simultaneously, his fervent disregard for Catholiscism can be seen 
clearly in other early songs. A good example of this can be found in the
 swirling images of "Lost in the Flood": "Nuns run bald through Vatican 
halls pregnant, pleadin' Immaculate Conception / and everybody wrecked 
on mainstreet from drinking unholy blood". Springsteen's Catholic 
upbringing had clearly left a deep mark on him; and it took a while 
before he would be able to relate to religion in any kind of positive 
way. A change was beginning to be apparent during the late Seventies 
though, as detailed by Dave Marsh in his first biography of Springsteen.
 Incorporated into live versions of "Growin' Up", Springsteen told a 
humorous fantasy story about visiting God. In the end, God tells 
Springsteen that there was, in fact, an Elleventh Commandment that Moses
 neglected to teach: "Let it Rock!" (Marsh BTR 194) 6). This was a kind 
of cheeky compromise between the older generation and the younger one. 
Instead of discarding religion, Springsteen very cleverly turned it into
 vehicle to promote Rock and Roll. By the end of the Eighties, 
Springsteen was cured of his earlier feelings against Catholicism; 
1987's Tunnel of Love included a lighthearted romantic song called "All 
that Heaven Will Allow". While there is no important religious element 
in this song, religious imagery is being used to convey something very 
positive. Springsteen's more recent work includes a great deal of 
(positive) biblical imagery. For instance in "Living Proof" from 1992, 
Springsteen refers to his own newborn son as "a little piece of the 
Lord's undying light". <br>
<br>
Having established Springsteen as a defining American rock artist, one 
obvious aspect of his status as a superstar can not go unmentioned. If 
Springsteen is such an American artist, what makes him so popular all 
over the world? It seems as if, through his use of his American themes 
and images, Springsteen appeals to a universal set of basic values that 
millions of people all over the world share. Dave Marsh sums it all up 
in his analysis of Springsteen's first main European tour in 1981. Marsh
 explains the European audiences' ecstatic response to Springsteen as 
due to his "stature as a representative and disseminator of a version of
 the American dream, or at least a shared dream that was associated with
 America" (Marsh GD 118) <br>
<br>
In recent years however, this trend has grown to the degree that it 
poses an interesting paradox to Springsteen's claim to Americanism. It 
seems at in the present time that Springsteen; the ultimate American 
rocker, is in fact more popular in certain other countries than he 
actually is in America. Springsteen's fan following in Europe is very 
strong , and if he still has more die-hard fans in America, he seems to 
be picking up more new fans on the other side of the Atlantic. One 
possible explanation for why, is that Europeans may be fascinated with 
Springsteen's view of America a lot more than Americans are. American 
themes and images might be more exciting to those who find these things 
new and different. This could be especially true now that the America of
 today is increasingly different from the one that Springsteen mapped 
out during his glory days. Perhaps when Americans search Springsteen's 
most commercially digestible music (which inevitably is his older music)
 for something familiar to relate to, they are less often finding what 
they are looking for. On the other hand, a non-American might be 
attracted by Springsteen's classic American images and not mind, or even
 be aware, that some of them are becoming a little outdated. Or is does 
the answer lie in a deteriorating of belief in the American dream among 
the American music- buying audience? If one looks at much of the music 
that has dominated the popular music scene over the last decade in 
America, one sees that much of the politically responsive music is 
rather negative in its message, be it rap, grunge, or any of the various
 sub-genres and development of heavy metal. Certainly, these music forms
 are popular in Europe as well, but not quite to the same degree as in 
the States. Might this indicate that young Americans have lost their 
faith in the dreams and values that Springsteen stands for? 
Alternatively, a third and more political explanation might be more 
likely. Could it be that Springsteen's mildly populist message finds 
more sympathy in Europe, where there is traditionally wider popular 
support for socialism, than in the more conservative America? Whatever 
the reasons for his success abroad, as well as at home, Springsteen has 
managed to take a generous slice of universal life philosophy sprung 
from broken and fulfilled American dreams, and deliver it to millions of
 fans all over the world. <br>
<br>
If Bruce Springsteen is indeed the ultimate American artist, what does 
that mean? As a pop culture figure, Springsteen among the celebrities 
who is most firmly and instantly associated with America. Springsteen 
represents his country to the rest of the world. And if Bruce 
Springsteen is the archetype of what "an American" means to the rest of 
the world, it must be said that he is a positive role model and valuable
 "cultural ambassador" for his country. He gives voice to the 
downtrodden, while not forgetting how to live and love life. He is 
brutally aware of his country's shortcomings and problems, but continues
 to represent the good things about America. He gives Americans reason 
to take pride in their country, but also informed and wary of its 
negative sides. He gives all his fans around the world reason to be 
proud for their individual struggles, rejoice for their victories, and 
hope for the best that the future can offer. <br>
<br>
Notes <br>
<br>
The Presidents alledged words were:"America's future lies in a thousand 
dreams inside your hearts. It rests in the message of hope in songs of a
 man so many Americans admire: New Jersey's own Bruce Springsteen. And 
helping you make those dreams come true is what this job of mine is all 
about." (cited in Lynch 119) <br>
Interestingly enough, one of the alternative titles considered for this album was American Madness. <br>
The bulk of Springsteen's lyrics of officially released songs is 
collected in a book called Songs, which also includes Springsteen's own 
thoughts about his individual albums. All lyrics cited in this paper can
 be found in this book, and also in the booklets that accompany 
individual albums. <br>
Baker is, of course referring to black saxophonist Clarence Clemmons AKA
 "Big Man". In the concert context, Clemmons' role was as much onstage 
sidekick as musical instrumentalist and his very black presence in front
 of a almost all-white audience was "as enticing as it is threatening" 
(Marsh BTR 3) With this in mind, one can argue that The River is 
Springsteen's most defining album (although probably not his best). The 
album is characterized by its wide reach of songs and emotions. The 
River has a wide selection of both rockers, pop songs, and ballads. More
 essentially, the various songs deal with both the need to break away 
and move on, the importance of community and the dangers of isolation. 
Most of Springsteen's other albums have been more one sided, presenting a
 narrower view of life. <br>
For example, as a European having lived in Norway and England, I was 
astounded at meeting people in America who disregarded Darwinian 
Evolution in favor of a more religious creation explanation. <br>
"Growin' Up" was frequently played live and was often highlighted by a 
monlogue in the middle of the song. These stories were usually of a 
light-hearted, goofy nature; and in their various incarnations, included
 adventures with gypsy women, UFOs, teenage werewolves and dancing 
bears. The culminating message of each story is always the jubliant 
glory of Rock and Roll. <br>

The United States was traumatized by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.<br>
The nation was forever changed and had to somehow recover from the worst
 attack ever on U.S. soil. The healing came in many forms including 
renditions of “God Bless America” at the World Series and candlelight 
vigils for those lost in the World Trade<br>
Center collapse. Healing also came in the form of Bruce Springsteen’s album The Rising.<br>
Springsteen reported a fan saw him one day after the attacks and said, “We need you<br>
now” (Volpe, 2002, para. 2). The result of this plea was an album that celebrated the<br>
heroes whose lives were lost and that offered hope for the future through faith in God<br>
each other. Using principles of media literacy as a framework, this paper will deconstruct<br>
The Rising, discuss how Springsteen’s music helped heal the wounds inflicted by the<br>
terrorists, and explore the impact of the media’s coverage of Springsteen’s album on the nation’s healing.<br>
<br>
MEDIA LITERACY AND DECONSTRUCTION AS FRAMEWORK<br>
<br>
Media literacy defined<br>
<br>
In order to formally analyze The Rising, a framework of analysis is necessary;<br>
therefore, this discussion will be guided by the principles of media 
literacy. According to the Aspen Institute’s Report of the National 
Leadership Conference on Media Literacy, a media literate person—and 
everyone should have the opportunity to become one—can decode, evaluate,
 analyze and produce both print and electronic media.<br>
<br>
The fundamental objective of media literacy is critical autonomy in relationship to<br>
all media. Emphases in media literacy training range widely, including informed<br>
citizenship, aesthetic appreciation and expression, social advocacy, self-esteem,<br>
and consumer competence (Aufderheide, 1993, p. 1).<br>
<br>
Deconstruction defined<br>
<br>
The concepts of decoding, evaluation, and analysis are incorporated into a basic<br>
media literacy skill known as “deconstruction.” The New Mexico Media Literacy<br>
Project1 (NMMLP) has defined deconstruction as “the careful and close analysis of a<br>
piece of media, looking beneath the surface (the characters, plot, language, etc.) to<br>
understand its deeper meanings” (New Mexico Media Literacy Project, 2005b, para. 1).<br>
One of the basic elements of media literacy is that each person 
constructs his/her meaning from media messages; therefore, there is no 
specific formula for deconstructing a media example. However, NMMLP 
offers several questions that help guide the deconstruction process. 
These questions include:<br>
Who paid for the media? Why?<br>
Who is being targeted?<br>
What text, images or sounds lead you to this conclusion<br>
What is the text (literal meaning) of the message?<br>
What is the subtext (unstated or underlying message)?<br>
What kind of lifestyle is presented? Is it glamorized? How?<br>
What values are expressed?<br>
What tools or techniques of persuasion are used?<br>
What story is not being told?<br>
In what ways is this a healthy and/or unhealthy media message? <br>
<br>
<br>
Several of these questions will guide the deconstruction of 
Springsteen’s Grammy award winning album and provide context for 
understanding how his work helped offer healing to a terrorized nation.<br>
<br>
DECONSTRUCTION AT WORK<br>
<br>
The Rising: An overall review<br>
<br>
The process of deconstruction is at work in many of the rock critics’ reviews of<br>
Springsteen’s album. One critic wrote, “The Rising…is Bruce 
Springsteen’s way of using rock music for healing and remembering” 
(Bird, 2002, para. 2). A closer examination of each track on the album 
offers insight into the text and subtext of the messages Springsteen 
conveys. <br>
<br>
One could argue that three themes run throughout the entire album:<br>
<br>
1) the terror attacks of 9/11; 2) the aftermath; and 3) hope for the 
future. Several of thetracks incorporate all three themes, which speaks 
to Springsteen’s talent as a storytellerand his ability to infuse hope 
in spite of perilous times.<br>
The usual rock critics weighed in on the merit of Springsteen’s first full studio<br>
album with the E Street Band since 1984’s Born in the U.S.A., and the overwhelming<br>
majority had high praise for the Jersey Shore icon and his pals. Kurt Loder of Rolling<br>
Stone mused that the prospect of pop stars weighing in on the terrorist attacks to<br>
somehow translate the horror of that fateful day into something beyond “dismal<br>
trivialization” was a scary thought (Loder, 2002, p. 81). However, 
Springsteen was ableto capture the horror of the event and give hope for
 the future.<br>
<br>
With his new album, The Rising, Springsteen wades into the wreckage and pain of<br>
that horrendous event and emerges bearing fifteen songs that genuflect with<br>
enormous grace before the sorrows that drift in its wake. The small miracle of his<br>
accomplishment is that at no point does he give vent to the anger felt by so many<br>
Americans: the hunger for revenge. The music is often fierce in its execution, but<br>
in essence it is a requiem for those who perished in that sudden inferno, and those<br>
who died trying to save them. Springsteen grandly salutes their innocence and<br>
their courage, and holds out a hand to those who mourn them, who seek the<br>
comfort of an explanation for the inexplicable (Loder, 2002, p. 81).<br>
<br>
The tracks<br>
<br>
The following paragraphs attempt to answer two questions that are part of the<br>
deconstruction process: 1) What is the text (literal meaning) of the message? and<br>
2) What is the subtext (unstated or underlying message)?<br>
<br>
“Lonesome Day” (track 1) opens The Rising in a moody yet uplifting way. Stout<br>
(2002) describes the cut as “a tremendous track that talks of the need for fortitude and<br>
resiliency when dealing with heartache. Its burning guitars and gospel-like backing<br>
vocals help make it one of the album’s most stirring numbers” (para. 3).
 The lyrics are an artful example of how the three themes noted above 
are all weaved into one track.<br>
Springsteen conjures up images of the destruction of 9/11, speaks to the lonely days<br>
afterwards, and renews faith and hope because the “lonesome day” will soon pass.<br>
Hell's brewin' dark sun's on the rise/This storm'll blow through by and by/House<br>
is on fire, Viper's in the grass/A little revenge and this too shall pass/This too shall<br>
pass, I'm gonna pray/Right now all I got's this lonesome day (Springsteen, 2002g).<br>
<br>
“Into the Fire,” which is track two on the album, directly addresses the attack on<br>
the Twin Towers and acknowledges the courage of the rescue workers who sacrificed<br>
themselves to save others (Loder, 2002). Springsteen had planned to sing
 this song on theAmerica: A Tribute to Heroes telethon, but at the last 
minute decided it was not quite ready for a live performance. Instead, 
he elected to sing “My City of Ruins,” the final cut on this album, 
which he had written a few years earlier but was fitting for the 
occasion (Cherry, 2002).<br>
<br>
“Into the Fire” starts out with the simplicity of a white-gospel hymn (“I need your<br>
kiss/But love and duty called you someplace higher”), then blossoms into a<br>
luminous anthem: “May your strength give us strength/May your faith give us<br>
faith/May your hope give us hope/May your love bring us love” (Loder, 2002, p.<br>
82).<br>
<br>
“It is the one song that turns prayerful and evokes images of a litany 
of the saints as he sings about the ones who have gone ‘someplace 
higher’” (Kelly, 2003, para. 14).<br>
<br>
“Waitin’ on a Sunny Day” (track 3) is an upbeat sing-a-long cut that is a “carefree<br>
celebration of the things that deliver us from sadness and pain” 
(French, 2002, para. 14)  It's rainin' but there ain't a cloud in the 
sky/Musta been a tear from your<br>
eye/Everything'll be okay/Funny thought I felt a sweet summer breeze/Musta<br>
been you sighin' so deep/Don't worry we're gonna find a way/I'm waitin', waitin'<br>
on a sunny day/Gonna chase the clouds away/Waitin' on a sunny day<br>
(Springsteen, 2002m).<br>
Lyrically this may not be Springsteen’s most innovative, but the cut 
offers up the hope for the future that underlies almost every track on 
the album. The “faux-Mellencamp instrumentation and poppy feel is a 
welcome relief from the album’s more heavy side and reminds us of 
music’s ability to lift one’s spirits (French, 2002, para. 14).<br>
<br>
On “Nothing Man,” track four of the album, Springsteen paints a picture of an<br>
unassuming small-town man who has trouble dealing with the notoriety of 
his heroic acts after September 11th. “The character, however—forever 
changed by what he’s<br>
experienced—is uninterested in such back patting and feels frustrated at
 the quick return to normalcy within his community” (Stout, 2002, para. 
4).<br>
<br>
Track five, “Countin’ On a Miracle,” introduces a husband who has hopes of<br>
reuniting with his deceased wife (Segal, 2002). On this track 
Springsteen juxtaposes an upbeat, hard-rocking musical arrangement with 
tragic lyrics. Yet, the underlying theme that comes through is one of 
optimism. The husband says the fairytale is over, but he will keep on 
living for his wife in spite of her departure from this world.<br>
I'm runnin' through the forest/With this wolf at my heels/My king is lost at<br>
midnight/When the tower bells peal/We've got no fairytale ending/In God's hands<br>
our fate is complete/Your heaven's here in my heart/Our love's this dust beneath<br>
my feet/Just this dust beneath my feet/If I'm gonna live /I'll life my life/Darlin' to<br>
you (Springsteen, 2002a).<br>
<br>
The title of track six, “Empty Sky,” is a literal reflection of what Springsteen saw<br>
from near his home in Rumson, New Jersey. Springsteen told ABC’s Ted Koppel in an interview on Nightline,<br>
…there was a bridge that you can see the World Trade Centers from. We’re<br>
actually only 10 or 15 miles from downtown New York here. It’s very close by<br>
water. And you cross this little bridge. And they always sat—they sat dead in the<br>
middle of it. And so towards the end of the day we got in the car and took a—you<br>
know, drove over it and they were gone, you know. And it made—somehow there<br>
was a realism from the TV images (ABC News, 2002).<br>
Loder (2002) interpreted “Empty Sky” as an acknowledgment of the rage many<br>
New Yorkers felt after the collapse of Manhattan’s two towering landmarks: “I want a<br>
kiss from your lips/I want an eye for an eye/I woke up this morning to an empty sky.”<br>
Springsteen, however, commented that the lyrics should not be 
interpreted as a desire forrevenge, only a feeling of frustration and 
loss (ABC News, 2002).<br>
<br>
The most common interpretation placed upon “World’s Apart,” the seventh track<br>
on the album, is that of a relationship between a man and a woman from different<br>
cultures (Pyndus, 2002). With the integration of qawwali singer Asif Ali Khan and a<br>
Pakistani choir along with infectious chanting, this song conjures up images of love<br>
between an American solider and an Islamic woman (Browne, 2002). “Practically<br>
pleading with his lover, ‘may the living let us in before the dead tear us apart’,<br>
Springsteen acknowledges the uphill battle facing couples of different 
backgrounds whilehis guitar screams in frustration” (Pyndus, 2002, para.
 9).<br>
<br>
Rhythmically and lyrically track eight, “Let’s Be Friends (Skin to Skin),” is more<br>
akin to “Waitin’ On a Sunny Day.” It is an upbeat sing-a-long track that
 is enjoyable tolisten to, but Pyndus (2002) suggested it did not fit 
with the other songs on the album. Although the lyrics suggest the 
coming together of two individuals, even on a sexual level, one could 
also interpret the call to be friends as a plea for the coming together 
ofnations (Cherry, 2002).<br>
<br>
“Further On (Up the Road)” (track 9) was played during the 1999/2000 Reunion<br>
Tour; however, it works on this album because it speaks to overcoming dark days and<br>
rising above (“One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know” (Springsteen, 2002c)) further on<br>
down the road of life. “If there's a light up ahead well brother I don't
 know/But I got this fever burnin' in my soul/So let's take the good 
times as they go/And I'll meet you furtheron up the road” (Springsteen, 
2002c).<br>
<br>
“The Fuse” (track 10) is a sexually charged piece that “is about making a physical<br>
connection in the face of emotional despair” (Cherry, 2002, para. 7). 
This track, like most of the others on the album, creates imagery of the
 tragedy with lines like “Trees on fire with the first fall's frost/Long
 black line in front of Holy Cross/Blood moon risin' in a sky of black 
dust” (Springsteen, 2002d). Springsteen stays true to the themes of the 
album throughout the work.<br>
<br>
“Mary’s Place” (track 11) is an upbeat rock song that deals with finding happiness<br>
in the face of sorrow. The central character has lost a loved one but is
 trying to overcome the grief by being with friends and enjoying life 
again while still holding on to the memories of the one who has passed 
(Sterdan, 2002).<br>
I got seven pictures of Buddha/The prophet's on my tongue/Eleven angels of<br>
mercy/Sighin' over that black hole in the sun/My heart's dark but it's risin'/I'm<br>
pullin' all the faith I can see/From that black hole on the horizon/I hear your voice<br>
calling me/Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain/Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it<br>
rain/Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party/Meet me at Mary's place,<br>
we're gonna have a party/Tell me how do we get this thing started/Meet me at<br>
Mary's place (Springsteen, 2002h).<br>
<br>
“You’re Missing” (track 12) details the human emotions of a woman coping with<br>
the loss of her husband who perished in the World Trade Center collapse.
 This poignant selection is one of the few tracks that is devoid of hope
 for better days. The overarching theme of the album, to rise above, is 
“missing.” The absence of optimism on this track speaks to the hurt and 
angst of so many who lost loved ones in the attacks. The rawness of the 
song reflects the raw emotions that come with loss.<br>
Pictures on the nightstand, TV's on in the den/Your house is waiting, your house<br>
is waiting/For you to walk in, for you to walk in/But you're missing, you're<br>
missing/You're missing when I shut out the lights/You're missing when I close my<br>
eyes/You're missing when I see the sun rise/You're missing (Springsteen, 2002o).<br>
<br>
The title track of The Rising (track 13) captures all three themes with eloquence<br>
and force. The song acknowledges the sacrifice of a New York firefighter
 who perishes after entering the towers to try and save those trapped 
inside. However, Springsteen moves from a dark opening into “a 
hand-clapping, sanctified chorus, as the literal image  of a man rising 
up a smoke-filled stairwell merges into a religious image of ascension” 
(Binelli, 2002, p. 64). Springsteen said he was trying to describe the 
most powerful images of 9/11 and the one that stuck in his mind was that
 of the rescuers ascending the stairs of the Twin Towers. Ted Koppel 
suggested Springsteen might have had the resurrection in mind. 
Springsteen responded:<br>
<br>
…I was a good Catholic boy when I was little, and so those images for me are<br>
always very close and they explain a lot about—a lot about life. And I knew—<br>
well I was trying to describe the most powerful images of the 11th, and that I’d<br>
read in the paper, was when some of the people coming down talked about the<br>
emergency workers who were ascending. And, you know, that—that image to me<br>
was just what—what I—an image I just felt left with after that particular day, the<br>
idea of those guys going up the stairs, up the stairs, ascending, ascending. They<br>
could be ascending a smoky staircase, you could be in the afterlife, moving—<br>
moving on (ABC News, 2002).<br>
<br>
One of the most celebrated tracks on the album is “Paradise” (track 14). Segal<br>
(2002) called the track “the album's most shattering, challenging moment” (p. A17).<br>
Springsteen sings from the point of view of a female suicide bomber in 
the first part of the song. The bomber is ready to sacrifice herself and
 all the others around her so she can reach what she thinks will be 
heaven: “In the crowded marketplace/I drift from face to face/I hold my 
breath and close my eyes/I hold my breath and close my eyes/And I wait 
for paradise/And I wait for paradise” (Gardner, 2002; Springsteen, 
2002k). In the second verse of the song the central character becomes a 
woman who lost her husband in the Pentagon attack (Gardner, 2002). 
Springsteen sings of someone who has suffered loss  and is left behind 
in the final verse of the track. The character in the third verse 
attempts to commit suicide by drowning him/herself in the river because 
he/she is so distraught over the loss of his/her beloved: “I sink 'neath
 the river cool and clear/Drifting down I disappear/I see you on the 
other side/I search for the peace in your eyes/But they're as empty as 
paradise/They're as empty as paradise” (Springsteen, 2002k). Yet, he/she
 aborts his/her attempt to kill him/herself because he/she realizes 
paradise is troubled, too.<br>
<br>
Springsteen summed up “Paradise” as follows:<br>
“So you have these two vignettes from completely different places. Then in the<br>
third verse, I imagined someone who had been left. The person goes into the river<br>
and goes under—and comes back up. It’s like saying, ‘We’re still here, and this is<br>
the only life we have’” (Gardner, 2002, p. 1D).<br>
<br>
“My City of Ruins” (track 15), a song that was written about Springsteen’s<br>
adopted hometown of Asbury Park, NJ, aptly closes out the album. 
Although the original intent of the song was to gain support for 
rebuilding and revitalizing the struggling Jersey shore city, the lyrics
 are easily transferred and conjure up reflections of the devastation of
 9/11. However, Springsteen ends the track with the uplifting and 
inspirational message that he has weaved throughout the album. He “urges
 his audience to summon the courage and faith to move forward and to 
‘rise up’” (French, 2002, para. 15). Despite being written well before 
the tragic event, “My City of Ruins” is a fitting song to close out this
 tribute to the heroes of September 11th and instill hope and faith for 
the future.<br>
<br>
The working class and religious images still resonate<br>
<br>
Deconstruction questions like “What kind of lifestyle is presented?” and “What<br>
values are expressed?” are useful in helping understand if there is a negative<br>
glamorization of certain lifestyles and values. One could argue with 
little opposition that the lifestyles and values Springsteen sings about
 on The Rising and on most every other album is quite positive and 
representative of many hard working blue collar Americans.<br>
<br>
Throughout his career Springsteen has written many songs about the 
working class. Hehas tunes that deal with police officers, fire 
fighters, factory workers, migrant day<br>
laborers, construction workers, and steelworkers (Tyrangiel, 2002). 
While Springsteen knows little about a 40-hour work week, he does know 
how it makes a person feel. While growing up he watched his father toil 
day in and day out and saw the toll a working man’s life can take on a 
person. But, Springsteen found faith and hope in his mother, an eternal 
optimist. It is this optimism that comes through loud and clear in his 
music. While the events of September 11th were horrific, Springsteen 
somehow managed on The Rising to take such a tragedy and offer hope for 
those working folks whose lives were forever changed because of those 
hijacked planes (Tyrangiel, 2002). <br>
<br>
“The songs are sad, but the sadness is almost always matched with 
optimism, promises of redemption and calls to spiritual arms. There is 
more rising on The Rising than in a month of church” (Tyrangiel,<br>
2002, p. 53).<br>
<br>
The redemption and call to spiritual arms permeates throughout The Rising. In<br>
fact, religious images and issues of faith and meaning the most 
explicitly religious imagery of any of his work to date: “precious 
blood,”<br>
“holy cross,” “the cross of my calling,” “pearl and silver” (i.e., the rosary), “Mary<br>
in the garden,” “holy pictures,” along with references to God and the devil, and<br>
the interreligious “seven pictures of Buddha,” “the prophet’s on my tongue” and<br>
“seven days, seven candles” (Kelly, 2003, para. 11).<br>
Even though Springsteen is a non-practicing Catholic, the religious 
values he was taught as a child continue to influence him. On The Rising
 he does not support one type of religion, but rather invokes a 
universal spirituality that encompasses all religions, all peoples. The 
values of faith, hope, love, and peace poignantly manifest themselves on
 “Worlds Apart.”<br>
<br>
Images of tenderness that two lovers experience, who at the same time “stand<br>
worlds apart,” shift to the larger world stage and a plea that those of us who are<br>
living might be able to make some connection with one another, so that that<br>
painful memories around loss of life do not serve to increase hatred and violence<br>
(Kelly, 2003, para. 18).<br>
A healthy media message in a greater collage Most rock music critics heralded Springsteen’s album with high praise and<br>
applauded its ability to capture the emotions of 9/11 while offering 
some sense of hope for the future. For all intents and purposes, the 
message of The Rising was a healthy media message, one that was embraced
 by legions of Americans. However, true deconstruction of this work 
would be remiss to discount other interpretations. <br>
<br>
Dissentersof Springsteen’s work on The Rising existed; most often 
critics took issue with individual songs, whether lyrically or 
musically, as opposed to the album as a whole (Cherry, 2002; French, 
2002; Loder, 2002; Petridis, 2002; Pyndus 2002; Tyrangiel, 2002). For 
instance, French (2002) took issue with “Countin’ On a Miracle.” “Maybe 
the fairy-tale imagery of the album’s worst track, the overly sappy 
“Countin’ On a Miracle,” would have been more acceptable had it been 
released immediately after 9/11, but its magic certainly isn’t working 
now” (para. 9). Cherry (2002) noted several flaws of the album. “Tracks 
like “Mary’s Place” (surefire concert favorite) and “Waitin’ On a Sunny 
Day” are undercut by joining downbeat lyrics with upbeat rhythms—a 
mistake also made on Born in the U.S.A.” (Cherry, 2002, para. 13). 
Petridis (2002) laments that Springsteen’s imagery is repetitive.<br>
…but here the repetitions are highlighted by their proximity. A song in which the<br>
streets are cloudy with dust and flowing with blood, and the sky is empty and<br>
crying, is followed by a song in which the sky is cloudy with dust and raining<br>
blood, and the streets are empty and crying (Petridis, 2002, para. 6).<br>
<br>
Pyndus (2002) suggested “Let’s Be Friends” was wrong for the album. “The song that<br>
sticks out like a sore thumb, both musically and thematically, is “Let’s
 Be Friends (Skin to Skin),” a sunny sing-a-long that’s fun to listen 
to, almost recalling the Jackson 5, but just doesn’t fit here” (Pyndus, 
2002, para. <img class="smilies" src="_assets/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" width="15" height="15">.
 Despite such critical comments, it was difficult to identify critics 
who did not laud Springsteen for a sincere work that tried to capture 
the horror of 9/11 while conjuring up faith for better days ahead. 
Sanchez (2002) took issue, not so much with Springsteen’s work, but with
 the accolades bestowed on The Rising by the leading rock critics around
 the nation.<br>
<br>
Like near-sighted lemmings, the critics rushed to applaud The Rising, giving little<br>
attention to the work of other artists addressing 9/11, as if Springsteen ushered in<br>
a new era of musical social criticism or a more valid musical witness to 9/11. A<br>
form of cultural imperialism, this universal praise underlines the serious lack of<br>
diversity within circles of popular music critics (Sanchez, 2002, para. 1).<br>
Sanchez (2002) commented that turning off The Rising before the record is<br>
finished is a selfish act because there is emotional guilt for not 
hearing out the stories of those whose lives were touched so tragically 
by the events of that fateful Tuesday.<br>
A sort of emotional blackmail, the record does not belong to Bruce or the E Street<br>
Band, it belongs to the wives, sons, daughters, brothers, friends, and families of<br>
those who now celebrate an anniversary of loss every September 11th (Sanchez,<br>
2002, para. 5).<br>
<br>
Although attempting to illustrate that the record may not live up to the
 high praise from all of the critics, Sanchez makes a profound point in 
favor of the album. It is not<br>
Springsteen’s voice that is heard, it is those who lost their 
colleagues, friends, and loved ones. It is the voices of those who 
relive that horror each day that ring loud and clear through his music.<br>
<br>
The one point that Sanchez (2002) made that does resonate and is important in the<br>
deconstruction of this body of work is that The Rising is not the only 
attempt, maybe not even the best attempt, to put some sort of meaning on
 such senseless acts of violence.<br>
<br>
Other artists offered their interpretations, and for many these works 
offered healing in the wake of the emotional wounds left by the collapse
 of those giant pillars of American commerce. Outkast, Toby Keith, Alan 
Jackson, Anti-Flag, Neil Young, Paul McCartney  and Steve Earle were 
among several who weighed in on that day of reckoning (Sanchez, 2002). 
In sum, Sanchez (2002) argued that The Rising is just one piece of the 
popular music puzzle that responded to September 11th.<br>
<br>
The Rising is an attempted portrait of a defining moment in American history.<br>
Critics would say it is the most true to life portrait produced thus far. But to<br>
believe this one recording captures that day is to be stuck in a vacuum, unable to<br>
turn off the television, leave the room, peer out the window and see that life goes<br>
on. Such acclaim further conditions acceptable responses, reactions, and<br>
emotions. If The Rising is the defining response to 9/11 within popular music,<br>
then there has been no distance gained for reflection and dissent is something best<br>
not discussed. Despite the critic's words, The Rising is merely a good starting<br>
point in regards to responses within popular music to 9/11. Think of it as another<br>
piece in a greater collage (Sanchez, 2002, para. 7).<br>
<br>
National media coverage spotlights the work but creates skeptics<br>
<br>
As part of the deconstruction process it is important to examine the target<br>
audience of the mediated message. The audience for The Rising, one might argue, is<br>
epitomized in Rumson, New Jersey, resident Edwin R. Sutphin, Jr. He is the man who<br>
crossed paths with the Boss in a nightclub parking lot in Sea Bright, 
New Jersey, and sent out his plea, “We need you now,” just after the 
9/11 tragedy (Volpe, 2002, para. 2). Sutphin had lost his childhood 
friend, David Bauer, who worked on the 105th floor of the north tower of
 the World Trade Center (Volpe, 2002). Sutphin in many ways represents 
every person who lost a loved one in the attacks or who was touched by 
the <br>
tragedy Springsteen’s album was for everyone because it offered comfort and hope. <br>
<br>
“’His(Springsteen’s) music is one of the things that I think has helped 
me through this whole ordeal,’ Sutphin, said. ‘I really respect what 
he’s done for the community and the metropolitan area and the country’” 
(Volpe, 2002, para. 7).<br>
Springsteen, who in earlier years was reluctant to give a lot of interviews, took a<br>
new approach to marketing The Rising. Not since 1984’s Born in the U.S.A. had<br>
Springsteen targeted mainstream America so heavily.<br>
Here, after decades of relative reclusiveness, Springsteen was suddenly<br>
everywhere in the mass media: taking over the Today show in Asbury Park, on<br>
David Letterman two nights in a row, ditto Ted Koppel, on MTV, VH1, Saturday<br>
Night Live, simultaneous covers of Time and Rolling Stone, long interviews with<br>
the New York Times, the LA Times, and USA Today (Alterman, 2004, p. 374).<br>
<br>
The massive media coverage of the release of The Rising had skeptics questioning<br>
Springsteen’s motive behind the album. Such skepticism is, in essence, healthy media<br>
literacy deconstruction at work. A media literate consumer should ask 
who is paying for the media message, what does the producer of the 
message want to get out of the<br>
promotion of the message, and how sincere is the message in light of heavy mass<br>
marketing to the American public? Alterman (2004) argues that “the 
dilemma for anyone who seeks to use popular culture to communicate a 
message at odds with its marketdriven heart of darkness is: who’s using 
whom?” (p. 374). Springsteen was questioned on the Today show about the 
fact that some might suggest he was exploiting the tragedy. Hisresponse 
was that each person should listen to the music and make up his/her own 
mind<br>
<br>
(Alterman, 2004). Alterman (2004) agreed:<br>
<br>
The answer has to be a personal one. In Asbury Park, I did some random<br>
interviewing of people who had traveled many hours, and waited on overnight<br>
lines, in the hope of seeing Springsteen perform four songs in the Convention Hall<br>
for the Today broadcast. I spoke to a firefighter who had gone into the burning<br>
buildings, a 16-year-old girl who was repaying her mom for waiting 10 hours on<br>
line to get ‘NSync tickets, a woman with her 5-year-old son, who back in ’85,<br>
enlisted her entire family in a week-long wait for tickets. Nobody mentioned the<br>
media. Nobody mentioned the marketing campaign. Nobody complained about<br>
the all-night wait and the uncertainty that they would be allowed inside the hall.<br>
They were there for Bruce because Bruce was there for them (p. 375).<br>
<br>
If anything the media coverage contributed to the healing process because it<br>
exposed more and more people to the work that Springsteen and his band mates had<br>
created. The tragedy was dealt with in a sincere and meaningful way, and
 offered a way for individuals to cope and find strength to move forward
 by keeping the faith.<br>
Springsteen’s perspective reveals sincerity To further illustrate the 
sincerity of Springsteen’s work and to discount those skeptics that 
suggested Springsteen exploited a national tragedy for his own gain, 
additional deconstruction will provide a better understanding of 
Springsteen’s perspective when he wrote The Rising. <br>
<br>
Although the notion of perspective is not overtly identified as<br>
a deconstruction question by the NMMLP, it is embedded in almost all of the queries<br>
suggested by the media literacy activist organization. Knowing something about<br>
Springsteen’s perspective when he wrote most of the songs on the album 
provides a much clearer understanding of the literal and underlying 
messages.<br>
<br>
In the days that followed the hijacked planes hitting the World Trade Center,<br>
Springsteen opened the America: A Tribute to Heroes telethon with “My 
City of Ruins,” as noted above. He played a few other local benefit 
concerts, but basically grieved like everyone else (Tyrangiel, 2002). 
However, the inspiration for songs seemed to come afterSpringsteen read 
several obituaries in the New York Times about those who lost their 
livesin the tragedy. He found the New York Times obituaries “‘to be 
very, very meaningful--incredibly powerful’” (Tyrangiel, 2002, p. 56). <br>
<br>
Springsteen noticed that many of the victims had one of his songs played
 at their memorial service or they had a stack of old Springsteen 
concert tickets they had been keeping in a closet or drawer. With his 
inspiration for song writing elevated, Springsteen turned into a 
reporter to better understand the intimacies of September 11th. 
Springsteen called several of the victims’ families to find out more 
about their loved ones. <br>
<br>
Joe Farrelly was a fire fighter for Manhattan Engine Co. 4 and a 
lifelong Springsteen fan. His widow, Stacey, got a call from Springsteen
 after he had read about Joe in the New York Times. “They talked for 
40minutes. ‘After I got off the phone with him, the world just felt a 
little smaller. I gotthrough Joe’s memorial and a good month and a half 
on that phone call’” (Tyrangiel,2002, p. 56). <br>
<br>
Springsteen wanted no accolades for being a kind-hearted human being, 
buthis conversation with Stacey Farrelly and others helped shape the 
album and gave a moreintimate portrait of the courage and bravery and 
humanness of those that sacrificed theirlives to save others. Suzanne 
Berger, who lost her husband, Jim, spoke with Springsteenand recounted 
how Jim had rescued dozens of people from the south tower before it 
eventually collapsed on him. These stories were among the many that gave
 Springsteen direction on the album.<br>
<br>
In terms of deconstruction, it is clear that Springsteen’s intention was not to<br>
capitalize monetarily on this tragedy of epic proportions. Some were 
uncomfortable with marketing the album as a September 11th album and 
having it come on the heels of the tragedy, but Springsteen addressed 
this charge and reiterated his sincerity in this album as well as all of
 his others.<br>
<br>
“When you’re putting yourself into shoes you haven’t worn, you have to be very<br>
… just very thoughtful, is the way that I’d put it. Just thoughtful. You call on your<br>
craft, and you go searching for it, and hopefully what makes people listen is that<br>
over the years you’ve been serious and honest. That’s where your creative<br>
authority comes from. That’s how people know you’re not just taking a ride”<br>
(Tyrangiel, 2002, p. 58).<br>
<br>
Springsteen truly wanted to pay tribute to the heroes and their families and offer<br>
them hope the best way he knew how: through the message of song. In his songs,<br>
Springsteen was poignant, realistic, and inspirational. His album helped
 with the healing process not only for the families, but for the nation 
as well.<br>
<br>
CONCLUSION<br>
<br>
As noted early in this discussion, one of the fundamental elements of media<br>
literacy is that an individual constructs his/her own meaning from a media message.<br>
There is no right or wrong when it comes to deconstruction, but 
effective deconstruction is guided by universal questions that offer a 
systematic framework for decoding, evaluating, and analyzing media 
messages. Several of these basic deconstruction queries have been 
diligently applied here in hopes of gaining a better understanding of 
the impact and influence of Springsteen’s work. <br>
<br>
Whether other conclusions about Springsteen’s album, The Rising, are 
consistent or divergent with those offered here is not an issue; themore
 important issue is that effective media literacy skills have been 
employed and that evaluation and analysis has taken place to, hopefully,
 help foster a more media literate society.<br>
<br>
An overall summation of this deconstruction suggests that the message<br>
Springsteen brought to the American people was sincere, healthy, and 
rich with universal values of faith, hope, and love. Unlike other 
mediated messages that have hiddenmeanings and agendas, Springsteen’s 
work was clearly an artist’s answer to a call from his audience to help 
them cope with the worst terrorist attack on American soil in history.<br>
<br>
His artistry was reflective, touching, and hopeful. Despite those who 
criticized his mass marketing efforts, it was these efforts that brought
 his music to the American public and gave them the opportunity to 
listen and to heal.</div>

Jersey Boys<br>
<br>
The governor and the Boss—a tale of politics, rock and roll, and unrequited love<br>
<br>
By JEFFREY GOLDBERG<br>
<br>
CHRIS CHRISTIE IS, even in moments of tranquility—of which, in his life,
 there seem to be none—a torqued-up, joyously belligerent, easily 
baited, and preternaturally exuberant son of New Jersey, so bringing him
 to a Bruce Springsteen concert is an exercise in volcano management. 
Christie, in the presence of Springsteen—whom he would marry if he were 
gay and if gay people were allowed to marry in the state he 
governs—loses himself. He is, as is well known, a very large man—twice 
the width of Mitt Romney—but he is a very large man who dances at 
Springsteen concerts in front of many thousands of people without giving
 a damn what they think.<br>
<br>
We are in a luxury suite at the Prudential Center—the Rock—in downtown 
Newark, the sort of suite accessible only to the American plutocracy, 
from which Springsteen seems to draw a surprisingly large proportion of 
his most devoted fans. (I know of three separate groups of 
one-percenters who recently flew in private jets to see Springsteen 
perform at Madison Square Garden.) Certainly not many residents of 
Newark could afford such a box, and the shrimp and steak that come with 
it. Christie’s bodyguards from the New Jersey State Police—he will 
sometimes play aloud on his iPhone Springsteen’s haunting and paranoid 
“State Trooper” while being driven by state troopers—keep the governor 
out of the cheap seats, where he says he’d rather be. Of course, he’s 
not opposed to upmarket seating and grilled shrimp—he’s a vociferous 
free-marketeer, who, for good reason, is a hero to the hedge-fund 
grandees across the river. He just likes mixing it up with his 
constituents, several of whom, by the smell of it, are enjoying 
high-quality New Jersey marijuana right below us.<br>
<br>
People see him out at the edge of the box, and they cheer his dancing 
and call him vice president (for what it’s worth, he told me he’s not 
really interested in the job: “I’d rather be here in New Jersey and be 
governor, but obviously if Governor Romney calls and wants to talk about
 it, I owe it to him to listen”), and they rain down curses on his 
political enemies. Many fans also give Christie grief for an incident 
that took place three weeks earlier, when a photograph of the governor 
apparently sleeping through a Springsteen song—an affecting, elegiac 
song called “Rocky Ground,” from his new, fuming-mad anti–Wall Street 
album, Wrecking Ball—at the Garden pinged around the Internet.<br>
<br>
“Hey, Governor, where’s your pillow?” someone from an upper deck 
screams. It is the sort of taunt he should obviously ignore, but 
Christie is incapable of being anything other than his obstreperous 
self. He screams back, “I didn’t fall asleep! How could you even believe
 that?” He turns to me. “How could they believe that? I was meditating. 
It’s a very spiritual song.” I believe him. I’ve spent much of my life 
as a pro-Springsteen extremist (defined here as someone who has spent an
 unconscionable amount of money on Springsteen tickets and also refuses 
to contemplate the notion that Bob Dylan might be the better writer), 
and I have met very few people who love Springsteen the way Christie 
loves Springsteen.<br>
<br>
This concert is the 129th the governor has attended. His four children 
all went to Springsteen shows in utero. He knows every word to every 
Springsteen song. He dreams of playing drums in the E Street Band. 
People like Chris Christie don’t fall asleep at Springsteen shows.<br>
<br>
The depth of Christie’s love is noteworthy in part because most 
politicians—certainly most politicians of national stature—are either 
too dull or too monomaniacally careerist to maintain fervent emotional 
relationships with artists. And when they do, the objects of their 
affection resemble them ideologically or dispositionally—think of the 
loyalty that Pat Leahy, the liberal senator from Vermont, has for the 
Grateful Dead. Christie’s passionate attachment to Bruce Springsteen is 
something different, and much more complicated.<br>
<br>
The E Street Band blasts into “Badlands,” the opening song from the 
great Born to Run follow-up album, Darkness on the Edge of Town. 
Christie plays the air drums as 18,000 people—three generations of 
Jersey Springsteen cultists—dance with no inhibition and not too much 
skill. (It would be correct for the reader to assume, by the way, that I
 also jump around like a jackass while Springsteen sings—I’m just 
another of the many tristate ethnics who are, in Christie’s words, 
“desperately trying to cling to their 40s.”)<br>
<br>
“Badlands” contains many of Springsteen’s great themes—desire, 
desperation, defiance in the face of cruel fate, the gulf between the 
American dream and the American reality. But, like many of Springsteen’s
 most sweeping anthems—“Born in the U.S.A.” being the most obvious—it is
 a propulsive and stirring song, and the fist-pumping governor seems 
uncontainable.<br>
<br>
Behind us, Christie’s communications director, Maria Comella, whose job 
it is to contain him, watches with alarm as the governor grabs his 
community-affairs commissioner, Rich Constable, and his human-services 
commissioner, Jennifer Velez, and simultaneously bear-hugs and headlocks
 them. Christie turns from one to the other—his face is maybe three 
inches from theirs—as he shouts along with Springsteen: “Workin’ in the 
fields / Till you get your back burned / Workin’ ’neath the wheel / Till
 you get your facts learned / Baby, I got my facts / Learned real good 
right now.” He screams the song’s immortal lines: “Poor man wanna be 
rich / Rich man wanna be king / And a king ain’t satisfied till he rules
 everything / I wanna go out tonight / I wanna find out what I got.”<br>
<br>
He is flushed and beaming. The song ends, and he releases his 
commissioners, who seem happy to bask in their governor’s attention and 
also happy that he did not crack their windpipes. We’re all feeling 
elation—if the E Street Band at full throttle doesn’t fill you with joy,
 you’re probably dead—and it strikes me that this is the moment to ask 
the governor a trick question: “Do you think Mitt Romney could relate to
 this? To a Bruce Springsteen show?”<br>
<br>
He looks at me like I’m from France. “No one is beyond the reach of 
Bruce!” he screams over the noise of the crowd, and then screams it 
again, to make sure I understand: “No one is beyond the reach of Bruce!”<br>
<br>
What about Newt?<br>
<br>
“He’s been married three times!,” Christie answers. “He’d get this. You know what I mean?”<br>
<br>
Not really, but I accept the point: something about longing and sin and betrayal and the possibility of redemption.<br>
<br>
Springsteen turns to a song from the new album. Christie wanders back 
into the crowded suite, stopping to dance with his wife. I think about 
what he said: no one is beyond the reach of Bruce. There is something 
odd about this assertion, beyond the obvious, which is that there are, 
in fact, people who don’t like Springsteen, who find his singing akin to
 hog-calling; others find his Tribune of the Downtrodden persona a bit 
of a pose. But what is strange about this statement is that it is an 
inversion of a central, dispiriting truth of Christie’s life: Bruce 
Springsteen is beyond his reach.<br>
<br>
Despite heroic efforts by Christie, Springsteen, who is still a New 
Jersey resident, will not talk to him. They’ve met twice—once on an 
airplane in 1999, and then at the 2010 ceremony inducting Danny DeVito 
into the New Jersey Hall of Fame, where they exchanged only formal 
pleasantries. (Christie does say that Springsteen was very kind to his 
children.) At concerts, even concerts in club-size venues—the Stone 
Pony, in Asbury Park, most recently—Springsteen won’t acknowledge the 
governor. When Christie leaves a Springsteen concert in a large arena, 
his state troopers move him to his motorcade through loading docks. He 
walks within feet of the stage, and of the dressing rooms. He’s never 
been invited to say hello. On occasion, he’ll make a public plea to 
Springsteen, as he did earlier this spring, when Christie asked him to 
play at a new casino in Atlantic City. “He says he’s for the 
revitalization of the Jersey Shore, so this seems obvious,” Christie 
told me. I asked him if he’s received a response to his request. “No, we
 got nothing back from them,” he said unhappily, “not even a ‘Fuck 
you.’”<br>
<br>
Though he doesn’t like the cold shoulder, Christie takes comfort in 
something that, I imagine, leaves his idol unhappy and confused: the 
people who grew up with Springsteen in Freehold, the people who first 
came to listen to Springsteen, the people whose lives Springsteen 
explores in his songs—they voted for Christie. Sixty-three percent of 
white voters with only high-school diplomas went for Christie in his 
2009 race against the incumbent Democrat, Jon Corzine.<br>
<br>
Christie isn’t surprised by Springsteen’s snub. He is, after all, a 
Republican, and Bruce Springsteen is known as an enemy of Republicans. 
Christie has cut taxes, demonized the teachers unions, and slashed 
spending on social services. Springsteen makes it clear he believes that
 the wealthy should pay to fix the tears in the social safety net. He 
doesn’t seem to care that Christie is the sort of Republican many 
Democrats find appealing, or that Christie breaks left on such issues as
 Islamophobia (he stood up for a Muslim judicial appointee under 
specious attack for attempting, his critics said, to turn New Jersey 
into a Sharia state—if you can imagine such a thing) and drug-law 
enforcement (he is campaigning for a new law that would divert 
nonviolent drug offenders away from prison and toward treatment). But 
Springsteen seems actively uninterested in engaging with Christie. When I
 asked to interview Springsteen about Christie, his people gave me the 
brush-off.<br>
<br>
Springsteen soon wheels into “Bishop Danced,” one of his more obscure 
songs—Christie knows the words—and then “It’s Hard to Be a Saint in the 
City,” the first song he played for his now-legendary audition at 
Columbia Records, 40 years old but miraculously new-seeming and not at 
all preposterous for the 62-year-old onstage to be singing. And then 
comes that moment in every Springsteen concert when he brings everything
 to a halt in order to provide his diagnosis of exactly what ails the 
country. It’s a tradition, like playing “Born to Run” with the house 
lights up. The band quiets, and Springsteen steps to the mic. I’m 
curious to see how Christie handles the homily. Springsteen has become 
an angry man over the past 10 years, angry at the sort of 
people—billionaires, to be precise—who gathered last summer in New York 
to try to persuade Christie to run for president.<br>
<br>
Christie calls over to his brother, Todd—who made his money as a Wall 
Street trader—and says, “Attention please, it’s a lecture. Lecture 
time.” Springsteen begins to mumble in what the music critic Jody Rosen 
calls his “flat Dust Bowl Okie accent,” and I can’t make out a word he’s
 saying. I ask Christie if he understands him.<br>
<br>
“You want to know what he’s saying?,” Christie asks. “He’s telling us 
that rich people like him are fucking over poor people like us in the 
audience, except that us in the audience aren’t poor, because we can 
afford to pay 98 bucks to him to see his show. That’s what he’s saying.”<br>
<br>
Wait a second, this is Bruce Springsteen we’re talking about, the guy you adore?<br>
<br>
“I compartmentalize,” Christie says.<br>
<br>
He told me once that he accepts Springsteen’s “limousine liberal” 
politics the way a spouse accepts an annoying tic in her partner. “There
 is some of his work that is dour and down,” he says, “but the thing 
that attracted me to his music is how aspirational it is—aspirational to
 success, to fun, to being a better person, to figuring out how to make 
your life better—and you can’t say that about most people’s music. They 
become successful and then they become self-consumed and then boring and
 narcissistic.”<br>
<br>
He turns to Velez, who runs New Jersey’s hard-pressed social-services 
agencies. “Hey, you, you’re the commissioner of human services, this is 
for you, pay attention.” Velez, who grew up in a trailer park in the 
Meadowlands (and who is a holdover from the Corzine administration), 
says of Springsteen’s preoccupation with the poor: “I always find this 
part very inauthentic.”<br>
<br>
From the indifferent reaction of the crowd, not too many people 
understand, or care, what Springsteen is saying. Christie takes solace 
in this. Springsteen moves into “Jack of All Trades,” from the new 
album, a song that seemed to me, when I first heard it, to be the 
angriest song Springsteen has ever written. It is the story of a man who
 works with his hands in a country that assigns no value to such men 
anymore. “I’ll hammer the nails / I’ll set the stone / I’ll harvest your
 crops when they’re ripe and grown,” he sings, and then complains that 
“the banker man grows fat” while “the working man grows thin / It’s all 
happened before and it’ll happen again.” He concludes with one of the 
coldest lines he’s ever written: “If I had me a gun / I’d find the 
bastards and shoot ’em on sight.”<br>
<br>
Christie rolls his eyes. “He feels guilty,” he says. “He feels guilty 
that he has so much money, and he thinks it’s all a zero-sum game: in 
order to get poor people more money, it has to be taken away from the 
rich. I don’t mean to get all serious, but this is what I was trying to 
say at the Reagan Library”—a reference to the speech, delivered last 
year at Nancy Reagan’s invitation, that thrilled Republicans looking for
 an electoral savior. In the speech, Christie criticized President Obama
 for “telling those who are scared and struggling that the only way 
their lives can get better is to diminish the success of others” and 
“insisting that we must tax and take and demonize those who have already
 achieved the American dream.”<br>
<br>
He wants to talk more—but then Springsteen rips into “Candy’s Room.” Christie grabs an imaginary mic and begins shouting.<br>
<br>
THOUGH SPRINGSTEEN STUDIOUSLY ignores Christie at shows, he has, on one 
occasion, let his feelings about the governor be known. In a letter to 
the Asbury Park Press published a year ago, Springsteen complained of 
state budget cuts that “are eating away at the lower edges of the middle
 class, not just those already classified as in poverty, and are likely 
to continue to get worse over the next few years.” He didn’t mention 
Christie by name, but the governor was the person doing the cutting.<br>
<br>
“Why would I be shocked that Bruce would be unhappy with budget cuts?,” 
Christie asks. “I’m not shocked that he would be unhappy with certain 
programs cut that are not fully funded.” He goes on to suggest that 
Springsteen should have a better understanding of what it means to 
balance a budget. “If you talk to folks who have associated with him, he
 is, from a business perspective, a no-nonsense capitalist. He runs his 
business like a capitalist, he’s the boss, he’s in charge, he’s the one 
who makes the most money, he determines how much money everybody else 
makes. He knows about budgets.”<br>
<br>
Christie thinks hard about what he would say to Springsteen, how he 
would explain himself, if he ever had the chance. I passed an afternoon 
with the governor in his office in the Capitol, in Trenton, not long 
before the concert, listening to Springsteen—we spent half an hour 
dissecting “Thunder Road,” Christie’s favorite song—and trying to 
untangle his complex feelings about his idol. Christie believes fiercely
 that Springsteen would understand him if he only made the effort. “My 
view on it is that I’m not a priority of his right now,” he said. “At 
some point maybe I will be. If Bruce and I sat down and talked, he would
 reluctantly come to the conclusion that we disagree on a lot less than 
he thinks.”<br>
<br>
He would certainly disagree with you on unions, I said.<br>
<br>
“There’s a split in the union movement, between the private sector and 
the public sector,” he answered. “The private sector is where they’re 
having huge unemployment. You think they want to pay higher property 
taxes and bloated benefits for their public-sector union brothers who 
don’t want to make any sacrifices? Those are not the guys Bruce is 
writing about. He’s writing about the carpenter and the pipe fitter, the
 bricklayer.” He pauses for effect. “And let me tell you something. 
Those guys voted for me.”<br>
<br>
I asked him if he thought Springsteen was a hypocrite. This suspicion 
has scratched at me ever since my discovery, a dozen years ago, while 
visiting Boston to interview one of his guitarists, Steven Van Zandt, 
that Springsteen and his band had parked themselves at the Four Seasons.<br>
<br>
“I don’t think the fact that he’s successful and that he uses his wealth
 as he sees fit is a proof point of the fact that he’s lost touch with 
who he is,” Christie said. “I think the exact opposite. I think his 
success is proof that what he writes about in ‘Born to Run’ is 
absolutely achievable. He did it. He got out. I disagree with the people
 who say ‘Look at Bruce now, he doesn’t drive a beat-up car.’”<br>
<br>
He went on, “Your Four Seasons thing isn’t fair. Why wouldn’t you stay 
in a Four Seasons if you could afford to? Who would rather stay in a 
Residence Inn by Marriott if you could afford to be more comfortable in a
 Four Seasons? I think he’s the personification of the American dream: 
the kid from Freehold whose father had nothing but a bunch of very 
difficult and seemingly unsatisfying jobs, and a mother who was a 
working-class office worker, and now he’s one of the wealthiest people 
in music. He should enjoy it. What’s funny is that his progression is 
what Republicans believe can happen. That’s what Republicans 
believe—hard work, talent, ambition. We all know he’s the 
hardest-working man in show business. It’s a meritocracy.<br>
<br>
“This is where he’s inconsistent,” he continued. “I’d love to have that 
conversation with him. How does he square this? Maybe he’ll have a way 
to square it that would make some sense to me, but from the outside, it 
doesn’t make sense to me.” Christie argues that the only thing 
separating his philosophy from Springsteen’s is a single word. At 
concerts, Springsteen has often told his fans: “Nobody wins unless 
everybody wins.”<br>
<br>
“I think I would agree with that statement if he added a word,” Christie
 told me. “‘Nobody wins unless everybody has the opportunity to win.’ If
 he said that, I’d be 100 percent on board.”<br>
<br>
But here’s what I told him I imagine Springsteen might ask: “Governor, 
do you really believe it’s a level playing field? Do you really believe 
that marginalized people even have access to opportunity?”<br>
<br>
“Look,” Christie said to the imaginary Springsteen. “I’m attempting to 
level the playing field. We just disagree about how to level it. I think
 we level it by improving an urban education system that is dominated by
 union interests that are not working for the best interests of kids, 
but working in the interest of their next contract. You do it by 
bringing more private-sector business to the state.”<br>
<br>
And I asked one more question: What would happen if Springsteen did 
speak to you, but only to say “You absolutely don’t understand me.”<br>
<br>
“Just because we disagree doesn’t mean I don’t get him,” Christie said. 
“I get what he’s trying to express and advocate for, I just don’t agree 
that those are the most-effective policies for our government.” I asked 
him if Springsteen’s rejection would trigger a freak-out. “If this was 
10 years ago, maybe it would have. But I have much thicker skin now. I’m
 more mature, I’m more prepared to have that kind of conversation with a
 guy I’ve idolized since I was 13 years old.”<br>
<br>
AT THE CONCERT, Christie’s younger children are fading. So is his 
Cabinet. Velez tells him she has to leave early so she can testify the 
next morning at the state Senate’s budget-committee hearing. “Come on, 
you can’t leave,” Christie implores. Velez is making what Christie calls
 the Corzine move. The Corzine move is to leave a Springsteen show 
before it’s completely over.<br>
<br>
“There was this moment early on when I realized that Corzine just didn’t
 understand New Jersey,” Christie explains. “It was a benefit show at 
the Count Basie Theatre, in Red Bank—it was the first time that Bruce 
did whole albums through. It was the best show I’ve ever seen. It’s a 
small venue, maybe 600 or 700 people. I’m U.S. attorney then, I’m 
thinking about running for governor, and I’m in the front row of the 
balcony. Corzine is governor and he’s in the front row. And he left 
during the encores. He just left. You could see him look at his watch. 
He left during ‘Raise Your Hand’—Bruce is on top of the piano 
screaming—and it just struck me that unless there’s an emergency, which I
 found out later there wasn’t, you don’t leave. You just don’t leave.”<br>
<br>
Just after the Count Basie Theatre concert, Christie was introduced to 
Steven Van Zandt’s mother, who asked him whether he was going to run for
 governor. He told her he hadn’t yet decided. “She said, ‘Did you see 
the governor here tonight? Did you see that he left early?’ I said I 
did, and told her that this was because he’s not from Jersey. And she 
said, ‘That’s right!’”<br>
<br>
Springsteen, onstage in Newark, turns to “Rocky Ground,” the song to 
which Christie allegedly fell asleep at the Garden. “Rise up, shepherd, 
rise up,” Springsteen sings. Christie’s response: “Rise up and stay 
awake! I’m fully awake!”<br>
<br>
Then Springsteen rips through “Born to Run,” “Dancing in the Dark,” and,
 to our delight, the riotous “Rosalita.” And then he launches into 
“Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,” a song that tells the story of Scooter and 
the Big Man—Springsteen and his saxophonist Clarence Clemons, the 
central figure of the E Street Band, who died less than a year ago.<br>
<br>
“You think it’s too soon?,” Christie asks me.<br>
<br>
“Yes,” I say.<br>
<br>
“Just watch what he does with this,” he says.<br>
<br>
Clemons’s death, Christie says, crushed him. “I felt like all the energy
 was drained out of my body. I just lay there silent on the bed, and [my
 wife] said to me, ‘I just want to understand what you’re feeling,’ and I
 said, ‘My youth is over. He’s dead and anything that is left of me 
being young is over.’”<br>
<br>
Springsteen reaches the crucial moment of the song: “The change was made
 uptown / And the Big Man joined the band” and suddenly everything 
stops. A video tribute appears on huge screens above the stage, and an 
immense, sustained roar fills the arena. Christie has seen this before, 
at the Garden. “It’s just … Bruce,” he says. “He’s a genius.” He looks 
out at Springsteen in wonder.<br>
<br>
The show ends on this transcendent note. Christie says his goodbyes and 
makes his way out of the suite. He is mobbed. Everyone wants a 
handshake, a hug, or a picture. We make our way down to the loading 
dock. Springsteen is somewhere nearby. Christie looks in the direction 
of the stage, turns around, and makes his way out. State troopers have 
his motorcade ready. He gets into the car and drives away.<br>

Hope Edelman<br>
<br>
The first time I heard a Bruce Springsteen song performed live was in 1979,<br>
when I was in the tenth grade and Larry Weinberger and A.J. DeStefano stood in our<br>
high school parking lot shouting all the words to "Thunder Road" from start to finish,<br>
zipping right through that tune at fast-forward speed. Eyes squeezed shut into brief<br>
black hyphens, shoulders pumping to an imaginary drum beat, they sang to an<br>
audience of ten or twelve sophomores sprawled against the hoods of their parents' old<br>
cars, their red and green and blue looseleaf binders strewn right side up and upside<br>
down like blackjack hands along the pavement at their feet.<br>
<br>
This was October, the second month of the school year, and the time between<br>
3:40 p.m. and dinner was still a flat landscape of vast and open hours. A single cigarette<br>
slowly made its way around the circle, passed between the tight Vs of fingers and held<br>
just long enough for each of us to blow a smoke ring for effect. Across the parking lot,<br>
students called to each other by last name ("Yo, Speee-VAK!"), car doors slammed,<br>
engines revved like short-lived lawn mowers. Larry and A.J. finished their song and<br>
started on "Jungleland," pausing after, "The Magic Rat drove his sleek machine over the<br>
Jersey state line" just long enough to allow:<br>
"Into Rockland County!"<br>
"The Ramapough Inn!"<br>
"Yo mama's backyard!"<br>
"Hey! Your sister's bedroom, asshole."<br>
<br>
We all knew the words to Springsteen's songs, and we knew, firsthand, most of<br>
the places they described. Some of them practically were in our parents' backyards. We<br>
were living in New York, just over the New Jersey border in the tiny towns that dot the<br>
bottom of the state map like scattered flecks of black pepper, a county filled with minor 2<br>
suburbs most frequently described by their relative position to somewhere else: thirtythree<br>
miles northwest of Manhattan, less than a one-hour drive from two international<br>
airports, and a half-tank of gas north of the Jersey shore.<br>
<br>
Springsteen Country, our bumper stickers read, though most of us took thick<br>
black magic markers and crossed out the second R. Springsteen County was far more<br>
accurate for a place where high school principals considered "Jungleland" appropriate<br>
music to play over the homeroom P.A. system; where parents routinely dropped off their<br>
children in front of Ticketron offices fortified with sleeping bags and pastrami<br>
sandwiches, returning the next morning to carpool them to school; and where sixteenyear-<br>
olds held parties in empty parking lots on heavy, humid, late-summer nights, where<br>
they sat on the hoods of cars and swirled beer around in the can, listening to<br>
Springsteen sing about a barefoot girl on the hood of a Dodge drinking warm beer in the<br>
soft summer rain. It was enough to make you wonder where the night ended and the<br>
song began, or if there really were a difference, at all.<br>
<br>
Those were our years of music, back when we still could find simple, one-step<br>
answers to life's most complex problems in the lyrics of the songs we sang, back when<br>
a deejay's mellifluous voice could still smooth out all the rough edges of a day. In those<br>
years, the late 70s and early 80s, we plucked our role models from the FM dial--Bruce<br>
Springsteen, John Cougar, Joan Jett, a cast list of sensitive survivors, underdogs with<br>
good intentions, minor idols who neatly met our critical adolescent need to constantly<br>
feel wronged without every actually doing anything wrong, and we aligned our<br>
frustrations with the lyrical mini-dramas scripted for us in advance. Our mythology was<br>
created and recycled, and recycled and recycled, every day.<br>
<br>
Though we liked to imagine ourselves as the kind of characters that peopled<br>
Springsteen's songs--he was, after all, writing about us--the fit was never quite right. We<br>
had pretty much the same anxieties, but the socioeconomics were all wrong. He sang of<br>
working-class kids stuck in dead-end towns who grabbed their girlfriends by the wrists,<br>
leapt into their rebuilt '69 Chevys and peeled out of town in search of their futures. Our<br>
hometown was an upper-middle-class suburb where a college education was more an<br>
expectation than an exercise in free will. Most of us would grow up to become just what 3<br>
our parents had planned, and to do just as they had done. Doctor, lawyer, C.P.A. But in<br>
the time we had before our decisions became too intractable to erase, we were free to<br>
try on and shrug off whatever clothing best fit our erratic moods. Even the most<br>
intelligent, even the most affluent among us had visions of a utopia free of parents, P.E.<br>
teachers, and pop quizzes. Springsteen offered us his version of that place, his<br>
promises surrounding us like audio wallpaper--hogging the airwaves on our car radios,<br>
piped into our homerooms, pumped into every store in our local indoor shopping mall,<br>
encircling us with songs of hot desire and escape.<br>
<br>
This was 1978, 1979, and in the magazine interviews we passed from desk to<br>
desk in social studies class Springsteen told us he would never change, would never,<br>
essentially, grow up. His was a world of perpetual adolescence, an eternal seventeen. "I<br>
couldn't bring up kids," he told Rolling Stone. "I couldn't handle it. I mean, it's too heavy,<br>
it's too much...I just don't see why people get married. It's so strange. I guess it's a nice<br>
track, but not for me."<br>
<br>
Back then, like us, Springsteen was still living among his history, shuffling along<br>
the Asbury Park boardwalk with his hands jammed down deep in the front pockets of his<br>
jeans but his eyes fixed on the gulls that dipped and cawed on the horizon. He held tight<br>
to the Jersey towns where he began, always swore he'd never forget the people or the<br>
place, but he also knew where he wanted to go, and this duality pervaded his songs like<br>
a restless, wanton motif. His lyrics told us precisely what we wanted to hear: that when<br>
the pressures of adulthood started squeezing us too tight we could just peel out, leaving<br>
skid marks as our contemptuous farewell, and his music could, in the course of only<br>
three minutes, transform a solitary harmonica wail into a full-band battle cry, the<br>
cymbals crashing one, two, three like a bedroom door slamming shut over and over<br>
again.<br>
<br>
But I'm talking early Springsteen here, vintage Springsteen, those pre-1980<br>
songs that put you in a fast car and took you on a one-way ride through images that<br>
came quick and fast as lightning, no time to bother with a chorus you could return to and<br>
repeat when you lost your place in the stream of consciousness lyrics that rambled on<br>
and on like Kerouac sentences in search of a period. The songs that gave you hope<br>
there was a simpler, gentler world out there somewhere, and that the happiness missing<br>
from your own backyard could be found in the next town. This was back before he cut<br>
his hair short and sprouted biceps, back when the guitar chords still came down angry<br>
and loud and an unshaven, scrawny Springsteen rooted himself behind the mike with a<br>
guitar pressed tight against his groin, his shoulders and neck twitching spastically in time with the beat. Back when you<br>
could still tell a lot about a man by the lyrics that he sang, and when you thought Bruce<br>
Springsteen knew a lot about you, as you lay alone on your twin bed with the door<br>
slammed shut and the hi-fi turned up to 9, listening to him play the piano introduction to<br>
"Jungleland" the way he did it every time, with his left hand firmly anchored in the bass<br>
chords as his right hand skittered manically up and down the soprano notes, flailing like<br>
a frantic fish, fluttering like wings.<br>
<br>
When I met Jimmy T. I was seventeen and still a virgin, and three weeks later I<br>
was neither anymore. We did it for the first time on a Saturday afternoon in his lumpy<br>
double bed underneath guitars that hung suspended from a ceiling rack like electric pots<br>
and pans. He had a chair jammed under the doorknob and WPLJ turned up loud<br>
enough to mask our noise, and sometimes when the radio hit a bass note, a guitar<br>
string buzzed above my head. Two hours of songs must have played that afternoon, but<br>
the only one I remember is Springsteen's "Hungry Heart," because as soon as he heard<br>
the opening chords Jimmy T. started to hum and thrust in rhythm to the song. Got a wife<br>
and kids in Baltimore Jack, I went out for a ride and I never went back. Jimmy T.<br>
assured me that losing his virginity at age thirteen made him eminently qualified to<br>
relieve me of mine without unnecessary pain or pomp. He was right, on both counts, but<br>
I was disappointed nonetheless. I'd been prepared for several unsuccessful attempts,<br>
searing pain, and the kind of hysterical bleeding Sylvia Plath had described in The Bell Jar.<br>
<br>
I was the last among his friends to lose it but the first among mine, and when I<br>
left his parents' house I drove straight to my friend Jody's, walked down the hall to her<br>
room, sat down carefully on her white-ruffled canopy bed, and started to cry.<br>
"Holy shit..." she whispered, and when I nodded she threw her arms around my<br>
chest, and hugged me, hard.<br>
"Holy shit!" she shouted, bouncing her butt up and down on the bed. "Holy SHIT!<br>
TELL ME WHAT IT'S LIKE!"<br>
What was it like? What was any of it like? Like one long manic car ride on an<br>
open stretch of road with a driver whose license had wisely been revoked. And I'm not<br>
talking just about the sex part. It was like that all the time with Jimmy T. He could get a<br>
whole room of people singing with no more than five words of encouragement and a<br>
chord on his guitar, and when we went to the movies he'd have met everyone in our row<br>
and even collected a phone number or two by the time I came back with the popcorn<br>
and Junior Mints. The intersection of a precocious intellect with a cool-guy delivery had<br>
him performing monologues about hypothetical conversations between Hitler,<br>
Santayana, and Christ ("So, the Nazi dude would have said to the formerly Jewish<br>
dude, man...") to his small group of smoking-section disciples during lunchtime, after<br>
he'd cut three classes that morning and had to beg his English teacher to give him a<br>
passing grade. His mother once told me his I.Q. was 145, a fact I found suspicious<br>
considering he'd never learned how to spell.<br>
<br>
Jimmy T. Just look at his name. James Anthony Spinelli was the full version, but<br>
he wouldn't answer to James or Jim and he always included the T. For Tony. When I<br>
reminded him that his middle name was Anthony, and shouldn't he then be Jimmy A.?<br>
he gave me a crooked half-smile and raised his open palms in a shrug. I told him Jimmy<br>
T. sounded like a name he got from a fourth-grade teacher with too many Jimmys in<br>
one class, and he laughed and created a list of last names he might have had, had this<br>
been true: Tortoni, Turino, Testarossa. Jimmy Traviata at your service, he'd say,<br>
opening the car door for me with a flourish of the wrist and a bow. Jimmy Tortellini here<br>
to escort you to Spanish class. My mother would have called him a man with presence, 6<br>
like Frank Sinatra or Tom Jones. The kind of man, she said, who can take your heart<br>
away.<br>
<br>
Jimmy T., I'm certain, would have considered this a compliment. In fact, if it'd<br>
been on paper, he probably would have tried to autograph it. At seventeen he already<br>
envisioned himself as a celebrity of sorts, with an existence worth chronicling as it<br>
unfolded. Write the story of us, he used to say, assigning the task to me, because I was<br>
the one who would conform to the rules of grammar and could spell. But he was the<br>
storyteller among us, the one with the elaborate narratives of drag races and secret<br>
meetings with record executives, and of playing his guitar in smoky SRO bars where<br>
audiences lifted their brown beer bottles and shouted for more. Stories I would have<br>
immediately thought unbelievable had they not been told with such authority, such<br>
grace. Write the story of us, he would say, the "us" squeezing implied chapters between<br>
its two characters, but when I tried I could never get past our first, unremarkable<br>
conversation at a party in a cheap motel room at the New Jersey shore. The people<br>
who appeared on my pages were insipid and one-dimensional, nothing at all like the<br>
characters we aspired to be, and my efforts turned into crumpled wads of paper I tossed<br>
against his bedroom walls.<br>
<br>
I spent most of my after-school hours between those walls, preferring to close a<br>
bedroom door against the silence of Jimmy T.'s house than against the disorder of my<br>
own. This was 1982. The summer before, my mother had died of cancer, quickly and<br>
unexpectedly, leaving my father to care for three children, ages seventeen, fourteen,<br>
and nine. When we returned from the hospital he looked at us and blinked quizzically,<br>
as if to ask, Have we met? and I realized for the first time how fragile a balance life must<br>
be, if it can be tipped so swiftly, so dramatically and irrevocably, by the force of a single<br>
event. Only after my mother was gone did I understand she'd been the only adhesive<br>
that had held us all together, and as the empty Scotch bottles multiplied on the kitchen<br>
counter my father began to spout increasingly weird and existential rhetoric about how<br>
the individual is more important than the unit, and how we all must learn to fend for<br>
ourselves. I'm doing just fine, thank you, he hollered when he found me one evening<br>
pouring honey-colored streams of alcohol down the avocado kitchen sink. And I don't<br>
need you or anyone else to tell me how to live my life. Then don't you tell me how to live<br>
mine, I screamed back in a defensive panic, and he yelled Fine! and I yelled Fine! and<br>
everything, perhaps, would have been just fine, except that very soon I began to feel<br>
like a tiny, solitary satellite orbiting way out there, connected to nothing and no one,<br>
even after my father apologized and sent me on vacation to Florida to show how much<br>
he really meant it. I just smiled and kept saying everything was fine.<br>
<br>
That was the fall I became obsessed with J.D. Salinger, read each of his books<br>
four times and began to quote esoteric Zen koans at wholly inappropriate cafeteria<br>
moments, and for an entire week that winter I ate nothing but ice cream and wore<br>
nothing but black. When teachers kept me after class to ask how I was doing, I said,<br>
with great conviction, I am doing just fine. But when you're out there spinning solo, it's<br>
only a matter of time before you get close enough to someone else's gravitational pull.<br>
That spring, Jimmy T. came trucking across the dirt-brown motel room carpet, black<br>
curls flapping and motorcycle boots clomping with each step, to sit next to me on the<br>
orange bedspread. He was a senior with a fast car, a reputation, and a Fender<br>
Stratocaster electric guitar. I didn't dare say anything as plebian as hello.<br>
Our first, unremarkable conversation: He said So, and I said So, and he said,<br>
Hope? and I said Jimmy T., and he said Yeah and I said Yeah, and he said, Cigarette?<br>
and pulled a pack from his back pocket, and I said Match? and pulled a book from mine,<br>
and he said Thanks, and I said Thanks, and he said Shit! I know you can use words<br>
with more than one syllable because I see you walking out of that AP English class<br>
every day.<br>
<br>
It didn't take me much to fall in love at seventeen--the graceful arc of a smoothshaven<br>
jaw, the smell of freshly washed hair, the sound of a telephone ringing at<br>
precisely the moment of the promised call. After Jimmy T. and I returned from the beach  <br>
that Sunday, we intertwined our fingers and we held on tight. Two weeks later, we were<br>
officially in love.<br>
<br>
We spent every afternoon together, in his bedroom at the top of the stairs. Jimmy<br>
T. played songs he said he'd written for me, on the beat-up acoustic guitar he'd bought<br>
with birthday money when he was twelve. He and his friend George had written a song<br>
on it they'd sold to a record label the previous year, a tune Jimmy T. played for me over<br>
and over again as I sat crosslegged on his bed. We kept the curtains drawn. His room<br>
was dark and womblike, like a tight hug, and far removed from the bright yellow-andgreen<br>
pep of my own. The verve of my bedroom had become a hypocrisy in my father's<br>
house, where dust had settled on the living-room tables and a television droned<br>
constantly in the background to give the illusion of discourse. The downstairs bedroom<br>
that once had been my sanctuary from mother-daughter strife had transformed into<br>
something foreign and surreal I'd grown much older than seventeen that year, but every<br>
time I walked into my room the geometric mobiles and kitten posters along its perimeter<br>
told me I'd once been that age, and not so very long ago.<br>
<br>
Jimmy T.'s room, on the other hand, was testimony to postmodern teenage<br>
chaos: stereo components and recording equipment stacked schizophrenically against<br>
the walls; cassette and eight-track tapes scattered like loose change across the floor;<br>
Muppet dolls hanging in nooses from the ceiling; six-year-old Bruce Springsteen posters<br>
taped to the sliding closet doors; and pages and pages of handwritten sheet music<br>
layered like onion skin on top of his dresser, desk, and bed. Jimmy T. was working on a<br>
project, he said, a big one that the record company was anxiously waiting to see. It<br>
would take him another two years, he said, maybe three. He couldn't reveal its content<br>
yet, but he said it had the potential to change the world. Three years, maybe four. He<br>
didn't think the world could wait much longer than that.<br>
He'd chosen music as his medium, he said, because it was the most influential,<br>
the most powerful forum for widespread philosphical reform, our last-gasp hope to save<br>
our youth from an impending spiritual decline, and he was certain he'd be the one who'd<br>
one day use his guitar to make the difference that mattered. But he'd have to get<br>
moving soon, he said, seeing as how he was already certain he wouldn't live past forty.<br>
<br>
"I mean, shit," he said. "Look at Springsteen. He's already pushing thirty five. All<br>
right, the man's a genius, he's changed my life, but how many years does he really have<br>
left? Okay, I'm seventeen now, right? So say I take off at twenty, maybe twenty one.<br>
Can you imagine how much I'd get done if I got started then?"<br>
He told me this the night we met, as we walked along the beach before dawn. It<br>
was no surprise that our conversation quickly skidded into music, one of the few<br>
common denominators that fused the three distinct groups--Italians, Blacks, and Jews--<br>
that comprised our high school student body. In English class that year we all read<br>
Shakespeare and Keats, but our real poets were the ones whose song lyrics we<br>
carefully copied onto our spiral notebook covers. When our teacher asked three<br>
students to bring in their favorite poems for the class to interpret the next day, Elisa<br>
Colavito showed up with the lyrics to "Born to Run." It was worth every five-paragraph<br>
essay we had to write that year to see Mrs. Bluestein squint at the blackboard, trying to<br>
scan and analyze Just wrap your legs round these velvet rims, and strap your hands<br>
'cross my engines.<br>
<br>
My yearbook is filled with handscribbled verses like these, all the Jackson<br>
Browne and James Taylor and Bruce Springsteen aphorisms we reached for in<br>
moments of passion or distress. I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life<br>
feels. Close your eyes and think of me, and soon I will be there. Baby, we were born to<br>
run. They were the greatest hits of pre-packaged sentiment, providing me with words<br>
that sounded like what I thought I was supposed to feel. I had no blueprint for emotion,<br>
no adult I trusted to tell me what I should do with my mother's winter coats, or how to<br>
feel when I heard my siblings crying alone in their rooms, or what to say to a father who<br>
drank himself to sleep each night. In the absence of any real guidance or experience,<br>
Jackson Browne's advice to hold on and hold out was as good as any I could divine on<br>
my own.<br>
<br>
Discussing music our first night together gave Jimmy T. a convenient chance to<br>
introduce his favorite topic--Bruce Springsteen--and engage in open idolatry, which he<br>
did at every available moment. By our senior year, Jimmy T. had recreated himself<br>
almost entirely in the musician's late '70s image, adopting the appearance (long, dark<br>
hair, faded jeans, half smile), the voice (a gravelly just-got-outa-bed-and-smoked-apacka-<br>
Marlboro grumble), the transportation ('69 Chevy with a 396, and a motorcycle,<br>
no license), and the look (chin down, eyes up, head tilted slightly to one side) we saw<br>
on album covers and in music-magazine photo spreads. Jimmy T. wasn't content to<br>
merely listen to the man; he actually wanted to be him. Which meant that I, in turn, got<br>
to be his Wendy-Annie-Rosie-Mary-Janey, his co-pilot in passion and impulse. It gave<br>
me a clear persona, straightforward and well-defined. The first time we walked hand-inhand<br>
between the rows of metal lockers, I metamorphosed from the girl whose mother<br>
had died of cancer last year into the girl who was dating Jimmy T.--the girl who rode<br>
tandem and helmetless on his motorcycle, the girl who didn't care about safety or the<br>
law. I'd been waiting all year for someone to hand me a costume that fit so well.<br>
It wasn't a bad deal. After all, the scenery changed every day and I never had to<br>
drive.<br>
<br>
There are two kinds of men, my mother told me when I was sixteen: the ones<br>
who need you, and the ones who need you to need them. I eyed my father closely the<br>
year after she died, looking for some kind of clue about him, but his actions were too<br>
inconsistent, his silence too enigmatic, to help me decide either way. From across the<br>
kitchen I watched him, a big, awkward man with a woman's apron tied around his waist,<br>
carefully measuring ingredients into a microwaveable casserole dish as his glass of<br>
Scotch and soda sweated droplets onto the counter at his side. He insisted on cooking<br>
every night, but after dinner he retreated to his room where he fell asleep, snoring<br>
loudly, by nine. "He has to go to bed this early, so he can wake up for work at five," my<br>
sister insisted, in that horrible "Don't FUCK with me...please?" tone we all mastered that<br>
year. But I knew that sometimes in the middle of the night she went to stand outside our<br>
father's room, listening for his breathing, and when she didn't hear it she opened the<br>
door a crack just to make sure she saw his chest rise and fall. I knew, because<br>
sometimes when I came in late at night I went to check for it, too.<br>
<br>
Jimmy T. and I worked out a system: Lying on my bed downstairs, I waited until<br>
the last floorboard creaked above my head before I dialed his number. I let it ring only<br>
once, hanging up before either of his parents could get to the phone. When I heard his<br>
engine idling in the street I climbed out my sub-basement window, crawled across three<br>
feet of slippery bark chips and rough shrubs and then sprinted across the lawn to the<br>
Chevy's passenger door. I held my breath until the moment when the cool metal door<br>
handle connected with my palm, that concrete smack of arrival, exhaling with relief as I<br>
landed with a soft thud in his vinyl passenger seat.<br>
<br>
We navigated the back roads after midnight, with a Springsteen tape in the<br>
cassette deck and a Mexican blanket folded on the back seat. Night was when we made<br>
our mark. "Welcome to my beaudoir," Jimmy T. liked to say, gesturing toward the open<br>
blanket as I unzipped my jeans. "Would Madame like a mint on her pillow, or perhaps<br>
the services of a personal valet?"<br>
<br>
We fucked behind a grade school, right beside the jungle gym. We fucked in the<br>
backyards of kids we were certain hated us at school. We fucked in a park, in a parking<br>
lot, and on a dock along the Hudson River while three geese fought it out over half a<br>
bagel. It's a miracle we never got caught. We learned how to be quick about it. Maybe<br>
that's why.<br>
<br>
Jimmy T. always sang along with the tape as he drove me back to my father's<br>
house. He had a pretty good voice, on-key with a slight Jell-O quiver when he held onto<br>
the low notes and a scratch against the back wall of his throat when he reached for the<br>
high ones. It was a tight match to Springsteen's, and when he sang with the tape I had<br>
to listen hard to distinguish between the two. Jimmy T. drove with his left hand on top of<br>
the steering wheel and his right hand resting against the back of my neck. The damp<br>
summer breeze carried the scents of lawn clippings and moist tree bark through the<br>
open windows and into our hair. I tried to come up with ways to extend time so I<br>
wouldn't have to go home so soon. If I surfed the FM dial I could usually find a driving<br>
song that would buy me three or four minutes more. Sometimes I had to fight the urge<br>
to slide my left sneaker on top of Jimmy T.'s right one and press the accelerator to the<br>
floor. This was my fantasy: the two of us speeding deeper and deeper into the woods,<br>
with his right arm across my shoulders and my left palm resting against his thigh, like a<br>
couple in a tiny, private theater with a windshield as our screen.<br>
<br>
I knew other girls like me in high school who saw their boyfriends as their saviors,<br>
turning to them for the nurturing and attention they couldn't get from home. We were<br>
everywhere, holding on to our textbooks with one hand and our boyfriends' belt loops<br>
with the other as we maneuvered through the halls; scratching their names into our arm<br>
skin with safety pins during study hall, making little love tattoos; sitting knee-to-kneein<br>
Planned Parenthood conference rooms while a counselor named Joe waved flat-spring<br>
diaphragms and Pill packets in the air as he talked about "shared responsibility."<br>
Outside in the waiting room, another group sat clutching their bouquets of ten-dollar<br>
bills, waiting to file in. There were so many of us, so many rooms of women, all waiting<br>
to be saved.<br>
<br>
When Jimmy T. and I were juniors, the year before we met, his best friend Billy<br>
D'Angelo died. The local newspaper reported it as an accident, no other victims<br>
involved. It happened in late May, just a few weeks before Billy would have graduated.<br>
I'd known Billy from fifth-period lunch, when we sometimes stood in the same circle in<br>
the smoking section outside with our shoulders hunched together to protect our<br>
matches from the wind. It was no secret that his grades hadn't been good enough to get<br>
him into any college, or that his parents were beginning to turn up the volume about<br>
enlisting in the military. "The fucking army, man," he said, flicking his cigarette butt into<br>
the grass. "Like I'm really going to cut my hair and do pushups. Right."<br>
Wild Billy, his friends called him, after Springsteen's song "Spirit in the Night."<br>
Crazy Janey and her mission man, were back in the alley trading hands, 'Long came<br>
Wild Billy with his friend G-man, all duded up for Saturday night. It's sort of a lonely<br>
song, about old friends and drugs and a single night's attempt to get away from it all, but<br>
Billy didn't seem to mind the name.<br>
<br>
I didn't know Billy all that well, but up until the time he died I still believed the<br>
universe was a largely benevolent place run by a judicious management. In this cosmos 13<br>
of my imagination, people didn't die young. My mother was still alive, and though she'd<br>
been diagnosed with breast cancer the previous spring, it hadn't yet occurred to me that<br>
she might actually do something as radical as die. Her own optimism blanketed the<br>
family with a false security, allowing us to believe we could all go on living just as we<br>
always had, treating cancer and chemotherapy as temporary boarders on a month-tomonth<br>
lease.<br>
<br>
Before Billy died, death was more than just an abstraction to me. It was damn<br>
near incomprehensible. When it caught up with him, it caught up with me, too, and I was<br>
left struggling to understand the insidious speed and finality of it. One day Billy was<br>
cupping his hand around a lit match, trying to light a cigarette in the wind, and the next<br>
he was gone, a quenched flame. For the first few days after he died, I kept halfexpecting<br>
him to sidle up next to me outdoor with an unlit Marlboro dangling from his<br>
mouth. I just couldn't wrap my mind around the idea that someone who'd always been<br>
there could suddenly be so...well, nowhere, as far as I could see.<br>
<br>
The accident--which is what we were calling it then--had happened on a<br>
Saturday night, in a state park about fifteen miles north of town. Jimmy T. and Billy and<br>
their crowd of high school friends used to go up there after dark and race cars on the<br>
narrow roads that hugged the mountain curves. Billy had convinced Jimmy T., don't ask<br>
me how, to lend him his '65 Mustang for the ride. Kimmy Rinaldi, Billy's unofficial fiance,<br>
pulled him over to the gravel shoulder and pleaded with him not to race. Afterward, she<br>
said she'd just had a bad feeling about that night. Not bad like you were on an airplane<br>
and suddenly thought it might be on its way down, she told me, but bad enough to say<br>
something, you know? Billy told her not to worry, popped a quick, dry kiss against her<br>
mouth, and caught the key ring Jimmy T. tossed his way with a quick twist of his wrist.<br>
What happened next happened quickly. Moments after the two cars squealed off,<br>
everyone jogged up the road to see beyond the first bend. Jimmy T. was the first to<br>
arrive, just in time to see the Mustang take a sharp right turn off the edge of the road<br>
and to hear the sickening crash and thump of metal against granite and bark as the<br>
steep forest rejected the car all the way down the mountain's side.<br>
<br>
Jimmy T. took off running to where the other driver stood, already out of his car,<br>
pounding its roof with a bruised fist and crying without tears. Crying without tears, they<br>
said. "I don't get it, man. He was on the inside. I don't get it man. I don't get it." A couple<br>
more people ran over, and there was a bunch of noise and some crying, and a lot of<br>
spinning around without any real direction before someone decided it would probably be<br>
a good idea to call the cops. When Kimmy finally realized what had happened, she<br>
started screaming Billy's name, over and over again. It took three people to hold her<br>
back, to keep her from going over the edge after him.<br>
<br>
The funeral was six days later, in a church around the corner from our school. A<br>
wave of students outfitted in tan poly-blend suits and white peasant skirts left after third<br>
period that day, all absences excused. After the service, Jimmy T. and some other<br>
friends paid their respects to Mrs. D'Angelo and told her how they hoped she'd have<br>
'Wild Billy' engraved somewhere on the headstone. They said they knew Billy would<br>
have wanted it that way. She was very kind and courteous and said Bill had been so<br>
lucky to have had friends as nice as them, but when the stone went up a few weeks<br>
later, it read William Christopher D'Angelo, Beloved Son and Brother, 1963-1981, and<br>
nothing more.<br>
<br>
The story of Billy's death quickly become a dark legend told and retold up and<br>
down the hallways of our school, increasing in macabre and explicit detail until even<br>
those who'd been there couldn't separate the imaginary from the real. The car did a<br>
complete flip as it went over the cliff, or was it two, or three? Billy had called out<br>
"Kimmy!" as he went down, or was it "Jimmy!" or "Why me?!" Overnight, Billy became<br>
our romantic hero, the boy who'd died at the same fast speed at which he'd lived. Never<br>
mind that he'd really spent most of his days red-eyed and only marginally coherent in<br>
the smoking area outside. Never mind that his car left no skid marks. In myth you have<br>
no mortal limits. You can do anything. You can become a god.<br>
<br>
I didn't really know Jimmy T. before the crash. His friends later told me that<br>
watching it had changed him, but they couldn't explain quite how. It made him<br>
more...reckless, they said, gazing toward the ceiling as if adjectives grow between<br>
flourescent lights. More...unpredictable. More...well, just weirder, you know?<br>
<br>
Yes, I wanted to say. Yes. It's easy to pinpoint the effects of a positive change,<br>
harder--unless they're clearly pathological--to recognize those that stem from a loss.<br>
Those are our tiny secrets, the runaway pieces of psyche we bury under thick layers of<br>
silence and defense. We say we're managing. We say we're doing fine. We say we<br>
don't need help and people believe us, because they want to believe us, even when our<br>
actions clearly say the opposite is true.<br>
<br>
It took me almost a month after our first weekend at the beach to tell Jimmy T.<br>
about my mother, though of course he'd known the story all along. Everyone did, by<br>
then. I tried to pass it off matter-of-factly in the car one night--"My mother died last year,<br>
you know?"--but before I could even finish the sentence I'd begun to cry. It was still that<br>
close to the surface. He pulled into the nearest driveway and held me tight, my hands<br>
trapped between his chest and my face. He pulled them away and kissed my eyes,<br>
licking my tears like a cat. "Shh," he said. "Don't cry. Jimmy T. is here."<br>
<br>
That night was the only night he ever talked with me about Billy dying. He told me<br>
his version of the crash story from beginning to end: about the good-luck butt slap he<br>
gave Billy before he got into the Mustang; the way Billy drove off with his left fist thrust<br>
out the open window and northwest into the air; and how for one crazy moment, when<br>
he first saw the car leave the ledge, he thought it might sprout wings and fly.<br>
If only he hadn't given Billy the keys, Jimmy T. whispered. If only Kimmy had<br>
complained a little more. If only he'd been driving the car, Jimmy T. said, and that's<br>
when he started to cry, a loud, dry, keening sound like an animal left alone too long. I<br>
pulled his head to my shoulder and rocked him, my cheek against his hair. There are<br>
times when loss will bind you tighter than happiness or humor or music ever can.<br>
College, Jimmy T. said, was just a place where all the problems of the world<br>
masqueraded as department names, but I might as well go anyway. "Someone's got to<br>
help me undo all the damage that's been done, and they'll take us more seriously if you<br>
have a college degree," he explained. Before I'd even met Jimmy T. I'd been accepted<br>
at a school in Illinois, and throughout the summer my departure date hung over us like a 16<br>
heavy Great Plains sky. As August melted into September, Jimmy T. still wasn't sure<br>
what he'd do in the fall. Maybe take some courses at the community college in town:<br>
philosophy, or religion, or poetry or film. He once casually mentioned coming to Chicago<br>
with me. My evasive "Yeah..." surprised us both, and told him not to offer again. We<br>
both knew he was only grasping for a plan as he watched his previously reliable<br>
audience begin to disperse, moving on to college, the military, and jobs in other states.<br>
This hadn't been the promise. The promise had been that we'd stay young<br>
together, follow our dreams, and one day land on the cover of Newsweek or Rolling<br>
Stone. It hadn't accounted for the powerful force that smoothly propels white, middleclass<br>
kids out of high school and into whatever it is they're expected to do next.<br>
We'd counted on Springsteen, at least, to keep his original vow, but even he<br>
couldn't sustain it forever. With the release of Nebraska in the fall of 1982, he made the<br>
sudden transition from the prophet of one generation's rhapsody to the chronicler of<br>
another's demise. The album was a veritable avalanche of fractured dreams, filled with<br>
stories of plant shutdowns, home foreclosures, and debtors driven to desperate means.<br>
Springsteen was just describing the times, I suppose, but they weren't my times<br>
anymore. The first time I listened to Nebraska and heard Everything dies, baby that's a<br>
fact, but maybe everything that dies someday comes back, was the first time I'd ever<br>
listened to a Bruce Springsteen song and thought, You are wrong. You are so<br>
completely wrong.<br>
<br>
The night before I left for college, I tacked a calendar on Jimmy T.'s bedroom wall<br>
and counted off the days until I'd be home for Thanksgiving break. "Seventy four," I told<br>
him, with manufactured optimism as he sat sullenly on the edge of the bed, wrists<br>
dangling between his knees. "When you wake up in the morning, it'll be only seventy<br>
three."<br>
"I know how to subtract."<br>
Overnight, I had become the traitor, he the betrayed. "Don't leave me," I pleaded,<br>
as I held onto him at the door.<br>
<br>
"What?" he said. "You're the one who's getting on the plane without me."<br>
Which I did, in the middle of September, on a direct flight to Chicago from New<br>
York. The first friend I made in my dorm became my closest one that year, a prep<br>
school graduate from Massachussetts with Mayflower ancestors and an album<br>
collection filled with Joni Mitchell, Johnathan Edwards, and Neil Young. "Bruce<br>
Springsteen?" she asked, scrunching up her nose in thought. And then, after a pause,<br>
"Isn't he that short guy from New Jersey?" By the second week of school, I'd buried all<br>
my cassette tapes in the bottom of a desk drawer. It's frighteningly easy to abandon the<br>
familiar when you discover it might be cliche.<br>
<br>
Jimmy T. mailed me a letter in late September saying he couldn't contact me<br>
again until Halloween, because he was going on the road with his new band. So you<br>
can imagine my surprise when, in mid-October, I returned from an anthropology class<br>
on a Thursday afternoon and found him sitting alone in the first-floor lounge of my<br>
dormitory, his black leather jacket with the chrome zippers at odd angles hopelessly out<br>
of place in the sea of Izod sweaters and wool peacoats from Peck &amp; Peck. He looked<br>
like a page from one short story ripped out and used as the bookmark in another, and<br>
when I first saw him I pulled my books into my chest and took a step back. He<br>
understood that step, he told me later. Hey! he said. Jimmy T. is no fool.<br>
<br>
I didn't know exactly what pushed--or pulled--me back into the protective pocket<br>
of theglassed-in entryway. All I knew was in that moment after I instinctively withdrew, I<br>
suddenly understood something about relationships, something important. I understood<br>
there was a third kind of man my mother never told me about, the kind who you need,<br>
regardless of how he feels about you. The kind who offers you shelter when no one else<br>
even knows how to open a damn umbrella. The kind you can love but can never stay<br>
with for long, because the reason you ran to him in the first place was to gather the<br>
strength you needed to leave.<br>
<br>
Jimmy T. stayed with me in Chicago for three days. We argued the whole time.<br>
We apologized in harmony, and then we argued some more. He wanted me to come<br>
back with him. I wanted him to leave alone. He wrote prose poems and taped them to<br>
my mirror when I was in class. The Chicago wind blows back your hair, you're living<br>
your art, your part. Long camel hair and scarf. We couldn't get past metaphor. "My axe<br>
has broken strings," he told me late one night, and I asked him to please for God's sake<br>
just drop the poetry and get to the point.<br>
<br>
Our conversation, at the end: He said, I came here to ask you to do something<br>
with me, and I said What? and he said, But now I see you won't, and I said What? and<br>
he said, I can't tell you, exactly, but it has to do with a quest I can't fulfill alone, and I<br>
said Please. Please would you just tell me what you mean. And he said all right, but you<br>
can't tell anyone, you swear? So I swore, and he nodded, and then he told me, very<br>
simply, that he was the Second Coming of Christ.<br>
After he'd gotten back on the plane alone, after I'd called his mother from the pay<br>
phone at O'Hare and told her what he'd said, after the iceberg in my stomach finally<br>
began to thaw, I spent long nights wondering about the role I'd played 
in all this. Could I have prevented it somehow? Could I have been the 
cause? As the letters addressed to<br>
Jimmy T. came back marked "Return to Sender, Deceitful Sender" in an 
angry scrawl, I lay on my bed and stared at the ceiling, looking for the
 words that would help me understand.<br>
<br>
I was lying like this in my dorm room one night with the clock radio tuned in to<br>
Chicago's WXRT when I heard the first few bars of Jimmy T.'s song, the 
one he and his friend George had sold to the record company, come 
through on the air. I lay very still, barely breathing, trying to 
identify whose voice was singing the familiar words. I didn't dare move,
 too afraid I'd miss the end of the song and the name of the band.<br>
<br>
I had to wait through two more songs before the deejay returned. "...and before<br>
that we heard the Greg Kihn Band," he said, as the music faded away. "Doing a remake of an old Bruce Springsteen tune."<br>
<br>
Somewhere in the distance, I imagine, an engine revved and purred. Somewhere<br>
far beyond my reach, another boy shifted into high gear and pressed the pedal to the<br>
floor, believing he could sail on and on into the night.</div>

The Undercover Boss <br>
On conservatism and Bruce Springsteen<br>
By Daniel Foster<br>
<br>
Listen to his voice.<br>
<br>
That’s the first thing I tell people who ask me how I can reconcile my 
ongoing (knock wood) employment at National Review with my Bruce 
Springsteen partisanship — as many did after the Obama campaign carted 
out the Boss in Ohio last week to shill for four more years of Hope 
Things Change.<br>
<br>
Now, I’m not the first portly conservative from Jersey who has been 
called on to square his politics with his taste in music. In a lengthy 
profile on the subject, The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg asked Governor 
Chris Christie, whose love for the Boss borders on the monomaniacal, how
 he maintained such enthusiasm for a man who treats the governor with 
active indifference and the governor’s politics with blasting contempt. 
Christie’s response was subtle and manifold and all too familiar to me, 
but it boiled down to: “I compartmentalize.” And indeed, there’s a lot 
to that. Folks on the Right understand better than anybody that the 
contours of a man’s aesthetic imagination are not reducible to or 
derivable from his fiscal-policy preferences. And if political 
conservatives consumed only popular culture made by other political 
conservatives, Pat Boone would still be flying off the shelves of 
Walmarts all across the heartland.<br>
<br>
So yes, we compartmentalize. But I’ve got news for you: So does Bruce.<br>
Just listen to his voice. Springsteen grew up in Freehold, one of the 
innumerable quiet, Catholic towns in the hinterlands of Jersey between 
the City and the Shore. Linguistically, he comes from the fringe of the 
New York dialectical region, where o’s turn into aw’s and r’s are 
enunciated or elided with caprice. Travel 20 miles west and you’re into 
Philly territory, where water is wooter and “wit” is a preposition, not a
 gift for repartee. Now, as a kid who was born outside Philadelphia and 
grew up in North Jersey, Springsteen should sound, roughly, like me. But
 he doesn’t. He sounds like a world-weary, middle-aged Huckleberry Finn.
 “Thiseer’s a song called ‘Livin’ in the Future,’” he growled at a 
concert at the old Giants Stadium that I covered a few years ago. “But 
it’s ’bout what’s happenin’ right nah.”<br>
<br>
Does this bother me? Not one teensy little bit. As I wrote at the time, and you’ll have to forgive me for quoting myself:<br>
<br>
Like his musical godfather Bob Dylan — who on arriving in New York spun 
bulls*** tales of his exploits as a cowboy and boxcar vagabond for 
anybody who’d listen — Springsteen understands that it is the job of a 
folk hero to be larger than life, to bring to his particularity an 
impossible universality.<br>
<br>
So the voice that said “Hello Jersey!” at around 8:30, sending up a 
frenetic roar from the crowd, is cut from whole cloth, a mix of 
Midwestern clip and southern twang that is miles and years from the 
Irish-Italian kid who grew up down the Shore. A bit of a noble lie as a 
means of conveying The Truth.<br>
<br>
And so that’s what I tell people when they ask me how a conservative can
 pay the cost to love The Boss. It’s not the man, you see, that I’m 
cranking up on the car stereo that cost more than my ’94 Cherokee is 
worth. It’s the character. The alter ego. The voice.<br>
<br>
Fine, you say. But Springsteen’s “voice” — his music — is every bit as 
liberal as he is, no? Does he not say all the time — did he not say in 
Ohio — that his music is about “the distance between the American Dream 
and American reality”?<br>
<br>
Sure, Bruce says that. But the truth — The Truth — is not nearly so simple.<br>
<br>
Let us stipulate that Springsteen’s first two records with the E Street 
Band are pure bar rock, a docudrama of the dreams and doldrums of a 
beer-soaked long-hair desperate to get lucky and avoid anything like 
real work. (And I say all that with the utmost respect.) Let’s stipulate
 that even the third album, Born to Run, which the conventionally wise 
take to be Springsteen’s magnum opus, is a transitional work — the 
familiar bluster and bull cut through with hints of a creeping new 
fatalism. And let’s stipulate further still that it’s the masterful 
triptych that followed Born to Run — namely, Darkness at the Edge of 
Town, The River, and Nebraska — that established the mature 
Springsteen’s reputation as the at-turns-mournful-and-defiant bard of 
the Working Man.<br>
<br>
The odd thing is that these three records were conceived, gestated, 
recorded, and released between 1975 and 1982. On the one hand, this 
makes perfect sense. It was an era bookended by recessions and shot 
through with stagflation, fertile ground for a trilogy of records about 
how the little guy can’t win for losing, as enshrined in soot-covered 
Springsteen songs like “Badlands,” “Factory,” “Atlantic City,” and “The 
River.” (The last contains the almost parodically quintessential 
Springsteen line: “I got a job working construction for the Johnstown 
Company / But lately there ain’t been much work on account of the 
economy.”)<br>
But, on the other hand, it was also a period in which the top 
marginal-income-tax rate was 70 percent. The top corporate tax rate was 
48 percent. Income inequality — as measured by such things as the Gini 
coefficient and the amount of wealth held by the “1 percent” — was at 
its post-war low. The tinsel was just being put on the New Deal/Great 
Society welfare state, and a gentle, progressive philosopher-farmer had 
been elected president of the United States. The wealth was truly being 
spread.<br>
<br>
Yet none of this is to be found in the Boss’s tales of dead-end jobs, 
dreams deferred and drag racing, lovers, losers and outlaws, sinners and
 sweethearts and racketeering and redemption. The population of 
Springsteenville may lament the shuttering of the auto plant in Mahwah 
(“Johnny 99”) and getting nothing but a union card and a shotgun wedding
 for their 19th birthdays (“The River”), but there’s no bailouts, no 
card check, and not a subsidized prophylactic in sight. When the state 
shows up at all, it’s usually in the form of Johnny Law chasing 
antiheroes in stolen hot rods. Politics — never mind liberal politics — 
simply has very little to do with Springsteen’s defining work.<br>
<br>
That’s not to say you can’t situate High Springsteen in its 
socio-historical context, or understand his music as a vernacular 
reflection of the political quandaries of its time. But that’s not an 
unambiguous exercise, either. Bruce, I’m sure, would disagree 
emphatically, but as I’ve gotten older I’ve come to read Springsteen 
songs more and more as funeral dirges for a very particular political 
promise that died some time in the Seventies — namely, the promise that 
America’s long streak of post-war prosperity meant that the great 
liberal and great conservative priorities were mutually deliverable; 
that a universal middle class was achievable by some magic mix of 
entrepreneurialism and redistribution; that high taxes, anticompetitive 
regulation, and industrial planning were consistent with limitless 
growth; that the nuclear family and the white picket fence could survive
 the institutionalization of the Sixties. And so on. On this reading, 
Springsteen’s music is indeed about the “distance between the American 
Dream and American reality,” just not in the way he thinks it is.<br>
<br>
Of course, it doesn’t matter if I’m right about this. It suffices to 
establish that you can map more than one politics onto Springsteen’s 
oeuvre — or at least onto the good stuff. It’s (sadly) true that, post 
1982, Springsteen’s work has gotten more explicitly political even as it
 has grown increasingly uneven. Born in the U.S.A., a fine record 
notwithstanding some cringeworthy Eighties markers, takes on civil 
rights and Vietnam 20 years late. But ironically, it does so with such a
 poppy sound that a Reagan-reenergized public mistook it en masse for a 
piece of upbeat Americana and made it a No. 1 record. It’d be ten years 
and another recession before Bruce went political again on the 
pitch-black The Ghost of Tom Joad, which is exactly as much of a drag as
 it sounds. September 11 inspired Springsteen to return again after a 
seven-year absence and to produce his last great album, The Rising, an 
ecumenical rallying cry that perfectly distills the flag-waving days of 
resolve before everyone hated George W. Bush. Everything since then has 
been the story of Springsteen’s decline into a sort of conventionally 
liberal Woody Guthrie.<br>
<br>
Part of this was probably inevitable. Like the president, Springsteen is
 a Baby Boomer, and now that the Boomers run the world, even the Boss is
 liable to take on a whiff of the company man. In 1980, Springsteen was 
staring flinty-eyed at a “Mansion on the Hill,” and now he’s raising 
money for Barack Obama at one.<br>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen v Masquerade Music<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
The Judgement of Judge Ferris- <br>
<br>
<br>
There are two actions before me. In each of them the plaintiff is Bruce 
Springsteen, a world-famous composer and performer of popular music. <br>
<br>
It has not been disputed that all the tracks on the CDs of which 
complaint is made are of songs in which the words were written and the 
music composed by Mr Springsteen. It is also agreed that the tracks are 
reproductions of recordings of informal performances originally given by
 Mr Springsteen, although in some cases the sounds of additional 
instruments have been added to the original recordings. It is also 
accepted that neither Flute nor Masquerade had any licence from Mr 
Springsteen to do what they have done or threatened to do. It is said on
 behalf of Mr Tringham, Masquerade and Mr Winter (to whom I shall refer 
collectively as “the defendants”) that no such licence was required 
because Mr Springsteen is not the copyright owner. <br>
<br>
For present purposes the story begins late in the year 1971, when Mr 
Springsteen was about 21 years of age. At that time he had been a 
professional singer and musician for some seven years. His activities 
seem to have consisted mainly of performances in small and little-known 
groups or bands at unfashionable venues in New Jersey, where he lived. 
Latterly his band was known as “The Bruce Springsteen Band” but it 
achieved neither fame nor fortune and, after a number of vicissitudes, 
it broke up at the end of 1971 or early in 1972.<br>
<br>
Towards the end of 1971 an individual known as Tinker West, who had in 
effect been the manager of the Bruce Springsteen Band, introduced Mr 
Springsteen to Mr Mike Appel. Mr Appel had for some years been a song 
writer employed by a music publisher named Wes Farrell, or by his 
company named Pocketful of Tunes Inc. To a large extent Mr Appel carried
 out his song writing jointly with an individual named James Cretecos. 
Mr Appel's interest in their joint compositions was regarded as 
belonging to Wes Farrell or his company by virtue of his contract of 
employment but Mr Cretecos was not an employee of Wes Farrell or his 
company and special arrangements were made for the assignment of his 
interest in joint compositions to Wes Farrell or his company.<br>
<br>
When Mr Springsteen was first introduced to Mr Appel he played and sang 
two or three of his songs to him and Mr Appel indicated an interest in 
promoting them in some way. At the end of 1971 Mr Springsteen went to 
stay for some weeks with his parents in California and had no contact 
with Mr Appel. In February or March 1972 he returned to New Jersey and 
approached Mr Appel again to see whether he was interested in working 
with him.<br>
<br>
Mr Appel indicated that he was interested and, either then or soon 
afterwards, he told Mr Springsteen that he worked closely with Mr 
Cretecos, that they were equal partners and that they would jointly act 
to promote Mr Springsteen's interests. Mr Springsteen met Mr Cretecos 
and appears to have agreed informally to this arrangement.<br>
Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos then instructed a New York attorney named Jules
 Kurz to act for them in defining their relationship with Mr 
Springsteen. Mr Kurz was then a sole practitioner specialising in music 
and entertainment law.<br>
Mr Kurz gave evidence at the trial and although, as will appear, there 
are some parts of his evidence which have to be examined with care, I 
have no difficulty in accepting his account of his early instructions 
from Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos. <br>
<br>
At some time in March 1972 an exclusive recording agreement was entered 
into between a party described as “Laurel Canyon Productions” and Mr 
Springsteen. This agreement was drafted by Mr Kurz. It was expressed to 
be dated merely “this … day of March 1972”. It was signed by Mr Appel on
 behalf of Laurel Canyon Productions.  <br>
<br>
Some time in April 1972 Mr Appel made contact with an individual named 
John Hammond, the head of the artists and repertoire department as CBS 
Records, one of the largest record producers in the world. Mr 
Springsteen performed for Mr Hammond, who liked what he saw and heard. 
On May 3, 1972 Mr Hammond arranged for Mr Springsteen to make some 
demonstration tapes at the studios of CBS. These created a sufficiently 
favourable impression to cause CBS to *191 offer a recording contract.<br>
<br>
Under the CBS agreement LCP was to provide to CBS the services of Mr 
Springsteen to perform at recording sessions for the purpose of making 
phonograph records. It was provided that during the term of the 
agreement, which was to be a period of one year subject to the 
possibility of extension, Mr Springsteen would not make records for 
anyone else. All master recordings made under the agreement, when 
delivered to CBS, were to be the property of CBS. The other detailed 
terms of the CBS agreement do not matter for present purposes.<br>
<br>
The CBS agreement was varied by a letter from CBS Records dated August 
10, 1972 which was countersigned by both Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos to 
indicate agreement on the part of LCP. The substance of this variation 
was that LCP agreed to transfer to CBS Records, in such a way as to make
 them the property of CBS Records, the master recordings of certain 
compositions which had been recorded before the date of the CBS 
agreement, the property in which did not therefore belong to CBS under 
that agreement. LCP warranted its title to such master recordings. Ten 
such recordings were specified. They included recordings of compositions
 named “Visitation at Fort Horne”, “The Jazz Musician” and “Arabian 
Night”. These names will reappear at a later stage of the story.<br>
<br>
On June 28, 1972 a corporation named Laurel Canyon Ltd was incorporated 
under the Business Corporation Law of New York. On October 5, 1972 a 
corporation named Sioux City Music Limited was likewise incorporated. 
Finally on March 5, 1973 a corporation named Laurel Canyon Management 
Ltd was incorporated. In each case the incorporation was handled by Mr 
Kurz. There is no doubt that he was acting on behalf of Mr Appel and Mr 
Cretecos in effecting these incorporations and that Mr Appel and Mr 
Cretecos became entitled to equal shareholdings in each of the 
companies. The choice of the abbreviation “Ltd” in preference to the 
abbreviation “Inc.” or other permitted designation of incorporation was 
said to have been made by Mr Appel, who thought that “Ltd” sounded more 
English and “classy”. <br>
<br>
The recordings made at the 914 Studios, or such of them as Mr 
Springsteen was prepared to allow to be released, were supplied to CBS 
Records under the CBS agreement and CBS compiled and marketed Mr 
Springsteen's first album. This was called “Greetings from Asbury Park 
NJ” and it was released on January 1, 1973. The record sleeve included 
publishing credits to “Sioux City Music Ltd” and stated that the album 
was “Produced by Mike Appel and Jim Cretecos for Laurel Canyon Ltd”. The
 album contained nine tracks. A few days before the album was released 
claims to copyright in the words and music of the songs on eight of 
these tracks were registered under the United States law of copyright in
 the name of Sioux City Music Ltd. The applications for registration 
were signed on behalf of Sioux City Music Ltd by Mr Cretecos.<br>
<br>
Although Mr Springsteen's first album is said to have been acclaimed by 
the critics it achieved very limited commercial success. The same was 
the case with his second album, entitled “The Wild, The Innocent and The
 East Street Shuffle” which was released on November 9, 1973. The record
 sleeve gave a publishing credit to Laurel Canyon Music Ltd (which, of 
course, was the recently adopted name of the company formerly named 
Sioux City Music Ltd to which a similar credit was given on the sleeve 
of the first record) and stated that the record was produced by Mike 
Appel and Jim Cretecos for Laurel Canyon Ltd (which was the same 
attribution as the first album).<br>
<br>
Early in 1974, or possibly at the end of 1973, the relationship between 
Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos broke up. The reasons for this appear to have 
been partly the personal circumstances of Mr Cretecos, who had recently 
married, and partly the financial strains caused by the lack of 
commercial success of the first two Bruce Springsteen albums, which had 
resulted in there being very little money for Mr Cretecos, Mr Appel or 
Mr Springsteen himself. It is not necessary to go into this break-up in 
any detail. There is no doubt that it occurred and there is also no 
doubt that the outcome of it was that Mr Appel purchased Mr Cretecos's 
holdings of fifty per cent of the shares in Laurel Canyon Ltd, Laurel 
Canyon Music Ltd and Laurel Canyon Management Ltd. He did not do so 
directly, because he had insufficient money to pay Mr Cretecos the 
modest sum of money (Mr Kurz said it was only $3,000) which Mr Cretecos 
was prepared to accept for his shares. What happened was that Mr Kruz 
lent Mr Appel the money needed to pay Mr Cretecos and the shares were 
initially transferred by Mr Cretecos to Mr Kurz, who held them as 
collateral security for his loan. About a year later Mr Appel repaid Mr 
Kurz and Mr Kurz transferred the shares to him. From then on Mr Appel 
was the sole beneficial owner of the shares in the three companies and 
he ran those companies as his own.<br>
<br>
It was not only Mr Cretecos who was depressed by the lack of commercial 
success of the first two albums. CBS Records, from which the two 
individuals who had previously supported Mr Springsteen had departed, 
became disenchanted with him and thought of dropping him by not renewing
 the recording agreement. It appears to have been only as the result of 
luck and determination on the part of Mr Springsteen and those acting on
 his behalf that CBS was prevailed upon to exercise its option to renew 
the agreement. A third album was then produced and released in August 
1975 under the name “Born to Run”. It was an immediate success and sold 
over 1 million copies. As a result of this success, sales of the first 
and second albums increased substantially. This was the start of Mr 
Springsteen's international recognition as a star of popular music.<br>
This success was followed by a break-up in the relationship between Mr 
Springsteen and Mr Appel. It is unnecessary to go into the reasons for 
this, but they seem to have been centred upon complaints by Mr 
Springsteen that Mr Appel was exploiting him and failing to pass on to 
him the money which he ought to have received. There was bitter 
litigation between the two of them in the United States. <br>
<br>
<br>
On the same day as the basic agreement was entered into, Mr *195 
Springsteen and LCML entered into a co-publishing agreement. Under this 
agreement Mr Springsteen and LCML were to own in equal shares the 
copyrights throughout the world in 34 specified songs. These included 
the songs entitled “Seaside Bar Song”, “Hey Santa Anna” and “Song to 
Orphans” which I shall mention again later. These jointly owned 
copyrights were to be exploited by Mr Springsteen and LCML for their 
joint benefit in accordance with the terms of the co-publishing 
agreement.<br>
<br>
In 1977 Mr Springsteen also entered into a new recording agreement with 
CBS Records. The agreement itself is expressed to be dated April 15, 
1977 and the term of the agreement is expressed to commence on that 
date, but certain internal indications in the document suggest that it 
was not actually executed until December 16, 1977 or some later date. 
Nothing turns upon this, except that the new agreement with CBS appears 
to make better commercial sense if it is seen as a consequence of the 
break between Mr Springsteen and Mr Appel and treated as having been 
entered into after the basic agreement was signed.<br>
<br>
By the new CBS agreement Mr Springsteen agreed to record and deliver to 
CBS over a period of time eight new albums of recordings. For present 
purposes the important provisions of the agreement are clauses 7.01 and 
7.02. The effect of clause 7.01 is that the copyright of all recordings 
made under the agreement was to belong to Mr Springsteen but CBS was to 
have a licence to manufacture and market copies of the recordings 
throughout the world during a specified period. I understand that this 
is an unusual agreement to be made between a record company and a 
recording artist. The record company usually insists upon owning the 
copyright in the recordings itself. <br>
<br>
I pass now to the year 1979. In April that year Mr Cretecos commenced 
proceedings against Mr Appel. The nature of these proceedings is of some
 interest. Mr Cretecos did not allege that there were any rights or 
property relating to Mr Springsteen remaining as the undistributed 
assets of a dissolved partnership between himself and Mr Appel. <br>
<br>
On July 1, 1985 Mr Springsteen entered into a new recording agreement 
with CBS Records which varied the terms of the 1977 recording agreement 
in certain respects which are not material . However, on June 13, 1995 
Sony  warned that a collection of tracks - “Unearthed” was an 
unauthorised private recording issued in violation of Sony's exclusive 
worldwide rights to manufacture distribute and sell records embodying 
the performance of Mr Springsteen. This circular was widely distributed 
to persons engaged in or connected with the music business.<br>
<br>
”“Unearthed” contained, on the inlay of its case amongst other credits, a
 statement that it was “Licensed from Masquerade Music Ltd”. This 
prompted those representing Mr Springsteen to write to Masquerade, but 
they were informed that Masquerade had no involvement with the 
activities of Flute.<br>
<br>
On March 14, 1997 the writ in the Masquerade action was issued. The 
basis of the action against Masquerade at that stage was that Masquerade
 was said to have authorised the production and marketing of one or both
 of the “Unearthed” CDs. However, two further events led to the scope of
 that action being widened. The first was that shortly before October 
1997 Masquerade imported from JEC or Pony Express Inc. in the United 
States 75 units of a “Before the Fame” CD which had been produced in the
 United States. On October 1, 1997 these 75 units were invoiced by 
Masquerade to a company named *201 Silver Sounds CD Ltd, which I 
understand to be a record dealer or distributor. Mr Winter said that 
this was done at the suggestion of those advising JEC and Pony Express 
Inc. in America, the reason for it being that they considered that it 
would be helpful to Masquerade to be able to show that CD's produced 
outside the United Kingdom on the authority of persons other than 
Masquerade were in circulation in the United Kingdom.<br>
<br>
The second event was that on October 28, 1997 the solicitors then 
representing Masquerade and Mr Winter informed Mr Springsteen's 
solicitors that Masquerade was currently considering intending to 
release and market in the UK for the first time a CD featuring the 
following Bruce Springsteen recordings, namely …<br>
<br>
The names of 13 tracks were then set out. This lead to a threat on the 
part of Mr Springsteen's solicitor to seek an injunction. The matter was
 dealt with by a consent order made by Master Moncaster on November 27, 
1997 which embodies an undertaking on the part of Masquerade and Mr 
Winter not until after judgment in this action to carry out certain acts
 in relation to sound recordings of any of the 13 compositions mentioned
 in the letter of October 28, 1997.<br>
I have so far refrained from going into detail concerning the particular
 compositions which have been included in the various CDs which I have 
mentioned as being issued or proposed to be issued since about 1994. I 
think it will now be convenient to set out this information in tabular 
form as follows, an asterisk indicating that the composition is included
 on the CD:<br>
<br>
Composition<br>
<br>
Unearthed I<br>
Unearthed II<br>
Before the Fame<br>
Dare CD<br>
Eloise<br>
Jesse<br>
Lady and the Doctor<br>
Prodigal Son<br>
Visitation at Fort Horne<br>
Hey Santa Anna<br>
Song to [the] Orphans<br>
Jazz Musician<br>
Camilla Horn<br>
Seaside Bar Song<br>
Arabian Night<br>
Family Song<br>
Evacuation of the West<br>
War Nurse<br>
Marie<br>
Randolph Street (Master of Electricity)<br>
Border Guard<br>
Hollywood Kids<br>
Southern Son<br>
<br>
<br>
As I indicated much earlier, the defence raised to Mr Springsteen's 
claims in both actions consists of an attack on Mr Springsteen's claimed
 title rather than an affirmative case that the defendants themselves 
have a good title to the relevant copyrights. I must therefore set out 
the various links in the chain by which Mr Springsteen claims title.<br>
<br>
It is convenient to begin by mentioning that it was common ground 
between the parties that Mr Springstein was the author of the words and 
the composer of the music of all the compositions I have mentioned in 
the table set out above. It was also common ground that the recordings 
included or proposed to be included in the various CDs I have specified 
are, or are derived from, original recordings made by Mr Springsteen 
himself. In some cases they have been altered in one way or another, 
usually by the addition of extra instrumental sounds, but it is accepted
 that they are reproductions of the original recordings for the purpose 
of copyright law.<br>
<br>
Having noted these facts I must set out the chain of title separately in relation to<br>
1. The words and music; and<br>
2. The sound recordings.<br>
<br>
1. Words and Music<br>
(1) In respect of all the compositions except “Seaside Bar Song”, “Hey Santa Anna” and “Song to the Orphans”<br>
1(1)(a) Mr Springsteen was the author and composer as mentioned above;<br>
1(1)(b) The copyrights vested in “Sioux City Music Inc.” by virtue of the exclusive songwriter's agreement of May 1972;<br>
*203<br>
1(1)(c) Sioux City Music Inc. was a 50:50 partnership of Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos;<br>
1(1)(d) Shortly after Sioux City Music Inc. was incorporated the 
copyrights vested in Sioux City Music Inc. ( i.e. the partnership) were 
assigned by Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos to Sioux City Music Ltd.<br>
1(1)(e) The change of the name of Sioux City Music Ltd to Laurel Canyon Music Ltd did not affect the title.<br>
1(1)(f) As Mr Appel had bought out the interest of Mr Cretecos in Laurel
 Canyon Music Ltd in or before 1974, he was in a position to cause 
Laurel Canyon Music Ltd to deal with its copyrights as part of the basic
 agreement and its ancillary documents.<br>
1(1)(g) Laurel Canyon Music Ltd transferred the copyrights to Mr Springsteen by the basic agreement.<br>
(2) In respect of “Seaside Bar Song”, “Hey Santa Anna” and “Song to the Orphans”<br>
1(2)(a) to (f) The initial chain of title is the same as in links 
1(1)(a) to 1(1)(f) inclusive of the chain relating to the other 
compositions. Thereafter the links are as follows:<br>
1(2)(g) These copyrights vested in Mr Springsteen and Laurel Canyon 
Music Ltd in equal shares by virtue of the co-publishing agreement of 
May 27, 1977.<br>
1(2)(h) By the agreement of May 13, 1983 Laurel Canyon Music Ltd 
transferred its half-share in these copyrights to Mr Springsteen, who 
thereby became sole owner of them.<br>
Mr Tritton's attack on this chain of title challenged in particular 
links 1(1)(b), 1(1)(c) and 1(1)(d) and 1(2)(b), 1(2)(c) and 1(2)(d).<br>
<br>
2. Sound Recordings<br>
<br>
(1) As to all recordings except those of “Jazz Musician”, “Arabian 
Night”, “Visitation at Fort Horne”, “Evacuation of the West”, “Seaside 
Bar Song”, “Hey Santa Anna” and “The Lady and the Doctor”<br>
2(1)(a) These recordings were all made pursuant to the exclusive 
recording agreement of March 1972 made between Mr Springsteen and Laurel
 Canyon Productions and the maker of them for the purposes of the 
relevant legislation (which is section 12 of the Copyright Act 1956) was
 Laurel Canyon Productions, which thereby became the first owner of the 
copyright;<br>
<br>
2(1)(b) Laurel Canyon Productions was a 50:50 partnership of Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos;<br>
2(1)(c) Shortly after Laurel Canyon Limited was incorporated the 
copyrights vested in Laurel Canyon Productions were assigned by Mr Appel
 and Mr Cretecos to Laurel Canyon Ltd.<br>
2(1)(d) As Mr Appel had bought out the interest of Mr Cretecos in Laurel
 Canyon Ltd during or before 1974 he was in a position to cause Laurel 
Canyon to deal with its copyrights as part of the basic agreement;<br>
2(1)(e) Laurel Canyon Ltd transferred its copyrights in these sound recordings to Mr Springsteen by the basic agreement;<br>
(2) As to the recordings of “The Lady and the Doctor”, “Visitation at Fort Horne”, “Jazz Musician” and “Arabian Night”<br>
2(2)(a) These recordings are out-takes of songs which appeared in Mr 
Springsteen's first album “Greetings from Asbury Park NJ”. These were 
recorded in June 1972, probably at the 914 Studios, and the maker was 
Laurel Canyon Productions.<br>
2(2)(b) and (c) These links are the same as links 2(1)(b) and (c) set out above.<br>
2(2)(d) By the variation to the CBS recording agreement made on August 
10, 1972 the copyright in these recordings was assigned by Laurel Canyon
 Ltd to CBS Records.<br>
2(2)(e) By the agreement dated April 15, 1977 between CBS Records and Mr
 Springsteen the copyright in these recordings was assigned to Mr 
Springsteen.<br>
(3) As to the recordings of “Evacuation of the West”, “Seaside Bar Song”, “Santa Anna” and “Lady and the Doctor”<br>
2(3)(a) These recordings were all out-takes of songs which appeared in 
Mr Springsteen's second album “The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street 
Shuffle”. The songs were written after August 1972 and recorded at some 
time between then and the release of the second album in November 1973. 
The maker of the recordings was Laurel Canyon Ltd.<br>
2(3)(b) These recordings became the property of CBS Records by virtue of the recording agreement of June 9, 1972<br>
2(3)(c) By the agreement dated April 15, 1977 between CBS Records and Mr
 Springsteen the copyright in these recordings was assigned to Mr 
Springsteen.<br>
*205<br>
2(3)(d) As an alternative to links 2(3)(b) and (c), if the ownership of 
these recordings did not pass to CBS Records under the CBS recording 
agreement it remained with Laurel Canyon Ltd until 1977, when Laurel 
Canyon Ltd assigned its interest to Mr Springsteen under the basic 
agreement.<br>
<br>
Counsel's attack on Mr Springsteen's title to the recordings was based 
on the proposition that, in the case of each recording, the maker was 
not the entity which Mr Springsteen claims to have been the maker but Mr
 Cretecos, who retained the resulting copyright for himself. If this be 
wrong, Mr Tritton argued that any copyrights in sound recordings which 
became vested in CBS Records were not assigned by CBS Records to Mr 
Springsteen in 1977, as Mr Springsteen contends, but must be taken to 
remain vested in Sony, as CBS Records has now become.<br>
<br>
I must now seek to resolve the issues which arise in these proceedings. I
 shall preface my consideration of each issue with a heading which seeks
 to encapsulate the substance of that issue.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What was the General Relationship of Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos in their Dealings with Mr Springsteen?<br>
</strong><br>
This is a fundamental issue but it is one which I do not find it 
difficult to resolve. I have no doubt that Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos 
were, from the outset of their dealings with Mr Springsteen until their 
activities were taken over by one or other of the companies which they 
incorporated, equal partners in all their activities connected with Mr 
Springsteen.<br>
The evidence in support of this conclusion was, in my judgment, 
overwhelming. Mr Springsteen said that both Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos 
told him that this was their relationship. Mr Appel said in his evidence
 to me that it was their relationship. So did Mr Kurz, who was the 
attorney for both Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos. Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos 
themselves recorded that they were in partnership together by means of 
the certificates which they filed under the New York General Business 
Law in relation to the use of the business names “Laurel Canyon 
Productions” and “Laurel Canyon Management”. It was the perception of Mr
 Vincent Robert Lopez, who was the drummer in the band which performed 
with Mr Springsteen from about 1967 or 1968 until February 1974 and 
whose written statement was received in evidence under the Civil 
Evidence Act 1968, that Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos were partners. The same
 view was also endorsed by Mr Cretecos himself in an affidavit which he 
swore on November 21, 1976 in the proceedings between Mr Springsteen and
 Mr Appel. In particular Mr Cretecos said:<br>
In 1972, at the time when the Laurel Canyon Group entered into *206 
management, recording and publishing contracts with Bruce Springsteen 
(hereinafter “Springsteen”), Appel and I each possessed a fifty (50) 
percent ownership interest in those companies.<br>
This statement to relate to the whole of 1972, both before and after the
 corporations were formed, and the reference to “those companies” seems 
to apply to the unincorporated entities which entered into the contracts
 which he mentions.<br>
Apart from these considerations, it made complete commercial sense for 
Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos to be equal partners in relation to Mr 
Springsteen, whose talents they hoped to exploit for their own joint 
benefit as well as for Mr Springsteen's benefit.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Was there a Songwriter's Agreement 
Antecedent to that Dated “May 1972” and, if so, was it such as to make 
the Songwriter's Agreement of May 1972 Ineffective?</strong><br>
<br>
These are the issues which underlie the defendants' attack on what I 
have described as links 1(1)(b) and 1(2)(b) in Mr Springsteen's chain of
 title to the copyrights in the words and music of the relevant 
compositions. The defendants contend that there was such an antecedent 
agreement and that, having regard to its terms, it prevented the 
songwriter's agreement of May 1972 from passing the copyright in any 
composition to SCMI. No antecedent agreement of the kind propounded by 
the defendants has been produced in evidence, whether in original or 
copy form. The defendants contend, however, that it can be seen from 
other material not only that there was such an agreement but also that 
its terms were such as to lead to the result for which they contend.<br>
The steps in the argument which was said to lead to this conclusion were as follows:<br>
(i) In March 1972 Mr Appel was still working for Wes Farrell or his 
company, Pocketful of Tunes Inc. The terms of his employment are said to
 have been such that the benefit of any transaction under which he 
obtained an interest in musical compositions while he was so employed 
would belong not to him but to his employer. At the very least, Mr Appel
 feared that Mr Farrell might make a claim to this effect.<br>
(ii) The exclusive recording agreement dated March 1972 contained a 
provision referring to an exclusive songwriter's agreement in the form 
of Exhibit A. It was said that this indicates that such a songwriter's 
agreement was intended to be entered into contemporaneously with the 
exclusive recording agreement and it should be assumed that this was 
done.<br>
*207<br>
(iii) No copy of Exhibit A has been produced. In these circumstances it 
should be assumed that the exclusive songwriter's agreement was in the 
form of the printed agreement which was the basis of the agreement 
actually entered into in May 1972, but in view of the fear about Mr 
Farrell it should also be assumed that this agreement was entered into 
not between Mr Springsteen and SCMI or some other Appel/Cretecos entity 
but between Mr Springsteen and Mr Cretecos alone, either under his own 
name or a trading name.<br>
(iv) As the assumed songwriter's agreement transferred to “the 
Publisher”, assumed to be Mr Cretecos by virtue of the reasoning set out
 in (iii) above, the copyright in works written by Mr Springsteen during
 a term of three years from the date of the agreement, assumed to be in 
March 1972, the later agreement purportedly entered into in May 1972 
cannot have vested any copyrights in SCMI, those copyrights being 
already the property of Mr Cretecos by virtue of the antecedent 
agreement.<br>
<br>
While one cannot help but admire the ingenuity, not to say audacity, of 
this argument it is, in my judgment, devoid of any credibility. It is 
not supported by any evidence beyond some references to a fear of what 
Mr Farrell might claim and the mention of Exhibit A. All the important 
steps represent pure speculation. But if one were to resort to 
speculation it is, to my mind, much more likely that Exhibit A was 
indeed the printed form which was used as the basis of the songwriter's 
agreement entered into in May 1972, that the agreement of May 1972 was 
the agreement contemplated by clause 9 and that there was no antecedent 
songwriter's agreement between Mr Springsteen and anyone else.<br>
<br>
If it be possible to hammer a final nail into a coffin so thoroughly 
sealed it comes from the fact that Mr Cretecos himself signed the 
songwriter's agreement of May 1972 on behalf of SCMI. Yet if Counsel's 
argument were correct that songwriter's agreement would be wholly 
inconsistent with the earlier assumed agreement in favour of Mr Cretecos
 himself. Had the assumed agreement existed I cannot believe that Mr 
Cretecos would have been prepared for SCMI to enter into the conflicting
 agreement. The explanation can only be, in my view, that the assumed 
agreement never existed.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What is the Entity Described in the Songwriter's Agreement of May 1972 as “Sioux City Music Inc.”?</strong><br>
<br>
The next attack launched by  counsel was on what I have described as 
links 1(1)(c) and 1(2)(c) in Mr Springsteen's chain of title to the 
copyrights in words and music. What is said is that even if the *208 
songwriter's agreement of May 1972 was an effective agreement it vested 
the relevant copyrights in Mr Cretecos because “Sioux City Music Inc.” 
was the trading name of Mr Cretecos alone, not the trading name of a 
partnership between Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos.<br>
I have no hesitation in rejecting the contentions of the defendants on 
this issue and accepting those of Mr Springsteen. I summarise my reasons
 as follows:<br>
(1) There was no affirmative evidence of any kind to support the theory 
advanced by Mr Tritton. Mr Cretecos was not called to give evidence and 
no attempt was made to adduce in evidence under the Civil Evidence Act 
any statement made by him.<br>
(2) It would be strange, in my view, if Mr Cretecos had been intended to
 become the sole owner, to the exclusion of Mr Appel, of the musical and
 literary copyrights in Mr Springsteen's compositions by virtue of the 
songwriter's agreement. Such an arrangement would be inconsistent with 
the fact that, as I have found, Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos were equal 
partners in all their dealings with Mr Springsteen.<br>
(3) Counsel sought to draw an inference in support of his contentions 
from the absence of any certificate under the New York General Business 
Law in respect of the use of the name “Sioux City Music” or “Sioux City 
Music Inc.”. I am prepared to accept that no such certificate was ever 
filed. However I find it impossible to attach to this fact the 
significance claimed by Counsel<br>
<br>
In the present case I accept—indeed it was not disputed—that Mr 
Springsteen does not have the original assignment (if there was one) or 
any copy of it. He was not himself a party to any such assignment and 
there is no reason to suppose that he ever did have it or a copy of it. 
If he was to produce the document he would have to obtain it from a 
third party. The evidence was that he has, through his representatives, 
made inquiry of Mr Kurz, who said that he was responsible for preparing 
the document, and of Mr Appel who was one of the assignors and a 
director of and ultimately sole shareholder in the assignee company. 
Neither of these persons was able to produce the original or any copy of
 the assignment, although both of them were positive that an assignment 
had been made. Mr Appel has also made inquiries of Mr Marc Elliot, the 
author of a book about Mr Springsteen to whom Mr Appel had supplied a 
number of documents (many of them published in the book) concerning Mr 
Springsteen and his dealings with Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos. Mr Elliot 
was unable to assist.<br>
<br>
If the principle were that a party seeking to adduce secondary oral 
evidence of the existence and contents of a document must first show 
that he has searched exhaustively for the original or an authentic copy 
of the document, Mr Springsteen would not, I think, come within it. But I
 take the principle to be that which emerges from the passages in the 
authorities which I have quoted. In particular the question is whether 
Mr Springsteen has such a document or could produce it in court without 
difficulty. I have no doubt that the answer to both parts of this 
question is in the negative.<br>
I do not think it is necessary, in connection with the admissibility of 
secondary evidence, to consider whether more might have been done by way
 of searching for the document. That would, of course, be a relevant 
matter if it were suggested that the party seeking to adduce the 
secondary evidence had refrained from a more extensive search for better
 evidence for fear of what he might find. I did not understand such a 
suggestion to be made in this case. In any event I would find that what 
has been done on behalf of Mr Springsteen was reasonably thorough, 
albeit falling short of what might be considered to be exhaustive.<br>
I proceed, therefore, to evaluate the secondary evidence of the 
existence and contents of an assignment of musical copyrights from SCMI 
to Sioux City Music Ltd. I start by considering what is said to be the 
form of the alleged assignment. This does not emerge with any great 
clarity from the pleadings or from the witness statements. I thought for
 some time that what was being alleged to have existed was what one 
might call a free-standing, express written assignment dealing 
specifically with the musical and literary copyrights vested in SCMI. It
 emerged, however, from the oral evidence of Mr Kurz that what he was 
asserting was that all the assets of each partnership between Mr Appel 
and Mr Cretecos were assigned by the partners to the relevant newly 
incorporated corporation by the use of a standard form of minute. The 
assets of Laurel Canyon Productions were assigned to Laurel Canyon Ltd; 
those of Laurel Canyon Management to Laurel Canyon Management Ltd; and 
those of Sioux City Music to Sioux City Music Ltd. Mr Kurz said that he 
was able to give evidence about this because he had arranged the 
incorporation of each company and it was part of his task to see to the 
transfer of the assets of each unincorporated business to the successor 
corporation. This was a matter of standard practice which he had carried
 out on many occasions for various clients. He said that he was in no 
doubt that he followed his standard practice in the case of the 
corporations formed on behalf of Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos.<br>
Mr Kurz explained the mechanism which had been adopted by producing a 
standard form of the minutes of the initial meeting of the directors of a
 newly formed corporation. This standard form was supplied by a firm 
named Julius Blumberg, whose business includes that of providing forms 
and precedents of company documents. Mr Kurz said that he always used 
this form.<br>
The form begins by recording certain formal matters, the election of the
 officers, the adoption of a corporate seal and a resolution that the 
corporation should carry on the business for which it was incorporated. 
It then proceeds as follows:<br>
The secretary then presented to the meeting a written proposal from [blank] to this corporation.<br>
Upon motion duly made, seconded and carried, the said proposal was 
ordered filed with the secretary, and he was requested to spread the 
same at length upon the minutes, said proposal being as follows:<br>
The form then contains a blank area, extending to more than a page, in 
which it was evidently intended that a copy of the proposal should be 
set out. There are next recitals of the deliberations on the proposal, 
culminating in the following resolutions:<br>
NOW THEREFORE, IT IS RESOLVED that said offer, as set forth in said 
proposal, be and the same hereby is approved and accepted, and that in 
accordance with the terms thereof, this corporation, shall as full 
payment for said property issue to said offeror(s) or nominee(s) fully 
paid and non-assessable shares of this corporation, and it is *214<br>
FURTHER RESOLVED, that upon the delivery to this corporation of said 
assets and the execution and delivery of such proper instruments as may 
be necessary to transfer and convey the same to this corporation, the 
officers of this corporation are authorised and directed to execute and 
deliver the certificate or certificates for such shares as are required 
to be issued and delivered on acceptance of said offer in accordance 
with the foregoing.<br>
<br>
After recording further resolutions of no significance for present 
purposes the form concludes with a space for a date to be inserted and 
other spaces in which the secretary, chairman and directors of the 
corporation were to sign.<br>
Mr Kurz's evidence was that he prepared for each corporation a written 
proposal which constituted the proposal referred to in the minutes. The 
substance of the proposal in the case of Sioux City Music Ltd (“SCML”) 
was that Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos, as the partners in SCMI, offered to 
transfer to SCML in return for shares in SCML all the copyrights and 
other assets belonging to SCMI. The proposal would have been expressed 
in such a way as to operate as an assignment upon its acceptance. This 
proposal was signed by Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos and a copy of it was 
incorporated in the blank space provided in the form of minutes. The 
only directors of SCML were Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos and they would have
 been present at the initial meeting, would have voted to accept on 
behalf of SCML the proposal which they had made as partners in SCMI. 
They would then have signed the minutes in the space provided for 
signatures at the end.<br>
Mr Kurz's evidence was that the assets of the other Appel/Cretecos 
partnerships were transferred to the appropriate successor corporation 
in a similar way, the assets of Laurel Canyon Productions going to 
Laurel Canyon Ltd and those of Laurel Canyon Management going to Laurel 
Canyon Management Ltd.<br>
<br>
This way of handling the matter seems to my English eyes to be somewhat 
unusual and informal, but Mr Kurz indicated that it was his standard 
practice to deal with the transfer of an unincorporated business to a 
newly formed corporation in this way and he indicated that this was the 
standard practice of other attorneys in New York. This seems to be 
supported by the fact that Julius Blumberg supply a standard form of 
minutes of the kind I have described. I heard no evidence to the 
contrary and I accept that this is the case. Moreover, I accept that, if
 the transaction was carried through in the way described by Mr Kurz, 
the copyright previously vested in SCMI was assigned by SCMI to SCML in a
 manner which satisfied the requirements of section 36(3) of the 
Copyright Act 1956.<br>
<br>
The real question which I have to consider is whether I am satisfied, on
 the balance of probabilities, that the transaction was carried through 
in the way which Mr Kurz described.<br>
<br>
Unhappily I did not find Mr Kurz to be an altogether satisfactory 
witness. Clearly he has considerable experience and, no doubt, skill as a
 lawyer specialising in matters concerning music and entertainment. He 
did not, however, appear to me to have the clear-sighted analytical 
approach which a property lawyer, including a lawyer concerned with 
intellectual property, needs to have. He accepted that in relation to a 
number of matters, usually connected with the names of the various 
Appel/Cretecos entities, he had been careless or sloppy. The summary of 
the effect of his evidence which I have given above makes that evidence 
seem a lot clearer and more precise than it was in fact. I am satisfied 
that it is a fair summary of the substance of the evidence, but it does 
not reproduce the actual language of that evidence.<br>
A large part of the difficulty was that Mr Kurz expressed himself in 
terms of dogmatic assertion rather than giving a cool clear and detailed
 account of the primary facts. Counsel  justifiably drew attention to 
the following instances. Dealing with the question of whether there had 
been an assignment of rights from Laurel Canyon Productions to Laurel 
Canyon Ltd he said:<br>
The paperwork internally was done. The rights were assigned from Appel 
and Cretecos DBA Laurel Canyon Productions to Laurel Canyon Ltd. Period.
 It's absolute. It's certain. It's definite. It happened.<br>
Earlier, when it was suggested that the fact that a letter written in 
April 1975 by CBS to “Laurel Canyon Productions Inc.” indicated that the
 benefit of the contract between CBS and Laurel Canyon Productions Inc. 
had not been assigned to Laurel Canyon Ltd he said assertively:<br>
Since I absolutely and positively know the contract was assigned to Laurel Canyon Ltd it does not suggest that to me.<br>
But he had to accept that he could not specifically recall there being 
any assignments. His evidence that there were assignments was:<br>
… because it is my standard practice to do it. I do not remember 
drafting this assignment. But it would be impossible to complete 
corporate books without putting some assets in. Certainly my clients, 
the partnership known as Appel and Cretecos, doing business as Laurel 
Canyon, didn't have money to put in.<br>
<br>
<br>
Counsel on behalf of Mr Springsteen, contended that, on the balance of 
probabilities, I should conclude that the assignments had taken place. 
He suggested that it was reasonable to suppose, in the absence of 
evidence to the contrary, that when Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos formed 
corporations to carry on their activities relating to Mr Springsteen, 
they should have wished to transfer to the new corporations all the 
assets of the partnerships which had previously carried on those 
activities. Despite the criticisms of the evidence of Mr Kurz and Mr 
Appel, both of them remained positive that there had been assignments. 
Mr Kurz emphasised that it was his usual practice to cause assignments 
to be effected by the means which he had described and there is no 
reason to suppose that he had departed from this practice. Indeed he was
 emphatic that he had not done so. He said:<br>
It would have been impossible to complete the corporate books without 
putting assets in and those [ i.e. the copyrights] were the only assets.<br>
<br>
counsel argued that if  no assignments had been made it was surprising 
that the fact was not noticed by the lawyers who acted for Mr Appel in 
the 1976 litigation and the negotiation of the basic agreement. Had they
 noticed the deficiency they would surely have tried to rectify it, at 
least to the extent of getting Mr Appel to assign his interest in any 
outstanding partnership property. There is no indications of any problem
 of this kind having arisen and Mr Davis suggested that the proper 
inference to make was that the lawyers were satisfied that there was no 
such problem because assignments had been made.<br>
<br>
I have set out the relevant evidence and the points which were made on 
each side in some detail because I have found this much the most 
difficult part of the case to decide. In the end I have concluded that 
the probability is that there were assignments of the kind that Mr Kurz 
deposed to. The criticisms of his testimony and the points derived from 
the documentation are not, in my view, of sufficient force to cause me 
to reject that evidence. There was no directly contradictory evidence 
and I must bear in mind that what was under consideration *218 was a 
series of transactions which took place more than 25 years ago between 
partnerships which were, tacitly at least, then thought to have come to 
an end and companies which appear to have had no commercial purpose 
since 1983 when LCML assigned to Mr Springsteen its half share in the 
musical copyrights which were subject to the co-publishing agreement.<br>
<br>
There are two other factors which are, I think, of some relevance. 
First, if it was the belief of Mr Cretecos that he had a personal 
interest in Mr Springsteen's copyrights after the incorporations of the 
companies, it is somewhat surprising that no mention was made of this 
fact when he sued Mr Appel in 1979. Secondly, if it were the case that 
some musical copyrights remained vested in Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos as 
partners after the companies were incorporated, this fact would be 
destructive of Mr Springsteen's chain of title but it would not 
establish any title on which the defendants could rely. The argument is 
therefore an unattractive one in the hands of the present defendants and
 I do not regret finding myself able to reject it.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Were the Assets of Laurel Canyon Productions
 Assigned to Laurel Canyon Ltd and those of Laurel Canyon Management to 
Laurel Canyon Management Ltd?</strong><br>
<br>
I expressed the preceding issue in terms of an assignment from SCMI to 
SCML in the hope that this would assist in the achievement of clarity. 
But, as will already have become apparent, the relevant evidence was the
 same in respect of assignments from each of the three partnerships to 
the relevant successor corporations. For the reasons which I have 
already given, I find that there were assignments of the assets of LCP 
to Laurel Canyon Ltd and of the assets of LCM to LCML.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Conclusion as to Title to Literary and Musical Copyrights</strong><br>
<br>
If, as I find, the literary and musical copyrights became vested in SCML
 shortly after its incorporation then Mr Springsteen's chain of title is
 made good. There was no real challenge and I find these links to be 
established as well. My conclusion is that Mr Springsteen is, as he 
asserts, the owner of the United Kingdom copyright in the words and 
music of the compositions which were featured in “Unearthed”, “Unearthed
 II” and “Before the Fame”.<br>
<br>
The next group of issues relates to the copyright in the recordings which feature on these CDs.<br>
<br>
Who was the “Maker” of these Recordings for the Purpose of Section 12(4) of the Copyright Act ?<br>
<br>
The best evidence of where and when the relevant recordings were made, 
indeed the only evidence apart from a few remarks by Mr Appel, was given
 by Mr Springsteen. In paragraph 55 of his witness statement he divided 
the recordings into three categories. I will, however, take them in a 
different order from that in which they are presented in Mr 
Springsteen's witness statement.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
Category (1</strong>)<br>
<br>
This consists of “War Nurse”, “Prodigal Son”, “Eloise”, “Jesse”, 
“Camilla Horn”, “Family Song”, “Marie”, “Randolph Street”, “Border 
Guard”, “Song to Orphans”, “Hollywood Kids” and “Southern Son”. The 
chain of title to these recordings which is asserted by Mr Springsteen 
consists of links 2(1)(a) to (e) which I set out earlier. Mr Springsteen
 said that these were all early recordings first made at *220 either Mr 
Appel's office ( i.e. Wes Farrell's office) or at Mr Cretecos's 
apartment. An alternative suggestion by him that they may have been made
 at the 914 Studios can, in my view, be disregarded because the 
recordings seem to date from a time before the CBS recording agreement 
was entered into and the 914 Studios were not used until after that 
time. It also seems a little unlikely that much, if any, recording was 
done at Wes Farrell's office, because this would have been likely to 
excite Wes Farrell's interest. I find, therefore, that most, if not 
indeed all, of these recordings were probably made at the apartment of 
Mr Cretecos before June 9, 1972.<br>
<br>
Counsel  urged on me that, if this was the case, the likelihood is that 
the recordings were made on apparatus owned by Mr Cretecos and on tapes 
owned and provided by him. Counsel pointed out that, at the time, the 
partnership of Laurel Canyon Productions, which is said by Mr 
Springsteen to have been the maker of the recordings, had no receipts 
and he said it would not have been able to pay even the small cost of 
buying tapes.<br>
<br>
I do not accept this conclusion. In my view the fundamental matter is my
 earlier finding that Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos were equal partners in 
all their dealings with Mr Springsteen. The making of these early 
recordings appears to have been an important part of their preparations 
for the promotion of Mr Springsteen. I do not think it at all likely 
that Mr Cretecos, who was then on good terms with his partner Mr Appel, 
would have gone against the interests of the partnership by making 
recordings which were to be his own separate property. If he had 
attempted to do this then it seems to me that he would have been 
required to treat the recordings so made as partnership property. Much 
the more likely scenario, in my view, is that Mr Cretecos made the 
recordings in his capacity as a partner. I do not think it matters 
greatly who paid for the physical tapes on which the recordings were 
made. If Mr Cretecos did so, which is very much a matter of conjecture, 
then I think he bought the tapes on behalf of the partnership and that, 
immediately on purchase, they became property of the partnership, Mr 
Cretecos having nothing more than a right to recoup himself in respect 
of the cost out of partnership funds as and when there were such funds 
out of which he could be reimbursed. If he was not in fact reimbursed 
this would not make the tapes his property. It would merely give him a 
credit item on the taking of the partnership accounts as between himself
 and Mr Appel.<br>
I think that similar reasoning would apply if, contrary to what seems to
 me to be probable, the category (1) recordings were made at Wes 
Farrell's premises. I think it unlikely that Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos 
would have used tape belonging to Mr Farrell.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
Category (2)</strong><br>
<br>
This category consists of “The Lady and the Doctor”, “Visitation at Fort
 Horne”, “Jazz Musician” and “Arabian Night”. The chain of title to the 
songs in this category consists of links 2(2)(a) to (e) as set out 
earlier.<br>
Mr Springsteen's evidence was that these recordings were out-takes from 
his first album “Greetings from Asbury Park NJ” and that they were 
recorded at the 914 Studios after the recording agreement with CBS was 
entered into but, of course, before the album was released on January 1,
 1973. “Out-takes” are, I was told, recordings made with a view to 
inclusion in the album but not in the event included. I shall first 
approach the question of who was the maker of these recordings on the 
footing that Mr Springsteen's evidence is correct in respect of the time
 and place at which the recordings were made.<br>
The entity which had entered into the CBS recording agreement was, as I 
have previously held, Laurel Canyon Productions, whose activities were 
taken over by Laurel Canyon Ltd soon after its incorporation on June 29,
 1972. I see no reason to doubt the evidence of Mr Appel that it was 
Laurel Canyon Ltd, or perhaps Laurel Canyon Productions in respect of 
the first few weeks, which made and paid for the arrangements with the 
914 Studios. While it was the 914 Studios which provided the recording 
equipment and they may well have provided the blank tapes as well, in 
the absence of evidence to the contrary, of which there was none, I 
would infer that the arrangements with the 914 Studios were such that 
the blank tapes used for making recordings became the property of Laurel
 Canyon Ltd (or Laurel Canyon Productions) immediately before they were 
used for recording purposes.<br>
All the recordings in this category except “The Lady and the Doctor” 
were the subject of the supplemental agreement made in August 1972 
between, as I find, Laurel Canyon Ltd and CBS Records. Under this 
agreement the copyright in these recordings was assigned to CBS Records.
 Counsel suggested that this indicates that Mr Springsteen's evidence 
about the time and place at which these recordings were made is not 
correct. He contended that the recordings were made before the CBS 
recording agreement was entered into on June 9, 1972 because, if this 
was not so, there would have been no need for an assignment. This is not
 in accordance with Mr Springsteen's evidence but it is consistent with 
the terms of the letter of August 10, 1972 and may represent the true 
position. If that is the case then the analysis which I have set out in 
the preceding paragraph would not be applicable. But the supplementary 
agreement is expressed to be an assignment of the copyright in these 
recordings to CBS Records and it was signed on behalf of “Laurel Canyon 
Productions Inc.” (which I *222 regard as a misdescription of Laurel 
Canyon Ltd) by both Mr Appel and Mr Cretecos. Even if it were the case 
that, contrary to my view, Mr Cretecos had title to these recordings as 
his own separate property before this supplemental agreement was made, I
 cannot see how, after that agreement, Mr Cretecos could maintain this 
title against CBS Records.<br>
This leaves outstanding “The Lady and the Doctor”. If, as Mr Springsteen
 said, this was recorded at the 914 Studios after June 9 then it was, in
 my judgment, made by Laurel Canyon Productions or Laurel Canyon Ltd. If
 it was made elsewhere before June 9, 1972 then the probability is that 
it was made in the same way as the category (1) recordings and the maker
 was Laurel Canyon Productions which later assigned its resulting 
copyright to Laurel Canyon Ltd.<br>
I am therefore satisfied that, whether or not Mr Springsteen was correct
 in saying that the category (2) recordings were made at the 914 Studios
 after June 9, 1972, the maker of the recordings was either Laurel 
Canyon Ltd or the partnership named Laurel Canyon Productions. If it was
 the partnership then I find that it assigned its rights as maker to 
Laurel Canyon Ltd soon after that company was incorporated, the relevant
 consideration being those I have already discussed. But the copyright 
in the recordings of “Visitation at Fort Horne”, “Jazz Musician” and 
“Arabian Night” went to CBS Records by virtue of the supplemental 
agreement dated August 10, 1972, which in my judgment, operated as an 
assignment by Laurel Canyon Ltd to CBS Records.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
Category (3)</strong><br>
<br>
This category consists of “Evacuation of the West”, “Seaside Bar Song” 
and “Hey Santa Anna”. In respect of these recordings I accept Mr 
Springsteen's evidence that they were out-takes from his second album 
“The Wild and the Innocent and the E-Street Shuffle” and that they were 
made at the 914 Studios after August 1972 but before the publication of 
the album in November 1973. No other hypothesis was put forward as to 
the time and place at which they were made. The maker of these 
recordings must, in my view, have been Laurel Canyon Ltd. The only other
 possibility is that it was the owner of the 914 Studios, but I exclude 
this for the reason I have already given in dealing with category (2). 
However it appears from the unchallenged evidence of Mr Toby Scott 
(given in the form of a Civil Evidence Act statement) that all three 
recordings in this category were subsequently delivered to CBS Records, 
with the result that the copyright in those recordings became the 
property of CBS Records by virtue of the terms of the recording 
agreement of June 9, 1972.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The result of this consideration is as follows:</strong><br>
<br>
(a) I find that the maker of all the recordings which were made before 
the incorporation of Laurel Canyon Ltd was the partnership, Laurel 
Canyon Productions. The maker of all the recordings made after that time
 was Laurel Canyon Ltd.<br>
(b) Laurel Canyon Productions assigned its resulting copyrights, 
together with its other assets so far as there were any, to Laurel 
Canyon Ltd soon after the latter was incorporated.<br>
(c) When recordings were delivered to CBS Records they became the 
property of CBS Records by virtue of the terms of the recording 
agreement of June 9, 1972.<br>
(d) The recordings mentioned in the supplemental agreement of August 10,
 1972 also became the property of CBS Records by virtue of that 
agreement.<br>
(e) The recordings which became the property of CBS Records in 
accordance with conclusions (c) and (d) are those of “Visitation at Fort
 Horne”, “Jazz Musician”, “Arabian Night”, “Evacuation of the West”, 
“Seaside Bar Song” and “Hey Santa Anna”. The recordings of the other 
songs ( i.e. those in category (1) and “The Lady and the Doctor”) 
remained the property of Laurel Canyon Ltd down to the date of the basic
 agreement.<br>
(f) I accept that copyrights in sound recordings which were vested in 
Laurel Canyon Ltd at the date of the basic agreement passed to Mr 
Springsteen by virtue of that agreement. I did not understand this to be
 challenged.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
Did the Agreement Dated April 15, 1977 between Mr Springsteen and CBS 
Records have the Effect of Transferring to Mr Springsteen the Copyright 
in the Springsteen Recordings which had been Vested in CBS Records 
Immediately Before the Date of that Agreement? </strong><br>
<br>
As the copyrights already belonged to CBS the purported licence was 
wholly unnecessary. But this does not justify treating the clause as an 
assignment. I find, therefore, that the copyright in the recordings of 
“Jazz Musician”, “Arabian Night”, “Evacuation of the West”, “Seaside Bar
 Song” and “Hey Santa Anna” are not vested in Mr Springsteen but remain 
outstanding in Sony Music Entertainment Inc. as successor to CBS.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
Overall Conclusion in Respect of Mr Springsteen's Title to the Copyrights in Issue in these Proceedings</strong><br>
<br>
For the reasons which I have endeavoured to explain at what may appear 
to be excessive length I reach the conclusion that the copyright in the 
words and music of (i) all the songs which featured in “Unearthed” and 
“Unearthed II” and in the version of “Before the Fame” which Masquerade 
imported and (ii) all the songs which were intended to be included in 
the version of “Before the Fame” which Masquerade threatened to release 
was, at the time of the alleged infringements, and remains vested in Mr 
Springsteen. I conclude also that the copyright in most of the relevant 
sound recordings was, at the time of the alleged infringements, and 
remains vested in Mr Springsteen. However the copyright in the sound 
recordings of five songs (namely “Jazz Musician”, “Arabian Night”, 
“Evacuation of the West”, “Seaside Bar Song” and “Hey Santa Anna”) 
appears to be vested in Sony.<br>
The fact that Mr Springsteen is not the owner of the copyright in these 
five recordings is, however, of little importance. The inclusion of 
these recordings in a CD not licensed by Mr Springsteen will still be an
 infringement of the copyright in the words and music of which Mr 
Springsteen is, I find, the owner.</div>

<br>
Rolling Stone <br>
<br>
Kurt Loder</strong><br>
<br>
Seattle was the market, but Tacoma was Bruce Springsteen's kind of town.
 He and the E Street Band had flown in from Vancouver on the second leg 
of their Born in the U.S.A. tour, and immediately everybody got sick. 
Something in the air. "The Tacoma aroma," locals call it, a lung-raking 
stench of noxious lumber-milling fumes and other foul industrial 
emissions that imparted a green-gilled tinge to most members of the 
Springsteen tour party and made Bruce himself sick to his stomach. 
Nevertheless, his first, sold-out show at the 25,000-seat Tacoma Dome 
went on as scheduled. Bruce is nothing if not a trouper.<br>
He could have played the Kingdome in Seattle, thirty miles away, where 
the air is clear and the ambiance more upscale. But the smaller Tacoma 
Dome has better acoustics, and anyway, Springsteen — although he's 
something of an upscale guy himself these days — maintains a well-known 
interest in the embattled world of the working class. Tacoma, in its 
bilious way, was perfect.<br>
<br>
He really was sick, though — white as a sheet when he took the stage and
 wiped out for sure when he left it four hours later. But he never let 
it show. He kicked off with a booming, boot-stomping "Born in the 
U.S.A." and then descended into several songs from his starkly brilliant
 Nebraska album, keeping the audience with him all the way. He's got his
 raps down on this tour, talking about "powerlessness" at one point and,
 at another, "blind faith — whether it's in your girlfriend or the 
government." "This is 1984," he tells the howling crowds, "and people 
seem to be searchin' for something."<br>
<br>
In Tacoma, before counting off the haunting "My Hometown," he delivered 
an extended plug for a community-action group called Washington Fair 
Share, which recently helped force the clean-up of an illegal landfill 
and is working to overturn Governor John Spellman's veto of a "right to 
know" law that would require local industries to inform employees of all
 toxic chemicals they're being exposed to on the job. "They think that 
people should come before profit, and the community before the 
corporation," Bruce announced. And then added, pointedly, "This is your 
hometown."<br>
<br>
This is world-class rock &amp; roll, all right, but something more 
besides. And in 1984, Bruce Springsteen has become something decidedly 
more than just another rock star with an album to flog. He is a national
 presence, his charisma co-opted by as unlikely an adherent as Ronald 
Reagan — even as Springsteen himself pokes relentlessly through the 
withered and waterless cultural underbrush of the president's new 
American Eden. In pursuit of what can only be called his dream, 
Springsteen has been tenacious: dropping out of Ocean County College in 
his native New Jersey in 1968 to take his unlikely chances as a 
songwriting rock &amp; roller and stubbornly waiting out a devastating, 
yearlong legal dispute with his then manager, Mike Appel, that prevented
 him from recording for nearly a year in the mid-Seventies. After 
selling 2 million copies of his 1980 double album, The River, he 
followed it up with Nebraska, a striking, guitar-and-voice meditation on
 various kinds of pain and craziness in the American hinterlands, and 
then followed that up with Born in the USA, which treats some of the 
same themes within a full-bore band context and has suddenly become his 
biggest album to date.<br>
<br>
As the tour progressed, Springsteen sat down for interviews in Oakland, 
California — where he plugged the Berkeley Emergency Food Project — and 
in Los Angeles, where he maintains a house in the Hollywood Hills. Asked
 how he keeps his tightly structured stage show fresh down to the last 
mock-rambling anecdote, he said, "It's a matter of: Are you there at the
 moment? Are you living it?" It's a test he appears to pass both on and 
off the stage.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
"Born in the U.S.A.," the title track of your current album, is one of 
those rare records: a rousing rock &amp; roll song that also gives voice
 to the pain of forgotten people — in this case, America's Vietnam 
veterans. How long have you been aware of the Vietnam vets' experience?</strong><br>
<br>
I don't know if anybody could imagine what their particular experience 
is like. I don't think I could, you know? I think you had to live 
through it. But when you think about all the young men and women that 
died in Vietnam, and how many died since they've been back — surviving 
the war and coming back and not surviving — you have think that, at the 
time, the country took advantage of their selflessness. There was a 
moment when they were just really generous with their lives.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What was your own experience with Vietnam?</strong><br>
<br>
I didn't really have one. There wasn't any kind of political 
consciousness down in Freehold in the late Sixties. It was a small town,
 and the war just seemed very distant. I mean, I was aware of it through
 some friend that went. The drummer in my first band was killed in 
Vietnam. He kind of signed up and joined the marines. Bart Hanes was his
 name. He was one of those guys that was jokin' all the time, always 
playin' the clown. He came over one day and said, "Well, I enlisted. I'm
 goin' to Vietnam." I remember he said he didn't know where it was. And 
that was it. He left and didn't come back. And the guys that did come 
back were not the same.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">How did you manage to escape the draft?</strong><br>
<br>
I got a 4-F. I had a brain concussion from a motorcycle accident when I 
was seventeen. Plus, I did the basic Sixties rag, you know: fillin' out 
the forms all crazy, not takin' the tests. When I was nineteen, I wasn't
 ready to be that generous with my life. I was called for induction, and
 when I got on the bus to go take my physical, I thought one thing: I 
ain't goin'. I had tried to go to college, and I didn't really fit in. I
 went to a real narrow-minded school where people gave me a lot of 
trouble and I was hounded off the campus — I just looked different and 
acted different, so I left school. And I remember bein' on that bus, me 
and a couple of guys in my band, and the rest of the bus was probably 
sixty, seventy percent black guys from Asbury Park. And I remember 
thinkin', like, what makes my life, or my friends lives, more expendable
 than that of somebody who's goin' to school? It didn't seem right. And 
it was funny, because my father, he was in World War II, and he was the 
type that was always sayin', "Wait till the army gets you. Man, they're 
gonna get that hair off of you. I can't wait. They gonna make a man 
outta you." We were really goin' at each other in those days. And I 
remember I was gone for three days, and when I came back, I went in the 
kitchen, and my folks were there, and they said, "Where you been?" And I
 said, "Well, I had to go take my physical." And they said, "What 
happened?" And I said, "Well, they didn't take me." And my father sat 
there, and he didn't look at me, he just looked straight ahead. And he 
said, "That's god." It was, uh...I'll never forget that. I'll never 
forget that.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Ironic, then, that today you're the toast of
 the political right, with conservative columnist George Will lauding 
your recent Washington D.C. concert and President Reagan invoking your 
name while campaigning in your home state, New Jersey.</strong><br>
<br>
I think what's happening now is people want to forget. There was 
Vietnam, there was Watergate, there was Iran — we were beaten, we were 
hustled, and then we were humiliated. And I think people got a need to 
feel good about the country they live in. But what's happening, I think,
 is that need — which is a good thing — is getting' manipulated and 
exploited. And you see the Reagan reelection ads on TV — you know: "It's
 morning in America." And you say, well, it's not morning in Pittsburgh.
 It's not morning about 125th Street in New York. It's midnight, and, 
like, there's a bad moon risin'. And that's why when Reagan mentioned my
 name in New Jersey, I felt it was another manipulation, and I had to 
disassociate myself from the president's kind words.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
But didn't you play into the hands of professional patriots by releasing
 an election-year album called 'Born in the U.S.A., with the American 
flag bannered across the front?</strong><br>
<br>
Well, we had the flag on the cover because the first song was called 
"Born in the U.S.A.," and the theme of the record kind of follows from 
the themes I've been writing about for at least the last six or seven 
years. But the flag is a powerful image, and when you set that stuff 
loose, you don't know what's gonna be done with it.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Actually, I know one fan who infers from the
 rump shot on the album cover that you're actually pissing on the flag. 
Is there a message there?</strong><br>
<br>
No, no. That was unintentional. We took a lot of different types of 
pictures, and in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the 
picture of my face, that's what went on the cover. I didn't have any 
secret message. I don't do that very much.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Well, what is your political stance? Election Day is two weeks away: are you registered to vote?</strong><br>
<br>
I'm registered, yeah. I'm not registered as one party or another. I 
don't generally think along those lines. I find it very difficult to 
relate to the whole electoral system as it stands. I don't really...I 
suppose if there was somebody who felt strong enough about at some 
point, some day, you know...<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
You don't think Mondale would be any better than Reagan?</strong><br>
<br>
I don't know. I think there are significant differences, but I don't 
know how significant. And it's very difficult to tell by reelection 
rhetoric. It seems to always change when they all of a sudden get in. 
That's why I don't feel a real connection to electoral politics right 
now — it can't be the best way to find the best man to do the hardest 
job. I want to try an adjust work more directly with people; try to find
 some way that my band can tie into the communities that we come into. I
 guess that's a political action, a way to just bypass that whole 
electoral thing. Human politics. I think that people on their own can do
 a lot. I guess that's what I'm tryin' to figure out now: where do the 
aesthetic issues that you write about intersect with some sort of 
concrete action, some direct involvement, in the communities that your 
audience comes from? It seems to be an inevitable progression of what 
our band has been doin', of the idea that we got into this for. We 
wanted to play because we wanted to meet girls, we wanted to make a ton 
of dough, and we wanted to change the world a little bit, you know?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Have you ever voted?</strong><br>
<br>
I think I voted for McGovern in 1972.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What do you really think of Ronald Reagan?</strong><br>
<br>
Well, I don't know him. But I think he presents a very mythic, very 
seductive image, and it's an image that people want to believe in. I 
think there's always been a nostalgia for a mythical America, for some 
period in the past when everything was just right. And I think the 
president is the embodiment of that for a lot of people. He has a very 
mythical presidency. I don't know if he's a bad man. But I think there's
 a large group of people in this country whose dreams don't mean that 
much to him, that just get indiscriminately swept aside. I guess my view
 of America is of a real big-hearted country, real compassionate. But 
the difficult thing out there right now is that the social consciousness
 that was a part of the Sixties has become, like, old-fashioned or 
something. You go out, you get your job, and you try to make as much 
money as you can and have a good time on the weekend. And that's 
considered okay.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The state of the nation has weighed heavily,
 if sometimes subtly, on the characters depicted in your songs over the 
years. Do you see your albums as being connected by an evolving 
sociopolitical point of view?</strong><br>
<br>
I guess what I was always interested in was doing a body of work — 
albums that would relate to and play off of each other. And I was always
 concerned with doin' albums, instead of, like, collections of songs. I 
guess I started with The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle, in
 a funny way — particularly the second side, which kind of syncs 
together. I was very concerned about gettin' a group of characters and 
followin' them through their lives a little bit. And so, on Born to Run,
 Darkness on the Edge of Town and The River I tried to hook things up. I
 guess in Born to Run, there's that searchin' thing; that record to me 
is like religiously based, in a funny kind of way. Not like orthodox 
religion, but it's about basic things, you know? That searchin', and 
faith, and the idea of hope. And then on Darkness, it was kind of like a
 collision that happens between this guy and the real world. He ends up 
very alone and real stripped down. Then, on The River, there was always 
that thing of the guy attemptin' to come back, to find some sort of 
community. It had more songs about relationships — "Stolen Car," "The 
River," "I Wanna Marry You," "Drive All Night," even "Wreck on the 
Highway" - people tryin' to find some sort of consolation, some sort of 
comfort in each other. Before The River, there's almost no songs about 
relationships. Very few. Then, on Nebraska...I don't know what happened 
on that one. That kinda came out of the blue.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
Wasn't the central inspiration Terrence Malick's 'Badlands,' the film 
about mass murderer Charles Starkweather and his girlfriend, Caril 
Fugate?</strong><br>
<br>
Well, I had already written "Mansion on the Hill" during the last tour. 
Then I went home — I was living in a place called Colts Neck, New Jersey
 — and I remember I saw Badlands, and I read this book about them, 
Caril, and it just seemed to be a mood that I was in at the time. I was 
renting a house on this reservoir, and I didn't go out much, and for 
some reason I just started to write. I wrote Nebraska, all those songs, 
in a couple of months. I was interested in writing kind of smaller than I
 had been, writing with just detail — which I kind of began to do on The
 River. I guess my influences at the time were the movie and these 
stories I was reading by Flannery O'Connor — she's just incredible.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Was there something about Starkweather that struck you as emblematic of the American condition?</strong><br>
<br>
I think you can get to a point where nihilism, if that's the right word,
 is overwhelming, and the basic laws that society has set up — either 
religious or social laws — become meaningless. Things just get really 
dark. You lose those constraints, and then anything goes. The forces 
that set that in motion, I don't know exactly what they'd be. I think 
just a lot of frustration, lack of findin' somethin' that you can hold 
on to, lack of contact with people, you know? That's one of the most 
dangerous things, I think — isolation. Nebraska was about that American 
isolation: what happens to people when they're alienated from their 
friends and their community and their government and their job. Because 
those are the things that keep you sane, that give meaning to life in 
some fashion. And if they slip away, and you start to exist in some void
 where the basic constraints of society are a joke, then life becomes 
kind of a joke. And anything can happen.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
Did the stark acoustic format you eventually chose for 'Nebraska' just seem the most appropriate setting for such dark material?</strong><br>
<br>
Well, initially, I was just doing songs for the next rock album, and I 
decided that what always took me so long in the studio was the writing. I
 would get in there, and I just wouldn't have the material written, or 
it wasn't written well enough, and so I'd record for a month, get a 
couple of things, go home write some more, record for another month — it
 wasn't very efficient. So this time, I got a little Teac four-track 
cassette machine, and I said, I'm gonna record these songs, and if they 
sound good with just me doin' 'em, then I'll teach'em to the band. I 
could sing and play the guitar, and then I had two tracks to do 
somethin' else, like overdub a guitar or add a harmony. It was just 
gonna be a demo. Then I had a little Echoplex that I mixed through, and 
that was it. And that was the tape that became the record. It's amazing 
that it got there, 'cause I was carryin' that cassette around with me in
 my pocket without a case for a couple of week, just draggin' it around.
 Finally, we realized, "Uh-oh, that's the album." Technically, it was 
difficult to get it on a disc. The stuff was recorded so strangely, the 
needle would read a lot of distortion and wouldn't track in the wax. We 
almost had to release it as a cassette.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
I understand "Born in the U.S.A." was actually written around the time 
of Nebraska; do any other songs on the new album date from that period?</strong><br>
<br>
Actually, half the Born in the U.S.A. album was recorded at the time of 
Nebraska. When we initially went in the studio to try to record Nebraska
 with the band, we recorded the first side of Born in the U.S.A., and 
the rest of the time I spent tryin' to come up with the second side — 
"Bobby Jean," "My Hometown," almost all those songs. So if you look at 
the material, particularly on the first side, it's actually written very
 much like Nebraska — the characters and the stories, the style of 
writing --except it's just in the rock-band setting.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">You've certainly achieved mass-market 
success this year. The Born in the U.S.A. tour is selling out arenas 
across the country, and the album has sold over 5 million copies 
worldwide. Has becoming a rich man changed you at all?<br>
</strong><br>
Yeah, there's a change. It doesn't make living easier, but it does make 
certain aspects of your life easier. You don't have to worry about rent,
 you can buy things for your folks and help out your friends, and you 
can have a good time, you know? There were moments where it was very 
confusing, because I realized that I was a rich man, but I felt like a 
poor man inside.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">In what way?</strong><br>
<br>
Just my outlook on things in general, because I guess it was formed when
 I was young. I didn't get to a situation where I had any dough in the 
bank till around the River tour. And this tour, we've been doin' great 
so far. But I don't know if money changes you. I guess I don't really 
think it does change you. It's an inanimate thing, a tool, a 
convenience. If you've got to have a problem, it's a good problem to 
have.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Obviously you don't spend your money on clothes. What do you do with it?</strong><br>
<br>
I'm just figuring that out right now. One of the things I can do is play
 benefits and help people out that need help, people that are 
strugglin', you know, tryin' to get somethin' goin' on their own. Money 
was kind of part of the dream when I started. I don't think...I never 
felt like I ever played a note for the money. I think if I did, people 
would know, and they'd throw you out of the joint. And you'd deserve to 
go. But at the same time, it was a part of the dream. Part of like...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The pink Cadillac?</strong><br>
<br>
Yeah, the pink Cadillac. Me and Steve [Van Zandt, his former guitarist] 
used to sit around and say, "Yeah, when we make it, we're gonna do this 
and that...."<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What did you plan to do?</strong><br>
<br>
Mainly, we planned to be just like the Rolling Stones. They were the 
band we liked the best at the time. But you grow up, and when you 
finally put that suit of clothes on, sometimes they don't fit, or they 
fit differently, and you're a different person, and what you're gonna do
 is different, I guess. But in general, I do enjoy the success we've had
 and the fact that we have an audience, and I've enjoyed the financial 
success that I've had. It's helped me do some things I've wanted to do.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Would it be an exaggeration to say that you're a millionaire?</strong><br>
<br>
No, no. I definitely got that much.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Is it possible for you to have normal romantic attachments?</strong><br>
<br>
I guess so. I've had steady girlfriends in the past. I'm just not really
 lookin' to get married at this point. I've made a commitment to doin' 
my job right now, and that's basically what I do. Someday I'd like to 
have the whole nine yards — the wife, the kids.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">I'm trying to picture Bruce Springsteen just asking a normal girl for a casual date.</strong><br>
<br>
You just do it. You're out in a bar or somethin', and you meet somebody — you can't worry.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">So you've never allowed yourself to become isolated, to slip into the Elvis Presley syndrome?</strong><br>
<br>
One of the things that was always on my mind to do was to maintain 
connections with the people I'd grown up with and the sense of the 
community where I came from. That's why I stayed in New Jersey. The 
danger of fame is in forgetting or being distracted. You see it happen 
to so many people. Elvis' case must have been tremendously difficult. 
Because, I mean, I feel the difference between selling a million records
 and selling 3 million records — I can feel a difference out on the 
street. The type of fame that Elvis had and that I think Michael Jackson
 has, the pressure of it and the isolation that it seems to require has 
gotta be really painful. I wasn't gonna let that happen to me. I wasn't 
gonna get to a place where I said: "I can't go in here. I can't go to 
this bar. I can't go outside." For the most part, I do basically what 
I've always done. I'll walk into a club, and people will just say hi, 
and that's it. And I'll get up and play. I believe that the life of a 
rock &amp; roll band will last as long as you look down into the 
audience and can see yourself and your audience looks up at you and can 
see themselves — and as long as those reflections are human, realistic 
ones. The biggest gift your fans can give you is just treatin' you like a
 human being, because anything else dehumanizes you. If the price of 
fame is that you have to be isolated from the people you write for, then
 that's too fuckin' high a price to pay.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
You once tried to meet Elvis Presley by jumping over the wall at his 
mansion, Graceland. The attempt failed, but have you met most of your 
other idols in the music business?</strong><br>
<br>
Well, I'm real ambivalent about meetin' people I admire. You know the 
old saying: Trust the art, not the artist. I think that's true. I think 
somebody can do real good work and be a fool in a variety of ways. I 
think my music is probably better than I am. I mean, like, your music is
 your ideals a lot of times, and you don't live up to those ideals all 
the time. You try, but you fall short, and you disappoint yourself. With
 my idols, I just like their music. If the occasion comes up, I like to 
meet them, but I never really seek it out very much, because it's their 
music that I like in general. People always say they were disappointed 
by Elvis, they were let down. I'm not sure that's the right way to look 
at it. I don't think anybody was disappointed by his great records, you 
know?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">You, at least, seem unlikely ever to emulate
 Elvis's drug problems. Is it true that after nearly twenty years in the
 rock &amp; roll world, you've truly never so much as smoked a joint?</strong><br>
<br>
I never did any drugs. When I was at that age when it was popular, I 
wasn't really in a social scene a whole lot. I was practicing in my room
 with my guitar. So I didn't have the type of pressure that kids might 
have today. Plus, I was very concerned with being in control at the 
time. I drink a little bit now. There's nights when I'll go out and do 
it up. But not too much when we're touring, because the show is so 
physically demanding, and you gotta be so prepared.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">There's also a notable lack — in your songs,
 your stage show, your videos — of any sort of exploitative sexual 
imagery of the kind that routinely spices, say, MTV.</strong><br>
<br>
I don't know. I think if you just try to have a basic respect for 
people's humanness, you just generally don' t want to do those things. I
 think it's difficult, because we were all brought up with sexist 
attitudes and racist attitudes. But hopefully, as you grow older, you 
get some sort of insight into that and — I know it's corny — try to 
treat other people the way you would want them to treat you. I think 
that what happens is, when you're young, you feel powerless. If you're a
 child and you're lookin' up at the world, the world is frightening. 
Your house, no matter how small it is, it seems so big. Your parents 
seem huge. I don't believe this feeling ever quite leaves you. And I 
think what happens is, when you get around fifteen or sixteen, a lot of 
your fantasies are power fantasies. And I think that's one of the things
 that gets exploited by some of the more demeaning types of music. If 
you're a kid, you feel powerless, but you don't know how to channel that
 powerlessness. I was lucky; I was able to deal with it with the guitar.
 I said, well, I feel weak, but when I do this, when I feel this, when I
 hold it, I feel a little stronger. I feel like I've got some line on my
 life. I feel I have some control. That feelin' of weakness, of 
powerlessness, is there. And I think it gets exploited and misdirected. 
One of the problems in the United States is that "united in our 
prejudices we stand," you know? What unites people, very often, is their
 fear. What unites white people in some places is their fear of black 
people. What unites guys is maybe a denigrating attitude toward women — 
or sometimes maybe women have an attitude toward men. And these things 
are then in turn exploited by politicians, which turns into fear — 
knee-jerk fear of the Russians or of whatever ism is out there. Or in a 
very subtle, kind of indirect way — like some of our economic policies 
are a real indirect kind of racism in which the people that get affected
 most are black people who are at the lower end of the economic 
spectrum. And I think somewhere inside, people know this — I really do. 
They don't fess up to it, but somewhere inside there's a real meanness 
in using things this way.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What keeps you going at age thirty-five?</strong><br>
<br>
I was lucky. I understood that it's the music that keeps me alive, and 
my relationships with my friends and my attachment to the people and the
 places I've known. That's my lifeblood. And to give that up for, like, 
the TV, the cars, the houses — that's not the American dream. Those are 
the booby prizes. And if you fall for them — if, when you achieve them, 
you believe that this is the end in and of itself — then you've been 
suckered in. Because those are the consolation prizes, if you're not 
careful, for selling yourself out or lettin' the best of yourself slip 
away. So you gotta be vigilant. You gotta carry the idea you began with 
further. And you gotta hope that you're headed for higher ground.<br>

Bruce Rising<br>
By Josh Tyrangiel; Kate Carcaterra<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen has a songbook that reads like a union membership log.
 He has written about cops, fire fighters, soldiers, road builders, 
steelworkers, factory laborers and migrant workers. Springsteen himself 
has held exactly one real job. For a few weeks in 1968 when he was 18, 
he worked as a gardener. But his gift is not horticulture. His great 
gift--the one that makes him the best rock 'n' roll singer of his 
era--is empathy. Springsteen doesn't know what a 40-hour workweek feels 
like, but he knows how a 40-hour workweek makes you feel. "If you roll 
out of bed in the morning," he says, "even if you're the deepest 
pessimist or cynic, you just took a step into the next day. When I was 
growing up, we didn't have very much, but I saw by my mom's example that
 a step into the next day was very important. Hey, some good things 
might happen. You may even hold off some bad things that could happen."<br>
<br>
On The Rising, his first album of new material in seven years, 
Springsteen is again writing about work, hope and American life as it is
 lived this very moment. The Rising is about Sept. 11, and it is the 
first significant piece of pop art to respond to the events of that day.
 Many of the songs are written from the perspectives of working people 
whose lives and fates intersected with those hijacked planes. The songs 
are sad, but the sadness is almost always matched with optimism, 
promises of redemption and calls to spiritual arms. There is more rising
 on The Rising than in a month of church.<br>
<br>
The Rising also marks the return of the E Street Band. The band--seven 
hardworking Joes in their 50s and 60s, plus Springsteen's wife, backup 
singer and Jersey girl Patti Scialfa--has always been a proxy for the 
Springsteen audience. The E Streeters don't eat meat sandwiches out of 
metal lunch boxes, but it's easy to believe that they could. Their 
15-year absence from Springsteen's recorded music opened a gulf between 
the Boss and his core fans, one that The Rising seems intent on closing.<br>
<br>
When Springsteen cut the band loose in 1987, Bruce was a major American 
somebody who had made his name singing about nobodies. But money shines a
 lot brighter than empathy, and after Born in the U.S.A., Springsteen 
wasn't just rich; he was loaded, and everyone in America knew it. Rather
 than continue as the wealthy rock-poet of the American grunt and risk 
being labeled inauthentic, Springsteen set out for new territory. As he 
put it in Better Days, a 1992 song, "It's a sad funny ending to find 
yourself pretending/A rich man in a poor man's shirt."<br>
<br>
So, after a failed marriage to model-actress Julianne Phillips, 
Springsteen moved into a $14 million mansion in Beverly Hills, Calif. 
(the faithful jeered), wed Scialfa in 1991 (the faithful cheered) and 
sang about relationships, kids and his ennui (the faithful shrugged). 
Then in '95 he put out an album of folk songs, The Ghost of Tom Joad. It
 won a Grammy for best contemporary folk album, but it felt more like a 
Woody Guthrie tribute than a Springsteen record. The songs were stark 
and compelling, but the old optimism was gone. The characters of Tom 
Joad lived on the fringes of American life, and they died quickly and 
violently. "I just wasn't sure of my rock voice," says Springsteen. "I 
wasn't sure of what it sounded like or what it was going to be doing or 
what its purpose was at that moment. The band wasn't functioning 
together at the time, so I kind of went to where I thought I could be 
most useful."<br>
<br>
One important fact about Springsteen: he thinks a lot about being 
Springsteen. After Tom Joad, he did some hard thinking--about himself, 
his family and the job of being Bruce--and decided to move back to New 
Jersey, where he now occupies a sprawling estate just a few minutes' 
drive from where he grew up. "Patti and I, we're both Irish-Italian," he
 says. "We have a lot of family here, and we wanted the kids"--they have
 three, ages 12, 10 and 8--"to have that experience of knowing people 
who do lots of different kinds of jobs. The guy who runs the 
dry-cleaning service or the guy who hunts and fishes and works on the 
farm." The homecoming also inspired Springsteen to climb tentatively 
back into rock 'n' roll. After an E Street reunion tour in 2000 (they 
played only a smattering of new songs), Springsteen started writing an 
album of rock tunes. Then the planes hit.<br>
<br>
"I was having breakfast, and then I was in front of the television. A 
little while later," says Springsteen, "I drove across the local bridge.
 The Trade Center sits right in the middle of it when you look toward 
New York." Having been spared any personal tragedy, Springsteen tells 
his where-were-you-when story sheepishly. His greatest hardship was 
having to explain the day to his kids. "I think it's become placed in 
their lives in the same way that the nuclear bomb was when I was a kid. 
It's the really dark, scary thing, and they're not sure where it can 
touch them. Can it touch them at school? Can it touch them in the house?
 What are its limits? Does it have limits? It's mysterious, you know."<br>
<br>
Springsteen's home county, Monmouth, lost 158 people in the towers, more
 than any other in New Jersey. After Sept. 11, Springsteen discovered 
that where he could be most useful was his own backyard. "This was one 
of those moments," he says, "when the years that I've put in and the 
relationships that I've developed and nurtured with my audience--this 
was one of those times when people want to see you."<br>
<br>
Springsteen opened the America: A Tribute to Heroes telethon with My 
City of Ruins, an unreleased song from a few years ago about Asbury 
Park, N.J., that proved eerily adaptable to 9/11. He also played a few 
local fund raisers, but mostly he grieved along with the rest of the 
nation. As he read the New York Times obituaries ("I found those to be 
very, very meaningful--incredibly powerful," he says), he couldn't help 
noticing how many times Thunder Road or Born in the U.S.A. was played at
 a memorial service or how many victims had a pile of old Springsteen 
concert-ticket stubs tucked away in their bedroom. Within days after the
 towers collapsed, Springsteen was writing songs.<br>
<br>
"I have a room off my bedroom that I just go in," he says. "All my 
things are in there--books, CDs, guitars, boots, belts, anything I've 
collected along the way. It's quite a carnival." When he writes, 
Springsteen generally sits at the same table he has used for 20 years 
and, by inserting a few small narrative details, tries to create songs 
that will carry his listeners away. "The difference," he says, "was that
 on this record, you're writing about something that everyone saw and 
had some experience with, and obviously some people experienced it much 
more intimately."<br>
<br>
To flesh out the intimacies of Sept. 11, Springsteen had to do some 
reporting. Stacey Farrelly's husband Joe was a fire fighter with 
Manhattan Engine Co. 4 and, as his obituaries noted, a lifelong 
Springsteen fan. Recalls his widow: "At the beginning of October, I was 
home alone and, uh, heavily medicated. I picked up the phone, and a 
voice said, 'May I please speak to Stacey? This is Bruce Springsteen.'" 
They talked for 40 minutes. "After I got off the phone with him, the 
world just felt a little smaller. I got through Joe's memorial and a 
good month and a half on that phone call."<br>
<br>
Suzanne Berger's husband Jim was memorialized in the New York Times 
under the headline FAN OF THE BOSS. She too got a call. "He said, 'I 
want to respect your privacy, but I just want you to know that I was 
very touched, and I want to know more about your husband,'" she recalls.
 "He wanted to hear Jim's story, so I told him."<br>
<br>
Springsteen freezes when the subject of the phone calls comes up. He 
doesn't want publicity for ordinary kindness, and he doesn't want to be 
seen as exploiting people whose suffering is well known. But for 
Springsteen, the experience of hearing Berger talk about how her husband
 hustled dozens of people out of the south tower before it collapsed 
around him or of listening to Farrelly recall some of her husband's 
copious daily love notes was obviously critical to the creation of The 
Rising.<br>
<br>
The success of Springsteen's reporting can be measured by the music. The
 Rising opens with Lonesome Day, one of the few songs told in 
Springsteen's own voice. "House is on fire, viper's in the grass," he 
sings. "A little revenge, and this too shall pass." Like most of The 
Rising, Lonesome Day gets you moving in spite of its topic. The 
fire-fighter songs, Into the Fire and the first single, The Rising, put 
the listener in the physical space of the crumbling towers, but they 
never get at the emotions behind the fire fighters' courage. The songs 
are rousing and redemptive--and a little shallow. But almost every other
 song on the album has an aha! moment when Springsteen touches his 
subject's secret heart. On Empty Sky, his protagonist looks at the space
 where the towers used to be and seethes, "I want a kiss from your 
lips/I want an eye for an eye."<br>
<br>
Loss is everywhere on The Rising, but the album's best track, You're 
Missing, penetrates the unique horror of having a loved one turned to 
ash. Lyrically the song is a catalog of absence: a coffee cup on the 
counter, a newspaper on a doorstep. But the song rises to greatness 
because Springsteen not only recognizes dramatic details but also knows 
what they mean. "Loss is about what you miss," he says. "You miss a 
person's physical being--their skin, their hair, the way they smell, the
 way they make you feel. You miss their body. When my father died, my 
children wanted to touch him, to touch his body. And the kids got 
something out of it. The people in this situation, you know, they aren't
 going to get that." That's why You're Missing is one song that does not
 end hopefully: "God's drifting in heaven, devil's in the mailbox/Got 
dust on my shoes, nothing but teardrops."<br>
<br>
Springsteen's liberal, humanist side comes out in the last two songs he 
wrote for The Rising. Worlds Apart is a new take on the classic story of
 lovers separated by a cultural divide, the lovers in this case being an
 American and a Middle Eastern Muslim. Springsteen sings, "We'll let 
love build a bridge, over mountains draped in stars/ I'll meet you on 
the ridge, between these worlds apart." Paradise opens from the 
perspective of a suicide bomber ("In the crowded marketplace, I drift 
from face to face") before transitioning to the mind of a woman who lost
 her husband in the Pentagon ("I brush your cheek with my fingertips/ I 
taste the void upon your lips)." The first verse was inspired by the 
newspapers, the second by a phone conversation Springsteen had with a 
Washington widow. The song ends with the realization that the afterlife 
is no solace to the living.<br>
<br>
What's missing on The Rising is politics. Springsteen says he has never 
considered himself a political person, but after Ronald Reagan tried to 
hijack Born in the U.S.A. for his 1984 re-election campaign, the singer 
developed a spare but effective political voice that he generally raises
 on behalf of liberal causes and the occasional liberal candidate. In 
1991 he played a fund raiser for the Christic Institute, a radical think
 tank that has repeatedly accused the U.S. government of illegal covert 
action in Latin America. On the subject of America's current foreign 
policy, he is with the mass of public opinion. "I think the invasion in 
Afghanistan was handled very, very smoothly," he says.<br>
<br>
The absence of politics doesn't mean The Rising is controversy free. For
 some Springsteen fans, it arrives too quickly on the heels of tragedy 
to leave its motives unexamined. Charles Cross, who for 16 years 
published and edited the authoritative Springsteen fanzine, Backstreets,
 heard The Rising at a listening party for diehards. "They're really 
marketing it as a Sept. 11 album," he says. "I think we want art that 
can deal with it, but it's still such an uncomfortable thing, and it's 
still pretty fresh. Frankly, the commercial element of it really scares 
me."<br>
<br>
Springsteen suspected the exploitation charge might be leveled, and he 
takes his time responding to it. "When you're putting yourself into 
shoes you haven't worn," he says, "you have to be very...just very 
thoughtful, is the way that I'd put it. Just thoughtful. You call on 
your craft, and you go searching for it, and hopefully what makes people
 listen is that over the years you've been serious and honest. That's 
where your creative authority comes from. That's how people know you're 
not just taking a ride."<br>
<br>
Listen to Farrelly on the subject: "Let me tell you, I have more CDs 
that people have sent me, just random people that wrote songs or 
whatever. I won't listen to them. But I trust that Bruce is sincere, 
that he really believes in what he wrote. I know the firemen are going 
to have a hard time with some of it, but then you sing along, and you 
just feel a little better. I trust him with all my heart. The only thing
 that bothered me is when he married Julianne."<br>
<br>
Springsteen claims he is a big believer in the old saw "Trust the art, 
not the artist." But Springsteen devotees love the songs and the singer 
equally, and by playing his fans' experiences back to them over stadium 
speakers, Springsteen has been an active partner in a pop syllogism: he 
sings about people like me; he looks and dresses like me; therefore he 
must be a person like me! Perhaps what Springsteen means, as some of his
 friends suggest, is that he feels less worthy than the people he sings 
about. Perhaps that's why touring, communing with those who adore him 
(and whom he adores) is such a critical part of Springsteen's life.<br>
<br>
In mid-July, Springsteen and the E Street Band were holed up in a small 
theater on the Fort Monmouth Army base, cramming for a 46-city tour that
 starts Aug. 7. During a break backstage, the band members were playing 
their consummate blue-collar roles. Guitarist "Little" Steven Van Zandt 
says he has to move out of his Eighth Avenue apartment in Manhattan 
after 20 years. "The place is fallin' apart." Drummer Max Weinberg 
suggests Steve check out a place in the legendary Upper West Side 
apartment building the Dakota; Van Zandt looks as if he has just been 
told to eat his pizza with a knife and fork. "Yeah, for $7 million? Very
 funny," he responds.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, at 52 Springsteen still looks as if he just strolled off the 
cover of Born in the U.S.A. As E Street Band member No. 9 in a black 
sleeveless undershirt and tan work pants, he moves across the stage like
 a camp counselor, all energy and encouragement as the group struggles 
to get the new songs down: "I know this stuff is hard. Don't worry; 
we'll get it, and it's gonna be fabulous! Now what we're gonna do this 
time..." During a break, Springsteen bounds out into the house seats. He
 thinks the pace of the band's learning curve is fine. He is happy to be
 playing with his old friends. But he is also not satisfied. "If I have a
 good trait, it's probably relentlessness," he says. "I'm a hound dog on
 the prowl. I can't be shook!"<br>
<br>
When not near a guitar, Springsteen tends to be quiet, serious and very 
still. With a Fender in his hands, he's a horse that can't wait to run. 
He loves playing music for anyone, anywhere, anytime. "Ultimately," he 
says, "it's not anything near a selfless experience. It's very 
self-fulfilling and revitalizing. I'm up there trying to fire myself up.
 When the metal hits the pedal--bang!--I got a destination that I am 
moving toward, and I'm not gonna be satisfied till I get there. For me."
 Of course, Springsteen's pleasure is famously infectious. Springsteen 
feeds off the crowd, which feeds off him in an endless cycle of stadium 
euphoria.<br>
<br>
When he is onstage, Springsteen says, he sometimes feels like a 
preacher, and on the last E Street Band tour, he did a mock monologue in
 a fire-and-brimstone voice about the power of music. "It was one of 
those things that was joking but serious at the same time," he says. 
Springsteen is a lapsed Catholic, but whether he is telling Scialfa that
 he wants her backup vocals to be "more gospel" or asking his listeners 
to "come on up for the rising," he understands that spiritual revival is
 a necessity and that it has to be a communal experience. "I think that 
fits in with the concept of our band as a group of witnesses," he says. 
"That's one of our functions. We're here to testify to what we have 
seen." And to hear the testimony of others.</div>

The Rock Laureate<br>
<br>
By JON PARELES<br>
AT 9 o’clock on a recent morning Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band
 were already half an hour into a rehearsal at the rock club Terminal 5 
in Manhattan. As N.F.L. executives and a television production team 
watched, they were tightening their miniset of four songs — dropping 
verses, streamlining segues — to fit their 12-minute slot as the 
halftime entertainment Sunday at Super Bowl XLIII, expected to reach 
tens of millions of viewers.<br>
<br>
“My take on the Super Bowl?” Mr. Springsteen said after rehearsal. “Fundamentally it’s a 12-minute party.”<br>
<br>
Few musicians anywhere consummate symbolic occasions and mass events 
better than Mr. Springsteen. He’s used to working on a stadium scale, 
and for decades his concerts have been nonstop singalongs that perfectly
 embody the yearning for community in his lyrics. In an era when pop 
hits can be as ephemeral as a deleted MP3 file, Mr. Springsteen has 
spent much of his career laboring to write durable songs about American 
dreams, from “Born to Run” to “Promised Land.”<br>
<br>
While his latest seven-album contract with Columbia Records is worth a 
reported $110 million, he still comes across as a working-class guy from
 New Jersey, invoking a compassionate populism as he sings about jobs, 
families and everyday life and savors the company of his longtime 
buddies in the E Street Band. He has the gravitas to lead off an 
inaugural concert and the gusto to rock the Super Bowl. In between he 
released a new studio album, “Working on a Dream.”<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen still reaches for big, symbolic statements and gets 
called on to make them. “Those moments are opportunities for a very 
heightened kind of communication,” he said.<br>
<br>
Two weeks ago, in another nationwide telecast, he took up his longtime 
role as a voice of America at “We Are One,” the all-star opening 
ceremony and concert for President Obama’s inauguration, before hundreds
 of thousands of people at the Lincoln Memorial and millions on 
television and online. Mr. Springsteen and a choir sang “The Rising,” a 
song about sacrifice and redemption on Sept. 11.<br>
<br>
At a New York City Obama fund-raiser in October that Mr. Springsteen 
attended, Mr. Obama said, “The reason I’m running for president is 
because I can’t be Bruce Springsteen.” Mr. Springsteen played “The 
Rising” at campaign events in battleground states, including a rally in 
Cleveland two days before the election.<br>
<br>
“Once you start doing that kind of writing, it feeds off itself,” Mr. 
Springsteen said. “You write ‘The Rising’ for this, it gets picked up 
and used for that, so you end up here. If someone had told me in 2001 
that ‘you’re going to sing this song at the inaugural concert for the 
first African-American president,’ I’d have said, ‘Huh?’ ” He laughed.<br>
<br>
“But eight years go by, and that’s where you find yourself. You’re in 
there, you’re swimming in the current of history and your music is doing
 the same thing.”<br>
<br>
He continued: “A lot of the core of our songs is the American idea: What
 is it? What does it mean? ‘Promised Land,’ ‘Badlands,’ I’ve seen people
 singing those songs back to me all over the world. I’d seen that 
country on a grass-roots level through the ’80s, since I was a teenager.
 And I met people who were always working toward the country being that 
kind of place. But on a national level it always seemed very far away.<br>
<br>
“And so on election night it showed its face, for maybe, probably, one 
of the first times in my adult life,” he said. “I sat there on the 
couch, and my jaw dropped, and I went, ‘Oh my God, it exists.’ Not just 
dreaming it. It exists, it’s there, and if this much of it is there, the
 rest of it’s there. Let’s go get that. Let’s go get it. Just that is 
enough to keep you going for the rest of your life. All the songs you 
wrote are a little truer today than they were a month or two ago.”<br>
<br>
Charles Coplin, vice president for programming at N.F.L. Television, 
said Mr. Springsteen had been “at the very top of our list” ever since 
the N.F.L. began programming its own halftime shows after the 2004 Janet
 Jackson brouhaha.<br>
<br>
“Why were we so persistent?” he said. “Because we felt that his music, 
and just as important his performance, was everything we were looking 
for. He has the ability to perform on a grand stage, to be 
improvisational, and he has a tremendous catalog of music that is 
appreciated by so many people.”<br>
<br>
Party or not, Mr. Springsteen has thought through his Super Bowl set 
meticulously. “It was very challenging to try and get that exact 12 
minutes. I found that in a funny way it was very freeing. O.K., these 
are your boundaries, so put everything that you have into just this 
box,” he said. “If you do it right, you should feel the tension of it 
wanting to spread beyond that time frame. But it can’t.”<br>
<br>
The Super Bowl performance follows the release of “Working on a Dream” 
on Tuesday, less than 14 months after “Magic” in 2007. Mr. Springsteen 
hasn’t made studio albums so quickly since he released both of his first
 two albums during 1973.<br>
<br>
Even more than “Magic,” the new album represents a sea change in Mr. 
Springsteen’s music. After the elaborate, tortured production of “Born 
to Run,” back in 1975, Mr. Springsteen went through a “reactive” phase 
that lasted more than two decades, building his songs on the basics of 
country, blues and folk music, with utilitarian melodies and 
straightforward, near-live production. He and the producer Brendan 
O’Brien, who first produced Mr. Springsteen with “The Rising” in 2002, 
brought some pop embellishments to “Magic.” And “Working on a Dream” 
follows through.<br>
<br>
Encouraged by Mr. O’Brien, Mr. Springsteen wrote five new songs during 
the week before he did the final mixes of “Magic,” he said. “I realized,
 I do love those big sweeping melodies and the romanticism, and I 
haven’t allowed myself much of it in the past,” Mr. Springsteen said. 
“When you have a little vein you haven’t touched, it’s full.”<br>
<br>
“Working on a Dream” often plays like a 1960s anthology: Creedence 
Clearwater Revival in the title song, the Beach Boys in “This Life,” the
 Byrds in “Life Itself,” Ben E. King in “Queen of the Supermarket,” 
psychedelic blues-rock in “Good Eye” and spaghetti-western soundtracks 
in the eight-minute “Outlaw Pete.” As lush as the music gets, few of the
 lyrics are fluff; Mr. Springsteen is pondering love and death. The 
celebratory affection of “My Lucky Day” gives way to songs that 
recognize the inexorable passage of time. In “Kingdom of Days,” he 
sings:<br>
<br>
With you I don’t hear the minutes ticking by<br>
<br>
I don’t feel the hours as they fly<br>
<br>
I don’t feel the summer as it wanes<br>
<br>
Just a subtle change of light upon your face.<br>
<br>
“Pop always brings with it the intimations of forever and immortality,” 
he said. “There was something so in tune with the universe in their 
math, and in the way that math was imbued with someone’s hopes, dreams, 
love, despair, immortal feelings, feelings of death coming around the 
corner, and then you try to put it all in three minutes. It was very 
exciting for me, being in this place of my life, to go back to those 
forms which are filled with that sense of forever and put finiteness in 
it.”<br>
<br>
At 59 Mr. Springsteen is indefatigable. His next American tour starts in
 April, followed by a summer of European dates. He still regularly plays
 vigorous three-hour sets. “Onstage I can’t noticeably say I feel any 
different than I did in 1985,” he said.<br>
<br>
The album ends with “The Wrestler,” the somber title track for the 
Mickey Rourke movie. It won a Golden Globe award for best song but, 
surprisingly, was not nominated for an Academy Award. The album also 
includes “The Last Carnival,” an elegy to the founding E Street Band 
keyboardist, Danny Federici, that Mr. Springsteen wrote for his funeral;
 Jason Federici plays his father’s accordion. “We’ll be riding the train
 without you tonight/The train that keeps on moving,” Mr. Springsteen 
sings.<br>
<br>
Yet most of the album strives for the elation of pop. “I wanted hooks, 
hooks, hooks — things for people to sing, and sound that was going to 
lift you up,” he said. “I wanted to capture the intensity and the 
immediacy of passionate love, and then its resonance in and beyond your 
life. And I wanted it to sound, like, classic: verse, huge chorus, 
sky-opening-up strings.”<br>
<br>
Steve Van Zandt, an E Street Band guitarist, said he was thrilled Mr. 
Springsteen’s newer songs evoke 1960s pop. “In the past he just ignored 
that part of his talent, and he’s the most talented pop songwriter,” he 
said. “In a different era he would have been in the Brill Building.”<br>
<br>
With a new album on the way Mr. Springsteen finally accepted the Super 
Bowl offer. “It was sort of, well, if we don’t do it now, what are we 
waiting for?” he said. “I want to do it while I’m alive.”<br>
<br>
There were other pragmatic considerations. “At my age it is tough to get
 word of your music out,” Mr. Springsteen said. He has the strange 
choice, he says, of performing at gigantic events like the Super Bowl or
 none. “If we weren’t doing these big things, there’s no middle things,”
 he said. Not that he’s doing too badly; even in a tottering recording 
business, “Magic” has sold a million copies, while his 2008 world tour 
grossed $204 million.<br>
<br>
He made another promotional deal he now bluntly calls a mistake. On Jan.
 13 a $10 collection of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band’s 
“Greatest Hits” — 11 songs from a 1995 hits anthology, as well as “Radio
 Nowhere” from “Magic” — went on sale exclusively at Wal-Mart. Since 
Wal-Mart has been accused of anti-union practices by Human Rights Watch,
 among others, and has paid large fines for violating labor laws, the 
announcement prompted online criticisms like the one from asroma on the 
fan site backstreets.com: “Bruce is doing biz with Wal-Mart? Kind of 
goes against everything he stands for.”<br>
<br>
In an interview with Billboard, Mr. Springsteen’s manager, Jon Landau, 
defended the release, saying Mr. Springsteen’s albums were already in 
Wal-Mart, which accounts for 15 percent of his sales. He also said: 
“We’re not doing any advertising for Wal-Mart. We haven’t endorsed 
Wal-Mart or anybody else. We’re letting Sony do its job.”<br>
<br>
But Mr. Springsteen said the decision was made too hastily. “We were in 
the middle of doing a lot of things, it kind of came down and, really, 
we didn’t vet it the way we usually do,” he said. “We just dropped the 
ball on it.” Instead of offering the exclusive collection to Wal-Mart, 
“given its labor history, it was something that if we’d thought about it
 a little longer, we’d have done something different.” He added, “It was
 a mistake. Our batting average is usually very good, but we missed that
 one. Fans will call you on that stuff, as it should be.”<br>
<br>
After more than three decades of shaping American archetypes, Mr. 
Springsteen sees his career as its own community in the making, shared 
and constructed with his listeners. “It’s not just my creation at this 
point, and it hasn’t been really for a long time,” he said. “I wanted it
 to be our creation. Once you set that in motion, it’s a large community
 of people gathered around a core set of values.<br>
<br>
“Within that there’s a wide range of beliefs, but still you do gather in
 one tent at a particular moment to have some common experience, and 
that’s why I go there too.”<br>
<br>
At rehearsal he strutted across the stage: testing banter, brandishing 
his guitar, belting lyrics and jiving with Mr. Van Zandt. As the band 
finished a run-through, someone holding a timer called out the length of
 the set. “We’ve got one-sixteenth of a second left,” Mr. Springsteen 
exulted. “And we plan to use it.”</div>

Elizabeth Wurtzel<br>
The Guardian, Sunday 22 June 2008<br>
<br>
When I was 12 years old, for my birthday my dad gave me an Ibanez 
six-string acoustic guitar, and my mom bought me guitar lessons at the 
local YMCA. In a short time, I knew a G7 from a C minor chord, I could 
pluck out an arpeggio and strum a syncopated rhythm. But it was plain 
enough: this was not where my talent lay. I would never grow up and be a
 rock star like my idol, Bruce Springsteen. But soon enough I had 
another plan: in Blinded By the Light, the whiplash of a lyrical Möbius 
strip that opened Bruce's debut album he makes mention of "some hazard 
from Harvard". This meant the Boss had heard of that university, which 
gave me a new goal: I would get good grades in high school and go to 
Harvard, so at least I would be at a college that Springsteen was aware 
of. That's how much I loved Bruce Springsteen. Anything I did was good 
enough, so long as I could at least peripherally link it to him.<br>
<br>
That is the personal history of this particular fan, and somewhere else 
there is someone labouring for the Johnstown Company because it was 
mentioned in The River, there is someone with a daughter named Wendy 
because she is the heroine of Born to Run, there is someone who works 
down at the carwash (where all it ever does is rain) because that's what
 the protagonist does in Downbound Train. There is also a girl who comes
 back whose name is Kitty, a girl who comes out tonight whose name is 
Rosalita, a girl whose dress waves whose name is Mary. And, hopefully, 
at the end of every hard-earned day, somewhere someone has found a 
reason to believe, like all the people do in, yes, Reason to Believe.<br>
<br>
My first encounter with Bruce Springsteen, at age 11, was at the 1978 No
 Nukes concert at Madison Square Garden, when Bruce debuted The River. 
He introduced this sombre song simply by saying: "This is new." The room
 got real quiet, and in it he told a terribly sad story of a young 
couple in love for whom everything just goes wrong: unwed pregnancy, 
shotgun marriage at 19, unemployment, a collapse in the economy, 
poverty, until finally both are just dead inside. But no matter how bad 
things are, the song's narrator and his girl can always take a break and
 go swimming in the river, the sweet sea of love, the refreshing well of
 life - throughout this misery, the chorus offers continual consolation 
in an otherwise continuously dismal dirge. But by the end of the song, 
even that's gone: the river has dried up. But the singer doesn't care: 
"Now those memories come back to haunt me / they haunt me like a curse /
 Is a dream a lie if it don't come true / Or is it something worse / 
that sends me down to the river / though I know the river is dry / That 
sends me down to the river tonight."<br>
<br>
There are many leitmotifs in Bruciana, and surely The River marks one of
 them: holding on for dear life, to hope against hope. Springsteen 
speaks to that piece of us that's more than slightly insane, the part 
that keeps going back to that empty river bank, searching for cool sweet
 water, like a miracle may happen. Bruce speaks to what is crazy enough 
in us all to still believe, and to know that belief is sometimes enough.
 That same deep mournfulness in The River is felt in the elatedness of 
Thunder Road, a song in which the good news is that "All the promises 
will be broken", but the narrator still promises Mary that "It's a town 
full of losers / And I'm pulling out of here to win." Vows and 
commitments tend to lead to loss in the long term of a Springsteen song,
 but the immediate fulfilment of joy is never a bad idea. In this 
regard, Bruce is, after all, a true rock'n'roller.<br>
<br>
But he is also really one of us, in all our dissatisfaction and dismay. 
The enlightened people in the world tell us that it's not having what 
you want; it's wanting what you've got. But the characters that roam 
through a Springsteen song are more like the rest of us: they are dirty.
 Like the guy in State Trooper, who chided us: "Maybe you've got a kid /
 maybe you've got a pretty wife /the only thing that I got's been 
both'rin' me my whole life." Now that's bleak, but no bleaker than the 
way it is for a lot of us. You can have a mountain of things or a 
mountain of debt and still have the icky feeling that it's all just a 
pain. And Bruce - who's looked at life from both sides - knows this only
 too well.<br>
<br>
Both sides is also a big Springsteen theme. No other songwriter has 
struggled more rewardingly, over so many years, with how difficult it is
 to be good when being bad is so much a part of you. Bruce's characters 
don't merely mess up: they travel across rivers, drive down lonesome 
highways, cross rusty old bridges to make a mistake that they know they 
are about to make, they push against the pull because "It's so hard to 
be a saint when you're just a boy out on the street." Asked to reason 
with the damage done, like murderer Charlie Starkweather after his 
killing spree through the city of Lincoln in the song Nebraska, they 
don't bother to make excuses: "Well sir I guess there's just a meanness 
in this world." Or they figure it's just in their blood, a disease of 
generations: "Daddy worked his whole life for nothing but the pain / Now
 he walks these empty rooms looking for something to blame / You inherit
 the sins, you inherit the flames / Adam raised a Cain."<br>
<br>
Never quite the genius of language that Bob Dylan is - no one is nor 
will anyone ever be - what Springsteen lacks in lyricism, he makes up 
for in communication: he is among us in a way that Dylan is forever 
separate. Bruce is always hoping his audience will get it; he's going 
for comprehensibility in all the places where Dylan might be looking for
 his own laughable obfuscation. That's the richness in all Springsteen 
lyrics: the narrator feels for everybody - the good and the bad, the 
ugly and the gorgeous - and most especially for the person out there who
 happens to be listening to, or reading, the words. Bruce Springsteen 
is, above all, a songwriter of the people, for the people, by the 
people.</div>

The Band on Bruce: Their Springsteen<br>
A candid look at the legend from his "greatest friends" - the E Street Band.<br>
<br>
DAVID FRICKE<br>
<br>
Posted Jan 21, 2009 </strong><br>
<br>
 The E Street Band are the people who know Bruce Springsteen best, and 
in his own words, "They are my greatest friendships, my deepest 
friendships — irreplaceable things." Springsteen started the band in 
1972, gave it its official name two years later and recorded some of his
 most iconic albums — Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town, The 
River, Born in the U.S.A. — with them in the 1970s and '80s. In 1989 he 
decided to venture on alone as a solo artist, breaking up the family for
 10 years he refers to now as "a lost period." In 1999 Springsteen 
reunited the group, and he says the second half of last year's 
acclaimed, energetic Magic tour was the band "at its best."<br>
David Fricke got close to Bruce Springsteen for his cover story in the 
new issue (on newsstands now). Here's an intimate look at the musicians 
who have played by his side for decades — The E Street band — in their 
own words. Guitarist Steven Van Zandt discusses how Springsteen's 
songwriting process has changed since the Darkness on the Edge of Town 
days. Drummer Max Weinberg opens up about taking the stage for his debut
 show with the E Street Band in 1974. Guitarist Nils Lofgren recalls the
 nervous moments before Springsteen's first big set at Neil Young's 1986
 Bridge School Benefit. And pianist Roy Bittan shares stories about 
Springsteen's special relationship with Danny Federici, and how the band
 reads Bruce's body language onstage.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Steven Van Zandt</strong><br>
<br>
When I first heard Working on a Dream it made me think of The River 
crossed with Exile on Main Street, with all of those guitars and the 
vocal harmonies shooting up in the mix. But on headphones, I could hear 
all of the little details too, in those guitars, the harmonies and the 
strings.<br>
I see these records [The Rising, Magic and Working on a Dream] as a 
trilogy. They make sense together in terms of sound, concept and writing
 style. The three records have been a projection more toward the 
pop-rock form — this one more than the other two.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Is Bruce loosening up? It's like he's going back to something he did a long time ago.</strong><br>
<br>
Very much so, I think. Every song on Tracks [Springsteen's 1998 box set 
of outtakes] was a lost argument — I'm not kidding. That is my own 
personal favorite style of writing. It was extremely frustrating for me 
to see him suppressing that side of his talent, which he is ridiculously
 gifted at. He was consciously squashing that.<br>
<br>
I'm a pop-rock-band guy. That's all I am. Intellectually, I understood 
what he was doing. I respected and supported it. But you're throwing 
away "Restless Nights?" [Laughs] "Loose Ends"? What's wrong with that? I
 think if you asked him about it now, he could see what I meant. But he 
wasn't wrong. He was doing it for a specific reason. He had his eye on 
history. He knew that in order to have a place in history, to be 
relevant in the truest sense of the word, you must find your own place.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">When did you first hear the songs on the new
 record, before you played on them? Bruce cut the rhythm tracks with 
that core four: him, Max, Garry and Roy. When do you come in?</strong><br>
<br>
It's a different world now, a different process. [Producer] Brendan 
O'Brien has become his partner, and by the time I get involved now, it's
 no longer in the early stages of arrangement and discussion. It's been 
arranged; the stuff is there. You play whatever they have in mind for 
you, and you add whatever you have as an idea. I think it's probably the
 way most normal bands record.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Does it still feel organic — like a band?</strong><br>
<br>
Yeah, it does. Because now he's self-editing. He's self-arranging with 
us in mind. It's like writers on a TV show. By the third or fourth year,
 you know the actors so well that you're writing for them. It's very 
seamless, effortless. and occasionally we cut something all together. We
 did that a couple of times for this album.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">How different was it on Darkness on the Edge of Town and The River?</strong><br>
<br>
It was, "I wrote a song last night. This is how it goes." I got an 
arranging credit on Darkness, because at that point, he wanted to start 
tightening things up from the epic nature of Born to Run. And that's up 
my alley. I'm Mr. Two-and-a-Half Minutes.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">How much of that tightening up was a running
 away from the sudden pop success of Born to Run, from the Time and 
Newsweek covers in 1975?</strong><br>
<br>
That was part of it. I'm not going to psychoanalyze it, but it was the 
easiest way to gain control of one's own destiny, one's own career, in a
 funny way — to not be too successful. He knew that we had an advantage 
over almost everybody live, because we came from that old school: Our 
job was to make people dance. And if we didn't make people dance, you 
were fired. You didn't pay the rent. In the early days, we had an 
apartment together down in Asbury Park. There was no mommy and daddy 
paying the rent. We had to do the right thing — and that meant making 
people dance, just like the Stones did, just like the Beatles. That 
creates an energy — there is no substitute for it. By the time we broke 
through, forget it — that energy was unstoppable.<br>
I think perhaps Bruce felt, there's always that: "You can do whatever 
you want, Mr. Music Industry, Mr. Journalist, Mr. Cover-of-Time. We've 
got something that's mine. We can play live. The records — whatever, 
we'll get around to it."<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">There is a sense in the new, rapid 
turnaround ¬— two E Street albums in just over a year, all of the 
touring — of time running out, especially with Danny's passing.</strong><br>
<br>
That keeps the energy going until it does run out, rather than waiting 
'til it does. What you're getting at, though, is something we will have 
to face: Which is, at what point is it still the band? How many people 
can be replaced? That remains to be seen. And we'll see what that means,
 in terms of the communication. Because the communication, the 
friendship, is where it all begins. That's what makes a band. That's why
 bands are different than individuals. They communicate something 
different, by their nature. You are not just communicating music. You 
are communicating friendship, brotherhood, sisterhood and ultimately 
your community. It doesn't matter if there's one guy who's a leader. 
It's a band. You are communicating community, and an individual cannot 
do that. The way to do is to be. And as long as you are there being, 
then nothing needs to be said.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">How much rehearsal time do you need for a tour now?</strong><br>
<br>
There is no getting ready, no advance preparation. We are ready at any 
moment to do anything. We rehearsed three days for the last tour. 
[Laughs] I mean, that stuff's all done. It's just "Let's go."<br>
<br>
This time, we'll rehearse to learn some of the new songs. We don't even 
learn the old songs we haven't played for awhile. There are at least 
four or five guys in the band that know them. And the rest of us pick it
 up.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Max Weinberg</strong><br>
<br>
Producer Brendan O'Brien said that for The Rising, Magic and the new 
album, most of the rhythm tracks were cut live by a core four — 
yourself, Bruce, Garry Tallent and Roy Bittan. That's like a band inside
 a band.<br>
Rhythm sections typically are. The basic tracks for Born to Run were 
bass, drums, piano and vocal. But because we've played together for so 
long, the four of us play like a four-piece power group. Any of those 
basic tracks on the [new] record — they sound like a record, like you 
could release them just like that. My son, Jay, who is a drummer, came 
to the session in New York where we did "Kingdom of Days." He was in the
 control room. He was amazed at how it sounded like a record as we were 
playing it. The thousands and thousands of hours we played in live 
concerts and studio work — it all comes out now. We get a lot of results
 very quickly.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">How much did you see Bruce live before you joined the band?</strong><br>
<br>
I never saw Bruce and the E Street Band before I joined them. I went to 
Seton Hall University, played in a pickup band there — the singer wrote 
all the songs. He was from the Jersey Shore. He somehow he got a job to 
open for Bruce and the E Sreet Band at Seton Hall in April of '74. So I 
played the opening set. But before that, I felt myself getting sick, so I
 left immediately after. I never saw Bruce.<br>
<br>
The only thing I knew about Bruce when I saw the [musicians wanted] ad 
in the Village Voice was it said he was on Columbia Records. That 
indicated he was doing better than me. I remember at my audition Bruce 
asked me if I knew any of his songs. I knew "Sandy" ["4th of July, 
Asbury Park (Sandy)"]. My guy covered that song. I knew it the way he 
played it. I'd never heard the record. But I'm a good mimic. I'm good at
 following people and improvising.<br>
<br>
The first time I played with the E Street Band, it was me, Bruce, 
Clarence [Clemons], Danny [Federici] and Garry. I had never played with a
 group where everybody was focused on one individual. Every group I'd 
ever played in was fairly chaotic. Here, there was no doubt where the 
inspiration is coming from. I'll never forget it. It was the third week 
of August, 1974. And there was no piano player at that point. It was on a
 Monday. I came back a week later, and Roy was in the band.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Does playing with the band feel different to
 you now? There have been changes, additions and losses — Danny's gone 
now — and there was that long break in the Nineties.<br>
</strong><br>
I'm sure it was different when Roy and I joined. It was the E Street 
Band before me, with [Ernest] "Boom" Carter and Vini Lopez [on drums]. 
But when a band has been together this long, you expect to see the same 
people. It takes on an iconic visage. This is the core of the people who
 have been with Bruce all of these years.<br>
We learned basically through listening. There was a lot of that in the 
early days. We had this bus — literally a school bus — and we would sit 
around and listen to the music that we liked, and what Bruce liked. And 
we talked about what was good about it and what he didn't like about it.<br>
<br>
It could be a little thing. In the middle of "The Wanderer" by Dion, 
there is a drum part by Panama Francis, a brilliant drum part, one of 
the classics. He plays it on the snare drum. Then in the sax solo, he 
goes to the cymbal. Bruce got such a kick out of it. Then when Dion goes
 back to the vocal, you hear the cymbals just shut down [makes a "zip" 
sound], and Francis goes back to the snare beat. It was those little 
details that Bruce would point out to me, what he thought was brilliance
 in drumming.<br>
<br>
There was another thing, in another Dion song, "Love Came to Me" [1962].
 At one moment, one of the background singers goes "Hey, hey!" It's real
 quiet — you can barely hear it. But to Bruce, that was a perfect 
moment. In the early days, we always used to talk about these perfect 
little moments.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Nils Lofgren</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">You joined the E Street Band in 1984, after 
it had been going for a decade. How often did you see Bruce and the band
 before you became a member?</strong><br>
<br>
I'm a big fan. I used to buy a ticket and see the band in the '70s and 
early '80s. When I hit the road in 1968 with my band Grin, we were on 
kind of the same circuit. Actually, we both did an audition night at 
Bill Graham's Fillmore West in 1970. He was with Steel Mill. We happened
 to get the same night. The first time I saw the E Street Band was in 
1975. My first solo album came out, and I was playing my first show at 
the Bottom Line [in New York] as a solo artist. I got into New York a 
night early to see the last night of the famous stand at the club by 
Bruce and the E Street Band. Obviously, between 1970 and Steel Mill and 
1975 and the E Street Band, it was a huge growth. I was really inspired 
by it.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What impressed you the most?</strong><br>
<br>
You take the material and the intensity of the leader, then you mix it 
with everyone on board. You get everyone as focused as you, on the 
intent of the music, the rest is how you navigate it. Bruce is a master 
at that. It goes beyond doing it well. It becomes a calling. When you 
mix the love of performing and leading a band with a catalog of songs 
you can call on, if you keep everyone around you focused with the same 
commitment for three hours, it's a formidable thing. He had that early 
on.<br>
<br>
Take this last tour, which I think was our best. It went from our normal
 audible signals to him grabbing 20 or 30 request signs from the 
audience. The last three months, the set list was useless. It surprised 
all of us — even Bruce, because I don't think it was that premeditated. 
It grew into a completely improvised show, but still with the intent of 
having it grow and explode into this finality of emotion, something 
Bruce insists on.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
When you joined in '84, did Bruce give you an idea of what he was looking for? How verbal was he in what he wanted from you?</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce knew I was a bandleader. He'd seen me play. We had a very open 
dialogue about his specific needs. The one problem was, I got the job 
four weeks before opening night [of the Born in the U.S.A. tour]. He was
 a bachelor at the time, and I moved into his house in Rumson [New 
Jersey]. We'd get up, have a light breakfast, then we'd jog five miles, 
real easy, through Rumson. Then I'd go up to this little rehearsal room 
and isolate myself. He gave me a big list of songs to start with, in 
addition to the new Born in the U.S.A. album, and I had a giant notebook
 with these different sections: music, instruments, harmony singing, 
where do I stand. He was always available if I had questions. He'd walk 
in every once in awhile, give me pointers.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">For example?</strong><br>
<br>
"Here's a harmony you're singing on this song. But you know what? At 
these two or three points, why don't you come over to my mike and sing 
them with me center stage?" Or "Here's a song I was thinking of playing 
guitar on, but I don't want to play guitar. Forget that part you were 
learning, play mine, and bleed in some of that second part."<br>
Bruce played this great rhythm guitar in "Girls in Their Summer Clothes"
 on most of the last tour. Then out of the blue, for the last two 
months, he says, "I don't want to play guitar on this anymore." So I 
stopped playing my pedal steel part from the record. Bruce said, "Leave 
that alone and take over my guitar part." He wanted to prowl the front 
of the stage. He's not only an instrumentalist and the singer. He's 
gotta navigate the harmony singing and the stage presence.<br>
<br>
My impression is he thinks as big as possible. Then when he get there, 
he goes, "Can I top that?" I remember when me and Danny [Federici] and 
Bruce did the Bridge School benefit for Neil [Young] in 1986. It was 
Bruce's first, big acoustic show. We rehearsed in New York — he was 
feeling a bit nervous, to do something on such a large scale. We had a 
little show planned, and sure enough, at the last minute, just before we
 started with our three-piece acoustic set, Bruce said, "I'm gonna just 
go out and do something by myself. Then you guys come out." That was the
 wheels turning. As nervous as he might have been, instead of starting 
with one of the numbers we had down, he goes out and does "You Can Look 
(But You Better Not Touch)" [from The River] a cappella, snapping his 
fingers on the mike. Despite his apprehension of the unknown, he 
challenged himself, and found a way to completely put himself on the 
spot, in the hardest way possible.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Roy Bittan</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce now records basic tracks for the E Street albums with a core four —
 himself, you, Max Weinberg and Garry Talent. How does the music feel 
when you record that way, compared to E Street sessions in the Seventies
 and Eighties?<br>
Some history first: when we recorded Born to Run, we cut the basic 
tracks with piano, bass, drums and Bruce. So this is not the first time 
we have relied on that process, of cutting a basic track and then 
overdubbing. We strayed from that as we progressed. Darkness on the Edge
 of Town was cut pretty much with everybody playing.<br>
<br>
Today, Bruce has a more specific idea of in his head of what he wants 
the songs to sound like. It works very efficiently for us to cut a basic
 track. That gives him all the freedom in the world to add guitar, more 
guitars, background vocals, strings and anything else that behooves him.<br>
<br>
His first allegiance, at this point, is to his songwriting. We do 
whatever we want to interpret the song when we cut the basics. He does 
rely on us for that. But as far as sweetening the tracks, he's 
interested in trying to eke out the song's potential that he hears in 
his head. Which is evident on this new record. It's almost a little 
shocking to hear the songs at first, because the album is different than
 our classic E Street records, which were recorded mostly live.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Are there examples of things you played on 
the basic tracks of the new album, a little improvisation, that stayed 
in the arrangements?</strong><br>
<br>
"Working on a Dream" — there's a spot in the chorus when he sings 
"Working on a dream," a little space immediately after that where I go 
down to the bottom of the piano and do a double hit on the real low end.
 It seemed to work itself into the final arrangement, almost as a tiny 
hook.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What do you look for when Bruce is 
improvising on stage? Are there signals or gestures he makes when he's 
about to change gears in a song?</strong><br>
<br>
The connective architecture of my parts means I often have to play a 
phrase going into a new section, a phrase that musically pulls us to the
 next bridge or the chorus. I have to watch and make sure he's going 
there [laughs]. It can be extremely subtle. You have to read the river. 
If he's down at the end of the stage, not near the microphone, and you 
know a new verse is coming up, he may need a couple of measures to get 
back. Or he may want to go around one more time before he gets back 
there.<br>
<br>
I watch everything. I listen to him. I watch his body English — and 
certainly watch his arms. He may point to something, and that means 
we're changing.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
As the other keyboard player in the group, how would you describe Danny 
Federici's role in the E Street Band? What kind of hole did he leave in 
the music when he died last year? Steven Van Zandt said Danny couldn't 
tell you the chords to "Born to Run" but always played the right notes.</strong><br>
<br>
What Steven said was an exaggeration but not far from the truth 
[laughs]. Danny would play what he felt. If you asked him in the studio,
 "Could you play that part again?", I don't know if it would come out 
exactly the same. If you asked him to replicate something, he would 
shrug and say, "I'll play it again. I don't know if I can do it the same
 way." That was the beauty of Danny for me, as the other keyboard player
 in the group.<br>
<br>
Often there is only room for one keyboard player in a group. One of the 
things that made it work was that Danny was an extremely different 
player than me. I was more architectural, more about the song form. 
Danny would just play around — play around me and everybody else. He was
 like the wind. He would blow in and around everybody else. He was glue,
 he was excitement. Unfortunately, you don't truly appreciate things 
until they're gone. We appreciated him, but I think a lot of people 
didn't realize exactly what he did in the band until it wasn't there. We
 were always more than the sum of our parts. But when you take one of 
those parts out, the machine is not working in quite the same way.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce always nicknames band members with a 
purpose. Danny was Dangerous Dan. Clarence Clemons is the Big Man. How 
did you become the Professor?</strong><br>
<br>
I think it was because I seemed to have a plausible answer for any 
question that came up, whether it was true or not. [Laughs] I was the 
answer man.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Not just musically?</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce once called me to the back of the bus and said, "Professor, what 
exactly is E=MC2?" I said. "Well, it's energy equals mass times the 
speed of light squared, which is 186,000 miles per second." And he said,
 "Uh, okay."</div>
