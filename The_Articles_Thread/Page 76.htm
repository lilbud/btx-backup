<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen delivers historic marathon at the Key<br>
<br>
By Charles R. Cross <br>
Special to The Seattle Times<br>
March 25, 2016</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band made their first Seattle 
appearance since 2008 on Thursday (March 24) at KeyArena with a 
marathon, 35-song concert. The show ran for nearly four hours — 
Springsteen’s longest ever in our city — and included Pearl Jam’s Eddie 
Vedder. <br>
<br>
The night opened with “Meet Me In the City,” an outtake from “The 
River.” Springsteen and the E Streeters then played that 1980-era album 
in its entirety. Springsteen said “The River,” his fifth album, 
represented a move away from “the young men’s records” that preceded it.
 <br>
<br>
That duality was never more clear than with the next two numbers: “The 
Ties That Bind,” with its adult-world problems, followed by the youthful
 party-rocker “Sherry Darling.” That contrast — which was tortured in a 
way, but consequentially powerful — would continue all night. <br>
<br>
The “River” songs were faithful to the album, and Springsteen talked 
only briefly, explaining that “Independence Day” was about “adult 
compromises.” At 66, and a father of three, Springsteen understands that
 in a way he didn’t when he wrote the song. <br>
<br>
The E Street Band was spot-on all night. Particularly strong were “The 
Price You Pay” and “Stolen Car,” which displayed the band’s capacity to 
play with quiet shading.<br>
<br>
“The River” is an album that switches between moody ballads and 
rave-ups, but the whole evening was kind of a thematic monster of a 
show, mixing one big album with other hits. The first two hours were 
“The River,” but once that was done, 14 hits followed. It was an 
“encore” of sorts that was longer than many entire concerts.<br>
<br>
Many younger fans, perhaps seeing Springsteen for the first time, 
probably thought the show actually took off when chestnuts like “Born to
 Run” followed. But Springsteen’s focus was stronger on the lesser-known
 “River” songs, perhaps because he felt he needed to sell those more. <br>
<br>
The rest of the set was also spirited, notably “Badlands” and “Adam 
Raised a Cain.” When Eddie Vedder came onstage for “Bobby Jean,” to wild
 applause, Springsteen joked, “I get booed in my hometown.”<br>
<br>
Yet the night’s musical highlight came earlier, with “Stolen Car,” from 
“The River.” The song, while never a hit, encapsulated the concert’s 
themes of escape and fatalism. <br>
<br>
“I travel in fear, that in this darkness I will disappear,” sang the rocker. <br>
<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s place in rock history was cemented long before Thursday’s 
concert, but with a performance lasting just under four hours, this one 
will go down in the history books. It was not only his longest Seattle 
show, but his best here in years.<br>
<br>
He gave the impression he didn’t want the night to stop. At the end of 
the “River” set he talked about mortality and a feeling of “the clock 
ticking.”<br>
<br>
“You walk alongside of your own mortality to do your work,” he said, “to raise your family, and to try to do something good.” <br>
<br>
To emphasize his point, he repeated that final line one more time — “to do something good.” <br>
<br>
By the end of the night, there was no doubt Bruce Springsteen had achieved that.</div>

Review: Springsteen turns back time, makes The River flow in Dallas<br>
<br>
 DALLAS STAR TELEGRAM</strong><br>
<br>
Time, like water in a river, forever moves forward.<br>
However much we might like to stop, to pause and look back, the current 
bears us along, making returning to what came before nothing if not a 
struggle.<br>
It takes determination to wade back upstream, fighting against the 
surging inevitability of nature — a feat that, metaphorically at least, 
is all but impossible.<br>
Yet there, on Tuesday, before a sold out American Airlines Center crowd,
 stood Bruce Springsteen and the reliable, durable, electrifying E 
Street Band, doing exactly that: turning back time, and revisiting the 
landmark 1980 double album, The River, in full.<br>
“The River was my coming-of-age record,” Springsteen explained at the 
outset of what would be an astonishing three-and-a-half hour marathon of
 a performance. “All the records before were young man’s records. ... 
I’d taken notice of the things that bind people to their lives. It was 
on The River that I wanted to make a record that was big and felt like 
life. I wanted it to contain fun and dancing and laughter and sex and 
love and heartbreak and, of course, teardrops ... if I could make a 
record big enough to hold those things, I could get closer to them.<br>
<br>
“Let’s go back down to The River.”<br>
<br>
Standing there, on the banks of one of his greatest works, Springsteen 
is an older, wiser and more bruised soul than he was 36 years ago.<br>
Nevertheless, there were several moments where flashes of the youthful 
Springsteen were visible — crowd-surfing during Hungry Heart; venturing 
into the adoring audience multiple times, clasping hands, signing 
posters and grinning; inviting a mob of selfie-obsessed young women 
onstage during Dancing in the Dark — and the exuberance with which the E
 Street Band plays staples like Ramrod, Cadillac Ranch and Sherry 
Darling was positively infectious.<br>
<br>
But in a record capable of containing life, there must be shadows, and 
those too were given equal time Tuesday. The snarling Jackson Cage 
contrasted nicely with the solemn Wreck on the Highway and the seething 
Independence Day, of which Springsteen said, “It’s the kind of song you 
write when you’re young and you’re startled by your parents’ humanity.”<br>
<br>
The whole of The River is rich with such realizations, and its songs are
 haunted by youth, time and mortality — mistakes made; chances taken; 
risks accepted.<br>
The twilight zone between childhood and adulthood is fraught with 
uncertainty, and the best moments on The River, as full and striking an 
artistic statement as Springsteen had made to that point in his career, 
capture the feeling of being on a tightrope between what is desired and 
what is necessary.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Of the many records in his catalog to revisit in full, it makes sense 
for Springsteen to choose The River, if only because in hearing him 
speak about his mindset at the time, it’s clear that this moment is when
 he began moving past rowdy all-nighters at the Stone Pony, taking 
himself and his work much more seriously.<br>
As he moves into the autumn of his career, Springsteen the icon is 
reconnecting with that first blush of consequence, the point where 
everything changed.<br>
The moment where the ever-flowing stream rounded a corner, and he could see everything.<br>
<br>
“The River was about time,” Springsteen said, as the E Street Band 
vamped behind him. “It was about time slipping away. ... You choose your
 partner, you choose your work, and the clock starts ticking. You walk 
along your own mortality, and you understand you have a limited amount 
of time to do your work, raise your family, and try and do something 
good.”<br>
<br>
Most artists of Springsteen’s age and stature would call a two-hour 
rendition of a seminal recording a full evening’s work, but it was 
merely prelude to another 90 minutes of music, visiting other corners of
 the catalog for favorites like Badlands, The Promised Land, Because the
 Night, Thunder Road, Born to Run, Rosalita (Come Out Tonight) and Tenth
 Avenue Freeze-Out.<br>
<br>
Springsteen had spoken at one point, earlier in the evening, about “love
 without consequences [and] love without responsibility,” and at its 
best, Tuesday’s remarkable, visceral performance felt like a 
manifestation of that sentiment.<br>
It was a pure, uncomplicated exchange of affection between performer and
 audience, eagerly straining to reach out and connect — on both sides of
 the stage — the ceaseless, eternal current, sweeping all of us forward,
 headlong into the great unknown.</div>

Epic stand once again reiterates who’s the boss<br>
<br>
AUSTIN STAR CHRONICLE<br>
BY RAOUL HERNANDEZ, <br>
 APR. 6, 2016</strong><br>
<br>
At the 3:20 mark – hours, not minutes – Bruce Springsteen could only 
repeat, “I got nothing.” Some 20,000 fanatics at the American Airlines 
Arena in Dallas on Tuesday knew better, even if the E Street Band looked
 ready for a post-concert cocktail. A somewhat anti-climactic “Bobby 
Jean” served as canny come down from three-plus hours at dizzying 
heights.<br>
<br>
Sole Texas date in promotion of December’s Ties That Bind: The River 
Collection, a 4-CD/3-DVD breakout of the Jersey icon’s 1980 double 
album, the show’s second half had been a spectacle all its own after a 
two-hour rendering of The River. Like his last tour’s only Lone Star 
stopover in Houston, last night’s epic stand tried to appease the entire
 state in one set-list. Mission accomplished.<br>
<br>
Twenty unabashed rockers with intermittent interludes and codas of 
self-reflect, The River clocks in on wax at under 90 minutes, but live, 
its author – 66 – not only fleshed out its “coming-of-age” elan, he made
 a case for his classic albums carrying any single performance on their 
own. Opening with box set b-side “Meet Me in the City,” Springsteen and 
his Sopranos-kissed crew – Steven Van Zandt, Max Weinberg, Garry 
Tallent, Roy Bittan, Nils Lofgren, Jake Clemons, and Soozie Tyrell – 
took their time accenting almost every LP track with a unique bit of 
musical theater, while wasting zero time “Ramrod”-ing through the album 
end to end. Stand up, sit down, strap in for the ride of your life.<br>
<br>
Album firestarter “The Ties That Bind” stepped forward with its 
murderer’s row frontline (Springsteen, Van Zandt, Lofgren, Tallent, and 
Tyrell) all at their mics singing and strumming. “Two Hearts” reiterated
 that while Rage Against the Machine’s Tom Morello proved a perfect 
acolyte last tour, there’s no substitute for Van Zandt at the mic with 
his lifelong boss and blood brother, yowling harmonies and crooning a 
snippet of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell’s “It Takes Two” in unison with
 Springsteen to finish off the song’s coronary pop. Chart breakthrough 
“Hungry Heart” beat pulpy nostalgia as the bandleader crowd surfed from 
the GA floor barricade to the stage.<br>
<br>
So followed the moments of giddy album chemistry: autonomy anthem “Out 
in the Street” pulling up throwaway “Crush On You” as a knockout tandem 
encored by the freight train heart of “You Can Look (But You Better Not 
Touch)”; a long, heavy-breathing intro to “I Wanna Marry You,” which was
 then followed by Springsteen’s doomy harp and Van Zandt’s acoustic lean
 on the stark title track; and Bittan’s extended piano intro to “Point 
Blank,” which recreated its treatment on the album’s original tour.<br>
<br>
“Cadillac Ranch” roared with all three guitarists trading solos, and 
Clemons filling his late uncle Clarence’s size 27 footwear at the lip of
 the stage blowing one radiator sax solo after another. Van Zandt’s 
sweet and sour shading tarted up the elegiac “Fade Away” in advance of 
brooding LP mate “Stolen Car.” And then, of course, Springsteen himself,
 indefatigable in vocal exhortation, croon, and arena levitation. No 
other artist save for the Rolling Stones transforms nearly every live 
selection into a rock &amp; roll call to arms.<br>
<br>
What might have then satisfied along the lines of a few choice cuts and 
an extended encore turned into almost 90 minutes of non-stop feet and 
fist movers: “Badlands,” “Promised Land,” “Back Streets,” “The Rising,” 
“Thunder Road,” “Born to Run,” “Rosalita (Won’t You Come Out Tonight),” 
and Isley Brothers’ worship stomp “Shout.” Lofgren’s molten solo during 
“Because the Night” stopped both Springsteen and Van Zandt in their 
tracks, while 50 teen and preteen girls in Born in the U.S.A. red 
bandanas absolutely mobbed the singer onstage during “Dancing in the 
Dark.”<br>
<br>
“Oh my fucking god,” exclaimed Springtseen when they were escorted 
offstage, unable to stop laughing or grinning. “That was the wildest 
fucking show I’ve ever been to.”<br>
<br>
God‘s honest truth, that.</div>

WASHINGTON POST<br>
<br>
By Mark Berman<br>
 April 8</strong><br>
<br>
The backlash against North Carolina’s law banning anti-discrimination 
ordinances kept going unabated Friday, as Bruce Springsteen announced 
that he was canceling a weekend show in the state in solidarity with 
those protesting the bill.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and the E Street Band were scheduled to perform at the 
Greensboro Coliseum on Sunday night as part of their current tour, which
 continues in the United States this month and heads to Europe in May.<br>
<br>
On Friday afternoon, Springsteen released a statement saying that he could no longer play the show.<br>
<br>
“I feel that this is a time for me and the band to show solidarity for 
those freedom fighters,” Springsteen said in the message posted on his 
website. “As a result, and with deepest apologies to our dedicated fans 
in Greensboro, we have canceled our show scheduled for Sunday, April 
10th.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s stance comes as a host of major businesses and 
organizations have criticized North Carolina’s law, which prohibits 
transgender people from using bathrooms that don’t match the gender they
 were assigned at birth. This legislation also bans local governments 
from extending civil rights protections to gay and transgender people.<br>
<br>
Earlier this week, PayPal announced that it would no longer open a 
facility in Charlotte due to the law. State officials had said PayPal’s 
facility would have pumped millions into the local economy by next year 
and employed 400 people.<br>
<br>
Battles are erupting nationwide over gay rights and other social issues,
 fights that have repeatedly seen big business groups and entertainment 
figures square off with social conservatives.<br>
<br>
Springsteen said Friday that North Carolina’s law was an “attempt by 
people who cannot stand the progress our country has made in recognizing
 the human rights of all of our citizens to overturn that progress,” and
 praised the people fighting the legislation.<br>
<br>
“Some things are more important than a rock show and this fight against 
prejudice and bigotry — which is happening as I write — is one of them,”
 Springsteen said. “It is the strongest means I have for raising my 
voice in opposition to those who continue to push us backwards instead 
of forwards.”<br>
<br>
People who bought tickets would get refunds, Springsteen said.<br>
<br>
The North Carolina law was hastily introduced last month by state 
lawmakers as a way to override a civil rights ordinance passed in 
Charlotte to allow transgender people in that city to use bathrooms 
corresponding with their gender identity. Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed 
the state measure, praising it as needed “to stop this breach of basic 
privacy and etiquette” in Charlotte.<br>
<br>
This law has come under considerable criticism from LGBT rights groups 
and a wide array of companies, including including Apple, Google and 
American Airlines. It could also cost the state other economic 
opportunities in the future. The NBA suggested it was considering moving
 its next All-Star game — scheduled to take place in Charlotte in 2017 —
 because of the law.<br>
<br>
Supporters of the legislation have defended it and similar bills as 
common sense measures and have criticized the people unhappy with the 
law. The Rev. Franklin Graham, an evangelist in North Carolina, decried 
PayPal as hypocritical earlier this week and wrote on Facebook that 
lawmakers supporting the legislation should “stand strong against the 
attacks of this wicked agenda.”<br>
<br>
A day before Springsteen’s announcement, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley
 (R) said she did not believe such a law would be necessary in her 
state. Also this week, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant (R) signed a law 
that would let businesses refuse service to gay couples based on 
religious objections, ignoring opposition from businesses and 
organizations in his state.</div>

Bravo, Bruce: Springsteen’s Stand Against North Carolina Law<br>
<br>
By ANDREW ROSENTHAL  <br>
APRIL 8, 2016</strong><br>
<br>
When the forces of intolerance and bigotry prevail, as they have lately 
in Southern states that passed laws institutionalizing discrimination 
against gay and transgender Americans, it can be tempting to think they 
are impervious to argument. There is, however, one thing that lawmakers 
like those in North Carolina do heed – money.<br>
<br>
After North Carolina passed a law last month perpetuating discrimination
 against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, PayPal canceled 
its plans to build a large presence in that state, costing North 
Carolina 400 jobs at the planned office and countless dollars.<br>
<br>
Today, Bruce Springsteen, a champion of social justice in his public and
 personal life, announced that he was canceling a scheduled concert in 
Greensboro, N.C., on Sunday and will refund tickets.<br>
<br>
“North Carolina has just passed HB2, which the media are referring to as
 the ‘bathroom’ law,” he said in a statement. The law, he explained, 
“dictates which bathrooms transgender people are permitted to use. Just 
as important, the law also attacks the rights of LGBT citizens to sue 
when their human rights are violated in the workplace. No other group of
 North Carolinians faces such a burden.”<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen said the law was “an attempt by people who cannot stand 
the progress our country has made in recognizing the human rights of all
 of our citizens to overturn that progress.” He noted that some people 
and groups in North Carolina were fighting to have the law repealed. 
“This is a time for me and the band to show solidarity for those freedom
 fighters,” Mr. Springsteen said, adding: “Some things are more 
important than a rock show.”<br>
<br>
He said that this was “the strongest means I have for raising my voice 
in opposition to those who continue to push us backwards instead of 
forwards.”<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band deserve a huge round of 
applause, as does Charles Barkley, the basketball great, who has urged 
the National Basketball Association to move its All-Star Game next year 
away from Charlotte, N.C., unless the law is repealed. The N.B.A. should
 do that without hesitation.<br>
<br>
Remember, the NCAA’s president, Mark Emmert, said he would move the 
collegiate sports association’s events out of Indiana unless it deleted a
 similar law, and other business organizations actually did cancel 
events in Indiana. The law, which was signed by Gov. Mike Pence with 
great fanfare, was later “fixed” in a foolish and ineffective way, but 
should simply have been repealed.<br>
<br>
In South Carolina, the intervention by big companies like BMW and 
Bridgestone Tire helped force the hands of racists in the state 
government who had resisted removing the Confederate battle flag from 
the grounds of the state Capitol.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen is taking to heart the adage that all it takes for evil 
to prevail is for good people to remain silent. What are others who do 
business in and with North Carolina waiting for?</div>

MOLLY SAUTER<br>
The Globe and Mail<br>
Apr. 12, 2016 </strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Molly Sauter is a PhD candidate at McGill University, and the author of 
The Coming Swarm: DDOS Actions, Hacktivism, and Civil Disobedience on 
the Internet.<br>
<br>
What do Disney, Bryan Adams, the National Football League, Salesforce, 
AMC, American Airlines and Bruce Springsteen have in common? They have 
all threatened to pull their business out of U.S. states that passed or 
proposed legislation that attacks the civil rights of lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender individuals.<br>
<br>
These bills, claiming to protect “religious liberty” or “privacy,” are 
widely considered to be attempts to roll back social progress, stripping
 LGBT individuals of basic protections.<br>
<br>
We’re used to citizen-led boycotts, but these corporate boycotts seem 
new. Corporations have long used their economic power to influence law. 
The innovation here is the use of that power for social justice, rather 
than for tax breaks.<br>
<br>
But is this democratic? While citizen-led boycotts are a respected form 
of social activism in the United States dating to before the 
civil-rights movement, these corporate-led boycotts have a whiff of 
economic coercion, and are a symptom of America’s pervasive power 
imbalance when it comes to big corporate money versus democracy. 
Unelected corporations, accountable only to their shareholders, should 
not be able to determine whether laws stand or fall. An oligarch is an 
oligarch, even when he’s on your side.<br>
<br>
Religious freedom acts, passed or proposed in more than half of the 
United States, have become the favoured tool of the conservative right, 
legislating a conservative Christian backlash to civil-rights 
protections for LGBT individuals and women under the guise of protecting
 “sincere religious expression.”<br>
<br>
RFRAs aren’t the only bills that attracted threats of corporate boycotts
 recently. After the passage of a “bathroom bill” in North Carolina, 
which requires trans individuals using public facilities to use the 
washroom corresponding to the gender they were assigned at birth, 
regardless of the gender they identify as, corporations such as Apple, 
Salesforce and Wells Fargo called the bill discriminatory. A spokesman 
for American Airlines, which employs 14,000 North Carolinians, was 
quoted in The Washington Post calling bills like it “bad for the 
economies of the states in which they are enacted.” Bruce Springsteen 
cancelled his concert there. Paypal abandoned a planned office that 
would have employed 400 people.<br>
<br>
Why are corporations and celebrities suddenly so concerned with social 
justice? It might just be good business. As Salesforce chief excutive 
officer Marc Benioff explained in Time magazine, “We’re a company of 
20,000 employees. We obviously have thousands of LGBT employees as 
well.” It might be consumer-driven optics. It might be social media 
gold. It may even be a genuine belief in the civil rights of LGBT 
individuals: These corporations are willing to take money and jobs out 
of states that pass bigoted legislation in an attempt to force 
legislative change. These are often poorer states, which can ill afford 
to lose corporate business. North Carolina is ranked 39th in median 
income in the United States. Mississippi, where Bryan Adams recently 
cancelled a concert in protest against that state’s RFRA, is dead last.<br>
<br>
While a kick to the coffers may be the fastest way to make a point, a 
democracy should be responsive to its people - not corporations. We 
should be focusing on the testimony of those who will be affected by 
these hateful laws, not the posturing of capital. Corporate and 
celebrity-led boycotts exacerbate the disconnect between the people and 
their democratic power by punishing them for the actions of their 
legislators by withdrawing jobs and tax dollars, and showing that their 
democratic vote is ultimately second to corporate dollars.<br>
<br>
Capital may be on the right side of history today, but where will it be 
tomorrow? Americans shouldn’t have to rely on Bryan Adams standing up 
for their rights to be protected from bigotry.</div>

The Columbus Dispatch<br>
By Curtis Schieber<br>
April 13, 2016 </strong><br>
 <br>
Rethinking or retooling an album once it is released is far less likely than regretting it.<br>
<br>
Though few artists would regret releasing an album such as Bruce 
Springsteen’s fifth release, 1980's “The River,” whose 20-song double 
album raised eyebrows for its length and sprawling themes, the Boss 
revisited the entire album, song-for-song, in Value City Arena on 
Tuesday night. The tour supports “The Ties That Bind: The River 
Collection,” a multi-CD reissue.<br>
<br>
The first four albums were “young man’s records,” said Springsteen, as 
he introduced the program for the first part of the evening. With “The 
River” the songwriter began to explore his place in the larger community
 and his role in its smaller orbit, the family.<br>
<br>
It was interesting that — as heard Tuesday night — more of the young man was present in those songs than he might have imagined.<br>
<br>
Most important for the sold-out arena crowd, the singer, at 66, was able
 to rock nearly as hard as when the album was released. All-out rockers 
such as “Sherry Darling,” which steamrolled into the audience on the 
back of Charlie Giordano’s Hammond organ, and “Crush On You,” a classic 
rock-and-roll song that feels like one still, displayed not only his 
still-potent energy but the killer ensemble playing of a seasoned band, 
most of which has honed its communal chops for decades.<br>
<br>
To wit, drummer Marvelous Max Weinberg nailed the bottom all night with 
bassist Garry Tallent, while the double guitar attack of Nils Lofgren 
and Steve Van Zandt made the sound swing and also crunch. All of the E 
Street band seemed to be living as though it were 35 years ago.<br>
<br>
But the first part was all about coming to terms with personal history for Springsteen.<br>
<br>
When he performed romantic songs such as “Drive All Night,” which 
testified maybe a bit too long, and “I Wanna Marry You,” he sounded like
 the familiar romantic of his earliest days. When he rocked out in tunes
 such as “Cadillac Ranch” and others, he sounded like the party boy of 
old.<br>
<br>
And when he delivered songs such as “The Price You Pay,” “The River” and
 “Fade Away,” he seemed to be finding that he saw the fallout all along.<br>
<br>
If “Hungry Heart” — a celebratory performance Tuesday night that 
featured Springsteen surfing all over the crowd — was a sign that even 
when reality sets in, life is still good, “Independence Day” suggested 
he knew even then what growing up would mean.<br>
<br>
If there was a song that with relistening sounds more significant and 
devastating today than it did Tuesday night, it was the album’s closer, 
“Wreck On The Highway.” A grim scenario finishing the cycle of songs, it
 seems to suggest it doesn’t matter because it might all slip away at 
any moment. On Tuesday, it was almost perfunctory, as if the writer had 
come to realize that the meat of the record is, in fact, the meat of 
life.<br>
<br>
Springsteen began a second show of hits without stop as deadline called.</div>

Detroit Metro Times<br>
April 15, 2016</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen’s coming of age album The River was released in 1980 -
 long before my existence as a human being was even considered - but the
 songs and themes of the album still feel relevant and relatable, they 
don't age — kind of like The Boss himself.  <br>
<br>
And seeing this legendary artist (and his equally legendary band) 
perform for the first time, this millennial got a taste of what's been 
keeping fans coming for more year after year. <br>
<br>
2016 marked the 25th anniversary of timeless album, and while it didn’t 
spawn hits like some of his more popular albums, it seemingly holds a 
special place in the artist's memory. <br>
<br>
When describing it to a packed crowd last night at The Palace, 
Springsteen said, “This is my coming of age album. I wanted to make an 
album that was as big as life.” <br>
<br>
The first two hours of the three-and-a-half hour show was completely 
dedicated to The River. Die-hard fans jumped with joy when Springsteen 
and the band hurled into songs like “Two Hearts,” “The Ties That Bind,” 
and “Hungry Heart.” Things even got emotional when he played the 
deep-cut “Independence Day.” The average Springsteen fan may not have 
known every song - myself included - but that didn’t stop them from 
dancing and swaying to what the legend had to say. <br>
<br>
Not to throw shade, but it was kind of incredible to see how in shape 
and lively Springsteen and his band was for THE. ENTIRE. NIGHT. That's 
three hours! Most people my age can't keep in continuous motion, let 
along perform a medley of timeless tunes, for that amount of time. <br>
<br>
This would have been me if I would have played for almost 4 hours to some 14,000 fans. <br>
 <br>
Drummer Max Weinberg kept the beat steady all night and guitarists Nils 
Lofgren and crowd favorite Stevie Van Zandt proved why their induction 
to the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame in 2014 was deservingly so. There was 
even a small tribute to the late members of the E Street band, pianist 
Danny Federici and The Big Man Clarence Clemons (Clemons’ nephew Jake 
Clemons replaced him when his uncle passed).  From sharing guitar solos 
and sharing microphones, the E Street band is a family for Bruce, and 
the crowd was a part of that family, too. (Notably absent was 
Springsteen’s wife, Patti Scialfa, who normally plays acoustic guitar in
 the band.) <br>
<br>
The real magic happened once The River portion of the show ended. From 
then on out it was hit after hit. The crowd erupted when they broke into
 “Badlands” and a fantastic cover of Patti Smith’s “Because The Night” 
(which Springsteen co-wrote).<br>
<br>
Before the encore began, Springsteen addressed the crowd about his 
recent cancellation of a recent North Carolina show because of law that 
is regulating transgender people using bathrooms. Bruce caught wind of a
 similar bill that may be going through Michigan legislation and warned 
the crowd just how truly awful it is, “because we love playing in 
Michigan.” He then went into a very fueled and angsty version of “Born 
in the USA" that reminded me that this country really is great. <br>
<br>
That was followed by classics “Born to Run,” “Dancing in the Dark” 
(where Bruce brought up two excited fans ala Courteney Cox), “Rosalita,”
 and the song that brought up Detroit rocker Bob Seger to play the 
tambourine on stage “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out.” According to another 
concert-goer, Springsteen started the original “The River Tour” in Ann 
Arbor in the early 80’s and Seger joined The Boss on stage then as well.
 Full circle, indeed. <br>
<br>
The house lights came back on during the encore, and it was a truly 
magical moment. Springsteen’s music is so cemented into American rock n’
 roll. He is so influential - both musically and politically - that the 
entire night felt like everyone was seeing Springsteen for the first 
time.</div>

<br>
<br>
From taping The Grateful Dead back in the day to helming nugs.net, 
founder Brad Serling talks about the intricacies of delivering live 
music via downloads and streams –“I’d say, [for] a good chunk of our 
artists, the live download revenue is their highest revenue stream aside
 from ticket sales.” Recent gigs by Yonder Mountain String Band, 
Widespread Panic, Phil Lesh &amp; Friends, and Bruce Springsteen &amp; 
The E Street Band are just a few of the downloads offered by nugs.net.<br>
Streaming is also an important part of the agenda.  Nugs.net introduced 
its first subscription streaming app in November 2015, launching with 
10,000 professionally recorded concerts. As of this week the app 
includes hundreds of live recordings by Pearl Jam, The Disco Biscuits, 
and others. As downloads and streams of recent concerts become more 
essential to the total concert experience, nugs.net continues to serve 
as the platform bringing fans and artists together.  <br>
<strong class="text-strong">It’s where you can purchase a recording of 
one of Springsteen’s latest shows or snag one of his famed performances 
from years past.  For the concert fan, a browse through nugs.net’s 
inventory is like being the proverbial kid in the candy shop.<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What’s nugs.net’s origin story?</strong><br>
<br>
The Reader’s Digest version is that I was on tour taping The Grateful 
Dead.  You could buy a taper ticket and officially record the band with 
their permission.  It got to the point where … it took so much time out 
of the day just to make copies of my tapes for friends who wanted them. 
 I thought, “Hey, there must be a better idea.”<br>
So I called The Grateful Dead at the time, this was around 1994, and 
said, “Can I put my Dead tapes on a website?” They said, “What’s a 
website?” and “Do whatever you want.  Just don’t rip us off.” That’s how
 nugs.net started, as a site where I was posting MP3s of my Dead tapes, 
ostensibly with their permission.  It was a non-commercial site, just 
free downloads. Then I started adding Phish tapes, some other bands. 
MFast forward to 2000 I get a call from The Grateful Dead’s lawyers 
saying, “We need to shut you down or go into business with you.”  We 
were doing 3 million downloads a month at that point of free Grateful 
Dead MP3s, Phish MP3s, all from my tape collection.  So, I said, “How 
about we go into business?”  I sent them a business plan and the next 
thing I know I’m in San Francisco having a meeting with members of The 
Dead.  Interestingly enough, members of Pearl Jam were at that meeting, 
all their lawyers and archivists.  There was a whole plan to do this, a 
one-stop shop to service bands … offering downloads from their live 
catalog as well as handling mechanicals, their album catalogs, their 
merch.  A lot of pie-in-the-sky talk about how to pull these bands’ 
resources together.  It was called “Project Bandwagon” back in 2000.  So
 The Grateful Dead hired me as a consultant for that. That’s how 
nugs.net actually became a business.  It went from nugs.net just being a
 fan site with [my] tape collection to me being a consultant for 
Grateful Dead Productions on this Bandwagon project. As you can imagine,
 it didn’t really pan out.  It was hard for the bands to agree on how to
 value each other’s I.P.  It was a great idea, just a little bit ahead 
of its time.  Meanwhile, through that meeting I met Phish’s manager, 
John Paluska, at the time.  Phish wanted to do this.  Phish broke up in 
2000 but said, “When we get back together, let’s talk about this.”  By 
the time Phish got back together, New Year’s 2002, that’s when nugs.net 
went legit, so to speak.  We actually became a paid commercial service 
to download live music.<br>
What was interesting, it was very important for the band that the 
nugs.net site stayed free so that fans wouldn’t think nugs.net sold out.
 … So we launched LivePhish.com as a way to download every Phish show 
right after it happened. … Then it grew from there.  We signed 
Metallica, we signed all these other jambands and here we are now.<br>
Although we’re talking about live recordings, nugs.net also offers studio albums.<br>
<br>
Nugs.net is all about live music. … The most important deals we have in 
place, that are personally important to me, are things like our 
relationship with Warner Bros.  An example is the Led Zeppelin catalog, 
recently remastered and released as hi-definition downloads.  
Hi-definition audio has been really important to us. … It’s a balance of
 last night’s Springsteen show and last night’s Pearl Jam show, to me … 
it’s like a full-balance of, “Here’s last night’s show from your 
favorite band but also the crown jewels of rock presented in the most 
pristine form, and you can get it all in the same place directly from 
nugs.net."  There was a while where we actually the only place selling 
the hi-def and lossless Zeppelin.<br>
We certainly put out the studio releases from artists we’re working 
with.  But the idea for us is that the studio, especially back-catalog 
studio, is the candy of the check-out aisle.  If somebody is coming to 
our site to buy last night’s Widespread Panic Show – the Panic covers a 
lot of Neil Young – we also have the entire Neil Young catalog. So you 
might want to pick up the original version of “Cortez The Killer.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Is nugs.net involved with the recording of the show or does it serve solely as a platform for sales and distribution?<br>
<br>
It</strong> depends on the band.   Frankly, we’d be out of business if we were sending [recording] crews out to all these [shows].<br>
In most cases, it’s the artist’s front of house engineer that’s making a
 recording of each night’s show.  I’d say that 99 percent of the times 
we’re working with a new artist, the front of house engineer is doing 
that anyway.  He’s already been making those recordings.  Ideally he’s 
blending in front-of-house mics, time aligning it, and uploading it to 
us on a nightly basis. That’s typically how it works.<br>
<br>
So we’re taking the front-of-house mix.  These are shows getting up to 
the theatre and shed level.  Once we get to arenas and stadiums, it’s a 
different experience. When you get to the arena level, Phish and 
Metallica are good examples, they have engineers of their choice on the 
road making separate live multi-track mix exclusively for a nugs.net 
release. So there’s a front of house engineer mixing the show for the 
room and there’s another engineer, in the dressing room or wherever, 
taking all the feeds from the stage and doing a 118 channel mixdown live
 … uploading that to us each night. That’s the ideal scenario.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
Then we get to kind of the middle ground with Springsteen.  In the 
interim from his last tour until now we had put out eight or nine 
archive shows, 24-track mixes done in a studio going back to New Year’s 
1975.  These are iconic shows, New Year’s ’75 at the Tower [Theatre], 
the Agora ’78, which is our biggest seller of all time, of anything 
we’ve ever done.  We’ve done New Year’s 1980 at Nassau Coliseum, all 
these gorgeous sounding releases that were mixed from multitracks.  So 
we had set the bar pretty high when we started working with Bruce.</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
The Springsteen tour is kind of a hybrid where it’s being recorded 
multitrack every night.  Then the hard drives are being sent to Chiller 
Sound in Manhattan.  Jon Altschiller is doing a mix each night, then 
sending it to the team for approval.  There’s a whole feedback loop in 
place.  At this point we’re putting out about three shows a week but 
it’s actually atypical of what nugs.net usually does. </strong> <br>
<br>
Usually a band uploads the show and we put it out the next day.  It’s an
 immediate thing. Pearl Jam is the extreme other end of the spectrum 
where they record everything and then take it back to their studio in 
Seattle, do all the mixes after the tour, then send it to be mastered 
and we put out the shows maybe six weeks after the tour ends.  It’s a 
tug of war with the fans.  They want it right away but they also want 
the best sounding thing. While talking with long-lived acts like 
Springsteen or Metallica, have the band members or their representatives
 expressed any desire that the authorized live downloads might cut down 
on the unauthorized bootlegs in circulation? For bands like Phish and 
The Grateful Dead, and all the subsequent incarnations of The Dead, it’s
 always been part of the culture, allowing fans to tape … fans are 
shocked if you’re not doing that, if you’re in that world.  But when you
 get into … I’d even say Pearl Jam.  Pearl Jam was a pioneer.  They 
started this in 2000, doing it with Sony, which was unheard of at the 
time, putting out every night of the tour.  So it does depend on the 
band. Metallica, interestingly, always allowed taping.  They were kind 
of The Grateful Dead of metal, in that regard, where they really took 
care of their fans. The initial idea Metallica came to me with was, 
“Let’s just release everything for free.”  Then, of course, you look at 
all the costs that go into it.  “OK. I guess we gotta charge something 
for it.”  But when we got to the Live Metallica app, which was one of 
the first band-specific apps, it was only 99 cents and you got to stream
 all of these shows.  So there was kind of a balance … it wasn’t so much
 to beat the bootleggers, it was just to give the fans a better quality 
version of what they were already doing.<br>
For most artists, it is a new [significant] revenue stream.  I’d say, of
 a good chunk of our artists, the live download revenue is their highest
 revenue stream aside from ticket sales.  Higher than any merch item, 
higher than their album royalties.  <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">When you get to the Springsteen level, I have to imagine we’re a drop in the bucket</strong>. <br>
<br>
 Same with Metallica.  It’s not like, “Wow!  This is our new business.” 
It’s, “Let’s do something better for the fans.”  Of course, we’re going 
to make money because we have to cover all of the costs that go into it.
 We have to pay for studio time, the gear, pay the engineers, running 
the site … all of that stuff.  It is a business. While it’s significant 
revenue for nugs.net, I don’t know how significant it is for an artist 
of that stature. Not that it’s not important.  We had similar 
conversation when we were working with Roger Daltrey and Robert Plant 
when they had solo tours.  When The Who came out, we said we wanted to 
do it with [the band], it wasn’t exactly enough money for them to make 
it worthwhile.  I’ll never forget the quote from their manager – “What 
is a significant amount of money to Pete Townshend is much larger than a
 significant amount of money to you and me.”  It’s a different metric.  
It was the same with Zeppelin.  We said, “Why don’t we go and put out 
all the old Zeppelin archives?”  And it was like, “They don’t need the 
money.  They don’t want to be bothered. Robert would rather go and do 
his thing and John Paul Jones is touring.”<br>
I’d put Paul McCartney in the same boat.  We spoke to his camp about 
doing some pay-per-view webcasts.  [And they said] “Well. … Why?”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What is nugs.net doing with apps?<br>
<br>
One</strong> of the key things we’re doing in the App Store now is the 
LivePhish App, a subscription service just for Phish. It’s $9.99 a month
 and you get 500 shows in the Live Phish archives and then every night 
the band plays.  The real compelling thing for fans is they were buying 
downloads every night of the tour, anyway.  Now they can pay just a 
subscription fee and stream it on every device.  It’s been very popular 
among fans. We took the same idea and created the nugs.net app.  The 
idea being we can only split up the fan base so many times.  We work 
with Phish and just about every other jamband. So when you have 
Widespread Panic, Umphrey’s McGee, The Disco Biscuits and all these 
bands … we can’t expect [fans] to pay $9.99 for Phish, $9.99 for Panic. 
 Not only that, but the listening experience for a fan, you don’t want 
to have to open up a different app every time you want to listen to a 
different band’s show.  With the nugs.net app you pay one flat fee and 
you can listen to last night’s show from 15 of your favorite bands. 
These are bands that have been touring for years. Bands like moe., we 
have 500-800 shows in the archives.  We have 1,200 Umphrey’s McGee shows
 in the archive, and every new show they play.  That’s a higher-price 
point because it has more bands. It’s $12.99 per month.  That also has 
Pearl Jam in there, so you have 360 shows or something from the Pearl 
Jam archive going back to 2000, including a couple of archive shows from
 the ’90s. Then you have the current tours. We’re hoping to add more 
bands.  <strong class="text-strong">There’s one Bruce show in there now from The River 1980 tour. I</strong> don’t think we’re going to put the current tour in there but we’re hoping to add the 2014 shows.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The app is strictly for streaming?<br>
<br>
Yeah</strong>.  In terms of the way it works, it’s like Spotify or Apple
 Music.  It’s on-demand, all-access to everything. You can listen on 
your iPhone [and] other devices.  We’re going to roll out a Sonos 
integration in the next couple of months.  There is a desktop version 
for Phish that is browser-based and we’re going to have a desktop app 
for nugs.net for both Mac and PC.  But the primary usage is mobile.  
It’s on-demand, on your phone, all access all the time.<br>
<br>
[<strong class="text-strong">With] Springsteen, we built into 
Springsteen’s own site.  Normally, we build a standalone thing, like a 
LiveMetallica.com or a LivePhish.com.  But with Bruce we wanted to make 
it a part of his site.  Sony was very gracious with this.  They run 
BruceSpringsteen.net and they allowed us to build the live store bolted 
on to that.  It looks and feels like you’re still in Springsteen’s world
 and you’re transacting with him as opposed to buying it from Live 
Nation or from Sony.  We also added his whole catalog.  I think it was 
the first time a major artist had his whole catalog on sale on his own 
site and had it in lossless format as well, and in hi-def format.  That 
was significant for us, to have the entire catalog from his career and 
have all these live shows, all in one spot, all on his own website.</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Is sorting out copyright and publishing information a mini-nightmare for nugs</strong>.net?<br>
<br>
Yes and no.  For mechanicals, it’s pretty straightforward.  For every 
download and every CD that we’re selling, we have a thriving CD 
business, kind of an anomaly. So the mechanicals are straightforward 
because there’s a … set rate for publishing.  There’s no negotiating 
necessary unless you want to work out a better deal. … We’re handling 
that for most artists.  Some artists do it themselves.  In some cases 
their label does it.  It’s done jointly with us and Sony for Bruce. But 
take Metallica, for example. We’re clearing all those rights and we’re 
putting out every show Metallica has played since 2004.<br>
With streaming of the audio, it’s a little more complicated because of 
how performance royalties work, and percentages. The calculations are 
more complicated but it’s still kind of a straightforward process. 
What’s difficult is live video.  The sync rights required for live 
video, there is no set rate and you have to negotiate every time.  
That’s why we have 15-20,000 audio recordings in nugs.net’s archives 
from 1,000 bands but we’ve got, I’d say, 100 or so videos.  The reason 
is because of the licensing.  <strong class="text-strong">Our bands play a lot of covers.  Even Bruce plays a lot of covers</strong><br>
<br>
.  And cover songs are an issue for video.  Not for audio because it’s 
pretty straightforward.  An example, Widespread Panic played a two-night
 stand for Halloween and we webcasted it live as pay-per-views on 
nugs.tv.  Then we wanted to release it on DVD, Blu-ray and video 
on-demand [with]  22 covers over the course of two nights, it took from 
Halloween until about three weeks ago to clear all of those covers. … 
It’s a lot of work for, frankly, not a lot of return.  We’ll do OK 
selling video after the fact, but we don’t do it a lot. Phish is another
 good example.  We’ve done pay-per-views of over 100 Phish shows at this
 point.  At this stage in their touring career where they’re only doing 
25 or maybe 40, 50 shows per year, max, at this point we’re 
pay-per-viewing almost every other show, or maybe one out of every three
 shows.  But we don’t make those available after the fact.  They’re only
 available live because of that licensing issue. It is so much effort to
 get those sync rights, we just focus on live.  Not to say the band 
won’t release stuff in the future. I’m sure they will.  They’ve been 
capturing every show, hi-def multi-camera shoots, since 2010. Hopefully,
 one day [video] will be sorted out but I feel that it’s the Wild West 
right now and the publishers … are using that to their advantage to 
secure the best deal they can.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What kind of space does nugs.net occupy in the brick-and-mortar</strong> world? <br>
<br>
At this stage of the game it’s ever-revolving.  There’s a cloud-based 
component … there’s a couple of different data centers.  We have to be 
redundant and we have to be global.  Especially with Pearl Jam, 
Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Bruce Springsteen, we’re serving a
 global audience.  When we were just doing Phish and other jambands, it 
was almost exclusively U.S.  Maybe a little of Japan for Phish.  But we 
have a huge presence in Brazil, in terms of fan demand.  Even China and 
parts of Africa. We did a free webcast of Metallica the night before 
Super Bowl 50.  They were playing AT&amp;T Park here in San Francisco. 
We did a free webcast on LiveMetallica.com.  We had over 1,000,000 
views.  When we looked at where the people were coming from, it was 
fascinating.  It was the most global event we had ever done in the 
history of the company and it was definitely the biggest event we had 
ever done.  In order to support that, we had all kinds of partners.  
Everyone from YouTube to our hosting providers, our data center, using 
Amazon Web Services for some components. … We use the best tools to get 
the job done.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">When approaching a potentially new band for</strong> nugs.<strong class="text-strong">net, what are some of the selling points?</strong><br>
<br>
First of all, it’s found money.  They’re probably already doing this.  
Their front of house engineer is probably already making recordings of 
every show. The other argument is that it is super-serving the fans.  
The fan who is going to be interested in buying the show he attended is 
the fan who is buying tickets for himself and three friends.  It’s the 
same guy. It’s the guy who is going to buy the prerelease of your album,
 who’s going to join your fan club, who is going to buy your merch, who 
is going to go to your special Playa vacation in Mexico, like Phish or 
My Morning Jacket does. … We’re super-serving that fan and that fan is 
going to bring more fans to your shows. It’s a nice little cycle that we
 can prove time and time again that it works.<br>
It’s also a nice little mousetrap that we’ve built.  Let’s take Phish, 
for example. For five years now every Phish ticket comes with a free 
MP3. What’s interesting about that is we’re using the barcode on the 
ticket.  That means we’re capturing the secondary market.  Pretty much 
in the history of ticketing, bands do not get direct contact with the 
ticket holder.  They might occasionally get the information on the 
ticket buyer. … maybe from a Ticketfly or another company, they can get 
the guy who bought the ticket.  But nobody is coming in and buying just 
one ticket.  They’re buying three or four tickets.  We’re getting all of
 those ticket holders to come back to Phish’s website, put in their 
personal information, get a free download and then they go on to buy $50
 worth of other stuff.  Maybe it’s the CD of that show, or maybe they 
bought the three-night package to Mexico or the four-night stand at the 
Garden.  Or they’ll buy our next webcast.  So that’s the funnel we’ve 
created. To get the ticket holder to come back to the band’s website.  
That’s like the holy grail of music marketing.  Normally the lights come
 up after the show and you have no contact with those fans until the 
next time you come to town. Or, maybe the next album drop, which might 
not be for three years.  We’re in constant contact with your fans. We’ve
 given them a reason to come back to the band’s website. That’s the 
marketing pitch on it. And it’s priceless.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Is there anything you’ve wanted to tell the <strong class="text-strong">world about </strong>nugs.net but no one has asked the right question?</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">I guess it would be what does [the name] 
nugs.net stand for?  It’s not an acronym.  It’s not N-U-G-S. … It’s kind
 of a play on words, a “nugget.’  The stuff we’ve done with Bruce 
Springsteen recently is a great example.  We’ve gone into this treasure 
trove of the Bruce Springsteen archives, stuff that had never been 
released before, had never seen the light of day.  We’re pulling out 18 
reels of half-inch tape of a run of shows from ’78.  Those tapes, 
literally, have to be baked in order to get the musical information off 
of them.  It’s a nugget.  What we are doing is digging up nuggets. <br>
<br>
[b</strong>]Where do you see yourself in 10 years?[/b]<br>
<br>
I would see us doing exactly doing what we are doing now. Hopefully 
doing it better and doing it with bigger artists on a bigger scale … or 
on a global scale.  Me, personally, I would like to spend more of my 
time hosting the show every week on SiriusXM.  That’s what I personally 
enjoy, the curation.  I can always tell somebody what they’re going to 
want to hear. … I love it when I get a chance to go on E Street radio 
and talk to the Springsteen fans. … In order to do that we need to grow 
the company more so I can spend less time in the trenches.  But I also 
like fighting in the trenches. I’m thrilled to be able to do this 
because it’s a dream come true.  I wake up every day and cannot believe 
that I get to do this.  Because I’d be doing it anyway.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Review: Seger wades into Springsteen's River at Palace<br>
 Adam Graham, <br>
The Detroit News <br>
April 15, 2016<br>
<br>
A</strong> Detroit legend waded into Bruce Springsteen’s “River” on 
Thursday night at the Palace of Auburn Hills when Bob Seger jumped on 
stage at the end of the three-hour, 20-minute concert and joined the E 
Street Band for a pair of songs.<br>
<br>
Seger, who prior to hitting the stage could be seen in the front row of 
the crowd pumping his fist and playing air guitar during “Born to Run,” 
played the tambourine and sang backup vocals on “Tenth Avenue 
Freeze-Out” and a cover of the Isley Brothers’ “Shout.”<br>
<br>
It was a callback, of sorts, to when Seger joined Springsteen on the 
opening night of the original “River” tour back in 1980 at Crisler Arena
 in Ann Arbor, when he sang “Thunder Road” with the Boss during the 
show’s encore. (Seger even wore a University of Michigan T-shirt, as if 
to hammer the point home.) But Seger’s professional duties on Thursday 
were light – mostly he was there geeking out, just like the rest of the 
14,000-odd fans in attendance.<br>
<br>
Springsteen, still every bit the marathon man even at 66 years of age, 
was typically magnificent on Thursday, giving a tireless 33-song 
performance where he seemed to gain momentum as the night wore on. The 
band – Seger included – took its bows at 11:30 p.m., and Springsteen 
seemed like he could have gone another hour. He was just getting 
started.<br>
<br>
Springsteen caused a major stir last week when he canceled a concert in 
North Carolona over the state’s proposed “bathroom law,” which dictates 
which bathrooms transgender people are permitted to use. Springsteen 
noted Michigan is proposing a similar law and spoke out against it. “We 
hope the bill doesn’t pass, ’cause we love playing in Michigan,” he 
said, before tearing into a particularly angry “Born in the USA.”<br>
<br>
Yes, he’s still fired up, and Springsteen is a model for aging 
gracefully in rock and roll while keeping his integrity in tact. His 
live performances are sermons, and even if he’s not the dynamo he was on
 stage even a few years ago, he still seems to be sipping from the 
Fountain of Youth. “Are you ready to be entertained?” he asked at the 
top of the show. “Are you ready to be transformed?”<br>
<br>

For most, promises like those would come with production gags, stage 
tricks and moving parts, but that has never been the Springsteen M.O. 
He’s just a guy with a band and a few lights, that’s it. He doesn’t even
 use a confetti canon, which is standard issue at concerts these days. 
The biggest special effect employed Thursday was when two spotlights lit
 up a pair of mirror balls hanging from the rafters. (As if to 
underscore their minimal role, the balls didn’t even spin.)<br>
<br>
Instead of smoke and mirrors, Springsteen and the eight-piece E Street 
Band are their own special effects. There’s something about watching 
Springsteen preach to his fans – and watching his fans react to him – 
that give his shows a unique sense of life. And watching Springsteen 
crowd surf – as he did during “Hungry Heart,” falling backwards onto the
 crowd’s hands from a catwalk in the middle of the arena floor and 
getting passed back to the stage – illustrates the connection he has 
with his fans. He falls on them, they lift him up and they keep each 
other going.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s current tour is built around “The River,” his 1980 album 
that marked a new maturity for the then-31-year-old New Jersey native. 
Aside from the album’s hits, of which there are plenty – “Two Hearts,” 
“Hungry Heart,” “Out in the Street” and the title track, to name a few –
 the album also has many solemn songs, which made for some of the show’s
 most engaging moments. He talked about the origin of “Independence 
Day,” which unfolds as “a late night conversation around a kitchen table
 between two people who love one another but are struggling to 
understand each other,” and “Stolen Car” was given a breathtakingly 
stark presentation. Meanwhile, “Drive All Night” ever so slowly built to
 the emotional climax of the night; no less a Springsteen authority than
 radio host Mike “Stoney” Stone, a veteran of more than 100 Springsteen 
shows, rose to his feet to acknowledge the moment.<br>
<br>
“The River” section of the concert – which kicked off with “Meet Me in 
the City,” an outtake from the album’s sessions – ran approximately two 
hours, and “Badlands” kicked off a second set of 12 songs that included 
“The Promised Land,” “Because the Night,” “The Rising,” “Thunder Road” 
and “Rosalita.” A handful of songs were performed with the houselights 
up, including “Dancing in the Dark,” during which Bruce brought up a 
pair of fans from the crowd to dance, Courteney Cox-style.<br>
<br>
“The River” was about the limited amount of time we have, as Springsteen
 explained as he brought the album to a close, and it brings to mind 
that he, too, has a limited amount of time where he can go out and put 
on three-plus hour arena concerts. Springsteen is not a renewable 
resource, and those marathon concerts aren’t going to last forever. But 
he is still roaring, still entertaining and still transforming. Bring on
 the “Born in the USA” tour.</div>

Review: Springsteen plays ‘coming of age’ record with youthful energy<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band played the Bryce Jordan Center on Monday<br>
<br>
The concert was part of Springsteen’s ‘The River Tour’<br>
<br>
The audience went wild as Springsteen played old favorites<br>
<br>
As far as nicknames go, it’s tough to top “The Boss,” but “Marathon Man” should at least be put on standby.<br>
<br>
On Monday evening, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band took the 
stage at the Bryce Jordan Center, the latest stop on “The River Tour” — 
and the band wouldn’t leave it until nearly three and a half hours 
later.<br>
<br>
Not that anybody was complaining.<br>
<br>
The packed arena was filled with men and women sporting aging tour 
T-shirts, the ghosts of Springsteen concerts past and potent — visual 
reminders of just how far back the celebrated musician’s career now 
stretches.<br>
<br>
“Are you ready to be entertained? Are you ready to be transformed?” Springsteen asked the crowd.<br>
<br>
There was probably a “yes” buried somewhere in the deafening roar that followed.<br>
<br>
Originally released in 1980, “The River” was Springsteen’s fifth album 
and eventually reached the number one spot on the U.S. Billboard 200 
chart.<br>
<br>
“The River was my coming of age record,” Springsteen said.<br>
<br>
In between numbers like “Out in the Street” and “Crush on You,” 
Springsteen paused briefly to provide his faithful following at the BJC 
with some insight into his creative process.<br>
<br>
The musician said that his goal with “The River” had been to put 
together an album that was as big as life without sacrificing the energy
 of a live show.<br>
<br>
Springsteen spoke specifically about his song “Independence Day,” which 
he said was in part about coming to understand his mother and father as 
fully realized people, with hopes and dreams of their own.<br>
<br>
“It’s the kind of song you write when you’re young and first shocked by your parents’ humanity,” Springsteen said.<br>
<br>
If this is all starting to sound far too academic for a Springsteen 
show, rest assured — the pauses remained few and far between.<br>
<br>
“The Boss” mingled with the audience, crowd surfed during a rendition of
 “Hungry Heart” and at one point pulled a young woman up on stage to 
dance.<br>
<br>
Once the band wound its way through “The River,” Springsteen turned to 
old favorites. The crowd went wild for “Born in the USA,” “Dancing in 
the Dark” and “Rosalita.”<br>
<br>
“Wow, what an audience, you guys are phenomenal,” Springsteen said.</div>

Bruce Springsteen's Tribute To Prince Is A Lesson In Public Mourning<br>
<br>
April 27, 2016<br>
<br>
CARYN ROSE</strong><br>
<br>
From the minute the band walked on stage Saturday night at the Barclays 
Center, it was clear this wasn't going to be an ordinary Bruce 
Springsteen and the E Street Band show. Instead of coming out in pairs, 
house lights up, the stage lights went to purple and the musicians took 
their places quickly. Springsteen strode stage left to check in with 
Steve Van Zandt, and then walked back to face drummer Max Weinberg. With
 a barely perceptible nod of the head, he counted as Max clicked his 
sticks eight times, Springsteen turned around towards the end of the 
count, taking his place at the mic, and with a decisive nod to cue the 
entire band, began the opening chords of Prince's "Purple Rain."<br>
<br>
Bruce's effort to maintain the song's building intensity was visible; it
 felt like it originated from a sense of loss, an expression of the 
emptiness that accompanies the departure of a kindred spirit more than 
the original song's timbre of romantic loss and regret. Nils Lofgren 
took the solo, which was absolutely the right call; Lofgren natively 
plays with the same kind of fluidity you'd find in a Prince solo, and he
 played it note-for-note — this was not the night for personal 
interpretation. By the song's final crescendo, Springsteen was singing 
with his eyes closed, conducting the band with the neck of his guitar or
 an upraised arm, before shouting, "Prince forever! God bless!" as the 
song thundered to a close.<br>
<br>
There were other tributes throughout the show. As the house lights 
switched out from purple and the E Street Band prepared to go into the 
usual opening number this tour, you suddenly realized that every member 
of the E Street Band was wearing purple. This wouldn't be remarkable 
except there is a strict black-only dress code on that stage: I stood 
behind Max Weinberg once during a show and saw that even things like the
 cable ties, Solo cups and tissue box covers are black. It was a small 
gesture, probably not noticed by everyone, but quietly meaningful for 
those that did.<br>
<br>
Following "Meet Me In The City," Springsteen stepped to the mic. "We'd 
like to dedicate this show to Prince. There's never been anyone better 
... Bandleader, showman, arranger ... Whenever I would catch one of his 
shows, I would always leave humbled. I'm going to miss that. We're going
 to miss that." If you needed verbal confirmation that Springsteen was a
 fan, that Prince's music meant something to him (which sometimes, his 
very old-white-bro audience needs), there, you had it.<br>
<br>
The commonality between the two artists is larger than their 
differences. They both got their start in the '70s, and their careers 
followed a similar trajectory. Springsteen got tagged with the "new 
Dylan" moniker after being signed to Columbia by John Hammond and 
eventually appeared on the cover of both Time and Newsweek, while Prince
 was the Boy Wonder who was granted full creative control in his first 
contract with Warner Bros. at the age of 18. Their first two albums held
 moments of greatness, but met with mixed commercial and critical 
success — all of which changed with their third releases. For Prince, 
that was 1980's Dirty Mind, and for Springsteen, 1975's Born To Run.<br>
<br>
These were the game-changers that laid the groundwork towards their 
careful progression to superstardom in 1984, with Purple Rain and Born 
In The USA. The five-week reign of "When Doves Cry" at the top of the 
Billboard Hot 100 held "Dancing In The Dark" at bay, depriving 
Springsteen his best shot at a No. 1 single. And as Springsteen alluded 
to in his dedication, both artists have well-deserved reputations for 
sprawling, legendary live shows, assuming their roles as bandleaders 
from the exact same lineage, straight from James Brown.<br>
<br>
This tour, organized in support of Springsteen's 35th anniversary box 
set for The River — has been unusually rigid and formulaic. He opens 
with an outtake from that time period, plays the album from start to 
finish, and then follows the record with another 10-12 songs from the 
greatest hits collection, with very few exceptions to that rule. One of 
those exceptions took place on the opening night of the tour on January 
16, when Springsteen opened the encore with "Rebel Rebel," five days 
after the passing of David Bowie. (There was a similar tribute offered 
at the next show with the death of Glenn Frey.)<br>
<br>
There's something absolutely spiritual about the power of being able to 
mourn in public, as Springsteen himself demonstrated after the deaths of
 E Street Band members Danny Federici in 2008 and then Clarence Clemons 
in 2011. In 2012, the Wrecking Ball tour was like attending a rock and 
roll wake every night. The gestures would evolve as the tour went on, 
but there were multiple carefully crafted moments and regular reminders:
 "Are we missing anybody?" Springsteen would ask every night, gesturing 
to the temporarily empty places stage left. He would head out to a 
platform in the center of the floor for "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out," the 
song that's "the story about the band," and when he got to the lyric, 
"When the change was made uptown/and the Big Man joined the band," the 
aforementioned band would swing to a stop, and Clarence Clemons would 
appear on the video screen; a short montage of clips featuring Clarence 
(and Danny) throughout the years would play. Springsteen would stand 
there and watch it with the audience every time, visibly emotional to 
varying degrees depending on the night and the crowd. (He caught me 
openly weeping at a show in Arizona on that tour, and as he gestured at 
me, I realized that it wasn't just sweat on his face at that moment, 
either.)<br>
<br>
So Springsteen knows the value of working your grief out communally, and
 the power of expressing that despair through live rock and roll. The 
catharsis that came out of the performance of "Purple Rain" Saturday 
night was for him just as it was for the audience.<br>
<br>
But the disruption of the formula of the show on this night was 
significant, as was the gesture of beginning the performance with 
another artist's composition. And the dedication had real meaning, in 
how it impacted the band's performance. It's the end of the U.S. segment
 of the Springsteen tour, and at its previous show in New York (March 23
 at Madison Square Garden, a makeup date for a snowed-out show in 
January) the performance was definitely not the E Street Band at its 
strongest. It felt like they were ready for this segment to wind down; 
playing The River's 20 songs every single night for a 37-date U.S. tour 
isn't an easy thing to do.<br>
<br>
But Saturday night in Brooklyn? You'd think they'd just started the 
tour. Every musician on that stage was finding something more to offer, 
and almost every performance of every song felt renewed. Springsteen was
 in the crowd having fun during the quasi-punk "Crush On You," selling 
it for all he was worth. Steve Van Zandt offered strong guitar work, 
meeting Bruce and not passing up opportunities to take a lead. Nils 
Lofgren threatened to light the place on fire during "Because The 
Night." Garry Tallent was literally bouncing as his bass notes rippled 
through the songs. Roy Bittan's introduction to "Point Blank," probably 
the consistent highlight of the show, had even more pathos and depth. 
Max Weinberg was insanely crisp, without even one lost note. If Prince 
had been at this particular show, he would have nodded in approval, and 
then figured out how to up his game some more.<br>
<br>
The emotional highlight of the evening would be a bold and passionate 
version of "Backstreets," from 1975's Born To Run, a story about youth 
and reckless abandon and regret. These days, the song appears in a set 
list to reward an audience, or to make a point. It is grand and epic, 
and its power has not dimmed over the years. It's always an emotional 
moment, but Saturday night, as Springsteen sang, "We swore we'd live 
forever," it was hard to not see the song and the performance through 
another lens, and I am positive that Springsteen's voice wavered with 
emotion even as he delivered the song with power and depth.<br>
<br>
As a fan of an artist with similar longevity to Prince, it was hard to 
stand in the audience and not think about whether or not this would be 
the last time you'd ever get to hear some of the rarer material again — 
some of the songs from The River just weren't performed after the 
initial tour behind the record in 1980 and '81 — as you considered how 
many times you'd heard a more popular song played, and how easy it is to
 take for granted that you'll always be able to go to a Bruce 
Springsteen show and hear "Born To Run" or "Thunder Road" or "Dancing In
 The Dark." We're not even halfway through the year, but taking 
something like this for granted is a thing that, for me, stops right 
now.</div>

The Pop History Dig<br>
<br>
“Barack &amp; Bruce”<br>
2008-2012<br>
<br>
By Jack Doyle <br>
<br>
December 14, 2012</strong><br>
<br>
     The now well known photos of President Obama and Bruce Springsteen 
on the election trail captures a political moment, certainly, but it 
also underscores how important celebrity endorsements and celebrity 
imagery have become in elections of all kinds – even though political 
analysts have said time and time again, that celebrities have only a 
marginal effect on persuading voters to go with one candidate or 
another.<br>
<br>
There may also be something of a first in the Washington Post putting 
this image on its front page.  How many times has a sitting president 
appeared in a campaign photo arm-and-arm with a celebrity that ran on 
the front page of a national newspaper – or on the cover of a major news
 magazine?  Presumably, that’s pretty rare – especially on election day.<br>
<br>
     But perhaps that’s a moot question in these times since presidents 
and presidential candidates appear frequently with celebrities in many 
public venues.  And yes, politicians have been courting the rich, 
famous, and otherwise influential since forever.  Politicians in ancient
 Rome no doubt sought out famous gladiators and popular generals to do 
their bidding.<br>
<br>
     More recently, in 20th century American politics, Franklin D. 
Roosevelt sought Frank Sinatra’s help in the 1940s – as did John F. 
Kennedy in 1960.  On television, Richard Nixon appeared on Jack Parr’s 
late night TV talk show in 1963, and also in one memorable 1968 Laugh-In
 TV spot.  Ronald and Nancy Reagan stood arm-in-arm with R&amp;B legend 
Ray Charles in a prime-time TV moment during the 1984 Republican 
National Convention.  Bill Clinton played saxophone on The Arsenio Hall 
Show in June 1992, an appearance some say helped Clinton win new 
supporters.  And in December 2007, Barack Obama received the endorsement
 of Oprah Winfrey in a much publicized moment during the Democratic 
presidential primary – also captured on a number of newspaper front 
pages.<br>
<br>
     Today of course, politicians appear regularly on TV shows such as 
the  Late Show with David Letterman, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The
 View,  The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and others.  And with the web 
and You Tube, images of politicians and celebrities are now quite 
ubiquitous.  It is also noted that in recent years even papers like the 
Washington Post have included more coverage of celebrities in politics, 
with regular sections devoted to celebrity doings on all manner of 
public policy, consequential or not.<br>
<br>
     Yet there is still something indelible and lasting about 
photographs of the Springsteen-Obama variety displayed on the front 
pages of major newspapers.  Clearly, the decisions by major news 
organizations to use such images in prominent display are not minor 
matters, or made without purpose.  In this specific case, no doubt, the 
choice of photo and its placement likely had something to do with the 
type of Midwest working-class voters that pundits were saying Obama 
absolutely needed to win re-election – and Bruce Springsteen’s appeal to
 those very same voters.  But beyond these questions of news 
organization photo choices and the play now given celebrities in 
politics, the Obama-Springsteen alliance is interesting in its own 
right, and has a history that now stretches over several years.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">2008 Campaign</strong><br>
<br>
     Bruce Springsteen has been in Barack Obama’s corner since at least 
April 2008 when he first endorsed then U.S. Senator Barack Obama for the
 Democratic presidential nomination.  Obama at the time was battling 
Hillary Clinton for his party’s presidential nomination.  Springsteen, 
who first became a rock sensation in the mid-1970s, has been sought out 
by politicians for years who have tried to associate with his music, 
gain his endorsement, and/or use his name in a speech, as Ronald Reagan 
did when he was campaigning for reelection in New Jersey in September 
1984.<br>
<br>
     But in April 2008 when Springsteen endorsed Obama, the rock star 
explained that the candidate “speaks to the America I’ve envisioned in 
my music for the past 35 years.”  In a letter Springsteen posted on his 
website addressed to friends and fans, he explained that he believed 
Obama was the best candidate to undo “the terrible damage done over the 
past eight years.”  In Springsteen’s view, Obama had “the depth, the 
reflectiveness, and the resilience to be our next president…”<br>
<br>
 During the 2008 campaign, Springsteen appeared at several Obama 
rallies, and also performed several solo acoustic performances in 
support of Obama.  Near the end of the 2008 campaign, on November 2nd, 
he debuted the song “Working on a Dream” in a duet with his wife, Patti 
Scialfa.<br>
<br>
     At one Ohio rally during the 2008 campaign, Springsteen discussed 
the importance of “truth, transparency and integrity in government, the 
right of every American to have a job, a living wage, to be educated in a
 decent school, and a life filled with the dignity of work, the promise 
and the sanctity of home…But today those freedoms have been damaged and 
curtailed by eight years of a thoughtless, reckless and morally-adrift 
administration.”<br>
<br>
     On the night of Obama’s electoral victory, November 4, 2008, 
Springsteen’s song “The Rising” was the first song played at the Chicago
 Grant Park rally after Obama’s victory speech.<br>
<br>
     Bruce Springsteen was also the opening musical act for the Obama 
Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. on 
January 18, 2009 – an event attended by more than 400,000 people. <br>
<br>
     At that celebration, Springsteen performed “The Rising” with an 
all-female choir and also sang Woody Guthrie’s “This Land Is Your Land” 
with Pete Seeger.  Springsteen and Seeger were not the only performers 
that day, as a number of others performed then and through the evening 
with the various inaugural balls.<br>
<br>
     A long list of Hollywood stars and musical artists came to 
Washington as invited performers, readers, and special guests to fete 
Obama on his special day.  A partial list of some of those involved in 
the inaugural festivities include the following: Jack Black, Mary J. 
Blige, Jon Bon Jovi, Garth Brooks, Steve Carrell, Sheryl Crow, Rosario 
Dawson, Renee Fleming, Jamie Foxx, Josh Groban, Herbie Hancock, Tom 
Hanks, Heather Headley, Ashley Judd, Martin Luther King III, Beyonce 
Knowles, Queen Latifah, Bettye Lavette, John Legend, Laura Linney, 
George Lopez, Jennifer Nettles, John Mellencamp, Kal Penn, Shakira, 
James Taylor, Marisa Tomei, Usher, U2, Denzel Washington, Forest 
Whitaker, will.i.am, Stevie Wonder, Tiger Woods, and others.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kennedy Center Honors</strong><br>
<br>
     In December 2009, Bruce Springsteen was one of five recipients 
designated for the Kennedy Center Honors – an annual award made to 
various artists for their contributions to American culture.  In 
addition to Springsteen, Mel Brooks, Dave Brubeck, Grace Bumbry, and 
Robert De Niro were also honored that year.  At a White House reception 
for the honorees, here is what President Obama had to say about 
Springsteen:<br>
<br>
…Finally, we honor the quiet kid from Jersey — (laughter) — who grew up 
to become the rock ‘n’ roll laureate of a generation.  For in the life 
of our country only a handful of people have tapped the full power of 
music to tell the real American story — with honesty; from the heart; 
and one of those people is Bruce Springsteen.<br>
<br>
He has said: “I’ve always believed that people listen to your music not 
to find out about you, but to find out about themselves.”  And for more 
than three decades, in his songs — of dreams and despair, of struggle 
and hope — hardworking folks have seen themselves.<br>
<br>
They’ve seen their great state of New Jersey.  And they’ve seen their 
America — in songs that become anthems.  Restless kids who were “Born to
 Run.”  The struggles of workers in “My Hometown.”  The sacrifices of 
vets who were “Born in the U.S.A.”  Love and loss in “Streets of 
Philadelphia.”  A resilient nation in “The Rising.”  And, this year, a 
country “Working on a Dream.”<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics"><br>
…[W]hen I watched him on  the steps of the Lincoln Memorial when he 
rocked the National Mall before my inauguration,I thought it captured as
 well as anything the spirit of what America should be about…<br>
           – President Barack Obama </em><br>
<br>
It’s no wonder that his tours are not so much concerts, but communions. 
 There’s a place for everybody -— the sense that no matter who you are 
or what you do, everyone deserves their shot at the American Dream; 
everybody deserves a little bit of dignity; everybody deserves to be 
heard.<br>
<br>
I’ve seen it myself.  Bruce was a great fan — a great friend over the 
last year, and when I watched him on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial 
when he rocked the National Mall before my inauguration, I thought it 
captured as well as anything the spirit of what America should be about.
 On a day like that, and today, I remember: I’m the President, but he’s 
The Boss. (Applause.)<br>
<br>
And Bruce continues to inspire, along with his “house-rocking, 
earth-shaking” E Street Band.  At 60 years old, he’s still filling 
stadiums, still whipping fans into a frenzy, still surfing the crowd, 
still jumping off pianos, and still reaching new fans, and still being 
nominated for Grammys.  It’s been a long road from that stage at Stone 
Pony in Asbury Park to this stage today, but this much we know — after 
more than 30 years and 120 million albums sold, Bruce Springsteen is 
still one “cool rockin’ Daddy.” (Laughter and applause.)<br>
<br>
     At the Kennedy Center ceremony, Springsteen was also lauded by 
several celebrities including Jon Stewart, with musical tributes from 
John Mellencamp, Ben Harper, Jennifer Nettles, Melissa Etheridge, Eddie 
Vedder, and Sting.  Meanwhile, back in Springsteen’s home state of New 
Jersey, some developments on the Republican side of the political aisle 
during 2009 would also involve the singer and his music.<br>

<strong class="text-strong">No To Christie</strong><br>
<br>
     In November 2009, Chris Christie – an up-and-coming Republican star
 in New Jersey’s political ranks who had been a top fundraiser for 
George W. Bush’s 2000 presidential campaign, and later, New Jersey’s 
U.S. attorney – was elected governor.  He had defeated former Democratic
 governor and U.S. Senator Jon Corzine.  Christie was also a devoted 
Bruce Springsteen fan who had attended more than 120 of Springsteen’s 
concerts. <br>
<br>
     Christie regarded Springsteen’s politics as a form of populism that
 anyone could identify with, though he parts ways with Springsteen on 
some of his core philosophy, such as his view  that “nobody wins unless 
everybody wins.”  Christie holds “that in life there are winners and 
losers — there just are… We can’t make everybody winners.  But you can 
make more people winners.”  Christie says he doesn’t take Sprinsteen’s 
politics personally.  For him, with Springsteen, it’s the music that 
matters.<br>
<br>
     After his election, Christie wanted nothing more than to have 
Springsteen appear at his inauguration, scheduled for January 2010.  
Through an intermediary, Christie sent word to Springsteen’s manager, 
Jon Landau, to ask if Springsteen would perform.  Christie offered to 
make a gift to Springsteen’s charity of choice if he would agree to 
perform for the governor-elect.<br>
<br>
In late 2009, New Jersey  governor Chris Christie wanted Springsteen to perform at his inaugural festivities.<br>
  Knowing that Springsteen was a Democrat, Christie’s people also 
offered to put a little distance between the Christie inauguration and 
any Springsteen event, suggesting a benefit concert in the week leading 
up to the January 19th inaugural.  The editors of The Star Ledger 
newspaper of Newark, New Jersey, the state’s largest circulation 
newspaper, even ran an editorial on November 7th urging Springsteen to 
do the concert, saying the state needed “a Kumbaya moment.”  But word 
came back that Springsteen did not want to get involved in state 
politics.  Springsteen’s rejection was reportedly polite – that he was 
quite aware that Christie was a fan, and as a loyal citizen of New 
Jersey, wished him every success as governor.  Christie’s people then 
arranged for the B Street Band, a Springsteen tribute band, to perform 
at the governor-elect’s inaugural party.  But there would be more to 
come with Christie and Springsteen later.  Christie, in any case, became
 more of a national figure as he began to be touted as a possible 
Republican Presidential candidate.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">2012 Campaign</strong><br>
<br>
     In early 2012, it appeared that Springsteen was not going to become
 involved in the Obama re-election campaign.  In January, he told ABC 
News: “I prefer to stay on the sidelines… I genuinely believe an artist 
[is] supposed to be the canary in the coal mine, and you’re better off 
with a certain distance from the seat of power.” <br>
<br>
     Springsteen noted at the time that he wasn’t entirely happy with 
Obama’s first term.  He said he would have liked to have seen “more 
activism in job creation sooner than it came,” but that Obama had 
generally done a good job up to that, ticking off some of the 
President’s accomplishments:  “…He kept GM alive, which was incredibly 
important to Detroit and Michigan, and he got the health care law 
passed, although I wish there had been a public option and didn’t leave 
the citizens victims of the insurance companies.  He killed Osama bin 
Laden, which was extremely important.  He brought some sanity to the top
 level of government.”<br>
<br>
     Musically, meanwhile, Springsteen had been working on a new album 
that would bear the title, Wrecking Ball, his 17th studio album; an 
album that included a compilation of songs that were a reaction to, and 
indictment of, Wall Street’s financial crisis and the effect it has had 
on the nation and people’s lives.<br>
<br>
     Wrecking Ball wouldn’t be released until March 2012, but one of its
 songs was released early – “We Take Care of Our Own” – which made its 
live debut on February 12, 2012 at the 54th Grammy Awards. <br>
<br>
     The song is a lament that finds a nation in trouble, hinting at the
 divided partisanship and a government that has had its failings in 
helping people.  “I been looking for the map that leads me home,” 
Springsteen sings.  “I been stumbling on good hearts turned to stone / 
The road of good intentions has gone dry as a bone.”  The song’s central
 message appears to be that we are a nation that does take care of our 
own – that is our core philosophy and who we are; something we all 
understand.  Yet we haven’t always done that, and sometimes we falter.  
And now, in the throes the current hard times, the Springsteen song is 
reminding us that we need to get back to that task, as he sings:. 
“Wherever this flag’s flown, we take care of our own.”<br>
<br>
  On February 9th, 2012, a few days before the song’s airing at the 
Grammy Awards, Obama’s reelection team released a playlist of five songs
 the campaign would be using at campaign rallies.  Among the songs was 
Springsteen’s “We Take Care of Our Own.”  Others on the list included: 
“I Got You” by Wilco; “Roll With The Changes” by REO Speedwagon; “You’ve
 Got The Love” by Florence &amp; The Machine; and, “Let’s Stay Together”
 by Al Green.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">“We Take Care of Our Own”<br>
Bruce Springsteen</strong><br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics"><br>
<br>
I’ve been knockin’ on the door that holds the throne<br>
I’ve been lookin’ for the map that leads me home<br>
I’ve been stumblin’ on good hearts turned to stone<br>
Those good intentions have gone dry as bone<br>
We take care of our own<br>
We take care of our own<br>

<br>
From Chicago to New Orleans<br>
From the muscle to the bone<br>
From the shotgun shack to the Superdome<br>

There ain’t no-one hearing the bugle blown<br>
We take care of our own<br>

Where’s the work that set my hands, my soul free<br>
Where’s the spirit to reign, reign over me<br>

Wherever this flag’s flown<br>
We take care of our own</em><br>
<br>
     However, the Springsteen tune became a popular and often used song 
during the Obama campaign – as its main refrain – “we take care of our 
own” – was generally a good fit with what the Obama Administration was 
trying to do with its economic recovery programs; trying to lift the 
nation out of its hard times.  At the Democratic National Convention in 
early September 2012, the song also received some prime-time exposure 
when it was played immediately following Barack Obama’s speech on 
September 6th.  While Obama’s speech may not have been the highlight of 
the convention, the airing of the Springsteen song at that time helped 
boost the music.  According to Billboard, sales for “We Take Care Of Our
 Own” jumped more 400 percent during the weekend that ended September 9,
 2012, following Obama’s speech.  And by late September, after Mitt 
Romney’s remarks at a private fundraiser were made public about how “47 
percent” of the electorate were victims and that he wouldn’t have to 
worry about them if elected President, the Springsteen song, “We Take 
Care of Our Own,” took on even more resonance at the Obama rallies.<br>
<br>
     But Springsteen himself had repeated his intent to stay out of the 
race, making remarks to The New Yorker in July 2012, saying that he 
wasn’t sure whether he’d get involved again:  “I did it twice [once for 
Kerry in 2004 and Obama in 2008] because things were so dire… It seemed 
like if I was ever going to spend whatever small political capital I 
had, that was the moment to do so.  But that capital diminishes the more
 often you do it.  While I’m not saying never, and I still like to 
support the President, you know, it’s something I didn’t do for a long 
time, and I don’t have plans to be out there every time.”  But as the 
race tightened in late September and early October, especially following
 Obama’s faltering in the first debate, Springsteen once again became a 
more visible Obama supporter.<br>
<br>
     By October 13th, the White House was reporting that Springsteen 
would campaign for Obama.  “Bruce Springsteen’s values echo what the 
President and Vice President stand for: hard work, fairness, integrity,”
 said Jim Messina, Obama for America’s campaign manager.  “His 
appearances will help with our get out the vote effort in these critical
 swing states and we are thrilled with his ongoing support.” <br>
<br>
     On October 17, 2012, Springsteen took to his website to explain his
 support for the President.  “A message from Bruce” noted in part: 
“Right now, there is a fight going on to help make this a fairer and 
more equitable nation.  For me, President Obama is our best choice to 
get us and keep us moving in the right direction…”  In the message, 
Springsteen also voiced support for “sterling candidates” Sen. Sherrod 
Brown (D-Ohio) and Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat seeking a
 U.S. Senate seat.<br>
<br>
     On the following day, October 18th, 2012, Springsteen joined former
 president Bill Clinton at an Obama campaign rally in Parma, Ohio, near 
Cleveland.  A crowd of 3,000 fill a gymnasium at Cuyahoga Community 
College, with 700 more in an overflow area.<br>
<br>
     Rosalind Helderman of the Washington Post filed her story on the 
event with the opening: “President Obama brought the big guns — Bubba 
and the Boss — to Ohio Thursday to shore up his slim edge in the key 
battleground state.”  Bill Clinton, for his part, said during the rally,
 as reported by the New York Times: “This is the first time in my life I
 ever got to be the warm-up act for Bruce Springsteen… I am qualified 
’cause I was born in the U.S.A.,” said Clinton, “and unlike one of the 
candidates for president, I keep all my money here!”<br>
<br>
     Springsteen told the Ohio crowd that he’d spent three decades 
“writing about the distance between the American dream and the American 
reality” and believed Obama was the man to help close the gap between 
the two.  Voting, he said, was “the principle way we get to determine 
that distance and that equation… Voting matters.  Elections matter.” <br>
<br>
     Springsteen performed a set of four songs in Parma, and on the same
 day, he also appeared at another Obama event in Ames, Iowa.  After 
that, there were more appearances by Springsteen at Obama events in 
Virginia, Pittsburgh and Wisconsin.  On Saturday afternoon, October 27th
 in Pittsburgh, for example, he performed for Obama before a capacity 
crowd at the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall and Military Museum. <br>
     In late October, however, as Hurricane Sandy began it destructive 
trek up the East Coast, the presidential campaign was temporarily 
overshadowed.  But this event, too, figured into the Obama-Springsteen 
interplay and national politics.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Hurricane Sandy</strong><br>
<br>
     On the evening of October 29th, 2012, Hurricane Sandy made landfall
 at Atlantic City in southern New Jersey, and soon ravaged the 
NewYork-New Jersey area with severe flooding and extensive damage to 
coastal areas.  The hurricane occurred in the final weeks of the 
presidential election campaign, putting both the Obama and Romney 
campaigns into a temporary lull.  But the catastrophe brought President 
Obama to the storm-damaged New York-New Jersey area, raising his 
national leader visibility as full state and national emergency efforts 
were launched to deal with the devastation.  The President came to the 
hard hit areas, and joined with New York Governor Cuomo, New York Mayor 
Michael Bloomberg, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to commit 
government help to the devastated communities.  New Jersey Governor 
Chris Christie had praise for the president during the crisis – a sore 
point with the Republicans and the president’s opponent, Gov. Mitt 
Romney.  “It’s really important to have the President of the United 
States acknowledge all the suffering that’s going on here in New Jersey 
and I appreciate it very much,” Christie said during Obama’s October 
31st visit to the Brigantine Beach Community Center in Brigantine, N.J.,
 north of Atlantic City.  Christie and the President stayed in contact 
by phone in the days following the disaster.<br>
<br>
     Meanwhile, Bruce Springsteen, a New Jersey native who came to fame 
in Asbury Park, also became involved in Sandy relief effort.  He was 
doing his scheduled concert appearances during this time as well, and on
 October 31, 2012, two days following the storm, he dedicated his 
performance at a concert in Rochester, New York to those affected by the
 storm and those helping with the recovery effort.  At another concert 
at Penn State University on November 1st, he gave a shout out to 
Governor Christie for his hurricane work.<br>
<br>
     On Friday November 2nd, 2012, Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi, also a 
New Jersey native, joined Sting, Christina Aguilera and other music 
stars for an NBC-organized televised benefit concert to raise funds for 
victims of Sandy.  The show, titled “Hurricane Sandy: Coming Together” 
was organized by NBC as a commercial-free one- hour benefit. In addition
 to Bon Jovi, Sting, Springsteen and Agulera were other performers and 
celebrities, including: Billy Joel, Jimmy Fallon, Steven Tyler, Mary J. 
Blige, Tina Fey, Jon Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg, Danny DeVito and NBC 
News’ Brian Williams. Today show co-anchor Matt Lauer was the host.  
During the show, Springsteen joined Billy Joel, Steven Tyler and Jimmy 
Fallon for a performance of “Under the Boardwalk.” Springsteen and the E
 Street Band closed the show on a message of hope with a rousing 
rendition of their tune “Land of Hope and Dreams.”  The telethon raised 
some $32 million.  All money was donated to the American Red Cross.<br>
<br>
     Backstage at this event, Springsteen had a moment with one of his 
biggest fans, Governor Chris Christie, where according to Christie, “we 
hugged and he told me, ‘it’s official, we’re friends’.”  A quick photo 
of this meeting, capturing a handshake between the two backstage, was 
taken by Al Roker of NBC, shown at left.  A few days later, when 
Springsteen was traveling with Obama to make a few final campaign stops,
 the President was getting a post-Sandy telephone update from Christie 
when he told the governor he had someone who wanted to talk with him, 
bringing Springsteen on the line.  “We had a good conversation today,” 
said Christie of the call.  “It was great to talk to the president and 
even better to talk to Bruce.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Campaign Resumes</strong><br>
<br>
     As the presidential race resumed in early November, the Obama 
campaign announced that Springsteen would be making more appearances at 
Obama rallies in Wisconsin, Ohio, and Iowa on November 5th, 2012, the 
day before the election.  Springsteen then appeared on that day at three
 rallies for Obama – one in Madison, Wisconsin; one in Columbus, Ohio 
with Jay-Z; and a final appearance in Des Moines, Iowa with the 
president and Michelle Obama. <br>
<br>
     Other entertainers would also appear for Obama the final weekend 
before the election – John Mellencamp, Saturday, November 3rd in Iowa; 
Dave Matthews the same day in Virginia; and Stevie Wonder on Sunday 
November 4th in Cincinnati.  Springsteen and his wife Patti, meanwhile, 
would travel with Obama on Air Force One for at least part of the tour 
on November 5th.  Reportedly, the President even remarked: “I’m going to
 be flying with Bruce Springsteen on the last day I’ll ever campaign, 
that’s not a bad way to bring it home.”<br>
<br>
     On that day, November 5th, the first of three stops was Madison, 
Wisconsin, the state capital, and home to the University of Wisconsin.  
The rally took place in the streets near the capitol building.  Some 
18,000 supporters had gathered there in the cold as early as 6:30 a.m., 
four hours before Obama would arrive.<br>
<br>
     Springsteen opened the rally with his “No Surrender” song.  Helene 
Cooper of the New York Times, reporting on the final day’s itinerary, 
noted that Obama aides, David Plouffe, David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs 
had positioned themselves atop a crane to get a better view of 
Springsteen, who also played “The Promised Land.”  Springsteen also 
added commentary between songs, saying at one point: “It’s crunch time 
now, the president’s job, our job, yours and mine – whether you’re a 
Republican, a Democrat, an independent, rich, poor, black, brown, white,
 gay, straight, soldier, civilian – is to keep that hope alive.”  
Springsteen’s final song was “Land of Hope and Dreams,” after which 
Obama came up on the stage, greeting Springsteen with a bear hug.  Obama
 had been on whirlwind cross-country jaunt of swing states and was then 
drinking warm tea in between appearances to soothe an overworked 
voicebox.  “We have come too far to turn back now…,” Obama told the 
Madison gathering.  “Now is the time to keep pushing forward.”<br>
<br>
     On the way to the next rally, in Columbus, Ohio, Springsteen sat 
with Obama aboard Air Force One as the two discussed the Hurricane Sandy
 recovery effort then underway in New Jersey.  That’s when the President
 was also speaking on the phone with Governor Chris Christie, and when 
he brought Springsteen on the line to chat briefly with the governor.<br>
<br>
 In Columbus, more than 15,000 turned out for the Obama event at the 
Nationwide Arena that included both Springsteen and rapper Jay-Z.   But 
before the two artists would perform, a series of local and state 
politicians made various introductions and short statements, including 
Columbus mayor Michael Coleman, Ohio Governor Ted Strickland, and U.S. 
Senator Sherrod Brown.  Then came Springsteen followed by Jay-Z.  
Springsteen did a short set of abridged versions of “No Surrender” and 
“The Promised Land,” as well as a campaign sing-along for the Obama 
campaign’s “Forward” slogan.  Jay-Z followed with some animated rap that
 the crowd loved, adapting his “99 Problems” song for to fit the 
President’s rival: “I got 99 problems,” he rapped, “but Mitt ain’t one…”
  Jay-Z also introduced the president in Columbus.  Obama, addressing 
the crowd, said: “Ohio, after four years, you know me by now… You may be
 frustrated with the pace of change but that’s O.K., so am I…”  Obama 
also said of Jay-Z and Springsteen that day: “Not only are they on my 
iPod – and yes, the president has an iPod – both of them tell an 
American story.” <br>
<br>
     Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, grew up in Brooklyn and had
 earlier struggles with crime, but went on become a very successful 
recording artist, music producer and wealthy businessman, marrying pop 
star Beyoncé Knowles and recently becoming a father.  During the 
Columbus rally, Obama remarked of some similarities between he and 
Jay-Z: <br>
<em class="text-italics"><br>
 “Nobody would expect us to be where we are today if they had met us as 
younger men, both of us have daughters, and both of us have wives who 
are more popular than we are.” </em><br>
<br>
 Obama also told the crowd that Jay-Z and Springsteen were examples of 
“what our country is about” – two guys who rose from humble beginnings 
to go on to fame and fortune. <br>
<br>
     Their music that day, in any case, helped bring out a diverse and 
appreciative crowd.  Karmesha Hicks, a 20-year-old student from Berea, 
Ohio attending the rally told a reporter on the way out : “It was very 
inspirational… I love that he brought two very different artists 
together.  It shows what he [Obama] is about.”<br>
<br>
     For Obama, the Columbus rally marked his 29th political appearance 
in Ohio for 2012.  The president had also done a number of taped radio 
interviews that day, dropped in for a visit at his Columbus campaign 
office, and appeared on ESPN during halftime of “Monday Night Football” 
that evening, as did Mitt Romney. <br>
<br>
     A few hours later that same day, also in Columbus,  Romney and his 
wife Ann appeared before an enthusiastic crowd in a large airport hangar
 at Port Columbus.  At that rally, the Marshall Tucker Band helped stir 
the crowd for Romney and he also had two well-known Ohio athletes speak 
there before he took the podium – ice skater Scott Hamilton and pro 
golfer Jack Nicklaus.<br>
<br>
     Back at the Obama rally at the Nationwide Arena, President Obama, 
after he gave his speech, brought Springsteen and Jay-Z back up to the 
stage (along with the prior speakers as well) for one last wave to crowd
  — this as a recorded version of “We Take Care of Our Own” played in 
the background.  Then it was on to Iowa.<br>
<br>
     According to a New York Times report, Air Force One arrived at the 
Des Moines airport at 8:59 p.m. Central Time.  This was to be Obama’s 
last campaign stop that day before going home to Chicago where he and 
his family owuld await the election returns.  His motorcade waited on 
the tarmac at Des Moines since the flight with first lady Michelle Obama
 arrived about 15 minutes later, when the president got out of his car 
to greet and hug his wife as she exited the plane.  From there, the 
motorcade made its way to downtown Des Moines where some 20,000 
supporters were waiting in a section of town lit up with floodlights for
 the event.  At about 9:30 p.m., Bruce Springsteen made his introduction
 and played ‘The Promised Land.”<br>
     He closed out his 25-minute mix of songs and commentary with “Land 
of Hope and Dreams,” finishing just before 10 p.m., when he introduced 
First Lady Michelle Obama to the crowd.  Mrs. Obama thanked the “great 
state of Iowa” for launching the Obama bid to “change the country four 
years ago” and not long thereafter, introduced her husband.<br>
<br>
     President Obama underscored the fact that it was in Des Moines 
where his campaign in 2008 really got its start.  He reminisced with the
 crowd about how his improbable bid back in the winter of 2008, with its
 upset victory over Hilary Clinton and John Edwards in the Iowa 
Democratic primary, sent him on his way. <br>
<br>
     The President teared up a bit as he recalled those days, but went 
on to give a rousing 30-minute speech, telling the crowd, “I‘ve come 
back to Iowa one more time to ask for your vote,” adding that his 
campaign would “finish where we started.” <br>
<br>
     Beyond the nostalgia, Iowa was also a key state in the President’s 
Midwestern campaign strategy.  Victories in Iowa, Wisconsin and Ohio 
would put the president over the required 270 electoral votes needed for
 reelection.<br>
<br>
     Obama was up by about five points in the state according to most of
 the Iowa polls, but his campaign was taking nothing for granted.  The 
Des Moines Register had endorsed him in 2008, but this time the leading 
Iowa newspaper had sided with Mitt Romney.  After the Iowa stop, the 
Obama campaign moved on to Chicago where, among other things, the 
President was scheduled to have a bit of exercise in a traditional 
election-day pick-up basketball game.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">November 6, 2012: Election day </strong><br>
<br>
     On election day, voter turnout was heavy in a number of states, 
with polling places extending hours in some cases as long lines had 
formed.  The ongoing tabulation of results remained close well into the 
night, with special attention focused on some seven key swing states, 
Ohio chief among them.  Sometime after 11:15 pm Eastern Time, various 
news organizations called Ohio and Iowa for President Obama, and not 
long thereafter, at about 11:30 pm, they began calling the presidential 
election for Obama.<br>
<br>
     The final election results revealed that Obama took 50.96 percent 
of the popular vote with 65,464,068 votes, while Mitt Romney had 47.31 
percent with 60,781,275 votes.  The electoral talley was 332 for Obama 
and 206 for Romney. <br>
<br>
     In the various election post-mortems of how each candidate had 
performed, there were analysts who noted the help Obama had received 
from Hollywood and music industry celebrities.  One post-election piece 
from Slate writer Ron Rosenbaum suggested that Bruce Springsteen’s 
appearances, in particular, might have played a key role in swaying 
undecided souls in key battleground states like Ohio:<br>
<br>
…Indeed, in the final days, with Bruce riding around with Obama on Air 
Force One, it was almost as though he was on the ticket, Obama’s 
spiritual VP.  Or at least ambassador from Asbury Park….  And the 
concerts and especially that song [“We Take Care of Our Own”] —the guy 
knows how to go straight for the heart, like a laser-guided drone.  He 
knows how to make you feel, for at least an instant, we could all be 
better than we are.  That’s a talent.<br>
<br>
And with the election coming down to the last minutes, the last few 
votes, it can’t be insignificant that the demographic of attendees drawn
 to Obama campaign events by all those free Bruce concerts was the heart
 of the heart of the undecided voter segment that would eventually give 
Obama the election.  After all, once you consider that Obama won Ohio by
 fewer than 2 percent, don’t try to tell me the combination of Sandy, 
Christie, and above all Bruce wasn’t the decider.  In fact the Wall 
Street Journal post-election analysis of the Ohio vote put Obama’s 
margin in swing counties in Ohio at 16,176—about the total for a couple 
of small Bruce concerts…<br>
<br>
     But Bruce Springsteen was certainly not alone among high-profile 
celebrities who helped Obama in his reelection bid.  While Springsteen 
was performing with Obama in November, for example, John Mellencamp was 
doing the same with Vice President Joe Biden an Jill Biden in Virginia.<br>
<br>
     In fact, throughout the 2012 campaign, a number of musicians helped
 Obama with concerts, rallies, and other support.  In April, the Red Hot
 Chili Peppers gave a private performance for 1,200 campaign staffers in
 Cleveland; in July, Alicia Keys headlined a rally for women voters in 
Philadelphia; and in early October, Stevie Wonder, Katy Perry, Jon Bon 
Jovi and Jennifer Hudson all performed at a campaign event in Los 
Angeles.  Dave Matthews performed at an Obama rally in Bristow, Virginia
 and also in Aurora, Colorado.  In North Carolina, James Taylor 
undertook an eight-show tour on behalf of Obama, and Pearl Jam’s Eddie 
Vedder appeared at a $20,000-per-ticket fund-raiser in Tampa, Florida.<br>
<br>
     Beyond the musicians and high-profile endorsers at campaign rallies
 there was also the matter of campaign money.  Lots of celebrities from 
Hollywood and the broader entertainment industry gave generously to the 
Obama campaign and related Political Action Committees (PACs).  
According to a review of federal election documents by OpenSecrets.org, 
run by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, more than 200 
celebrities donated a total of some $712,000 to Obama’s re-election bid 
in the 2012 campaign cycle.  Among these donors were, for example: Tom 
Hanks, Magic Johnson, Ben Stiller, Eva Longoria, Will Smith, Scarlett 
Johansson, Barbara Streisand, Aaron Sorkin, Steven Spielberg, Gwen 
Stefani, Quentin Tarantino, Melanie Griffith, Quincy Jones, Cameron 
Crowe, Don Henley, Ellen DeGeneres, Nancy Sinatra, Jack Black, Jamie 
Foxx, Randy Newman, Jennifer Garner, Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert Downey 
Jr., Mariska Hargitay, Jamie Lee Curtis, Marlo Thomas, John Legend, 
Emmylou Harris, Sam Waterston, and others.  Another 90 or so celebrities
 donated to DNC Services Corp., the Democratic National Committee.  Five
 celebrities, including Morgan Freeman and Bill Maher, donated $1 
million each to Priorities USA Action, a super PAC supporting Obama.  
Among “bundlers” for Obama from Hollywood – those who pull together 
multiple donations in one bundle – were Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks
 Animation, Obama’s top bundler, pulling together some $2.3 million in 
donations, and Barry and Wendy Meyer of Warner Brothers, bundling $1.9 
million.   <br>
<br>
     Actor George Clooney hosted a fundraiser at his Los Angeles home in
 May 2012 that Obama attended which raised over $15 million.  In August,
 the president attended a fundraiser on Long Island, New York hosted by 
movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, actress Anne Hathaway, Vogue editor Anna 
Wintour, and filmmaker Aaron Sorkin.  Actresses Julianne Moore and Sarah
 Jessica Parker also hosted separate fundraisers for the president in 
2012.  In September, Jay-Z and Beyoncé hosted a $40,000-per-seat 
Manhattan fundraiser for the president at Jay-Z’s 40/40 club.  Jay-Z 
also released a campaign video for Obama in October, and as noted above,
 campaigned with Bruce Springsteen and the president in Columbus, Ohio. 
 Other celebrities made pro-Obama videos that circulated on the web, 
including Will Ferrell, Cher, and Kathy Griffin.  Morgan Freeman 
narrated a pro-Obama campaign ad.  Still, this is not a full accounting 
of all the campaign assistance the Obama effort received from actors, 
musicians, playwrights, professional athletes, and other celebrities.<br>
<br>
     Romney and the Republicans had their share of celebrities too.  
Detroit musician Kid Rock performed at Romney rallies and the Romney 
campaign used Rock’s “Born Free” song as one of its regular campaign 
anthems for much of 2012.  Randy Owen, the lead singer of the group 
Alabama, and Johnny Van Zant, frontman for Lynyrd Skynyrd, also endorsed
 Romney, as did country music star Trace Adkins, who performed at 
campaign rallies for Romney.  John Elway, former quarterback for the 
Denver Broncos, endorsed Romney in Colorado a few days before the first 
debate.  Donnie and Marie Osmond were Romney supporters, as was Gene 
Simmons of the rock group Kiss.  Actors Jon Voight, Kelsey Grammar, 
Robert Duvall, Check Norris and Jeff Foxworthy endorsed Romney too, as 
did Clint Eastwood, famously, at the Republican National Convention.<br>
Obama out-raised Romney by nearly 5-to-1 among donors from the “TV/ movies/music” segment.<br>
  Cindy Crawford appeared in a video on behalf of Romney, and comedian 
Dennis Miller and former pro golfer Jack Nicklaus also endorsed the 
Republican candidate.<br>
<br>
     But in terms of celebrity campaign donations, Romney had a 
relatively small share of the Hollywood/ music industry money pot, 
receiving some $46,500 from donors including: playwright Neil Simon, 
Olympic figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi, actor Orson Bean, producer Jerry
 Bruckheimer, professional football player Peyton Manning, and World 
Wrestling Entertainment CEO Vince McMahon and his wife, Linda, a 
Republican candidate herself, then running for the U.S. Senate seat in 
Connecticut being vacated by retiring Sen. Joe Lieberman.  The McMahons 
were also among those donating to Restore Our Future, a conservative 
super PAC backing Romney’s bid.  And the Republican National Committee 
picked up $78,886 from celebrity donors who included the McMahons, Jerry
 Bruckheimer, singer Pat Boone, New York Yankee baseball star, Alex 
Rodriguez, and others.  But over the 2010-2012 election cycle, according
 to one count, Obama out-raised Romney by nearly a 5-to-1 margin among 
donors from the “TV/ movies/music” segment, receiving roughly $4.5 
million in donations from that group compared to something under $1 
million for the Romney campaign.<br>
<br>
  But Bruce Springsteen, because of his following in the swing-state and
 rust-belt Midwest – and also among working-class voters broadly – 
appears to have played a more-than-normal celebrity role in the final 
weeks of the 2012 election.  And perhaps for that reason alone, his 
front-page notice in the Washington Post and a few other newspapers on 
election day was right on target.  But Springsteen has also shown 
himself to be one of the more thoughtful celebrities when he does become
 involved in political campaigning, not entering the fray lightly.  In 
2004, when he decided to take up the cause for John Kerry, he wrote an 
Op-Ed piece in the New York Times explaining his views on the candidate.
  And he has also used his website to post longer statements explaining 
his political views and the backing of particular candidates.  But for 
most of his fans – Democrat, Republican, or Independent – his message is
 already transparent in his music, which normally conveys a determined, 
though sometimes angry but usually hopeful, American patriotism.</div>

On this day 35 years ago: Bruce Springsteen's first show at Newcastle City Hall<br>
Newcaste Chronicle<br>
<br>
11 MAY 2016<br>
BY DAVID MORTON</strong><br>
    <br>
<br>
Newcastle City Hall has played host to the world’s greatest rock acts and staged many unforgettable shows.<br>
<br>
The Beatles, the Stones, David Bowie, Elton John, The Who, Led Zep and many more have graced the legendary venue.<br>
<br>
One concert that stands out took place on this day 35 years ago.<br>
<br>
If Bruce Springsteen’s later show at St James’ Park in June 1985 would 
attain iconic status, The Boss’s electrifying appearance at the City 
Hall on May 11, 1981 was the first time North East fans set eyes on him.<br>
<br>
On tour to promote his latest album, The River, this was Bruce’s first 
UK appearance since a pair of low-key shows at Hammersmith Odeon in 
1975.<br>
<br>
Backed by his formidable E Street Band - including Clarence Clemons 
(sax), Max Weinberg (drums) and Steve Van Zandt (guitar) - Springsteen 
tore through a classic set list.<br>
<br>
Kicking off with an Elvis Presley cover, Follow That Dream, the American
 singer delivered numbers like Hungry Heart, Darkness On The Edge Of 
Town, Thunder Road and Born To Run and with remarkable energy.<br>
<br>
Later, Springsteen would cite the Newcastle City Hall concert as one of 
the best three shows of a mammoth tour that stretched to around 140 
dates.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Peter Brennan, manager of the City Hall, would tell the 
Chronicle in 2011: “I have been here for 30 years and still to this day 
it is the best concert we’ve had at City Hall. Nothing has matched it.<br>
<br>
“Some have come close but there’s been nothing as good. I got to watch the concert and marvel at the man.”<br>
<br>
Rock on, Bruce...</div>

Philip Norman, Daily Mail, 2002<br>

ROCK MUSIC in its 50-year history has inspired many degrees of love, 
adulation and awe. Yet among the ranks of legends and superstars, only 
two have received titles setting them beyond all comparison and 
competition for ever. There was Elvis Presley, 'the King', and there is 
Bruce Springsteen, 'the Boss'.<br>
<br>
Springsteen plays Wembley Arena on October 27 as part of an integrated 
American/European tour bigger than any he has undertaken since his 
mid-80s glory days. It follows the worldwide success of his last album, 
The Rising, which re-established Springsteen as the most dynamic living 
rock performer and renewed his claim to be America's foremost modern 
folk poet.<br>
<br>
The Rising is Springsteen's commentary on the holocaust of September 11,
 2001 – perhaps the most powerful yet in any medium. His music has 
always celebrated the dignity, resilience and potential for heroism in 
America's blue collar class. On that engulfingly dark day, the valour of
 New York's firefighters, rescue workers and ordinary people in the 
street justified his faith many times over.<br>
<br>
Released in July, The Rising also gave heartening proof that the pop 
audience is not irredeemably hooked on motormouth rappers and 
plastic-smiling Britney clones. In its first week, it sold more than 
half a million copies in the US alone and went straight to number 1 on 
the Billboard magazine chart as well as in Britain and across Europe.<br>
<br>
In rock, the cerebral rarely co-exists with the physical. Indeed, 
performers of intellectual weight usually tend to be rather 
underwhelming live onstage.<br>
<br>
John Lennon was never an exciting performer, racked as he so often was 
by self-consciousness or self-loathing. Bob Dylan can be wonderful in 
one show, hopeless in the next. But Springsteen combines the 
sensibilities of a poet with a superpowered energy that could make Mick 
Jagger, even James Brown gasp. This ultimate superstar remains utterly a
 man of the people with his shabby jeans and simple plaid shirt, his 
guitar no grander than a scrap of driftwood. 'King' Elvis may have had 
his monarchical tantrums, but with the Boss there are no 'off' nights. 
Everyone leaves his concerts in the same condition, their blood aflame, 
walking on air.<br>
<br>
I have an odd little personal Boss anedcote. In 1975, when I was The 
Times's rock critic, a record company PR sent me an early pressing of 
what was to become Springsteen's breakthrough single, 'Born To Run'. It 
was – and remains – an enthralling concoction, mixing the parodic energy
 of Punk with hommages to Fifties rock 'n' roll, street-corner do-wop, 
Phil Spector's 'Wall of Sound' and Marlon Brando's The Wild Ones. 
Springsteen had just arrived in Britain for his first tour, but the PR 
was having problems in getting him any media coverage whatever. Would I,
 as a special favour, spend the day with him?<br>
<br>
We met in a Knightsbridge coffee shop. Springsteen then did not have his
 later cleancut, boyish look: he was bearded, black-leathered and 
faintly sinister. We discovered common ground in both having grown up in
 shabby seaside resorts, I on the Isle of Wight, he in Asbury Park, New 
Jersey. He also recalled his years as a jobbing guitarist, playing 
back-up to Chuck Berry who, perversely, would do everything possible to 
throw the band off course. 'We used to ask him "What songs are we going 
to play tonight?" He'd just smile and say "we're gonna play some Chuck 
Berry songs".' At the time, I remember, we were strolling through 
Harrods menswear department, where Springsteen paused to try on some 
balaclava helmets, in those days considered suitable wear only for 
Christmas carol-singers.<br>
<br>
It was after that first British tour that the scruffy troubadour from 
the Asbury Park boardwalk became the most over-hyped rock star even 
America had ever known. In one unreal week, his face adorned the cover 
of both Time and Newsweek magazines, a feat rarely managed by the 
President himself. This in turn brought on a wrangle between managers 
and record companies which effectively took Springsteen out of 
circulation for something like three years.<br>
<br>
It was not until the early Eighties that he came into his own at last, 
with albums like The River and Darkness at the Edge of Town that 
celebrated the American working man and spoke for the outcast and 
disenfranchised as no one had since John Steinbeck's great Depression 
novel, The Grapes of Wrath. It was unashamedly music for 'guys', but 
decent, loving, aspirational guys rather than the self-obsessed, vacuous
 nerds of Britain's subsequent lad 'movement'. Its piledriving 
simplicity and optimism tapped into an old American vein, perfectly 
expressing a nation that had just begun to feel good about itself again 
after the variegated humiliations of Vietnam, Watergate and the Iran 
hostage crisis.<br>
<br>
Its apotheosis was the 1984 album Born In the USA which sold 12 million 
copies, stayed on the British album charts for more than two years and 
saw Springsteen all but hijacked as a mouthpiece for the block-headed 
presidency of Ronald Reagan. 'Born In The USA' was to become a hymn of 
unthinking, beery patriotism second only to The 'Star-Spangled Banner'; 
in reality it was a good old Sixties-style protest song, expressing the 
disillusionment of Vietnam veterans at their treatment on their return 
home.<br>
<br>
Likewise, the elegaic 'Streets of Philadelphia' was the first and most powerful anthem to suffers from AIDS.<br>
<br>
After our Harrods visit, I never met Springsteen again and saw him in 
concert only once more – but unforgettably. It was during his 1984 Born 
In The USA tour, at New York's Dodger Stadium. More even than his music,
 I remember his extended chat with his 50,000-odd audience that somehow 
made each and every one of us feel like a personal friend, sharing a hot
 dog with him on the Asbury Park boardwalk. 'I hope you have a wonderful
 life', were his almost fatherly closing words. My companion that night,
 a hard-boiled London publisher, left the stadium with stars visible in 
her eyes. 'It's an amazing feeling,' she said, 'to fall in love with a 
rock star again.'<br>
<br>
Though pop fashions since the Eighties have come and gone by the 
million, there has been no serious pretender to Springsteen's homespun 
crown. Now 52 and married to his former backing singer, Patti Scialfa, 
he lives quietly with their three children on a farm in Monmouth County,
 New Jersey, still firmly resisting all efforts to drag him into 
conventional politics. In one American writer's apt phrase, he is a 
'slumbering volcano': you know that, whenever it comes, the eruption 
will be Vesuvian.<br>
<br>
This present tour also sees the Boss reunited with his famous E Street 
Band, including Clarence Clemons, the most influential 'chicken sax' 
player since Boots Randolph, and guitarist 'Miami' Steve Van Zandt. 
Wembley concert-goers have been warned to expect 'at least a three-hour 
set'. They can rest assured that not a minute will be wasted</div>
