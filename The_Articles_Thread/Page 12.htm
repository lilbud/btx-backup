				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: The Springsteen Syndrome<br>
<br>
Paul Morley, NME, 6 October 1979<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Musicians United For Safe Energy: Madison Square Garden, NYC</strong><br>
<br>
THERE'S A puzzling ritual that goes with a Bruce Springsteen performance
 in America, particularly on the east coast where Springsteen's 
popularity is well established.<br>
<br>
During, before and after his show there will rise a low, moaning cry of 
affection or yearning, seemingly out of the collected mouths of the 
audience, yet no mouths appear to move.<br>
<br>
The noise sounds like a considered jeer – of derision or distaste. In 
fact, it's believers, and they're saying, to themselves almost, BRUCE; 
and they're saying it deep and lovingly and it's a funny, patient form 
of adoration. Religious, almost.<br>
<br>
BROOOOOOCE they go. BOOOOOO I hear. So does Bonnie Raitt.<br>
<br>
For the first time in ten years there is an issue of concern that is 
gripping Americans and giving a focus to their vague, suppressed 
feelings of discontent and confusion: the Jane Fondas and Ralph Naders 
are expertly voicing the complaints, but they're not the only ones. A 
new group of effective popular agitators are joining them on their 
platforms.<br>
<br>
Separated from the Vietnam resentment by the phantom, embarrassing 
Watergate bubble is the equally outraged cry against the establishment 
of Nuclear Reactors; a stubborn stand against the development of nuclear
 power that is gaining passionate nationwide approval.<br>
<br>
The nickname for the movement is Anti-Nuke. Cute.<br>
<br>
The movement has touched enough people, and stung them into activity, 
that for a demonstration against continuing nuclear activity held on a 
Sunday in New York 200,000 people turned up. But a few years ago, it was
 only a small if widespread movement, simply a collection of unambitious
 consumer groups that kept their demands to the government comparatively
 moderate. They wanted restrictions, and solid guarantees of safety.<br>
<br>
Since the recent Harrisburg incident indicated the potential hazards of 
nuclear activity to an already frightened and vulnerable American 
public, the movement has grown considerably and it's demands have become
 uncompromising.<br>
<br>
It requests the absolute abolition of nuclear power as a source of energy.<br>
<br>
The arguments are blurred, the commitment total, the alternatives 
offered idealistic and folksy. But how is rock'n'roll doing in 
supporting the anger and annoyance?<br>
<br>
The rock'n'roll that Rolling Stone still treats sensitively (James 
Taylor on the cover?), that gets played by the radio, that is taken to 
be radical, is established and accepted enough to be able to make 
serious political gestures. Linda Ronstadt as First Lady? Senator Dave 
Crosby?<br>
<br>
As they age and moult, American rock people are drifting into political 
arenas with definite ambitions, and the Anti-Nuke movement emphasises 
this bittersweet trend. That Jackson Browne and Graham Nash are again 
having positive effects in influencing thoughts and attitudes signifies 
how powerful 'rock'n'roll' can be and also how impassive, easy going and
 conservative the people who gain the position and power have become.<br>
<br>
It's interesting to see what role Rock Against Racism has taken in America.<br>
<br>
Despite obvious and hopeless race problems, where it has managed to 
surface RAR aims for the very core of the deceptive, disturbing 
anti-freedom of the American way of life; to eat away there. Their rally
 cries include "If you're tired of homogenized monotony polluting the 
airwaves...if you're fed up with the way things are and with being told 
to let it be...if you believe that Mother Earth is for everyone...if 
you're ready to switch off the '70s and face the '80s...LETS ROCK 
AGAINST RACISM!"<br>
<br>
This is forward thinking and realistic politics.<br>
<br>
To the supporters of Anti-Nuke such indignation is alien; they probably 
notice nothing wrong with the radio, and have only become worked up and 
alarmed when faced with something that threatens to directly interfere 
with their comfort.<br>
<br>
The new American rock'n'roll establishment have willingly involved 
themselves with the hysteria that's greeted the first noticeable and 
'nasty' problem that's faced the States these last few years, and that's
 despite the existence of everyday problems and values that have pushed 
America into the bland and self-deluding state that it's in today. 
Because of their ignorance, they added to those traumas. Now they 
naively sail on their ego trips to the centre of an issue that will 
sustain their illusions of rebellion and concern.<br>
<br>
A handful of this new rock establishment got together to promote a five 
day series of concerts at Madison Square Gardens featuring many stars 
you thought were dead: Musicians United For Safe Energy (MUSE) would 
gather the proceeds from the concerts, and from the inevitable albums 
and films. Strict organisation was determined to make the series a 
profit making venture.<br>
<br>
The concerts featured Jesse Colin Young, Poco, Doobie Brothers, Jackson 
Browne, Crosby Stills and Nash, John Hall, James Taylor; smart people. 
Clash were asked to do the Sunday show with Crosby Stills and Nash...to 
add a slash of feeling to the proceedings. They immediately agreed to 
play if they could go on after CS&amp;N. If this had been greeted with 
an affirmative (some chance) then the next request was that they would 
only play if the ticket price was a dollar. That would have been a 
reduction of 17 dollars.<br>
<br>
I clambered my way into Madison Square Gardens for the Saturday show, 
featuring Gil Scott Heron (who I missed as I slid up escalators and 
plucked up the courage to enter the forbidding arena), Peter Tosh, 
Bonnie Raitt, Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's involvement was curious.<br>
<br>
Of all the participants he was the most obviously alive, the most 
obviously rock'n'roll. Someone who is, like all the few great Americans,
 aware and scornful of the USA predicament; one whose values correspond 
closely to the American RAR ones. On Saturday his presence and vitality 
separated his performance so decisively from the supports that it was 
like a separate concert.<br>
<br>
Peter Tosh is a successful 'reggae' entertainer in a nation where many 
radio stations still refuse to play black music of committed intention. 
His set was sluggish and slow, and it had to be soft around the edges 
for people to lap it up. Perfectly palatable; unthreatening.<br>
<br>
Bonnie Raitt told everyone they could get up and dance if they wanted to. "But don't get too outrageous."<br>
<br>
Her set was a contented, relaxed mix of flawless technique and tickles 
through country, soul, rock, R&amp;B; styles sticking out all over the 
place, nothing interesting. Jackson Browne and Graham Nash simpered on 
stage to smooth their way through a grim ballad, receiving incongruous 
roars and teeny screams.<br>
<br>
The one moment of anger was during Raitt's set when the audience were mooing through their ritual.<br>
<br>
BROOOOOOCE they went. BOOOOOO I heard. So did Bonnie Raitt.<br>
<br>
"I came on last night to introduce an act," she said, "and I heard you 
doing that and I thought you were booing. And I thought anyone who can 
pay 18 dollars for a ticket and then come and boo must be mad!"<br>
<br>
BROOOOOOCE they went; with maybe a few BOOOOOOS.<br>
<br>
"That's right," Bonnie snarled, "get it out of your system."<br>
<br>
Around this time I was beginning to wonder what was the most boring concert I'd ever seen.<br>
<br>
The most exciting thing was wondering who was to come on next. Eagles? 
Doobies? Dooley's? It was Tom Petty. With his Heartbreakers. I was 
momentarily stimulated by the sound of hard guitars and the sight of old
 fashioned posing, but I soon slumbered back into a daze as Petty 
revealed limited imagination and understanding. The audience response 
was negative and automatic; I sulked.<br>
<br>
The audience seemed to be building up to bring Petty back for more, but as soon as Petty departed cheers turned to...<br>
<br>
BROOOOOOCE!<br>
<br>
The lights came up for the first time that evening. It seemed like the 
concert was over. In a way, that one was – the boring Anti-Nuke part, 
that typified the blank, slick, comforting American (rock) nature, even 
in moments of apparent distress.<br>
<br>
BROOOOOOCE!<br>
<br>
It was Springsteen's birthday. It was the first day of the Jewish New 
Year. It was a show that made me understand why so many Americans place 
so much faith in the man who has suffered such a bewildering series of 
highs and lows without ever coming close to establishing the fame to 
equal his rich and thrilling reputation. He has purpose and enthusiasm, 
and whilst essentially unadventurous, he is the one American who 
continues the rock'n'roll tradition so convincingly, sensually, 
innovatively, hauntingly, and...traditionally.<br>
<br>
The more intriguing new American rock people – Talking Heads, Pere Ubu –
 distort, parody, reinterpret rock traditions. They travel in zigzag 
lines. The meekest new American rock people – Cars, Knack – paste over 
rock's raw edges and add nothing new. They don't travel at all.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen shoots out in a straight line. Traditional enough, but
 with that, vitally contemporary. He is aware, with such ravishing and 
reckless sensitivity, of rock'n'roll's power and potential, of the 
essence of its communication.<br>
<br>
There is nothing confusing about Bruce Springsteen, but that doesn't 
mean nothing stimulating. He is a desperate and spirited entertainer who
 succeeds because he is so possessive and anxious.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is a rock'n'roll puritan; somehow a hedonist too. He has strict values, but he's one hell of an extrovert.<br>
<br>
He knows that rock'n'roll has to be show business; that it is poetry; 
that it must reach and move; that there has to be response. Only the 
very cynical can find fault with his simplistic desires, his respect and
 his delight.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is not the greatest thing in the world; but he's not softening anybody up.<br>
<br>
Springsteen slouched around the stage like a youthfully revitalised 
Colombo. Took gulps of breath between songs, greedily. His clothes fit 
him perfectly; things like this matter. He flung a carefully prepared 
birthday cake way back into the audience. He grimaced and grunted, posed
 and played mock-exhausted. Despite his urgency, there's an air of 
patience about him; He takes his time. And as he does...<br>
<br>
BROOOOOOCE!<br>
<br>
His set was a romanticised interpretation of an ideal rock'n'roll show. 
But however corny or crass he was, he was also bewitching and ecstatic. 
He knows that there are so many things to be balanced – to impress the 
feeling without trivialising – as he did magnificently on a new song, 
'The River', where his control after all his racy athletics were superb –
 to indulge, show off and still be able to inspire.<br>
<br>
He works hard. He's an exhibitionist like few others. What he went out 
of his way to do was make sure everyone in the huge Madison Square 
Gardens knew that he was the centre of attraction. Music came second to 
the physical exertion.<br>
<br>
My lasting impression of the show is not the music – of which I remember
 little – but the swells of melodrama, subtle drops in pressure, its 
dirty edge. Of Springsteen maniacally rushing around, off, over and down
 to the side of the stage, charging round the back of the amplifiers to 
play to the people sitting there, clambering over the amplifiers, on 
top, clapping his hands, grinning his head off.<br>
<br>
Every part of the arena got a long stare from Springsteen.<br>
<br>
Somewhere amidst all this he sang some lines, uneven, strained, lustful.
 After a verse or two, off he'd rush, slide to the front of the stage, 
dash to the side, up on top of an amp; yearning, urging, fighting, 
laughing.<br>
<br>
When his perfect foil, the large white suited Clarence Clemons, stepped 
forward to drop a slight, sleazy solo into the thick sound, applause was
 generous. But Springsteen never ducked out of sight.<br>
<br>
Concerts are for brutally attracting; records are for influencing; two 
different forms of communication. Springsteen knows his balances. A 
showman and a moodman, he teases and he confronts.<br>
<br>
At New York, he wound himself up so excitably, sang so forcefully, 
non-converts were forced to find out just what causing it all. I've got a
 lot of records to catch up on.<br>
<br>
Traditional man; new values. An American folk hero that can mean 
something over here. Someone who loves himself and hates himself. A 
performer who can fling his guitar around his back, stand with his wiry 
legs just a couple of feet apart, twist slightly to watch what his 
bassman is doing, bare his teeth and be more rock'n'roll than anything I
 can think of.<br>
<br>
Good or bad? Depends what you're looking for. When, if he comes to 
Britain, don't expect too much, but go look at the shadows. Go see him 
running around in his cage.<br>
<br>
"I'm a prisoner of rock'n'roll."<br>
<br>
And not afraid to act the fool with it.<br>

<br>
Sandy Robertson, Sounds, 5 January 1980<br>
<br>
MUST BE some new kind of drug or somethin', 'cos even a 16-year-old 
don't do a graveyard shift of four hours and then dance on the piano, 
let alone some old reprobate who only just ditched that scrubby face 
fuzz, y'know, some New Jersey geezer who I'd always thought of as an 
amped-up folksinger with funky sneakers and a sloppy line in 
self-mythologising.<br>
<br>
But, and here my heart conceded utterly, those moonlighting compadres 
back at the Jap hotel with their beer-bellies and tetracycline and 
jockey shorts had told the truth when they'd encouraged me to act the 
low hoodlum and spend a weekend of discomfort, one guy checked in and 
the other four interlopers surreptitiously on the floor after hours, 
slugging rootbeer and sharing damp Chinese cheeseburgers from the dive 
across the street. "You havta see the guy to understand".<br>
<br>
Eyeballing the battered bootleg before me (so many people have borrowed 
it) I remember the drizzle in the San Francisco night. God, did I feel 
bad, think it was the 'flu or maybe even an unknown disease, stiff neck 
and throbbing temples, exacerbated by interruption of sleep when the 
doped-out potheads had to get back into the hotel room at 3 am after 
chatting up the black girls down the hall. December 1978 at the 
Winterland was the scene of two of the best gigs I've ever witnessed, in
 spite of the necessity of having to stand amid masses of swaying 
hippies and clouds of intoxicating smoke if you wanted to see anything. 
Bruce Springsteen And The E Street Band; who else would they make a 
triple album bootleg of? Who else would have two biographies written on 
him after only four official record releases? I found out why they call 
him 'The Boss'.<br>
<br>
I NEVER needed another Bob Dylan, not having had much time for the first
 one, so when I started copping eyefuls of all these Zimmerman 
comparisons, circa '73 when Greetings From Asbury Park NJ was released, I
 was more than a little dubious about Bruce Springsteen. Until I decided
 to write this piece, I'd never actually sat down and listened to the 
thing all the way through, but I find it was worth the effort. Some 
fellow squat-dweller in my poverty period of two years ago used to 
bombard the cracked plaster near Ladbroke Grove with any Loose 
Windscreen he could find, but all I could hear in my punk rock haze was a
 guy with a moan for a voice bumbling on in a very un-rock'n'roll 
fashion about 'Madman drummers bummers/and Indians in the Summer/With a 
teenage diplomat', and getting nowhere fast. It seemed like another case
 of sensory overload, a shabby Catholic boy learns how to make a song 
read like a rhyming dictionary and thinks he's seen God. 'Blinded By The
 Light'? I wasn't buying.<br>
<br>
Of course, I couldn't have known the problems that the blaze and noise 
boy was going through at the time. Springsteen grew up in Freehold, New 
Jersey, son of Adele and Douglas Springsteen, a sporadic interest in 
rock'n'roll blossoming into his tenures with The Castiles, a pop/rock 
outfit, and later Steel Mill, an almost-success of a heavy metal nature.
 Following that, he tried to assemble a larger band with horns and so 
on, but when that didn't work out he decided to go solo. When the 
fledgling genius was introduced to a couple of music biz hustlers named 
Mike Apel and Jim Cretecos, they freaked. In their eyes a star was born,
 so in early '72 the abrasive Appel managed to secure Springsteen an 
audition with John Hammond at CBS, the man who had signed Dylan to the 
label. Hammond inked the lad, in spite of manager Appel apparently being
 incredibly abusive to him before he'd ever been allowed to hear two 
bars of Springsteen's music. Then-supremo Clive Davis was in agreement, 
it was a green light situation.<br>
<br>
Springsteen roped in a bunch of old sidekicks from burnt-out beach-town 
Asbury, and the album was waxed in three weeks at 914 Sound Studios, an 
allegedly inadequate facility owned by MOR producer Brooks Arthur. 
Trouble was old Bruce didn't even know what a producer was at this 
point, and Appel and Cretecos were doing the honours with their eye on 
some upbeat folk market of their own imagining. Rock'n'roll was shouted 
down, resulting in a thin sound and an unsatisfying record. Still, in 
retrospect 'Blinded By The Light' and 'Growin' Up' are fine songs, if 
overly verbose, though the stereo must be cranked up to eviction level 
before one gets the message.<br>
<br>
CBS amplified the Dylan connection and it backfired. Then, oblivious to 
the need to let the boy rock'n'roll in context, they put him out as 
support on a tour with Chicago. That didn't do anybody any good, so from
 then on Springsteen only did shows on his own, which proved difficult 
to arrange for an unknown act. The loudmouthed Appel gave everybody at 
CBS a hard time, which made people in the company pissed off with the 
whole ball game. It was second LP time.<br>
<br>
The Wild, The Innocent And The E Street Shuffle was recorded under 
virtually the same conditions as the first disc, with mostly the same 
musos. It got many rave reviews, as did the live Springsteen shows, but 
flopped miserably. A lot of folks in the know thought that Bruce would 
be dropped by CBS, especially since Clive Davis had just been ousted as 
top man. Springsteen was a contender for the last-year's-thing award. 
But nobody'd reckoned with the power of the press.<br>
<br>
GENERALLY, in America rock journalists don't mean shit. Jon Landau is 
one of the few exceptions, the most respected writer in the industry; 
when he was a full-time critic what was said was released. He also 
produced some sterliing stuff, including the MC5 classic album, Back In 
The USA. On his 27th birthday Landau saw his second Bruce Springsteen 
show, in Boston-Cambridge, one of Bruce's areas of high popularity. He 
went home and wrote a eulogy that was to become as legendary as its 
subject. Feeling older and unwell, Landau talked in his piece for The 
Real Paper (a Boston rag) of his disillusionment with music. "But 
tonight there is someone I can write of the way I used to write, without
 reservations of any kind. Last Thursday at Harvard Square Theatre, I 
saw my rock and roll past flash before my eyes. And I saw something 
else: I saw rock and roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen".<br>
<br>
Perhaps the greatest quote of all time, certainly the most remembered, 
in rock crit terms. CBS used it in ads, got enthusiastic, other critics 
joined in. It was now nearly a year since the second LP and there was a 
lot of pressure on Springsteen to at last come up with the goods on 
record. He'd lost his drummer, Boom Carter (who himself had replaced 
Vini Lopez) and keyboard-player David Sancious. A newspaper ad brought 
replacements Roy Bittan on piano and Max Weinberg on drums. Eventually, 
The Wild, The Innocent And The E Street Shuffle had done OK, but a new 
record was needed. Born To Run it was called, and its creation turned 
out to be an agony for everyone concerned.<br>
<br>
Springsteen was incredibly indecisive in the studio, labouring over 
every detail in an attempt to get it right at last, trying every 
variation possible on each song. Sessions were moved from 914 Sound to 
the Record Plant, and Landau was called in to co-produce. During the 
sessions, Miami Steve Van Zandt from Southside Johnny And The Asbury 
Jukes was added as guitar player after he solved a particularly 
difficult problem regarding how a horn part should be arranged. When 
Born To Run was issued in October '75 it was two years since the world 
had heard from Springsteen.<br>
<br>
Nobody was disappointed. At last the New Jersey kid had made a 
rock'n'roll album that approached the magnificence of the live shows, 
one which honed the power of his convoluted verbals to make them all the
 more striking. Springsteen's fantasy vision of an American suburbia 
full of alienated, near-beaten souls trying for that one make-or-break 
last chance at heroism (in a sense paralleled by the man's own career at
 this point) has never been more succinctly stated than in the song 
'Born To Run' itself.<br>
<br>
It seems that wordsmith Landau provided Springsteen with an editorial 
function, though the title track, ironically, would appear to be the one
 thing on the record that Landau didn't work on. It's undoubtedly 
Springsteen's best known tune; some have criticised it as being muddy, 
but it's four-and-a-half minutes that feels like 30 seconds, surely the 
mark of greatness. An insanely simple but hauntingly effective guitar 
riff is not quite drowned in an explosion of Spectorish drums (Boom 
Carter's only, I think, recorded work with the band) and surging 
keyboard. It's the song that ties all the elements together, the 
obsession with cars, for instance. 'At night we ride through mansions of
 glory in suicide machines', he states. Even back in 'Growin' Up', when 
describing what sounds like some naive psychedelic experience, he wryly 
assured us that she swears he 'found the key to the universe in the 
engine of an old parked car'.<br>
<br>
Who else bar Roger Christian could see truth in a fuel-injection system?
 Otherwise, the song is a delirious synthesis of every trashy noise (and
 every mangificent one, too) that the adolescent Springsteen must've 
heard on his radio. What finally makes it is the passion with which it's
 sung. Springsteen was the first artist in umpteen years to sound as if 
he actually cared about something. When he roars 'I'll love you with all
 the madness in my soul', you believe he's talking about something real.<br>
<br>
So it did very well, and so did the tour. The phenomenon found himself 
on the covers of Time and Newsweek on the same day. He came to England 
and played at Hammersmith, but CBS went over the top with posters 
stating that 'At Last London Is Ready For Bruce Springsteen', which 
Bruce hated so much that he spent some time tearing them down. Under one
 ad some wag inscribed the words "if not, CBS has blown the entire 
year's promo budget". Worldwide, detractors screamed "hype". Overall, 
the tour had been successful, but it had lost some money because 
Springsteen didn't want to play stadiums. And there were other problems.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN had originally signed his contract with Laurel Canyon, Mike 
Appel's company, on the hood of a car in a dark parking lot in New 
Jersey, without even reading it. The contract was iniquitous in the 
extreme and Appel tried to renegotiate it before it was up, offering as 
inducement to give Springsteen half of a 500,000 dollar advance he'd 
gotten from CBS. To make it worse, Springsteen found that he didn't own 
the rights to his own songs and that he was in a rather dire position 
fianancially to boot. After much wrangling things went to court.<br>
<br>
There were two distinct problems. In July 76 Springsteen filed suit in 
Federal court alleging fraud, breach of trust and undue influence. Two 
days later, Appel filed suit in Supreme court in an attempt to prevent 
Springsteen recording with Landau. The details of the claims and counter
 claims could almost fill a book (see Dave Marsh's 90% excellent Bom To 
Run, don't see Peter Gambaccini's 100% awful quicky tome), but after 
months a settlement was reached out of court. Bruce got his songs and 
Appel got money. Landau and Springsteen began recording Darkness On The 
Edge Of Town in June '77. It took a year to finish, for the ususal 
Springsteen reasons. He even delayed it because the colour of the sleeve
 photo wasn't to his liking.<br>
<br>
Well I recall listening to a tape of Darkness smuggled out of the 
pressing plant days before its release, people crowding round a stereo 
somewhere in Hollywood. Springsteen's concerns hadn't changed, but 
they'd lost all vestiges of fantasy. On songs like 'Badlands' and 
'Racing In The Street' he was dealing with the reality of life rather 
than some idealised method of escape. In 'Prove It All Night' he sings 
'...if dreams came true, oh, wouldn't that be nice/But this ain't no 
dream we're living through tonight/Girl, you want it, you take it, you 
pay the price'.<br>
<br>
I still had to see those two shows in December of last year before I got
 the message. Springsteen gives songs to others that sound like oldies 
('Because The Night' to Patti Smith, 'Hearts Of Stone' to Southside, 
'Fire' to Robert Gordon, 'Don't Look Back' to The Knack) and plays 
oldies like 'Devil With The Blue Dress' and 'Rave On' as if they were 
his own. As Weinberg and bassist Garry Tallent underpin the package, 
Bittan's piano decorates like the fairy lights round the stage on 'Santa
 Claus Is Coming To Town', while Van Zandt and organist Danny Federici 
flesh out the bones. Accomplished musicians, yes, but they never sound 
bored.<br>
<br>
Against this backdrop, Springsteen plays guitar like his beloved Dick 
Dale(!), his prowess on that instrument, in terms of insanely emotional 
ferocity, being something he's never been given much credit for. He runs
 around the stage, colliding with gigantic (or so he appears) sax player
 Clarence Clemons, telling stories. It's rock'n'roll as theatre, but 
it's done without benefit of smoke bombs or tedious special effects.<br>
<br>
It becomes immediately obvious upon seeing this man perform why he 
appeals to oldsters, punks, indeed to anybody who ever loved rock'n'roll
 for any of the right reasons. At the end of his set he's dancing on 
that piano, like Elvis in Jailhouse Rock. Of course, the fragmentation 
of the industry bazaar has ensured that there'll never be another Elvis;
 to be that you'd need to be able to appease fans of ELP, Sex Pistols 
and James Taylor. But Springsteen is still the inheritor of the Elvis 
tradition, if perhaps a little sadder and wiser. In his book Elvis 56: 
In The Beginning Alfred Wertheimer says: "Others had an act. Elvis had 
revelations. He had true emotion".<br>
<br>
THE ONLY revolution that rock might win for anybody is a personal one. 
Bruce Springsteen, helping the no-nuke mob aside, still has the odd 
problem in his own backyard to tidy up. During one of the MUSE concerts,
 he got into a fight with ex-girlfriend, photographer Lynn Goldsmith. He
 was supposed to be issuing an album before Christmas 1979 and playing 
the L.A. Forum on New Year's Eve. Now it looks like he's doing neither.<br>
<br>
With all the anguish, it's surely been worth it; for him, for us. As he 
told Creem magazine: "Rock and roll came to my house where there seemed 
to be no way out...snuck in, ya know, and opened up a whole world of 
possibilities. Ideally if any stuff I do could ever do that for 
somebody, that's the best. Can't do anything better than that. Rock and 
roll motivates. It's the big, gigantic motivator...that's what I think 
you gotta remain true to. That idea, that feeling."<br>
<br>
If it's hard to be a saint in the city, which it surely is, at least Bruce Springsteen is still out there trying.<br>

<br>
Mark Cooper, Record Mirror, 25 October 1980<br>
<br>
MILWAUKEE IS up by the Great Lakes in the industrial badlands. Concrete 
freeways, steel chimneys, cloudy skies and breweries. The kind of place 
"where Mister when you're young/They bring you up to do like your Daddy 
done."<br>
<br>
Kids here don't dress. The girls copy movie hairstyles and wear tight 
jeans and the guys stick to work shirts. This is the Midwest, the 
industrial heartland and sophistication here is an overlong word that 
raises eyebrows.<br>
<br>
Tonight's the first night of the baseball World Series, the biggest TV 
draw of the year. It also marks the return of Bruce Springsteen and the E
 Street Band, the last American rocker, a legend in his own time etc. 
When Springsteen's not around, there's only Tom Petty, Mink De Ville and
 Bob Seger who play American rock 'n' roll and none of them play four 
hour gigs or make such claims to greatness as the Boss. Plus none of 
them get Clarence Clemons on sax.<br>
<br>
Most of the year, kids in Milwaukee survive on a diet of heavy metal, 
wrongly called rock 'n' roll and originating in style from Britain. Each
 time Bruce comes back, it's like the rebirth of rock 'n' roll.<br>
<br>
Who else speaks for rock 'n' roll and the working man? Paul Simon's too 
bourgeoise and Randy Newman too dry, and neither of them rock. 
Springsteen found his subject on his last album and comes close to doing
 it to death in The River.<br>
<br>
The man's in focus and this is one of the first dates of his world tour.
 Four days ago in this hall, someone threw a bottle and gave one of 
Black Sabbath three stitches. There was a riot and the gig was cancelled
 after 10,000 dollars' worth of damage had been done. There's 
electricity in the air.<br>
<br>
The roar that greets Bruce as he hits the stage around eight (no support
 act) is deafening. After that, the crowd settle down to dancing in 
their seats and chanting "Bruce. Bruce" in a low keening that resembles a
 boo and a howl. It's a sign of unrestrained affection.<br>
<br>
Springsteen onstage is all American rock, tight black jeans, T shirt and
 cowboy boots, fifties hair short of a quiff, same hairdresser as James 
Dean. American rock 'n' rollers become the myths they cherish – look at 
Tom Waits or Mink De Ville, Springsteen is possessed by an American rock
 tradition firmly rooted in the fifties – he is its torch bearer and its
 proud representative. He's the one who turned it into self conscious 
poetry, mixing Elvis with Dylan.<br>
<br>
The new songs from The River make up half of the first half of the show 
and much of the second. They centre on cars (over 75 references!), women
 (mostly referred to as "little girl") and working, in that order. They 
circle obsessively around teenage dreams and adult heartbreaks. His 
melancholy is the dominant mood of country and western and it's shared 
by Seger and Simon and all the others. There's nothing sadder than 
dreams, as every American son knows.<br>
<br>
The added subject on The River is marriage, with men and women somewhere
 between true love and a marriage on the rocks. Haven home becomes a 
prison as often as not in The River, dreamers are always disappointed.<br>
<br>
Onstage, Bruce's every gesture is timed to perfection, sometimes 
humorous (knees falling under him as he rockabillys across the stage), 
sometimes sexy, but always on cue and always rock 'n' roll. So rock 'n' 
roll, that it would seem like play acting if he wasn't possessed, if he 
didn't convince you that he lived inside the myth that every gesture can
 be a cool one.<br>
<br>
Anyway, Bruce onstage is not alone, he's got a foil – the Big Man, his 
black brother Clarence Clemens, solid as a rock on the saxophone. 
They're a classic American double act, Tonto and the Lone Ranger. The 
best moments of the show come from the interaction of these two.<br>
<br>
Together they turn 'I Wanna Marry You' into Mink De Ville meets Sam and 
Dave. They appear on either side of the stage, belting it out in 
'Jungleland', then meeting in the middle. Their triumph is their slyly 
humorous reading of 'Fire' which they turn into a joke torch song. Bruce
 sings the lead and Clarence comes on up behind him to end a verse in a 
bass voice straight out of 'Summertime Blues', which causes them both to
 freeze right there in a mock shock, it takes them a good minute to 
unwind from there in slow emotion, a drawn out double take that is pure 
cool acting and has the crowd on its feet.<br>
<br>
Bruce learnt a lot from West Side Story, he never strays from melodrama.
 There's more than a sprinkling of torch operas in the show and Bruce 
wrings every drop of emotion from his long narratives, framed in a city 
roof spotlight. When he flicks a finger in 'Fire' a light pops into his 
hand. Such is his command that what might appear calculated and 
precious, posturing and precision, seems like pure myth. Like all the 
best rock he comes over as absolutely spontaneous.<br>
<br>
It's the height of pride to claim the role of redeemer and prophet, to 
claim succession in the rock 'n' roll tradition. Sometimes Bruce 
succumbs to the sheer weight of that tradition, rock tunes like 'Sherry 
Darling' or 'Two Hearts' that come over as exercises in outworn genres. 
Sometimes he gets too weighty and poetic for his own good, or for basis 
rock. Bruce's claim is that rock is everlasting, a permanent vocabulary 
which he just happens to have made poetic.<br>
<br>
This is his strength and his weakness. Strength, because he's so firmly 
rooted that there's nothing personal about him at all, he's pure myth.<br>
<br>
Weakness, because of the limitations of that myth. Every teenager ages 
and becomes "just another part of it." 'The River' is the show's 
standout, early in the first set, because it asks the question that 
might destroy Bruce's obsession if answered: "Is a dream a lie if it 
don't come true/Or is it something worse/that sends me/Down to the 
river/though I know the river is dry."<br>
<br>
Springsteen's emotional core is close to country, and like country, he 
reveals a soul that is maudlin. His triumph as a performer is his 
ability to grab and hold a crowd through tearjerkers like 'Wreck On The 
Highway'. All American songwriters are sentimental philosophers (the 
popular ones at least), his power is he turns cliches into a tradition 
through sheer love of it. His joy onstage is contagious and far removed 
from arrogance.<br>
<br>
The sheer generosity of this show was extraordinary, three and a half 
hours of ballads and street rockers. The E Street Band played their 
asses off as per normal.<br>
<br>
If the subject that Springsteen's made his own seems limited – 
independence, the darkness, the economy, marriage or whatever – then 
so's American rock. Limited in a way that's hard for foreigners to 
understand. The American dream is a single dream and conservative to the
 core. Rock 'n' roll is only its latest shape.<br>
<br>
Bruce's strength is that he understands it so well. And he can prove it all night. The Boss is back, all diamonds and rust.</div>

<br>
Sylvie Simmons, NME, 22 November 1980<br>
<br>
IT'S EASY to see why the girls go so much on him. You got the excitable 
adolescent of 'Rosalita', 'Crush On You' – hey hey hey what you say 
Cherri darling, quick-romance-behind-the-stadium frenzy – and you got 
the grand romantic tough-and-tender stuff, big gestures, big everything 
and he can prove it all night too.<br>
<br>
Not that he could do too much after a show like tonight's. Four hours. 
Four! Most arena superstars couldn't keep it up half as long and 
certainly not half as exciting. But the little girls understand. Knowing
 of his knackered state backstage after the show they've been using the 
steps that join him to the audience to get up onstage and get in a 
two-minute smacker during the show before the roadies (no bouncers – 
Bruce would have them all in the dole queue, good man) gently pry them 
away, it being a bit hard to sing with more than one tongue per mouth.<br>
<br>
As for the other half of the packed-in crowd, Springsteen seems to be to
 guys with brains and balls what Waylon and Willie are to guys with 
cowboy hats and beer bellies: the big little guy, the one who's broken 
out of the everyday crap, who embodies hopes and dreams and grand 
majestic visions and romance without resorting to Interflora slush. He's
 a lot like a musical John Ford movie with a James Brown songbook 
chucked in. Give the man six words (cars, front-porch, woman, streets. 
darkness, comb) and you'll get two dozen songs, plus enough big gestures
 and visions to make your soul snap in two.<br>
<br>
It's really hard to talk about a Bruce Springsteen concert without 
getting sugary and poetic and totally over-the-top, which runs a risk of
 getting back into those 'future of rock and roll' hype-shit days, and 
turning the man into a caricature, a media recreation of himself with 
words like CELEBRATION flashing alongside the credits in neon lights. 
Which is why, according to the promoters, the whole 43-date tour sold 
out without benefit of ads, just mail-order (200,000 ticket applications
 in New York alone! Four nights sold out at the LA Sports Arena and 
people paying up to a hundred quid to touts) though the guy's been 
rarely heard of since his last tour two years ago. It was just, they 
reckoned, kids – who had no way to explain the 
living-breathing-rock-and-roll experience to their mates without 
dragging them down in person – buying the tickets themselves if they had
 to, with a kind of quasi-religious fervour you'd expect for a man who 
virtually hypnotises audiences wherever he plays.<br>
<br>
It's been 29 months since Springsteen released Darkness On The Edge Of 
Town (other than The River the most quickly successful of his albums – 
River went in the US charts at number 2 and has just eased into top 
position) and when you think that it's not only a double (anathema in 
these days of Maggie-Reagan recession) but that in the time it's taken 
perfecting the thing, careers have bloomed and faded, narrow ties traded
 in for synthesisers and psychedelic drugs, it's easy to see the risk 
he's taken in getting it right (his theory was that he'd have to be 
playing the bloody things for the next six months, so he might as well 
like what he's playing) the fact the 29-city tour sold out so quickly 
just by word of mouth is the kind of magic you get to expect of the man.
 He doesn't let you down.<br>
<br>
Pretty much the entire repertoire gets down in the four (except for a 
short Vitamin E break midway) hours. Thank the lord he got the thing out
 before it became a boxed set otherwise they'd have needed a Bruce 
Weekend Festival to fit the songs in.<br>
<br>
'Born To Run' starts out on a wild note. He remembers all the words this
 time – the first date on the tour, Michigan, he forgot and had to rely 
on the audience to prompt him. It's part of the role the crowd gets to 
play. But this is no mere Rod Stewart pantomime. You know how most 
American audiences fidget and walk around and generally wander during 
arena shows (not the most comfortable) or noisily ruin their expensive 
dental work through the whole show, well this lot were transfixed during
 the slow ones and crazed through the fast ones like some rock and roll 
yoyo, and chanting "Bruuuuuuuce Bruuuuce" between songs like a herd of 
randy cows. 'Prove It All Night': the crowd cheers Clarence Clemon's 
tambourine playing, goes apeshit at his saxophone. 'Tenth Avenue 
Freezeout': Springsteen's voice gets hotter, raspier as it overcomes the
 loud, punchy music, and he leaps into the crowd, sings and conducts 
from the seats, faints into waiting arms, leaps back onstage, jumps in 
the air, lands on his knee, guitar posed just-so, an encore by song 
number three except he promised "I'm gonna be playing all night" to 
delirium from a crowd that really didn't expect any less.<br>
<br>
Some emotional stuff: 'Darkness On The Edge Of Town' and the kinks have 
been ironed out of the sound system so everything's just perfect; 
powerful music, sincere, seductive vocals and so-natural rockstar poses 
that send shivers up and down your spine.<br>
<br>
There's a movie-like quality to the songs, especially those from The 
River, most of which is reserved for the second half though we get a 
preview here. Maybe a bit less idealistic (he couldn't do more!) it's 
based around a working-class kid's hopes and dreams and struggles and 
finally defeat. For the first time a Bruce woman can get pregnant and a 
Bruce car can kill, like 'Wreck On The Highway'. The hymn-like 
'Independence Day' and 'Working Life' get a dramatic rap about his dad, 
got straight out of the school and into the army, married, soon had 
little Brucie and so his dreams as he made his way to the factory every 
day were for his kids to have what he didn't. You could have heard a 
piece of popcorn drop in the place as he sang it – beautiful. Relieved 
by a raunchy 'Jacksons Cage' and 'Promised Land', back to ballads with 
'The River', then onto epic proportions with 'Thunder Road', 'Badlands' 
and a teabreak. A perfectly paced first half stopped only by a rap about
 throwing green twirly things at his band and writing to your MP about 
ticket touts.<br>
<br>
Second half starts on an even more crazed note: 'Cadillac', a teenage 
celebration (not bad for a 31-year-old) and a sexy version of the song 
he wrote for Robert Gordon but sings better himself: 'Fire'. Flo and 
Eddie add backing vocals and a big sound to 'Hungry Heart' (Hungry? 
Those two?!) And there's raps about college, girls as viewed from front 
porches and long memories, a lot of The River. The ultimate ballad: 
'Point Blank'; fun premature ejaculation: 'Crush On You', some hamming 
it up with Clarence (of course the other star of the show) on 'Rosalita'
 ("such a sad song" with a fake slow intro).<br>
<br>
Three hours or more, it's past midnight, but they're back for more 
encores, the melodramatic 'Jungleland' shot like a movie with fading 
lights, and the 'Devil In The Blue Dress' rock and roll medley with wild
 dancing. on the floor, on his knees, in the crowd – delirium, until 
there's nothing left of the guy to give. I could have taken four hours 
more. If this is rock and roll heaven, book me a flight.<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen Takes It To The River: So Don’t Call Him ‘Boss’, OK?<br>
<br>
Dave DiMartino, Creem, January 1981<br>
<br>
All things good come to he who waits; he who hesitates is lost. For 
every stupid cliché there’s another one out there equally stupid that 
means the opposite, a fact of life that nobody forgets as they grow 
older, and a fact that nobody out there should ever want to forget.<br>
<br>
And so it is with Bruce Springsteen, who either waited or hesitated, 
according to who you talk to, and whose long-awaited ‘comeback’ means 
more to more people now than it ever did before. His comeback, of 
course, is The River, two discs of working class angst and fury no doubt
 already memorized in college dormitories and better homes throughout 
the country. ‘The Boss’ returns, the legions chant, and – this time, at 
least – they’re right. Because Bruce Springsteen has returned: he’s 
returned to doing what he likes best (playing) for those he likes best 
(his fans) with who he likes best (his band). And the fact that it’s 
taken him so long to do it is, well, too bad. Because it’s been worth 
it.<br>
<br>
<br>
*<br>
<br>
You could write a book about Bruce Springsteen. Face it, somebody 
already has Springsteen’s long and glorious career has been huffed about
 ad nauseum in Creem, Rolling Stone, Time &amp; Newsweek, radio 
specials, No Nukes reviews, ‘Heroes Of Rock ‘n’ Roll’ TV specials and 
places even your grandmother would notice if she really looked. And the 
fact that he’s met such enthusiastic reception everywhere has probably 
become a bigger albatross around his neck than any quickie "rock ‘n’ 
roll future" quote could ever be, mainly because – as far as being set 
up goes — he couldn’t be in worse shape. It’s common knowledge: set ‘em 
up and knock ‘em down. The reason Bowie’s tune ‘ "Heroes" ’ has those 
quotation marks around its title says it all; there are no more heroes. 
Because nobody wants them.<br>
Yet here’s Bruce Springsteen, hero. Waiting to be knocked down. And he 
probably will be – critically speaking, it’s too much of a temptation 
not to knock Springsteen at this point, with hordes of 
"BROOOOCEE!!"-chanting fans growing larger by the minute, a two-year 
wait between albums (this time without legal hassles) and a gnawing 
feeling that this James Deanish last-angry-man stance is beginning to 
reek of political conservatism and other things you’ll probably be 
reading about elsewhere. And of course all this is bullshit.<br>
<br>
‘Bruce Springsteen’ is a myth; Bruce Springsteen isn’t. ‘Bruce 
Springsteen’ is responsible for the ‘rock classic’ (it wasn’t) Born To 
Run; Bruce Springsteen put out a promising debut album, one flawed great
 one (The Wild, The Innocent &amp; The E Street Shuffle) and one all-out
 classic, Darkness On The Edge Of Town. Ironically, Born To Run got the 
reception its predecessor deserved, though of all Springsteen’s output 
it now sounds the most forced, not quite ringing true these few years 
later. Filled with West Side Story pathos (‘Meeting Across The River’, 
the worst song of the bunch), the album already sounds dated in a way E 
Street Shuffle never will; only ‘Thunder Road’ and ‘Born To Run’ escape 
the trap, remaining classics on the level of, say ‘Rosalita’ or others 
on E Street.<br>
<br>
What made Darkness so great, ultimately, was the sheer durability of its
 sentiment. The emotions dealt with on that set – loss, pain and despair
 – have always been the most durable, especially when they’re conveyed 
as well and as meaningfully as Springsteen surprisingly managed. It’s 
what separates, for instance, the Jackson Browne who wrote ‘Song For 
Adam’ from the Jackson Browne who currently chirps about a Disco 
Apocalypse, or Van Morrison’s ‘Slim Slider’ from most everything he’s 
done since. Springsteen went into the studios with Born To Run’s 
cheering fans patting him on the back and came out telling them that he 
had stuff running round his head that he just couldn’t live down. And 
they loved it. But they would’ve loved Born To Run Part Two even more.<br>
<br>
<br>
*<br>
<br>
And you know the story after that. Two years later, here’s Bruce 
Springsteen in Detroit again, this time touring to promote The River 
which, on this Thursday night, won’t even be in the stores until the 
following Monday. It’s very early into what promises to be the longest 
tour yet: almost a full year of being on the road, time enough for the 
unfamiliar songs the Detroit fans hear to become old favorites by the 
time Their Hero returns. Time enough for a lot of things to happen.<br>
And it wouldn’t be a Bruce Springsteen concert if it wasn’t an endurance
 test. As usual, though, it’s Springsteen &amp; his band who’ll have to 
endure; this time almost four hours, with a brief intermission for the 
band while the audience in Cobo Hall refuels on beer and more. Their 
Springsteen concert is an ‘event’ in the way concerts by the Stones, the
 Who and even Led Zeppelin are: instant sell-outs, scalpers hawking 
tickets outside and smug looks on those inside who’ll be telling friends
 tomorrow what they missed.<br>
<br>
Wisely, the band begins with ‘Thunder Road’. The audience stands, sings 
along, chants "BROOOOCEE!" at the song’s end and, of course, loves it 
all. Old favorites continue; Springsteen knows the audience needs 
reassurance before he wheels out the new stuff that no one in Detroit’s 
ever heard before. When he finally does, though, it makes no difference;
 still "BROOOCE!" The audience keeps screaming ‘til four hours later, 
when the final score is ‘Quarter To Three’ and Springsteen struts 
offstage, ready for tomorrow night’s encore in Chicago. Ten more months 
or so and it’ll finally be all over.<br>
<br>
<br>
*<br>
<br>
Backstage, it’s the usual. Local CBS man Mark Westcott is playing 
traffic cop, directing the flow of concert hangers-on, industry people 
and local radio celebs who’ve come back to "meet The Boss" and are 
wearing appropriate passes visibly on their person. And the fact that 
Springsteen is such a real-and-true Good Guy makes things even more 
problematic: he’d never dream of not facing his public, be it radio 
bigwigs or the little guys, cold and waiting outside at the stage door. 
Unspoken, but not unfelt, is the sentiment that if Bruce Springsteen 
ever dies it will be of terminal niceness, "He Was A Nice Guy" his 
perfect tombstone epitaph.<br>
When we finally reach the inner sanctum, Springsteen’s manager Jon 
Landau greets us. He smiles and says "No more than a half-hour, OK? 
Please?" making it obvious that, indeed, if Springsteen’s niceness 
weren’t enough, the guy also likes to talk, which in these days of Johns
 Lennon and Lydon is no small concern. Inside the dressing room, CBS man
 Westcott is finishing up presenting the radio royalty to Springsteen, 
and the man who, looked 10 feet tall and heroic onstage now looks merely
 shot, tired and diplomatic. "Nice to meet you all," he says, and he 
obviously means it.<br>
<br>
Eventually, Westcott and crew leave, and the E Street Band is brought in
 for a series of quick Creem photos. "No point in keepin’ these guys 
up," Springsteen says, and it’s a quick reminder that the interview to 
come will appropriately take place at Quarter To Three in the morning. 
Some things, I guess, you just can’t escape.<br>
<br>
As the band cruises out, Springsteen shuffles over to a nearby couch, 
the room quickly empties and the tape recorder is turned on. A final 
Springsteen higher-up enters the dressing room, asks "Hey Boss, you want
 a soda or somethin’?" and soon leaves.<br>
<br>
Thus I can’t help but ask immediately: "You mean they all call you ‘Boss’?" and Springsteen cracks up.<br>
<br>
"Well the thing I have with this ‘Boss’ is funny," says he, his voice 
something out of Mean Streets, hoarse and filled with "dese"s and 
"dose"s. " ‘Cause like it came from people like that, who work around 
me. And then somebody started to do it on the radio. It’s funny, cuz…" 
He makes a face. "I hate being called ‘Boss.’ " He laughs; we laugh. "I 
just do. Always did, from the beginning. I hate bosses. I hate bein’ 
called a boss. Everybody says ‘Hey Boss,’ and I say ‘No, Bruce, Bruce!’"<br>
<br>
We laugh again and sit back, and I regale the man who hates being called
 ‘The Boss’ with a story Bob Seger told Creem earlier this year. We’d 
asked Seger what the major delay had been with Against The Wind, and 
he’d started talking about song selection and balance, about him wanting
 the album to "feel right." He’d told us he’d been watching Springsteen 
record The River. "You should see Springsteen," he told us. "He’s goin’ 
through the same movie right now. He’s pullin’ his hair out…"<br>
<br>
"Yeah," Springsteen laughs, "right. Well, from the beginning I had an 
idea of what I felt the record should be. And I don’t think… I’m not 
interested in going in the studio and …" He pauses, considering. "I 
don’t want to just take up space on the shelf, ya know? Or worry that if
 you don’t have something out every six months, or even a year, that 
people are going to forget about you. I was never interested in 
approaching it in that way. I’ve never been, from the beginning. I just 
have a feeling about the best I can do at a particular time, ya know? 
And that’s what I wanted to do. And I don’t come out until I feel that 
that’s what I’ve done. Because there’s so many records coming out, and 
there’s so much stuff on the shelves. Why put something that you don’t 
feel is what it should be?<br>
<br>
"And I don’t believe in tomorrows, that ‘Oh, I’ll put the other half out
 six months from now.’ You may be dead, you just don’t know. You make 
your records like it’s the last record you’ll ever make. You go out and 
play at night – I don’t think ‘If I don’t play good tonight at least I 
played good last night.’ It’s like, there are no tomorrows or 
yesterdays. There’s only right now."<br>
<br>
Heavy stuff, and more ammunition for critics who think Springsteen’s 
approaching death via terminal romanticism – but the truth is the man 
says it and means it, for which he certainly can’t be faulted. Sincerity
 doesn’t play often at Cobo Hall and all that.<br>
<br>
"Nobody’s expectations are higher than your own. You do what you can do 
and that’s the way it stands. People have their expectations, and I try 
to live up to a certain thing I feel myself. And I know I have strict 
ideals about the way we do things, the way the band does things. So 
outside forces play a secondary role. You know people’s expectations are
 gonna be what they’re gonna be – and in the end you’re gonna disappoint
 everybody anyway, ya know?"<br>
<br>
Creem writer Mark J. Norton mentions that he’d seen Springsteen a week 
earlier in Ann Arbor, the opening night of the tour. It was great, said 
he, that Springsteen actually forgot the opening lines to ‘Born To Run’,
 but the audience knew them and sang along until the stunned Springsteen
 suddenly caught on.<br>
<br>
It brings up an interesting point: At this point, most of Springsteen’s 
audience is literally fanatical – they know the songs, the albums, the 
band, and what to expect of a typical marathon performance. I ask 
Springsteen if sometimes he wishes that wasn’t the case, that he was up 
against an audience that had absolutely no idea what to expect from him.<br>
<br>
"I’ve opened for Black Oak Arkansas," he says, shaking his head. "I’ve 
opened for Brownsville Station, and I’ve opened for Sha Na Na. I’m 31 – 
and I’ve been playing in bars I was15. And I’ve faced a lot of audience 
that don’t give a shit that you’re onstage. And if you’re calling 
percentages, we’ve had 2 to 5% total nights like tonight against maybe 
95% in the 10 or 15 years we’ve been playing. Lemme tell you, that did 
not happen then and that does not happen now… And it keeps you from ever
 getting spoiled, because you know what it’s like when nobody gives a 
damn when you come out there. It keeps you in a certain place, it stays 
with you. There’s no free rides.<br>
<br>
"When we first started playing, I’d go to every show expecting nobody to
 come, and I’d go onstage expecting nobody to give me anything for free.
 And that’s the way you have to play. If you don’t play like that, pack 
your guitar up, throw it in the trash can and go home, fix televisions 
or some other line of work, ya know? Do something where that’s the way 
you feel about it. And the night I stop thinking that way, that’s the 
night I won’t do it anymore, ‘cause that’s just the bottom line.<br>
<br>
"I don’t gauge the show by the audience reaction, I don’t gauge the show
 by the review in the paper the next day, I know when I get on the bus 
to got to the next town. I know if I can go to sleep easy that night. 
That’s the way we judge it and that’s the way we run it. And if we 
didn’t it wouldn’t be happening in the first place."<br>
<br>
<br>
*<br>
<br>
We start talking about albums and moods and I ask Springsteen the 
impossible – to tell me in a few words, what The River is all about. It 
is, in a sense, an overwhelming disadvantage to talk to Springsteen 
prior to actually hearing the album: as good as the songs might have 
been that were earlier performed onstage, it’s hard to immediately grasp
 any overriding theme or concept. And yeah, there is an overriding theme
 or concept, as antiquated as that might sound, but The River, like 
Darkness before it, is based on the broadest concept possible – the 
human experience – which automatically makes it more interesting than 
four-fifths of the other records coming out today. Not that four-fifths 
of the other records coming out today aren’t based on human experience, 
but can they help it if they don’t sound like it?<br>
I rattle off a rapid-fire analysis of Springsteen’s LPs, telling him I 
thought both E Street Shuffle and Darkness were better records than Born
 To Run, if only for their consistency of mood. E Street seemed – and 
seems even today – happily nostalgic, for want of a better word, without
 sounding forced or smug. Darkness was as depressing as its name, and 
what made it even more interesting was that it followed Born To Run and 
the whole success-story the thing. In retrospect, Darkness seems like 
the only sane reaction to the same story – and, thankfully, a very human
 one.<br>
<br>
Consistency of mood apparently means much to Springsteen also; he cites 
it as the main reason for The River’s interminable delay. "The main 
thing," he explains, "was trying to focus on exactly what I wanted on 
the album – as opposed to off, you understand – and what I wanted to do 
with the characters. Like on Darkness, that stopped at a certain point. 
Well, what happens now?<br>
<br>
"When I did Darkness, I was very focused on one particular idea, once 
particular feeling that I wanted to do. So this time, one of the things 
that I felt was that on Darkness, I just didn’t make rooms for certain 
things, ya know? Because I couldn’t understand how you could feel so 
good and so bad at the same time. And it was very confusing for me. 
‘Sherry Darling’ was gonna be on Darkness, ‘Independence Day’ was a song
 that was gonna be on Darkness, and the song that I wrote right after 
‘Darkness’ was ‘Point Blank’ – which take that thing to its furthest."<br>
<br>
If you want to start talking about ‘types’ of Springsteen tunes, 
reasonably one can suggest there are two major kinds: happy, upbeat 
songs like ‘Rosalita’ and ‘Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out’, joyful 
Life-Is-Great-Now ditties, and ‘sad’, downbeat songs like ‘Racing In The
 Streets’ or ‘Something In The Night’, moving Life-Ain’t-So-Great-Now 
ditties. The basics E Street Shuffle/Darkness dichotomy. And apparently 
Springsteen sees it the same way.<br>
<br>
"When I did The River, I tried to accept the fact that, you know, the 
world is a paradox, and that’s the way it is. And the only thing you can
 do with a paradox is live with it.<br>
<br>
"And I wanted to do that this time out, I wanted to live with particular
 conflicting emotions. Because I always, personally, in a funny kind of 
way, lean toward the Darkness kind of material – and when I didn’t put 
the album out in 1979 it was because I didn’t feel that was there. I 
felt it was something where I just got a bigger picture of what things 
are, of the way things work, and I tried to just learn to be able to 
live with that."<br>
<br>
So I’m gonna listen to The River when I get it next Monday and I’m gonna feel that paradox you’re talking about?<br>
<br>
"I think so," Springsteen says. "In the end, I think that’s the emotion.
 What I wanted was just the paradox of those things. There’s a lot of 
idealistic stuff on there, there’s a lot of stuff that, hey, you can 
listen to it and laugh at it or whatever. Some of it is very idealistic,
 and I wanted that all on there. At first I wasn’t gonna put it all on 
there, ya know?<br>
<br>
"I saw it as romantic. It’s a romantic record – and to me ‘romantic’ is 
when you see the realities, and when you understand the realities, but 
you also see the possibilities. And sometimes you write about things as 
they are, and sometimes you write about ‘em as they should be, as they 
could be, maybe. And that’s basically what I wanted to do, ya know? And 
you can’t say no to either thing. If you say no, you’re cheating 
yourself out of feelings that are important and should be a part of 
you."<br>
<br>
<br>
*<br>
<br>
We talk a little more about The River and the time it took it record it 
("Believe it or not, I’m goin’ as fast as I can," he says), and 
Springsteen says he didn’t think there were more than 10 takes of any of
 the songs, most of them, in fact, being done under five. Again, he 
stresses; the larger portion of time was deciding which of the 40 tracks
 – that’s right, 40 – he recorded should be included on The River. Word 
was, in fact, that just as the final version of the album was going to 
be pressed. Springsteen yanked it back in time to pull ‘Head Up Without A
 Gun’ off the album. Behavior which, if anything, seemed to indicate 
that true recording spontaneity – typified by the Go-In-And-Bang-‘Em-Out
 mentality – was a concept totally alien to Springsteen.<br>
Springsteen disagrees, somewhat vehemently. "Spontaneity, number one, is
 not made by fastness. Elvis, I believe, did like 30 takes of ‘Hound 
Dog’, and ya put that thing on… The thing is to sound spontaneous; it’s 
like these records come out that were done real fast and they sound like
 they were done real fast. If I thought I could’ve made a better record 
in half the time, that’s exactly what I would’ve done. ‘Cause I’d rather
 be out playing.<br>
<br>
"It’s the kind of thing where… I mean, I know what I’m listening for 
when I hear it played back, and I just had particular guidelines. I mean
 the actual performances were done fast, but I think the thing that 
takes the most time is the thinking. The conceptual thing. It takes a 
certain amount of time for me to think about exactly what it is I wanna 
do and then I’ve gotta wait until I finally realize that I’ve actually 
done it."<br>
<br>
<br>
*<br>
<br>
A large part of Springsteen fandom, in case you didn’t know, centers 
around bootleg LPs and tapes. Springsteen is probably the most widely 
bootlegged performer around these days, and the array of bootlegs – 
radio performances, rehearsal tapes and more – is especially interesting
 because Springsteen, unlike so many artists before him, once seemed to 
almost actively encourage bootlegging, figuring – quite rightly, for the
 most part – that nobody was being harmed in the process, himself 
included. Surprisingly, though, sometime last year he seemed to have 
changed his mind, actually taking a case or two to court to prevent 
further bootleg distribution.<br>
"I remember when I first started out," he says. "A lot of the bootlegs 
were made by fans and then there was more of a connection. But it 
became… there was a point where there were just so many – just so many –
 that it was just big business, ya know? It was made by people who 
didn’t care what the quality was. It just got to a point where I’d see a
 price tag of $30 on a record of mine that to me just sounded really 
bad, and I just thought it was a rip. I thought I was gettin’ ripped. I 
wrote this music, the songs – it all came outta me, ya know? And I felt 
it was a rip. And the people who were doing it had warehouses full of 
records, and they were just sittin’ back gettin’ fat, rushing and 
putting out anything and getting 30 fuckin’ dollars for it. And I just 
got really mad about it."<br>
<br>
Springsteen adds the plan is to release a live album now that The 
River’s finished – which might explain his new bootlegging 
consciousness, indirectly or otherwise.<br>
<br>
And I guess one of the biggest questions remains: does Springsteen 
anticipate any sort of critical or commercial backlash at this point 
with The River? It’s been two years since he’s last been heard from – 
time enough for even some of his oldest friends to turn their backs on 
him.<br>
<br>
Springsteen looks doubtful. "That stuff happens all the time," he says. 
"Besides that’s happened to me already, I’ve lived that already. And 
it’s the kinda thing that just happens. People write good things and 
then they don’t. The first time I went through that, it was confusing 
for me, it was disheartening. And I guess I felt that I knew what I 
wanted to do, and what I was about. It’s just the same old story – where
 I was 25 when that first happened and I’d already been playing for 10 
years. Now I’m 31, and I’ve been through that.<br>
<br>
"When you first come up, and people start writing about you, you’re just
 not used to it. It’s just strange. There were a lot of things that 
brought me real down at the time, and there were a lot of things that 
brought me real up. I was very susceptible to being immediately 
emotionally affected by something like that at the time. But like I went
 through it, I saw it happen, I saw how it happens. I was younger then, 
and much more insecure. I hadn’t put the time in that we’ve put in since
 then. I’ve seen all sides of the music thing and now – whatever happens
 now is only gonna be a shadow of that moment, ya know?<br>
<br>
"So if a lotta people wrote a lotta good stuff and then they wrote a 
lotta bad stuff – whatever happens, it happens. You have a concern about
 it, ‘cause I spent a long time and you put a lot into doing a record. 
It’s the same ol’ story, anybody who says it ain’t a heartbreaker, it 
ain’t true, ya know?"<br>
<br>
He laughs.<br>
<br>
"But that’s the way things are, ya know? And I’m at a point where I’ve got a better perspective about a lot of these things."<br>
<br>
<br>
*<br>
<br>
We’ve already flipped the C-90 over which means it’s been over 45 
minutes and Springsteen keeps talking, obviously exhausted, but 
determined to answer all our questions. In all decency, we can’t ask any
 more without overstaying our welcome; ironically though, the last 
question we ask might easily have been the first. It’s certainly the 
most basic. We ask Bruce Springsteen if he’s happy. Happy with his 
music, his life and himself.<br>
His answer: "Yeah. ‘Cause if I felt that if I was just sitting there and
 squeezing the life outta the music, I wouldn’t do it. But that’s not 
what happens, that’s not what we do. The physical act is not what takes 
the time – I mean, this was our fifth album, and when we rented the 
studio we knew how to make a record. As fast or slow as we wanted to, 
right? The physical thing is not the story. Just how you feel inside 
about it. And that don’t run on any clock. Just how you feel inside, 
just where you are today and what your record is gonna be says out 
there, and what the people that buy that records are gonna feel and get 
from it.<br>
<br>
"And I had an idea, and I wasn’t gonna go halfway with it. Wasn’t a 
point in it. Like I said, I don’t trust no tomorrows or that kind of 
thing. And I’d rather do the time – and the time is no fun to do – 
‘cause if I didn’t do the time there, I couldn’t walk out there on the 
stage.<br>
<br>
"We’re gonna be playing a lot of shows, and we’re just gonna be out 
there for a real long time. And when I go out there at night, I just 
like to feel… like myself. And like I’ve done what I have to do. And 
when I play those songs onstage, I know those songs, I know what went 
into ‘em and I know where I stand. And people will like it and people 
will not like it, but I know that it’s real. I know that it’s there."<br>
<br>
<br>
*<br>
<br>
When we finally leave Cobo Arena, it’s four in the morning and the 
Springsteen crew is boarding various busses, readying for the five-hour 
drive to Chicago. As we close the stage door behind us, we see 30 or so 
fans outside, copies of Born To Run and Darkness in hand, all waiting in
 this early morning hour for a glimpse of and maybe a quick conversation
 with Springsteen. The fans wait, we leave, and it’s a sure bet that 
much later, when a tired Bruce Springsteen opens the backstage door, 
he’ll have 30 more conversations waiting for him before he finally makes
 it to his bus.<br>
And Springsteen, no doubt, wouldn’t have it any other way.<br>

<br>
Nick Kent, NME, 4 July 1981<br>
<br>
"What my band and I are about is a sense of responsibility. If you 
accept it, that makes you responsible for everything that happens. 
People tend to blame circumstances but in the end it's always your 
choice."<br>
<br>
"On the day Elvis died, the British editors were unusually quiet. The 
normally would have been jumping all over one another in an effort to 
control a big story. But the American heartland frightens them."<br>
<br>
HAVING EMPLOYED a lethal combustion of tenacity, arch-theatrics and 
gut-level emotional rapport, Bruce Springsteen left Britain a hero of 
demi-god proportions. He grabbed hold of the country as if it was a 
drenched towel and systematically squeezed every drop of seat out of its
 frayed fibres. Somewhere in the region of a 100,000 people harkened to 
the phrase "Bruce Saves".<br>
<br>
And it was in the national press coverage that you were able to judge 
the fervour in which he was greeted and the impact he made.<br>
<br>
"Springsteen – Rock's Reluctant Millionaire!" blared a headline on the 
front of the Daily Mirror, and inside they gladly devoted a whole 
superlative strafed page to "the king of American rock, whose shows send
 his fans into a frenzy". This was a day before Bruce opened at the 
Wembley Arena with a stunning act that lasted three hours and caused the
 hall to shake so much because everybody was dancing that the lighting 
rig above the band was loosened from its moorings and threatened to 
crash down on Springsteen and saxophonist Clarence Clemons.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile The Sunday Times even dropped their habitually austere, 
condescending front to print not merely Derek Jewell's drooling rave 
review, but a substantial profile. This article headlined "A Responsible
 Rocker", was easily the most articulate study of Springsteen to appear.<br>
<br>
WELL, IT'S like Miami Steve says: If you didn't pick up on it the first time round, you've only yourself to blame."<br>
<br>
In the coffee bar of the Carlton Towers hotel in Knightsbridge, Dave 
Marsh chuckles while quoting the E Street Band guitarist's rationale. 
Marsh, an extremely short, somewhat gaunt midwesterner with cold, 
piercing eyes, is best known as Bruce Springsteen's biographer, his Born
 To Run tome traipsing through all the stages of its subject's career 
with an obsessive lavishness bordering on religious mania.<br>
<br>
Once called the Teenage Dwarf when he edited Detroit's Creem magazine in
 its heyday of the early '70s, Marsh came to ideological blows with the 
journal's burgeoning 'trash aesthetic' slant, spurning 'the gonzo shift'
 for a three-piece suit, wedlock and a desk in Rolling Stone's 
skyscraper offices. The move meant that he aged 20 years overnight – or 
so it seemed to some of his former colleagues.<br>
<br>
Marsh did, however, bridge this leap with a year in Boston working for 
The Real Paper, the 'alternative' journal that became the model for the 
film Between The Lines. More crucially, it was this Boston newsheet that
 first ran the infamous article in 1974 from which Columbia Records 
tartly plucked the slogan, "I have seen the future of rock 'n' roll and 
its name is Bruce Springsteen", thus sparking one of the most 
controversial brouhahas in the history of rock. The piece was penned by 
Jon Landau, but it was Marsh who edited it, backing Landau to the hilt.<br>
<br>
"However you wish to view the pros and cons of that whole 'hype' issue, 
the fact remains that Columbia was on the point of dropping Bruce from 
the label straight after E Street Shuffle had initially bombed. Jon and I
 knowingly interceded with that article. Clive Davis had been ousted and
 only the press department really believed in Bruce's worth.<br>
<br>
"You could say that we were aware of our intentions."<br>
<br>
Marsh often seems remarkably smug. He has a tendency to boast of his 
closeness to and influence with Bruce, and his zealous ardour is always 
well to the fore when Springsteen's form is being discussed. Certainly 
Bruce appears to enjoy talking to Marsh because out of some five lengthy
 interviews that he has given to publicise 'officially' both the release
 of The River and the formidable 18-month world tour (now 
half-complete), Marsh was picked to conduct most of the probing. His 
features were then syndicated and published throughout the world, 
frequently as "exclusives".<br>
<br>
Of course there's nothing unusual in one journalist forming a bond with 
an artist – except that Bruce Springsteen's personal press relations 
person is one Barbara Carr, for the last eight years also known legally 
as Mrs David Marsh.<br>
<br>
For a man who takes such expansive pleasure in conversing with his 
audience when in concert, Bruce Springsteen is reluctant to talk to the 
press. Several reasons appear obvious: firstly that rock critics impaled
 him first as another "new Dylan", then conspired – albeit often 
unwittingly – to belabour him with sufficient superlatives to evoke an 
equally fierce backlash; secondly, and more pertinently: Springsteen is 
aware of being unable to express himself with the articulacy he feels he
 should show. During weighty conversations he tends to become ponderous,
 self-consciously struggling for just the right word – or phrase – with 
which to frame his viewpoint. His statements are often uttered 
haltingly, riddled with "y'knows", "likes" and quasi-neanderthal "uhs".<br>
<br>
When asked to pinpoint key changes that success has brought, for example, his eloquence is taxed to its gruff-voiced maximum.<br>
<br>
"Well, see, that particular word...success, like, it's all down to what 
you're aimin' for, I guess. Like, I felt relatively successful when I 
was just going out and...y'know...playing the clubs around New Jersey. I
 was 18...19, my folks had just moved to California so...like,...I 
wasn't attached to a whole bunch of stuff and my responsibilities only 
involved myself...(pause).<br>
<br>
"And the guys in my band, of course.<br>
<br>
"It was an easy life, just playing the bars. I had an emotional 
outlet...y'know...I was...I wasn't exactly satisfied but I generally 
felt good about what I was doin' even though...(self-conscious chuckle) 
it was no way big time stuff. Like outside of Asbury Park we...(pause).<br>
<br>
"I mean, if you said you came from New Jersey, everyone'd go...(he 
mimicks a repellant groan of contempt). Like, I didn't know anybody 
who'd made a record! Nobody I knew had anything too much. I mean, I 
didn't know anyone who'd even been as far as Pennsylvania," he laughs. 
"Everybody – the band and myself – we stayed real close.<br>
<br>
"See, for me it was more of a struggle after I became...uh...notorious! I
 mean, sorta...after the magazines 'n' stuff. Then I felt the struggle. 
Before I thought I was livin' it up!<br>
<br>
"I just figure...it's like if you're gonna make more'n 500 dollars a 
night, you're gonna have more than just 500 dollar problems. That's all 
there is to it," he laughs. "Y'know?"<br>
<br>
OF THE four weeklies only the staid old Melody Maker has plugged away 
consistently praising the man's work since Greetings From Asbury Park 
first showcased his talents. Sounds and Record Mirror have tended either
 to ignore Springsteen or else afford grudging lip service, while New 
Musical Express has usually been cautious in its evaluations.<br>
<br>
There have been a variety of articles on Springsteen, both praising and 
damning, but a hostile review of his Madison Square Gardens show and 
Julie Burchill's negative response to The River created quite a stir in 
the Springsteen camp. Delicate negotiations between CBS and NME to 
arrange an interview were abandoned, apparently after Bruce's management
 made their feelings towards the paper clear. NME most certainly would 
not have access to Springsteen during his Euro-tour. Only Melody Maker 
was given any kind of audience whatsoever, Dave Marsh informally 
checking into the latter's office to establish a relationship that would
 ultimately land one of the writers a precious 30 minutes informally 
chatting with "the Boss" backstage in Paris sans cassette recorder.<br>
<br>
Ultimately it now appears to have been simply a matter of smart public 
relations cooked up by Landau and PR Barbara Carr. The deal is 
straightforward enough: the national press was essentially the area that
 needed most attention in order to make Bruce Springsteen a household 
name in Britain. When Richard Williams stated in the Sunday Times that 
"he (Springsteen) is...indisputably the biggest attraction in the 
world", Landau and Carr's PR plan had scored bullseye.<br>
<br>
The wilful application of such tactics in Britain tended to be carried 
through without regard for the consequences, especially to Springsteen's
 own reputation.<br>
<br>
"There's not much people can count on today," Springsteen told Rolling 
Stone last December, unwittingly summarising the basic thrust of his own
 career-as-personal crusade. "Everything has been so faithless and 
people have been shown such disrespect. You want to show people that 
somehow somewhere somebody can...I guess you just don't want to let them
 down...Mainly it's important to have that passion for living, to 
somehow get it from someplace."<br>
<br>
That Springsteen has chosen rock'n'roll as a vehicle for stressing a 
gospel of hope, defiance and unity as a tonic against such demoralised 
times is at once both perfectly obvious and patently ludicrous. Obvious 
because it commands such a formidable and impressionable audience, and 
ludicrous because the same audience can no longer define what it is 
anymore, so fragmented has the form become stylistically that the term 
itself is redundant.<br>
<br>
And it's something to which Springsteen agrees, albeit in his typical halting manner.<br>
<br>
"The rock'n'roll thing – the phrase itself – has become so...so 
unrealistic. I'm talkin' about the accoutrements," he smirks 
self-consciously while hoarsely winding his tongue around the syllables.
 "Not...I mean the 'spirit' is forever out there on the streets 
but...like...the other stuff is up at some suite at the Hilton. The 
'star' stuff – the 'star' system somehow got hooked up with the 
Hollywood 'star' thing somewhere down the line in a real negative way. 
Now some people can do it, some can't. The showmanship, the great 
flamboyance (laughs), that wild outrageousness.<br>
<br>
"See, this is one thing I've spent...like...years and years thinking 
about, I guess, from exactly the time when particular people started 
offering me those particular things. First, the car...uh, 
limousine...then the big mansions on the hill. I've always been 
suspicious of, y'know – the whole package deal and I'm...scared of it. 
I'm afraid because you just see too many people gettin' blown away, 
gettin' sucked down the drain.<br>
<br>
"And Elvis ...boy, he was the ultimate example of that. Here was a guy 
who had it all y'know and he...lost it or maybe just let it slip through
 his fingers 'cos somewhere, somehow, he just stopped caring. He let 
himself get fat and he became a cartoon...a caricature."<br>
<br>
Springsteen pauses and then begins to relate key sequences from the 
biopic This Is Elvis (opening in London shortly but which Springsteen 
saw previewed several months ago), becoming more animated as he 
describes early concert footage and then detailing Presley's final 
filmed appearance several weeks before his death where, bloated and 
barely coherent, he can only turn the central monologue of 'Are You 
Lonesome Tonight?' into feeble self-parody.<br>
<br>
This declaration of abject redundancy – the artist diminished to feeble buffoon – clearly haunts Springsteen.<br>
<br>
"Elvis," he states the name as if evoking some deity, "Elvis...now there-was a real heartbreaker!"</div>

<br>
Richard Cook, NME, 22 December 1984<br>
<br>
TO ANYONE who wasn't born in the USA, America is still defined by the 
clutter of images it sends us: television, cinema, music, cars, fast 
food, anything.<br>
<br>
Some of those images play back on themselves, like some endlessly 
recurring echo; so we see moves that are filled with 'America', music 
that is built on refractions of its place of birth.<br>
<br>
Go see Paris, Texas, or hear Guy Clark's 'Old No.1'.<br>
<br>
To somebody born and raised in Britain, without family or material ties 
to the American continent, the land is sometimes hard to conceive of as a
 real place. We insist on reducing it to something our tiny island can 
measure up to. The USA is compressed into a booming steel city, or a 
cold western plain, or a backlot of tenements – whatever image was last 
pressed on our retina.<br>
<br>
Actually going there and finding these places real and breathing and 
just part of some far wider, deeper place can be a slow shock to the 
system. Each time I've visited I've felt vaguely out of sorts, felt 
something akin to Woody Allen's 'West Coast' sickness in Annie Hall.<br>
<br>
Our understanding of American music is mostly shored up by the same 
spindly worldview. If the American music business has stuck Billboard 
tags onto a spread that's almost too multifarious to grasp, British ears
 are even more Philistine than that.<br>
<br>
Even now 'American rock' is meant to encompass everything, in sweeping and derogatory tones.<br>
<br>
But it's this huge, drifting idea of 'America' that casts rock's strange
 and long-standing spell on an English boy's mind. The American 
tradition of rock'n'roll – of Berry, Presley, Richard, Bonds, Ryder, 
Shannon – never had real links to a country without Chevys and drive-in 
movies: these were and maybe still are alien, dangerous things to speak 
of to people brought up in Home Counties or Northern smoke.<br>
<br>
For us, the tradition is one of words and sounds that smell of foreign 
pleasures – even as the explicitness of pop music has grown tediously 
clear in its dealings with sex and spectacle.<br>
<br>
It's a tradition of romance, one that persists into the cycle of the 
digital era. Even The Clash, once the nub of a new wave against that 
tradition, made their best record with an old song called 'Brand New 
Cadillac'.<br>
<br>
IN BRUCE Springsteen, a man who is apparently bearing the heroic 
standard of rock for all America, our second-hand relationship with 
rock'n'roll reaches its own apotheosis.<br>
<br>
In 1984, Springsteen chose to release a record that sets out to fulfill 
and transcend all the promises and invitations extended in his earlier 
music. Born In The USA is a masterpiece that practically chokes with 
emotion, an amazing rock counterpart to Womack's soul bible of The Poet 
II.<br>
<br>
American critics, floored by its perspicacious insight into the state of
 their own country, are barely able to believe that the man they put so 
much trust in has managed to deliver on that faith so completely. It has
 stormed British doors less effectively; America is still far away, and 
Springsteen hasn't been seen here for a long time. Yet a single listen 
rekindles and finally defines for keeps what it is about him that can 
still be valuable to us.<br>
<br>
A British music audience is supposed to be somehow more astute, more 
healthily sceptical than its transatlantic cousin, though considering 
our current pacemakers one suspects that gullibility is a keener 
touchstone.<br>
<br>
When Springsteen first approached us with Greetings from Asbury Park, NJ
 and The Wild, The Innocent And The E Street Shuffle, scepticism came in
 spades. Blatherings about a new Dylan would mean nothing today, but 
then (1973) they taunted our allegiance to a master we once claimed as 
practically our own. Singer-songwriters were entering their last boom 
period – it was the time of Joni Mitchell's For The Roses and Paul 
Simon's There Goes Rhymin' Simon – and it seemed natural enough to plant
 this verbose, crow-voiced man from New York State in the same patch.<br>
<br>
Asbury Park jostled with half-glimpsed city dwellers, like the bus which
 may or may not have stopped at 82nd Street, and the lines in the songs 
stretched way past the succinct metre of pop. If the record was meant to
 be a city street carnival, the sound of it failed hopelessly in trying 
to convey the right air, everything ploughed cloudily together.<br>
<br>
Yet these were seeds of memorable pop material. Greg Kihn purloined 'For
 You' for his 1977 Again LP, threw out half the lyric and made it an 
exuberant, tense message of fidelity; Manfred Mann made a baroque and 
irritatingly memorable thing out of Blinded By The Light.<br>
<br>
The Wild, The Innocent And The E Street Shuffle – it sounded like a 
marriage between Eugene O'Neill and Wilson Pickett – took the feeling of
 ponderous, writerly art even further. A pretty, closely-watched love 
song like 'Sandy' was still weighted with superfluous detail; the 
half-intended suite on the second side had some of the rambling mystique
 of early Van Morrison mixed with anthemic bursts of bar-band rock. 
Strings and odd instruments like recorders clotted in the corners of the
 sound.<br>
<br>
The photograph of Springsteen's band on the cover's backside made them 
look uncannily like The Doobie Brothers, while the artist himself 
resembled the Pacino of Panic In Needle Park and Serpico, a wiry, 
pointed little man with a Jesus beard.<br>
<br>
In fact, those records scarcely broke the surface over here. Their 
moments of tenderness were too brusque and fleeting, We expected 
songwriters to pour themselves out through voluminous love letters. 
'Wild Billy's Circus Story', a big top vignette from E Street Shuffle, 
displayed a writer with a soft heart for little folks, not the allusive,
 Blakean juggler we expected a 'new Dylan' to be.<br>
<br>
This America was one we hardly recognised.<br>
<br>
AT ANY event, when Springsteen was finally shoved into Britain by an 
over-zealous record company, it was the year Dylan himself chose to 
release his last great record, Blood On The Tracks. Against such a 
reflective opus, Born To Run sounded wildly bombastic, an opera set 
against a sonata. We were surprised to find that there was no basis to 
compare them.<br>
<br>
The collectors record of 1975 was probably Little Feat's The Last Record
 Album. In Lowell George's pilled-up vistas of Southern women, whisky 
breath and dusty railroad territories we were sold a vagrant's America 
that seemed irresistible at the time.<br>
<br>
But Springsteen's America was about to come much closer.<br>
<br>
Posters showing a guy with a biker jacket and a puckish grin, leaning up
 against a big black sax player, began sprouting over London. I remember
 the endless graffiti variations scrawled under the tube posters' 
legend: "FINALLY The World Is Ready For..." Then this crashing record 
Born To Run came gunning out through radios late that summer.<br>
<br>
If it was a cool record to own, it wasn't as cool as Feat's or Dylan's; 
and we stopped short at calling him messiah. Reviewers clubbed down his 
Hammersmith shows, fuelled on animosity towards Jon Landau's notorious 
"future of rock'n'roll" declamation. Springsteen came and went, like any
 other visitor.<br>
<br>
TODAY, BORN To Run – in terms of spiritual release and hotwire intensity
 – stands as the blood brother of Born In The USA. Springsteen's songs 
still sprawled with words, but they were at the service of a vision that
 was truly born of running – of sprinting to the sound of classic, 
American rock'n'roll.<br>
<br>
There were comparisons with Phil Spector because of the ringing 
crescendoes the sound dealt out: and the candour with his characters' 
secrets in this urban 'Jungleland' might have suggested a link with old 
Lou Reed. Except Reed never went for broke as Springsteen did.<br>
<br>
As the noise settled down a little, we realised that this really was a 
giant at work. The mumble of his first records suddenly focused into a 
voice as tearing and impassioned as anything since the Sun Presley; and 
the words were those of a humanitarian outlaw, a man who could walk 
alive from a Tenth Avenue freeze-out (to the accompaniment of horns that
 blared like heavy traffic) and still treat his girl with bluff, burning
 affection – even if she turned out to be "just another tramp of 
hearts". His band swaggered and roared around him.<br>
<br>
It was the most romantic, inflamed, proud, jewelled, ecstatic rock music an English teenager could have heard in 1975.<br>
<br>
'Night' was a song that buzzed through your head as you combed your hair
 and prepared to bust the city in half – "every muscle in your body 
sings as the highway ignites" – and 'She's The One' cut a boy to his 
heart as he gazed on some unmissable, untouchable girl. It was a grey 
time, and Springsteen's America spoke in a way that we too could put 
trust in – for this man was embattled and frustrated, not some late 
hangdog hippie. He sounded like he worked and sweated and cried.<br>
<br>
It kept him afloat after we ritually torpedoed America with 'our' new 
wave. The ruinous legal dispute that kept him away for three years ended
 with Darkness On The Edge Of Town, a slow and pensive record. The time 
away had hardened the brimming, explosive youth of Born To Run into this
 frowning and determined music.<br>
<br>
The refugees of the "last chance power drive" end up burned and blind in
 'Something In The Night'; 'Factory' is an even darker 'Night'. In the 
studio, Springsteen and Landau dispensed with the echo and effect of BTR
 and huddled the players close.<br>
<br>
There was rage here – 'Adam Raised A Cain' – and a pride in love 
('Candy's Room') which intensified anything in Springsteen's past. The 
centrepiece is 'Racing In The Streets'. It again celebrates something 
which English experience didn't contain – strip racing with cars built 
from scratch – with a core of uncomprehending despair that the track 
finally leads nowhere. In a final ambiguity, the song ends on an 
instrumental code that seems to imply the sun rising again to dispel the
 darkness.<br>
<br>
As time went on, Springsteen passed into the currency of the stadium 
visitor. His shows took away our breath, because he played longer and 
longer than anybody could stand – and it still held defiantly together, 
rock'n'roll medleys, Mitch Ryder and Searchers tunes, everything.<br>
<br>
BY 1980 and The River, Springsteen's status in his native land bordered 
on the holy; here, with Costello and Weller in full flight, he'd begun 
to seem old.<br>
<br>
The River flowed over four long sides, and it offered easy meat to those
 who scented a situation coming full circle. Cars and girls, girls and 
cars, and all running through the same streets which had been banging us
 between the eyes as well as the ears: since Born To Run we'd seen Mean 
Streets, Taxi Driver and Blue Collar, and the mythology that once seemed
 a Springsteen patent had been declared open season.<br>
<br>
Where there'd once been 'new Dylans' there were now 'new Springsteens'.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of plain boisterous tunes on The River, like 'I'm A 
Rocker', 'Out In The Street', 'Jackson Cage'. Some asked how old this 
guy thought he was – 18, 19? (Springsteen was 31). Wasn't he a little 
mature to be singing "ooh, ooh, I gotta crush on you"?<br>
<br>
The River was concentrated passion of rock'n'roll playing: superbly 
recorded and organised, it unfolds like one of Springsteen's live shows.
 Each of the four sides ends with a soliloquy – 'Independence Day', 'The
 River', 'Stolen Car', 'Wreck On The Highway' – that shows someone 
looking as close as he might for solace or a word of hope from a 
companion.<br>
<br>
In six years we had all grown older, and in 'Stolen Car' (perhaps the 
saddest of all his songs) the point hurts like a heart broken beyond 
repair: "She asked if I remembered the letters I wrote/When our love was
 young and bold/She said last night she read those letters/And they made
 her feel one hundred years old."<br>
<br>
WITH NEBRASKA it seemed we had lost sight of Springsteen's America for good.<br>
<br>
Now that we have Born In The USA it feels like an interlude, a basement 
tape. Springsteen sings these shockingly desolate songs alone with his 
guitar, eerily distant, as if he really were playing on the other side 
of some great gulf. It almost suggests the atmosphere of ancient country
 blues. In 'My Father's House' a man goes home to find home gone; in 
'Atlantic City' is the desperate hope of the damned. The two brothers of
 'Highway Patrolman' reflect the deepest of all American divisions, 
between the city and the country, and in 'Nebraska' itself Springsteen 
translates Terence Mallick's Badlands to an unrepentant confession.<br>
<br>
Nebraska – the title itself holds up an unknown America. We have any 
number of mirrors on New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco...but
 like the bleak cover shot looking across a car hood out to nothingness,
 this place has no face, no name in our store of the American image.<br>
<br>
Nebraska is a gloomy, fractured record that displays Springsteen's 
particular allegiance to a working people, as faceless as the title he 
chose. It roots him in ground much older than his other music might at 
first have reflected. His declared liking for the work of John Ford 
makes sense of the way this writing runs: a grand, bracingly wide genre 
that is taking years to track through the details.<br>
<br>
IT IS 1984, ten years after he wrote Born To Run. The time seems 
littered with bases of optimism and dashed hope, most of them inscribed 
with a Springsteen line: "Well Sir, I guess there's just a meanness in 
this world". Born In The USA is his anniversary record, the second 
breath taken in the spirit of Born To Run – this time bolstered by 
experience and a reluctance to invest blind faith.<br>
<br>
The life and vigour of of this music, selected from more than 50 songs 
cut at these sessions, is itself a testament to old-fashioned virtues – 
most of it played live in the studio, delivered with a catapulting 
relish. The songs leap, shake, race from the grooves. Springsteen's 
voice pounds like a fist on this muscular, perfectly honed American 
rock.<br>
<br>
Yet the words are creased with a suspicion that there are many, perhaps 
too many things to be put right in this USA. 'Cover Me' asks for love to
 put out the eyes; 'Downbound Train' smashes a man's heart on the 
ground; the title song threads together Vietnam and an empty future in a
 way that belies its thunderous music. If it's preaching, it's the sort 
that everybody does in bars, on trains, in front of their TVs.<br>
<br>
The driving, impassioned certainty of this doubt about our progress is, I
 think, the most a rock performer will ever give us. In the magnificent 
'Dancing In The Dark', Springsteen practically explodes with his right 
to take the next step, and it's this brinkmanship which charges his 
whole music. Instead of wasting his strength on rhetoric of the 
everybody's-got-to-live-together ilk, the singer simply holds out his 
hand.<br>
<br>
In the example he sets – of exhausting and ridiculously generous tours, 
disarming frankness in public statement and a general distance from the 
excesses which make the rock star such a dislikable creature – 
Springsteen puts himself closer to his art than any other major rock 
performer.<br>
<br>
That music in turn feels closer to me, to the country I live in, than 
the maundering efforts our own troupers have lately thrown up. This 
America, of working people confused about their present and worried 
about their future, has turned out to be nearer home than its faraway 
demeanour first suggested.<br>
<br>
The miracle of Springsteen's Born In The USA is this very universality. 
It's almost like a paean to anybody's home country, to the people who 
make up it's largest number. That half of Springsteen's sight bonds me 
closer to this American rock than to any Spandau Ballet drivel about 
"pride".<br>
<br>
The other half consists of his instinct for the deepest pulse of rock, a
 tradition almost devoured by misuse. Springsteen's unshaken belief in 
the mystery of rock, the seizure of the heart that can't be written 
down, staggers scepticism. Since Born To Run, Springsteen's rock'n'roll –
 which has intermittently followed me in growing up over ten years – 
sought to grasp the spark more honestly than any other.<br>
<br>
It almost breaks me open, because in the throes of his best music 
Springsteen unstoppers my reserve. His sound can remind me of every girl
 kissed, every closeness, every passion to achieve. It's easy to imagine
 how Landau felt when he wrote those words a little over ten years ago.<br>
<br>
The spark abides, in two particular moments from Born In The USA. As the
 band romp to the close of 'Dancing In The Dark', Springsteen 
spontaneously yells "Hee-eey Baby!", as if he's suddenly recalled Bruce 
Channel's old song, a hit when he was 13. And in 'I'm On Fire' he 
refurbishes the locomotive rhythm that runs through most American music.
 When the music begins to fade, he slips into a falsetto that sounds 
like the long, lonely whistle of Elvis' 'Mystery Train'. Slowly, it 
winds out of earshot.<br>
<br>
"IN THE end, it's all part of the same thing. Which is why Elvis' 
message was so profound. It reaches everybody, everywhere. Doesn't 
matter where or what the problems are or what the government is like. 
It's a heart. It's a human thing." Bruce Springsteen, 1984.<br>

Glenn O'Brien, Spin, 1985<br>
<br>
Hey, it was the greatest show I’ve ever seen. It was like rock ‘n’ roll 
and a gospel meeting and a party and the World Series rolled into one.<br>
<br>
Some of my best friends are people I used to dislike. And it is 
frequently those qualities that made them repellent in the first place 
that later make them seem so attractive. Today, when someone says of a 
friend: "How can you stand it?" I just smile and say "Give 'em a little 
time."<br>
<br>
I think I've learned my lesson. Now I like people like that right off. 
It's not so much a matter of suspending judgment as collating it. And 
I've learned not to go by anybody else's opinion of anything. In fact, 
if they hate it, I'm intrigued. I didn't see the movie Bonnie and Clyde 
for three years because everybody liked it. Later I would see it ten 
times.<br>
<br>
It was like that with Bruce Springsteen. We're still not best friends, 
but now I'm a real fan, a fan who used to sort of roll his eyes and say,
 "Oh yeah, he's the guy with all the bells in his songs, right?" Just 
the fact that Rolling Stone writer Jon Landau said something like "I 
have seen the future of rock 'n' roll and it is Bruce Springsteen" was 
enough to keep me away for a couple of years. Later that would be 
replaced by, Like, any guy that Dave Marsh wrote a book about...<br>
<br>
Also, it seemed like such a pose, with the jeans and the T-shirt and 
everything. But sometimes I forget that if you hold a pose long enough 
it may take root. And then I might have thought, "Man, if he's hooked on
 that chick, he's not playing with a full deck... "<br>
<br>
A remark I might have successfully directed at myself any number of times.<br>
<br>
I don't know just what it was really. I guess I thought Bruce was opera.
 I thought he was overblown. I thought it was trumped-up romanticism. I 
thought it was lie. But if you tell a lie long enough... But now I don't
 think Bruce lies. Bruce wouldn't lie, man! Bruce has imagination. I 
think he always had it, but it wasn’t always so powerful. I think it got
 honed by the big beat.<br>
<br>
I’m not sure how I figured it out. I think if you’ve got an ear and 
radio you're going to figure it out sooner or later. I know I had 'Born 
to Run' going through my head at one point, but I was determined to 
resist. I think when I finally was ready to give up was around the time 
of The River. Maybe I heard 'Cadillac Ranch' on the radio and there was 
just no way not like it.<br>
<br>
But I'm one of those masses that went Bruce-crazy with Born in the USA. I
 got the promo in the mail and I played it and it was great, every song 
was great, and I kept playing it. A few days later I showed up at my 
favorite record store and I picked up all his albums and I went to the 
checkout counter and the cashier just couldn't believe it. "Oh no! You 
too?!" I guess I wasn't the only old new-wave person into this Bruce 
thing. This clerk seemed to think that all of her friends were dropping 
like files to it. "Oh no! You too?! She looked at me like "hadn't the 
Ramones and the Dolls and Iggy and Lou taught me anything?"<br>
<br>
Now you can go around pointing out facts like that Lou himself said "Hey
 man, Springsteen is OK" on his live Take No Prisoners album several 
years ago (the same album on which he refers to Robert Christgau as 
"some asshole in the Village Voice"). You might mention that Springsteen
 is friends with David Johansen; that they both used to play upstairs at
 Max's around the same period. But you know it won't do any good. You 
know that some of your East Village friends will not be converted, not 
because of anything having to do with Bruce per se, but because they 
cannot bear the idea of liking anything so popular. You get the feeling 
that if Joey Ramone himself made the cover of Time and Newsweek 
simultaneously, they would be forced to drop him too and complain that 
he had sold out.<br>
<br>
It's hard to accuse Bruce of selling out when he keeps his ticket prices
 low (like what? One third of the Jackson tour price?) and turned down 
the $12 million Chrysler offered him to do a three-second ad spot, but 
then they can always come back and say: "Hey, $12 million is nothing to 
him. He takes in over a million a show."<br>
<br>
No, all you can say to these people is, "Hey, that’s exactly how I felt.
 But have you seen the show? It’s the greatest rock 'n' roll show I've 
ever seen."<br>
<br>
This always gets 'em, because they know I've seen the Beatles, Stones, 
Hendrix, P-Funk, Iggy, Cream, Who, L.Z., Talking Heads, Ted Nugent, what
 have you. So then they give you that look like you've got this 
ultra-premature form of Alzheimer's that starts out in the so-called 
"pleasure pathways" of the brain. They look at you like you're a rock 
'n' roll form of Moonie. But, hey, it was the greatest show I've ever 
seen. It was like rock 'n' roll and a gospel meeting and a party and the
 World Series rolled into one. We did the wave. We danced. We sang. All 
the way back in the last stadium row you could see people singing and 
dancing, and they knew all the words. Bruce and the band played for 
fours hours, and at the end you were still ready to go.<br>
<br>
What I really liked, and what some people really hate, was the sober 
ecstasy of the Bruce show. You hear that his band doesn't drink or drug 
on the road. They say that you couldn't do that stuff and keep up the 
pace. But that's almost beside the point. The point seems to be that in 
this case imagination is enough. It's enough to make you sing and dance 
all night. And the singing is better and the dancing is better, 
everybody drives home fine, and the next morning they wake up singing. 
That's imagination.<br>
<br>
Then there's this thing where people have mixed up Bruce with Rambo. 
Rambo is the guy who posed with Reagan the same week his girlfriend's 
nude pictures were running in Playboy and his nude pictures were running
 in Playgirl. Bruce hasn't posed with any candidates, or, as far as we 
know, nude.<br>
<br>
Bruce's America is not a cartoon. If you think it is, then pick up a 
cassette of the Nebraska album and pop it in the car deck and drive some
 interstate and get back to us.<br>
<br>
I don't think Bruce is a goody-goody, I don't think he's holding back or
 reacting or faking it. The guy's got heart and soul. I bet he doesn't 
jack off. I bet he never told a girl he loved her just to get into her 
pants. Of course, I didn't either. I always meant it.<br>
<br>
I saw a picture in the paper of Bruce playing in a charity softball 
game. He has a beautiful swing. You can tell a lot about people by what 
kind of shoes they wear, but maybe even more (with men anyway) by how 
they swing a bat. Bruce is a natural. He keeps his eye on the ball. He 
swings level. He follows through. Like in life.<br>
<br>
I dont' think of Bruce as some flag-waver riding the crest of yuppie 
reaction. I think of him as the guy who is proving once and for all that
 you don't have to be an asshole to be an artist.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is a poet. He writes great words. But he's also a rocker. I 
listen to some of the older albums and I like them OK. But you live and 
learn. And if you live and learn right, you get better. I think with 
Nebraska Bruce really learned how to write and with Born in the U.S.A. 
he really learned how to rock. So I don't care that I just hopped on the
 bandwagon with the millions. It's just great right now. And I'm happy 
to be a very avant-grade mainstream far-out regular guy.<br>
<br>
Epilogue: I just read that there's bar in L.A. where all they play is 
Bruce and Bruce-related music. I don't know if that means Little Steven 
and maybe Southside Johnny are played too, or if it's like more sweeping
 and includes such Bruce-esque combos as John Cafferty and Beaver Brown 
(which has a Clarence Clemons lookalike) or such regular guys as John 
Cougar, who now seems to be threatening to be original. Anyway, I figure
 if I start out for that bar right now, maybe I'll know a lot more by 
the next issue.<br>
<br>
P.S.: We all know that Bruce is changing the world. I think it's for the
 better. He's already saving me money on clothing bills. But seriously, 
here's something to be considered:<br>
<br>
Early in the 21st century a great many of the young men you meet will be
 named Bruce, maybe even most of them. This will be the greatest 
popularity of the name Bruce ever. My brother is named Bruce, so I can 
tell you, not long ago it was not a fun name to have. It was not exactly
 like being a boy named Sue, but the other little guys didn't treat a 
Bruce like a Jim either. Bruces got sand kicked in their faces. The only
 heroic Bruce back then was publicly wimpy and only anonymously bold – 
he had to put on a bat costume to rock out. But in a new generation, 
Bruce will rule. Arnold will have made quite a comeback too. But Bruce 
will rule.</div>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: The E Street Band Live/1975-85<br>
<br>
John Mendelsohn, Creem, March 1987<br>
<br>
ON THE SUNNY, balmy Monday this was released the local deejays said, 
absenteeism in San Francisco broke all records, as tens of thousands of 
otherwise loyal employees called in sick so they could get in record 
shop lines to buy it and then go to the beach or Golden Gate Park to 
spend the day digging it.<br>
<br>
Shortly thereafter, National Public Radio reported that, except for the 
balminess, beach, and Park, the pattern was identical across the land. 
Excitement over a record album's release hadn't been so nearly universal
 since Sgt. Pepper reached the racks on the first day of June, 1967.<br>
<br>
Brilliant as he is onstage, The Boss actually didn't seem that likely a 
prospect for a live album. Artists who go in for a lot more "sweetening"
 – overdubbed instrumental ornamentation and production flourishes, that
 is – are actually much likelier, since they sound much more different 
live. If I'm not mistaken (between the times the album went on sale and 
my review had to be stapled to the carrier pigeon, I barely had time to 
listen to the whole new album, let alone old ones), few of the 
arrangements here are radically different from those on the album 
versions. And at least one – that of ‘No Surrender’ – does the song no 
good at all. Pared way down instrumentally, it sounds like the winning 
entry in a Dylan-ca.-1963-Composealike contest.<br>
<br>
Speaking of ‘No Surrender’, it was (or at least it seemed) only 72 hours
 ago that Born In The U.S.A. finally abandoned the charts and airwaves. 
Isn't it a molecule vainglorious to ask us to virtually buy it all over 
again?<br>
<br>
Maybe not. One of the most amazing things about El Jefe is that he sings
 as though his very life depends on what he's singing, whether he's 
singing it for the first or Jillionth time. He breathes new fire into 
most of the more fiery stuff here, and the brave lads of the E Street 
Band do their share as well, with the result that even the most 
over-familiar Born stuff sounds new and vital. ‘Cover Me’, for instance,
 here features a dramatically psychedelic introduction, ‘I'm On Fire’ a 
couple of very brief but very hilarious Elvis Costello impressions. And 
‘Born In The U.S.A.’ itself is absolutely brutalizing – and even 
terrifying at the end, when Bruce starts screaming as though possessed 
by something a great deal less salubrious then usual.<br>
<br>
The album reminds us that there is no more thrilling sound in modem rock
 than that of The Boss roaring (as in ‘Darkness On The Edge Of Town’) 
like all 10 of the 10 Mightiest Soulmen in History of the Heroism of 
Little Guys – or, for that matter, of The Big Man's sax kicking in – 
over the thunder of the E Street Band. Indeed, there are stretches – 
such as that including, in order, ‘Two Hearts’, ‘Cadillac Ranch’ and 
‘You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)’ – of sheer rock 'n' roll 
heaven here, stretches of music so rollicking, so exuberantly performed 
(just listen to the Mighty Max lose control of himself and turn into 
Keith Moon at the end of ‘Hearts’!) that the little hairs on your 
goosebumps' necks will stand on end.<br>
<br>
But let's be honest with one another. When he got to ‘This Land Is Your 
Land’ and the stuff from the Nebraska album in concert, you headed for 
the snack bar or lavatory, and I was right behind you. So don't be 
surprised if you find yourself ducking into the kitchen to whip up a 
delicious snack when it comes on here. Nor should we be ashamed – it is 
strictly dullsville. If he were really a nice guy, Il Capo wouldn't make
 countless defenseless millions of us listen to so much of his generally
 painful harmonica playing. A little joke, you see.<br>
<br>
In concert, ‘Seeds’, a by-the-numbers expression of rage for the plight 
of the homeless of Houston set to '50s Guitar Cliche No. 34, struck 
these old ears as evidence that The Boss was succumbing to the same 
affliction from which John Lennon suffered for a year or two before and 
after his Some Time In New York City, whereby one is incapable of 
reading about any injustice anywhere without feeling compelled to write a
 song about it. I'm no crazier about it on record. Nor is ‘Racing In The
 Streets’, which I always hoped against hope was a sly self-parody, any 
less tedious here than heretofore, Roy Bittan's (characteristically) 
wonderful ivory-tickling notwithstanding.<br>
<br>
As far as the new material's concerned, The Boss turns in a rendition of
 ‘Fire’ (once a hit for the Pointer Sisters, of all people) that I 
suspect I'd find unnervingly sexy if I were a woman or gay. I found 
Patti Smith's ‘Because The Night’ insufferably overblown, and The Boss's
 is hardly less so. It's a vivid testament to his stature that he won't 
be ridiculed savagely for the minstrel-showishness of the Stax classic 
‘Raise Your Hand’. He doesn't exactly make Edwin Starr's ‘War’ his own. 
But ‘Paradise By The C’ is a witty and rollicking instrumental in the 
tradition of The Champs' ‘Tequila’. And he sings Tom Waite's infinitely 
corny ‘Jersey Girl’ with such conviction and tenderness that your heart 
breaks anyway. Exquisite.<br>
<br>
The "Born In The U.S.A." tour stuff, all recorded on digital 24-track 
equipment, is an audiophile's delight, just as it was live. Such 
gorgeous highs! Such ambiance! The sound can get pretty mushy elsewhere,
 though, nowhere moreso than in ‘Because The Night’ and ‘Candy's Room’. 
And the poor Big Man's sax solo on ‘Badlands’ sounds as though it was 
recorded from somewhere on the Arizona State University campus other 
than where he was playing it<br>
<br>
On the repertoire front, it'd've been grand to hear the versions of, 
say, Manfred Mann's ‘Pretty Flamingo’, idoi-cum-protege Gary (U.S.) 
Bonds's ‘Quarter To Three’, or Yes's Tales Of Topographic Oceans that 
Bruce and the boys briefly enjoyed playing as their final encore around 
the turn of the decade, Another little joke, don't you know.<br>
<br>
Would it have been too much trouble for somebody to have annotated the 
deluxe booklet that accompanies the album, so that we'd know where and 
when the many photographs inside were taken, and exactly who's in 'em? 
(We know that Neal Preston took the one on the cover, and that, no fault
 of Neal's, it's almost indisputably the least flattering of anyone 
ever. How can you help but like a guy who, like The Boss, didn't insist 
on using the infinitely more flattering one from page 15?)<br>
<br>
All together now: We want the movie to which this ought to have been the
 soundtrack! We want the movie to which this ought to have been the 
soundtrack! We want the movie to which this ought to have been the 
soundtrack!<br>

				<div class="content">Busman's Holiday: Bruce Springsteen 1987-1990<br>
<br>
Phil Sutcliffe, Q, September 1990<br>
<br>
When not touring the world's stadiums, was Bruce Springstreen to be 
found morosely grouting his bathroom tiles and ruefully reflecting upon 
his broken marriage? Indeed he was not. There was a new album to record,
 surprise gigs to be played, and no small amount of hell to be raised. 
Phil Sutcliffe ploughs his way through a mound of discarded beer bottles
 and busted guitar strings to chart the indefatigable troubadour's 
progress since 1987's Tunnel of Love.<br>
<br>
It's nearly three years now since Tunnel Of Love and Springsteen addicts
 are suffering I withdrawal symptoms. Of course, rumours of an "October 
album, tour next year" nature abound, but substantiation, as ever, will 
remain impossible until Springsteen and manager Jon Landau sense that 
perfectly pontifical moment.<br>
<br>
The suspense is both killing and thrilling as, throughout the '80s, 
Springsteen's contact with his public was a unique combination of 
extremes: the full-bore Greta Garbo "I want to be alone" dedication to 
privacy interspersed with recklessly untrammelled, unmindered sorties 
into the sweaty embrace of every person's ordinary life.<br>
<br>
The Tunnel Of Love campaign, its unscheduled accompaniment of tabloid 
uproar about Bruce's marital problems and the lawsuit from a couple of 
former roadies alleging, essentially, that he was a mean old sod, and 
then the Amnesty International Human Rights Now! world tour all exposed 
Springsteen as never before and in ways that were, for the first time, 
only partly within his control.<br>
<br>
Great music at chosen times and places was no longer the whole 
experience for Bruce-watchers. His love life, previously unremarkable, 
was suddenly "scandalous", open to fervid speculation by gossip 
columnists and, of course, fans committed or not. Not only that, but he 
was coming out politically too, defining himself, cutting away the scope
 for speculation always offered by the storytelling songwriter.<br>
<br>
For the Bruce-watcher it's all rather worrying. What is he up to? Is he 
living happily ever after with Patti Scialfa? What does all this ligging
 about with rock'n'roll celebs over the past couple of years mean? What 
will his wider political awareness and encounters with world music do to
 him?<br>
<br>
Most of all, Bruce-watchers just want to know he hasn't lost it...<br>
<br>
1987<br>
<br>
October 10: Following the latest outburst of unannounced Springsteen 
guest spots with New Jersey Shore bar bands — often a hopeful sign — 
Tunnel Of Love is released worldwide. Critically, it is welcomed, though
 with some surprise. His 1985 marriage to Oregon-born model and actress 
Julianne Phillips had provoked expectations of more than a little 
lyrical romanticism, but only 'All That Heaven Will Allow' offers any 
hint of domestic bliss. The Q reviewer observes of its melancholy tone 
and overt scepticism about the nature of relationships that "The 
darkness at the edge of town is seeping into the master bedroom". In 
reality, though, there seems nothing to indicate that the songs are 
autobiographical: American paparazzi have caught Julianne emerging from a
 gynecologist's office and, on the strength of that, the tabloids report
 her "pregnant" and Bruce "delighted".<br>
<br>
The only shadow case on Springsteen in the Breeding months is that, 
through a story sold for international syndication, his former senior 
roadies Mike Batlin (credited with "recording" the home-made album 
Nebraska in 1982) and Doug Sutphin have accused him of dismissing them 
for accidental errors like damaging his canoe. Springsteen denies it 
all, but the two promise to sue.<br>
<br>
The album goes straight to Number 1 in Britain, America and many other 
countries, but sales will fall well short of 1984's Born In The USA and 
1986's Live boxed set.<br>
<br>
October 22: At St Peter's Church, New York, Springsteen attends the 
memorial service for talent spotter supreme John Hammond, who signed him
 to CBS in 1972 and also discovered Bessie Smith, Billie and Bob Dylan. 
Springsteen sings Dylan's 'Forever Young' solo. .<br>
<br>
October 31: At McLoone's Rumrunner, a bar and restaurant in Sea Bright, 
N.J., Springsteen and most of the E Street Band trick or treat a 
Halloween crowd by showing up in black and wearing hangmen's masks to 
take the stage. They play a set which includes the first five 
performances of some Tunnel Of Love material and the acoustic 'Born To 
Run', which was to be a feature of the following year's tour.<br>
<br>
November 6: A bunch of kids knock on Springsteen’s front door in Rumson,
 N.J.. They say there's an open day at the school across the road and 
would he like to come over? He says, Sure, and soon he's onstage with 
local stalwarts the Fabulous Greaseband, giving it some 'Carol', 
'Lucille', 'Twist and Shout' and 'Stand By Me'. As matters get nicely 
out of hand, Bruce hollers, "Keep it down, my wife's asleep across the 
street!"<br>
<br>
November 20: Springsteen turns up at the Stone Pony, one of New Jersey's
 few clubs surviving from the legend-making eruption of the early '70s, 
and joins Bobby Bandiera's band to round up the usual suspects — 
'Carol', 'Little Latin Lupe Lu' and so on. Bandiera is the man who would
 have replaced Miami Steve Van Zandt on guitar in the E Street Band if 
Springsteen hadn't preferred Nils Lofgren. His consolation prize seems 
to be that he's emerging as Bruce's favorite jamming soulmate.<br>
<br>
December 7: Along with Paul Simon, Harry Belafonte and others, he 
attends a Carnegie Hall, NY, tribute to late political folkie Harry 
Chapin, strums one of his songs, 'Remember When The Music', and recalls 
Chapin trying to enlist him for some forgotten cause: "Harry said, You 
know, I play one night for me, one night for the other guy. And later 
on, when I was trying to put my music to some pragmatic use, I 
remembered what he said. Not being bent on extremism, I was not as 
generous as he was. And now we live in times that are pretty shattered… 
And you kinda sit back, not cynically but truthfully, and say, well, 
maybe all men are not brothers. Maybe we'll never know who or what we 
are to each other."<br>
<br>
December 13: At a Madison Square Garden, NY, benefit for homeless 
children organised by Paul Simon, Springsteen joins backing vocalists 
including Billy Joel, Lou Reed and James Taylor for Dion's ''Teenager In
 Love', then introduces his acoustic 'Born To Run' with a version of a 
homily he will soon deploy around America and the world: "I wrote this 
song about 15 years ago. It's about a boy and a girl that thought they 
wanted to run and keep running and never stop. And at the time I thought
 that was me and maybe it was. But I woke up one morning and realised 
that I wanted a home. And nobody wants or deserves to be homeless."<br>
<br>
December 25: Springsteen calls E Street Band drummer Max Weinberg and 
tells him to get ready to tour. Whether he said "Happy Christmas" too is
 not recorded.<br>
<br>
1988<br>
<br>
January: Six weeks of rehearsals begin.<br>
<br>
January 20: At the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame awards ceremony held at 
the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, NYC, Springsteen delivers Bob Dylan's 
induction speech. He says: "The first time that I heard Bob Dylan I was 
in the car with my mother and on came that snare shot that sounded like 
somebody'd kicked open the door to your mind – 'Like A Rolling Stone' 
... Bob's voice somehow thrilled and scared me, it made me feel kind of 
irresponsibly innocent and it still does ... The way that Elvis freed 
your body, Bob freed your mind and showed us that just because the music
 was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellect."<br>
<br>
February 25: The Tunnel Of Love tour opens at The Centrum in Worcester, 
Massachusetts, like all the American venues an arena (i.e. capacity up 
to around 20,000) rather than a stadium. Springsteen plays for just over
 three hours and includes eight of the intimate songs from Tunnel Of 
Love. Some old favourites like 'Backstreets', 'Jungleland' and 'Thunder 
Road' are missing.<br>
<br>
February 28: The second Worcester concert and Springsteen talks to a 
couple of journalists in his dressing room: "I just felt I'd have to 
drop all the cornerstones of my set. You just can't come out and push 
people's buttons with old songs. I was interested in personalising my 
music. You have to re-invent yourself… My writing tends to get easier as
 I've gotten older because I tend to be more open to it and less afraid 
of it, less afraid of what's going to come out. The only trick to 
writing a new song is you have to have a new idea. And to have a new 
idea, you've got to be a bit of a new person."<br>
<br>
April 1: Nassau Coliseum, N.Y., and Bruce is feeling bolshie. "Don't 
vote for that fucking Bush!" he robustly advises at one point.<br>
<br>
April 5: Second night at the Capitol Centre, Andover, Maryland, and 
there's a handwritten note on perfumed vellum waiting in Springsteen's 
dressing room when he comes offstage. It's from Fawn Hall, notorious as 
Oliver North's document-shredding secretary in the Contragate affair, 
and a friend of Rob Lowe since her celebrity came through. Her 
peremptory epistle reads: "I'm Fawn Hall. I'd like to meet you." 
Springsteen writes back: "I don't like you, I don't like your boss, I 
don't like what you did. Thank you."<br>
<br>
May 2: Springsteen's parents Douglas and Adele, who moved from Freehold,
 N.J., to the San Francisco area when he was 17, attend both shows at 
the Shoreline Amphitheater near Palo Alto. The first night he dedicates 
'Walk Like A Man' from Tunnel Of Love to his father with a quiet "This 
one's for you, pops" and sings it, hair-raisingly, straight at him.<br>
<br>
That same day, Peter Gabriel has flown into San Francisco intent on 
persuading Springsteen to join the putative Amnesty International 
all-star world tour he's been hatching for a year with Al America's 
Executive Director Jack Healey. He watches the set, then goes backstage.
 Not a pushy sort, he doesn't get all the way through the security net, 
but finds himself on the band bus, spots Landau, plonks down beside him 
and pitches as hard as natural reticence and politeness will permit 
throughout the hour's drive back to the hotel. At the end of it, he's 
not sure whether he's made any impression.<br>
<br>
May 3: Second show at the Shoreline and tonight's favoured female 
invited up for the statutory spot of on stage frugging during 'Dancing 
In The Dark' is none other than Bruce's mum. As they boogaloo through 
the middle eight, Bruce confides, "I learnt all my moves from my ma." 
This is no great surprise to connoisseurs of Springsteen-style 
rug-cutting.<br>
<br>
May 16: Wizened TV sex therapist Dr Ruth gets backstage at the first of 
five Madison Square Garden concerts and tells Bruce, "I like what you 
say about love and sex, but there's one more thing you need to include 
in your show — contraception." His response: "Gee, it's gonna be tough 
to get the word contraception into a song."<br>
<br>
May 19: Amnesty's Jack Healey spends the afternoon at MSG discussing the
 practicalities of the AI tour with Landau and Springsteen's booking 
agent Frank Barsalona. He's asked to talk to the artist alone after the 
show. He says, "I go into this long room and there's Bruce, very tired 
with a terry cloth on him and he just said, tell me about human rights. 
So I blithered on for 50 minutes, giving it my best shot. He just stared
 the whole time and didn't say a word apart from two questions: one was 
about American Indians and the other was about refugees. At the end he 
said, Well, what can I do? I swallowed hard and said, You have to do the
 whole tour. He just said, OK, whatever it takes. I'll be there. I was 
overcome and, being Irish, I leapt on him, hugged him and he started 
crying."<br>
<br>
May 23: Last night of the 37-date American tour.<br>
<br>
May 26: The London tabloids are preparing a welcome for him. The Sun 
carries the first report, based on quotes from a New York barman who 
claims to have served Springsteen several beers, that Bruce and Julianne
 have split up "because she wouldn't give him a baby".<br>
<br>
June 2: The Sun reports Springsteen spotted on "a bender" with Bono in 
Los Angeles following a stressful "heart to heart" with Julianne.<br>
<br>
June 11: The European tour — significantly, stadium-based — opens at the Stadio Communale, Turin.<br>
<br>
June 13: At 3am in Rome Springsteen strolls into the Piaza Di Spagna 
with Patti Scialfa, Jersey Girl, E Street backing singer and, of late, 
rhythm guitarist. The place is deserted apart from a few hippies on the 
Spanish Steps still sharing a cosmic thought or two. Bruce asks if he 
might borrow a guitar and delivers himself of a fervent 'I'm On Fire' 
and a moody 'The River', then wanders on.<br>
<br>
June 15: With Springsteen playing in Rome still, but due in England the 
following week, The Sun caps all the gossip with an "Exclusive" boasting
 "The pictures that will cost The Boss £75 million" (that is, half 
Springsteen's estimated wealth should said snaps lead to Julianne 
divorcing him). The telephoto snaps in question are blurred, yet 
unmistakably show Springsteen standing on a Rome hotel balcony with 
Patti Scialfa and kissing her on a poolside lounger. His management 
refuse, and will continue to refuse, any comment about his marriage.<br>
<br>
June 20: The Sun greets his arrival in England with a story, billed as a
 "Sun World Exclusive", but actually rehashing the year-old lawsuit by 
roadies Batlin and Sutphin, which has begun to wend its way through the 
American courts. For the remainder of his week-long stay the tabloids 
are aflutter and agog with the saga of his marriage. "Friends" of 
Julianne are now allegedly leaking quotes about it being all over 
because of the Rome pictures "flaunting" his relationship with Patti.<br>
<br>
The Daily Express claims to have talked with Patti, who allegedly 
enlightens them with the following insightful quote: "Bruce is great. 
He's the Boss!"<br>
<br>
July 3: Part of the second Stockholm show is broadcast live to 20 
countries. Springsteen uses the occasion to announce the Amnesty Human 
Rights Now! tour. And somehow Britt Ekland gets on stage as a backing 
singer during his 'You Can Look' routine.<br>
<br>
July 10: With Springsteen back in England to play two dates in 
Sheffield, The People reports that Julianne refuses to comment on claims
 that, in the absence of the standard superstar "prenuptial agreement" 
limiting the wife's claims in the event of a marriage breakdown, she is 
asking £18 million for a "quickie" divorce. Other sums mentioned in the 
ensuing months are a £20 million lump sum plus £3,000 a week, £15/£12/ 
£6-1/2 and £3 million. At the same time, Springsteen's "fortune" is 
stated to be worth anything from £20 to £300 million. Whatever the deal,
 it is always assumed to be attached to a binding promise of no 
"kiss-and-tell" book to follow. Julianne has also landed a couple of 
promising movie roles, one with Chevy Chase in Fletch Lives.<br>
<br>
July 19: About 150,000 assemble at Weissensee cycling track in East 
Berlin for a concert arranged two weeks' notice after Springsteen's 
management told the city authorities he would like to play there. The 
show is slotted in as a more than auspicious start to a previously 
arranged Nicaragua solidarity festival, with proceeds going to the Karl 
Marx Hospital, Managua.<br>
<br>
East German radio broadcasts two hours of the show later that night and 
the unreconstructed old guard are paying attention. When Springsteen 
introduces Dylan's 'Chimes Of Freedom' by saying in German, "I am not 
here today in support of, or opposition to, any government. I'm here to 
play some rock 'n' roll music for East Berliners in the hope that 
someday all the barriers between us will be torn down", the second 
sentence is cut.<br>
<br>
July 23: An hour after Springsteen arrives in Copenhagen, he goes out 
for an afternoon amble near his hotel and passes a young busker, one 
John Magnusson, who is regaling an audience of two with his version of 
'The River'. Magnusson stops, gapes, then calls out, "Hey Bruce!" 
Springsteens comes over, borrows his guitar, duets 'The River' with him,
 then piles into 'I'm On Fire' and 'Dancing In The Dark'. As the crowd 
grows, Springsteen hugs Magnusson and strides briskly away. A tourist 
catches the scene on his camcorder and flogs it to Danish TV.<br>
<br>
August 3: The European tour closes at the Nou Camp football stadium in Barcelona.<br>
<br>
August 21: Springsteen drops into The Stone Pony, has a few beers, sits 
in for a couple of numbers with house band Cats On A Smooth Surface.<br>
<br>
September 1: As the Human Rights Now! tour is launched in London, the 
morning papers report that Julianne is filing for divorce after she and 
Bruce "burnt up the telephone lines trying to hash out our future".<br>
<br>
With the other artists, Springsteen undergoes his first press 
conference. He has his Amnesty position prepared — "Rock'n'roll can 
offer a transcendent moment of freedom" — but he refuses to answer 
questions about his marriage.<br>
<br>
September 2: Closing the Wembley concert, Springsteen presents 15 songs 
(including the E Street Band backing the entire company on 'Chimes Of 
Freedom') which reflect his return to 'Born In The USA' and other 
stadium-friendly material on the European tour. This, incidentally, 
thrusts The Big Man, sax legend Clarence Clemons, centrestage (to his 
obvious joy) while relegating Patti Scialfa to the backline.<br>
<br>
September 10: Before the Barcelona concert Springsteen talks to 
Amnesty's tour reporter. He says, "My band's happier than they've been 
in years, but one of the reasons I wanted to do this was because I 
wanted to work with other artists. I haven't toured with any other bands
 since I was 24. I wanted to work in a collective of some sort. I wanted
 to get in with a bunch of people who had an idea and subsume my 
identity into that idea, into that collective, and try to come out with 
something that's more meaningful and bigger and better than I could do 
on my own."<br>
<br>
September 15: When Sting comes on to duet 'The River', Springsteen, who 
first met him less than a month before, describes him as "my best 
friend, a man of bizarre sexual perversity". Then, for 'Dancing In The 
Dark' he hauls a man up onstage to boogie with him. Bruce-watchers 
ruminate gloomily about the number of earrings he's wearing these days 
(about six).<br>
<br>
September 18: In Philadelphia, Springsteen is asked whether the artists 
are educating one another about the politics of the countries they 
visit. He says: "Well, Sting once said he knew the answer to every 
question. In fact, between sets he tutors me on what's wrong with my 
music."<br>
<br>
September 30: Learning that the New Delhi concert has been presented by 
sponsoring newspaper The Times Of India as, primarily, a celebration of 
their 150th anniversary, Springsteen tells the journalists, "We didn't 
come all this way for a birthday party!"<br>
<br>
October 7: In Harare, Zimbabwe, fans spot Springsteen in a record shop buying cassettes of a dozen African albums.<br>
<br>
Introducing Edwin Starr's 'War', he addresses the estimated 15,000 white
 South Africans in the crowd, comparing conscription into their army 
with conscription into the Vietnam War, and concludes, "There can be no 
peace without justice and where there is apartheid — systematic as in 
your country or economic as in mine — there is no justice, there is only
 war."<br>
<br>
October 8: Flying into Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Springsteen is still full 
of last night's show: "Unfortunately, most of the audiences I draw in 
the US are white. In Harare I had my first chance to play to an 
integrated audience. Looking out and seeing black hands raised with 
white hands was a very emotional moment for me."<br>
<br>
October 15: Human Rights Now! concludes in Buenos Aires, having flown 
35,000 miles to play to a million people. Because of technical 
difficulties, a seven-hour live worldwide radio broadcast includes only 
100 minutes of music (less than half Springsteen's set) and is padded 
with interviews and ads for tour sponsor Reebok and Trojan condoms.<br>
<br>
Springsteen tells the final press conference, "This tour was about 
trying to assert myself as a world citizen. As a boy all I knew of 
Africa and India and South America was what I studied in geography 
class. And I wasn't a very good student. The end of this tour marks my 
graduation of sorts. And I hope that I'll be able to go back to home 
and, in my music, write about a different sensibility that I felt. And I
 hope to get American young people out of their shell."<br>
<br>
November 26: In San Francisco to visit his parents for Thanksgiving, 
Springsteen pays a small hours visit to the Stone club and joins 
Southside Johnny &amp; the Jukes, now resident in California, onstage 
for the first time since 1982 — 'In The Midnight Hour', 'Little Queenie'
 and so on.<br>
<br>
December: The year closes with gossip rife and Springsteen lying low 
after probably the hardest year of his life. The first stage of the 
divorce is said to have been completed, the decree absolute to follow in
 March. The Sun avers that the relationship with "gorgeous girlfriend 
Patti, 22" (going on 36, that is) is supposed to be over because she's 
looked for a pay rise. Robert Stigwood claims to be offering him £10 
million to play Che, opposite Meryl Streep, in the movie of Rice-Lloyd 
Webbers Evita.<br>
<br>
1989<br>
<br>
January: Springsteen is seen in a Los Angeles studio, possibly working 
on Patti Scialfa's planned solo album but also recording demos for 
himself, they say. The Bruce Watch dream of an autumn release.<br>
<br>
January 18: At the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame, as ever, he sings 
'Crying' in tribute to Roy Orbison, who died just before Christmas, then
 jams with Jagger and Richards, plus Patti, original E Street drummer 
"Mad Dog" Lopez, and George Theiss, a member of his first band the 
Castiles, founded in 1965.<br>
<br>
March: The roadies' case inches forward. A New Jersey judge refuses 
Batlin and Sutphin's damages claim for "emotional distress" but says 
their case on unpaid overtime has to be answered.<br>
<br>
March 10: After an early evening party for former world champion boxer 
Ray "Boom Boom" Mancini, Springsteen moves on to Rubber, an L.A. club 
owned by Mickey Rourke. He plays 'CC Rider' with local bar band the 
Mighty Hornets. Meanwhile, the tabloids have Bruce and Patti about to 
marry, with Rourke as best man.<br>
<br>
April: While sporadic studio activity continues in California, 
Springsteen's management take on the Parents' Music Resource Centre, the
 campaigners who have caused many American records to be stickered with 
warnings about their unsuitability for youthful consumption. They have 
released a video quoting Springsteen as saying, supportively, "In many 
ways what's happening in music today is very corrupting. Let's help our 
children toss out the garbage".<br>
<br>
They say they read the quote in Reader's Digest. The Digest say they 
took it from Rolling Stone. But they're wrong. It didn't exist. Reader's
 Digest apologises. PMRC re-edit their video.<br>
<br>
June 2: Max Weinberg asks Springsteen to play with his jumpin' 
jive-style big band Killer Joe to support the annual Jersey Shore Jazz 
&amp; Blues Festival at the Stone Pony. It's part of an effort to revive
 the local music scene — the Asbury Park Rock'n'Roll Museum and Palace 
Amusements, home of the original "Tunnel Of Love", have recently closed 
and the Pony itself is under threat from municipal redevelopment. They 
blast through to the early morning, ably assisted by Patti and E Street 
keyboardist Roy Bittan.<br>
<br>
Nobody is aware of it, but this is the start of what becomes known as 
The Summer Club Tour '89. For three months Springsteen is everywhere, 
"guesting" 20 times. He'll not only sit in with the band of the night, 
but hang out for as long as socially feasible, quaffing his share of 
Heinekens and the occasional "kamikaze" vodka cocktail.<br>
<br>
June 20: After jamming with Nils Lofgren's band at the Stone Pony, Neil 
Young on Long Island, and singing Elvis's 'Loving You' at a friend's 
wedding over the previous couple of weeks, Springsteen takes a neighbour
 down to Martell's at Point Pleasant because Bobby Bandiera's on. 
Bandiera plays Kansas City and Bruce is up there.<br>
<br>
However, Martell's management can't resist running an ad in the local 
paper "thanking" him for dropping in — and that's the last they ever see
 of him.<br>
<br>
July 2: At the Cafe Bar, Long Branch, NJ — a township where he inhabited
 a scuzzy apartment in his late teens —it's Springsteen's fourth night 
out on the trot following guest spots with school fête mates the 
Fabulous Greaseband at the Headliner in Neptune, Jackson Browne in the 
unlikely setting of an Atlantic City casino, and former Miami Horn La 
Bamba at the Pony. This one's an offputting affair, though, because when
 he joins Gary 'US' Bonds, a man whose career he had resurrected in the 
early '80s, the audience gets over enthusiastic. After a rousing New 
Orleans, a speaker stack collapses and Springsteen does a runner for the
 safety of one and all.<br>
<br>
July 22: Jamming 'Twist And Shout' and 'Gloria' with local combo Peter 
Hartung &amp; the Remake at the Rumrunner, the nearest hostelry to his 
Rumson home, Bruce peers at the somewhat yuppified Lacoste-clad 
clientele and bawls, "I'm gonna rock the crocs right offa your shirts!"<br>
<br>
July 23: Bruce in excelsis at the Pony. He dances all night with Patti 
and anyone else who'll shake a leg with him, then grabs the vocal mike 
from Cats On A Smooth Surface and finishes 'Old Time Rock'n'Roll' from 
the floor before taking the stage for an extended set of golden oldies.<br>
<br>
August 11: At the Garden State Arts Centre at Holmdel (the town where 
Bruce recorded Nebraska in a day) Ringo's All Starr Band, which sports 
Clarence Clemons and Nils Lofgren as regulars, are joined by Weinberg, 
Bittan and Springsteen for 'Get Back', 'Long Tall Sally', 'Photograph' 
and 'With A Little Help From Friends'.<br>
<br>
August 16: Back for a second night at the microscopic Cheers bar in Long
 Branch, Springsteen plays a longish set with Bandiera, but he looks so 
preoccupied the audience wonder why he's bothering. The long, hot summer
 seems to have run its course.<br>
<br>
September 13-14: He records 'Viva Las Vegas' for The Last Temptation Of 
Elvis, a Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy benefit album organised by Roy 
Carr of NME, at One On One Studio, North Hollywood. He's backed by 
former Face Ian McLagan (keyboards) and session stars Bob Glaub (bass) 
and Jeff Porcaro (drums).<br>
<br>
September 23: Over in New Jersey again, a comprehensively-bombed Bruce 
celebrates his 40 the birthday at the Rumrunner with the E Street Band 
and Little Steven too. His parents are over from the West Coast. He 
dances with his mother, his Uncle Warren features on back-up vocals and 
nobody at the time gives a thought to the possibility that this maybe 
the E Street Band's last gig. When he stumbles into Glory Days, 
Springsteen declares: "I dedicate this song to to me! I may be 40 years 
old but, dammit, I'm still handsome."<br>
<br>
September 29: Prescott, Arizona — a small township between Flagstaff and
 Phoenix — has one of its less predictable days. About lunchtime four 
bikers, followed by a mobile home, pull up at a diner and order some 
Cokes. The odd thing is that one of them is a stubbly, heavy-jowled 
Bruce Springsteen. After a while he asks where he might find "some biker
 girls" and is directed to Matt's Saloon on Whiskey Row.<br>
<br>
He walks over and strikes up a conversation with the 
extensively-tattooed — in fact, just extensive — barmaid Brenda 
"Bubbles" Pechanec, lately hitched for the eighth time as he soon 
learns. Naturally, there's a house band… he joins them in trashing 
'Don't Be Cruel', 'Route 66' and 'I'm On Fire'. "I'm here in Prescott to
 take Bubbles away and be her ninth!" he boilers, then cries off a 
request for 'Pink Cadillac' on the grounds that he's forgotten the 
words.<br>
<br>
In due course, most of Prescott is making for Matt's. The little saloon 
starts to implode. Springsteen clambers over the bar, then steps smartly
 out the back way, mounts his silver and blue Harley Davidson and speeds
 off down Highway 89 with mates/minders in his wake.<br>
<br>
A few weeks later Bubbles has tangible proof that it wasn't a dream or 
an impostor. She's suffering from stomach cancer and has impossible 
medical bills of around $100,000. Springsteen office calls and asks for 
details. Soon the hospital turns a small cheque she has sent, explaining
 that her account has been settled in full.<br>
<br>
November 13: US magazines People and Newsweek print a story leaked from 
somewhere in the Springsteen organisation that the E Street Band have 
been told their services are no longer required. It's been talked about 
before, but now it's true, at least for the time being. Bruce has rung 
each of them to say they should "feel free to accept other offers".<br>
<br>
In the usual absence of anything illuminating from Jon Landau's office, E
 Streeters are pursued for their reactions. Mostly, discretion rules. 
Lofgren says: "Right now Bruce is just a little… he's searching. He's 
allowed to be confused."<br>
<br>
But Clemons is less guarded: "That phone call made me go from being very
 shocked, to being angry, to happy, all in about ten seconds. Now I'm 
over it, though. I've been constantly in a shadow. I wasn't playing what
 I wanted to hear. My diminishing role in his music had me crazy. He was
 getting away from that sound, from the saxophone."<br>
<br>
Regardless, every member of the band — apart from the enigmatic 
"Phantom" Danny Federici, the other keyboard player — is engaged in 
other enterprises anyway, though with diverse levels of success: Clemons
 and Lofgren have their own solo careers, neither prospering currently; 
Roy Bittan is a session star; bassman Garry Tallent is re-established in
 Nashville as a producer; Weinberg has a fun band, a sideline as a 
rock'n'roller on the lecture circuit, has just completed a degree in 
communications and is starting a law course.<br>
<br>
December 17: Clarence and his Red Bank Rockers play a small theatre in 
Ventura, California, and suddenly they're a hot ticket — Jackson Browne,
 Daryl Hannah and Springsteen, wintering in the West again, form a queue
 to sit in. Between 'Glory Days' and 'Cadillac Ranch', Clemons plays a 
doubtless pointed instrumental called 'Forgiveness'.<br>
<br>
January 15: It's officially announced that Patti is pregnant and the couple "overjoyed".<br>
<br>
January 17: Springsteen, hair grown long and occasionally tied back in a
 pony tail, faithfully turns out for the Hall Of Fame bash. He and Patti
 share a table with Sting. Bruce plays with former Creedence Clearwater 
leader John Fogerty, then takes a hand in the all-star massacre of 'Long
 Tall Sally', his favourite bar jam of '89.<br>
<br>
February: He works for two weeks in Studio City in L.A., with drummer 
Steve Jordan and bass Randy Jackson, session aristocrats. Among 15 
tracks supposedly recorded, one title breaks the surface, 'Just Another 
Roll Of The Dice', but nobody's claiming to have heard so much as a bar 
of it. Little Steven's bandanas are often to be seen hung out to dry on a
 balcony at L.A.'S best known rock'n'roll hotel, the Sunset Marquis — 
he's thought to be in there pitching on production.<br>
<br>
February 12: Springsteen joins Sting's "most expensive garage band in 
the world" at a high price benefit for his (since rather discredited) 
rainforest charity. With Paul Simon, Don Henley and Jackson Browne, they
 take turns in offering a greatest hit or two to 900 Hollywood 
glitterati assembled in a tent in the grounds of movie producer Ted 
Fields' house. With tickets at £1,000-£50,000, depending on corporate 
status, more than a million is raised. Then the rock'n'rollers repair to
 a gig called the China Club and do it all again. By chance, Joe Walsh 
is there and insists on a Rocky Mountain Way workout.<br>
<br>
March: Roy Bittan is around, and Sting is reported to be involved in the
 studio, perhaps co-writing with Springsteen. But the Bruce Watch are 
not convinced. His collaborations rarely see the light of day (even the 
tracks he is believed to have recorded with his beloved Orbison late in 
'88 remained under wraps).<br>
<br>
March 1: At the Inglewood Forum, California, Tom Petty introduces his 
old sparring partner Bob Dylan who does 'Rainy Day Women'. Then 
Springsteen joins them for a couple of songs before he and Dylan 
withdraw arm in arm.<br>
<br>
April: Album rumours pick up speed. The lyrics are overtly political. 
David Sancious' mum bumps into a Bruce Watcher on the Shore and says her
 boy, an early E Streeter, is recording with Springsteen after they met 
again on the Amnesty tour when Sancious played keyboards for Peter 
Gabriel. Little Feat piano man Bill Payne is another name widely 
canvassed.<br>
<br>
Bruce and Patti are guests at producer Chuck Plotkin's wedding 
(Springsteen duets with Tom Waits on his song 'Jersey Girl', the cover 
version of which closes the Live box), and then at a special showing of 
Born On The Fourth Of July, to which they have been invited by Ron 
Kovic, author of the original book and the real-life character Tom 
Cruise played. Springsteen has often talked about Kovic when introducing
 'Born In The USA' and they have become friends.<br>
<br>
April 30: In London, the Mirror claims Springsteen has bought a £10 
million estate in West L.A. with two large houses, a lot of 200-foot 
tall eucalyptus trees, and no pool or tennis court.<br>
<br>
May: The latest hearing in the readies case rules that Springsteen's tax
 records are not to be placed "in the public domain" as Batlin and 
Sutphin's lawyers have requested. Now, in addition to the unpaid 
overtime question, they claim that a promise to keep their pay "just 
behind the musicians'" was not honoured. Springsteen's lawyers say the 
two were paid $225,000 in ex gratia severance when they left his employ 
in 1985.<br>
<br>
June: Springsteen gives hardline rap group 2 Live Crew permission to 
sample 'Born In The USA' for their single 'Banned In The USA', a protest
 against the way they are being censored at the behest of people like 
the PMRC.<br>
<br>
August: Baby due at press time. Album due in October? Tour due next year…?<br>

<br>
Richard Williams, Times, The, 5 July 1985<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen: Wembley Stadium, London<br>
<br>
London always gets something special from Bruce Springsteen. In 1975, 
when he was still a promising but marginal figure, it was where he found
 himself confronted for the first time by the hard sell that record 
companies sometimes inflict on their contracted artists. The lesson was 
taken to heart. On his return, six years later, he tore into Wembley 
Arena like a man bent on exorcism, as if London was where he had to 
prove to himself, and to the world, that he had achieved success without
 compromising the integrity that he works so hard to define, and by 
which he stands or falls.<br>
<br>
On Wednesday evening, in the vastness of Wembley Stadium, he chose a 
rare moment of calm towards the end of his three-hour concert to remind 
his 72,000 listeners of the importance he attaches to that historic 
relationship. It was one of several signs that, despite his new status 
as the tabloid newspapers’ favourite pop sensation, he continues to 
respond primarily to the whisper of his conscience.<br>
<br>
There had, after all, been plenty of scope for doubt. Was Born in the 
USA not too calculated a simplification of his virtues? Who among his 
old admirers had not been dismayed by the announcement that his 1985 
British tour would consist only of stadium concerts? Could it not be 
said, in fact, that the past year had been the story of a sell far 
harder than anything attempted in 1975?<br>
<br>
Perhaps in pop music there are no alternatives. Perhaps the only thing 
to be is more popular than you were last year. At the end of the first 
hour on Wednesday, as Springsteen and the E Street Band took their 
customary break, the sun was bright, the temperature high and the crowd 
cheerful, yet for all but the few hundred crushed closest to the stage 
there was no feeling of true engagement at all.<br>
<br>
Only a brand-new song, a steel-braced road narrative called ‘Seeds’, had
 illuminated a set otherwise deficient in surprise and zest. No, this 
was just another rock ‘n’ roll picnic, just another hot ticket. It was 
like Wimbledon: you see more on the television, and you don’t get your 
pocket picked.<br>
<br>
Then the second half began and, as the shadow of the stadium rim crept 
across the field, he began to enfold us in his magic. Where even 
‘Thunder Road’ had sounded coarse and perfunctory, now ‘Hungry Heart’ 
and ‘Rosalita’ shouted their joy to the darkening sky. Prefaced by a 
heartfelt retelling of his old Elvis story, the first batch of encores 
came and went in a rush. For the final gallop, ending with ‘Twist and 
Shout’, he was joined by his former lieutenant, Steve Van Zandt, whose 
humorous presence had been missed.<br>
<br>
Now the promise was being fulfilled, the contract kept, the stadium 
reduced to the dimensions of a club. Now even those in the far distance 
could forget the way the ropy sound lagged behind the image on the great
 video screens. But – bigger? louder? brighter? – what happens next?<br>

<br>
Phil Sutcliffe, Q, February 1995<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen, Rock Orator, on Life, Love, Art and everything<br>
<br>
The world of rock is not blessed with fine public speakers. It’s not the
 pop star’s game. Naturally, they don’t want to address you, they want 
to sing to you. For most, on stage, the occasional hiatus while roadies 
scuttle to fix a miscreant monitor or wonky widget is a source of 
stomach-knotting embarrassment. Their heads drop. Eye contact is 
avoided. After a bit, they really think they should say something. And 
they do. They say, "Uhhhh... well, it’s, you know like...", and turn 
away again. It’s the same at awards ceremonies. Even though, in this 
instance, the call to say a few words means good news, the oratorical 
peaks which tower above the clouded foothills of "Uhhhh... thanks" are 
rarely ascended.<br>
<br>
But Bruce Springsteen is different. He is the great rhetorician of 
rock’n’roll, the sole superstar who can be as well understood and even 
enjoyed through what he’s said to multitudinous audiences the world over
 as through what he’s sung. His heart, soul and intellect are in regular
 communication and after the striking set-piece tributes he’s paid to 
Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan and John Fogerty at the Hall Of Fame inductions, 
he’s the man every other rock legend would like to be praised by when 
it’s their turn to pick up a lifetime achievement award – or even, in 
the fullness, to be buried with full rock’n’roll honours.<br>
<br>
Driven by some unanalysed instinct to explain, engage, plain hunker down
 and talk it over, Springsteen has been "rapping" on stage for as long 
as any Bossly historian can remember. Certain songs, at various points 
in his career have evidently carried the necessity of public confession,
 yarn spinning or a mixture of both. It used to be 'Growin’ Up' and 
'Born To Run'. From the mid-’80s on, 'My Hometown' held the key to his 
compulsion.<br>
<br>
Nearly always, he begin "When I was young..." or "When I was a kid..." 
There was the boy Springsteen, his guitar, his parents. But with his 
large-spirited sense of common-man universality, perhaps mingled with a 
more egocentric will to wrap a fondly controlling embrace round as much 
of humanity as, with all mod cons, he could possibly reach, after a few 
years the downhome stories were obviously bumping up against wider 
issues and demanding that bigger ideas be expressed, conclusions essayed
 that could only be described as political.<br>
<br>
His first acknowledgment that this was happening was his appearance at 
the MUSE No Nukes concerts in 1979. However, that night he conspicuously
 just sang and said nothing at all. He took one of his first critical 
drubbings for his reticence. But this was just a staging post, it turned
 out, part of a struggle for confidence.<br>
<br>
He was blue-collar through and through. He’s loathed school and learnt 
nothing. But he was very wary of writing or talking in ignorance. He 
hated the thought of making a fool of himself and debasing the currency 
of the home truths he did know and portray with such conviction. So, 
advised by his Ivy League graduate manager and mentor Jon Landau, he had
 set about acquiring knowledge. Films, novels, histories. He studied and
 started telling stadiums full of people how this new information fitted
 with his own experience.<br>
<br>
Across America, he spoke up for local food banks and industrial 
strikers, against the maltreatment of Vietnam veterans and migrant 
workers. His attitude was seemingly either inspired by or just 
instinctively in line with Roosevelt’s New Deal, and his easy way of 
talking to gatherings of up to 100,000 fans at a time hinted at the 
homespun mastery of FDR’s radio "fireside chats". In interviews at the 
time he often used the possibly Landau-crafted phrase "the need for 
connection". He fulfilled it with what he called "the Loud Noise" – and 
the quiet word.<br>
<br>
And because what Springsteen was about was so verbal itself, the 
Brucewatching critical analyses became very rich indeed. Robert Hilburn,
 of the LA Times, saw him defining "the struggle in life between 
disillusionment and dreams". Dave Marsh, of Rolling Stone, suggested 
that Springsteen’s unprecedented approach was "a refutation of the idea 
that rock was anarchic rebellion. If anything his shows were a 
masterwork of crowd control, an adventure in pure co-operation, a 
challenge to chaos."<br>
<br>
Well, Dylan made it okay to think about rock – as Springsteen said in 
his Hall Of Fame tribute – and these comments are not daft just because 
they’re high-flown. Springsteen was up for it. He took it all on with a 
big, American emotionality. For most of the ’80s, at least, his style 
had few detractors even in Britain, where the alleged natural reserve 
might have deemed him more than a tad OTT (but then the impassioned 
humanism of Hill Street Blues found a fervent UK response during the 
same period).<br>
<br>
But, of late, Springsteen’s standing and stature has been questioned 
more than ever before. Unloved albums, marriage ructions, even the 
obscure uproar of "the roadies case" encouraged the erstwhile faithful 
to minute examination of the great man, great spirit. Even an 
arch-supporter like Charles Cross of Backstreets fanzine has wondered 
how far Springsteen’s public story has been revised and rephrased by 
Landau. The lines between reality, realism and myth-making, previously 
straddled with ease through sheer force of the artist’s personality and 
imagination, could now be seen by the committed as intellectually 
crotch-threatening razor-wire fences.<br>
<br>
And the matter of belief is very important to all but the most casual 
Springsteen followers. As Hilburn put it, "The important thing about 
Bruce isn’t that he makes you believe in rock and roll or himself. He 
makes you believe in yourself." Then, if you stop believing...<br>
<br>
Still, probably, this is just another phase his reputation’s going 
through. The humanist humanised to human size. The kind of believability
 that has not very much to do with factual accuracy does run straight 
through Springsteen’s music, performance, lyrics and spoken words.<br>
<br>
As he said in his thankyou speech when last year’s Oscar committee 
declared 'Streets Of Philadelphia' the Best Original Song In A Movie: 
"You do your best work and you hope that it pulls out the best in your 
audience and some piece of it spills over into the real world and into 
people’s everyday lives. And it takes the edge off fear and allows us to
 recognise each other through our veil of differences. I always thought 
that was one of the things popular art was supposed to be about, along 
with the merchandising and all the other stuff."<br>
<br>
<br>
*<br>
<br>
ROCK N ROLL<br>
From the speech inducting Bob Dylan into the Rock’N’Roll Hall Of Fame, Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York, January 20, 1988:<br>
<br>
"The first time I heard Bob Dylan, I was in the car with my mother and 
we were listening to, I think, WMCA, and on came that snare shot that 
sounded like somebody’d kicked open the door to your mind – 'Like A 
Rolling Stone'. And my mother, she was no stiff with rock’n’roll, she 
used to like the music, she listened, she sat there for a minute and she
 looked at me and said, That guy can’t sing. But I knew she was wrong, 
you know. I sat there and I didn’t say nothin’, but I knew that I was 
listening to the toughest voice that I had ever heard. It was lean and 
it sounded somehow simultaneously young and adult.<br>
<br>
"And I ran out and I bought the single. Then I went out and I got 
Highway 61 and that was all I played for weeks; looked at the cover with
 Bob in that satin blue jacket and the Triumph motorcycle shirt.<br>
<br>
"And when I was a kid, Bob’s voice somehow thrilled and scared me; it 
made me feel kind of irresponsibly innocent – and it still does – when 
it reached down and touched what little worldliness a 15-year-old kid in
 high school in New Jersey had in him at the time. Dylan – he was a 
revolutionary. The way that Elvis freed your body, Bob freed your mind 
and showed us that just because the music was innately physical did not 
mean that it was anti-intellect. And he changed the face of rock’n’roll 
for ever and ever.<br>
<br>
"That’s all the nice things I have to say tonight. Now, about three 
months ago, I was watching TV and the Rolling Stone Special came on and 
Bob came on and he was in a real cranky mood. He was kind of bitchin’ 
and moanin’ about how his fans don’t know him and nobody knows him, that
 they come up to him on the street and treat him like a long lost 
brother or something. And speaking as a fan, when I was 15 and I heard 
'Like A Rolling Stone', I heard a guy like I’d never heard before, a guy
 that had the guts to take on the whole world and make me feel like I 
had to too."<br>
<br>
<br>
*<br>
<br>
From the speech inducting Creedence Clearwater Revival into The Rock And
 Roll Hall of Fame, Century Plaza Hotel, Los Angeles, January 12, 1993.<br>
"In 1970 suburban New Jersey was still filled with the kind of ’60s 
spirit Easy Rider made us all so fond of. I’m referring to the scene 
where Dennis Hopper gets blown off his motorcycle by some redneck with a
 shotgun! A weekend outing at the time was still filled with the drama 
of possibly getting your ass kicked by a total stranger who disagreed 
with your fashion sense.<br>
<br>
"Me and my band worked on Route 35 outside of Asbury Park, at a club 
called the Pandemonium. And so it was five 50-minute sets a night and 
rarely a night without a fight. We played behind a U-shaped bar that was
 just three feet and spitting distance from many of the patrons who came
 to just drink and stare and hassle the band.<br>
<br>
"Into New Jersey came the music of John and Tom Fogerty, Doug Clifford 
and Stu Cook – Creedence Clearwater Revival – and for three minutes and 
seven seconds of 'Proud Mary' a very strained brotherhood would actually
 fill the room. It was simply a great song that everybody liked and it 
literally saved our asses on many occasions.<br>
<br>
"Anyway I stand here tonight still envious of that music’s power and 
simplicity. And they were hits, and hitsville was reality and poetry and
 a sense of the darkness of events and history, of an American tradition
 shot through with pride, fear, paranoia – and they rocked hard.<br>
<br>
"Now you can’t talk about Creedence without talking about John Fogerty. 
On the fashion front, all of Seattle should bow. John was the father of 
the flannel shirt. And as a songwriter only few did as much in three 
minutes. He was an Old Testament, shaggy-haired prophet, a fatalist – 
funny too. He was severe, he was precise, he said what he had to say and
 he got out of there. He was lyrically spare and beautiful. He created a
 world of childhood memory and of men and women with their backs to the 
wall. A landscape of swamps, bayous, endless rivers, gypsy women, back 
porches, hang-dogs chasing ghosts, devils, bad moons rising, straight 
out of the blues tradition.<br>
<br>
"So let me end by saying that in their day Creedence never got the 
respect they deserved. They played no-frills American music for the 
people."<br>
<br>
<br>
*<br>
<br>
On the 1978 tour, Springsteen would break off in the middle of 'Growin’'
 Up to deliver variants on the following rock’n’roll fable:<br>
"When I was growing up there were two things that were unpopular in my 
house. One was me and the other was my guitar. Anyway, one day my mom 
and pop, they come to me and say, ‘Bruce, it’s time to get serious with 
your life. This guitar thing, it’s okay as a hobby but you need 
something to fall back on.’ My father, he said, ‘You should be a lawyer’
 – which I coulda used later on in my career. He says, ‘Lawyers, they 
run the world’.<br>
<br>
"But my mother said, ‘No, no, he should be an author, he should write 
books; that’s a good life. You can get a little something for yourself.’
 But me, I wanted to play the guitar.<br>
<br>
"Now my mother, she’s real Italian, and my father, he’s Irish. So they 
say, ‘This is a big thing. You should go see the priest. Tell him we 
want you to be a lawyer or an author. But don’t say nothin’ about that 
goddamn guitar.’<br>
<br>
"So I went to the rectory and knocked on the door. ‘Hi, Father Ray, I’m 
Mr. Springsteen’s son.’ I tell him, ‘I got this problem. My father, he 
thinks I should be a lawyer, and my mother wants me to be an author. But
 me, I got this guitar.’<br>
<br>
"Father Ray says, ‘This is too big a deal for me. You got to talk to 
God’ – who I didn’t know too well at the time. ‘Tell Him about the 
lawyer and the author,’ Father Ray says, ‘but don’t say nothin’ about 
that guitar‘. Now I was worried. Where was I gonna find God, right? So I
 go find Clarence – he knows everybody. Clarence says, ‘No sweat. I know
 right where He is.’<br>
<br>
"So I show up at Clarence’s house in my mother’s car – an old Nash 
Rambler. Clarence looks at me. He says, ‘You gonna go vist God in that? 
Man, He’s got like, people in Cadillacs, you know. He ain’t gonna pay 
attention to anyone who shows up in a Nash Rambler.’ But it’s all I got.<br>
<br>
"So we drive way out of town, along this old dark road. We finally came 
to this little house, way out in the woods, nothing around, but all the 
lights are on inside. There’s music blasting out and a little hole in 
the door.<br>
<br>
‘I knock and this eye peeps out. I say, ‘Uh, Clarence sent me.’ So they 
let me in. And there’s God behind the drums. On the bass drum it says 
G-O-D. So I said, ‘God, I got this problem. My father, he wants me to be
 a lawyer, cause he says lawyers rule the world. And my mother, she 
wants me to be an author, get a little something for myself. But they 
just don’t understand – I got this guitar.’<br>
<br>
"God looks at me. He says, ‘I know, I know. See, what they don’t 
understand is, Moses screwed up. There was supposed to be an Eleventh 
Commandment. Actually, Moses was so scared after ten – it was a great 
show, the burning bush, the thunder, lightning, you shoulda seen it – he
 went back down the mountain. You see, what those guys don’t understand 
is that there was supposed to be an Eleventh Commandment. And all it 
said was: LET IT ROCK!’"<br>
<br>
<br>
*<br>
<br>
Regular rap on 1980 world tour:<br>
"I remember when I was nine years old and I was sittin’ in front of the 
TV set and my mother had Ed Sullivan on and on came Elvis. I remember 
right from that time, I looked at her and I said, ‘I wanna be just... 
like... that’. But I grew up and I didn’t want to be just like that no 
more. Because he was like the biggest dreamer. He was like a big 
liberator. I remember I was sittin’ at home when a friend of mine called
 and told me that he died, which wasn’t that big a surprise at the time 
because I’d seen him a few months earlier in Philadelphia. I thought a 
lot about it – how somebody could’ve had so much could in the end lose 
so bad and how dreams don’t mean nothin’ unless you’re strong enough to 
fight for ’em and make ’em come true. You gotta hold on to yourself."<br>
<br>
<br>
*<br>
<br>
Regular introduction to 'Born To Run',1988 Tunnel Of Love Express world tour:<br>
"This is an old song which I wrote when I was 24 years old, sitting on 
the edge of my bed in Long Beach, New Jersey, and thinking, Here I come,
 world! When I wrote it, I guess I figured it was a song about a guy and
 a girl who wanted to run and keep on running. But as I got older and as
 I sang it over the years, it sort of opened up, and I guess I realised 
that it was about two people searching for something better. Anyway, 
this song has kept me good company on my search. I hope it’s kept you 
good company on your search."<br>
<br>
<br>
*<br>
<br>
LIFE<br>
Regular introduction to The Animals’ 'It’s My Life', mid-’70s:<br>
<br>
"I grew up in this small town about 20 miles inland. I remember it was 
in this dumpy, two-storey, two-family house, next door to this gas 
station. And my mom, she was a secretary and she worked downtown. And my
 father, he worked a lotta different places, worked in a rug mill for a 
while, and he was a guard down at the jail for a while. I can remember 
when he worked down there, he used to come back real pissed off, drunk, 
sit in the kitchen.<br>

"At night, about nine o’clock, he used to shut off all the lights, every
 light in the house. And he’d sit in the kitchen with a six-pack and a 
cigarette. [When I got home] I’d stand there in that driveway, afraid to
 go in the house, and I could see the screen door, I could see the light
 of my pop’s cigarette.<br>
<br>
"I used to slick my hair back real tight so he couldn’t tell how long it
 was gettin’ and try to sneak through the kitchen. But the old man, he’d
 catch me every night and he’d drag me back into that kitchen. He’d make
 me sit down at that table in the dark, and he would sit there tellin’ 
me. And I can remember just sittin’ there in the dark, him tellin’ me...
 tellin’ me, tellin’ me, tellin’ me.<br>
<br>
"Pretty soon he’d ask me what I thought I was doin’ with myself, and 
we’d always end up screamin’ at each other. My mother she’d always end 
up runnin’ in from the front room, cryin’ and tryin’ to pull him off me,
 try to keep us from fightin’ with each other. And I’d always, I’d 
always end up runnin’ out the back door, pullin’ away from him, runnin’ 
down the driveway, screamin’ at him, tellin’ him, tellin’ him, tellin’ 
him how it was my life and I was gonna do what I wanted to do."<br>

From an introduction to 'The River', Born In The USA tour, Coliseum, Los Angeles, September, 1985:<br>
"When I was growin’ up, me and my dad we used to go at it all the time. 
It got to where we were fightin’ so much that I’d stay outta the house a
 lot. In the summertime it wasn’t so bad, but when the winter came... I 
remember bein’ downtown and it would get so cold. And when the wind 
would blow I used to have this phone booth that I used to stand in. I 
used to stand there and call my girl and get her to call me back and 
then talk to her for hours at a time, all night.<br>
<br>
"I can remember one time I had a motorcycle accident. I was laid up in 
bed and he had a barber come in and cut my hair. I can remember tellin’ 
him that I hated him. I told him that I hated him and I would never, 
ever, forget. He used to tell me, ‘Man, I can’t wait till the army gets 
you. Man when the army gets you, they’re gonna make a man outta ya. 
They’re gonna cut all that hair off, and they’ll finally make a man 
outta ya.’ I remember the day I got my draft notice in the mail, I hid 
it from my folks. Then, three days before I was supposed to go up for my
 physical, me and my buddies went out and stayed up all night. I 
remember when we got in the bus that mornin’, we were so scared. ’Cause 
it was in ’68, and the Vietnam War was goin’ on. And we went up and we 
took the physical and I failed. But I can remember comin’ home, walkin’ 
in the kitchen, and my mom and pop sittin’ there. And they asked me, 
‘Where you been for three days?’ And I said, ‘I had to take my 
physical’. And my dad said, ‘What happened?’ And I said, ‘I failed’. And
 he said, ‘That’s good’."<br>

"My father was always transfixed by money. He used to drive out of town 
and look at this big white house. It became a kinda touchstone for me. 
Now, when I dream, sometimes I’m on the outside looking in – and 
sometimes I’m the man on the inside."<br>

From the introduction to 'My Father’s House' at the benefit for the 
Christic Institute (independent watchdog on American government), Shrine
 Auditorium, Los Angeles, November 17, 1990:<br>
"I had this habit for a long time. I used to get in my car and I would 
drive back through my old neighbourhood in the town I grew up in. I’d 
always drive past the old houses I used to live in. I’d do it, sometimes
 late at night. I got so I would do it really regularly, two or three, 
four times a week, for years, and I eventually got to wondering, what 
the hell am I doing? So I went to see a psychiatrist, this is true, and I
 said, ‘Doc, what am I doing?’ So he says, ‘Well, something bad happened
 and you keep going back to see if you can fix it or somehow make it 
right’. And I sat there and I said, ‘That is what I’m doing’. And he 
said, ‘You can’t’."<br>

From the introduction to 'The Wish' at the Christic Institute benefit, Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles, November 17, 1990:<br>
"I wrote this song quite a while ago. I never really recorded it. It’s a
 song about my mother. It was a funny thing because I had this song and I
 said, ‘Gee, in rock music, in rock’n’roll, ain’t nobody sings about 
their mother out there’.<br>
<br>
"It’s against all that macho posturing you have to do and stuff. I 
wanted to figure it out, so I went to see this psychiatrist. And I told 
him what the problem was. So he said he understood: ‘You have to see all
 men are afraid of their mothers. They say a boy’s best friend is his 
mother, but really all men are afraid of their mothers’. I had to pay 
for this, you’re gonna get it for free. So I said, ‘Well, men are afraid
 of their mothers, yeah’.<br>
<br>
"That’s why, when a man and woman get arguing, the woman’s always going,
 ‘Do I look like your mother? I’m not your mother. Am I supposed to be 
your mother?’ Men are always going, ‘Stop mothering me. Ah, my mother 
used to do that’. So realising the truth of this thing, I said, ‘Wait a 
minute. I’m man enough to sing about my mother. I think.’ So Mom, if 
you’re out there, this better be good."<br>

Introduction to 'Independence Day' at Brendan Byrne Arena, East Rutherford, New Jersey, July 9, 1981:<br>
"I could never talk to my old man, he could never talk to me, my mother 
couldn’t talk to him. So I was glad when I finally got old enough and I 
started to live alone. Then for about ten years I never saw my folks 
that much. And just recently we came back from Europe and I got a phone 
call a night or two later that my father had gotten sick.<br>
<br>
"And I went out to California where he was in the hospital there. I 
started thinkin’ on the way about all the things that I always wanted to
 say to him and I never said and I always figured, well, someday we’ll 
sit down and we’ll talk about why it was the way it was when I was 
young, talk about why he felt the way he did. But the years go by and it
 never comes up. I guess it feels like a dangerous subject or something.
 But he got sick and I realised that he was gettin’ old and that if I 
had somethin’ to say to him, I should say it now "<br>

"The thing of having a baby, you know, you’re waiting and you’re 
waiting. Call the doctor. He says, Wait, wait, don’t come down here. So 
we’re waiting. We rented some movies, walked around Beverly Hills for a 
while. Finally, we go to the hospital and I’m thinking, "Okay, I don’t 
wanna faint’. That’s my main concern. That’s disgusting, isn’t it? 
Anyway, we get there and it’s night, and it was nice and the baby came 
pretty quick.<br>
<br>
"Took him home and it was amazing, because I seen the first time he 
cried, and I caught his first tear on the tip of my finger. Seen his 
first smile and cleaned his first shit. All those things I think you 
keep on doing, I guess. Tremors, we watched Tremors, to spiritually

<br>
"This is a story about disconnection and isolation. I’ve always been 
fighting between feeling really isolated and looking to make some 
connection or find some community to belong to. I guess that’s why I 
picked up the guitar initially. I spend enormous periods of time feeling
 very isolated. I guess this is a song about what happens when that side
 of you gets really set loose. And you don’t feel the connections, and 
you don’t feel what sense laws make or morality makes. And you’re gone."<br>

Introduction to 'The River', Civic Arena, Pittsburgh, September 22, 1984:<br>
"There’s something really dangerous happening to us out there. We’re 
slowly getting split up into two different Americas. Things are gettin’ 
taken away from people that need them and given to people that don’t 
need them, and there’s a promise getting broken. In the beginning the 
idea was that we all live here a little bit like a family, where the 
strong can help the weak ones, the rich can help the poor ones.<br>
<br>
"I don’t think the American dream was that everyody was going to make it
 or that everybody was going to make a billion dollars, but it was that 
everybody was going to have an opportunity and the chance to live a life
 with some decency and some dignity and a chance for some self-respect. 
So I know you gotta be feelin’ the pinch down here where the rivers 
meet." (When Springsteen finished the song he dedicated it to Local 
1397, the militant Homestead, Pennsylvania, branch of the United 
Steelworkers Of America who had been resisting pay and conditions cuts.)<br>

Introduction to 'Independence Day', Palais Des Sports, Paris, April, 1981:<br>
"I grew up in this house where there was never any books or anything 
that was considered art or anything. But when I got older I saw that my 
father, he quit high school and went in the army and he got married real
 young and picked up jobs where he could, workin’ in a factory, driving a
 truck. And I look back at my grandfather and he worked at a rug mill in
 the town that I grew up in.<br>
<br>
"And it seemed like we all had one thing in common and that was that we 
didn’t know enough, we didn’t know enough about what was happening to 
us. Like, I’m 31 now and I just started to read the history of the 
United States. And the thing about it is, I started to learn about how 
things got to be the way they are today, how you end up a victim without
 even knowing it. And how people get old and just die after not having 
hardly a day’s satisfaction or peace of mind in their lives.<br>
<br>
"I was lucky too because I met this guy [Landau], when I was in my 
middle 20s, who said you should watch this or you should read this. And 
most people, where I come from, never have someone try and help them in 
that way. So all I’m sayin’ is, is try and learn, learn about 
yourselves, learn about who you are now. And try and make it better for 
who’s gonna be comin’. Because the real future of rock’n’roll’s only 
about nine years old today."<br>

"The marriage between a community and a company is a special thing that 
involves a special trust. What do you do after ten years or 20 years, 
you wake up in the morning and see your livelihood sailing away from 
you, leaving you standing on the dock? What happens when the jobs go 
away and the people remain? What goes unmeasured is the price that 
unemployment inflicts on people’s families, on their marriages, on the 
single mothers out there trying to raise their kids on their own. The 3M
 company: it’s their money, it’s their plant. But it’s the 3M workers’ 
jobs. I’m here to say that I think that after 25 years of service from a
 community, there is a debt owed to the 3M workers and to my hometown."<br>

From a formal statement for Amnesty International’s Human Rights Now! tour, 1988:<br>
"When you’re young and you pick up a guitar, it feels so powerful. It 
feels like you pulled the sword from the stone. But as you get older you
 realise that, although it can do a lot of things, there are also a lot 
of things it can’t do. I used to believe that it could save the world, 
but I don’t really believe that any more... As I’ve got older one of the
 things I’ve wanted to do with my music is somehow take that power that I
 got from those records when I was a kid and somehow put it to work in 
some nuts-and-bolts way. And I’ve tried to find out who the people are 
out there who are working in the trenches, who are taking those ideas 
and ideals – same ideas and ideals that I got from those records – and 
outting them to use in some pragmatic way."<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: Wiltern Theatre, Los Angeles<br>
<br>
Dave DiMartino, MOJO, January 1996<br>
<br>
"I KNOW THIS IS LA," ANNOUNCED BRUCE Springsteen at the start of his 
concert, "so I hope I don't have to go out there and confiscate your 
phones."<br>
<br>
The enthusiastic crowd tittered, jam-packed into LA's smallish Wiltern 
Theatre and relishing this, the opening night of Springsteen's 
first-ever solo acoustic tour. Local boy Bruce – no longer a newcomer, 
now an Angeleno of some duration – had just advised potential BRROOOCE 
screamers that his forthcoming songs needed to be listened to by an 
attentive, quiet audience.<br>
<br>
Well now, there's a thought. Less than a week after local media were 
trumpeting the enormous sales of the just-released Anthology 1, 
typically at the expense of Springsteen's latest – issued the same day 
and thus compared saleswise with peculiar glee (initial score at one 
retail account: Beatles 2,000, Springsteen 40) – here was a man politely
 asking his audience to sit down and shut up. Good man, that Bruce 
Springsteen.<br>
<br>
But the man can hypnotise. As he began singing the title track of his 
aggressively stark 'The Ghost Of Tom Joad', holding a guitar and lit 
mostly by sparse stage spotlights, the celebrity-packed crowd instantly 
hushed. For this was surely how the album was meant to be heard: not on a
 car stereo, with traffic lights and blaring horns distracting, and not 
on the radio, sandwiched between Sheryl Crow and Don Henley. In person, 
onstage, one-to-one, ultimately troubadour-style, dumb as that sounds. 
There are scant melodies on the new album – some would say about three –
 but Springsteen's way of drawing you in is a hook no-one else can 
provide. In his hands, little is plain or ordinary.<br>
<br>
Few can fault Springsteen for his sense of pacing; indeed, most of the 
new songs were delivered between stripped-down versions of more familiar
 ones. Along with second number 'Adam Raised A Cain', a total of nine 
older tracks were acoustically reworked, some of them drastically. 
Noting that his next song had been misinterpreted – "sort of like 'Louie
 Louie'," – and adding that as its writer he could get in the "last 
word", the man took slide to 12-string and knocked off 'Born In The USA'
 without once singing its lyrically-prominent title. This, presumably, 
because it had been appropriated here in the past by right-wing 
imbeciles lacking any sense of irony. Also missing: that line about 
killing "the Yellow Man". Political correctness? Tribute to an 
apprehensive albino Jamaican rapper? You decide.<br>
<br>
For the most part, the older songs Springsteen chose to sing – 
'Nebraska' and 'Darkness On The Edge Of Town', say – were a perfect 
thematic fit with his newer work. That theme in full: life sucks and 
then you die. A far cry from the joyful tinge of his recent work – but 
then again, 'Living Proof' and '57 Channels' seemed drawn from what 
appears to be his own very happy personal life. The Ghost Of Tom Joad, 
on the other hand, seems drawn from books, articles and films – several 
of which are courteously listed on the album's liner notes for your 
perusal.<br>
<br>
The night's big question then, at least for me, was whether Springsteen 
could convincingly sing these songs detailing the woes of others so 
obviously far-removed from him. The big answer, to his credit, was that 
of course he could. Taking a seat for the first time midway through the 
show, he sang four new songs detailing the lot of the illegal Mexican 
immigrant; here so close to the border, that topic is a hot one both 
politically and, for many, personally. Beginning with 'Sinaloa Cowboys' –
 his grim tale of methamphetamine-cooking Mexicans drawn directly from 
the pages of the Los Angeles Times – Springsteen sang convincingly, 
heartrendingly and, truly, not far removed in spirit from Woody 
Guthrie's own 'Deportee'.<br>
<br>
The Guthrie comparisons, inescapable, are not far off-base, actually. 
More than a few whoops of BRRROOOOCE were heard when the singer began 
his first encore with 'Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?', but the 
wordy New Jersey tunesmith who plopped that song dead-centre on his 1973
 debut album no longer keeps or needs his old thesaurus. "Wizard imps 
and sweat sock pimps, interstellar mongrel nymphs," he sang then. And 
now? "Come home in the evening, can't get the smell from my hands/Lay my
 head down on the pillow/And go driftin' off into foreign lands." These 
are not the lyrics of a man looking to sustain a career as a pop singer;
 they're the work of an artist writing songs for the ages. Three 
encores, a new song – 'Dead Man Walking', apparently from an upcoming 
Tim Robbins film – and not a single phone confiscated from the audience.
 Where I come from, they make movies about this sort of thing.<br>

				<div class="content">He may be on the cover of Time again, but The Rising sure ain't Born to Run<br>
<br>
THE BEST SONG on Bruce Springsteen's long-awaited studio album, The 
Rising, is almost a throwaway. It's called 'Let's Be Friends (Skin to 
Skin)', and if it were missing from the album, you probably wouldn't 
miss it. It has nothing to do with the heavy, dark and serious statement
 about a post-9/11 America that Springsteen makes through most of the 14
 other songs that appear on the album. Conceptually, the album would 
hold together just fine without it.<br>
<br>
No, 'Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin)' is a fun song. It reminds me of 
'Hungry Heart', a song that didn't seem to fit the album it was on — The
 River — either. It's slightly racy — you can see Springsteen smile as 
the character in the song makes his move, singing, "The time is now, 
maybe we could get skin to skin."<br>
<br>
If only the rest of The Rising were as good as 'Let's Be Friends (Skin 
to Skin)'. There's so much weight on this album. And it's been turned 
into such an event. Weeks before its release a New York Times profile 
let the world know that 9/11 had brought Bruce out of a writer's block 
and allowed him to find his "rock voice" again. His new album, we 
learned, was about the impact of 9/11 on Americans. Not only that, but 
we read that the fans needed him. In that article Springsteen said that a
 few days after Sept. 11, as he was leaving a parking lot in the Jersey 
Shore town of Sea Bright, a fan rolled down the car window and shouted, 
"We need you!"<br>
<br>
Last week he was on the cover of Time magazine again — 27 years after 
the news weekly called him "Rock's New Sensation" — this time with the 
headline "Reborn in the U.S.A.: How Bruce Springsteen reached out to 
9/11 survivors and turned America's anguish into art."<br>
<br>
All of this hoopla is, frankly, annoying. From a business standpoint, it
 probably makes good sense. But it makes Springsteen look like an 
opportunist. And it also sets him up for accusations of "much ado about 
nothing."<br>
<br>
If you haven't been paying attention, well, it's been a long time since 
Springsteen made a really good album of new material. You have to reach 
back to 1987 and Tunnel of Love. Since then there were those two studio 
albums he did without the E Street Band (Human Touch and Lucky Town), a 
greatest-hits album, the so-so folky Ghost of Tom Joad, a collection of 
old stuff (stuff that didn't make the cut for various albums Bruce was 
working on back when he was firing on all six cylinders) titled Tracks, 
and a truly pointless live album from his 2000 oldies-but-goodies tour, 
Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band/ Live in New York City.<br>
<br>
As a longtime Springsteen fan and media junkie, I, of course, bought 
into the hype; on the morning The Rising was released I plunked down my 
$20 to buy the special book-like version of the album with the extra 
photos and handwritten notes. I'd already read a pan in Newsweek and 
raves in the Wall Street Journal and the San Francisco Chronicle, and 
had heard good things from a friend who'd already spent a few days with 
it.<br>
<br>
I would like to say that none of that had any impact on me. And that I 
was able to just let the album live or die based solely on the music. 
But I'd lying if I said that. I brought all kinds of expectations and 
preconceptions to The Rising. And I found, even during my first listen, 
even as I kept telling myself "Withhold judgement, just listen, no need 
to put on that 'critic's hat' yet," that my emotions were all over the 
place, I was reacting, and not just to the music. But then, later, I 
thought, "No, you're reacting to all that other stuff because something 
is missing in the music.<br>
<br>
I have listened to the album more than a dozen times during the past 
three days. On first listen, I thought it sucked. Now, many listens 
later, I like some of it, but I find problems with much of the 
songwriting, production and arrangements. Many of the arrangements sound
 heavy-handed and some of the lyrics seem shallow and clichéd ("I'm 
waitin', waitin' on a sunny day/ Gonna chase the clouds away/ Waitin' on
 a sunny day," goes one less-than-inspired chorus).<br>
<br>
'Further On [Up the Road]' is a perfect example of a song that never 
should have been recorded. The melody is hackneyed and tired — we've 
heard these hard rock changes before, and they weren't that good in the 
first place. The beat is plodding, the music — a murky mass of guitars —
 is indistinct, uninteresting. It's really hard to imagine the man who 
once wrote 'Thunder Road' and 'Adam Raised a Cain' singing these words: 
"Further on up the road/ Further on up the road/ Where the way is dark 
and the night is cold/ One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know/ And I'll 
meet you further on up the road."<br>
<br>
Then there's the problem of the sound of the E Street Band. On such 
classic albums as Born to Run and Darkness on the Edge of Town, 
Springsteen and the band together created an unmistakable sound. It 
utilized classic rock 'n' roll elements and instruments including 
acoustic piano, Hammond organ and saxophone, along with bass, drums and 
electric guitars. Yet on The Rising, many of the tracks incorporate that
 truly irritating synth sound that I believe first reared its ugly head 
on 'Dancing in the Dark'. With a drummer as talented as Max Weinberg, 
why make use of a drum machine? Often producer Brendan O'Brien turns the
 E Street Band into an anonymous rock band, neutering them of the 
idiosyncratic stylistic elements that for so many years made Bruce 
Springsteen and the E Street Band sound like themselves.<br>
<br>
If I'm making The Rising sound like a disaster, well, it's not that 
extreme. Springsteen has made a mediocre album. Not a bad album. Just 
not an album that I'll go back to in years to come, the way I 
periodically go back to the albums he recorded in the '70s and first 
half of the '80s. Still, there are some powerful songs here. 'Empty 
Sky', in particular, is a standout. It has a strong melody, a simple, 
moving arrangement and powerful lyrics. The chorus is a disappointment 
("Empty sky/ Empty sky/ I woke up this morning to an empty sky" repeated
 twice), but the way Springsteen sings it, with moving background vocals
 from his wife Patti Scialfa, makes it work. 'Into the Fire', 'You're 
Missing' and 'Paradise' are also pretty good. And Springsteen's voice, 
throughout, sounds terrific.<br>
<br>
And then there's 'Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin)'. If it wasn't buried 
in the middle of all these "heavy" songs that we know were inspired by 
9/11, you'd just think it was a great, slightly retro soul number. You'd
 start bouncing around the room or rockin' in your car when it came on. 
You'd smile, give your boyfriend or girlfriend, wife or husband a kiss. 
And your day would be just a little bit better.<br>
<br>
I expect a lot from Bruce Springsteen. His recordings have earned him a 
place among rock's greats. I understand that producing great work on 
demand isn't easy — and perhaps is impossible. I feel for him. Listening
 to The Rising is a little like running into an old friend who's been 
through some hard times and hasn't quite recovered. You know it's the 
same guy, but that spark is missing. You want it to be there so bad, but
 it isn't.<br>
<br>
All I want from Bruce Springsteen is an album that gives me goosebumps, 
the kind I still get when I listen to Darkness on the Edge of Town, or 
Highway 61 Revisited or Call the Doctor. That's probably too much to 
ask.<br>

<br>
John Mendelsohn, Creem, 1986<br>
<br>
LET’S ADMIT IT to one another – there are several things we don’t like 
so much about Bruce Springsteen. We’re not crazy, for instance, about 
his music (not in the grand, but in the nuts and bolts sense – you know,
 the notes and stuff) being entirely predictable, based on riffs and 
changes that were already generic before Little Richard bought his first
 tube of eyeliner. We’re not crazy about his having virtually no melodic
 flair. In all candor, we find a fair percentage of his music pretty 
tedious.<br>
<br>
We’re not crazy about the way he dresses, or, frankly, that he has bald 
people in his band, for we’ve always believed that it’s the rock’n’roll 
performer’s sacred duty to try to delight the eye as well as the ear. 
Truth be told, we would love to see the Boss dash on stage in a pink 
leopardskin zoot suit, let’s say, rather than in duds one might wear to 
scour the restrooms of service stations.<br>
<br>
We don’t share his apparent belief in the innate nobility of the blue 
collar worker. While lots of blue collar workers had no choice in the 
matter, lots of others could have been white collar – if not surgeons, 
attorneys, or even chiefs on Indian tribes – if they hadn’t been so 
eager to quit school and start earning wages so that they could lord it 
over the rest of us. In adulthood, a disproportionate percentage of blue
 collar workers become loutish redneck assholes.<br>
<br>
Having noted that, since the ‘50s, the best rock’n’roll has been made by
 geezers who seem to disappear when they turn sidewise, we’re not very 
comfortable with The Boss’s great big bulging muscles. And, conceding as
 we do so that it’s hardly our business, we must admit that we’d have 
preferred to see him marry a plain girl form Bayonne – a waitress, let’s
 say, or a nurse at a convalescent hospital – rather than an 
actress/model who used to be paid more for an hour of standing around 
looking ravishing than most blue collar workers make in a month.<br>
<br>
So there are several things that we don’t like about Bruce Springsteen, 
and we consider him not only to the ‘80s what Elvis was to the ‘50s and 
Dylan was to the ‘60s, but the greatest of the three. And thus the 
pre-eminent figure in the history of American rock’n’roll. (We adjudge 
him greater than Elvis, obviously, because he’s been utterly brilliant 
on stage and at least consistently interesting on record for about a 
dozen years now, whereas, after maybe three years of incandescent 
brilliance, Elvis became an insufferable cornball. Credit Dylan, on the 
other hand, with maybe five years on incandescent brilliance, but expect
 at least a little argument from me, who thinks the period between 
Bringing it All Back Home and Blonde On Blonde more than covers it.)<br>
<br>
For everything about him that makes us uneasy or even blue, there are 
four or five more to adore about Bruce Springsteen. His songs bulge with
 heart and soul. Utterly predictable though his music may be, he can 
make the simplest chord change imaginable seen absolutely thrilling, as 
witness the halfway point of the verses of ‘Dancing In The Dark’. By 
turns thrilling, touching, and hilarious, he puts on the best live show 
in rock’n’roll (And what sound! In the 20 years I’ve been going to 
rock’n’roll shows, I’ve heard a grand total of one act – Cliff Richard –
 sound as good indoors, where it’s much easier, as The Boss and his boys
 did at the Oakland Coliseum last autumn. And what exquisite lights!) 
He’s not only compassionate and generous himself, but encourages his 
audiences to be likewise.<br>
<br>
In this age of W.A.S.P. and MTV, of brazen sham, arrogant artifice and 
shameless pandering, he can single-handedly make you proud to still love
 rock’n’roll.<br>
<br>
That that was only marginally more true last year than in several of the
 previous 10 since Born to Run made him a star leads us to ask, "Why was
 it in 1985 that Bruce Springsteen ceased to be just enormously popular 
and influential, and became a full-fledged Cultural Phenomenon?"<br>
<br>
In ‘Dancing In The Dark’ and ‘Bobby Jean’, did Born In The U.S.A. 
contain a couple of perfectly marvelous tracks that rank just below the 
quintessential ‘Born To Run’ with the Boss’s second best work? Bet the 
farm on it. Did it bulge with heart and soul, with humour and passion? 
Bet the form on it. Mustn’t it have been substantially superior, then, 
to The River, say, which it outsold by – what, ten to one or something? 
Only in the sense of its having a more bombastic drum sound and 
pleasingly deployed synthesizers. And, in the grindingly tedious title 
track, it contained the most unlistenable track of The Boss’s whole 
recording career.<br>
<br>
Well, then, we say, grasping at straws, was it because the addition of 
Nils Lofgren and the subtraction of Steve Van Zandt – apparently a chum 
of the first water, but a musician of no particular distinction – the 
1985 E Street Band was stronger than earlier versions? (Oh, hardly, we 
answer ourselves, even before noting, though it pains us to do so, that 
the E Street Band was slightly less torrid for the presence of backing 
singer Patty Scialfa, who, at least in Oakland, sang mostly in keys 
other than those in which the band was playing.)<br>
<br>
So why, already, was 1985 The Year of The Boss, as few previous years 
have so dramatically been his or others’? Mostly, methinks, for the 
wrong reasons.<br>
<br>
In an era of raging mindlessness, countless millions of Americans who’d 
heretofore ignored him got a load of The Boss’s bulging biceps, another 
at his headband, another at the title and cover of his latest album, and
 a fourth at the gigantic American flag that hung behind him at the 
beginning of his stadium concerts, and seemed to surmise that we was the
 rock’n’roll personification of the mythic hero of the year, Sylvester 
Stallone’s John Rambo, prolific waster of gook commies and singlehanded 
restorer of the national pride.<br>
<br>
In other words, buying a Bruce Springsteen album or concert ticket came 
to be perceived in 1985 as evidence of one’s Feeling Good About America.
 The hilarious (or, if you prefer to be gloomy about it, terrifying) 
thing about which is that ‘Born In The U.S.A.’ – in reference to which 
the gigantic flags were draped behind the stadium stages – was an 
unambiguous expression of pained disillusionment. Did none of the new 
patriots who embraced The Boss as their fave musical rave in ’85 not 
notice that, immediately after The Boss’s invariably anguished, 
show-opening performance of the song, the flag was unceremoniously 
dropped from view?<br>
<br>
Was there a way not to collapse chortling to the floor on hearing the 
imitation of him Chrysler commissioned for its big "The Pride Is Back" 
ad campaign after The Boss spurned its offer of a jillion dollars for 
the rights to ‘Born In The U.S.A.’?<br>
<br>
We pause to try to imagine the new lyrics Lee lacocca’s boys might have come up with:<br>
<br>
They offer real good fuel economy, Mister, how about this warranty?<br>
But the very bossest thing about these is that they’re ‘mer’can-made, not Japanese<br>
<br>
(They were) made in the U.S.A.<br>
Made in the U.S.A.<br>
Made in the U.S.A.<br>
Test drive one soon, son, in the U.S.A.<br>
<br>
Chrysler was hardly alone, of course, in trying to exploit the Boss’s 
elevation to the status of True Cultural Icon in 1985. As witness 
Casio’s use of a denim-clad, headbanded Boss lookalike, alongside a 
clipboard-toting Japanese posing as an electronics engineer, in its 
advertisements for its dinky CZ-101 synthesizer.<br>
<br>
There are those who perceived John Cougar Mellencamp’s sudden 
preoccupation with the agrarian blue collar worker – that is, the farmer
 – as another manifestation of Bossmania. I can’t really comment – 
agreeing with the Los Angeles Herald’s assessment of Mellencamp as 
"Bruce Springsteen for the hearing impaired," I scurry in the other 
direction at the sound of his voice. (Which isn’t to suggest that we’re 
undelighted that hundreds of thousands of young Americans who might 
otherwise have bought, say, Ratt’s latest collection of songs of 
machismo and misogyny bought Scarecrow. And while we’re here, let me 
note that the sight of vast number of kids in iron Maiden and Ozzy and 
like T-shirts at the first Springsteen’s two Oakland Coliseum 
performances – kids exposing themselves to real rock’n’roll, the 
celebrating, inspiring kind, rather than the mocking, degrading – was 
one of the pleasantest surprises of an altogether wonderful 
concert-going experience).<br>
<br>
My own favorite manifestation of Bossmania, though, was a radio spot for
 a singles bar up in that part of the Northern California wine country 
that I call home, one that featured two young women on the make 
comparing their impressions of an available-looking bachelor at the bar.
 "Well, he isn’t exactly Bruce Springsteen," one of them lamented. 
Forget Rob Lowe, Tom Selleck, or Vince Ferragamo, in other words – in 
1985, it was that shy guy from the New Jersey outback with an overbite 
and a service station restroom-scourers wardrobe to whom studs in 
singles bars were compared!<br>
<br>
More power to him, say I. As though he needs it.<br>
