My review of Chile<br>
 <br>
I just came from Chile, after a 1 day trip to Santiago, without 
sleeping, and having to go to work in 2 hours. I couldn´t wait to write 
about the show. Me and a fellow fan arrived about 5.00 pm and there were
 lots of places, we found a good spot in front but in the right, like in
 Stevie´s side. We met lots of Latin American fans, all very excited and
 amazed, not believing we were going to see Bruce. Thousands of 
sacrified stories, few Bruce shows on our back most of us and finding 
new friends amongst Bruce. I met Frank, a greasy laker too, from 
Germany!<br>
 <br>
Bruce enters and we all started to shout and jump and scream. Me crying,
 the guy beside me too, other one screaming, others holding, it was 
amazing!<br>
 <br>
You surely know the setlist by now, started with We take care of our 
own, and gave us a nice setlist, we don´t complain about setlists yet, 
we are in another stage, jajaja. Think about us, we have few or no shows
 before, and a bit of everything was amazing! Years of listening those 
songs all alone, and finally listening to them in our lands!!!! how can 
that be boring???  <br>
 <br>
The highlights of the show: for me The River, I couldn’t stop crying, 
never heard it live before, amazing! Bruce said he was amazed we knew 
his songs, and that we were very enthusiastic! He was amazing, always 
laughing, moving, offering a great show. Othe great great songs Johnny 
99 and acoustic This hard land, AMAZINGLY beautiful!!  <br>
 <br>
The political moment: He sang a Victor Jara song called Manifiesto in 
spanishhhh, remembering the musician who was killed by the military 
government in Chile, and Bruce remembered his participation in Amnesty, 
and that they were not able to play in Chile. He has a great 
pronunciation!<br>
 <br>
The funny moments: he invited like 4 or 5 girls to dance Dancing in the 
dark with him, even a guy, and a pregnant girl, to whom he gave a guitar
 and she sang and played with them, amazingggggggg. One of them robbed 
him a big kiss like in the 70`s!!! He even got kind of lost during 
Spirit in the Night, it reminded me to the Hammersmith show. Bruce even 
kissed in the lips to a girl during “me and crazy janey were making love
 in the dirt”… imagine that!<br>
 <br>
The E Street Band: Obviously the best band in the world but they seemed 
(specially Steve and Garry) like a bit tired. Steve didn`t much pay 
attention to us, who watched us a lot, we tried to call his attention a 
lot, but with few results. Everyone know why this might be? Garry 
laughed a bit, he was nice. No Patti.<br>
 <br>
He played 3.30 hs, our body was acking, we were VERY tired but inmensly 
happy about the possibility. I touched his hand, his arm, I cried, 
laughed, jumped, everything I could to express my happiness. It was a 
great show I will never forget. The best one, will be tomorrow, in my 
country, we will make sure he never forgets us!</div>

<br>
 (After the show at The Palladium on 9/15/78)<br>
<br>
Q#1 - Carol: Welcome back Bruce, let me ask you, which did you like better - The Palladium or the Garden?<br>
<br>
Bruce: I like them both, it's, it's, it's uh, it's a little different, 
it's not that different to tell you the truth, you know, it's like 
people'll think that uh, it's, it's it's not really that different. The 
Garden was real exciting because ... 'cause it was like the Garden and 
we never played there and like, you sorta, it's funny because I didn't 
think that I would be that excited about it or something, you know, and 
like, 'cause we've been playing, like the Garden is, I don't know, our 
60th show or something. We'd been playing a long time. We played some 
big places out west and stuff and I didn't think that I'd, you know, 
feel that different about it but we got there ... and everybody ... was 
liked wiped about, about being there or something, you know, it was 
like, it was sorta like well, you know, this is like a big deal, you 
know. This is like something, you know, something special or something 
so, and I found like uh, like the band, with people like nervous and 
like can never, you know, normally not that nervous, you know, everybody
 was uh, uh, it was uh, it was, it was really something in their whole 
line, that was like the response we got from the crowd was fantastic 
there. Like it was, my favorite New York shows ever, you know, it was 
like, uh, it was just real, it was real satisfying, you know, it was 
real, uh, it was just terrific you know. Having been away and come back 
and, and, and get that kind of, you know, response from the crowd, it 
was just really, it was great. I just want to thank everybody that was 
there for making it like, you know, it's like, it was fantastic, it was 
the best (?) of my life or something (chuckles).<br>
<br>
Q#2 - Carol: Well, I'll you, I remember when you used to say you didn't 
want to play the Garden or a big hall like that. Why did you change your
 mind? <br>
<br>
Bruce: There's a lot of reasons plus, the thing if you're carrying, like
 I've got 25 people that come around with me, and you know, it costs a 
whole lot of money just to walk out and play at night, you know, and 
like with the amount of people I got right now, to walk out, to do it, 
it's impossible, you know, it's, it's very, to, to make money, doing, 
playing in a theatre almost, you know, or it's real, real hard, you 
know. And 'cause if you can try and keep you're best, you know, it can 
cost, it costs, it costs a lot of dough and stuff, you know, so, it was 
good 'cause we did Philadelphia, you know, and it worked out. It was 
like a test, you know a test, market down there sorta and it worked out 
so good that we started playing them in different parts of the country, 
you know. And New York was the last, like practically like the last 
place we did one, you know, and that was like . . . it was really the 
cumul(ation) it was really, ah man, it was like, I was just, I had a 
great time all 3 nights there. We left, everybody was like, it was 
funny, everybody was beat, the bus caught on fire (chuckles) the day we 
left, you know, and like, we drove, I think, to New Haven, which was the
 first place we played after that, and it looked like a wasteland.<br>
<br>
Q#3 - Carol: Some of our listeners may not know why you waited three 
years, do, do you mind going into that a little bit before putting out 
the latest album? <br>
<br>
Bruce: Oh, I took up gardening (chuckles). I always wanted to lay around
 a little bit and relax. No, I was in a, a lawsuit which uh, you know, 
tied everything up for a couple years, and then it took about 11 months 
to make the record, you know, so that really stretched it out there, but
 uh, those were the events.<br>
<br>
Q#4 - Carol: Well, this record has kind of a more Americana feeling 
than, let's say, New York, New Jersey. Did you kind of expand your uh, 
frame of reference in it? Is that what you did?<br>
<br>
Bruce: Just a little bit, you know, just a little bit, uh, it wasn't as 
New York as the other records, you know, and uh, which is good because I
 felt it was more me in the other records in a certain way, you know, 
uh, just the little ( cows ?) and stuff, a lot of it was more, that came
 more from a small town, you know. For 18 years, I grew up in a little 
town and uh, . . . uh, I was coming into the city a lot since I was 16. I
 used to come in and play down at the Cafe Wha?, which I don't think is 
even, I don't know if it's there anymore or not . . . <br>
<br>
Carol: No, it's a middle east restaurant.<br>
Bruce: It is?<br>
<br>
Carol: Yeah!<br>
Bruce: Wow! But I used to go there and play. When I was just, when I was
 16, I'd play there in the summertime, like in the matinees and stuff, 
you know, and so I was coming in a lot from that period on, you know, 
and then when I was making the first album, I was in New York all the 
time. I was playing at Max's all by myself with an acoustic guitar and 
hangin' around and stuff, and I creeped in, uh, quite a bit to the 
first, you know, to the first few albums there. This is album is a 
little more . . . you know, a little more, uh, like where I grew up and 
actually like where I live now, you know. It's still, it's still like 
that a lot so, I was interested in just writing about that, you know, it
 wasn't as uh, urban and stuff.<br>
<br>
Q#5 - Carol: What's the story behind Badlands? That's the uh, the latest
 release off the LP. Do you have a particular story that goes with why 
you wrote that song or how you wrote the song?<br>
<br>
Bruce: Naw, no, let me think, uh (chuckles), it was, initially it was 
gonna be like the title of the album at one time. I thought it was 
something I was gonna use maybe, and a friend of mine put an album out 
with it, yeah, Billy put it out with uh, with uh, with a song with that 
title, you know, uh, this song, I just started jamming in the studio one
 night. I had that riff (Bruce sings it), you know, and uh, we just, we 
put the track down with no words or anything, it was just uh, we threw 
some chords together, and uh, we had the track for a long, long time, 
you know, and I had the track and I had like the title lines, "Badlands,
 you gotta live it everyday', you know, that chorus line, and uh, I was 
at home and I wrote the rest (chuckles). It's always the worst part, you
 know.<br>
<br>
Q#6 - Carol: Do people recognize you in the street in New York? <br>
<br>
Bruce: Not too much, you know, once in a while, you know, uh, once in a 
while someone will come up to me and go . . . 'AL PACINO!' (Bruce &amp; 
Carol break out laughing hysterically) . . . You know, it's like, you 
know, I go 'Naw, naw, naw, naw, naw, wrong guy' you know. But uh, once 
in a while, you know, people come up to me and say 'Hello'. This girl 
comes up to me, where was I? I was in Chicago. She's got a big bandage 
on her chin. And she comes up to me, she says, 'Bruce, how ya doin? I 
did this at your show. Right? I said, 'Well, what happened?' She says, 
'Well I was standing up clapping in the back and it was so hot.' I guess
 she passed out, fell over on her face, you know, it was like, you know,
 it's like, 'I'm sorry', what do you say?, you know, it's like, 'Yeah, I
 passed out. They had to carry me out.', you know, '(?) was great.' 
Said, 'I had a good time. I got, I got a little scar', she says now. I 
always remember that show, you know, but it was funny, so I was, I was 
(?) recognizable. At home, sometimes a little bit, you know, uh, once in
 a while, not that much, you know, I don't like have any particular, uh,
 used to be people would recognize, like my beard or recognize, my hair 
or my hat or my jacket but nobody really recognized my face (chuckles)."<br>
<br>
Q#7 - Carol: What's in the future for you? Let me just, get back to the music, you know, a live album? <br>
<br>
Bruce: Naw, oh, well if things they do goes okay, uh . . . we're either 
gonna, uh, go back out on tour, starting November 1st, so New Year's, 
that's a possibility, or else we're gonna, if we didn't do that, we'd 
start making another record, you know, 'cause I don't want it to be such
 a long time again, you know, and it takes me a while, just to collect 
the songs, and that was the thing about the last time, there was a lot 
of writing done in the studio ... and it just takes time, you know, it 
takes more time that way, and uh, uh, so, I'll probably either go back 
out on tour starting November 1st or start another album, you know. If 
we do go out on tour, we'd start another record in uh, February, you 
know.<br>
<br>
<br>
Closing - Carol: Well, listen, I don't want to take up anymore of your 
time but I want to say 'thank you' for myself and everyone at WPLJ and 
all the listeners because, uh, you know, everybody just loves you and - 
the best live performer in the world. <br>
Bruce: Thanks, Carol, thanks. You know, I just want to say 'thanks' for 
like, uh, 'cause way back when we weren't as popular as (chuckle) we are
 right now, Carol was playing, playing our records, you know, so, I just
 want to say 'thanks a lot.'<br>
<br>
Carol: Well, you're welcome. <br>
Bruce: Alright (chuckles)<br>
<br>
=============================================================<br>
<br>
JIMMY IOVINE w/ CAROL MILLER (Afternoon on 9/15/78)<br>
<br>
&lt;Lead in is about Bruce's demo of Because The Night&gt;<br>
<br>
Q#1 - Carol: That's Bruce doing it, and this afternoon I, uh, spoke with
 my friend, JImmy Iovine, who took time out from recording with Tom 
Petty here in New York City [Damn The Torpedoes album], and uh, Jimmy is
 the producer of the Patti Smith version of that song, the Easter album,
 and also, he is the engineer working with Bruce and Jon Landau on a lot
 of Bruce's stuff. Jimmy has an explanation of uh, that particular 
version. What's the story of this Because The Night take that we have 
with Bruce Springsteen singing it? <br>
<br>
Jimmy: What you just finished playing was uh, one of the demos that we 
recorded the first day of Darkness. Bruce recorded all of the songs that
 he had written up to date and we spent about 2 hours laying a very 
rough demo of all of the songs and that's one of them. <br>
<br>
Carol: Now, how did this tape get out? <br>
<br>
Jimmy: Well, when I gave a cassette of the demo tape to Patti to 
distribute it to her band for them to learn the song, uh, someone stole 
that out of the guitar player's house [Assuming Lenny Kay here] and 
that's how it got on the street. That's probably about a 5th or 6th 
generation you got there.<br>
<br>
Carol: So, in other words, we just played stolen property? <br>
Jimmy: That's about right.<br>
<br>
Carol: Well.<br>
<br>
Q#2 - Carol: Let me change the subject. How come you recorded Because The Night with Patti Smith? <br>
Jimmy: Well, Bruce and I were staying at the same hotel during the 
making of Darkness, and uh, one night - I was working with Patti at 
night and Bruce during the day because Bruce's album took a little 
longer than expected - and I played Bruce what I had done with Patti up 
to date, and I had felt that there wasn't a single yet, meaning a '45, 
and uh, I asked Bruce if he had any song that he thought would fit on 
Patti's record, and he mentioned Because The Night. I, I had also felt 
the same way, so he picked up his acoustic guitar and he played it. He 
raised the key 'cause he figured Patti would never do it in the higher 
key, and it sounded real good, and he said, 'Why don't you send her a 
tape and see what you think?' And that's what I did and she liked it and
 he came out to the studio one day and we cut it. <br>
<br>
Carol: Oh, it sounds great (laughs). <br>
Jimmy: Well, it is great.<br>
<br>
Carol: (laughs)<br>
<br>
Q#3 - Carol: Let me ask you one last question, uh, there's a lot of 
bootlegging going on as far as Bruce Springsteen, a lawsuit too, these 
are tapes evidently of concerts you recorded with Bruce, how do you feel
 about this bootlegging stuff? <br>
Jimmy: Well, I think what the kids are getting, the kids are being 
robbed because they're getting 5th or 6th generation tapes and also, 
material that's not . . . wasn't, that wasn't okayed by Bruce. I think 
that if they, the kids should wait and Bruce will put out a live record,
 which will be representing what HE, representative of what he wants out
 as a record, uh, it's very bad quality, and I don't think it's fair.<br>
Carol: Okay, well thanks a lot Jimmy. <br>
Jimmy: Thanks a lot, Carol.<br>
<br>
Closing - Carol: Well, I guess you know, you're Bruce fans right, you 
know there's a lot, uh, tapes around, like, you say, well, why can't we 
play a bootleg here or why aren't we gonna play you a tape? Well, the 
answer is 'cause it isn't right. You know, it's not fair to Bruce, and 
so, that's why, uh, we don't play it here at WPLJ but the records are 
great, you know, and I really, I'll tell you I a boss, you know, and he 
won't let me do anymore Bruce Springsteen night. He's a great guy but I 
understand there are other rock artists in the world, like The Who and 
The Beatles, you know, so we gotta back to them in just a second. I 
really hope you enjoy it here at WPLJ, uh Bruce Springsteen night. PLJ 
weather for the city, clear and less humid tonight, low in the upper . .

Sylvio Essinger<br>
September 22</strong><br>
<br>
By the middle of his autobiography , released last year , The Who 's 
guitarist , Pete Townshend , confided : " Until the punk movement came 
along , there were only two competitors to our crown : the Rolling 
Stones and Bruce Springsteen . " Almost 40 years after Fri Pistols and 
The Clash had threatened to turn the tables , the Stones are still there
 , supreme , filling stadiums with his rock -powered sex and money , led
 by the big capitalist entrepreneur Mick Jagger . And Springsteen ? He's
 The Boss , the worker- boss, the guy who opens and closes the store and
 it still makes the most intense rock shows on the planet , as one might
 attest the early hours of Sunday, the closing number of the World Stage
 , in penultimate day of Rock in Rio<br>
<br>
Over more than two hours, Bruce led his E Street Band for a show that 
practically only had peaks - and those who said there was a man about to
 turn 64 years old would be quickly challenged . For all practical 
purposes , who occupied all the spaces of the stage was that dreamy boy 
from New Jersey , permanently plugged in and always willing to give 101 %
 of themselves to ward off even the most fearsome competitors .<br>
<br>
As anyone who is facing a new client ( it was his first time in Rio ) , 
Bruce did not rely only on his vast repertoire of countless hits - who 
also happened to be some of the songs that best depicted the hard life 
of the working class and beautiful American . A touching gentleness , 
all his energy was focused on an opening show of the " Alternative 
Society ," Raul Seixas and Paulo Coelho , repeating what she had done a 
few days before , in São Paulo . The public had no time to breathe 
because then there he was pulling " Badlands " , spitting verses the 
microphone and beating his Fender Telecaster with peeling paint . After 
the martial " Death to my hometown ," with bass drum , accordion and 
violin , called for the repertoire of their latest album, " Wrecking 
Ball" and illustrated in an exemplary manner throughout the Americanness
 that Bruce does not have the slightest qualms in showing the badge .<br>
<br>
At that point in time , the singer had begun to withdraw all its extra- 
musical devices to let the public four : sat on the speaker , ran among 
fans of gurgling , spoke in Portuguese , poured sweat on his guitar and 
still embodied Pastor Springsteen , calling the mass in a gesture that 
came to remember James Brown in his time at " the Guy Who works Harder 
in Show Business ." Bruce asked , the people did. Bruce stopped , the 
people shouted, " ce - Bru , Bru - ce , olê , olê , olê , olê ! And the 
hits flowed , in a demonstration of what American rock is simpler and 
also more strong , beginning with " Hungry heart" . After that , he 
promised he would play the entire album " Born in the USA " . Said and 
done . In the same order the disc, were the title track , "Cover me" , "
 Darlington County " , "Working on the highway" , " Downbound train" , "
 I'm on fire" , "No Surrender ," " Bobby Jean " " I'm going down " , " 
Glory Days " , " Dancing in the dark " ( with traditional fans climb on 
stage ) and" My hometown " .<br>
<br>
Justice is done : Bruce did not stop a minute, but the E Street Band 
also sweated to follow the boss , especially guitarists Steve Van Zandt 
and Nils Lofgren and saxophonist Jake Clemons . With this class in the 
containment , the singer went on songs for the new album ( " Shackled 
and drawn" , " Land of Hope and Dreams " ) , an absolute classic ( " 
Born to Run " ) and a little dance after all was a night out on Saturday
 ( " Twist and shout " with Quote " La Bamba " ) . In the latter, the 
fires broke out , made a broom behind the door to evict the guests , but
 Bruce did not have to beg and still later returned to the stage , 
guitar and harmonica in hand, to say goodbye with a "This Hard Land " . 
Was cansadinho ? Your problem. Because the standards Springsteen was 
even a short concert . Oh , and he promised to return soon . Book from 
now the energy .</div>

Mark: Yeah, I hear, boy I hear it is was gang-busters last night at the Garden<br>
Bruce: Yeah, yeah, it was a lot of fun<br>
<br>
Mark: Yeah, I hear you had them dancing in the aisles. How you feeling? 
You've been a busy guy, man - live broadcasts and just everywhere<br>
Bruce: Yeah, it's been nice, it's been really uh, this is the last leg 
of the tour, you know, this is out last like, 4 or 5 shows, you know<br>
<br>
Mark: Yeah<br>
Bruce: And everybody's sort of, rather than getting more tired, 
everybody sorta got, sorta woke up again, you know, and the band's 
playing real good and we had uh, had a lot of fun down in Jersey, you 
know where we did the broadcast from<br>
<br>
Mark: Yeah, we carried that on the air. It sounded just great, sounded like you were having lots of fun on stage<br>
Bruce: Yeah, that was the first time we'd been back home in about, oh about a year and 1/2<br>
<br>
Mark: Oh man, a year and a 1/2<br>
Bruce: Except for like, you know, a week or so, here and there, you know<br>
<br>
Mark: So, are you going to get to take a little vacation time, and uh, get back to laying in the sun for a while?<br>
Bruce: Oh, I got about, let's see, I got 3 more shows and then I got 
about uh, 4 weeks off, 3 weeks, 3, 3 weeks off and then we're gonna, 
start in again November 1st and go to New Year's, you know<br>
<br>
Mark: Oh man<br>
Bruce: So<br>
<br>
Mark: That must be hard, day after day, every day, a new city, wake up in a hotel room<br>
Bruce: I like doing it, you know, it's like uh, some people I guess, 
that (?) kind of life really, you know (coughs), like I don't have, I 
don't have like, I'm not, I'm not married, I don't have a lot at home or
 nothing, you know, so, and uh, ever since I was a kid, I always wanted 
to travel around, you know, there's no way that I ever would have been 
able to travel around if I hadn't, you know, if I hadn't played or if I 
hadn't been playing, you know<br>
<br>
Mark: Yeah<br>
Bruce: So, like eh, usually, a lot of times if I get a chance to go home, I don't, I just go on to the next city or something<br>
<br>
Mark: Yeah. Bob Seger was here the other day, he did the same thing, 
instead of going home, he just hung out here in Boston for a day and 
went on to do more <br>
Bruce: Yeah, you get use to it, you know, it's like what happens, is 
like, you're used to staying in hotels or the motels, like when you go 
home like, you got no air conditioning (chuckles) or nobody makes your 
bed (chuckles) (Mark laughs), or you're like, like nobody uh<br>
<br>
Mark: Yeah, yeah, a lot of people are like that, the guys on the road 
get real tired of the road, they want to go home, and they want to get, 
when they get home, they're so bored that they want to go back out on 
the road again<br>
Bruce: Yeah, that happened to me last time. I went home. I stayed home 
for about, 3 days and then I got in a plane, I went some place, you 
know, it was like, I went for about a week, came back, it takes a while 
to, you know, after you've been out or so long, we've been out since, 
May sometime, it uh, it's hard to wind down, to like, you know, sittin' 
around at home or, you know<br>
<br>
Mark: When do you write songs? What's, what's the best frame of mind for
 you when you write songs? Is it airplanes, hotel rooms or a day off?<br>
Bruce: I sorta write songs, like, it's like, it's very similar to, like 
when do you raid the refrigerator, you know, (chuckles), it's like, when
 you're hungry or something, you know, or like, could be in the middle 
of the night or it could be, could be anytime, like, it's sort of, it's 
like uh, it's just a feeling you get, you know, like uh, the closest 
thing is like if you get hungry for food or you get, you know, it's like
 uh, some sort of thing<br>
<br>
Mark: This comes over you all of a sudden<br>
Bruce: Yeah, you go to, and you pick up the guitar, and like, something 
comes to you or like uh, we've been doing this new song, Point Blank, 
which I just wrote it, like a rehearsal one day, no, I wrote it at a 
soundcheck, matter of fact, I think it was uh, I think it was here in, 
at the Music Hall<br>
<br>
Mark: Great<br>
Bruce: You know, where like, it was before uh,<br>
<br>
Mark: Last year you were here like uh, 5 nights or something<br>
Bruce: Yeah, we played, like I forget, didn't we play here at the 
beginning of the tour, which doesn't seem that long ago now, it seems 
like we were just here and played about, played, you know, 3 nights 
there, and uh, it was during one of the soundchecks that I came up with 
the music and stuff, during the tour I wrote the rest of the words and 
stuff, so, it sort of happens anytime, you know, there's no real, I 
don't have the discipline too much to sit down<br>
<br>
Mark: Yeah<br>
Bruce: And a lot of times, it doesn't work if you try to force yourself thru it<br>
<br>
Mark: Do you think the uh, space in time between uh, Born To Run and 
Darkness On The Edge Of Town was uh, a hindrance or that it helped uh, 
you know, build up the anticipation of more Springsteen music or how do 
you view that intense, I know you were involved in a whole lot of legal 
weirdness during that time?<br>
Bruce: You know, it was like, it was good and it was bad, you know, it 
was like, it was good because I had a lot of time to sit around and 
straighten out the things that had been bothering me, not just legally 
and all that, you know, and all that mess but<br>
<br>
Mark: Like in your life too?<br>
Bruce: But just my, just myself, I had a chance to put all that stuff in
 perspective, like all that big promotion and stuff, you know, all that 
uh, all that stuff that went down at that time, and, and uh,<br>
<br>
Mark: But it's like<br>
Bruce: It just gave me a chance to uh, to get, to get that stuff, you know, where it should be and<br>
<br>
Mark: What<br>
Bruce: It really, I don't think, you know, it was like, you know, in a 
way it irks that we were out of, you know, we were out of commission for
 like 2 years, however long it was, you know, and uh, but in a way, it 
was like uh, it was good for me, you know, like it was a good thing like
 that, it was good for me because, you know, I got to write the songs I 
wanted to write and I had some time and I got (?) all my stuff straight,
 you know, like if I was gonna go on and maintain my sanity (laughs) I 
had to get, you know, I had to get straight one way or another you know<br>
<br>
Mark: People said there was uh, I don't know if this is fact or fancy 
that there was a lot of material that you wrote during that period but 
because you weren't in, in recording and putting out records that it 
sorta got shelved. Is that true?<br>
Bruce: Yeah, that's, that's true, like uh, I wrote, when we went in to 
do Darkness, I had already written 13 songs, uh, out of which, you know,
 very few of them made it on the record, so there was sort of like, a 
missing album at least, you know<br>
<br>
Mark: Yeah<br>
Bruce: And uh, you know, so, that was, that was, that was a problem, you know that was a problem<br>
<br>
Mark: Do you, do you have any ambitions of like uh, going into television or movies? <br>
Bruce: Aw, not right now, you know, nothing like that<br>
<br>
Mark: 'Cause they say you look like Al Pacino, you know, on the cover of the new album<br>
Bruce: Oh, everybody, it's funny, I was, I was telling a story for a 
while, you know, where like, I was sitting in uh, we'd just played in 
New York and I was sitting in this restaurant, you know, and I'm sittin'
 there and I see this guy looking at me, you know, and I say 'Oh'<br>
<br>
Mark: Uh oh<br>
Bruce: Be recognized, you know (chuckles), and like, you know, so, like 
I'm sittin' there and I trying to, trying to act cool like I don't 
notice, you know, and the guy comes up to me and, he comes up real slow 
and he sticks out his hand and like I'm trying to be, you know, real<br>
<br>
Mark: Cool?<br>
Bruce: Cool (?) right, he says (Bruce does the guy), 'AL PACINO!' (laughs), 'Hey, how ya doing?, you know, I said 'Naw, no'<br>
<br>
Mark: No, Bruce Springsteen, (Mark does the guy) 'No, you're not, you're Al Pacino.<br>
Bruce: You know, it was like, it was funny<br>
<br>
Mark: How do you like playing the big halls? Now, I noticed, I know all 
the times that I've seen you, and I've seen you a bunch of times in New 
York and around here in Boston. You've always, always played the 5 and 
6,000 seaters, and now, you've gone to like, the 10 and 12 and 15, which
 is great 'cause it accomodates more fans but I was wondering if, how, 
uh, musically you feel about some of those halls. <br>
Bruce: Well, it's funny, it's like, and the toughest one is, and I'll be
 honest with you, the toughest, the toughest one is the Boston Garden<br>
<br>
Mark: It's an old uh, clunker, isn't it?<br>
Bruce: And, 'cause I had, I had played there in 1973,<br>
<br>
Mark: Right<br>
Bruce: Opened up for Chicago there,<br>
<br>
Mark: That's right<br>
Bruce: And I remembered the place, I remember, I said 'Oh.' It was the two things I remember about it was that it was old<br>
<br>
Mark: It smelled bad<br>
Bruce: Big, you know (chuckles), but we, we had played like, other big 
places on the tour and well, like we knew like the uh, right amount of 
sound to bring in and we knew, you know, how to cover it and like we had
 some of our best shows in, in, in the bigger places, you know, all the 
shows we did at the Garden, they went over, you know, we had a great 
time there and like all the shows, the shows in Philly and Cleveland and
 stuff so, what happened yesterday was when I got there, I started to 
walk around, so, I walked all, all around the building and I realized 
that, that the, that building has like unique, you know, problems that 
are unique to itself, you know<br>
<br>
Mark: Right<br>
Bruce: And that it's made for the action to be right in the middle of 
the floor, you know, like it's for boxing, or for whatev.., for hockey, 
whatev..., it's made for the action to be centered, the middle of the 
floor, soon as you stick something down at one end, you know, 'cause 
like the overhanging balconies and the way, it's, it's not only a sight 
problem, it's a sound problem, you know, so I was like really, I was 
pretty worried there, you know, and I went backstage and I was grumpin' 
all around and stuff, you know, and then, about 20 minutes before we 
went on, I started to hear everybody screamin' out front, you know, it's
 like, I didn't know if was like (?) for the frisbees or something you 
know, but it sounded like, it just sounded like a really, sounded like a
 great crowd, like before we went out<br>
<br>
Mark: Yeah, they were hot last night<br>
Bruce; Yeah, you know, and then we went out there, like the crowd, this 
is why, really why I wanted, wanted to call is because, is 'cause the 
kids that were there last night, the people that were there last night, 
like made me and the whole band feel so comfortable, you know<br>
<br>
Mark: Great<br>
Bruce: That, it was like, it just, it just turned into a great night, 
you know, and I was feeling great, you know, and it was something where 
like it was really, it was just, it was, you know all the kids, all 
those people there, it was really like a nice, as if, they're really 
warm, you know, nice, great crowd, and like<br>
<br>
Mark: That's a nice thank you to Boston, Bruce<br>
Bruce: Well, it really was, and it's like, you know, 'cause the first 
thing I said (?), you know, call somebody, you know, tell them how great
 it was, because I was a little nervous and like everybody, we were a 
little worried but we went out there, and it was like, it just made 
everybody feel so at ease and stuff that and it was nice because I think
 it was, a funny thing about the place, you know, it was that, it's a 
little, you know, it's got, it's got that, it's got that little low, low
 rent kind of ceiling to it ((chuckles)<br>
<br>
Mark: It sure does<br>
Bruce: It's a little more of, uh, you know, a little more of a rock 'n' 
roll feeling to it in a funny, you know, in a funny kind of way<br>
<br>
Mark: Well, you got prepped, you know, Bob Dylan was here last Wednesday
 and then two nights with Seger and then yourself, so the place was all 
warmed up and ready for you Bruce: Yeah, they were like, they were 
really ready, and they, I just wanna, you know, I just wanna thank 
everybody and I wanna, especially the kids, there was a lot of kids, 
send stuff backstage that I don't have a chance to say 'thank you' for 
it, they send all the cakes and all sorts of stuff<br>
<br>
Mark: Thank you, Bruce, that's real nice, I know when you, a lot of guys
 when they get to your level of stardom, you know, quote unquote, they 
really don't have to really do any radio calls or anything because your 
records will sell anyway and we sure appreciate it because it makes you 
seem, it makes you real human, you know? <br>
Bruce: You know, that's me, a real human! (cracks up laughing)<br>
<br>
Mark: Will you do me a big favor?<br>
Bruce: Sure, what can I do for you? (still laughing some)<br>
<br>
Mark: WBCN is having it's, we're 10 years on the air. I know you're 
familiar with the station from years past but I'll just get out of the 
way here for a second if you could say, 'Hi, this is Bruce Springsteen 
and you're listening to uh, 10 years of continuous hot music' or 
something like that on BCN, I'd appreciate it, and we'll tape it and 
play it over and over again<br>
Bruce: Oh, wow, I, I don't, I don't know, I don't, you know, you should (nervously laughs), uh<br>
<br>
Mark: No?<br>
Bruce: I feel a little funny, yeah.<br>
<br>
Mark: Okay (laughs) <br>
Bruce: I never(?) good at text stuff (still a nervous laugh)<br>
<br>
Mark: Okay<br>
Bruce:Alright? (still a nervous laugh)<br>
<br>
Mark: Then never mind<br>
Bruce: But uh, really again, I want to thank you guys and I want to 
thank, you know WBCN has been great, you know, has been great to me, and
 uh, I just want to thank you very much and uh, thank all the kids that 
were at the show last night, because they really, I was a little 
worried, they really turned it into, like, you know, a great night for 
us, so<br>
<br>
Mark: Bruce, thank you, where is it off to tonight? <br>
Bruce: Okay, thanks a lot<br>
<br>
Mark: Okay<br>
Bruce Bye-bye<br>
<br>
Mark: I'll see you<br>
<br>
