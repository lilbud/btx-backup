<br>
ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE<br>
By SEAN SENNETT<br>
March 11, 2014 </strong><br>
<br>
More than 40 years into his legendary career, Bruce Springsteen is still
 breaking new ground: He and the E Street Band recently played their 
first ever concerts in the South African cities of Johannesburg and Cape
 Town, and then hit, again for the first time, Perth and Adelaide in 
Australia. The Antipodean run of shows saw Springsteen play a staggering
 129 different songs over thirteen nights, including surprise covers 
such as a Nebraska-esque reading of Lorde's "Royals." Even given 
Springsteen's incredibly high standards, its been a thrilling series of 
gigs. We caught up with Springsteen at his Auckland, New Zealand, hotel 
room where he spoke about his latest shows, High Hopes, his upcoming EP,
 his choice of live covers and his songwriting process.<br>
<br>
<br>
On your Australian tour, you chose Australian songs to play. Barry Gibb 
even tweeted that you brought the Bee Gee's "Stayin' Alive" "back to 
life." You really got inside the lyric. What was your process for that?<br>
<br>
We said, "Who's the biggest Australian act in the world?" The Bee Gees. 
On my playlist I have a huge disco section — I like disco music from the
 Seventies a lot. The Bee Gees made great records and "Stayin' Alive" 
was simply a great song. The lyrics are in our wheelhouse. I told Steve 
[Van Zandt], "Tomorrow night, 'Staying Alive,'" and he goes, "You got me
 on that one. I don't know how we're gonna do it." And Tom Morello said,
 "I don't want to have any other ideas. Because I want to see how you're
 gonna pull that one off." Steve's going, "I can't imagine it." I go 
okay, I'm not going to be able to sing it where they sang it, so I have 
to think about Marvin Gaye on What's Going On and Trouble Man and I'm 
thinking of blaxploitation pictures. I thought, if I bring this thing 
down to my key and I play it like a blues, this is inner-city blues; it 
could slip right on to What's Going On. I had to find my voice in it. I 
got the lyrics up on the computer and just started to sing it. When it 
sounded believable to me I knew we'd be fine. It was like, "Okay, I can 
be this person in this song."          <br>
<br>
You really are pushing the envelope with the whole idea of what a rock 
concert should be. You're learning new songs on the day of the concert. 
In Brisbane you added an eight-piece string section and played The Wild,
 the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle. Are you trying to broaden the 
boundaries?<br>
<br>
No, we're just kind of doing what we've always done. I tried to bring a 
few things back: storytelling, which I stopped doing for a long time. I 
don't do it every night, but it's something you make up on the spot. I 
kind of brought that back a bit. I just wanted to do something different
 for Brisbane because we played the other three records, and we'd been 
having a great time playing stuff from The Wild, the Innocent. I also 
was very wary because I knew we didn't really hit [Australia] until 
1985. I assumed there would be a lot of people who didn't know the 
record at all.<br>
<br>
You said something in Sydney, with regards to playing your music live, 
about how you and the band "have to do it, and it has to be done." <br>
<br>
Most musicians are musicians because they have to be. Bonnie Raitt used 
to come back and always tease me. She said, "Boy's got something in him.
 It's gotta come out." That's the case. The case is you have to do it. 
Why would you play for three hours and 45 minutes or something? Gotta do
 it. It's gotta be done.<br>
<br>
You once said that the hardest thing was preserving the will. That was 
in the Nineties, but you obviously preserve the will really well.<br>
 <br>
Maybe it's hard for some people, but  I got enough bad things running 
around my head; it remains incredibly medicinal and centering. Retaining
 the will to do it, once you commit, once I book this show, you may be 
backstage, you may be tired, you maybe want to go to sleep, but that 
walk, whatever it is, 25 yards from the dressing room to the stage, it's
 never failed me. Something turns on between those two points.<br>
<br>
You've said that with your records, the opening song basically sets up 
questions that are answered through the rest of the album. High Hopes 
came together from various sessions, but it feels very cohesive. <br>
<br>
Things come together. The Seeger Sessions record came together over a 
decade. And it sounds completely cohesive. As your work life gets 
longer, ten years isn't that much. So material that I made in a ten-year
 span is recent material for me. That's like I made it yesterday. It's 
gonna have a lot in common with itself. This was just a lot of music I 
had around that I really liked that I wanted to release. Amazingly, the 
key to it came while we were down here. We were in Sydney and Tom 
suggested we play "High Hopes." It sounded very good, 
[Producer-engineer] Nick DiDia happened to have a studio. We recorded 
like "Just Like Fire Would" the same day. Suddenly we got these two 
songs that sort of have life in them. I have this other group of songs 
I'm carrying around, and suddenly Tom is present, and alchemy happens. 
That's how this record came to life.What I like about the record is it's
 not particularly conceptual. It's a group of good songs. I think it 
plays easily like that. It's easy on your ear, and even though there's 
some very big songs on it — "American Skin" and "The Ghost of Tom Joad."
 I enjoyed it — it was not heavily fought over. That's one of its 
charms. It was just kind of done relatively quickly.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just to get an idea of your songwriting process might be, a song like 
"Harry's Place," a Rising outtake that deals with gangsters, secrets and
 deception — was that a case of you wanting to tell a story and finding a
 tune to go with the story?<br>
<br>
No, "Harry's Place," I started to write and I said I like the writing I 
did on The Wild, the Innocent. What if I was going to try to write 
something like that now? It initially started out as just me on the 
piano. [Producer] Brendan [O'Brien] heard it and I believe Brendan may 
have turned it into this rhythmic piece and made the sound that's very 
compelling. It's a very hard sounding thing for us.<br>
<br>
A song like "Hunter of Invisible Game," that is a great title. Did you get the title first and work backwards?<br>
<br>
I wrote [the title] down years ago, and I don't remember a lot about it 
except I said, "That's a nice title." I wrote it down and it sat there. 
Then I did more reading of other things. And I started to get into this 
sort of post-apocalyptic idea. The idea of these travellers in the 
wasteland, and what's the guy trying to do? He's trying to hold onto 
their humanness, their humanity in all of this ruin. That was the idea. 
That's who this guy is, the guy who is hunting out remnants of what 
makes the spirit. It was one of those songs that came together a certain
 way and I didn't think much about it when I wrote it. I put it away. 
Now it's probably one of my favorite things on the record. We played it 
the other night for the first time and it seemed to have some impact.<br>
<br>
You're releasing a 12-inch vinyl EP, American Beauty, for Record Store 
Day on April 19. There are four previously unreleased songs: the title 
track, "Mary Mary," "Hey Blue Eyes" and "Hurry Up Sundown." What can you
 tell us about it?<br>
<br>
It's got some nice things on it. This is material from the past decade. 
Some were demos that I never cut. I believe "American Beauty" was a demo
 I made that I didn't end up cutting with Brendan. I believe "Hurry Up 
Sundown" was the same thing. The other two songs, one was cut for maybe 
Magic or Working on a Dream and they're just good music that didn't get 
onto this record, and was sitting there. I thought it's a nice time to 
support the record stores, which are dwindling and get some new music 
out at the same time.<br>
<br>
You've toured Australia twice in a little over a year and this has been 
your first trip to New Zealand in a decade. Europe has been massive for 
you. It must feel pretty good to be so well received away from home?<br>
<br>
The shows are very emotionally successful. They're just these incredibly
 communicative events that occur. We're outside of our own country, so 
there seems to be something heightened about it. I guess what I 
basically feel is that in Europe, rock music as a form for the 
discussion and expression of ideas and events of the day has retained 
its currency. It has done less so in the States. It's been co-opted 
there by pop and hip-hop and a lot of other fabulous forms. But it's 
kind of taken the hegemony away from rock.We have a fabulous and 
supportive audience in the United State's that's been with us for many 
years. I love playing to them.For some reason, perhaps in Europe and 
maybe in Australia also, I don't know, but [rock] seems to be very alive
 and vital as a form to write about the day's issues. It may have 
something to do with the different levels of popularity we have outside 
of the country at this moment. It's basically our form, and it's just 
fascinating.</div>

A Rutgers course probes biblical imagery and religious themes in Springsteen’s music.<br>
02/18/2014<br>
Deena Yellin<br>
The Jewish Week<br>
   <br>
<br>
Jews have long felt a special kinship with rocker Bruce Springsteen; his
 Jewish-sounding name, left-wing politics and his penchant for singing 
about the downtrodden have made Jewish mothers everywhere insist he’s 
one of the tribe. <br>
<br>
The gravely voiced troubadour has been hailed as the Messiah of rock and
 roll, his concerts likened to religious revivals and his songs packed 
with biblical imagery. The banter among Springsteen’s E Street bandmates
 is downright heimishe — with Springsteen reportedly promising an 
audience a “rock and roll bar mitzvah” — and he’s been known on occasion
 to break out into “Hava Nagila.”<br>
<br>
So it should perhaps come as no surprise that the rock icon has most 
recently been the subject of a course at Rutgers University in which 
Azzan Yadin-Israel, a professor of rabbinic literature, explored 
religious motifs in the famed Garden State native’s work.<br>
<br>
The 20 students in the one-credit, fall semester seminar “Bruce 
Springsteen’s Theology” grappled with the interpretation of biblical 
stories in his songs, beginning with “Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.’”
 Springsteen’s first album, released 41 years ago, to “Wrecking Ball,” 
released in 2012. Springsteen’s latest album, “High Hopes,” will be 
included in a future course, said Yadin-Israel.<br>
<br>
The students pored over the songwriter’s lyrics, along with their 
theological sources, with all the intensity of Talmudic scholars. Not 
surprisingly, Yadin-Israel attests that the students were “incredibly 
engaged in the material.”<br>
<br>
The seminar, offered in the fall for the first time, generated so much 
interest that Yadin-Israel plans to offer it again in the spring, and he
 is also working on a book based on the material in the course.<br>
<br>
Joseph Duncan, a freshman from Holmdel, N.J., who plans to study 
engineering, said that as a longtime Springsteen fan and as a musician 
who plays in a band, he jumped at the chance to take the course. He 
learned that “Springsteen is able to take ideas many of us are familiar 
with and use them to preach his own spiritual message. … A common thread
 we saw in his works is that Springsteen depicts two realities: one of 
the idealistic religious and heavenly world, and one of what he seemed 
to find the true reality. In this reality Springsteen accepts a world 
driven by human emotion, by greed, and by the search for immediate 
satisfaction.” One example raised in class was “Thunder Road,” in which 
the biblical theme of salvation is equated to human actions, Duncan 
said. “Salvation here is seizing the moment, driving into the night (and
 presumably spending it) with someone you love. To put aside obstacles 
in the way of pure, raw love and just live, and in this way achieve 
salvation on Earth. I found his juxtaposition of the biblical world and 
the world around us within a song to be absolutely fascinating.”<br>
<br>
Samantha Glass, a Rutgers freshman and aspiring English major from 
Hoboken who grew up listening to Springsteen because her father is a 
fan, signed up for the course because she knew it would make her feel at
 home.<br>
<br>
“I grew up listening to the melodies and not hearing what he was 
saying.” In Yadin-Israel’s class, she began hearing those songs in a new
 way. For example, many of Springsteen’s songs seem to be about cars and
 love “and that’s it,” she said. But Yadin-Israel taught her to look 
beneath the surface into the deeper meaning of the text. He urged the 
class to examine the original Bible passages and pointed out 
similarities. “You have to read and understand the references to get a 
deeper understanding of the whole picture,” she said. “I was kind of 
surprised to learn that his lyrics were so intellectual and he thought 
so much about this [spirituality]. … The biblical references seem 
deep-seated.”<br>
<br>
Yadin-Israel’s course, which garnered headlines in Rolling Stone and 
Time, was not the first time the gospel of The Boss has been dissected 
in the hallowed halls of academia: Princeton University has offered 
“Sociology from E Street: Bruce Springsteen’s America,” University of 
Rochester has offered a history course on the singer and Monmouth 
University has given several seminars about Springsteen.<br>
<br>
And Yadin-Israel is certainly not the first to appreciate the biblical 
underpinnings of Springsteen’s lyrics. Rabbis, scholars and music fans 
have long talked about the spirituality in his songs. Some rabbis have 
even quoted the vocalist’s lyrics as a way of adding resonance to their 
own messages in sermons and lessons.<br>
<br>
“Bruce explores many of the same themes that make religion such a deep 
part of the human spirit. His songs are about how to maintain faith and 
love and hope, even through times of suffering,” observed Rabbi Jeremy 
Kalmanofsky of Congregation Ansche Chesed in Manhattan. Even 
Springsteen’s concerts are religious experiences, he mused. “There is 
nothing like being with tens and thousands of other people in an arena, 
as Bruce sings ‘My City of Ruins.’ He’s chanting ‘I pray for the faith, 
Lord. I pray for the strength, Lord,’ and we all chant ‘Rise up!’ It’s a
 true religious moment.”<br>
<br>
When Rabbi Dan Ornstein, spiritual leader of Congregation Ohav Shalom in
 Albany, and a longtime Springsteen fan, teaches the Cain and Abel 
story, he urges his students to examine Genesis Rabbah and other 
commentaries. “But of course we look at ‘Adam Raised A Cain.’ That song 
takes the story and gives it a unique interpretive twist. It’s a modern 
Springsteenian midrash, as are his references to the Promised Land, 
building a cross from the tree of evil and the tree of good and others. 
Whenever pop and general culture can draw students nearer to ancient 
biblical texts in a way that isn’t cheesy and forced, and doesn’t overdo
 the analogy between the two forms of literary expression, it is 
helpful.”<br>
<br>
Probing the work of rock stars is not exactly common terrain for 
Yadin-Israel, an associate professor of Jewish studies and classics who 
has taught at Hebrew University, the University of Chicago, the Jewish 
Theological Seminary and the University of California. His latest book 
is “Scripture and Tradition: Rabbi Akiva and the Ironic Triumph of 
Midrash” (University of Pennsylvania Press 2014).<br>
<br>
Yadin-Israel first became a Springsteen fan at age 12 — after his family
 moved from Israel to Cleveland — and he has followed the Boss’ career 
closely since then. He was moved to teach his latest course after 
publishing an article in The Jewish Review of Books about an Israeli 
band that uses rabbinic Hebrew in its lyrics. He started thinking about 
the band’s American equivalent, and Springsteen came to mind.<br>
<br>
Yadin-Israel notes a progression in Springsteen’s understanding of 
biblical and religious matters. Early in the rocker’s career, he notes, 
redemption is understood in terms of cars, and the open road, whereas in
 more recent albums, it has to do with being engaged in the world and 
with the power of relationships. “There’s a theological evolution,” he 
said of Springsteen’s lyrics, adding that biblical references ring clear
 through all of them.<br>
<br>
He also found that Springsteen, although he was raised in a Roman 
Catholic home and attended Catholic school, refers more often to themes 
in the Hebrew Bible than in the New Testament.<br>
<br>
“On a literary level, Springsteen often recasts biblical figures and 
stories into the American landscape,” said Yadin-Israel, citing “Adam 
Raised a Cain” and “The Promised Land” as examples. “Adam Raised a Cain 
references the first biblical family and all its tribulations. There are
 a lot of statements he makes that can be understood in a more secular 
way but carry a kind of theological resonance. I’m referring to themes 
like the Promised Land or images of redemption. You can obviously use 
those terms more loosely. I think he purposely brings the cultural 
heritage into his songs.”<br>
<br>
In “Thunder Road,” the protagonist tries to woo a woman in theological 
terms by advising her [don’t] “Waste your summer praying in vain for a 
savior to rise from these streets.” While she wants an unattainable 
ideal, he says the only redemption he can offer is in this world — 
what’s beneath his dirty hood, meaning his car. “He says he’s no hero, 
he can only offer her a worldly redemption. … It ends up being a 
fascinating theological debate,” says Yadin-Israel.<br>
<br>
Springsteen gives several Bible stories a modern revision: “Rocky 
Ground” is about 40 days and 40 nights of rain, and “In the Belly of the
 Whale” offers a different perspective on the story of Jonah. <br>
<br>
A Springsteen song can do just what a powerful midrash does, 
Yadin-Israel says: “He retells a story so you think about the original 
story in a new way.”<br>
<br>
The biblical images are reflective of Springsteen’s Catholic upbringing 
as well as the nature of the blue-collar narratives that he explores in 
his various albums, said professor Ken Womack, who teaches English at 
Penn State University and is the author of “Bruce Springsteen, Cultural 
Studies, and the Runaway American Dream (Ashgate, 2008).”<br>
<br>
Womack applauded Yadin-Israel’s initiative in teaching Springsteen and 
the Bible. “I have found through my own teachings that rock lyrics are 
useful inroads into a wide variety of disciplines, including religion, 
history, politics, sociology and literature.”<br>
<br>
While Yadin-Israel said he anticipates a sustained commitment to this 
topic, he stressed that his primary area of interest will always remain 
rabbinic and classical literature. “When they talk about the classics, 
they aren’t referring to classic rock,” he quipped.</div>

takes the story and gives it a unique interpretive twist. It’s a modern 
Springsteenian midrash, as are his references to the Promised Land, 
building a cross from the tree of evil and the tree of good and others. 
Whenever pop and general culture can draw students nearer to ancient 
biblical texts in a way that isn’t cheesy and forced, and doesn’t overdo
 the analogy between the two forms of literary expression, it is 
helpful.”<br>
<br>
Probing the work of rock stars is not exactly common terrain for 
Yadin-Israel, an associate professor of Jewish studies and classics who 
has taught at Hebrew University, the University of Chicago, the Jewish 
Theological Seminary and the University of California. His latest book 
is “Scripture and Tradition: Rabbi Akiva and the Ironic Triumph of 
Midrash” (University of Pennsylvania Press 2014).<br>
<br>
Yadin-Israel first became a Springsteen fan at age 12 — after his family
 moved from Israel to Cleveland — and he has followed the Boss’ career 
closely since then. He was moved to teach his latest course after 
publishing an article in The Jewish Review of Books about an Israeli 
band that uses rabbinic Hebrew in its lyrics. He started thinking about 
the band’s American equivalent, and Springsteen came to mind.<br>
<br>
Yadin-Israel notes a progression in Springsteen’s understanding of 
biblical and religious matters. Early in the rocker’s career, he notes, 
redemption is understood in terms of cars, and the open road, whereas in
 more recent albums, it has to do with being engaged in the world and 
with the power of relationships. “There’s a theological evolution,” he 
said of Springsteen’s lyrics, adding that biblical references ring clear
 through all of them.<br>
<br>
He also found that Springsteen, although he was raised in a Roman 
Catholic home and attended Catholic school, refers more often to themes 
in the Hebrew Bible than in the New Testament.<br>
<br>
“On a literary level, Springsteen often recasts biblical figures and 
stories into the American landscape,” said Yadin-Israel, citing “Adam 
Raised a Cain” and “The Promised Land” as examples. “Adam Raised a Cain 
references the first biblical family and all its tribulations. There are
 a lot of statements he makes that can be understood in a more secular 
way but carry a kind of theological resonance. I’m referring to themes 
like the Promised Land or images of redemption. You can obviously use 
those terms more loosely. I think he purposely brings the cultural 
heritage into his songs.”<br>
<br>
In “Thunder Road,” the protagonist tries to woo a woman in theological 
terms by advising her [don’t] “Waste your summer praying in vain for a 
savior to rise from these streets.” While she wants an unattainable 
ideal, he says the only redemption he can offer is in this world — 
what’s beneath his dirty hood, meaning his car. “He says he’s no hero, 
he can only offer her a worldly redemption. … It ends up being a 
fascinating theological debate,” says Yadin-Israel.<br>
<br>
Springsteen gives several Bible stories a modern revision: “Rocky 
Ground” is about 40 days and 40 nights of rain, and “In the Belly of the
 Whale” offers a different perspective on the story of Jonah. <br>
<br>
A Springsteen song can do just what a powerful midrash does, 
Yadin-Israel says: “He retells a story so you think about the original 
story in a new way.”<br>
<br>
The biblical images are reflective of Springsteen’s Catholic upbringing 
as well as the nature of the blue-collar narratives that he explores in 
his various albums, said professor Ken Womack, who teaches English at 
Penn State University and is the author of “Bruce Springsteen, Cultural 
Studies, and the Runaway American Dream (Ashgate, 2008).”<br>
<br>
Womack applauded Yadin-Israel’s initiative in teaching Springsteen and 
the Bible. “I have found through my own teachings that rock lyrics are 
useful inroads into a wide variety of disciplines, including religion, 
history, politics, sociology and literature.”<br>
<br>
While Yadin-Israel said he anticipates a sustained commitment to this 
topic, he stressed that his primary area of interest will always remain 
rabbinic and classical literature. “When they talk about the classics, 
they aren’t referring to classic rock,” he quipped.</div>

BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN &amp; THE E STREET BAND – PERFORMING THE RIVER: MADISON SQUARE GARDEN,<br>
 NEW YORK, NY 11/8/09<br>
by Ross Warner </strong><br>
<br>
It’s been a little over a week since Bruce Springsteen returned to the 
NY Metropolitan area.  After closing down Giants Stadium with two 
performances each of Born To Run and Born In The U.S.A apiece (but sadly
 only one of Darkness Of The Edge Of Town), the two Garden shows looked 
to be even more special.  Earlier that week, it was announced that on 
the first night, he would play The Wild, The Innocent And The E Street 
Shuffle and on the second, the entire 20-song double album, The River.  
Neither of these had ever been performed in their entirety and the 
second show looked to be an especially ambitious project, even for The 
Boss.  Then again, Bruce wouldn’t have tried if he knew he wasn’t up to 
it.<br>
<br>
Up to it was putting it lightly.  After modifying the lyrics to 
“Wrecking Ball” to suit The Garden crowd with a shout out to Earl “The 
Pearl” Monroe, he introduced the album.  With the packed house hanging 
on his every word, Bruce told the crowd that this would probably be the 
only time he’d perform the whole record due to its length.  He then 
discussed (at greater length than he usually does on stage) the context 
from which the album came.  He suggested that it was the start of more 
the mature themes that would define Nebraska and Tunnel Of Love and 
reminded the audience that it was written during a recession.  But 
rather than spell out the possible parallels to the present day, he 
simply “brought us down to The River!”  With that, he launched into the 
album’s opening trio of “The Ties That Band,” “Sherry Darling” and 
“Jackson Cage.”  The first two were even more fiery than usual and 
“Sherry’s” reference to taking the subway back to the ghetto was met 
with approval by the crowd.  “Jackson Cage” was so rock solid, you’d 
never know how rarely he plays it.  <br>
 <br>
But even the old war horses seemed more vital when played within the 
context of the whole album.  Bruce and Steve’s duet of “Two Hearts” was 
the perfect set up for an emotional “Independence Day.”  “Crush On You,”
 one of the evening’s nuggets was played balls-out, after Bruce 
facetiously introduced it as a “classic.”  “I Wanna Marry You” was 
played as a duet to Mrs. Springsteen.  After the soul searching of “The 
River” and “Point Blank,” “Cadillac Ranch” brought the house down.  “I’m
 A Rocker” sounded great with the added trumpet.  After stunning 
versions of “Fade Away” and “Stolen Car” (not performed with the band 
since 1985), ” “Ramrod” seemed to have more gravity than its usual 
freewheeling self.  With a more mature voice, literally, “Stolen Car” 
was as haunting as it’s ever been on record. <br>
<br>
"The Price You Pay,” only recently resurrected for the closing of the 
Spectrum, was fantastic and segued into a “Drive All Night” that was a 
show into itself.  “Wreck On The Highway” was even more bittersweet than
 it was intended because it meant that the journey through this most 
joyous yet complex work was over.  “Atlantic City” seemed like a perfect
 selection and was a version for the ages.  Arthur Conley’s “Sweet Soul 
Music,” not played since the Tunnel Of Love Express Tour, was the 
perfect rave-up to kick off the encores.  Bruce also led the band 
through an impromptu “Can’t Help Falling In Love,” which led into “(Your
 Love Is Lifting Me) Higher and Higher.”  Bruce revived this one for the
 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame concerts and played it the night before with
 Elvis Costello.  It fit perfect with this set of songs.  On this night,
 no one was complaining.  Not even close. <br>
