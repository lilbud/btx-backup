Bruce Springsteen releasing " The River " rarities in new Box Set<br>
<br>
The Bruce Springsteen faithful will soon have much more material to pore
 over with the release of “The Ties That Bind: The River Collection,” a 
box set exploring the era around the Boss’s 1980 double album. The new 
four-CD, three-DVD collection (plus a coffee-table book) will be out 
Dec. 4 via Columbia.<br>
<br>
The extras include “The River: Single Album,” the original 10 tracks 
that Mr. Springsteen recorded in 1979 for the project; another CD of 22 
rare and unheard studio outtakes from “The River” sessions, which 
continued into the next year; an hourlong documentary, directed by Thom 
Zimny, that features Mr. Springsteen reflecting on that period; and 
concert footage from a 1980 show.<br>
<br>
The live material, nearly three hours from a set Mr. Springsteen played 
on Nov. 5, 1980 at Arizona State University, was recorded on four 
cameras, with multitrack audio. There’s also footage from a “River” tour
 rehearsal that shows the E Street Band figuring out live arrangements 
for the album’s tracks.<br>
<br>
“The River,” which Mr. Springsteen has said was when he “first started 
to tackle men and women and families and marriage” in song, was his 
fifth studio album and first to hit No. 1 on the Billboard chart.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">ROLLING STONE INTERVIEW WITH THOM ZIMMY<br>
OCTOBER 19, 2015</strong><br>
<br>
In July 1981, Thom Zimny went to the Brendan Byrne Arena in East 
Rutherford, New Jersey and saw Bruce Springsteen in concert for the 
first time. The venue had just opened its doors to the public, and 
Springsteen stopped by to kick off the final leg of his River world 
tour. "I can still remember the arc of the show," Zimny says. "It had 
quiet moments, but also celebrations."<br>
<br>
<br>
Two decades later, Zimny began working with Springsteen when he edited 
his Live in New York City HBO special, and since then has directed 
in-depth documentaries about the making of Born to Run and Darkness on 
the Edge of Town. His latest project is Ties That Bind: The River 
Collection, an upcoming box set featuring a new documentary about the 
making of The River, a concert shot in Tempe, Arizona, in 1980 and 
footage of the band rehearsing. Rolling Stone spoke to Zimny about how 
he put it all together.<br>
<br>
How long ago did you start work on this?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The day after the Darkness set came out, we 
started to explore and begin the archive of the video side, piecing 
together every frame and every square inch of the Tempe concert that we 
had, down to getting the multis for it. It was a four-camera shoot, so I
 started cutting that. I worked first on the Tempe concert, and then I 
started talking to Bruce about the River doc. One of the things we 
talked about, not having the studio footage from Darkness, was exploring
 the story in a different way.<br>
<br>
In my 15 years with Bruce and Jon [Landau], there's been time in the 
cutting room where they will start talking about music or something else
 they like, like films. As a director, I wanted to capture that quiet 
tone so the viewer feels like they were sitting in Bruce's backyard with
 an acoustic guitar as he goes through the story of The River, and not 
have the exact same journey that we had with Darkness, which was sharing
 it with the band and engineers and other people involved in it.</strong><br>
<br>
I imagine that in some ways the lack of actual in-studio footage was a 
blessing since it forced you to tell the story in a different way.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Absolutely. One of the first things we 
talked about with The River was trying to find stills from the era that 
had not been seen. So I reached out to all the key photographers from 
the era and gathered many images that weren't out there. There's also 
color rehearsal footage of the Pennsylvania rehearsals shot by Barry 
Rebo. It's footage that was not bootlegged, though there is a wide shot 
out there in the world. But this is stuff that has not been released.<br>
<br>
So there were elements to work with in telling the story differently 
that made it an exciting film. The whole "Independence Day" section you 
saw wasn't planned, but it ended up being an amazing acoustic 
performance. Also, we got a lot in the interview that hadn't been 
covered before</strong>.<br>
<br>
How many songs does he play in the documentary?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">He plays "Ties That Bind," "The River," an 
amazing version of "Two Hearts," "Wreck on the Highway," "Independence 
Day" and a portion of "Point Blank."</strong><br>
<br>
How long ago was this filmed?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">It was filmed at different points in the 
last year, though some of the interior things were filmed even earlier. 
When I say "interior things," I mean I did a few setups with his 
cassettes and his photographs and did them straight off the idea of 
Telegraph Hill and some of the locations. The film is a dialogue with 
Bruce, but one of the surprising things about it is that it's really as 
much a "making of" as much as a personal journey.</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">There is a bit about making The River, but 
more importantly writing it and how he used it to explore things that 
interested him, like marriage. The film ends with him saying, "I think I
 created this community in The River to explore the feelings of what it 
would be like to be married." He's 30 at this point and thinking about 
those things. Much like Darkness, that took it to a whole other level 
and gave me a chance to explore the music differently and also have him 
share stories of the art experienced his life.</strong><br>
<br>
Just to clarify, Bruce is the sole person interviewed in the entire documentary?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Yes.</strong><br>
<br>
Were there other shows in the vault from the tour besides Tempe?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">There are other shows, but all the masters 
are not much higher than the bootlegs, much like I dealt with in '78. 
The ideal show we had access to, although it isn't complete, was Tempe. 
The beauty of the Tempe concert, is that we have this amazing surround 
sound mixed by Bob Clearmountain. I also had the opportunity to cut from
 four isolated cameras. It really gives an opportunity to let things 
play out and it's not a line cut from the screens [in the concert hall].</strong><br>
<br>
Why was the show filmed?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">I think it was just to document it. There 
were bits used for a commercial at one point. I think it was just like 
the Born to Run concert where it happened with no real plans to release 
it. It was a documentation of the time by Barry Rebo and his crew.<br>
</strong><br>
The show isn't complete?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">They didn't shoot the complete show. It's a big portion of it.</strong><br>
<br>
The portion I saw was lit much better than the 1975 and 1978 ones.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">It is. The technology was better and the 
image reads better. There was also an opportunity to color-correct in a 
way that gave it the best image quality we could. And God, those mixes 
are amazing with headphones. The Clearmountain mixes are just really, 
really powerful.</strong><br>
<br>
What format did they shoot it in?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The tapes are on three-quarter video. This was the very early days of video.</strong><br>
<br>
Was there any doubt that this was the best one to release from the whole tour?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Not really. Also, the other shows are 
completely accessible online, and it would be a shame to not have this 
show out, especially with how powerful a show it is. It's not like we 
looked at Largo and said, "We've got a great copy of Largo here." This 
is the show from the River that both both visually and sonically 
represent, for Bruce, a great example of the tour and the band at that 
time.</strong><br>
<br>
It was great to finally see a show from that tour. There's great little 
moments, like Bruce dancing like Elvis during "Detroit Medley," you 
could obviously never know from bootlegs.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Absolutely. There's so many moments in the 
Tempe concert where you finally get to see things that maybe you heard 
on a bootleg source or on E Street Radio. Also, the songs were new at 
the time — the band had such raw energy. Even though it's not a complete
 show, it still gives the dramatic arc of the show. You have "Drive All 
Night" and the slow songs, like an amazing version of "The River." Then 
you have songs from other parts of the catalog, like "Tenth Avenue 
Freeze-Out," that really get the crowd jumping.</strong><br>
<br>
How much rehearsal footage was shot?<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
I don't know the total duration, but we were able to pull out a solid 
half our that gives you "Crush on You," "Sherry Darling" and a lot of 
other great moments of the band working out. It's not stops and starts, 
but them going through the songs. It's a great bonus feature along with 
Tempe. You get a complete journey of the record.<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
It's definitely one of his lesser-explored classic records. There's so 
much out there about Born to Run, Darkness, Born in the U.S.A<br>
.<br>
<strong class="text-strong">I totally agree with you. It made it a great
 opportunity for a filmmaker. I was really surprised by a lot of things 
he said in the interviews. I had read a lot about The River and gone 
over all the interviews from the time. I was therefore able to know what
 was familiar territory and when I got something special. The beauty of 
the interviews was that only a few people were there. I was in Bruce's 
farmhouse, and he was sitting there with an acoustic guitar. He was 
talking about the record, but also something bigger, which was how music
 was being used to explore things in his life that he hadn't experienced
 yet, like marriage and having kids. Those are themes throughout the 
record. I knew right away when he started to talk about that in the very
 first interview that I had a different film, and I had a quieter film 
than Darkness and Born to Run, and that's the tone I wanted to go for.</strong><br>
<br>
He played the album straight through at Madison Square Garden in 2009, 
and they filmed that. Did you think about including that on the 
collection?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">I have that footage, but there was never any
 real talk about that being part of the box set. I don't know if Bruce 
was considering that. But with this documentary, we really focused on 
the images, the stills and also the sound and how the story unfolded. We
 wanted a quieter film and a more intimate film.<br>
</strong><br>
I guess everything on there is from the era, so jumping ahead to 2009 might have been jarring.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
Yeah. When you open up the box, you're in the era of The River. You're 
seeing clips. You're seeing photos. More importantly, on the first disc,
 you're listening to the remastered album. You're going back in the 
journey of hearing the record, and then you get the outtakes, and that's
 part of the story. Then you get to the documentary, and that's another 
part of the story. Then you get the rehearsal footage and then Tempe. I 
think with all those elements, put together, you really get the exciting
 point of view of both making the record, but also how it played out 
live.</strong><br>
<br>
Are you going to do Nebraska next? Born in the U.S.A.?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">I don't know yet, but I enjoy the idea of 
Nebraska being next. I would love to start Nebraska, but I have no plans
 of if yet. I didn't know about The River until one day after Darkness 
when Bruce gave me the call.</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The demos of him working on the Nebraska 
songs are fascinating. You can hear him turn the pages on his notebook 
as he goes through the songs.<br>
Fascinating, right? And the tape deck and trying to get the cassette onto vinyl with Chuck Plotkin ...</strong><br>
<br>
Then there's Born in the U.S.A. That's a huge story that could almost be a two-hour theatrical movie.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">There's a lot to go through there, too. Yeah, let's keep our fingers crossed. </strong></div>

OCTOBER 25, 2015    <br>
<strong class="text-strong">NJ . COM<br>
THE FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TIME AND NEWSWEEK COVERS<br>
BY JIM BECKERMAN<br>
 OCTOBER 27, 2015 </strong><br>
<br>
Mr. and Mrs. America – meet Bruce Springsteen.<br>
<br>
He's "small, tightly-muscled" (Time). "Scruffy" (Newsweek). "A glorified
 gutter rat from a dying New Jersey resort town who walks with an easy 
swagger that is part residual stage presence, part boardwalk 
braggadocio" (Time).<br>
<br>
In the history of rock, there are a few legendary breakout moments. 
There's Elvis on "The Ed Sullivan Show" in 1956. There's the Beatles 
arriving at Kennedy Airport in 1964. And there's the amazing day, Oct. 
27, 1975 — 40 years ago Tuesday – when Bruce Springsteen appeared 
simultaneously on the cover of both of the nation's top news magazines, 
Time and Newsweek.<br>
<br>
Amazing, not least, for the members of Springsteen's E Street Band — who
 found themselves overnight in the world's hottest rock franchise.<br>
<br>
"There aren't superlatives you can utilize to tell you what kind of 
feeling," recalls drummer Max Weinberg, who had joined the E Street Band
 only a year earlier. "We were young kids, we were in our 20s, it was no
 secret that [Springsteen's] first two records hadn't really sold. To 
see that coverage was very exciting."<br>
<br>
It may also be the last time in rock history that a single performer galvanized an entire culture.<br>
<br>
There would continue to be rock and pop superstars – Prince, Kurt 
Cobain, Lady Gaga – but their star shine would be diffused, broken up 
over an increasingly niche-oriented music landscape.<br>
<br>
Lots of Americans didn't know who Kurt Cobain was until the day his 
death was announced: April 5, 1994. But after Oct. 27, 1975, everybody 
knew who Bruce Springsteen was.<br>
<br>
"The Bruce covers were unique," says Robert Santelli, executive director
 of the Grammy Museum and the author of "Greetings From E Street: The 
Story of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band" (2006).<br>
<br>
"There had been other pop acts on the cover of Time and Newsweek, but simultaneously?" Santelli says.<br>
<br>
There is an inside story here, he says — harking back to the days when 
journalism, like the music industry, was a more robust institution.<br>
<br>
Cultural impact<br>
<br>
Time and Newsweek were in neck-and-neck competition for readers, and 
neither one wanted to miss the Bruce bandwagon – moving at breakneck 
pace ever since "Born to Run," released Aug. 25, 1975, and hugely hyped 
by Columbia Records, began climbing the Billboard charts, reaching No. 3
 by the weeks of Oct. 11 and 18.<br>
<br>
But rock aficionados are one thing, middle America another.<br>
<br>
"Neither news magazine wanted to be out-scooped by the other," Santelli 
says. "The buzz on 'Born to Run' was so powerful, the record had such 
cultural impact, that both news magazines went out on a limb, putting 
this relatively unknown pop person on the cover. It was risky. Who knew 
Bruce Springsteen at that time?"<br>
<br>
Some people did, of course. For several years Springsteen had been the 
darling of a coterie of critics, especially in New York and Boston ("I 
saw rock-and-roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen" – Jon 
Landau), despite the lackluster sales of his first two albums, 
"Greetings From Asbury Park" and "The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E 
Street Shuffle," both released in 1973.<br>
<br>
And there had long been a fraternity of diehard Springsteen fans – in 
New Jersey especially – who had been seeing Bruce in small clubs since 
the late 1960s and insisting to anyone who would listen that Bruce was 
the second coming of Dylan, Elvis and Mahatma Gandhi.<br>
<br>
For many true believers, the week when the rest of America suddenly 
learned of their hero was a sublime told-you-so moment. Added to which 
was a huge dollop of Jersey pride.<br>
<br>
"There was a tremendous sense of ownership," recalls Eileen Chapman, who
 lived in Asbury Park at the time (she's now the manager of the Bruce 
Springsteen Special Collection for Monmouth University).<br>
<br>
"All of Bruce's fans and friends were running around showing each other 
the magazine covers," Chapman remembers. "Everybody was very proud of 
what Bruce had accomplished."<br>
<br>
So who was this Bruce Springsteen that the folks in the dentist's office
 in Dubuque, and the magazine-browsers in the supermarket lines in 
Topeka, read about in 1975?<br>
<br>
"Street smart but sentimental," proclaimed Time's article. "The wild 
onstage energy of a pinball rebounding off invisible flippers." "A 
dervish leaping on the tables, all arms and flailing dance steps, and a 
rock poet as well." A rocker who leaves audiences "exhausted and on fire
 at the end of a concert."<br>
<br>
A rapturous article, as only Time could write them, "The Backstreet 
Phantom of Rock" (unsigned, but apparently written by Jay Cocks) 
captured the giddy excitement that Springsteen seemed to generate in his
 live appearances.<br>
<br>
Newsweek's article, "The Making of a Rock Star" (by "Maureen Orth with 
Janet Huck in New York and Peter S. Greenberg in Los Angeles") was more 
cynical, using words like "hysteria" and "hype" and asking whether 
Springsteen wasn't, after all, a flash in the pan, another Gary Glitter 
or Barnaby Bye (who?) or Judi Pulver (who?).<br>
<br>
Like Time, but more insistently, it talked about the massive publicity 
buildup around Springsteen's career and new album, propelled by 
"abrasive" manager Mike Appel (whom Springsteen was to break with 
shortly after) and the Columbia label.<br>
<br>
"Some people are asking whether Bruce Springsteen will be the biggest superstar or the biggest hype of the '70s," Newsweek said.<br>
<br>
Junk-food junkie<br>
<br>
Hindsight is 20-20. But it has to be said that Springsteen's career over
 the last four decades has – ironically — been a lot healthier than 
Newsweek's. His next release, "The Ties That Bind: The River 
Collection," a four-CD set, is due out Dec. 4. Newsweek ceased print 
publication in 2012, and though it returned to the newsstands in 2014, 
it's hardly what it was 40 years ago.<br>
<br>
Other fun facts we learned from the two national magazines? Springsteen 
was a junk-food junkie. "Nicknamed 'the Gut Bomb King' because of his 
passion for junk food, he would show up at a Monopoly tourney with 
armfuls of Pepsi's and Drake's cakes" (Time). This was before the Gut 
Bomb King became The Boss — with a Gold's Gym body he's kept well into 
his 60s.<br>
<br>
We learned that Springsteen's fans were "teeny boppers" (Newsweek) and 
"not teeny boppers" (Time). That the name "Springsteen" is "Dutch" 
(Time, correct) and "German" (Newsweek, incorrect). That he lives at the
 Jersey shore in "comfortable – but not lavish – quarters" (Time) and 
"it's likely he'll end up with a movie contract" (Newsweek).<br>
<br>
Also, "a typical gig lasts over two hours" (Time). They of course 
couldn't have predicted the marathon Springsteen concerts to come – like
 the record-breaking four-hour-six-minute show Springsteen did, as part 
of his 2012 "Wrecking Ball" tour, in Helsinki.<br>
<br>
"In summer [in Finland], darkness is, like, two hours," Weinberg 
recalls. "It was light when we started. It got dark, and then when we 
finished, it was light again."<br>
<br>
There was one person who may not have been entirely happy about the Time
 and Newsweek coverage in 1975, Santelli says. That's Springsteen.<br>
<br>
"He didn't think this was a beautiful thing that happened to him," 
Santelli says. "He thought wow, this is incredible pressure on me. Talk 
about the weight on his shoulders."<br>
<br>
The Newsweek article, especially, had an emperor's-new-clothes 
undertone, for all the extravagant prose. In the months following "Born 
to Run" and the two magazine covers, there started to be a backlash to 
all of Columbia's promotional overkill. Some critics were throwing the 
term "new Dylan" in Springsteen's face.<br>
<br>
Something to prove?<br>
<br>
The beneficiaries of all this, Santelli says, were the fans. In his 
"Born to Run" era concerts, Springsteen went onstage like he had 
something to prove. The resulting performances, Santelli says, were some
 of his best ever.<br>
<br>
"The greatest shows occurred immediately after that, in 1975, 1976," he 
says. "I walked out of there, it was like going to church."<br>
<br>
The ultimate comment, however, came from the critic who was perhaps 
hardest to please. Douglas Frederick Springsteen would later become the 
subject of Springsteen's autobiographical song about fathers and sons, 
"Adam Raised a Cain." His response to the 1975 Time and Newsweek media 
blitz was laconic, Weinberg reports.<br>
<br>
"His father had the best line of all," Weinberg says. "He said, 'Better 
you than another picture of the president.' Nixon was going through all 
his stuff at that point."</div>

Springsteen’s Most Anxious Album<br>
<br>
BY AMANDA PETRUSICH</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
The world is not lacking monuments to Bruce Springsteen. His work has 
been exhaustively parsed, reissued, celebrated, annotated, and admired. 
At present, it is wildly difficult to find a reasonable person willing 
to decry his oeuvre as insignificant or inadequate. In the 
nineteen-sixties, after Woody Guthrie got sick, Bob Dylan seemed primed 
to become the next working-class champion, the one shoved forward to 
represent the rest of us. But, in the end, something was off—he was too 
sneering, too cerebral. When Springsteen arrived, he was the chocolate 
Lab to Dylan’s housecat. He loved back.<br>
<br>
“The River” was first released in 1980, and it was almost titled “The 
Ties that Bind” (a song of the same name came to open it). The 
twenty-track album, Springsteen’s fifth, concerns itself almost 
exclusively with interpersonal relationships and the passage of time. 
The photograph on the back cover of the LP features, tellingly, four 
paper bride dolls and one bewildered-looking groom.<br>
<br>
Columbia will reissue “The River” as “The Ties that Bind: The River 
Collection,” a boxed set containing four CDs, three DVDs, and a glossy 
coffee-table book, on December 4th. (Merry Christmas, Dad!) Much like 
the entries in Dylan’s Bootleg Series, it proffers a more expansive 
portrait of a particular album, including, in this case, twenty-two rare
 and unheard outtakes from the studio sessions.<br>
<br>
In recent years, Springsteen’s work has become more expressly 
political—it now directly addresses policy, not merely the workaday 
ramifications of policy—an agenda that continues to be tolerated if 
perhaps not embraced by his acolytes. Among conservative fans, 
Springsteen’s beliefs are often willfully misunderstood. This has been 
going on since at least since 1984, when Ronald Reagan praised “Born in 
the U.S.A.,” a seething anti-war anthem, for its optimism. New Jersey 
Governor Chris Christie’s fandom is so swooning and absolute it nearly 
inspires chagrin.<br>
<br>
But “The River” isn’t a political record. Springsteen made it when he 
was newly thirty, not yet married but questioning the institution, 
bending it to the light, checking it for scratches, the way a person 
might inspect an old LP at a yard sale. It is as if he began to 
understand his life as finite and contained, and started asking the 
tough questions about what it means to be alone, and about the kind of 
person—if any—he might like by his side.<br>
<br>
“The River” contains Springsteen’s first charting single, “Hungry 
Heart,” an exuberant pop song about a lost man (the piano riff at its 
center was inspired by the Four Seasons’ hit “Dawn (Go Away)”). At 
first, Springsteen tried to hand the song off. In the spring of 1979, 
the Ramones played a show at the Fast Lane, a boxy, salt-corroded night 
club near the boardwalk in Asbury Park. Springsteen appeared backstage 
afterward to express his admiration. “So I said to him, I said, um, you 
know, would you write us a song?” Joey Ramone later recalled.<br>
<br>
But when Springsteen played “Hungry Heart” for Jon Landau, his erstwhile
 manager, Landau chastised him for always giving away his best jams (a 
year earlier, he had ceded “Because the Night” to Patti Smith; the 
Pointer Sisters’ take on “Fire,” a song Springsteen had intended for 
Elvis Presley, had recently made it to No. 2 on the pop charts). I’ve 
always been fond of Landau—a former and formative rock critic—for, in 
one of the earliest issues of Rolling Stone magazine, calling Eric 
Clapton a “master of the blues clichés of all the post-World War II 
blues guitarists,” a burn that supposedly facilitated the dissolution of
 Cream. “Keep this one close,” is what I like to think he whispered to 
Bruce after hearing “Hungry Heart.”<br>
<br>
If “The River” has a prevailing ideology, it’s that life is lousy with 
binaries: highs and lows, victories and losses, sins and blessings. 
Musically and lyrically, “Hungry Heart” is the apotheosis of that idea: a
 goofy, honking pop song about a man splitting on his family, only to 
find himself even more broken and lonesome. Here, Springsteen posits 
that lonesomeness—dissatisfaction—is essentially inevitable. The vocals 
have been sped up, made boyish and round: “We fell in love, I knew it 
had to end, we took what we had and we ripped it apart,” he chirps. His 
voice is unrecognizable. Later: “Don’t make a difference what nobody 
says, ain’t nobody like to be alone.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen borrowed the song’s title and chorus from a line in 
Tennyson’s “Ulysses,” a poem about a broken wanderer, a road dog who 
just can’t quit, “cannot rest from travel,” even in his dotage, even as 
his family waits at home. Tennyson seemed to consider him heroic, but 
his Ulysses is, by any reasonable metric, a tragic dude. He skulks 
about—“How dull it is to pause”—trying to convince everyone around him 
that perpetual motion is an antidote to the hard work of being alive. 
“Come, my friends, ’t is not too late to seek a newer world,” Ulysses 
preaches. His great purpose, he believes, is “To sail beyond the sunset,
 and the baths of all the western stars, until I die.”<br>
<br>
Ulysses shares this objective with nearly all of Springsteen’s most 
beloved protagonists, men who roam, adventure, and journey—or die 
pining. Road-as-redemption, road-as-actualization: these are 
foundational American myths. They’ve been collectively internalized with
 a remarkable impunity; decades of American art position the road as 
liminal, freeing, a kind of emotional purgatory where little registers 
beyond one’s own forward plunging. It is a malignancy we have 
nevertheless nurtured and protected. “Nothing behind me, everything 
ahead of me, as is ever so on the road,” is how Kerouac puts it. Wake up
 one morning, and the whole odious tangle seems too hard, too sad? Run 
like you’ve caught fire. Drive it like it’s stolen.<br>
<br>
Springsteen, for his part, isn’t sure if this instinct is cowardly or 
brave. I’m not sure, either. I suppose it’s both: “Like a river that 
don’t know where it’s flowing, I took a wrong turn and I just kept 
going.”<br>
<br>
There’s a lot of anxiety on “The River” about the permanence of love, a 
paranoia that reaches a kind of apex at the end of side two, with the 
odd sequencing of “I Wanna Marry You” and the album’s title track. 
Springsteen’s rumbustious, shirtsleeves-rolled-to-the-elbow narrators 
are fierce guardians of the women they care for—whether that protection 
is provoked or even desired is not addressed—and “I Wanna Marry You” 
sees one of them swallowing his unease regarding the durability of love,
 promising, instead, to do his best for his girl: “They say in the end 
true love prevails, but in the end true love can’t be no fairy tale,” he
 sings. “To say I’ll make your dreams come true would be wrong, but 
maybe, darlin’, I could help them along.” It is a thoughtful, studied 
offer.<br>
<br>
What happens next, though, is grim. “The River” starts with a high, 
blustery harmonica solo; it blows through the song’s opening bars like a
 tumbleweed. Written about his sister and brother-in-law, “The River” 
recounts a teen-age pregnancy, a joyless wedding, a broken economy, and a
 gray life. The vibe is airless resignation. “Now I just act like I 
don’t remember,” he sings. “Mary acts like she don’t care.” Because 
there is nothing else to do, they seek a baptism: into the river they 
dive.<br>
<br>
“The River” recalls Hank Williams’s “Long Gone Lonesome Blues,” a song, 
from 1950, in which an unnamed river functions similarly—a siren, 
beckoning the brokenhearted but denying them absolution. “But I got to 
the river so lonesome I wanted to die, oh Lord! And then I jumped in the
 river, but the doggone river was dry. She’s long gone, and now I’m 
lonesome blue,” Williams yodels.<br>
<br>
At the end of the second chorus, Springsteen emits a noise—”Oh, down to 
the river we did ride, mmm-yi-yi!” He’ll do it again, that broken little
 mumble after the line, but it’s never as fraught or as desperate as 
that first time, in which he sounds as if he’s been struck, hard, behind
 the knees. There, contained in that slur: all the loss in the world.<br>
<br>
Chronologically, “The River” occupies a curious spot in Springsteen’s 
discography, the dénouement to “Darkness on the Edge of Town” and a 
precursor to “Nebraska,” the bleak folk record Springsteen put out in 
1982. “Nebraska” is defiant in its wounded depictions of American 
strife: “Everything dies, baby, that’s a fact,” Springsteen sings on 
“Atlantic City,” the album’s spectral, ominous opener. And he means 
everything: not just our corporeal selves, but our devotions, 
obsessions, sacred oaths. Somehow, that’s not even the song’s most 
shattering bit: “I got debts no honest man can pay,” Springsteen 
concedes in the second verse. It is as pure an admission of spiritual 
defeat as any other line in American verse.<br>
<br>
“Nebraska” surprised fans and critics—Springsteen made it at home in 
Colts Neck, New Jersey, without the E-Street Band, using a four-track 
Portastudio tape recorder—but plenty of its themes, both musical and 
lyrical, were seeded on “The River,” which I still believe to be 
Springsteen’s most self-probing album. These songs—some crushing, some 
jubilant—explore how hard it is not to love but to be loved, to be held 
accountable to the devotion you’ve inspired in another person, to 
receive it without collapsing. The anxious narrators of “The River,” 
sometimes they get it right. Mostly they don’t. It doesn’t matter: the 
road goes on forever.</div>

<br>
August 25, 2015<br>
Wawrick McFadyen <br>
Sydney Morning Herald</strong><br>
<br>
Halfway through one of his 2014 Melbourne concerts Bruce Springsteen 
launched into Born to Run – the album. On saxophone was Jake Clemons , 
nephew to Clarence, the "big man", who had recently died. It was a 
magical link to the past. Clarence and Springsteen had come together 
decades ago to create a sound – and with it one of rock music's iconic 
album images.<br>
<br>
Forty years ago today it began, the rising of Bruce Springsteen from New Jersey boy to the Boss of the rock'n'roll kingdom. <br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Born to Run </em>was released on August 25, 
1975. It was the roar of an engine, accelerator to the floor. It was not
 so much a wall of sound as a battering ram. It had a power that could 
not be corralled, and when it was unleashed on stage, such as when 
Springsteen played the Hammersmith Odeon that year, it swept all before 
it. If ever an example of a turning point in an artist's career were 
needed, this was it.<br>
<br>
Before  Born To Run, Springsteen had released two mildly interesting 
albums, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. and The Wild, the Innocent and 
the E Street Shuffle. Record company executives were getting restless. 
Did this guy from New Jersey have the goods or not?  <br>
<br>
Turns out, he did. Turns out, he is one of the greatest writers and 
performers in rock history. But back in the early to mid-'70s, 
Springsteen was still wrestling with the musical form for his vision. 
The song Born to Run – running time four and a half minutes – took half a
 year to record. It began life, as Springsteen says in the documentary 
Wings for Wheels, The Making of Born To Run, with him sitting on the 
edge of his bed with his guitar. The phrase "born to run" emerged.<br>
It was "cinematic drama that I'd thought would work with the music I'd been hearing in my head".<br>
<br>
It became the record, he says, that changed his life. The panorama of 
the songs was imagined over a warm summer endless night, it was the 
surfacing of characters that would stay with him. The underpinning of 
the album was the tension of everyone "trying to get out", looking for 
the promised land, looking for the American dream.<br>
<br>
And for those Springsteen fans wondering what a 10th Avenue freezeout 
is, don't ask the author. "I have no idea to this day what that means, 
but it's important," he says in the documentary. And laughs. <br>
<br>
The '70s were heightened times: the Vietnam War would end in 1975, 
Saigon falling in April. That same month the  Khmer Rouge would capture 
Phnom Penh and thus would begin genocide to cleanse Cambodia. In the US,
 Watergate would play out with some of Nixon's henchmen beng sentenced. 
And in New Jersey,  a musician would find that the space between nowhere
 and stardom can be very short indeed. Two months after the release of 
Born To Run, Springsteen was on the cover of both Time and Newsweek 
magazines. His name would be mentioned in despatches with those of Bob 
Dylan, Marlon Brando, Mick Jagger and even Elvis. Music critic Robert 
Hilburn , of the Los Angeles Times, was quoted in the Newsweek profile, 
as describing Springsteen as "the purest glimpse of the passion and 
power of rock'n'roll in nearly a decade".<br>
<br>
In the October 9 issue of Rolling Stone Greil Marcus wrote that Born to 
Run was a "magnificent album that pays off on every bet ever placed on 
him ... it should crack his future wide open". <br>
Prescient words.<br>
<br>
Marcus went on: "The song titles by themselves – Thunder Road, Night, 
Backstreets, Born to Run, Jungleland – suggest the extraordinary 
dramatic authority that is at the heart of Springsteen's new music. It 
is the drama that counts.<br>
"He has touched his world with glory, without glorifying anything: not 
the romance of escape, not the unbearable pathos of the street fight in 
Jungleland, not the scared young lovers of Backstreets and not himself 
... Springsteen's songs ... take place in the space between Born to Run 
and Born to Lose, as if to say the only run worth making is the one that
 forces you to risk losing everything you have. Only by taking that risk
 can you hold on to the faith that you have something left to lose."<br>
<br>
In an interview in 1984, Springsteen says of Born to Run that it was about "searching, and faith, and the idea of hope".<br>
He and the band went into the studio in 1974, (from where he emerged 
from a different studio a year and half later) two members keyboardist 
David Sancious and drummer Ernest Carter were not there, replaced by Max
 Weinberg on drums and Roy Bittan on piano.<br>
<br>
While they were there, and in the immediate months afterwards, these sounds were swirling around:<br>
Blood on the Tracks (Bob Dylan), Have You Never Been Mellow (Olivia 
Newton-John), High Voltage (AC/DC), Young Americans (David Bowie), 
Physical Graffiti (Led Zeppelin), Feel Like Making Love (Roberta Flack),
 Blow by Blow (Jeff Beck), Katy Lied (Steely Dan), ABBA (ABBA), The 
Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table 
(Rick Wakeman), Playing Possum (Carly Simon), Captain Fantastic and the 
Brown Dirt Cowboy (Elton John), Venus and Mars (Wings), Love Will Keep 
Us Together (Captain &amp; Tennille), Tonight's the Night (Neil Young), 
Ego is not a Dirty Word (Skyhooks), Rhinestone Cowboy (Glen Campbell), 
Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd), The Who By Numbers (The Who), and A 
Night at the Opera (Queen)<br>
<br>
It was into this musical landscape that Springsteen took his vision. 
Born to Run wasn't revolutionary in terms of musicianship or recording 
techniques.  Where it did tear down the barricades was in its putting of
 flesh and blood, heart and spirit, hopes and dreams, sorrows and tears 
onto every note played and sung. Springsteen is a short-story writer who
 sings his characters to life. This is not fantasy, this is the life he,
 and his fans know intimately.<br>
<br>
Fellow New Jersey native Jon Stewart tells the story of his young adult 
life, of having finished his shift at a local bar of driving home in the
 early hours, believing he was part of a Springsteen song. Springsteen 
struck a chord, still does. <br>
After the high-octane rush of Born to Run, came the inevitable downer, 
the Sunday morning after the Saturday night, the low-key masterpiece of 
Darkness on the Edge of Town. It is equally important in his career as 
Born to Run.  Then in the mid-'80s came mega-stardom on the back of Born
 in the USA, and then back off the highway into the sideroads with 
albums such as Nebraska. He is his own man, and for the sake of the 
narrative, everyman. <br>
<br>
In that same 1984 interview Springsteen says: "I believe that the life 
of a rock'n'band will last as long as you look down into the audience 
and can see yourself, and your audience looks up at you and can see 
themselves."</div>

" The Heights"<br>

At this point I have more respect for Van Halen than Bruce Springsteen. 
They do what they do (yes, it is raunch), but at least it's not Music to
 be Prayed to. David Roth says he's not trying to make a heavy artistic 
statement, and he doesn't. He goes on to claim that rock'n'rolls toto 
makes no artistic statement. While this last may or may not be true, it 
is certainly true of Bruce Springsteen's music. Whatever he might once 
have had to say worth listening to is behind him, and all he can do now 
is produce dramatic pedants about cars, while "holy blood" is drunk in 
the back alleys by noble mechanics and pool hustlers who rob liquor 
stores on the side. There are two main aspects of the Springsteen myth, 
and with any luck I'll destroy them both forever right now. First 
there's this grease about Relevance. Relevance? He rewrites standard 
1950's song structures, and dresses them up with sentimental 
pinstriping: Johnny's face looks like a Blade/ He's gotta get That 
Girl/Gotta get her away/From That Guy (Her father, or another lover) 
Before the cops get him/ And if he dooesn't win her, he might as well 
drive the old camaro right off the boardwalk, And like that. Cars careen
 through Neon Nights, the cosmos are invoked, and it's all supposed to 
be so important.After all, to this man a Hurst on the floor is a 
religious artifact. The River's subjects are, inevitably, faceless 
ghosts of Pop cliches he created. All doubt is removed-the hints of 
staleness in Darkness on the Edge of Town are full-gore mold now, and 
it's painfully obvious that his ideas since the Time/Newsweek days 
haven't changed half as much as we're all supposed to think. For 
charity's sake I'll dispense with comments about individual tracks, as I
 fear I've already offended you legions of Brucejuicing Millah gulpers 
who take His lyric sheets almost as seriously as Your resumes. Not to 
mention all those screaming shrews in pink corduroy and ribbons, who 
park the skin machine right under the Darkness poster (sensitive setting
 at the ready). Suffice to say, if he were so god-awful talented and 
poignant, he'd be taking more chances with the sacred E-Street sound. 
Hell, he doesn't even take any chances with packaging (yes, fans, 
there's a dozen-odd pictures of Pacinosteen included here). Face it 
kids, this guy is a timid geek with nothing to say, and the only thing 
relevant about him is his market value to CBS execs. The problem with 
all this is that the poor bastard doesn't even know he's nowhere. 
Remember, he lives in a place that wants to take one of his 
running-in-the-night-from-Mom-and-Dad's-curfew ditties and make it the 
state song. Officially. And he's constantly told by NY press and its 
Dinosaurbreathed cousin, radio, that he is God. Well, Lisa, this may be 
hard for you to take, but the fact is, he's finally started to believe 
it. Which brings us to the second part of the Boss-Myth I'd like to 
destroy: His Devotion To The Fans. Please, please, please. Let it be 
known from here to eternity that Bruce Springsteen is now, was always, 
and will always be, devoted solely to Bruce Springsteen. His 
"painstaking" (the word seems to belong to him now) care in the studio, 
his marathon shows complete with multiple encores and Asbury Park 
story-telling, are only eveidence of this, albeit in a perverse way. You
 see, consideration of audience is one thing-masturbation with it is 
another. The endless hours, the endless "one more time" rave-ups, are 
done to get Bruce exactly what he has-mass adulation and fanfare. In the
 end, Springsteen's time, his songs, and his concerts, are only offered 
to re-inforce his image in his own eyes. What those eyes would see, if 
they were open, is the tinsel lounge-act of rock and roll. After all, 
given the similarity of their sentiments, does it really matter if the 
rehearsed stage patter is Steve and Clarence, or Steve and Edie? The 
quaintness and seeming naivete of earlier Springsteen ("I'm only doing 
it to have fun and give the kids a good show.") does not wear well on a 
public figure with the megastar status he so obviously courts. It's not 
"fun" to be in the studio for 93 straight hours rewriting one 
arrangement; nor does anyone do such for some abstract notion of "the 
kids." No, this effort is for someone with a large ego, someone afraid 
to risk his position in the world.</div>

PITCHFORK<br>
DECEMBER 7, 2015<br>
By Stephen Thomas Erlewine;<br>
</strong></span><br>
<br>
The River doesn’t flow—it floods. Bruce Springsteen’s fifth album gushes
 forth with the fury of a burst dam, delivering torrents of despair, 
inspiration, heartbreak, and joy. Coming after the deliberate twin 
masterpieces of Born to Run and Darkness on the Edge of Town, records 
epic in scope but precise in execution, The River not only appears to be
 a mess but embodies the classic definition of a double album: it seems 
to be a clearinghouse for every song Bruce Springsteen had at the ready 
in 1980. The Ties That Bind: The River Collection shows just how wrong 
that assumption is. Expanding the original 20-song double album to a 
4xCD set supplemented with video, it laughs at the notion that the 
original album was much too much by underscoring exactly how Springsteen
 intended the album to overwhelm.<br>
<br>
Initially, Springsteen planned to follow 1978’s Darkness on the Edge of 
Town with an album called The Ties That Bind but he withdrew the record 
in the fall of 1979, believing that it wasn’t "big enough." This claim 
came from the stage during a 2009 performance of The River at Madison 
Square Garden, with Bruce going on to say, "I wanted to capture the 
themes that I’d been writing about on Darkness. I wanted to keep those 
characters with me and at the same time added the music that made our 
live shows so much fun and enjoyable for our audience." On this box, the
 scrapped The Ties That Bind gets an official airing as the third disc 
on the set—here it’s dubbed The River [Single Album]—and it does indeed 
play like a truncated, miniature version of The River, containing in its
 10 tracks seven of the double-album’s songs, along with two alternate 
versions of tunes that wound up on the released record. What’s striking 
is what’s absent: shorn of its party songs, the record feels gloomy and 
haunted—even "You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)" in a lonesome Sun
 rockabilly incarnation feels like a transmission from the lonely black 
of night. It reiterates many of the themes of Darkness, only without 
aggression, fury, or precision, the very things that give that record a 
lift that fights against its undercurrents of hopelessness.<br>
<br>
Surely recognizing this deficit, Springsteen spent roughly another year 
in the studio, reviving old songs and writing new ones, arriving at 
full-blown, completed recordings of most of these tunes, then picking 
and choosing from his surplus to create the final album. The result was 
enough material for another double album, presented here as The Ties 
That Bind, a collection that runs two songs longer the 1980 double-LP 
but winds up six minutes shorter. This is an absurd amount of shelved 
material—and, even with this abundance, there are a handful of 
bootlegged cuts that didn’t make the grade. There’s a lot of unheard 
music here, even if some tracks are colored with new Bruce vocals, a 
slightly sour grace-note that is only notable upon close inspection.<br>
<br>
Listening through the box, it’s hard not to be struck by Springsteen’s 
labor-intensive creative method. He knew the broad outline of what he 
wanted to achieve, so he kept tweaking his material in the studio, 
rearranging and recording until he found just the right emotion. If The 
Cutting Edge 1965–1966 proves how Bob Dylan sought to capture the 
lightning of a live performance, Springsteen always is seduced by the 
illusion of a record: sure, he’s invigorated by live performance—and the
 Tempe concert included here is tremendous, the E-Street Band at the 
peak of their power—but he sculpts his albums out of tracks that are 
powerful as recordings, not simply songs.<br>
<br>
This is especially true of The River, which Bruce loaded up with the 
purest, hardest, and happiest rock’n’roll the E-Street Band ever cut in 
the studio. "She’s the One" pulsated to a beat borrowed from Bo Diddley 
and Darkness surged with desperate passion, but Bruce’s first four 
records rarely touched on the ecstatic joy that can be had from just 
making noise. The River is full of these moments ("Sherry Darling", 
"Crush on You", "I’m a Rocker", "Cadillac Ranch"), and some of the 
weightier items trade in this same sense of exuberance—a sense of 
desperation cuts against the grain of the sunny hook on "Hungry Heart", 
and "Two Hearts" spins headfirst into unfettered romanticism. But this 
music is so simple, so visceral, that it’s often been tagged as 
throwaway, the detritus surrounding the haunting "The River", "The Price
 You Pay", and "Stolen Car".<br>
<br>
Thing is, these throwaways give The River its cinematic scope. Some of 
the newer additions were cut from a familiar forlorn cloth 
("Independence Day", the closing pair of "Drive All Night" and "Wreck on
 the Highway") while "Point Blank" and "Jackson Cage" split the 
difference between the celebration and sorrow. But the biggest 
distinction between The River and the original Ties That Bind is this 
full-on bash, funny and furious and entirely sincere in its worship of 
the sounds rocking frat houses and AM radio in a '60s that didn’t belong
 to the Beatles. It’s the Springsteen album that can easily slip onto 
any show on Little Steven’s Underground Garage, and this party winds up 
providing an ideal counterpoint to the sweeter, sadder moments on The 
River.<br>
<br>
Take the second side, which opens with "Hungry Heart"—Bruce’s first 
genuine hit single, reaching number five on a combination of its hook 
and Springsteen’s general momentum—then dwells upon the cinematic escape
 "Out in the Street" and serves up two breakneck rockers before settling
 into the dreaminess of "I Wanna Marry You" and the stark "The River", 
the latter two hitting harder due to the companions. Each side is 
structured similarly, with the last song tipping slightly toward 
melancholy, the cumulative effect suggesting there’s no separating 
pleasure from the pain. It all comes at once and, depending on mood, The
 River either seems like the happiest or saddest of Bruce’s records: in 
its mess lies a mirror that reflects the listener’s state of mind.<br>
The Ties That Bind illustrates this sprawl was no accident. Within these
 22 rejects—some of them sneaking out as B-sides or on previous 
reissues, including the 1998 box Tracks and the bonus disc on 2003’s The
 Essential Bruce Springsteen—Springsteen explores the same terrain as he
 does on The River: urban romance, accidental violence, working-man’s 
blues, and restless nights. Like its parent, The Ties That Bind achieves
 a delicate balance between adult despair and adolescent freedom: he may
 dwell upon "Little White Lies" and "The Time That Never Was", but he 
also borrows a song title from Claudine Clark ("Party Lights") and tips a
 hat to Connie Francis’ beach classic Where the Boys Are ("Where the 
Bands Are"). Enough great songs didn’t make a cut that it’s possible to 
cobble together a killer single album from the outtakes—one that would 
open with the breathless "Meet Me in the City" and contain the 
cloistered paranoia of "The Man Who Got Away", the blank desperation of 
"Roulette", the open-hearted "Ricky Wants a Man of Her Own" and "From 
Small (Big Things One Day Come)", a heightened Chuck Berry story song 
Bruce turned over to Dave Edmunds. But like the completed album, what 
resonates is the magnitude of the sprawl itself.<br>
<br>
As they spill out, the songs play off each other, accentuating the 
sorrow or celebration heard in their predecessors. Combing through these
 outtakes, it quickly becomes clear how Springsteen, Van Zandt, and Jon 
Landau constructed each track to deliver its own specific visceral 
thrill and then culled through their finished product to find the cuts 
that fit their intended design. Some of these rejects rely on that 
headstrong old time rock’n’roll—"Living on the Edge of the World" bops 
along to its syncopated swing, "Paradise by the C" is a roadhouse jam 
highlighting Clarence Clemons—but others play like ripostes to the 
E-Street Band’s peers: the live "Held Up Without a Gun" (which would 
later morph into the finished "You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)")
 careens like Elvis Costello &amp; the Attractions, the chiming guitars 
of "Take ’Em As They Come" seem like an answer to Tom Petty and the 
Heartbreakers, while "I Wanna Be With You" pulses to the Iron City rush 
of Joe Grushecky &amp; the Houserockers.<br>
<br>
Thirty-five years after the release of The River, it’s easy to think of 
Bruce Springsteen as existing on a separate plane from such contemporary
 kindred spirits or perhaps as somebody who only belongs to part of a 
self-styled lineage that runs through Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan. By 
adding The Times That Bind, both the scrapped '79 LP and this new 
double-disc collection of outtakes, to The River, this box highlights 
the plain, prosaic ways he belonged to his time. On these 52 songs, 
Springsteen sings about gas shortages, cold beer, unemployment agencies,
 busted dreams, and Burt Reynolds, fleeting images of a blue collar 
America that unknowingly was entering its decay but these words are 
married to the sound of a working band that knows it has to work, aware 
that it has to have songs to fuel those marathon three hour shows.<br>
<br>
Springsteen never really let these straight-up rockers be part of his 
records again—maybe on Born in the U.S.A., but both "Darlington County" 
and "Working on the Highway" end in tears—but he also never quite worked
 the same way again, producing such a ridiculous surplus of finished 
material as he set out on his quest for bigger, greater things. The 
River brought Bruce to those heights, giving him his first number one 
album and Top 10 single, but it’s hard not to think of it as not a 
beginning but an end, the last record where he and the E-Street Band 
were not the biggest band in the land but merely the best. In that 
light, piling on a ton of unreleased music, all in the same spirit and 
feel as the final album and nearly as good as what made the cut, feels 
like a gift. And for those who may think four CDs and three DVDs are too
 much, consider this: for an album that is all about contradictions, 
excess and mess, more of everything is most certainly a good thing.</div>

The Backstreets Interview by Christopher Phillips<br>
December 10, 2015<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
A year and a half after the High Hopes excursion ended, it's tour time 
again. Next weekend, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band will 
reconvene for Saturday Night Live, a shot across the bow before hitting 
the road in January to play shows coast to coast. The River Tour 2016 
will have Bruce and the the E Streeters playing the full River album 
from top to bottom each night, along with outtakes from the era and 
"other Springsteen favorites." The season really begins with tomorrow's 
onsale blitz (may the ticket gods have mercy on us all). <br>
<br>
Before everything gets underway, Springsteen gave us a call at 
Backstreets HQ to fill us all in a little more on his plans, talking 
with editor Chris Phillips about The Ties That Bind, full-album shows, 
live releases, and this impromptu tour that he hardly saw coming, 
either.<br>
<br>
Backstreets: So this tour comes as quite a surprise!<br>
<br>
Springsteen: It was a surprise. It was a surprise to us, too, you know? 
We were kind of heading on a slightly different path — I had some new 
music, which was a little more of a solo record. I thought that I'd be 
out on that next. But then the box set came out, and we started to fool 
around with the idea of playing maybe a show… then, well, maybe two 
shows… and that turned into a short leg that we have going here in the 
States. It's a chance to let people experience the record start to 
finish, which we've only played once before. <br>
<br>
Of course every time a tour ends, there are always fans wondering if 
that's the last time we'll see the band, so it's exciting that we get 
another chapter. Do you know what the lineup will be this time?<br>
It's just the original post-[reunion] setup.<br>
<br>
No horn section, no singers?<br>
<br>
Yeah. So that should be fun. It was the kind of thing where I looked at 
it and decided, well, I have this project that I like a lot, but it's 
probably going to involve me playing by myself. And I figured if I get 
into that, it could be quite a while before the band ends up touring 
again. So having this little respite in there is gonna be a nice thing —
 it gives us a chance to get out there again before it ends up being a 
real long span.<br>
<br>
It seems like this is designed to be short — just 22 cities, nine weeks, and done. Is that how you're viewing it at this point?<br>
<br>
At the moment, yeah. I mean, could it go a little bit longer? It 
depends. It depends on… if we're having fun, if it suits itself to maybe
 a few more shows, we might consider it. But right now these are the 
only certain things we're doing. <br>
<br>
Obviously, you have a very dedicated European audience, and we're 
hearing from a lot of those fans who have their fingers crossed. Given 
that the '81 European leg was such an important part of the River era, I
 know there are high hopes.<br>
<br>
Yeah, that was the leg that established us in Europe — the River tour 
there was a major, major event for us. But I don't know yet, we gotta 
see — like I say, we initially planned for just a few shows, so I don't 
know if we're going to be doing a whole lot more than what we have 
planned, I can't really say.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What inspired you to hit the road for this one? It was five years ago, 
almost to the day, that you were at the carousel in Asbury Park for the 
Promise show there, but that was a one-off. You've had the Born to 
Runbox, and then the Darkness box... is there something about the River 
box that makes you want to go out and play it?<br>
<br>
The idea of touring was just, well gee, we have this big project, these 
projects take a long time to put together, and what is the way to get it
 the most attention, and make it the most exciting? And that's 
obviously: well, we could play! It's been long enough since we've played
 that that tasted pretty good.<br>
<br>
These days we don't have to go out and play 150 shows every time the 
band comes together. You can go out and play 20 shows, if you have 
something to do — or if you just feel like it. We're no longer bound by 
the previous rules of, "You've gotta have a record, then you've gotta go
 out and tour for two years.…" I don't think we have to do that anymore 
at this point. Though I'm sure we'll do it in the future.<br>
<br>
But you don't have to.<br>
<br>
You don't have to. You have a lot more freedom. You know, you can get 
the band together and play a few dates — with an idea behind it, and 
something that you think the fans might get a kick out of. We'll play 
the record start to finish, and then we'll play some of the special 
outtakes that are there, and we'll play some favorites, and it should be
 a nice night.<br>
<br>
Do you know yet, in terms of outtakes, what you might gravitate towards?
 I imagine Stevie will be pushing for "Restless Nights." Are there 
favorites of yours on the new box?<br>
<br>
I don't know — those will probably be the things that change from night 
to night, you know, the outtakes we pick to pull out. We'll see how that
 goes. I've got a few in my head, but I'm not sure yet 'til we start 
playing and see what's playing well.<br>
<br>
One big thing that's happened since last time we talked is the live 
downloads. It's good to see you'll be putting all of these upcoming 
shows out once again, night after night.<br>
<br>
Yeah, if somebody's at the show and they want a souvenir of it, then they'll be able to pick that up.<br>
<br>
What's been your relationship with the series? Do you listen to any of them along the way?<br>
<br>
Yeah, I do. I'll pick it up and listen to different sections at 
different times, to see how we're sounding and see how we're doing with 
it. But to keep it rolling, which is what we've tried to do... it's a 
more spontaneous kind of release. It's just nice to get the material out
 to the fans quickly, in much better quality than they would have gotten
 on the bootlegs.<br>
<br>
Well, from our perspective, it's been a bright new day. An amazing 
thing, a long time coming, and there's a lot of gratitude and 
appreciation from the fan end. And the shows from the archives, with the
 Nugs releases that are digging back to past tours, have you been happy 
with that program so far, too?<br>
<br>
Yeah, that's fun as well. Some of those classic shows, there's really no
 reason not to put them out. And some of them really stand head and 
shoulders above everything else. So we try to find out which ones the 
fans feel are really essential to them, and then see if we have good 
recordings of those. It's nice to get those out — it's just nice having a
 place where you can release so freely, where previously, for most of 
our career, we hadn't done that. So it's nice to be sort of servicing 
the fans in that way.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Tempe is an amazing document. When Thom Zimny came out to Monmouth 
[University] a few weeks ago and showed it on the big screen, it was 
just astounding, and I was wondering while I was watching... what went 
through your mind when you first saw it? You mentioned feeling lucky to 
uncover the footage, what do you see when you watch it something like 
this, 35 years later?<br>
<br>
I see a lot of skinny people! [Laughs] There's a lot of skinny little guys on stage!<br>
<br>
Kids!<br>
<br>
You know, at the time — you think 30, you think you're old. We thought 
we were old at 30. And then you look back, and of course that's funny. 
But the band was at some sort of peak at that moment. We had a lot of 
material that we were drawing on, Clarence was at the peak of his 
powers, and moving, and just incredible… I had a lot of fun watching it.
 It's just fun to watch your younger self. And it was a very good 
representation of the band we were at that moment.<br>
<br>
I was too young for that tour — I was nine years old at the time. <br>
<br>
That's why I really like getting out things like the Hammersmith show, 
and the stuff we got out on the Darkness box, and then this. It's nice 
to get those pieces of the band when it was just starting, so if you 
weren't around, if you weren't born, if you were too young, you can get 
an idea of what we were doing then.<br>
<br>
We were very against filming ourselves, and we didn't film ourselves 
very much. Looking back, that was a mistake. But I was young and a 
little superstitious, and I didn't want to break the magic by watching 
the trick too closely, you know? So we didn't film a lot. Looking back 
on that now, that's the one thing, if I could have done something 
different, I wish we'd have filmed much more of our work life. But we've
 been lucky that, somehow or another, mostly every tour, somebody got a 
camera out there and caught something. Now we film pretty regularly. But
 at that time... no.<br>
<br>
When I was talking with Zimny about Tempe, about some of the 
disappointment that it's not a full show, his response was, "Man, we 
were lucky to have as much as we have!"<br>
<br>
Oh, we were. And of course we searched for everything, to see what was 
there, but we just felt lucky that we had what we had. Because it was 
more than likely that we would have had nothing, given the approach we 
were taking at the time.<br>
<br>
Was it filmed for promotion? For commercials?<br>
<br>
I don't really remember — I don't remember what it was filmed for. It 
might have been... somebody might have asked and I just said "Okay." I 
don't remember it being filmed for promotion — but whatever it was 
filmed for, it wasn't used for! Like everything, like Hammersmith, it 
just went into the vault and just sat there. So I really don't know — 
maybe it was just filmed for posterity. But I didn't pay much attention 
to it at the time, because it was disturbing to me. If I saw people with
 cameras, or filming, it just made me too self-conscious when I was 
young, so I didn't want to have anything to do with it. <br>
<br>
I was always concerned with, you know, the show is about this moment, 
it's about you, it's about tonight. This moment belongs to the people 
that are in the room, and that was my first and foremost concern. And 
anything that got in the way of that, I was against at the time. So 
consequently, we didn't film very much [laughs].<br>
<br>
What changed in you, in terms of that attitude?<br>
<br>
Well, you get older and you realize that some of this stuff should have 
been documented. I wish we had film of us recording The River, or 
recording Born in the U.S.A. now — I really wish that that existed. 
Looking back at the Born to Run and the Darkness [studio] footage we 
have, I really feel like, wow, I wish we had loosened up and had a few 
nights where we let someone in. But we were too one-track mind on the 
record. That's just the way we did things — that's was how things got 
done. But as I got older, I said, no, I wasn't gonna make that mistake 
again, and once we got into the '90s we started to film things more. I'm
 always glad to have it now.<br>
<br>
So on this tour, you'll be playing the full River album, start to 
finish. I was lucky enough to be there at Madison Square Garden that 
first and only time, and that was just an incredible show.<br>
<br>
Yeah, it was a great night. My memories of it were great, so it made it 
like, "Oh, yeah, we could do that again!" Because I remember it as being
 a terrific night.  That seemed to play well. <br>
<br>
That album sequence really converts well to the live show — with all the peaks and valleys that you usually have.<br>
<br>
Yeah — I mean, The River album was set up to play like a live show. And 
so it does play well — it plays very well like that. That's why we took 
all the time we did with it: it was our idea of new material that played
 like a show. Because the fans, up to that point, were saying, "Gee, you
 know, this record's great, but..." there was always the show, the show,
 the show — you know, that we're not quite capturing the show on one 
record. Which we weren't always attempting to do. The records are very 
different. But with The River, we were taking a swing at trying to get 
some of that feeling and some of that ambiance onto the album. <br>
<br>
The single-album version, as much as I love it, wouldn't have had the same effect. Let's talk about that record a little bit.<br>
<br>
Yeah, that was something we made, and gave it to the record company, of 
course, and didn't release — we ended up taking it back. When I listened
 to it, I've often used the word, it wasn't big enough. It wasn't 
sprawling enough. It didn't include enough. I'd gotten to the point 
where I wanted to include everything that I did, from the party material
 to my character studies, and I didn't think I could do that 
successfully on one album at that time. I didn't take it back with the 
intention of making two.... I just took it back with the intention of 
making it better.<br>
<br>
Was the label pissed off when you took it back?<br>
<br>
I don't remember that, you know? I don't remember them being angry — we 
were pretty lucky, in that they really always followed where I was going
 creatively. I'm one of the few artists whose label has always, for the 
most part, been behind whatever direction I've taken. So I don't 
remember that being a big issue at the time. <br>
<br>
What made you want to include it in the box? I love that this hidden 
piece of history is now part of the catalog, and to me the differences 
are significant, but I was surprised by the decision — especially, I 
guess, given how much of it made it to either  Tracks or the double 
album.<br>
<br>
Listening back to it now, the thing that makes it quite special is the 
fact that the whole record was mixed by Bob Clearmountain, presaging 
Born in the U.S.A. It's a very different record. A record mixed by Bob… 
Bob is a transformer. It's a very different record than the double album
 that we made: if you compare, say, the two "Ties That Bind," their feel
 is very, very different. I like the single record now — I enjoy it, I 
listened to it when we put the box together, and I was, "Hey, that was a
 good record." It was fun to listen to. But it just didn't have the 
cinematic and sprawling scope of the record we ended up with. <br>
<br>
The record we ended up with was sort of our goodbye to our garage sound,
 in a way. That was where we figured out how to make and mix it 
ourselves, and we left all the rough edges on, and at the end of the 
day, that's one of the characteristics I like about The River. The next 
rock record, obviously, was Born in the U.S.A., and so once we hit that,
 there was a different standard for the quality of sound and the way we 
released things.<br>
<br>
How much of that sound and that sensibility do you credit Steve with?<br>
<br>
On The River, very much. Steve was very much… he promoted the garage-y 
sound inside of the thing, and The River was one where i really gave 
Steve his way quite a bit. He really influenced it. I was interested in 
going that way myself, but he was a real partner and a real influence on
 the sound of that record.<br>
<br>
What do you enjoy about doing a full album sequence? It's been a regular
 thing that you've gone back to since that night at the Count Basie 
[Theatre] in 2008.<br>
<br>
I like it a lot because, first of all, in most of these cases we spent 
years putting that sequence together. Just sequencing. They are full 
bodies of work, and they were meant to be listened to from start to 
finish. I still make my records like that, you know? <br>
<br>
It's very strange, I've always thought, that the first thing that people
 do, when they come out on tour, is they break the album completely up. 
They play a few songs here, a few songs there… it's actually very 
unusual, considering all the time and the care you take in the 
sequencing and in the content of the record. <br>
<br>
So when you get to play these album shows, you get some of that back. 
You get the cumulative experience of a very particular place and time, a
 very particular group of songs. And that has its own identity. And I 
believe that the accumulation of those 20 songs together is greater than
 the individual playing of each particular song on any given night. <br>
You get a sense of a time, you get a sense of where your head was, the 
issues you were thinking about, who you were at that moment… it really 
marks a certain moment in your work life. So I like to play the records 
in their entirety. When you're done, you feel like you've had the full 
experience of the album.<br>
<br>
Yeah, that's the feeling I had at the Garden that night. And even 
certain songs that you might laugh off when it comes to playing them 
individually, as you say… like "Crush on You" — when that comes, at just
 the right time, it's a blast.<br>
<br>
[Laughs] Well, we'll be playing it!<br>
<br>
Are there any shows by other artists that stand out to you, where you've
 gotten to see someone perform a full album? Did you catch the 
Quadrophenia tour or anything like that?<br>
<br>
No, I didn't catch that. As a matter of fact, I'm not sure I've ever 
seen somebody do it. I did see the video of Van [Morrison] doing Astral 
Weeks, and of course that's one of my all-time favorite records, so I 
loved that a lot. I know a lot of other people are doing it, but I 
haven't seen… I know Steely Dan did a stand, I think it was at the 
Beacon, where each night they played a different record — I would have 
loved to have seen that. I know John Fogerty's done a few of his. I 
haven't had a chance to go out and catch them. But it's fun — it's fun 
to hear, and I think it's fun for the musicians to do.<br>
<br>
Are there any challenges that go along with it? I'm thinking in terms of
 having a set sequence locked in, which doesn't happen for you too 
often. There was the Tunnel tour, and the start of the Rising tour, but 
in general...<br>
<br>
Well, I think it's going to be a relief to a certain extent! [Laughs] I 
mean, usually up there, I'm a third or two-thirds through the song, and 
my mind is already going, okay, what am I gonna play next? I enjoy doing
 that — and my band does that better than anybody out there — but it'll 
be fun playing music like it's a little opera or a little play. It'll be
 enjoyable to do that. I'm looking forward to it.<br>

The River Tour begins January 16, 2016, in Pittsburgh, PA. See our

 BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN AND THE E STREET BAND - ALLPHONES ARENA (19.02.14)<br>
February 20, 2014 -<br>
<br>
BY— Larry Heath</strong><br>
<br>
Something special must be in the water here in Australia, because Bruce 
Springsteen sure has been treating us well on his current High Hopes 
tour with the E Street Band; their second time to our shores in the last
 12 months, which is a rarity in its own right.<br>
Following two nights in Melbourne, where the set-lists topped 30 songs 
and included 1984's Born in the U.S.A. and 1975's Born to Run in their 
entirety, on Sunday and Sunday respectively, tonight was Sydney's turn. 
Here, he treated us to - among 18 other classics and covers - 1978's 
Darkness on the Edge of Town from start to finish.<br>
It's hard to say why this has become a trend on this tour - maybe he 
just feels like it, maybe he's recording it for a special release... who
 knows. But whatever the reason, we are indeed being spoilt, and weren't
 not complaining. Including classic tracks like "Badlands", the 
immaculate "Racing in the Street" and "Prove it all Night", Darkness is 
one of Springsteen's most well regarded early works, especially on 
retrospect when one considers the pressure placed on The Boss in the 
follow-up to the success that was Born to Run, and the unintended gap 
that followed.<br>
Tonight the album was given a beautiful start-to-finish treatment by 
Bruce and the band, who removed the theatrics that help signify the rest
 of the show - as well as parts of the E Street Band for the songs which
 required less "bang" - allowing the album to be enjoyed on its own 
merits.<br>
"The Promised Land", the album's B-side opener, was a highlight, with a 
rare harmonica appearance for Springsteen. The instrumental ending for 
"Racing in the Street" was something to behold, and "Prove It All Night"
 was a stunner, with a guitar solo from Nils Lofgren bringing the crowd 
to their feet as he twirled and twirled and twirled.<br>
The band took a much deserved bow at the end of the album's ten tracks, 
before returning to the classics and the theatrics. Theatrics that 
included plenty of singalongs, beer chugging, giving people in the back 
seats a good taste of The Boss, kids joining Bruce on stage during 
"Waitin' on a Sunny Day" (so cute!), and girls dancing, singing and 
strumming on guitars during "Dancing in the Dark". Though it was likely 
that the obligatory "Born to Run" got the biggest singalong of the 
night... at least of his own material. With covers like "Shout" thrown 
in the mix, alongside a few others I'll mention shortly, Bruce certainly
 has a repertoire that gets all the kids singing.<br>
The rest of the set was a mixed-bag of new and old - which gets a bit 
confusing thanks to his new record High Hopes - a reworking of some old 
songs and covers that have become popular on the live circuit. "High 
Hopes", The Saint's "Just Like Fire Would", "The Ghost of Tom Joad" and 
Suicide's "Dream Baby Dream" all made appearances from the new record.<br>
Then there's his oft-played routine of picking out signs from the crowd 
and honouring their requests. Tonight this saw "Cadillac Ranch" come 
early, and rarity "Surprise, Surprise" kicking off the second encore, 
solo and acoustic, for one very lucky 23 year old's birthday. Testament 
to the fact The Boss is only human, he took a quick minute to make sure 
he remembered the latter... and testament to the fact the whole band is 
only human, we saw a brief stuff up during "Born To Run" which ended up 
seeing the track played faster than usual, Spingsteen remarking 
"...that's the fastest we've ever played that mother fucker!"<br>
Other surprises for the night included two very Australian covers that, 
as far as I know, Springsteen has never performed live before. The night
 opened with "Friday on my Mind" by The Easybeats - which got the crowd 
moving early - and the first encore saw an amazing rendition of "Don't 
Change" by INXS make an appearance. It all begs the question: how on 
earth does the band have time to rehearse and prepare for such an ever 
changing set!? But that's what makes them such consummate professionals,
 after all... so I digress...<br>
And then there's Tom Morello. The most unlikely E Street Band member has
 quickly become a crowd favourite, from his screeching guitar solo 
during "The Ghost of Tom Joad", or his ability to use his teeth as a 
pick during "High Hopes"... the man's signature moves and sound have 
somehow made a home amongst the band. And given there are up to five 
guitars going up there at once, that's a rather difficult task! But with
 a band like this, you get the feeling that "anything's possible" is a 
bit of an understatement.<br>
The night ended with a cover of Suicide's "Dream Baby Dream", which also
 closes out the High Hopes record. Springsteen dedicated the track, 
which was a first for the tour, to his chosen charity of the night - the
 NSW Foodbank. Springsteen performed the beautiful song on what I 
believe was a Hammond organ, as he looped the notes that got louder and 
louder until he stepped away from the keys and let the music grow as his
 belted out the beautiful lyrics of a song that felt like an extra layer
 of icing on an already decadent desert.<br>
Remarking simply that "The E Street Band Loves You", Springsteen walked 
off stage to a crowd who he had in the palm of his hands from start to 
finish. And he would have had them no matter what he did, but I don't 
think anyone would argue that he didn't earn it. This man - who, let us 
not forget is in his mid-60s - worked hard for that love. Running from 
the front of the stadium to the back, and then crowdsurfing his way to 
the stage, his energy is mystifying.<br>
But it's what makes Bruce Springsteen one of the finest performers alive
 today, and he continues to bring it night after night. Who knows what 
he'll do when he plays in the Hunter Valley this weekend. But we know 
that everyone in attendance will be in for a treat - and let the final 
word from me, as it was for Bruce, be about the E Street Band: THE most 
phenomenal backing band anyone has ever had the privilege of performing 
with. The band are a wonder to behold in their own right. Bruce might be
 the showman, but really, the E Street Band ARE the show. And as is now 
tradition, thanks to "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out", even The Big Man himself
 will never miss out on being a part of it.<br>

Bruce Springsteen delivers sermon to Boondall crowd in Brisbane<br>
Date<br>
February 27, 2014<br>
<br>
 Tony Moore<br>
</strong><br>
Ladies and gentleman, the Very Reverend Bruce Springsteen and E Street 
Band delivered the champagne in a sparkling, four-hour sermon of 
top-flight, gospel-charged soul in their last Australian concert for 
2014 at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre on Wednesday.<br>
<br>
It finished at 11.55pm after Springsteen delivered a touching, clear version of Thunder Road alone with his acoustic guitar.<br>
<br>
"Australia, the E-Street Band loves you," the still fit, gritty-voiced singer said.<br>
<br>
<br>
"But we'll be back," he said, walking slowly off stage after delivering a
 staggering 30-song set which took the audience from the Bee Gees’ 
Redcliffe, through the heart of New York circa 1974, back to modern 
times and then out through AC/DC's Highway to Hell.<br>
<br>
It started at 8.05pm with Bruce thanking his Australian fans before 
teasing his way into the set, with the cover song that he identified 
most with each capital city.<br>
<br>
It was the Bee Gees’ turn in the city last night.<br>
<br>
Their disco hit Stayin' Alive became a Motown monster groove that had the E Street Band horn section taking solos straight up.<br>
<br>
They then punched through three songs from their 1973 debut album, 
Greetings from Asbury Park: It's Hard to be a Saint in the City, Does 
this Bus Stop at 82nd Street and Growin' Up.<br>
<br>
Here Springsteen reminisced about his super-heroes; The Flash, the Human Torch and Batman.<br>
<br>
Springsteen remains legendarily close to his fans, again on Wednesday 
night letting them dance with him, play his acoustic guitar, sing with 
him, crowd-surf him back to the stage, hug him and kiss him.<br>
<br>
At one stage - after again being crowd-surfed back to the stage, he 
tells the crowd he has found someone's cell phone in his back pocket.<br>
<br>
"That's a first, I didn't feel a thing!"<br>
<br>
He fumbles to get it to work.<br>
<br>
He in turn confides in them, his light-hearted weaknesses to new technology.<br>
<br>
"I'm a late converter, I'm still working out my iPhone," he says drawing laughs.<br>
<br>
The band kicked into Spirit in the Night, again from Asbury Park, after 
Springsteen mock-pleaded with the crowd like a malicious preacher.<br>
<br>
"How do you stay alive?" he pleaded, "Can you feel the spirit?"<br>
<br>
"Can you feel it right now?"<br>
<br>
Wham. Ladies and gentleman Reverend Bruce was back in the house!<br>
<br>
Down went the overdrive pedal.<br>
<br>
High Hopes, the title track from his latest album, was followed by his 
second nod to Brisbane, the soul-charged version of The Saints’ Just 
Like Fire Would, where the E-Street Band locked into the song's horn 
line like they owned it.<br>
<br>
Then Springsteen picked songs to play from the signs held by the 
audience, holding up the sign to the E-Street Band and counting in the 
songs.<br>
<br>
That's when you know the band is good.<br>
<br>
One, two, three bam!<br>
<br>
We got scorching versions of You Can Look, (But You Better Not Touch) 
and Sherry Darling from The River, before the quieter Save My Love, 
originally recorded for Darkness on the Edge of Town album, but released
 years later.<br>
<br>
"It's pretty obscure. It was just too happy to get on that album," he laughed.<br>
<br>
Then they play guitarist Stevie Van Zandt's favourite song, Fade Away, a
 mid-tempo pessimistic tune recorded for The River, which Springsteen 
jokes he had to play for Little Stevie once every tour.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and Van Zandt have a ball together on stage, singing, 
joking, pulling faces, a change from last year's Australian tour when 
Van Zandt was filming his television show, Lilyhammer, in Norway.<br>
<br>
But by this time the crowd had taken over and Bruce is asking for requests.<br>
<br>
The outcome, the seven songs from their second album, The Wild, the 
Innocent and the E-Street Shuffle, that was released in 1973 and shook 
world music with its funky soulful jazz and street blues sound.<br>
<br>
From the opener, E-Street Shuffle, to the gorgeous closing track, New 
York City Serenade, each E-Street Band member absolutely shone, with 
Springsteen excelling on guitar parts that helped shape his career, and 
Roy Bittan influential in absolutely everything on keyboards.<br>
<br>
Jake Clemons, played the sax parts his uncle, Clarence Clemons, famously
 played in 1973, following The Boss through the audience.<br>
<br>
This is the sound that Springsteen and the early E-Street Band eventually took to the world.<br>
<br>
On Wednesday night the E-Street band took Brisbane a step back to New Jersey 1973-74 to see where it all started.<br>
<br>
While for most, it was a splendour to see, Springsteen seemed to 
understand some in the crowd may have been left behind, becoming fans 
after this album.<br>
<br>
Out came the crowd favourites; Darlington County, Waiting on a Sunny Day
 - where one young boy sang solo on stage, a stirring emphatic version 
of The Rising, before The Ghost of Tom Joad and Badlands.<br>
<br>
Last year, guest guitarist Tom Morello, from Rage Against the Machine, 
was a sensation in Tom Joad, sharing the vocals with Bruce and playing a
 solo that started in conventional blues, went to contemporary sound 
effects and back again.<br>
<br>
Again, his popping, wailing, solo had people turning their heads on 
Wednesday night producing big grins from guitarists Nils Lofgren, Stevie
 Van Zandt and Springsteen himself.<br>
<br>
Badlands just swaggered with rude intent, Glory Days sounded like the 
radio gem it is, and Born to Run remains the perfectly constructed rock 
song, with the sax solo and the descending run in the middle simply 
anthemic.<br>
<br>
There the show went to Bobby Jean (from Born in the USA), then Dancing 
in the Dark - when it seemed a dozen people from the crowd were invited 
up to dance, play guitar and sing - before the sexy Tenth Avenue Freeze 
Out.<br>
<br>
Here Bruce went through the crowd one last time, while the big screens 
played a tribute to the late E-Street Band sax man Clarence Clemons 
overhead.<br>
<br>
And then there was Eddie Vedder.<br>
<br>
The E-Street Band absolutely crunched AC/DC's Highway to Hell, with the 
Pearl Jam frontman just loving his time punching out the vocals, while 
each of the four guitarists; Lofgren, Morello, Van Zandt and Bruce had 
their shake at Angus Young's famous guitar break.<br>
<br>
It was stage magic, but suddenly that magic was over.<br>
<br>
And just before the stroke of midnight, Bruce returned alone to thank 
Australian audiences, to talk a little about our surfing beaches.<br>
<br>
And to drive down our Thunder Road.<br>
<br>
"Don't tell anybody about this shit you've got down here OK? People will start coming.<br>
<br>
"Good night."<br>
<br>
I can't tell you how it compared to Bruce's concerts of the 1980s, but if you thought 2013 was great, 2014 went the step beyond.</div>

<br>
Bruce Springsteen</strong><br>
<strong class="text-strong">The Ties That Bind: The River Collection (Columbia)<br>
REVIEWED BY LIBBY WEBSTER, FRI.,<br>
 DEC. 18, 2015</strong><br>
<br>
A double album of hellos and goodbyes, 1980's The River juxtaposes cocky
 romance with grim meditations on death. Bruce Springsteen's fifth 
release proved a cardinal development in his storytelling, and The Ties 
That Bind: The River Collection dissects it across four CDs, a 2-DVD 
concert from the same year in Arizona, and an hourlong documentary on a 
third DVD, plus over 200 coffee-table-ready photos. The rollicking, 
160-minute set from Tempe preserves the unbelievable youthfulness of the
 bandleader and his henchmen Clarence Clemons, Steven Van Zandt, and the
 rest of the E Street Band. Unabashed boyishness, tireless fervor, and 
exuberance brand it the box's uncontested centerpiece. Past the 
double-disc LP remaster, CD three unearths the initial 10-track version 
of The River. Without "Point Blank," "Out in the Street," and "Wreck on 
the Highway," its drama quotient plummets. A collection of outtakes on a
 final CD adds a new blush to the sessions, however. Gritty rocker 
"Chain Lightning," whose opening got repurposed on Nebraska; "Stray 
Bullet," a piano ballad driving the characters from the title song to 
darker depths; and the chaotic desperation of "Roulette" flesh out The 
River's (im)mortal flow.<br>
