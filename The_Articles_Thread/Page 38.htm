 <br>
The Boss gives faithful fans one to remember at Rogers Arena<br>
 <br>
BY FRANCOIS MARCHAND, VANCOUVER SUN NOVEMBER 29, 2012<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
VANCOUVER - For the second night in a row Monday night, a legend stole Vancouver's heart.<br>
Sunday it was a love-in at BC Place with Paul McCartney, and Monday 
evening it was a different kind of powerhouse rock performance courtesy 
of Bruce Springsteen, who took about two minutes at the beginning of yet
 another marathon gig to show us why he will always be The Boss.<br>
(The "Boss" nickname, by the way, comes from the early days of the E 
Street Band, when Springsteen would eat his band mates alive playing a 
unique brand of no-holds-barred Monopoly that barely followed the 
rules.)<br>
There are usually no guidelines when it comes to Springsteen gigs, a 
refreshing approach in a world of ultra-polished and insanely 
choreographed arena rock concerts.<br>
Guessing the set list for a Springsteen gig ahead of time is as 
torturous a task as trying to take Boardwalk away from The Boss back in 
the '70s. Only one thing was for certain: It was going to be epic, and 
was it ever.<br>
You have to consider that, at 63 and touring his 17th studio album 
Wrecking Ball, Springsteen has been breaking records: On July 31st in 
Helsinki, Finland, The Boss played for four hours and six minutes (not 
counting an acoustic set he had played earlier that day), making it the 
longest concert he had ever performed and beating the famed New Year's 
Eve gig at Nassau Coliseum in 1980 by a whole five minutes.<br>
Springsteen didn't shatter any records in Vancouver, but he did offer a 
colossal performance that clocked in at over three hours and included 
over 25 songs.<br>
There were seldom heard nuggets, there were requests taken from fans in 
the audience, there were those famous Springsteen sermon-like moments, 
there were the favourites that made the crowd go berserk. Well, it was a
 Boss show alright.<br>
"Bruuuuuuce!" the near-sold out crowd, which filled the seats all around the arena, chanted just a few minutes after 8 p.m.<br>
Backed by his E Street pals and a host of extra horn players and backup 
singers (17 musicians and singers in total, if the count is right), 
Springsteen sauntered onto the stage to kick off the proceedings with a 
stomping, gospel-inflected Shackled and Drawn, with vocalist Cindy 
Mizelle coaxing a crowd already on its feet to get up and be recognized.<br>
Springsteen's workman style, which is often embodied in more 
activist-like material like We Take Care Of Our Own, co-mingled with 
grin-inducing, heartwarming cuts like Out In The Street and Hungry 
Heart, the latter a big happy singalong where Springsteen went waltzing 
through the crowd, making his way back crowd surfing atop a sea of 
outstretched arms.<br>
That was three songs in.<br>
The material from Wrecking Ball really came to life in a live setting, 
the album's title track and the Irish-tinged Death To My Hometown imbued
 with a new spirit in the wake of Hurricane Sandy's devastation of the 
Jersey Shore.<br>
Few speak of the common man's hopes and dreams as well as Springsteen. 
The crowd, 18,000-strong and with many waving signs requesting their 
favourite tracks, was buzzing with a religious-like fervor.<br>
"What a great crowd tonight," Springsteen said, recognizing fans dressed as Santa and elves in the front row.<br>
"I'm an old man but I don't want to go home," he added. "We've got miles to go here. I like my job."<br>

Because Springsteen knows his is probably one of the best jobs in the world, that to inspire is the greatest responsibility.<br>
"This is from our ghosts to your ghosts," he said before My City Of 
Ruins, which served to introduce his band, with some of the loudest 
cheers reserved for drummer Max Weinberg, guitarist Stevie Van Zandt and
 for Clarence Clemons' nephew Jake on the saxophone.<br>
You could say it takes at least four or five horn players to fill the 
late Clarence's shoes and you wouldn't be too far off the mark. Yet 
seeing Jake finding a spot at Springsteen's side was a heart-warming 
sight.<br>
On Spirit In The Night, from 1973's Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J., Jake was channeling his dear old uncle's ghost with pride.<br>
Of course, the classic cuts made for the biggest cheers, especially when
 plucked from the audience: Springsteen digging out Red Headed Woman 
after a fan made a sign complete with articulated joints and red 
feathers for hair was an unexpected (and mildly dirty) blast, the band 
not even skipping a beat to segue into Streets Of Fire.<br>
Springsteen revisiting the Patti Smith Group's Because The Night, which 
he co-wrote with Smith in 1978, gave guitarist Nils Lofgren a chance to 
go crazy during the guitar solo and spin round and round.<br>
Indeed the night truly belonged to Springsteen and his fans, a young 
girl invited to sing on Waitin' On A Sunny Day and doing quite a 
spectacular job, some later throwing panties at The Boss, which lead him
 to exclaim: "I feel like Tom Jones!"<br>
The rest of the concert was a series of victorious anthems: The Rising, 
Badlands, Land Of Hope And Dreams, which closed the show with hands held
 high.<br>
The encore - a collection that included rollicking renditions of Born To
 Run, and Dancing In The Dark played with the house lights on where 
Springsteen invited an elderly woman to dance, and even Santa Claus Is 
Coming To Town - was essentially dedicated to the Greater Vancouver Food
 Bank Society, an organization Springsteen invited to collect donations 
in the hallways before and after the show.<br>
Top it off with a larger-than-life salute to Clarence during Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out and the evening was complete.<br>
Yes, The Boss ruled.</div>

				<div class="content">Classic Tracks: Bruce Springsteen's "The River"<br>
<br>
Oct 1, 2003 -By Maureen Droney<br>
<br>
Listening to Bruce Springsteen's song “The River” always makes me cry. I
 used to think it was just me. Raised East Coast and blue collar, I 
always saw in Springsteen's ballad of failed dreams my family and the 
people I grew up with. Writing this story, I discovered that I wasn't 
alone. As it turns out, tears are a pretty universal response to “The 
River”; you don't have to be East Coast or blue collar to understand 
that our lives often don't turn out as we'd hoped.<br>
<br>
Introduced on September 22, 1979, at the No Nukes concert at Madison 
Square Garden, “The River” was never a single. But, a year later, it 
became the title track of a double album, Springsteen's fifth. Set 
chronologically between the brooding, working-class vignettes of 
Darkness on the Edge of Town and the starkly hopeless Nebraska, The 
River contains such patented Springsteen party songs as “Hungry Heart” 
and “Sherry Darling.” But running through it is an underlying theme of 
disillusionment that's encapsulated perfectly in the song “The River.” A
 mid-tempo ballad, it tells the story of a pair of working-class teens 
forced by pregnancy into an early marriage and dead-end jobs. It also 
showcases the E Street Band at their best. Somehow solid and airy at the
 same time, the ensemble is masterful in its support of Springsteen's 
lyrics and folk-style melody, juxtaposing musically plaintive verses 
against falsely hopeful choruses.<br>
<br>
Recorded in New York City at the Power Station (now Avatar Studios) 
during a 16-month period, The River sessions were Grammy®-winning 
producer/engineer Neil Dorfsman's first real engineering gig. He recalls
 it vividly: “I was a huge fan of Bruce's from early on,” he remembers. 
“When I heard they were coming in, I went to the studio manager and, 
basically, begged to be on the date. Bob Clearmountain started the 
project, did a track or two, then had to leave for a prior commitment, 
and they gave me a shot. I was so nervous the night he walked in, I was 
shaking. I was sure the first night would be my last. Little did I know 
it would go on for something like 16 months.”<br>
<br>
In 1980, Power Station's Studio A was becoming legendary as the place to
 get a big, live sound. However, at that time, studio lockouts weren't 
the norm; the sessions that became The River were cut entirely on the 
night shift. Dorfsman and his assistants tore down each morning and set 
up again each evening — six or seven nights a week. “It was recorded 
live, so it was the same setup every night,” he says. “My assistants 
re-set up the room, and I got to the point where I could walk in the 
control room, set up the entire console, my patches, four different 
headphone mixes, all my levels and be ready to roll in 20 minutes.<br>
<br>
“It was fun. But tearing down the studios every night was brutal. I'd 
get to the studio at 5 p.m. and wait for the previous session to end, 
usually at 6:30. Then we'd go in and hit it. In an hour we'd be done and
 the band could walk in and start playing. In fact, they'd often start 
playing as things were still being plugged in. If it sounded okay, we'd 
get it on tape and go. That was Bruce's sound: immediate and alive.”<br>
<br>
<br>
The setup was a big one, with Bruce and all six members of the E Street 
Band. Max Weinberg's drums were in the main room, where a vocal booth 
was also constructed for Springsteen out of goboes, plywood and 
blankets. Organist Danny Federici with his B3 and baffled-off Leslie, 
and pianist Roy Bittan were set up in their own iso room, along with 
miscellaneous keyboards. A second, deader iso room housed the amps: 
Springsteen's Fender Bassman, guitarist “Miami” Steve Van Zandt's amps 
and Garry Tallent's baffled bass amp. Saxophonist Clarence “Big Man” 
Clemons had his own booth on the side of the control room.<br>
<br>
Studio A's control room housed a 32-channel Neve 8068 console that was, 
according to Dorfsman, “totally maxed out.” He recalls using either a 
Neumann 87 or a U67 on Springsteen's vocal, with either a Teletronix 
LA-2A or a UREI LA-3A limiter and Pultec EQ. “The Power Station didn't 
have a lot of vintage mics,” he says, “and we kept the setup simple in 
case he wanted to come back later and change something, which, actually,
 he never did.”<br>
<br>
The rest of the mics were simple also: two Shure SM 57s for each guitar 
amp, “one straight and one at an angle on the center of the cones and a 
Neumann U87 and a couple of Sennheiser 451s” on acoustic guitar. The 
B3's Leslie was recorded in stereo: two 57s on top, spread left and 
right, and a Neumann 47 FET on the bottom, mixed up the middle with the 
stereo tracks “probably compressed with two Neve compressors linked to 
keep it sort of burbling instead of pokey.” Bass was taken both direct 
and with either a Sennheiser 421 or a Neumann 47 FET on the amp. Both DI
 and mic bass channels were run through the console's pair of 33609 
limiters with no EQ.<br>
<br>
The piano, miked with two Sennheiser 451s or 452s, wasn't compressed, 
but it was generally “severely” EQ'd through Pultecs for a very bright 
sound. “Power Station had 24 Pultecs in the control room,” explains 
Dorfsman. “That was a lot of the sound of that record. Everything pretty
 much ran through them whether they had EQ or not. There was a patch 
between the console and the tape machine, and Ed Evans, the chief tech, 
had done a mod so you could go through the tubes of the Pultecs without 
going through the EQ stage.”<br>
<br>
The drum mics were classic Power Station: an SM57 on snare, a Sennheiser
 421 and an RE20 on the kick drum, which was housed in a tunnel made out
 of a packing blanket. On the toms — top and bottom — 421s. For hi-hat, a
 Sennheiser 451 with a 20dB pad; for the overheads, 451s with 10dB pads.
 Room mics were two U87s, “up pretty high, sometimes facing away from 
the drums toward the wall for more reflection and longer delay, or, 
depending on the tune, sometimes low to the ground and facing the drums,
 about 20 feet away. It was fairly well squashed with a pair of LA-3As —
 nothing crazy — just to give them some punch. There was a moderate 
amount of console EQ used, but no real outboard EQ. The sound was the 
room, the board and the band. The hallmark sound for recording this 
record was the ambience and the brightness. When you were monitoring in 
the control room, you could almost never have too much ambience; Max 
loved it.”<br>
<br>
Dorfsman recalls cutting several versions of “The River,” trying out 
different tempos and a more embellished rock 'n' roll arrangement. “I 
don't, in general, remember the specifics of each song,” he admits. “We 
were doing multiple takes of every song 20, 30, sometimes 40 times, so 
things really blended together. Bruce cut something like 50 songs, with 
multiple — at least 15 — takes of each tune. We had over 400 reels of 
tape. But I do remember, when we first heard “The River,” I looked at my
 assistant and went, ‘Wow, this is great.’ It had a special vibe and 
everybody — at least everybody at my end, in the control room — knew it 
was a special tune when we cut it.”<br>
<br>
The album's final mixes (except “Hungry Heart,” which was mixed by Bob 
Clearmountain at Power Station) were done by Toby Scott. Although Scott 
has worked in various capacities with Springsteen for over 20 years now,
 “The River” was also his first Springsteen project. In 1980, he was 
manager and chief engineer of producer Chuck Plotkin's Clover Recording 
in Hollywood.<br>
<br>
“Chuck helped out on the mixes for Darkness at the Edge of Town,” Scott 
explains, “and they [Springsteen and manager Jon Landau] called him in 
again when they had trouble getting the mixes for The River. They'd had 
Bob Clearmountain mix about a dozen songs on two different occasions, 
and they'd done mixes with Neil Dorfsman. When they ended up calling 
Chuck, he got me into the picture because we worked together. He said 
something like, ‘Toby's my right-hand man. Let him mix it, and I'll just
 refine his mixes.’<br>
<br>
“So they gave me a song. I worked on it for two or three hours, then 
Bruce listened and said, ‘No, that's not it. Where are the room mics? I 
want it to sound more like this!’ He shoved the room mics way up on the 
faders so the drums sounded like they were in a basketball court! 
Obviously, that was going to be integral to the sound of the band. They 
left, I rebalanced, and when they came back in, they said, ‘Sounds good,
 let's try another song.’ I mixed a few more, things were going well, 
and then they said, ‘Okay, now let's really mix the songs.’ Because 
Bruce, at that time, was into very meticulous control of everything. He 
took as long as was necessary.”<br>
<br>
A lot of what Scott spent time on was getting the room sounds and 
reverbs right. “I had to figure out a way to control the room mics,” he 
explains. “They had a lot of cymbals in them so that when you turned 
them up loud, they washed out the drums. It ended up that I used a 
couple of Eventide 910 Harmonizers to create a multitapped delay, which I
 popped the drums into, and then sent out into our studio through 
[Altec] 604E speakers, recorded into a couple of 87s. Our studio wasn't 
very live, so I nailed plywood boards on the walls.”<br>
<br>
Wanting the mixes to be “great,” as Scott says, he and Plotkin 
auditioned a prototype Sony 1610 digital recorder and settled on it as 
their mix format. Working on Clover's 32-channel, 8-bus API console, and
 taking approximately two days to get what Scott calls the “sound 
picture” for each song, they laid down mixes and variations of mixes. 
“There wasn't any automation,” Scott points out, “so the mixes were 
really a performance. We did hundreds of variations: with backgrounds 
and without; lead up, lead down; more echo; more slap. Once we started 
taking mixes, I think we averaged 75 variations per song.”<br>
<br>
For “The River,” room sounds were integral, but the added reverbs were 
also striking, especially noticeable on the first entrance of harmonica 
and vocal. As Scott recalls, they comprised an EMT 250 digital reverb 
and Clover's two EMT 140 plates, which he had damped and made less 
“metallic-sounding” by gaffer-taping the sides. Those plates also had a 
unique trait: Set in a separate room against a cinder-block wall, they 
would heat up during the day and give off a softer, more mellow sound. 
At night, the plates were tighter and brighter. “You'd bear this in 
mind,” Scott says. “Most of Bruce's mixes were laid down in the middle 
of the night.”<br>
<br>
For Roy Bittan's piano, which leads much of the track, Scott used two 
Eventide 910s, “one spread so that the harmonized, delayed side was on 
the left, and the undelayed sound was on the right, and the other set at
 the reverse, so that the delays and harmonizing weren't the same.”<br>
<br>
Scott's favorite vocal limiter on the sessions was an EMT 156, which, 
even at that time, was a rarity. “Virtually no engineers knew how to 
work it,” he admits. “It was unity gain in and out, so it was all based 
on gain structure. When we first started, Bruce said, ‘I don't like my 
vocal compressed; don't do it,’ but I stuck it through the EMT and it 
worked incredibly well. He never noticed it. If the level you were 
sending in was right, and you followed the chart on the front panel, it 
carefully compressed to where it was seamless.”<br>
<br>
Scott's format for mixing was — and still is — to get the rhythm section
 going first, then to put up the vocal and begin working the chordal 
instruments around it. When he opened up Springsteen's vocal on “The 
River,” he was surprised at his reaction. “I listened to the track a 
couple of times,” he says, “then I put up the lyrics, and it really got 
to me, the story of this kid who got a girl pregnant and trapped them 
both into a miserable life. I was sitting there, actually sobbing away 
at the console. And I was thinking, ‘Geez, how am I going to do this?’ 
Finally, it was, ‘I've got to get on with the job at hand,’ and I went 
on and mixed it. But even then, a couple of days later when I would 
listen back, I'd be sobbing again…it really was the most emotional 
song.”<br>
<br>
I was lucky enough to catch Springsteen live twice before he turned 
superstar. It's not that his performances changed; he's still an 
incredible communicator, one of the few who can hold riveted a packed 
stadium. It's just that those huge stadiums sometimes seem to be filled 
with Top 40 fans and clueless yuppies shouting out “Dancing in the 
Dark”! But, on the night in 1980 when I saw him perform “The River,” the
 crowd was still full of believers, and the shows were still 
gut-wrenching, emotional and intimate. As Springsteen and “Miami” Steve 
sang the last wordless notes to “The River,” as it slowly faded out and 
the stage went black, there was only hushed silence, the crowd too 
stunned to react. Driven to tears, if you ask me.</div>

December 3, 2010<br>
Bernard Zuel<br>
Sydney Morning Herald</strong><br>
<br>
Every album comes with a parallel universe in which the choice of 
different songs/sounds/emotions could have created another reality, 
another equally valid "definitive statement".<br>
It's one reason why many of us love box sets, with their 
unreleased/alternate songs. It's also why this massive collection is 
nigh on essential. It includes three CDs (the remastered album and two 
discs of unreleased material) and three DVDs (a fascinating documentary,
 a somewhat flat 2009 performance of the album alongside more enjoyable 
rehearsal/recording footage from 1976-'78 and a typically exhilarating 
'78 concert) packaged in a reproduction of one of Springsteen's famous 
spiral notebooks (containing notes, plans, lyrics and lists).<br>
It's important to understand the context of Darkness on the Edge of 
Town. In 1975, Springsteen compressed his style into translatable pop 
songs on Born to Run, scoring huge success by making euphoric-sounding 
tales of narrow horizons seem universal. He became a legitimate star.<br>
Almost immediately he became embroiled in legal action with his first 
manager, which prevented him from even entering a recording studio. 
During more than two years of litigation, Springsteen could do little 
more than write (some 60 songs), rehearse and simultaneously begin 
figuring out exactly what kind of artist he wanted to be.<br>

The answer, as the vividly captured characters in the sober-minded but 
passionately felt Darkness on the Edge of Town show, was someone more 
connected to the small towns he grew up in, more in tune with the lives 
of those he saw, more reflective of the less-than-euphoric mood of the 
country amid what president Jimmy Carter called its "malaise".<br>
Many of the unreleased songs were set aside not because they weren't 
good but because they couldn't fit in with this concept. If they had 
come out in '76 or early '77, immediately in the wake of Born to Run, 
songs such as the girl group romance of Gotta Get That Feeling and its 
sibling Ain't Good Enough For You, the Orbison homages of Outside 
Looking in and Wrong Side of the Street and the punchy pop of Talk to Me
 would have made a fine album you'd still be hearing on radio now. But 
by 1978 they weren't where Springsteen's head was at. Likewise Fire 
(later done by the Pointer Sisters) and Because the Night (added to and 
recorded by Patti Smith) felt too much like personal pop songs rather 
than stories of "real" lives.<br>
The notable exception among the unreleased songs is The Promise, which 
in its tale of frustrated dreams and burning, if contained, anger done 
in an almost hymnal setting would have (and maybe should have) slid on 
to Darkness perfectly, except that Springsteen felt it too 
self-referential.<br>
Darkness is a great album on its own, an essential point in one of the 
great careers. This box doesn't change or add to that album but it does 
expand the world around it in ways that any fan would revel in.</div>
