<strong class="text-strong">BORN TO RUN</strong><br>
-<strong class="text-strong"> Greil Marcus, Rolling Stone, 10/9/75.</strong><br>
<br>
Born To Run is a magnificent album that pays off on every bet ever 
placed on Bruce Springsteen -- a '57 Chevy running on melted down 
Crystals records that shuts down every claim that has been made. And it 
should crack his future wide open.<br>
<br>
The song titles by themselves -- "Thunder Road," "Night," "Backstreets,"
 "Born to Run," "Jungleland" -- suggest the extraordinary dramatic 
authority that is at the heart of Springsteen's new music. It is the 
drama that counts; the stories Springsteen is telling are nothing new, 
though no one has ever told them better or made them matter more. Their 
familiar romance is half their power: The promise and the threat of the 
night; the lure of the road; the quest for a chance worth taking and the
 lust to pay its price; girls glimpsed once at 80 miles and hour and 
never forgotten; the city streets as the last, permanent American 
frontier. We know the story: one thousand and one American nights, one 
long night of fear and love.<br>
<br>
What is new is the majesty Springsteen and his band have brought to this
 story. Springsteen's singing, his words and the band's music have 
turned the dreams and failures two generations have dropped along the 
road into an epic -- an epic that began when that car went over the 
cliff in Rebel without a Cause. One feels that all it ever meant, all it
 ever had to say, is on this album, brought forth with a determination 
one would have thought was burnt out years ago. One feels that the music
 Springsteen has made from this long story has outstripped the story; 
that it is, in all its fire, a demand for something new.<br>
<br>
In one sense, all this talk of epic comes down to sound. Rolling Stone 
contributing editor Jon Landau, Mike Appel and Springsteen produced Born
 to Run in a style as close to mono as anyone can get these days; the 
result is a sound full of grandeur. For all it owes to Phil Spector, it 
can be compared only to the music Bob Dylan &amp; the Hawks made onstage
 in 1965 and '66. With that sound, Springsteen has achieved something 
very special. He has touched his world with glory, without glorifying 
anything: not the unbearable pathos of the street fight in "Jungleland,"
 not the scared young lovers of "Backstreets" and not himself.<br>
<br>
<br>
 "Born to Run" is the motto that speaks for the album's tales, just as 
the guitar figure that runs through the title song -- the finest 
compression of rock &amp; roll thrill since the opening riffs of "Layla"
 -- speaks for its music. But "Born to Run" is uncomfortably close to 
another talisman of the lost kids that careen across this record, a 
slogan Springsteen's motto inevitably suggests. It is an old tattoo: 
"Born to Lose." Springsteen's songs -- filled with recurring images of 
people stranded, huddled, scared, crying, dying -- take place in the 
space between "Born to Run" and "Born to Lose," as if to say, the only 
run worth making is the one that forces you to risk losing everything 
you have. Only by taking that risk can you hold on to the faith that you
 have something left to lose. Springsteen's heroes and heroines face 
terror and survive it, face delight and die by its hand, and then watch 
as the process is reversed, understanding finally that they are paying 
the price of romanticizing their own fear.<br>
<br>
One soft infested summer<br>
Me and Terry became friends<br>
Trying in vain to breathe<br>
The fire we was born in...<br>
Remember all the movies, Terry<br>
We'd go see<br>
Trying to learn to walk like the heroes<br>
We thought we had to be<br>
Well after all this time<br>
To find we're just like all the rest<br>
Stranded in the park<br>
And forced to confess<br>
To Hiding on the backstreets<br>
Hiding on the backstreets<br>
Where we swore forever friends....<br>
<br>
Those are a few lines from "Backstreets," a song that begins with music 
so stately, so heartbreaking, that it might be the prelude to a rock 
&amp; roll version of The Illiad. Once the piano and organ have 
established the theme the entire band comes and plays the theme again. 
There is an overwhelming sense of recognition: No, you've never heard 
anything like this before, but you understand it instantly, because this
 music -- or Springsteen crying, singing wordlessly, moaning over the 
last guitar lines of "Born to Run," or the astonishing chords that 
follow each verse of "Jungleland," or the opening of "Thunder Road" -- 
is what rock &amp; roll is supposed to sound like.<br>
<br>
The songs, the best of them, are adventures in the dark, incidents of 
wasted fury. Tales of kids born to run who lose anyway, the songs can, 
as with "Backstreets," hit so hard and fast that it is almost impossible
 to sit through them without weeping. And yet the music is exhilarating.
 You may find yourself shaking your head in wonder, smiling through 
tears at the beauty of it all. I'm not talking about lyrics; they're 
buried, as they should be, hard to hear for the first dozen playings or 
so, coming out in bits and pieces. To hear Springsteen sing the line 
"Hiding on the backstreets" is to be captured by an image; the details 
can come later. Who needed to figure out all the words to "Like a 
Rolling Stone" to understand it?<br>
<br>
It is a measure of Springsteen's ability to make his music bleed that 
"Backstreets," which is about friendship and betrayal between a boy and a
 girl, is far more deathly than "Jungleland," which is about a gang war.
 The music isn't "better," nor is the singing -- but it is more 
passionate, more deathly and, necessarily, more alive. That, if 
anything, might be the key to this music: As a ride through terror, it 
resolves itself finally as a ride into delight.<br>
<br>
"Oh-o, come on, take my hand," Springsteen sings, "Riding out to case 
the promised land." And there, in a line, is Born to Run. You take what 
you find, but you never give up your demand for something better because
 you know, in your heart, you deserve it. That contradiction is what 
keeps Springsteen's story, and the promised land's, alive. Springsteen 
took what he found and made something better himself. This album is it.<br>

<strong class="text-strong">DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN</strong><br>
<strong class="text-strong">The Boss' Triumphant Return<br>
Rolling Stone , 1978-07-27<br>
By Dave Marsh</strong><br>
<br>
Occasionally, a record appears that changes fundamentally the way we 
hear rock &amp; roll, the way it's recorded, the way it's played. Such 
records?Jimi Hendrix' Are You Experienced, Bob Dylan's "Like a Rolling 
Stone," Van Morrison's Astral Weeks, Who's Next, The Band?force 
response, both from the musical community and the audience. To me, these
 are the records justifiably called classics, and I have no doubt that 
Bruce Springsteen's Darkness on the Edge of Town -will someday fit as 
naturally within that list as the Rolling Stones' "(I Can't Get No) 
Satisfaction" or Sly and the Family Stone's "Dance to the Music." <br>
<br>
One ought to be wary of making such claims, but in this case, they're 
justified at every level. In the area of production, Darkness on the 
Edge of Town is nothing less than a breakthrough. Springsteen?with 
coproducer Jon Landau, engineer Jimmy lovine and Charles Plotkin, who 
helped lovine mix the LP?is the first artist to fuse the spacious 
clarity of Los Angeles record making and the raw density of English 
productions. That's the major reason why the result is so different from
 Born to Run's Phil Spector wall of sound. On the earlier album, for 
instance, the individual instruments were deliberately obscured to 
create the sense of one huge instrument. Here, the same power is 
achieved more naturally. Most obviously. Max Weinberg's drumming has 
enormous size, a heartbeat with the same kind of space it occupies 
onstage (the only other place I've heard a bass drum sound this big). <br>
<br>
Now that it can be heard, the E Street Band is clearly one of the finest
 rock &amp; roll groups ever assembled. Weinberg, bassist Garry Tallent 
and guitarist Steve Van Zandt are a perfect rhythm section, capable of 
both power and groove. Pianist Roy Bittan is as virtuosic as on Born to 
Run, and saxophonist Clarence demons, though he has fewer solos, evokes 
more than ever the spirit of King Curtis. But the revelation is organist
 Danny Federici, who barely appeared on the last LP. Federici's style is
 utterly singular, focusing on wailing, trebly chords that sing (and in 
the marvelous solo at the end of "Racing in the Street," truly cry). <br>
<br>
Yet the dominant instrumental focus of Darkness on the Edge of Town is 
Bruce Springsteen's guitar. Like his songwriting and singing, 
Springsteen's guitar playing gains much of its distinctiveness through 
pastiche. There are echoes of a dozen influences?Duane Eddy, Jimmy Page,
 JefF Beck, Jimi Hendrix, Roy Buchanan, even Ennio Morricone's Sergio 
Leone soundtracks ?but the synthesis is completely Springsteen's own. 
Sometimes Springsteen quotes a famous solo?Robbie Robertson's from the 
live version of "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues" at the end of "Something 
in the Night," Jeff Beck's from "Heart Full of Soul" in the bridge of 
"Candy's Room"? and then shatters it into another dimension. In the end 
the most impressive guitar work of all is just his own: "Adam Raised a 
Cain" and "Streets of Fire" are things no one's ever heard before. <br>
<br>
Much the same can be said about Springsteen's singing. Certainly, Van 
Morrison and Bob Dylan are the inspirations for taking such extreme 
chances: bending and twisting syllables; making two key lines on 
"Streets of Fire" a wordless, throttled scream; the wailing and humming 
that precede and follow some of the record's most important lyrics. But 
more than ever, Springsteen's voice is personal, intimate and revealing,
 bigger and less elusive. It's the possibility hinted at on Born to 
Run's "Backstreets" and in the postverbal wail at the end 
of'Jungleland." In fact, Springsteen picks up that moan at the beginning
 of "Something in the Night," on which he turns in the new album's most 
adventurous vocal. <br>
<br>
One could say a great deal about the construction of this LP. The 
programming alone is impressive: each side is a discrete progression of 
similar lyrical and musical themes, and the whole is a more universal 
version of the same picture. Ideas, characters and phrases jump from 
song to song like threads in a tapestry, and everything's one long 
interrelationship. But all of these elements?the production, the 
playing, even the programming?are designed to focus our attention on 
what Springsteen has to tell us about the last three years of his life. <br>
<br>
In a way, this album might take as its text two lines from. Jackson 
Browne: "Nothing survives?/ But the way we live our lives." But where 
Browne is content to know this, Springsteen explores it: Darkness on the
 Edge of Town is about the kind of life that deserves survival. Despite 
its title, it is a complete rejection of despair. Bruce Springsteen says
 this over and over again, more bluntly and clearly than anyone could 
have imagined. There isn't a single song on this record in which his 
yearning for a perfect existence, a life lived to the hilt, doesn't play
 a central role. <br>
<br>
Springsteen also realizes the terrible price one pays for living at 
half-speed. In "Racing in the Street," the album's most beautiful 
ballad, Springsteen separates humanity into two classes: "Some guys they
 just give up living / And start dying little by little, piece by piece /
 Some guys come home from work and wash up / And go racin' in the 
street." But there's nothing smug about it, because Springsteen knows 
that the line separating the living dead from the walking wounded is a 
fine and bitter one. In the song's final verse, he describes with 
genuine love a person of the first sort, someone whose eyes "hate for 
just being born." In "Factory," he depicts the most numbing sort of life
 with a compassion that's nearly religious. And in "Adam Raised a Cain,"
 the son who rejected his father's world comes to understand their 
relationship as "the dark heart of a dream"?a dream become nightmarish, 
but a vision of something better nonetheless. <br>
<br>
There are those who will say that "Adam Raised a Cain" is full of hate, 
but I don't believe it. The only hate I hear on this LP is embodied in a
 single song, "Streets of Fire," where Springsteen describes how it 
feels to be trapped by lies. And even here, he has the maturity to hate 
the He, not the liar. <br>
<br>
Throughout the new album, Springsteen's lyrics are a departure from his 
early work, almost its opposite, in fact: dense and compact, not 
scattershot. And if the scenes are the same?the highways, bars, cars and
 toil? they also represent facets of life that rock &amp; roll has too 
often ignored or, what's -worse, romanticized. Darkness on the Edge of 
Town faces everyday life whole, daring to see if something greater can 
be made of it. This is naive perhaps, but also courageous. Who else but a
 brave innocent could believe so boldly in a promised land, or write a 
song that not only quotes Martha and the Vandellas' "Dancing in the 
Street" but paraphrases the Beach Boys' "Don't Worry Baby"? <br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen has a tendency to inspire messianic regard in his 
fans?including this one. This isn't so much because he's regarded as a 
savior?though his influence has already been substantial?but because he 
fulfills the rock tradition in so many ways. Like Elvis Presley and 
Buddy Holly, Springsteen has the ability, and the zeal, to do it all. 
For many years, rock &amp; roll has been splintered between the West 
Coast's monopoly on the genre's lyrical and pastoral characteristics and
 a British and Middle American stranglehold on toughness and raw power. 
Springsteen unites these aspects: he's the only artist I can think of 
who's simultaneously comparable to Jackson Browne and Pete Townshend. 
Just as the production of this record unifies certain technical trends, 
Springsteen's presentation makes rock itself whole again. This is true 
musically?he rocks as hard as a punk, but with the verbal grace of a 
singer/songwriter?and especially emotionally. If these songs are about 
experienced adulthood, they sacrifice none of rock &amp; roll's 
adolescent innocence. Springsteen escapes the narrow dogmatism of both 
Old Wave and New, and the music's possibilities are once again 
limitless. <br>
<br>
Four years ago, in a Cambridge bar, my friend Jon Landau and I watched 
Bruce Springsteen give a performance that changed some lives?my own 
included. About a similar night. Landau later wrote what was to become 
rock criticism's most famous sentence: "I saw rock &amp; roll future and
 its name is Bruce Springsteen." With its usual cynicism, the world 
chose to think of this as a fanciful way of calling Springsteen the Next
 Big Thing. <br>
<br>
I've never taken it that way. To me, these words, shamefully mistreated 
as they've been, have kept a different shape. What they've always said 
was that someday Bruce Springsteen would make rock &amp; roll that would
 shake men's souls and make them question the direction of their lives. 
That would do, in short, all the marvelous things rock had always 
promised to do. <br>
<br>
But Born to Run was not that music. It sounded instead like the end of 
an era, the climax of the first twenty years of this grand tradition, 
the apex of our collective adolescence. Darkness on the Edge of Town 
does not. It feels like the threshold of a new period in -which we'll 
again have "lives on the line where dreams are found and lost." It poses
 once more the question that rock &amp; roll's epiphanic moments always 
raise: Do you believe in magic? <br>
<br>
And once again, the answer is yes. Absolutely.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen Raises Cain  by Dave Marsh. 1978</strong><br>
<br>
One of Bruce Springsteen's most popular early songs is called "4th of 
July, Asbury Park (Sandy)." That he is spending this Independence Day on
 the shores of the wrong ocean is an irony that escapes no one, 
including himself. L.A. is not terra incognita, but Springsteen does not
 yet reign here as he does back east, and perhaps the time is auspicious
 to change that. Although he has been up all night mixing tapes recorded
 at his last concert (Saturday night, in Berkeley), he is at the pool 
soaking up the sun by eleven a.m.<br>
<br>
If God had invented a hotel for rock bands, it probably would look like 
the Sunset Marquis, where Springsteen and the E Street Band are staying.
 Nestled on a steep side street just below Sunset Strip, the Marquis is a
 combination summer camp and commune. Its rooms are laid out around the 
swimming pool and guests on the first floor use the pool terrace as a 
sort of patio. In the daytime, the poolside is jammed, and at night, 
it's easy to tell who's home by the lights inside, behind curtained 
glass doors. Springsteen, the band, their crew and entourage occupy 
thirty rooms, including all those around the pool.<br>
<br>
At noon, producer/manager Jon Landau, Bruce and I disappear into 
Springsteen's room to play the Berkeley concert mixes. There are two 
mixes of an eight-minute rendition of "Prove It All Night" that shatters
 the LP version, and one mix of an unnamed, shorter instrumental, often 
called "Paradise by the Sea," which opens the second half of his 
concerts. Even on a small cassette player, it's clear that something 
considerable is going on.<br>
<br>
For years people have been begging Springsteen to make a live album, and
 "Prove It All Night" shows why. The song is considered the lightest 
item on Darkness on the Edge of Town, his new album, but onstage it 
becomes what pianist Roy Bittan, for one, thinks is the most exciting 
song of the show, featuring a lengthy guitar and keyboard improvisation 
that sounds like an unholy alliance between the Yardbirds and Bob Dylan.
 When the introduction gives way to the melody of the song, "Prove It" 
is transformed from something potentially light and dismissible into an 
emotional crucible. Hearing it, you may wonder if "Prove It All Night" 
is a hit single, but you know it's a great song.<br>
<br>
"Paradise by the Sea" is its alter ego. Only Springsteen, touring behind
 a new album, would have come up with this to open the second half of 
the show: a five-minute instrumental featuring Clarence Clemons' sax and
 Danny Federici's organ, which simultaneously evokes Duane Eddy and 
Booker T. and the MGs.<br>
<br>
Clemons walks into the room with an unbelievably joyous look on his 
face, and when the tape ends, he takes Bruce by the arm and shouts, 
"Everybody into the pool!" The next sound is a series of splashes, and 
in a few moments they reappear, bathing suits dripping, and listen 
again, then repeat the performance. Soon, the tiny hotel bedroom is 
crowded with half a dozen people dripping wet and exuberant.<br>
<br>
At 6:30 p.m., Bruce is at KMET-FM to do an on-the-air interview with 
disc jockey Mary Turner. There are a couple of bottles of champagne, 
which may be a mistake; Bruce gets loose pretty easily. And in fact, he 
is a little sloshed as the interview begins, but Turner plays it 
perfectly, fishing for stories. She gets at least one winner.<br>
<br>
"When my folks moved out to California," Bruce begins in response to a 
question about whether he really knows "a pretty little place in 
Southern California/Down San Diego way" as he claims in "Rosalita," "my 
mom decided -- see my father and I would fight all the time -- and she 
decided that we should go to Tijuana [he laughs his hoarse laugh, 
reserved for the truly absurd]. So we got in the car and drove down 
there, arguing all the way. First I drove and he yelled at me, and then 
he drove and I yelled at him.<br>
<br>
"Anyway, we finally go there, and of course, my old man is the 
softest-hearted guy in the world. Within fifteen minutes, some guy has 
sold him some watch that must've run for all of an hour and a half 
before it stopped. And then some guy comes up and says, 'Hey would you 
guys like to have your picture taken on a zebra?'<br>
<br>
"Well, we looked at each other -- who could believe this, right? Zebras 
are in Africa. And so we said, 'Well if you've got a zebra, we 
definitely want to have our picture taken.' So we give him ten bucks and
 he takes us around this corner, and he's got . . . he's got a damn 
donkey with stripes painted on its side. And he pulls out these two hats
 -- one says Pancho, one says Cisco -- I swear -- and he sits us on the 
donkey and takes our picture. My mother's still got that picture. But 
that is all I knew about Southern California at the time I wrote 
'Rosalita.'"<br>
<br>
This is the easiest I have ever heard Bruce speak of his father. "Adam 
Raised a Cain," from the new album, may have exorcised a lot of ghosts. 
In some of the stories Bruce has told onstage about their relationship, 
however, his father seems like a demon, which of course, he is not.<br>
<br>
In fact, Douglas Springsteen has lived a very rough working-class life. 
For a great deal of Bruce's childhood, his family (he has two sisters, 
both younger) shared a house with his grandparents while his father 
worked at an assortment of jobs -- in a factory, as a gardener, as a 
prison guard -- never making as much as $10,000 a year. Later he moved 
the family from New Jersey to northern California, where he is now a bus
 driver. Bruce says that the tales of their conflicts are true ("I don't
 make 'em up"), but that they're meant to be "universal." He is not 
exactly enthusiastic about discussing the relationship, although in a 
couple of the songs that didn't make it onto Darkness, particularly "The
 Promise" and "Independence Day," he has chronicled his preoccupation 
with fathers as thoroughly as did John Steinbeck in East of Eden, the 
film that inspired "Adam."<br>
<br>
Bruce is so loose by now that when an ad for Magic Mountain's roller 
coaster -- the largest in the world -- comes on, he discusses great 
roller coasters he has known, and his desire to see this one. "You wanna
 date?" he asks Turner, in front of who knows how many listeners. She 
makes the perfect reply: "Only if we sit in the front seat."<br>
<br>
After the interview, we head to the car and a beach house in Santa 
Monica, where there's a promise of food and fireworks. We race straight 
out Santa Monica Boulevard to the freeway. It's like something out of a 
Steve McQueen movie (Bullitt). I haven't spent as reckless a moment as 
this one in years. But Bruce, who isn't driving, is determined to see 
those fireworks. "C'mon," he says, over and over again. "I don't wanna 
miss 'em." He's like a little boy, and the car whips along, straight 
into a traffic jam at the end of the Santa Monica Freeway, where we can 
see hints of the fireworks -- blue, red, gold, green -- cascading out 
over the ocean.<br>
<br>
It's a chill night and the party is outside, Band and crew members 
shiver on the patio, chewing on cold sandwiches (Swiss cheese, ham, 
turkey, roast beef) and sucking down beer and soda. Bruce quickly 
decides this won't do. He heads for the gate leading to the beach. 
"C'mon," he says to one and all. "Let's walk up to the pier. I want a 
hot dog."<br>
<br>
And so we strike out down the beach. The pier is a mile south, far 
enough so that it's lights are only a glow on the horizon. And covering 
the beach the entire distance are people shooting off their own 
fireworks, Roman candles and skyrockets. We haven't gone a hundred yards
 before the scene has become a combat zone. I suggest a strategic 
retreat to the highway. Bruce gives me a look. "C'mon, what's the worst 
that can happen? A rocket upside the head?" He giggles with joy and 
keeps trudging on through the sand.<br>
<br>
The rockets are exploding directly over our heads now, and once in a 
while, closer than that. A rocket upside the head is not unimaginable. 
Bruce strikes out closer to the water, where the sand is more firmly 
packed and the walking is easier. Down here there are other sorts of 
activity: lovers in sleeping bags and drinkers sitting in sand pits, 
nursing themselves against the chill with liquor. The rockets, fewer 
now, drift out into the water to die with a hiss or a fizzle, and Bruce 
Springsteen moves through it all, just another cloud in a hurricane, a 
natural force or maybe just another kid.<br>
<br>
Two hot dogs with relish and an hour of pinball later, we walk back 
along the highway to the car and zip back to the hotel. Tour manager Jim
 McHale, David Landau (Warren Zevon's lead guitarist and Jon's brother) 
and booking agent Barry Bell are talking in Jon's room when Bruce bursts
 through the poolside curtains. His face is glowing. "We're goin' to 
make the hit," he shouts, and ducks back out. McHale's jaw drops and he 
races from the room. "I think they're going to paint the billboard," 
says David.<br>
<br>
The raid isn't completely a surprise. Sunday night, driving up the Strip
 on the way to see The Buddy Holly Story, Bruce had first noticed the 
billboard looming above a seven-story building just west of the 
Continental Hyatt House. Billboards are a Hollywood institution -- 
they're put up for every significant album and concert appearance -- and
 this one uses the Darkness cover photo, poorly cropped, to promote both
 the new record and the group's Forum appearance tomorrow night. As we 
passed this enormous monument, which rears up forty feet above the 
building, Bruce had groaned and slumped in his seat. "That is the 
ugliest thing I've ever seen in my life," he said.<br>
<br>
The billboard is only a few blocks up the street. According to all 
accounts, Springsteen, Clemons, bass guitarist Garry Tallent and several
 crew members approached with some stealth the office building on which 
the billboard is perched. Much to their surprise, the building was wide 
open, and the elevator quickly took them to the roof. There, McHale, 
perhaps figuring that cleverness is better than a bust, quickly 
organized them. There were twenty cans of black spray paint, quickly 
distributed, and Bruce, Garry and Clarence quickly took positions on the
 paperhangers' ledge. Bell was positioned across the street to watch for
 cops. At a signal from McHale, the painting began: PROVE IT ALL NIGHT 
spread across the billboard from edge to edge, the middle words nearly 
lost in the dark photo of Bruce. Then Bruce stood on Clemons' shoulders 
and painted another legend above NIGHT: E STREET, it said. As they were 
clambering down, a signal came -- the cops. Some headed back for the 
elevator, but Bruce, Clarence and McHale left Cagney-style, down the 
outside fire escape. It was a false alarm anyway.<br>
<br>
In the hotel lobby at a quarter to three, Bruce is exhilarated. "You 
shoulda been there," he says, running over the event like a successful 
general fresh from battle. Was he worried about getting caught? "Naw," 
he says. "I figured if they caught us, that was great, and if we got 
away with it, that was even better." He looks down at himself, hands 
black with paint, boots ruinously dusty from the beach, and laughs. 
"There it is," he says. "Physical evidence . . . The only thing is, I 
wanted to get to my face and paint on a mustache. Bu tit was just too 
damn high." He terms the paint job, "an artistic improvement."<br>

<br>
Last night, as we were getting into the car after the KMET interview, 
Bruce began to talk about the reviews Darkness on the Edge of Town has 
been getting. It is a subject on which he qualifies as something of an 
expert: more has been written about him -- and about what has been 
written on him -- than any other rock performer of recent years, with 
the possible exception of Mick Jagger. The miracle is, I guess, that the
 scars barely show -- instead Springsteen looks at the press with avid 
interest.<br>
<br>
"It's a weird thing about those reviews," Bruce says. "You can find any 
conceivable opinion in them: one guy says the record's exactly like Born
 to Run and it's great, the next one says it's not like Born to Run and 
it's great, the next one says, it's not like Born to Run and it's 
awful." This amuses him. The nearly unanimous opinion that the album is 
grim and depressing doesn't.<br>
<br>
It's the title, I suggest. "I know, I know," he says impatiently. "But I
 put in the first few seconds of 'Badlands,' the first song on the 
album, those lines about 'I believe in the love and the hope and the 
faith.' It's there on all four corners of the album" By which he means 
the first and last songs on each side: "Badlands" and "Racing in the 
Street," "The Promised Land" and the title song. He is clearly 
distressed: he meant Darkness to be "relentless," not grim.<br>
<br>
Later, I ask him why the album lacks the humor that buoys his shows. "In
 the show, it's a compilation of all the recorded stuff," he says in the
 halting way he uses when he's taking something seriously. "If you go 
back to The Wild and Innocent, 'Rosalita' is there, and all that stuff. 
But when I was making this particular album, I just had a specific thing
 in mind. And one of the important things was that it had to be just a 
relentless . . . just a barrage of the particular thing.<br>
<br>
"I got an album's worth of pop songs, like 'Rendezvous' and early 
English-style stuff. I got an album's worth right now, and I'm gonna get
 it out somehow. I wanna do an album that's got ten or eleven things 
like that on it. But I didn't feel it was the right time to do that, and
 I didn't want to sacrifice any of the intensity of the album by 
throwing in 'Rendezvous,' even though I knew it was popular from the 
show."<br>
<br>
The other criticism that is easily made of Darkness concerns the 
repetition of certain images: cars, street life, abandonment by or of 
women, family and friends. Those who like this call it style; those who 
don't say Springsteen is drilling a dry hole. But perhaps Springsteen's 
greatest and most repeated image is the lie.<br>
<br>
"It's hard to explain without getting too heavy. What it is, it's the 
characters' commitment. In the face of all the betrayals, in the face of
 all the imperfections that surround you in whatever kind of life you 
lead, it's the characters' refusal to let go of their own humanity, to 
let go of their own belief in the other side. It's a certain loss of 
innocence -- more so than in the other albums."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I drove out to the Forum this afternoon with <strong class="text-strong">Obie.
 Obie is twenty-five, and she has been Bruce Springsteen's biggest fan 
for more than a decade. When he was still just a local star, she waited 
overnight for tickets to his shows to make certain she'd have perfect 
seats. She is now secretary to Miami Steve Van Zandt, Springsteen's 
guitarist and manager/producer of Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes.
 This means what while Springsteen is on tour, Obie is the de facto 
manager of the Asbury Jukes. But she's also something more. She makes 
some of the jackets and suits Bruce wears onstage. She is also a 
historian; there are a thousand Asbury Park legends behind her twinkling
 eyes. More than anything, she is a fan who counts the days between 
Springsteen shows. Her loyalty is rewarded. Whenever she comes to a 
show, in any town, the front-row center is reserved for her.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"></strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It is partly this that makes Bruce Springsteen so attractive: he is 
surrounded by real-life characters that form the kind of utopian 
community most of us lost when we graduated high school; one of the 
reasons Springsteen is such a singular performer is that he has never 
lost touch with this decidedly noncosmopolitan gang.<br>
<br>
Part of the legend is the E Street Band. "Ya know, you can tell by 
looking at 'em," Bruce explains to me, "that this isn't a bunch of guys 
with a whole lot in common. But somehow the music cuts right through all
 that."<br>
<br>
There's a lot to cut. Bassist Garry Tallent is a consummate rockabilly 
addict who looks the part. He's been known to use Brylcreem. Organist 
Danny Federici has an angel face that could pass for the kind of tough 
guy Harvey Keitel plays in Fingers. Pianist Roy Bittan and drummer Max 
Weinberg are seasoned pros, veterans of recording studios and Broadway 
pit bands. Miami Steve Van Zandt is a perpetual motion machine, a comic 
version of Keith Richards' Barbary pirate act, with a slice of 
small-town-boy-made-good on the side. And Clarence Clemons, last of all,
 dwells in a land all his own, not quite like the universe the rest of 
us inhabit, though it is seemingly available to all comers. Clemons 
transforms any room he enters, as a six-foot plus black man with the 
bulk of a former football player often can do, but even in his own digs 
at the Marquis, there's something special happening -- his hospitality 
is perfect, and it is in Clarence's room that the all-night part is most
 likely to run.<br>
<br>
Bruce stands distinctly outside this group. "It's weird," he says, 
"'cause it's not really a touring band or just a recording band. And 
it's definitely me, I'm a solo act, y'know." But there is also a sense 
in which Bruce Springsteen does not mesh in any society, and it has a 
great deal to do with what makes him so obsessive about his music.<br>
<br>
Before he landed a record contract, all of the Asbury Park musicians 
held day jobs -- Garry Tallent worked in a music store, Clemons was a 
social worker, Van Zandt was in the construction union. The exception, 
always, was Bruce, who never held any other job, apparently because he 
could not conceive of doing anything else. At age eight, when he first 
heard Presley, lightning struck, and when he picked up the guitar at 
thirteen, another bolt hit him. "When I got the guitar," he told me 
Wednesday night, "I wasn't getting out of myself. I was already out of 
myself. I knew myself, and I did not dig me. I was getting into myself."<br>
<br>
By fourteen, he was in his first band; by sixteen, he was so good that 
when he practiced in his manager's garage, neighborhood kids would stand
 on milk crates at the windows with their noses pressed to the glass, 
just to hear. The only other things besides music that ever meant much 
to him, Springsteen says, were surfing and cars. But nothing -- even 
girls -- ever got in the way of his obsession with his music; there is a
 certain awe in the way that people who have known him for many years 
speak of his single-minded devotion to playing. It's as if he always 
knew his destiny, and while this hasn't made him cold -- he is one of 
the friendliest people I know -- it has given him considerable distance 
from everyday relationships. One does not ever think of Bruce 
Springsteen married and settled down, raising a family, having kids; 
that would be too much monkey business.<br>
<br>
What keeps the band so tight is the two-to-three hour sound check before
 each gig. Today's began at 3:30 p.m. -- it's a 7:30 show on the ticket 
-- and didn't end until nearly seven. In part, these are informal band 
rehearsals, with Bruce working up new material: as we enter the hall at 
five, he is singing Buddy Holly's "Rave On," a number he has never done 
live. But there's more to it than that.<br>
<br>
On this tour, Springsteen's sound mixer is Bruce Jackson, a tall blond, 
Australian who worked for Elvis Presley for several years. He is amazed 
at Springsteen's perfectionism. "At every date," he says, "he goes out 
and sits in every section of the hall to listen to the sound. And if it 
isn't right, even in the last row, I hear about it, and we make changes.
 I mean every date, too -- he doesn't let it slip in Davenport, Iowa, or
 something." Presley, on the other hand, was concerned only with the 
sound he would hear in the onstage monitors.<br>
<br>
("Anybody who works for me," Springsteen says, without a trace of a 
joke, "the first thing you better know is I'm gonna drive you crazy. 
Because I don't compromise in certain areas. So if you're gonna be in, 
you better be ready for that.")<br>
<br>
Which perhaps explains the consistently high quality of Springsteen's 
life performances. I must have seen forty over the years, and no two are
 alike. Even if the songs are the same, which they hardly ever are, 
Bruce brings something different to every one. Tonight's is 
conversational -- the loosest I've ever seen, and at the same time, 
frighteningly intense. He begins immediately after "Badlands," the 
opening number, by talking about the walk on the beach last night ("It's
 like a combat zone out there") and makes some self-deprecating remarks 
about his press attention, which has mushroomed this week: Robert 
Hilburn had given him a rave advance notice in the Sunday Los Angeles 
Times, and Ed Kociela had more than matched it with a pair of pieces -- 
interview and Berkeley concert review -- in Monday's Herald-Examiner. In
 a way, Springsteen was taking Los Angeles by storm, as he had taken New
 York in August 1975 with the release of Born to Run and ten shows at 
the Bottom Line. There are some who must find such excessive praise 
threatening or suspicious -- though only a fool would think that such 
enthusiasm could be manufactured -- but Bruce diffuses it easily: "See 
all that fancy stuff in the papers about me? Big deal, huh? I gotta tell
 you, I only levitate to the upper deck on Wednesdays and Fridays . . 
.Wednesdays and Fridays, and I don't do no windows."<br>
<br>
Perhaps the most nervy and nerve-racking antic Springsteen has retained 
in making the transition to hockey arenas is his trademark leap into the
 audience during the third song, "Spirit in the Night." He looks frail 
-- at an extremely agile five-foot-nine, he is not -- and one is always 
worried that his consummate trust in his fans is going to let him down. 
But night after night he gets away with it. Somehow. Tonight, the 
security doesn't get the picture and tries to drag the fans off Bruce as
 he ascends an aisle deep in the loges. "You guys work here or 
something?" Springsteen demands. "Get outta here. These guys are my 
friends." The crowd roars.<br>
<br>
His parents have come down from their home near San Francisco for the 
show, and the evening is sprinkled with allusions to them and his 
sixteen-year-old sister, Pam. The stories he tells are always among his 
best moments, but what gets me tonight are the asides and dedications: 
he tells about the billboard ("We made a few improvements,"), about 
asking Mary Turner for a date, and when he does "For You," he dedicates 
the song to Greg Kihn, who recorded the song for Berserkley Records a 
year ago. And because Gary Busey is here, he tells about seeing The 
Buddy Holly Story. It's the perfect review.<br>
<br>
"It's funny because I could never really picture Buddy Holly moving. To 
me, he was always just that guy with the bow tie on the album cover. I 
liked the picture because it made him a lot more real for me."<br>
<br>
But the encores are the evening's highlights. First, "The Promise," a 
quiet ballad that was one of the first things Springsteen wrote for the 
new album, and which was finally dropped from it. In an earlier version,
 "The Promise" was taken by many listeners to be a metaphor the lawsuit 
with former manager Mike Appel that delayed production of the new LP for
 more than a year. But tonight, with a new verse added in the studio, 
it's obviously about something more universal: "Now my daddy taught me 
how to walk quiet/And how to make peace with the past/And I learned real
 good to tighten up inside/And I don't say nothin' unless I'm asked."<br>
<br>
And then, to top it all, he does his two most famous songs, back to 
back: "Born to Run" and "Because the Night," the latter in a version 
that shrivels the Patti Smith hit. When the night finally ends, it is 
with "Quarter to Three," houselights up full and the crowd singing along
 as spontaneously as I've ever heard 14,5000 people do anything.<br>
<br>
Backstage I run into Jackson Browne. "Good show, huh?" I say. He looks 
at me querulously, like I was just released from the nut house. "Uh 
unh," Jackson says. "Great show."<br>
<br>
At midnight, local FM stations broadcast an announcement that 
Springsteen will play the Roxy, the 500-seat club and record-company 
hangout on Sunset Strip, on Friday night, one show only. Lines begin 
forming almost immediately.<br>
<br>
Thursday, July 6th<br>
<br>
Walking through the lobby of the Marquis last night, just after two 
a.m., I ran into Bruce, who asked if I wanted to walk over to Ben 
Frank's for something to eat. On the way I mentioned that there must be a
 lot of people in line at the Roxy just up the street. Bruce gave me a 
look. "I don't like people waiting up all night for me," he said.<br>
<br>
Bruce ate another prodigious meal: four eggs, toast, a grilled-cheese 
sandwich, large glasses of orange juice and milk. And the talk ranged 
widely: surfing (Bruce had lived with some of the Jersey breed for a 
while in the late Sixties, and he's a little frustrated with trying to 
give a glimmer of its complexity to a landlocked ho-dad like me), the 
new album and its live recording ("I don't think I'll ever go back to 
the overdub method," he said mentioning that almost all of the LP was 
done completely live in the studio, and that "Streets of Fire" and 
"Something in the Night" were first takes). But mostly we talked or 
rather, Bruce talked and I listened.<br>
<br>
Springsteen can be spellbinding, partly because he is so completely 
ingenuous, partly because of the intensity and sincerity with which he 
has thought out his role as a rock star. He delivers these ideas with an
 air of conviction, but not a proselytizing one; some of his ideas are 
radical enough for Patti Smith or the punks, yet lack their 
sanctimonious rhetoric.<br>
<br>
I asked him why the band plays so long - their shows are rarely less 
than three hours - and he said: "It's hard to explain. 'Cause every time
 I read stuff that I say, like in the papers, I always think I come off 
sounding like some kind of crazed fanatic. When I read it, it sounds 
like that, but it's the way I am about it. It's like you have to go the 
whole way because . . . that's what keeps everything real. It all ties 
in with the records and the values, the morality of the records. There's
 a certain morality of the show and it's very strict." Such comments can
 seem not only fanatical, but also self-serving. The great advantage of 
the sanctimony and rhetoric that infests the punks is that such flaws 
humanize them. Lacking such egregious characteristics, Bruce Springsteen
 seems too good to be true when reduced to cold type. Nice guys finish 
last, we are told, and here's one at the top. So what's the catch? I 
just don't know.<br>
<br>
At the end of every show, before the first encore, Bruce stands tall at 
the microphone and makes a little speech. "I want to thank all of you 
for supporting the band for the past three years," he concludes and then
 plays "Born to Run." I wondered why.<br>
<br>
"That's what it's about," he said. "Everything counts. Every person, 
every individual in the crowd counts -- to me. I see it both way. There 
is a crowd reaction. But then I also think very, very personally, one to
 one with the kids. 'Cause you put out the effort and then if it doesn't
 come through it's a . . . it's a breakdown. What I always feel is that I
 don't like to let people that have supported me down. I don't like to 
let myself down. Whatever the situation, as impossible as it is, I like 
to try to . . .I don't wanna try to get by."<br>
<br>
And so it was no surprise that, waking up this morning, I found that all
 hell had broken loose. Only 250 seats for the Roxy show were available 
for public sale, which meant that a great many of those who had waited 
up weren't going to get in. And Bruce was not just upset about this; he 
was angry. It was a betrayal, however well intentioned, and the fact 
that another 120 tickets would go to fans through radio-station 
giveaways did not mollify him. People had been fruitlessly 
inconvenienced by him. It did not matter that at most similar small club
 gigs, the proportion of public to industry is reversed. This was his 
show, and it should have been done properly.<br>
<br>
Friday, July 7th<br>
<br>
Whatever bad blood had erupted from the overnight Roxy fiasco is gone. 
In its place, one begins to get a sense of Springsteen's impact on L.A. 
Polaroids snap at the billboard modifications up the Strip, and the band
 seems prepared for a big night. At six p.m. there's a media first: 
Springsteen is interviewed on KABC, the first time he has ever been on 
TV in any way, shape or form. It's a good interview -- "It's probably 
the only thing that I live for. When I was a kid, I didn't know nothin' 
about nothin' until rock &amp; roll got into my house. To me it was the 
only thing that was ever true, it was the only thing that never let me 
down. And no matter who was out there, ten people or 10,000 people, 
there's a lot to live up to . . .What happens is, there's a lotta 
trappings, there'' a lotta things that are there to tempt you, sort of. 
It's just meaningless. And I just try to . . .I play Buddy Holly every 
night before I go on, that keeps me honest."<br>
<br>
But even more striking are the filmed performances of "Prove It All 
Night" and "Rosalita" that accompany the interview. Even on this small 
screen, Springsteen is a visual natural, mugging like a seven-year-old 
and leaping like the rocker of someone's dreams; I know why so many film
 directors, seeing him for the first time, have virtually drooled in 
anticipation.<br>
<br>
After the Forum, the Roxy seems cramped. The broadcast is set for nine, 
but it's a quarter past by the time the band takes the stage. The place 
is packed -- even the balcony box above Roy Bittan's piano looks like it
 is holding twice the customers it was intended for. And while there are
 celebrities here -- Cher and Kiss' Gene Simmons, Jackson Browne, Irving
 Azoff and Glenn Frey, Karla Bonoff, Busey, Tom Waits -- it is mostly a 
crowd of kids and young adults.<br>
<br>
The crowd rustles as Bruce steps to the mike, but he holds up his hand. 
"I want to apologize to everybody," he says, "for what happened with the
 tickets to this show. It was my fault, and I'm really sorry. I wasn't 
trying to make this no private party -- I don't play no parties anymore.
 Except my own." I think that Mrs. Springsteen, sitting in the back, 
must be very proud to have such a son. And he steps to the mike and 
sings: "Wel-a-well-a little things you say and do . . ." It's "Rave On" 
and the joint explodes. Garry Tallent, who loves this music as much as 
anyone I have ever met, is singing the choruses, his face shining. "I've
 always wanted to sing Buddy Holly onstage," he tells me later in his 
quiet way.<br>
<br>
But "Rave On" is only the ignition. Having decided to play a special 
show, Springsteen goes out of his way. He dances on the tabletops, and 
the crowd leaps to grab him. He adds "Candy's Room," one of the Darkness
 songs he never performs, and halfway through the first set, he 
introduces a "new song that I wrote right after I finished Darkness. 
It's called 'Point Blank,' and it's about being trapped." And he tells a
 story of a friend of his who has to work two jobs, as does her husband,
 to make ends meet, and "they're" still trying to take the couple's 
house away. And when he sings, it's very real, living up to that title: 
"Point blank, right between the eyes/They got you, point blank/Right 
between them pretty lies that they tell . . . . No one survives 
untouched/No one survives untouched/No one survives."<br>
<br>
Near the end of the first set, he tells this story: "Last summer, I went
 driving out in the desert near Reno -- we just flew to Phoenix and 
rented a car and drove around. And in the desert we cant upon a house 
that this old Indian had built of stuff scavenged from the desert. And 
on his house there was a sign: THIS IS THE LAND OF PEACE, LOVE, JUSTICE 
AND NO MERCY. And at the bottom of the sign, there was an arrow pointing
 down this old dirt road. And it said: THUNDER ROAD." This gets the 
biggest hand of the evening.<br>
<br>
The second half is, if anything, harder to believe. It begins, after the
 usual twenty-minute intermission, with Bruce stepping to the mike and 
saying: "All right all of you bootleggers out there in radioland. Roll 
them tapes!" And he comes on with a performance that deserves to be 
preserved: when a guitar has to be sent backstage for repairs, he calls a
 brief conference, and the band suddenly steps forward and sings, of all
 things, "Heartbreak Hotel," with Bruce as the very incarnation of his 
hero. There's an encore performance of "Independence Day," another of 
those songs that didn't make Darkness, this one the most moving ballad 
version of "Adam Raised a Cain" story I have ever heard. During "Quarter
 to Three," three hours into the set, Bruce climbs to the balcony and 
sings a chorus there before he leaps ten feet down to the piano, by some
 miracle uninjured. The houselights go up, and the kids are on their 
feet, chanting -- no one is going home. And even with the announcement 
comes that the band has left the building, no one moves. "Br-u-ce, 
Br-u-ce" the chant goes on and on, and suddenly the curtain is raised, 
and there they are (Max Weinberg fresh from the shower). They roll into 
"Twist and Shout" and finally, nearly four hours after it all began, the
 show is over.<br>
<br>
Los Angeles Times rock critic Robert Hilburn is at a loss for words. 
"How do I come back and review this show," he says despairingly, "after I
 just said that the Forum was one of the best events ever in Los 
Angeles? Who's gonna believe me?" Maybe, I can only suggest, that is 
everybody else's problem.<br>
<br>
Phoenix, Saturday, July 8th<br>
<br>
My favorite comment on last night's show came from Max Weinberg on this 
morning's flight. "You know, I was thinking in the middle of the show 
that when I was twelve years old, this is exactly what I wanted to be 
doing."<br>
<br>
Later, I ask Springsteen why he had apologized. "It just seemed like the
 only thing to do," he says. "I couldn't imagine not. There was a little
 naivete in thinking that the kids are gonna come and when somebody 
tells them that there's no more tickets, they're gonna go home. They're 
not. All I know is, it should've been done better."<br>
<br>
Still, I suggest, he could have gotten away without an apology. "I 
couldn't have gotten away with it," he says, throwing me a look. "That's
 all I try to do -- live so I can sleep at night. That's my main 
concern."<br>
<br>
It's going to be a task tonight. It was 109 degrees when we got off the 
plane and into this oven, and a film crew has shown up to shoot 
tonight's performance for a TV commercial. They'll be at the sound 
check, and they'll also have cameras -- and additional lights -- at the 
show.<br>
<br>
Springsteen seems more open and eager to promote Darkness than any of 
his other albums. Despite the massive amounts of ink he has attracted, 
he has never been a particularly accessible interview, and he has never,
 ever appeared on TV. I wonder why the change.<br>
<br>
"I always had a certain kinda thing about all those things - like the TV
 ad or this ad or that ad. But I realized shortly after this album came 
out that things had changed a lot since Born to Run. I just stopped 
taking it as seriously, and I realized that I worked a year - a year of 
my life - on somethin' and I wasn't aggressively tryin' to get it out 
there to people. I was super aggressive in my approach toward the record
 and toward makin' it happen - you know, nonrelenting. And then when it 
came out, I went, 'Oh, I don't wanna push it.'<br>
<br>
"It's just facing up to certain realities. It was ridiculous to cut off 
your nose to spite your face. What it was, was I was so blown away by 
what happened last time, I initially thought of doing no ads. Just put 
it out, literally just put it out."<br>
<br>
It is the first time I have ever heard Springsteen refer to a negative 
effect of the past three years of litigation and layoff. It's strange 
he's not more bitter, I suggest. "At the time that that went down," he 
explains," I wasn't mentally prepared. I knew nothin' about it. It was 
all distressing to me. There were some good times, but what it was, was .
 . .the loss of control. See, all the characters [on the LPs] and 
everything is about the attempt to gain control of your life. And here, 
all this stuff, whether it had a good effect or a bad effect, I realized
 the one thing it did have was it had a bad effect on my control of 
myself. Which is why I initially started playing, and why I play. That's
 what upset me most about it. It was like somebody bein' in a car with 
the gas pedal to the floor."<br>
<br>
(I have only heard him explain his relationship with former manager Mike
 Appel better on one occasion: "In a way, Mike was as naive as me," he 
said then. "'You be the Colonel, and I'll be Elvis.' Except he wasn't 
the Colonel, and I wasn't Elvis.")<br>
<br>
There are of course other reasons for the TV commercial: while 
Springsteen is enormously popular in certain areas, in others he is all 
but unknown. This is particularly true of the South. And it is 
especially difficult for people who live in the Northeast and Southwest,
 where Springsteen already is a star, to grasp his commercial 
difficulties elsewhere. Anyone who sells out both the Los Angeles Forum 
and Madison Square Garden (three nights at the latter) ought to be a 
national star, but for a variety of reasons, Springsteen is still not 
there yet. Most of this has to do with his lack of acceptance on AM 
radio - on that side of the dial, he is a virtually invisible quantity: 
"Born to Run" made it to Number Seventeen, and "Prove It All Night" will
 be fortunate to be that high, principally because both emphasize 
electric guitars, which makes them hard rock, not exactly what AM 
program directors are currently looking for.<br>
<br>
In Phoenix, however, all of this can be forgotten. Phoenix was the first
 town outside of the New York-New Jersey-Philadelphia-Boston region 
where Springsteen became popular. In the words of Danny Federici, "This 
is the first place I ever felt like a star." It's hard to believe, 
driving past these deserted desert streets at 7:30 on a Saturday 
evening, that the 10,000-seat Veterans Memorial Coliseum is sold out. 
But when the show is over, I know what Robert Hilburn felt.<br>
<br>
It's not that it's just another fantastic show. This is another goddamn 
event, and it goes farther than the Roxy, with all of that's show's 
intimacy, innocence and vulnerability, but with an added factor of 
pandemonium. It's the sweetest-tempered crowd I've ever seen, and at the
 same time, the most maniacal. Bruce dedicates the show to the town in 
memory of the time "when this was about the only place I could get a 
job," and the crowd gives it back. During "Prove It All Night," three 
extremely young girls in the front row hold up a hand-lettered sign 
written on a bedsheet. Quoting the song, it says, JUST ONE KISS WILL GET
 THESE THINGS FOR YOU. And he gets them, during "Rosalita," one after 
another, as they race up to kiss him, lightly, on the cheek. A fourth 
darts up, and just. . .reaches out and touches his hand. And finally, 
three more race up and bowl him over. ("This little girl, couldn't have 
been more than fifteen, and she had braces on her teeth," Springsteen 
exclaims later. "And she had her tongue so far down my throat I nearly 
choked.")<br>
<br>
I've never seen anything like this in such a big hall. Before the 
encores -- which include "Raise Your Hand" and the inevitable "Quarter 
to Three" -- are over, not seven, but seventeen girls have climbed up to
 hiss him, and there are couples dancing, actually jitterbugging, on the
 front of the stage. The cameramen are torn between filming Bruce, who 
is pouring it all out, and simply shooting the crowd, which is pushing 
him farther and farther.<br>
<br>
It's a perfect climax to a week of rock &amp; roll unparalleled in my 
experience. All I know is, it lives up to the grand story Bruce told in 
the midst of "Growin' Up." The story has become a virtual set-piece by 
now, but that night he added a special twist. You should get to hear it 
too. Maybe it fills in some of the cracks, maybe it explains just why 
Bruce Springsteen pushes people to the edge of frenzy.<br>
<br>
It began with a description of his family, house and home, and his 
perennial battles with his father. "Finally," he says, "my father said 
to me, 'Bruce, it's time to get serious with your life. This guitar 
thing is okay as a hobby, but you need something to fall back on. You 
should be a lawyer' -- which I coulda used later on in my career. He 
says, 'Lawyers, they run the world.' But I didn't think they did -- and I
 still don't.<br>
<br>
"My mother, she's more sensitive. She thinks I should be an author and 
write books. But I wanted to play guitar. So my mother, she's very 
Italian, she says, 'This is a big thing, you should go see the priest.' 
So I went to the rectory and knocked on the door. 'Hi, Father Ray, I'm 
Mr. Springsteen's son. I got this problem. My father thinks I should be a
 lawyer, and my mother, she wants me to be an author. But I got this 
guitar.'<br>
<br>
"Father Ray says, 'This is too big a deal for me. You gotta talk to 
God,' who I didn't know too well at the time. 'Tell him about the lawyer
 and the author,' he says, 'but don't say nothin' about that guitar.'<br>
<br>
"Well, I didn't know how to find God, so I went to Clarence's house. He 
says, 'No Sweat. He's just outside of town.' So we drive outside of 
town, way out on this little dark road.<br>
<br>
"I said, 'Clarence, are you sure you know where we're goin'?' He said, 
'Sure, I just took a guy out there the other day.' So we come to this 
little house out in the woods. There's music blasting out and a little 
hole in the door. I say, 'Clarence sent me,' and they let me in. And 
there's God behind the drums. On the bass drum, it says: G-O-D. So I 
said, 'God, I got this problem. My father wants me to be a lawyer and my
 mother wants me to be an author. But they just don't understand -- I 
got this guitar.'<br>
<br>
"God says, 'What they don't understand is that there was supposed to be 
an Eleventh Commandment. Actually, it's Moses' fault. He was so scared 
after ten, he said this is enough, and went back down the mountain. You 
shoulda see it -- great show, the burning bush, thunder, lightning. You 
see, what those guys didn't understand was that there was an Eleventh 
Commandment. And all it said was: LET IT ROCK!'"</strong></div>

<br>
ROLLING STONE Feb 1981</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen, in the abstract, is just the kind of guy my little 
New Jersey hometown schooled me to despise. Born seventy-seven days 
apart, raised maybe fifty miles apart, this beatified greaser and I grew
 up sharing little more than what came over AM radio. In Mountain Lakes,
 a community of 4000, we had a word for people like Bruce: 
Newarkylanders. The urban canker of Newark-Elizabeth was their state 
capital, but they lived and played along the boardwalked Jersey shore. 
They wore those shoulder-strap undershirts some people called 
"guinea-T's"; we called them "Newarkys." They drove muscle cars and 
worked in garages and metal shops. They ate meatball subs made of cat 
parts for lunch, and after work they shouted at their moms, cruised the 
drive-ins, punched each other out and balled their girlfriends in 
backseats.<br>
Our contempt for Newarkylanders cut almost as deep as our fear of them. 
We looked on them as prisoners, a subclass that would not get the 
college degrees and Country Squires we were marked for. But we realized 
that prisoners sometimes bust out of their cages with a special 
vengefulness. The fear was as real as a black Chevy rumbling down your 
tree-lined block, and inside are six guys with baseball bats and tire 
irons.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen has seen all this from the inside, he's seen the gates
 swing shut, he's watched people turning the locks on their own cages. 
You can hear it in his music, a music with shack-town roots; 
paradoxically, it saved him from that life. I could not have heard his 
songs, especially the early, wordier ones, and expect our meeting to 
boil down to the wracking Jersey nightmare of Joe College vs. Joe 
Greaser.<br>
<br>
While even among his ardent fans there are people who say Springsteen 
has gone to the well too many times for his favorite themes of cars, 
girls and the night, watching him perform the new songs, I came to 
believe he really was battering at new riddles: marriage, work and how 
people in America turn themselves into ghosts.<br>
<br>
I would come to understand that this jubilant rock &amp; roll cock of 
the walk never had cut it as Joe Greaser, that what had fathered his 
obsessiveness was doing time as a runty, bad-complected kid whom the 
nuns, the girls and greasers had taken turns having no use for. There is
 finally something irrevocably lonely and restless about him. He's never
 claimed any different. Springsteen wants to inspire by example -- the 
example of a trashed and resurrected American spirit. "You ask me if 
there's one thing in particular," said E Street Band pianist Roy Bittan 
when we talked about Springsteen's commitment. "There's too many things 
in particular. He's older and wiser, but he never strays from his basic 
values. He cares as much, more, about the losers than the winners. He's 
so unlike everything you think a successful rock star would be."<br>
<br>
Springsteen comes down the ramp at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport and 
looks down the empty corridor: "No autographs," he says in his 
characteristic parched cackle. "No autographs, please."<br>
<br>
This is exactly what he never says, of course, and when the tour party 
breaches the corridor's double doors, he greets a pack of young, 
denim-jacketed guys familiarly. Some are holding copies of The River, 
released just this day and headed quickly for Number One. As the 
entourage loads itself into a string of station wagons, a kid who has 
been hanging at the edge of the pack tells Bruce about a friend who's 
critically ill in a local hospital. Bruce tells the kid to get his 
friend's name to him through the record company. Doors are slamming and 
engines gunning. It's bitter cold. Just another stranger, I think.<br>
<br>
Thirty-eight hours later, after performing "Out in the Street" onstage 
at the St. Paul Civic Center, Springsteen halts the show. "I met a bunch
 of guys at the airport yesterday coming in. One told me he had a friend
 who was sick. If that fella who told me his friend was sick will come 
to the side of the stage during the break, I got something for your 
friend backstage."<br>
<br>
After the kid appeared, and was duly loaded up with autographed 
mementos, I pondered the gesture. Springsteen could have scribbled his 
good wishes on the album and been done with it. But he had left the 
benediction to be arranged in public. There's a lot of showman in 
Springsteen, and not a little preacher. Why had he let the anonymous kid
 slip so close to being forgotten, then given him his last rock &amp; 
roll rites before a crowd?<br>
<br>
"There's not much people can count on today," says Springsteen. 
"Everything has been so faithless, and people have been shown such 
disrespect. You want to show people that somehow, somewhere, someone can
 . . . I guess you just don't want to let them down. That's probably why
 we come out and play every night, there's that fear, 'cause then 
nothin' works, nothin' makes sense. As long as one thing does, if there 
can be just one thing that goes against what you see all around you, 
then you know things can be different. Mainly it's important to have 
that passion for living, to somehow get it from someplace."<br>
<br>
The inescapable cliché about faith is that it can always be doubted. 
That's the thing about Springsteen -- if you pay any attention at all, 
his lyrics and his very stance will force you into a corner where you 
must decide whether you believe him or not. I had to believe he wasn't 
staging the benediction to pump up his image -- in the tradition of Babe
 Ruth socking a homer for a dying child -- but for the kid himself. Not 
to say "rise and walk," but to offer something tangible -- the 
momentary, empathetic suffering of this captive crowd of 15,000. And 
although most are in their wild age, perhaps some of them might even 
learn a little charity themselves.<br>
<br>
Accuse Springsteen of being a "star" and he'll flick his hand like he's 
just been splashed with pigeon shit. He is eager to point out that he 
has the better deal in the meeting place between fan and star.<br>
<br>
"I think the one feeling that's more unique to this job, the best part 
of the whole thing, is meeting someone like this guy I met the other 
night who had been on a bus ten hours. He's twenty-one years old and he 
just grabs a hold of me. We're in a room crowded with people. He's 
cryin', and he doesn't care. He says, 'It's my birthday,' and I ask, 
'How old are you?' He says, 'I'm twenty-one, and this is the most 
important thing in my life.' And you know they're not kidding when they 
say it because you look in their faces and they're so full of emotion.<br>
<br>
"You meet somebody and it's like an open well. In ten minutes I'll know 
more about him than his mother and father do, maybe his best friend. All
 the things it usually takes for people to know each other just go away,
 because there's this feeling that it's so fleeting. They tell you the 
thing that's most important to them right away. It's a sobering thing, 
because you know that somewhere you did that something that meant 
something to them. It's just a real raw, emotional thing; it's like the 
cleanest thing you ever felt. You have a communication, a feeling, and I
 don't know, you just gotta love the guy. If you don't there's something
 the matter with you.<br>
<br>
"And it ain't some starry-eyed thing, and it ain't some Hollywood thing,
 and it ain't some celebrity thing. This guy, he loves you, and what's 
more, he knows you in a certain way. That's the thing that makes me 
strong. I get strong when I meet somebody like that."<br>
<br>
There is an obsessiveness to Springsteen -- the underside of his manic 
onstage energy -- that can be a little scary. It seems to spring from 
flash fires that ignite in his very detailed memory. "There ain't a note
 I play onstage," he says late one night. "that can't be traced directly
 back to my mother and father."<br>
<br>
We're riding in a rented Winnebago, rocking back and forth in icy 
crosswinds on a six-hour drive from Pittsburgh to Rochester, New York. 
We had started the drive at three a.m., an hour Springsteen takes to 
like a pup going for a walk. Still buzzed from a show that closed with 
Elvis Presley's "Mystery Train," he merrily salts some fried chicken and
 picks up a remembrance. "It was a classic little town I grew up in, 
very intent on maintaining the status quo. Everything was looked at as a
 threat, kids were looked at as a nuisance and a threat. And when you're
 a kid, your parents become fixtures, like a sofa in the living room, 
and you take for granted what they do." He lets out of his oddly 
mournful laughs. "My father used to drive around in his car, and it 
would not go in reverse. Heh. I remember pushing it backward; that was 
just something you did, you didn't even think it was strange."<br>
<br>
One of the things that makes Springsteen a whole different species of 
rock performer is his candor about the numbed, paralytic rage his 
father, Douglas Springsteen, a bus driver and sometimes prison guard, 
converted to bitterness at a very early age. Bruce will stand on a 
darkened stage and remember out loud about coming to his house late at 
night, almost always seeing the kitchen light on, to face his father. 
One day his aunt showed him a picture of his father, back from World War
 II, about to marry and start a family that would include Bruce and two 
sisters. "He looked just like John Garfield, in this great suit, he 
looked like he was gonna eat the photographer's head off. And I couldn't
 ever remember him looking that proud, or that defiant, when I was 
growing up. I used to wonder what happened to all that pride, how it 
turned into so much bitterness. He'd been so disappointed, had so much 
stuff beaten out of him by then . . ."<br>
<br>
Sitting in various arenas, ten years gone from my own home, I envy the 
teenage audience that is hearing Springsteen talk to them about that 
troublesome blood tie. For many, it is the first time anybody has nosed 
around in their feelings about their parents; paradoxically, 
Springsteen's anger seems to set beating, at least for a few moments, a 
kind of heartsickness that might turn out to be love for those parents. 
But it's not a Sunday school rap: ". . .so much beaten out of him that 
he couldn't accept the idea that I had a dream and possibilities. The 
things I wanted he thought were just foolish. People get so much shit 
shoveled on 'em every day. But it's important to hold on to those 
things. Don't let anybody call you foolish."<br>
<br>
He takes the Esquire he has absently, slowly been stroking, shrieks once
 and slams into "Badlands" and the cathartic, energized slide licks that
 sound like the hand of God reaching down to rip the tops off fleeting 
cars: "Poor man wanna be rich/Rich man wanna be king/And a king ain't 
satisfied/ Till he rule everything . . ."<br>
<br>
When he rocks back to goose out the taut guitar break in "Candy's Room,"
 or jumps downstage with harmonica to race Clarence Clemons' sax to the 
end of "Promised Land," it's invigorating to notice the guy can play, 
that despite all his steeplechasing and singing, he doesn't come off as a
 slacker on harp and guitar. Maybe that's because there's nothing casual
 about his attack.<br>
<br>
At age nine, Springsteen saw Elvis on The Ed Sullivan Show. But in 1959,
 Bruce found guitar lessons to be "oppressive," his hands were too 
small, and aspirations toward big-league baseball took over. "I wanted 
it pretty bad at the time. Everyday from when I was eight until thirteen
 I'd be outside pitching that ball." But the guitar fantasy wouldn't 
quit. "The best thing that ever happened to me was when I got thrown out
 of the first band I was in, and I went home and put on 'It's all Over 
Now' by the Rolling Stones and learned that guitar solo.<br>
<br>
"I think when I first started, I wouldn't allow myself to think that 
someday . . . I just wanted to get in a halfway band, be able to play 
weekends somewhere and make a little extra dough, working at some job 
during the week or something. Which is what my parents used to say I 
could do. That was allowed. I could do weekends, but it was impossible 
to see or think at the time."<br>
<br>
Then it was bars and CYOs and clubs, in and out of various bands, 
playing, copping licks, going to the Village on Saturdays to catch 
matinee sets at the Café Wha.<br>
<br>
"I don't even remember being introduced to Bruce," says Miami Steve Van 
Zandt, who lived nearby and shared local guitar honors. "I just remember
 I would go to New York, the Village, and one day seeing him come 
walking down MacDougal. We looked at each other like, ah, 'You look 
familiar' and 'What are you doin' here?' It took a long time to become 
really close." Stints in bands called the Castiles, Steel Mill, Dr. Zoom
 and the Sonic Boom followed. And then there was Bruce Springsteen, 
leader of a band bearing his name.<br>
<br>
He signed a management deal with a feisty entrepreneur named Mike Appel 
on the hood of a car in a dark parking lot. It was a signature that 
meant Springsteen and band would not make any serious money until the 
1978 tour for Darkness on the Edge of Town, his fourth album. "People 
always say, 'Gee, it must have been tough for you.' But I always 
remember bein' in a good mood, bein' happy even though the bad stuff and
 the disappointments, because I knew I was ahead of nine out of ten 
other people I've seen around. 'Cause I was doing something I liked." 
Appel did get Bruce face to face with Columbia Records A&amp;R head John
 Hammond. Bruce signed on with Columbia Records. After Jon Landau saw 
him perform at Harvard Square Theater in 1974, Landau declared, in a 
review that was a landmark in both men's lives, that Bruce represented 
"rock &amp; roll future." They became friends and Springsteen asked 
Landau to come into the studio to help him and Appel produce Born to 
Run. Released in late 1975, it quickly went gold.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is happy in the front seat of anything, and he spends the 
ride from Rochester to Buffalo, New York, gazing at the sunny, 
snow-covered fields on either side of the highway. Arriving at the 
hotel, he tucks his cap under his sweat shirt's hood and invites me for a
 walk downtown in the "fresh [twenty-two degrees] air." In high boots 
and a well-broken-in black cloth coat, he looks like a grave digger off 
for the winter. He has poured over the local record store's entire 
cassette case (choosing collections by the Drifters and Gene Pitney) 
before the guys who work there recognize him. (The cassette I'd found in
 Bruce's portable player was Toots and the Maytals' Funky Kingston. 
Bruce confesses a love for reggae, a music he calls "too complex and too
 pure" for him to interpret.)<br>
<br>
The guys behind the counter put on "Hungry Heart," which has plowed 
through the charts to Number One. It was a song Bruce originally didn't 
even want to have on the album until Jon Landau (now his manager) 
insisted. Bruce describes the song as an evocation of what the Beach 
Boys and Frankie Lymon used to do for him.<br>
<br>
Still gimpy from a stumble he'd taken during a show in Washington, he 
walks on incognito until some jewelry-stand sales girl corners him for 
autographs in a bookstore.<br>
<br>
We cross the street to McDonald's. "Paradise," he calls it. "I never did
 get comfortable with places that got the menu in the window," he 
explains, making two Quarter-Pounders disappear. He looks contentedly 
around as the munching Buffalonians make no sign of recognizing him. "I 
love coming to these places where it's nothing but real."<br>
<br>
Springsteen works hard at keeping his own life real. His mother is still
 doing the kind of secretarial work she began at age eighteen, and he 
predicted that his new money would not make any difference. "What's she 
gonna do -quit and run around the world and buy things? In a certain 
way, the money aspect of it is not very useful to them. I gave 'em money
 one day and found out later they didn't spend it. They thought that was
 gonna be the payoff, you know, there wasn't gonna be anymore. They live
 around people like them [in San Diego]. The whole thing of driving your
 folks up to some big house and saying, 'This is yours,' they don't want
 that. Then it's not them anymore."<br>
<br>
Bruce himself still lives in a rented house near his hometown, with 
enough acreage to lure him into tearing about on his three-wheel, 
off-the-road scooter (though he gave his right leg a severe muscle tear 
by driving it into a tree last spring). Yet, his life at home tends 
toward more quiet activity, like staying up all might watching late 
movies often with his California-based actress girlfriend, Joyce Heiser.<br>
<br>
Heiser, to whom Bruce frequently dedicates "Drive All Night," has been 
subjected to backstage scrutiny this time around because one theme that 
takes up a lot of room on The River is marriage and relationships -- the
 ties that bind. "That's the hardest thing for me to talk about. I don't
 know, I'm in the dark as far as all that stuff goes. It took me five 
albums to even write about it. People want to get involved, not because 
of the social pressure, not because of the romantic movies that they 
grew on. It's something more basic than that, it's very physical and it 
presents itself. It's just the way men and women are.<br>
<br>
"My mother and father, they've got a very deep love because they know 
and understand each other in a very realistic way. Whatever form 
relationships take is up to the people involved, I guess. But on the 
album the characters are wrestling with those questions -- the guy in 
'Stolen Car,' the guy in 'Sherry Darling,' even. It is a puzzle and a 
question, it's hard to separate it from all the impressions that are 
created in you as you grow older. That's why I wanted 'I Wanna Marry 
You' and 'The River' together, 'cause they're similar songs, similar 
feelings.<br>
<br>
"Everybody seems to hunger for that relationship, and you never seem 
happy without it. I guess that's good enough reason right there. It just
 got to a point where all of a sudden these songs about things of that 
nature started coming out. I think you do tend to think about that 
particular thing around thirty. But even until then, when I was writing 
all the earlier songs, 'Born To Run' and stuff, they never seemed right 
without the girl. It was just part of wherever that person was going. It
 wasn't gonna be any good without her."<br>
<br>
The night after John Lennon's murder, Springsteen was scheduled to play 
Philadelphia's Spectrum Arena. The band had been onstage at the Spectrum
 the previous night when the news came, but as organist Danny Federici 
put it, "They saved it from us until after the show." The next day Miami
 Steve called the tour manager to see if the second night was supposed 
to be postponed. The answer was no. Steve was so upset he went to 
Springsteen shortly before the show saying that, "I felt really weird 
about going onstage, that I couldn't put it together. And he really just
 reminded of why we do what we do, and how important it was to go out 
that night in particular. I wish I could remember exactly what he said, 
like 'This is what John Lennon inspired us to do and now it's our job to
 do the same thing for these other people, that today it was Lennon and 
tomorrow it might be me, and if it is . . .' That's how he does his 
show, like it was his last. He lives every minute like it was his last. 
That's the way to live. It's really lucky to be close to him at moments 
like that."<br>
<br>
The band took the stage, most of them wearing black. Springsteen went to
 the mike. "If it wasn't for John Lennon," he said, "a lot of us would 
be in some place much different tonight. It's a hard world that makes 
you live with a lot of things that are unlivable. And it's hard to come 
out here and play tonight, but there's nothing else to do."<br>
<br>
I've seen people digging firebreaks to save their homes, and I've seen 
some desperate fist fights, and God knows, I've seen hundreds of rock 
&amp; roll shows, but I have never seen a human being exert himself the 
way Springsteen did that night in Philly. His delivery of the last verse
 of "Darkness on the Edge of Town" was raw with a mixture of anger, 
grief and determination. I'll remember "Promised Land" for the way the 
silhouettes in the top tier of the 18,500-seat arena were standing, 
striking the air with their fists. The crowd sang the refrain of 
"Thunder Road" so hard you could feel your sternum hum. "I've heard 
these songs a million fucking times," Miami would say the next day, "and
 it was like I never heard 'em before. I've watched him write, months 
and months of digging, but last night was a weird feeling -- like you 
were in exactly the same place he was when he wrote them."<br>
<br>
Springsteen works from the gut. There seem to be no planks of his 
ideology that are not nailed down by some hard-core, practical fact of 
life. There have long been hints that this lover of automobiles doesn't 
like the big oil companies; for the B-side of "Hungry Heart" he chose 
"Held up Without a Gun," which is partly about gas prices.<br>
<br>
Yet many people were surprised when he made his passionate but furtive 
ideology explicit by joining the lineup for the "No Nukes" concerts at 
Madison Square Garden. While in Los Angeles in mid-1979, Bruce went to a
 Jackson Browne concert. Afterward, the MUSE people had a question for 
him. "They said they needed some help in New York City," he recalls, 
"and they asked, did we want to help out?"<br>
<br>
His manner as he considers the politics of helping out, is not easy. 
There seems to be a heavy, slow beat somewhere in his innards before 
every word he speaks. "There's too much greed, too much carelessness. I 
don't believe that was ever the idea of capitalism. It's just gotta be 
voices heard from all places, that's my main concern, and when you're up
 against big business and politics, you gotta have some muscle.<br>
<br>
"People every day in different ways try to talk to people out there. 
Especially during the elections, they try to appeal to people's secret 
hearts, you know, with the American dream -- really it's the human 
dream, and everybody knows by now that it ain't about two cars in the 
garage. It's about people living and working together without steppin' 
on each other.<br>
<br>
"There's a cruel and cynical game that goes on," he continues, letting 
his hands fall open, as if they could catch hold of whatever is bugging 
him so deeply. "A game that people with responsibility play with these 
immense hopes and desires. It's disgusting the disrespect those people 
with responsibility can have. Like TV. You wonder what's going on in 
this [NBC-TV chief] Freddy Silverman's head sometimes, like how can he 
do that? There's some good things on TV, but way too much of it is used 
to zonk people out.<br>
<br>
"So that cynical game goes on; it's like the 
carrot-in-front-of-the-donkey game. The cynicism of the last ten years 
is what people adopted as a necessary defense against having tire tracks
 up and down their front and back everyday."<br>
<br>
Springsteen pauses and looks across the table littered with chicken 
bones and empty soda bottles. Outside the hotel room, Lake Erie's gray 
expanse is whitening with the dawn.<br>
<br>
"That was the spirit of rock &amp; roll when it came in," he goes on, 
"talking to kids in their secret heart. To promise to somebody that 
things are gonna be all right, you don't ever have the room to do that. 
Then you're a politician. All you can do is say there's possibilities, 
some are gonna stand, some are gonna fall, and then try to say that the 
search and the struggle is a life-affirming action. Illusions make you 
weak, dreams and possibilities make you strong. That's what I hope 
people get from our music. That's what I got from the Drifters, say, 
'Under the Boardwalk.' As full as the singer sounds, it always had that 
little sadness that made you love it, made you recognize it as being 
true.<br>
<br>
"There's this movie, Wise Blood [from Flannery O'Connor's story in which
 a young religious zealot from the South blinds himself]. One of my 
favorite parts was the end, where he's doin' all these terrible things 
to himself; and the woman comes in and says, 'There's no reason for it. 
People have quit doing it.' And he says, 'They ain't quit doing it as 
long as I'm doing it.'<br>
<br>
"There's this thing that gets conjured up at night. In fact, to me it's 
different every night. I was always close to work. I found out very 
young what makes me happy. I stay very close to that. It just seemed 
like the secret of the world."</div>

THE  NEW  YORKER<br>
<br>
July 20, 2012</strong><br>
<br>
Nearly half a century ago, when Elvis Presley was filming “Harum Scarum”
 and “Help!” was on the charts, a moody, father-haunted, yet uncannily 
charismatic Shore rat named Bruce Springsteen was building a small 
reputation around central Jersey as a guitar player in a band called the
 Castiles. <br>
<br>
The band was named for the lead singer’s favorite brand of soap. Its 
members were from Freehold, an industrial town half an hour inland from 
the boardwalk carnies and the sea. The Castiles performed at sweet 
sixteens and Elks-club dances, at drive-in movie theatres and ShopRite 
ribbon cuttings, at a mobile-home park in Farmingdale, at the 
Matawan-Keyport Rollerdrome. Once, they played for the patients at a 
psychiatric hospital, in Marlboro. A gentleman dressed in a suit came to
 the stage and, in an introductory speech that ran some twenty minutes, 
declared the Castiles “greater than the Beatles.” At which point a 
doctor intervened and escorted him back to his room.<br>
<br>
One spring afternoon in 1966, the Castiles, with dreams of making it big
 and making it quick, drove to a studio at the Brick Mall Shopping 
Center and recorded two original songs, “Baby I” and “That’s What You 
Get.” Mainly, though, they played an array of covers, from Glenn 
Miller’s “In the Mood” to the G-Clefs’ “I Understand.” They did Sonny 
and Cher, Sam and Dave, Don &amp; Juan, the Who, the Kinks, the Stones, 
the Animals.<br>
<br>
Many musicians in their grizzled late maturity have an uncertain grasp 
on their earliest days on the bandstand. (Not a few have an uncertain 
grasp on last week.) But Springsteen, who is sixty-two and among the 
most durable musicians since B. B. King and Om Kalthoum, seems to 
remember every gaudy night, from the moment, in 1957, when he and his 
mother watched Elvis on “The Ed Sullivan Show”—“I looked at her and I 
said, ‘I wanna be just . . . like . . . that’ ”—to his most recent 
exploits as a multimillionaire populist rock star crowd-surfing the 
adoring masses. <br>
<br>
These days, he is the subject of historical exhibitions; at the Rock and
 Roll Hall of Fame Museum, in Cleveland, and at the National 
Constitution Center, in Philadelphia, his lyric sheets, old cars, and 
faded performing duds have been displayed like the snippets of the 
Shroud. But, unlike the Rolling Stones, say, who have not written a 
great song since the disco era and come together only to pad their 
fortunes as their own cover band, Springsteen refuses to be a mercenary 
curator of his past. He continues to evolve as an artist, filling one 
spiral notebook after another with ideas, quotations, questions, 
clippings, and, ultimately, new songs. His latest album, “Wrecking 
Ball,” is a melodic indictment of the recessionary moment, of income 
disparity, emasculated workers, and what he calls “the distance between 
the American reality and the American dream.” The work is remote from 
his early operettas of humid summer interludes and abandon out on the 
Turnpike. In his desire to extend a counter-tradition of political 
progressivism, Springsteen quotes from Irish rebel songs, Dust Bowl 
ballads, Civil War tunes, and chain-gang chants.<br>
<br>
Early this year, Springsteen was leading rehearsals for a world tour at 
Fort Monmouth, an Army base that was shut down last year; it had been an
 outpost since the First World War of military communications and 
intelligence, and once employed Julius Rosenberg and thousands of 
militarized carrier pigeons. The twelve-hundred-acre property is now a 
ghost town inhabited only by steel dummies meant to scare off the 
ubiquitous Canada geese that squirt a carpet of green across middle 
Jersey. Driving to the far end of the base, I reached an unlovely 
theatre that Springsteen and Jon Landau, his longtime manager, had 
rented for the rehearsals. Springsteen had performed for officers’ 
children at the Fort Monmouth “teen club” (dancing, no liquor) with the 
Castiles, forty-seven years earlier.<br>
<br>
The atmosphere inside was purposeful but easygoing. Musicians stood 
onstage noodling on their instruments with the languid air of 
outfielders warming up in the sun. Max Weinberg, the band’s volcanic 
drummer, wore the sort of generous jeans favored by dads at weekend 
barbecues. Steve Van Zandt, Springsteen’s childhood friend and 
guitarist-wingman, keeps up a brutal schedule as an actor and a d.j., 
and he seemed weary, his eyes drooping under a piratical purple head 
scarf. The bass player Garry Tallent, the organist Charlie Giordano, and
 the pianist Roy Bittan horsed around on a roller-rink tune while they 
waited. The guitarist Nils Lofgren was on the phone, trying to figure 
out flights to get back to his home, in Scottsdale, for the weekend.<br>
<br>
Springsteen arrived and greeted everyone with a quick hello and his 
distinctive cackle. He is five-nine and walks with a rolling rodeo gait.
 When he takes in something new—a visitor, a thought, a passing car in 
the distance—his eyes narrow, as if in hard light, and his lower jaw 
protrudes a bit. His hairline is receding, and, if one had to guess, he 
has, over the years, in the face of high-def scrutiny and the fight 
against time, enjoined the expensive attentions of cosmetic and dental 
practitioners. He remains dispiritingly handsome, preposterously fit. 
(“He has practically the same waist size as when I met him, when we were
 fifteen,” says Steve Van Zandt, who does not.) Some of this has to do 
with his abstemious inclinations; Van Zandt says Springsteen is “the 
only guy I know—I think the only guy I know at all—who never did drugs.”
 He’s followed more or less the same exercise regimen for thirty years: 
he runs on a treadmill and, with a trainer, works out with weights. It 
has paid off. His muscle tone approximates a fresh tennis ball. And yet,
 with the tour a month away, he laughed at the idea that he was ready. 
“I’m not remotely close,” he said, slumping into a chair twenty rows 
back from the stage.<br>
<br>
Preparing for a tour is a process far more involved than middle-aged 
workouts designed to stave off premature infarction. “Think of it this 
way: performing is like sprinting while screaming for three, four 
minutes,” Springsteen said. “And then you do it again. And then you do 
it again. And then you walk a little, shouting the whole time. And so 
on. Your adrenaline quickly overwhelms your conditioning.” His style in 
performance is joyously demonic, as close as a white man of Social 
Security age can get to James Brown circa 1962 without risking a 
herniated disk or a shattered pelvis. Concerts last in excess of three 
hours, without a break, and he is constantly dancing, screaming, 
imploring, mugging, kicking, windmilling, crowd-surfing, climbing a drum
 riser, jumping on an amp, leaping off Roy Bittan’s piano. The display 
of energy and its depletion is part of what is expected of him. In 
return, the crowd participates in a display of communal adoration. Like 
pilgrims at a gigantic outdoor Mass—think John Paul II at Gdansk—they 
know their role: when to raise their hands, when to sway, when to sing, 
when to scream his name, when to bear his body, hand over hand, from the
 rear of the orchestra to the stage. (Van Zandt: “Messianic? Is that the
 word you’re looking for?”)<br>
<br>
Springsteen came to glory in the age of Letterman, but he is 
anti-ironical. Keith Richards works at seeming not to give a shit. He 
makes you wonder if it is harder to play the riffs for “Street Fighting 
Man” or to dangle a cigarette from his lips by a single thread of spit. 
Springsteen is the opposite. He is all about flagrant exertion. There 
always comes a moment in a Springsteen concert, as there always did with
 James Brown, when he plays out a dumb show of the conflict between 
exhaustion and the urge to go on. Brown enacted it by dropping to his 
knees, awash in sweat, unable to dance another step, yet shooing away 
his cape bearer, the aide who would enrobe him and hustle him offstage. 
Springsteen slumps against the mike stand, spent and still, then, 
regaining consciousness, shakes off the sweat—No! It can’t be!—and calls
 on the band for another verse, another song. He leaves the stage 
soaked, as if he had swum around the arena in his clothes while being 
chased by barracudas. “I want an extreme experience,” he says. He wants 
his audience to leave the arena, as <br>
<br>
<br>
he commands them, “with your hands hurting, your feet hurting, your back
 hurting, your voice sore, and your sexual organs stimulated!”<br>
<br>
So the display of exuberance is critical. “For an adult, the world is 
constantly trying to clamp down on itself,” he says. “Routine, 
responsibility, decay of institutions, corruption: this is all the world
 closing in. Music, when it’s really great, pries that shit back open 
and lets people back in, it lets light in, and air in, and energy in, 
and sends people home with that and sends me back to the hotel with it. 
People carry that with them sometimes for a very long period of time.”<br>
<br>
The band rehearses not so much to learn how to play particular songs as 
to see what songs work with other songs, to figure out a basic set list 
(with countless alternatives) that will fill all of Springsteen’s 
demands: to air the new work and his latest themes; to play the expected
 hits for the casual fans; to work up enough surprises and rarities for 
fans who have seen him hundreds of times; and, especially, to pace the 
show from frenzy to calm and back again. In the past several years, 
Springsteen has been taking requests from the crowd. He has never been 
stumped. “You can take the band out of the bar, but you can’t take the 
bar out of the band,” Van Zandt says.<br>
<br>
The E Street Band members are not Springsteen’s equals. “This is not the
 Beatles,” as Weinberg puts it. They are salaried musicians; in 1989, 
they were fired en masse. They await his call to record, to tour, to 
rehearse. And so when Springsteen sprang out of his chair and said, 
“O.K., time to work,” they straightened up and watched for his cue.<br>
<br>
Huh . . . two . . . three . . . four.<br>
<br>
As the anthemic opener, “We Take Care of Our Own,” washed over the empty
 seats, I stood at the back of the hall next to the sound engineer, John
 Cooper, a rangy, unflappable Hoosier, who was monitoring a vast 
soundboard and a series of laptops. One hard drive contains the lyrics 
and keys for hundreds of songs, so that when Springsteen calls for 
something off the cuff the song quickly appears on TelePrompters within 
sight of him and his bandmates. (The crutch is hardly unique—Sinatra, in
 late career, used a TelePrompter, and so do the Stones and many other 
bands.) Although more than half the show will be the same from night to 
night, the rest is up for grabs.<br>
<br>
“This is about the only live music left, with a few exceptions,” Cooper 
said. Lip-synchers are legion. Coldplay thickens its sound with heaps of
 pre-taped instruments and synthesizers. The one artificial sound in 
Springsteen’s act is a snare-drum sound in “We Take Care of Our Own” 
that seemed to elude easy reproduction.<br>
<br>
That afternoon at Fort Monmouth, Springsteen was intent on nailing “the 
opening four,” the first songs, which come rapid fire. The band and the 
crew gave particular attention to those lingering seconds between songs 
when the keys modulate and the guitar techs pass different instruments 
to the musicians. It is intricate work; the technicians have to move 
with the precision of a Daytona pit crew.<br>
<br>
Before the tour officially began, in Atlanta, there were a few smaller 
venues to play, including the Apollo Theatre, in Harlem. There are 
usually more African-Americans onstage than in the seats, but 
Springsteen is steeped in black music, and he was especially eager to 
play the date in Harlem. “All of our teachers stood on those boards at 
the Apollo,” he said. “The essence of the way this band moves is one of 
soul. It’s supposed to be overwhelming. You shouldn’t be able to catch 
your breath. That’s what being a front man is all about—the idea of 
having something supple underneath you, that machine that roars and can 
turn on a dime.”<br>
<br>
Rock tours generally have a theme: a band’s coltish arrival, a new style
 or look, a reunion, a new set of songs, a political moment. Springsteen
 was salting the show with the political material from “Wrecking Ball,” 
but the most vivid theme on this tour was to be time passing, age, 
death, and, if Springsteen could manage it, a sense of renewal. The 
surviving core of the band—Van Zandt, Tallent, Weinberg, Bittan, and 
Springsteen—had been playing together since the Ford Administration; 
Lofgren and Patti Scialfa, Springsteen’s wife, who is a singer and 
guitar player, joined in the eighties.<br>
<br>
The run of tragedy, debility, and erosion has seemed relentless in 
recent years. Nils Lofgren has had both hips replaced, and both his 
shoulders are a wreck. Max Weinberg has endured open-heart surgery, 
prostate-cancer treatment, two failed back operations, and seven hand 
operations. The morning after a concert, he told me, he feels like the 
Nick Nolte character in the football movie “North Dallas Forty”: bruised
 and barely able to move. Lofgren has compared the backstage area to “a 
MASH unit,” with ice packs, heating pads, Bengay tubes, and masseuses on
 call. More alarmingly, Jon Landau, Springsteen’s manager and closest 
friend, was recovering from brain surgery.<br>
<br>
There have been deeper, permanent losses. In 2008, Danny Federici, who 
played organ and accordion with Springsteen for forty years, died of 
melanoma. Springsteen’s body man on tour, a Special Forces veteran named
 Terry Magovern, died the year before. Springsteen’s trainer died at the
 age of forty.<br>
<br>
The most shocking loss came last year, when Clarence Clemons, 
Springsteen’s saxophone player and onstage foil and protector, died of a
 stroke. Clemons was a colossus—six-four, a former football player. As a
 musician, he possessed a raspy tone reminiscent of King Curtis. He was 
not a great improviser, but his solos, painstakingly scripted over long 
hours in the studio with Springsteen, were set pieces in every show. 
Then, there was his sheer stage presence. Clemons gave Springsteen a 
mythic companion who embodied the fraternal spirit of the band. 
“Standing next to Clarence was like standing next to the baddest ass on 
the planet,” Springsteen said of him in tribute. “You felt like no 
matter what the day or the night brought, nothing was going to touch 
you.”<br>
<br>
Clemons’s life style was considerably less disciplined than 
Springsteen’s, and, in recent years, his body had been breaking down, 
requiring hip replacements, knee replacements, back surgery. On the last
 tour, Clemons was driven around the arena tunnels in a golf cart. 
Onstage, he was spending less time exerting himself on the horn and more
 time resting on a stool and banging on a tambourine. When he did play, 
it was clear that he was losing the high notes. After one of his last 
concerts, he told a friend, “I deserve a God-damned Academy Award.” He 
said that he felt like Mickey Rourke’s character in “The Wrestler”; he 
was portraying a powerful figure onstage even as he was falling apart 
physically.<br>
<br>
At the funeral, held in a chapel in Palm Beach, Springsteen paid 
passionate homage to Clemons, recalling that he had put up with a “world
 where it still wasn’t so easy to be big and black.” He recalled his 
friend’s “raunchy mysticism,” his appetites, even his dressing room, 
which was draped in exotic scarves and dubbed the Temple of Soul: “A 
visit there was like a trip to a sovereign nation that had just struck 
huge oil reserves.” At the same time, Springsteen gestured toward 
Clemons’s erratic family life (he was married five times) and the 
occasional tensions in their relationship. Speaking to Clemons’s sons, 
he said, “C lived a life where he did what he wanted to do, and he let 
the chips, human and otherwise, fall where they may. Like a lot of us, 
your pop was capable of great magic and also of making quite an amazing 
mess.”<br>
<br>
Months later, Springsteen was still feeling the loss. He was twenty-two 
when he met Clemons, on the Asbury Park music circuit. Losing Clemons 
was like losing “the sea and the stars,” and it was clear that 
Springsteen was anxious about performing without him. “How do we 
continue? I think we discussed this more than anything in our history,” 
Van Zandt told me. “The basic concept was, we need to reinvent ourselves
 here a little bit. You can’t just replace a guy.” Clemons was replaced 
not by a musician but by a contingent—a five-man horn section.<br>
<br>
Rehearsals were partly a matter of figuring out how to acknowledge the 
losses without turning the concert into a lugubrious memorial service. 
“The band is a little community up there,” Springsteen said, “and it 
gathers together, and we try to heal the parts that God broke and honor 
the parts that are no longer with us.”<br>
<br>
During the breaks, I noticed that one of the horn players, a young tenor
 player wearing a considerable Afro, oblong eyewear, and an intent 
expression, was wandering around, nervously playing snatches of familiar
 solos on his horn: “Tenth Avenue Freeze Out,” “Jungleland,” “Badlands,”
 “Thunder Road.” This was Jake Clemons, Clarence’s thirty-two-year-old 
nephew. For years, Jake had been touring second-rate halls and clubs 
with his own band. Now he had the assignment of filling his uncle’s 
shoes in front of audiences of fifty thousand. He would do so literally.
 Jake wore his uncle’s size-16 shoes—snakeskin boots, slick loafers, 
whatever was left to him. Nearly all of his horns, too, had been gifts 
from Uncle Clarence.<br>
<br>
In January, Springsteen invited Jake to his house, and they played long 
into the night. Bruce introduced the idea of his joining the band. “But 
you have to understand,” Springsteen told him. “When you blow that sax 
onstage with us, people won’t compare you to Clarence on the last tour. 
They’ll compare you to their memory of Clarence, to their idea of 
Clarence.” That gave Jake Clemons pause. Raised on gospel in a family 
led by a Marine-band officer, he knew Springsteen’s catalogue only 
casually. The audience would know the songs, not to mention the history 
of the band, much more intimately than he did. After Clarence died, Jake
 did a few tribute shows, and he could sense the audience making 
comparisons.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know if anyone can perform in the shadow of a legend,” Jake 
said. “To me, Clarence is still on that stage, and I don’t want to step 
on his toes.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen believed that these worries, and the larger sense of loss 
and injury, might provide an energy that the tour could draw on. After 
all these years onstage, he can stand back from his performances with an
 analytic remove. “You’re the shaman, a little bit, you’re leading the 
congregation,” he told me. “But you are the same as everybody else in 
the sense that your troubles are the same, your problems are the same, 
you’ve got your blessings, you’ve got your sins, you’ve got the things 
you can do well, you’ve got the things you fuck up all the time. And so 
you’re a conduit. There was a series of elements in your life—some that 
were blessings, and some that were just chaotic curses—that set fire to 
you in a certain way.”<br>
<br>
When Springsteen was touring behind the “Born to Run” album, in the 
mid-seventies, he would stand at the lip of the stage in a spotlight, 
vamping on a chord, and tell the story of growing up in a dingy 
two-family house next to a gas station in a working-class section of 
Freehold known as Texas, because it was first populated by hillbilly 
migrants from the South. I was in the balcony at a show, in November, 
1976, at the Palladium, on Fourteenth Street, when Springsteen laid 
things out in the starkest terms:<br>
<br>
<br>
My mom, she was a secretary, and she worked downtown. . . . And my 
father, he worked a lot of different places. He worked in a rug mill for
 a while, he drove a cab for a while, and he was a guard down at the 
jail for a while. I can remember when he worked down there, he used to 
always come home real pissed off, drunk, sit in the kitchen. At night, 
nine o’clock, he used to shut off all the lights, every light in the 
house, and he used to get real pissed off if me or my sister turned any 
of them on. And he’d sit in the kitchen with a six-pack, a cigarette. . .
 .<br>
<br>
He’d make me sit down at that table in the dark. In the wintertime, he 
used to turn on the gas stove and close all the doors, so it got real 
hot in there. And I remember just sitting in the dark. . . . No matter 
how long I sat there, I could never ever see his face. We’d start 
talking about nothing much, how I was doing. Pretty soon, he asked me 
what I thought I was doing with myself. And we’d always end up screaming
 at each other. My mother, she’d always end up running in from the front
 room crying, and trying to pull him off me, try to keep us from 
fighting with each other. . . . I’d always end up running out the back 
door and pulling away from him. Pulling away from him, running down the 
driveway screaming at him, telling him, telling him, telling him, how it
 was my life and I was going to do what I wanted to do.<br>
<br>
<br>
At the end of the story, an entirely accurate one, Springsteen would 
segue into “It’s My Life,” by the Animals, a spine-jangling declaration 
of independence. In Springsteen’s voice, it was a declaration of 
independence from a household in which threats were shouted, telephones 
were ripped off the wall, and the police were summoned.<br>
<br>
Doug Springsteen was an Army driver in Europe during the Second World 
War who came home and seethed at his crabbed circumstances. Van Zandt 
told me that Springsteen’s father was “scary” and best avoided. In those
 days, “all fathers were scary,” Van Zandt said. “The torture we put 
these poor guys through, when you think of it now. My father, Bruce’s 
father—these poor guys, they never had a chance. There was no precedent 
for us, none, in history, for their sons to become these long-haired 
freaks who didn’t want to participate in the world they built for them. 
Can you imagine? It was the World War Two generation. They built the 
suburbs. What gratitude did we have? We’re, like, ‘Fuck you! We’re gonna
 look like girls, and we’re gonna do drugs, and we’re gonna play crazy 
rock and roll!’ And they’re, like, ‘What the fuck did we do wrong?’ They
 were scared of what we were becoming, so they felt they had to be more 
authoritarian. They hated us, you know?”<br>
<br>
Doug Springsteen grew up shadowed by the death of his five-year-old 
sister, Virginia, who was hit by a truck while riding a tricycle, in 
Freehold in 1927. His parents, according to a forthcoming biography of 
Springsteen by Peter Ames Carlin, were ravaged by grief. Doug dropped 
out of school after ninth grade. In 1948, he married Adele Zerilli. 
Bruce was born the next year. For long stretches of Bruce’s childhood, 
his grandparents lived with his family, and, as Springsteen told Carlin,
 he always sensed that much of the affection he received from them was a
 way “to replace the lost child,” which was confusing: “The dead 
daughter was a big presence. Her portrait was on the wall, always front 
and center.” Decades after the event, the whole family––the 
grandparents, Doug and Adele, Bruce and his sister Ginny––went to the 
cemetery every weekend to visit Virginia’s grave.<br>
<br>
In biographies and clippings, Doug Springsteen is described with 
adjectives like “taciturn” and “disappointed.” In fact, he seems to have
 been bipolar, and he was capable of terrible rages, often aimed at his 
son. Doctors prescribed drugs for his illness, but Doug didn’t always 
take them. The mediator in the house, the source of optimism and 
survival, and the steadiest earner, was Bruce’s mother, Adele, who 
worked as a legal secretary. Still, Bruce was deeply affected by his 
father’s paralyzing depressions, and worried that he would not escape 
the thread of mental instability that ran through his family. That fear,
 he says, is why he never did drugs. Doug Springsteen lives in his son’s
 songs. In “Independence Day,” the son must escape his father’s house 
because “we were just too much of the same kind.” In the ferocious “Adam
 Raised a Cain,” the father “walks these empty rooms / looking for 
something to blame / You inherit the sins / You inherit the flames.” The
 songs were a way of talking to the silent father. “My dad was very 
nonverbal—you couldn’t really have a conversation with him,” Springsteen
 told me. “I had to make my peace with that, but I had to have a 
conversation with him, because I needed to have one. It ain’t the best 
way to go about it, but that was the only way I could, so I did, and 
eventually he did respond. He might not have liked the songs, but I 
think he liked that they existed. It meant that he mattered. He’d get 
asked, ‘What are your favorite songs?’ And he’d say, ‘The ones that are 
about me.’ ”<br>
<br>
The past, though, is anything but past. “My parents’ struggles, it’s the
 subject of my life,” Springsteen told me at rehearsal. “It’s the thing 
that eats at me and always will. My life took a very different course, 
but my life is an anomaly. Those wounds stay with you, and you turn them
 into a language and a purpose.” Gesturing toward the band onstage, he 
said, “We’re repairmen—repairmen with a toolbox. If I repair a little of
 myself, I’ll repair a little of you. That’s the job.” The songs of 
escape on “Born to Run,” the portrait of post-industrial struggle on 
“Darkness on the Edge of Town” were part of that job of early repair.<br>
<br>
Doug and Adele Springsteen left Freehold for northern California when 
Bruce was nineteen, and they were puzzled when, several years later, 
their son, a long-haired misfit in their eyes, came visiting, as he puts
 it, “lugging a treasure chest behind” and telling them to buy the 
biggest house around. “The one satisfaction you get is that you do get 
your ‘See, I told you so’ moment,” Springsteen said. “Of course, all the
 deeper things go unsaid, that it all could have been a little 
different.”<br>
<br>
Doug Springsteen died in 1998, at seventy-three, after years of illness,
 including a stroke and heart disease. “I was lucky that modern medicine
 gave him another ten years of life,” Springsteen said. “T-Bone Burnett 
said that rock and roll is all about ‘Daaaaddy!’ It’s one embarrassing 
scream of ‘Daaaaddy!’ It’s just fathers and sons, and you’re out there 
proving something to somebody in the most intense way possible. It’s, 
like, ‘Hey, I was worth a little more attention than I got! You blew 
that one, big guy!’ ”<br>
<br>
The redemptive moments in Springsteen’s youth were musical: the songs 
coming out of the transistor radio and the television set; his mother 
taking out a bank loan for sixty dollars to buy him a Kent guitar when 
he was fifteen. Springsteen became one of those kids who escape into an 
obsession. He believed, as he sings in “No Surrender,” “We learned more 
from a three-minute record, baby, than we ever learned in school.” At 
St. Rose of Lima, the Catholic school in Freehold, he was a screwup, 
disdained by the nuns. The hip, literary kids were far away. (“I didn’t 
hang around with no crowd that was talking about William Burroughs,” he 
told Dave Marsh, an early biographer.) After graduating from high 
school, Springsteen attended classes at Ocean County Community College, 
where he started reading novels and writing poems, but he quit after a 
nervous administrator, on the lookout for hippies and other 
undesirables, made it plain to Springsteen that there had been 
“complaints” that he was strange. “Remember, we didn’t go into this life
 because we were courageous or brilliant,” Van Zandt said. “We were the 
last guys standing. Anyone with a choice to do something else—be a 
dentist, get a real job, whatever—took it!”<br>
<br>
The place where Springsteen went looking for his future was just a short
 drive east of Freehold—the Asbury Park music scene. In the sixties and 
seventies, there were dozens of bands that played in the bars along the 
boardwalk. Asbury Park became Springsteen’s Liverpool, his Tupelo, his 
Hibbing.<br>
<br>
On a spring afternoon, I stood out in front of the best-known club in 
Asbury Park, the Stone Pony, and waited for an aging drummer named Vini 
(Mad Dog) Lopez, the unluckiest man in the E Street saga. Lopez was 
thrown out of the Springsteen band just before they hit it big. 
Springsteen’s bandmates may be employees, but they have been handsomely 
paid and are worth many millions of dollars each. The drummer who made 
it for the long haul, Max Weinberg, owns houses in the New Jersey 
countryside and Tuscany. Lopez works as a caddy. On weekends, he plays 
in a band called License to Chill. The band’s mascot is Tippy the 
Banana. “We’re at the bottom of the food chain,” Lopez told me. “We like
 to say that we’re exclusive but inexpensive.”<br>
<br>
Lopez pulled up to the Pony in a beat-up Saturn. He climbed out of the 
car creakily, as if out of a space capsule after an interplanetary 
voyage. He squinted in the ocean light and limped toward me. He’d been 
in a car wreck on the way home from a memorial concert for Clarence 
Clemons. His knee was shot, and so was his back. Also, someone had 
dropped an amplifier on his foot at a gig a couple of nights before. 
“That didn’t help,” he said.<br>
<br>
We walked along the boardwalk for a while and settled on a place to eat.
 On the way, and throughout lunch, people stopped him to say hello, to 
get an autograph.<br>
<br>
In 1969, Lopez invited Springsteen to jam at an after-hours loft, called
 the Upstage, above a Thom McAn shoe store in Asbury Park. Eventually, 
Springsteen and Lopez formed a band called Child, which they soon 
renamed Steel Mill. It featured Lopez on drums, Danny Federici on organ 
and accordion, and Steve Van Zandt on bass. The boys lived for a while 
in a surfboard factory run by their manager. “Bruce lived in the front 
office, and Danny and I had daybeds in the bathrooms,” Lopez said. They 
made around fifty dollars a week. Some of the band members held manual 
jobs to make ends meet: Van Zandt worked construction, Lopez put in time
 at a boatyard and on commercial fishing boats. Springsteen declined. 
The future working-class clarion never really worked.<br>
<br>
Lopez took a long sip of his Bloody Mary and stared out at the ocean, 
where a surfer bobbed on a wave and fell. Springsteen still throws some 
extra royalties his way from the first two albums—“He does it out of the
 goodness of his heart,” Lopez said—but it’s not a living.<br>
<br>
The Springsteen Lopez describes was a young man of uncommon ambition who
 was also prone to bouts of withdrawal. For all the girls around, for 
all the late-night Monopoly games and pinball marathons, Springsteen 
wasn’t easily distracted. “Bruce would come to a party where people were
 doing all kinds of things, and he would just go off with his guitar,” 
Lopez said.<br>
<br>
For Van Zandt, that intensity was a lure. He recognized in Springsteen a
 drive to create original work. In those days, he said, you were judged 
by how well you could copy songs off the radio and play them, chord for 
chord, note for note: “Bruce was never good at it. He had a weird ear. 
He would hear different chords, but he could never hear the right 
chords. When you have that ability or inability, you immediately become 
more original. Well, in the long run, guess what: in the long run, 
original wins.”<br>
<br>
Asbury Park, for all its brassy bar bands and boardwalk barkers, was not
 immune to the times. On the July 4th weekend in 1970, race riots broke 
out. Young blacks in town were especially angry that most of the summer 
jobs in the restaurants and stores along the boardwalk were going to 
white kids. Springsteen and his bandmates watched the flames on 
Springwood Avenue from a water tower near their surfboard-factory home. 
Nevertheless, Bruce’s crowd remained almost completely apolitical. “The 
riots just meant that certain clubs didn’t open and certain ones did,” 
Van Zandt said.<br>
<br>
As Steel Mill dissolved, Springsteen dreamed up a temporary lark: Dr. 
Zoom and the Sonic Boom, a kind of Noah’s-ark carnival act, with two of 
everything—guitarists, drummers, singers—plus Garry Tallent on tuba, a 
baton twirler, and two guys from the Upstage who played Monopoly 
onstage. Then Springsteen got serious. He formed his own band. He called
 it the Bruce Springsteen Band.<br>
<br>
A week after closing down rehearsals at Fort Monmouth, Springsteen and 
the band start rehearsing at the Sun National Bank Center, the home of 
the Trenton Titans, a minor-league hockey team. The theatre at Fort 
Monmouth was secluded and cheap, but not nearly large enough for the 
crew to set up the full travelling stage, with all the proper lights, 
risers, ramps, and sound system.<br>
<br>
Inside the arena, Springsteen is walking around the empty seats, a 
microphone in his hand, giving stage directions. “We can’t see the 
singers from this angle,” he says. “One step to the right, Cindy!” The 
crew moves the riser. Cindy Mizelle, the most soulful voice in the new, 
seventeen-piece version of the E Street Band, takes one step to the 
right.<br>
<br>
Springsteen lopes to another corner, and, as he sets his gaze on the 
horn section, a thought occurs to him. “Do we have some chairs for those
 guys when they aren’t playing?” he says. His voice ricochets around the
 empty seats. Chairs appear.<br>
<br>
The band gets in position and starts to rip through the basic set list 
in preparation for the Apollo show. Lofgren plays the slippery opening 
riff of “We Take Care of Our Own”—a recession anthem in the key of G—and
 the band is off. Springsteen rehearses deliberately, working out all 
the spontaneous-seeming moves and postures: the solemn lowered head and 
raised fist, the hoisted talismanic Fender, the between-songs patter, 
the look of exultation in a single spotlight that he will enact in front
 of an audience. (“It’s theatre, you know,” he tells me later. “I’m a 
theatrical performer. I’m whispering in your ear, and you’re dreaming my
 dreams, and then I’m getting a feeling for yours. I’ve been doing that 
for forty years.”) Springsteen has to do so much—lead the band, pace the
 show, sing, play guitar, command the audience, project to every corner 
of the hall, including the seats behind the stage—that to wing it 
completely is asking for disaster.<br>
<br>
In the midst of the fifth song in the set, he introduces the band. As 
they run through a vamp of “People Get Ready,” the old Curtis Mayfield 
tune, Springsteen grabs a mike and strolls across the stage. “Good 
evening, ladies and gentlemen,” he says to the empty arena. “I’m so glad
 to be here in your beautiful city tonight. The E Street Band has come 
back to bring the power, hour after hour, to put a whup-ass session on 
the recession. We got some old friends, and we got some new friends, and
 we’ve got a story to tell you . . .”<br>
<br>
The tune, thick with horns and vocal harmonies, elides into “My City of 
Ruins,” one of the elegiac, gospel-tinged songs on the 9/11 album, “The 
Rising.” The voices sing “Rise up! Rise up!” and there comes a string of
 horn solos: trombone, trumpet, sax. Then back to the voices. 
Springsteen quickly introduces the E Street horns and the singing 
collective. Then he says, “Roll call!” And, with the music rising bit by
 churchly bit, he introduces the core of the band: “Professor Roy Bittan
 is in the house. . . . Charlie Giordano is in the house. . . .”<br>
<br>
When he finishes the roll call, there is a long ellipsis. The band keeps vamping.<br>
<br>
“Are we missing anybody?”<br>
<br>
Two spotlights are now trained on the organ, where Federici once sat, and at the mike where Clemons once stood.<br>
<br>
“Are we missing anybody?”<br>
<br>
Then again: “Are we missing anybody? . . . That’s right. That’s right. 
We’re missing some. But the only thing I can guarantee tonight is that 
if you’re here and we’re here, then they’re here!” He repeats this over 
and over, the volume of the piano and the bass rising, the drums 
hastening, the voices rising, until finally the song overwhelms him, 
and, if Springsteen has calculated correctly, there will not be an 
unmoved soul in the house.<br>
<br>
For the next hour and a half, the band plays through a set that 
alternates tales of economic pain with party-time escape. While the band
 plays the jolly opening riff of “Waiting on a Sunny Day,” Springsteen 
practices striding around the stage, beckoning the imaginary hordes 
everywhere in the arena to sing along. There is a swagger in his stride.
 He is the rare man of sixty-two who is not shy about showing his ass—an
 ass finely sausaged into a pair of alarmingly tight black jeans—to 
twenty thousand paying customers. “Go, Jakie!” he cries, and brings Jake
 Clemons downstage to solo. He practically has to kick him into the 
spotlight.<br>
<br>
A bunch of songs later, after a run-through of the set-ending “Thunder 
Road,” Springsteen hops off the stage, drapes a towel around his neck, 
and sits down in the folding chair next to me.<br>
<br>
“The top of the show, see, is a kind of welcoming, and you are getting 
everyone comfortable and challenging them at the same time,” he says. 
“You’re setting out your themes. You’re getting them comfortable, 
because, remember, people haven’t seen this band. There are absences 
that are hanging there. That’s what we’re about right now, the 
communication between the living and the gone. Those currents even run 
through the dream world of pop music!”<br>
<br>
It’s a sweet day for Springsteen. “Wrecking Ball” is the No. 1 album in 
the U.S. and in the United Kingdom, passing Adele’s blockbuster “21.” 
“This is great news, but we’ll see where we are in a few weeks,” Landau 
says. Springsteen will never again have huge sellers like “Born in the 
U.S.A.,” but he will always get an initial burst of sales from his fan 
base. How sales sustain over time is the question. (The answer is that 
they don’t: after a month, “Wrecking Ball” dropped to No. 19. By summer,
 it had fallen off the charts.) What makes Springsteen an economic power
 at this point is his status as a live performer.<br>
<br>
Onstage, an impromptu party is forming. The crew passes out flutes of 
champagne and plates of cake to celebrate the news about “Wrecking 
Ball.”<br>
<br>
“That never gets old,” Springsteen says, before heading off to join the 
party. “I’m still excited hearing the music on the radio! I remember the
 first time I ever saw someone hearing me on the radio. We were in 
Connecticut playing at some college. A guy was in his car, a warm summer
 night, and his window was rolled down, and ‘Spirit in the Night’ ”—a 
song from Springsteen’s début album—“was coming out of the car. Wow. I 
remember thinking, That’s it, I’ve realized at least a part of my 
rock-and-roll dreams. It still feels the same to me. To hear it come out
 of the radio—it’s an all-points bulletin. The song’s going out . . . 
there!”<br>
<br>
By 1972, Springsteen was fronting a band and writing songs to be 
performed solo. He wasn’t a big reader at the time, but he was so 
consumed by Bob Dylan’s songs that he read Anthony Scaduto’s biography. 
He was impressed by Dylan’s coming-to-New York saga: the snowstorm 
arrival, in 1961, from the Midwest; the pilgrimages to Woody Guthrie’s 
bedside at Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital; the first appearances at
 Café Wha? and Gerde’s Folk City; and then the audition for John 
Hammond, the legendary Columbia Records executive. This was what he 
wanted, some version of it.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s manager at the time was a rambunctious hustler named Mike 
Appel. Before joining Springsteen, Appel wrote jingles for Kleenex and a
 song for the Partridge Family. Appel was old school—passionate but 
exploitative. He signed Springsteen to lopsided contracts. <br>
<br>
And yet he was so ballsy and unhinged in his devotion to his client that
 he would do wild things on his behalf, like calling a producer at NBC 
to suggest that the network have Springsteen perform his antiwar song 
“Balboa vs. the Earth Slayer” at the Super Bowl. (NBC declined.) 
Somehow, Appel did manage to get an appointment with John Hammond.<br>
<br>
On May 2, 1972, Springsteen travelled to the city by bus, carrying a 
borrowed acoustic guitar with no case. The meeting didn’t begin well. 
Hammond, a patrician of Vanderbilt stock, made it clear that he was 
pressed for time, and he was repelled when Appel put on the hard sell 
about the singer’s lyrical gifts. But the vibe changed when Springsteen,
 sitting on a stool across from the desk, sang a string of songs ending 
with “If I Was a Priest”:<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, now, if Jesus was the sheriff<br>
And I was the priest, <br>
If my lady was an heiress <br>
and my mama was a thief . . .<br>
<br>
<br>
“Bruce, that’s the damnedest song I’ve ever heard,” Hammond said, delighted. “Were you brought up by nuns?”<br>
<br>
Columbia signed Springsteen to a record contract and tried to promote 
him as “the new Dylan.” He was not the only one. John Prine, Elliot 
Murphy, Loudon Wainwright III, and other singer-songwriter sensitivos 
were also getting the “new Dylan” label. (“The old Dylan was only 
thirty, so I don’t even know why they needed a fucking new Dylan,” 
Springsteen says.) To Hammond’s disappointment, Springsteen recorded his
 first two albums—“Greetings from Asbury Park” and “The Wild, the 
Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle”—with a band made up of his Jersey 
Shore mates, including Vini Lopez, on drums, and Clarence Clemons, on 
tenor sax. Hammond was convinced that the solo demos were better. 
Despite boosts from a few critics and d.j.s, the albums hardly sold at 
all. Springsteen was, at best, a gifted obscurity, a provincial who was 
running out of chances.<br>
<br>
In June, 1973, when I was fourteen, I got on a Red &amp; Tan 11-C bus in
 north Jersey with a couple of friends and went to the city to see a 
resolutely un-hip and unaccountably popular band called Chicago, at 
Madison Square Garden. I am not quite sure why I went. We were Dylan 
fanatics. “Howl,” the Stanley Brothers, Otis Redding, “Naked Lunch,” 
Hank Williams, Odetta—practically anything I knew or read or heard 
seemed to come through the auspices of Dylan. Chicago was about as far 
from the Dylan aesthetic as you could get.<br>
<br>
All the same, I’d paid my four dollars, and I was going to see whatever I
 could glimpse from our seats. Out trundled the opening act: someone 
named Bruce Springsteen. The conditions were abysmal, as they often are 
for opening acts: the houselights were up, the crowd was alternately 
inattentive and hostile. What I remember was a bandleader as frenetic as
 Mick Jagger or James Brown, a singer bursting with almost 
self-destructive urgency, trying to bust through the buzzy indifference 
of the crowd. After that show, Springsteen swore to Appel that he would 
never open or play big venues again. “I couldn’t stand it—everybody was 
so far away and the band couldn’t hear,” he told Dave Marsh. It was time
 to woodshed, time to build an audience through constant, intense 
performance in clubs, small theatres, and university gyms.<br>
<br>
These were lean times. After Appel had paid expenses and taken his 
considerable cut, the pay was next to nothing. Sometimes the band slept 
in the van. Clemons nearly got arrested before a gig for failing to pay 
child support. Lopez was especially vocal about playing for seeds: “What
 if I want to take my girlfriend out for a burger?”<br>
<br>
In the late afternoon, after lunch, Lopez and I were driving around 
Asbury Park and he started laughing and pointing. “That’s where we went 
to get food stamps—all of us, Bruce, too,” he said.<br>
<br>
Lopez was a lot of drummer, too much drummer, perhaps—a chaotic Ginger 
Baker type. He was also fiery in his style of labor unrest. In early 
1974, he roughed up Mike Appel’s brother in a dispute over money (“I did
 push him a little”). Soon afterward, Springsteen told Lopez that he was
 fired.<br>
<br>
“I used to keep his guitars at my house, and he had to come get them,” 
Lopez said. “I asked for a second chance, and he said, ‘Vini, there are 
no second chances.’ Christ. Danny got all kinds of second chances after 
being a bad boy—for drugs, for not showing up or for being late. But for
 me no second chances.” The argument grew more heated, and Springsteen 
finally suggested that Lopez was an inadequate drummer.<br>
<br>
“I put his guitars down in front of him, and I said, ‘There’s the door. 
You know what it’s used for.’ To this day we haven’t talked about it. 
There’s nothing to talk about. I’d have been in the biggest band in the 
land if that hadn’t happened. But, historically, at least, I was in the E
 Street Band. Bruce knows that, and everyone knows that.”<br>
<br>
We drove past the low-slung building that used to house the surfboard 
factory where Lopez lived with Springsteen. The sign on the door now 
reads, “Immunostics Inc: Quality microbiological, serological and 
immunological reagents.” Around ten times over the years, Springsteen 
has had Lopez sit in with the band, including at Giants Stadium for a 
rendition of “Spirit in the Night.” When Lopez asked if he could start a
 band that played all the old Steel Mill songs, Springsteen smiled and 
said sure, go ahead.<br>
<br>
“But it’s hard to sell Steel Mill now,” Lopez said. “People know that 
Bruce wrote all the stuff and so they expect Bruce to show up, and that 
just ain’t gonna happen.”<br>
<br>
If Vini Lopez is the unluckiest drummer in American history, Jon Landau 
is surely the most fortunate of rock critics. During a break in the 
rehearsals for the 2012 tour, I drove up to northern Westchester, where 
Landau lives with his wife, Barbara. Landau is just three years older 
than Springsteen, but he is a man of more ordinary physical presence. 
Landau has been getting a healthy cut of the Springsteen business for 
more than thirty years. The profits did not go up his nose; they went on
 the walls. His art collection (mainly Renaissance painting and 
sculpture, with some nineteenth-century French painting thrown into the 
mix) is what is called “important.” At the risk of alarming his 
insurance company, I can report the presence of works by, among others, 
Titian, Tintoretto, Tiepolo, Donatello, Ghiberti, Géricault, Delacroix, 
Corot, and Courbet.<br>
<br>
But Landau has not escaped time unscathed. Last year, he had a growth 
surgically removed from his brain, and, because the growth was lodged 
near a tangle of optic nerves, he lost the vision in one eye. The 
recovery was not easy, and, at times, as we toured the paintings, Landau
 seemed winded. After the surgery, Springsteen was with Landau nearly 
every day. “He knew I was going through something, and I thought I was 
going to die,” Landau said. “It wasn’t rational, but the fear was there.
 . . . We shared a lot of deep talk.” Then he smiled. “The deep thinkers
 did some deep thinking.”<br>
<br>
Landau began his life in a profession that didn’t really exist. Even by 
1966, three years after the rise of the Beatles, there really was no 
such thing as rock criticism. That year, Landau, a precocious teen-ager 
from Lexington, Massachusetts, was working in a Cambridge music store 
called Briggs &amp; Briggs. His father was a left-wing history teacher 
who moved the family from Brooklyn during the blacklists and got a job 
at Acoustic Research. Landau grew up on folk music, and in high school 
he went to every rock concert he could afford. At Briggs &amp; Briggs, 
he met a Swarthmore student named Paul Williams, who had just started a 
mimeographed, three-staple magazine called Crawdaddy!, perhaps the first
 publication devoted to rock criticism. As an undergraduate at Brandeis,
 Landau wrote for Crawdaddy! When he was a junior, Jann Wenner invited 
him to write a column for a biweekly he was starting, to be called 
Rolling Stone.<br>
<br>
As a critic, Landau was nothing if not bold. For the inaugural issue of 
Rolling Stone, in 1967, he panned Jimi Hendrix’s classic “Are You 
Experienced?” The next year, he walloped Cream for the loose bombast of 
their live shows, adding that Eric Clapton, the band’s lead guitarist, 
was a “master of the blues clichés of all the post-World War II blues 
guitarists . . . a virtuoso at performing other people’s ideas.” At the 
time, Clapton was known as “God.” The review gave God a fit of 
self-doubt. “The ring of truth just knocked me backward; I was in a 
restaurant and I fainted,” Clapton said years later. “And after I woke 
up, I immediately decided that that was the end of the band.” Cream 
broke up.<br>
<br>
Landau loved the well-wrought single, whether by the Beatles or Sam and 
Dave; he was suspicious of arty self-indulgence. “More and more people 
expect of rock what they used to expect of philosophy, literature, 
films, and visual art,” he wrote. “Others expect of rock what they used 
to get out of drugs. And in my opinion, rock cannot withstand that kind 
of burden because it forces onto rock qualities which are the negation 
of what rock was all about in the first place.”<br>
<br>
In those days, there wasn’t a sharp line between the rock industry and 
rock journalism; in 1969, Jann Wenner produced a Boz Scaggs record. 
Landau produced albums with Livingston Taylor and the MC5. Landau 
admired musically savvy executives, like Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler,
 and he approved of musicians who understood the virtues of popularity. 
In his senior honors thesis at Brandeis, he wrote admiringly of Otis 
Redding’s willingness to be an entertainer “openly and honestly 
concerned with pleasing crowds and being successful.”<br>
<br>
By the end of 1971, Landau was living in Boston and married to the 
critic Janet Maslin. Although he had Crohn’s disease and was ailing, he 
was the energetic center of a circle of emerging young critics: Dave 
Marsh, John Rockwell, Robert Christgau, Paul Nelson, Greil Marcus. 
Landau took notice of Springsteen’s first album, “Greetings from Asbury 
Park,” assigning the review to Lester Bangs, in Rolling Stone; he 
reviewed the second, “The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle,” 
in the alternative weekly The Real Paper, calling Springsteen “the most 
impressive new singer-songwriter since James Taylor,” but he added that 
“the album is not as well-produced as it ought to have been.” It was “a 
mite thin or trebly-sounding, especially when the band moves into the 
breaks.”<br>
<br>
Landau, who was twenty-six at the time, accepted an invitation from Dave
 Marsh to go to Charley’s, a club in Cambridge, to check out 
Springsteen’s act. “I went to this club, and it was completely empty,” 
he told me. “He had the smallest of cult followings. Before the show, I 
asked the guys in the bar where Bruce was, and they pointed outside.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen was standing in the cold—a skinny bearded guy in jeans and a
 T-shirt, hopping up and down to keep warm. He was reading Landau’s 
record review, which the management had put in the window.<br>
<br>
“I stood next to him and said, ‘What do you think?’ ” Landau recounted. 
“And he said, ‘This guy is usually pretty good, but I’ve seen better.’ I
 introduced myself, and we had a good laugh.”<br>
<br>
The next day, he got a call from Springsteen. “We talked for hours,” 
Landau said. “About music, about philosophy. The core of him then was 
the same as it is now. And, you know, we’ve been having that 
conversation for the rest of our lives: about growth, about thinking big
 thoughts, about big things.”<br>
<br>
A month later, Landau went to see Springsteen at the Harvard Square 
Theatre, where he was opening for Bonnie Raitt. It was the eve of 
Landau’s twenty-seventh birthday, and he was feeling prematurely worn 
out. His career was at a standstill. The Crohn’s disease was making it 
hard to eat or work. His marriage was falling apart. But that night, May
 9, 1974, he felt rejuvenated as Springsteen played everything from the 
old Fats Domino tune “Let the Four Winds Blow” to a new song about 
escape and liberation called “Born to Run.”<br>
<br>
The article that Landau wrote for The Real Paper is the most famous review in the history of rock criticism:<br>
<br>
<br>
" Last Thursday, at the Harvard Square Theatre, I saw my rock ’n’ roll 
past flash before my eyes. And I saw something else: I saw rock and roll
 future and its name is Bruce Springsteen. And on a night when I needed 
to feel young, he made me feel like I was hearing music for the very 
first time. . . . He is a rock ’n’ roll punk, a Latin street poet, a 
ballet dancer, an actor, a joker, bar band leader, hot-shit rhythm 
guitar player, extraordinary singer, and a truly great rock ’n’ roll 
composer. He leads a band like he has been doing it forever. . . . He 
parades in front of his all-star rhythm band like a cross between Chuck 
Berry, early Bob Dylan, and Marlon Brando."<br>
<br>
<br>
Columbia Records used the line “I saw rock and roll future” as the 
centerpiece of an ad campaign. Springsteen befriended Landau, who came 
to stay with him at his ramshackle house, in Long Branch. “Modest 
doesn’t even begin to describe the house,” Landau recalled. “There was a
 couch, his bed, a guitar, and his records. And we were up till 8 A.M 
talking.” The two men listened to music and talked about Springsteen’s 
third record. Columbia was not likely to keep investing in Springsteen 
if the third record failed. Springsteen appreciated Appel’s loyalty, but
 his way of making high-handed judgments grated. Landau was more subtle,
 asking questions, flattering, suggesting, recommending. Springsteen 
invited Landau into the studio, where he helped Springsteen cut “Thunder
 Road” from seven minutes to four and advised him to revise the opening 
of “Jungleland.”<br>
<br>
“I had a youthful conviction that I knew what I was doing,” Landau said.
 Springsteen told Appel that he was bringing in Landau as co-producer.</div>

<br>
“Born to Run,” which was released in August, 1975, transformed 
Springsteen’s career, and the ten-show stand at the Bottom Line early in
 the tour remains a rock date to rival James Brown at the Apollo or 
Dylan at Newport. At the Bottom Line, Springsteen became himself. By 
adding Van Zandt as a second guitar player, he was liberated from some 
of his musical duties, and he became a full-throttle front man, leaping 
off amps and pianos, frog-hopping from one tabletop to the next.<br>
<br>
Landau quit his job as a critic and became, in essence, Springsteen’s 
adjutant: his friend, his adviser in all things, his producer, and, by 
1978, his manager. After a prolonged legal battle that kept Springsteen 
out of the studio for two years, Appel was bought off and cast out.<br>
<br>
Landau fed Springsteen’s curiosity about the world beyond music. He gave
 Springsteen books to read—Steinbeck, Flannery O’Connor—and movies to 
see, particularly John Ford and Howard Hawks Westerns. Springsteen 
started to think in larger terms than cars and highways; he began to 
look at his own story, his family’s story, in terms of class and 
American archetypes. The imagery, the storytelling, and the sense of 
place in those novels and films helped fuel his songs. Landau was also a
 catalyst in making Springsteen into a big business, pressing him to 
play bigger halls, overcoming his nightmarish early performances at 
Madison Square Garden. And he pressed him to think of himself the way 
Otis Redding did—as both an artist and an entertainer on a large stage.<br>
<br>
Some critics have depicted Landau as an avaricious Svengali, a Colonel 
Parker, or worse. But the people I’ve talked to in the music business 
dismiss any idea of malign or overweening influence on Springsteen. “The
 idea that he’d be manipulated is so preposterous,” Danny Goldberg, who 
has known Springsteen for more than thirty years, says. As Goldberg, who
 has managed Nirvana and Sonic Youth, puts it, “It’s Bruce who uses Jon,
 to achieve complete artistic control.” Landau is sensitive to any claim
 that he is somehow controlling his client or responsible for his 
trajectory. “The first principle of being a manager is being a fiduciary
 for the artist—his interests come first,” he says. “So when you are 
working with him, no matter what the issue is, the first question is, 
What’s the best thing for Bruce?” Springsteen, he went on, “is the 
smartest person I’ve ever known—not the most informed or the most 
educated—but the smartest. If you are ever confronted with a situation—a
 practical matter, an artistic problem—his read of the people involved 
is exquisite. He is way ahead.”<br>
<br>
At one point a decade ago, Springsteen rewarded Landau, who had once 
dreamed of becoming a rock star himself, by calling him onstage. “Bruce 
told me one night I should strap on a guitar when we got to ‘Dancing in 
the Dark,’ and for five or six nights I came out,” Landau told me one 
night backstage. “It’s just a tremendous high. But then on the seventh 
night he said, ‘You know, it’s great you comin’ out onstage. But I was 
thinking that maybe we should give that a rest tonight.’ ”<br>
<br>
“You mean I’m fired?” Landau said.<br>
<br>
Springsteen smiled and said, “Well, yeah. That’s about the size of it.”<br>
<br>
As Springsteen grew more worldly, he became far more political. He did 
not start out that way. In 1972, he played a small benefit for George 
McGovern, at a movie theatre in Red Bank, but, as a young man, his 
interest in the music was almost completely as a source of personal 
liberation. He had not made the connection between his father’s drift 
and the politics of unemployment, the depression of Freehold and the 
wave of deindustrialization.<br>
<br>
A political consciousness could be felt on “Darkness on the Edge of 
Town,” and it grew in the years that followed. He began to find the 
voice for that by reading—Landau’s enthusiasms played a role here—and by
 travelling, and, crucially, by listening to country and folk music: to 
Hank Williams and Woody Guthrie. Springsteen knew he had run out of 
things to say about desperate nights on the Turnpike; he wanted to write
 songs he could sing as an adult, about marriage, about being a father, 
and about larger social issues. As he listened again and again to Hank 
Williams, he said, the songs went from “archival to alive.” What had 
seemed “cranky and old-fashioned” now had depth and darkness; Williams 
represented “the adult blues,” and the music of the working class. 
“Country by its nature appealed to me, country was provincial, and so 
was I,” Springsteen said in a recent speech, in Austin. “I felt I was an
 average guy with a slightly above-average gift . . . and country was 
about the truth emanating out of your sweat, out of your local bar, your
 corner store.” He read Joe Klein’s biography of Guthrie. He read 
memoirs by the civil-rights lawyer Morris Dees and the antiwar activist 
Ron Kovic. All this fed into the working-class anthems of “Darkness on 
the Edge of Town,” the acoustic howl of “Nebraska,” and even the 
anthemic pop of “Born in the U.S.A.” He was singing now about Vietnam 
veterans, migrant workers, class, social divisions, deindustrialized 
cities, and forgotten American towns, but never in an idiom that 
threatened “Bruce”—the iconic family-friendly rock star. From the stage,
 he began to deliver paeans to his causes and ask for donations to local
 food banks, but the language was never threatening or alienating, and 
the gate receipts and record sales were beyond fabulous.<br>
<br>
Some detected in all this the stink of sanctimony. In 1985, James 
Wolcott, a punk and New Wave enthusiast, found himself weary of 
Springsteen’s “cornball” sincerity and the level of praise accorded him 
by the “city-slick Establishment.” “Piety has begun to collect around 
Springsteen’s curly head like mist around a mountaintop,” Wolcott wrote 
in Vanity Fair. “The mountain can’t be blamed for the mist, but 
still—the reverence is getting awfully thick.” For Tom Carson, the 
problem was insufficient radicalism—the fact that Springsteen remained, 
at heart, conventionally liberal. Springsteen “thought rock and roll was
 basically wholesome,” Carson wrote in L.A. Weekly. “It was an 
alternative, an escape—but not a rebellion, either as a route to 
forbidden sexual or social fruit, or, by extension, as a rejection of 
conventional society. To him, rock redeemed conventional society.”<br>
<br>
In the marketplace of arena rock, that measure of conventionality was a 
strength, not a limitation. By the mid-eighties, Springsteen was the 
biggest rock star in the world, capable of selling out Giants Stadium 
ten shows in a row. He was so unthreatening to American values that, in 
1984, George Will went to see him. Wearing a bow tie, a double-breasted 
blazer, and earplugs, Will watched Springsteen perform in Washington and
 wrote a column called “A Yankee Doodle Springsteen”: “I have not got a 
clue about Springsteen’s politics. . . . He is no whiner, and the 
recitation of closed factories and other problems always seems 
punctuated by a grand, cheerful affirmation: ‘Born in the U.S.A.!’ ” A 
week later, Ronald Reagan went to New Jersey to give a campaign speech. 
Taking his cue from Will, Reagan said, “America’s future rests in a 
thousand dreams inside your hearts; it rests in the message of hope in 
songs so many young Americans admire: New Jersey’s own Bruce 
Springsteen.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen was appalled. He later said that “Born in the U.S.A.” was 
“the most misunderstood song since ‘Louie, Louie,’ ” and he began to 
sing an acoustic version that leached it of its bombast and made its 
dark shadings plainer. From the stage, he said, “Well, the President was
 mentioning my name in his speech the other day, and I kind of got to 
wondering what his favorite album of mine must’ve been, you know? I 
don’t think it was the ‘Nebraska’ album. I don’t think he’s been 
listening to this one.” Springsteen played “Johnny 99,” the bleak story 
of a laid-off Jersey autoworker who, in drunken despair, kills a night 
clerk in a botched robbery.<br>
<br>
Someone once said to Paul McCartney that the Beatles were “anti-materialistic.” McCartney had to laugh.<br>
<br>
“That’s a huge myth,” he replied. “John and I literally used to sit down and say, ‘Now, let’s write a swimming pool.’ ”<br>
<br>
With the “Born in the U.S.A.” album, Springsteen combined political 
virtue and popular appeal, protest and party time. When he was writing 
the songs for the album that became “Born in the U.S.A.,” Landau told 
him that they had a great record, but they still didn’t have a swimming 
pool. They needed a hit.<br>
<br>
“Look, I’ve written seventy songs,” Springsteen replied. “You want 
another one, you write it!” Then he sulkily retreated to his hotel suite
 and wrote “Dancing in the Dark.” The lyrics reflected the played-out 
frustration of an artist who “ain’t got nothing to say,” but the music—a
 pop confection buttressed by a hummable synthesizer line—went down 
easy. “It went as far in the direction of pop music as I wanted to 
go—and probably a little farther,” Springsteen recalled in a text for 
his book of lyrics, “Songs.” “My heroes, from Hank Williams to Frank 
Sinatra to Bob Dylan, were popular musicians. They had hits. There was 
value in trying to connect with a large audience.” “Born in the U.S.A.” 
went platinum and became the best-selling record of 1985 and of 
Springsteen’s career.<br>
<br>
When Springsteen and Van Zandt were young, they had “pink Cadillac” 
dreams, fantasies of wealth and rock-and-roll glory. “I knew I was never
 going to be Woody Guthrie,” Springsteen recalled, in Austin. “I liked 
Elvis, I liked the pink Cadillac too much, I like the simplicity and the
 tossed-off temporary feeling of pop hits, I like a big fuckin’ noise, 
and, in my own way, I like the luxuries, and the comforts, of being a 
star.” He bought a fourteen-million-dollar estate in Beverly Hills. He 
remained friends with his old running mates from Jersey, but he also 
made new friends, famous friends. When he married an actress named 
Julianne Phillips, in 1985, they honeymooned at Gianni Versace’s villa 
on Lake Como. Later, there were vintage cars and motorcycles, a 
state-of-the-art home recording studio, horses, and, the ultimate sign 
of class ascent, organic farming. Tours grew to corporate scale: private
 jets, five-star hotels, elaborate catering, massage therapists, 
efficient management.<br>
<br>
Springsteen was aware of the comical contradiction: the multimillionaire
 who, in his theatrical self-presentation, is the voice of the 
dispossessed. Very occasionally, twinges of discomfort about this have 
leaked into his lyrics. In the late eighties, Springsteen played “Ain’t 
Got You,” which appeared on his album “Tunnel of Love,” for Van Zandt. 
The lyrics tell of a fellow who gets “paid a king’s ransom for doin’ 
what comes naturally”—who’s got “the fortunes of heaven” and a “house 
full of Rembrandt and priceless art”—but lacks the affections of his 
beloved. Van Zandt recognized the self-mockery but didn’t care. He was 
aghast.<br>
<br>
“We had one of our biggest fights of our lives,” Van Zandt recalled. 
“I’m, like, ‘What the fuck is this?’ And he’s, like, ‘Well, what do you 
mean, it’s the truth. It’s just who I am, it’s my life.’ And I’m, like, 
‘This is bullshit. People don’t need you talking about your life. Nobody
 gives a shit about your life. They need you for their lives. That’s 
your thing. Giving some logic and reason and sympathy and passion to 
this cold, fragmented, confusing world—that’s your gift. Explaining 
their lives to them. Their lives, not yours.’ And we fought and fought 
and fought and fought. He says ‘Fuck you,’ I say ‘Fuck you.’ I think 
something in what I said probably resonated.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen was also experiencing intervals of depression that were far 
more serious than the occasional guilt trip about being “a rich man in a
 poor man’s shirt,” as he sings in “Better Days.” A cloud of crisis 
hovered as Springsteen was finishing his acoustic masterpiece 
“Nebraska,” in 1982. He drove from the East Coast to California and then
 drove straight back. “He was feeling suicidal,” Springsteen’s friend 
and biographer Dave Marsh said. “The depression wasn’t shocking, per se.
 He was on a rocket ride, from nothing to something, and now you are 
getting your ass kissed day and night. You might start to have some 
inner conflicts about your real self-worth.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen began questioning why his relationships were a series of 
drive-bys. And he could not let go of the past, either—a sense that he 
had inherited his father’s depressive self-isolation. For years, he 
would drive at night past his parents’ old house in Freehold, sometimes 
three or four times a week. In 1982, he started seeing a 
psychotherapist. At a concert years later, Springsteen introduced his 
song “My Father’s House” by recalling what the therapist had told him 
about those nighttime trips to Freehold: “He said, ‘What you’re doing is
 that something bad happened, and you’re going back, thinking that you 
can make it right again. Something went wrong, and you keep going back 
to see if you can fix it or somehow make it right.’ And I sat there and I
 said, ‘That is what I’m doing.’ And he said, ‘Well, you can’t.’ ”<br>
<br>
Extreme wealth may have satisfied every pink-Cadillac dream, but it did 
little to chase off the black dog. Springsteen was playing concerts that
 went nearly four hours, driven, he has said, by “pure fear and 
self-loathing and self-hatred.” He played that long not just to thrill 
the audience but also to burn himself out. Onstage, he held real life at
 bay.<br>
<br>
“My issues weren’t as obvious as drugs,” Springsteen said. “Mine were 
different, they were quieter—just as problematic, but quieter. With all 
artists, because of the undertow of history and self-loathing, there is a
 tremendous push toward self-obliteration that occurs onstage. It’s both
 things: there’s a tremendous finding of the self while also an 
abandonment of the self at the same time. You are free of yourself for 
those hours; all the voices in your head are gone. Just gone. There’s no
 room for them. There’s one voice, the voice you’re speaking in.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s life in the past two decades has been, from all 
appearances, notably stable. In 1991, he married Patti Scialfa, a 
denizen of the Asbury Park music scene who had joined the band as a 
singer. Scialfa’s father was a real-estate developer, and she had 
studied music at N.Y.U.<br>
<br>
While Springsteen was on the road, I drove to Colts Neck, where he and 
Patti live on a three-hundred-and-eighty-acre farm. They have three 
children, two sons and a daughter, and when the kids were small the 
family lived closer to the shore, in Rumson, New Jersey. Rumson is 
wealthy in a suburban way. Colts Neck looks more like Middleburg, 
Virginia. Horsey people live there. So does Queen Latifah. The 
Springsteens also own houses in Beverly Hills and in Wellington, 
Florida.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is hardly immune to the charms of his own good fortune (“I 
live high on the hog”), yet Patti, who grew up near him but with a great
 deal more money, has a grander eye. When they moved to Colts Neck, she 
hired Rose Tarlow, an interior designer who had worked for their friend 
David Geffen, to do the house. When I arrived, a security guard led me 
to a garage complex that had been re-made into a recording studio and a 
series of sitting rooms. The walls are decorated with photographs of, 
most conspicuously, Bruce Springsteen; the tables and shelves are heavy 
on the literature of popular music, with an emphasis on Presley, Dylan, 
Guthrie, and Springsteen. There’s a big TV, an espresso machine, and a 
framed walking stick that Presley once owned and, in 1973, shattered in a
 fit of pique.<br>
<br>
Patti Scialfa showed up after a while, trailed by two big, shambly 
German shepherds. A tall, slender woman in her late fifties with a 
startling shock of red hair, she was warm and smiling, offering water in
 the modern way; she also seemed a little nervous. Scialfa, like her 
husband, enjoys a magnificently cosseted life, but hers is a strange 
position and she doesn’t often talk about it publicly. At concerts, she 
performs two microphones to her husband’s left, a perfect vantage point 
from which to inspect, night after night, the thousands of hungry eyes 
directed his way. Scialfa has recorded three albums of her own. In the E
 Street Band, which she joined twenty-eight years ago, she plays 
acoustic guitar and sings, but, as she told me, “I have to say that my 
place in the band is more figurative than it is musical.” Onstage, her 
guitar is barely audible, and she is one of many supporting voices. Yet 
no one in the crowd is unaware that she is Springsteen’s wife––his 
“Jersey girl,” his “red-headed woman,” as the songs go––and, at any 
given theatrical moment onstage, she can flirt, rebuff, swoon, or dance.
 The E Street Band is an ensemble of characters, as well as musicians, 
and Scialfa expertly plays her role as Love Interest and Bemused Wife, 
just as Steve Van Zandt plays his as Best Friend. “Sometimes my 
frustration comes when I would like to bring something to the table that
 is more unique,” she said, “but the band, in the context of the band, 
has no room for that.”<br>
<br>
On the last couple of tours, Scialfa has been an intermittent presence. 
She skips concerts to be with the children: the eldest, Evan, just 
graduated from Boston College; their daughter, Jessica, is at Duke and 
rides on an international equestrian circuit; and the youngest, Sam, 
will be a freshman this fall at Bard College. Being around for the kids 
has been a priority. “When I was young, I felt really, really 
vulnerable,” Scialfa said. “So I wanted things to be relaxed and stable 
and have somebody in the house and make sure they felt supported when 
they went off to school.” She added, “The hardest part is splitting 
yourself, the feeling that you’re never doing any one job really well.”<br>
<br>
It took some doing to get Springsteen, an “isolationist” by nature, to 
settle into a real marriage, and resist the urge to dwell only in his 
music and onstage. “Now I see that two of the best days of my life,” he 
once told a reporter for Rolling Stone, “were the day I picked up the 
guitar and the day that I learned how to put it down.”<br>
<br>
Scialfa smiled at that. “When you are that serious and that creative, 
and non-trusting on an intimate level, and your art has given you so 
much, your ability to create something becomes your medicine,” she said.
 “It’s the only thing that’s given you that stability, that joy, that 
self-esteem. And so you are, like, ‘This part of me no one is going to 
touch.’ When you’re young, that works, because it gets you from A to B. 
When you get older, when you are trying to have a family and children, 
it doesn’t work. I think that some artists can be prone to protecting 
the well that they fetched their inspiration from so well that they are 
actually protecting malignant parts of themselves, too. You begin to see
 that something is broken. It’s not just a matter of being the 
mythological lone wolf; something is broken. Bruce is very smart. He 
wanted a family, he wanted a relationship, and he worked really, really,
 really hard at it––as hard as he works at his music.”<br>
<br>
I asked Patti how he finally succeeded. “Obviously, therapy,” she said. 
“He was able to look at himself and battle it out.” And yet none of this
 has allowed Springsteen to pronounce himself free and clear. “That 
didn’t scare me,” Scialfa said. “I suffered from depression myself, so I
 knew what that was about. Clinical depression—I knew what that was 
about. I felt very akin to him.”<br>
<br>
In their early days as a couple, Bruce and Patti’s idea of a perfect 
vacation was to get in the car and drive to Death Valley, rent a cheap 
hotel room with no TV and no phone, and just hang out. Now they are more
 likely to take a trip with the kids or cruise the Mediterranean on 
David Geffen’s yacht. “I remember when my family became pretty wealthy, 
and some people tried to make us feel bad about being wealthy,” she 
said. “Here’s the bottom line. If your art is intact, your art is 
intact. Who wrote ‘Anna Karenina’? Tolstoy? He was an aristocrat! Did 
that make his work any less true? If you are lucky enough to have a real
 talent and you’ve fed it and mined it and protected it and been 
vigilant about it, can you lose it? Well, you can lose it by sitting 
outside and drinking Ripple! It doesn’t have to be the high life.”<br>
<br>
As Springsteen sees it, the creative talent has always been nurtured by 
the darker currents of his psyche, and wealth is no guarantee of bliss. 
“I’m thirty years in analysis!” he said. “Look, you cannot underestimate
 the fine power of self-loathing in all of this. You think, I don’t like
 anything I’m seeing, I don’t like anything I’m doing, but I need to 
change myself, I need to transform myself. I do not know a single artist
 who does not run on that fuel. If you are extremely pleased with 
yourself, nobody would be fucking doing it! Brando would not have acted.
 Dylan wouldn’t have written ‘Like a Rolling Stone.’ James Brown 
wouldn’t have gone ‘Unh!’ He wouldn’t have searched that one-beat down 
that was so hard. That’s a motivation, that element of ‘I need to remake
 myself, my town, my audience’—the desire for renewal.”<br>
<br>
“Wrecking Ball” is as political a record as “What’s Going On?,” “Rage 
Against the Machine,” or “It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us 
Back.” After Springsteen’s political run-ins in the eighties, he grew 
even more engaged with social issues. He sang of AIDS (“Streets of 
Philadelphia”), dislocation (“The Ghost of Tom Joad”), abandonment 
(“Spare Parts”), and Iraq (“Last to Die”). He made speeches from the 
stage about “rendition, illegal wiretapping, voter suppression, no 
habeas corpus.” For his trouble, he was attacked by Bill O’Reilly, Glenn
 Beck, and even a Times columnist, John Tierney, who wrote, “The singer 
who recorded ‘Greetings from Asbury Park’ seems to have made an 
ideological crossing of the Hudson: ‘Greetings from Central Park West.’ ”
 In 2004, he campaigned for John Kerry and, in 2008, he was even more 
enthusiastic about Barack Obama, posting a statement on his Web site 
saying that Obama “speaks to the America I’ve envisioned in my music for
 the past 35 years, a generous nation with a citizenry willing to tackle
 nuanced and complex problems, a country that’s interested in its 
collective destiny and in the potential of its gathered spirit.” At a 
concert at the Lincoln Memorial before Obama’s inauguration, Springsteen
 sang “The Rising” with a gospel choir and, with Pete Seeger, Woody 
Guthrie’s “This Land Is Your Land,” including, at Seeger’s suggestion, 
the two last, “radical” verses. (“There was a great high wall there / 
that tried to stop me; / A great big sign there / Said private property;
 / But on the other side / It didn’t say nothing; / That side was made 
for you and me.”)<br>
<br>
The songs on “Wrecking Ball” were written before the Occupy Wall Street 
movement, but they echo its rage against the lack of accountability. “We
 Are Alive” draws a line between ghosts of oppressed strikers, 
civil-rights marchers, and workers, while the chorus is a kind of 
communion among the dead and a call to the living: “We are alive / And 
though our bodies lie alone here in the dark / Our spirits rise / To 
carry the fire and light the spark.” For all that, the political 
vision—in “Wrecking Ball,” as in its predecessors—isn’t really radical. 
It’s shot through with a liberal insistence that American patriotism has
 less to do with the primacy of markets than with a Rooseveltian sense 
of fairness and a communal sense of belonging.<br>
<br>
One night, I asked Springsteen what he hoped his political songs would 
do for people who come to concerts for a good time. He shook his head 
and said, “They function at the very edges of politics at best, though 
they try to administer to its center. You have to be satisfied with 
that. You have to understand it’s a long road, and there have been 
people doing some version of what we’re doing on this tour going all the
 way back, and there will be people doing it after us. I think one thing
 this record tries to do is to remind people that there is a continuity 
that is passed on from generation to generation, a set of ideas 
expressed in myriad different ways: books, protests, essays, songs, 
around the kitchen table. So these ideas are ever-present. And you are a
 raindrop.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen admires Obama for the health-care bill, for rescuing the 
automobile industry, for the withdrawal from Iraq, for killing Osama bin
 Laden; he is disappointed in the failure to close Guantánamo and to 
appoint more champions of economic fairness, and he sees an unseemly 
friendliness toward corporations—the usual liberal points of praise and 
dispraise. He’s wary about joining another campaign. “I did it twice 
because things were so dire,” he said. “It seemed like if I was ever 
going to spend whatever small political capital I had, that was the 
moment to do so. But that capital diminishes the more often you do it. 
While I’m not saying never, and I still like to support the President, 
you know, it’s something I didn’t do for a long time, and I don’t have 
plans to be out there every time.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen has been faulted for taking himself too seriously, and the 
microworld around him takes him so seriously that to an outsider it can 
occasionally seem like a cocoon of piety. But Springsteen can also be 
funny about himself. Two years ago, on Jimmy Fallon’s show, he agreed to
 dress up as himself circa “Born to Run”—beard, aviator shades, floppy 
pimp cap, leather jacket—and went on with Fallon, who was dressed as 
Neil Young, to sing a mock-serious version of the Willow Smith ditty 
“Whip My Hair.” It’s hard to imagine, say, Bob Dylan putting on a Bob 
Dylan work shirt circa “The Times They Are A-Changin’ ” and sending up 
his younger self. In a more recent show, Fallon, again dressed as Neil 
Young, again brought out Springsteen, this time dressed in his 
muscled-up eighties regular-Jersey-guy regalia—complete with sleeveless 
denim shirt. They sang a duet of the party-song pop duo LMFAO’s “Sexy 
and I Know It”: “I’m in a Speedo tryin’ t’ tan my cheeks. . . . I’m sexy
 and I know it!”<br>
<br>
As a writer and as a performer, Springsteen is in command of a variety 
of themes and moods: comic and grandiose, political and mindless. As the
 tour developed, he altered the set lists so that each show felt 
specific to the occasion. At the Apollo, he declared that soul music had
 been the band’s education: “We studied all our subjects. Geography? We 
learned the exact location of ‘Funky Broadway.’ History? ‘A Change Is 
Gonna Come.’ Math? ‘99 and a Half Won’t Fucking Do.’ ” In Austin, 
Springsteen celebrated the centenary of Woody Guthrie’s birth by opening
 the show with Woody’s itinerant worker’s lament “I Ain’t Got No Home” 
and closed it with “This Land Is Your Land.”<br>
<br>
In Tampa, Springsteen played “American Skin (41 Shots),” which was 
written in the wake of the police shooting of Amadou Diallo, but was now
 for Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teen-ager who was killed in 
Sanford, Florida. On the first of two nights in Philadelphia, 
Springsteen paid homage to his Shore roots by playing two 
semi-obscurities from his first years as a recording musician, “Seaside 
Bar Song” and “Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?” On one foray into the
 audience, he found Max Weinberg’s ninety-seven-year-old mother and gave
 her a kiss. The next night, he pulled his eighty-seven-year-old mother,
 Adele, onto the stage and danced with her to “Dancing in the Dark.” In 
New Jersey, Springsteen heightened the tribute to Clarence Clemons. 
During the final song, “Tenth Avenue Freeze Out,” he stopped the music 
after the line “The Big Man joined the band,” and a film of Clemons 
rolled on the screens above the stage. (“Man, I could barely stand 
that,” the percussionist Everett Bradley told me later. “I was crying so
 bad!”)<br>
<br>
At each show, the most striking musical difference between the old E 
Street Band and the new was the increasing prominence given to Jake 
Clemons. His playing grew stronger, his willingness to take center stage
 more pronounced. After a few performances, he was moon-walking across 
the stage. And yet every time Springsteen paid tribute to Clarence 
Clemons Jake seemed overcome, pounding his chest with a double tap of 
respect for his uncle and appreciation of the crowd’s response. 
“Everyone wants to be part of something bigger than themselves,” Jake 
said. “A Springsteen show is a lot of things, and it’s partly a 
religious experience. Maybe he comes from the line of David, a shepherd 
boy who could play beautiful music, so that the crazy become less crazy 
and Saul the king finally chills out. Religion is a system of rules and 
order and expectations, and it unites people in a purpose. There really 
is a component of Bruce that is supernatural. Bruce is Moses! He led the
 people out of the land of disco!”<br>
<br>
One night, as Springsteen was waiting to perform, I asked how he thought
 his inner constitution led to his being the artist and performer he is.
 “I probably worked harder than anybody else I saw,” he said. But there 
was, he thought, a core psychological component as well: “I searched out
 something that I needed to do. It’s a job that’s filled with ego and 
vanity and narcissism, and you need all those things to do it well. But 
you can’t let those things completely swamp you, either. You need all 
those things but in relative check. And in relative check for me, if you
 ask some of my friends or some members of my family, might not be 
considered in check to them! It’s in relative check as far as people who
 do what I do. But you need those things, because you are driven by your
 needs out there—the raw hunger and the raw need of exciting people and 
exciting yourself into some higher state. People have pursued that 
throughout the history of civilization. It’s a strange job, and for a 
lot of people it’s a dangerous job. But those things are at the root of 
it.”<br>
<br>
In May, the tour set off for a three-month run of stadium performances 
in Europe. In Barcelona, Springsteen was staying in a suite, with a 
private deck and a Jacuzzi, at the Florida, a glorious hillside hotel 
overlooking the city; the band and the crew stayed at the Hotel Arts, a 
five-star hotel on the beach. A caravan of black Mercedes vans whisked 
the musicians (some band members have their own travelling assistants) 
to the Olympic Stadium in the afternoon for sound check. Banish any 
images of rock legend: forget about dissipated drummers slumped in a 
junkie haze in some stadium locker room, forget roadies hurling 
televisions and empty bottles of Jack Daniels from hotel balconies into 
the pool. The Springsteen road show is about as decadent as the Ice 
Capades. Band members talk about missing their kids, jet lag, Wi-Fi 
reception at the hotel.<br>
<br>
“To be a success these days, you are more likely to be an athlete than a
 drug addict,” Van Zandt told me. “You go through the phase of drugs and
 drinking, and if you get through it you see that all the rewards are in
 longevity. Longevity is more fun than the drugs. Then, there’s the 
business. For that you need a clean head.”<br>
<br>
The upper echelon of the pop-music touring business is, like Silicon 
Valley, dominated by a small number of enterprises: Lady Gaga, Madonna, 
U2, Jon Bon Jovi, Jay-Z, and a very few others. The drop-off in scale 
from there is precipitous. Springsteen is no longer in the Beatlemania 
phase of the mid-eighties—a period of mini-riots around his hotels—but 
he is still able to sell out stadiums on the I-95 corridor and other 
cities in the United States. He is even more popular in Europe. The 
rhythmic stomping of his fans at Ullevi, a football venue in Gothenburg,
 in 1985, damaged the foundation, an episode known in Springsteen lore 
as “the time Bruce broke a stadium.” In Europe, that spirit persists.<br>
<br>
The “Wrecking Ball” tour is likely to go on for a year. James Brown 
played many more shows a year, but he never played so long or with such 
absolute exertion. Some nights, Springsteen stays a little longer in his
 dressing room, ginning himself up for all the running, jumping, and 
screaming, but there is never the thought of taking a pass.<br>
“Once people have bought those tickets, I don’t have that option,” he 
told me. We were alone in a vast, makeshift dressing room in Barcelona. 
“Remember, we’re also running a business here, so there is a commercial 
exchange, and that ticket is my handshake. That ticket is me promising 
you that it’s gonna be all the way every chance I get. That’s my 
contract. And ever since I was a young guy I took that seriously.” 
Although there are nights when, in the dressing room, he feels tapped 
out, the stage always works its magic: “Suddenly the fatigue disappears.
 A transformation takes place. That’s what we’re selling. We’re selling 
that possibility. It’s half a joke: I go out onstage and—snap—‘Are you 
ready to be transformed?’ What? At a rock show? By a guy with a guitar? 
Part of it is a goof, and part of it is, Let’s do it, let’s see if we 
can.”<br>
<br>
One kindness that Springsteen has afforded his body is more days off, 
leaving time for his family, for exercise, for listening to music, 
watching movies, reading. Lately, he has been consumed with Russian 
fiction. “It’s compensatory—what you missed the first time around,” he 
said. “I’m sixty-some, and I think, There are a lot of these Russian 
guys! What’s all the fuss about? So I was just curious. That was an 
incredible book: ‘The Brothers Karamazov.’ Then I read ‘The Gambler.’ 
The social play in the first half was less interesting to me, but the 
second half, about obsession, was fun. That could speak to me. I was a 
big John Cheever fan, and so when I got into Chekhov I could see where 
Cheever was coming from. And I was a big Philip Roth fan, so I got into 
Saul Bellow, ‘Augie March.’ These are all new connections for me. It’d 
be like finding out now that the Stones covered Chuck Berry!”<br>
<br>
Springsteen was sitting near a low table covered with picks, capos, 
harmonicas, and sheets of paper with lists of songs written in thick 
black marker. After sound check, he tries to imagine that night’s 
performance. The rest of the band and the crew are down the hall at 
“catering”—an improvised commissary. Tonight, the menu is veal shank, 
grouper, and various vegetarian options, to say nothing of half a dozen 
kinds of salad and a pâtisserie of desserts. (“Did you try that Spanish 
banana thingy? Amazing!”) The band members wait for Springsteen to 
distribute the night’s set list. The old-timers are calm, but the newer 
members wait with a measure of anxiety. “I’m always flipping out, having
 nightmares that he’s gonna call something that I never even heard of 
fifteen minutes before we go onstage,” Jake Clemons said.<br>
<br>
Thousands of fans, many of whom had been waiting outside since morning, 
were allowed to enter the stadium grounds at six o’clock for a show that
 would not begin until ten. I noticed a few young Spaniards carrying a 
sign, in English, reading, “Bruce, Thanks for Making Our Lives Better.” I
 tried to imagine a sign like that for—whom? Lou Reed? AC/DC? Bon Jovi? 
(“Richie Sambora, Thanks for making our lives better.” Doubtful.) The 
ultra-sincere interchange between Springsteen and his fans, which looks 
treacly to the uninitiated and the uninterested, is what distinguishes 
him and his performances. Forty years on, and an hour before going 
onstage yet again, he was trying to make sense of that transaction.<br>
<br>
“You are isolated, yet you desire to talk to somebody,” Springsteen 
said. “You are very disempowered, so you seek impact, recognition that 
you are alive and that you exist. We hope to send people out of the 
building we play in with a slightly more enhanced sense of what their 
options might be, emotionally, maybe communally. You empower them a 
little bit, they empower you. It’s all a battle against the futility and
 the existential loneliness! It may be that we are all huddled together 
around the fire and trying to fight off that sense of the inevitable. 
That’s what we do for one another.<br>
“I try to put on the kind of show that the kid in the front row is going
 to come to and never forget,” he went on. “Our effort is to stay with 
you, period, to have you join us and to allow us to join you for the 
ride—the whole ride. That’s what we’ve been working on the whole time, 
and this show is the latest installment, and, in many ways, it’s the 
most complicated installment, because in many ways it has to do with the
 end of that ride. There are kids who are coming to the show who will 
never have seen the band with Clarence Clemons in it or Danny 
Federici—people who were in the band for thirty years. So our job is to 
honor the people who stood on that stage by putting on the best show 
we’ve ever put on. To do that, you’ve got to acknowledge your losses and
 your defeats as well as your victories. There is a finiteness to it, 
though the end may be a long time away. We end the night with a party of
 sorts, but it’s not an uncomplicated party. It’s a life party—that’s 
what we try to deliver up.”<br>
<br>
A couple of weeks earlier, one of Springsteen’s beloved aunts died. And 
now, the day before the first concert in Barcelona, Mary Van Zandt, 
Steve’s mother, died, in Red Bank. “When I was a child, deaths came 
regularly,” Springsteen said. “Then there’s a period, unless accidents 
happen, death doesn’t happen, and then you reach a period where it just 
happens regularly again. We’ve entered that part.”<br>
<br>
A little while later, having changed from his regular jeans to his stage
 jeans, Springsteen walked with the band through a stadium tunnel and 
toward the stage. The last thing he saw before heading to the mike and a
 blast of stage lights was a sign taped to the top step that read 
“Barcelona.” A few years ago, at an arena show in Auburn Hills, he kept 
greeting the crowd with shouts of “Hello, Ohio!” Finally, Van Zandt 
pulled him aside and told him they were in Michigan.<br>
<br>
Springsteen glanced at the step and stepped into the spotlight.<br>
<br>
“Hola, Barcelona!” he cried out to a sea of forty-five thousand people. “Hola, Catalunya!” ♦</div>

<br>
DAVE DIMARTINO: They [the crew] all call you the boss? <br>
<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: Well, the thing I have with this "Boss" is funny 
because it came from people like that, who work around you. And then, 
somebody started to do it on the radio. I hate being called "Boss." 
(laughs) I just do. Always did from the beginning. I hate bosses. I hate
 being called the boss. It just started from all the people around me, 
then by somebody on the radio and once that happens, everybody said "Hey
 Boss," and I'd say, "No. Bruce. BRUCE." I always hated that. I always 
hated being called "Boss." <br>
<br>
DD: I have lots of relatives is Jersey, Seaside Heights and Point 
Pleasant. It's a pretty interesting place for somebody to grow up. <br>
<br>
BS: Yeah, it's pretty strange. It's real "away," you know? It's like an 
hour from New York, but it might as well be ten million miles, because 
when I was growing up, I think I wasn't in New York once until I was 
sixteen, except maybe once when my parents took me to see the circus. 
And New York was just so far away. It's funny, because when we first 
came out, everyone tagged us as being a New York band, which we never 
really were. We were down there from Jersey, which was very, very 
different. It's like my sister. She went to New York last year, and said
 "Hey, I went to New York and we couldn't find Fifth Avenue, so we went 
home." (laughs) It was like you just didn't go to New York. It was a 
million miles away. I remember, you didn't talk about it, you didn't 
think about it. It was all very, very local. That's the way those little
 towns and stuff are, you just never get out. <br>
<br>
DD: I remember we'd go to Seaside Heights when we were 14 and 15 years old. It was a good place to pick up girls. <br>
<br>
BS: Yeah. Asbury was where you'd go if you didn't have the gas to get to Seaside Heights. That was a whole other thing. <br>
<br>
DD: Bob Seger told us he saw you in LA and you were going through the 
same problems finishing The River that he had with Against the Wind, 
that you were pulling your hair out. What made you decide you had the 
right songs? Last we heard you pulled a tune off it. <br>
<br>
BS: Well, from the beginning I had an idea of what I felt the record 
should be. And I don't think, I'm not interested in going in the studio 
and (pauses) I don't want to just take up space on the shelf or worry 
that if you don't have something out every six months, or even a year, 
that people are going to forget about you. I was never interested in 
approaching it that way. We never have from the beginning. I have a 
feeling about the best I can do at a particular time, and that's what I 
wanted to do. I don't come out until I feel that, and that's what I've 
done. Because there's so many records coming out, there's so much stuff 
on the shelves, why put out something that you don't feel is what it 
should be, or that you feel - and I don't believe in tomorrows - that 
"Oh, I'll put the other half out six months from now." You don't know 
what's gonna be happening six months from now. You may be dead, you just
 don't know. It's like from the very beginning, I just never believed in
 doing things that way. You make your record like it's the last record 
you'll ever make. You go out and play at night. I don't think if I don't
 play good tonight, I'll play good tomorrow. I don't think that if I 
didn't play good tonight, that, well, I played good last night. It's 
like there's no tomorrows and there's no yesterdays. There's only right 
now. <br>
<br>
DD: You gotta prove it all night, right <br>
<br>
BS: Well that's the thing with the kids. Like if a kid buys a ticket, he
 comes in, tonight is his night. Tonight is the night for you and him, 
you and him are not gonna have this night again. And if you don't take 
it as seriously as he's taking it, I mean, this is his dough, he worked 
for it all week, money's tough now and there's a certain thing... I just
 think you gotta lay it all on the line when you go out there and then I
 feel good afterwards. That's the only way I feel right and it's the 
same thing with the record. <br>
<br>
DD: How do you feel about The River now that it's finished? Are you 100 percent satisfied with it? <br>
<br>
BS: Oh, you're never like that, you're never 100 percent satisfied, 
because you're thinking about all the wrong stuff you did. You always 
think you could've played that one other song, like tonight. When we 
started this tour, we said, "OK. We're not gonna play 'Quarter to 
Three.' We played that the whole last tour, and we're not gonna play it 
this tour. sure enough, we get backstage (tonight) and this is the first
 time we had to come out again one more time, and it's like "What are we
 gonna play? 'Quarter to Three"." So that was probably the swan song of 
that. <br>
<br>
DD: You have to admit that as high as expectations were when you 
produced Darkness, the expectations for this new album were considerably
 higher. Do you think you were a little sensitive or paranoid about the 
final version of this LP? <br>
<br>
BS: No, because nobody's expectations are higher than your own. You do 
what you can do and that's the way it stands. People have their 
expectations and I try to live up to a certain thing I feel myself And I
 know I have strict ideals about the way we do things, the way the band 
does things, so outside forces, they play a secondary role. Like, I know
 when I've done all I can do after a show and I know when I've done all I
 can do when I make a record. And you know when it could be better like 
there was something wrong with the stage or you couldn't quite say what 
you wanted to say. But, you know, people's expectations are gonna be 
what they're gonna be; in the end you're gonna disappoint everybody 
anyway. (laughs) <br>
<br>
DD: OK, but if I were you, I know I'd have been scared. With No Nukes, 
the talk about you as the highlight, the viable screen commodity, all 
building up to the long-awaited LP. All I know I'd be happy as hell to 
be out on the road and not have to deal with all that. <br>
<br>
BS: Yeah, well that's the reality, like you're hit with the reality 
every night. All the other stuff it's like, what's to be frightened of 
That somebody's not gonna like it? That's just not that much, you know? <br>
<br>
DD: On opening night in Ann Arbor you had to stop on occasion because the band hadn't learned the new songs completely. <br>
<br>
BS: Well Ann Arbor, that was a wild show, because I came out and we 
started playing and we went into "Born to Run," which I'd just listened 
to in the dressing room like ten times. <br>
<br>
DD: To try and remember the words? <br>
<br>
BS: Yeah, and I went up to the mike and I couldn't remember the words, 
and I was up there and said, "Oh shit. I don't know these words." And I 
thought, "Not only do I not know these, I don't know any of the others."
 This was all taking place within about five seconds. "What the hell am I
 gonna do?" I mean, you can't stop. And then out in the audience I hear 
"In the day we sweat it... " and it was GREAT And then it was fine. That
 was an amazing audience. <br>
<br>
DD: But how do you feel about that? You seem to be one of the only 
performers that the audience truly loved. Not to flatter you, but it 
seems like you probably haven't been up against an audience that wasn't 
totally familiar with you and hadn't memorized the lyrics of all your 
songs. Do you ever wish you were facing an audience as a complete 
unknown? <br>
<br>
BS: I opened for Black Oak Arkansas. I opened for Brownsville Station 
and I opened for Sha Na Na. I"m 31 and I've been playing in bars since I
 was 15, and I've faced a lot of audiences that don't give a shit that 
you're onstage. And if you're calling percentages, we've had only two to
 five percent nights like tonight against 95 percent in the 10 to 15 
years we've been playing when, let me tell you, that did not happen. 
That does not happen, and it keeps you from ever getting spoiled, 
because you know what it's like when nobody gives a damn when you come 
out there. It keeps you in certain places, it stays with you. There are 
no free rides. When we first started playing, I'd go to every show 
expecting nobody to come, and I'd go onstage expecting nobody to give me
 anything for free. And that's the way you have to play. If you don't 
play like that, pack your guitar up, throw it in the trash can, go home,
 fix televisions, do some other line of work, you know? Do something 
where that's the way you feel about it. And the night I stop thinking 
that way, that's the night I won't do it no more, because that's just 
the bottom line. I don't gauge the show by the audience reaction; I 
don't gauge the show by the review in the paper the next day. I know 
what I did when I'm done, I know how I feel, and I know if I'm 
comfortable when I get on the bus to go to the next town. I know if I 
feel good and I know if I feel bad. I know if I can go to sleep easy 
that night. That's the way that we judge it and that's the way that we 
run it. And if we didn't, that noise that you were hearing, that would 
not be happening in the first place. <br>
<br>
DD: Do you ever worry about that? Do you think that might not happen in the future, that you might not give your all? <br>
<br>
BS: No. I'm not that kind of person. I don't have any fear about that 
because, I guess, I have other things that are much more frightening 
that keep me from falling into that. <br>
<br>
DD: What's it like these days getting recognized? <br>
<br>
BS: People don't recognize me that much. They don't. If you go around 
humming "Badlands" or something (laughs), they might. People just don't 
look for you. They recognize you outside the show, but it just doesn't 
happen otherwise. I mean, back home, if I go around a bar or something 
on a Saturday afternoon, forget it. <br>
<br>
DD: Do you still do that? <br>
<br>
BS: Yeah I do that. I mean that's what you do when you go home, there's 
nothing else to do when you go home. But if you do that in the bars back
 home, most of the time people do recognize you so they don't bother 
you. It depends. It just doesn't happen to the point where it really 
bothers you or something. It just doesn't happen. <br>
<br>
DD: Do you get approached frequently to produce other artists or appear 
on their records? I know you just worked with Gary US Bonds. <br>
<br>
BS: Some bands, yeah. Some people ask me, but I can't go in there and do
 things the way I do my own records, I just wouldn't feel right doing 
it. I wouldn't feel right, behind them, you know. And plus, I am not a 
producer. I've always felt that essentially I'm a playing musician, 
that's what I've done the longest. I'm a playing musician. I go out on 
the road and play, we do live rock 'n' roll shows and everybody has a 
good time. And then on the side, after that, I write the songs and make 
albums, but I feel most like myself when I'm playing, when we're doing 
shows. <br>
<br>
DD: Dave Marsh's book was obviously a great success. What are your feelings about it? <br>
<br>
BS: Yeah, that was terrific, that was really exciting. You know, we 
didn't put an album out for that whole year and then came the book, and 
kids would come up with it and say "Hey, sign the book." It was really 
just a nice thing for everybody. <br>
<br>
DD: The guys in the band, you've all been friends for years and all 
that. When Marsh's book came out there was a big deal about you, the 
picture on the cover of you smiling, did the guys come up to you and say
 "Oh, come on Bruce. We all know'you're just a little shit." <br>
<br>
BS: No. (laughs) It's like you don't think that much about it. Most of 
the people I'm with have been my friends for a long time, in my band, 
and they're all in the book. I mean, since I was 16 I've known Steve. 
You just sit there and look at the book and there's all those things 
happening, but you just accept those things happening. <br>
<br>
DD: With your success you've created a familiar "Springsteen sound." 
When you hear new artists that seem to Imitate your sound do you think 
about what you've created? <br>
<br>
BS: No, I never have those particular feelings. Myself I've been 
influenced by so much music. Even on the new album there's some Johnny 
and the Hurricanes kind of stuff I don't think about it. <br>
<br>
DD: How, did your involvement with Gary US Bonds come about? <br>
<br>
BS: We met in a bar right by my house and we just started talking. He's 
just a great guy with a great voice. He's just got this voice, and 
there's only one of this voice. The stuff on his records didn't have 
that sound. That sound was him, that was his voice, and when he sings, 
that's what he sounds like. There was a situation because of the nature 
of the music business where there was so many people. What happened was 
that the music business changed from where there were writers and 
singers and producers. Now a kid comes up and he's got to do everything.
 Well, that's no good, because people don't do everything good. That's 
why there are so many bad albums, because people don't do everything 
good. Maybe someone's a hell of a producer, maybe some kid is a hell of a
 songwriter or a great singer, or maybe some kid ain't a good singer and
 songwriter. They're sort of forced by the way the thing is based now to
 attempt to do all these things. They think they should. In the '60s, 
what happened was you had all these tremendous people out there, these 
great singers particularly, who were popular back then, who were just 
stopped, run over, you know. In a flash, 20 years old. Now, they just 
don't fit in, they don't fit the structure of the music business. Who is
 their audience? Gary was like that. Gary's a great singer, but it's 
hard now. It's hard to get people to pay attention. <br>
<br>
DD: Do you wonder what your record might sound like if you didn't produce yourself? <br>
<br>
BS: Our method now is a very personal way of recording, where somebody 
coming in from the outside would have a difficult time. We wrote and 
recorded about 48 songs [for The River] and at one time I thought they 
were all gonna be on (laughs). And somebody sitting there seeing four 
albums being recorded, well, you gotta be in it for life, you know? To 
just have the patience and the perseverance. And we recorded that stuff 
real fast, there was not a lot of overdubbing, not a lot of takes even. 
We just recorded so much stuff. <br>
<br>
DD: What was the major criteria for the completion of the album, the selection of songs? <br>
<br>
BS: I'd say the main thing was trying to focus on exactly what I wanted 
on the album, and what I wanted to do with the characters. Like on 
Darkness, that stopped at a certain point. Well, what happens now? I 
don't feel different every six months, it takes a while. What I wanted 
to do, and what I hoped was working out was those little four-song 
albums they tried to put out for a while, I don't know if they're gonna 
keep doing it or not, those "Nu Disks" [10" EPs like Black Market Clash,
 circa 1979] or whatever you call 'em. I wanted to, from time to time, 
release those with all the stuff that's in the can and all the stuff 
that for one reason or another didn't make it on. I wanted to put those 
out in between albums so that it was a different kind of thing. I don't 
think they're gonna make those anymore. <br>
<br>
DD: How did you end up on [Lou Reed's] Street Hassle? <br>
<br>
BS: He called me up in the studio, it was funny. We were at the Record 
Plant; I hadn't really met him and I liked his stuff I always really 
liked it. He called me up and said I've got this part," and it was 
related to Born to Run," I guess, in some way, and said "Come on 
upstairs," and he had these words, and I went upstairs... <br>
<br>
DD: And you read them. <br>
<br>
BS: Yeah, and so I did it once, no, I think I did it twice, and he just picked one and I was real happy. <br>
<br>
DD: Did you enjoy the No Nukes shows? <br>
<br>
BS: That was great. That was one of the favorite shows that we ever did.
 I liked working with all those different people. What happened was when
 we first started, the way we got to playing by ourselves was 
inadvertent. We never meant to do shows by ourselves. But we couldn't 
get on any other tours. People will tell you today, if you're a new 
band, you can't get on other tours, people won't take you out. And if 
you're good, then forget about it. You're never gonna make it out. So, 
at the time, we were doing pick-up shows for absolutely anybody that 
would put us on. But it got to a point where just nobody would put us 
on, we couldn't get any shows. So we started playing clubs by ourselves.
 Then eventually the shows started getting longer and developed into 
what it is. But the thing about the Nukes show was we only played an 
hour, and it was fun (laughs), because you could go like a runaway train
 in an hour. We could come off and dance around the block after that, so
 it was funny. And I wanted to do something with that, and it was just 
one of the best things. I felt real good about it. <br>
<br>
DD: I was told you plan to be on tour until next summer. <br>
<br>
BS: Because I want to play in the summertime this year. I just miss 
doing that, I miss travelling around and playing in the summertime. We 
haven't done that in a while. We're gonna do this tour, and then it 
stops for Christmas a little while, and then we go to Canada, and then 
the South and then overseas. I want to do that because we've never been 
overseas, we've only been overseas for four shows, and that was in 1975.
 We've only done two shows in England and that was the kind of shows 
that, well, one was the kind of show that, when I think back upon it, 
was the kind of show that I don't want our shows to go. That was the 
worst, and that was when I was real down. <br>
<br>
DD: Talking about moods, I thought that the Wild and Innocent LP had a 
real happy mood to it across the whole record. Born to Run was a mixed 
bag, but one of the reasons I especially liked Darkness was its 
consistency of mood. It ultimately seemed very depressing, especially 
"Racing in the Street." Are there any kind of moods on the new LP that 
you can put your finger on? <br>
<br>
BS: Well, it's different. When I did Darkness, I was very focused on one
 particular idea, one particular feeling that I wanted to do. In the 
show there are all sorts of things, there's a wide range of emotion. <br>
<br>
DD: But when I listen to Darkness, I wanna go slit my wrists. <br>
<br>
BS: Yeah. Like you say, that's my favorite record, Darkness, so this 
time one of the things that I felt was that on Darkness, I didn't make 
room for certain (pauses) things, you know. Because I just couldn't 
understand how you could feel so good and so bad at the same time. And 
it was very confusing to me. "Sherry Darling" was gonna be on Darkness, 
"Independence Day" was a song that was gonna be on Darkness, and the 
song I wrote right after Darkness was "Point Blank" which takes that 
thing to its furthest. Because at the time, I remember because Jon asked
 me, I said "Jon, I just can't see all this different stuff being on it 
because it's gonna be too confusing for people," and he said "No, it's 
not gonna be too confusing for people," and I said, "Well, I guess it's 
gonna be too confusing for me." It just is that way for me right now, 
for some reason. <br>
<br>
DD: I was surprised that there weren't any razor blades attached to the LP. <br>
<br>
BS: Yeah, well it wasn't meant to be that way. After Born to Run and all
 that stuff I felt that was just the way it was. And so when I did this 
album, I tried to accept the fact that, you know, the world is a 
paradox, and that's the way it is. And the only thing you can do with a 
paradox is live with it. I wanted to do that this time out; I wanted to 
live with particularly conflicting emotions, because I always person 
ally, in a funny kind of way, lean toward the Darkness kind of material.
 When I didn't put the album out in '79, it was because I didn't feel 
that that was there, I felt that that was missing and I didn't feel that
 that was right. And even when the band says "Why isn't this on it, why 
isn't that on it," what do you say, "Gee. I don't know"? It was 
something where I just got a bigger picture of it, I felt, what things 
are, of the way things work, and I tried to just learn to be able to 
live with that. I mean, how can you live when sometimes things are so 
beautiful, and I know it sounds corny but... <br>
<br>
DD: So I'm gonna listen to The River and I'm gonna feel that paradox' you're talking about? <br>
<br>
BS: I think so. In the end, I think that's the emotion. What I wanted was just the paradox of those things. <br>
<br>
DD: Did a lot of the time spent in deciding what tracks went on the LP 
work to this whole approach of balance? Does the paradox correspond to 
the way you personally feel? <br>
<br>
BS: Well there's the thing where a lot of stuff just ROCK rocks, and 
that was the main thing. There's a lot of idealistic stuff on there, 
there's a lot of stuff that, hey, you can listen to it and laugh at it 
or whatever, some of it is very idealistic, and I wanted that all on 
there. At first, I wasn't gonna put it all on there, but sometimes I 
just feel those things. Sometimes when I'm playing... like life just 
ain't this good, you know? And it just ain't. And it may never ever be. 
But that doesn't make those emotions not real. Because they are real and
 they happen. And that stuff happens onstage a lot, when people sing 
some of the songs it's like a community thing that happens that don't 
happen in the street. You go out on the street and it's just a dream. 
Hey, that's the way it's supposed to be. And a lot of songs we do now, 
they're just dreams, but they're based on an emotion that's very real, 
and they're always being possibilities. To say no to that stuff is 
wrong, to say no to it is wrong and to give yourself to it is a lie. To 
give yourself over is an illusion. On the album I was interested in, I 
saw it as romantic. It's a romantic record and to me, romantic is when 
you see realities and when you understand the realities, but you also 
see the possibilities. And sometimes you write about things as they are,
 and sometimes you write about them as they should be, as they could be,
 maybe, you know? And that's basically what I wanted to do. And you 
can't say no to either thing. If you say no, you're cheating yourself 
out of feelings that are important and should be a part of you. <br>
<br>
DD: Do you have a girlfriend now? Do you find yourself lacking the time 
for strong relationships like that and does it affect your material? <br>
<br>
BS: That always affects you, and I've always had a girlfriend, same one 
now that I've been going out with for a couple of years, and that always
 affects a lot of things. The band, some of the guys are in their 30s, 
some are in their early 20s, and I realize that you think different 
then, you don't think the same way you did when you were 20, and I try 
to stay in tune to that fact. And the music I write has, I think, those 
extra 10 years in there. And there's other guys who do other things, 
younger things, and they say that, you know? And on this record, it was 
funny, some of the guys got married, some... it was just a sense of the 
conflict everybody feels; you want to be a part of it. You want to walk 
down the street and feel that you're a part of all those people. There's
 a combination with people where you're drawn to being with them, while 
at the same time you're horrified by them, repulsed by them, scared by 
them. That was the other thing I hoped I was gonna be able to get in the
 record, that you have both of those feelings and they're both real and 
they're both honest and that that's the way it is. <br>
<br>
DD: I'm sure you agree that while there's "x," amount of words and "x" 
amount of melodies, the combination of both is unlimited as are the 
effects. One of the strong points of Darkness, I thought, was the 
conflict of moods between both. <br>
<br>
BS: It was different, yeah at the end of Darkness, the guy ends up feeling very isolated. <br>
<br>
DD: There are parallels, between that character's feelings and your own 
life, starting out as a happy guy with happy music. that suddenly ends 
up on the cover of tons of magazines. How, much of that music is about a
 character and how, much is about yourself? <br>
<br>
BS: Every guy that writes a song is writing about himself in the most 
general way I'm talking, like it comes outta you. Why did it come out of
 you? And all the facts are changed, you think up a lot of stuff and 
some stuff is real, I don't know. I had a funny... New Jersey was funny.
 It was very insulated. I grew up playing in bars since I was 15 and I 
always liked my job. I liked going down to that club, and if I made $35 a
 week or whatever, it didn't matter because I liked the job I was doing 
and I was enjoying it. I was lucky enough that from when I was very 
young, I was able to make my living at it. And it went along and, I 
mean, I never knew anyone who made a record, I never knew anyone who 
knew anyone who even knew anyone in the professional music business. 
(laughs) We didn't even brush up against people like that back then, you
 were away from it. You weren't there. And that's the way it was same 
bunch of guys, same town. And when I got out more, well, things changed.
 You get older and things change. I mean, I liked my job. <br>
<br>
DD: Do the guys in the band miss going out and playing? <br>
<br>
BS: That's the way it is. People miss it, but, believe it or not, I'm going as fast as I can. (laughs) <br>
<br>
DD: Is that really true? <br>
<br>
BS: I was burning up man, let me tell you, I ain't kidding you. (laughs)
 The stuff is really... like we didn't do a whole lot of takes of each 
song. I don't think there's a song on there that went anymore than ten 
takes, and most of them were done under five. The only overdubbing is 
vocal overdubbing, and that's not on everything. Most of the stuff we 
recorded very fast, and when you get a chance to listen to it, we 
recorded it in a big room and we got a real hard drum sound. Of them 
all, I think it's the album that most captures what happens when we 
play. But it's the kind of thing where I don't know if I'll ever make 
records fast, because I don't see the point in making them fast. <br>
<br>
DD: Well, there's a view, in the rock world that you should go in bang 
them out as it's more spontaneous that way. Would you say The River is 
spontaneous? <br>
<br>
BS: It is very spontaneous. Spontaneity, number one, is not made by 
fastness. Elvis, I believe, did like 30 takes of "Hound Dog," and you 
can put THAT thing on. The idea is to sound spontaneous. I mean it's to 
be spontaneous, but it's like these records come out that were done real
 fast and they sound like they were done real fast. If I thought I 
could've made a better record in half the time, that's exactly what I 
would've done. Because, I would've rather been out playing. It's the 
kinda thing where, I mean, I know what I'm listening to when I hear it 
played back, and I just had particular guidelines. And one thing, it's 
not a musically put together record. I mean, the performances were fast.
 I think the thing that takes the most time is the thinking, the 
conceptual thing. It takes a certain amount of time for me to think 
about exactly what it is I wanna do, and then I gotta wait until I 
finally realize that I've actually done it. You know, we made the Gary 
US Bonds thing real fast, and a lot of the things on this were made very
 fast It's just the ALBUM that took a long time. <br>
<br>
DD: Why did you change your opinion about bootlegs? <br>
<br>
BS: I felt that there was a point there where, when it first started, a 
lot of bootlegs were made by fans, there was more of a connection. But 
it became, there was a point where there were just so many. Just so many
 that it was big business. It was made by people who, you know, they 
didn't care what the quality was. It just got to the point where I'd 
walk in and see a price tag of $30 on a record of mine that, to me, 
really sounded bad, and I just thought it was a rip. I thought I was 
getting ripped, I wrote the music, the songs - it all came out of me! 
And I felt it was a rip, and the people who were doing it had warehouses
 full of records and were just sitting back, getting fat, rushing and 
putting out anything and getting 30 fucking dollars for it. And I just 
got really mad about it at one point. <br>
<br>
DD: Are you ever gonna come out with some of this live stuff? I've got some that I like just because I'm a fan. <br>
<br>
BS: I don't know. I have a hard time listening to them, because I always
 hear the bad things. I guess the main thing is that I just want to make
 a live record. The plan was to do a live one after this one. <br>
<br>
DD: Some of the stuff is great like the CBS tape of "Santa Claus" and 
the Greg Kihn song "Rendezvous." Why did you give that away? Did it 
sound too much like a Born to Run song? <br>
<br>
BS: That song I wrote in about five minutes before a rehearsal one day. 
We played it on tour and we liked it, and I liked him because I liked 
the way he did "For You" on that early album, and we just had it around 
and I told him "Hey, we got this song that we're not recording now." 
That's mainly how some of those songs got out. I just wrote them fast. <br>
<br>
DD: I remember you playing tunes like "Independence Day," "The Ties That
 Bind" and "Point Blank" two years ago. Were those written for Darkness 
but just didn't fit your concept? <br>
<br>
BS: The reason they got thrown out was because of this thing I was 
telling you about, the way I felt about the Darkness album. I don't 
know, that's just the way I felt about them at the time. <br>
<br>
DD: Are you your own worst critic? <br>
<br>
BS: I think you certainly should be. That's the way you have to be. You have to be most severe with yourself <br>
<br>
DD: Do you anticipate a large critical backlash after being on top for so long? <br>
<br>
BS: That stuff happens all the time, besides, that's happened to me 
already, I've lived that already. And it's the kind of thing that just 
happens; people write good things and then they don't. The first time I 
went through that it was confusing for me, it was disheartening. I guess
 I felt that I knew what I wanted to do and what I was about. The same 
old story when I was 25 when that first happened and I'd been playing 
for 10 years. Now I'm 31, so I went through that. When you first come up
 and people start writing about you, you're just not used to it. It's 
just strange. There were a lot of things that brought me real down at 
the time, and there were a lot of things that brought me real up. I was 
very susceptible to being immediately emotionally affected by something 
like that at the time. But I went through it, I saw it happen, I saw how
 it happens. I was younger and I was much more insecure. I hadn't put 
the time in that we've put in since then, and seen some of the things 
that happened since then happen. I've seen all sides of the music thing,
 and now, whatever happens is only gonna be a shadow of that moment. So 
if a lot of people wrote a lot of good stuff and then they wrote a lot 
of bad stuff whatever happens, it happens. You have a concern about it, 
because I spent a long time and put a lot into doing a record. Same old 
story, anybody who says it ain't a heartbreaker, it ain't true. (laughs)
 But that's the way things are, and I'm at a point now where I got a 
better perspective on a lot of those things. <br>
<br>
DD: Any changes is the future? <br>
<br>
BS: No, I don't see changing the particular way that I do that thing right now, because... <br>
<br>
DD: You're happy. <br>
<br>
BS: Yeah. Because if I felt that if I was just sitting there and 
squeezing the life out of the music, I wouldn't do it. But that's not 
what happens, that's not what we do. The physical act is not what takes 
the time, I mean, this was our fifth album. We rented the studio. We 
knew how to make a record. As fast or slow as we wanted to, you know? 
The physical thing is not the story, it's how you feel inside about it, 
and that don't run on any clock, just how you feel inside. Just where 
you are today and what your record is gonna be saying out there, and 
what the people that buy that record are going to feel and get from it. I
 had an idea, and I wasn't going to go half way with it, wasn't no point
 in it. Like I said, I don't trust no tomorrows on that kind of thing. 
And I'd rather do the time and the time is no fun to do because if I 
didn't do the time there, I couldn't walk out there on that stage. We're
 going to be playing a lot of shows, and we're going to be out there for
 a real long time. And when I go out there at night, I just like to feel
 like myself like I've done what I have to do. And when I play those 
songs onstage, I know those songs, I know what went into them and I know
 where I stand. And people will and people will not like it, but I know 
that it's real. I know that it's there.</div>

<br>
<br>
While waiting to find out if his second Oscar-nominated song, "Dead Man 
Walking," will turn into a second win, Bruce Springsteen talks to the 
gay press for the first time<br>
<br>
The Advocate , 1996<br>
By Judy Wieder<br>
<br>
"The bonus I got out of writing 'Streets of Philadelphia' was that all 
of a sudden I could go out and meet some gay man somewhere and he 
wouldn't be afraid to talk to me and say, 'Hey, that song really meant 
something to me.' My image had always been very heterosexual, very 
straight. So it was a nice experience for me, a chance to clarify my own
 feelings about gay and lesbian civil rights," says rock's most 
thoughtful megastar, Bruce Springsteen. Sitting in the dimly lit living 
room of a West Hollywood hotel suite, the man the world calls "the Boss"
 is talking about his 1994 Oscar and Grammy award-winning song from the 
film Philadelphia- a song detailing the feelings of a gay man facing the
 final turmoil of his struggle with AIDS. <br>
<br>
Now, with his second Oscar nominated song, "Dead Man Walking," and his 
stark new acoustic album, The Ghost of Tom Joad, the 46 year-old 
Springsteen seems relieved to have returned once again to the 
deliberately noncommercial core of his best social-commentary- 
songwriting skills. Like "Streets of Philadelphia" and 1982's daring 
Nebraska- recorded on his home tape recorder- Springsteen's latest album
 and tour strip his muscular stadium rock down to a dark one-man stage 
show. No E Street Band, no mania-driven masses waving lighters from the 
balconies and shrieking "Bru-u-u-ce!" Just Springsteen, alone onstage, 
singing out from the shadows of all that's gone wrong between people in 
the world today. <br>
<br>
For many skeptics, the idea of a hard-core rocker from the mean streets 
of New Jersey growing up, growing rich, and aligning himself with those 
who have not is pretty far-fetched. Yet that's essentially the 
Springsteen way. Although he has sold millions of albums, filled 
thousands of concert arenas, and won mantelsful of Grammy and American 
Music awards, over the years he's still managed to lend his support 
directly or indirectly to people and causes as diverse as Amnesty 
International,feeding the starving in Africa ("We Are the World"), the 
plight of immigrants, AIDS awareness, and the struggles of gays and 
lesbians. "After Bruce supported me by appearing on my VHl special last 
year, we became friends," says out lesbian rocker Melissa Etheridge. 'I 
think the experience of having his song in Philadelphia led him to meet a
 lot of gay people and learn a lot about our lives. My girlfriend, 
Julie, is always with me when we go to his house, and he always treats 
us as a couple. I've often talked to him about my frustration over not 
being able to get legally married, and he's always supportive and 
sympathetic." <br>
<br>
Springsteen's own struggles with finding love and settling down have 
been well-documented in both his songs and the press. After his 
herculean 11-year rise to superstardom- which began with Greetings From 
Asbury Park N.J. in 1973 and culminated in 1984 with Born in the U.S.A.-
 he married model-actress Julianne Phillips. The marriage ended in the 
tabloids four years later when Springsteen fell in love with his backup 
singer, Patti Scialfa. They were married in 1991 and have three 
children. <br>
<br>
Do you think you'll win another Oscar for your song "Dead Man Walking"? <br>
<br>
[Laughing] Oh, I don't know. When those Disney pictures are out there 
[Pocahontas], you don't stand a chance. "Dead Man Walking" is another 
song that's pretty offbeat, so I am not really expecting one. <br>
<br>
Still, offbeat subject matter served you well in "Streets of 
Philadelphia." You say you're pleased that gays and lesbians began 
approaching you after that song? <br>
<br>
Oh, yeah! I had people come up to me in the streets or in restaurants 
and say, "I have a friend" or "I have a lover" or "I have a partner" or 
"I have a son." <br>
<br>
Why do you think Jonathan Demme - the director - asked you to write a song for Philadelphia? <br>
<br>
Demme told me that Philadelphia was a movie he was making "for the 
malls." I'm sure that was one of the reasons why he called me, I think 
he wanted to take a subject that people didn't feel safe with and were 
frightened by and put it together with people that they did feel safe 
with like Tom Hanks or me or Neil Young. I always felt that was my job. <br>
<br>
How could you make people feel safe? <br>
<br>
When I first started in rock, I had a big guy's audience for my early 
records. I had a very straight image, particularly through the mid '80s.
 <br>
<br>
But why could you reach them? <br>
<br>
I knew where the fear came from. I was brought up in a small town, and I
 basically received nothing but negative images about homosexuality-very
 bad. Anybody who was different in any fashion was castigated and 
ostracized, if not physically threatened. <br>
<br>
Did you have some personal inspiration for the song? <br>
<br>
I had a very close friend who had a sarcoma cancer and died right around
 that time. For me, it was a very devastating experience, being close to
 illness of that magnitude. I had never experienced what it calls on or 
asks of the people around the person who is so ill. Part of that 
experience ended up in the song. <br>
<br>
You caught a particular isolation that many gay AIDS patients 
experience. When there are walls between people and there is a lack of 
acceptance, you can reach for that particular kind of communion: 
"receive me, brother" is the lyric in the last verse. <br>
<br>
That's all anybody's asking for-basically some sort of acceptance and to
 not be left alone. There was a certain spiritual stillness that I 
wanted to try to capture. Then I just tried to send in a human voice, as
 human a voice as I possibly could. I wanted you to be in somebody's 
head, hearing their thoughts-somebody who was on the cusp of death but 
still experiencing the feeling of being very alive. <br>
<br>
Were you surprised the song was a hit? <br>
<br>
I would never have thought in a million years it was going to get radio 
airplay. But people were looking for things to assist them in making 
sense of the AIDS crisis, in making human connections. I think that is 
what film and art and music do; they can work as a map of sorts for your
 feelings. <br>
<br>
Because you come from the streets of New Jersey, was there a personal 
journey for you in accepting and learning about homosexuality? Did it 
ever frighten you? <br>
<br>
I don't know if frighten would be the right word. I was pretty much a 
misfit in my own town, so I didn't buy a lot of those negative 
attitudes. Sure, you are affected and influenced by them. But I think 
that your entire life is a process of sorting out some of those early 
messages that you got. I guess the main thing was that the gay image 
back then was the '50s image, the town queen or something, and that was 
all anyone really knew about homosexuality. Everybody's attitudes were 
quite brutal. It was that real ugly part of the American character. <br>
<br>
When you said you were a misfit, what did you mean? <br>
<br>
Basically, I was pretty ostracized in my hometown. Me and a few other 
guys were the town freaks- and there were many occasions when we were 
dodging getting beaten up ourselves. So, no, I didn't feel a part of 
those homophobic ideas. Also, I started to play in clubs when I was l 6 
or 17, and I was exposed to a lot of different lifestyles and a lot of 
different things. It was the '60s, and I was young, I was open-minded, 
and I wasn't naturally intolerant. I think the main problem was that 
nobody had any real experience with gay culture, so your impression of 
it was incredibly narrow. <br>
<br>
So you actually met gay people? <br>
<br>
Yeah, I had gay friends. The first thing I realized was that everybody's
 different, and it becomes obvious that all of the gay stereotypes are 
ridiculous. [Laughs] I did pretty good with it. <br>
<br>
Because of your macho rock image, I didn't know if you were going to 
tell me, "Oh, yeah, there were years when I didn't want anybody to feel 
that I had any sympathy for that." <br>
<br>
No, I always felt that amongst my core fans- because there was a level 
of popularity that I had in the mid '80s that was sort of a bump on the 
scale- they fundamentally understood the values that are at work in my 
work. Certainly tolerance and acceptance were at the forefront of my 
music. If . my work was about anything, it was about the search for 
identity, for personal recognition, for acceptance, for communion, and 
for a big country. I've always felt that's why people come to my shows, 
because they feel that big country in their hearts. <br>
<br>
You mean a country big enough for everyone? <br>
<br>
Yes. Unfortunately, once you get a really big audience, then people come
 for a lot of different reasons. And they can misunderstand the songs. <br>
<br>
You even had to deal with President Reagan thinking "Born in the U.S.A." was about his values. <br>
<br>
Yes, at that one point the country moved to the right, and there was a 
lot of nastiness, intolerance, and attitudes that gave rise to more 
intolerance. So I'm always in the process of trying to clarify who I am 
and what I do. That's why I wanted to talk to you. <br>
<br>
On The Ghost of Tom Joad, you have a song, "Balboa Park," and in it you 
say, "Where the men in their Mercedes / Come nightly to employ... / The 
services of the border boys." Are you talking about drugs or sex or 
both? <br>
<br>
I'm talking about sex, hustling. <br>
<br>
What do you know about this subject? <br>
<br>
I read about it in a series of articles the Los Angeles Times did about 
border life. It fit into the rest of the subject matter in the album. <br>
<br>
It's impossible for most people to imagine the kind of fame you have. 
Everyone in the world knows who you are. Does it make you feel 
alienated? <br>
<br>
The only thing I can say about having this type of success is that you 
can get yourself in trouble because basically the world is set open for 
you. People will say yes to anything you ask, so it's basically down to 
you and what you want or need. Yes, you can get isolated with an 
enormous amount of fame or wealth. You can also get isolated with a 
six-pack of beer and a television set. I grew up in a community where 
plenty of people were isolated in that fashion. <br>
<br>
How do you keep your personal life connected to the real world? <br>
<br>
Over the years I think you may have to strive for some normalcy. Like 
you need to say, "Hey, I'm not going to lock myself up in my house 
tonight. I'm going to go to the movies or maybe down to a club or take 
my kids to Universal Studios." <br>
<br>
What keeps you connected? <br>
<br>
You have to want to be included. I always saw myself as the kid who got 
the guitar and was going to hold it for a while and play it and pass it 
on to somebody else. I always saw a lot of myself in my audience. <br>
<br>
But that changed when you got so big. <br>
<br>
True, and by anybody's measure I have an extravagant lifestyle. But I 
never felt that I've lost myself in it. I want to feel that essential 
spiritual connection that you make with your deep audience, your true 
audience. <br>
<br>
So that's how you've kept it balanced? <br>
<br>
Yeah. I just felt that what I was doing was rooted in a community- 
either real or imagined- and that my connection to that community was 
what made my writing and singing matter. I didn't feel that those 
connections were casual connections. I felt that they were essential 
connections. I was a serious young man, you know? I had serious ideas 
about rock music. Yeah, it was also a circus and fun and a dance party- 
all of those things- but still a serious thing. I believed that serious 
things could be done with it. It had a power; it had a voice. I still 
fucking believe that. I really do. <br>
<br>
And I assume that your being here today means that you want gays and 
lesbians to feel they're a part of this community-this big country? <br>
<br>
Yeah, very much so. The ongoing clarification of the way I feel, of my 
ideas, where I stand on different issues: That's my work now. That's why
 this interview is a great opportunity for me. Hey- you write, and you 
want your music understood. <br>
<br>
When you fell in love with your wife Patti, there was a lot of 
negativity in the press because your marriage to Julianne Phillips was 
breaking up. Did your experience with this kind of intrusion into your 
private life give you any idea what it's like for gays and lesbians, who
 constantly get criticized for who they love? <br>
<br>
It's a strange society that assumes it has the right to tell people whom
 they should love and whom they shouldn't. But the truth is, I basically
 ignored the entire thing as much as I could. I said, "Well, all I know 
is, this feels real, and maybe I have got a mess going here in some 
fashion, but that's life." <br>
<br>
But that's everything: This feels real. <br>
<br>
That's it. Trust yourself in the end. Those are the only lights that can
 go by, and the world will catch up. But I think it would be much more 
difficult to be gay, particularly in the town that I grew up in. Divorce
 may have been difficult for me, but I don't know what it would be like 
to have . your heart in one place and have somebody say, "Hey, you can't
 do that." So all anybody can do is do their best. Like when President 
Clinton came into office, the first thing he tried to do was have gays 
in the military. I thought, Wow! A leader. I just felt that was leading.
 <br>
<br>
What did you feel when it all fell apart? <br>
<br>
Initially I felt surprised at the reaction. I was surprised that it was 
such a big deal. But that's what the federal government is supposed to 
do: It is supposed to encourage tolerance. If you can't get acceptance, 
tolerance will have to do. Acceptance will come later. That's what the 
laws are for. So I was saddened by the fate of the whole thing and the 
beating that he took. <br>
<br>
Were you surprised when Melissa Etheridge was able to come out and still have success in rock and roll? <br>
<br>
It was tremendously groundbreaking. The rock world is a funny world, a 
world where simultaneously there is a tremendous amount of macho 
posturing and homophobia- a lot of it, in my experience- and yet it has 
as its basic rule the idea that you are supposed to be who you are. When
 I first heard about Melissa, I was very happy to see that that was 
where some of the seeds of what I had done had fallen. I said, "Wow, a 
lesbian rock singer who came up through the gay bars! I don't believe 
it!" [Laughing] I felt really good about it. <br>
<br>
I understand you and Patti and Melissa and her Julie have become friends. <br>
<br>
We have gotten to know each other since her VHl special. Since then, we've got a nice relationship going. <br>
<br>
She told me she's talked with you about the fight gays and lesbians are 
in to have the right to be legally married. Some people, especially 
heterosexuals, think it isn't that important. I've had well meaning 
people say, "But you know that loving is all that's important. Getting 
married isn't." <br>
<br>
It does matter. It does matter. There was actually a long time when I 
was coming from the same place: "Hey, what's the difference? You have 
got the person you care about." I know that I went through a divorce, 
and it was really difficult and painfuL and I was very frightened about 
getting married again. So part of me said, Hey, what does it matter? But
 it does matter. It's very different than just living together. First of
 all, stepping up publicly- which is what you do: You get your license, 
you do all the social rituals- is a part of your place in society and in
 some way part of society's acceptance of you. <br>
<br>
You and Patti decided you needed that? <br>
<br>
Yes, Patti and I both found that it did mean something. Coming out and 
saying whom you love, how you feel about them, in a public way was very,
 very important. Those are the threads of society; that's how we all 
live together in some fashion. There is no reason I can see why gays and
 lesbians shouldn't get married. It is important because those are the 
things that bring you in and make you feel a part of the social fabric. 
The idea that Melissa and Julie can't be married- that seems ridiculous 
to me. Ridiculous! <br>
<br>
So you, a rock star, a symbol of counterculture earlier in your life, have come to defend the importance of traditions? <br>
<br>
Yeah, oh, yeah. It's like, my kids are sort of little heathens at the 
moment. [Laughs] They have no particular religious information. Ten 
years ago I would have said, "Who cares? They'll figure it out on their 
own." But you are supposed to provide some direction for your children. 
So you look for institutions that can speak to you and that you can feel
 a part of and be a part of and that will allow you to feel included and
 be a part of the community. <br>
<br>
What about gays and lesbians having children? <br>
<br>
Being a good or bad parent is not something that hinges on your 
particular sexual preference. I think that people have some idea of what
 the ideal parent is. I don't know any ideal parents. I have met single 
mothers who are doing an incredible job of raising their kids. I don't 
feel sexual preference is a central issue. <br>
<br>
You have three children. What would you do if one of them came to you and said, "I think I'm gay"? <br>
<br>
Whatever their sexual preference might be when they grow up, I think 
accepting the idea that your child has his own life is the hardest thing
 to do. That life begins, and you can see it the minute they hit the 
boards. I think when I was growing up, that was difficult for my dad- to
 accept that I wasn't like him, I was different. Or maybe I was like 
him, and he didn't like that part of himself- more likely. I was gentle,
 and generally that was the kind of kid I was. I was a sensitive kid. I 
think most of the people who move into the arts are. But basically, for 
me, that lack of acceptance was devastating, really devastating. <br>
<br>
Your father didn't accept you? <br>
<br>
Yeah, and it was certainly one of the most devastating experiences. I 
think your job as a parent is to try to nurture and guide. If one of my 
kids came and said that to me- hey, you want them to find happiness, you
 want them to find fulfillment. So they're the ones who are going to 
have to decide what that is for them. <br>
<br>
Does it get harder and harder for you, in terms of being a father, as your children define themselves more and more? <br>
<br>
Yeah, because you are caught up with your children's identities. You try
 not to be rigid, but you do find out the places where you are rigid. 
And you do get caught up in really some of the great cliches of 
parenting, whether it is wanting them to excel at some particular sport-
 I mean, really, just some of the dumbest things. <br>
<br>
It's hard to separate? <br>
<br>
Yeah, it's the separation. <br>
<br>
And then to have your child's sexuality be different from your own, that would be difficult, right? <br>
<br>
I think that with a lot of these issues, you just don't know until they 
truly enter your life in some really personal way. You have your lights 
that you are trying to steer by, everybody has those. But then you have 
all that stuff that's been laid on you that you're working your way 
through. Sure, I can sit back and say I know how I would want to react. I
 know what I would want to say and how I would want to feel. But unless 
those things enter my life in some personal fashion, I don't know how I 
will act. <br>
<br>
I think that is very honest. Do you have any family members who are gay? <br>
<br>
No. [Laughing] I have a very eccentric family, but, no, nobody gay in my immediate family. <br>
<br>
In your whole career, have you ever had a man ask you out or make a pass at you? <br>
<br>
Once or twice when I was younger. Yes [laughs] - I mean, no, not exactly
 directly - [laughs again] but you know how those things are. <br>
<br>
Being gay or lesbian is a unique minority in the sense that we can 
pretend we're straight if we don't want to encounter homophobic 
feelings, including our own. Unfortunately, we'll never change the world
 that way. To that end it's important to identify ourselves so that 
people learn how many people really are gay. As always, there is a 
tremendous conflict going on in the gay community about pushing people 
to come out-especially celebrities, because of their wide visibility. Do
 you have any strong feelings about it? <br>
<br>
I have to come at it from the idea of personal privacy. To me, that is a
 decision that each individual should be free to make. I don't know if 
someone should make as profoundly a personal decision as that for you. 
I'm not comfortable with that. <br>
<br>
But would you encourage them? <br>
<br>
Sure, you can say, "Hey, come on, step up to the plate" or "We need you"
 or "It'll make a big difference," and that would be absolutely true and
 valid. But in the end - hey, it's not your life. <br>
<br>
Do you think they could get hurt professionally? <br>
<br>
If you're in the entertainment business, it's a world of illusion, a 
world of symbols. So I think you're talking about somebody who may feel 
their livelihood is threatened. I think you've got to move the world in 
the right direction so that there is acceptance and tolerance, so that 
the laws protect everybody's civil rights, gay, straight, whatever. But 
then you also have got to give people the room to make their own 
decisions. <br>
<br>
But on a very personal level, what would you tell somebody who asked you
 for advice about whether or not he or she should come out? <br>
<br>
First of all, I can only imagine that not being able to be yourself is a
 painful thing. It's awful to have to wear a mask or hide yourself. So 
at the end of my conversation, I'd just say, "Hey, this is how the world
 is; these are the consequences, and these are your fundamental 
feelings." Because a person's sexuality is such an essential part of who
 he is, to not be able to express it the way that you feel it [sighs] 
has just got to be so very painful.</div>

The Real Paper , 1974-05-22<br>
By Jon Landau<br>
<br>
It's four in the morning and raining. I'm 27 today, feeling old, 
listening to my records, and remembering that things were diffferent a 
decade ago. In 1964, I was a freshman at Brandeis University, playing 
guitar and banjo five hours a day, listening to records most of the rest
 of the time, jamming with friends during the late-night hours, working 
out the harmonies to Beach Boys' and Beatles' songs. <br>
<br>
Real Paper soul writer Russell Gersten was my best friend and we would 
run through the 45s everyday: Dionne Warwick's "Walk On By" and "Anyone 
Who Had A Heart," the Drifters' "Up On the Roof," Jackie Ross' "Selfish 
One," the Marvellettes' "Too Many Fish in the Sea," and the one that no 
one ever forgets, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas' "Heat Wave." Later 
that year a special woman named Tamar turned me onto Wilson Pickett's 
"Midnight Hour" and Otis Redding's "Respect," and then came the soul. 
Meanwhile, I still went to bed to the sounds of the Byrds' "Mr. 
Tambourine Man" and later "Younger than Yesterday," still one of my 
favorite good-night albums. I woke up to Having a Rave-Up with the 
Yardbirds instead of coffee. And for a change of pace, there was always 
bluegrass: The Stanley Brothers, Bill Monroe, and Jimmy Martin. <br>
<br>
Through college, I consumed sound as if it were the staff of life. 
Others enjoyed drugs, school, travel, adventure. I just liked music: 
listening to it, playing it, talking about it. If some followed the 
inspiration of acid, or Zen, or dropping out, I followed the spirit of 
rock'n'roll. <br>
<br>
Individual songs often achieved the status of sacraments. One September,
 I was driving through Waltham looking for a new apartment when the 
sound on the car radio stunned me. I pulled over to the side of the 
road, turned it up, demanded silence of my friends and two minutes and 
fifty-six second later knew that God had spoken to me through the Four 
Tops' "Reach Out, I'll Be There," a record that I will cherish for as 
long as <em class="text-italics"> live. <br>
<br>
During those often lonely years, music was my constant companion and the
 search for the new record was like a search for a new friend and new 
revelation. "Mystic Eyes" open mine to whole new vistas in white rock 
and roll and there were days when I couldn't go to sleep without hearing
 it a dozen times. <br>
<br>
Whether it was a neurotic and manic approach to music, or just a 
religious one, or both, I don't really care. I only know that, then, as 
now, I'm grateful to the artists who gave the experience to me and hope 
that I can always respond to them. <br>
<br>
The records were, of course, only part of it. In '65 and '66 I played in
 a band, the Jellyroll, that never made it. At the time I concluded that
 I was too much of a perfectionist to work with the other band members; 
in the end I realized I was too much of an autocrat, unable to relate to
 other people enough to share music with them. <br>
<br>
Realizing that I wasn't destined to play in a band, I gravitated to rock
 criticism. Starting with a few wretched pieces in Broadside and then 
some amateurish but convincing reviews in the earliest Crawdaddy, I at 
least found a substitute outlet for my desire to express myself about 
rock: If I couldn't cope with playing, I may have done better writing 
about it. <br>
<br>
But in those days, I didn't see myself as a critic -- the writing was 
just another extension of an all-encompassing obsession. It carried over
 to my love for live music, which I cared for even more than the 
records. I went to the Club 47 three times a week and then hunted down 
the rock shows -- which weren't so easy to find because they weren't all
 conveniently located at downtown theatres. I flipped for the Animals' 
two-hour show at Rindge Tech; the Rolling Stones, not just at Boston 
Garden, where they did the best half hour rock'n'roll set I had ever 
seen, but at Lynn Football Stadium, where they started a riot; Mitch 
Ryder and the Detroit Wheels overcoming the worst of performing 
conditions at Watpole Skating Rink; and the Beatles at Suffolk Down, 
plainly audible, beatiful to look at, and confirmation that we -- and I 
-- existed as a special body of people who understood the power and the 
flory of rock'n'roll. <br>
<br>
I lived those days with a sense of anticipation. I worked in Briggs 
&amp; Briggs a few summers and would know when the next albums were 
coming. The disappointment when the new Stones was a day late, the 
exhilaration when Another Side of Bob Dylan showed up a week early. The 
thrill of turning on WBZ and hearing some strange sound, both beautiful 
and horrible, but that demanded to be heard again; it turned out to be 
"You've Lost That Loving Feeling," a record that stands just behind 
"Reach Out I'll Be There" as means of musical catharsis. <br>
<br>
My temperament being what it is, I often enjoyed hating as much as 
loving. That San Francisco shit corrupted the purity of the rock that I 
lvoed and I could have led a crusade against it. The Moby Grape moved 
me, but those songs about White Rabbits and hippie love made me laugh 
when they didn't make me sick. I found more rock'n'roll in the dubbed-in
 hysteria on the Rolling Stones Got Live if You Want It than on most San
 Francisco albums combined. <br>
<br>
For every moment I remember there are a dozen I've forgotten, but I feel
 like they are with me on a night like this, a permanent part of my 
consciousness, a feeling lost on my mind but never on my soul. And then 
there are those individual experiences so transcendent that I can 
remember them as if they happened yesterday: Sam and Dave at the Soul 
Together at Madison Square Garden in 1967: every gesture, every 
movement, the order of the songs. I would give anything to hear them 
sing "When Something's Wrong with My Baby" just the way they did it that
 night. <br>
<br>
The obsessions with Otis Redding, Jerry Butler, and B.B. King came a 
little bit later; each occupied six months of my time, while I digested 
every nuance of every album. Like the Byrds, I turn to them today and 
still find, when I least expect it, something new, something deeply 
flet, something that speaks to me. <br>
<br>
As I left college in 1969 and went into record production I started 
exhausting my seemingly insatiable appetite. I felt no less intensely 
than before about certain artists; I just felt that way about fewer of 
them. I not only became more discriminating but more indifferent. I 
found it especially hard to listen to new faces. I had accumulated 
enough musical experience to fall back on when I needed its 
companionship but during this period in my life I found I needed music 
less and people, whom I spend too much of my life ignoring, much more. <br>
<br>
Today I listen to music with a certain measure of detachment. I'm a 
professional and I make my living commenting on it. There are months 
when I hate it, going through the routine just as a shoe salesman goes 
through his. I follow films with the passion that music once held for 
me. But in my own moments of greatest need, I never give up the search 
for sounds that can answer every impulse, consume all emotion, cleanse 
and purify -- all things that we have no right to expect from even the 
greatest works of art but which we can occasionally derive from them. <br>
<br>
Still, today, if I hear a record I like it is no longer a signal for me 
to seek out every other that the artist has made. I take them as they 
come, love them, and leave them. Some have stuck - - a few that come 
quickly to mind are Neil Young's After the Goldrush, Stevie Wonder's 
Innervisions, Van Morrison's Tupelo Honey, James Taylor's records, 
Valerie Simpson's Exposed, Randy Newman's Sail Away, Exile on Main 
Street, Ry Cooder's records, and, very specially, the last three albums 
of Joni Mitchell -- but many more slip through the mind, making much 
fainter impressions than their counterparts of a decade ago. <br>
<br>
But tonight there is someone I can write of the way I used to write, 
without reservations of any kind. Last Thursday, at the Harvard Square 
theatre, I saw my rock'n'roll past flash before my eyes. And I saw 
something else: I saw rock and roll future and its name is Bruce 
Springsteen. And on a night when I needed to feel young, he made me feel
 like I was hearing music for the very first time. <br>
<br>
When his two-hour set ended I could only think, can anyone really be 
this good; can anyone say this much to me, can rock'n'roll still speak 
with this kind of power and glory? And then I felt the sores on my 
thighs where I had been pounding my hands in time for the entire concert
 and knew that the answer was yes. <br>
<br>
Springsteen does it all. He is a rock'n'roll punk, a Latin street poet, a
 ballet dancer, an actor, a joker, bar band leader, hot-shit rhythm 
guitar player, extraordinary singer, and a truly great rock'n'roll 
composer. He leads a band like he has been doing it forever. I racked my
 brains but simply can't think of a white artist who does so many things
 so superbly. There is no one I would rather watch on a stage today. He 
opened with his fabulous party record "The E Street Shuffle" -- but he 
slowed it down so graphically that it seemed a new song and it worked as
 well as the old. He took his overpowering story of a suicide, "For 
You," and sang it with just piano accompaniment and a voice that rang 
out to the very last row of the Harvard Square theatre. He did three new
 songs, all of them street trash rockers, one even with a "Telstar" 
guitar introduction and an Eddie Cochran rhythm pattern. We missed 
hearing his "Four Winds Blow," done to a fare-thee-well at his 
sensational week-long gig at Charley's but "Rosalita" never sounded 
better and "Kitty's Back," one of the great contemporary shuffles, 
rocked me out of my chair, as I personally led the crowd to its feet and
 kept them there. <br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is a wonder to look at. Skinny, dressed like a reject 
from Sha Na Na, he parades in front of his all-star rhythm band like a 
cross between Chuck Berry, early Bob Dylan, and Marlon Brando. Every 
gesture, every syllable adds something to his ultimate goal - - to 
liberate our spirit while he liberates his by baring his soul through 
his music. Many try, few succeed, none more than he today. <br>
<br>
It's five o'clock now -- I write columns like this as fast as I can for 
fear I'll chicken out -- and I'm listening to "Kitty's Back." I do feel 
old but the record and my memory of the concert has made me feel a 
little younger. I still feel the spirit and it still moves me. <br>
<br>
I bought a new home this week and upstairs in the bedroom is a sleeping 
beauty who understands only too well what I try to do with my records 
and typewriter. About rock'n'roll, the Lovin' Spoonful once sang, "I'll 
tell you about the magic that will free your soul/But it's like trying 
to tell a stranger about rock'n'roll." Last Thursday, I remembered that 
the magic still exists and as long as I write about rock, my mission is 
to tell a stranger about it -- just as long as I remember that I'm the 
stranger I'm writing for.</em></div>

New York Times , 2002-07-14<br>
By Jon Pareles<br>
<br>
FEW days after Sept. 11, Bruce Springsteen was pulling out of a beach 
parking lot in the Jersey Shore town of Sea Bright when a fan rode by. 
The man rolled down his window, shouted, "We need you!" and drove on. It
 was the kind of moment, Mr. Springsteen said, that made his career 
worthwhile. "That's part of my job," he said. "It's an honor to find 
that place in the audience's life." <br>
<br>
"The Rising" (Columbia), Mr. Springsteen's first album of new songs with
 the E Street Band since 1987, is due for release on July 30. It 
continues the reunion with the E Street Band that began with a few songs
 in 1995. Yet it barely looks back. By changing producers for 
essentially the first time since 1975, Mr. Springsteen has recast the 
sound of his music. For him, at 52, the album represents a rediscovery 
of the rock voice that he feared he had lost. <br>
<br>
Most pop stars seemed irrelevant immediately after Sept. 11. Mr. 
Springsteen, who has spent most of his career singing about American 
dreams and disappointments, did not. With the red-white-and-blue 
iconography of "Born in the U.S.A." (which was anything but a nativist 
anthem) and in the accumulated narratives and sounds of his songs, he 
had made himself rock's all-American good guy, loyal but never 
complacent about his country. He had become a symbol of blue-collar 
pride, sympathy for the underdog and rock with a clear conscience. <br>
<br>
His job, he decided a quarter-century ago, was not to embody some rock- 
star fantasy but to recognize the dignity of ordinary work. "I felt that
 I saw nobility in people," he said in a rare interview at his farmhouse
 home. "Not the kind you read in the story books, but the kind where 
people go in to work every day, they come home every day and dinner's on
 the table every day. There's people doing this in little ways every day
 all the time. These are the people that I want to write about. This is 
what I think is important. That's what moves me. That's what makes me 
want to sing my song." <br>
<br>
"After the 11th," he said, "I think one of the things people were 
shocked at was that that was alive in some fashion. I think that we live
 in a particular pop culture moment, that there's a theater of 
humiliation on TV and on the radio, a reflection of self-loathing. I 
don't think anyone could imagine these sacrifices." <br>
<br>
The office workers, firefighters, police and air travelers who died on 
Sept. 11 were the stuff of Springsteen songs: people who became heroes 
by just doing their jobs. He sings about them, and their survivors, on 
"The Rising," a song cycle about duty, love, death, mourning and 
resurrection. <br>
<br>
"The Rising" provides comfort without flinching from sadness and bitter 
fury. In a way the album brings together the topics that have occupied 
Mr. Springsteen for two decades: work and love. The 15 songs are filled 
with characters who have lost their closest companions. "I want a kiss 
from your lips/ I want an eye for an eye," Mr. Springsteen sings in 
"Empty Sky." Grief wrestles with perseverance; come-ons arrive with 
intimations of mortality. In the album's title song, "The Rising," one 
man's afterlife is an endless longing for the physical touch of those 
left behind, and the music climbs toward jubilation as an act of will. 
The repercussions of Sept. 11 permeate the songs, but there is no 
jingoism or self-righteousness, just individual stories from all sides; 
the narrator who opens one song, "Paradise," is a suicide bomber of 
unspecified nationality. <br>
<br>
Despite their somber subjects, the songs still find the possibility of 
pleasure and a recurring hope that there's a way to rise above 
suffering. The music maintains the E Street Band's reassuring solidity, 
built on the drummer Max Weinberg's steadfast march beats, Garry 
Tallent's bass lines and the heft of three guitars and two keyboards, 
along with Clarence Clemons's soul-band saxophone. Mr. Springsteen often
 follows a songwriting strategy that dates back to songs like 
"Badlands," with verses full of travail and choruses that ring with 
optimism. "The verses are the blues, the chorus is the gospel," he said 
in the interview. <br>
<br>
"You have to come to grips with the real horrors that are out there," 
Mr. Springsteen continued. "And then all people have is hope. That's 
what brings the next day and whatever that day may bring. You can't be 
uncritical, but just a hope grounded in the real world of living, 
friendship, work, family, Saturday night. And that's where it resides. 
That's where I always found faith and spirit. I found them down in those
 things, not some place intangible or some place abstract. And I've 
really tried to write about that basic idea my whole life." <br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen lives with his wife (and E Street Band backup singer), 
Patti Scialfa, and their three children in a 19th-century farmhouse in 
Monmouth County. It's surrounded by former corn and soybean fields that 
will, in the next few growing seasons, be converted to organic crops; a 
barn holds a demo studio. Mr. Springsteen's wood-paneled living room, 
where he has also done some recording, has a large fireplace with 
antique clocks on the mantelpiece and a comfortable assortment of Arts 
and Crafts furniture and stuffed chairs. Wearing a pale shirt, corduroy 
pants, black boots and a St. Christopher medal ? the former patron saint
 of travelers no longer recognized by the Roman Catholic Church, 
disenfranchised like a Springsteen character ? Mr. Springsteen sipped a 
beer and spoke proudly about "The Rising." <br>
<br>
"I've been at my best when I'm connected to what's going on in the world
 outside," he said. "I have a sense of what my service to my audience is
 going to be. It's the true nature of work in the sense that you're 
filling a place. And that place comes with its blessings and its 
responsibilities." <br>
<br>
By Sept. 21, when musicians and actors shared a hushed all-network 
telethon for the September 11th Fund, Mr. Springsteen had written a song
 called "Into the Fire" for the program; it's about someone who 
disappeared "upstairs into the fire," and it turns from memories to a 
benediction: "May your strength give us strength/ May your hope give us 
hope." Mr. Springsteen didn't consider it finished enough for prime 
time; instead, he sang "My City of Ruins," a song written before Sept. 
11 about a devastated city and the determination to "rise up." Within a 
week, he had also written "You're Missing," an elegy rooted in the 
everyday, and "The Fuse," about loss and desire. All four songs appear 
on "The Rising." <br>
<br>
"Into the Fire" and "You're Missing" became what Mr. Springsteen called 
"genesis songs": they triggered others. "I'd come up with one and that 
would lead to another and lead to another and lead to another. Then you 
start to tell a story. And finally the story begins saying, `I'd like 
this emotional ground covered or that emotional ground covered.' What's 
the rest of the story?" <br>
<br>
"You're mining, soul mining," Mr. Springsteen added. "And sometimes 
you're just not around the rich veins, and a long time can go by. And 
then all of a sudden, boom! You hit one." <br>
<br>
On a table sat a blue spiral-bound Mead notebook, with a handwritten 
label reading "Work Book" and a sticker with a picture of an eagle from 
Exile Cycles, a custom motorcycle builder in Sun Valley, Calif. It held,
 in its handwritten pages, the making of "The Rising," starting with a 
page of potential song titles, including keepers like "Into the Fire" 
and nonstarters like "Hard Drive." Then came draft after draft of 
lyrics, a few dead-ended songs and, eventually, finished lyrics with 
notes on arranging and mixing. The last pages are sequences of songs for
 the finished album. Mr. Springsteen has stacks of these books; after 
all, he has been making albums for Columbia for 30 years. <br>
<br>
He made his reputation as a bar-band trouper inventing an irresistible 
persona: the scruffy, romantic Jersey guy who loved girls, cars and the 
possibility of escape. After he became a national figure with "Born to 
Run" in 1975, he turned to bleak parables and songs about other people: 
the runaway husband in "Hungry Heart," the hard-luck prisoner in "Johnny
 99," the shattered Vietnam veteran in "Born in the U.S.A." and more 
recently the AIDS patient in "Streets of Philadelphia." <br>
<br>
"I felt like maybe I had played out my story kind of early on," Mr. 
Springsteen said. "There wasn't any place to go. The classic, the sort 
of iconic rock story was those early records." <br>
<br>
So he chose to write about the unglamorous workaday world. "I thought 
that once again I could be of value and have something that would be 
worth saying and give people a good time," he said. "I've always felt, I
 just write well about these things. Those elements are where the blood 
and the grit of real life mixes with people's spiritual aspirations and 
their search for just, decent lives." <br>
<br>
His 1982 album "Nebraska," originally intended as four-track demo 
recordings on cassettes, told desolate stories in raw, low-fi form. Then
 he hit his mass-market peak with "Born in the U.S.A." in 1984, an album
 of chiming, gleaming songs about the people left behind by Reaganomics.
 His songs on albums like "Tunnel of Love" turned inward, pondering love
 gone wrong. His first marriage, to the actress Julianne Phillips fell 
apart; he also decided to part ways with the E Street Band. <br>
<br>
After marrying Ms. Scialfa in 1991, the year after his son Evan James 
was born, he took up storytelling again, but with a new austerity. For 
"The Ghost of Tom Joad" in 1995 he set tales of workers and immigrants 
to quiet, folky guitar. He toured alone, playing an acoustic guitar. And
 he wondered if he would ever rock again. <br>
<br>
"I was having a hard time locating my rock voice," he recalled. "I knew I
 didn't want it to be what it was, but I didn't know . . . " He trailed 
off. "I'd made some records over the past years, I made one in '94 that I
 didn't release. Then I made a series of demos, kind of in search of 
that voice. And I was having a hard time finding it. And there was a 
point I said: `Well, gee, maybe I just don't do that now. Maybe that's 
something that I did.' " <br>
<br>
Getting back together with the E Street Band, first to record three 
songs for his 1995 "Greatest Hits" collection and then for a world tour 
that began in 1999, changed his mind. He realized he missed arena-scale 
rock. "Outside of the ego gratification of thousands chanting your name,
 and screaming for you," he said with a smile, "it's also something 
where you go, `Man, I spent a long time learning how to do this really 
well, and am I just going to say that's not for me? I don't think so.' 
And that's what people ask for. They want you to come out and do it for 
me one more time. While you could say on one hand that's kind of an 
unreasonable question, on the other hand, is it really? That's kind of 
why you've set yourself up. <br>
<br>
"And then on the tour I wrote a couple of songs, `Land of Hope and 
Dreams' and `American Skin,' " he said. "And these were as good as any 
songs like this that I've ever written. It was like, there's that voice I
 was looking for." <br>
<br>
While "The Rising" reconvenes the E Street Band, it also shakes up the 
way Mr. Springsteen has made albums since the early 1970's, when he 
began producing them with his manager, Jon Landau, and then his 
engineer, Chuck Plotkin, and the E Street Band's guitarist Steve Van 
Zandt. He made "The Rising" with Brendan O'Brien, the Atlanta-based 
producer, who has worked with Pearl Jam, Korn and Rage Against the 
Machine. <br>
<br>
"My own abilities, I felt like I had reached my limits with them," Mr. 
Springsteen said. "The basic sound of things that you hear on the radio 
changes at least every five to 10 years. Brendan had all my references 
so I could refer back to something from 1966 or 1980. And then he had 
the following 10 and 20 years." <br>
<br>
While many of the songs use Mr. Springsteen's favorite opening chords ? 
the major-to-relative minor change that pervades doo-wop ? Mr. O'Brien 
subtly reconfigured the E Street Band. He brought guitars forward 
instead of keyboards, found ways for Mr. Springsteen to sing without 
shouting and slipped a country fiddle or a gospel choir into some 
arrangements. <br>
<br>
The songs reach back to rural blues ("Into the Fire") and roadhouse rock
 ("Further on up the Road"), or they might use tape-looped drums 
alongside pealing, U2-style guitar ("The Fuse"). In "Worlds Apart," a 
soldier in what could be Afghanistan falls in love with a local woman; 
the song mixes the E Street Band with a Pakistani group that sings 
qawwali, mystical Islamic songs. When the E Street Band sounds most like
 its old self, in "Mary's Place," it's for a song about returning to a 
familiar haunt, with lyrics that also hint at Mr. Springsteen's delight 
in his old band: "Familiar faces all around me," he sings. <br>
<br>
"They had protected me when it got to a place where everything was kind 
of hot and there was a lot of light on you," he said. "I carried with me
 my own sense of place and my own sense of home in those guys. And I 
think vice versa. This is what my band is built for. We're built better 
for, I think, when the cards are down. We're most useful in some 
fashion. So I think that it's just the old story: It's nice to have a 
job to do."</div>

1992-08<br>
By David Hepworth<br>
<br>
New York, May. Bruce Springsteen and Tom Hanks appear on a promotional 
slot for Saturday Night Live. Kneeling at their feet are Wayne and Garth
 of the all-conquering Wayne's World, doing the shtick with which they 
greet all superstar guests, genuflecting while intoning "We're not 
worthy, we're not worthy." After a few seconds of this routine, Wayne 
pauses and, looking up at Hanks, confides: "Tom, nor are you..." <br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen used to find his status as American cultural hero 
discomfiting. These days, seven years on from the glory days of the 
'Born In The USA' tour, he's more likely to laugh it off. On 'Lucky 
Town,' one of the two albums he released in April, he even offers 'Local
 Hero,' a song which has some fun with his own mythic status, describing
 the sensation of finding a kitsch portrait of himself in a shop 
"between the Doberman and Bruce Lee."<br>
<br>
"The first verse of that song is completely true," he confesses. "I was 
driving through a town I grew up in and I looked over and there was a 
five and ten cent store with a black velvet painting of Bruce Lee, a 
picture of me on 'Born In The USA' and a picture of a dog next to me! I 
said Wow, I gotta get a photo of that! It was on sale for $19.99." <br>
<br>
But did he invest? <br>
<br>
"Actually, I did." He shakes his head with some wonderment at the notion
 of a songwriter ending up as a plaster saint. "You get to a point where
 you're like Santa Claus at the North Pole." <br>
<br>
* * * <br>
<br>
Bob Dylan's never-ending tour has pulled into Hollywood. Springsteen and
 Jon Landau, his manager/producer/friend for the last 17 years, join the
 crowds at the Pantages Theatre to watch the Godfather of all the 
legends continue the process of "dismantling his myth." An enquiry about
 whether he thinks it inevitable that he should go through the same 
process of deconstruction draws the usual considered response from 
Springsteen.&lt;&gt; Yes, he says, it's tough when you've had as much 
impact as Dylan's had. Then the rueful smile returns. "But as far as the
 whole myth thing goes, then hell, it ends up being dismantled for you 
anyway. It doesn't matter whether you do it or not, somebody's going to 
do it, you know? There's usually some elements of truth in it and 
there's usually a lot of bullshit in it that you've contrived in some 
fashion. <br>
<br>
"I don't think any of that stuff really stands for very long anyway and 
that's as it should be. Whatever your recent image is, there are 
elements that are part of who you are and part of your personality but a
 lot of it is just some sort of collective imagining that you may have 
contributed to in some fashion and in other ways you haven't. It can end
 up being confining and so the best thing is to have all the holes poked
 in it. And," he cackles, "everybody's always willing to help you out!" <br>
<br>
* * * <br>
<br>
'Born in the USA' transformed Bruce Springsteen from a heavy cult act 
into one of the half- dozen leading international brands of the 
boom-boom '80s. Along with Madonna and Michael Jackson, he sold records 
in quantities that predecessors like The Beatles could never have 
dreamed of, made unprecedented sums of money and enjoyed the attentions 
of sections of the media who had never previously been bothered with 
music. That kind of success carries with it the implicit assumption of 
year on year growth. Right now, a couple of months after the 
simultaneous release of 'Human Touch' and 'Lucky Town,' there's a 
perception in the music business that they are commercial 
disappointments, certainly when compared to the wide- screen populism of
 'Born In The USA.' ('Tunnel Of Love' was always too modest and 
understated to live up to the market's idea of a proper Springsteen 
album.) <br>
<br>
The man at the center of the problem doesn't see it as a problem but 
clearly recognizes the pressures. Reflecting on the downside of the 
commercial and PR bonanza that was the 'Born In The USA' tour he says, 
"You get in a situation where the myth of success in America is so 
powerful that that story overwhelms the story that you may think you're 
telling. Success at that level is a tricky business because a lot of 
distortion creeps in and not being particularly a media manipulator, it 
was fascinating realizing that you really do comment on a lot of 
different levels. There's the songs you're writing and the things you're
 telling and then there's what's happening to you and that's also 
another story. I found very often that your success story is a bigger 
story than whatever you're trying to say on stage. <br>
<br>
"I used to think that the idea was I come out on my stage and I do my 
best to bring out the best in you, which brings out the best in me. But 
sometimes you do your best and you pull out people's insanity or you 
pull out parts of your own insanity. It's not completely predictable, 
and when you lock into it on a very big level, it's a big wave that you 
ride and you try and stay on and think, What was that about? What did I 
accomplish? Where do I feel I've failed? I thought about all that stuff 
after we came home and when I did 'Tunnel of Love,' I think the idea was
 to reintroduce myself as a songwriter." <br>
<br>
The 1986 live box set was intended to set the seal on an era that had 
begun 1O years earlier with 'Born To Run.' Talking at the time, he 
described the material written in between -- 'Darkness,' 'The River,' 
'Nebraska,' 'Born In The USA' -- as a reaction against that anthem's 
blazing romanticism. Then newly and publicly married, he presented the 
sequence of songs as the personal odyssey of a man intent on carrying 
the flame of youth into the life of a grown- up, finally riding out of 
his hometown to the sound of Tom Waits's Jersey Girl, his best girl by 
his side and his demons laid to rest. <br>
<br>
Then came 'Tunnel Of Love,' an extraordinary dispatch from the trenches 
of marital breakdown, and it was clear that domestic bliss wasn't 
dulling his edge. Either that or it wasn't all that blissful. The 
Springsteen of 'Human Touch' and 'Lucky Town' suddenly sounds like one 
of the world's older men. Songs like 'My Beautiful Reward' and 'The Big 
Muddy' manifest a new toughness, suggesting that rock's great 
existentialist has passed through a mid-life crisis and lived to tell 
the tale. The references are classical -- rivers, mountains, valleys and
 bluebirds of happiness; the mud defiles and the rain doth cleanse. The 
nature imagery "came out of listening to country music -- Hank Williams,
 Woody Guthrie... everybody has that landscape inside them, doesn't 
matter if you live in the city, it's a mythical landscape that everybody
 carries with them." <br>
<br>
'With Every Wish' he soberly describes as about "growing up and 
realizing what a life with consequences is all about. When you're a kid,
 you have a dream and the way you imagine it is really a life without 
complications. When you get older, the trickiest thing is not to give in
 to cynicism, and you get to an age, particularly in 1992 in this 
country or in England, where you don't have the time to spare. You have 
to understand the limitations of your own life and keep pushing through 
it. That's what 'With Every Wish' is about, keeping on moving forward." <br>
<br>
Talking in 1992, Springsteen is inclined to focus on what has happened 
to him personally since 'Born In The USA' and its attendant, 
record-shattering world tour and how determined he is to prove that it's
 possible for an artist to outrun the smothering maw of commercial 
expectation. 'Born In The USA' was a sales peak he may never scale again
 and artistically there seems every reason why he shouldn't even try. <br>
<br>
Jon Landau underlines the point in one of those management/client 
testimonials that have unfortunately been debased by being claimed on 
behalf of too many hacks (see their manager's insistence that Spinal 
Tap's appeal was becoming "more selective"): "Growth from record to 
record is not part of Bruce's game plan. We release records that we know
 in advance are likely to have different degrees of success. When we put
 out 'Tunnel Of Love' we certainly didn't think it was going to be as 
popular as 'Born In The USA.' We're not in the business of taking X and 
forcing it into being Y. I'd encourage Bruce in his natural inclination 
to not get involved in the topping yourself game. Bruce's approach to 
his work and his whole life is very value-based. He approaches it with 
the full sensibility of the artist." <br>
<br>
* * * <br>
<br>
Los Angeles. On a hot Thursday in May, the artist drives his black 
Corvette down from his bourgeois house in the Hollywood Hills for 
another day's rehearsal with his new band. Inside a massive hangar, two 
huge stages face each other. The first is being readied for shipping to 
Stockholm for the first night of the world tour. On the second is enough
 equipment for a medium-sized club act. On a dais at the rear of the 
stage, six microphones are erected for backing singers being auditioned 
this week. <br>
<br>
Stage right, in bowler hat and shorts, is the inscrutable figure of bass
 player Tommy Simms. Stage left we find guitarist Shane Fontayne, 
formerly of Muswell Hill, now domiciled in Los Angeles and looking like a
 cross between Slash and Danny Baker. At the drums is the slight, 
youthful figure of Zachary Alford. Sitting at a modest keyboard is the 
one survivor from the E Street Band, Roy Bittan. Pacing the wide open 
spaces center stage, worrying at the chords of 'Tougher Than The Rest,' 
is their leader. <br>
<br>
Although the beard has been dispensed with, the motif is West Coast 
Romany. A flimsy print shirt is open to reveal a chest less mountainous 
than of yore. Three chains are interwined around his neck. Three 
earrings cluster in the left lobe. Peeking from the cuffs of some 
uniquely blue jeans are the inevitable heavy, buckled motorcycle boots. 
With the help of a light tan acquired on a short holiday the previous 
week, he looks about five years younger than he has any right to. Bruce 
Springsteen is 42. <br>
<br>
His voice is suffering from the exertions of rehearsal and so today's 
rehearsal is largely instrumental. He tries 'The Long Goodbye,' 
'Brilliant Disguise' and 'Gloria's Eyes,' experimenting with different 
sequences and segues. At this stage the first half of the show is worked
 out and now he's trying to piece together the drama of the second act. 
Taking a break and picking his way down the stairs with the rolling gait
 of a sailor reacquainting himself with dry land, he confesses that he 
hasn't decided what the climax will be and therefore it's not easy to 
see how to build to it. <br>
<br>
"There's things that physically feel good one after another," he 
observes. "It's less intellectual and more just how it hits you as it 
comes up. I don't think people go to concerts for a fundamentally 
intellectual experience. It's more like, hey, how does it feel?" <br>
<br>
Shane Fontayne, who has worked previously with Lone Justice and The 
Merchants Of Venus, finds the rehearsal process fascinating: "He's very 
focused in the way he wants it to sound. He doesn't walk around saying 
play this or play that. He'll be more allegorical in his description of 
the way he wants something to sound, say like fog rolling over the 
ground or something. He knows about restraint and how to get more power 
by holding something back." <br>
<br>
The recruiting of this new group is the strongest indication of 
Springsteen's determination to re-enter the live arena on his own terms 
and to liberate himself from the need to do the kind of Greatest Hits 
shows which have become standard for artists of his popularity. The new 
line-up is smaller, there will be no saxophone or layers of keyboards 
and the emphasis will definitely be on post-'Born In The USA' material. <br>
<br>
"I was lucky in that I had the greatest band in the world," he says of 
the severing of his relationship with the E Street Band. "Some of those 
guys I've known for 20 years. The way I look at it is I get paid to 
write a new song and I can't keep rewriting the old stuff. I played with
 a single set of musicians for a long time and I thought it was time to 
play with other people. Everybody sings their own spirit, their own 
personality, it's like a fingerprint; no two musicians play the same or 
bring to the stage something similar. I think the fundamental values 
remain. I don't have a plan. I'm just seeing what it is and playing in 
to it. It's going to be a very fun, hard rocking band. What else it's 
going to be I'm just watching it develop." <br>
<br>
* * * <br>
<br>
Roy Bittan got the call in 1990 informing him that Springsteen was 
planning a future without the E Streeters. "For three months I was 
watching the same 'Boss Fires Band' story on TV, which I don't think was
 ever really the case. Then he called me and I played him a track I'd 
done which was 'Roll Of The Dice' and he said, Come on, let's start 
working on this stuff." <br>
<br>
These were the early stages of recording the album that became 'Human 
Touch.' A band of hardened studio pros were assembled and many songs 
were recorded with a view to their being edited down to a coherent 
single album. No less than four producers, including Springsteen, are 
credited on the finished record. <br>
<br>
"On some records we have what you might call a small board," Springsteen
 grins when asked what they all do. "Charlie Plotkin is a go-between 
from the technology to the emotion, Roy Bittan works mainly tonally and 
texturally. Jon Landau is interesting in that despite being the most 
intellectual of the bunch he listens on the most gut level and 
simultaneously will look at the record and see what it's saying." <br>
<br>
After 18 months, 'Human Touch' was completed. But because Springsteen 
"didn't feel that I'd gotten to everything I wanted to get to", they put
 it away for three months in order to take a longer view. Landau 
returned to the East where "Bruce Federal Expressed me two songs he'd 
worked up himself. They were 'Living Proof' and 'The Big Muddy' in 
substantially the form you hear them on that album. When I heard them, I
 just called and said, Whatever you're doing, just keep doing it. By the
 time I came out to visit a few weeks later, he had virtually all the 
'Lucky Town' songs really in that sequence. I was astonished because it 
hit me as it hit Bruce that this was really a very distinct group of 
songs with a different voice and different sound." <br>
<br>
Explaining the three-week brainstorm that produced 'Lucky Town,' 
Springsteen says: "Things come when they come. I don't have any one way 
of doing it. I started 'Human Touch' because I felt like I just had to 
get back to work. So we just started working on a record. Sometimes you 
work just to get through the work you're gonna do. All that work on 
'Human Touch' was me trying to get to the place where I could make 
'Lucky Town' in three weeks, through dredging through a lot of stuff and
 then bang, a lot comes flying out. I don't know the outcome when I 
start. One might be real work and a lot of time put in and then the 
other you really do click in to some other place and stay there for two 
or three weeks. It's really spontaneous." <br>
<br>
The commitment to narrative coherence has been a feature of 
Springsteen's work since 'Born To Run.' For record companies used to 
dealing with acts who are ready to release as soon as they've worked up 
three singles and wadding, it's frustrating. Settling into a odd living 
room arrangement set up by a trailer in the corner of the soundstage and
 slurping noisily from a paper cup of tea, he responds to the suggestion
 that where 'Human Touch' is about a man falling from grace, 'Lucky 
Town' deals with redemption. <br>
<br>
"That's how a good part of it felt to me. What people pay me money for 
is to be out on my point. I try to present what I stumbled around and 
groped my way into and I try to get some of that into my music in some 
fashion and that's when I feel good about releasing the stuff and 
committed to going on the road and getting involved in that life. I feel
 this is something that's not going to waste people's time. They may 
like it or not like it; it may be what you think rock 'n' roll is or 
not; but it's very centered and real. So if you want lo slice them up 
like that, there's a lot of groping around on 'Human Touch' and more on 
'Lucky Town' about finding your place and re- finding yourself, getting 
back in touch with your own humanity and the good things that you feel 
about yourself. <br>
<br>
"There's less fear on that record. If you go back to 'Cautious Man' on 
'Tunnel Of Love' about the guy who has love and fear tattooed on his 
hands -- that's about the story for most people. There's a world of love
 there and there's a world of fear too and it's standing right in front 
of you and very often that fear feels a lot realer and certainly more 
urgent than the feeling of love. The night my son was born, I got close 
to a feeling of a real, pure, unconditional love with all the walls 
down. All of a sudden, what was happening was so immense that it just 
stomped all the fear away for a little while and I remember feeling 
overwhelmed. But I also understood why you're so frightened. When that 
world of love comes rushing in, a world of fear comes in with it. To 
open yourself up to one thing, you've got to embrace the other thing as 
well. And then you embrace those things that you're just around the 
corner from... oh, death, the whole nine yards. My music over the last 
five years has dealt with those almost primitive issues; it's about 
somebody walking through that world of fear so that he can live in the 
world of love." <br>
<br>
* * * <br>
<br>
Springsteen has little small talk. His answers to questions are all 
long, often mazy and frequently beyond the reach of punctuation, but 
they are always answers and do betray the signs of having had some 
considerable thought expended on them. It's difficult to spot the 
daylight between his public image and his personality as manifested in a
 private meeting. There is something faintly monkish about the 
seriousness with which he takes his responsibilities. The Springsteen 
image was tarnished in some eyes by one much-publicized court case 
brought in the late '80s by former Springsteen crew members Mike Batlan 
and Doug Sutphin in the course of which they alleged that their boss was
 a chiseling martinet who had fined them for damaging a canoe. These 
claims were even made the substance of a particularly gleeful cover 
story in one British music paper. In September of last year, the case 
was settled out of court but only after a burst of unpleasant publicity.
 His only comment now is: "I've been working a long time and I've only 
had a couple of law suits. It was tough because it was with people we've
 worked with over the years and without getting into a blow by blow 
account of the highs, the lows, the foibles and fumbles, I felt like I 
did the right thing in that particular case." <br>
<br>
Unlike most rock stars, Springsteen has exceptionally good taste in the 
music of others and can always be relied upon for tips: current 
recommendations include David Baerwald's 'Bedtime Stories,' LA hard rock
 band Social Distortion and Dylan's 'Blind Willie McTell,' "a 
masterpiece". "I try to think like a fan," he says. "If I came to my 
music right now, what would I be looking for? I think people come to my 
music looking for certain specific things and in my head I make some of 
my music for that fan, initially. These records had to go to a certain 
place. I had a lot of changes in my life and everything you do ends up 
in the papers and so I was concerned with making music that was a 
connection." <br>
<br>
At the end of the 'Born In The USA' tour, Springsteen married Julianne 
Phillips. When the marriage fell apart two years later and he took up a 
relationship with singer Patti Scialfa, the media embarked on a feeding 
frenzy. Wild speculation about multi-million dollar settlements, 
disagreements over whether or not to have children and drinking binges 
introduced Springsteen to a level of scrutiny he had never had to 
encounter when a mere rock star. <br>
<br>
"People are interested in marriage everywhere, whether it's me or 
Princess Di or whoever," he allows. "I don't focus on it that much. I 
love my job and I love the things that it's brought me. If I had a 
choice, I'd do without that stuff but it comes with the territory. It's 
not really your life. What's important is what's happening, not what's 
written about what's happening. Who cares? It's just not real. The 
reality of your own life overwhelms whatever bullshit somebody's written
 about you in a newspaper for a couple of days." <br>
<br>
The reality was an individual who found it difficult to function away 
from his professional life, as workaholic and driven as any advertising 
man: "In my business you're afforded the luxury of extended adolescence.
 I found I'd gotten very good at my job and because I was good at my 
job, for some reason I thought I was capable of a lot of other things, 
like relationships. If you're not good at those things and you're in 
your twenties, you don't notice it because you're too busy scuffling. 
But when you get a little older, you start to realize that there are all
 these other things that you're really bad at, that you've been failing 
miserably at for a long time. You begin to investigate what those things
 were, which is basically your real life, your life away from your 
guitar, your music, your work, your life outside your work. In that area
 over the past eight years, I've been investigating that and feeling I 
came up short in a lot of ways and I've been trying to sort my way 
through feeling good, whether I've got the guitar on or it's in its 
case, trying to get a little closer to walking it like you talk it. 
Which sometimes I've done OK and sometimes I haven't done all that well.
 A lot of the music is about pursuing what defines my manhood to me: 
what are my commitments and how to try and stick by them in a world 
where we can't ever really know anybody else or ever really know 
yourself." <br>
<br>
Isn't that one of the themes of 'Tunnel Of Love': how people deceive themselves and how difficult it is to arrive at true love? <br>
<br>
"I reached a point where I thought I knew myself very well and I had a 
variety of things happen where I realized I actually didn't. It was a 
very good eye-opener because it throws everything wide open; it's not 
that you don't know parts of yourself but very few people can confront 
themselves very accurately. We all live with our illusions and our 
self-image and there's a good percentage of that that's a pipe dream. If
 you can cut that stuff away, which I've tried to do in my music, and 
realize that I do this well but I'm taking baby steps in this other part
 of my life, it gets you closer to feeling a certain fullness in your 
life that I always felt like I was missing. I always enjoyed my work but
 when it came to functioning outside of that, I always had a hard time. 
So basically the music has been based around somebody in pursuit of 
whatever that thing is. 'Tunnel Of Love' was like that and with 'Human 
Touch' and 'Lucky Town,' I feel like I've finally got my feet on the 
floor as far as some of these things go." <br>
<br>
One of the strongest threads running through his work since the early 
days has been the relationship between parents and children. With these 
albums and the births of Evan and Jessica, he's getting used to the view
 from the other side of the generation gap. Is it possible to imagine a 
future Springsteen album carrying a song that addresses a theme like 
'Independence Day' or 'Used Cars' from the point of view of a 
middle-aged father? Can rock do those things? Should it? <br>
<br>
"Absolutely. I think at different times rock music has encompassed a lot
 of outside topics. People have said it's not good at expressing 
political ideas, for instance. I think it's expressed political ideas 
very well. It hasn't had the power to make political changes but there 
are some great political rock songs. Certainly The Clash wrote some; 
Elvis Costello wrote 'Tramp The Dirt Down,' -- that was a great song. 
It's as good as the singer. I never placed any limits on it. I always 
wanted my shows to be fun where you could come and dance. I wanted my 
records to be the kind you could vacuum the floor to if you want to or 
you could sit down and they could center you or help you make some kind 
of sense of the world you live in. There's nothing particularly that I 
couldn't see myself writing about, I suppose. I don't know if I'm 
looking forward to it, but I guess I'll see what happens." <br>
<br>
* * * <br>
<br>
Later, in a hot, featureless green room across the way from the 
soundstage, as a caretaker empties the bins, he blows on the surface of 
his cup of tea, stares into the middle distance and describes the 
desolation at the heart of 'I Wish I Were Blind.' <br>
<br>
"It's about that sinking feeling," he says, with the same hoarse, amazed
 whisper he uses to introduce songs on stage. "There's a world of love, a
 world of beauty, a world of fear and a world of loss and they are the 
same world and that person is wending his way through that maze and at 
that moment he's very in touch with both of those things. That song gets
 that picture. Most of the stuff does. That's where its universality 
lies. There's a limited interest in your accoutrements, whatever they 
may be. Success makes life easier. It doesn't make living easier. I've 
enjoyed it and I've had great fun with it, but there have been very 
tough times and it's the lucky seat, you know? <br>
<br>
"You've got to be engaged with the stuff that life is made out of. What 
I've tried to do in this new music is that I've previously written a lot
 about certain things which were caught up in my past. I came out of a 
working-class environment, played in working-class bars, and my history 
just drew me towards those topics naturally. I didn't have any 
particular political world view or any rhetoric which I was trying to 
get across in any way. It was just those were the things that felt 
urgent. I wrote a lot about that and I'm proud of that music. But I felt
 at the end of 'Born In The USA' that I'd said all I wanted to say about
 those things. My battles were elsewhere. <br>
<br>
"There was a point where I felt that for me to confront the things that I
 was frightened of lay elsewhere on different battlefields. I pursued 
those things in my music and tried to sort them out in my life at the 
same time, in order to make some real connection beyond the connection 
that I make through my work. On stage, I talk a lot about community but 
it's very difficult for me to connect up with anything. From my youth, I
 had a tendency to be isolated psychologically. All my music is a 
journey towards some sort of connection with both people at large and 
then a person, whether it's in your family or your girlfriend or your 
wife. That's how you remain vital and don't get lost in the furniture 
that comes with making a few bucks. That's what I've pursued. For me, 
this music is about trying to get closer, trying to take down the walls 
that I had left up. Everybody does that. Everybody struggles towards 
feeling good enough about themselves to connect up with someone who can 
shine something good about themselves back on to them. And then to 
invest in it and not be afraid of that investment and not be afraid of 
its commitment or its responsibilities. <br>
<br>
"That's what the guys on these records are struggling towards -- making 
some peace with those things. Everybody does it. It's happening on every
 block in some fashion or other. I felt there were a lot of things I'd 
not written about and I was feeling the results of not having dealt with
 those things in my own experience. And it was roll up your sleeves time
 and get into this: women, friendship, real connection. The way that I 
grew up, men come unprepared, so you've got to prepare yourself if 
you're going to make it." <br>
<br>
Have you ever had therapy? <br>
<br>
"Oh sure. I did anything I could which would help me find my way through
 the thing. Like anything else, it's just a tool that helps you center 
yourself. It's tricky if you grew up the way I grew up. Everybody says, 
you some kind of nut? That old thing. I guess it's commonplace these 
days but I don't want to get into some celebrity bawl-fest." And he 
giggles. " Oh, my trials, my tribulations!" <br>
<br>
There is the view that artists put so much into their work they don't have enough left to live a rounded personal life... <br>
<br>
"I think that's bullshit," he immediately returns. "That's the excuse 
that everybody uses. You do this. You don't have to do anything else. 
You're the guy that plays the guitar, you don't have to sort out your 
relationship with people. I don't believe that's true, not if you want 
to live a realized life." <br>
<br>
* * * <br>
<br>
On June 8 last year, to the strains of various E Street alumni strumming
 a Scottish folk tune, Bruce Springsteen married Patti Scialfa in the 
garden of their Beverly Hills home. They now have two children and lead 
the congenial life of rich Californians, visiting his old home in New 
Jersey for just a couple of months a year. LA offers sun, early nights 
("no later than 11 right now"), relative anonymity and the chance "to 
live in the here and now." <br>
<br>
"I lived in New Jersey for a very long time and I'd written about a lot 
of things which were very tied in to my past, a lot of ghosts you're 
chasing. I felt like whatever they were, that was done for me. I'd taken
 that as far as I could and I was interested in making a break with 
whatever people's perceptions of me were up to that point. In my own 
life, I was just interested in putting some distance between me and not 
New Jersey the state but whatever some part of that meant for me inside.
 <br>
<br>
"I came out. I had a really beautiful house and Patti and I got together
 and had the babies and it was just a good place. I had four or five 
years where I just basically went about my life. It was also a way of 
saying you just move on down the road. People always came West to re- 
find themselves or to re-create themselves in some fashion. This is the 
town of re- creation, mostly in some distorted way, but the raw material
 is here, it's just what you make it. I like the geography, I like the 
desert and a half- hour from my house you're in the San Gabriel 
Mountains where there's a hundred miles and one store. It was just a 
good place to make a new start, and for Patti and I to find each other 
and find ourselves and have our babies." <br>
<br>
The band were ensconced in this rehearsal hall the afternoon of April 30
 when the LA riots began. "You can go five blocks that way and you'll 
see burned out buildings. That was the day when all the invisible walls 
that get put up -- LA is actually a very segregated city -- all the 
walls started falling. You can feel them starting to melt away. The 
inner cities are reaching a critical mass at this point. People have 
been abandoned, thrown away, tossed out. The way that people have dealt 
with it over the past 10 years has just been denial. That's not 
happening here, that's happening over there. The answer has been, let's 
get more police, let's build bigger prisons. <br>
<br>
"I don't even know whether people can look towards government to do the 
job at this point. In the States, people have lost their faith that 
government can tackle those problems. It's hard to see whether people 
themselves have the will to sustain the type of effort that might give 
people a fighting chance in just the small respects of leading a decent 
life. I have a nice house, I live in a great part of town, I made a lot 
of money and I think you feel frustrated. In the days after the riots 
you had military helicopters buzzing 30 feet over your back yard every 
15 minutes. There was a big outpouring of, What can we do? You try to 
figure out what can you do individually and then what can you press on 
your elected representatives to do and then is that really going to be 
enough? I have no idea." <br>
<br>
* * * <br>
<br>
The European leg of the world tour offers a rare opportunity for 
Springsteen fans to see him play indoors, the first such opportunity 
since 1981. ("I was talking to Edwin Starr about British fans last time I
 was there and he felt the same as I did, that those people are with you
 for the long haul.") The likelihood is that the tour will move outdoors
 during the American stage in the late summer. <br>
<br>
"I tend to like to play inside. Even in a big place. I just feel it's 
appropriate. I don't know why. There should be some smoke and some 
sweat. I've had some beautiful nights outside with the moon coming up 
and people having a great time but it's a different kind of experience. A
 stadium is an event in itself. Sixty thousand people in one place is an
 event in itself. In an arena you can still capture quite a bit of the 
concert feel. We just played the Bottom Line and it allowed for a 
certain casualness. You could be a lot less planned. That I probably 
miss. The bigger the place gets, the more you concentrate on focusing 
people, getting their attention in the first place and carrying it where
 the show is going. That takes concentration and preparation. In a club 
you have everybody's attention and so you can change a string, tell a 
story and they'll watch." <br>
<br>
This time around he's unlikely to do any cover versions ("I've got my 
own oldies now") and the smart money is on a leaner kind of show with 
fewer crowd pleasers, a show which will find more favor with hard core 
fans. Is he anticipating any negative reaction? <br>
<br>
"I'm pretty confident of what we're gonna be doing. There's always, I 
wished you'd played this or that or I liked you better when you had a 
beard or when you were young. I've got 20 years behind me at this point 
and everybody's got their favorite part, everybody's got a different 
thing. I don't think about it. All I think about is how to keep it alive
 for me, because if I can't do that it's not going to be any good to 
anybody else. How do I keep it real and keep it alive and keep it vital 
for me and my audience? I'm not interested in being a nostalgia act. 
We'll probably play some of the old things, the stuff that feels like 
it's relevant to what I'm doing now. I had all that in 1978 when I put 
out 'Darkness On The Edge Of Town,' people saying, Hey, you lost it 
after 'Born To Run'! <br>
<br>
"I always wanted my shows to be a little bit like a circus, a touch of 
political rally, a little touch of a lot of different things. Really, in
 the end I want people to go away feeling more connected to each other 
and connected in their own lives and to the whole world around them, and
 to accomplish that you got to be connected. Any good show does that. If
 you went to see Jackie Wilson in the late '60s, he did that, and he did
 it with three songs." <br>
<br>
We wind up and head back across the yard as the shadows lengthen. 
Touring, he says, is not just about promoting your record, it's to do 
with going to meet your audience. "These are people you have a 
relationship with like you have a relationship with your wife, your 
family and friends," he argues. <br>
<br>
"I look at myself and I feel like I'm a lifetime musician. I've had some
 unusual success which surprised me, and I enjoyed it when it happened, 
dealt with it pretty well, played well on the 'Born In The USA' tour and
 if you came and saw the show, you got a pretty good picture of what it 
was like in this country in the '80s. I felt I did good with it but then
 you know there's always the Louie Louie thing..." <br>
<br>
Ah yes, the Louie Louie thing. <br>
<br>
"Yes," he says and leans towards me. "Nobody's quite sure, What IS that guy singing?" He laughs.</div>

New Musical Express ,  Oct 14, 1978<br>
By Tony Parsons<br>
<br>
GREETINGS from the New Jersey shoreline's omnipresent leisure industry 
of endless beaches, boardwalks, amusement parks, souvenir arcades, 
piers, clubs, pubs, bars and sideshow booths... greetings from small 
town life in Asbury Park. NJ. <br>
<br>
Our story begins circa the early '60s. At a strict Catholic school, a 
strange, solitary boy ' of eleven has been caught skipping lessons. His 
punishment is being placed in a class of six- year-olds. <br>
<br>
His arms and legs feel too long for his body as he sits at the dinky 
table and chair built for a mere mite. Stared at by the room full of 
curious Catholic ankle-biters - immobile Lilliputians to his awkward, 
embarrassed Gulliver - he grins self-consciously, his face burning. <br>
<br>
The Sister of Mercy's voice breaks the silence. <br>
<br>
"Let's show this young man", she intones, her eyes never leaving the 
boy, "what we do to children who smile in this class." One of the 
six-year-olds stands up and walks over to where the big kid is sitting. 
Their-eyes are level. Then the small child pulls back his fist and, with
 all the force he can muster from the spirit of the Holy Mother Mary, 
rams it home into the older boy's face. <br>
<br>
"Very good", smiles the Sister. Stunned with shock, shame and pain, the boy clutches his face, fighting back the tears. <br>
<br>
"There's a dark cloud rising from the desert floor/l packed my bags and 
I'm heading straight into the storm/Gonna be a twister to blow 
everything down/That ain't got the faith to stand its ground/Blow away 
the dreams that tear you apart/ Blow away the dreams that break your 
heart/Blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and 
brokenhearted/7he dogs on mainstreet howl 'cause they understand / if I 
could take one. moment into my hands/Mister, I ain't a boy/No, I'm a 
man/And I believe in a Promised Land. " <br>
<br>
*** <br>
<br>
SOME seventeen years later he's slumped in the dressing room at New York
 City's Palladium. After his usua1 three hour sound check that 
afternoon, where he personally covered every last inch of the 3,400 
seater theatre to make sure that the sound was absolutely perfect for 
every kid in the house, he performed the greatest rock 'n' roll show 
that I will ever experience. It lasted for nearly four hours. It will be
 almost dawn before he finally leaves the Palladium. <br>
<br>
Out back there's several hundred kids waiting for autographs, a chance 
to talk to him, an opportunity to thank him. None of them will go home 
disappointed. He's got time for all of them and he doesn't make a big 
deal about it. If you press him on the subject, he'll just get 
thoughtful and reply, "My music gave me everything that I got, I was 
nobody, I had nothing ... I will never put anyone in the position of 
being humiliated. It happened to me for too 1ong." <br>
<br>
And if any other musician in the world said that to me - as you've no 
doubt noticed - I'd wait until I stopped laughing and then it would be 
news sheet mince-meat time. But this geezer is unique; when Bruce 
Springsteen comes out with emotive statements like that don't sneer, I 
BELIEVE. <br>
<br>
When Springsteen played New Orleans on his last American tour a 
middle-aged woman reached up from the stalls and handed him a ring, 
saying that it had been her grandmother's engagement ring. There was a 
plethora of precious stones encrusted on the ring and it was obviously 
worth thousands of dollars. Springsteen thanked her for the thought, but
 said he couldn't take it. The woman refused to take it back, told him 
that she wanted him to keep it and disappeared back into the darkness of
 the auditorium. Shaken, Springsteen handed the ring to the hall's 
management after the show and told them to keep it safe in case the 
woman ever came back to claim it. <br>
<br>
She never did. <br>
<br>
"It gives you a feeling of responsibility, a real heavy feeling of 
responsibility," Springsteen reflects. "I had all these kids coming up 
to me all the time we were making the album and they'd say, 'We know it 
's gonna be great, we know you're gonna do it, it's gonna be great!'... I
 don't wanna let the people that have supported me down. And it ain't 
good enough just getting by, I wanna take it all the way, every 
night..." <br>
<br>
There ain't nothing else that he can do. <br>
<br>
All duded up for Sunday night, the last of three Springsteen dates at 
the Palladium (all ten thousand-plus seats sold in under two hours) this
 is a partisan crowd, hard-core Springsteen followers since the early 
days. They're mostly in their late teens or early twenties; wild and 
loud but without the glass- chucking violence so beloved by the 
mob-handed morons with a mile-wide yellow streak down their backs who 
contaminate gigs back in the good ol' Yew Kay. <br>
<br>
"These kids that come to my shows, they ain't here for trouble, they're 
here to have a good time," Springsteen tells me. "They get kinda noisy 
and excited but the last thing on their mind is busting somebody's 
skull." <br>
<br>
Before every show he plays Springsteen talks to the Security and tells 
them that he doesn't want any rough stuff. He tells them that if there 
is any heavy-handed bouncer antics he'll do everything in his power to 
make sure the individuals responsible are looking for a new job in the 
morning. <br>
<br>
What he doesn't tell them is that if they start beating up on the kids 
then they better be prepared to go through him, too; he personally dives
 into the audience to sort out Security- provoked aggravation. It 
happened time and time again on his last tour. <br>
<br>
"You guys work here?" he demands. "These guys you're roughing up are my friends!" And his fans love him for it... <br>
<br>
"But the Security at the Palladium are okay," he grins. "Never any trouble here. They know me." <br>
<br>
About half of the crowd are from New Jersey and a lot of them remember 
Springsteen jamming in the Upstage club, which he remembers as "some of 
the happiest nights of my life". <br>
<br>
"If there was ever a chance of any of us making a living through music, 
we figured it would be through Bruce", says his guitarist Miami Steve 
Van Zandt of the E Street Band. <br>
<br>
*** <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN had first picked up a guitar (for mirror-posing purposes) at
 nine, the day after gawking at Elvis on the Ed Sullivan show, but he 
didn't start playing until he was a friendless thirteen year old, two 
years after the nun's rough justice in the Catholic class-room. His 
distaste for organised religion ("The smell of the convent made me 
literally throw up"), his lack of self-respect ("I definitely did not 
dig myself") and his loneliness ("It was a very solitary existence, I 
didn't have the flair to be the class clown, it was like I just didn't 
exist") left a life of such awesome nothingness that he was soon 
practising eight hours a day to fill it. <br>
<br>
"My sister, my youngest sister, she's sixteen and she's very pretty and 
very popular. There's no way that she's gonna sit in her room for every 
waking hour." He grins ruefully. "I didn't have that problem." <br>
<br>
By the time he was fourteen he was in his first band, by sixteen he was 
so good that when he practised in a garage kids would stand on milk 
crates with their noses pressed against the window panes to watch him. <br>
<br>
At first none of the countless bars and clubs in New Jersey would allow 
him on their stage because he refused to play Top Forty golden greats. 
Then he was given a chance to strut his stuff at the Upstage and struck 
while his plectrum was hot. From then on he packed out the club for four
 nights a week until he finally met his first manager, Mike Appel. They 
decided to be Elvis and Colonel Tom but it really didn't happen that way
 at all. <br>
<br>
After the CBS contract in the early '70s came "Greetings From Asbury 
Park, N.J. and "The Wild, The Innocent And The E Street Shuffle", both 
in 1973, with only a handful of songs - "Lost In The Flood", "Spirit In 
The Night", "Incident On 57th Street", "Sandy", "Rosalita" - giving a 
clue to the quality to come, the rest of the records too verbose for 
comfort, Springsteen subsequently getting lumbered with one of the New 
Dylan albatrosses that in those days they were giving away instead of 
Green Shield stamps. <br>
<br>
Springsteen went into the studio for a year or so to record his third 
album, m-producing it with Appel and . Rolling Stone scribe Jon Landau, 
and when he came out again the shit was already poised to splatter 
against the proverbial (an, man. "Born To Run" was grandiose, heroic, 
magical, worthy ot some unholy alliance between Phil Spector and Leonard
 Bernstein, a romantic fantasy of sleazy street-life, enormously 
accessible. <br>
<br>
As the hysterical hyperbole af the CBS publicity machine went into 
overdrive, Springsteen played ten sold-out dates at New York's Bottom 
Line to consistently ecstatic audiences, "Born To Run" became a platinum
 album and the single of the same name broke into the American Top 
Twenty. Top of the world, Ma! Then everything began to fall to pieces...
 <br>
<br>
Jon Landau had written an incisive, sensitive, trenchantly subjective 
article on Springsteen tor Rolling Stone in which he succeeded in 
expressing the unique brilliance of the man in intensely personal terms;
 Landau spoke of his love for his girlfriend asleep upstairs as he 
worked at his typewriter, of what the music he had grown up with had 
meant to his life and how witnessing Springsteen that night had been the
 purest exposition of the rock *n' roll spirit that he had seen in many 
years. Landau's piece remains one of the best articles on Springsteen. <br>
<br>
But CBS instigated all-out critical backlash by latching on to one quote
 from the article - "I have seen the future of rock 'n' roll and its 
name is Bruce Springsteen" - taking it completely out of context and 
using it as the masthead for the hard-sell marketing technique overkill 
that rebounded on the record company and Bruce himself with a vengeance.
 "At Last London ls Ready For Bruce Springsteen!" was another one, and I
 remember sneering at it as l walked down City Road, N.1, on my way to 
work one night late in 1975. <br>
<br>
In fairness to Springsteen, no one was innocent when it came to the 
extravagant claims being made on his behalf except for Bruce Springsteen
 himself. As soon as he saw the "FUTURE OF " quote screaming from a 
"Born To Run" advertising billboard he was on the blower to the Fat Cats
 telling them to cut the crap. And when he discovered gratis I Have Seen
 The Future etc "badges being handed out at one of his gigs, well ... <br>
<br>
Meanwhile, back in the boardroom, Appel and Bruce were having the 
initial argument over the distribution of the newly acquired wealth that
 would eventually degenerate into a permanent rift twixt manager and 
musician, both parties filing million-dollar law-suits against the other
 alleging breach of contract. <br>
<br>
Jon Landau became Springsteen's new manager and Appel filed an 
injunction preventing Landau from entering a studio with Springsteen and
 preventing Springsteen entering a studio at all. There followed nearly 
three years of lay-off and litigation. When Bruce should have been out 
on the road consolidating the "Born To Run" victory (he loves touring, 
says he's always fascinated by what his hotel room will look like, how 
big the bed will be, what colour the carpet and wallpaper will be, if 
there'd be any weird pictures on the wall: Ain't he a lovely bloke?) he 
was in front of the legal bar. <br>
<br>
The basis of the disagreement between Appel and Springsteen is routed in
 Bruce's naivety when it comes to contracts and Mickey's when it comes 
to same. Appel had always told Springsteen that he paid the E Street 
Band far too much money but it wasn't until the royalty cheques for 
their first hit album began getting delivered by the truckload that 
Bruce realised how little say he had over the fruits of success he and 
the boys had been working towards for the best part of a decade... <br>
<br>
"We'd suddenly made all this money and contracts we'd signed three years
 before became important. It wasn't so much the money... I wanted my 
songs. Mike had the publishing rights to all my songs... when I signed 
those contracts I didn't even know what publishing was! That whole 
period was just a time in my life that seemed completely out of my 
hands. Business is something that I'm pretty easily intimidated by..." <br>
<br>
Remarkably, Springsteen holds no grudges against Appel. <br>
<br>
"Even when we were in court... he was still a guy that I kinda liked and
 knew that he kinda liked me." The final proof that Springsteen survived
 all the hype, the two years in court and the looooong time in the 
wilderness of enforced retirement is "Darkness On The Edge Of Town". He 
has returned with infinitely more maturity, power, soul and tire on his 
fingertips than he ever had in hi ? life. "That album... it's about 
people refusing to let go of their humanity. <br>
<br>
No matter what they go through, no matter what life does to them, they never lei go of their humanity." <br>
<br>
*** <br>
<br>
"BROOOOOOOOOSE!!!" from three and a half thousand throats and the lights
 go on as the E Streeters hips the opening chords of "Badlands": the 
same epic, awesome waves of invigorating beautiful noise as before; hut 
Springsteen, striding the planks grinning, his Fender hanging loose on 
his back, gripping the hand mike tight in both hands, dapper in black 
jacket and strides ... once he starts spitting out the lyrics, makes it 
plain where he's been all this time, how he's not the same anymore... 
"Lights out tonight/Trouble in the heartland/Got a head-on 
collision/Smashin' in my guts, man/I'm caught up in a cross-fire that I 
DONT UNDERSTANDI/BUT THERE'S ONE THING I KNOW FOR SURE, GIRL!!" "I was 
disappointed that the reviews of the album said it sounded depressed," 
Bruce told me later. "I spelled it out (or 'em on the first track <br>
<br>
"I don 'i give a damn for the same old played our scenes/Honey, I don't 
give a damn for just the inbetweens, Honey, I want - the - heart - I- 
want - the - soul - I want - control right now." Raw, exhilarating, 
inspirational... the superlative dictionary is right down the dumper, 
John. Springsteen - be it in conversation, on record and ESPEClALLY on 
stage often appears too good to be true. You look for the catch, the 
flaw, the giveaway. And you look and you LOOK and you keep looking until
 you finally concede that there isn't a catch. He's the one. <br>
<br>
After two years of showbiz decadence, all the free albums and concert 
tickets, Springsteen is the only geezer I'd actually pay money to go and
 see. He's the only person who makes me feel like a fan again. "I 
believe in the Love you gave Me/l believe in the faith that can save 
me!/I believe in the faith and I pray that someday it may raise me... 
above these... badlands!!!" <br>
<br>
This is joyous, optimistic rock music. It's what rock 'n' roll should 
have been about and rarely was. He's not, unfortunately, the future of 
rock'n'roll; he's so good, so vital, so honest that he shows the 
majority of the rest of 'em up for the squalid cretins they are. The day
 he quits is the day the music really dies... this guy, this rocker, has
 actually got some backbone to his work, some MORAL FIBRE. "Yeah, 
there's a lotta morality in the show, and it's a very strict morality. 
Anybody that works for me has gotta understand that. I know how I'd feel
 if I paid money to see a show and what I wanted wasn't delivered. It 
comes back to the responsibility thing..." <br>
<br>
1've seen great gigs before; The Clash at Harlesden in '77, The Who at 
the Rainbow in '71, Bowie in Newcastle earlier this year, the Pistols on
 the Jubilee boat trip or at the two Screen On The Green dates, but what
 Bruce Springsteen does transcends all of those without a photo-finish. 
This ain't just the best gig I've ever seen in my life, it's much more 
than that. It's like watching you're entire life flashing by and instead
 of dying, you're dancing. <br>
<br>
Springsteen sings a love song and he doesn't make you smirk the way you 
would at some fat- zero axe-hero mucho macho man; he makes you ache for 
the girl you love, he makes you remember her and wish she were here 
tonight so you wouldn't have to go home alone and without her. I didn't 
know music could do that to YOU. <br>
<br>
And Springsteen documents the conflict between father and son better 
than anyone since Steinbeck in East Of Eden. There's the raging "Adam 
Raised A Cain" but the real killer is the unrecorded "Independence Day",
 possibly the most poignant, moving ballad he's ever writ ten. I was 
close to tears. At first I thought it was because either I'm too 
sensitive or else I'm getting soft but then I realised that rock 'n' 
roll rarely gets this real. <br>
<br>
"Well, Papa, I don't know what a was with the two of us/We chose the 
words and, yeah, we drew the . lines/This house, no how could it hold 
the two of us/I guess that we were just too much of the same kind/So say
 goodbye, it 's Independence Day/AII boys must run away... come 
Independence Day/Oh say goodbye, it's Independence Day/All men must make
 their way/Come Independence Day... " You want it, you take it you pay 
the price..." Springsteen, apart from everything else, is also a born 
performer, frequently jumping off stage and running into the heart of 
the auditorium, one hand on the mike and another wrapped around a kid in
 a display of genuine affection. <br>
<br>
The E Street Band is a revelation; Danny Federici on organ and Roy 
Bittan on piano, Steve Van Zandt on guitar, the golden sax of The Big 
Man Clarence Clemons as always the most important instrument after 
Springsteen's impassioned, howling voice and with it all nailed down 
solid by the relentlessly strident rhythm section of Garry Tallent on 
bass and Max Weinberg on drums. The sound is as full and vibrant as on 
vinyl but Springsteen's meticulously perfectionist attitude to sound 
checks and the electric urgency applied to performing live by everyone 
on stage takes Springsteen's music to awesome, unprecedented extremes of
 excellence. <br>
<br>
"Something In The Night" and "Streets Of Fire" were both recorded for 
"Darkness" in just one take. The latter is yet another gem on stage, 
Springsteen alone at the front of the darkened stage, haunted, tortured,
 agonising like some tormented Prince Of Denmark yet totally believable.
 <br>
<br>
"When the night's quiet, and you don't care anymore/And your eyes are 
tired/And someone's at your door/And you realize... you wanna let go/And
 the weak lies and the cold walls you embrace..." The vocal building, 
the bitter bile of undiluted fury rising in his throat. "Eat at your 
insides and - leave - you - face - to - face with STREEEETS 
OFFIII-RRRE!!! <br>
<br>
And "Factory", possibly the most accurate recording of the drab, dull, 
soul-destroying boredom of working-class existence ever put on black 
plastic. Kraftwerk, Devo and all those other industrial-togged turds ...
 do you really believe - and you can add your darling Davie-poo to that 
list - that their product is "industrial factory folk-muzak of mass-man 
in the machine- age" undsoweiter. You do? You poor; deluded git. I bet 
you never done a day's work in your miserable life. <br>
<br>
"Early in the morning factory whistle blows/Man rises from bed and puts 
on his clothes/Man takes his lunch, walks out into the morning light's 
the work, the working, just the working life/ Through the mansions of 
fear, through the mansions of pain, I see my daddy walking through those
 factory gates in the rain/Factory takes his hearing, factory gives Him 
life/It's the work, the working, just the working life/End of the day, 
factory whistle cries/Men walk through these gates with death in their 
eyes/And you just better believe boy/Somebody's gonna get hurt 
tonight/It's the work, the working, just the working life... " <br>
<br>
I love that song. But then I'm still a bit mutt 'n' jeff from 
Distiller's so then I'm biased. Springsteen performs all of "Darkness On
 The Edge Of Town", all of "Born To Run", early songs like "Spirit In 
The Night" and "Incident On 57th Street". <br>
<br>
He performs great songs that he gave to other people - "Faith" (Robert 
Gordon), "Fever" (Southside Johnny), "Because The Night" (Patti Smith) -
 all of them cutting the cover versions to shreds, smouldering lust 
paeans, love bites back ... <br>
<br>
That's Bruce's one fault to my mind - he's too GENEROUS: nobody else in 
the history of rock 'n' roll has given songs of that quality away. 
Still, I guess he can afford it, the geezer is a genius, after all. And 
when he's played for nearly four hours and it's way past midnight and 
the houselights have been on for over half an hour but we just won't go 
away, we refuse to leave the auditorium, we just stand on our seats and 
scream BROOOOOOOOSE!!! MOOOOOOORE!!! BROOOOOOSE!!!' he comes back and 
plays on, all old Juke Box giants, Buddy Holly songs, "Quarter To 
Three", "Devil With The Blue Dress On" and many, many more (no, 1 didn't
 take notes). And then you're heart sinks because it's all over. <br>
<br>
What can I tell you, kid? God, 1 wish you could have been there. <br>
<br>
*** <br>
<br>
BRUCE has collapsed," his manager Jon Landau tells me thirty minutes 
after the end of the show. "We'll have to cancel the interview. He's in a
 state of exhaustion. He can't talk to anyone now." Usually, I'd know 
that I was getting served bullshit and the rock star I was ready to 
interrogate had pissed off back to a.gram of coke in the Ritz and was at
 this moment writhing around in the back of his limo with leather 
strides around his ankles and a big, fat groupie sitting on him. <br>
<br>
With Springsteen it's different; all I can think is... Christ, I hope he's gonna be all right. <br>
<br>
But I stick around inside the Palladium, just thinking about the gig. 
Shit, I got a plane to catch early in the morning so I might as well 
stay up all night. I couldn't sleep after a show like that anyhow. "You 
can come backstage and meet Bruce if you want to," Landau tells me and 
my heart starts a-pounding. Kid, I've met 'em all... Led Zeppelin, The 
Rolling Stones, the Pistols, Mike Batt, you name it. Never in my life 
have I felt awe at the thought of meeting a musician before ... Well, I 
was afraid I'd be let down. Of course, I wasn't; he's exactly what he 
seems to be - open, honest, warm, personable, friendly, funny, probably 
the most likeable geezer I've met in my life. Five feet nine inches with
 a muscular, tanned, athletic build, an easy smile and a hoarse, rasping
 laugh, he's relaxed and talkative, ready to listen and you feel like 
you've known him all your life. <br>
<br>
As you've no doubt sussed, I was meant just to say hi and split but me 
and Bruce got talking and we just couldn't stop. He talks about the 
album for a while and when he asks me what I think of it and I tell him 
it's nowhere near as accessible as "Born To Run" but after repeated 
playings it stands up as by far the best thing he's ever done, he 
actually breathes a sigh of relief. <br>
<br>
"Phew, that's good... that's what we want people to react like when they
 hear it." But, Bruce, surely you ain't worried about it... you must 
know how good it is... <br>
<br>
"Ah, people tell ya so many different things... I just want the people 
who care about me to know what I'm trying to do. See, it couldn't be an 
innocent album like 'Born To Run' because things ain't like that for me 
anymore. The characters on the new album ain't kids, they're older - you
 been beat, you been hurt - but there's still hope, there's always hope.
 They throw dirt on you all your life and some people get buried so deep
 in the dirt that they never get out. The album's about the people 
who'll never admit they're buried too deep to get out." <br>
<br>
Bruce talks about the three nights he sold-out Madison Square Garden in 
the summer. "I don't usually like playing places that big but that was 
for all the long-time supporters, so they could all get in and see 
us..." <br>
<br>
On the first night he brought his sixteen-year-old sister Pam on stage after dedicating "Sweet Little Sixteen" to her. <br>
<br>
And before the final encore on the last Garden date he was dragged back 
on stage by his Italian mother Adele (his father, Douglas, is Irish, 
once a factory worker in New Jersey and now a bus-driver in Northern 
California). Bruce was screaming in protest as Adele dragged him to the 
mike, "Aw, Mom'. I can't do anymore! I just played four hours! I can't 
do no more!" <br>
<br>
The Garden dates were typical Springsteen gigs; intimate and chaotic 
both, more like a great party than a rock 'n' roll show, yet 
paradoxically the greatest rock 'n' roll show in the world. <br>
<br>
I inform him that I was at Madison Square Garden a few days ago, 
standing out front and trying to sell two ELO tickets that CBS had given
 me. After getting hassled by the local spivs and unable to unload the 
tickets I decided to take a look inside and use the tickets myself. 
After seeing that the Garden was just another Wembley and reluctant to 
watch an ELO show, I decided to leave. But though, the Garden was geared
 to take thousands upon thousands of - people into the auditorium, there
 was no provision for letting people out. All stairs, all halls, all 
escalators were strictly one way. Travelling in the opposite direction 
just wasn't allowed. Eventually, I got out. I had to get thrown out by 
the cops, Bruce. But this fat cop called 'Heavy' was very nice about it,
 he only bounced me on the pavement once and waved his nightstick at me 
but never hit me with it. <br>
<br>
Bruce cracks up with laughter. "Hey, I never thought what would happen if somebody wanted to get OUT of one of my shows!!" <br>
<br>
And the dogs on Main Street howl, 'cause they understand.</div>

<br>
THE Making of a Rock Star<br>
<br>
<br>
Newsweek , 1975-10-27<br>
By Janet Huck, Peter S. Greenberg<br>
<br>
The movie marquee in Red Bank, N.J., simply said "HOMECOMING" because 
everyone knew who was home. Out in the audience was Cousin Frankie, who 
taught him his first guitar chords. So were the guys from Freehold High 
who played in his early rock 'n' roll bands. They did not have to be 
hyped on Bruce Springsteen. This was the scruffy kid they had seen for 
years in the bars and byways of coastal Jersey. But Bruce was suddenly 
big time. The rock critics, the media, the music-industry heavies all 
said so. And in Red Bank, Bruce showed them just how far he had come. 
With Elvis shimmies and Elton leaps, Springsteen re-created his own 
electric brand of '50s rock 'n' roll magic. He clowned with saxophonist 
Clarence Clemons, hustled and bumped his way around the stage and gave a
 high-voltage performance that lasted more than two hours. When he 
leaned into the microphone, ripped off his black leather jacket and 
blasted, "Tramps like us, baby, we were born to run," the Jersey teeny- 
boppers went wild. After four footstomping encores they were ready to 
crown Bruce Springsteen the great white hope of rock 'n' roll. <br>
<br>
The official investiture took place last week in Los Angeles at 
Springsteen's carefully staged West Coast debut, at the Roxy Night Club 
on Sunset Strip. At the kind of opening-night event that defines hip 
status for at least six months, new Hollywood and rock royalty embraced 
Bruce Springsteen as one of their own. In a rare ovation that lasted a 
full four minutes, Jack Nicholson, Ryan and daughter Tatum O'Neal, 
Wolfman Jack and Neil Diamond seconded Cousin Frankie and the boys from 
Freehold High in Red Bank. Bruce Springsteen was a superstar. <br>
<br>
Bruce who? He is still not exactly a household name across America. In 
San Mateo, Calif. last week, his 13-year-old sister Pam said, "Only one 
girl at school has his record." The bus driver's son -- who bears a 
striking resemblance to Dylan, sports black leather jackets like Brando 
in "The Wild One" and wears a gold hoop earring -- was known to only a 
small coterie of East Coast devotees a year ago. But since the release 
last August of his highly professional third album, "Born to Run," which
 rocketed to a million-dollar gold album in six weeks, 26-year-old Bruce
 Springsteen has exploded into a genuine pop-music phenomenon. He has 
already been compared to all the great performers -- Elvis, Dylan and 
Mick Jagger. And rock critic Robert Hilburn of The Los Angeles Times 
called him "the purest glimpse of the passion and power of rock 'n' roll
 in nearly a decade." Springsteen's own insistence on performing in 
small halls and clubs has created a kind of cult hysteria and his 
emergence as one of the most exciting live acts in rock today has only 
added to the mystique. Springsteen buttons, T shirts, decals, key chains
 and three different kinds of wall posters are currently the hot rock 
paraphernalia. In fact, Bruce Springsteen has been so heavily praised in
 the press and so tirelessly promoted by his record company, Columbia, 
that the publicity about his publicity is now a dominant issue in his 
career. And some people are asking whether Bruce Springsteen will be the
 biggest superstar or the biggest hype of the '70s. <br>
<br>
In a $2 billion industry that thrives on smash hits, the artist who 
grabs the public's emotions the way Elvis or the Beatles once did is the
 fantasy of rock critics and record-industry pros alike. Springsteen's 
punk image, his husky, wailing voice, his hard-driving blues-based music
 and his passionate, convoluted lyrics of city lowlife, fast cars and 
greaser rebellion recall the dreams of the great rock 'n' roll rage of 
the 1950s: <br>
<br>
Well now I'm no hero That's understood All the redemption I can offer, girl Is beneath this dirty hood <br>
<br>
But he also injects the images with a new sophistication: <br>
<br>
The highway's jammed with broken heroes On a last-chance power drive 
Everybody's out on a run tonight But there's no place left to hide <br>
<br>
Some critics, however, find Springsteen's music one-dimensional, 
recycled teen dreams. "Springsteen's lyrics are an effusive jumble," 
music critic Henry Edwards wrote in The New York Times, "his melodies 
either second-hand or undistinguished and his performance tedious. Given
 such flaws there has to be another important ingredient to the success 
of Bruce Springsteen: namely, vigorous promotion." Even some of his 
champions like disk jockey Denny Sanders of WMMS in Cleveland agree on 
that point. "Columbia is going overboard on Springsteen," he says. "He 
is the only unique artist to come out of the '70s, but because the rock 
'n' roll well is really dry, they are going crazy for Springsteen." <br>
<br>
As the real world has caught up with the record world, the penny-pinched
 economy has begun to erode the record industry. Album sales are down 
(Warner Brothers, for one, is off by nearly 20 per cent), the albums 
going to the top of the charts are getting there on fewer sales while 
advertising budgets are being drastically slashed. "Unless an act has a 
great potential for sales," says one record-company executive, "the 
companies won't spend the big dollars." <br>
<br>
Too often, the companies have gotten burned when they spent their money 
on the sizzle and forgot the steak. Bell Records dished out more than 
$100,000 last year in parties to promote an act nobody ever heard of -- 
Gary Glitter -- and people are still asking who he is. Atlantic 
bankrolled the rock group Barnaby Bye for an estimated $200,000 but 
failed to turn up any album sales. MGM decided to promote a 
singer-songwriter named Judi Pulver. They sent her to a Beverly Hills 
diet doctor, created a Charles Schulz "Peanuts" ad campaign, rented a 
Boeing 720 to fly journalists to her opening in San Francisco and even 
got astronaut Edgar Mitchell to go along for the ride. When the evening 
was over, the inevitable truth set in. Judi Pulver just couldn't carry 
the hype. MGM's $100,000 experiment bombed. <br>
<br>
Everyone in the industry is aware of the pitfalls of The Hype and 
insiders think that the current Springsteen mania might inflict damage 
on his career. "All the attention Bruce is getting now might hurt him 
later on," says Hilburn. "What I'm afraid of is that while Springsteen 
has all the potential everyone says he has, it's still chiefly 
potential. I just hope he's strong enough to stand up under the 
pressure." Warner Brothers Records president Joe Smith appreciates the 
"tumult" Bruce is creating for the industry but is dubious about the 
extent of his ultimate influence on the development of music. "He's a 
hot new artist now," says Smith, "but he's not the new messiah and I 
question whether he will establish an international mania. He's got a 
very long way to go before he does what Elton has done, or Rod Stewart 
or The Rolling Stones or Led Zeppelin." <br>
<br>
Bruce himself is concerned about the effect the publicity campaign will 
have on his creative equilibrium. "What phenomenon? What phenomenon?" 
Springsteen asked in exasperation last week while driving up from Jersey
 to New York. "We're driving around, and we ain't no phenomenon. The 
hype just gets in the way. People have gone nuts. It's weird. All the 
stuff you dream about is there, but it gets diluted by all the other 
stuff that jumped on you by surprise." <br>
<br>
Springsteen is experiencing superstar culture shock. He has never 
strayed far from his best friends like Miami Steve Van Zandt and Gary 
Tallent, who are in his E Street Band. He has spent hours hanging out on
 the boardwalk at Asbury Park, N.J., and listening to the barkers tell 
their tales. For gigs, he used to hitchhike to New York to play his 
guitar in Greenwich Village. In both places, he found the cast of 
characters who people his lyrics -- Spanish Johnny, the Magic Rat, 
Little Angel, Puerto Rican Jane. They inspired him but they didn't 
corrupt him. Springsteen rarely drinks, does not smoke, doesn't touch 
dope and never swears in front of women. <br>
<br>
"I'm a person -- people tend to forget that kind of thing," he says. "I 
got a rock 'n' roll band I think is one of the best ones. I write about 
things I believe that are still fun for me. I love drivin' around in my 
car when I'm 26 and I'll still love drivin' around in my car when I'm 
36. Those aren't irrelevant feelings for me." The feelings usually find 
their way to vinyl. "The record is my life," says Springsteen. "The band
 is my life. Rock 'n' roll has been everything to me. The first day I 
can remember lookin' in the mirror and standin' what I was seein' was 
the day I had a guitar in my hand." <br>
<br>
Throughout his unconventional career, Springsteen has found people who 
felt he was born to star. From the moment he and his abrasive new 
manager, Mike Appel, walked into Columbia Records in 1972 to audition 
for the legendary John Hammond -- discoverer of Billie Holiday, Aretha 
Franklin and Bob Dylan -- Springsteen was the object of high-pressure 
salesmanship. "I went into a state of shock as soon as I walked in, says
 Springsteen. "Before I ever played a note Mike starts screamin' and 
yellin' 'bout me. I'm shrivelin' up and thinkin', 'Please, Mike, give me
 a break. Let me play a damn song.' So, dig this, before I ever played a
 note the hype began." <br>
<br>
"The kid absolutely knocked me out," Hammond recalls. "I only hear 
somebody really good once every ten years, and not only was Bruce the 
best, he was a lot better than Dylan when I first heard him." Within a 
week, Springsteen was signed to Columbia and although he and Appel had 
little previous recording experience, they insisted on producing their 
own album -- the uneven "Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J." released in 
January 1973. At the time Bruce had no band; he sang alone with an 
acoustic guitar. And because of the originality of his lyrics -- and 
perhaps the familiarity of their cadence -- he was compared to Dylan. <br>
<br>
Oh, some hazard from Harvard Was skunked on beer playin' Backyard 
bombardier Yes and Scotland Yard was trying Hard, they sent some dude 
with a Callin' card He said, "Do what you like but don't do it here." <br>
<br>
The comparison was so tantalizingly close that Columbia promoted the 
first album with ads announcing they had the new Bob Dylan. The cover 
letter on the records Columbia sent to the DJ's flatly stated the same 
thing. But the hard sell backfired. "The Dylan hype from Columbia was a 
turnoff," said Dave Herman, the early-morning DJ for WNEW-FM, the trend-
 setting pop station in New York. "I didn't even bother to listen to it.
 I didn't want Columbia to think they got me." <br>
<br>
Without radio airplay -- the single most important ingredient in any hit
 -- a record dies. Though the Springsteen campaign was a special project
 of then Columbia president Clive Davis, who personally read 
Springsteen's lyrics on a promotional film, and even though Bruce got 
good notices from important rock publications like Crawdaddy, only a 
handful of the 100 or so major FM stations across the country played 
him. The record sold less than 50,000 copies. "He was just another media
 hype that failed," said Herman. "He was already a dead artist who 
bombed out on his first album." <br>
<br>
Springsteen's personal appearance at the Columbia Records convention in 
the summer of 1973 was his biggest bomb. "It was during a period when he
 physically looked like Dylan," says Hammond. "He came on with a chip on
 his shoulder and played too long. People came to me and said, 'He 
really can't be that bad, can he, John?'" <br>
<br>
That fall, Springsteen's second album, "The Wild, The Innocent &amp; the
 E Street Shuffle," was released. Again it got some terrific reviews -- 
Rolling Stone later named it one of the best albums of 1974 -- but it 
sold even less than his first LP. This time, accompanying a stack of 
favorable reviews, the DJ's got a letter from Springsteen's manager 
Appel saying "What the hell does it take to get airplay?" Meanwhile, 
Springsteen had a disastrous experience playing as the opening act for 
the supergroup Chicago on tour, and he refused to do what most new rock 
acts must do to get exposure -- play short, 45-minute sets in huge halls
 before the main act goes on. <br>
<br>
Columbia began to ignore Springsteen because he couldn't make a best- 
selling album or hit- single. But Springsteen was getting better in his 
live performances and was starting to build followings in towns like 
Austin and Philadelphia, Phoenix and Cleveland. "The key to Bruce's 
success was to get people to see him," says Ron Oberman, a Columbia 
staffer who pushed hard for Springsteen's first album within the 
company. After a concert in Cleveland, says local DJ Sanders, 
"Springsteen was a smash, and requests zoomed up. We had played him 
before but now the requests stayed on." <br>
<br>
ln April 1974, Jon Landau, the highly respected record editor of Rolling
 Stone, caught Bruce's act in Boston, went home and wrote an emotional 
piece for the Real Paper stating, "I saw rock and roll future and its 
name is Bruce Springsteen." Landau's review was the turning point in 
Springsteen's faltering career -- for the artist as well as the company.
 "At the time," says Springsteen, "Landau's quote helped reaffirm a 
belief in myself. The band and I were making $50 a week. It helped me go
 on. I realized I was gettin' through to somebody." Columbia cannily 
used the blurb in marketing Springsteen's second album and other critics
 began to take notice. It was the first time a record label used the 
prestige of a rock critic to push an artist so hard. <br>
<br>
"His first two albums' not selling was the best possible thing for 
Bruce," says the 28-year-old Landau. "It gave him time to develop a 
strong identity without anyone pushing him prematurely. For twelve years
 he has had time to learn how to play every kind of rock 'n' roll. He 
has far more depth than most artists because he really has roots in a 
place -- coastal Jersey, where no record company scouts ever visit." <br>
<br>
One month after the Landau review, Springsteen, alone with Mike Appel in
 a sparsely equipped studio in upstate New York, began to record his 
third album -- his last chance to make it. It took three months to 
record the title song, "Born to Run," and Columbia immediately sent it 
out to some key people to review for singles potential. The word came 
back: It's not top 40, forget it, it's too long. Then the ever-assertive
 Appel released a rough mix of the song to a handful of stations that 
had played Springsteen. <br>
<br>
The response was overwhelmingly positive. The stations wanted the 
record. But the potential superstar was in the studio for the next six 
months unable to finish his masterpiece. "He told me he was having 
trouble getting the sound he heard in his head on record," says Landau. 
In April 1975, a year after his review, Landau became an adviser on the 
album and quit his job at Rolling Stone to be come co-producer. He moved
 them into a better studio, and helped shape the album into a heavily 
produced wall of pulsating sound. <br>
<br>
Last June, a group of Columbia executives heard a rough cut of the album
 and decided to launch an unprecedented campaign. Building on the Landau
 quote and $40,000 worth of radio spots on FM stations in twelve major 
markets, they promoted the first two dud albums, mentioning a third was 
on the way. It worked. Sales for the first two LP's climbed back on the 
charts, more than doubling their original sales. <br>
<br>
Columbia knew it had a winner; the question was how to showcase the act.
 Appel, without consulting Springsteen, thought big. He asked a booking 
agent to get 20,000-seat Madison Square Garden for an artist who had 
never sold more than 150,000 records. He finally settled on the 400-seat
 Bottom Line club in Greenwich Village for the week before the release 
of the third album last August. The tickets sold out in three and a half
 days, with Columbia picking up 980 of the 400O tickets for the media 
"tastemakers." "Columbia put it on the line," said DJ Richard Neer of 
WNEW-FM, "They said, 'Go see him. If you don't like him, don't play him 
-- don't write about him'." With the tickets so limited in number, the 
ensuing hysteria created more press coverage and critical acclaim for 
Springsteen -- who delivered topnotch shows -- than any recent event of 
its kind. "It was a very intelligent use of an event," says Stan 
Snadowsky, co-owner of the Bottom Line. "Columbia got all the right 
people down there." DJ Dave Herman, who refused to even play 
Springsteen's first album because of the hype, was completely won over. 
The next day he apologized on the air. "I saw Springsteen for the first 
time last night," he told his audience. "It's the most exciting rock 'n'
 roll show I've ever seen." <br>
<br>
Orders for the new album, which had been given an initial press ordering
 of 175,000, came in at 350,000. The LP has sold 600,000 so far, and 
Columbia has spent $200,000 promoting it. By the end of the year they 
will spend an additional $50,000 for TV spots on the album. "These are 
very large expenditures for a record company; we depend on airplay, 
which cannot be bought," says Bruce Lundvall, Columbia Records' vice 
president. "What the public does not understand is that when you spend 
$100,000 on an album for a major artist, your investment is not so much 
on media as on the number of people you have out there pushing the 
artist for airplay." Now, for the first time, a Springsteen single, 
"Born to Run, has broken through many major AM stations, where the mass 
audience listens. <br>
<br>
The stakes are enormous, since a hot album can earn up to several 
million dollars for the record company in a matter of a few weeks. Today
 Bruce Springsteen is still a promising rookie. Nobody knows whether he 
can sell like Elton John or even lesser publicized groups like Earth, 
Wind &amp; Fire -- a group that will ship more than 750,000 initial 
orders with the release of its new LP. Because of his enormous build-up,
 Springsteen now has the awesome task of fulfilling everyone's fantasy 
of what a new rock hero should be. And most of the country -- which 
isn't even aware of Springsteen yet -- may or may not agree that he is 
born to succeed. "Bruce is undergoing a backlash right now," says Irwin 
B. Segelstein, President of Columbia Records, "but even his critics are 
treating him importantly." <br>
<br>
Springsteen himself has not yet seen any big bucks. He keeps 22 people 
on his payroll. He maintains sophisticated sound and lighting equipment 
for his shows and has a video crew following him everywhere. He only 
plays small halls where he can barely cover his expenses, but that 
hasn't put a crimp in his style. He has just moved into his first home, a
 sparsely furnished cottage overlooking the ocean -- about a 10-minute 
drive from the Asbury Park boardwalk. His girl friend, 20-year-old Karen
 Darbin, a Springsteen fan from Texas, lives across the Hudson River in 
Manhattan. In Bruce's garage stands his prized possession -- a '57 
yellow Chevy convertible customized with orange flames, the same color 
as his first guitar. <br>
<br>
On the eve of his West Coast debut last week, Springsteen seemed to be 
down. "People keep telling me I ought to be enjoying all this but it's 
sort of depressing to me." He riffled through his beloved '50s records 
-- Elvis and Dion -- from stacks of albums on the floor, which also 
included Gregorian chants, David Bowie and Marvin Gaye. "Now this," 
Bruce announces in a faintly Jimmy Durante delivery, "is the sound of 
universes colliding." The room fills with Phil Spector's classic 
production of the Ronettes' "Baby I Love You." Springsteen swoons. "Come
 on, do the greaser two-step," he says, beginning to dance. <br>
<br>
Although Springsteen is a German name, Bruce is mostly Italian, and he 
inherited his storytelling ability from his Neapolitan grandfather 
Zirili. "In the third grade a nun stuffed me into a garbage can under 
her desk because she told me that's where I belonged," he relates. "I 
also had the distinction of being the only altar boy knocked down by a 
priest on the steps of the altar during Mass. The old priest got mad. My
 Mom wanted me to learn how to serve Mass but I didn't know what I was 
doin' so I was tryin' to fake it." <br>
<br>
He finally saved $18 to buy his first guitar -- "one of the most 
beautiful sights I have ever seen in my life" -- and at age 14, 
Springsteen joined his first band. He was originally a Rolling Stones 
fanatic but gradually worked back to early rock. "We used to play the 
Elks Club, the Rollerdrome and the local insane asylum," he says. "We 
were always terrified at the asylum. One time this guy in a suit got up 
and introduced us for twenty minutes sayin' we were greater than the 
Beatles. Then the doctors came up and took him away." <br>
<br>
Springsteen's parents moved to California when he was 16, but he stayed 
behind scuffling in local bands. A year later he drove across country --
 someone else had to shift because Bruce did not know how to drive -- to
 play a New Year's Eve gig at the Esalen Institute. "I've never been 
outta Jersey in my life and suddenly I get to Esalen and see all these 
people walkin' around in sheets," he says. "I see someone playing bongos
 in the woods and it turns out to be this guy who grew up around the 
corner from me." "Everybody expected Bruce to come back from California a
 star," says his old friend "Southside Johnny" Lyon who used to play 
with Bruce at the Stone Pony bar in Asbury Park. But according to Bruce,
 "nobody wanted to listen to a guy with a guitar." <br>
<br>
They do today. Onstage Springsteen projects the same kind of high school
 macho and innocence that many young male fans, for whom glitter is 
dull, strongly identify with. Women think he's sexy and it's likely 
he'll end up with a movie contract. "He's able to say what we can't 
about growing up," said John Bordonaro, 23, a telephone dispatcher from 
the Bronx who traveled to Red Bank to see Bruce in concert. "He's 
talking about hanging around in cars in front of the Exxon sign. He's 
talking about getting your hands on your very first convertible. He's 
telling us it's our last chance to pull something off, and he's doing it
 for us." "The peace and love movement is gone," chimed in his friend, 
Chris Williams. "We have to make a shot now or settle into the masses." <br>
<br>
The question is will Bruce Springsteen be able to reach the masses? 
"Let's face it," says Joe Smith of Warner Brothers Records. "He's a kid 
with a beard in his 20s from New Jersey who happens to sing songs. He's 
not going to jump around any more than Elton. His voice won't be any 
sweeter than James Taylor's and his lyrics won't be any heavier than 
Dylan's." <br>
<br>
Springsteen's promoters would disagree, but they don't think it matters.
 "The industry is at the bottom of the barrel," declares Springsteen's 
manager Mike Appel, 32, as he paces around the Manhattan office once 
occupied by Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman. "We've got people 
scratching around for new talent. There's an amazing paucity of talent 
because there hasn't been anyone isolated enough to create a distinctive
 point of view." He whispers dramatically, "What I'm waiting for, what 
Bruce Springsteen is waiting for, and we're all waiting for is something
 that makes you want to dance!" He shouts, "Something we haven't had for
 seven or eight years! Today anything remotely bizarre is gobbled up as 
the next thing. What you've got to do is get the universal factors, to 
get people to move in the same three or four chords. It's the real 
thing! Look up America! Look up America!" Appel sat down. Hypes are as 
American as Coca-Cola so perhaps -- in one way or another -- Bruce 
Springsteen *is* the Real Thing.<br>

The Backstreets Phantom of Rock<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
Time , 1975-10-27<br>
By Jay Cocks et al<br>
<br>
The rock-'n'-roll generation: everybody grows up by staying young. <br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is onto this. ln fact, he has written a song about it: <br>
<br>
I pushed B-52 and bombed 'em with the blues With my gear set stubborn on
 standing I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school Never once 
gave thought to landing. I hid in the clouded warmth of the crowd, But 
when they said "Come down" I threw up. Ooh... growin' up. <br>
<br>
He has been called the "last innocent in rock." which is at best partly 
true, but that is how he appears to audiences who are exhausted and on 
fire at the end of a concert. Springsteen is not a golden California boy
 or a glitter queen from Britain. Dressed usually in leather jacket and 
shredded undershirt, he is a glorified gutter rat from a dying New 
Jersey resort town who walks with an easy swagger that is part residual 
stage presence, part boardwalk braggadocio. He nurtures the look of a 
lowlife romantic even though he does not smoke, scarcely drinks and 
disdains every kind of drug. <br>
<br>
In all other ways, however, he is the dead-on image of a rock musician: 
Street smart but sentimental, a little enigmatic, articulate mostly 
through his music. For 26 years Springsteen has known nothing but 
poverty and debt until, just in the past few weeks, the rock dream came 
true for him. ("Man, when I was nine I couldn't imagine anyone not 
wanting to be Elvis Presley.") But he is neither sentimental nor 
superficial. His music is primal, directly in touch with all the 
impulses of wild humor and glancing melancholy, street tragedy and punk 
anarchy that have made rock the distinctive voice of a generation. <br>
<br>
Springsteen's songs are full of echoes -- of Sam Cooke and Elvis 
Presley, of Chuck Berry, Roy Orbison and Buddy Holly. You can also hear 
Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and the Band weaving among Springsteen's 
elaborate fantasias. The music is a synthesis, some Latin and soul, and 
some good jazz riffs too. The tunes are full of precipitate breaks and 
shifting harmonies, the lyrics often abstract, bizarre, wholly personal.
 <br>
<br>
Springsteen makes demands. He figures that when he sings <br>
<br>
Baby this town rips the bones from your back It's a death trap, it's a 
suicide rap We gotta get out while we're young 'Cause tramps like us, 
baby we were born to run. <br>
<br>
Everybody is going to know where he's coming from and just where he's heading. <br>
<br>
Springsteen first appeared in the mid-'60s for a handful of loyal fans 
from the scuzzy Jersey shore. Then two record albums of wired brilliance
 ("Greetings from Asbury Park. N.J." and "The Wild, the Innocent, and 
the E Street Shuffle") enlarged his audience to a cult. The albums had 
ecstatic reviews -- there was continuing and growing talk of "a new 
Dylan," -- but slim sales. Springsteen spent nearly two years working on
 his third album, "Born to Run," and Columbia Records has already 
invested $150,000 in ensuring that this time around, everyone gets the 
message. <br>
<br>
The album has made it to No. 1, the title track is a hit single, and 
even the first two albums are snugly on the charts. Concerts have sold 
out hours after they were announced. Last Thursday Springsteen brought 
his distinctively big-city, rubbed-raw sensibility to a skeptical Los 
Angeles, not only a major market but the bastion of a wholly different 
rock style. It remained to be seen how Springsteen would go down in a 
scene whose characteristic pop music is softer, easier, pitched to life 
on the beaches and in the canyons, hardly in tune with his sort of 
dead-end carnival. Springsteen's four-day stand at a Sunset Strip 
theater called the Roxy was a massive dose of culture shock that booted 
everyone back to the roots, shook 'em up good and got 'em all on their 
feet dancing. <br>
<br>
Even the most laid-back easy rocker would find it tough to resist his 
live performance. Small, tightly muscled, the voice a 
chopped-and-channeled rasp, Springsteen has the wild onstage energy of a
 pinball rebounding off invisible flippers, caroming down the alley past
 traps and penalties, dead center for extra points and the top score. <br>
<br>
Expecting a monochromatic street punk, the L.A. crowd got a dervish 
leaping on the tables, all arms and flailing dance steps, and a rock 
poet as well. In over ten years of playing tanktown dates and rundown 
discos, Springsteen has mastered the true stage secret of the rock pro: 
he seems to be letting go totally and fearlessly, yet the performance 
remains perfectly orchestrated. With his E Street Band, especially 
Clarence Clemons' smartly lowdown saxophone, Springsteen can caper and 
promenade, boogie out into the audience, recite a rambling, funny 
monologue about girl watching back in Asbury Park or switch moods in the
 middle of songs. <br>
<br>
He expects his musicians to follow him along. Many of the changes are 
totally spur of the moment, and the band is tight enough to take them in
 stride. "You hook on to Bruce on that stage and you go wherever he 
takes you," says Clarence Clemons. "It's like total surrender to him." A
 Springsteen set is raucous, poignant, brazen. It is clear that he gets 
off on the show as much as the audience, which is one reason why a 
typical gig lasts over two hours. The joy is infectious and 
self-fulfilling. "This music is forever for me," Springsteen says. "It's
 the stage thing, that rush moment that you live for. It never lasts, 
but that's what you live for." <br>
<br>
He once cautioned in a song that you can "waste your summer prayin' in 
vain for a savior to rise from these streets," but right now Springsteen
 represents a regeneration, a renewal of rock. He has gone back to the 
sources, rediscovered the wild excitement that rock has lost over the 
past few years. Things had settled down in the '70s: with a few 
exceptions, like Paul Simon, Jackson Browne and Linda Ronstadt, there 
was an excess of showmanship, too much din substituting for true power, 
repetition -- as in this past summer's Rolling Stones tour -- for lack 
of any new directions. Springsteen has taken rock forward by taking it 
back, keeping it young. He uses and embellishes the myths of the '50s 
pop culture: his songs are populated by bad-ass loners, wiped-out 
heroes, bikers, hot-rodders, women of soulful mystery. Springsteen 
conjures up a whole half-world of shattered sunlight and fractured neon,
 where his characters re-enact little pageants of challenge and 
desperation. <br>
<br>
The "Born to Run" album is so powerful, and Springsteen's presence so 
prevalent at the moment, that before the phenomenon has had a chance to 
settle, a reaction is already setting in. He is being typed as a '50s 
hood in the James Dean mold, defused for being a hype, put down as a 
product of the Columbia promo "fog machine," condemned for slicking up 
and recycling a few old rock-'n'-roll riffs. Even Springsteen remains 
healthily skeptical. "I don't understand what all the commotion is 
about," he told TIME Correspondent James Willwerth. "I feel like I'm on 
the outside of all this, even though I know I'm on the inside. It's like
 you want attention, but sometimes you can't relate to it." <br>
<br>
Springsteen defies classification. This is one reason recognition was so
 long in coming. There is nothing simple to hold on to. He was 
discovered by Columbia Records Vice President of Talent Acquisition John
 Hammond, who also found Billie Holiday, Benny Goodman and Bob Dylan, 
among others. Hammond knew "at once that Bruce would last a generation" 
but thought of him first as a folk musician. <br>
<br>
Casting Springsteen as a rebel in a motorcycle jacket is easy enough -- 
it makes a neat fit for the character he adopted in "Born to Run" -- but
 it ignores a whole other side of his importance and of his music. <br>
<br>
Born to Run is a bridge between Springsteen the raffish rocker and the 
more ragged, introverted street poet of the first two albums. Although 
he maintains that he "hit the right spot" on "Born to Run," it is the 
second album, "The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle," that 
seems to go deepest. A sort of free-association autobiography, it comes 
closest to the wild fun-house refractions of Springsteen's imagination. 
In "Wild Billy's Circus Song," when he sings, "He's gonna miss his fall,
 oh God save the human cannonball," Springsteen could be anticipating 
and describing his own current, perhaps perilous trajectory. In case of 
danger, however, Springsteen will be rescued by the music itself, just 
as he has always been. "Music saved me," he says. "From the beginning, 
my guitar was something I could go to. If I hadn't found music, I don't 
know what I would have done." <br>
<br>
He was born poor in Freehold, N.J., a working-class town near the shore.
 His mother Adele ("Just like Superwoman, she did everything, 
everywhere, all the time") worked through his childhood as a secretary. 
His father, Douglas Springsteen (the name is Dutch), was "a sure- money 
man" at the pool tables who drifted from job to job, stalked by 
undetermined demons. <br>
<br>
"My Daddy was a driver," Springsteen remembers. "He liked to get in the 
car and just drive. He got everybody else in the car too, and he made us
 drive. He made us all drive." These two- lane odysseys without 
destination only reinforced Springsteen's already flourishing sense of 
displacement. "I lived half of my first 13 years in a trance or 
something," he says now. "People thought I was weird because I always 
went around with this look on my face. I was thinking of things, but I 
was always on the outside, looking in." <br>
<br>
The parents pulled up stakes and moved to California when Bruce was 
still in his teens. Bruce stayed behind, with some bad memories of 
hassles with nuns in parochial school, an $18 guitar and random dreams 
of a phantom father for company. By the time he was 18, he had some 
perspective on his father. "I figured out we were pretty much alike," 
Springsteen says, by which he means more than a shared cool skill at the
 pool table and a taste for long car rides. "My father never has much to
 say to me, but I know he thinks about a lot of things. I know he's 
driving himself almost crazy thinking about these things... and yet he 
sure ain't got much to say when we sit down to talk." The elder 
Springsteen currently drives a bus in San Mateo, a suburb south of San 
Francisco. Neither he nor his wife made it to Los Angeles for their 
son's big show. <br>
<br>
Bruce bunked in with friends back in Jersey and tried to make it through
 public high school. He took off on weekend forays into Manhattan for 
his first strong taste of big-city street life and began making music. 
He started writing his own because he could not figure out how to tune 
his guitar to play anyone else's material accurately. "Music was my way 
of keeping people from looking through and around me. I wanted the 
heavies to know I was around." <br>
<br>
In 1965, while he was still finishing high school, Springsteen began 
forming bands like the Castiles, which did gigs for short money in a 
Greenwich Village spot called the Cafe Wha?. He met up with Miami Steve 
Van Zandt, current lead guitarist of the E Street Band, around that 
time. "We were all playing anything we could to be part of the scene," 
Van Zandt recalls. "West Coast stuff, the English thing, R&amp;B and 
blues. Bruce was writing five or ten songs a week. He would say, 'I'm 
gonna go home tonight and write a great song,' and he did. He was the 
Boss then, and he's the Boss now." <br>
<br>
Still, the Boss was sufficiently uncertain of his musical future to quit
 school altogether. He enrolled in Ocean County College. showed up in 
what is still his standard costume -- Fruit of the Loom undershirt, 
tight jeans, sneakers and leather jacket -- and was soon invited round 
for a chat by one of the guidance staff. As Springsteen tells it. the 
counselor dropped the big question on him immediately. <br>
<br>
"You've got trouble at home, right?" <br>
<br>
"Look, things are great, I feel fine," Springsteen replied warily. <br>
<br>
"Then why do you look like that?" <br>
<br>
"What are you talking about?" <br>
<br>
"There are some students who have... complained about you." <br>
<br>
"Well, that's their problem, you know?" said Springsteen, ending the conversation and his formal education. <br>
<br>
Instead, he took his music anywhere they would listen. His bands changed
 names (the Rogues, the Steel Mill, Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom) as 
frequently as personnel. "I've gone through a million crazy bands with 
crazy people who did crazy things." Springsteen remembers. They played 
not only clubs and private parties but firemen's balls, a state mental 
hospital and Sing Sing prison, a couple of trailer parks, a rollerdrome,
 the parking lot of a Shop-Rite and under the screen during intermission
 at a drive-in. A favorite spot for making music. and for hanging out, 
was Asbury Park. <br>
<br>
"Those were wonderful days," says Springsteen's buddy, Southside Johnny 
Lyon. "We were all young and crazy." Bustling with music and the fever 
of young musicians, bands swapping songs and members, new jobs and old 
girls, Asbury Park sounds, if only in memory, like Liverpool before it 
brought forth the Beatles. Springsteen lived in a surfboard factory run 
by a displaced Californian named Carl Virgil ("Tinker") West III, who 
became, for a time, his manager. <br>
<br>
Everybody had a band; not only Springsteen and Southside, but also Miami
 Steve, Vini ("Mad Dog") Lopez (who played drums on Bruce's first two 
albums) and Garry Tallent (now bass guitarist for the E Street Band). 
They all would appear at a dive called the Upstage Club for $15 a night,
 work from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m., then party together, play records and 
adjourn till the next afternoon, when they would meet on the boardwalk 
to check the action and talk music. For sport everyone played Monopoly, 
adding a few refinements that made the game more like the Jersey 
boardwalk they knew. There were two special cards: a Chief McCarthy card
 (named in honor of a local cop who rousted musicians indiscriminately) 
and a Riot card. The McCarthy card allowed the bearer to send any 
opponent to jail without reason; whoever drew the Riot card could 
fire-bomb any opponent's real estate. <br>
<br>
Springsteen was a demon player and won frequently, according to 
Southside, because "he had no scruples." Nicknamed "the Gut Bomb King" 
because of his passion for junk food, he would show up for a Monopoly 
tourney with armfuls of Pepsis and Drake's cakes. Whenever anyone would 
get hungry and ask for a snack, Springsteen was ready with a deal: one 
Pepsi, one hotel. <br>
<br>
Nobody was getting rich outside of Monopoly. In 1970 Asbury Park was the
 scene of a bad race riot. and the tourists stayed away. "The place went
 down to the ground. and we rode right down with it," says Miami Steve. 
There were jobs to be had in a few of the bars, playing easy- listening 
rock, but Springsteen and his pals disdained them because, as he says 
simply, "we hated the music. We had no idea how to hustle either. We 
weren't big door knockers. so we didn't go to New York or Philly." Adds 
Van Zandt, who lived on a dollar a day: "We were all reading in the 
papers how much fun rock 'n' roll was -- it seemed like another world. 
We didn't take drugs. We couldn't afford any bad habits." <br>
<br>
A lot of the life Springsteen saw then and lived through found its way 
into his songs, but indirectly. Filtered through an imagination that 
discovered a crazy romanticism in the ragtag boardwalk life. <br>
<br>
She worked that joint under the boardwalk, She was always the girl you 
saw boppin' down the beach with the radio, Kids say last night she was 
dressed like a star in one of the cheap little seashore bars and I saw 
her parked with her loverboy out on the Kokomo. <br>
<br>
Tinker, the surfboard manufacturer and manager, called Mike Appel on 
Springsteen's behalf. Appel, whose major claim to fame until then was 
the co-authorship of a Partridge Family hit called "Doesn't Somebody 
Want to Be Wanted," was smart enough to see Springsteen's talent and 
brash enough to spirit him away from Tinker. Appel got Springsteen to 
work up a clutch of new songs by simply calling him frequently and 
asking him to come into New York. Springsteen would jump on the bus and 
have a new tune ready by the time he crossed the Hudson. <br>
<br>
Appel also called John Hammond at Columbia. The call was Springsteen's 
idea, but the come- on was all Appel. He told Hammond he wanted him to 
listen to his new boy because Hammond had discovered Bob Dylan, and "we 
wanna see if that was just a fluke, or if you really have ears." Hammond
 reacted to Springsteen "with a force I'd felt maybe three times in my 
life." Less than 24 hours after the first meeting, contracts were 
signed. <br>
<br>
Even before Springsteen's first album was released in 1973, Appel was 
already on the move. He offered the NBC producer of the Super Bowl the 
services of his client to sing The Star- Spangled Banner. Informed that 
Andy Williams had already been recruited, with Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears 
to perform during half time, he cried, "They're losers and you're a 
loser too. Some day I'm going to give you a call and remind you of this.
 then I'm going to make another call and you'll be out of a job." Says 
Hammond: "Appel is as offensive as any man I've ever met, but he's 
utterly selfless in his devotion to Bruce." <br>
<br>
Appel and Springsteen understood each other. They agreed that Bruce and 
the band should play second fiddle to nobody. After a quick but 
disastrous experience as an opening act for Chicago, Springsteen 
appeared only as a headline attraction. That meant fewer bookings. There
 was also little to be done about the narrowing future of Bruce's 
recording career. Regarded as a pet of banished Columbia Records 
President Clive Davis, Springsteen was ignored by the executives who 
took over from Davis. "The Wild, the Innocent, &amp; the E Street 
Shuffle" was not so much distributed as dumped. <br>
<br>
For two years Springsteen crisscrossed the country, enlarging his 
following with galvanic concerts. Early last year, playing a small bar 
called Charley's in Cambridge, Mass., he picked up an important new fan.
 Jon Landau. a Rolling Stone editor, had reviewed Bruce's second album 
favorably for a local paper, and Charley's put the notice in the window.
 Landau remembers arriving at the club and seeing Springsteen hugging 
himself in the cold and reading the review. A few weeks later, Landau 
wrote, "I saw the rock and roll future and its name is Springsteen." <br>
<br>
Some loyalists at Columbia persuaded the company to cough up $50,000 to 
publicize the quote. Columbia's sudden recommitment caught Springsteen 
in a creative crisis. He and Appel had spent nine months in the studio 
and produced only one cut, "Born to Run." The disparity between the wild
 reaction to his live performances and the more subdued, respectful 
reception of his records had to be cleared up. Landau soon signed on as 
co-producer of the new album and began to find out about some of the 
problems firsthand. <br>
<br>
"Bruce works instinctively," Landau observes. "He is incredibly intense,
 and he concentrates deeply. Underneath his shyness is the strongest 
will I've ever encountered. If there's something he doesn't want to do, 
he won't." Springsteen would work most days from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.. and 
sometimes as long as 24 hours, without stopping. Only occasionally did 
things go quickly. For a smoky midnight song, called Meeting Across the 
River, Springsteen just announced, "O.K., I hear a string bass, and I 
hear a trumpet." and, according to Landau, "that was it." Finally the 
album came together as real roadhouse rock, made proudly in that 
tradition. The sound is layered over with the kind of driving 
instrumental cushioning that characterized the sides Phil Spector 
produced in the late '50s and '60s. The lyrics burst with nighthawk 
poetry. <br>
<br>
The screen door slams Mary's dress waves Like a vision she dances across
 the porch As the radio plays Roy Orbison singing for the lonely Hey 
that's me and I want you only Don't turn me home again I just can't face
 myself alone again. <br>
<br>
If all this effort has suddenly paid off grandly, and madly, Springsteen
 remains obdurately unchanged. He continues to hassle with Appel over 
playing large halls, and just last month refused to show up for a 
Maryland concert Appel had booked into a 10,000-seat auditorium. The 
money is starting to flow in now: Springsteen takes home $350 a week, 
the same as Appel and the band members. There are years of debt and back
 road fees to repay. Besides, Springsteen is not greatly concerned about
 matters of finance. Says John Hammond: "In all my years in this 
business, he is the only person I've met who cares absolutely nothing 
about money." <br>
<br>
Springsteen lives sometimes with his girl friend Karen Darvin, 20, a 
freckled, leggy model from Texas, in a small apartment on Manhattan's 
East Side. More frequently he is down on the Jersey shore, where he has 
just moved into more comfortable -- but not lavish -- quarters, and 
bought his first decent hi-fi rig. He remains adamantly indifferent to 
clothing and personal adornment, although he wears a small gold cross 
around his neck -- a vestigial remnant of Catholicism -- and, probably 
to challenge it, a small gold ring in his left ear, which gives him a 
little gypsy flash. <br>
<br>
When he is not working, Springsteen takes life easy and does not worry 
about it. "I'm not a planning-type guy," he says. "You can't count on 
nothing in this life. I never have expectations when I get involved in 
things. That way, I never have disappointments." His songs, which he 
characterizes as being mostly about "survival, how to make it through 
the next day," are written in bursts. "I ain't one of those guys who 
feels guilty if he didn't write something today," he boasts. "That's all
 jive. If I didn't do nothing all day, I feel great." Under all 
circumstances, he spins fiction in his lyrics and is careful to avoid 
writing directly about daily experience. "You do that," he cautions, 
"and this is what happens. First you write about struggling along. Then 
you write about making it professionally. Then somebody's nice to you. 
You write about that. It's a beautiful day, you write about that. That's
 about 20 songs in all. Then you're out. You got nothing to write." <br>
<br>
Some things, however, must change. Southside Johnny recalls that after 
"Born to Run" was released, "we had a party at one of the band members' 
houses. It was like old times. We drank and listened to old Sam and Dave
 albums. Then someone said my car had a flat tire. I went outside to 
check, and sitting in the street were all these people waiting to get a 
glimpse of Brucie, just sitting under the streetlights, not saying 
anything. I got nervous and went back inside." <br>
