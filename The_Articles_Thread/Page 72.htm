Bruce Springsteen, ‘The Ties That Bind: The River Collection': Album Review<br>
By Michael Gallucci<br>
<br>
 December 2, 2015 10:47 AM<br>
<br>
Columbia Records</strong><br>
<br>
Back in 1979, Bruce Springsteen was all set to release the follow-up to 
the previous year’s Darkness on the Edge of Town. After legal problems 
made the wait between that album and its predecessor, the breakthrough 
Born to Run, a long three years – an eternity in the ’70s – Springsteen 
was more than ready to get back into the studio.<br>
He had written and recorded hundreds of songs for Darkness and its 
follow-up, which was going to be called The Ties That Bind. The 
single-record project, like the album before it, took on a somber tone, 
as Springsteen, approaching his 30s, explored grown-up themes like 
marriage and responsibility. But something happened on the way to the 
album’s release. Springsteen pulled the record and decided to revisit 
the project with more upbeat songs, and ended up with the double-LP epic
 The River in 1980 instead.<br>
The Ties That Bind: The River Collection — a box set that gathers 52 
songs from the sessions on four CDs, as well as three DVDs of video 
content from the era — tells the story of how one of music’s most 
determined artists scrapped a great album and replaced it with an even 
better one. Lengthening the 10-song The Ties That Bind made the 
double-LP The River a more expansive record, and not just in physical 
size. By broadening his scope, Springsteen guaranteed The River wouldn’t
 be just Darkness on the Edge of Town Part II.<br>
The original Ties That Bind — collected here in its entirety and made up
 of some songs that ended up on The River, some that didn’t and some 
that did in different versions — scales back the breadth of the 
two-record edition, tightening some of the loose ends and in some ways 
laying a more solid foundation for the songs. But The River works better
 as narrative and as the next step in Springsteen’s evolution as one of 
rock’s most powerful songwriters.<br>
For further proof as to just how prolific and consistent he was during 
this period, check out the 22 outtakes from the album’s sessions. 
Several ended up as B-sides, bonus tracks and songs on 1998’s 
odds-and-ends box set Tracks, but they take on new perspective in this 
light, not only revealing that Springsteen had enough material for a 
four-LP set but also how differently The River might have sounded with 
some alterations.<br>
Like 2010’s The Promise, which gathered a ton of Darkness on the Edge of
 Town leftovers, The Ties That Bind: The River Collection is more 
rewarding if you’re familiar with the original material. Songs like 
“Meet Me in the City,” “Roulette,” “Where the Bands Are,” “Living on the
 Edge of the World” and “Held Up Without a Gun” are great songs that fit
 into The River‘s concept, but what would they replace? It’s tough to 
say.<br>
In the end, The River was the album Springsteen needed to make at that 
time. Not The Ties That Bind or any other record filled with the session
 songs found on this box. But the set uncovers an alternate history that
 bridges Springsteen’s first (his most significant) and second (his most
 commercially successful) decades. Would it have steered him away from 
Nebraska and in turn the superstar-making behemoth Born in the U.S.A.? 
Probably not, but this mammoth, exhaustive and terrific collection 
explores the possibilities</div>

Dusting ‘Em Off: Bruce Springsteen – Nebraska<br>
<br>
BY HHAUSERON <br>
JULY 20, 2013,<br>
</strong><br>
In  this week’s edition of Dusting ‘Em Off, staff writers Henry Hauser 
and Bryant Kitching revisit Bruce Springsteen’s dark and intimate 1982 
sixth album, Nebraska. The two discuss its role in Springsteen’s 
disocgraphy, the stories behind the songs, the production style, and 
whether or not the New Jersey hero let go of hope.<br>
<br>
Bryant Kitching (BK): By 1982, Bruce Springsteen was wholly free from 
the heavy legal shackles that had plagued him for the better part of the
 last decade. For the first time in his career, he could do whatever the
 hell he wanted, and his label or lawyers couldn’t say a damn thing. 
What does The Boss do with that freedom? Inspired by Charles 
Starkweather’s 1957-58 killing spree, he churned out Nebraska, one of 
the darkest, most macabre, utterly heart-wrenching albums of all time. 
Sandwiched between two stadium-sized rock monoliths, The River (1980) 
and Born in the USA (1984), that’s what we in the business like to call 
punk as fuck. It’s why it has always been my favorite Springsteen album 
and an album worth revisiting.<br>
<br>
I think back to the photo of Bruce on the inside sleeve. It’s a fuzzy, 
distant shot that looks like the photographer snuck up on him while he 
was creeping around his abandoned childhood home in Freehold, NJ. It 
couldn’t be further from the smiling boardwalk goofball on the Born To 
Run cover, or the take-no-prisoners tough guy from The River. Nebraska 
oozes mystery and chaos while buckling your knees and wetting your eyes.<br>
<br>
Henry Hauser (HH): It’s absolutely true that Nebraska stands in stark 
contrast to Bruce’s earlier work. Nebraska leaves behind the youthful 
exuberance of Greetings from Asbury Park, the bustling friskiness of The
 Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle, and that delirious high of
 ditching “a town full of losers” anchoring Born To Run. What’s left is a
 requiem – a Mourner’s Kaddish for all those wretched souls too timid, 
too dumb, or shackled with just too much rotten luck to make it out of 
the “dead man’s town” where they were born and bred.<br>
<br>
Nebraska finds Bruce’s rambunctious ragamuffin pals Sloppy Sue, Big 
Bones Billy, and Bad Scooter a decade down the line, still languishing 
in the suffocating towns from which they swore they’d escape. It’s about
 the folks that never glanced up at their rearview mirrors as their 
hometowns melted into the horizon. These are the ones that stayed behind
 or, worse yet, got left behind.<br>
<br>
Strictly speaking, these people are still alive. They go about their 
monotonous, mundane lives as best they can, picking up double shifts at 
Walmart, schlepping their dull-eyed kids to and from peewee football 
practice or trying in vain to make ends meet as a single parent amidst 
the crippling tandem of colossal unemployment and double-digit 
inflation. Deep down, though, something inside of them has died — their 
joie de vivre extinguished by the unfulfilled promises of youth and 
tedium of adult life. Their once deeply held creed — that a tank full of
 gas is all you need to score freedom — and the light of flashier, more 
glamorous, greener pastures has been debunked.<br>
<br>
Channeling this depressive, vacuous vibe by recording Nebraska on a 
four-track Portastudio 144, Springsteen chronicles the swelling divide 
between the haves and have-nots. On “Atlantic City”, he warns us that 
America, once the land of opportunity, has devolved into a land of 
“winners and losers/ and don’t get caught on the wrong side of that 
line.” Pleading for leniency and compassion, the homicidal protagonist 
of “Johnny 99” reminds us that sometimes economic necessity, not rotten 
morals, paves the road to savagery and violence. After “they closed down
 the auto plant in Mahwah” and the bank threatened to take Johnny’s 
house away, he found himself utterly without hope.<br>
<br>
Rather than asserting his innocence at trial, Johnny uses his last words
 conveying to Judge John Brown the realities of life in the 
socioeconomic gutter. Just like the blue-collar everyman in “Atlantic 
City”, Johnny, burdened with “debts no honest man could pay,” can’t 
reconcile the American dream with his living nightmare. In both songs, 
the protagonist searches (in vain) for relief outside the law, whether 
by doing a “little favor” for someone he met last night in “Atlantic 
City”, or “wavin’ his gun around and threatenin’ to blow his top” on 
“Johnny 99”.<br>
<br>
You mention that Nebraska follows comparatively effusive 1980 offering 
The River. Does all this mourning over the squandered freedom and rust 
belt suffocation come out of left field, or does Springsteen tip his 
hand a bit on Nebraska’s predecessor?<br>
<br>
BK: Yes, of course. Even as starkly as Nebraska stands out in the 
Springsteen cannon, it didn’t happen in a vacuum. It might seem hard to 
trace any of Nebraska’s quiet, murderous desperation back to the 
20-track opus The River, but it’s all there. The loneliness, the 
despondency, the idea as you put it, Henry, that sometimes you don’t 
make it out of the “dead man’s town.” Sometimes the gas tank runs dry.<br>
<br>
The main character from The River’s title track can’t find work, he 
can’t give his pregnant 19-year-old wife a proper wedding, and he has no
 real prospect of ever getting out from “down in the valley.” This is 
the same person we see again on “Atlantic City”, “Johnny 99”, or even on
 “State Trooper” or “Highway Patrolman”. There is a difference, though: 
on The River, they have the titular river to wash away their broken 
promises. The people we meet on Nebraska have nothing. Or, as the 
borderline-homicidal character from “State Trooper” puts it, “The only 
thing that I’ve got/ been bothering me my whole life.”<br>
<br>
Pre-Nebraska, Bruce offered glimpses into the depths of his darkest 
psyche, but there was almost always a ladder to help us climb out. Hell,
 “Hungry Heart” might just be the darkest song the guy has ever written,
 but lyrics about a man who gets fed up and leaves his family nearly 
lose their impact when paired with such bubbly instrumentation. Imagine 
that track recorded with just an acoustic guitar and Bruce’s shitty 
Portastudio, and you’ve got something that’d fit perfectly on Nebraska.<br>
<br>
You don’t have to be a Springsteen scholar to know that redemption and 
salvation are two of his most common themes. Redemption comes in the 
form of a car, a girl, a killer sax solo. He preaches salvation through a
 song, a river, or a sunny day at the shore. On Nebraska, even death 
can’t bring deliverance. Probably my favorite line on the whole record 
comes on the title track, when his fictionalized Starkweather character 
is sentenced to death. He tell us, “They declared me unfit to live/ said
 into that great void my soul be hurled.” (If there’s a better metaphor 
for death, I haven’t heard it.) This person isn’t even going to hell. 
His soul is doomed to drift about in this “great void” for all eternity.
 The worst part is, he doesn’t even care because at the end of it all, 
“I guess there’s just a meanness in this world.”<br>
<br>
One of the unsung moments on the album lies in the dry sarcasm 
Springsteen uses to tease us on closer “Reason To Believe”. Going by 
title alone, you think he’s about to leave us with a glimmer of hope, 
but he’s actually mocking us. There’s a man pulled over by the side of 
the road poking his dead dog with a stick, as if this will somehow 
revive his deceased canine. Instead of mourning or sympathizing, you can
 practically see Bruce roll his eyes when he sings, “At the end of every
 hard-earned day/ people find some reason to believe.”<br>
<br>
Okay, so we’ve established that the Springsteen on Nebraska was a 
totally different animal than anything anyone had seen before, so let’s 
dive into the tracks themselves a bit more. Henry, do you have a 
favorite?<br>
<br>
HH: I’ve always been a bit obsessed with the beautiful melancholy of 
“Reason To Believe”.  Rather than hearing snide sarcasm in Bruce’s 
downtrodden lyrics and gravelly vocals, I hear resilience, guts, and 
gumption.<br>
<br>
It’s true that the folks in “Reason To Believe” have it rough. There’s 
the man mourning over a mutilated dog carcass, the tragically abandoned 
sweetheart waiting “down at the end of that dirt road for young Johnny 
to come back,” and that pathetic bridegroom shuffling his feet all alone
 at the altar as “the sun sets behind a weepin’ willow tree.” Their 
lives are chock-full of pain, hardship, and disappointment. But despite 
absorbing some brutal blows, they aren’t broken. They haven’t given up, 
and they sure as hell aren’t about to lie down and die. They’re 
survivors, they’ve found something to hold on to, something to get them 
through their 9-5 grinds with a few scraps of dignity and hope intact. 
Whether it’s God, six-packs of Bud, or a triumphantly cathartic Bruce 
Springsteen concert, these people have found something on which to graft
 their battered self-esteems and gutted personalities.<br>
<br>
The precise form in which this “something” presents itself doesn’t 
really matter; what’s significant is that these rust belt everymen have 
found “some reason to believe” that maybe things aren’t so bad, that 
their fortunes actually could be on the upswing, or that by the time 
they’re six feet under, their communities will recall them with respect 
and admiration. Here even death has a silver lining, as Springsteen 
deftly alludes to the cyclicality of life by juxtaposing the passing of 
an old man “in a whitewash shotgun shack” with the baptism of baby Kyle 
Williams.<br>
<br>
<br>
Set to a wispy harmonica and sparse acoustic guitar, Springsteen 
presents a phantasmagoria of disappointment and decay. Leading into each
 chorus with a fleeting glimpse of some wretched schmuck shunned by a 
disloyal lover or perturbed by the stark finality of death, we find the 
song’s protagonists on the precipice of surrender and despair. But just 
when all appears lost, faint rays of sunshine pierce through the clouds,
 drawing them back from the edge.  Moaning and groaning, Springsteen 
sings of this puzzling phenomenon. “At the end of every hard-earned day/
 people find some reason to believe.”<br>
<br>
Strongly emphasizing the phrase “hard-earned day” with his rasping vocal
 to highlight the interminable burden these people bear, Springsteen 
whispers the song’s titular lyric as the chorus segues seamlessly into a
 fresh portrait of heartache and sorrow. Sure, this “reason to believe” 
may be nothing more than an echo or a shadow, but at least it’s 
something. And in a world sharply divided between haves and have-nots, 
something is a whole a lot better than nothing.<br>
<br>
So, Bryant, am I right to presume that you’re partial to the album’s title track?<br>
<br>
BK: “Nebraska” is a monster, no doubt. But the one that has always 
resonated most with me is “State Trooper”. It’s just a bare-bones guitar
 line and Springsteen’s hollow vocals that sound both distant and like 
he’s whispering right into your ear. It’s a not-so-subtle nod to 
Suicide, who Springsteen was a big fan of during this period. He even 
famously said, “If Elvis came back from the dead, I think he would sound
 like [Suicide frontman] Alan Vega.”<br>
<br>
Suicide’s 10-minute electronic murder ballad “Frankie Teardrop” deeply 
affected Springsteen, and it didn’t take him long to release a track 
brimming with just as much desperation and pent-up rage. The man he 
introduces us to is a loose cannon in every sense of the term. Driving 
on the Jersey turnpike in the dead of night, he tells us, “License, 
registration, I ain’t got none/ but I got a clear conscience about the 
things that I’ve done.” It’s an utterly terrifying experience for the 
listener, as their imagination starts running wild. How many people has 
he already killed? Where is he going? How long before he kills again? 
Even after hundreds of listens, it never fails to make my palms sweat 
and plant a knot deep in my stomach. It’s an amazing feat of 
craftsmanship that he’s able to elicit that kind of response with the 
limited toolbox he was working with.<br>
<br>
The line “Hi ho Silver-o, deliver me from nowhere” encapsulates the 
entire album perfectly. Here is someone who is so dead inside that even 
God has given up on him. There’s no hope left, so he’s going to sit back
 and watch the world burn. That, to me, is what Nebraska is all about. 
It’s also why the album isn’t widely appreciated outside of Springsteen 
diehards. His storytelling had never been stronger, but these weren’t 
necessarily tales people were comfortable hearing, let alone playing at 
family BBQs or karaoke bars.<br>
<br>
HH: While I agree that Nebraska paints a dark and dire picture, I just 
can’t believe that Bruce and his buddies have lost all hope. Take “Open 
All Night”, the only Nebraska song to feature an electric guitar. Though
 lacking the alluring and naughty thrill of escape heard in fellow 
nocturnal automotive ditties “Spirit in the Night” and “Thunder Road” 
(“Show a little faith/ there’s magic in the night”), the track 
poignantly champions the restorative tandem of rock music and the open 
highway.<br>
<br>
Though the New Jersey turnpike’s “lunar landscape” may be “spooky at 
night when you’re all alone,” our protagonist swallows his fear, fuels 
up, and braves the long, winding road separating him from his Wanda. As 
the singer fights off physical exhaustion and emotional demons, the song
 ends with the promise of a new day (“sun’s just a red ball risin’ over 
them refinery towers”) and an appeal to that great haloed DJ in the sky 
(“hear my last prayer/ hey ho rock n’ roll deliver me from nowhere”). As
 long as he’s got a car and an FM radio, anything (even deliverance and 
redemption) is within reach.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s music bristles with the tension between the collective and
 the individual. There is a burning passion to escape, to strike out on 
one’s own, but a concurrent awareness of the need to connect and 
ultimately return to a larger community. Albums like Greetings from 
Asbury Park and Born To Run reveal the need to establish a unique 
personality through rebellion and escape and then reconcile that 
identity with community so as to alleviate the pain of alienation. 
Nebraska shows us that failure to balance these needs begets the intense
 heartbreak of sorrow and regret. Thankfully, it’s never fully hopeless.
 There’s always something to latch onto like a lifeboat amidst icy 
waters: a spouse, a rusty old Ford, or, as Springsteen boisterously and 
garishly channels on 1984’s Born in the USA, bright and blinding 
patriotism.<br>
<br>
Still think there’s no hope, Bryant?<br>
<br>
BK: Henry, you almost have me convinced. Almost. Listening to “Open All 
Night” as I write this now, I can hear the same guy who once begged 
Rosie to come out tonight. He’s buried deep, and probably has a body or 
two stuffed in his trunk, but he’s just as earnest about getting back to
 his baby. I still think it’s impossible to tease any inkling of hope 
out of songs like “Nebraska” or “State Trooper”, but there are times on 
the album I suppose a silver lining does peek its head through the 
darkness and pain.<br>
<br>
Perhaps that’s what makes Nebraska Springsteen’s most rewarding album. 
Tom Morello is quoted as saying, “I didn’t know there was music like 
that, that was as impactful and as heavy as Nebraska was. The alienation
 that I felt was for the first time expressed in music.” The key word 
there is impactful. Springsteen’s more commercial work is certainly 
impactful, but in the way of your first kiss or a mother’s hug. Nebraska
 is more akin to your first fistfight. Each experience packs one hell of
 a wallop, emotionally and developmentally, but there are few things 
that teach you more about yourself than getting an ass whooping. The 
road may be paved with broken hearts and buried bodies, but the payoff 
is magnificent.</div>

How One Amazing Night Led to Bruce Springsteen’s Nebraska<br>
January 3, 2016<br>
Dave Lifton<br>
Ultimate Classic Rock</strong><br>
<br>
Following the massive success of 1980’s double album The River, many 
expected Bruce Springsteen to follow up his first No. 1 album with 
another set of radio-friendly rock songs. Instead, the songwriter 
released Nebraska, a stark acoustic record that was mostly recorded in 
one session, on Jan. 3, 1982.<br>
<br>
Ironically, the recording of Nebraska began as an exercise in then-new 
technology. For years, Springsteen had recorded demos into a boom box. 
But he decided to invest in a Teac Tascam 144 four-track cassette 
recorder so that he could add an extra guitar or percussion to give the E
 Street Band a better idea of what he wanted.<br>
<br>
Mike Batlan, his then-guitar tech, set up the portable studio in 
Springsteen’s bedroom in Colts Neck, N.J. on the morning of Jan. 3 and 
went to work. In a marathon session that took them deep into the night, 
Springsteen recorded guitar-and-vocal tracks for 15 songs, with overdubs
 on a few. Two others, “My Father’s House” and “The Big Payback,” were 
recorded a few months later.<br>
<br>
But when the band tried to record Spingsteen’s new material, only four 
of the songs – “Born in the U.S.A.,” “Pink Cadillac,” “Downbound Train” 
and “Child Bride,” which was later rewritten as “Working on the Highway”
 – translated to a full-band arrangement. Three of those wound up on 
Born in the U.S.A. two years later, while “Pink Cadillac” was the b-side
 of “Dancing in the Dark.”<br>
<br>
The problem was that the songs continued the dark themes found on the 
second disc of The River, like “Stolen Car” and “Wreck on the Highway.” 
While the songs weren’t necessarily autobiographical, the demons 
haunting the characters reflected Springsteen’s own desperation and 
isolation – even as he was becoming a big star – that stemmed largely 
from his troubled relationship with his father. The characters were lost
 and adrift, and the raw, ghostly sound of the demos worked better than 
the E Street Band’s bar-band rock.<br>
<br>
Five of the songs – “Atlantic City,” “Highway Patrolman,” “Johnny 99,” 
“State Trooper” and the title track – deal with characters who have 
turned to a life of crime. It didn’t make sense to put a heavy back beat
 to, say, “My Father’s House,” or a soul-inflected Clarence Clemons sax 
solo on “Used Cars.” Springsteen’s harmonica did the trick.<br>
<br>
Unable to get the sound he wanted from the band, Springsteen asked 
engineer Toby Scott if there was any way to put out the cassette of the 
demos. Scott was able to do his magic, and Nebraska was released, to 
minimal hype, on Sept. 30, 1982.<br>
<br>
To this day, the “Electric Nebraska” sessions, outside of those four 
songs, have not been released either officially or on bootleg. But 
Springsteen has since figured out how to rock out on half of the 
Nebraska material. “Atlantic City,” “Mansion on the Hill,” “Johnny 99,” 
“Open All Night” and “Reason to Believe” have all been somewhat 
regularly performed by the full band on various tours.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Springsteen has revisited this period’s stripped-down 
approach on two other albums; 1995’s The Ghost of Tom Joad, and Devils 
&amp; Dust from a decade later. Neither of them, however, have the 
consistency and power of what was recorded in a New Jersey bedroom on 
that January day in 1982.</div>

Bruce Springsteen’s 10 Greatest Concerts<br>
<br>
The cream of the crop, the be-all and end-all of The Boss' live music supremacy <br>
<br>
By Corbin Reiff - January 15, 2016</strong><br>
<br>
To try and describe a live Bruce Springsteen performance with the 
woefully inadequate word “concert” is absolutely foolish. Throughout the
 years, many a writer has tried and failed to put into broader language 
what takes place at these sometimes two, sometimes three, and sometimes 
even four-hour revues, and only a very select few have succeeded. Jon 
Landau, the venerated ‘70s rock critic and Springsteen’s present-day 
manager, came perhaps the closest when he wrote after a 1974 gig in 
Boston, “I saw rock and roll future, and its name is Bruce Springsteen.”
 That night, Springsteen made Landau feel the way he would make so many 
millions more feel in the years and shows that followed. “On a night 
when I needed to feel young, he made me feel like I was hearing music 
for the very first time.”<br>
<br>
Fortunately for all of us, Springsteen is one of the most bootlegged 
musical acts of all time, and there’s hardly a note that he’s played 
live over the past five decades that hasn’t been somehow captured and is
 presently swimming out there in the vast emptiness of digital space 
waiting to be played. Nobody bats 1.000 of course, and there’s a vast 
number of gigs available that are either plainly unremarkable or, in 
some cases, just downright bad. But then there are also those select 
few, maybe 50, maybe even as low as 20 that are truly otherworldly. For 
our purposes, here are the absolute 10 best of those select gigs. They 
are the cream of the crop, the be-all and end-all of Springsteen’s live 
music supremacy.<br>
<br>
No 10- London - October 18, 1975<br>
<br>
For years, decades even, this show got a bad rap mostly due to 
Springsteen’s own negative reaction at the time to the built-up 
publicity campaign surrounding his English debut. Legend has it that the
 singer went on a tear, physically ripping down posters around town that
 declared, “Finally London is ready for Bruce Springsteen and The E 
Street Band.” As it turns out, however, the recordings of this November 
evening reveal a tremendous performance from Bruce and the band that 
begins with a chilling, near a cappella rendition of the just released 
“Thunder Road” as well as amazing performances of “Kitty’s Back” and 
“Spirit in the Night”, the latter of which finds Springsteen crawling 
completely offstage and losing his famously oversize beanie in the 
process. While the official album, mastered by Bob Clearmountain, sounds
 fantastic, do yourself a favor and check out the DVD assembled by Thom 
Zimny to really get a sense of how on it Springsteen and the E Street 
band were at the time, despite what they considered to be a 
less-than-perfect performance.<br>
<br>
No 9- The Agora Ballroom, Cleveland-  August 9,  1978<br>
<br>
While some might contend that his outings supporting either The River in
 1980-81 or perhaps Born in the U.S.A. in 1984-85 eclipse the 115 dates 
that he put together behind Darkness on the Edge of Town, most agree 
that Springsteen and the E Street Band were never better live than they 
were in 1978. In fact, a case could be made that this entire list should
 comprise of shows taken from that single year alone. This stop in 
Cleveland isn’t the best show from that vaunted run, but the band’s 
performance at the modest Agora Ballroom is certainly transcendent 
enough to merit inclusion here. Clarence Clemons, in particular, gives 
it his all with a truly incendiary sax performance on “Jungleland” and 
the cheeky inclusion of a snippet of the Village People’s “Macho Man” on
 “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)”.<br>
<br>
No 8- MSG - July 1, 2000<br>
<br>
Following an 11-year absence, Springsteen’s highly anticipated reunion 
with the E Street Band culminated in the legendary halls of New York 
City’s Madison Square Garden — and damn was it a doozy! By this point, 
the group had played nine other shows in the Knicks’ home stadium and 
had performed all across the world over the past 14 months. They had 
become a well-oiled machine by this point, and every member was intent 
on putting together something special across all three and a half hours 
they were onstage for this final curtain call. Springsteen was 
particularly caught up in the emotions of it all, choking up some after 
playing final number “Blood Brothers”. You might want to keep a Kleenex 
nearby yourself while listening to this one.<br>
<br>
No 7 - The Roxy - July 7, 1978<br>
<br>
This gig at the intimate Roxy Theater off Hollywood’s Sunset Strip 
sounds like the wildest party you’ve ever attended. The streets 
literally overflowed with zealous fans hoping to get in on the 
experience, even if it was through the muffled sound of the front door 
opening and closing. To make things even more special, Springsteen also 
decided to give three classics their live debut that evening: 
“Independence Day”, “Rave On”, and “Point Blank”. The entire madness was
 captured and broadcast over the radio on KMET and has become a bootleg 
staple for decades since.<br>
<br>
6- The Meadowlands - August 20, 1984<br>
<br>
There’s a feeling in the air here that’s impossible to shake even three 
decades later: The prodigal son returned home. By 1984, Springsteen was 
riding high on the smash success of Born in the U.S.A. and was no longer
 strictly New Jersey’s own. The Boss was a global superstar, on par with
 the King of Pop himself, Michael Jackson. Nevertheless, while those 
around him began to see view him in a decidedly different light and 
newer audiences required bigger venues and multi-night stands, 
Springsteen was more or less the same performer. There were a few 
personnel changes, specifically the exit of “Miami” Steve Van Zandt 
(although, he made an appearance at this show for one night only) and 
the introduction of Grin guitarist Nils Lofgren and Springsteen’s future
 wife Patti Scialfa, but that played into the expansive reach of this 
tour. Everything was “big,” from the Miami Horns to the backup vocals to
 the triple-guitar attack, down to Springsteen’s own glistening biceps.<br>
<br>
5- LA - August 29, 1981<br>
<br>
It might not be the best performance of Springsteen’s career, but this 
show at the Memorial Sports Arena in Los Angeles certainly qualifies as 
perhaps his most emotionally charged. Billed as “A Night for Vietnam 
Veterans”, the show begins with a poignant introduction from disabled 
vet Bob Muller, who also helped organize the entire thing. Springsteen 
then comes out to make a short, heartfelt speech of his own before he 
and the band launch into an extraordinary cover of Creedence Clearwater 
Revival’s “Who’ll Stop the Rain”. Eventually, the entire affair turns 
into another one of Springsteen’s signature marathons, where he 
seemingly exhausts his entire catalog of songs, and then some, all for a
 tremendously worthy cause.<br>
__________________________________________________________<br>
<br>
4- Winterland - December 15, 1978<br>
<br>
The Winterland Ballroom was concert-promoting icon Bill Graham’s final 
bastion of live, indoor entertainment in the City by the Bay. By 1978, 
the 5,400-capacity converted roller rink had hosted nearly everyone who 
was anyone in rock music, from The Band to Van Morrision, the Sex 
Pistols to Led Zeppelin. Two weeks before it was set to close its doors,
 with a big blowout hosted by the Grateful Dead, Springsteen and the E 
Street Band rolled into town. From the beginning with “Badlands”, it’s 
clear that the group is white hot and feeling confident, but to open up 
the second half of the show with the unreleased song “The Ties That 
Bind” is absolutely next-level stuff.<br>
<br>
3- The Main Point, Bryn Mawr - February 2, 1975<br>
<br>
Imagine yourself as one of the 300 or so fortunate souls crowded into 
this small coffee house outside of Philadelphia to see Bruce Springsteen
 in the early months of 1975. You have your copies of Greetings from 
Asbury Park and The Wild, The Innocent &amp; The E Street Shuffle 
sitting on the record player at home, but you’ve heard he might play 
some new material tonight. Picture yourself hearing “Born to Run” or 
“Thunder Road”, when it was still being called “Wings for Wheels”, for 
the very first time in that kind of setting. This actually happened, and
 it was a magical moment for all those there and for the timely 
thousands at home or in their cars who tuned in a few hours later to 
hear it being broadcast over the radio. Fortunately, more than a few 
people pressed record on their stereo at the time, and we can still put 
ourselves in that moment today.<br>
<br>
2- Nassau Coliseum - December 29, 1980<br>
<br>
In 1980, The Boss and the band made the comparatively short drive up 
I-95 from New Jersey to Long Island to help the native New Yorkers ring 
in the New Year with a bang. Clocking in at nearly four hours long, this
 gig stood as the longest continuous performance of Springsteen’s career
 for over 30 years; that is, until he finally shattered that mark in 
2012. However, it’s not just the sheer length that makes the gig 
special; there was clearly a festive energy at hand, and the entire show
 was both loose and exciting. Even as the clock strikes midnight and 
Clarence Clemons hits the audience with a rendition of “Auld Lang Syne”,
 the party has only really just begun, thanks to a raucous 16-minute 
version of “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)” and another half-dozen songs, 
including a medley of Detroit hits to follow.<br>
__________________________________________________________<br>
<br>
1- Passaic - September 19, 1978<br>
<br>
The crown jewel and the undisputed heavyweight champion of Springsteen’s
 live shows took place 20 minutes outside of Newark, New Jersey, at 
Passaic’s rustic 1,800-capacity Capitol Theater. If the Darkness tour 
really was Springsteen’s greatest run of dates, then this gig was the 
moment where it all came together. Broadcast over WNEW Radio, this was 
the first show of a three-night stand, and the stunning recordings that 
have been passed down throughout the years make it clear that 
Springsteen and the E Street Band tore the roof off the joint.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s always managed to imbue a high degree of fire and 
brimstone into his songs, but the material here is red hot with arguably
 the greatest performances of “Racing in the Streets”, “Because the 
Night”, “Fire”, and “Thunder Road”. Despite those gasps of musical 
transcendence, the emotional high point of the entire affair arrived 
when “Professor” Roy Bittain’s 1978-only piano instrumental kicked off a
 volcanic rendition of “Prove It All Night”. Never before has 
Springsteen sounded as powerful or energized than he does in the 10 
minutes of that one song.</div>

January 16, 2016 <br>
By Scott Mervis <br>
 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen’s 1980 opus “The River” has some of his most beloved 
songs -- the title track, the pop hit “Hungry Heart,” the gorgeous 
"Drive All Night" -- and others that the Boss himself had all but 
discarded.<br>
<br>
As a fan tweeted this week, “It's pretty nuts that Springsteen launches a
 tour in two days where he's guaranteed to play ‘The Price You Pay’ 
&amp; ‘Crush On You’ 24 times.”<br>
<br>
That will be almost as many times as he’s trotted them in the last 35 
years, but when you embark on a full-album tour, as the mighty E Street 
Band did Saturday night at the sold-out Consol Energy Center, there are 
no shortcuts. What we got was a living, breathing classic with songs 
rarely played, especially here in this "Darkness on the Edge of Town” 
kind of town.<br>
<br>
After camping out for several days of rehearsal at Consol, they hit the 
stage at the stroke of 8 with a rocker he was crazy to cast aside -- 
rousing "River" outtake "Meet Me in the City."<br>
<br>
"We're gonna take you to 'The River'!" he said, interrupting the song. "I wanna know: Are you ready to be transformed?!"<br>
<br>
You know the answer.<br>
<br>
"This was the record where I was trying to find out where I fit in...," 
he said of the album, which has only been performed once live (2009, 
Madison Square Garden). "I wanted to make a record that was big enough 
that it felt like LIFE, or like an E Street Band show."<br>
<br>
He couldn't be any more right about that...<br>
<br>
They dropped the needle with the jubilant opener “The Ties That Bind,” a
 tone-setter for the album’s theme of finding what's real and planting 
down roots. From there, “The River” ebbed and flowed from wild 
rollicking, '60s-style frat rock to minor key ballads, reflecting the 
joys and struggles we all go through.<br>
<br>
We can at least hope that everyone, at some point in their lives, has as
 much fun as the rowdies in “Sherry Darling" (the Boss dancing with his 
wife Patti Scialfa in that one), feels the passion of "Two Hearts," 
carries the swagger of the guy in “Out in the Street” or has the kind of
 meaningful family interaction described in “Independence Day.”<br>
<br>
The late-night conversation between father and son, sung on the darkened
 stage, was a beauty, that quickly gave way to the crowd belting out the
 opening of "Hungry Heart" and Bruce walking right into the heart of it.
 He got back to the stage by breaking the long distance crowd-surfing 
record for a 66-year-old.<br>
<br>
"Crush on You," which he has admitted might have been a better outtake, 
was still a loud, unruly blast, complete with a pretty funny dance. "I 
Wanna Marry You," introduced as a song that's "not about the real 
thing," had an extended boardwalk doo-wop intro with guitarist and best 
man Steve Van Zandt. The title track, with the haunting harmonica cry, 
followed as the somber dose of reality, punctuated with a sad falsetto 
wail.<br>
<br>
He took us down even lower into the abyss with "Point Blank," before 
flipping the mood again with the rowdy middle of side three, "Cadillac 
Ranch," with Soozie Tyrell fiddle solo, and "I'm a Rocker."<br>
<br>
The final run put the Boss at the wheel for the lonely and desperate 
"Stolen Car" (foreshadowing "Nebraska") and the reckless "Ramrod," 
building to an epic 10-minute "Drive All Night" that was indeed all 
heart and soul, with two great Jake Clemons sax solos. The end of the 
road was "Wreck on the Highway" and its sobering tale of tragedy and 
clarity.<br>
<br>
"Thanks a lot. That's 'The River,'" he said.<br>
<br>
For most bands, two hours is a full night, but for the E Street Band, 
even with his voice getting weathered, the show must go on, and on, and 
it did with a roof-raising "Badlands." When the crowd booed the Giants 
in "Wrecking Ball," he laughed and said "Steelers?!"<br>
<br>
From the Boss' greatest masterpiece we got "Backstreets“ and "Thunder 
Road." They raged through another great outtake, "Because the Night" 
(Nils Lofgren spinning on the screaming solo), "The Rising" and more.<br>
<br>
He could not let the night pass without a tribute to a fallen rock god. 
Although they traveled different universes, Springsteen and the David 
Bowie had longtime connections. "He supported our music way back in the 
beginning, 1973," he said, leading the band into first encore "Rebel 
Rebel."<br>
<br>
At the three-hour mark, his voice fading but his energy still strong, he
 kept the engine going into "Bobby Jean," "Dancing in the Dark" and a 
lights-up "Born to Run."<br>
<br>
"Have you got anything left?" He hollered. "Do you have to get up for 
church tomorrow?" And with that, he rolled into the wild, celebratory 
finish of "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" and ”Shout.“<br>
<br>
Getting back to his original question: Were we transformed?<br>
<br>
Are we ever not?<br>
<br>
This was even sweeter, because we witnessed a master doing one of his 
best albums, and one of the finest of all time, with the same conviction
 he had when he first created it. How could that not be transformative?<br>

MSG2 Review<br>
Jon Pareles<br>
New York Times<br>
January 28, 2016<br>
<br>
Keeping an eye on the Clock</strong><br>
<br>
“The subtext to ‘The River’ was time,” Bruce Springsteen said as the E 
Street Band played a slow, shimmering vamp. “Time slipping away. And 
once you enter that adult world, the clock starts ticking and you’ve got
 a limited amount of time to do your work, to raise your family, to try 
and do something good.”<br>
<br>
That was Mr. Springsteen’s postscript to the opening two-hour stretch of
 his concert at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night: a complete 
performance of his 1980 double album, “The River,” prefaced by “Meet Me 
in the City,” one of the many outtakes from the album issued last year 
in the boxed set “The Ties That Bind: The River Collection.” He’s 
performing the whole album throughout his current tour.<br>
<br>
Time means even more now, 36 years after “The River” was released. The 
time Mr. Springsteen spent onstage: an intermissionless three hours as 
he followed “The River” with one can-you-top-this song after another. 
The time that Mr. Springsteen has led the E Street Band, which got its 
start in 1972, still includes its original bass player (Garry Tallent) 
and has now gone through generational changes, with Jake Clemons taking 
over on saxophone after the death of his uncle Clarence Clemons in 2011.
 (At the end of the show, Mr. Springsteen invariably praises the band 
with a carnival-barker string of adjectives that now includes 
“death-defying.”) The time that Mr. Springsteen’s loyal fans have had to
 absorb his albums, revisiting their joys and lessons as their own lives
 play out, perhaps marveling that Mr. Springsteen is still filling 
arenas.<br>
“The River” has held up. For Mr. Springsteen, “The River” was a pivotal 
album — the distillation of a lengthy recording process and long 
deliberation. Released when he was 31, the album opens, pointedly, with 
“The Ties That Bind.” As Mr. Springsteen explained onstage, “The River” 
strove to address the connections, responsibilities and compromises of 
adult life, from the fleeting pleasures of a night out dancing to the 
commitments of marriage and parenthood. The album also changed Mr. 
Springsteen’s approach to songwriting; it newly compressed and 
streamlined his storytelling style. And the album’s 20-song sequence 
carefully juxtaposed its ups and downs, with pensive ballads like “The 
River” itself and boisterous, cowbell-thumping rockers like “Crush on 
You.”<br>
<br>
On the album, and now live, each song responds to the one before it — 
sometimes by extension, sometimes by contrast — in a flux of resilience 
and resignation, impulses and consequences. The songs themselves hold 
dualities; “Cadillac Ranch,” the album’s most irresistibly twangy stomp 
and holler, praises cars yet contemplates death. Time is also folded 
into the music of “The River,” which was made in the 1970s with a 
history of rock and roots — the Byrds, Chuck Berry, Phil Spector, 
doo-wop, Bob Dylan, Otis Redding, the Rolling Stones, Roy Orbison, Woody
 Guthrie — threaded through its songs.<br>
Onstage, Mr. Springsteen was committed as always to connecting with the 
audience and the band, clowning with the guitarist Steve Van Zandt and 
sometimes sharing a single microphone with up to four band members, 
leaning in and out for call-and-response vocals. He often stepped onto a
 platform where people up front could reach his legs, and he walked onto
 and around the arena floor for handshakes, high-fives and selfies. 
During “Hungry Heart,” the hit single from “The River,” he not only led 
the joyful singalong but also fell back on upstretched arms to 
crowd-surf up to the stage.<br>
Mr. Springsteen spoke in depth about a few songs, introducing “I Wanna 
Marry You” as “a song of imagining love in all its excitement and its 
tentativeness,” then sharing an eerie, extended vocal introduction to 
the song, his voice overlapping with Mr. Van Zandt’s.<br>
<br>
“The River” ends in mourning and persistence, with “Wreck on the 
Highway,” a song narrated by an onlooker who wonders about the dead 
man’s girlfriend or family and those who will have to bring the bad 
news: time ended for the man in the wreck, time stretches ahead for 
those connected to him.<br>
<br>
But Mr. Springsteen wouldn’t leave a concert on that doleful note. 
Moments later, the band was barreling through a string of songs about 
lust, love and romance: the pealing arpeggios and Bo Diddley beat of 
“She’s the One”; the galloping momentum of “Candy’s Room”; the anthemic 
surge of “Because the Night” with a leaping, swooping guitar solo played
 by Nils Lofgren as he hopped and twirled on one foot; and the updated 
girl-group pop, with troubled thoughts, of “Brilliant Disguise,” which 
ended with Mr. Springsteen embracing his wife (and backup singer), Patti
 Scialfa.<br>
<br>
The concert’s only 21st-century songs were “Wrecking Ball” from 2009 — 
Mr. Springsteen’s funny, far-reaching personification of a soon-to-be 
demolished Giants Stadium — and “The Rising,” a post-Sept. 11 song that 
plays out as a ritual of redemption. Then came the final, full-throttle,
 standing-ovation, shout-along final sprint: “Thunder Road,” “Born to 
Run,” “Dancing in the Dark,” “Rosalita” and — signaling show’s end — 
“Shout.” They were, besides being unstoppable, songs that have what the 
succinct verse-chorus-verse songs of “The River” had set aside: 
elaborate structures, virtuoso instrumental passages, key changes. But 
they are also songs that have connected Mr. Springsteen and his fans 
through the decades, defying time once again.</div>

<br>
By JONAH WEINER<br>
January 7, 2006<br>
NEW YORK TIMES</strong><br>
<br>
Tomorrow night, the CBS crime drama "Cold Case" will feature the work of
 an unlikely guest writer. He has won 12 Grammy Awards, has sold tens of
 millions of albums, and has never worked behind the scenes in 
television. What's more, he did not type out a single word for the 
show's script. Instead, he sang it all.<br>
<br>
That writer is Bruce Springsteen, from whom "Cold Case" licensed nine 
songs, building a murder mystery around his lyrics. The episode, titled 
"8 Years," follows four high school friends from 1980 through 1988, when
 one of them is found dead.<br>
<br>
"Cold Case," a series that constructs every episode around the 
excavation and resolution of an old unsolved crime, often uses music to 
suggest time and place - Benny Goodman for the late 40's, for instance, 
or Cyndi Lauper for the mid-80's.<br>
But instead of turning Mr. Springsteen's songs, all originally released 
from 1980 to 1987, into mere backdrops, Meredith Stiehm, the show's 
creator and the writer of this episode, used them to construct and 
advance the story. Graduation day is narrated by the exultant "No 
Surrender," while the climactic murder scene is set to the poignant 
"Atlantic City."<br>
<br>
"The idea originally was to use no dialogue at all," Ms. Stiehm said. 
"His songs are that rich, so full of characters and vignettes." Suffice 
it to say, cars, highways and the Jersey Shore figure heavily into the 
plot.<br>
<br>
<br>
Although Mr. Springsteen won an Academy Award for his contribution to 
the soundtrack of the 1993 film "Philadelphia," he rarely lends his 
music to television. "Cold Case" is an exception. The series, now in its
 third season, had used two Springsteen songs in earlier seasons: "Walk 
Like a Man" in its first and "Secret Garden" in its second.<br>
<br>
Wende Crowley, the show's music supervisor, said the courtship for the 
episode being shown tomorrow night was surprisingly smooth. "His 
management was very interested from the start," she said. "Once we had a
 script, we sent it over, and they said yes."<br>
<br>
Ms. Stiehm added, with a laugh, "We have a theory that his wife is a 
huge fan." It certainly did not hurt that the episode's director, Mark 
Pellington, also directed the video for Mr. Springsteen's 2002 single 
"Lonesome Day." Ms. Stiehm said that relationship created "a comfort 
zone."<br>
<br>
A representative of Mr. Springsteen said he was unavailable for comment.
 With the notable exception of "Miami Vice," which made iconic use of 
Phil Collins's "In the Air Tonight" in 1984, television shows until 
recently relied on anonymous session men for their incidental music. 
(Gathered under the heading "library music," many of these performances 
have become cult collector's items.)<br>
<br>
Today, though, producers are using pop music instead. Prime time has 
suddenly become a place to hear familiar songs from favorite groups, and
 to discover songs by unfamiliar ones.<br>
"It's become part of what audiences want to see and hear when they turn 
on the TV: real songs by real bands," said Alexandra Patsavas, the music
 supervisor for the teenage soap "The O.C.," the crime show "Without a 
Trace" and the hospital drama "Grey's Anatomy." "Licensing songs," she 
added, "is a an expense producers are considering more and more 
crucial." The cost of licensing a song can vary widely, from about $500 
to $30,000, depending on the artist and the rights requested.<br>
No show has done more to champion the new and unfamiliar than "The O.C."
 Ms. Patsavas and Josh Schwartz, the show's 29-year-old creator, have 
introduced a fleet of alternative and indie-rock bands to mainstream 
audiences. Mr. Schwartz's musical tastes, worthy of a Pitchfork editor, 
are represented in the show's score and by the character Seth Cohen, the
 show's resident hipster dweeb. Cohen, played by Adam Brody, has become 
an unlikely tastemaker, expounding on screen on the virtues of Rooney, 
Bright Eyes and Death Cab for Cutie, the Seattle foursome signed by 
Atlantic Records after its "O.C." exposure.<br>
Indie-rock bands, which typically enjoy no significant radio play, have a
 lot to gain from hit television shows, where the audience for a single 
episode can dwarf the number of people who bought, for instance, 50 
Cent's last album. "If it weren't for TV, indie bands would never reach 
audiences this big," said Jen Czeisler, vice president of licensing for 
the independent label Sub Pop. "Our bands don't get on commercial radio 
and they don't get on MTV, so these shows are a huge opportunity for 
them."<br>
<br>
Ms. Czeisler noted that after a song by the synth-pop duo the Postal 
Service was used in trailers for "Grey's Anatomy," the duo's debut album
 experienced a notable rise in sales. "They were supposed to be 
flattening," she said, "but they just kept going up and up."<br>
<br>
Along with "The O.C.," shows like "One Tree Hill," a WB teenage drama, 
and "Six Feet Under," HBO's cult hit, have given healthy boosts to 
little rockers that could. Another HBO show, "Entourage," regularly 
features hip-hop songs and has turned the up-and-coming rapper Saigon 
into a recurring character. Shows with largely older (and largely less 
hip) audiences have also incorporated the music of younger acts. In a 
2003 episode, "Without a Trace" featured a song by the White Stripes; 
the British group Clinic and Sub Pop's Iron and Wine have also licensed 
songs to police shows.<br>
<br>
Even bands that enjoy major-label backing and significant sales - among 
them Coldplay, Oasis and even the Who (who provide the theme songs for 
all three "CSI" shows) - can benefit from having one of their songs on a
 hit show. "Big, established bands that are interested in reaching 
younger and broader audiences often license their songs for less money,"
 Ms. Patsavas said, adding, "Sometimes it's just because the artists 
love the show." Last year, an episode of "The O.C." was written around 
six songs from Beck's recent album, "Guero." Beck, Ms. Patsavas said, is
 an "O.C." fan.<br>
<br>
The Houston rapper Lil' Flip was written into the plot of a recent 
episode of NBC's "Las Vegas," and the Killers and Modest Mouse, 
major-label rock bands with indie sensibilities, have both performed on 
"The O.C.," at the fictional nightclub the Bait Shop. As proved by 
"American Idol," MTV's "Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica" and iPod 
commercials that have helped propel record sales for U2 and Gorillaz, 
musicians both new and established stand to sell a lot of their albums 
given the right television exposure.<br>
<br>
"Bands can't just rely on the old ways anymore," said Scott Carter, vice
 president of marketing at Epic Records and Modest Mouse's product 
manager. "These days, you have to have a lot more going on besides radio
 and video if you want to sell a bunch of records."<br>
<br>
Ms. Crowley of "Cold Case" said: "There was this stigma attached to 
television, but now it's livening up. Whenever I approach a band for 
licensing, I tell them: TV is the new radio."</div>

Dave McKenna January 30<br>
Washington Post</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
There are no obvious lyrical or musical themes that unite the tunes on 
“The River,” the 1980 double album from Bruce Springsteen. Not that he 
ever claimed this was his “Madame Butterfly” or “Tommy.” Still, apart 
from collections of rarities and outtakes, “The River” is the least 
cohesive song set Springsteen ever released. Which makes his choosing to
 play it in its entirety during his current tour seem like a flimsy 
excuse to hit the road, without having to make a new record.<br>
But anything that gets Springsteen onstage — as he was for three 
marvelous hours at the Verizon Center on Friday — is fine by his fans. 
After opening with “Meet Me in the City,” a light rocker recorded during
 “The River” sessions that didn’t make the original cut, he gave a 
track-by-track recital of the album.<br>
Some of the songs have aged wondrously. Springsteen occasionally stopped
 rocking to explain to the packed house his motivation behind certain 
material. “Independence Day,” he said, was his first attempt to write 
about his struggles with his father and was written at a point in his 
life when he was first realizing that his parents “had their own dreams”
 about how their lives would work out, before the real world got in the 
way. Most members of the audience were old enough to have been on both 
sides of the parent/child wars by now. Springsteen also said he wrote 
the title track for his sister, who was having domestic and financial 
troubles at the time. As his audience has aged, the gloom inspired by 
that song’s climactic question — “Is a dream a lie if it don’t come 
true, or is it something worse?” — has only gotten more profound.<br>
The sax solos, now delivered by Jake Clemons (nephew of the late E 
Street Band stalwart Clarence Clemons), and the keyboard-heavy new wave 
rockers, including “I’m a Rocker,” set a nostalgic time and place 
musically.<br>
Another sign of how the world has changed came while Springsteen 
reprised “Hungry Heart,” which gave him the first hit single of his 
career. The singer walked into the masses that packed the 
standing-room-only floor and let them pass his body over their heads to 
the stage. He couldn’t have pulled that same stunt during the original 
tour behind “The River”; at the time general-admission shows were banned
 after fans were crushed to death at a 1979 Who concert in Cincinnati. 
As packed and kinetic as the scene at the Verizon Center was, 
Springsteen knew he’d be safe. Any deaths on the floor among these 
concertgoers would probably have been of natural causes. (Springsteen 
was the first major concert act allowed to do general-admission seating 
in Cincinnati after the Who tragedy.)<br>

Center during Springsteen's The River 2016 Tour. (Kyle Gustafson/For The
 Washington Post)<br>
The years haven’t been gracious to other aspects of the album. Hearing 
all of its songs in one sitting reveals that if “The River” has any 
single protagonist, it’s a dubious “little girl.” It’s impossible to 
ignore how vintage “Bruuuce” — who was 31 when the record was released —
 couldn’t stop himself from referring to females that way. No fewer than
 10 of the album’s songs find the singer pleading with or just plain 
ogling one “little girl” after another.<br>
There’s the roots rocker “Cadillac Ranch,” for example, in which he 
drools over a “little girlie in the blue jeans so tight.” And the 
“pretty little girl” he locks eyes with on another raver, “You Can Look 
(But You Better Not Touch).” But she also shows up in “The River’s” more
 serious fare, such as “Jackson Cage” (“Little girl, you’ve been down 
here so long”) and “Point Blank,” which has the singer crooning, 
ominously, “You been fooled this time, little girl.” (Springsteen also 
wrote and recorded “This Little Girl Is Mine” during “The River” 
sessions but gave that future hit single to Gary “U.S.” Bonds.)<br>
<br>
After “The River” set, Springsteen launched into a breathless recitation
 of fan favorites from all phases of his career. The audience, as is now
 expected, overpowered him and the band while shouting through such 
familiar anthemic fare as “Thunder Road,” “Born to Run” and “Rosalita.” 
Shortly before calling it a night, Springsteen performed “Dancing in the
 Dark,” blessing two female fans near the stage with an invitation to 
dance with him, as he’s done, tour after tour, since courting Courteney 
Cox in the 1984 video that made him an international superstar, and 
turned the song into his most successful single.<br>
<br>
Yeah, rock concerts are best left to singles.</div>

Review of The Ties That Bind<br>
By Robert Baird  Jan 29, 2016<br>
Stereophile</strong><br>
<br>
To be Springsteenesque about it, are two records, like hearts, really 
better than one? It’s the question that’s hovered over The River since 
its release in 1980 and is at least part of the motivation behind, The 
Ties That Bind, the latest extras-loaded boxed set to focus on 
Springsteen’s glorious back catalog. To focus the question even more, 
was the single record, the first version of the The River which was also
 called The Ties That Bind, that Springsteen turned into his label in 
1979, a more coherent record, than the 20 track, double LP, The River 
that it had morphed into by October 1980?<br>
After several weeks of listening to the four CDs and watching the pair 
of Blu-ray discs that come with the set, the answer is probably yes. In 
fact, given the 22 extra outtakes that are included here, a case could 
actually be made for a three LP set! Those extra tracks, many of which 
have appeared on the Tracks boxed set (1990), are convincing evidence 
that the man had a mass of quality songwriting material from which to 
carve his cinematic two LP sprawl. According to The Ties That Bind the 
documentary film that comes with this set, the then 30-year-old Boss had
 95 solo demos and 104 full band demos (not all completely assembled 
takes obviously) from which to choose from! The River is also important 
for a lot of reasons. Recorded at the Power Station in NYC, the sessions
 from which The Ties That Bind and The River were drawn from all 
continue the trend that began with the Darkness record of much improved 
sound quality on Springsteen’s studio albums.<br>
<br>
It’s also valuable as being sort of the end of Springsteen’s beginning; 
one last look and listen to the E Street Band before the tides of 
superstardom exploded around their leader and carried him away—after the
 satisfying pause of Nebraska—with the release of Born In The USA, a 
record that’s surely the subject of a Springsteen expanded boxed set to 
come. <br>
<br>
As one among the legions who know the original record, The River, not to
 mention the entire Springsteen recorded legacy, I came to this set 
looking for what was new, something I didn’t have, or hadn’t heard. 
Rather than add to all the earlier reviews of this set, which mainly 
gush about the music and how it portrayed Springsteen’s struggle with 
human relationships (it’s always about the struggle) and his uncertain 
future, I noticed that the two Blu-ray discs in this set almost always 
get short shrift, a brief mention at best. And yet they’re actually a 
fascinating study in contrasts and perhaps the set’s most compelling 
elements. To be fair, there is also a fairly lavish book that comes with
 this set. For those enamored of coffee table books trapped inside music
 boxed sets, this 148 work of art has over 200 rarely seen photos and is
 beautifully done. <br>
<br>
Directed by Thom Zimny, who did a very credible job on the excellent if 
overlong The Promise: The Making of Darkness On The Edge of Town, the 
documentary here,  The Ties That Bind, clearly had a much smaller 
budget. Springsteen is allowed to muse on and on about the songs and 
what he was thinking while writing them, in the process covering the 
same ground several times. Unfortunately, no one else is interviewed so 
the perspective is limited. Even for an artist as connected to his older
 material as Springsteen clearly is, recalling emotions felt 35 years 
ago seems like a shaky proposition. Saying he wanted to write about the 
“imperfect ideas” the hold society together, how he wanted his 
characters to have, “impact and presence,” Bruce does however prove 
insightful in spots. There was the momentous decision to retrieve the 
single album from Columbia, record a lot more material and make the 
record a double album because it was the larger canvas he needed. Also, 
and even more cogent is his statement that what you hear on the The 
River was conceived as trying to address the energy gap between the 
studio records which sounded sleepy when compared to the legendarily 
frenzied live shows. As is always the case with Springsteen, making the 
album was a struggle to say the least. This time, as he mentions in the 
film, he found The River’s sonic footing by listening to the creative 
differences between Steve Van Zandt who liked things “raw” and trashy” 
and Jon Landau who preferred records that were “clean” and “focused.” 
Too bad we never hear from Landau, Van Zandt or anyone else just to give
 this obvious quickie production some breadth and depth. I’d love to 
hear what Gary Tallent thinks. Bass players never get to speak their 
piece. <br>
<br>
But while the documentary is all telling, the live concert is all about 
showing and that makes it this set’s most worthy element. The Blu-ray of
 the concert from November 1980 in Tempe, AZ, pro shot and with 
multi-track audio, which has been an audio bootleg for many years, is 
now a visual bootleg. One that shows the E Street Band at the very 
dizzying heights of its powers as a rock/R&amp;B band that could turn on
 a dime and whose rhythms and musicality really define what a great band
 really is and what it sounds like. This film is the visual answer to 
the question, `What made everybody so crazy about Springsteen in the 
70s?’ Anyone who saw him back then will find it hard not to rock out and
 smile while this plays. Just like that absolutely AMAZING film Bruce 
Springsteen and the E Street Band Hammersmith Odeon, London, `75 that 
was the best part of the Born To Run 30th Anniversary Edition boxed set,
 this film is the treat for the Springsteen fan, everyone who already 
knows the original album. <br>
<br>
The other really wonderful bit here, of course, is the disc of 22 
outtakes. Once you hear them all, the debate about should it have been 
single or double album gets even more confused. While much of this will 
be familiar to dedicated collectors— and make no mistake at one time 
this stuff was the object of much feverish digging, not the grail but 
close to it—it’s still a revelation to hear tunes like the “Born To 
Run”-like big single, “Meet Me In The City Tonight,” “The Time That 
Never Was,” which has distinct echoes of “Jungleland,” the delicate 
“White Town” with its 60s girl group vibe and finally the wonderfully 
menacing “Chain Lightning” with its oddly mixed Clarence Clemons solo 
and Springsteen’s delightful whoop of joy at the end. After several 
listens it easy to see why this material ended up marooned in limbo for 
all these years because it was too electric for Nebraska and by the time
 Born In The USA came around, his worldview had changed so much that it 
wouldn't have fit. <br>
<br>
Worth the 95 bucks? Depends on how much of this you already have. As 
someone who remembers fervently ferreting out these outtakes from 
Italian and Spanish CD bootlegs during the era when the record business 
was engaged in an active legal battle with bootleggers, I have to say 
it’s nice to have all this in one place, in first class sound, without 
the possibility that the revenuers are gonna bust in and drag me off to 
the audience taper lockup. Next up for Bruce boxes, Nebraska???</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN AND THE E STREET BAND</strong><br>
 at the Air Canada Centre, Tuesday, February 2.<br>
<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen specializes in heart-busting, big-life-moment songs 
told from the perspective of someone who knows time is short so you 
better make every second – and every song – count.<br>
Also every concert.<br>
The iconic New Jersey heartland rocker gave us over three hours of total
 passion and commitment at the Air Canada Centre, in support of his The 
Ties That Bind: The River Collection box set, which celebrates the 35th 
anniversary of 1980’s The River, a four-album effort that he and his 
nine-piece E Street Band played front to back. <br>
<br>
The final chords of one song barely finished ringing out before The 
Boss, looking lean, tanned and handsome in hues of black and grey (and 
his trademark jeans), counted in the next one with gusto.<br>
Occasionally he offered up an intro. Independence Day, he said, was 
about being stunned by the discovery of your parents’ humanity, of 
realizing for the first time that they once had dreams of their own. 
“It’s a song about adult compromises,” he said, “and the blessings those
 compromises brought.”<br>
Uplift immediately returned with the familiar opening notes of Hungry 
Heart, especially when he held back for the first verse and let us sing 
it on our own.<br>
The continued push-pull between serious and fun, between dark and light,
 between sprawling "compositions" and lighter-weight fare – Crush On 
You, You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch) – was hugely satisfying. <br>
And after so many Behind The Music-type rock band documentaries, it was 
great to see seemingly genuine playfulness among the musicians onstage, 
many of whom have been in the E Street Band since the 70s and 80s. With 
drummer Max Weinberg and bassist Garry Tallent holding down a steady 
backbeat, the others harmonized and soloed and did cute little moves in 
sync.<br>
Blazing saxophone is as fundamental to Springsteen’s sound as lonesome 
harmonica, and Jake Clemons, nephew of deceased E Street member Clarence
 Clemons, captivated, especially on an epic rendition of The Price You 
Pay, one of the set’s standout numbers. Guitarists Patti Scialfa and 
Little Steven Van Zandt turned out powerful harmonies all night, often 
sharing the centre mic with Springsteen and appearing on the Jumbo 
screens.<br>
Crowd interaction was also high. Springsteen regularly left the singing 
to us, lighters came out during gorgeously melancholy The River, and an 
89-year-old woman celebrating her birthday got the chance to waltz with 
The Boss during Dancing In The Dark during the greatest-hits portion of 
the set as her elated daughter looked on.<br>
Despite the concert already being two hours deep by that point, it was 
that greatest hits section that offered up some of the most energetic 
moments.<br>
The Promised Land (requested via a sign held high) hit hard. Patti Smith
 Group’s Because The Night, which Smith co-wrote with Springsteen, was a
 mind-blowing surprise, his version more triumphant than Smith’s during 
her last few visits to Toronto and featuring a dazzling, almost 
comically lengthy guitar solo by Nils Lofgren that ended with him 
shredding while spinning around and around in a spotlight. <br>
Bridge In Disguise was gorgeous, with a slightly changed chorus melody. 
The crowd lost its mind during Badlands, Born To Run and the 
aforementioned Dancing In The Dark.<br>
We hit the three-hour mark. “Are you ready to continue?” Springsteen shouted. “Are you ready to continue?”<br>
Ready or not, he gave us Rosalita and a cover of the Isley Brothers’ 
Shout, which he repeatedly extended in an almost compulsive way. "I’m 
just a prisoner of rock and roll!" he shouted, almost apologetically</div>
