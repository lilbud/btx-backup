By ANTHONY DeCURTIS<br>
Published: December 31, 2000<br>
NEW YORK TIMES</strong><br>
<br>
I WANTED to let the listener hear the characters think, to get inside 
their heads, so you could hear and feel their thoughts, their choices,''
 Bruce Springsteen has written about his 1982 album ''Nebraska,'' a 
chilling portrait of an America that has spun off its moral compass. ''I
 wanted the music to feel like a waking dream and the record to move 
like poetry. I wanted the blood on it to feel destined and fateful.''<br>
<br>
Those lofty ambitions would seem to run counter to the confession Mr. 
Springsteen made about ''Highway Patrolman,'' one of the most powerful 
moments on ''Nebraska,'' in a note to his manager during the album's 
earliest stages. The song is ''not really finished,'' he said, but 
''about as good as I can get it at the time.''<br>
Mr. Springsteen recorded the songs for ''Nebraska'' in his bedroom, 
using a four-track tape machine. He assumed that those versions were 
merely demos, that he would soon flesh the songs out in a proper studio 
with his band. When he tried to do that, he ended up feeling that he was
 losing the essence of his original vision. He then recorded versions of
 the songs solo in a studio, and the results were similarly sterile. So 
10 of the performances on Mr. Springsteen's bedroom tape, which he had 
carried around in his pocket for months, became ''Nebraska,'' and the 
album's quality of being ''not really finished'' became part of its 
mythology, a crucial reason why it holds such a revered place in the 
lore of popular music.<br>
<br>
Like ''Pink Moon,'' the painfully spare album released in 1972 by the 
doomstruck English folk singer Nick Drake -- and recently revived, with 
perfect postmodern irony, by the use of its title track in a Volkswagen 
ad -- ''Nebraska'' proves several of the most staunchly held tenets of 
the rock 'n' roll faith: the first impulse is the best; the right feel 
trumps musical perfection; production, with its perceived lack of 
spontaneity and its emphasis on craft, crushes the individual voice and 
is the enemy of art.<br>
<br>
Consisting largely of Mr. Springsteen's performing solo on acoustic 
guitar, ''Nebraska,'' strictly speaking, is hardly rock 'n' roll. But 
its risk-taking rawness -- as well as its sympathetic but unforgiving 
depiction, in Mr. Springsteen's words, of ''characters out on the 
edge,'' traveling ''from nowhere to nowhere'' -- is driven by the 
rebellion at the heart of that music.<br>
<br>
It is a rebellion that, for Mr. Springsteen at the time, had taken on a 
political cast. He has called ''Nebraska'' his most personal album, but 
it also indicts the smug certainties of the then ascendent Reagan era. 
In a couple of years, Mr. Springsteen would square off directly with Mr.
 Reagan when the president spoke approvingly of ''Born in the U.S.A.,'' a
 song originally written for ''Nebraska,'' as endorsing his own vision 
of America.<br>
<br>
''The president was mentioning my name the other day, and I kind of got 
to wondering what his favorite album might have been,'' Mr. Springsteen 
told an audience in Pittsburgh. ''I don't think it was the 'Nebraska' 
album.'' He then played a song from ''Nebraska'' called ''Johnny 99,'' 
about an unemployed man who commits a murder. ''Now, judge, I got debts 
no honest man could pay,'' Mr. Springsteen sang. ''The bank was holdin' 
my mortgage and they was takin' my house away/ Now I ain't sayin' that 
makes me an innocent man/ But it was more 'n' all this that put that gun
 in my hand.''<br>
<br>
So the release on election day of ''Badlands: A Tribute to Bruce 
Springsteen's 'Nebraska' '' (SPCD 525) is a heartfelt endorsement of 
that rebellious spirit in a time dominated by political apathy, pop 
slickness and marketing might. As a form, the tribute album has proved, 
almost by definition, to be a mixed bag, and ''Badlands,'' which takes 
its name from the Terrence Malick film that inspired the album's title 
track, is no different. The biggest disappointment comes right at the 
top, a soporific version of the title song served up by Chrissie Hynde 
and Adam Seymour of the Pretenders. In Springsteen's hands, the tale of 
Charles Starkweather and Caril Fugate's murder spree in the 1950's 
becomes emblematic of a corrosive spiritual exhaustion summed up in a 
line meant to evoke the tormented ramblings of the Misfit, the murderous
 main character in ''A Good Man Is Hard to Find'' by Flannery O'Connor: 
''There's just a meanness in this world.'' Ms. Hynde and Mr. Seymour 
stagger through a glacially slow meditation on ''Nebraska'' without 
displaying any comprehension of its violent depths.<br>
<br>
The artists who fare best on ''Badlands'' do so by upsetting the 
listener's expectations as radically as Mr. Springsteen did the first 
time around. For example, Hank Williams III, the grandson of the country
 music legend, transforms the brooding ''Atlantic City'' into a 
honky-tonk stomp, suffusing it with the manic desperation so prevalent 
elsewhere on ''Nebraska.'' And Crooked Fingers, the latest project of 
Eric Bachmann, the former singer and guitarist of Archers of Loaf, 
deftly find the swirling, dreamlike center of ''Mansion on the Hill.''<br>
<br>
Playing beautifully on acoustic slide guitar, Ben Harper sings ''My 
Father's House,'' a song about the devastating psychological absence of a
 parent, with all the heartbroken yearning of a child seeking a 
connection that can never be. Most surprisingly, Deana Carter shoots a 
steamy erotic current through the lost-highway saga, ''State Trooper.'' 
She is the country singer known for the album ''Did I Shave My Legs for 
This?''<br>
<br>
''Badlands'' also includes versions of three songs that were on Mr. 
Springsteen's original cassette but never made it onto ''Nebraska,'' the
 most notable of which is Damien Jurado and Rose Thomas's haunted 
reading of the relatively obscure ballad ''Wages of Sin.''<br>
<br>
In both its stripped-down sound and its themes of guilt, suffering and 
redemption, ''Nebraska'' is Mr. Springsteen's most rigorously focused 
album, if one of his least commercially successful. It was a bold 
aesthetic move by a man who had only recently become a superstar. With 
performances by 13 artists, ''Badlands'' could never aspire to that kind
 of conceptual unity. But, like ''Nebraska'' itself, its implications 
reach beyond the pop marketplace. Complacency can destroy you, these 
songs whisper, because ''there's just a meanness in this world.'' It's a
 message of existential urgency that has lost none of its currency and 
isn't likely to any time soon.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Review: Bruce Springsteen, fans fall for each other in Sunrise<br>
By Ben Crandell, <br>
SouthFlorida.com<br>
April 30, 2014</strong><br>
<br>
Midway through another one of his trademark three-hour-plus concerts at 
the BB&amp;T Center in Sunrise Tuesday night, Bruce Springsteen stood at
 the edge of a riser on the arena floor, surrounded by fans singing 
along to his hit “Hungry Heart,” when he turned and fell backward into 
the sweaty mass.<br>
<br>
Dozens of hands reached up to cradle the 64-year-old singer and, as he 
held the microphone with one hand and grabbed at fans’ hand-scrawled 
signs and souvenirs with the other, Springsteen surfed the crowd all the
 way to the main stage, singing as he bobbed along.<br>
<br>
If Springsteen’s live shows often lean toward thoughtful earnestness, 
this night was more about having fun, with the audience, the set list 
and himself.<br>
<br>
A recurring gimmick came in the form of the many signs that the crowd on
 the floor seemed to have in limitless supply, which Springsteen 
periodically would stop to harvest by the armload. Most were emblazoned 
with the name of a song suggestion, which provided several interesting 
detours during the evening.<br>
<br>
One fan, whose sign said he had just proposed,  was rewarded early on 
with “I Wanna Marry You” from 1980’s “The River.” (“We are in the love 
business!” Springsteen said with gusto.) Other songs suggested by fans 
included “Hearts of Stone” and “Talk to Me,” written for “Southside 
Johnny and the Asbury Jukes,” the under-appreciated 1978 debut album by 
his Jersey Shore friend.<br>
<br>
The night was filled with other welcome oddities, including “Save My 
Love,” a “Darkness on the Edge of Town” outtake from the double-CD set 
“The Promise,” and “Linda Let Me Be the One,”  from “Tracks,” the 
collection of B-sides, demos and revised recordings of other songs 
released in 1998.<br>
<br>
The ageless Springsteen, who turns 65 in September, was in remarkable 
shape,  in quickly damp black shirt and jeans, close-cropped hair and 
the suggestion of a goatee, with sparkly hoop earrings in each ear 
balanced by black sweatbands on his wrists.  That hard look was 
necessary to carry off two of the best covers of the night, a blistering
 and faithful take on the indelible John Lee Hooker blues jam “Boom, 
Boom,” and an explosive version of AC/DC’s classic rock anthem “Highway 
to Hell.”<br>
<br>
The “testifyin’, death-defyin’ E Street Band” was embedded among 17 
musicians and singers onstage, led by veteran standard-bearers Roy 
Bittan on keyboards, Garry Tallent on bass, Nils Lofgren on guitar and 
the relentless Max Weinberg on drums.  <br>
<br>
Guitarist Little Steven Van Zandt, busy with TV work, was replaced by 
Rage Against the Machine’s Tom Morello, who reined in his prodigious 
fret skills admirably until it was time to let loose on songs such as 
“Highway to Hell.” More impressive was what Morello did with “The Ghost 
of Tom Joad,” turning the pensive ballad into a resplendent,  angry howl
 on a guitar etched with the words “Arm the Homeless.”<br>
<br>
While the rarities and covers may have crowded out some fan favorites, 
Springsteen did make time for “Prove It All Night,” a beautifully 
emotive reading of “The River,” the politically charged anthem “The 
Rising” and the equally forceful “Wrecking Ball.”  <br>
<br>
Toward the end the house lights were turned up for crowd-pleasers  
“Dancing in the Dark” (yes, he did pull one lucky woman out of the 
audience to dance and sing), “Thunder Road” and “Born to Run,” which 
inspired apparent strangers behind the floor seats to dance arm in arm.<br>
<br>
Also among the closing songs was the “Born to Run” classic “Tenth Avenue
 Freeze Out,”  which included a classy video tribute to “the Big Man,” 
late South Florida resident Clarence Clemons, and  keyboardist Danny 
Federici.<br>
<br>
The memorable lyric delivered in the song by Clemons, “And kid you 
better get the picture,” was handled by his  nephew, saxophonist Jake 
Clemons, who proved in every way worthy of filling the Big Man’s shoes 
Tuesday night. There is no greater compliment.</div>

<br>
Tampa Tribune<br>
By By Carl Lisciandrello<br>
Published: May 1, 2014 </strong> <br>
<br>
TAMPA — When you’re pushing your mid-60s and have been cranking out hits
 for legions of hardcore fans for the better part of five decades, it 
can be a challenge to keep things fresh for the loyals while blending in
 enough familiar songs to please casual followers.<br>
<br>
<br>
Somehow Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band always manage to deftly 
walk that line, as he did once again Thursday night in his three-plus 
hour show before a packed crowd at the MidFlorida Credit Union 
Amphitheatre.<br>
<br>
<br>
Springsteen and the band were returning to Tampa for their “High Hopes” 
tour, and the kickoff to the Big Guava Music Festival was dominated by 
some of his more obscure tracks, along with a taste from his top-selling
 album, a variety of covers that brought the appreciative crowd to its 
feet, and of course, a few of his signature hits.<br>
<br>
<br>
This go-round felt a little different, though. Against a tropical 
backdrop that produced a bit of a Jersey shore feel, Springsteen 
appeared right at home digging deep into his vast catalogue, while 
displaying such a wide arrary of emotions — somber, joyous, pensive, 
thankful — that took you inside his soul and left fans wondering which 
direction he would go next.<br>
<br>
<br>
Springsteen set the reflective mood right at the start with a “salute to
 the working man,” Paul Robeson’s somber “Joe Hill” — a tribute to a 
labor folk hero who was convicted of murder in the early 1900s.<br>
<br>
<br>
The mood quickly turned with the energetic cover of the 
Clash’s“Clampdown,” followed by “Badlands,” bringing the crowd to its 
feet and featuring the first of a few sax solos from Jake Clemons that 
would have made his uncle, E Street Band fixture Clarence Clemons, 
proud.<br>
<br>
<br>
From “Ties That Bind,” “Out In The Street” and “Candy’s Room,” one got 
the feeling Springsteen was performing from his heart, dishing out his 
favorites and offering his talented mates — including former “Rage 
Against The Machine” guitarist Tom Morello — a platform to help him 
shine. Springsteen was long ago inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of 
Fame, and the E Street Band recently was inducted as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
Especially touching was “Brothers Under The Bridge” off 1998’s “Tracks” 
album. Springsteen introduced the inspirational ballad saying, “I don’t 
think this is a song the E Street Band has ever played” — indeed it was a
 first on this tour — and the emotional Vietnam-inspired story of a 
soldier’s daughter looking for her father brought a hushed to the 
audience.<br>
<br>
<br>
Then it was time to turn up the energy, as Springsteen pulled one of the
 many fans’ signs from the pit and predictably took a request for “From 
Small Things (One Day Big Things Come),”with the obligatory Tampa 
reference.<br>
<br>
<br>
Springsteen teased the throngs with a building energy, from “Wrecking 
Ball,” “Night” and “My Love Will Not Let You Down,” before launching 
into a Them cover of “Gloria” that produced a rousing sing-along.<br>
<br>
<br>
After “No Surrender” and “Bobby Jean” — another request — that energy 
oddly spilled over into the highlight of the set, The Weavers cover of 
“Pay Me My Money Down.”<br>
<br>
<br>
The Southern-inspired jazz tune spawned a mock New Orleans funeral 
procession, complete with the band — led by Springsteen – filing off the
 stage, into the crowd, and onto the concourse, where a camera tracked 
his progress on the large screen.<br>
<br>
<br>
He even mugged with a drink a fan had bought for him mid-song and 
brought back on stage (“That’s a first, my friends, that’s a first!”).<br>
<br>
<br>
The mood returned to brooding with “The Ghost of Tom Joad.” It featured 
co-vocals from ultra-talented Rage Against The Machine guitarist Tom 
Morello, filling in for longtime guitarist Steven Van Zandt, who’s off 
fulfilling TV duties.<br>
<br>
<br>
The second set built to a climactic finish. Fans of course expected to 
hear “Born To Run,” which Springsteen orchestrated with his usual 
perfection, followed by “Dancing In The Dark” (of course he pulled a 
couple of cooing females on stage), “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and a 
deafening cover of the Isley Brothers’ “Shout.”<br>
<br>
<br>
All of which was a magnificent tease for how this night would end: 
Springsteen on stage for a final encore, by himself with a harmonica and
 acoustic guitar. His a capella rendition of “Thunder Road” concluded 
with Springsteen walking away, back to crowd, guitar on his shoulder.<br>
<br>
<br>
The night was vintage Springsteen. With an energy beyond his 64 years, 
interacting with his band mates and playing up to the appreciative 
crowd, the Boss once again was in control.</div>

<strong class="text-strong">Springsteen: Born to shake it up<br>
<br>
Boston Globe <br>
Author:	Morse, Steve<br>
Date:	Aug 13, 1992</strong><br>
<br>
SOUND<br>
A flood of newspaper stories has described the "new" Bruce Springsteen 
as a stable family man and mature rock hero who has grown up after a 
lifetime on thunder road. By his own account, he's also been eager to 
shelve performance stereotypes. Before launching his first tour in four 
years, he discussed tightening his famed marathon shows, dropping old 
songs and focusing on new tracks from his two recent, rite-of-passage 
albums, "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town." But guess what?<br>
He's confounded expectations again.<br>
Despite talking about being "Bruced out" on his old, bop-till-you-drop 
concert days, he's again setting Olympian standards for endurance 
(playing up to 3 1/2 hours per show), while adding and subtracting new 
and old songs with a spontaneity that he hasn't shown in a decade.<br>
Springsteen, who plays the sold-out Worcester Centrum tonight and 
tomorrow in the second stop on his American tour, just finished 10 
eyebrow-raising nights at the Meadowlands in New Jersey. While a number 
of observers, including this one, felt his new backup group lacked the 
presence of his longtime E Street Band, there was no denying 
Springsteen's commitment to shake up these Jersey shows and jar his 
sedate new image.<br>
"In interviews, he's talked about no longer needing the `drug of 
performing,' but he's now acting in direct contrast to that," says 
Charlie Cross, editor of "Backstreets," the Seattle-based, 
nationally-respected Springsteen fanzine. "Where he implied that he's 
gotten over long concerts, he's back doing them. Maybe he needs the 
stage more than he was aware."<br>
Indeed, when Springsteen played Europe last month, he started in 
Stockholm with a two and one-half hour show -- a full hour less than the
 final show at the Meadowlands last week. That gig also featured a 
whopping 31 songs and put the crowning touch on a Jersey homecoming 
(Springsteen hails from Freehold, N.J.) that saw him mix in 15 
additional songs from the ones he performed during his warmup month in 
Europe.<br>
"Springsteen has now done 58 songs total for this tour," says Cross. 
"That compares to the previous `Tunnel of Love' tour, where he did 55 
different songs. And it took him almost a year to build up to that 
number. Also, during that `Tunnel of Love' tour, he did 10 shows in a 
row with the exact same set. That gets frustrating for old-time fans. 
But there haven't been those same frustrations on this tour. He's really
 been into it. I think his core fans are more important than ever to him
 -- and he knows that changing songs will please them. He hasn't changed
 a concert tour this much since 1978, during his `Darkness on the Edge 
of Town' tour."<br>
As Springsteen recently told London's Q magazine: "I don't think people 
go to concerts for a fundamentally intellectual experience. It's more 
like, Hey, how does it feel?" And it's apparently feeling looser and 
looser, judging from his willingness to depart from his earlier aim of 
stressing post-"Born in the U.S.A." material this time out.<br>
The "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town" albums are still, of course, getting a
 strong airing. There's an average of five "Human Touch" songs per night
 (though the hit title track is played less and less) and six or seven 
per night from "Lucky Town," says Cross, who keeps meticulous computer 
printouts of every Springsteen show and has released a compilation book,
 "Backstreets Springsteen," that is must reading for diehards.<br>
But Springsteen has started to loosen up, partly because some fans have 
insisted on it. He played Milan, Italy, last month and finally gave in 
to shouts for his signature 1976 tune, "Born to Run." (He had played the
 song acoustically during his "Tunnel of Love" tour in 1988, but he's 
now playing a band version.) And he then shortly added "Thunder Road," 
an oldie that he didn't do at all on his last tour.<br>
And here are the other songs he's added on various nights since his tour
 began, most of them oldies: "Sandy," "Atlantic City," "Spirit in the 
Night," "Open All Night," "Jersey Girl," "Trapped" (by Jimmy Cliff), 
"Darlington County," "All the Way Home," "99 and 1/2 Won't Do" (a Wilson
 Pickett tune), "Pony Boy," "Cross My Heart," "I'm on Fire," "Book of 
Dreams," "Red-Headed Woman" (an unrecorded song about his wife and 
former backup singer, Patti Scialfa), "Because the Night," "Growing Up,"
 "Racing in the Streets" and "For You," which is from his very first 
record, "Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.," back in 1973.<br>
Apart from this unexpected cross-section, another surprise is that 
Springsteen has mainly dropped the cover songs that used to spice his 
encores. For instance, he used to do a "Devil with a Blue Dress" medley 
of Mitch Ryder songs; "Not Fade Away" by Buddy Holly; and "Travelin' 
Band" by Creedence Clearwater Revival. But as he told Q magazine: "I've 
got my own oldies now."<br>
Another reason for skipping such oldies may be that his new band of 
mostly young players (Shayne Fontayne, guitar; Danny Simms, bass; 
Zachary Alford, drums, and sole E Street holdover Roy Bittan, keyboards)
 did not grow up with '60s and '70s music in the same way the E Street 
Band did. "The E Street Band could be a human jukebox. They could kick 
out nearly any Otis Redding or Buddy Holly song on the spur of the 
moment," says Cross.<br>
Yet while there may be stylistic limitations with the new band, 
Springsteen is not letting it stop the reinvention of his own material. 
Concludes Cross: "He's been unpredictable. His own songs keep changing 
from night to night. And that's made for better shows as the tour has 
gone along."<br>
<br>
VITAL STATS<br>
<br>
SHOWS: Tonight and tomorrow at Worcester Centrum. BAND: Roy Bittan, 
keyboards; Shayne Fontayne, guitar; Danny Simms, bass; Zachary Alford, 
drums, and six backup singers including Crystal Taliefero (formerly with
 Bob Seger and Billy Joel) and R&amp;B legend Bobby King. TOUR'S OPENING
 AND CLOSING SONGS: During his recent 10-night stand at the Meadowlands,
 Springsteen opened shows with three different songs: `Better Days,' 
`Red Headed Woman' and `Local Hero.' He also ended with three different 
songs: `Jersey Girl,' `My Beautiful Reward' and `Bobby Jean.' 
CONTROVERSIAL NEW BIOGRAPHY: Former Springsteen manager Mike Appel just 
released `Down Thunder Road,' a smarmy, tell-all look at the rift 
between Appel and Springsteen in 1976 after "Born to Run" was released. 
Springsteen sued Appel, declaring Appel `cheated' him and was guilty of 
breach of contract, then Appel countersued. The suit was settled out of 
court in 11 months, though the scars clearly remain. The book is loaded 
with minor inaccuracies and psycho-babble. But it's intriguing in 
discussion of the tug of war between Appel and future Springsteen 
manager Jon Landau and in Springsteen's depositions, complete with 
four-letter words.<br>

MUSIC REVIEW Bruce Springsteen At: TD Banknorth Garden, last night<br>
Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band in concert raucous, celebratory, and you just know the beer taps are flowing.<br>
A solo Springsteen show church-like, with seated audiences and the beer taps turned off during the program. Yes, really.<br>
Sometimes, one has reason to believe that Springsteen can actually 
divide himself into two personalities. He's still touring solo these 
days he professes to love it and can find new ways to reinterpret his 
material but one has to question the wisdom of bringing this program to 
the arena level. Granted, he only designated half of the TD Banknorth 
Garden tickets for sale 9,000 of them, with the stage set up at 
mid-arena last night while he played to a curtained-off portion of the 
room but if you had seen him last spring at the Orpheum, then you know 
this show belongs in that size venue, not the cavernous Garden.<br>
Last night he fought tricky acoustics, unflattering lighting, and just 
didn't attain the level of intimacy that this type of show demands. That
 said, there were still plenty of high points, many of them from his 
latest album, the spare "Devils &amp; Dust," such as the antiwar title 
track, the prostitute tale "Reno," and the richly painted story of 
immigrant desperation, "Matamoros Banks," which he concluded with a 
keening wail that has become one of his most emotional trademarks.<br>
But some of the things that worked at the Orpheum didn't work here. His 
deliberately distorted vocals on a couple of tracks (this time on opener
 "Idiot's Delight") were effective in the theater, but unlistenable at 
the echo prone Garden. The Orpheum had been a stunning, one-man, 
Broadway-style show with a consistent flow, but this was a more 
haphazard experience and some of his segues just didn't work. The worst 
was when he went directly from the spiritual power of "The Rising" (and 
its "sky of mercy, sky of fear" allusion to 9/11) to a hammy romp 
through "Lucky Town," with its glib line, "I wanna lose these blues I've
 found down in Lucky Town." Frankly, he should lose that segue.<br>
He challenged the audience with the song list all night which is 
something every true Springsteen fan appreciates but he perhaps filled 
the set with too many obscurities this time. He had fun with some Jerry 
Lee Lewis-like piano on "You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)" and 
added deep-catalog tunes "Nothing Man" and "Ain't Got You," but again, 
the flow was herky-jerky. He did some core tracks such as "The River," 
"Racing in the Street" (lustrously on piano), and the urgent "Tougher 
Than the Rest." But after concluding with the hush of "Matamoros Banks,"
 he appeared for the encore with a ukulele to do a zany "Growin' Up." Of
 course, the song has the uproarious verse "I took monthlong vacations 
in the stratosphere," so maybe the ukulele was an appropriate choice.<br>
Yet, this was basically a mixed-impression show. Springsteen was again 
superb in the way he played so many stringed and keyboard instruments, 
but this was the kind of presentation that fit so much better in the 
cozier Orpheum. Period, end of thought.<br>

Music Review<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN<br>
AND THE E STREET BAND<br>
At: Fenway Park, Tuesday<br>
<br>
Five minutes from Fenway Park a new breed of T-shirt cropped up on the 
streets Tuesday night. In the familiar Red Sox font, the messages read 
-"Bosston'' and "Dancin' in the Park.'' Another one said "Bruce'' with 
the -Citgo appearing in the corner.<br>
Savvy business venture? Sure. But those shirts also spoke to the 
incredible draw Bruce Springsteen has in this town. Tuesday's sold-out 
show -- a tour de force of old-school showmanship and heartfelt 
connection with the audience -- was a testament to why.<br>
It was the first of two nights before Springsteen and the E Street Band 
head to Gillette Stadium on Saturday. Springsteen had been to Fenway for
 a triumphant two-night stand in 2003.<br>
The thing to remember about Springsteen's concerts is that the first 
hour, as solid as it is, is always a warm-up. It's as if he and his 
longtime backing band need to wind all the way up before letting all 
hell break loose; how telling that Springsteen's energy was higher two 
hours in than it was at the top of the show. Clearly he and the band 
feed off not only one another, but also the enthusiasm of the crowd.<br>
Starting with "Atlantic City,'' they hit a stride and rarely let up. A 
triple attack hit hard: "Because the Night,'' "Johnny 99,'' and 
"Darlington County.'' "Because the Night,'' which Springsteen co-wrote 
with Patti Smith, gave guitarist Nils Lofgren a starring turn. 
Literally: he twirled at warp speed while playing a punishing solo.<br>
A five-piece horn section prominently featured Jake Clemons on 
saxophone. He's the nephew of the late Clarence Clemons, who later, 
during "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,'' was lovingly presented in a silent 
video montage that drew rapturous applause.<br>
Songs from the group's new album, "Wrecking Ball,'' had more muscle but 
also nuance that's not as apparent on the record. "Shackled and Drawn,''
 with its chain-gang stomp, was fervent with gospel overtones, while 
"Jack of All Trades'' exuded a quiet grace. And "We Take Care of Our 
Own'' was a -poignant addition to Springsteen's canon of songs about 
compassion and the human condition.<br>
They somehow shoehorned an -awful lot of classics into the final hour 
without making them feel rushed: "Thunder Road,'' "Born to Run,'' 
"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight),'' "Glory Days,'' and "Dancing in the 
Dark.''<br>
Sprawled onstage, Springsteen feigned exhaustion (or maybe that was 
genuine) after that last one, but he had one more jolt in him. Before 
wrapping up with "Twist and Shout,'' he and the E Street Band tore into 
the Standells' "Dirty Water,'' just as they did at their Fenway shows in
 2003, except without Peter Wolf this time.<br>
Three and a half hours later, Springsteen parted with an announce-ment 
that was hard to -believe: "We'll be back tomorrow night!''<br>

So, after feeling like an idiot for not seeing Bruce Springsteen's first
 show at Fenway Park a few weeks ago, I went the second night. Well, 
sort of. I mean, I was at Fenway. I just wasn't inside Fenway; I was 
freeloading from the sidewalk. And I wasn't alone -- not even close. As 
the sun set on Van Ness Street, the sidewalk was lined with folks 
sharing an intimate evening of mooching. Some even brought beach chairs.
 Sure, we missed stuff that paying patrons didn't. But it sounded pretty
 darn good -- we, too, got to sing, dance, and tap our feet to "Thunder 
Road" and "Hungry Heart." I met Ed and Shyana Harper, a couple from Back
 Bay with a family tradition of concert-squatting, having crashed the 
Pink Floyd performance in July and the Rolling Stones show back in 2005.
 Their son Christopher, who is 15, manned a backpack with waters and 
rain jackets. Evelyn, 10, sat next to him. Bedtime, Shyana declared, 
would be "whenever Bruce says we can go home." Springsteen fanatics Lori
 and Bob Chmiel were perched nearby, having driven in from Ludlow. There
 was little to see, so we all just gazed up at the ballpark as music 
washed over the city.<br>

<br>
ROCK NOTES<br>
As if Bruce Springsteen needed any more publicity, there's a new book 
chronicling his career. Thankfully, it is not a quick-hit attempt at 
exploitation, but was written by Los Angeles Times rock critic Robert 
Hilburn. He is a thoroughbred Springsteen-lover who has seen him perform
 several dozen times and driven up to 400 miles to catch a single show.<br>
Simply titled "Springsteen" (Rolling Stone Press, New York, 256 pp., 
$29.95), the book is laden with outstanding color photos and an 
articulate analysis of Springsteen's workaholic devotion to his craft. 
As Springsteen says forcefully to Hilburn: "Rock 'n' roll is a promise, 
an oath. It's about being as true as you can at any particular moment."<br>
Son of a bus driver, Springsteen grew up next to a gas station in 
Freehold, N.J. He was so dedicated to music, Hilburn writes, that he 
played an $18 pawnshop guitar in his room for hours, avoided girls and 
sports, and even missed his high school graduation. Fittingly, in his 
first group he used to sing the Who's "My Generation," the Magna Carta 
of rock songs.<br>
The book is written in a refined style - minus the sweat of Dave Marsh's
 biography, "Born to Run" - but the critiques of the music are 
first-rate. Springsteen's last few years are given short shrift (the 
pressure of deadlines?), but his early years are sharply rendered. The 
definitive Springsteen bio is yet to be written, but this is handsomely 
done.<br>

NAMES AND FACES<br>
Rock star Bruce Springsteen, watching Ringo Starr and his band perform 
in Holmdel, N.J., gave the audience a treat Friday by jumping on stage 
and playing alongside the former Beatles drummer. Springsteen, who made 
his name playing small venues on the Jersey shore, joined Starr at the 
Garden State Arts Center for the concert's final four songs, beginning 
with the Beatles classic "Get Back." Starr is on a 30-city US tour, 
which began in Dallas on July 23 and closes in Los Angeles on Sept. 4. 
Among his accompanying musicians are two members of Springsteen's E 
Street Band, saxophonist Clarence Clemons and guitarist Nils Lofgren. 
Springsteen joined the band in "Have Some Fun Tonight," Starr's early 
solo hit "Photograph" and the finale, the Beatles' "With A Little Help 
From My Friends." Also joining the band for the finale was comedian John
 Candy, who clowned and played the tambourine.<br>

<br>
When Bruce rr Springsteen and the E Street Band take the stage tonight 
at Fenway Park, someone in the audience will make a cellphone call and 
start an unusual virtual concert experience for diehard fans who cannot 
be at the show.<br>
The call is made to a Springsteen fan called a "poster," who sits at a 
computer and sends online reports of the entire concert, song- by-song, 
up to the last bring-down-the-house encore. That includes not only what 
Springsteen plays but sometimes how he introduces the songs and just 
about everything he does on stage.<br>
Devoted followers of the Boss stay online throughout multi-hour 
concerts, often excitedly reacting to the description of what is 
happening with the same fervor as if they were inside the stadium.<br>
"I am like . . . a grown woman," said Elizabeth Gomez of Ridgefield, 
Conn., who plans to take in the Fenway show tonight through the online 
posting.<br>
"I'm 37 years old, a nationally known cancer nurse. I am not crazy. I am
 not a nut. I am a normal person. But watching Bruce like this, it's 
incredible. You feel like you're right there."<br>
Reading the soundless posting may seem like a remote way to enjoy 
Springsteen concerts, but those who have done it say it is amazing, and 
communal, because other fans are responding online in real-time to what 
is happening at the show. It's impossible to tally how many fans take in
 concerts this way, but on this Springsteen tour, the reports have been 
feverish, sometimes with several people posting it at the same time.<br>
The practice is sanctioned by Springsteen's representatives. In fact, 
the postings are on a chat board on bruce springsteen.net. Sometimes, if
 the sound inside a stadium is too loud for the caller to communicate 
with the poster, text messaging is used.<br>
Earlier this week, the decision on who would be the callers and posters 
for tonight's show had still not been formally worked out. But Steve 
Kingsley, an accountant in New York City, has already posted a note 
saying that barring family obligations, he will be available to post if 
someone can call him.<br>
Kingsley is a novice poster who called himself into action last month 
when it looked as if nobody was available to report on a Los Angeles 
show. This came on the heels of several magical concerts in 
Philadelphia, followed by lackluster posting in Chicago. So Kingsley 
called a friend in California named Tommy, who agreed to serve as a 
caller.<br>
For Kingsley, the night was not without several stressful moments. 
Tommy's cellphone kept going bad, so they resorted to text messaging for
 a stretch.<br>
"I did it as accurately and quickly as possible," he said. "Tommy would 
try and call at the beginning of each song. He'd fill me in on what was 
going on, what it looked like, everything. I tried to get a taste of the
 atmosphere. A lot of people were relying on what I was doing."<br>
Jeff Bray of Winchester is going to both Fenway shows, but he is an 
experienced caller who knows that for those logging in to the Fenway 
shows, the night could be painful.<br>
"You're always hoping that he'll open the vault and pull out some stuff 
that he doesn't play a lot," said Bray, 34. "You always want to catch 
that rarity, "Incident on 57th Street" or "Trapped." Classics you have 
to see live before you die. Philadelphia got a bunch of classics. People
 on the Internet were pulling their hair out."<br>
But seeing classics roll across a computer monitor also fills Bray with hope.<br>
"It gives you faith that you might get a piece of that when he comes to town," he said. "You just hope."<br>
In the online community of fans, there is plenty of hope riding on the 
Fenway shows. The reason is fairly simple. Springsteen has never played 
there. Scratch that. Nobody has played there, at least not for decades. 
And Springsteen loves Boston. His Gillette Stadium shows were fairly 
standard, so his fans believe he's waiting to explode at Fenway.<br>
Gomez fully expects to be blown away while monitoring the shows in her 
Connecticut home. She has been thrilled several times on this tour, both
 in person and via the Internet, including when she attended one of the 
New Jersey shows last weekend and in front of her computer the following
 night. Gomez had given her tickets for that show to her brother Danny 
and his wife, who both escaped the World Trade Center when it was 
attacked.<br>
Springsteen, who at that concert played many songs from his 2002 
recording "The Rising," which was inspired by the Sept. 11, 2001 
terrorist attacks, dazzled his fans with little-played, throw-back tunes
 like "Cynthia," "Lucky Town," "Jersey Girl," and "Because the Night." 
Online, the poster wrote, "Unbelievable. Fenway should rock."<br>
"I felt very connected to my brother," Gomez said. "I was so happy for 
him that they were there. He deserved a night out so bad. But it was 
just like I was there with him. It was really a great night. And it was a
 great show."<br>
SIDEBAR: HOW IT WORKS THE BOSS PLAYS LIVE... AN AUDIENCE MEMBER MAKES A 
CALL... A caller in the crowd gives updates with a cell phone via calls 
or text messages. The caller usually relays playlist order and comments 
made by the artist playing. A 'POSTER' ADDS COMMENTS TO A WEBSITE... A 
'poster' recieves calls from the concert and posts information to a 
website where other fans can respond. FANS AT HOME REACT. "This kind of 
list sure sounds real special... Looking forward to hearing from those 
who were there!" Fans read postings from the concert and respond with 
comments, often about the significance of the playlist.<br>

<strong class="text-strong">BENEFITS OF BEING THE BOSS SPRINGSTEEN POISED TO GET OK FOR FENWAY<br>
<br>
Boston Globe <br>

<br>
Your average Bruce Springsteen fan just "ain't that young anymore," a 
demographic fact that appears to make a huge difference to Boston 
officials and residents who are willing - if not eager - to welcome 
Springsteen to Fenway Park.<br>
After a surprisingly placid City Hall hearing yesterday, municipal 
officials are poised to grant permission for the New Jersey rocker to 
play Fenway Park on Sept. 6 and 7. Only a few Fenway neighborhood 
residents showed up to express concern about the shows, and most of them
 said they were comfortable with the concert idea, as long as the Red 
Sox don't make it a habit.<br>
"Different artists pull in different crowds," the head of the city's 
licensing board, Patricia Malone, said - somewhat less poetically than 
the Boss did in the 1975 lament to fleeting youth, "Thunder Road." "You 
think of a more mature, older kind of educated crowd that attends a 
Bruce Springsteen concert, compared to a number of groups I can think 
of."<br>
If Springsteen does get clearance to play at Fenway, he will go where 
performers such as Sir Paul McCartney and Seiji Ozawa could not: 
Concerned over damage to the field, the former owners of the Red Sox 
turned down McCartney's request to play at the ballpark in the early 
1990s, and last summer the Boston Symphony Orchestra said Ozawa's wish 
to conduct a farewell concert at Fenway would cost the orchestra too 
much.<br>
The rock band Smash Mouth played its hit song, "All Star" during the 
1999 All-Star Week festivities at Fenway, and in 2000 there was a brief 
musical performance to cap off a seven-month youth outreach by the 
Archdiocese of Boston. But the last full-fledged concert at Fenway Park 
was in 1973, when about 15,000 people per day attended a two-day 
relocated Newport Jazz Festival performance, featuring Ray Charles and 
Stevie Wonder.<br>
"This is the first time it's a real stadium rock show event," Red Sox 
vice president Larry Cancro said of the proposed Springsteen concerts.<br>
Cancro said Springsteen approached the team about including Fenway Park 
on a tour of major league parks, not the other way around, and that he 
doesn't expect the nearly century-old ballyard to turn into a regular 
concert venue. He said the team's new owners will make "good side money"
 by hosting the Boss (he wouldn't say exactly how much) but that 
concerts wouldn't generate enough money to influence the owners' 
thinking on whether to remain at Fenway Park, mostly because the team's 
schedule wouldn't allow them to hold concerts very often.<br>
Winning a city license for the shows appears likely. Patricia Malone, 
who presided over yesterday's meeting, said, "You would be hard-pressed 
after that hearing to say that public safety and order will be adversely
 affected by this concert on these nights."<br>
Malone has 30 days to decide whether to allow the concerts, but she 
hopes to issue a ruling before the end of the week. Although the Red Sox
 asked permission to hold two concerts, the second will be held only if 
the Sept. 6 concert is a sellout, as expected.<br>
Malone cautioned, however, that she might place a limit on attendance to
 a number below the typical Red Sox game sellout, about 36,000. She also
 might force the Sunday, Sept. 7, concert to end by 10 p.m., possibly 
pushing up the start time.<br>
The Red Sox would like to close Yawkey Way for the concert, as they do 
for home baseball games, but Malone reacted coldly to that idea. The 
team would have to go through a separate licensing process to get 
permission for the street closing.<br>
While the Fenway and Brookline residents who showed up at the hearing 
didn't oppose the concerts outright, they did express concern about the 
noise, which will be more constant than the cheering (or jeering) that 
emanates from a typical Red Sox game.<br>
"Is this amplification going to be done by some `roadie' from this rock 
group, or by the Red Sox?" said Richard Orareo, a 30-year resident of 
the Fenway. "When the Red Sox play the national anthem, I stand up in my
 living room. I don't want to hear Bruce Springsteen in my living room."<br>
Cancro said Springsteen's crew, not the Red Sox, will take care of the 
sound equipment. He noted that the team has cut a special deal for its 
hard-core fans, persuading the Boss and his handlers to hold a "presale"
 of tickets to Red Sox season ticket holders, although details have not 
yet been worked out. Tickets for the general public go on sale Friday at
 10 a.m. through Ticketmaster or at the Orpheum Theatre box office.<br>
If the ticket prices on Springsteen's current tour are any indication - 
he lands at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough on Aug. 1 and 2 - they will 
cost about $75.<br>

<strong class="text-strong">AT LAST, SPRINGSTEEN SPRINGS BACK INTO ROCK - AND WITH A PASSION<br>
<br>
Boston Globe <br>
<br>
Author:	Steve Morse Globe Staff<br>
Date:	Jun 10, 1984</strong><br>
<br>
Last year there was no word from Bruce Springsteen. He didn't release 
any music, nor did he tour. He made a cameo appearance in a video by his
 saxophonist Clarence Clemons, but otherwise was hidden away in various 
recording studios while David Bowie, Michael Jackson, the Police and Boy
 George shared the limelight.<br>
Springsteen, however, is returning dramatically. He has just released 
his most blistering uptempo album in years, "Born in the U.S.A.," a 
blunt but instantly likable record that reaffirms his standing as the 
leader and conscience of American rock 'n' roll.<br>
Many American rockers such as Huey Lewis, Cyndi Lauper and Van Halen 
have shunned social issues and plunged into droll escapism. Springsteen,
 who has never forgotten the restlessness of his youth in the 
working-class town of Asbury Park, N.J., instead hits the listener 
square in the eyes with his latest progress report on the American 
Dream.<br>
Despite the title "Born in the U.S.A." Springsteen is anything but a 
rah- rah patriot as he scans the lingering woes of the Vietnam war and 
the smoldering resentment of dead-end kids who raise hell because they 
fear the future. The title cut itself is a despairing tale of an 
unemployed Vietnam veteran who lost his brother in the war and never 
regained a purpose.<br>
Springsteen's music has been modified to match the times - the songs 
have been shortened from his earlier suites and synthesizers are now 
used more than saxes - but the burning idealism and faith in romantic 
love that has always fueled his music remains undimmed. As he sings in 
"No Surrender," a brisk rocker with a popping drum sound:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">I want to sleep beneath peaceful skies<br>
in my lover's bed with a wide open country in my eyes<br>
and these romantic dreams<br>
in my head.</em><br>
<br>
The song picks up where Springsteen left off in his last band album, 
1980's "The River," in which he sang, "Alone buddy there ain't no peace 
of mind/That's why I'll keep searching till I find my special one."<br>
That search takes Springsteen into the soul of America on the new album.
 He describes a smitten highway worker who falls in love with an 
underage girl but pays a heavy price ("Working on the Highway"); a 
laid-off lumberman who loses his mind when his lover leaves him 
("Downbound Train"); and an aging father who wants to move away and 
start a new life with his wife and child in another town ("My 
Hometown").<br>
There are many lost, hard-luck characters on the album, but they're 
portrayed with the kind of dignity usually applicable to country music, 
not rock. It is a dignity that has been carried over from his 1982 solo 
acoustic album, "Nebraska," which also probed the underbelly of the 
American Dream and showed echoes of Woody Guthrie and Hank Williams.<br>
"Nebraska" was judged as too downbeat for significant radio airplay, and
 so might "Born in the U.S.A." were it judged strictly by some of the 
lyrics, especially in today's climate of brainless, inoffensive radio 
fare. But Springsteen circumvents that problem by wrapping his lyrics in
 joyous rock 'n' roll, forcing the songs to be heard.<br>
Throughout the album, he smoothly integrates contemporary and 
traditional musical influences. "Darlington County," about two cocky New
 York kids who are out for pleasure with a big wad of money in their 
wallets, has a euphoric R&amp;B feel and could easily fit on the Stones'
 "Exile on Main Street." Another tune, "Working on the Highway," is 
indebted to traditionalist Lee Dorsey's "Working in the Coal Mine," and 
the chorus sounds a little like Dorsey but at double the speed.<br>
Contemporary influences also abound. The album's new single, "Dancing in
 the Dark," has a dance-conscious synthesizer track played by the E 
Street Band's Roy Bittan. Some fans have grouched that the song sounds 
like a Rick Springfield hit due to its Top 40 simplicity and sanded-down
 vocal from Springsteen. It is perhaps the weakest cut on the album.<br>
As for other in-vogue touches, Springsteen makes use of hand- clapping 
tracks, though he again proves how impossible he is to categorize by 
adding some coyote-like vocal moans on "I'm on Fire" that indicate that 
not only have his ears been perked to popular radio but also to hoary 
country songs from the '30s.<br>
A dramatic highlight of the album is Springsteen's guitar playing. He 
plays most of his own leads on the album, from ripping blues riffs to 
filigree background lines. His longtime guitarist, Miami Steve Van 
Zandt, who has left the E Street Band for a solo career, is credited 
only with acoustic guitar and mandolin.<br>
The most mysterious aspect of the album, however, is the reduced role of
 saxophonist Clemons. Once the focal point of Springsteen's sound - 
dating back to his early '70s beginnings - he rarely rises above an 
occasional horn squawk and bellow. His near disappearance is the album's
 only serious letdown.<br>
Otherwise, "Born in the U.S.A." has the most vitality Springsteen has 
shown since his 1975 album, "Born to Run." His commitment to rock 'n' 
roll is undiminished, and so, for that matter, is his love of America in
 spite of its flaws. While taking note of the country's turmoil and 
squashed dreams, he nevertheless is not above boasting, "I'm a cool 
rocking Daddy in the U.S.A."<br>

VIDEO REVIEW<br>
Bruce Springsteen has missed a golden opportunity.<br>
His much-anticipated "Video Anthology: 1978-1988," which comes out today
 at a cost of $24.98, just doesn't go far enough. It may please the 
average fan with its collection of MTV video singles and a couple of new
 concert clips, but the more serious fan can expect to be frustrated.<br>
Why aren't there more rarities? In its 100-minute length, there may be 
15 minutes of never-before-seen footage. Why not more early footage, or 
something from a rehearsal or from backstage or from outtakes -- 
anything to spark the set and make it seem more than a video laundry 
list with little or no involvement from Springsteen.<br>
How about some concert footage of his famous "Devil with a Blue Dress" 
medley? And why not add a short interview to make the anthology more 
special? Or some words from the band? Many other long-form videos -- by 
everyone from Aerosmith to Lynyrd Skynyrd -- include some personal 
remarks. Here was a chance for Springsteen to address the issue of video
 itself -- and how comfortable, or uncomfortable, he's felt in making 
conceptual videos for MTV.<br>
Absent is the passion that went into 1986's five-record anthology, 
"Live: 1975-1985." One sensed that many concert tapes were pored over 
for that project -- and the results went much further in pleasing a true
 Springsteen fan.<br>
The new video anthology, however, feels like a rush job without nearly 
the same care. Springsteen has worked hard on every project he's been 
associated with, but this seems an exception.<br>
In all fairness, video has never been Springsteen's forte. He has never 
extended the boundaries of video in the way that David Bowie, Peter 
Gabriel or the Talking Heads have.<br>
Like many rockers of his generation, he looks shy and awkward when asked
 to be an actor. In the 1985 clip of "I'm on Fire" (one of five "Born in
 the USA" videos in the new anthology), he struggles to play a car 
mechanic who services a beautiful woman's Thunderbird, then fantasizes 
about loving her. He could be auditioning for the role of Benny Sago on 
the soap opera "All My Children." Then in 1988's "One Step Up," he plays
 a hard-luck guy who turns up in a striptease club, staring blankly 
ahead. Neither clip is going to win any Oscars.<br>
Knowing his limits, Springsteen has made sure that most of his MTV 
videos have either been concert clips or included concert action spliced
 in with the acting. "Glory Days" is a good example. Directed by 
well-known filmmaker John Sayles, it combines footage of a fun-filled 
club gig in Hoboken, N.J., with a reflective scene of Bruce playing 
baseball with a young boy (who's supposed to be his son) while factories
 loom in the background.<br>
The best of the video clips, not surprisingly, focus on stage 
performance. "Born in the USA," in which his E Street Band is at full 
acceleration, comes from the Los Angeles Sports Arena in 1984. "The 
River" and "Thunder Road," two classics from the '70s, are from the "No 
Nukes" film made at Madison Square Garden in 1979. And "War," the Edwin 
Starr cover song, is from a Los Angeles Coliseum show in 1985. It is the
 identical performance that's on the "Live: 1975-1985" album, complete 
with the antiwar rap about how "blind faith in your leaders will get you
 killed."<br>
The only true rarity is a clip from a 1978 Phoenix concert of 
"Rosalita," in which a skinny, frizzy-haired Springsteen looks so 
different from the muscle-bound figure of today.<br>
The two other teasers for hard-core fans are concert videos that have 
been available only in Europe. They're both from his last tour -- "Spare
 Parts," a volcanic track from a Sheffield, England, concert; and a 
subdued solo acoustic treatment of his once freewheeling anthem, "Born 
to Run."<br>
Unfortunately, the serious fan won't be satiated by these few morsels. 
Springsteen would have been better served by releasing a long-form 
concert video -- perhaps a follow-up to his live-album anthology. Or, at
 the very least, he could have added more rare footage or more clips of 
songs that weren't hit singles. The Boss appears to have let someone 
else take control of this project -- and the results aren't up to his 
high standards.<br>

Greetings From E Street: The Story of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band<br>
By Bob Santelli<br>
Chronicle, 91 pp., illustrated, $35<br>
By Jim Fusilli</strong><br>
<br>
Though at first blush a 91-page coffee-table photo book with text and 
tchotchkes, at its best Bob Santelli's "Greetings From E Street" is more
 than editorial filler surrounding pictures. Santelli, who's done a long
 stretch in the service of rock 'n' roll as an educator and now as 
artistic director of the Experience Music Project in Seattle, was a 
music critic for Springsteen's regional newspaper, the Asbury Park 
Press, in the early '70s. Thus, he brings an insider's view of 
Springsteen's development as a singer, songwriter, guitarist, and 
bandleader. Though there's no shortage of biographies of Springsteen, 
the best and best-known American singer-songwriter of the post-Dylan 
generation, Santelli's perspective is unique and, at least as the story 
begins, there's little stardust in the eyes.<br>
Springsteen is an incidental character as Santelli looks back to the 
mid-'60s, when bars dotting the Jersey shore towns hosted a thriving 
music scene. In 1968, the Upstage, an after-hours club in Asbury Park, 
began attracting musicians who would jam until dawn. Danny Federici, 
Vini Lopez, David Sancious, Garry Tallent, and Steve Van Zandt were 
among those who would drop by, as was Springsteen, a guitar player from 
nearby Freehold who favored Jimi Hendrix, British blues, and American 
R&amp;B. Soon the five were in a band led by Springsteen, who had what 
others at the Upstage lacked: charisma. "There was something magnetic 
about him," said Margaret Potter, who owned the club with her husband, 
Tom. "The indescribable part of him - the way he led the musicians 
onstage or smiled, or the way the guitar hung on his body - made him 
special."<br>
By the early '70s, the Asbury Park music scene was dead, and most 
members of the band headed to Richmond, Va., where a new scene was 
brewing. Not Springsteen. Santelli confirms the legend: Though a rocker 
at heart, Springsteen took a bus to the Greenwich Village coffee shops 
and began performing solo, playing his new, Dylan-influenced songs on 
acoustic guitar. In 1972, he auditioned for John Hammond, the Columbia 
Records executive who signed Count Basie, Bob Dylan, and Billie Holliday
 to the label. He signed Springsteen too, believing he had brought on 
board a new, introspective singer-songwriter. But Springsteen insisted 
his old troops join him to rock. (See "The Producer," Dunstan Prial's 
new biography of Hammond, for Springsteen's thoughts on this period.)<br>
Santelli's early Springsteen tales are enriched by reproductions of 
period artifacts: a business card with Springsteen's home phone; a 
promotional flier for his band Steel Mill - "I have never been so 
overwhelmed by totally unknown talent," wrote one critic from California
 - and lots of photos of a scruffy Springsteen with shoulder-length hair
 parted in the middle, a Les Paul guitar locked in his hands. (His 
signature Telecaster guitar came later, along with a new haircut and 
some work on his teeth.) The marketing tools might have helped him, but 
Springsteen's charisma was matched by his drive and will. Santelli says 
that Columbia wanted to identify him as a New York artist. Springsteen 
insisted his debut be called "Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J." Columbia
 asked him to recut his second album with seasoned studio musicians 
rather than his band, and Springsteen said no. Though the sales of his 
first two albums were minuscule, especially given the label's marketing 
clout, Springsteen fought to do what he wanted and bet his success on 
his ever-improving songwriting and outsize showmanship.<br>
Reproductions of the Oct. 27, 1975, covers of Time and Newsweek, which 
featured Springsteen, and tales of European tours following his 
breakthrough album, "Born to Run," give the reader a sense of how 
quickly he was becoming a major rock 'n' roll star. But Santelli's story
 loses its traction as his subject moves beyond the sphere the two men 
shared. Soon hagiography takes over, the kind that curries favor with 
Springsteen devotees. Of Springsteen's decision to shelve the E Street 
Band for a while in '89, he writes, "Most of [his fans] longed for the E
 Street Band but respected Springsteen's wish to experiment." Never mind
 that, unless Santelli polled all Springsteen fans, he has no way of 
knowing if the statement is true, I've found Springsteen's followers to 
be among the most intractable in rock, and though the albums Springsteen
 made shortly after the breakup are distinguished by keen-eyed 
songwriting, they aren't all that experimental.<br>
Santelli offers several anecdotes that bring us into close contact with 
Springsteen, largely through the voices of E Street Band members, as do 
reproductions of set lists written by Springsteen, newsletters for band 
members, and "you are there" photography included in the package. But 
fanzine-like fawning finally undermines his, and the work's, sense of 
authority.<br>
Maybe unmitigated praise is mandatory copy for such books. But it 
doesn't do much for an artist whose body of work can easily withstand 
probing critical analysis, whose public personality invites a sweeping 
narrative, and whose biography mirrors the old-fashioned American 
success story in which a vagabond protagonist triumphs through the 
confluence of talent, passion, and desire. Santelli's access to the 
beginning of the story, continued relationship with the band, clear 
prose, and respect for scholarship suggest he could be the writer to do 
it. But not here.<br>
All of which means "Greetings From E Street" is perfect for the unquestioning and nondiscerning Springsteen fan.<br>

<br>
It's not like The Boss and I are tight. But when you use the same bench 
press and sit at the same Nautilus machines, well, you can't help but 
share some sweat, you know?<br>
For 20 minutes I moved from bench press to dumbbells to Nautilus, trying
 to economize my workout and make it back to the newspaper from the 
Boston Athletic Club in less than an hour. The half-dozen people in the 
room, all dressed in sweats or shorts and T-shirts, paid little 
attention to each other, as usual. A workout is a workout.<br>
But there was this guy . . .<br>
He kind of looked like Bruce Springsteen, you know? Kind of like a regular guy, but something special about him, too.<br>
I shrugged it off until the radio station playing blared THE BOSS . . . 
THE CENTRUM . . . WIN SOME TICKETS! and this guy strolled out of the 
room for a minute. Was that a slight wince I saw as he heard the ad?<br>
I checked the profile again out of the corner of my eye as I pressed 25 
pounds on the arm cross. The face sure looked like The Boss, but who can
 see the celebrity for the sweat clothes?<br>
Finally, I realized I had been 20 minutes in a fog. People started 
exchanging knowing glances, a kid showed up with an autograph book and a
 couple of gawkers stood at the door.<br>
My casual glances were becoming direct stares, so I figured, what the 
heck? I gave up on the tricep machine and wandered over to The Boss, 
only after noticing that his large, muscular companion had left his side
 briefly.<br>
I would like to say I had some smooth line like on those commercials you
 see where people are so cool while working out, but all I could come up
 with was an "Excuse me, hi."<br>
He said hi back. He shook my hand. His black leather lifting glove against my sweaty palm. I was cruising now.<br>
"So it must be hard to work out when you're on the road, huh?" I asked. Real original.<br>
"Yeah, I just try to find gyms to work out at wherever I go. It's not 
too hard." The muscleman with him was not exactly a trainer, he said, 
but just "one of the guys with the band."<br>
But when I identified myself as a reporter, he cringed and said, "Oh, 
no," and when I tried to keep the conversation going, he was on his 
guard. "Are we just talking, or is this an interview?"<br>
I let The Boss go back to his bench press and dumbbells.<br>
Patrice Cunniff, a manager at the club, later said that one of 
Springsteen's bodyguard's had come in to look around and tour the club, 
then returned with The Boss and another bodyguard.<br>
"They each paid the guest fee, which is $12 for guests in some Boston 
hotels," said Cunniff, who said she was reluctant to talk about the 
visit after the hubbub it had created.<br>
Indeed, things were calm when I worked out, but as I did my final set of
 sit-ups and left the room, I noticed more people -- not dressed in 
sweats -- coming in to catch a glimpse.<br>
"We tried to diminish it, but what happens is, one person makes the initial breakthrough, then others start going up to him."<br>
Gee, who could that have been?<br>
All I know is, he walks, he talks, he sweats and no, he did not offer me any tickets.</div>

<strong class="text-strong">BOSS PLAYS TO HIS BASE; On `Magic,' Springsteen and E Street Band favor rock over reflection<br>
<br>
Boston Globe <br>
<br>
Author:	Rodman, Sarah<br>

<br>
First comes the crisp downbeat, followed a nanosecond later by the 
unmistakable blare of Clarence Clemons' saxophone. Then a bass line that
 swaggers with a young hustler's confidence ushers in the familiar voice
 and the chugging organ riff.<br>
The signature Bruce Springsteen sound is alive and well on "Magic," his new disc with the E Street Band, out Tuesday.<br>
Although "Livin' in the Future," the song described above, bears a 
passing resemblance to the Springsteen classic "Tenth Avenue 
Freeze-Out," it also represents a shift away from Springsteen's more 
overtly political recent work. In the barroom rocker, trouble comes to 
town "boot heels clickin' like the barrel of pistol spinnin' round." 
Read one way Springsteen could be describing a hardhearted woman who has
 unmoored a man. Read another, it could be a bullheaded public servant 
who disappointed on Election Day and "opened the gates and let the wild 
dogs run."<br>
As on much of "Magic," Springsteen leaves the interpretive driving up to
 the fan, offering his most straightforward rock music in years. The 
politics is there, but quietly; sadness, anxiety, and alienation lie in 
the margins of the big hooks and burning guitars where they can be 
parsed by those who care to analyze. It is a canny formula that will 
reel back in the populist daytrippers who were less jazzed up by the 
heavier ideas at work on "Devils and Dust" and his last E Street effort,
 2002's post-9/11 offering "The Rising."<br>
Signs that Springsteen wants to embrace his loyalists start with the 
urgent opening track, "Radio Nowhere," which finds him howling "Is there
 anybody alive out there?" as he heads down the road on a misty night 
spinning the dial and bemoaning the "drone" coming from his car 
speakers. Whether you choose to hear "Nowhere" as commentary on 
corporate radio, the current music scene, or as a larger lament about 
personal or even national isolation, Springsteen's cry that he's "just 
searching for a world with some soul" has a timely sense of worry to it.
 Yet the song also simply kicks butt musically, with irresistible 
momentum and a melodic invitation to sing along.<br>
Many songs on "Magic" will doubtless sound great live when the band 
comes to the TD Banknorth Garden in November, and they'll work 
seamlessly alongside hits from every era of Springsteen's three-decade 
catalog.<br>
The Orbison-ian swing of the cautionary tale "You'll Be Coming Down," in
 which Springsteen ruefully charts the inevitable rise and fall of the 
"next big thing" calls to mind similar melodramas from "Tunnel of Love."
 The unabashedly romantic promise "I'll Work For Your Love" begins with 
the classic lone piano intro that is an instantly recognizable 
Springsteen motif. The playing summons a tingle of recognition before 
giving way to a brawny Max Weinberg big beat.<br>
"Magic" is front-loaded with more upbeat and carefree material, but Springsteen hasn't abandoned his more reflective nature.<br>
The title song is a stunner full of shivery mandolins, spectral vocal 
echoes, and dark menace. In certain hands, magic, as Springsteen tells 
it, can fool as much as it delights. In a hushed voice, he prophesies a 
bleak conclusion to the "tricks" at hand: "There's a fire down below but
 it's comin' up here/So leave everything you know, and carry only what 
you fear/On the road the sun is sinkin' low there's bodies hangin' in 
the trees/This is what will be."<br>
The album also introduces a few couplets that should take up residence 
in the Springsteen book of quotations, notably on the angry, 
war-inspired "Last to Die." In a voice tinged with resignation and 
regret he asks, "Who'll be the last to die for a mistake?" echoing the 
famous words of his friend - and preferred 2004 presidential candidate -
 Senator John Kerry.<br>
Artists like Bruce Springsteen face weighty expectations from fans and 
critics. Every album must either be a stunning return to form or a 
groundbreaking departure to pass muster. But sometimes a good record is 
just a good record, not life-changing or seminal. Springsteen and his 
longtime bandmates prove they still have plenty of cards up their 
sleeves, but they engage in a more practical kind of "Magic" this time 
out. Fifty years from now few aficionados will look to this disc as a 
major Springsteen work; for right now, though, it strikes a tone that 
feels just right.<br>

<strong class="text-strong">BOSS-ISM; FERVENT FAITHFUL LINE UP TO BUY SPRINGSTEEN'S NEW LIVE ALBUM<br>
<br>
Boston Globe <br>

Ed Cronin has seen 23 Bruce Springsteen concerts. He calls himself a 
"pretty much typical" fan, and he and hundreds more of them stood in 
record store lines around the city yesterday waiting for a copy of The 
Boss's first authorized live album.<br>
"Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band: Live 1975-85" was selling to
 a 67-year-old grandfather, a 16-year-old Cambridge high school student,
 a 29- year-old Beth Israel Hospital psychiatrist and practically 
everyone in between. They queued up as 1.7 million copies of the album 
arrived at 2,500 stores nationwide yesterday morning in the largest 
initial shipment of a record ever.<br>
For each person willing to describe how great they think Springsteen is,
 there was someone else ready to say he was much better than that.<br>
"He's second -- after Elvis," said Ross McLellan, a bartender at Legal 
Seafood in Cambridge who got one of the first albums unpacked at 10:30 
a.m. at Strawberries Records &amp; Tapes downtown on Washington Street.<br>
"Bruce is the greatest live performer in the history of rock 'n' roll," 
Cronin corrected him, dismissing the Beatles as "famous for their 
28-minute shows."<br>
"He's the best entertainment ever seen. Nobody compares with him," 
declared Boston University junior Nancy Lynch, on the check- out line at
 Strawberries in Kenmore Square. Lynch saw Springsteen last January 
after trying "since fifth grade" to get a concert ticket.<br>
Strawberries at Downtown Crossing ordered 300 albums, 300 cassettes and 
200 compact discs. The Coop in Harvard Square ordered 1,000 cassettes, 
750 albums and 300 compact discs, and had sold about 200 in two hours. 
Bobby Hall, pop music buyer for the Coop, said only "This Year's Model" 
by Elvis Costello, which sold 1,000 copies in his store in a single week
 in 1978, could compare with the popularity of Springsteen's live album.
 Store managers from New Jersey to California said the pace of sales for
 the record was unprecedented.<br>
"It was unbelievable. We had a long line waiting when we opened," said 
Gene Pembleton of Peaches Records &amp; Tapes in suburban Richmond, Va.<br>
"We've never had people waiting outside to buy an album," said Kenny 
Altman, manager of Tower Records in New York's Greenwich Village, where 
25 people queued up for Bruce along Broadway.<br>
Several Boston stores said they planned to reorder as often as needed to
 keep up with demand through Christmas. Hall said the only prospective 
shortage is in compact discs.<br>
Even fans who already have all of Springsteen's songs, including bootleg
 copies, stood in line yesterday. Mark Bowlan, a psychiatrist at Beth 
Israel Hospital, is a determined fan who once met someone in an alley to
 buy a bootleg tape of Springsteen outtakes called "Fire on the 
Fingertips," after first showing an ID to prove he wasn't a cop. Bowlan 
likes Springsteenbecause, "he identified a lot of conflicts people go 
through as they mature: the hopes, the desires, the failures and the 
acceptance of the in-between that comes with adulthood."<br>
Bowlan planned to record the new album on cassette and "blast it" in his car.<br>
"I don't think the other people in my building could take it at the volume I like it," he said.<br>
Not only young people were on line yesterday. Grandmothers and grandfathers waited, and no one seemed surprised.<br>
Nelson Boyd, 67, wanted a copy for his handicapped son. An elderly 
womanfrom Danvers bought one for her 15-year-old grandson for Christmas 
("I like Neil Diamond, myself," she said.)<br>
Springsteen describes the creation of the 5-record album, recorded from 
concerts in Los Angeles Coliseum, Meadowlands Arena and Giants Stadium 
in New Jersey, and the Roxy in Los Angeles, among others, in an 
introduction to the booklet of lyrics inside.<br>
"In November '85, Jon Landau sent a four-song cassette of 'Born in the 
USA,' 'Seeds,' 'The River' and 'War' down to my house with a note 
attached saying he 'thought we might have something here.' Over the 
following months we listened to 10 years of tapes, the music did the 
talkin', and this album and its story began to emerge. We hope you have 
as much fun with it as we did."<br>
Springsteen's record album, "Born in the USA," sold 17 million copies, 
Columbia Records' all-time best seller. The biggest selling record album
 ever is Michael Jackson's "Thriller," a 35-million seller for CBS. No 
box-set album has ever sold 1 million copies.<br>

Many young artists look at the fickle pop scene and figure they'll be 
lucky to put out one album, maybe two, before the corporate ax falls. 
That's not an attitude to spark creativity -- and it's not an attitude 
that was ever shared by Bruce Springsteen, for whom music has been a 
fervent calling since he emerged from the New Jersey Shore in the early 
'70s.<br>
"From the beginning, I imagined I would have a long work life," he says.
 "I didn't know if it would be a successful one, or what the stages 
would be, but I always saw myself as a lifetime musician and songwriter.
 I was always concerned with writing to my age at a particular moment. 
That was the way I would keep faith with the audience that supported me 
as I went along."<br>
Springsteen, 49, has kept that faith with a new boxed set, "Tracks," 
which skillfully collects 56 previously unissued songs that not only 
show how prolific he's been in the last quarter-century, but how he's 
matured from fun-loving, bar-band innocent to worldly poet/philosopher 
whose recent appointment to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was 
well-earned.<br>
"I always wanted my music to influence the life you were living 
emotionally -- with your family, your lover, your wife, and, at a 
certain point, with your children. So I aspired to write across a wide 
range of topics. I guess the only map I followed was what I found myself
 going through in my own life," Springsteen says from his home in New 
Jersey. (He moved back from Los Angeles, but he kept his home there.)<br>
The four-CD box moves from his early folk-rock, Dylan-inspired days 
(including his solo audition for Columbia talent scout John Hammond), 
through the evolution of his E Street Band into a sleek, R &amp; 
B-influenced machine, to his most recent, post-E Street decade of 
exploring introspective domestic issues, often in sparse musical 
settings.<br>
"It was like an alternate career," Springsteen says of the box. "When I 
listened to the whole thing, it was like another slightly abbreviated, 
but completely alternate, body of work that I felt had really stood the 
test of time."<br>
Much of it also restores the fun to his career. In recent years (and to 
some extent, since he began), he has accented his serious side, 
especially on the most recent studio CD, "The Ghost of Tom Joad," a 
scarifying, Steinbeckian look at a soured American dream. That led to a 
solo tour that was artfully conceived, but almost morose, in the opinion
 of some fans.<br>
The new box, though, helped Springsteen "get back to the fun of a rock 
band. It connected me with singing loud and playing loud again, which is
 something I've always loved doing. It was a big change from `Tom Joad.'
 " Return to the party<br>
Springsteen's party side is back in force on the new box, which is 
filled with high-flying rock tunes that were left off previous discs 
because they didn't fit the mood.<br>
"In the past, some of the songs that were the most fun, and the most 
entertaining and rocking, fell by the wayside because I was concerned 
with what I was going to say and how I was going to say it," he admits. 
"I write in the liner notes that the reason some got left off was just 
contextual. Like, the songs `Give the Girl a Kiss' and `So Young and in 
Love' just wouldn't have fit onto {the album} `Darkness on the Edge of 
Town' at the time, but they were fun bar- band rockers."<br>
Springsteen didn't anguish, however, about filing them away.<br>
"As you're working along, everything you've done remains an ongoing and 
open project," he says. "I never felt like, even when I didn't use these
 songs, they were going to be gone or lost forever. I felt there would 
be a moment when I released them. I just didn't know it would be this 
far down the road."<br>
The 56 previously unreleased tracks were actually whittled down from 
200-plus songs that Springsteen had in the vaults. He took what he felt 
were the best and had them remixed.<br>
"We had three studios going," he recalls of the process. "I had a 
{sound} truck in my yard, I had a studio in the house, and then I had 
{mixing engineer} Bob Clearmountain calling me on the phone from 
California."<br>
He also solicited the opinions of his former E Street Band members, who 
stopped by his home to hear songs they may not have heard in 10 to 20 
years. "I'd run things by them that we were working on at the time, and 
it was fun hearing their responses," says Springsteen.<br>
E Street drummer Max Weinberg would stop by the most, following his gig 
on "The Conan O'Brien Show." He and keyboardist Roy Bittan were later 
additions to the E Street Band, helping modernize its sound in the late 
'70s and '80s.<br>
"When Max and Roy got into the picture, they formalized the structure in
 a certain way, which is what I was looking for," says Springsteen. "I 
was looking for something that would streamline the sound with people 
who had a wide range of playing styles, as Max did. He found the place 
where Keith Moon and Bernard Purdie intersected. Sometimes we played 
like the Who and sometimes we played like an R &amp; B band. And you 
needed somebody who felt completely comfortable covering both places.<br>
"When you get into the second CD {on the box}, that's when we really 
learned how to record the band in the studio dynamically for the first 
time. On those sessions for `The River' album -- when Stevie Van Zandt 
came in and joined the production team -- we were committed to capturing
 some of that excitement. You hear the band tightening and there was a 
sort of very contained chaos on songs like `Roulette,' `Dollhouse,' and 
`Where the Bands Are.' The band was playing with tremendous energy, but 
within a formal arrangement and the tension that's created. The level of
 playing is some of my favorite on the whole {box}. It was a great 
moment -- and a moment when the band realized itself on another level.<br>
"And that carries over to the time of {the 1984 album} `Born in the USA'
 with a song like `Lion's Den.' I should have put that out! Why didn't I
 put that out? It sounds like a hit now. The band is playing great and 
the horns come in and it has a great chorus. It was just too much fun to
 put out, I guess." Childhood influence<br>
In those years, Springsteen was also trying to distance himself from his
 working-class father, who had an enormous impact on his values.<br>
"In the early years, I found a voice that was my voice and also partly 
my father's voice. But isn't that what you always do? Why do kids at 5 
years old go into the closet and put their daddy's shoes on? Hey, my 
kids do it," Springsteen says of the three children he's had with his 
wife, Patti Scialfa.<br>
"They run in the car and they come out clunking along with your boots 
on. And I think that was part of what I was doing. It was the fuel and 
fire for a lot of songs, particularly on `Darkness' and `The River.' 
It's always been a central connection. Then you go beyond it and find 
your own life.<br>
"So as I look through the boxed set, it provides you with records that 
could have been. But it also fills out all those records in a certain 
way and helps articulate a little {more clearly} the connections that I 
was trying to make."<br>
During the interview, Springsteen heaps praise on the E Street Band, 
which included saxophonist Clarence Clemons, organist Danny Federici, 
and guitarist Nils Lofgren. There have been rumors of a reunion tour to 
back the boxed set (Stevie Nicks and Steve Miller have both done 
boxed-set tours in recent years), but Springsteen is reluctant to commit
 now.<br>
"I'll dodge the question as best I can," he says with a laugh. "I don't 
have any concrete tour plans at the moment, but I've talked to the guys 
and, actually, I've talked to all the guys, going back years. The 
relationships have all sustained. I had some of the greatest nights of 
my life onstage with them. I can't imagine at some point that we 
wouldn't do it again."<br>
In the meantime, Springsteen is writing again. He reportedly has nearly 
completed a hip-hop album and a country album, but isn't sure if he'll 
put either one out.<br>
"I'm a synthesist. I'm always making music. And I make a lot of 
different kinds of music all the time. Some of it gets finished and some
 of it doesn't," he says. "I found a gray area that actually works very 
well for me. I tell myself I'm not making a record and then I feel free 
to do anything, no matter how bad or good it might be. And then I wake 
up one morning and go, `I have a record!' I've used that mental state a 
lot since {the 1982 disc} `Nebraska.' That's when I really didn't think I
 was making a record, yet I made one of my favorite records and it had 
some of my best writing.<br>
"I'd like to have another record out by the end of the century, which 
isn't that far away," he says. "But I don't know where I'm going to take
 it at this particular moment."<br>

ARTS ETC.<br>
In some respects, Bruce Springsteen is no different from most of his 
generation. Where he once dreamed of fast cars and fast times, he now 
has children and adult responsibilities. The changes have come swiftly 
in recent years -- a new wife, two children, a new home in Beverly 
Hills. But rest assured, he has not forsaken rock 'n' roll, nor does he 
show the slightest sign of burnout.<br>
Springsteen, 43, is still grappling with demons, still rolling the dice,
 still facing the darkness -- and still coming out on top. Witness the 
excellence of his two new albums, "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town," to be 
released simultaneously on Tuesday.<br>
It's a veritable bonanza from the Boss, one that should keep radio 
programmers and fans sated for the rest of the year. Both records appear
 loaded with hits, though "Lucky Town" is the superior disc -- and 
indeed, may be the most personal record of his career, addressing his 
new family-man status.<br>
Each album is surprisingly well-balanced, combining rock, R &amp; B and 
hints of country. Contrary to rumor, he did not make one a followup to 
the extroverted, hard-rocking (and 12-million-selling) "Born in the 
U.S.A.," nor the other a sequel to the introverted, 3-million-selling 
"Tunnel of Love," which was his last album, in 1987. In fact, both sound
 more like two earlier albums: "The River" and "Darkness on the Edge of 
Town," which also blended his strengths.<br>
Still, there will be intense interest in differentiating the two new 
records (it might have been wiser to release a double album). The 
simplest conclusion is that "Human Touch," made in 1990, is a bit more 
uptempo and driven by studio craft, while "Lucky Town," made in 1991, is
 more soulful and seems closer to Springsteen's heart.<br>
Without a doubt, "Lucky Town" will have the more lasting impact. It 
kicks off with the recent single, "Better Days" -- and that's the 
weakest track on it. The song rides the upsweep of Springsteen's new 
life, and also signals his more guitar-oriented sound (completely absent
 is E Street Band saxophonist Clarence Clemons, whose presence was so 
essential to many a past Springsteen song). But it lacks the depth found
 elsewhere.<br>
The most joyful cut is "Living Proof," a driving, Bob Seger-style rocker
 that Springsteen wrote after the birth of his son, Evan James. The mood
 is inspirational:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Well now on a summer night in a dusky room<br>
Comes a little piece of the Lord's undying light<br>
Crying like he swallowed the fiery moon<br>
In his mother's arms it was all the beauty I could take<br>
Like the missing words to some prayer that I could never make<br>
In a world so hard and dirty so fouled and confused<br>
Searching for a little bit of God's mercy<br>
I found living proof</em><br>
<br>
Sources say that "Living Proof" was the pivotal song that made 
Springsteen want to make a second new album: He felt it shot him off 
into an entirely new direction, and it does. Where "Human Touch" is more
 commercial, with some songs clearly designed for airplay, "Lucky Town" 
is more serious, more stylistically quirky (the stunning acoustic slide 
guitar of "The Big Muddy" stands out) and more immediate.<br>
Nothing illustrates the album's personal tone more than "Souls of the 
Departed," a rumbling rocker with a Mark Knopfler-ish reverbed guitar 
and a story line that again touches on Springsteen's son. The song was 
sparked by the death of a 7-year-old Los Angeles youth, Raphael 
Rodriguez, gunned down in senseless street violence:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">His mama cried, "My beautiful boy is dead"<br>
In the hills the self-made men just sighed and shook their heads<br>
This is a prayer for the souls of the departed . . .<br>
Young lives over before they got started . . .<br>
Tonight as I tuck my own son in bed<br>
All I can think of is, "What if it would've been him instead?"<br>
I want to build me a wall so high nothing can burn it down<br>
Right here on my own piece of dirty ground</em><br>
<br>
The diarylike tone of the album continues on several tunes in a "Tunnel 
of Love" mode, such as the Hank Williams-like "My Beautiful Reward" (a 
near-gospel tune masquerading as a love song); the acoustic, Dylanesque 
"Book of Dreams" (about Springsteen's wedding: "There's laughter and a 
toast from your daddy to the prettiest bride he's ever seen") and the 
stately, mandolin-coated "If I Should Fall Behind," with its tender 
verse: "Each lover's steps fall so differently/ But I'll wait for you/ 
And if I should fall behind/ Wait for me."<br>
The object of all this infatuation, of course, is his second wife, Patti
 Scialfa, the E Street Band backup singer who still plies her trade (and
 quite well) on many of the new songs. And lest you think "Lucky Town" 
is too meditative, you need only listen to the hard rock of the title 
track. Or the wailing lead guitar of "Local Hero," a comic tune about 
returning to his New Jersey hometown and seeing his face on a 
dime-store, black-velvet painting alongside one of Bruce Lee. Or the 
exhilarating "Leap of Faith," about taking the plunge into a 
relationship: "It takes a leap of faith to get things going. . . . You 
got to show some guts."<br>
The "Human Touch" album explores this gut-check theme in further detail,
 but amid generally bouncier, glossier music. "Real Man" sounds like a 
vintage Springsteen R &amp; B tune, as he sings, "Baby I'll be tough 
enough/ If I can find the guts to give you all my love." This is echoed 
in the equally vintage "Man's Job" ("Lovin' you is a man's job"; the 
backup vocals are by Sam Moore, of Sam &amp; Dave fame) and the brawling
 "All or Nothin' at All" ("You just ain't gonna get what you want/ With 
one foot in bed and one foot out/ You got to give it all or nothin' at 
all").<br>
At times, though, "Human Touch" does make you long for the complete E 
Street Band. E Street pianist Roy Bittan helps out, but mostly for light
 coloration. It seems obvious that Springsteen's longtime collaborators 
could have done many of these songs at least as well, if not better, by 
giving them a more live feel. And while new studio drummer Jeff Porcaro 
is steady and capable, he's no match for the more explosive sound of E 
Streeter Max Weinberg.<br>
Then again, the more you listen the more you hear Springsteen's reasons 
for seeking musical independence from the unit he fronted for so many 
years. Many songs are about moving on, such as "Real World" and "The 
Long Goodbye." And the new song arrangements give him a chance to 
stretch out on guitar, which he does with striking success on the twangy
 "Gloria's Eyes," the devil-may-care "Roll of the Dice" and the 
fingerpicked "Pony Boy," a traditional song done in an old- timey, 
Appalachian manner.<br>
Quibbles aside, what both discs show is that Springsteen is still 
charting his own path, still raising issues of faith, hope and 
commitment -- and still addressing them with an honesty that should 
ensure more glory days ahead.<br>

NEW YORK - Rock star Bruce Springsteen will begin a tour of about 22 
cities for his latest album in late February, a Columbia Records 
spokeswoman said yesterday.<br>
No details were available for the "Bruce Springsteen Tunnel of Love 
Express Tour," a Columbia Records spokeswoman in New York City said, on 
condition that her name not be used.<br>
Even though the "Tunnel of Love," Springsteen's ninth album, is largely a
 compilation of solo songs, the tour also will feature the E Street 
Band, the spokeswoman said.<br>
In 1984 and 1985, Springsteen made a world tour for the "Born in the 
U.S.A." album. When tickets went on sale for that tour's concerts in 
Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., New Jersey Bell reported that 
67 million calls - 24 million more than on a typical day - were made by 
fans seeking tickets.<br>

 WEEKEND, PROFESSORS AND FANS, DEVOTEES IN THE CULT OF SPRINGSTEEN, 
EXPLAINED WHY THE BOSS STILL GIVES THEM REASON TO BELIEVE. IS THIS THE 
BIRTH OF A DISCIPLINE, OR A RELIGION?<br>

<br>
James Parker is a writer living in Brookline.<br>
A WILD LIGHT is burning in the eyes of LaurieAnn Yeisley-Drogin, and her
 blonde hair vehemently swings. "Why does Bruce use the same lines in 
different songs? Why does he tell the same story over and over again?" 
Her passion-illumined gaze searches our faces. "Because there is only 
one story out there in the world, and it's always the same! It's the 
story of trying to get back into your father's house and finding the 
door closed!" Yeisley-Drogin is minister of the Joy in Christ Lutheran 
Church in Abington, but her congregation today is not a religious one. 
Devout, certainly, but not religious, because today she is addressing 
one of the breakout sessions at "Glory Days," the three-day Bruce 
Springsteen Symposium presented by Penn State and hosted by Monmouth 
University in West Long Branch, N.J., last weekend. This is Room 231 of 
the university's Bey Hall, drab, staticky, where old lessons smear the 
blackboard, but we're on a high here-we're peaking. In a few minutes 
there will be some Q&amp;A, and a burly man will murmur "For me, with 
Bruce's music, it's an ongoing relationship. It's all him, everything 
he's put out." "It's all of us," Yeisley-Drogin will assure him, "and we
 don't want it to end." But right now she's preaching. "We're all 
seeking," she declares. "We're all orphaned." And as her voice expands 
and her outline flames prophetic in the schoolroom neon, Yeisley-Drogin 
begins to channel the Boss directly: "Because we were all sprung from 
cages on Highway 9, we are tramps like us...and baby" - she pauses, 
inhales-"we were born to run." . . . The Boss is vast. If three days 
spent discussing Springsteen down in his home territory, deep in the 
North Jersey sprawl, made anything clear, it is that-like him or not-he 
contains multitudes. At different moments during "Glory Days" 
Springsteen was variously perceived as a giant of liberalism, a Catholic
 shaman carrying the nation's pain, a hip-swivelling litterateur, and an
 average Joe writ large. Images and aspects of Bruce towered across the 
mental horizon. Ben Eicher, a speaker at a General Session on "Bruce and
 Catholicism," claimed that Springsteen's years of charitable work (in 
the form of donations, benefit shows, promotion of grass-roots 
organizations, and so forth) proved "the absolute linkage of humanity 
and community." Eicher, who teaches religion at a Catholic high school 
in Rapid City and is also Theological Consultant to the TV show "Joan of
 Arcadia," was moved to quote the prophet Jeremiah, Chapter 20, Verse 8:
 "Whenever I speak I must cry out...and outrage is my message." At the 
same session, Bill Ayres, executive director of the antipoverty 
nonprofit World Hunger Year, spoke of Springsteen's backstage encounter 
with a group of 9/ 11 widows, and was unexpectedly brought to tears at 
the memory: "He hugged them with his arms and with his heart. He gave 
them his presence ....This is a man who touches the human spirit in his 
music and in his life." Elsewhere, more conventional academic business 
was going on. In a paper called "What's Flesh and What's Fantasy: 
Unresolved Contradiction in Bruce Springsteen," John Engle reprised the 
"Born To Run" theme, this time as an indicator of the Boss's existential
 poise. "We are literally 'born to run,"' said (or read) Engle, who is 
an associate professor at France's Universite du Sud-Toulon-Var, 
cautioning that this did not imply "a sterile flight into a constantly 
receding future" but rather "an alert, on-the-toes resistance in the 
present to smug simplicity and the easy answer." At a session on 
"Musicology and Springsteen" the writer Caryn Rose presented her paper 
"Action in the Streets: Bruce Springsteen and Punk Rock," in the course 
of which we were surprised to learn that Alan Vega, dire 
beer-bottle-smashing frontman of New York synth-terrorists Suicide, once
 opined that "Bruce is the man." Rose also revealed that Joe Strummer, 
who incorporated some of the young Springsteen's sweat and muscle into 
the Clash live show, was another advocate: "If you don't like Bruce 
Springsteen," Strummer once said, "you don't understand rock'n'roll!" 
There is no safe predictor for Springsteen- worship. It will take some 
long-discredited science, like phrenology or the theory of the humours, 
to explain why there are people who dig the Boss and people who don't. 
Perhaps it's glandular; one man puts on "Born In The USA" and hears 
rock'n'roll's promise renewed, another hears only a rude blaring of 
saxophone, aortic strain in the vocals, bruiser piano, and oofing, 
triumphalist drums. Making the unbeliever's case in a tribute issue of 
Spin magazine, the critic Richard Meltzer wrote in 1985 that he had 
"rarely been able to even look at [Springsteen] without muttering 
expressions like 'master of ersatz,' 'the absolute voice of the status 
quo,' or 'the emperor's new jeans and workshirt."' If you crave the 
Dionysian, if you want your rock stars heretical, wild, precariously 
feminized, wearing twisted crowns of feedback- Iggy, Lou Reed, Perry 
Farrell, Kurt Cobain-the Boss is not for you. Between the hard labor of 
his hours-long live shows and the rootsy thumpings of his band, he has 
always been more of a workhorse, more of a rocker than a rock star. He 
will not expose himself, like Jim Morrison, or stun you with an alien 
glare. But for those who need a closer, warmer fit between their lives 
and their music of choice, who like to see their abiding concerns 
reflected in a familiar sonic landscape, he does the job like no other. 
From the beginning, with Springsteen, there has been worship and there 
has been skepticism. As his career took off in the mid-'70s, the music 
industry was a behemoth discovering its own strength. Label bosses, with
 the post-'60s mass market gaping before them and a cringing rock press 
behind, had unprecedented confidence in their own ability to manufacture
 and maintain a million-selling artist, and Springsteen was among the 
first to whom they gave the full power of the machine. A month after CBS
 released "Born To Run," his breakthrough third album, in 1975, he was 
simultaneously on the covers of Time and Newsweek. Lester Bangs, 
reviewing "Born To Run" for Creem magazine, pronounced it "the heady 
rush of another gifted urchin cruising at the peak of his powers"-but he
 also noted the "cabal of rock critics...making extravagant claims for 
him, backed up by one of the biggest hypes in recent memory." That 
Springsteen was good, perhaps amazingly good, only complicated the 
issue. Born in 1949 in Freehold Borough, N.J., to an apparently dead- 
end working-class existence, he had seized on rock'n'roll as the 
instrument of his redemption, and he played it with revivalist fire. The
 tingling, wide-screen grandeur of his sound, the greaser panorama of 
his lyrics, the reach of his ambition, were phenomena to equal or 
outmatch the scale of the marketing operation. And it is the peculiar 
enormity of his Boss-ness, his easy access to the archetypal, the 
apparently limitless space into which fans-and now scholars-can hurl 
their feverish or meticulously considered projections, that has always 
been the chief turn-off for the unbelievers. There are plenty of rock 
fans who can only tolerate one Springsteen album: "Nebraska," the 
downbeat acoustic record he made alone in his kitchen in 1982. For these
 listeners, the lonely wolf-whoops that ring out in the fading bars of 
"State Trooper"- narrow, defiant, as if Springsteen is testing the depth
 of the vacancy around him-are the sharpest moments in the Bruce canon. 
("If there'd been Prozac in 1982," pondered one speaker at "Glory Days,"
 "would we still have 'Nebraska'?") . . . You don't have to come from 
the Jersey shore-or even America-to get it. For Amarjit Nar, a graduate 
student from Wolverhampton, England, who flew in (and paid a $145 
registration fee) to attend the "Glory Days" symposium, Springsteen is 
someone who has touched her, and who writes about real things. She gave 
me a copy of a poem she wrote about his last British tour: "Rising like 
ghosts from a dream/An army marching through the streets/On a journey to
 see Springsteen/And worship at his feet...." (Nar, who was on her way 
to a session called "Gender and Springsteen," professed herself "highly 
satisfied" with the<br>
proceedings at Monmouth.) Indeed, "Glory Days," to judge from<br>
the atmosphere it generated and the number of people it drew, was a 
success. It's safe to say that it also set a precedent, both for the 
Springsteen-geeked academics who can now hold their heads high against 
the more senior and accredited Dylanologists, and for the realm of "rock
 studies" in general. Who's next? "Into The Mystic: a Van Morrison 
Symposium"? "Obscured By Clouds: a Pink Floyd Symposium"? "When Doves 
Cry: a Prince Symposium"? The field is wide open for the rock'n'roll 
profs. But there were things going on at Monmouth last 
weekend-connections, and minor redemptions-that are unlikely to be 
repeated. "What this is all about, folks," said Bill Ayres, genially 
vatic at the "Bruce and Catholicism" session, "is mystery. And a mystery
 is what you can't undo-you have to go into it. We're living inside a 
mystery." Maybe this is Springsteen's achievement, to have injected into
 the great grim New Jersey Turnpike of American life a coursing 
strangeness, a touch of the other, whether that other be doom or the 
grace of God. It's in all his major metaphors: the line, the river, the 
edge of town. Between waking and sleeping a channel runs, like mercury, a
 slipstream in which faces waver and are distorted, and resolve 
themselves into other faces. Brief cities rise, the "mansions of glory" 
that the lovers in "Born To Run" ride through on their "suicide 
machines." Truer than Dylan? "Everything dies, baby, that's a fact/Maybe
 everything that dies someday comes back/Put your make-up on, put your 
hair up pretty/And meet me tonight in Atlantic City. Bob Dylan never 
wrote that. Bruce Springsteen did. SIDEBAR: Aspects of Bruce MORE THAN 
150 presenters spoke at the "Glory Days" symposium on Sept. 9-11, 
covering 35 topics from "Activism and Springsteen" to "Literary Analysis
 and Springsteen." Here are a few highlights from abstracts posted on 
the symposium website. . . . "Springsteen continues a long line of 
American artists alive to the competing demands of the self and the 
society in which it finds a home....he is getting at a sophisticated way
 of being and understanding in which opposites are held simultaneously 
in creative tension." - "What's Flesh and What's Fantasy: Unresolved 
Contradiction in Bruce Springsteen," by John Engle, Universite du 
Sud-Toulon-Var . . . "Bruce's songs are infused with sacramental symbols
 such as water, light, and marital union. Such images suggest a 
Catholic, incarnation sensibility that sees divine grace infusing 
mundane reality..." - "The Cross of My Calling: The Christocentric 
Imagination of Bruce Springsteen," by Paul J. Contino, Pepperdine 
University . . . "After September 11, Springsteen posited himself as a 
faith healer, a shaman who reaffirmed concepts of universal brotherhood 
and community through an exploration of loss, suffering and redemption."
 - "Boss as Shaman: Religion and the Politics of the Post-September 11 
Bruce," by Bryan K. Garman, principal, Sidwell Friends School . . . 
"[Detractors insist] Springsteen's success and wealth disqualify him 
from speaking for the underclass. The preoccupation with [authenticity],
 however, poses an unappreciated threat: By limiting who can express 
blue-collar concerns, it delimits the range of voices that constitute 
the vox populi and erases the presence of the working class in 
depictions of American society." - "Bruce Springsteen, Authenticity, and
 the Cultural Resistance to Voicing the Vox Populi," by Kirk Curnutt,

<br>
"Ladies and gentlemen," announces a raspy-voiced Bruce Springsteen from 
the stage of the Capitol Theater in Passaic, N. J. It's the 75th 
performance of the 1978 tour and all the members of Springsteen's E 
Street Band have been introduced - save one. The Boss pauses while 
drummer Max Weinberg keeps the beat pumping and the momentum building.<br>
"King of the World," begins Springsteen, with all the melodrama he can 
muster. "Master of the Universe, more powerful than a locomotive, able 
to leap tall refineries in a single bound. It's a bird! It's a plane! 
It's the Big Man - on saxophone!"<br>
King of the World? Master of the Universe?" the Big Man is asked.<br>
"It's a hard job," deadpans Clarence Clemons, during a telephone 
interviewfrom Big Man's West, a music club he owns in Red Bank, N. J. "I
 have to work overtime."<br>
Clemons laughs. "When Bruce first did it, I was so embarrassed. I'm a 
shy guy, you know. I don't blow my own horn - well, I do blow my own 
horn but it's on stage. But when I'm talking to people it's just, 
whatever. No way am I a star. I work hard. I get paid. It's a job that I
 love. I don't put myself above nobody or nothing."<br>
On stage, however, perspectives change. When the hulking Clemons, 
Springsteen's white-suited main man, grips his sax, and chases 
Springsteen across the stage, he does seem to be of appropriately 
mammoth proportions.<br>
"That's the way I feel when I'm playing," Clemons admits. "Like I am King of the World."<br>
Last summer Springsteen and the E Street Band concluded an 11- month 
international tour. Springsteen is America's biggest rock star and, as 
such, he plays large arenas. Clemons enjoyed it, but says, "I just 
didn't get off like I wanted to. It's a lot different when you play for 
20,000 people. The guy in the last row could be playing checkers or 
something. It's that close intimate thing that I miss when we play the 
big places."<br>
And so nearly three months ago, Clemons formed Clarence Clemons and the 
Red Bank Rockers, named after the site of his 600-seat club. The Red 
Bank Rockers, a 10-piece band that includes E Street organist Danny 
Federici, ex- Southside Johnny guitarist Billy Ryan, Warren Zevon 
guitarist David Landau and a four-piece horn section, is on an East 
Coast, weekend-only club tour which stops in Boston for a gig Saturday 
night at the Channel.<br>
They're touring by bus. "Like the old days," says Clemons who is 
temporarily stepping out from The Boss' shadow. "We'll all pile in there
 and have fun. It's different when you travel by plane. You don't have 
to carry your own sax. All you gotta do is show up and play and it 
becomes something else. This is the raw beginnings."<br>
Clemons sings ("Hey look I never did it before in a solo vein, but I'm 
loving it"), plays sax, and leads his band through a set that will have a
 familiar sound to it. The repertoire consists mostly of early '60s rock
 'n' roll, rhythm and blues and soul classics - the inspiration behind 
Springsteen's music - plus "a tribute to the greatest saxophone player 
who ever lived, King Curtis, and some stuff you never heard of."<br>
The Red Bank Rockers will be touring at least through mid- February and 
playing every Sunday night at Big Man's West. As of last Friday, they'd 
played three gigs and Clemons was raving about the symbiosis. Playing 
clubs, Clemons says, "rekindles your kinship to rock 'n' roll, to the 
public. When you got a small club you're touching everybody and 
everybody's touching you."<br>
The goals, Clemons implies, are simple. "We're just having fun and 
turning a lot of people on to some good music. I'm playing every song 
that I ever wanted to play and doing a few originals here and there. 
We're not looking for a record deal or nothing."<br>
Clemons talks about the music he's playing two ways. The more direct 
description: "It's like going to a Bruce and the E Street Band encore." 
Springsteen's shows take the listener on a complex artistic journey that
 ranges from exultation ("Two Hearts," "Prove It All Night") to defeat 
("Point Blank," "The River").<br>
Springsteen's encores, however, showcase his roots. They're gutsy, 
consistently uplifting songs done by the likes of Sam Cooke, Buddy 
Holly, Chuck Berry, Gary US Bonds, Elvis Presley, Sam and Dave and the 
Animals. Basically, the rock 'n' roll has rhythm and blues overtones and
 drives straight and hard.<br>
Clemons' other way of talking about the music is with a philosophic 
passion that approaches religious fervor. "One thing that kind of got me
 into this," he says, "was that I was in this club one night and I heard
 Try a Little Tenderness' (Otis Redding's soul classic) done disco. And I
 wanted to cry. I said, No, no, no, there'll be kids growing up thinking
 that's the way it's supposed to be done.' "<br>
The glossy, high-tech disco boom of the mid-'70s dismayed Clemons. "What
 was it? Where's the reality? I got the beat, but where is the reality, 
the feeling from the soul? That was missing - like a shell it was empty.<br>
"Rock 'n' roll took a big step backwards. We have to go back and become 
crusaders for rock 'n' roll again by going back and bringing it back 
like it came around the first time. We're just bringing it back to 
reality."<br>
Clemons is likely the most noted and influential saxophonist working in 
rock 'n' roll. More and more bands are using sax players and Clemons 
says, "I feel like I played a strong part in bringing the saxophone back
 to its rightful place in music. The saxophone is a rock 'n' roll 
instrument."<br>
He's not a closet jazz cat: "I'm not into free form. I need a pedestrian beat. I was born and raised on rock 'n' roll."<br>
Clemons, also part of the Asbury Park scene that spawned Springsteen, 
linked up with Springsteen and the E Streeters 10 years ago and the 
story of his joining the group has taken on mythic proportions. 
Springsteen, a master of tall tales, doesn't exactly discourage this.<br>
In his Springsteen biography, "Born to Run," Dave Marsh recounts a 
typical rap Springsteen delivered in concert. Springsteen and guitarist 
Miami Steve Van Zandt were walking down an Asbury Park boardwalk at 4 
a.m. when they encountered this big man in a white suit carrying a 
saxophone. The man was coming at them and they were scared. When he got 
close they threw down all their money, hoping to appease him, but the 
big man just put out his hand. They touched, sparks ignited . . . and, 
bang, the band kicks into "The E Street Shuffle," a song, says Marsh, of
 "unity and passion."<br>
And then there's the rap about Clemons descending to earth in a space ship . . .<br>
"I'll tell you the whole thing," says Clemons, enjoying the recounting 
of the legends. "I was playing with this band called Norman Selvin and 
the Joyful Noise, an oldies group. There was this girl in the band, 
Karen Cassidy, and her roommate was going out with Bruce. Karen said 
there's this guy you've gotta meet - when you guys meet it's gonna be 
fantastic. So one day she introduced me to the guy at the Student 
Prince, the place he was playing in Asbury Park. I said Hey can I sit 
in?' He heard from Karen that I was around and I was playing so he said 
sure. And it was like magic. It was like I'd been playing with him 
forever.<br>
"It was like I walked in from outer space or something. In his artistic mind, theatrically, that's poetic justice."<br>
Springsteen will not be joining Clemons on any of the gigs. "I'm his 
biggest fan and he's my biggest fan," says Clemons, "but I don't want 
him to show up. It would be bad for both of us - this is totally 
separate from him."<br>
Clemons' parting advice: "Bring your seatbelts."*<br>

 AND ROCKS; BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN &amp; THE E STREET BAND - IN CONCERT AT 
BOSTON GARDEN; THROUGH TONIGHT.<br>

Bruce Springsteen doesn't let you sit down for long. For a ballad or two,<br>
fine. But when he's ready to set sail, you'd better be ready to be up there<br>
with him. He deleriously challenges your endurance like no other rock artist<br>
today.<br>
A typical challenge came last night after he'd played an hour and a half<br>
and was about to declare an intermission. Most rock acts would have called it<br>
a night right there, but Springsteen calmly said he'd be back, adding with a<br>
clenched fist, "So you'd better be able to rock all night long."<br>
And after a half-hour break, that's just what he did, scaling another 
four-hour evening as though it were a cruise to the local drugstore. Is 
this man ticking like the rest of us, or what?<br>
The Grateful Dead are famed for playing as long as four hours, but let's
 not forget that half the time they're either tuning up their 
instruments or wandering off on laid-back solos. Springsteen, on the 
other hand, goes from song to song as though he were working out on a 
punching bag. There's little letup, and if you should lag behind, he'll 
do what he did last night during "Promised Land" - jump to the front of 
the stage, shake his hands in the air and scream, "What are you waiting 
for?"<br>
And up you'll go, locked in the grip of a man who gives you everything you could ask for in a concert.<br>
Springsteen just plain outdid himself last night. I had seen his 
Providence show on Thursday, and the song selection was similar but he 
was far less energetic. Last night, he moved much more (even dancing 
with a woman from the audience on "Sherry Darling"); did more of his 
patented raps (a beauty before "Independence Day," when he described his
 narrow-minded father as "afraid to dream, afraid to think that things 
could ever get better"); and engaged in more theatrics with saxophonist 
Clarence Clemons (during "Fire," he squared off with Clarence in a 
would-be street fight, threatening to crumple Clarence's cowboy hat and 
finally deferring . . . of course . . . to Clemons' man-mountain size.<br>
What made the show so spectacular was not only the liberating length, 
but the sweep of material Springsteen offered. He's been pigeonholed as 
an R&amp;B artist, but never did that label seem so confining. 
Springsteen touched on almost every kind of American music, from 
roadhouse dance tunes ("Cadillac Walk"); street anthems ("Born to Run," 
which he opened with); acid rock (uncorking his own nerve-fiber guitar 
solo during "Because the Night," reminding you of just what an 
outstanding guitarist he is as well); country music (the aching 
melancholy of "Wreck on the Highway," the title of which he took from 
Roy Acuff); and even parlor music, which he delved into on a smartly 
resurrected "4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)," complete with Danny 
Federici's elegant accordion twists.<br>
There were so many highlights that I'm frankly left gasping here at the 
typewriter. He did "I Came for You" for the first time in years. He did a
 perfectly timed segue between "Two Hearts" (where he talks of finding 
his "special one") and "Prove It All Night" (where he and his special 
one do just that). And he snuck in "I Wanna Marry You," a ballad he 
introduced by saying movingly, "Your dreams remain dreams until you take
 a chance with people."<br>
It was all a wonderful way to turn the corner from John Lennon's death. 
It made you realize just how much we need this thing they call rock, 
especially now</div>

<strong class="text-strong">EXPLORING SPRINGSTEEN'S SPIRITUALITY<br>
<br>
Boston Globe <br>
<br>
Author:	Barlow, Rich<br>
Date:	Mar 22, 2003</strong><br>
<br>
SPIRITUAL LIFE<br>
Ask believers their favorite religious music and you'll get a range of 
answers - triumphant Christmas hymns, the deliriously joyful anthems of 
gospel, perhaps Gregorian chants for those of classical bent.<br>
For the Rev. Jim Symynkywicz, it's Bruce Springsteen.<br>
To the world, Springsteen is a temporal troubadour, known for singing 
about the plight of working-class people and towns. But Symynkywicz, 
minister of Stoughton's First Parish Universalist Church, sees a 
spirituality, and sometimes an explicit religiosity, in his music, 
notably on Springsteen's latest album, "The Rising," a meditation on 
perhaps this generation's greatest challenge to faith - the Sept. 11 
terrorist attacks.<br>
First Parish's Free Market of Ideas program explores topics outside the 
mainstream, and on a recent night, a half-dozen Springsteen apostles sat
 in chairs arranged in a horseshoe in the church parlor as Symynkywicz 
offered his interpretation of "The Rising."<br>
"For some of us, Springsteen is our religion, or at least an important 
part of our religious authority," he said. One purpose of religion is to
 bind together a community, and Springsteen's music "has done that as 
well as any Scripture can."<br>
Raised Catholic, Springsteen lapsed from his childhood faith, but like 
many Americans after Sept. 11, he started taking his family to church, 
Symynkywicz said.<br>
The attacks, however, didn't suddenly turn him into a spiritual- minded 
lyricist; "My City of Ruins" - included on "The Rising" for its obvious 
tie-in, but written before the attacks - has references to church, 
prayer, and "the Lord," plus the repeated resurrectional exhortation, 
"Come on, rise up!"<br>
In "The Rising," a number of songs not only skate on the surface 
language of religion, they plunge into its themes, from the stark 
reality of evil and the pain it inflicts, to the faith that those can be
 overcome.<br>
Some songs weld despair and hope. Consider "Into the Fire," a paean to 
New York firefighters who charged into the World Trade Center and never 
came out.<br>
The song does not sugarcoat the sorrow of that day: "It was dark, too 
dark/to see, you held me/in the light you gave/You lay your hand on 
me/Then walked into the darkness/of your smoky grave."<br>
But there is also the devotional refrain: "May your strength give us 
strength/May your faith give us faith/May your hope give us hope/ May 
your love give us love."<br>
" `Into the Fire' is a prayer, of course," Symynkywicz told his 
audience. Even people who aren't churchgoers arguably could utter "Into 
the Fire's" refrain comfortably.<br>
But if you buy Symynkywicz's interpretation, then another song, "Mary's 
Place," is unabashedly religious. It's also blatantly bouncy, an upbeat 
party song that Symynkywicz views as addressed to the Virgin Mary.<br>
The song describes "Eleven angels of mercy sighin' over that black hole 
in the sun" on Sept. 11. Then comes a call to faith - "My heart's dark 
but it's risin'/I'm pulling all the faith I can see" - and a description
 of a community:<br>
"Familiar faces around me/ Laughter fills the air/Your loving grace/surrounds me. . . . I lose myself in the crowd."<br>
This is a congregation, with Springsteen offering religious community as
 a way to cope with tragedy, Symynkywicz argued, "and I think he had the
 church in mind when he wrote it."<br>
The carpeted coziness of the First Parish parlor with its tiny, 
respectfully quiet audience could not have been further, physically or 
emotionally, from the panicked, smoke-clotted chaos of New York's 
streets. The link was Springsteen's lyrics, which for this audience and 
many others - "The Rising" has sold almost 2 million copies in the 
United States - evoked that day's trauma.<br>
Dawn and Van Eswara are proof of that.<br>
The young Newton couple are Springsteen devotees; their first dance at 
their wedding was to his "Thunder Road" - "and it was really long," she 
recalled.<br>
They had never considered Springsteen a spiritual artist, per se. Yet 
they listened - their 2-month-old daughter, Carly Rose, slumbering at 
their feet in her carrier - to "You're Missing," in which a victim's 
relative catalogs details of every day life that are suddenly haunting 
in her absence: "Pictures on the nightstand, TV's on in the den/Your 
house is waiting, your house is waiting/For you to walk in, for you to 
walk in/But you're missing."<br>
Inevitably, the Eswaras said afterward, their thoughts drifted to each other and their children as they listened to those words.<br>
"It made me really sad," said Dawn. "You can hear a song when you're 
single that doesn't resonate the same way as when you're sitting here 
with your husband and your baby."<br>

<strong class="text-strong">FENWAY CONVERSION SPRINGSTEEN TURNS BALLPARK INTO HOUSE PARTY FENWAY BECOMES DIFFERENT PLAYING FIELD<br>
<br>
Boston Globe <br>

<br>
The old ballpark opened its doors way back in 1912, but it wasn't until 
last night that it finally got, as Bruce Springsteen called it, "a good 
old rock 'n' roll baptism."<br>
And because it was such a special occasion - the first true rock concert
 in Fenway Park history - Springsteen shook the place from center field 
with a "rock 'n' roll house party, a rock 'n' roll baptism, rock 'n' 
roll bar mitzvah, a rock 'n' roll exorcism."<br>
And the fans - chanting "Bruuuuuuce," waving their arms, bowing to 
Springsteen, dancing in the aisles - nearly turned Fenway to rubble, 
going seemingly nuts when the E Street band played right next to the 
Green Monster.<br>
"What a great night, an amazing night," said Michael O'Neill of 
Sandwich. "The guy is incredible. They've got to do more shows. This 
whole thing, it's just incredible."<br>
His buddy, Dave Tamborella of Weymouth, said there was only one problem: "Nobody could slide into second base."<br>
For Boss-ton, this was about as good as it gets. The spirit of the city 
was downright dynamic last night. The Red Sox crushed the Yankees for 
the second day in a row, putting them perilously close to first place. 
The Patriots open today. And Springsteen is playing another show 
tonight.<br>
"I bet some of our predecessors are rolling around wondering what the 
heck is going on," said Red Sox president Larry Lucchino, as Springsteen
 rolled with "Promised Land."<br>
"But if they could be here, if they could sense it, if they could feel 
it, I think they would like it a lot. It's a spectacular night for this 
ballpark and this city."<br>
As Springsteen put it toward the end of the show: "There's not many 
places where you can walk into an empty place and feel the soul of the 
city, but this is one."<br>
He blessed the streets around Fenway, too.<br>
As his voice carried outside onto Yawkey way, Alice Zwicker, 53, of 
Beverly, yelled "Bruce!" with her arms waving in the air. Zwicker turned
 to two friends, Ann Theriault and Cheryl Rust, and asked, "Do you think
 he can hear me?" Rust yelled "OK, Bruce, welcome to Boston!"<br>
Perhaps the best place to hear the Boss - except for 10 rows back, 
center stage - was right behind the Green Monster on Lansdowne Street, 
where thousands of people gathered as the show began. Other fans took to
 rooftops or Fenway-area apartments for parties.<br>
At the Demeter at the Park condo complex on Brookline Avenue, parties 
were raging in several units with fans huddling around open windows and 
craning their necks to hear the Boss.<br>
"It's wild, dude, wild" said partygoer Dan Artle, 24, a customer service
 worker from Medway, as he munched on Domino's pizza. "You can really 
hear him."<br>
At one point, Springsteen acknowledged their presence: "I know you can hear us. Say hello!"<br>
Police reported few, if any, problems. And Springsteen was finished, as 
city officials asked, right around 11 p.m. He thanked officials for 
letting him play at Fenway.<br>
Baseball was not forgotten inside the ballpark. When Springsteen teased 
the crowd about the Yankees rivalry - he called them the "evil citizens"
 to the South - the crowd started chanting, "Yankees suck, Yankees 
suck."<br>
His opening number? "Take Me Out to the Ballgame."<br>
There have been plenty of magical performances in the ballpark: Carlton 
Fisk's home run - the pudgy catcher waving, waving, waving the ball into
 fair territory - in Game 6 of the 1975 World Series. Roger Clemens 
striking out 20 on a frigid day in 1986. Pedro Martinez striking out 
five of the first six batters - all likely to be elected to the Hall of 
Fame - in the 1999 All-Star Game.<br>
And Ted Williams, who returned from World War II to hit two home runs 
and two singles in the 1946 All-Star Game, slammed a home run on his 
last at-bat at Fenway. The list goes on.<br>
But live music has been heard rarely at Fenway: Ray Charles, Stevie 
Wonder, and War played the park in 1973, during the Newport Jazz 
Festival, and Smashmouth played one song during baseball's All- Star 
festivities in 1999.<br>
In row 20, center stage, Springsteen lived up to the historic calling of the night.<br>
"It gets no better than this, Bruce at Fenway Park," said Peggy Quilty 
of the Back Bay, who came with her husband and her two daughters, ages 
14 and 21. "We love Bruce. He's been amazing tonight."<br>
Her 21-year-old daughter, Laura, said: "Bruce is a total American classic. And here he is."<br>

Boston Globe <br>

<br>
Last year, Michael Jackson.<br>
This year, Bruce Springsteen.<br>
The Boston area is the fifth-largest music market in the country, yet 
the industry's two top stars will not have played the region on their 
latest tours. It amounts to a slap in the face for pop-music lovers and 
poses serious problems for local stadium shows in the future.<br>
There's no other stadium in the nation, according to trade 
professionals, that faces such red tape as Sullivan Stadium in 
Foxborough, where town selectmen canceled Jackson's concerts last 
summer, then professed surprise when Springsteen on Monday night pulled 
out of an Aug. 29 date because he couldn't abide a town bylaw requiring a
 five-week delay before a concert permit could be issued.<br>
It was also learned yesterday that Wham!, the popular teen group that 
has been playing stadium dates on the West Coast, was eyeing Foxborough 
for September but passed upon learning of the bureaucratic struggles 
that lay ahead, a source close to the band said.<br>
"I would have to feel that under the present conditions that more groups
 would have to start thinking that way," Micael Chamberlain, a spokesman
 for Stadium Management Corp., which operates Sullivan Stadium, said 
yesterday.<br>
All of which leaves local consumers shut out of super-scale shows. The 
tragedy is that those who are losing are not the bedraggled, glassy-eyed
 weirdos thought by doubting Toms to form "the rock crowd." In Jackson's
 case, it was families with young children. In Wham!'s case, it's mostly
 young, fashionable girls. And in Springsteen's case, it's the cream of 
thecollege crowd on up to Route 128 computer executives, office 
managers, stable suburbanites and numerous over-30s who have the money 
to pay exorbitant scalpers' fees.<br>
In the wake of Springsteen's pull-out, many of the principals involved 
were in hiding yesterday. Springsteen's manager was unavailable, as were
 his New York booking agents. Neil Jacobsen of Boston's Tea Party 
Concerts, which was to promote the Aug. 29 date, answered his phone but 
only to say, "I don't understand the thought processes of the Town of 
Foxborough selectmen. This is something they have to live with."<br>
"It's a major loss," added Frank Russo, the Providence promoter who 
first hoped to bring the Jacksons in and also recently bid on 
Springsteen. "For any bureaucratic situation to offset a history- making
 engagement such as this, is a shame."<br>
Where to go from here? Observers have wondered whether Sullivan Stadium 
might test the Foxborough bylaw in court, claiming it is too harsh a 
regulation on a private business. Chamberlain said yesterday, however: 
"We're going to wait and see what will happen. There are no plans to say
 or do anything. At some point we'll get involved, but we haven't played
 that card yet."<br>
The stadium, of course, has to live with the town, so such a divisive step is unlikely.<br>
Another gloomy prospect is the selectmen's avowed opposition to two-date
 concerts. There are only a few stars who could play two shows - 
Springsteen, the Jacksons and the Rolling Stones come to mind - but with
 the enormous expenses of their tours they're even more likely to take 
their acts elsewhere now rather than play only one engagement.<br>
As for Springsteen, the logic behind his cancellation is not hard to 
fathom. He has a trouble-free concert record, has become the darling of 
the industry and hardly wanted the blemish of being "banned in 
Foxborough" the day before his show.<br>
Ironically, though, his good sense to wait to announce his tour until 
after July 13's Live Aid concert - so as not to upstage the event - only
 put Sullivan Stadium further behind the eight-ball in dealing with the 
Foxborough bylaw. That, however, is the nature of the music business. It
 is a hectic, last-minute world, fundamentally different from the 
snail-like pace of small- town politics.<br>
Coupled with the embarrassing lack of Boston Garden shows these days, 
the Foxborough fiasco only further suggests that the gap between music 
and politics is widening rather than being healed.<br>

Concert Review at the Music Hall, Boston<br>
March 23, 1977<br>
Boston Globe<br>
<br>
By  Ernie Santasussio</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
As the rains pelted Bolyston Street inside the Music Hall, the Wunderkid
 of Rock, Bruce Springsteen was recreating tableux of sun bleached 
Jersey streets, souped up Chevies and prurient adolescence. <br>
<br>
He was conducting his own symphony of the sidewalk with angry thrusts 
and sensual sideswipes as a capacity crowd of 4200 showed their 
appreciation. It was a genuine moment in rock when realization met the 
anticipation and Springsteen proved that he was no creature of hype.<br>
<br>
During a two hour non stop performance, the pinball wizard of Asbury 
Park lit up the stage with a dazzling light show of  dynamic 
pyrotechnics . He roamed the bandstand like a frantic stallion and 
played the audience like a finely tuned harp. <br>
<br>
The lyrical clout of the songs was conspicuous. The restlessness of 
youth, its feeling of isolation and the urban lowlife encapsulating 
those feelings made for easy rapport with the listeners. <br>
<br>
In truth, there is a contextual sameness to much of Springsteen’s 
writings. How many different ways does one describe the eternal zooming 
down a two lane highway for a night on the town and the yen to snap the 
fetters of parental discipline ? <br>
<br>
Springsteen, based on his three album output, does become somewhat 
repetitious but his total performance revealing him as probably rock’s 
most complete entertainer, considerably mitigates this sin.<br>
<br>
Some have said his lyrics are susceptible to several interpretations. 
Maybe, but their essence is as conspicuous as the unrelenting zeal with 
which he attacks each of his songs. <br>
<br>
While not a concept program, the content in its way comprised a curbside
 cantata with Springsteen feverishly assaulting the consciousness with 
an intensity that continued to swell finally erupting in the bombast 
frenzy of Rosalita. There was the potent imagery of Thunder Road  in 
which the Sal Mineo like rebel cajoled his girl to escape to Backstreets
 smouldering in youthful frustration and loneliness and Born to Run a 
percussive drag race in which the audience members went along for the 
wild ride.<br>
<br>
Squatting in front of the stage and with only backlighting to create a 
Wyeth starkness, Springsteen rasped out a recitation of Jungleland. 
Earlier, he had burlesqued a  Simian pose during Tenth Avenue Freezeout,
 and introduce a frolicy composition, yet unnamed, with a bolero opening
 crisp choreography and a vocal urgency of  a Van Morrison. <br>
<br>
Thunder Roads was as delightful as any with its Bo Didley hand jive  
supplanted by Max Weinberg’s muscular drum accents. Spirit in the Night 
had the band loping and Springsteen leaping into the audience area. 
Returning on stage, he dredged up a James Brown bit by supplicatingly 
clutching the left leg of saxophonist Clarence Clemons. <br>
<br>
The E Street Band also included Roy Bittan on piano, Danny Frederici 
organ, , Garry Tallent playing bass and Steve Van Zandt guitar. The 
augmenting Miami Horns numbered Ed De Palma baritone saxophone, Denis 
Orlock trombone and John Benkley and Steve Parezcky trumpets.<br>
<br>
One standee was heard to give the following on the spot evaluation: “He’s the best”.<br>
Whether this is the consensus of Bruce Springsteen’s talent is a moot 
question. He is most assuredly as refreshing as zephyr in the desert and
 a welcome  messenger seemingly offering deliverance of the dross 
afflicting too much of rock. Springsteen has now arrived at the elite 
plateau where Joe Cocker could have been. <br>
<br>
The pinball champ from Asbury Park took his shots and lit up the board last night.<br>

<strong class="text-strong">SPRINGSTEEN'S GLORY DAYS<br>
<br>
Boston Globe <br>
<br>
Author:	Flanagan, Bill<br>
Date:	Aug 30, 1984</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is probably America's top rock performer. He may not 
sell the most records - although this summer he's close with a hit album
 and a hit single - but Springsteen has the greatest impact.<br>
He recently sold out 10 shows at New Jersey's Meadowlands arena, more 
than 200,000 tickets, in little more than a day. That set a record for 
paid attendance at a musical event in the New York metropolitan area.<br>
What sets Springsteen above his competition is a consistent 
personalvision, and the artistic ability to convey that vision to a 
large audience.<br>
When Springsteen checks into the Worcester Centrum for two sold- out 
shows next Tuesday and Wednesday it will be his first visit to New 
England since 1980. Since then he has released two albums - "Nebraska" 
two years ago and "Born in the USA" this summer.<br>
"Nebraska" is a bleak portrait of desperate lives and short fuses. The 
record's production was as stark as the subject matter: Springsteen 
recorded the album on a cassette deck in his home, accompanying himself 
on guitar and harmonica.<br>
"Born in the USA," the hit studio-made rock 'n' roll album Springsteen 
released in June, is as energetic as "Nebraska" is dark. Yet the two 
records share one spirit, a determined Americanism that suggests that 
the best days are gone, but a man has to grit his teeth and walk tall 
into the darkness.<br>
Springsteen, a product of blue collar, small town New Jersey, writes and
 sings in the voices of people who cling to the American dream in spite 
of thedream's failure. The title song of "Born in the USA" is the story 
of a Vietnam veteran who, a decade after coming home, still can't fit 
into society or vent his frustration at having sacrificed so much for a 
lost cause:<br>
Had a brother at Khe Sahn<br>
Fighting off the Viet Cong;<br>
They're still there. He's all gone<br>
Springsteen is a songwriter of depth and intelligence. His detractors 
miss this both because he is subtle and because he makes an effort to 
write in his own speaking voice, the voice of an ethnic working class 
American.<br>
On Aug. 20, at the last of his 10 New Jersey concerts, Springsteen was 
greeted by American flags and by banners emblazoned with maps of the 
United States. He opened his show with a screaming version of "Born in 
the USA," and the crowd stood and chanted the title refrain like a 
pledge of allegiance.<br>
Springsteen's Americanism is a tangle of conflicting emotions. But it 
was obvious in New Jersey that many of his fans identify it with simple 
jingoism. Teenagers in the Reagan era, who barely remember Watergate or 
the fall of Saigon, whose first impression of US foreign policy was 
formed by the Iranian hostage crisis, don't share the 34-year-old 
Springsteen's memories of theVietnam era.<br>
They don't even catch the irony when, after describing his personal and 
economic desperation, Springsteen's Vietnam veteran declares, "I'm a 
cool rockin' daddy in the USA." They just sing along.<br>
Yet if conservative rock fans are off-base in using Springsteen's hits 
as marching songs, former hippies have probably been equally wrong in 
assuming Bruce is an old-fashioned rock 'n' roll leftist.<br>
On Springsteen's 1973 debut album a song called "Lost in the Flood" 
described a Vietnam veteran returning home to find he no longer fits 
into the society he'd gone off to defend. In the Nixon era, it was easy 
to assume that Springsteen was mocking the soldier.<br>
But when "Lost in the Flood" is listened to next to "Born in the USA," 
one realizes that Springsteen's perspective hasn't changed very much. 
What has changed is the context in which his work is received. The 
veterans in the two songs could be the same man. A character who seemed 
thick-headed, if not downright dangerous, in 1973 comes across as 
sympathetic in 1984.<br>
On the cover of his new album Springsteen, dressed in red, white and 
blue, stands facing an American flag. The half-disillusioned patriotism 
that has always formed a sub-text to his work has finally emerged as a 
central theme.<br>
Springsteen grew up in the youth culture of the '60s, but he was a 
hippie by only the most general definition: He had long hair and played 
rock 'n' roll. Culturally, Springsteen seems to have had one foot in the
 teenage silent majority - the short-haired kids who went to Elvis 
movies, never touched drugs and giggled at the excesses of flower power.<br>
Springsteen may have been a bohemian, but he understood the confusion 
his blue-collar peers felt as the counter culture's values took over 
their generation. In "Incident on 57th Street" (1973) he described the 
anguish of Spanish Johnny, a streetwise young man whose old gang was 
breaking up, abandoning their ethnic and social traditions to join the 
Woodstock culture:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Those barefoot boys they left their homes for the woods<br>
Those little barefoot street boys, they said homes ain't no good<br>
They left the corner, threw away all their switchblade knives<br>
And kissed each other goodby</em><br>
<br>
Springsteen has often cast a sentimental eye on the passing of old 
values and old times. He has bid a farewell to childhood in "The Angel" 
('73) and "Used Cars" ('82). He says goodby to a childhood friend in the
 new "Bobby Jean." He even makes fun of his own sentimentality in 
another new tune, "Glory Days."<br>
The soldier in "Lost in the Flood" found all the old tenets of society -
 patriotic, social and religious - swept away by the '60s. Springsteen's
 warning that the veteran was standing in quicksand now seems less a 
chastisement than a warning. In "Hey, Santa Anna," an unrecorded song 
from the same era, Springsteen described standing by the Alamo, 
wondering that, in the post-Vietnam era, soldiers were viewed as 
cliches, even jokes:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">No more coronations<br>
Some punks idea of a teenage nation<br>
Has forced Santa Anna to change his station<br>
From soldier to cartoon</em><br>
<br>
On "My Hometown," the closing song of "Born in the USA," Springsteen 
ties his sentimentality into his bigger state of the union message. 
Inthat song a father is forced by the changing economy to abandon his 
decaying northeastern home for the Sunbelt.<br>
In New Jersey, playing to a hometown crowd, Springsteen declared, "I 
guess everybody, at some point in their lives, ends up in a love/ hate 
relationship with the town they grew up in. To admit you're a part of 
somethingmeans you're responsible for what happens to it. Well, this is 
our town, this is our state. This is our country. We all share in the 
shame and the glory of the best and the worst of it."<br>
At the show's finale he shouted to the cheering crowd, "Let freedom ring!"<br>

MUSIC REVIEW BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN AND THE E STREET BAND At: Hartford Civic Center, Sunday<br>
<br>
HARTFORD - The locomotive known as Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street 
Band is winding down its 130-date world tour. It heads to Anaheim, then 
to Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, then to 10 nights - count 'em - at New 
York's Madison Square Garden next month. That marks the official end, 
though, incredibly, the tour is still gathering steam judging from 
Sunday's sold-out stop at the Hartford Civic Center, where Springsteen 
and company were even more exciting than during their five-night sprint 
at Boston's FleetCenter last August.<br>
The difference lies in how well the rest of the band has caught up to 
Springsteen's energy. He's still in a class by himself, but saxophonist 
Clarence Clemons, especially, has stepped up from the out- of-shape, 
sweat-soaked Clemons of last summer. He hired a personal trainer on the 
road - and the results were apparent on Sunday, as he danced with 
Springsteen on several occasions - even doing some swing- dance twirls -
 and blew sax as if his life depended on it. The ease with which he 
interacted with Springsteen echoed the E Street's '80s glory days when 
"the Boss" and the "Big Man" were inseparable.<br>
Not only was the band more powerful but more subtle, too, with more 
vocal harmonies and more self-assured soloing, led by Steven Van Zandt 
and Nils Lofgren on guitars, and Roy Bittan and Danny Federici on 
keyboards. Springsteen also continues to add songs - he's now done more 
than 100 during the tour, including recent additions "Human Touch," 
"Mary Queen of Arkansas,"<br>
and "Incident on 57th Street," though just the first was played Sunday.<br>
Still, the segues were tighter and the spontaneity looser, as when 
Springsteen did some hysterically funny bump-and-grinding for the women 
in the front rows, and his wife/backup singer, Patti Scialfa, then did 
the same for the men, all seemingly unrehearsed.<br>
Springsteen said after the 2-hour-and-45-minute show that he's pleased 
with the "presentness" of the E Street Band and its willingness to 
"recommit." And while he hedged his bets on future plans, he said he 
expected to work with the band again, though he also said he has some 
acoustic songs he wants to attend to.<br>
Sunday's show smoked from the outset with "Don't Look Back," "Ties That 
Bind," and "Two Hearts," with Springsteen adding a verse from the 
R&amp;B chestnut "It Takes Two" by Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston. It was 
the first of several revuelike oldies, including Temptations hit "My 
Girl" and Al Green's "Take Me to the River," both added during "10th 
Avenue Freezeout."<br>
Also in the early going: the partying "Rendezvous" (from his boxed set 
"Tracks"), the anthemic "Promised Land," the countryish "A Mansion on 
the Hill," and the taut "Point Blank" (though mellower than his Boston 
version and featuring a soothing yodel). Then this jaw-dropping rock 
rampage: "Youngstown," "Murder, Inc." (which simply exploded), 
"Badlands," and the cocky strut of "Out in the Street."<br>
Many songs flowed together seamlessly, lending the feel of one 
continuous show. Springsteen got bawdier than usual, crouching 
suggestively on his microphone a couple of times. But he also 
intensified his political side by dedicating "No Surrender" to Lenny 
Zakim (the head of the New England office of the Anti-Defamation League,
 who died last year of cancer) and adding a verse about the 25th 
anniversary of the Vietnam War pullout during an eerie acoustic, 
blues-slide treatment of "Born in the U.S.A."<br>
The peaks continued with "Backstreets" and fixture "Light of Day," which
 ended the set, leading to encores such as "Bobbi Jean" (with another 
whomping Clemons sax solo), "Born to Run," "Growing Up," "Thunder Road,"
 "If I Should Fall Behind," and "Land of Hope and Dreams." Springsteen 
fans can only hope and dream of seeing this well- oiled band again. It 
was the comeback act of 1999 - and it's only getting better.<br>

<br>
The old ballpark opened its doors way back in 1912, but it wasn't until 
last night that it finally got, as Bruce Springsteen called it, "a good 
old rock 'n' roll baptism."<br>
And because it was such a special occasion - the first true rock concert
 in Fenway Park history - Springsteen shook the place from center field 
with a "rock 'n' roll house party, a rock 'n' roll baptism, rock 'n' 
roll bar mitzvah, a rock 'n' roll exorcism."<br>
And the fans - chanting "Bruuuuuuce," waving their arms, bowing to 
Springsteen, dancing in the aisles - nearly turned Fenway to rubble, 
going seemingly nuts when the E Street band played right next to the 
Green Monster.<br>
"What a great night, an amazing night," said Michael O'Neill of 
Sandwich. "The guy is incredible. They've got to do more shows. This 
whole thing, it's just incredible."<br>
His buddy, Dave Tamborella of Weymouth, said there was only one problem: "Nobody could slide into second base."<br>
For Boss-ton, this was about as good as it gets. The spirit of the city 
was downright dynamic last night. The Red Sox crushed the Yankees for 
the second day in a row, putting them perilously close to first place. 
The Patriots open today. And Springsteen is playing another show 
tonight.<br>
"I bet some of our predecessors are rolling around wondering what the 
heck is going on," said Red Sox president Larry Lucchino, as Springsteen
 rolled with "Promised Land."<br>
"But if they could be here, if they could sense it, if they could feel 
it, I think they would like it a lot. It's a spectacular night for this 
ballpark and this city."<br>
As Springsteen put it toward the end of the show: "There's not many 
places where you can walk into an empty place and feel the soul of the 
city, but this is one."<br>
He blessed the streets around Fenway, too.<br>
As his voice carried outside onto Yawkey way, Alice Zwicker, 53, of 
Beverly, yelled "Bruce!" with her arms waving in the air. Zwicker turned
 to two friends, Ann Theriault and Cheryl Rust, and asked, "Do you think
 he can hear me?" Rust yelled "OK, Bruce, welcome to Boston!"<br>
Perhaps the best place to hear the Boss - except for 10 rows back, 
center stage - was right behind the Green Monster on Lansdowne Street, 
where thousands of people gathered as the show began. Other fans took to
 rooftops or Fenway-area apartments for parties.<br>
At the Demeter at the Park condo complex on Brookline Avenue, parties 
were raging in several units with fans huddling around open windows and 
craning their necks to hear the Boss.<br>
"It's wild, dude, wild" said partygoer Dan Artle, 24, a customer service
 worker from Medway, as he munched on Domino's pizza. "You can really 
hear him."<br>
At one point, Springsteen acknowledged their presence: "I know you can hear us. Say hello!"<br>
Police reported few, if any, problems. And Springsteen was finished, as 
city officials asked, right around 11 p.m. He thanked officials for 
letting him play at Fenway.<br>
Baseball was not forgotten inside the ballpark. When Springsteen teased 
the crowd about the Yankees rivalry - he called them the "evil citizens"
 to the South - the crowd started chanting, "Yankees suck, Yankees 
suck."<br>
His opening number? "Take Me Out to the Ballgame."<br>
There have been plenty of magical performances in the ballpark: Carlton 
Fisk's home run - the pudgy catcher waving, waving, waving the ball into
 fair territory - in Game 6 of the 1975 World Series. Roger Clemens 
striking out 20 on a frigid day in 1986. Pedro Martinez striking out 
five of the first six batters - all likely to be elected to the Hall of 
Fame - in the 1999 All-Star Game.<br>
And Ted Williams, who returned from World War II to hit two home runs 
and two singles in the 1946 All-Star Game, slammed a home run on his 
last at-bat at Fenway. The list goes on.<br>
But live music has been heard rarely at Fenway: Ray Charles, Stevie 
Wonder, and War played the park in 1973, during the Newport Jazz 
Festival, and Smashmouth played one song during baseball's All- Star 
festivities in 1999.<br>
In row 20, center stage, Springsteen lived up to the historic calling of the night.<br>
"It gets no better than this, Bruce at Fenway Park," said Peggy Quilty 
of the Back Bay, who came with her husband and her two daughters, ages 
14 and 21. "We love Bruce. He's been amazing tonight."<br>
Her 21-year-old daughter, Laura, said: "Bruce is a total American classic. And here he is."<br>

COMMENTARY<br>
Last year, Michael Jackson.<br>
This year, Bruce Springsteen.<br>
The Boston area is the fifth-largest music market in the country, yet 
the industry's two top stars will not have played the region on their 
latest tours. It amounts to a slap in the face for pop-music lovers and 
poses serious problems for local stadium shows in the future.<br>
There's no other stadium in the nation, according to trade 
professionals, that faces such red tape as Sullivan Stadium in 
Foxborough, where town selectmen canceled Jackson's concerts last 
summer, then professed surprise when Springsteen on Monday night pulled 
out of an Aug. 29 date because he couldn't abide a town bylaw requiring a
 five-week delay before a concert permit could be issued.<br>
It was also learned yesterday that Wham!, the popular teen group that 
has been playing stadium dates on the West Coast, was eyeing Foxborough 
for September but passed upon learning of the bureaucratic struggles 
that lay ahead, a source close to the band said.<br>
"I would have to feel that under the present conditions that more groups
 would have to start thinking that way," Micael Chamberlain, a spokesman
 for Stadium Management Corp., which operates Sullivan Stadium, said 
yesterday.<br>
All of which leaves local consumers shut out of super-scale shows. The 
tragedy is that those who are losing are not the bedraggled, glassy-eyed
 weirdos thought by doubting Toms to form "the rock crowd." In Jackson's
 case, it was families with young children. In Wham!'s case, it's mostly
 young, fashionable girls. And in Springsteen's case, it's the cream of 
thecollege crowd on up to Route 128 computer executives, office 
managers, stable suburbanites and numerous over-30s who have the money 
to pay exorbitant scalpers' fees.<br>
In the wake of Springsteen's pull-out, many of the principals involved 
were in hiding yesterday. Springsteen's manager was unavailable, as were
 his New York booking agents. Neil Jacobsen of Boston's Tea Party 
Concerts, which was to promote the Aug. 29 date, answered his phone but 
only to say, "I don't understand the thought processes of the Town of 
Foxborough selectmen. This is something they have to live with."<br>
"It's a major loss," added Frank Russo, the Providence promoter who 
first hoped to bring the Jacksons in and also recently bid on 
Springsteen. "For any bureaucratic situation to offset a history- making
 engagement such as this, is a shame."<br>
Where to go from here? Observers have wondered whether Sullivan Stadium 
might test the Foxborough bylaw in court, claiming it is too harsh a 
regulation on a private business. Chamberlain said yesterday, however: 
"We're going to wait and see what will happen. There are no plans to say
 or do anything. At some point we'll get involved, but we haven't played
 that card yet."<br>
The stadium, of course, has to live with the town, so such a divisive step is unlikely.<br>
Another gloomy prospect is the selectmen's avowed opposition to two-date
 concerts. There are only a few stars who could play two shows - 
Springsteen, the Jacksons and the Rolling Stones come to mind - but with
 the enormous expenses of their tours they're even more likely to take 
their acts elsewhere now rather than play only one engagement.<br>
As for Springsteen, the logic behind his cancellation is not hard to 
fathom. He has a trouble-free concert record, has become the darling of 
the industry and hardly wanted the blemish of being "banned in 
Foxborough" the day before his show.<br>
Ironically, though, his good sense to wait to announce his tour until 
after July 13's Live Aid concert - so as not to upstage the event - only
 put Sullivan Stadium further behind the eight-ball in dealing with the 
Foxborough bylaw. That, however, is the nature of the music business. It
 is a hectic, last-minute world, fundamentally different from the 
snail-like pace of small- town politics.<br>
Coupled with the embarrassing lack of Boston Garden shows these days, 
the Foxborough fiasco only further suggests that the gap between music 
and politics is widening rather than being healed.<br>

WORCESTER - The bumper sticker on the back of the van in the middle of 
the city yesterday afternoon said it all -- "This is Boss country."<br>
Bruce Springsteen and his E Street Band descended onto central 
Massachusetts last night and the most often-heard question around the 
Centrum arena was, "Tickets for the Boss?"<br>
The words were uttered by those selling tickets and those desperately 
seeking seats who were part of the excited crowd awaiting the arrival of
 Springsteen for his group's first concert in nearly three years.<br>
A Springsteen concert is not simply another rock show. It is an event. 
"No one else who comes here creates this much excitement, this much 
hoopla," said Linda Holstrom, who works at a clothing store in the 
shadows of the Centrum. "He's definitely the hottest ticket in town."<br>
Throughout the afternoon, preparations for last night's opening show of 
Springsteen's "Tunnel of Love" tour were being made. The scalpers kept 
one eye out for prospective customers and another eye out for police -- 
uniform and undercover.<br>
Those without a ticket were debating how much they were willing to pay. 
"Money is no object," said Bill McKay, who drove five hours from 
Freehold, N.J., just for the chance to see Bruce. Springsteen was born 
and raised and Freehold.<br>
"I'm willing to go about $200 but I want to get the best seat possible. 
He's a fellow hometown boy. Of course, I'd pay that much to see him."<br>
About two hours before the show, scalpers were asking $150 to $250 per 
ticket. The price among some ticket hawkers dropped to about $100 as the
 7:30 p.m. start drew near.<br>
Springsteen attracts one of the most loyal followings of any rock star. 
Fans like Steve Ticks, 28, who flew into Worcester from Los Angeles 
yesterday afternoon. And he did not even have a ticket.<br>
"I'll go anywhere to see the Boss," Ticks said as he added that he has 
been to 147 Springsteen shows. "I've seen him in Tokyo, Ireland and all 
over the United States."<br>
Ticks said he can afford to track Springsteen around the world by using 
his savings. "Bruce is the only thing I spend money on," said Ticks, who
 slightly resembles Springsteen. "And the only time I take a vacation is
 when Bruce tours."<br>
Ticks said he was turned on to Springsteen when he was only 14 years old
 and his brother played with Springsteen at the Stone Pony in Asbury 
Park, N.J., one of the clubs at which Springsteen got his start. 
"Because I was only a kid they would let me hang around and watch Bruce.
 This was before he became so big."<br>
And despite his rise to stardom, Springsteen in the eyes of his most 
fervent fans has not changed. His eloquent commentary on the hopes and 
struggles of blue-collar and middle-class America have remained at the 
core of his nine albums.<br>
Debbie Slaughter, a 33-year-old fan who recently moved to Boston from 
Dallas, said, "He hasn't sold out. He has remained true to his music and
 most importantly to himself."<br>
Slaughter, who was about to see her third Springsteen show, said she did
 not become a true fan until about four years ago. "He doesn't touch 
people in Texas the way he does up here," she said.<br>
"I hadn't heard much about him. I mean until just a couple of years ago,
 Texas was enjoying real affluence. No one was interested in listening 
to the things Bruce sings about. About the people who have been left out
 or left behind. Up here it's different."<br>
As for why she arrived at the show five hours early, Slaughter said, "I 
wanted to come and scout out the scene. I got the day off so I wanted to
 come early and start getting excited. I like building up the show."<br>
Slaughter also came to the show alone. "A Bruce concert is personal 
between me and him. I don't want to have anyone yelling in my ear."<br>
Ticks, who was seen walking around the Centrum several times looking for
 tickets, said, "Bruce sings about all the things I feel."<br>
Ticks met and talked with Springsteen during a concert in Arizona in 
1980 -- the year Ticks' mother died. "When I met him I told him his 
music changed my life, and then he asked me how," Ticks recalled.<br>
"I was floored when he asked that. I said that you can't follow and 
listen to someone for so long without it having an impact. He thanked me
 and then he said in that great voice of his, 'Keep the faith.' That 
really helped me get through my mom's death. He is a great and decent 
man."<br>
While most of the early arrivals at the Centrum yesterday where those 
without tickets, Brian Chamberlain, 28, and his brother Edward, 30, of 
Rhode Island, who arrived in downtown Worcester at about 3:30 p.m., 
didn't have to worry about getting into the show. "My girlfriend got us 
tickets in New York," said Edward Chamberlain. "She didn't even have to 
wait all that long."<br>
Ben Gallagher and John Bristol, both 21 of East Greenwich, Conn., didn't
 have tickets but came loaded with large bills. After making several 
attempts they landed two tickets for $300.<br>
"What's 300 bucks?" said Bristol as a happy smile crossed his face. "A couple of days' work to see Bruce. It's a fair deal."<br>
Perhaps Springsteen's most faithful fans are those from the New Jersey 
shore, where he grew up and from where the inspiration for much of his 
music comes.<br>
William Smith and Stephen Bumball have a special affection for 
Springsteen. They own and operate the Asbury Park Rock 'n' Roll Museum.<br>
The museum, they said, contains memorabilia that spans Springsteen's 
career and contains items such as rare photos, Springsteen's high school
 yearbook and the guitar Springsteen used in his high school band, "The 
Castiles."<br>
"For me, Bruce's music is very personal," Bumball said. "He's singing 
about places and things I can relate to very easily. He's singing from 
our perspective. He's another Jersey Shore kid just like me."<br>
Smith said Springsteen visited the museum last year and gave it his blessing. "He loved it. He didn't want to leave."<br>
Shortly before the ticketholders stormed in, Ticks was getting closer to
 securing a ticket. "Don't worry," he said. "You'll see me in there."<br>

<strong class="text-strong">LIFE BEYOND SPRINGSTEEN With his soulful new album and solo career, it's time to call Nils Lofgren his own Boss<br>
<br>
Boston Globe <br>
<br>

MUSIC SECTION<br>
Nils Lofgren isn't waiting around for Bruce Springsteen to call. 
Although he played guitar on the last glory day tours with Springsteen's
 E Street Band, Lofgren has resumed his solo career while Bruce fishes 
for a new direction and raises his infant son, Evan James, in Los 
Angeles.<br>
Lofgren's new album "Silver Lining," which comes out today on Salem's 
Rykodisc label, has guest shots from Springsteen, Ringo Starr, Clarence 
Clemmons, Levon Helm and Billy Preston, but for the most part it is pure
 Lofgren -- zesty, melodic rock 'n' roll with plenty to say.<br>
"Although there are some soulful touches from friends, we wanted to make
 this a Nils Lofgren record, not a `Nils Lofgren &amp; Friends' record,"
 Lofgren said from his Los Angeles home yesterday. "And we wanted to 
make it as live and raw as we could. We avoided going back into the 
studio to fix up the rough edges. That just makes it smoother and 
poppier. That's not what I wanted. We just tried to rely on our 
instincts this time."<br>
Lofgren has toured with either Springsteen, Neil Young (playing on 
Young's "Tonight's the Night" and "Trans" tours), Ringo Starr (as part 
of Ringo's All-Stars last year) or with his own groups for the last 20 
years. That spontaneous concert feel is indeed captured on the highly 
impressive "Silver Lining," which bristles with staunch guitar rock.<br>
"I've noticed when I play live, even with the mistakes and the 
out-of-tune notes, there's an emotional honesty that isn't there when 
you go back in the studio to make things more technically correct, which
 I've done on some of my other records," said Lofgren.<br>
The album's most laid-back song is the ballad "Valentine," which has 
Springsteen on backup vocals ("He was very gracious to come down and do 
that") and stars Springsteen and Starr in a new video to be released 
this Monday. The song was written as a tribute to Lofgren's wife, Cis 
Randall, an actress who now plays the role of a policewoman on the TV 
show "Hunter."<br>
While Lofgren has moved beyond Springsteen for the moment, he still says
 it's possible the E Street Band may be revived in the future.<br>
"Bruce never shut the door on the E Street Band. The press did that for 
him," said Lofgren. "No one knows in the future what will happen. But I 
guess the real story wasn't exciting enough for the press. The real 
story is that Bruce had been one of the only solo artists who had kept a
 band and not played with other people. So it was time for him to do 
that. He also has a beautiful new son, Evan, and he's digging him.<br>
"The rest is open to debate. But I've heard some of Bruce's new album 
and it's great. I love Bruce. I'm behind him 1,000 percent."<br>
Lofgren, who plans to hit Boston this spring with his own band (possibly
 with E Street drummer Max Weinberg), is quick to cite Springsteen and 
Young as influences on his present sound. "By working with Neil, I've 
seen him switch from lyrical to hard-edged, nasty playing, but always 
with melody. And Bruce is the same way. Even if he's belting out, it 
still has melody. And that's what I've tried to do."<br>
Lofgren first met Young at the Cellar Door club in Washington back in 
the late '60s. Only 17 at the time, Lofgren fronted a band called Grin 
and was desperately seeking entry into the music business. "Neil gave me
 a guitar and said, `Play me something.' I guess he liked what he heard,
 because when we got out to Los Angeles he turned me on to his producer,
 David Briggs. Neil then asked me to play piano on his `After the Gold 
Rush' album. I knew how from playing accordion for 10 years."<br>
Lofgren released three albums with Grin, then six solo albums -- the 
last being 1981. He was recently coaxed back into circulation by 
Rykodisc, the feisty independent that's scored with reissues of David 
Bowie, Jimi Hendrix and Frank Zappa -- and is starting to beef up its 
new-music offerings.<br>
"My solo career has been a roller coaster," Lofgren admitted. "But 
Rykodisc said, `Look, we want you to make an honest Nils Lofgren 
record,' and I responded to that. All the other companies said, `Give us
 a hit single or we're not interested.' "<br>
Lofgren may still get a hit single with the Springsteen duet 
"Valentine," but the bulk of the album is confident, driving rock 'n' 
roll: Witness such tracks as the funky "Walkin' Nerve," the metallic 
"Sticks and Stones" (building like Dire Straits' "Telegraph Road") and 
the swampy "Gun and Run."<br>
"I've finally realized I'm a blues guitarist at heart. I always wanted 
to sing like Muddy Waters or Howling Wolf, but my voice was never that 
heavy. So the nasty, raw things I feel are expressed through the guitar.
 And there's a lot of guitar on the record. If we were cooking at the 
end of a song, we decided to just leave it on there instead of taking it
 out. The public can fade it out if it wants, but that's up to them."<br>

MUSIC REVIEW Bruce Springsteen At: the Orpheum, last night<br>
Bruce Springsteen's new album, "Devils and Dust," has less of everything
 his fans relish most: anthems and energy. But it was exactly the 
absence of those familiar triggers that allowed the musician, whose 
sold-out show at the Orpheum last night was part of a solo acoustic 
tour, to offer something other than fist-pumping sing-alongs and 
screaming saxophone solos: a piece of himself.<br>
Springsteen's intimate two-plus-hour set was filled with anecdotes and 
memories, reflections on the mysteries of parenting and songwriting, and
 more than a few political comments one in particular involving a 
certain windsurfing incident in honor of audience member John Kerry, 
whose entrance earned the evening's first standing ovation. But the 
music (a thoughtful, seasoned blend of new and vintage) and the man 
(about whom one could say the same thing) were, as ever, closely twined.
 At his best Springsteen puts a human face on distant, difficult tales, 
and in this stripped-down setting the connection between story and 
storyteller was brought into bold relief.<br>
Having children, and experiencing the primal urge to protect them, 
inspired him to investigate the idea that Jesus was "somebody's boy," 
Springsteen explained before playing "Jesus Was an Only Son." Parenting 
was a recurring theme during the concert, and it is on the new album as 
well. "Long Time Coming," an exuberant, hopeful tune, followed a 
discussion about trying to get things right that your parents got wrong,
 and "Black Cowboys" explored the fallout of severed bonds between 
mother and son.<br>
Without the E Street Band in tow, Springsteen's dynamic range was 
limited, and yet he mustered impressive spirit, both mournful and 
jubilant. The set began starkly with Springsteen at the harmonium 
singing "My Beautiful Reward" while two video screens showed black and 
white images of his feet pumping the churchlike bellows. Next came a 
rough, unintelligible take on "Reason to Believe," during which 
Springsteen stomped on a wooden board and played distorted harmonica, 
and "Devils and Dust," where he fully and fearsomely inhabited the heart
 and mind of a soldier in Iraq.<br>
At that point "Lonesome Day" arrived like a breath of air, as did a lush
 piano version of "The River," which he introduced as a "hidden love 
song" from his catalog. A riveting one-man reworking of "The Rising," as
 well as a scorching "Further On (Up the Road)" and grit-filled "Real 
World" revealed an artist who has no need for a large, loud band to help
 him find boldness and backbone.<br>
Springsteen is one of the few artists who could successfully program a 
set to feature "Part Man, Part Monkey" (complete with scathing 
explication of the current debate about evolution and creationism) back 
to back with "All the Way Home," a hip-swiveling ode to second chances, 
and then segue into "Reno," a sexually explicit ballad about a 
heartbroken john and his hooker. The so- called two Springsteens, one 
folkie and one rocker, are in fact two points on a continuum whose span 
was on gratifying display last night.<br>

Any rock fan with an FM radio on last fall heard songs from the new 
Bruce Springsteen album, "Nebraska." It was Springsteen's first album 
without backing from his group, the E Street Band, and the highly 
anticipated record took off in a flash.<br>
You probably haven't heard any of those songs recently. Airplay on the 
album - a critical favorite which made numerous year-end Top 10 lists - 
has pretty much petered out. And if it weren't for his stature - 
Springsteen is arguably America's most popular singer and songwriter - 
chances are excellent you wouldn't have heard the record at all.<br>
The key to an album's success rests very much with FM rock radio 
airplay. The "Nebraska" situation - its immediate embrace and then its 
relatively quick fade - calls into question radio's role. What posture 
does radio take in relation to music that may be worthy and innovative, 
but does not accede to conventional, commercial rock standards? Can 
vital music with rough edges gain a place in a radio world resistant to 
noncomformity? Did Springsteen succeed, albeit in a limited fashion, 
only because of his track record?<br>
Recorded on a relatively unsophisticated 4-track recorder, "Nebraska" 
was a sharp departure from Springsteen's usual sound and style. 
Springsteen is known for his spirited songs of adventure and hope: Think
 of "Born to Run," his 1975 breakthrough song and album: Cruising down 
highways and backstreets searching for "the runaway American dream" as 
shimmering electric guitar chords reverberated behind him. He often 
found redemption - either on the road or in the power of love. He 
offered dreams that were worth clinging onto and the E Street Band 
backed those sentiments with melodic muscle.<br>
Springsteen took a different road on "Nebraska," a road he began to 
travel on his two previous albums, "Darkness on the Edge of Town" and 
"The River." There he started to discover a darker side to the dreams. 
Lives started to become claustrophobic or tear apart at the seams. 
Springsteen could still drive to "Cadillac Ranch," dance the night away 
with "Sherry Darling," or declare love in "Two Hearts." But more and 
more he seemed to be saying that those were just escape clauses. 
Sometimes those streets turned mean.<br>
On "Nebraska" the streets turned not only mean, but desolate. The bleak 
stories unfold one after another - drunken tragedy, unemployment, bad 
luck, cold factories, final prayers - and late- night drives that lead 
not to adventure, but to nowhere fast. The plea made in "Open All Night"
 - "rock 'n' roll, deliver me from nowhere" - is never answered. 
"Nebraska" is a very lonely record.<br>
"Nebraska" has done well in the marketplace, selling over 800,000 
copies. Columbia Records, reportedly worried at first, expects it to 
have no trouble going platinum (selling a million copies).<br>
There haven't been many "rock" records like "Nebraska." Its closest 
cousin is Neil Young's "Tonight's the Night," a downbeat, edgy record 
that followed his biggest hit "Harvest."<br>
On "Nebraska" Springsteen employed voice, simple acoustic guitar, 
harmonica and a bit of spare synthesizer, taking the road Bob Dylan and 
Hank Williams had taken many years before. It's heartfelt and moving, 
but there's little relief from the grim, melancholic tone.<br>
This is not the stuff radio hits are made of these days; it can be the stuff of excellent, demanding music.<br>
Springsteen had his reputation working overwhelmingly in his favor. 
"You're listening to it and you know you're listening to Bruce 
Springsteen," says Columbia Records senior vice president, Al Teller. 
"You candraw on his background as an artist of great honesty and 
sincerity." Still, the sound was rough and ragged, flat and 
underproduced by contemporary standards.<br>
Imagine the predicament of radio program directors: An artist as popular
 as anyone with an album as unconventional as anything on the market. Do
 we take the chance?<br>
American radio said yes - up to a point.<br>
"As concerned as the label seemed to be before the fact," says Bill 
Hard, editor of the respected FM radio journal Friday Morning 
Quarterback, "it got a lot of airplay. It was a personal favorite of a 
lot of programmers. It was quickly added and the initial audience 
response was very positive."<br>
But Hard says "Nebraska" didn't have a long radio shelf life. "On 
intensity, I'd rate it an A minus," says Hard. "On duration, a C minus. 
It didn't have enough song depth for album stations. It was too 
down-tempo."<br>
On the average Hard says the album was played about seven weeks. 
Satisfactory, but hardly ranking with other popular releases such as the
 Clash's "Combat Rock" and Men at Work's self-titled debut (27 weeks), A
 Flock of Seagulls debut (31 weeks) or, somewhat ironically, "American 
Fool," the breakthrough album by Springsteen sound-alike John Cougar (33
 weeks).<br>
Still, it made a dent - this personal, acoustic record made in a high- tech, electronic age.<br>
Could the Springsteen record signal a breakthrough, open up the doors 
for more risky records? Or, put another way, if "Nebraska" had come 
across a program director's desk without Bruce Springsteen's name on it,
 would it have stood a chance?<br>
"Forget it," says Hard. "I can guarantee that."<br>
"Probably not," says Andy Beaubien, program director of Boston's 
WCOZ-FM. "I don't think we would have paid much attention to it."<br>
"Someone else would not get any attention at all," agrees Oedipus, 
program director for the competing WBCN-FM. "The demand is just not 
there. Personal, introspective albums are nice, but (the artist* has 
really got to be saying something, or you've got to know who the artist 
is."<br>
Hard suggests "Nebraska" presented many programmers with an opportunity 
to freshen up their staid hard-rock sound. Yet, he says candidly, "It 
was a chance to step away from the standard format, but to do it 
safely." In many markets, Hard says, programmers would congratulate 
themselves on taking a "risk."<br>
Boston, however, is a different situation. "Boston's always been a 
musically active market," Hard states. "In Boston it's not quite as big a
 deal."<br>
Indeed, WBCN and WCOZ, Boston's main album rock stations, jumped on the 
record immediately. WBCN's Oedipus says he saw it mainly as a 
Springsteen- without-the-backup-band album, not that far removed from 
"The River." "It's not particularly radical," Oedipus says. "He could 
have gone even further."<br>
But, in line with the national reaction, neither station stayed with the
 record very long. WCOZ played it heavily for two or three weeks, says 
Beaubien, before airplay dropped off. WBCN went longer, about seven 
weeks, before airplay waned.<br>
"I love the album personally," says Beaubien. "I was listening to it at 
home the other day and I like it more and more every time I hear it. 
(But* it clashes with a lot of the stuff on radio. It doesn't fit well."<br>
Oedipus: "Only somebody like Bruce Springsteen could get away with that."<br>
Beaubien: "He knew he could get away with it, and I'm glad he did it."<br>
Valid points. But the larger issue deals not so much with acoustic music
 in hard-rock formats, but, simply, with different music in conservative
 radio formats. Although slight changes are occurring - more new, 
provocative music is getting played now than it was a year ago - radio 
is far more prone to play reliable, formulaic rock than innovative new 
music. "It's a fact of life," says Columbia's Teller. "The mechanism is 
axiomatically slow to change."<br>
And so, for the most part, the shackles on rock 'n' roll's growth 
remain. The constraints on the term "popular music" are intact.<br>
This question hangs: If a new Bob Dylan did come along - an artist who 
was socially stirring and musically stimulating, but different sounding -
 would you hear him on the airwaves?<br>

<strong class="text-strong">NEW LIVE SET FROM BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN<br>
<br>

It came as a shock when Bruce Springsteen, during a concert radio 
broadcast from Stockholm on July 3, declared his involvement with the 
Amnesty International tour. His short speech, followed by a moving 
version of Bob Dylan's "Chimes of Freedom," are the focal point of a 
four-song live set released yesterday.<br>
Entitled "Chimes of Freedom" (Columbia Records) and released in 
multi-formats of vinyl, tape and CD, the Springsteen package is an 
eloquent scene-setter for the Amnesty tour. It's a practical 
scene-setter as well, for some of the proceeds will benefit Amnesty, 
which has booked Springsteen, Sting, Peter Gabriel, Tracy Chapman and 
Youssou N'dour into six continents in the next six weeks.<br>
The Springsteen speech pays tribute to the 40th anniversary of the 
Declaration of Human Rights, which is sanctioned by the United Nations. 
His point is hammered home in "Chimes of Freedom," a song as relevant 
today as when Dylan wrote it in 1964. The song stems from a dreamlike 
thunder-and-lightning storm in which Dylan imagines bells tolling "for 
the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse/<br>
An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe." Springsteen 
does it justice with a worldly wise treatment that rises in passion as 
it sweeps through its seven-minutes-plus length.<br>
The other three tracks are from his recent "Tunnel of Love" tour. 
They're like a condensed, miniversion of the tour, covering the new, 
country-style song "Tougher Than the Rest" (the tour was filled with new
 material); a rollicking B-side "Be True" (the tour was filled with 
surprise B-sides); and a stately acoustic version of "Born to Run," in 
keeping with the tour's theme of how much Springsteen has changed from 
his mid-'70s party day<br>

NOT SEEING BRUCE<br>

I feel I must add my voice to the mounting hysteria that surrounds Bruce Springsteen's four-month concert tour of America.<br>
I have been reading the febrile testimonies of those who saw him once 
across a crowded room in Teaneck, who have thrown themselves upon 
concert stages to touch the hem of his garment, who have been rendered 
speechless in his divine presence. It occurs to me that I am one among a
 small and ever-shrinking minority of people who have never met The 
Boss, who have never even seen him in person, whose lives, in fact, 
might be said to be defined by our lack of contact with Bruce 
Springsteen.<br>
How well I remember the first time I didn't see Bruce. It was 1973, and 
he was playing a small club in Boston. Some friends were going to see 
him and asked me to come along, but I decided to stay home and wash my 
hair instead.<br>
Looking back, I see it was a decision that has shaped the course of my 
life, but, incredibly, it didn't seem all that important at the time. 
The following day one of my friends called and said, "I have just seen 
the future of rock 'n' roll, a totally brilliant, unique, 
soon-to-be-giant artist who will transform the face of popular music as 
we know it, a man who just might be the next Mick Jagger."<br>
I had seen the first Mick Jagger and, frankly, couldn't see the need for
 another one. But this was not the last I was to hear of the man who has
 been called a legend in his own time, a charismatic genius, a musical 
evangelist of The American Way, etc.<br>
It wasn't long before I didn't see Bruce again. It was 1974, and this 
time he was in Boston playing a large concert hall. Even then, people 
were clamoring for tickets. I would have clamored, too, if I'd known 
then what I know now, but that's hindsight for you.<br>
My friend attended the concert and called me the next day with a report.
 "Forget what I said about Bruce being the next Mick Jagger," she said. 
"He is the rock messiah."<br>
Naturally I felt that I must see him or die in the attempt. But it was 
not to be. My hopes rose, briefly, in late 1977, when a man I was 
involved with told me he had tickets to see The Great One. Imagine my 
disappointment when The Great One turned out to be Barry Manilow, not 
Bruce. The years flew by and not once did I ever see Bruce. I sure heard
 about him a lot, though, and once, in Los Angeles, I ate in a FatBurger
 he'd eaten in only the week before. So near and yet so far!<br>
In 1985, when he made his last big tour, tickets were impossible to come
 by. There was even a rumor that Bruce was having trouble getting 
tickets to see himself, that's how popular he'd become.<br>
A local radio station was awarding tickets to people with the most 
heart-wrenching stories. The competition was keen. People were 
presenting notarized proof of terminal illness, others were willing to 
hand over their children in exchange for a pair of tickets to see Bruce.
 Who would blame them?<br>
I felt my story was as sad as anyone's. I had never seen Bruce in 
person, I had never seen him perform. My obsession dated back a dozen 
years. But there were even more pathetic stories. I lost to another 
woman who'd been not seeing him since 1969, when she just missed him 
performing on a flatbed truck in Wheeling, W. Va.<br>
Looking back, I can see that not seeing Bruce is probably the great 
tragedy of my life. But I will just have to accept it. There are moments
 when it's not easy. This morning, for example, I turned on the radio 
and heard a report on last night's concert in Worcester. A fan screamed,
 "Bruce is God! Bruce is God!"<br>
It caused me to reflect that perhaps my fate is to be a rock 'n' roll 
martyr, never to see Bruce, never to meet him, but to demonstrate my 
faith by accepting the testimony of those who have.<br>

<strong class="text-strong">REVIEW / MOVIE; ; SPRINGSTEEN ANNIHILATES NO NUKES'<br>
Boston Globe <br>
Boston, Mass.<br>
Author:	Bruce McCabe Globe Staff<br>

<br>
A concert film on behalf of the anti-nuclear energy movement, starring Jackson<br>
Browne, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, the Doobie Brothers, John Hall, Bonnie Raitt,<br>
Gil Scott-Heron, Carly Simon, Bruce Springsteen, James Taylor, Jesse Colin<br>
Young and others. At the Exeter Street Theater. Rated PG.<br>
If "No Nukes" were as good as its climax - a devastating performance by<br>
Bruce Springsteen - it might be memorable.<br>
As it is, it's an uneven sub-genre, what might be called the political 
concert film. It's an edited version of the five anti- nuclear energy 
concerts that were staged last September in New York. The concerts 
concluded with an outdoor rally at Battery Park that drew over 250,000, 
what the filmmakers describe as the largest anti- nuclear energy rally 
to date.<br>
The film concludes with the cameras panning the monstrous crowd at 
Battery Park. That shot is more powerful than any other statement in the
 film about nuclear power.<br>
But "No Nukes" must stand and fall on its status as a concert film. The 
problem lies in the performances. Some of the performers, like 
Springsteen and Jackson Browne, were obviously energized for their 
feature film debuts. In fact, "No Nukes" is moribund for the opening 20 
minutes until Browne launches into "Running On Empty," one of the better
 metaphorical rock numbers of the age.<br>
It is Springsteen's performance, however, that blows the film apart. He 
appears to feverish chants of "Bruce," "Bruce," "Bruce" - and proceeds 
to outstrip every other performer. Looking like the urban back street's 
answer to Elvis Presley, stalking the stage like a twitchy panther, 
moaning hoarsely and staring sullenly at his worshippers, Springsteen, 
accompanied by the E Street Band, flogs himself through "The River," a 
new song, and the familiar "Thunder Road" and "Quarter To Three."<br>
"I'm 30 years old," he gasps, upon collapsing and being helped to his 
feet. "My heart's starting to go on me . . . I can't . . . I can't . . .
 "<br>
He raises a feeble hand, presumably to still the howling mob before him.
 His fatigue transforms itself into a malignant narcissism.<br>
"I don't want you to beg," he smiles, the screams pouring over him like 
molten lava. "I'm just a prisoner of rock 'n' roll." As it happens, 
Springsteen's bravado is quite in keeping with the spirit of the film's 
chauvinism. Most of the female performances seem to have wound up on the
 cutting room floor. Perhaps the next concert film could support women's
 liberation.<br>

REVIEW MUSIC BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN - In concert at the Providence Civic Center last night.<br>
The signs of fanaticism weren't hard to spot. There was the black sports
 car with the New York license plate, "Bruuuuce." And the delirious guys
 in the back of the stage with the huge unfurled banner, "On the 8th day
 God created Bruce."<br>
Yes, this was a true meeting of the clan, the society of Bruce 
Springsteen worshippers who fought tooth and nail to get a ticket and 
were losing their collective sanity for the night.<br>
The day was straight out of the Twilight Zone - 11 arrests for scalping 
composed the legal statistics, while the media went totally bonkers, 
including one hapless reporter for KISS-108 who was reduced to 
interviewing a hotel worker to discover that Springsteen ate 
strawberries in the afternoon and that several band members ate 
croissants.<br>
"What was on the croissants?" she asked. "Jam, I guess," the stunned employee answered.<br>
Springsteen's response to all of this was business as usual. And for 
Springsteen, that business is pure, nose-to-the-grindstone rock 'n' 
roll, delivered with dripping sweat pouring out of his blues workshirt 
with rolled- up sleeves framing newly thickened biceps that aren't to be
 messed with.<br>
It was no wonder that he said to ear-shattering acclaim, "Man, I hated 
high school! I'm so glad that when 8 o'clock comes around at night, I 
get to rock rather than do my homework!"<br>
And rock he did, especially after a surprisingly pensive first set full 
of down-tempo tristesse, ballads and chilling stories in which he 
discussed social commitment: "When you say 'I'm an American,' that means
 you have a responsibility about that. And there are a lot of things to 
be proud of in this country and a lot of things to be ashamed of. It's 
the things to be ashamed of that we've got to work on."<br>
With that he announced that the audience should go to tables in the 
lobby and make donations to the Rhode Island Community Food Bank. It was
 only fitting, too, that this was a lead-in to the reflective "My 
Hometown," a song of working-class survival.<br>
Springsteen had opened up at full-throttle with the slashing "Born in 
the USA" as sound from an elephantine layout of 72 speakers detonated 
through the hall, and tiny guitarist Nils Lofgren pranced about in Kevin
 McHale's No. 32 Celtics T-shirt, which hung to his knees.<br>
"We're in the middle of a road trip," Springsteen said, blasting through
 the cocky come-on of "Meet Me in the Street" and the travelling tune, 
"Darlington County," in which the muscular tank- topped Clarence Clemons
 finished with a honking sax solo and a gentlemanly drop to one knee.<br>
But then Springsteen struck an introspective mood, challenging the crowd
 on the acoustic "Johnny 99" (about a laid-off auto plant worker who 
goes berserk and kills someone), "Atlantic City" (a spiritualized ballad
 about rebirth) and two new unrecorded songs, "Shut Out the Light" (a 
ballad about a scarred Vietnam veteran) and "Bye Bye Johnny," which 
began with an autobiographical story about Springsteen's only visit to 
Presley's Graceland mansion in Memphis and how he vaulted the metal 
gates to see if he could meet him.<br>
"Now I consider it a stupid thing to have done because I know I hate it 
when people do it at my house," he confessed before ending the song with
 a hoarse, haunting verse from Elvis' epic "Mystery Train."<br>
Springsteen was much more extroverted in his second set, coming out in 
his own bulging tank top and ripping through "Thunder Road," the 
sing-along "Cadillac Ranch" (as he lifted his arms and shouted "How 
sweet it is!" to the crowd's Super Bowl-sized applause) and the crisp 
"Dancing in the Dark," in which, per custom, he pulled up a female from 
the front seats and they danced like lost loves.<br>
"Bobbie Jean," a ferocious "Born to Run" (with a "C.C. Ryder" climax), 
Creedence's "Travelling Man" and the perennial "Devil with a BlueDress" 
medley stoked the fires further.<br>
The pace at this point was straight, gravity-defying overdrive. Lumped 
into the stew were golden oldies "I Can't Help Falling in Love With You 
Again" (another dip into the Presley songbook), "Twist and Shout" (The 
Isley Brothers soul-dancing standard) and the Dave Clark Five's ageless 
teen hit, "Do You Love Me," which segued back into "Twist and Shout" and
 took a few brain cells with it.<br>
The night's clannish fanaticism finally drew to an over-the-top close 
with the appropriate "I'm Just a Prisoner of Rock 'n' Roll" and a 
feverish "Ramrod."<br>
Yet Springsteen was still, somehow, able to salt the finale with 
philosophy. Summing up his view of music as a healing grace, he noted 
dramatically, "A lot of the power of rock 'n' roll came from feeling 
friendship and community. Nobody wins unless everybody wins."<br>
Enough said. So much for this meeting of the Springsteen Society, New England Chapter. It was a beauty.<br>

<strong class="text-strong">SOUND; ; HIS RIVER OF TALENT ROLLS ON<br>
<br>
Boston Globe (- Boston, Mass.<br>
Author:	Morse, Steve<br>
Date:	Oct 23, 1980</strong><br>
<br>
You keep wondering if Bruce Springsteen is going to waver, to slip out of<br>
control, to become jaded. You keep wondering if his creative well is going to<br>
run dry, his energy is going to slow down. And, once again, your 
wondering isneedless, because his new double-record set, "The River," is
 nothing less than<br>
his foremost career achievement. It is a remarkable distillation of the past<br>
30 years of American pop music - from the dance mania of rockabilly to the<br>
soul of R&amp;B; from the pathos of country to the electric stomp of modern rock<br>
'n' roll.<br>
Springsteen has his detractors - those who pigeonhole him for having<br>
written too much about cars and rebel-without-a-cause Sad Sacks - but on
 this new release he widens his scope as never before. He still hovers 
around<br>
bottled-up, working-class frustrations for his primary themes, but he also<br>
takes us on a twisting psychological journey, confronting us about our values,<br>
our relationships, our fantasies and our fears of being alone, anonymous and<br>
unloved. It is an excursion at once visually and poetically immediate, but<br>
with offshoots that linger deep in the subconscious.<br>
Springsteen's last album, "Darkness on the Edge of Town," was a 
brooding, surprisingly downbeat (for him) search for solace and purpose.
 Since then we've waited 2 1/2 years for this new release, but it 
manages to uncannily merge the conflicting poles of his personality - 
the introspection of "Darkness" and the break-out euphoria of 1975's 
"Born to Run" LP.<br>
This 20-song double-disk - which has been held up for months due to 
Springsteen's customarily fussy perfectionism - starts off with a heady 
dose of party-rock. "The Ties That Band" sets a Tom Petty/ Roger McGuinn
 pace; "Sherry Darling" is a frolicsome lecture about a lover's nosy 
mother (complete with background party noises like Dylan's "Rainy Day 
Women 12 &amp; 35"); "Jackson Cage" is a wailing, backbeat-driven rocker
 about fighting claustrophobic lifestyles; and "Two Hearts" is a 
high-energy kicker where Springsteen the eternal romantic takes his bow:
 "Alone buddy there ain't no peace of mind/ That's why I'll keep 
searching till I find my special one."<br>
Less a storyteller this time than a mood-setter, Springsteen then offers
 the emotionally bracing "Independence Day," a ballad about a son's 
leaving home and father behind. Eloquent piano fills from Roy Bittan, 
and a church- organ style lament from Danny Federici of the E Street 
Band, complete the setting. This is but the first of many extraordinary 
ballads that include the Eric Burdon-like "Fade Away" (about getting 
rejected by your lover and pleading "I don't wanna fade away . . . I 
don't wanna be just another useless memory"); the sparsely textured 
"Stolen Car" (a heartrending look at lost love and the creeping 
anonymity that follows - "But I ride by night and I travel in fear/That 
in this darkness I will disappear"); and a treatise on the healing power
 of love, "Drive All Night" (with a sublime vocal recitation Otis 
Redding would be proud of).<br>
Another pair of ballads shows Springsteen's awareness of country music 
subjects. The disarming title cut, "The River" (which he sang in the "No
 Nukes" concert film), talks of going to a river as an escape valve cum 
suicide site - a notion going back to Hank Williams' "Long Gone Lonesome
 Blues" from the '50s. Also, the song "Wreck on the Highway" is not only
 the same title as the old Roy Acuff country hit, but it also shares a 
similar helplessness at coming upon a highway fatality ("blood and 
glass" run together in Springsteen's view of the crash; "whiskey and 
blood" in the Acuff hit).<br>
The ballads leave the deepest imprint, but the album is also rife with 
sturdy rockers, from the vibrant rush of "Cadillac Ranch," to the 
Spectorian wall-of-sound of "I'm a Rocker" and the Eddie- 
Cochran-meets-Sam-the-Sham dance feel of "Ramrod." In the hands of a 
lesser artist, all of this commingling of styles and themes would be a 
futile act of hubris, but in Springsteen's care it is grist for a 
masterpiece.*<br>
