Bruce Springsteen: The Rising<br>

Bruce Springsteen<br>
Album: The Rising <br>
Label: Columbia		<br>
 B+  </strong><br>
<br>
It seems almost like a setup for disappointment. The Rising is Bruce 
Springsteen's first full album of new material since 1995's The Ghost Of
 Tom Joad, a middling folkish offering from the heart of a decade of 
so-so work. It's the first full-length studio disc he's recorded with 
the E Street Band in nearly two decades. It follows a world tour whose 
sweeping success seemed to demand that Springsteen reassume his position
 as a combination of rock star and secular saint. And, most difficult of
 all, it addresses the Sept. 11 attacks at a time when the rest of the 
world has yet to sort out its feelings about that day. In short, 
Springsteen has a lot of expectations to meet. Any suggestion of a 
musical crisis of confidence, however, vanishes with the album's first 
chord, which picks up pretty much where Born In The U.S.A. left off 18 
years ago. As for Springsteen's ability to address so large a topic as 
Sept. 11 with so small a thing as a rock 'n' roll album, The Rising 
confirms that, too. From the start, his capacity for empathy has been 
his greatest gift as a songwriter, and here, that gift stretches to 
include everyone from Sept. 11's victims to those they left behind, as 
well as an anonymous suicide bomber in an unnamed marketplace. Whatever 
the bigger picture, Springsteen knows that we can only see tragedy from 
ground level, which is where the only truthful songs come from. Two 
moods mix and mingle on The Rising: bottomless sadness and hard-won 
hopefulness. It's hard to think of a songwriter other than Springsteen 
who could convey both without one neutralizing the other. "I want a kiss
 from your lips / I want an eye for an eye," Springsteen sings on "Empty
 Sky," and those contradictory impulses sum up the messiness of the 
emotions involved. A song of abandoned faith, "Empty Sky" may be The 
Rising's most despairing moment. Mostly, sadness comes hand in hand with
 resignation, as on "You're Missing," whose protagonist finds absurdity 
in the "shirts in the hall" and "shoes in the closet" that can't reflect
 the loss of a loved one. The album also strikes another delicate 
balance, between somberness and spiritedness. A few nouveau touches by 
producer Brendan O'Brien aside, this is unmistakably an E Street album, 
and Springsteen takes full advantage of his band, particularly on 
up-tempo tracks like "Further On (Up The Road)," "Lonesome Day," and 
"Countin' On A Miracle," each a mix of woe and unlikely optimism, like 
the album itself. The Rising ends with "My City Of Ruins," which began 
life as a tribute to Springsteen's downtrodden Asbury Park, became an 
unofficial Sept. 11 anthem, and transcends both. It's quintessential 
Springsteen, a portrait of devastation met with the faith that the 
situation will change, maybe starting with the song itself.</div>

THE GUARDIAN<br>
ALEX PETRIDIS<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band The Rising<br>
*** (Columbia)<br>
</strong><br>
Anyone wishing to test the temperature of American popular culture might
 consider comedian Bill Maher. Two months ago Maher's TV show, 
Politically Incorrect, was cancelled. The reason? Maher made a 
politically incorrect remark about September 11: "Staying in the 
airplane when it hits the building . . . it's not cowardly." Maher will 
be replaced by Jimmy Kimmel, a comic of the beer, sport and breasts 
variety. Americans, it seems, have less stomach for ambiguity than ever.<br>
<br>
No rock star knows the dangers of ambiguity more intimately than Bruce 
Springsteen. He wrote perhaps the most misinterpreted song in pop 
history, the title track of his 15m-selling 1984 album Born in the USA. A
 troubled examination of Vietnam's after-effects, it was misconstrued by
 fans, detractors and even Ronald Reagan as gung-ho chest-beating. 
Springsteen, a liberal, was apparently horrified. Perhaps this was 
slightly disingenuous. If you set your troubled examination of Vietnam's
 after-effects to the sort of declamatory fanfare last heard when an 
all-conquering Caesar returned to Rome, bellow it in a voice that 
suggests you are about to leap offstage and punch a communist, then 
package it in a sleeve featuring the Stars and Stripes and a pair of 
Levi's, it's no good getting huffy when people seize the wrong end of 
the stick.<br>
<br>
Springsteen certainly seemed chastened by the incident. He spent the 
1990s making a series of thoughtful, introspective albums, having 
dismantled his bombastic backing troupe the E Street Band in 1989. These
 albums achieved a fraction of Born in the USA's sales, but no one could
 mistake them for jingoistic grandstanding. These two facts may be 
connected.<br>
<br>
The Rising sees Springsteen reuinted with the E Street Band. The 
occasion is an album inspired by September 11. Anticipating a return to 
flag-waving anthemics, one British broadsheet has decried Springsteen as
 "a born-again patriot". Perhaps for the same reasons, however, the 
American media has done everything but kill the fatted calf.<br>
<br>
While Nashville's songwriters started churning out glutinous tributes 
before Ground Zero had stopped smoking, rock's response to September 11 
has been muted. Now the man they once called The Boss has stepped into 
the breach. Those in search of rabble rousing are likely to be 
disappointed by The Rising. Eight of its 15 tracks deal with September 
11 in exactly the same way: the lamentations of people whose lovers died
 in the attacks.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's limited metaphorical palette has been noted before - he 
spent 15 years writing songs in which unemployed Vietnam vets called 
Gary tried and failed to escape their destiny by driving down the 
highway - but here the repetitions are highlighted by their proximity. A
 song in which the streets are cloudy with dust and flowing with blood, 
and the sky is empty and crying, is followed by a song in which the sky 
is cloudy with dust and raining blood, and the streets are empty and 
crying.<br>
<br>
When he lays off the imagery, Springsteen is capable of remarkable 
poignancy: "I've got too many phone calls - 'How's everything?' " he 
sings on You're Missing. Ultimately, however, when these songs work, it 
is because of their melodies rather than their words. Into the Fire and 
Nothing Man are lambent and beautiful, Sunny Day and My City in Ruins 
uplifting. When Springsteen's melodic powers fail, as on the tuneless 
Countin' on a Miracle, the results are ghastly.<br>
<br>
Springsteen says the album is "very recognisable and very different". 
The first part of that statement is certainly true. The E Street Band 
helped define the sound of 1980s stadium rock and here it is back in 
force. Your tolerance for Clarence Clemmons's honking saxophone solos 
depends entirely on your fondness for the decade of Reaganomics and 
mutually assured destruction: either way, they sound anachronistic. 
"Meet me at Mary's place!" choruses Springsteen on the rollicking Mary's
 Place, "we're going to have a party!" You suspect that at said party 
everybody will be dancing to Huey Lewis and the News.<br>
<br>
The "very different" claim rests on a handful of drum loops that cause 
the E Street Band to lumber even more heavily than in the past, and a 
quick burst of world music. A song called Worlds Apart sets a plea for 
global tolerance to ethnic samples. As ever, there is no doubting 
Springsteen's sincerity, but the tablas and Pakistani vocals lay the 
message on a bit thick.<br>
<br>
The Rising is heavy-handed. Its lyrics are repetitious, its sound 
wilfully dated, its messages straightforward. But perhaps 
heavy-handedness is the point. The last time Springsteen made headlines,
 in 2000, the head of New York's Fraternal Order of Police was calling 
him a "fucking dirtbag" for writing American Skin, an oblique song about
 the police shooting of West African immigrant Amadou Diallo. There is 
no room for interpretation here, which makes it a perfect record for an 
America where ambiguity's stock has crashed. They may even start calling
 him The Boss again.</div>

<br>
<em class="text-italics">I believe in the love that you gave me,<br>
I believe in the faith that can save me,<br>
I believe in the hope and I pray that one day<br>
It may raise me above these Badlands.</em><br>
<br>
—Bruce Springsteen, “Badlands”<br>
<br>
Faith, hope and love have always played a part in Bruce Springsteen’s 
songs, but this has become more explicit in recent years. Springsteen’s 
willingness to talk about these themes also is relatively new.<br>
<br>
The Rev. Andrew Greeley’s article, “The Catholic Imagination of Bruce 
Springsteen” (Am., 2/6/88), seems to have been a catalyst in this 
regard. The Catholic novelist Walker Percy read the article and wrote to
 Springsteen in early 1989, particularly interested in the fact that 
Greeley described him as a Catholic. “If this is true, and I am too,” 
his letter read, “it would appear the two of us are rarities in our 
professions: you as a post-modern musician, I as a writer, a novelist 
and a philosopher. That and your admiration of Flannery O’Connor. She 
was a dear friend of mine, though she was a much more heroic Catholic 
than I.” Walker Percy died before Springsteen responded to his letter, 
but the musician wrote in a four-page letter to Percy’s widow:<br>
<br>
The loss and search for faith and meaning have been at the core of my 
own work for most of my adult life. I’d like to think that perhaps that 
is what Dr. Percy heard and was what moved him to write me. Those issues
 are still what motivate me to sit down, pick up my guitar and write.<br>
<br>
Percy’s nephew, Will Percy, subsequently interviewed Springsteen about 
the formative influences on his song-writing for the Harvard 
psychiatrist Robert Coles’s magazine Doubletake in 1998. (Excerpts from 
the above letters are reprinted from that article.) In this 
conversation, which took place at Springsteen’s farm in New Jersey, 
Springsteen talked about the influence Flannery O’Connor’s novels had on
 his song-writing in his late 20’s. Recalling writing the songs for the 
“Nebraska” CD, he said:<br>
<br>
There was something in those stories of hers that I felt captured a 
certain part of the American character that I was interested in writing 
about. They were a big, big revelation. She got to the heart of some 
part of meanness that she never spelled out, because if she spelled it 
out you wouldn’t be getting it. It was always at the core of every one 
of her stories—the way that she’d left that hole there, that hole that’s
 inside of everybody. There was some dark thing—a component of 
spirituality—that I sensed in her stories, and that set me off exploring
 characters of my own. She knew original sin—knew how to give it the 
flesh of a story.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s interest in questions of meaning is a very personal 
matter. In a recent interview with Matt Lauer of NBC’s “Today,” he 
talked about his family and the symbols of faith from his youth, and how
 these became more important to him as he grew older:<br>
<br>
I grew up with a very big extended family, with a lot of aunts. We had 
about five or six houses on one street. The church was in the middle and
 the convent was here (on one side of the church) and the rectory was 
here (on the other side) and we surrounded those things. So, I’ve seen 
more weddings and funerals.... But there were always the aunts and 
uncles around me. And, I think in some fashion the older I got the more 
those things mattered. And, even before I was married, when my life had 
begun to become something very different, those were the times when I 
felt I needed to connect most and probably for my own purposes, really.<br>
<br>
Connecting was helpful to him and had a big impact on the parish 
community he grew up in, St. Rose of Lima in Freehold, N.J. After he had
 moved back to New Jersey from Los Angeles, one of his aunts told him 
about the new Hispanic parishioners at St. Rose who were struggling to 
make it in Freehold. Wanting to help in some way, he did a show in his 
old grade school gymnasium to help the parish buy the local Y.M.C.A. 
building. It is now used, among other things, as a community center for 
the Spanish-speaking parishioners. Profits from the show also 
contributed toward the salary of a Spanish-speaking priest for the 
parish.<br>
<br>
Springsteen continues to pursue issues of faith and meaning through his 
songs; and he does this with, at times, considerable artistry and depth 
in the newly released CD “The Rising” (Columbia, 2002). This CD has the 
most explicitly religious imagery of any of his work to date: “precious 
blood,” “holy cross,” “the cross of my calling,” “pearl and silver” 
(i.e., the rosary), “Mary in the garden,” “holy pictures,” along with 
references to God and the devil, and the interreligious “seven pictures 
of Buddha,” “the prophet’s on my tongue” and “seven days, seven 
candles.”<br>
<br>
Not all the songs are about Sept. 11, 2001, but especially poignant are 
lyrics that recall the sky on that morning, as in the song “Empty Sky” 
and the title song, “The Rising.” In the latter, the narrator sees the 
image of “Mary in the garden/ In the garden of a thousand sighs/ There’s
 holy pictures of our children, dancin’ in a sky filled with light.” A 
“dream of life” comes to the narrator as he contemplates the sky:<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Sky of blackness and sorrow<br>
(a dream of life)<br>
Sky of love, sky of tears<br>
(a dream of life)<br>
Sky of glory and sadness<br>
(a dream of life)<br>
Sky of mercy, sky of fear<br>
(a dream of life)<br>
Sky of memory and shadow<br>
(a dream of life)<br>
Your burnin’ wind<br>
fills my arms tonight<br>
Sky of longing and emptiness<br>
(a dream of life)<br>
Sky of fullness, sky of<br>
blessed life<br>
<br>
The refrain, “Come on up for the rising,” suggests, as does much else in
 the song, new life and resurrection. When asked in a recent interview 
by Ted Koppel of “Nightline” if it was the resurrection he had in mind, 
Springsteen responded, “Yeah, well, I’m a good.... Well, I was a good 
Catholic boy when I was little, so those images for me are always very 
close, and they explain a lot about life.” He then elaborated: “What I 
was trying to describe, one of the most powerful images of the 11th, 
that I’d read in the paper, some of the people coming down were talking 
about the emergency workers who were ascending. And you know, that was 
just an image I felt left with, after that particular day. The idea of 
those guys going up the stairs, up the stairs, ascending, ascending. I 
mean you could be ascending a smoky staircase, you could be in the 
afterlife, moving on.”<br>
<br>
He sings of an emergency worker in the song “Into the Fire,” with the 
recurring line “love and duty called you someplace higher, somewhere up 
the stairs....” It is one song that turns prayerful and evokes images of
 a litany of the saints as he sings about the ones who have gone 
“someplace higher.”<br>
<br>
“My City of Ruins” contains recurring images of new life and 
resurrection, with the oft-repeated refrain, “Come on, rise up....” With
 what sounds like a gospel choir supporting him in the background, 
Springsteen ends the song in the mode of a prayer:<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
With these hands,<br>
With these hands, With these hands,<br>
With these hands, I pray Lord<br>
With these hands, With these hands,<br>
I pray for the strength, Lord<br>
With these hands, With these hands,<br>
I pray for the faith, Lord<br>
With these hands, With these hands,<br>
I pray for your love, Lord.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s piety is not the simple-minded, flag-waving type. He 
introduced the song “Born in the USA” at his summer concert in Detroit 
by talking about the need for vigilance at this time because there has 
been a “rollback” in the area of civil rights since Sept. 11. None of 
the songs on “The Rising” naïvely celebrates America’s virtues. One, 
which highlights the deep and tragic divisions in the world today, 
“Worlds Apart,” includes vocals by the Pakistani singers Asif Ali Khan 
and Group. Images of tenderness that two lovers experience, who at the 
same time “stand worlds apart,” shift to the larger world stage and a 
plea that those of us who are living might be able to make some 
connection with one another, so that the painful memories around loss of
 life do not serve to increase hatred and violence. In his words, “May 
the living let us in, before the dead tear us apart.” Rather than let 
the blood that has been shed in the past do this, he holds out hope for 
reconciliation: “We’ll let blood build a bridge/ over mountains draped 
in stars/ I’ll meet you on the ridge/ between these worlds apart.”<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Springsteen’s music has always wrestled with questions of meaning and 
the difficulty of maintaining faith and hope in trying circumstances. As
 Matt Lauer said in his recent interview with Springsteen, this is just a
 particularly good time for Springsteen’s kind of music. Springsteen 
said he went to the beach in Asbury Park soon after Sept. 11, and a 
passenger in the next car recognized him, rolled down the window and 
yelled, “We need you now.” A genuine calling from the people. I’m glad 
Springsteen responded.<br>

<br>
Keyboardist opens up about full band 'Nebraska' sessions, surviving Bruce's solo turn and what the future may hold<br>
<br>
Rolling Stone<br>
By Andy Greene |<br>
 January 22, 2015</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
On September 19th, 1974 Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band played 
two shows at the Main Point, a club right outside of Philadelphia. "He 
loosens up with a new song," Paul Alpaugh wrote in the Villanova 
University student newspaper The Villanovan, "introducing a new keyboard
 man who makes the audience forget about the old one."<br>
<br>
Alpaugh identified the new keyboard player as "Roy Bittner," which is 
pretty close considering he somehow thought that Max Weinberg's name was
 "Larry Nash." He meant Roy Bittan, who had joined the group a couple 
weeks earlier, when David Sancious suddenly quit and left the group in 
the lurch. His timing was pretty stellar considering Springsteen had 
only just begun working on Born to Run, the album that would forever 
change the lives of everyone involved.<br>
<br>
Over 40 years later, Bittan is still in the E Street Band. He also just 
released Out of the Box, his first solo disc. We recently spoke to 
Bittan about this and the many other non-Springsteen records he played 
on over the years. But we couldn't let him off the phone without going 
through his history with Bruce, and here the keyboardist discussed 
everything from the making of Born to Run to E Street's recent Hall of 
Fame induction.<br>
<br>
A couple of years ago we ran a photo where you're on the beach with 
Bruce and he's holding you in his arms like a giant baby. What was going
 on there? <br>
[Laughs] Well, it's funny. There's actually two photos like that. One 
was taken in San Sebastián, Spain, where he's holding me like that, and 
the other was in Rio de Janeiro, same photo. First of all, we're the 
beach rats in the band. Whenever there's a beach around and it's warm 
we're like, "OK, come on! Let's go! Let's hit the ocean." On this last 
tour we were down in Australia and South Africa. Any day we had off, 
we'd get in a van and travel to some beautiful beach. We lay in the 
sand, go swimming in the ocean and maybe watch the sunset before we head
 back to the hotel. We do it whenever we can.<br>
<br>
But to explain the photo, we did a shoot with Annie Leibovitz for, I 
believe, The River. We did this whole photo session, and when it broke 
everyone moved away from the set besides Bruce and I. He picked me up, 
just like that. Annie, being the great veteran she is, still had a 
camera around her neck and captured the moment. I'm actually looking at 
that photo on my wall as I speak to you. So, there's a history of him 
picking me up and holding me in his arms like that.<br>
<br>
Moving on to actual music, everyone is always interested in the story 
behind Nebraska. How many of the songs did you guys try and record with 
the band?<br>
I don't know offhand. My vague memory tells me it was maybe a majority 
of the songs? I think we actually rehearsed those songs in the living 
room of my house. I had a really high-ceilinged living room with lots of
 glass and wood, and it actually sounded great in there. I think we cut.
 . . not cut, I think we rehearsed quite a number of those songs. I 
don't have a good handle on what was maybe written later.<br>
<br>
The fans would love to hear that tape. The "Full Band Nebraska" has 
become this mythical thing, and nobody can agree on exactly what 
happened.<br>
I'd like to hear it, too. There may be a tape around somewhere. I'm not sure. <br>
<br>
Why doesn't Danny play on Born to Run, besides the title track?<br>
I don't know if Danny was terribly present at that particular moment. 
Also, I have to say that when it came time to cut that, I think Jon 
[Landau] was instrumental in trying to do it in a "let's cut a basic 
track" process. For the basic tracks on those songs, that turned out to 
be piano, bass and drums. Bruce wrote most of those songs on the piano. 
When I first visited him in Long Branch, he sat down at the piano and 
played me some of those songs, so it made sense to do it like that.<br>
<br>
Also, Danny is a very different player than myself. I think that in 
focusing the recording, they wanted me to sort of lay those tracks with 
Bruce. Danny was a very feeling player. He was not the type to come in 
and play the same thing again and again and again, take after take, to 
get a track. He would play something and then change it up a bit, so he 
was not an architectural player like I was. That's one of the reasons 
why we functioned so well in that band. If we'd both been architectural,
 we'd probably be fighting over how to build things in the structure of 
the songs.<br>
<br>
So, I think the architecture that I provided was maybe difficult for 
Danny to play with at the time. I was just being asked to play piano and
 then when it came time to overdub organ, I was just being asked to 
overdub organ. I had just joined the band. This was my proving ground, 
really. I just ran with whatever I was handed, so I got to play organ on
 all those songs. I think that maybe me doing it made it easier to 
record because I was integrating an organ part into my piano part. I 
would take two swipes at the organ on a song and I would pretty much 
have it because I knew every note I had played on the piano.<br>
<br>
Jumping way ahead in time here, how did the rest of the band feel when 
you were the one guy brought back for the Human Touch/Lucky Town tour?<br>
That was a tremendously emotional time for everybody. Bruce decided he 
was moving on and leaving the band behind. I was one of the guys who was
 let go. It was not like Bruce and I had this idea we were gonna do 
something, and then he fired everybody else. I got the same phone call 
everybody did, and for a couple of months I was cut loose also. So at 
that point, we all had feelings. It was impossible to not have feelings 
about things.<br>
<br>
As far as me coming back, I don't know if anybody was really mad at me. 
But they certainly, I'm sure, did not have good feelings about the whole
 situation. We made those iconic records as a band. They were 
collaborations, to a degree. And then all of a sudden, you're being told
 that all the work that you put into a band, you're not allowed to 
experience that anymore.<br>
<br>
I think that some guys may have had feelings about me in particular. I 
think it was misguided. Again, there was no grand conspiracy. But I 
think whatever they felt, they were entitled to feel. It was a harsh 
situation at that particular moment. I kind of always described it to 
myself like there was a plane crash and I was the only survivor.<br>
<br>
It was a strange moment in time. But what can I say? It was a great 
experience for me. I got to co-write three songs. I got to co-produce 
and be involved in elements of the record that I'd never really been a 
part of.<br>
<br>
To just keep bouncing around in time, how did the synths become so prominent on Born in the USA?<br>
To put it in historical context, it was 1983 and MTV had started to 
happen. The 1980s sounds started to happen. We had Born to Run, Darkness
 and The River. And here we were with some new songs. I think Bruce was 
looking, even at that time, for more color other than just classic 
instrumentation. At that particular moment, synthesizers were in vogue. 
I, of course, was interested for obvious reasons. There was a backlash 
against synthesizers for not really being a rock &amp; roll thing and 
"it's not this and not that," but I always recognized it as a tool to 
paint other colors.<br>
<br>
Getting back to Human Touch. I've heard Bruce say he felt he didn't 
quite nail songs like "Real World" during the recording process. Do you 
think that's fair?<br>
I think that's fair. With "Real World," I had written that music and I 
had a track. He's performed it live as a ballad. Maybe he's only ever 
performed it as a ballad. I think we kind of missed on that. It's hard 
to say. We were experimenting with computer recording. I had an early 
Pro Tools system in the studio that was incredibly archaic when you look
 back at it.<br>
<br>
He was searching for something new, whether it was in writing or 
recording. He wanted a new direction. The interesting thing is that it 
was the prototype, so to speak, for the recording method that he's been 
using ever since. He uses a computer. He may cut some things live, but 
it goes into the computer. We work on it. We overdub with the computer. 
It's been our method of recording ever since then. So, it really was the
 first time that our so-called modern technique of recording was used.<br>
<br>
On The Rising, I feel like the violin played parts that normally would have been synths. Is that true?<br>
I think that's true. I think that it could've been a synthesizer or it 
could have been the strings. I think maybe that was a reaction to 
pulling back the synthesizer sound and maybe just going back to a more 
real instrument sound.<br>
<br>
As far as playing live, what are the challenges or playing as part of an
 18-piece E Street Band as opposed to a seven-piece E Street Band?<br>
[Laughs] Well, I don't know if the amount of people makes a difference. 
What we have, basically, is a core band. We have Bruce, Max, Garry, 
Steven and myself pretty much to one side of the stage, and then Nils is
 to the right of Bruce and, of course, Charlie is far right. But for me,
 it's all about the rhythm section and locking in with Max and Garry. 
Having Bruce and Steve right there, there's always a lot of action going
 on.<br>
<br>
So, that is what's happening with me. Then there's the singers, the 
horns, violin and all these things happen at different times during a 
song. It's a little more intermittent, whereas the core band is firing 
on all cylinders all the time in some manner or shape or form. It's 
great to hear the other stuff. It comes in and out, and I love it. But 
for me, it has always been and it always has been about playing with 
those seven guys. I say seven because that's what we were.<br>
<br>
A lot of fans were pretty shocked during the last tour when you guys 
brought back "Prove It All Night" with the 1978 intro. Did it surprise 
you that Bruce wanted to do that again?<br>
It's always a surprise when he pulls something out of the bag. We really
 did a lot of interesting things over the years. When we played Hyde 
Park a couple of years ago, we started the show with "Thunder Road," 
just Bruce and myself. We hadn't done that in, God knows, 30 years? It 
was a really long time, and it was a beautiful thing. We did that back 
when Born to Run first came out. It's always a surprise when it turns 
around and he goes, "Hey, let's do this like we used to." It was a great
 little instrumental prologue to the song, and it's just always great to
 stretch out like that. <br>
<br>
Are there ever times he calls for a song and your brain freezes? I think
 of "Racing in the Street ('78)" or something where it's a variation of a
 song you've played a million times. That must get confusing.<br>
[Laughs] Look, the songbook must be at least 250 songs, and then all the
 cover things we've done. So, there are moments when he's going, "One, 
two, three," and you're still trying to figure out what you have to 
play. Sometimes he calls a song and you haven't played it in 10 years. 
It's a little freaky. But I guess that's one of the things about having a
 lot of people on stage. Chances are there are a few of us that know how
 it's supposed to go.<br>
<br>
Might you tour this year? Do you have any idea what the future holds?<br>
Ah, the acid test question! People always want to know what we're doing.
 I understand that. The music business is generally one in which people 
make plans far in advance, and they don't veer from their plans. 
Whereas, with Bruce, it's just simply that he writes songs, he makes an 
album and then he figures out where he wants to go and play.<br>
<br>
You know, there's always some plans in the mix. But until he says, "The 
album is done, let's go," I don't ever really know. It's kind of been 
that way for 40 years. I just go along with it and read the river, 
pardon the pun, and I'm sure at some point he's gonna say, "OK, this is 
what I want to do," and it'll happen. But until then, it's just as much a
 waiting game for me as it is for the fans. So, did I dodge the question
 good enough?<br>
<br>
Yes, that was a perfect dodge. Textbook.<br>
Well, that happens to be the truth, so take it.<br>
<br>
Finally, do you think you guys spoke too long when you were inducted into the Hall of Fame?<br>
[Laughs] I don't think that I spoke too long.<br>
<br>
How about combined?<br>
Yes, I think we did. I think there was a lot of extraneous talk and a 
bit too much talk. At one point I was thinking about stepping up to the 
podium and telling everyone if they had tickets to the next night's game
 at the Barclays Center, we were going to have cots available so they 
could take a nap beforehand. Yeah, I stood up there for a long time 
waiting to talk. By the time I got up to speak, I was like, "OK, this is
 kind of. . ." It took the wind out of my sails in a way.<br>
<br>
It was really nice to watch you guys play with Vini and David again.<br>
Yeah, it was. That was a lovely thing. If you look at the history of the
 band and the two early records that Vini and Davie play on, those two 
records are charming, and it was informative to play with them. Playing 
with them was a beautiful thing.<br>
<br>
By the way, have you looked at Wikipedia recently? Their photo of you is
 ludicrously unflattering. It's the side of your head from this crazy 
angle.<br>
Wikipedia? I'll have to check that out. I've never seen that. I guess I'll have to go in and do something about that.</div>

Bruce Springsteen: 'I make a sound like singing'<br>
<br>
Bob Gordon<br>
February 6, 2014<br>
The Guardian</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen opened his sold-out Australian tour with the first of 
three shows at the Perth Arena on Wednesday night, less than a year 
after his 2013 Wrecking Ball tour of the east coast.<br>
<br>
In that time the New Jersey rocker’s popularity has skyrocketed once 
again – not only in Australia but globally, with the love-letter 
documentary, Springsteen &amp; I, and a revealing authorised biography, 
Bruce, opening the door more than ever into his life and work. <br>
<br>
Not that Springsteen is feeling overexposed. “I kind of do what I want 
and people get to say what they want about me,” he told a small group of
 media during a break from soundcheck earlier in the afternoon. “It sort
 of comes with the work that I do. <br>
<br>
“Generally, my press agent tries to keep me out of the newspapers,” he 
continued. “On a scale of one to ten, what usually gets out there about 
me is so much less than the amount of information that people are 
spewing onto the internet about so many things. So it’s not as though 
it’s a full-scale publicity blitz. I don’t even notice it, to be honest 
with you.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen's setlist – and new album, High Hopes – includes a cover 
version of Australian punk pioneers' the Saints’ Just Like Fire Would. 
Pondering what other Australian artists he could potentially cover, he 
was curious about former Perth band, the Triffids.<br>
<br>
“The Triffids you say? What’s the song called? Wide Open Road? Can somebody please write that down?”<br>
<br>
The man with such classic songs as Born to Run, The River, Dancing in 
the Dark, Badlands, Hungry Heart and many more doesn’t really need to 
consider covers, but even his iconic talents are tinged with an 
endearing modesty.<br>
<br>
“I never thought of myself as an interpretative singer,” he said. “I 
didn’t quite have the feel like Rod Stewart or Ray Charles. Singers’ 
singers. I made myself sing. I make a sound that sounds like singing. 
It’s communicating, as I call it.”</div>

Live at The Cleveland Agora<br>
Jeff Symonds<br>
<br>
January 29, 2015</strong><br>
<br>
Introduction <br>
<br>
My relationship with Bruce Springsteen’s music has been inconsistent.  I
 was late to the game— while Bruce was establishing himself in the late 
70s, I was listening to Boston and the Beatles.  The first song I was 
aware of was “Hungry Heart,” and it sounded like a 50s song to me; I 
skipped over him and, in 1982, went right to the Clash and punk rock.  
In the winter of 1983, however, I joined the Columbia record and tape 
club and bought Nebraska, which was the first Springsteen album I owned 
and listened to carefully, and I loved it.  When I got my first acoustic
 guitar a year later, I learned how to play “Atlantic City,” “Johnny 
99,” “State Trooper” and “Highway Patrolman” in the first week I had it—
 they were four of the first twenty songs I learned how to play on 
guitar.<br>
<br>
That spring, I was in the backseat of my parents’ car, and we were 
driving back into Annapolis over the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, when a song 
came on the radio that grabbed my attention immediately.  I thought the 
lyrics were incredible (and I usually never notice lyrics) and the 
melody unforgettable.  But I was also really bummed out by the loud 80s 
keyboard sound (ironic, as by that point I was myself a loud 80s 
keyboard player in a band).  When the song ended, I thought to myself, 
“Wow— that’s a great song— too bad it sounds that way.”  <br>
<br>
It was “Dancing In The Dark.”<br>
<br>
The rest, as you know, is history.  Bruce became Broooooooooooooce that 
year.  By 1985, he was playing stadiums and was probably the most 
popular American rock musician since Elvis.  I bought Born In The U.S.A.
 like everyone I knew, listened to it 700 times, watched the videos on 
MTV every time they came on, and… secretly… didn’t love it that much.  
The gunshot snare drum and the DX-7 synth got in my way of those 
terrific songs every time; they still do.<br>
<br>
So I went backwards in the catalog looking for greatness, and I was 
frustrated by almost all of it. I loved Born To Run(and it’s still my 
favorite by some distance), but Greetings, from 1973, was too quiet and 
restrained.  Wild And Innocentwas too inconsistent— even then I couldn’t
 abide a drummer who slows down.  Darkness was too slow and ponderous 
for me in the 80s— when half your record collection is hardcore punk 
rock, Darkness sounds like chamber music, and Bruce looked sleepy to me 
on the cover, not brooding.  Same problem with The River— I loved the 
first three songs, and most of the fast numbers, but I was bored to 
death by side four.<br>
<br>
I basically decided that, though I would keep it to myself, Springsteen 
was overrated and perhaps a little too in love with his “everyman” 
image.<br>
<br>
The behemoth live box set in 1986 changed everything.  I couldn’t listen
 to the fourth and fifth LPs (who wants to feel like they’re sitting in a
 giant stadium?) but the first three albums in the box floored me.  Here
 were the versions of the songs that made sense!  Hearing him live, I 
totally got it.  I listened to some of those performances every day for 
year.  It’s still not safe for me to drive to “Saint In The City” or 
“Candy’s Room.”<br>
<br>
Therefore, being the kind of person I am (and maybe you are, if you’re 
still reading) I went hunting for Springsteen bootlegs, and since 1991, 
when I got high quality copies of the Passaic 9-19-78 and Main Point 
2-5-75 shows, almost all of my Springsteen listening has been live 
bootlegs.  The only two records I listen to anymore are Born To Run and 
Wild and Innocent— other than that, the Bruce that I feel truly does him
 justice is unavailable to the law-abiding record buying public. (With 
the exception of Live In Dublin from 2007— that’s fantastic). <br>
<br>
So imagine my excitement when, after four decades of hopeful clamoring 
by fans, Bruce Springsteen has opened his vaults.  On the dedicated 
website live.brucespringsteen.net, he has started to release complete 
concerts, following the model used by Pearl Jam and Phish— almost of his
 2014 tour is available, but more exciting, he has started a 
simultaneous “archives” series that promises to reach back as far as 
1973.<br>
<br>
The first release in the series was from the Apollo Theatre in 2012, and
 I believe it was the first show after Clarence Clemons’ death.  Though 
an emotional and memorable night for the band, it didn’t do much for me 
as a show; I didn’t love the song selection or the mix, and it had me 
worried that Bruce would overthink his choices and leave us all 
frustrated again.<br>
<br>
This show was the second release, two days before Christmas, and it has 
taken over my life for the last month.  It blew my head off.  So much 
so, that it’s going to re-awaken the blog, and lead me to try something 
new; I’m going to listen to the entire show and write about it in one 
sitting.<br>
<br>
I had heard the bootleg version of the show taped off the radio, and 
while fun, the sound quality was an impediment.  But this is the 
original master tape, mixed by Jimmy Iovine and given a sonic 2015 
scrubbing to remove its age spots.  It sounds exactly like 1978— it’s a 
damn time machine. Since I started listening to it, my dreams have been 
about my childhood, and I’m remembering all kinds of things that I’d 
forgotten (some of which, I’m sure, will come up in the next few hours).
  As of this writing, this show is the definitive 1978 document of the 
band, and one of the five best things Springsteen’s ever released, 
period.<br>
<br>
so until they pull it down, get comfy and feel free to listen along.  
It’s even indexed for ya.  For the next three hours, the blog has a new 
subtitle: “Jeff stays up too late listening to a concert for the 17th 
time and loves every minute of it.”<br>
Setlist 1<br>
<br>
Agora 1978 is the complete set from a show in the middle of the mammoth 
Darkness tour, a free show played in front of 1500 people in a place 
that holds 750 and broadcast live on WMMS in Cleveland and all around 
the region.  Springsteen does two 70 minute sets and a thirty minute 
encore.  It’s a month after the famous Roxy show that Springsteen used 
on the live box set.  It’s a hot, steamy Cleveland summer night, the 
club has allowed double capacity to sneak in, Springsteen knows that 
millions will be listening on the radio, and he’s hungry.<br>
<br>
Kid Leo, WMMS DJ and rock tastemaker, introduces the band.  Springsteen 
comes on, and undercuts Leo’s rhyming dictionary introduction.  “He must
 have memorized that at home.”  The band jumps into “Summertime Blues,” 
faithful to the Eddie Cochran original.  Many of Springsteen’s shows in 
1978 opened with a cover— I realize now after years of playing little 
clubs that it’s a brilliant move on several levels, but primarily, it 
gives the sound man a “throwaway” song to double check his levels, chase
 problems, and get a good mix together before the “actual” first song.  
And sure enough, it’s a good thing— you can hear feedback throughout the
 track, and Clarence’s mic is too low.  Nevertheless, the band is having
 a ball, and when the end of “Summertime” becomes the dramatic opening 
to “Badlands,” you can feel the audience levitate.<br>
<br>
“Badlands,” when Springsteen isn’t feeling it, bores me— it’s 
dangerously mid tempo, and the lyrics demand an urgency in the 
performance.  This version is the opposite— I’ve never enjoyed listening
 to this song as much as I have this month.  I don’t think it’s their 
“best” performance— the background vocals are ragged, and Bruce 
oversings in moments and loses pitch, but it’s part of the charm.  
Listens to Max Weinberg’s drums— he’s so excited that he’s starting his 
fills eight bars before a change instead of four— he’s barely in control
 all the way through, and it’s fantastic.  Weinberg has claimed in 
several interviews that he thinks this show is the E Street Band’s 
greatest ever, and you can see why— he goes for broke start to finish.  
Check out the ridiculous fill at 3:23— he is jacked up.  It’s amazing he
 was able to calm down enough to play the ballads.  I also love the 
guitar tones and where Danny Federici’s organ sits in the track— 
everything is rough and low-fi but still warm and professional.  When 
the track ends, you can hear the pandemonium in the club.  Bruce even 
seems a little overwhelmed— “Yo! Cleveland!”<br>
<br>
And right into “Spirit In The Night.”  Here’s another song that can veer
 off into parody.  For people who don’t get Springsteen, this song is 
exhibit A, with the silly character names and the overdramatized 
delivery.  Me?  I love it.  Call me a sucker, but these lyrics capture 
the desperation of youthful love expertly— “I said ‘I’m hurt,” she said 
“Honey, let me heal it.”  The first night that a woman said a version of
 that to me is one of the most intensely (and ultimately heartbreaking) 
memories of my entire life.  And the fact that it took place near a pond
 (no Greasy Lake, but it’ll work in a pinch) connected the song and 
moment forever in my head.  It was the first time I’d fallen in love 
uncontrollably, and to be requited for one night (but not a second) 
taught me all kinds of good and bad lessons.  So “Spirit In The Night” 
might be theatrical, but since I feel like I played the lead role, I 
forgive it entirely.<br>
<br>
The mix on this track is brilliant.  If you listen, you can hear 
everybody— the interplay between pianist Roy Bittan and Federici is 
particularly clear, and Gary Tallent’s bass is dead center.  Tallent is 
the unsung hero of this band— I never undertstood why he didn’t get more
 session work away from E Street.  Take thirty seconds and focus on him—
 he never stops moving and never pulls focus.  And Clarence is feeling 
it early in this show— he’s not exactly Coltrane, but he’s nailing his 
spots.<br>
<br>
Bruce takes a full minute break after “Spirit”— I think he’s worried 
that the crowd is a little out of control— there’s the “I’m workin’ 
here!” admonition, and then he asks the front to sit down only two songs
 after he asked them to stand at the start.  “We’ve got a long way to 
go.”<br>
<br>
“This is for Jay Cox in Cincinnati.”  And into “Darkness On The Edge Of 
Town.”  The studio version is missing something for me— it’s too 
careful, or performed, or something.  I never connected with it.  Here, 
though, the song completely makes sense to me.  The dynamic shift 
between the verses and choruses is arresting— EVERYONE finds a great 
part.  Listen to Bruce pull his guitar out of tune three or four times 
just playing chords along with the band— it sounds like he’s beating the
 hell out of it.  And Max’s three kick drums at 2:36!!  By the time 
Bruce gets to the “I’ll be on that hill!” crescendo, the band has 
nowhere to go— the last minute of the song is full-bore, on a song that 
was supposed to calm the audience down and restore order.  Not here.<br>
<br>
Then comes a real shift— Bruce plays “Factory,” a strange little two 
minute love letter to his dad and to Cleveland workers, still a 
successful factory town in 1978 and just starting to die slowly.  It’s 
clear that Bruce is trying to be serious, and the crowd doesn’t catch on
 right away.  Bruce is using set one to try to communicate the themes of
 his most recent album— accepting adulthood, compromise, imperfections, 
and responsibilities.  “Summertime Blues” is a thing of the past— the 
next 45 minutes is Bruce at his most deadly serious.  The fans call for 
hits at the end of “Factory,” but Bruce has things planned out— “we’re 
gonna get to that one, but this one’s called ‘Promised Land.’”<br>
<br>
These kinds of tunes are the side of Springsteen that can be ponderous 
if he’s not careful.  There’s nothing fun about “Factory” into “Promised
 Land,” and if not for the band, there might be a lull here, but the 
guys really have Springsteen’s back this night.  Steve Van Zandt saves 
“Promised Land”— the rhythm guitar has bite and grit not on the studio 
version, and his background vocals are unhinged and wonderfully 
tossed-off.  He’s much-needed adrenaline on the tune (Bruce acknowledges
 him at the end of the song).  When Springsteen takes a solo at 2:41, 
he’s picked up on the band’s vibe, and he’s far more adventurous than 
usual, reaching for high, bended notes and sacrificing precision for 
feel.  Even so, the last two minutes of this track are the low point of 
the show for me— listening to the last verse and chorus feels like work,
 or medicine.  It feels like it’s good for me, and the only moment in 
the whole show where I feel like Bruce is singing at me, rather than 
inviting me to sing along with him.<br>
<br>
Happily, it’s a short-lived lull.  What follows next is one of the 
handful of greatest performances I’ve ever heard this band do.  On the 
1978 tour, Bruce opened “Prove It All Night” with the longest guitar 
solos of his career since he was a stoner blooze guitarist on the Jersey
 Shore in Steel Mill in the late 60s and early 70s.  And this “Prove” is
 my current favorite— over the ones from Winterland and Berkeley that 
same year that are also contenders.  I love the tight, claustrophobic 
mix— listen to Clarence’s triangle cut through, Bittan’s piano, and the 
way Van Zandt, Tallent and Weinberg are locked in.  At 1:20, Bruce joins
 in, playing an A to B hammer-on for twenty seconds.  Then he’s off— 
when I was younger, I thought Bruce was sloppy, but the older I get, the
 more I love his playing.   He’s an angular player who can play fast, 
but who is also really interested in the overtones and harmonics that he
 grabs by accident.  I also love that he’s in no rush here— each part of
 the solo has its own flavor, and though improvised, stumbles upon some 
lovely memories (2:30-3:00, for example).  By the time he’s warmed up, 
he heads up the neck for the showstopping moment.  In a riff that Mark 
Knopfler would use to kickstart his career in “Sultans Of Swing” a year 
later, Springsteen builds the intro the first set’s great musical 
crescendo, and then the bands drops expertly into the song itself.  <br>
<br>
I remember reading a story about Springsteen from 1985 in Rolling Stone 
about his inability to turn off his internal motor.  It described an off
 night on the Born In The USA tour on which he was playing 3+ hours a 
night.  He went to a bar, jumped up with the band there and did 50s 
covers, and got so worked up that his own band took him outside, threw 
him over a car hood, and poured ice water on him to try to get him back 
to earth.  “Prove It All Night” to me has always sounded like the 
musical equivalent of that side of Bruce.  It’s such a desperate song, 
breathless and aggressive— in almost every live version I’ve heard, he 
clutches at least one line because his mistimes his breath—  I can’t 
believe there’s two more hours to go after this song ends— how is this 
song not the finale?  How does he push himself this completely and then 
regroup and do it again and again?  Truly remarkable stamina.  The final
 minute is ridiculous— Max and Bruce are daring each other to keep 
going.  It reminds me of a Who track the way the drums and guitar takes 
turns going for broke.<br>
<br>
When I was 19, I felt the same way as this song feels— I would have 
trouble sleeping for days, and either walk or drive around my 
neighborhood from one to four am trying to feed and conquer the voices 
in my head telling me that I could do more.  My friends must have 
thought I was nuts— I dragged so many of them out into the empty streets
 of my neighborhood just to walk and talk for hours.  It wasn’t until my
 late 30s that I could have a meaningful conversation without pacing.  <br>
<br>
Finally, at ten minutes, they call it.  Even Bruce needs a minute and a 
half to catch his breath— he gives Max his due, and then takes a break, 
and maybe even signs an autograph.  But Bruce is not done pushing the 
audience— there are three songs left to go in the set, and they’re all 
monsters: “Racing In The Street,” “Thunder Road,” and “Jungleland.”  <br>
<br>
I’ve never been a car guy, so the iconography and fetishistic quality of
 Bruce’s car descriptions have never done much for me, but like any good
 American, I love the freedom and escape and reinvention that a car 
offers.  I’m not a big fan of “Racing,” but it’s an essential song to 
play here— there’s nowhere to go but down from “Prove It All Night,” and
 Bruce’s vocal here is outstanding— I feel the frustration of the 
characters here in ways that I don’t on other performances of this song.
 In fact, one of the few songs I’ve written myself that isn’t awful 
unconsciously ripped off the final verse of this song and I didn’t know 
it until this month.  Another sign of aging— I’ve learned that my skills
 as an editor and critic wildly outweigh my skills as a creator.  The 
outro here is beautiful, a great example of a band listening to one 
another and building to something together.  Even Clarence doesn’t 
overdo it.<br>
<br>
Bruce has just played five straight songs from his new album, which 
isn’t selling well in August of 1978.  That’s thirty five minutes of 
unfamiliar music.  He has demanded a lot of his audience, and himself, 
and it’s time to reward them with two tracks from 1975’s Born To Run, 
the record that saved his career.  <br>
<br>
As the songs fades to just piano, Bruce tells a true story of a car trip
 that he and Steve took in 1977 to the west coast (pictures from it are 
in the Darkness Box set released a few years ago).  Now he’s the one 
behind the wheel, but instead of “Racing” around Asbury Park, he’s set 
his sights on the world— it’s the perfect bridge to “Thunder Road,” a 
song all about getting out and away and escaping, “pulling out of here 
to win.”  Now the message of set one is starting to take shape— a 
concert is a party, a communal celebration, where often we cheer our 
successes, but it’s also OK to acknowledge our fears, admit to our 
weaknesses and obsessions, bemoan our disappointments, renounce our 
fears, and demand more of ourselves and our lives.  When he announces 
“Thunder Road,” the place explodes with recognition and relief— the 
Darkness tunes have been bleak and unrelenting, and offered no guarantee
 of success.  It’s time to sing along and believe that, as Ralph 
Ellison’s wounded vet claimed in Invisible Man, we can “be our own 
fathers.”<br>
<br>
It’s a great “Thunder Road,” expertly played and sung (though the sound 
guy is chasing gremlins suddenly— check out Clarence’s entry on sax— 
he’s WAAAAAY too loud.  Some fans complained that the show wasn’t 
remixed for release, and it’s true that some moments sound better than 
others, but I love the you-are-there quality of it— that’s what the show
 sounded like in the hall that night, and a live show is sometimes 
defined and made memorable by happy accidents). If the set ended there, 
it would have been generous, and allowed people to go to the break 
feeling relieved, but Springsteen isn’t letting people off that easily. 
 Rather than “Thunder Road’s” uplifting optimism, Bruce makes his 
audience follow him back into his darkness and neuroses with 
“Jungleland.”<br>
<br>
I can’t believe Bruce wrote “Jungleland” at 24.  In many ways, his music
 seems more like a younger man’s now than the stuff he wrote in the 70s.
  When Bittan starts the intro, the audience sounds excited, but also 
trepidatious to me— “Oh man, they’re gonna play THAT now?”  You can 
almost hear them take some deep breaths and prepare themselves for it.<br>
<br>
“Jungleland” is another Bruce romantic epic.  Much as I love it, it 
makes me laugh at the same time.  Who has EVER been known as “The Magic 
Rat”?  I had never taken the track that seriously until I saw the band 
do it live in 1988 at the Amnesty International superconcert with Peter 
Gabriel and Sting and Tracy Chapman and Youssou N’Dour (thanks again for
 the ticket, Redman).  Seeing it live, all the bombast made sense, and I
 got completely caught up in the grandeur of it.  The same thing happens
 here— I’ve been typing non-stop for 90 minutes, and I don’t feel tired 
at all— Bruce is soloing at the three minute mark, and I’m bopping my 
head.  I’ve heard this version a dozen times in the last thirty days, 
and I can’t wait for the sax solo, and I don’t really LIKE sax solos. 
(There’s some funny stuff going on as well.  Listen for the moments when
 they put too much reverb on Max’s snare drum trying to imitate the 
album mix— a few of them last through the next hit).<br>
<br>
I like to imagine what the band is thinking at this point— they’ve been 
onstage for 65 minutes, and they must know it’s been a special first 
set, and that they’re killing it, again, on the radio.  Do they know the
 tide is turning?  That this is the gig that will define their lives?  
The combination of brotherhood, confidence, arrogance, commitment and 
purpose must have been overwhelming at times.  It’s so hard to be in a 
band, and keep it together, and surely the E Street Band must have had 
its petty politics, but it’s not possible to be onstage playing this 
well and not feel a part of something bigger.<br>
<br>
Finally, Bruce calls an end to set one— the ending of the tune is marred
 by some painful feedback (blame the reverb again) but it’s still 
triumphant.  Bruce introduces the whole band, and it feels like it could
 be good night.  After all, it’s a free show, and it’s been 70 minutes, 
and instead, he asks for fifteen minutes to regroup.  Little does the 
audience know that he’s not even halfway done.<br>
<br>
<br>
So let’s take fifteen minutes (or a month— your call.  It’s the 
internets, after all.  I’m splitting this into parts anyway).  Get some 
water and a stretch, rest your ears, and get ready to be rewarded for 
being such a conscientious audience member in part one.  Set one was 
complex and demanding— set two is a nonstop party.  I think that, for 
most people, once is enough through that first set.  The “Prove It All 
Night” will hold up over repeated listenings, but otherwise, you’re 
good.  But this second set?  Make room in your iPod (or whatever the 
hell we’re using these days).  It’s really really fun.<br>
<br>
Rested?  Great.  “Alright! Round Two!”<br>
<br>
The band comes out, Springsteen introduces Clarence, and they break into
 Paradise by the “C.”  It’s interesting to compare the crowd’s reaction—
 they are far less frantic than at the top of the show.  The band’s 
already won them over, and now band and audience are old friends, 
relaxed, and it shows in the band’s performance.  This version of 
“Paradise” truly swings— compare this track to the “Summertime / 
Badlands” opener— here, the band’s in no hurry, and there’s no attempt 
to knock the audience over or blow them back.  Instead, the band’s 
loping along (well, except when Max unleashes 300 snare hits at 3:05).  
“Paradise” is the kind of song only the E Street Band can pull off and 
make charming.  It sounds like ballroom dance music, something these 
guys might have heard floating out of a dance hall in their childhoods. 
 It serves to warm the band up for set two, and gives Clarence a 
showcase after a first set when he’s not prominently featured.  It’s not
 Clarence’s best moment— he’s late in places and he flubs the last pass,
 but the band’s exuberance covers for him.  Things are, to use a 
favorite Springsteen expression, “loose.”<br>
<br>
That vibe continues with “Fire,” a hit song that Bruce gave away.  
Here’s Bruce in seduction mode, and you can tell it’s working from the 
audience’s reaction.  I love this version of the song— the band holds 
back a little more than on the Roxy 78 version on the box set.  Bittan’s
 less insistent in the second verse, and the bridge is a little more 
sloppy and offhand, which fits Bruce’s delivery.  There’s no showoffy 
high notes on this version— Bruce is in sly smolder mode from beginning 
to end.  “C’mere darlin’…”<br>
<br>
After “Fire,” Bruce feels like chatting.  Unlike the more scripted, 
reverent stories from set one, here Bruce is off the cuff, and sharing 
his knowledge of rock history, introducing “Sherry Darling” as an 
imitation of what Bruce calls “frat rock.”  From a 2015 perspective, 
it’s fascinating to listen to Bruce sounding like a grizzled old rocker 
at age 28.  We have not yet, in 1978,  reached the moment when old farts
 like me are at concerts (or on the stage)— it’s a young person’s game 
and activity, and Bruce seems a little embarrassed to have to explain 
the origins of his song with 60s references.   Lots of bootlegs from the
 70s reveal this tension— my favorite moment is from a 1971 Allman 
Brothers radio broadcast, when Duane Allman is lamenting the murder of 
saxophonist King Curtis, brings up Aretha Franklin’s “Soul Serenade” as 
one of his great performances, and then says, “but you kids are probably
 too young to remember that far back. Sorry.”  Not only is he talking 
about a song that’s only three years old at that point, but he’s 24 when
 he apologizes to his audience for bringing up ancient history!  Only in
 the early days of rock and roll was a 24 year-old unsettlingly old.  
Springsteen is in the first generation of rock stars to turn music into a
 career and not just a youthful distraction, but he’s not there yet.<br>
<br>
This version of “Sherry Darling” is a blast, and the crowd deserves an 
MVP award, even if Bruce uncharacteristically butchers the lyrics more 
than once.  It swings a little harder than the studio version (an 
audible bass track really helps) and it represents where the Darkness 
record (and The River after it) could have gone.  Either of those 
records could have been party records, chock full of three minute 
singalongs, but Bruce (much to Van Zandt’s disappointment) couldn’t 
bring himself to limit his vision to a series of hit singles.  Now that 
he’s finally released dozens of outtakes from those sessions, you can 
make Van Zandt’s version of Darkness or The River for yourself.  I can 
truly see both men’s point-of-view.<br>
<br>
At the end of “Darling,” Bruce is completely loose, joking with the 
audience and completely in control.  He turns back to Max and says “Give
 me a beat!” and so begins what is, for me, the high point of the night—
 the mesmerizing hourlong trip through four of his most durable tunes— 
“She’s The One,” Growin’ Up,” “Backstreets,” and “Rosalita.”  “She’s The
 One” takes forever to rev up to fell speed— it’s all drums and vocals 
for the first 3 1/2 minutes.  Bruce picks up his guitar and improvs some
 chordal solos. He’s ragged in places, and outrageously out of tune in 
others, but it completely works. It’s a pretty brave, skeletal moment in
 the show, six full minutes of Bo Diddley beat before the payoff.  And 
he’s not done— Bittan starts the intro to “She’s The One,” but Bruce 
sings “Gloria” over it instead.  The band doesn’t miss a beat.  Finally,
 seven and a half minutes in, Bruce starts “She’s the One.”  Unlike 
“Summertime Blues,” I read the inclusion of the covers here as hints to 
the audience of where Bruce is trying to position himself in rock music—
 “Not Fade Away” and “Gloria” are, by this point, well-known covers by 
dozens of bands, and Springsteen’s versions are close to the originals. 
 But if you think about it, in 1978 Springsteen seems to want to be the 
intersection point between Buddy Holly’s specificity and minimalism 
("Not Fade Away") and Van Morrison’s wild, emotional indulgence 
("Gloria").  Isn’t “She’s The One,” in fact, a Buddy Holly ripoff with 
lyrics reminiscent of Morrison’s romanticized descriptions of desire?  
The band’s energy here elevates the tune above homage or imitation, 
though— it’s tougher than Holly and more direct than Morrison.  It’s 
also the first major high point of set two, and unique as well in that 
Bittan’s piano disappears completely from the mix.  He usually dominates
 the song, and I like this more stripped down version— the guitars take 
center stage, and it becomes about the sound generated by the whole band
 rather than one instrument.<br>
<br>
It takes a moment to work out whatever was wrong with the mix, and once 
the piano is audible again, Springsteen called for “Roy!” and begins one
 of his longest-ever versions of “Growin’ Up.”  This version is known 
among Springsteen fans as the “Teenage Werewolf” version because of the 
story that he tells, and it’s a story similar to the one that he tells 
on the box set at the Roxy.  Told to choose between being a lawyer and 
an author (or “a author,” as he stubbornly insists on saying), he 
chooses option C, this time with God’s blessing.  I won’t spoil it any 
further— just check it out.  It’s a generous, triumphant performance.<br>
<br>
I will say this, though— Springsteen is one of the few rock performers 
who can captivate a room with a story, and perhaps that's because it's 
the only time he's really comfortable talking to people.  In every book 
I’ve read about Springsteen, the difference between the shy, offstage 
personality and the extrovert onstage is really startling.  Like so many
 of his contemporaries, Springsteen was only able to work through the 
pain he felt about his relationship with his father in his art, and 
these stage stories are an integral part of the that struggle.  In Tom 
Petty’s Running Down A Dream documentary, archivist Bill Levenson says 
that the great untold story of rock n roll is fathers and sons, and 
Springsteen is exhibit A.  He plays the story that he tells here as 
comedy, but there’s so much obvious pain and repression at the center of
 it.  Whenever I listen to “Growin’ Up,” especially this one, I can’t 
help but think of the hundreds of thousands of teenage kids who felt 
exactly this way, and never found the outlet or the success that 
Springsteen did.  This song resonates with me for some similar reasons, 
but it doesn’t haunt me— I love my life.  However, if you really felt 
like the character in “Growin’ Up,” and also felt like you’d never 
escaped those demons and shadows, then this song must hurt and cut deep,
 even when Bruce yells “Let it rock!” and tries to you free.  <br>
<br>
And right into “Backstreets” in its most epic form for “Joey and Jimmy, 
Cleveland boys who’ve been following me for three years… I love them so 
much.”  Already seven minutes on album, this version is twice as long, 
and includes the interlude that Springsteen collectors refer to as “Sad 
Eyes.”  Unlike the other epic songs that I’ve been critical of in this 
review, I think “Backstreets” is magnificent on Born To Run, and harder 
to improve live than some of his other tunes.  Moreover, for some 
reason, the images and characters don’t seem overly stylized to me.  
Rather than feeling like a low-rent West Side Story, this song always 
made me feel like I needed to meet more interesting people, and that 
love required a depth of devotion and feeling that, when I first heard 
the song as a teenager, I knew I didn’t have yet.  These folks felt real
 to me, and “Backstreets” made me want to dig deeper into myself.  The 
band on this take feels the same way— they are up to the challenge and 
play “Backstreets” with the same fervor that they brought to “Prove It 
All Night” ninety minutes earlier.<br>
<br>
Bruce hits the “Sad Eyes” moment around the six minute mark.  There are 
variations of this interlude all over the 1978 tour, and I find myself 
wondering just how autobiographical it is.  Bruce stripped images from 
it and turned it into “Drive All Night” on The River, but I prefer it 
here (even if it's so Van Morrison-ish that Bruce should consider an 
Irish accent).  If you don’t listen closely, you’ll miss what a 
dispirited moment it is as well— he feels betrayed, and he’s hurt, even 
mean as it builds.  By the time he yells “STOP!” at 10:40, “Backstreets”
 is a much more complex tune then when it started, and its narrator is 
far less of a puncher’s chance hero.  Even after twelve minutes, the 
band has the strength to nail the ending, which is played for maximum 
drama, features a terrific, tricky little chord progression at the end 
(G-C-Am-F-D-D7) to get back to the original riff, and leaves the crowd 
completely spent.<br>
<br>
And he’s STILL not done!  He calls out Roy again, and it’s time for 
Rosie.  The crowd starts calling for it by name at 13:35 in 
“Backstreets,” even though they sound completely exhausted.  Listen how 
quiet they are— you can hear individual people yelling like you couldn’t
 before.  It sounds like Bruce is having technical issues— he’s 
uncharacteristically absent (is that Clarence trying to banter on his 
turned-down mic?) and then you can hear him plug in his guitar (always 
put your amp on standby before you plug in, Bruce), and finally, over 
two hours after he started, Bruce is ready to start closing the show.<br>
<br>
If you’re still reading, chances are I have nothing to add to your 
appreciation of “Rosalita.”  The live take from Phoenix ’78 that MTV 
played every 45 minutes in the 80s totally drew me in every time-- I 
know this song backwards and forwards.  Back when MTV first started, and
 they only showed about 25 different videos, they would sometimes show 
the live “Rosalita” right before or after Meatloaf’s “Paradise By The 
Dashboard Light.”  They were both live performance clips (though the 
Meatloaf one was on a soundstage and lip-synched), featured similar 
lighting, and were epic in length.  And I feel like watching them back 
to back taught me everything I needed to know about how to decode 
authentic rock n roll from posturing.  Those two videos are a crash 
course in what and what not to do in a rock n roll band.  Close your 
eyes and remember those clips-- who do you believe, Springsteen or 
Meatloaf?  (And a quick thank you to Karla DeVito for speeding along 
puberty a tiny bit.) *<br>
<br>
Two more quick things— I also think this is the last tour when Bruce 
bragged about his lack of education— he introduces Bittan as “the only 
member of the group with a high school diploma.”  By the time he writes 
Nebraska, his lack of education is no longer a badge of honor for him.  
And did you hear the band play “Macho Man” for five seconds when Bruce 
introduces Clarence?  Pretty hilarious, even to Bruce: “I was afraid of 
that.”<br>
<br>
When Rosie finally takes her bow, the band says goodnight, and 
amazingly, Bruce then leads them back out for another thirty minutes.  
It’s totally fun— a sweet “4th Of July, Asbury Park” with unapologetic 
accordion (and absurdly loud castanets), a muscular “Born To Run” with 
sincere thanks to Cleveland, a burning cover of Eddie Floyd’s “Raise 
Your Hand,” and a totally unnecessary, 
if-you-really-want-one-more-then-OK “Twist And Shout.”  <br>
<br>
It’s a generous encore, and totally fun, but Bruce has already made his 
point earlier in the night.  This 1978 tour is not just a history of 
Springsteen’s career, but also Bruce’s attempt to communicate how he 
feels as he stares at turning thirty.  The Agora concert is not unlike a
 rock n roll version of The Great Gatsby, with Springsteen embodying not
 the doomed, self-invented title character, but Gatsby’s narrator, Nick 
Carraway— a spy in enemy country who is also turning thirty, desperate 
to hold onto his youthful belief in “infinite hope,” and trying to chase
 down the hypocrisies not just in his peers, and in his country but, 
most painfully, himself.  Compare Nick’s eulogy on page two that 
foreshadows Gatsby’s fall— “Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it 
is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his 
dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows 
and short-winded elations of men” — to Springsteen’s “Baby this town 
rips the bones from your back / It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap / 
We gotta get out while we're young /`Cause tramps like us, baby we were 
born to run.” In both, there’s a sinister hegemony lurking out in the 
darkness that wants to claim us, that has already defined us by our 
class, or our race, or our background, and the only way to evade it is 
to acknowledge and face it, and then be willing to leave it behind, 
consequences be damned.<br>
<br>
So, yeah, it’s a pretty great show.  I still believe in the power of 
live music to change us.  So go see a band soon— it’s good for you.</div>

<br>
Darkness on the Edge of Town taught me to understand my dad long after we stopped speaking.<br>
Sept. 18, 2012, <br>
BUZZFEED<br>
<br>
Sady Doyle</strong><br>
<br>
There was a moment at my father’s house that I always waited for. It was
 a matter of calibration; of counting the number of beers. Too few and 
he was sarcastic, angry, on edge; he shouted or mocked, it was better to
 keep your distance. Too many and he went quiet, locked away in his own 
impenetrable sadness. I wanted the hour in the middle. The moment he 
picked out which record he would play.<br>
“Now, your old dad,” he started – he always started just like this – 
“you might think he don’t know too much. But you’re lucky, because your 
Dad’s cool. And you’re gonna be cool, too. Your old Dad, he knows his 
rock and roll. Now, this record here…”<br>
<br>
If you want an introduction to Darkness on the Edge of Town, start here.
 My father, in the golden hour when his light comes through, choosing 
from Neil, Bruce, Dylan, Lou – usually Bruce, always Bruce; after enough
 beers, he’ll tell me that my first word was “Bruce” – one of his 
records. Getting ready to teach you his rock and roll.<br>
I abandoned my father when I was sixteen. I call it what it is, 
abandonment, because I believe that when you’ve done something cruel, 
you ought to name it. I didn’t do it out of rage – though there was 
that: at his racism, at his sexism, at his drinking, which I knew I 
would watch him die from if I didn’t walk away first, at his own 
dangerous and sudden rages – or even a desire to hurt him. It was just a
 piece of my heart going dead, a total lack of feeling. I stopped 
speaking to him, stopped visiting him, and stopped taking his calls. The
 calls came for ten years. And then they stopped, too.<br>
But we never really lose people. They come back, most often through the 
things they’ve loved, giving us pieces of what they kept in their heads,
 their private myths. It was ten years later, when the calls stopped, 
that I started listening to Darkness on the Edge of Town.<br>
<br>
There are lots of well-known facts, about Darkness. It was where Bruce 
declared himself as an artist; he tormented his crew, spending several 
weeks of ten-hour days trying to make the drums have a sound that he 
could hear only “in his head,” insanely yelling “STICK” whenever he 
could hear one hit the kit. He wrote over seventy songs, and recorded 
over fifty of them, for a ten-song, forty-three minute album. He wanted a
 “tone poem,” a specific, “relentless” mood; he cut against his pop 
impulses, listening to punk and country to get the colors just right.<br>
<br>
And all the colors are black. Darkness on the Edge of Town is the most 
successful example I can name, outside of Blue Velvet, of the Midwestern
 Gothic. It has a perfect sense of place, though most of its places are 
imaginary: I can’t find a “Waynesboro County” for Bruce to drive across 
the line of in “The Promised Land,” though there are Waynesboros in 
Mississippi, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Similarly, when he’s driving 
“that dusty road from Monroe to Angeline,” he could be starting from any
 number of Monroes, but there’s no Angeline to get to. Still, Darkness 
names its territory in the opening lines: “Lights out tonight. Trouble 
in the heartland.” It’s always “tonight,” in these songs. And it’s 
always “the heartland,” a vast, empty Midwestern landscape – in most of 
the songs, the characters are driving, on roads where you can drive 
“till dawn without another human being in sight” – that mirrors the 
bleak, dark, violently troubled hearts of the small-time, small-town 
criminals and losers it portrays.<br>
Bruce would come back here, for Nebraska, where his characters were 
openly murderous, and again for his later work, all hopped up on 
Steinbeck and ready to Uplift the Working Man. But Darkness has neither 
the self-conscious artiness of Nebraska nor the socially conscious 
cheese of late Springsteen. The alienation here is more Freud than Marx:
 “Don’t look at my face! DON’T LOOK AT MY FACE,” Bruce howls, on 
“Streets of Fire,” so incapable of solidarity that even eye contact 
feels intrusive. He introduces a factory only to tell us about a 
gruesome accident on the floor. This is why the record works, where his 
later attempts don’t; he doesn’t condescend to his characters. Poverty 
is just another way to establish the sense they all have of being 
trapped and desperate; the Working Man is just as depressed as anyone 
else.<br>
<br>
The men of Darkness are invariably Byronic, outcasts, on fire with 
emotion intense enough to illuminate the landscape like lightning. 
They’ve always done something horrible, are chased through song after 
song by unnameable regrets; they have “sins” to wash off their hands, 
they need something “forgotten or forgiven,” but whatever it was, they 
can’t say it aloud. “Everybody’s got a secret, son,” one tells us, 
“something they just can’t face.” They can only keep driving, in the 
hope of leaving it behind.<br>
The first draft of the funereal “Racing in the Streets” had “no girl in 
it,” Bruce says. But there aren’t really any girls on Darkness, outside 
of the eyeball-melting femme fatal in “Candy’s Room.” There are only 
references to women. And these women are mostly lingering 
disappointments or aching losses, out on the periphery. Or, worse, 
they’re the silent, attentive, infantile “babies” and “little darlings” 
Bruce is always lecturing, as on “Badlands.” You better get it straight,
 darling: “Poor man wanna be rich! Rich man wanna be king!” And woman, 
no matter what her income, wanna sit there and listen to her boyfriend 
explain class struggle, apparently.<br>
But all this man-to-man struggle has a point. No matter what the men on 
Darkness are, they are never fathers. “Daddy” shows up twice. Once on 
“Factory,” where he’s a slightly pathetic servant to “mansions of pain.”
 And again, on the album’s centerpiece.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen, I discovered after ten years of estrangement from my 
father, had written the world’s best song about being estranged from 
your father. “Adam Raised a Cain” is one long, Plath-worthy scream: 
hatred, contempt, pain, hatred, shot through with a love that is almost 
romantic. We were prisoners of love, a love in chains. He was standing 
in the door, I was standing in the rain, with the same hot blood burning
 in our veins. How is that not a scene from The Notebook? But these men 
can only ever hurt each other: Daddy worked his whole life for nothing 
but the pain. Now he walks these empty rooms looking for something to 
blame. And his son reflects the blame back onto him, intensified and 
sharper.<br>
Cain isn’t a girl, but the listener can be. It was here, on this song, 
that I stopped listening to Bruce as if he were my father’s voice, and 
started hearing my own.<br>
When your heart goes dead, it’s always for a reason; something hurts too
 much to feel. It happens a lot to addicts. No-one can watch that story 
play out to the end.<br>
Which Bruce knew. It’s the truth he named his album after. It closes, 
Darkness, on the title track. A man alone, underneath the bridge, on the
 hill, “‘cause I can’t stop,” he says. And for the privilege of not 
stopping, he’ll pay any price: “I lost my money, and I lost my wife. 
Them things don’t seem to matter much to me now.” But the girl he’s lost
 is still out there, somewhere. She could even come to find him. “If she
 wants to see me,” Bruce yells, and I cry, every time, “you can tell her
 that I’m easily found.” He even gives the location. “Tell her: There’s a
 darkness on the edge of town.” But that’s the thing. She already knows.
 She’s always known. It’s why she’s not there.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Glory Day: On Aug. 9, 1978, there was no stopping the Boss and his band at the Cleveland Agora<br>
<br>
By John Soeder, The Plain Dealer <br>
The Plain Dealer <br>
 Nov. 12, 1999</strong><br>
<br>
When Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band perform Sunday and Monday 
at Gund Arena, they'll be hard-pressed to top their legendary show of 
Aug. 9, 1978, at the Cleveland Agora. The 1,200 fans who packed the 
landmark venue in its old location on E. 24th St. were treated to a 
22-song marathon of old favorites and then-new tunes from the "Darkness 
on the Edge of Town" album.<br>
Broadcast live on WMMS FM/100.7 to mark the radio station's 10th 
anniversary, the free show was simulcast in seven Midwest markets, 
reaching an estimated 3 million listeners. The widely bootlegged concert
 captures the Boss and his crackerjack band at the height of their 
powers, making a rare club appearance in the midst of their first major 
arena tour.<br>
What follows is a blow-by-blow account of that unforgettable night by a 
few fortunate eyewitnesses who were there - as well as one serious 
Springsteen devotee who wishes he had been.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kid Leo,</strong> WMMS disc jockey: 
Obviously, 'MMS was going to be the sponsor because we broke 
Springsteen. Cleveland gave him a foothold in middle America. It was the
 first city that embraced him outside the Tri-state area.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">John Gorman,</strong> WMMS program director:
 That was the summer Dennis Kucinich had the vote recall. The mayor and 
city council were snarling at each other like dogs. Cleveland was 
sliding into default. The Springsteen concert was such an amazing high 
at the time, considering everything else was going south - and fast. As 
crazy as it sounds, rock 'n' roll was one of the few salvations in this 
city.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Hank LoConti Sr</strong>., Agora owner: 'MMS
 gave away the tickets. People actually slept on the sidewalk the night 
before because it was a general-admission show. They wanted to be right 
up front. These four guys brought a lamp, sleeping bags, everything. I 
ran an extension cord out to them so they could hook up their lamp.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Chuck Crow</strong>, Agora bartender (and 
now Plain Dealer photographer): People were waiting to get in when I 
showed up for work. Someone offered me $100 for a ticket.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim Kluter,</strong> one of the hardcore 
fans known as the Cleveland Boys: Bruce used to give us 20, 30 tickets. 
To make a long story short, we went to Asbury Park in 1976. We caught 
wind that he was playing a benefit softball game. One thing led to 
another and Bruce asked us to play. He invited us back the following 
weekend. We stayed at his house. To us, he was just a regular guy 
hanging out with regular guys.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">John Gorman</strong>: It was very important 
to us that everything ran smoothly. We didn't want a situation where a 
left channel cut out or a cue was missed. That would have made us look 
bush-league. Leo and I were very nervous.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kid Leo:</strong> Nervous? Oh, no. This was a
 celebration. I remember taking a tray of my mom's lasagna to Bruce and 
the band before the show. Bruce goes, "What are you, nuts? I can't eat 
this. You see what I do. Do you think I could do that weighed down with 
lasagna?" While Bruce objected, the band cleared out the whole tray. 
There was none left.<br>
<br>
Kid Leo got the crowd's attention with the following introduction: 
"Ladies and gentlemen, the main event. Round for round, pound for pound,
 there ain't no finer band around - Bruce Springsteen and the E Street 
Band!" They came out swinging with a cover of "Summertime Blues" that 
went directly into a knockout rendition of "Badlands."<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">John Gorman: </strong>The segue from 
"Summertime Blues" to "Badlands" was like launching a rocket. It was 
powerful. Each song just kept building and building and building.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Chuck Crow:</strong> It was the best version
 of "Badlands" I ever heard. I recall Bruce singing and a sea of hands 
clapping in front of him. I sat on the bar right next to the stage. We 
didn't serve during the show. I think they didn't want all that noise in
 the background because of the radio broadcast.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Sam Kopper,</strong> radio broadcast 
producer: Jimmy Iovine handled the music mix. He was Springsteen's 
producer. That was the first time I saw Springsteen live. I was blown 
away. I had seen James Brown and he surely deserved his moniker as "the 
hardest working man in show business." But when I saw Springsteen, I 
realized the mantle had been passed.<br>
The performance continued at a breakneck pace with "Spirit in the 
Night," "Darkness on the Edge of Town," "Factory," "The Promised Land," 
"Prove It All Night" and "Racing in the Street." Two of Springsteen's 
most popular songs, "Thunder Road" and "Jungleland" (complete with a 
cameo by the Cleveland Boys), closed the first half of the concert.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Hank LoConti Sr</strong>.: Bruce put on a 
fantastic show. It's the best I've ever seen him. The first time he 
played the Agora in '74, he maybe drew 500, 600. Four years later, he 
packed the place.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kid Leo:</strong> It was electric. The crowd, the band, the walls - the whole setting was electric.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">John Gorman:</strong> The crowd knew it was 
witnessing history. It would have to be one of the best crowds 
Springsteen has ever played to. You could feel the emotions going back 
and forth. The audience and the band were both having fun. The vibes 
were going both ways. There was a connection.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim Kluter:</strong> We ended up sitting in 
the second row. There was an iron I-beam above the stage. During the 
show, Bruce swung across it from one end to the other. He dropped right 
in front of me and Joe and stuck the microphone in our faces in the 
middle of "Jungleland." We sang the line: "Explode into rock 'n' roll 
bands."<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Joe Juhasz,</strong> member of the Cleveland
 Boys: We were way off-key. I'm sure it wasn't planned. If it wasn't us,
 it would've been someone else. Everyone was singing along. It was so 
loud between the crowd and the band.<br>
After an intermission, the instrumental "Paradise by the 'C' kicked off 
the second half of the show - "Round Two," as Springsteen put it. 
"Fire," "Sherry Darling" and a medley of "Not Fade Away," "Gloria" and 
"She's the One" followed.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">John Gorman</strong>: The band just clicked.
 They were talking to each other onstage. It was raw emotion. Every 
single band member was right on. Everybody was reading everybody else's 
mind.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Joe Juhasz:</strong> They always give 100 
percent. That night, they gave more. The songs were tighter and the 
solos were excellent. Max Weinberg was just crazy on the drums. Clarence
 Clemons was right on, too.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Mary Polcyn,</strong> future wife of 
Cleveland Boy Joe Juhasz and fan in her own right: Clarence pulled me 
onstage to dance. I didn't feel too good. We had a party at our bungalow
 in Parma the day before and the band came. That's why Bruce said, 
"Cleveland Boys, a little party noise" at the beginning of "Sherry 
Darling."<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">John Gorman:</strong> One thing went wrong. 
Clarence had a portable Nakamichi stereo. Somebody stole it from his 
hotel room. He was (angry). But it never showed in his performance. 
Springsteen even made a joke about it during "Growin' Up."A 13-minute 
version of "Growin' Up" found Springsteen in classic storytelling mode 
for a rock 'n' roll parable that came to be known as "Teenage Werewolf."
 He related how, en route to meet his maker, he ran into Kid Leo: "I go,
 'Kid, what are you doing?' He says, 'Praying for more watts. I gotta 
blast this baby all the way to New Jersey!'<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">John Gorman</strong>: I never saw Leo cry. 
But that's probably the closest he ever came. I was standing with him 
when Springsteen said that. Leo was in shock.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Charles Cross</strong>, founding editor of 
Backstreets fanzine: Springsteen's raps combined poetry and pop culture 
in this unique way. That's one of the problems with the current tour. 
Bruce isn't telling enough stories. The few stories he does tell are the
 same every night. Back in '78, he was making this stuff up on the 
spot."Backstreets" (dedicated to the Cleveland Boys) and a giddy version
 of "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" brought the second set to an 
over-the-top climax. A nearly hoarse Springsteen and the indefatigable E
 Street ensemble returned to the stage for encores of "4th of July, 
Asbury Park (Sandy)," "Born to Run," "Because the Night" and "Raise Your
 Hand." "I'd like to thank Cleveland for supporting us," Springsteen 
told the audience. "When we first came here, we got some respect." At 
12:15 a.m., more than four hours after it began, the marathon 
performance ended with a surprise cover of "Twist and Shout."<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kid Leo:</strong> After "Raise Your Hand," 
Sam Kopper wanted to sign off. I said, "I'm telling you. Listen to that 
crowd. He's gonna come back." Sam said, "No, he ain't. If you're not 
gonna sign off, I'm gonna sign off." So I read the credits. As soon as 
we were off the air, Bruce came back out and did "Twist and Shout." It 
didn't make the broadcast. But there are copies of it out there because 
the tape kept running.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Joe Juhasz</strong>: I saw Clarence 
backstage after the show. He was soaked with sweat. I remember looking 
at Jimmy. We just shook our heads. We were exhausted just from watching 
them.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Hank LoConti Sr</strong>.: They knew they put on a good show. Bruce was very satisfied.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">John Gorman:</strong> One of the greatest 
compliments I ever got was from Bob Seger a few years later. He said, 
"Man, I heard the concert you guys put on with Springsteen. That was the
 greatest rock 'n' roll show I ever heard." If it were put out today as a
 live album, I think it would outsell the live collection that 
Springsteen put out in '86.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kid Leo:</strong> That concert is probably 
one of the biggest-selling bootlegs, both on vinyl and now on CD, in the
 large catalog of Springsteen bootlegs. People who don't know me from 
Cleveland recognize my name because they have the bootleg. Everything 
just clicked that night. It was a special point in Bruce's career. He 
was coming off "Born to Run," which had made him an American icon. It 
was like, can he follow it up? And he did.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Charles Cross</strong>: I wasn't there. But 
through the magic of bootlegging, I feel like I was. In the annals of 
Springsteen shows, it was one of the most dynamic he ever did. He was 
just on fire that year. When we talk about the best shows that Bruce and
 the band are doing today, which are quite good, they still don't come 
close to the ferocity of '78. People think Bruce was always as big as he
 is now. He wasn't. He was a minor act on Columbia Records who was in 
danger of being dropped. The success he had came from his live shows. 
And that Cleveland show was one of the best.</div>

<br>
Cynthia Rose, History of Rock, The, 1984</strong><br>
<br>
In the heyday of Elvis, Chuck Berry or the Beatles, radio was revered. 
It constituted rock’n’roll’s channel to the teen heart, and it struck 
out into the very soul of a sprawling America. Radio could reach 
everywhere, from the rural outlands to the inner city. Radio exposure 
primed the juke-boxes of diners, soda fountains and truck stops. And it 
was rock’n’roll radio that baptised the ears of the first folks who 
asserted in print that music could matter, as well as entertain.<br>
<br>
In the Eighties, however, those same commentators bemoaned a supposition
 that radio success spelled mediocrity, banality, formulae, a mightily 
increased dose of plain old bribery. There was also the question of 
fashion. Critics have traditionally tended to disapprove of music that 
gained mass radio success, since they must thereby relinquish the 
privilege of introducing people to it. But the equation of large-scale 
success with a lowest common denominator has become all but entrenched 
in printed evaluations of music. And this prejudice was a prime factor 
in the creation of ‘blue-collar rock’.<br>
<br>
Collars and dollars<br>
<br>
‘Blue-collar rock’ is a critical term disseminated by various rock 
critics who possess ‘white-collar’ credentials and experience. It was 
coined to deal with a number of American artists who were selling 
solidly, and had achieved somewhat heroic stature, all with 
‘traditional’ rock songs whose lyrics featured girls, cars, rebellion 
and the radio. The radio provided platinum hits for three such 
performers — Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty and Bob Seger.<br>
<br>
Several supposed similarities linked these artists. They lacked ‘proper’
 (white-collar) educations. Their smarts were street smarts, their 
language limited to that of the truck stop, shopping mall or suburban 
housing tract. They were rough and ready rockers in the guise of 
people’s heroes — spokesmen and role models for the little guy and his 
girl.<br>
<br>
It is a glib assessment at best, but one that often proceeds from an 
educational viewpoint which is far more cerebral and far less a matter 
of practical, direct experience than that which is common to the 
‘blue-collar rockers’ themselves. With a few notable exceptions, the 
rock writer tends to have a college degree and is not likely to be the 
son or daughter of an assembly-line worker, waitress or small-town, 
small-time businessman.<br>
<br>
Rock’n’roll, by contrast, has always renewed its vigour from raw (black)
 America and neither ‘education’ nor ‘culture’ has contributed much to 
its cyclical evolution. Its greatest pioneers have not been thinkers but
 poets. Traditionally, self-expression has been the poor American’s 
religion and his passport to Somewhere.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s Dad earned his living in a plastics factory, as a bus 
driver and a prison guard; Tom Petty’s father (now a widower) is a 
disabled, retired insurance salesman. Neither endorsed their sons’ 
attempts to escape by mastering the magic that radio had filtered into 
their younger lives. Yet it was to the promises beamed out by the radio 
that these white Americans pledged their allegiance. They remain 
defenders of the faith, committed to the original populism and dream of 
unity they recognized in the music of their youth.<br>
<br>
"In America," Tom Petty commented in the Eighties, "the press still 
don’t sell records — records sell because of the radio. And today it’s 
real sick about what they call AOR radio — they just won’t play black 
music. I mean, old Jimi Hendrix maybe, but they seem to think if they 
play Marvin Gaye people ain’t gonna listen, it’s gonna wreck their 
ratings… it’s getting so limited and you only hear one sound, 
loud-guitars, pretty formulated. We’ve tried to ignore it but even any 
of our stuff with a funkier sound they won’t touch.<br>
<br>
"But I prefer the idea of buying a record because I’ve heard and liked 
it," he asserts firmly, "rather than because somebody told me to buy it.
 You know, kids may go nuts over Bruce or nuts over us but it’s all the 
same old music, the music’s always been there. We grew up hearin’ all 
these classic American musics, and our basic theory is just to take 
these sounds and keep on mixing ‘em up and pouring ‘em out and each time
 get a different stew.<br>
<br>
"What I heard in the Drifters, in all that great radio music," Bruce 
Springsteen says, "was the promise of something else. Not a politician’s
 promise, y’know, that everything is gonna be alright … that would be a 
false promise anyway. I mean the promise of possibilities: the promise 
that the search and the struggle matter, that they affirm your life. 
That was the original spirit of rock’n’roll. And that’s what I hope we 
carry on, a message that no one, nothing has the right to tell you you 
gotta forfeit your hopes and your dreams."<br>
<br>
Love and marriage<br>
<br>
Petty has always couched the majority of his music in the love-song 
format ("it’s the easiest for hooking someone in"). He has also been 
married for five years ("I have a good marriage now and, believe me, I 
haven’t always") and has two children. Marriage — ‘the ties that bind’ —
 is a theme Sprigsteen felt ready to face only on The River (1980). 
"When I was writing the early songs," he demurs, "the girl was still a 
part of it, she was just part of the future. But she was always there, 
that was always there, because it’s simply a basic human need".<br>
<br>
"There’s a hunger for that relationship," he will say, shaking his head.
 "But my characters, they’re wrestling with the fact that it’s so hard 
now to separate traditions of love and possession, romance and 
relationships, from the realities of those things today. It’s a puzzle 
to me, because the desire to become truly involved is as strong as 
anything about freedom. It’s a basic reality of how people are."<br>
<br>
Neither Petty nor Springsteen has ever cared to be more fashionable, 
more educated, more ‘influential’ outside the rock’n’roll arena. The 
primary attentions of each have gone to their music, their bands, their 
fans — and the battle to, as Petty puts it, "evolve your own art, which 
is the thing you always have to do, painful or not". Each has weathered 
extended legal battles to ensure maximum personal control of that 
evolution; just as each has endured performing and recording layoffs as a
 result.<br>
<br>
All this occurred, however, at a time when rock was no longer a 
revolution but a distraction and a diversion. It was also a time when 
economic stress placed the radio listener’s life at the furthest 
possible remove from that of the ‘star’. The thing Petty, Springsteen 
and Seger really share is a stubborn determination to continue making 
music that really matters, which is not just content to reflect 
contemporary life, but offers a criticism of it and provides an 
alternative viewpoint.<br>
<br>
Like Springsteen’s songs, Petty’s work places tenacity in opposition to 
the ever-threatening ‘darkness’ (meaninglessness or irrational chaos) of
 modernity. It supports the confused listener, promising ‘You Can Still 
Change Your Mind’, exhorting against ‘A Wasted Life’. "I know you have 
to feel a little used up/And no one can give you enough/Baby hold on 
tight/Don’t have a wasted life/I love you too much/Don’t have a wasted 
life". And a song like Petty’s "The Same Old You" or Springsteen’s 
"Highway Patrolman", is addressed to nothing less than America itself.<br>
<br>
I have a dream…<br>
<br>
‘Highway Patrolman’ is the set-piece of Springsteen’s Nebraska (1982), 
the album that symbolised his willful independence from entrepreneurial 
guides such as producer Jon Landau and critic Dave Marsh, two of the 
numerous fan-supporters who had guided him to superstar status. Nebraska
 renders the state of American disunion more directly and effectively 
than anything since the era of the Vietnam War and the writing of 
Hendrix, Fogerty, Sly Stone, the MC5, the Band and Dylan. But it 
evolves, it is clear, from a struggle with that riddle central to the 
title track of the earlier The River: "Is a dream a lie that don’t come 
true/Or is it something worse?" What forces that issue is the central 
tenet of Springsteen’s belief: this land is all our land.<br>
<br>
The protagonists of the stark, unembellished Nebraska are largely losers
 — not just losers in love but in life. The fact that their belief 
remains resilient, even as traditions and natural justice fail, offers 
the only light at the end of a long tunnel: "Struck me kinda funny/Funny
 yeah indeed/How at the end of every hard earned day/People find some 
reason to believe" (‘Reason To Believe’). Ostensibly — particularly to 
British critics — ‘Highway Patrolman’ is simply the story of one erring 
brother as told by his law-abiding elder. To American listeners, scarred
 by the generational battles and loss of faith the Vietnam and Watergate
 eras initiated, and in many areas battered by recession, it has far 
wider connotations. The ‘brotherhood’ alluded to is the one Springsteen 
believes should be shared by all people, the same dream explicitly 
espoused for America 20 years before by Dr Martin Luther King.<br>
<br>
The rock dreams of Springsteen and Petty are not new but eternal, not 
revivalist, just anchored in emotions which never faded, and have now 
been re-articulated. Like Fogerty or Chuck Berry or Hendrix or Elvis 
himself, neither Petty nor Springsteen were born ‘Fortunate Sons’. The 
message behind their music is a vision which wears no collar and knows 
no colour… and has never been extinguished.<br>
