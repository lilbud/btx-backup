Bruce Springsteen’s music and performances have provided an emotional 
outlet for thousands of fans all over the world. Using the statements of
 these fans, as well as the life and music of Springsteen, this paper 
documents the reasons why, as well as the ways in which fans are 
inspired to create a community. This community reflects both their 
emotional and spiritual attachment as well as their attempts to live 
according to the moral precepts they find through this music. 
Springsteen himself has laid the groundwork for this community through 
his words, music, and deeds. To many, these feelings and values are as 
valid and alive as any other spiritual tradition, and are a legitimate 
spiritual outlet.<br>
<br>
The thoughts and actions of these fans, and the motivating forces behind
 them, allow a glimpse into how nontraditional spiritual values can be 
formed and acted on outside the gates of what is normally seen as 
conventional church-going behavior. By acknowledging the legitimacy of 
personal spiritual connection outside a sectarian landscape, it is hoped
 that appreciation and tolerance for different belief systems and system
 formations can be cultivated and nourished.<br>

“May your faith give us faith, may your hope give us hope...”</em><br>
<br>
(Into the Fire, 2002) <br>
<br>
<br>
Living in Upstate New York in 1999, I was already a card-carrying member
 of AARP, and far removed from the rockin’ and rollin’ days of my youth,
 when I could spend days on end listening and dancing to rock music. But
 one blustery winter’s day while walking down Main Street something 
caught my eye. The poster in the music store window was advertising 
tickets for Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band’s first show 
together in fourteen years. Seeing this, I remembered that moment twenty
 four years before when I first ‘discovered’ Bruce, as his fans 
familiarly refer to him. The album was Born to Run, and the poetry and 
imagery had overwhelmed me with its emotion and understanding. But life 
moves on, babies are born, and life and locale changes. After seeing him
 in concert once in 1975, I gave little thought to either the man or the
 music over the course of the next two decades. Life got in the way as 
it always does, and the demands of job, home and family, as well as 
living in remote areas of the country where rock artists did not tend to
 tour, superseded concert attendance. Thirty plus years went by like a 
fading memory. But something pulled at me when I saw this poster, and I 
decided to buy tickets and go eventhough I had long since given up 
attending rock concerts. I dutifully lined up at the appointed 
ticket-buying time and waited in line with thirty or so other people 
that morning to get my two ducats to the show – no mean feat as I later 
came to realize.<br>
<br>
Three months later I found myself in an arena with many thousands of 
other fans, with a dawning realization that I was a novice among 
acolytes. In spite of the fact that Bruce had not toured with this band 
in fourteen years, everyone seemed to know all the songs, participating 
as a group in a display of gestures and call-and-response to the 
performance. The anthropologically-inclined side of me saw this as 
‘interesting’ while the emotionally hungry side felt the meaning and 
emotion in the building. Something was happening here. I was overwhelmed
 and nearly speechless by Mr. Springsteen’s performance as well as the 
lyrical content of his songs. I passed the three hours enthusiastically 
and then headed home, dodging the deer on the interstate and mulling 
over every nuance of the evening..<br>
I spent some time reflecting about the emotions that the concert evoked 
within me, and came to no real conclusions other than the rather trite 
‘music is the universal language’ kind of thing. Some time shortly after
 this show, I read that Springsteen and company were playing a show in 
Charlotte, North Carolina. I had a friend who lived in North Carolina, 
and so I called her and asked her to get us tickets for the event. She 
and I went, and again, I experienced a sense of wonder at the amount of 
emotion that flooded me, emotion that I at first wrote off as contagious
 enthusiasm. In fact, only one other ‘public’ experience in my life even
 came close to resembling my Springsteen experience, and that was a 
Billy Graham Crusade I attended as a young teen. Springsteen’s music and
 words spoke to me, to some inner longing, as much as Billy Graham had 
some forty years earlier, and this was both intriguing and mystifying. I
 had never been a ‘joiner,’ never been really passionate about anything.
 I listened to this man sing:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“I believe in the love that you gave me, I believe in the faith that can save me,<br>
I believe in the hope and I pray That someday it may raise me Above these badlands...<br>
For the ones who had a notion, a notion deep inside That it ain’t no sin to be glad you’re alive”</em><br>
<br>
 (Badlands, 1978)<br>
<br>
I felt some emotional cog slip into place feeling a part of something 
bigger than myself, something bigger than that room with 18,000 people 
in it, but something that included all of us there. How do you put a 
name to this feeling, to this communion? This man was singing to the 
audience, not at them; the audience was the “you” in the song. Bruce was
 singing our shared experiences and emotions, creating a common frame of
 reference that was inclusive of all of us in the arena. Yes, he told us
 in song, I have felt that despair, but look! There’s hope here too... I
 found myself suddenly seeing the audience as comrades, fellow travelers
 on this rocky road called life. “<em class="text-italics">No retreat, baby, no surrender”</em> (No Surrender 1986). <br>
<br>
Without ever having exchanged a word with another fan, I knew we were 
sharing something meaningful and potent even if I could not name that 
feeling.<br>
<br>
And I felt just as surely that the man singing on stage was being not 
only honest and straight-forward, but also completely sincere and 
earnest. After this show I began to comb the internet to see what I 
could find out about the man Bruce Springsteen, to verify the 
impressions I felt. I wanted to know why he gave me hope, and if this 
was something others felt, or if I was suffering from some sort of 
mid-life crisis of faith, or simply slipping into early-onset dementia. 
It was during this process that I began to have some idea of the 
vastness and depth of the Springsteen community. I discovered websites 
where one could obtain unofficial copies of live concerts (“not for sale
 – trade only”), get<br>
<br>
advance notification of ticket sales for shows, buy or sell tickets 
(“face value only”), discuss my favorite song or the quality of my day, 
and even find a brownie recipe (“use miniature marshmallows ONLY”). Here
 were people who were sharing their lives, in varying degrees, with each
 other on the basis of nothing more tangible than an interest in a 
musician. I was as welcome in this community as in any church 
congregation of which I had ever been a part.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“Come on up for The Rising...”</em>	<br>
.<br>
(The Rising, 2002) <br>
<br>
<br>
The September 11, 2001 tragedy may eventually claim to be the 
inspiration for any number of urban myths; Springsteen can make claim to
 one of those. Legend claims that: <br>
“<em class="text-italics">A few days after 11 September, Bruce 
Springsteen was pulling out of a beach parking lot in the Jersey Shore 
town of Sea Bright when a fan rode by. The man rolled down his window, 
shouted ‘We need you!’ and drove on. It was the kind of moment, 
Springsteen says, that made his career worthwhile. ‘That’s part of my 
job. It’s an honour to find that place in the audience’s life  And I 
thought, well, I've probably been a part of this guy's life for a while,
 and people wanna see other people they know, they wanna be around 
things they're familiar with. So he may need to see me right about now. 
That made me sense, like, 'Oh, I have a job to do.'” </em><br>
<br>
 Shortly after, Springsteen performed on the televised “A Tribute to 
Heroes,” the first of many benefits held to raise money for the 
survivors of that day, singing “My City of Ruins,” a song written about 
Asbury Park, but eerily fitting for the occasion.<br>
<br>
The album The Rising was recorded and released and a promotional world 
tour commenced before the first anniversary of this tragedy. This 
collection of songs focused not on revenge or blind patriotism, but on 
healing the wounds the September 11th attack had left. I found out about
 the tour through the internet sites I had begun to visit, and made 
plans to again attend the Albany, NY show. This time, however, I could 
enlist no one to go with me, and so went alone. To this point in my 
life, I had never attended a concert or theatrical performance alone; 
this was new territory for me. Yet, I went unhesitatingly because I 
wanted to see if that first rush of emotion and feeling I felt in Albany
 could be duplicated, or if it was a fluke; perhaps I had merely been 
caught up in the moment, perhaps it was a singular experience not able 
to be replicated. In the intervening months, I would come to question 
what I had felt, and I needed to test my feelings.<br>
This proved to be a terrific and transforming experience for me. And 
that is what it truly was – an experience - so much more than a rock ’n’
 roll concert. My initial response from two years prior was validated. 
In some fashion, I felt redeemed and forgiven for all my bad life 
decisions. My response was completely emotional and un- intellectual, 
and utterly unexplainable in the moment. I felt in unison with the 
crowd, in communion with the spirit, in sync with the music. This time I
 left wanting more, and not at some distant as yet unscheduled time in 
the future: I wanted it NOW. To feel a part – me, a fifty-three year old
 middle-aged woman – of this joyous, raucous celebration of life, love, 
friendship, and music was an extraordinary encounter, in the very 
literal sense of the word - extraordinary. I experienced transcendence, 
inclusion, and redemption, and a part of the performance. Then I 
realized I wanted to know why I wanted more, and why I felt these 
decidedly spiritual and emotional waves. I needed to know more, to 
understand why.<br>
<br>
Sitting alone in the concert hall, I heard and felt a truth and 
sincerity in the music engulfing me, a truth that touched me in a way no
 other music or musician had ever done. I am a child of the rock and 
roll generation; I cut my teeth to Elvis, learned to drive to the 
Beatles and the Rolling Stones, and had been ‘saved’ by Billy Graham - 
twice. What I felt after seeing Springsteen more clearly resembled the 
raw emotion I felt at the Billy Graham Crusades attended rather than the
 multitude of rock and roll shows seen in the course of the past 
thirty-eight years. I felt this man speaking to my heart, to my life’s 
wins and losses. He identified with my struggles and frustrations, while
 not waiting for me to identify with him, and perhaps that is his talent
 and genius. Bruce places the onus of understanding on himself, and not 
the listener. His job is to convince us that he knows what we know, to 
provide us with hope, and not to ask us to understand him. Sitting 
there, I felt as surely as I knew my own name that this man needed me as
 much as I needed him. Later readings verified his absolute 
acknowledgement of his personal need for audience acceptance and 
approval, as well as his feelings of insecurity and displacement as an 
adolescent; but his performance said it all. He was able to articulate 
all the angst and frustrations of life, while offering the gift that 
there is always hope,<em class="text-italics"> “that faith will be rewarded, dreams will not be thwarted”</em> (Land of Hope and Dreams, 2001). And I accepted his covenant of faith - “<em class="text-italics">you be true to me and I’ll be true to you</em>”
 (Be True, 1988) - baptized in the flames of the fiery ministry of rock 
and roll. My conversion was completed that night; I believed him when he
 said <em class="text-italics">“Grab your suitcase and your ticket, thunder’s rollin’ down the track”</em>
 (Land of Hope and Dreams, 2001). I was now a devout, devoted “Tramp,” 
(as the faithful refer to themselves, taken from the line “<em class="text-italics">tramps like us, baby we were born to run”</em> from the Springsteen song Born to Run, 1975).<br>
<br>
Prior to the Albany concert in December 2002, I knew that one of the 
Springsteen fan sites – greasylake.org – had planned a get together 
before the show, but I had been too apprehensive and anxious to attend. 
After all, I was already far past prime rockin’ and rollin’ age. I 
believed that most of the attendees would be decades younger than myself
 - weren’t all people who went to rock concerts twenty-three at the 
most? I had noticed older people – my age cohorts – at the shows I 
attended, but I doubted that these were the people haunting the fan 
sites I had been reading. Mature adults do not attend rock concerts and 
meet total strangers in restaurants or bars, or so I thought.<br>
<br>
However, over that winter of 2002-2003, I began to realize that the 
dimensions of devotion to the Springsteen credo and values did not 
exclude my peer group, but rather embraced all age groups, and perhaps 
most especially mine because of the shared historical time (after all, 
we were the same age, Bruce and I). I began reading and posting on 
several websites and cultivated at least an e-relationship with many 
fans. By the end of The Rising tour (all tours tend to be named after 
the album they support), I had attended several fan site organized 
tailgate get-togethers and met dozens of fans of all ages and 
geographical locations. These people were from a variety of lifestyles, 
but almost to a ‘man’ (and yes, the preponderance of fans I met were 
male, contrary to what might be the popular assumption of fans being 
women) they were possessed by the same spirit that I was – the spirit 
cast by a man of conviction, empathy, and intuitive understanding, a 
blue- collar prophet. These traits seemed contagious, and the fans I met
 were trying – each in his or her own way – to exercise the emotions and
 values depicted in Springsteen’s songs.<br>
<br>
At one such gathering of 200-300 fans in August of 2003, I managed to 
collect nearly $3000 for the Second Harvest Food Bank of New Jersey in 
less than an hour. Total strangers were shoving fifty dollar bills into 
my hand. No one asked for receipts, or questioned my motives; for weeks 
after, checks kept arriving in the mail. If you were to ask any of these
 people what made them donate this money to a total stranger, the answer
 would have been something in the vein of “because she’s a fan, she 
wouldn’t deceive us” or some similar sentiment.<br>
<br>
Curious as to why this man and his music could motivate strangers to 
toss money at me, I began to explore Springsteen’s back catalog of 
songs, reading lyrics and listening to album after album. It is all 
there in his lyrics, laid naked for the pilgrim to see: concerns about 
justice and fairness, about friendship and honesty, about rejection and 
personal revelation, and ultimately, redemption. There is little mystery
 about Bruce Springsteen, only stark openness that appears to reveal his
 soul to any and all comers. It would seem that he believes what he 
writes, and further lives what he believes. For thirty- five plus years,
 people have been trying to see ‘behind’ the man, to expose his ugly, 
soft under-belly, and to date no one has. Either he is genuine, or he is
 the all-time absolute best actor. His fans – and I include myself in 
that multitude – have decided he is the ‘real deal.’<br>
<br>
What further intrigued me was the way that Springsteen fans referred to 
the concerts, and to their discovery of his music and fan community; the
 language was that of religion, where fans spoke of “conversions” and 
“redemption,” “epiphanies” and “faith.” Concerts are congregations of 
the faithful gathered in joyous celebration with the Minister of Rock 
and Roll, Bruce Springsteen. To be clear, not one fan I have ever spoken
 with has ever alluded to Springsteen being a deity. Yet the obvious 
fact remains that many fans take away from his music and performances 
much of the feeling and comfort that a traditional worship service 
offers – by their own assertions. Moreover, the connection that 
individual fans feel towards each other mirrors the connections members 
of worship-communities share, and is reflected in a number of group 
activities and actions.<br>
<br>
In the following pages, I illustrate the ways in which Springsteen has 
sown the seeds for this fan community, and laid the groundwork for this 
spiritual ‘home’ the fans have created, influenced by his words, music, 
and deeds. This home works to provide much of the same sorts of 
emotional, social, and spiritual sustenance that traditional worship 
communities offer, as explained and defined by the fans themselves. By 
identifying with the persona of Bruce Springsteen and his working-class,
 ordinary Joe image, fans derive more than entertainment from his 
performances and music, finding faith and inspiration that serves them 
in their daily lives. My approach to this subject uses the 
anthropological notion of an insider, or emic, perspective because of my
 own involvement with, and within, the Springsteen community. Much of 
the information included in this thesis comes from personal experience 
and participant observation, as well as from conversations over the 
years with members of the fan community and concert audiences. In 
particular, two websites that are representative of the fan community 
have been invaluable sources of information: <a href="http://www.greasylake.org/" class="postlink">www.greasylake.org</a> and <a href="http://www.backstreets.com/" class="postlink">www.backstreets.com</a>.
 Fans from all over the world post on these sites that operate as cyber 
bulletin boards and that serve as the locus for much of the social 
activity and fund raising efforts common in the fan community. Using 
participant-observation as my approach and the words of the people 
involved, I also show the ways in which fan admiration and love have 
manifested as charitable actions patterned after the real – or assumed –
 actions of Mr. Springsteen. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">CHAPTER 1-  RELEASING RELIGION</strong><br>
<em class="text-italics"><br>
“We pray for your love, Lord We pray for the lost, Lord We pray for this
 world, Lord We pray for the strength, Lord We pray for the strength, 
Lord”</em><br>
<br>
(My City of Ruins, 2002) <br>
<br>
“Religion” said Dr. Gregory House, on a recent episode of the 
currently-popular television show House, “is a symptom of irrational 
belief and groundless hope.” This fictional persona, House, was 
attempting to diagnose a patient who had recently converted to Hasidic 
Judaism; he considered this conversion to be a symptom of her 
undiagnosed condition, and therefore of diagnostic significance rather 
than spiritual importance (as it turns out, there was no connection 
between the two). As on this show, religion comes at us through all 
mediums these days, whether in the form of fictionalized characters on a
 TV drama, Christian rock on the radio, or televangelists attempting to 
save our souls; it is everywhere. And just as we are assaulted with any 
number and kinds of religious messages daily, so are we confronted with 
multiple concepts of what religion is.<br>
<br>
Clifford Geertz says that religion is a set of symbols that “establish 
powerful, pervasive, and long lasting moods and motivations,” and that 
offer an ultimate explanation of the world (Pals 2006: 270). Durkheim 
says these symbols unite us into “moral communities” where we are 
concerned not simply with our individual well-being, but rather with the
 welfare of the group (Pals 2006: 96). In these days of frozen dinners 
for one, single-cup coffee makers, solitary internet communication, and 
rabid individualism, many people search for that “moral community” and 
sense of belonging. The (institutionalized) Church - regardless of 
religion or denomination - is no longer the sole proprietor of this 
territory - if it ever was - as many seek far and wide for some reason 
to believe, and some place to belong. Various people, it seems, are 
either replacing traditional religion with more meaningful spiritual 
practices or are adding other resources to supplement their traditional 
religion. In the twenty-first century, what theologies, products, and 
forms will offer us solace and spiritual nourishment, what will provide 
us with a sense of community or belonging to something bigger than 
ourselves? What will inspire and challenge us to become better people?<br>
<br>
As institutionalized religious practices become more polarized and 
polarizing, many people find themselves unfulfilled by conventional 
services and rituals. Organized religion has become more, well, 
organized. Formal religion has diminished as a source of comfort and 
inspiration for many people and for some music has stepped in to fill 
the gaps (Lynch 2006). According to a recent survey conducted by the Pew
 Forum on Religion and Public Life, mainline Protestant churches are 
suffering diminishing congregations and more people are declaring 
themselves ‘unaffiliated.’ Church attendance is falling as well as 
participation in the rites and rituals associated with religion such as 
Christenings, baptisms and church weddings (Lynch 2006: 481). And this 
loss is not restricted to Christianity; synagogues and mosques (in 
non-Muslim majority countries) are also suffering (Lynch 2006: 481). 
More than twenty-five percent of the people surveyed have left the faith
 of their family of origin, while twenty-five percent of the adults aged
 eighteen to twenty-nine deny any religious affiliation at all. Among 
the age group that includes most Springsteen fans, ages thirty to 
forty-nine, forty percent claim no religious affiliation (pewforum.org).
 This might help account for the spiritual identification many fans have
 with the music; there is no need to worry about conflicts with church 
dogma or policies if there is no church. But to claim no religious 
affiliation is not the same as claiming no spirituality.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the areas of heaviest fan population in the United States –
 the states of Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, 
Maryland and Virginia - corresponds geographically with those polled who
 self-identified as unaffiliated (pewforum.org). This information is 
submitted anecdotally, and in no way implies that all Northeast corridor
 residents claiming no religious affiliation are Bruce Springsteen fans,
 or the reverse. (Springsteen’s core audience initially was cultivated 
in the bars and clubs on a circuit that extended from Asbury Park north 
through Boston, and south through the beach towns of Virginia; when he 
began recording, it was the radio stations in these areas that were 
responsible for the bulk of airplay he initially received.) However, the
 information/statistics are suggestive.<br>
<br>
There may also be some connection between the lack of official church 
association and the large number of Springsteen fans in Europe, where 
secularization has been the rule rather than the exception – what 
Religion and Ethics Weekly refers to as “Europe’s long and dramatic 
decline in church attendance” (see also Lynch 2006). As Gordon Lynch 
says, “...alternative spiritualities are providing social spaces and 
cultural resources for religious affiliation, identities, and 
meaning-construction beyond the walls of the church, synagogue, or 
mosque (2006:482).” This alternative spirituality carries its 
congregants into the concert hall and the ‘ministry’ of Bruce.<br>
<em class="text-italics"><br>
“I’m just out here searchin’ for my own piece of the cross...”</em><br>
(I’ll Work for Your Love, 2007)<br>
<br>
To ferret out the meaning individuals derive from anything in their 
lives it becomes necessary to focus on action and active involvement. 
Lynch states “...it is inadequate to make inferences about the values 
and beliefs of Western culture simply through studying popular culture 
‘texts’ (2004: 164).” People tend to take the information that they need
 to make a decision or to find personal meaning and make it work for 
them. This interpretation of ‘meaning’ cannot be controlled by the 
producer of the resource used, or manipulated to ‘give’ meaning, but 
rather the meaning may be translated differently (decoded) and 
independently depending on each consumer’s own individual circumstance 
and taste – through a personal lens (Lynch 2004: 163). Stuart Hall calls
 the delivery system by which this information is received - and used 
effectively in popular culture - as “encoding” (Lynch 2004: 163). 
Information is presented in such a way as to extract a particular 
response or interpretation. But during the “decoding” process, the 
‘audience’ or receptor (consumer) decodes the information in a manner 
that best suits them, sometimes creating different meanings than those 
initially intended, meanings that are situationally dependent (Lynch 
2004: 165). Here is where individuals determine what is meaningful for 
them, based on their own personal needs. It is not useful therefore to 
try to interpret these encoded messages without observing the specific 
situation within which the message is delivered, and where the people 
involved decode for themselves. Herein lays the value of participant 
observation and conversation, where one can have the opportunity to 
qualitatively describe the whys and hows of individuals’ actions and 
beliefs based on context, their context.<br>
<br>
Until fairly recently, the domain of assigning appropriate labels to 
cultural/spiritual rites and customs has resided in the academy 
(Chidester 1996:760). Academics and scholars have told us what is and is
 not a “real” religion, what constitutes a cult, and what is simply 
social practice and custom. Other outside attempts (academic and 
scholarly) to identify practices and belief systems as religion have 
been ridiculed and dismissed out of hand (Chidester 1996: 760). Many of 
the new religious movements have been called “cults” and denied the 
status of religion. Instead they have been labeled as “entrepreneurial 
businesses, politically subversive movements, or coercive, mind- 
controlling, and brain-washing ‘cults’ (Chidester 1996: 760).” The 
ordinary man and woman feeling something outside the parameters of 
proscribed “official” religion in unorthodox settings had no way – and 
apparently no authority – to determine or even translate the 
spirituality of these feelings.<br>
<br>
However, recent scholarship and the myriad forms of popular culture have
 challenged this narrow definition of religion. Popular culture – <em class="text-italics">“that which is (or has been) accepted or approved of by large groups of people</em>
 (Forbes 2000: 4)” – can be a conduit into another world (Albanese 1999:
 465), a world where we can explore meanings and meaningfulness for 
ourselves. In these other worlds, we can experience a place of 
transcendence from the trials and travails of ordinary life. Popular 
culture can provide a platform upon which our definitions of religion 
can be expanded and grow to accommodate new ways of ‘believing.’ 
Cultural religion reflects our search for religious experience and our 
need for a feeling of community based on mutual involvement in something
 beyond the traditional definition of religion, as well as our right to 
define “religion” for ourselves (Albanese 1999: 465). Seekers find their
 own way across this landscape, searching for that transcendent moment, 
that feeling of connection and inclusion, that one “<em class="text-italics">...face that ain’t looking through me”</em> (Badlands, 1978).<br>
<br>
David Chidester proposes that religion be classified as an activity that
 is organized and that functions as traditional churches do (1996: 744).
 In this rendering, religion is comprised of symbols and systems of 
symbols that are sacred, and that imbue the world with value for 
‘believers’ that utilize these symbols (Chidester 1996: 744). Chidester 
maintains that the explication of religion is <em class="text-italics">“constantly at stake in the interchanges of cultural discourses and practice</em>s
 (1996: 745),” an attribute that keeps it vital and growing. Chidester’s
 analysis of baseball as religion provides us with a good, working model
 for identifying the Springsteen fan community as a ‘congregation’ using
 this skeletal framework of continuity, uniformity, sacred space, and 
sacred time (1996: 745).<br>
<br>
Looking through this lens, continuity is maintained by the musician’s 
(Springsteen) thirty-five plus year career of thoughtful lyrics and 
public appearances. Steadfastness of viewpoint and delivery as well as 
personal civic activity has created a model of ideals over time with his
 blue-collar/everyman persona, cementing his position as Bard of the 
working class A large part of Springsteen’s audience has been attending 
his shows for most of these thirty-five years, and sharing the memories 
of these shows with other, younger fans maintains the legacy and myths 
that surround Springsteen. Uniformity and a sense of belonging emanate 
from the mutual admiration for Mr. Springsteen, and from the fans’ 
attendance at shows. Fans know that they are in the company of other 
acolytes and trust is established (to varying degrees) around this fact;
 there is a belief that fans all maintain and practice similar core 
values. The concert hall or stadium becomes a place filled with 
like-minded individuals - “tramps” all - joined in mutual admiration and
 trust (again, a reference to the song Born to Run and the line “<em class="text-italics">tramps like us”</em>).
 The concert spot itself represents the sacred space and is similar to 
one’s customary place of worship, a place where all believers are 
welcome. This is also the spot of sacred time and ritual, where 
congregants can celebrate the music itself as well as celebrate in the 
music. To a lesser extent, this sense of ‘home’ can be derived from 
recordings, but the real celebration of faith takes place in the concert
 hall. True believers travel from city to city, attending and 
participating in as many services as possible. Just as outsiders 
unfamiliar with the rituals and responses required of congregants at, 
say, a Catholic worship service may be confounded by the service, so may
 outsiders or non-fans be confounded by the activities of the audience 
during a show. Their performed ‘rituals’ – the pumping of fists during 
“Badlands” or the chorus of oh- oh-oh-oh-ohs sung only by the audience 
during the same song, the audience singing the first verse of “Hungry 
Heart” before the band chimes in - help define and delineate believer 
from non-believer, and affirm and reinforce the “social solidarity of a 
community...meeting personal needs and reinforcing social integration” 
(Chidester 1996: 748). Not coincidentally, in this same article, 
Chidester also speaks about the “...inherently religious character of 
rock ‘n roll” (1996: 753).<br>
<br>
Popular music, in the guise of rock and roll, and its inherent attitude 
of dis- organization and looming chaos has presented some seekers with a
 replacement of or supplement to the community once found through 
religion: Bruce Springsteen and the devoted fan community that surrounds
 him. In many ways this community now functions as both a social network
 and a spiritual community. Much as the organized church has in the 
past, the Springsteen congregation offers belonging and support and 
presents a vehicle for doing “good works.” For numerous fans, the music 
and concert events and pre-concert gatherings offer the same support, 
relief, release, and connection that traditional worship services offer 
their congregations. “Belief systems always rest upon a social 
base...and in modern society the social structures” underpinning 
commitment have moved away from the society at large to smaller units of
 shared experience (Roof 1978: 52). As the church once did, and still 
does for some, the music, person, and concert experience of the audience
 at a Bruce Springsteen concert offers transformation and transcendence 
through the “majesty, the ministry of rock and roll” (Springsteen in 
concert). These are hard things to talk about – the genesis of feelings,
 the origins of emotion and faith, but they cannot be denied because 
there is no scientific measure of meaning, no “big-bang” theory of 
origin. If this were truly the case, no one could ever meaningfully 
discuss faith.<br>
<br>
Rock and roll, as any music devotee knows, had its beginnings in the 
gospel music heard in churches, mixed with a little rhythm and blues, a 
dollop of jazz, a splash of country and western, and a heavy influence 
of African American culture. “Rockin” is a term that could as easily 
refer to spiritual rapture as to music and its physicality. Music has 
always been a vehicle for transporting oneself out of the ordinary into 
the extraordinary, with words, music, and rhythm weaving together to 
create an oasis “where time and history” are put on hold (Albanese 1999:
 495). Music helps us pay attention to the difficult “questions and 
concerns of human existence,” to make meaning out of a meaningless world
 (Pinn 2003:2, 4) We use music not necessarily in a conscious and 
deliberately spiritual way, but we nevertheless use it to deal with 
issues of ultimate concern (Pinn 2003:9). Here in this “other world,” 
there is a sense of what Catherine Albanese calls “instant community” 
(1999: 494) similar to an evangelical revival, where strangers become 
friends bonding over a mutually and similarly felt experience. This 
description fits the Springsteen fan community.<br>
<br>
Rock and roll music is also used in the process of constructing adult 
identities in teenagers – or perhaps it is more accurate to say it was 
used; each generation develops its own music, and rock and roll belongs 
to the baby-boomer generation, the post-WW II babies of the fifties and 
sixties. As Joseph Kotarba says, “The music and musical culture they 
grew up with has stayed with them and has become the soundtrack of 
American culture...people who, over the course of their lives, have come
 to use rock ‘n’ roll as a source of meaning for their joys and sorrows”
 (Kotarba 2002: 103-104). But this music is no longer the sole province 
of youth: the youth of today have moved past rock music to embrace 
hip-hop, techno, and house music as their modes of expression. The baby 
boomers are not only the first rock and roll generation to age out, we 
may be the only rock and roll generation. Rock music is now for the most
 part relegated to the ‘classic rock’ radio stations and VH1-Classic 
television channel. It is, however, an indelible part of many aging 
adults’ lives, at least in this western world culture. Music has always 
been used through the ages by people to reconstruct a point in time, and
 to summon up memories. So the aging boomers use rock ‘n’ roll; for it 
is the soundtrack to our lives, the background noise to our joys and our
 disappointments, our great hopes and our dashed dreams. And to have a 
meaningful artist who has aged with us, remained vital, and not drifted 
into nostalgia to become a rock caricature, tells us that we too can 
still maintain the optimism and vitality of our younger selves.<br>
<br>
Rock ‘n roll can also function as a tool to teach religious beliefs and 
values, and is increasingly melded into Protestant and Catholic liturgy 
(Kotarba 2002: 122). Many churches offer special services for their 
congregations, targeting younger church members with a more contemporary
 form of worship, often using rock combos to deliver the musical 
component of the service. This past winter I attended a “U2-charist” at a
 local Episcopal Church, a communion service designed entirely around 
the music and lyrics of the rock band U2. And this April, a Methodist 
Church in Greensboro will be conducting services during the month of 
April around the songs of Bruce Springsteen. <br>
<br>
Given this, the analysis of rock ‘n’ roll as religion is a natural, but 
why Bruce Springsteen? Why are legions of fans the world over so 
dedicated and devoted to this particular musician? His music and lyrics 
are meaningful, his imagery vivid, and his stage show is decidedly that –
 a stage performance part Broadway, part carnival, part down-home gospel
 tent revival; yet even the trite and cheesy parts delight and engage 
the fans, as some part of Mr. Springsteen shines through. His sincerity 
is never in doubt by his ‘followers.’ As one fan, a Methodist minister I
 call Reverend B, told me, Springsteen speaks to the human condition, 
something to which we can all relate (Reverend B.).</div>

<br>
”<em class="text-italics">We’ll let blood build a bridge, over mountains draped in stars”</em><br>
<br>
(Worlds Apart, 2002)<br>
<br>
 Springsteen’s appeal has roots in his lyrical history of visible 
integrity, empathy, understanding and compassion as well as his 
perceived personal sincerity and genuineness. Of no little contribution 
to his persona is his history of quietly contributing to charities and 
causes that dates back more than twenty-five years. In the fashion of 
effective organizations, not unlike religious outreach organizations and
 missions, Springsteen has allocated funds for food banks working with 
the unemployed, workers’ unions, and organizations that provide home 
repairs for the needy (Walker 2004). Since 1984, he has invited local 
food banks and other charitable organizations to set up collections in 
the arenas and stadiums where he plays. At each show, he will make a 
plea from the stage for attendees to please consider contributing and 
working with these organizations to help facilitate change. (“<em class="text-italics">In the end, nobody wins unless everybody wins”</em>
 is an oft-quoted phrase repeated at shows during the Born in the USA 
Tour that exemplifies how fans see him.) Usually, there is a song 
dedicated to these workers on what Springsteen calls “the front lines.” 
These are not the glamorous causes of the celebrity world, or the 
Hollywood-touted disease du jour foundations, but rather the low- 
profile, gritty organizations trying to help the hardworking man and 
woman, the migrant farm worker, the people on the margins of society. In
 his own words: “I want to try and just work more directly with people; 
try to find some way to tie into the communities we come into” (Walker 
2004). His concern for social justice for those least represented and/or
 able to advocate for themselves is obvious and reminiscent of many of 
the finest spiritual and community leaders. Part of his appeal to his 
fans is this “everyman” persona, his concern for the plight of the 
hard-working, struggling American, where his sincerity and genuineness 
seem almost palpable.<br>
<br>
While this common-man persona Bruce projects may be part public 
relations fabrication, his facade has not slipped during his thirty-five
 years in the spotlight under the scrutiny of an ever-increasingly 
cynical public. His steadfastness of ideals and his consistent actions 
support the persona his fans see, and they respect as well as 
revereBruce. He is continually heralded as being one of us, a man who 
knows and remembers his origins and roots. In reading hundreds of 
accounts of encounters with Bruce I have seen no negative responses, 
heard no story of rudeness or even the ordinary day to day 
unpleasantness that even the best of us can sometimes exhibit. Most fans
 respect his privacy when he is with his family, and the lore has it 
that citizens of his hometown territory in New Jersey are fiercely 
protective of his privacy. To better understand how his fans come to 
this place, it becomes necessary to know more about Bruce Springsteen 
and the forces that helped shape the man he has become.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">CHAPTER 2 GENESIS</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
“<em class="text-italics">I come from down in the valley where mister when you’re young they bring you up to do like your daddy done”</em><br>
<br>
(The River, 1980)<br>
<br>
 To understand a person – and the people who hold him or her in esteem -
 it is necessary to know the texture, the fabric of his or her life, the
 emotional warp and woof that results in the finished cloth. Bruce 
Frederick Springsteen was born September 23, 1949, and raised in 
Freehold, New Jersey to working class parents of Dutch, Irish and 
Italian ancestry. The section of town where his family resided was 
lower-middle-working class, and his neighborhood, known as “Texas” 
because of the large number of southerners who’d migrated there, was on 
the proverbial wrong side of the tracks (Marsh 2004: 24). His childhood 
and adolescence are outwardly unremarkable. Mom Adele worked as a 
secretary and dad Douglas filled any number of different jobs including 
bus driver, prison guard and mill worker. The family lived for many 
years with one or the other set of grandparents when financially 
strapped. The oldest child, Bruce has two sisters, Pamela and Virginia. 
Life in blue-collar New Jersey was not easy for the family, with Douglas
 moving from job to job. The tension and frustration the elder Mr. 
Springsteen carried with him influenced his son in ways that would 
manifest years later in song and story on stage in a public exorcism and
 attempt to understand and make sense of his parents’ experiences. <br>
<br>
In Springsteen’s own words: <em class="text-italics">“There was a 
promise of a right to a decent life, that you didn’t have to live and 
die like my old man did” (Smith 2002: 135). “When I was really young, I 
don’t remember thinkin’ about itmuch. But as I got older, I watched my 
father...how he would come home from work and just sit in the kitchen 
all night. Like there was somethin’ dyin’ inside of him, or like he’d 
never had a chance to live...until I started to feel there was somethin’
 dyin’ inside of me”</em> (Marsh 2004:319).<br>
<br>
Years later, when inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, he would
 admit to the audience that the working-man’s clothes he wore in concert
 was his way of honoring his father (Sawyer 2004: 2).<br>
<br>
Bruce relates that he did not really start living until he ‘found’ music
 in the form of rock ‘n roll. In his own words: “I lived half of my 
first 13 years in a trance. I was thinking of things, but I was always 
on the outside looking in (Sandford 1999: 15).” Music became his anchor 
and hope. <em class="text-italics">“The only thing that kept me from 
giving up when I was young was in the rock ’n’ roll music I heard – that
 there was a meaning in life, a meaning in living”</em> (Smith 2002: 135).<br>
<br>
 This belief in a “meaningful life” will continue to echo throughout his
 career. In one concert tale often told early on in his career, Bruce 
talks about a nun at St. Rose of Lima elementary school who stuffed him 
into a trashcan under her desk because that is where, she said, he 
belonged. This story reveals that Springsteen’s feelings of separateness
 and alienation formed early on in his childhood, and they have remained
 vivid. At 7, Bruce saw Elvis Presley appear on the Ed Sullivan Show, 
and decided to become a musician. As every Springsteen disciple knows, 
his mother Adele took out a loan to buy a teenaged Bruce a guitar, an 
act memorialized in the Springsteen song The Wish (1998):<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Dirty old street all slushed up in the rain and snow <br>
Little boy and his ma shivering outside a rundown music store window <br>
That night on top of a Christmas tree shines one beautiful star <br>
And lying underneath a brand-new Japanese guitar<br>
<br>
 I remember in the morning, ma, hearing your alarm clock ring <br>
I'd lie in bed and listen to you gettin' ready for work<br>
 The sound of your makeup case on the sink <br>
And the ladies at the office, all lipstick, perfume and rustlin' skirts<br>
 And how proud and happy you always looked walking home from work<br>
<br>
 If pa's eyes were windows into a world so deadly and true <br>
You couldn't stop me from looking but you kept me from crawlin' through <br>
And if it's a funny old world, mama, where a little boy's wishes come true<br>
 Well I got a few in my pocket and a special one just for you<br>
<br>
 It ain't no phone call on Sunday, flowers or a mother's day card<br>
 It ain’t no house on a hill with a garden and a nice little yard<br>
 I got my hot rod down on Bond Street, I'm older but you'll know me in a glance<br>
 We'll find us a little rock 'n roll bar and baby we'll go out and dance <br>
<br>
Well it was me in my Beatle boots, you in pink curlers and matador pants<br>
 Pullin' me up off the couch to do the twist for my uncles and aunts <br>
Well I found a girl of my own now, ma, I popped the question on your birthday <br>
She stood waiting on the front porch while you were telling me to get out<br>
there And say what it was that I had to say<br>
<br>
 Last night we all sat around laughing at the things that guitar brought us<br>
 And I laid awake thinking 'bout the other things it's brought us <br>
Well tonight I'm takin' requests here in the kitchen <br>
This one's for you, ma, let me come right out and say it It's overdue,<br>
 but baby, if you're looking for a sad song, well I ain't gonna play it.</em><br>
<br>
These decidedly un-rock-like lyrics thanking his mother, a decidedly 
unlikely topic for a rock musician, give some glimpse into the 
attraction his music will eventually offer many millions of fans the 
world over. After all, how many other popular musicians have written 
songs of gratitude to their mothers? The lyrics of the above song 
indicate the debt and love that Springsteen obviously feels for his 
mother. He credits her with saving him from his father’s life, from 
keeping him from “crawling through” into that dead world of limited 
possibilties and abandoned hope. His mother opened up the possibility of
 a world of freedom and release, symbolized in that guitar. But, he 
tells her in this song, he hasn’t changed. “<em class="text-italics">I’m older but you’ll know me in a glance</em>.” Adele Springsteen had an obvious impact on her son’s view of the working life as something in which to take pride.<br>
<br>
His relationship with his father, however, was tense and difficult, as 
the elder Springsteen had no understanding or tolerance for his son’s 
musical aspirations. Family and life conflicts became the fodder of 
on-stage stories; the Springsteen-lore is replete with many of these 
concert stories of paternal conflict preceding certain songs, “It’s My 
Life” among them:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“I used to always have to go back home. And I’d
 stand there in that driveway, afraid to go in the house, and I could 
see the screen door, I could see the light of my pop’s cigarette. And I 
remember I just couldn’t wait until I was old enough to take him out 
once. I used to slick my hair back real tight so he couldn’t tell how 
long it was getting’. And try to sneak through the kitchen. But the old 
man he’d catch me every night and he’d drag me back into the 
kitchen...we’d start talkin’ about nothin’ much. How I was doin’. Pretty
 soon he’d ask me what I thought I was doin’ with myself, and we’d 
always end up screamin’ at each other. My mother she’d always end up 
runnin’ in from the front room, cryin’ and tryin’ to pull him off me, 
try to keep us from fightin’ with each other. And I’d always, I’d always
 end up runnin’ out the back door...tellin’ him how it was my life and I
 was gonna do what I wanted to do.” </em><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen (Marsh 2003:25-26).<br>
<br>
It was at this point that Bruce would launch into the song “It’s My 
Life,” not one he’d written, but obviously one with which he emotionally
 identified.<br>
A male friend once told me that if you wanted to make a man cry, just 
ask him about his father. Bruce obviously carried around many 
conflicting feelings about his own father and what sort of role he 
played in his life, and again, this is one of the things that fans can 
relate to – the conflicts with our families, and the cascade of emotions
 we can experience when dealing with our families. Bruce also talked 
about his father’s referring to “that goddamned guitar.” (Since his 
father’s death in 1998 these stories have migrated into the oral 
history, and are no longer used by him in his performances) One 
frequently told tale was that of Bruce’s convalescing from a motorcycle 
accident at home, and his father paying a barber to come to the house to
 cut Bruce’s unruly long hair. Yet when Bruce was rejected by the 
Selective Service Board and classified 4-F (physically unfit for 
service) in the late sixties, Douglas Springsteen’s reaction was a quiet
 but heartfelt “Good.” This was, after all, in 1968, and the Vietnam War
 with its military draft posed a reality for teenaged boys that the Iraq
 War does not for today’s youth. By telling this story, Springsteen was 
releasing any resentment towards his father, and acknowledging that 
Douglas was not the uncaring father depicted in the previous story. And 
by doing this in a performance, he provided an example for men in the 
audience who perhaps had their own father issues.<br>
Despite circumstances that could have made him a bitter and mean young 
man, Bruce Springsteen showed a level of understanding, empathy, and 
compassion towards his father as he aged and matured. The 1980 album The
 River included the song “Independence Day” that illustrated his 
capacity for empathy and forgiveness.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Well, Papa go to bed now it’s getting late Nothing we can say can change anything now<br>
 I’ll be leavin’ in the morning from St. Mary’s gate We wouldn’t change this thing even if we could somehow <br>
Cause the darkness of this house has got the best of us There’s a darkness in this town that’s got us too <br>
But they can’t touch me now and you can’t touch me nowThey ain’t gonna do to me What I watched them do to you <br>
Now I don’t know what it always was with us <br>
We chose the words, and yeah, we drew the lines<br>
 There was just no way this house could hold the two of us<br>
 I guess that we were just too much of the same kind.</em><br>
<br>
These are not the words of a grudge-holding, rebelling adolescent, but 
an understanding adult, and the sort of lyrics upon which Springsteen’s 
emotional legacy is built. There is an understanding in this song of the
 forces that pluck at us, over which we have no control; we can only 
change how we deal with these forces in spite of the outcome. Our 
responsibility is in the way we deal with situations that we have no 
control over. This song is also a public forgiveness of his father, as 
well as an apology to Douglas Springsteen: “I guess that we were just 
too much of the same kind.” His words come from situations understood if
 not experienced, and this empathy pours out in his music; his songs 
show a remarkable ability to understand whatever situation he is writing
 about, whether it is an illegal immigrant working in a methamphetamine 
lab, or a Vietnam veteran seeking work. Songs of love and moon and June 
we are accustomed to hearing from other musicians, but Springsteen’s 
lyrics mine the deeper emotional waters of unwed mothers and desolate 
souls searching for a little peace and happiness, walking on the 
backstreets looking for hope.<br>
<br>
Many of his songs sound potentially autobiographical, and indeed there 
must be a component of self in any good writing. But Springsteen 
disavows literal historiography saying “the songs are not literally 
autobiographical but in some way they’re emotionally autobiographical” 
(Primeaux 1996: <img class="smilies" src="_assets/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" width="15" height="15">. However, in “Songs,” Springsteen admits to some actual history, telling the reader that “<em class="text-italics">I often wrote from a child’s point of view</em>:
 ‘Mansion on the Hill,’ ‘Used Cars,’ ‘My Father’s House’ – these are all
 stories that came directly out of my experience with my family” (2003: 
138). In concert, Springsteen told the story of an old family car that 
didn’t have reverse gear, so his father would park the car on a hill so 
it would be easier to start driving. The words to “Used Car (1982)” 
reflect more than mere auto-frustration:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">My little sister’s in the front seat with an ice cream cone <br>
My Ma’s in the backseat sittin’ all alone<br>
 As my Pa steers her slow out of the lot for a test drive down Michigan Avenue<br>
<br>
Now my Ma she fingers her wedding band <br>
And watches the salesman stare at my old man’s hands<br>
 He’s tellin’ us ‘bout the break he’d give us if he could but he just can’t <br>
Well if I could swear I know just what I’d do <br>
Now mister, the day the lottery I win I ain’t ever gonna ride in no used car again <br>
<br>
Now the neighbors come from near and far <br>
As we pull up in our brand-new used car <br>
I wish he’d just hit the gas and let out a cry <br>
And tell ‘em all they can kiss our asses goodbye.<br>
<br>
My dad he sweats the same job from mornin’ to morn<br>
 Me I walk home on the same dirty streets where I was born<br>
 Up the block I can hear my little sister in the front seat blowin’ that horn <br>
The sounds echo all down Michigan Avenue <br>
<br>
Now mister, the day my number comes in I ain’t ever gonna ride in no used car again,</em><br>
<br>
<br>
It is lyrics in this vein, of the songs quoted above that give the 
public a window into Springsteen’s childhood and the forces that helped 
shape the man he has become. The examples are there for the world to 
read, hear, and see, and have been analyzed and dissected by pop writers
 and scholars alike. Fans have heard his music and recognize the 
humanity of the writer, felt his compassion via his music, and judged 
him accordingly. They feel connected to this man, who most have never 
and will never meet, but who nevertheless is as familiar as a lover.<br>
<br>
Fans know their history - the Springsteen creation myth, if you will. 
The elder Springsteens took their life’s savings and moved from their 
home in Freehold, New Jersey to California in 1969, but nineteen year 
old Bruce decided to remain in New Jersey pursuing his music, moving to 
the shore community of Asbury Park. And here the ‘legend’ begins to take
 shape. Springsteen’s name has come to be inextricably intertwined with 
that of Asbury Park, New Jersey, a seedy little seaside town on the 
Jersey shore immortalized on his first album Greetings from Asbury Park 
(1973). Asbury at the time – and perhaps presently - suffered from 
run-of-the-mill political corruption, and funds targeted for urban 
development never manifested in change for the city. As subject to 
racial conflict as the rest of late 60’s and early 70’s urban America, 
July 1970 saw race riots in Asbury Park (<a href="http://www.beyondthepalace.com/newjersey/asburypark" class="postlink">http://www.beyondthepalace.com/newjersey/asburypark</a>.).
 Nevertheless, there was a flourishing music scene that included any 
number of bands, one of which was Bruce Springsteen’s, in whatever the 
moment revealed: The Castiles, Earth, Child, Dr. Zoom and the Sonic 
Boom, Steel Mill, and the Bruce Springsteen Band to name some 
incarnations of his bands. It was an <em class="text-italics">“era of shared apartments and skimpy meals”</em> (Cross 1989: 26).<br>
<br>
The legendary record executive John Hammond signed Springsteen to a 
recording contract with Columbia Records in 1972, and released Greetings
 from Asbury Park in 1973. In May of 1974, rock critic Jon Landau of 
Boston’s Real Paper was present at a Springsteen performance at the 
Harvard Theater, and wrote the prescient, legendary <em class="text-italics">“I have seen the future of rock and roll and its name is Bruce Springsteen”</em>
 review (Marsh 1987: 155). Springsteen’s live performances, where he 
forged his connection to his audience through both his musical outreach 
and his active attempts to involve them, were becoming legendary, and 
his fans many and loyal. Somehow, his absolute sincerity cut through any
 rock ‘n’ roll pretenses and touched those who saw him perform.<br>
<br>
But it was with the release of his third album, the critically acclaimed
 Born to Run, that the rest of the country and the world began to hear 
the name Bruce Springsteen and his nickname, ‘the Boss.’ Both Newsweek 
and Time magazines featured his face on the cover of their respective 
magazines the same week in 1975. Springsteen and his music had become 
ubiquitous, so much so that during his first visit and performances in 
London, Springsteen rebelled and tore down posters promoting his concert
 there. Again, these are the unlikely actions of a future rock-icon, but
 that are indicative of the kind of man and<br>
performer Bruce was and still is. In his words, <em class="text-italics">“I
 wasn’t interested in immediate success or how much each particular 
record sold. I was interested in becoming part of people’s lives and, 
hopefully, growing up with them – growing up together”</em> (Sawyer 2004: 1).<br>
<br>
 Instinctively, fans feel this. Springsteen’s live shows, constructed as
 if made of fire and performed from the heart, continued to create a 
loyal following, and his fame grew quickly. The ferocity and zeal with 
which he performed as well as the prolonged performances of three, four,
 even four and a half hours became the stuff of legends. Because of 
contractual and legal issues, however, (he had fired and brought suit 
against his manager Mike Appel during the recording of Born to Run) he 
was legally prohibited from recording until his legal problems were 
resolved (Sawyers 9).<br>
<br>
 When he finally reentered the recording studio two years later slightly
 more jaded and disillusioned with the record business after this legal 
struggle, it was with a stylistically more somber and adult set of 
songs. “<em class="text-italics">After Born to Run I wanted to write 
about life in the close confines of the small towns I grew up in...I 
felt a sense of accountability to the people I'd grown up alongside 
of...I wanted to ensure that my music continued to have value and a 
sense of place”</em> (Springsteen 2003:66).<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“I believe in the love that can save me...”</em><br>
<br>
(Badlands, 1978) <br>
<br>
The strength of Springsteen’s character and its reflection in his lyrics becomes<br>
important when critically looking at his fan following. His “sense of 
place and value” are evidenced in both his writings and in his presented
 persona, and create a loyal and devoted fan-base. Put quite simply, 
fans believe what he sings and what he says. He is not seen as 
infallible or impervious to human failings; his more politically 
conservative fans see his politics as naïve and simplistic. Indeed, the 
break-up of his first marriage to Julianne Phillips was acted out on the
 pages of tabloids all over the world. Yet somehow even this marital 
dissolution seemed to work in Springsteen’s favor, earning him more 
emotional capital with his audience; he left his super-model wife for a 
back-up singer in his band, a real ‘Jersey girl,’ Patti Scialfa, and 
married her. They have remained married and have three children 
together.<br>
<br>
Over the course of the past thirty-five years, the musicians performing 
behind Springsteen as the E Street Band have maintained a constant 
line-up, with only one break from performing together. These band 
members had played together since their teens, some members for as long 
as twenty years, when Springsteen “fired” them in 1989. For reasons only
 truly known to Springsteen, he formed a new touring band and recorded 
two albums. The loyal fans took this break-up hard, and never really 
embraced what came to be known as the “other band.” For nearly 15 years 
the E Street Band had been the foils for Springsteen’s on-stage antics, 
and their personas seemed entwined with Bruce’s. Even the name of the 
band, “The E Street,” harkened back to their teenage years, as the house
 where they practiced was on E Street. Fans felt a little betrayed: 
these were extended family members, almost as beloved as Bruce himself. 
(Some never truly forgave Bruce for this, and posts regularly show up on
 the internet still debating the quality of the music produced with 
them). The E Street Band members themselves were for the most part 
silent. The ‘break-up’ continued until January 1995, when the E Street 
band reunited with Bruce to record several cuts for his Greatest Hits 
compact disc. And in 1999, Springsteen accompanied by the reunited E 
Street Band launched their Reunion Tour, playing 120 shows in eighty two
 countries, concluding with ten shows at New York’s Madison Square 
Garden.<br>
<br>
A musicologist’s analysis of Springsteen’s music and performance cites 
expression rather than “virtuosic control” as the lynchpin of his work: 
the audience experiences and internalizes his performance as an “<em class="text-italics">honest man giving his emotional all”</em>
 (Berger &amp; Del Negro 2004: 58, 59). This succinct summation says 
what millions of fans have been saying for thirty five years. Berger and
 Del Negro describe Springsteen fans as “engaging in romantic detail 
vertigo” and state that the listeners’ attention is drawn more to the 
emotion and meaning than to the technical rendering of the performance 
(2004: 59). Ultimately, these scholars maintain that this reflexivity is
 important to performance:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“the reflexive metacommentary by which a 
performer signals her awareness of herself as a participant in an 
interaction – and by which she signals her awareness of the audience’s 
attention to her – colors and informs all of the ‘primary’ communication
 in the performance and plays a crucial role in the overall aesthetics 
of the event”</em> (Berger &amp; DelNegro, 2004: 95).<br>
<br>
The translation of this for Springsteen and fans is that Bruce knows – 
as do the fans – that the audience is an integral part of the event. He 
feeds off the audience, and gives them responsibility for a more highly 
charged performance or a less energetic show, playing them like another 
instrument in his performing repertoire. For example, during a 1980 
performance in Stockholm, Bruce acknowledged his growing awareness of 
the necessity of audience involvement:<br>
<br>
There’s a Marvin Gaye and Tammy Terrell song: it’s called ‘It Takes Two.’ In the song, Marvin Gaye sings, <em class="text-italics">‘It takes two to make a dream come true.</em>’<strong class="text-strong">
 And I guess that’s why we’re here tonight talking to you and you guys 
are talking to us. Because it’s funny, you know, on this tour since 
we’ve been over here, I’ve learned...I’ve learned a lot over here. I’ve 
learned the importance of the audience, the importance of you in the 
show. Because we come out and we play, and we play hard and try to tell 
you about the things that mean a lot to us, and when you respond the way
 you have tonight and last night, it’s like...it’s a big, like ‘me too,’
 you know. It’s in a buncha little things. I want you to know that it 
means a lot to us...</strong>(Marsh 2003:282)<br>
<br>
For performances during his younger years, an important part of his 
compact with his followers was throwing himself – literally – into the 
audience, being carried by their hands, and getting deposited back 
on-stage with the audience’s help. Today, an older Bruce, no longer any 
more able to perform these strenuous physical gyrations than the rest of
 us fifty-somethings, has replaced these audience-dives with moving to 
the edge of the stage and encouraging the lucky faithful to strum his 
guitar, while others touch the edges of his jeans or boots. A communion 
of sort, sharing guitar strings and deniminstead of bread and wine, 
there is no fear here; Bruce trusts his audience in the same way they 
trust him. This is part of the covenant that has given birth to the 
community and unity fans feel with each other and with Bruce 
Springsteen, and that creates a climate conducive to actively witnessing
 for Bruce, honoring both his humanity and our own by actively working 
for a better world and striving for personal integrity: “<em class="text-italics">Baby you be true to me and I’ll be true to you”</em> (Be True, 1988). To be ‘true’ to him, we need to be ‘true’ to each other and ourselves.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">CHAPTER THREE</strong><br>
<br>
‘<em class="text-italics">Tramps Like Us...”</em><br>
<br>
(Born to Run, 1975)<br>
<br>
 William Romanowski says the popularity of any “...given cultural 
element is directly proportional to the degree to which that element is 
reflective of audience beliefs and values” (2001: 18). This is certainly
 true of Springsteen’s audiences, but with a twist: the ‘faithful’ see 
themselves as a reflection of the ideals espoused by Springsteen. The 
lyrical content of his music contained within the popular culture rubric
 finds itself dealing with emotions readily experienced by the majority.
 And because music can work as a conveyance system of shared meanings, a
 component of religion and culture both, the lines can further blur when
 sitting in the audience. George Barna’s categorization of Christians 
suggests that those people he calls cultural Christians (in Romanowski 
2001, 28) hold this idea of works-based faith, again echoed in the 
Springsteen fan community. This is not to say that all Springsteen fans 
are either religious or Christian, however. Romanowski claims also that 
it is a perspective that makes a work religious, that <em class="text-italics">“...there
 is something right about the way he creates popular music,” and that 
the music “...captures a sense of religious longing and daily struggle 
that resonates.</em>..” with listeners (2001:93, 30).<br>
<br>
But what, exactly, is a fan? One working definition in use now, that of 
an enthusiastic supporter of a sports team or celebrity, differs 
considerably from the original definition of a religious zealot 
(Cavicchi 1998: 38). Yet there is a component of the zealot in any true 
fan. To be a fan indicates a certain level of devotion to the object of 
one’s fandom. Most fans initially become ‘converts’ and experience this 
transformation through an introduction to and identification with the 
music and lyrics. The language these converts use is that of spiritual 
conversion, not unlike the language and imagery a recently ‘saved’ 
Christian might use, calling themselves ‘believers (Steven).” One French
 fan told me that she attended her first concert in 1992 and “saw the 
face of God (janiss).” Some terms commonly used to describe a 
Springsteen-event are ‘redemption’ and ‘salvation,’ most decidedly 
religious, as is the burning need the converted masses feel to bring 
others into the fold, to convert them. Being a Springsteen fan is not 
unlike being a missionary for Bruce.<br>
<br>
In the Springsteen-world, there are ‘casual fans’ and ‘real fans:’ a 
casual fan might attend a concert, but would probably not alter 
life-plans to do so, while a ‘real fan’ does whatever it takes within 
their means to attend a show. Every ‘real’ fan knows exactly how many 
times they have seen Springsteen, with some fans counting triple-digit 
performances as proof of their devotion. Springsteen fans also proclaim 
their solidarity with each other, casual or true, and exhibit this unity
 at shows by responding at various times during the performance with 
specific hand gestures and vocal responses. As one ‘follower’ stated, 
“...any one Bruce fan could somehow speak for ALL Bruce fans...part of 
being a Bruce fan was being a member of the shared history of the Bruce 
fanCommunity. You knew any Bruce fan was a friend of any other Bruce 
fan” (Steven).<br>
<br>
Going to a concert is like spending time with 20,000 of your closest friends you’ve not yet met. “<em class="text-italics">making grown men cry and women dance”</em><br>
(Bruce Springsteen on “60 Minutes”) <br>
<br>
Who are these fans? Most are men, more evident in the European audiences
 than in the United States. A cursory examination of the audience in 
Cologne, Germany at a December 2007 concert revealed an approximate 
ratio of men to women around six to one; the Paris audience appeared 
even more male, with what looked to be about a ten to one ratio, male to
 female. Concert goers assured me that part of this was due to the 
“crazy Italian men fans” that traveled all over Europe following Bruce 
in concert. Indeed, at the Paris show of December 2007, there looked to 
be twenty to thirty men in the “pit” (the standing area closest to the 
stage) all wearing orange shirts, and waving Italian flags. In the 
Bruce-fandom world, the Italian fans are legendary, with fans of other 
nations wistfully coveting shows in Italy.<br>
<br>
A recently published book of fan stories, For You, contains the 
fan-written and contributed stories of what Bruce means to them as well 
as stories relating personal encounters with him. The stories presented 
in the following chapters echo the same themes found in Kirsch’s book, 
of “finding” Springsteen and what that means to the individual. These 
fans self-identify to whatever extent they are comfortable, using either
 their actual given names or screen names. In examining the book, I 
tallied up the gender of the contributors, and found that some one 
hundred and sixty three were identifiable as males, while sixty seven 
were women; sixteen I classified as gender unknown, as the names were 
either unisex or unknown to me (Kirsch 2007).<br>
<br>
 This supports what I have observed at concerts and the larger number of
 male attendees.In terms of age, fans run the spectrum from very young 
(under ten) to over sixty. The majority of fans range between forty to 
fifty years old. In 2007 I asked people (on a fansite where I am a 
member, <a href="http://www.greasylake.org/" class="postlink">www.greasylake.org</a>)
 to email me and tell me a little about their bruce-ness. Thirty four 
people responded, and the majority were between the ages of forty-one to
 fifty (thirteen). Nine people were between the ages of thirty-one and 
forty, while seven people were age eighteen to thirty. There were two 
respondents over sixty, and three between fifty-one and sixty.<br>
<br>
For the most part, the people who communicated with me were well 
educated, with all but two people having at least some college. Twelve 
were women, with again the majority being male. Most of these particular
 fans had at least some college education, with two indicating a 
doctorate. Incomes were spilt almost equally for those who answered, 
with seventeen people making less than fifty thousand dollars a year, 
and seventeen people making more than fifty thousand dollars a year. 
Their occupations spanned everything from judges (one) and lawyers (two)
 to a full-time homemaker and a chef. No one reported being a manual 
laborer, and everyone for the most part seemed to have white-collar 
jobs.<br>
<br>
This casual polling also revealed that twenty of these fans did not 
regularly attend any church, temple, or mosque other than The Church of 
Bruce; one devoted congregant however, who has attended over fourteen 
shows and who has been a fan for twenty five years, reported he was a 
Bible student at a Jehovah Witnesses’ Kingdom Hall. When asked, the fans
 expressed seeing no conflict between the spiritual nourishment they 
received through Springsteen and his music and whatever ‘regular’ church
 they attended. The feeling seemed to be that whatever faith you found 
that helped you get through the day was valid, regardless of where you 
found it: finding it in Bruce just makes sense to his fans.<br>
<br>
One of the things I queried the cyber-site about was how many times 
people had seen Springsteen. Answers varied from once to over two 
hundred times, with a riotous variation between the two. Almost everyone
 collects “brucelegs” – bootleg recordings made surreptitiously of 
Bruce’s live performances that stretch back to the late sixties. These 
brucelegs serve as a sort of communal offering, freely traded and 
supplied to the faithful, all done gratuitously. Indeed, those 
individuals who are found to be selling these recordings and videos are 
severely chastised and frequently excommunicated from the loyal 
Springsteen congregation. At the very least, the offender’s name is 
spread far and wide amongst the community, with his or her sins revealed
 to all via the electronic sources available to the fans- websites, 
cyber bulletin boards, and emails.<br>
<br>
This (mostly) unspoken ethical rule also applies to the reselling of 
tickets to concerts. Springsteen tickets are among the hardest concert 
tickets to come by, and because of this, fans who do manage to get 
tickets often will get more than they personally need. These “spare” 
tickets are then offered up at face-value or less to other fans. It is 
also not uncommon for fans to “faerie” (as these bestowers of spare 
tickets are called) others – to give away a ticket to a loyal disciple. I
 have been both the recipient and the faerie, receiving a coveted 
Christmas performance ticket from someone I never met, gratis, and 
likewise buying a ticket for someone, freely giving this to him. While 
it may be better to give than receive, receiving is definitely a joy not
 to be denied! At present, I am in receipt of a ticket for an Atlanta 
performance scheduled for late April sent to me by someone I know only 
by screen name, with the understanding I can pay him when I see him. I 
have no address, meeting place, or even a real name for this person! The
 community truly does operate on the principle of treating others as you
 would be treated. “The thinking is, if you’re a fan of Bruce, it means 
you can be trusted. You’re an honest person and you can sleep on my 
couch” (Perusse). The community works on this ethical principle, again 
assumed to be derived from Springsteen’s own actions. It is not quite 
WWBD (what would Bruce do) but it is close to that. Fans who act outside
 of the accepted behavioral parameters and violate these “bruce-ethics” 
(my term, not commonly used by fans) are chastised as not being “real” 
fans, or not “listening” to Bruce; “real” fans act in accordance with 
the principles that they find in Springsteen’s music.<br>
<br>
“<em class="text-italics">Everybody’s got a hungry heart”</em><br>
<br>
(Hungry Heart, 1980) <br>
<br>
“..<em class="text-italics">.when I see Bruce Springsteen reaching to 
his audience –to every corner of a large arena, to every mind in the 
hall – I find the kind of fulfillment and community that only the best 
friendships and kinships might bring one, which is to say, I see an oath
 of love and meaning played out with a full heart.”</em><br>
Mikal Gilmore (Marsh 2004: 433-34)<br>
<br>
While I have personally only witnessed concerts in three different 
countries – France, Germany, and the United States, I have nevertheless 
met fans from at least eleven different countries. The connection is the
 same with these fans as with my own countrymen and women – all things 
Bruce ties us together. Courtesies are extended and trust freely given, 
simply on the basis of our mutual membership in the Church of Bruce.<br>
<br>
My first experience meeting a foreign Bruce fan happened in 2004 
Northern Ireland. Through a mutual but equally unmet friend, I was given
 the name and phone number of a family living outside Belfast – husband 
and wife were both avid fans and members of a cyber bulletin board 
sponsored by Sony Music – brucespringsteen.net. In spite of our all 
being members of this site, I had never ‘spoken’ to J. or D. until we 
actually arrived in Northern Ireland. I called, introduced myself, and 
we made plans to meet that week. My traveling companion and I arrived 
early one afternoon at their lovely cottage, and immediately jumped 
head-first into Bruce-lore, comparing concerts and favorite songs. We 
had a wonderful time, and when we left we were no longer strangers.<br>
During a recent trip to Europe to observe Springsteen and fans, I met a 
number of fans from all over Europe, as well as some expatriate 
Americans. The language and emotions expressed echoed that of American 
fans, even if the audience responses differ slightly. (Euro-fans tend to
 be more enthusiastic and loud, waving and clapping in a hypnotic, 
synchronized fashion.) One German fan in front of me in line said that 
every man wants to be him while every woman wants to meet him. Another 
Danish fan who had driven eight hours to see a show in Berlin, and who 
had just finished driving another five to get to Cologne said he 
traveled to see Bruce as much as he could. I was also assured that the 
German audience at this show would make American audiences pale in 
comparison, a point of great pride for the Europeans. Hobbes, a German 
fan, proudly showed me a tattoo of Bruce’s signature right where he’d 
signed her arm. She expressed the idea that Bruce was her emotional and 
spiritual light in a dark reality.<br>
<br>
Aussie brucefan, an Australian, is a drug and alcohol rehabilitation 
counselor who says he was attracted to Bruce because of the “music, 
lyrics, and social responsibility thing.” S. also from Australia, says 
she can’t wait to make the Asbury pilgrimage during the next tour. 
Springsteen has appeared in Australia and New Zealand, but not with any 
sort of regularity, and so fans ‘down under’ must travel to him. 
Corvettesue, from New Zealand says that “...integrity and Bruce” has 
given her a whole new life and many friends where she once had few. In 
talking, she also used the term “Church of Bruce,” and when I commented 
that he did not give us actual direction, she vehemently replied “But he
 does.” These fans see the guidance and moral challenges set forth in 
Springsteen’s music as guidelines and suggestions for a mode of behavior
 in their personal lives, much as a member of any religious community 
follows the examples set by its spiritual leader. It is not necessary 
for Springsteen to say <em class="text-italics">“This is what you must do or not do.”</em>
 His songs, if examined as parables, contain their own moral, their own 
cause and effect outcome. Blueguitar, an American, had this to say:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">He was great, but flawed as we all are. He knew
 it, and wasn’t afraid to admit it. A rock and roller? Sure, but to me 
he was so much more. He inspired me to do more with my life, to go out 
into the world and make a difference. To do MY job a little better, just
 like he did. To know you had given your all, just like he did. I 
believe in the power and faith that Bruce Springsteen preaches about.</em><br>
<br>
Fan all eddie took his autistic son to a recent concert, along with a particularly meaningful sign he wanted Bruce to read:<br>
<br>
Bruce stopped playing, read every word, and seemed to be a little choked
 up...then he reaches out and hands Eddie his harmonica, needless to say
 the tears began to flow, my hands were shaking as they are now 
retelling this story...our sign read “Your music taught our autistic son
 to speak.”<br>
<br>
Brianzai says Bruce provides “a place of mercy and healing.” Hanaree 
explains “ it again feels like God speaking directly to me through these
 words: I will provide for you/I’ll stand by your side/ you’ll need a 
good companion for this part of the ride...Bruce provides spiritual 
connection.” BjorntorunMN told me that Bruce was the one thing that 
provided him comfort on “those dark nights” after a bad divorce and job 
loss. And Reverend Suzanne Meyer posits: <em class="text-italics">“Bruce incarnates his message, becomes a conduit for hope” and calls his concerts “nothing less than revival meetings.”</em>
 Clearly, for these fans Springsteen provides spiritual sustenance and 
all that implies: hope, understanding, forgiveness, and redemption as 
well as community and acceptance and a connection to something ineffable
 and greater than the sum of all these parts. Clearly, there is a 
spiritual element and energy here that works as well as any religious 
service.<br>
<br>
One of the common threads that run through most fan meet-ups is the 
initial ‘witnessing’ that takes place; each person wants to relate their
 conversion story, to share how they ‘came’ to Bruce. The discussions 
usually then migrate to “what’s your favorite song?” and “<em class="text-italics">how many times have you seen him?</em>”
 In an odd sort of way, these add social capitol to the exchange – the 
more shows, the greater number of “Bruce-points.” This also serves as a 
way of making an initial connection to each other, and in a way, 
validating one’s character. In short, the more avid a fan, the greater 
the internalization of the message conveyed through the performance, and
 therefore, the more trustworthy the person.<br>
<br>
When discussing any given show, fans will not only ask how the band 
sounded, but also what Bruce’s energy was like, as well as how the 
audience responded. Missed cues or sour notes play less into the fans’ 
enjoyment than the entire experience as a whole. Flaws in the 
performance sometimes actually seem to enhance the experience and make 
it more personalized. Seeing the human side of Springsteen and the band 
in the form of forgotten lyrics or missed cues comes to be endearing and
 relished as a shared human experience between fan and performer. The 
feeling that Bruce is human, he is really one of us prevails, as does 
the idea that “we” are an important component of the performance. 
Outside of the concert hall, fans commune on-line at one of several 
cyber fan-sites<br>
discussing a myriad of topics, not all limited to Springsteen-world. The
 membership to these sites is free and most are open to anyone with the 
exception of several sites that are by invitation-only; memberships on 
these open sites number in the thousands. At <a href="http://www.greasylake.org/" class="postlink">www.greasylake.org</a>, membership stands at 11,392, while <a href="http://www.backstreets.com/" class="postlink">www.backstreets.com</a>
 boasts over 20,000. These cyber-communities offer a way to connect with
 like-minded people and talk. There are forums for discussing just-Bruce
 related topics and activities, forums for seeking and finding song 
chords for musicians, forums for acquiring copies of compact disks of 
entire concerts that have been surreptitiously recorded, and others for 
just general discussion and moral support. It is on these websites that 
the feeling of community becomes accentuated and nurtured. There are 
parties planned, softball games organized, and personal alliances set 
up. When a tour is in full-swing, fans ‘gather’ at their computers at 
the show time of whatever city Springsteen and company are performing in
 to await word of what is being performed, vicariously experiencing the 
show. Called the set-list watch, a fan at the concert text messages or 
calls someone else to post on the internet what is being played so that 
the ‘watchers’ can keep track of songs played. This functions as a kind 
of round-table, where small talk is exchanged and personal experiences 
shared while waiting the three to six minutes it takes for the present 
song to be completed. Fans also keep track of where those members 
present in the venue are in relation to the stage, which promotes a kind
 of vicarious experience. While nowhere close to the experience of being
 at the show, the set-list watch helps to expand each cyber 
participant’s knowledge of and relation to the other fans on-line 
participating. After the show, attendees will post their impressions and
 reviews for those who were not there, all of which serves to reinforce 
the inclusiveness and community on the ‘boards’ and in the greater 
Springsteen community.</div>

COMMUNITY IN THE SPRINGSTEEN FAN FAMILY</strong><br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“You can’t break the ties that bind...”</em><br>
<br>
(The Ties that Bind, 1980)<br>
<br>
 Because the word ‘community’ is so often used, it is necessary to 
specify exactly how I am using it in the context of the Bruce 
Springsteen fan community. Social science literature provides many 
different conceptual ideas of what constitutes community. The term has 
been used in the past to identify an actual geographical location as 
well as to indicate a connection with others who share common customs 
and identities (Brown 2002: 3). In his 1995 book, Amitai Etzioni 
described the important aspects of community:<em class="text-italics"> 
“What is needed, rather, is a strengthening of the bonds that tie people
 to one another, enabling them to overcome isolation and alienation...to
 establish in communities the moral voice that leads people to encourage
 one another to behave more virtuously than they would otherwise (iii).”</em>
 In this sense, the Springsteen fan community definitely fits within the
 parameters of Etzioni’s description, and Bruce is that moral voice that
 ties us together.<br>
<br>
The fan community also occupies a geographical space, but that space is 
fluid, changing from one concert venue to another, in this sense 
creating a global community. The concert audience in any country will 
have fans from any number of countries who have traveled to see 
Springsteen and to meet others who share their love of his music. I have
 met fans from Denmark, Italy, England, Ireland, Sweden, Germany, 
Canada, Singapore and Australia at concerts in New Jersey, as well as at
 concerts in Cologne,Germany and Paris, France. Indeed, I have met some 
of these same fans in New Jersey and Europe.<br>
<br>
If a ‘community’ needs a unifying principle, as some scholars have said 
(Keller 2003: 3), the Springsteen community has that in the music, 
performances, and person of Springsteen. Fans are able to overcome 
feelings of isolation, if only temporarily and occasionally, when in the
 presence, either real-time or cyber-time, of other fans who understand 
how they feel. Yet, some scholars have defined this feeling as 
communitarianism rather than community: “to qualify for community, 
social categorizations must be translated into a consciousness of a 
kind, a sense of belonging, and a shared identity, past or future 
(Keller 2003: <img class="smilies" src="_assets/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" width="15" height="15">.”
 Community is then concrete and rooted in place, while communitarianism 
is abstract and more a set of moral principles (Keller 2003: <img class="smilies" src="_assets/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" width="15" height="15">.
 The Springsteen fan community fulfills the criteria for both community 
and communitarianism, with the qualification of the fixed geographical 
space as defined above in the form of the concert arena; our shared 
identity is Bruce.<br>
<br>
However, we need to reconfigure the idea of community as requiring a 
location, and give consideration to the cyber-communities of which so 
many people are members. These on-line ‘communities’ help to fulfill the
 need we all crave to fill “...regardless of race, gender, culture, or 
social class: acceptance (Bugeja 2005: 1).” While people may want to 
posit that the age of technology has adversely affected us and created a
 sense of isolation, which it undoubtedly has, in this internet-age the 
network has become a hometown to some (Bugeja 2005: 3). “<em class="text-italics">Neighbors”
 are as close as our keyboard and internet connection. This may be as 
good as it gets for those who immerse themselves in video games and 
on-line communication, a surrogate for live, human connection.</em> (Waldinger 2005).<br>
Springsteen fans make use of these virtual-communities – “social 
aggregations that emerge from the [internet] to form webs of personal 
relationships in cyberspace (Rheingold 1993: 5).” These cyber-sites are 
usually fan-run, and offer a glimpse into the Springsteen-fan world. 
They represent community, offering a unifying principle (Springsteen and
 his music) and filling a variety of functions. The fan-site serves as a
 place to discuss current and personal events, share emotions, get the 
latest updates on the musician’s activities and news, and to form 
friendships. Some fan-sites have extremely lively forums for political 
discussions that often become heated; mutual admiration does not 
necessarily translate into homogeneous politics!<br>
<br>
Writing about the Protestant Church in 1978, Wade Clark Roof describes the “primacy of belonging” aspect of community:<br>
<br>
Participation in the religious community exposes the believer to others 
sharing the faith, which, in turn, helps to reinforce personal 
commitments...religion fulfills a quasi-ethnic role in providing a sense
 of belonging, the meaning aspects of religion...intimately rooted in 
the belonging. (54).<br>
Following this reasoning, Bruce fans are therefore not only members of 
the same ‘church,’ but also their own ‘ethnic’ group, with a shared 
culture. Attending concerts reaffirms the belief in Bruce and in the fan
 community solidarity.<br>
<br>
Several of the larger Springsteen fan cyber-sites are administered and 
moderated over by non-American fans (further indicating his popularity 
outside the United States). Cosmickid is the Danish architect and 
founder of one of the largest of these fan sites, greasylake.org. He saw
 his first Bruce concert in 1988 and was dramatically impacted by it:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Something had changed in me. When I realized 
the possibilities of the Internet I knew I’d found my medium... Real 
people getting together over a shared passion. And real people, 
strangers, once again grabbing each other’s hands, if only virtually, 
just like I’d seen them do that night. ...a life-altering experience 
that I still feel today. It’s been one hell of a ride and still is.</em><br>
<br>
Cosmickid is only one of many fervent non-American followers, and he 
like many of the others has made the ‘pilgrimage’ to Asbury Park, and 
the legendary bar, the Stone Pony where Bruce was a regular fixture 
early on in his career. Visitors can take a tour of Asbury Park and 
Freehold, New Jersey, seeing the places mentioned in Springsteen’s 
earlier songs, and the sites of his youth (njrockmap.com). Almost every 
European fan that I have spoken with who has visited the United States 
has made a point to make this pilgrimage to eat pizza at Federici’s (a 
local pizzeria), have a beer at the StonePony, take their picture in 
front of Madame Marie’s fortune telling stand, and cruise down Kingsley –
 all places and things that have meaning for the fan, and are part of 
the Springsteen mythology. These pilgrimages are not unlike the Holy 
Land tours I observed when in Israel.<br>
<br>
When asked what the internet fan community meant to the people 
frequenting these Springsteen websites, the responses I received 
indicated the similar and repeated belief that anyone who is a fan of 
Bruce is welcome. Likewise, the fans on these sites felt at ease, at 
home. “We are a group of people that share the same passion and love for
 Bruce...{the website bulletin board is} our home away from home if you 
will” (GL1). Attending concerts is likened to “...where you can meet and
 bond with total strangers...it is like nothing I have experienced”(GL2)
 Another fan says “...being in this community is like a 
neighborhood...when someone is in need there’s usually a great bunch of 
folks willing to step up” (btx1). The fans readily display the depths to
 which Springsteen has influenced them, and he is credited as such: “we 
all appreciate that Bruce has enriched our lives to a greater or lesser 
degree, to a point where people who have not yet ‘got Bruce’ will never 
understand” (GL4). Another member of greasylake.org says “I think of the
 ‘Radio Nowhere’ lyric, ‘trying to make a connection to you’ and I think
 that is what this community is about: human connection...TO BE TRULY 
ALIVE!” (GL5) Doah expresses his feeling particularly well, using the 
bible to support his vision:<br>
<br>
Now, outside of Greasy Lake and Springsteen, and the second I saw the 
word "community" in your post, the very first thing I think of is Acts 
2:41-42 and Acts 4:32-37. Those two passages are the most beautiful 
picture of a community I have ever read with things like, "fellowship," 
"shared meals," and having things in common. Community, in general, is 
the best we can be a part of this side of Heaven. (GL 6)<br>
<br>
“<em class="text-italics">And the multitude of them that believed were 
of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the
 things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things in 
common.”</em> (Acts 4: 32)<br>
<br>
The sense of community among Springsteen fans is palpable and across the
 board taken for granted, much as a member of a religious group takes 
for granted his or her fellow members’ beliefs. This fan society is 
indeed inclusive and embracing (Turner 1982: 51).<br>
<br>
One of the important things that the Springsteen fans – those active on 
these ‘boards’ as they are called – experience is their shared sense of 
‘getting it.’ Invariably, this term is always used when discussing the 
depths of feeling Springsteen and his music and performances elicit. 
Victor Turner called this spontaneous communitas, this “getting it,” and
 described it as “...<em class="text-italics">a flash of lucid mutual 
understanding on the existential level. When even two people believe 
that they experience unity, all people are felt by these two, even if 
only for a flash, to be one”</em> (1982: 47-48). In this way, fans 
relate directly to one another, free of “culturally defined 
encumbrances” (Turner 1982: 48). Turner calls communitas the “shared 
flow” (1986: 133), and this is indeed how it feels, an emotion flowing 
from one fan to another, an electric jolt of mutual understanding. 
Cultural differences fall away and become inconsequential and language 
is no barrier. There is something visceral and elemental also about this
 flash of instant communion.<br>
<br>
This “flow” translates into activities as diverse as strangers hugging 
during a particularly intense musical moment during a show, or in giving
 what the world outside the fan community would call a total stranger a 
ride to or from a show, or offering these strangers places to stay. It 
is evidenced in the free trading or giving away of concert recordings 
called ‘bootlegs;’ and this good will and shared emotional state 
ultimately creates the climate for the charity works done in Bruce 
Springsteen’s name.<br>
<br>
A more cynical – and hence, less fan-accepted – analysis is that a 
devotee of any particular cultural commodity is in actuality not a 
member of a real community, but rather a member of a 
consumption-community; the feeling of community lasts not much past the 
act of consumption itself (the concert), <em class="text-italics">“...and then fades away, which is why we must consume repeatedly”</em>
 (Joe). I feel it necessary here to emphasize that the speaker “Joe” is 
by his own admission NOT a ‘fan’. It is too simple an explanation, and 
while it may apply to concert-goers of other groups, the idea of 
community as an act of consumption does not hold up. Some fans on these 
websites have never seen a concert, only vicariously experiencing a live
 show through reviews or listening to brucelegs, yet still feel the 
inclusion of the community. And the demonstrable evidence points to the 
contrary – Springsteen fans conduct themselves as a community beyond and
 outside of the concert-going milieu and spread the good news.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">CHAPTER FIVE <br>
<br>
LISTENING FOR THE LIBERATED WORD</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“American religion needs an American voice...As
 Jesus was a man of the people who spoke to them out of the experience 
of their day to day lives and proclaimed justice and freedom even in the
 midst of oppression – good news to the captive, etc. – so too must we 
listen for that liberating word in today’s vernacular.” </em><br>
(Reverend S. Meyer)<br>
<br>
A thoughtful and deliberate writer, Springsteen’s early lyrics center 
around themes familiar to and of concern to many people – belonging, 
inclusion, freedom, and future. These themes transcend age groups, and 
as one teenaged fan wrote: “What I love most about his music is I can 
hear him tell a story and yea I’ve been in that situation, and in some 
cases take advice he gave back in 1985 and apply to 2004...whenever I 
hear something in his music that I can relate to it draws me closer to 
it” (badscooter). ‘Converts’ see their own experiences reflected in 
Springsteen’s words. His honesty and the hope highlighted in his songs 
provide members of the ‘congregation’ with the tools – philosophy, 
philanthropy, compassion – to cope in an increasingly inhospitable 
society. Devotees find solace in these songs in much the same way that 
devoutly practicing religious people find solace in the sacred texts of 
their religions. There is a Springsteen line appropriate for most any 
event.<br>
<br>
As mentioned previously, Springsteen describes his music and songs as being <em class="text-italics">“...not
	literally	autobiographical...but	in	some	way	they’re	emotionally 
autobiographical...some emotional thread you’ve tried to use to make 
your own way through what can feel like a particularly imponderable 
existence”</em> (Primeaux 1996: 8,17). <br>
<br>
In this we, his audience, can see ourselves. He is obviously not singing
 about himself, but about those people suffering, hurting and struggling
 in this ‘imponderable existence.’ It is this “empathetic 
identification,” this “reaching out to the other for the other” 
(Primeaux 1996: 96) that the fans respond to, coupled with his apparent 
authenticity and corresponding behavior. His fans in some fashion trust 
in his work as a reflection of the man, and appreciate his fierce 
commitment to his audience (Smith 2002: 123). It is also this 
identification that leads to the “works of faith” performed by a variety
 of the initiated, as described in the next chapter.<br>
<br>
Connecting Mr. Springsteen’s music to faith and spirituality is not 
difficult for one who has listened to his music, and indeed, numerous 
articles in both the popular press and professional journals by clergy 
and lay people alike attest to this. Biblical allusions abound in his 
lyrics while portraying themes of alienation and community, hope, 
betrayal, redemption, grace and generosity (Yamin 1990: 17). Sermons 
have been written using his lyrics (see appendix 2). While calling 
himself a ‘lapsed-Catholic,’ Springsteen seems unable – and unwilling – 
to escape his Catholic upbringing. Christopher Stratton, in his piece 
“Springsteen and the Minor Prophets” likens Bruce to Micah: both are 
seeking to imbue a nation with moral guidance, “drawing them back to 
God” and giving hope back to the people while proclaiming the 
“culpability of all” (2007). Stratton may be speaking in hyperbole when 
he proclaims, by quoting Abraham Joshua Heschel, that Springsteen is one
 “...whose image is our refuge in distress, and whose voice and vision 
sustain our faith.’ His red baseball cap and blue jeans are to America 
what camel’s hair and locust were to ancient Israel” (2007). But to his 
fans, Springsteen does function as a source of both inspiration and 
solace. And yes, some do apotheosize him. As one fan said, “.<em class="text-italics">..in
 the end, the only church that’s ever worked for me is the Church of 
Bruce Springsteen...I don’t think he’s the Messiah, although he may very
 well be a Bodhisattiva”</em> (Somerset 2007).<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Sowing Seeds of Spirituality: The Covenant</strong><br>
<br>
“<em class="text-italics">Show a Little Faith, There’s Magic in the Night</em>” <br>
(Thunder Road 1975) <br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“I know this is idealistic but part of the idea
 our band had from the beginning was that you did not have to lose your 
connection to the people you write for. I don’t believe that fame or 
success means that you lose that connection, and I don’t believe that 
makin’ more money means you lose it. Because that’s not where the 
essence of what you are lies. That’s not what separates people. What 
separates people are the things that are in their heart. So I can just 
never surrender to that idea. Because I know that before I started 
playing, I was alone. And one of the reasons I picked up the guitar was 
that I wanted to be part of something...and I ain’t about to give it up 
now...one of the things always on my mind to do was to maintain 
connections with the people I’d grown up with, and the sense of 
community where I came from...the danger of fame is in forgetting...”</em> <br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen (Marsh 2004: 315)<br>
<br>
<br>
There is little doubt that a Springsteen concert awards the faithful 
with a sense of community and communion, if not holiness. This sense of 
connection that Springsteen mentions in the above quote works to form 
the basis of the covenant between Bruce and his fans, to never forget 
who and where he came from, and the debt and responsibility he owes his 
followers: to be honest and ‘true’ to his audience while expecting the 
same in return. And it is what creates the intimacy and sense of 
connection with Springsteen. This is also an oecumenical congregation, 
embracing all faiths. While the imagery in Springsteen’s songs is 
decidedly Christian, and more pointedly Catholic, the lyrics read in 
such as way as to be more inclusive should one choose to look past the 
Christian images. One long-standing and stalwart fan has written a book,
 “Greetings from Bury Park,” that details growing up Muslim in England, 
and how Springsteen played a part in his maturation (Manzour 2007). 
Another beloved fan tale tells the “parable” of a young man who met 
Bruce in a movie theatre and invited him home to meet his parents; this 
young man was an Orthodox Jew, wearing the garb of his sect. All are 
welcome in the Ministry of Rock and Roll, an embracing and inclusive 
congregation.<br>
<br>
Mircea Eliade said that the spiritual man lives near his sacred space to
 be closer to his God, to share the mystery and might of the “divine 
presence;” this is the spot where he can receive “the revelation of a 
reality” beyond that of his ordinary life (1959:24). Bruce has said that
 some people pray and some people play music (Yamin 1990: 3). The 
concert hall serves as Springsteen’s divine/sacred space, and he is able
 to pass this holiness on to his congregants, the faithful fans gathered
 for the ‘service.’ George Yamin, in the Journal of Religious Studies, 
says that Springsteen’s music is “nothing less than a modern-day 
theological epic – implicitly written in accordance with a single, 
comprehensive design – in which Springsteen assimilates and 
reinterprets, in terms suitable for his listeners, many of the essential
 ideas of the Hebrew-Christian tradition” (Yamin 1990: 4).<br>
<br>
“Rock and roll,” says Danny Duncan Collum, “is a communal affair” (2000:
 55), and indeed Springsteen and his audience know this. This is the 
basis of the covenant Springsteen has implicitly made with his fans: 
“you be true to me, and I’ll be true to you.” He has stated time and 
again in numerous interviews that his is a job, and he owes his audience
 honesty and sincerity, as well as a damn good rock show. He seems self-
 reflective enough to realize and acknowledge that the fans are in part 
responsible for keeping his creative impulses flowing. <em class="text-italics">“...I
 think that’s what people come for; they want to be lifted up and 
grounded at the same time...hey, you’re not alone, I’m not alone..</em>.”
 (Graff 2005: xx). When questioned about his absolute complete abandon 
in concert and why he seemed to give so much of himself, he answered:<br>
said:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">There may be no tomorrow...if you start 
rationing, you’re living life bit by bit...that’s what I get the most 
satisfaction out of: to know that tonight when I go to bed I did my 
best. If you go to the show, the kid has a ticket for tonight. He’s got 
no ticket for the show in L.A. or New York...You can’t live on what you 
did yesterday or plan what’s gonna happen tomorrow. That’s what rock ‘n’
 roll is” a promise, an oath. It’s about being as true as you can be at 
any particular moment.</em><br>
(Cross 1989: 81) <br>
<br>
In concert during The Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, a more mature and older Bruce said-<br>
<em class="text-italics"><br>
Our mission is a search for beauty, and in beauty there is hope, and in 
hope there is some sense of divine love, of faith, of community and 
possibility, of things that would combat the brutality and the violence 
and the suffering. That’s what I’m trying to lay out there. It’s a 
survival guide.<br>
For many of his faithful, his music is exactly that – a survival guide fed on divine love. </em><br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“I believe in the love that you gave me, I 
believe in the faith that can save me, I believe in the hope and I pray 
that someday it may raise me above these badlands”</em><br>
 (Springsteen 1978) –<br>
<br>
 These words could be as easily directed to his God as well as his 
audience. And the audience responds as joyously as any congregation 
responding to the Gospel, the Q’uran, or any other sacred text or hymn. 
One group of dedicated fans from Northern California refers to itself, 
with more than a little seriousness, as the “Church of Bruce” (Sanders 
2003), a term echoed in other fan communities.<em class="text-italics"> “Bruce feeds my soul...it’s like a religion, you just can’t explain it,</em>” says one fan, while another says “<em class="text-italics">He gives us hope love and faith...it’s like church. I get spiritually uplifted” </em>(Sanders
 2003). The terms used by many fans when describing their Springsteen 
connection include hyperbolic terms such as transformative, 
life-changing, redemptive, and other expressions usually associated with
 a deeply religious experience.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Good news, good works</strong><br>
<br>
Of no small significance is the way in which fans also unite to help 
each other out. One of the members of the group mentioned above fell on 
hard times recently, losing health, employment, and housing. Unknown to 
this person, the group took up a collection and presented fan x with a 
sizeable check to help defray living expenses. And some years ago, on 
the official Sony Springsteen website now lost to the Ethernet, 
brucespringsteen.net, one California fan was homeless and jobless as a 
result of devastating wildfires that had spread through Southern 
California. She posted her plight, and the members of a forum thread 
called “Tramps Like Us” took up a collection and sent money as well as 
catnip and cat food for the fan’s cat to help her through those hard 
times. This same group of fans also managed to get a Christmas tree and 
presents to a single-mom fan who’d recently lost her home and job. Other
 fans collect toiletries to send to military personnel in Iraq while 
maintaining a neutral position on the war itself. These supply drives 
and charitable collections could be the equivalent of the passing of the
 collection plate in other houses of worship.<br>
<br>
The Clergy is also represented among the Springsteen faithful. Reverend 
B. is the 44 year old senior minister at a Methodist church in North 
Carolina. A graduate of a Kentucky Baptist Divinity School, he chose to 
leave the Baptist church and become a Methodist minister after what he 
called a “fundamentalist takeover.” He and his wife have been 
Springsteen fans for over thirty years, and have seen any number of live
 shows. This April, Reverend B is planning a series of sermons and 
services crafted around the songs of Bruce Springsteen. (See appendix 2 )
 His church offers two services on Sundays: a 9am contemporary service, 
complete with a rock ensemble made up of congregation members, and an 11
 o’clock service that he termed more traditional. He has no qualms about
 conducting the 9 o’clock services, but says he is carefully weighing 
how to present the Springsteen songs to his more traditional audience. I
 asked him if he felt any misgivings about using contemporary rock songs
 within the context of his religious service, and he replied, “<em class="text-italics">Not at all. Bruce speaks to the human condition that we all<br>
experience; I will just need to present it more carefully at my later 
service.” He also believes that the music connects to “something deeper.</em>”<br>
<br>
 This plays into the supposition posited by Gordon Lynch that there is a
 longing felt by many people for a spirituality that is “liberated from 
the certainties of the institutional Church...” and who are looking for 
spiritual inspiration, for want of a better term, from someone who is 
more like themselves, someone with whom they can more readily identify 
(Lynch 2004: 163). The idea that a Springsteen concert can closely 
resemble a religious service – albeit a high-spirited one – did not seem
 like a foreign idea to Reverend B. I asked him why he chose 
Springsteen, and he replied because the music was fairly popular and 
referenced spiritual things in the lyrics. In the past, he has 
constructed sermons and services around other music and, given Bruce’s 
scheduled appearance in April, he decided that now was the proper time 
for Springsteen.<br>
<br>
Reverend B, who has a long-standing familiarity and love of 
Springsteen’s music, took his then 17 year old son with him to see The 
Rising Tour in Greensboro on December 8, 2002, and called it “One of the
 best nights I had with my teenager. When he went into ‘The Rising’ my 
son turned to me and said ‘Dad, I’ve never seen anything so amazing!’” 
He went on to speak about the healing that this particular tour and 
album provided for many fans after the horrific events of September 11, 
2001. Reverend B was so taken with the performance and the emotional 
fulfillment it provided that he went to see another show in Chapel Hill 
the following spring. (This is a repeated pattern amongst Springsteen 
fans, the need to see multiple shows on any given tour.)<br>
Reverend B also spoke about the shared – actual or assumed – character 
of mutual fans, and the trust this shared musical experience creates, 
echoing opinions of other fans with whom I have spoken. Many devotees 
see a deeper meaning in their musical experience, citing the stimulus to
 “...never sit back...always remember that we are here for others, not 
just for ourselves. And I think that’s also a basic tenet of religion. I
 do good things because it’s the right thing to do...and I think that is
 a core of many songs (LOFG).” One practicing, deeply Christian fan told
 me:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">I realize that the joyful exuberance I feel at a
 Bruce Springsteen concert is God-given, just as Bruce’s creative genius
 and masterful performing skills are God-given. Just as I am made up of 
body, soul, and spirit in a way I can’t explain, but know to be true, 
Bruce’s songs connect with my spirit and thereby enrich my life. My life
 has followed the wonderful, fulfilling, surprising path that God, in 
His wisdom, has laid out for me. In some mysterious, unnamable fashion, 
Bruce Springsteen, the man, and his music has accompanied me along the 
journey. Perhaps that is why our creator God who made us in His image 
gave us the gift of art. I cannot imagine my life without the art of 
Bruce Springsteen.</em> (jj)<br>
<br>
This ineffable quality again repeats in fans’ descriptions of what they 
hear and feel both in and through Springsteen’s music. (It is of 
interest to note here that the above quoted person is the mother of five
 and not your typical rock and roll fan – if there even is such a 
creature.) Other fans talk about Springsteen’s songs as “...God speaking
 directly to me through these words” (hanaree), or connecting them to 
“...a better/higher realization and recognition” (yark). 
Hardgirloneasystreet says: “...I was truly in the church of Bruce. I 
believe that some people are put on this earth to unite us, move us, 
fill us with joy. That is Bruce.”<br>
<br>
 Blueguitar had this to say about a recent show:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">He (Bruce) made his case for fighting back 
against the squalor with nothing but sweat drenched desire, his own 
personal fight to open the door and let people dance away their own 
demons with a physically demanding show that was touched with the 
stirring intellectuality and spiritual hope, all in the guise of a rock 
and roll show...Bruce used the echo and call to get them (the audience) 
to respond to him...Bruce sang, “It’s all right, it’s all right, it’s 
all right,” and the audience threw up their hands and yelled back 
“yeah,” a positive confirmation to counter this world of pain and 
negativity.<br>
In concert, Bruce can take his audience from “...hell to this blessed 
life...in the spiritual Church of Springsteen...the only redemption that
 matters is the “Beat of your heart, the beat of your heart, the beat of
 your heart</em>” (blueguitar).<br>
<br>
The Reverend Suzanne Meyer, the Unitarian minister who sees Springsteen 
as the “America’s religious voice”, has also fashioned a service and 
sermon around Bruce Springsteen. (See appendix 3) In a personal email, 
she stated that the author <em class="text-italics">“...of a new gospel is anyone who has the courage and conviction to step out of the crowd and speak the truth..</em>.”
 and she sees Springsteen as one of these messengers.	The	desire	to 
introduce family and friends to the experience of Springsteen’s live 
shows and to share the emotional and spiritual connection is another 
common trait of the Springsteen fan community. While ‘finding’ Bruce may
 have been a solitary and individual experience similar to the 
Protestant “born again” conversion (Cavicchi 1998:43), the ‘convert’ now
 imbued with such joy wishes to share it. Every fan I have spoken with 
has related the experience of taking a close friend or loved one to a 
show in the hopes that lightening will strike, the uninitiated’s eyes 
will be opened, and another fan will be imbued with the joy and 
converted. In particular, many parents take their children in the hopes 
of creating that bridge of communication music can provide and 
facilitating their ‘conversion.’ I have met families of three 
generations of Springsteen fans at shows: Mom H. brought both her 
eighty-plus year old mother and teenaged daughter to a 2003 show in 
Boston. It is a common sight to see families in the audience with 
children of all ages. While in France to attend a concert in 2007, I met
 a family from the U.S. – Mom, Dad, and three pre-teen and teenaged 
children attempting to obtain tickets to the Springsteen show in Paris. 
Much like the joy that is found in a newly-embraced religious belief, 
sharing Bruce and watching the convert ‘get it’ creates a feeling of 
sanctity and holy gratitude.<br>

<br>
 SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT – GOOD NEWS THROUGH SOCIAL JUSTIC</strong>E<br>
<br>
“<em class="text-italics">...and remember, nobody wins unless everybody wins”</em><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen in concert <br>
<br>
On September 20, 1981, Bruce played a sold-out concert in Los Angeles, 
with all the proceeds going to the Vietnam Veterans Association, raising
 over a quarter of a million dollars: “Without Bruce and that evening, 
we would not have made it, we would have had to close down” said 
then-VVA president Bob Muller (Marsh 2004: 310). At the beginning of 
that night’s performance, Muller took the stage and addressed the 
audience. One particular poignant section of speech talked about the 
lack of help that the Vietnam Vets were getting from the government or 
private industry:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">It’s a little bit ironic that for the years 
that we’ve been tryin,’ when the businesses haven’t come behind us and 
the political leaders have failed to rally behind us that, when you 
remember the divisions within our own generation about the war, it 
ultimately turns out to be the very symbol of our generation – rock and 
roll! – that brings us together. And it is rock and roll that is going 
to provide the healing process that everybody needs.</em> (Marsh 2004: 313). <br>
<br>
Without Springsteen, Muller says, there would have been no Vietnam 
Veterans movement (Marsh 2004:314). This benefit was one of the initial 
examples of the “nobody wins unless everybody wins” tenet that was an 
often spoken line by Bruce while onstage during the mid to late 
eighties, the Springsteen equivalent of the Golden Rule, frequently 
repeated by his fans, and one he seems to take to heart. This line may 
also reflect a literal manifestation of what Bruce was – and still - is 
doing behind the scenes, and away from the public eye and tabloids. 
Springsteen has been privately and without fanfare supporting a number 
of charitable organizations over the past several decades.<br>
<br>
Prior to 1984, Springsteen and the E Street Band, or Springsteen solo, 
had appeared at several big-name rock and roll benefits. The near - 
catastrophic disaster at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island prompted a 
group of West Coast musicians to form MUSE – Musicians United for Safe 
Energy – and to organize an all-star fund raiser at Madison Square 
Garden in New York City in late 1979 that came to be known via album and
 video as No Nukes (Marsh 2003:214). While No Nukes was a moderate 
success, it was the Vietnam Vets’ benefit that seems to have been the 
real spiritual turning point for Bruce. In an interview with Rolling 
Stone Magazine’s Kurt Loder, Springsteen said:<br>
<br>
I want to try and just work more directly with people, try to find some 
way that my band can tie into the communities that we come into...human 
politics. I think that people on their own can do a lot...Where do the 
aesthetic issues that you write about intersect with some sort of 
concrete action, some direct involvement in the communities that your 
audience comes from? (Marsh 2003:489).<br>
<br>
Springsteen and his management team began to search for groups around 
the country that benefited “the hungry, the homeless, and the 
unemployed” (Marsh 2003:489).<br>
<br>
This was done without fanfare and publicity, and to this day, it is 
difficult tracking all of Springsteen’s charitable donations. In each 
city he visited, he met with local groups, expressing his “concern for 
depressed conditions” in the communities, and presented them with a 
significant donation; there was a stipulation included with the 
donation, though, that the organization wait until after the first show 
to discuss the contribution (Marsh 2003: 498). [When asked by the press 
why he chose not to make a statement, his assistant Barbara Carr 
replied, “This is his statement” (Marsh 2003: 498).] He began making 
announcements from the stage encouraging his fans to get involved, 
either through donations, or by working with the organizations. At a 
show in Syracuse, New York he asked if anyone in the audience could 
donate a forklift to the new Food Bank of Central New York; within a 
week, someone did (Marsh 2003: 510). A favorite cause, and one that he 
still actively supports, the local food banks and representatives were 
invited to collect at each performance; tickets were also provided to be
 auctioned off with proceeds going to the food bank. These organizations
 helped the people that Bruce most related to, people who must have 
reminded him of his childhood and what his life could have been.<br>
<br>
These charitable connections happened, and continue to happen, in each 
and every city visited and in each and every country as well. In 
England, Springsteen contributed to a local miners’ union strike fund, 
donating some 16,000 pounds to the Miners’ Wives Support Group. In 
Australia, he donated to the Childrens Hospital/Youth Ward, the Prince 
Alexander Hospital Transplant Trust Fund, and the Vietnam Veterans 
Association of Australia. In Japan, Springsteen’s people had to dig hard
 to find an appropriate social organization as food banks did not exist 
there; instead, he donated to a fund that helped “unmarriageable widows 
of men who had died in traffic accidents” (Marsh 2003:530). In Clifton, 
Arizona, Springsteen provided the means to keep the People’s Clinic open
 in a town ravaged by a years-long copper miners’ strike. Days away from
 closing, Bruce’s donation enabled the clinic to move to a better 
facility and remain open (Marsh 2003: 500). In Los Angeles County, he 
visited the union hall for steelworkers Local 1845 and participated in a
 theater workshop, leaving concert tickets for the union members (Marsh 
2003: 501).<br>
<br>
For Springsteen, the American Dream “...ain’t about two cars in the 
garage. It’s about people living and working together without steppin’ 
on each other” (Marsh 2003: 503-04). He literally put his money where 
his populist mouth was to the tune of $10,000 to $25,000 depending on 
the venue (Marsh 2003: 493-94). He continues to do this today, 
supporting the Second Harvest Food Banks as well as the Community for 
Fairness and Dignity for the Homeless, and the National Union for the 
Homeless, among other causes (See appendix 4 for a partial list of 
charities to which he now regularly contributes – some two dozen 
different organizations). Recently, a minister in North Carolina told me
 that each time Springsteen plays in the state, he donates $10,000 to 
the Christian Urban Ministry – but I was unable to verify this. It is 
policy apparently in the Springsteen management organization to decline 
to talk about what Bruce must see as a private matter. The best leaders 
lead by example, and Bruce has set the bar high; fans see his efforts to
 contribute to change and feel inspired to do so themselves – maybe not 
all fans, and not to the extent that Bruce does, but we try and do what 
we can. “Nobody wins unless everybody wins.”<br>
<br>
More recently, it appears that Springsteen’s interest in, and support 
of, local food growing initiatives has been increasing. At a recent show
 in Rochester, New York (March 6, 2008), an organization called 
“Rochester Roots” had representatives collecting in the arena. When I 
approached a worker and attempted to find out if Bruce had made a 
monetary donation, the worker quite politely told me that she was not 
free to give me that information, consistent with Springsteen policy. 
This organization, according to their literature, is committed to 
creating a local and sustainable food system that is “nutritionally, 
ecologically, and economically sound” through education, advocacy and 
community development. They also run a school community garden project, 
turning underutilized schoolyards into urban gardens; at present, they 
work with three local elementary schools located in areas of Rochester 
“where food insecurity is high” (rochesterroots.org).<br>
<br>
In the same vein, a recent email alerted me to the news that 
Springsteen’s people had contacted a Greensboro grassroots group related
 to the University of North Carolina- Greensboro campus. Called Project 
Greenleaf (Greenleaf.uncg.edu), it is a similar type of program as the 
Rochester organization, and they have been invited to ‘pass the hat’ at 
the upcoming April 2008 show. Their website states:<br>
The mission of Project Green Leaf is to promote and support a local 
agro-food system. Project Green Leaf is dedicated to sustaining local 
agriculture by strengthening community between farmers and consumers, 
thus providing for better quality of living. By promoting various 
activities, such as direct marketing and educational/outreach programs, 
we assist in developing the connections necessary for a local agro-food 
system.<br>
<br>
According to Project Greenleaf’s founder, the Springsteen representative
 who made contact stated that Greenleaf was “the wave of the future.” 
These initiatives are in line philosophically with the organizations in 
which Bruce has historically been interested, organizations that allow 
people to help themselves.<br>
In addition to the food bank donations all over the country, Springsteen
 also gives freely of his services in diverse settings and for diverse 
reasons. He has performed benefits to keep a struggling magazine afloat 
(Pulitizer prize winning author Robert Cole’s “Double Take”), to buy 
uniforms and instruments for the Asbury Park High School marching band 
as well as emergency medical equipment for the local rescue squad 
(Christmas shows), for his children’s school (Rumson County Day School),
 for the Light of Day foundation which funds Parkinson’s Disease 
research, and for the Kristen Ann Carr Sarcoma Fund, as well as a fund 
raiser in Pittsburg after floods there in 2004. Rarely will Bruce appear
 at the more celebrity-laden charity events.<br>
<br>
This idea of sharing the best of ourselves, to help “everybody win,” can
 be seen in the number of charitable events and organizations organized 
in Springsteen’s name. One such site is run by the Orel family who also 
host a website with many different kinds of Springsteen trivia and 
information (matt.orel.ws/index.html). But additionally, the Orel family
 has made an arrangement with the website amazon.com to act as a portal 
to Amazon. Any purchases made by using the Orel link to Amazon result in
 a commissio that the Orel family then matches and donates to a charity 
favored by Bruce Springsteen. (See appendix 5 for an accounting from the
 fourth fiscal quarter of 2005 through the third fiscal quarter of 
2007). For the first three quarters of 2007, this family distributed 
$265 to three different charities. You can also read reviews of some of 
the several dozens shows that Matt, the webmaster and involved 
Springsteen fan, has attended.<br>
Dedicated fans following Springsteen’s example have organized and made 
sizable donations to a number of charities. Prior to a recent show in 
Buffalo, New York, members of the website backstreets.com organized a 
pre-show party. Fans signing up for the party paid ten dollars, and this
 got them a name tag with their screen name on it and assorted 
appetizers. People had donated a variety of items to be raffled off, and
 the proceeds of this raffle, along with the ten dollar fees minus the 
restaurant bill, was donated to the Western New York branch of Second 
Harvest Food Bank – some $500.00. As mentioned previously, at a 2003 
show, I was able to collect nearly $2000 in a matter of minutes at a 
tailgate party of another website, greasylake.org. Currently, 
backstreets.com members are sponsoring a women’s build day at a Habitat 
for Humanity site in New Jersey; twenty women have signed up to help 
build this house, the maximum number of volunteers Habitat can handle 
that day.<br>
<br>
One of the most ambitious of the fan initiatives is the “Bruce Sent Me” campaign (<a href="http://www.brucesentme.com/" class="postlink">www.brucesentme.com</a>). To quote from the website,<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“The idea is to demonstrate in a tangible way 
what a difference the music we love can make in the world... ‘WITH THESE
 HANDS’ we are making a difference. Bruce Sent Me is not interested in 
collecting your money.</em><br>
<br>
We simply want to inspire you to share and to look out for those less 
fortunate. We were moved by Bruce's encouragement to "rise up" and we 
are simply here to pass that thought along. Although Bruce Springsteen 
is not affiliated in any way with Bruce Sent Me (if you're looking for 
his official site, a link is provided below), we'd like to believe he 
approves of the way we heeded his advice. If you feel it too, please 
share this idea with others in any way you feel comfortable. To borrow a
 phrase from the Boss, "Turn it up!" (note: “Turn it up” is a line from 
“Mary’s Place)<br>
<br>
The idea for “Bruce Sent Me” had its birth in a posting on the fan site 
Backstreets.com encouraging fans to heed Bruce’s evening ‘public service
 announcement’ as he called it, and donate to suggested charities. 
Within days, thousands of dollars were raised (Brucesentme). A notice on
 the home page of the site says succinctly that “Bruce Sent Me is not 
interested in collecting your money. We simply want to inspire you to 
share and look out for those less fortunate.” Were it not for the 
concerned spirit of Bruce himself, it is doubtful that this site would 
exist. Shortly after its inception and just prior to Thanksgiving, the 
only refrigerated truck owned by the Community Food Bank of New Jersey 
was involved with an accident on the New Jersey Turnpike, losing its 
entire shipment of 2000 turkeys targeted for needy families. Within a 
week, Bruce Sent Me raised $6000 to assist in the replacement of the 
truck and the Thanksgiving turkeys (Strauss 2003: 1). <br>
<br>
(Note: Bruce himself has been known to simply drop in to the warehouse 
of the food bank to help unload trucks.) Links on the Bruce Sent Me site
 take one directly to America’s Second Harvest Food Banks website, where
 the food bank has arranged that donations can be acknowledged as Bruce 
Sent Me donations <br>
<br>
What, really, can be more spiritual than doing ‘good works,’ to treat 
each human being with the dignity and respect awarded them by the 
Creator? Words come cheaply, but actions again can be love made 
manifest. These deeds are all a direct result of fans being touched by 
Bruce’s music and more pointedly his humanity and compassion; this is a 
tangible way for fans to honor their avatar. Without his example, likely
 none of this fan- sponsored altruism would take place.<br>
And faith will be rewarded sometimes: on July 31, 2004, during a Habitat
 for Humanity work day organized by btxers, as members of the 
backstreets.com website are known, Springsteen showed up to share pizza 
and beers at the end of the day (Celano 2004. see photo in appendix 2). 
Whether by word, music, or deed, Bruce serves as a moral compass in some
 fashion for his followers, reminding us that we are, indeed, our 
brothers’ keeper, and we are all out here on this road together.<br>

<br>
To understand the emotional depths of fan involvement in the community 
both actual and virtual, it is best to hear what fans have to say 
themselves, to hear their witnessing and conversion stories as they tell
 them in their own words. The stories all have a familiar ring and 
progression: alone, hearing a song that strikes a chord, experiencing a 
sudden epiphany and realization of joy – again, not unlike my experience
 being saved at a Billy Graham Crusade. And this also feeds into the 
sense of shared experience, knowing that fellow fans have felt this way,
 have been hit by the same bolt of Springsteen. The only identification 
used for these stories are screen names used on internet bulletin 
boards. Some of these stories deserve to be told unedited, while others 
will be excerpted. The names used are the screen names used on-line. 
SpringsteenMagic:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">When I was born, my parents – especially my 
father – were huge Bruce fans. I grew up on his music...the first song I
 remember my dad playing for me was “Thunder Road”, on the Greatest Hits
 CD. As I grew up, I learned to appreciate the music more and more. My 
dad was diagnosed with MS before I was born. As I got older, he began to
 get sicker, and was eventually put in the hospital, unable to walk or 
use his arms. My sister and I were there with him all the time and he 
would always ask my mom to put on his Bruce CDs. The Rising album came 
out when he was in the hospital, and I still remember listening to it 
with him for the first time. I can’t really describe it, but I remember 
not saying a word the whole time the album ran...Bruce began to be 
extremely important to me...I began to start my own Bruce collection, 
and his music helped me a lot when my dad was sick. My father passed 
away almost three years ago, and The Rising was<br>
the album that got me through it. Some of my best times with my dad I 
associate with Bruce, because his music was always in the background. I 
remember his face when his cousin brought him a t-shirt from The Rising 
tour...I hadn’t seen him smile like that in a while. Hearing “Thunder 
Road” live in Hamilton was absolutely incredible – I couldn’t help but 
cry, I was extremely moved, and felt like my dad was there somehow. The 
last few years have been rough for me, and I can honestly say that – at 
times – as strange as it sounds, I felt like Bruce was my best friend, 
and the only one who understood what I felt, because I heard it all in 
his songs. So as much as I love the rock ‘n’ roll aspect to his songs, 
the words that he has written have meant so much more to me, and really 
helped shape who I am today.</em><br>
<br>
This notion of Bruce “understanding” who his fans are, what they are 
going through, is a strand that runs through many fan stories and no 
doubt accounts for much of the emotional attachment many fans feel. The 
question of whether this is true is insignificant to the feeling. 
Passiac factory says that a Springsteen performance gives “..<em class="text-italics">.a chance for my old heart to beat young again..</em>.”<br>
<br>
 Misadventure says the shows are “<em class="text-italics">...communal 
rituals...it’s not unlike church. It’s also a sort of contact – 
communion. Bruce responds to his audience...he feeds off of us and we 
feed off of him.”</em><br>
<br>
 Another younger fan, Doah, says:<br>
<em class="text-italics"><br>
It’s not just simply good rock ‘n’ roll. I find it more like a spiritual
 experience. I would also swear that there’s some sort of chemical 
reaction that occurs in my body that causes euphoria! I know I’ve 
mentioned the “spiritual” word to you before, but I mean it. The only 
other analogy I can come up with is a drug. My wife has asked me before,
 “honey, do you have to see him more than once a week? You’re seeing him
 Monday, why do you have to see him on Tuesday?” I’m like, Well, does a 
heroin addict say, “you know, I already shot up last night so I think 
I’ll pass tonight.”</em> I don’t think so!<br>
<br>
Again, the experiencing of euphoria is also something found in the 
evangelical experience of being ‘born again.’ In this sense, fans are 
‘born anew’ at each performance they attend. Other comments state that 
seeing Springsteen recharges spiritual and emotional batteries.<br>
<br>
The faithful all have a ‘come-to-Bruce’ story that usually involves 
hearing a particular song for the first time. “I went home and put on 
side one...I didn’t play anything but side two for a month” (diane). 
Some stories are a bit more involved and poignant, such as NC’s:<br>
In Dec. 1980 I moved to Palmer Alaska. I was miserable because I had to 
leave my school &amp; friends. I hated it here. It was a small town 
about 40 miles from Anchorage. The night before John Lennon was shot <br>
<br>
I was in my room and found on the top shelve of my closet and old clock 
radio. I remember the color was a god-awful dull yellow. Wasn’t sure if 
it even worked but I plugged it in. Sure enough it worked. I was able to
 pick up an album oriented rock station out of Anchorage. At 10:00 pm 
every Sunday they would play an album in its entirety. As fate would 
have it that Sun. night they played The River. BOTH ALBUMS! Anyway, That
 night I was in my room with the lights off and the curtains open 
watching the aurora borealis and I listened to every song... every word.
 Sometimes I think back and wonder what if I<br>
had not found that old clock radio in my closet. Redheadfromtoronto remembers hearing the title song from the album mentioned<br>
above, The River, on her grandmother’s white kitchen radio, and being 
“haunted by the ending.” “Now those memories come back to haunt me, they
 haunt me like a curse. Is a dream a lie if it don’t come true, or is it
 something worse...”<br>
<br>
Leahinjersey says she first identified with the Tunnel of Love album, 
written during a time of emotional turmoil for Springsteen:<br>
<br>
 “I was going through a divorce from my first husband, some major 
depression...”. Whoresandgamblers story started with the Live 75-85 set 
of albums: “the songs the stories of teenage angst. Dedicating a song to
 the young people ‘Because the next time they are going to be looking to
 you, and you will need a lot of information to know what you are going 
to do.’...Everything was like Bruce a speaking directly to me.” <br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Some years later, this man and his wife were 
separating, and he...grabbed a random tape and stuck it in.  Suddenly my
 Bruceness was rededicated. LINYC (Live in New York City, a dvd) picked 
up where Live 75-85 left off. It was different, things had changed 
people had grown up, but Bruce was there singing directly to me and 
knowing exactly what I needed to hear. It took me to 2002 to get to a 
live show but I have since been to 8. Bruce music has been the 
soundtrack of my life.<br>
</em><br>
BigOldDinosaur says that after seeing a show, “.<em class="text-italics">..I
 was completely hooked. I’d never seen someone perform with such energy,
 just laying it all out there like that. 4 days later I went to Utica, 
and the odyssey had begun and is still continuing 160+ shows later.”<br>
</em><br>
<br>
And chestercat, a late-comer to the fold has this to say about her first concert at the age of forty in 2002:<em class="text-italics">
 “A couple of bars into the first song, I got hit by something. I 
started to sob and cried pretty much through the whole thing. 
Roostershmoo and I went back the next night...” Other fans speak of 
being “baptized in the fires of the majesty, the ministry of rock ‘n’ 
roll.”</em> The passion and fervor that fills these fan-recollections is
 obvious and potent, and reminiscent of the religious fever of a revival
 meeting. The sentiments of unigus sums up the feelings of most in the 
Springsteen community, but more pointedly those participants on the 
various internet sites:<br>
<br>
Bruce has always been the soundtrack of my life...he has always 
vocalized my thoughts, fears, hopes, and dreams. His songs always remind
 me of people and places, connecting me in ways I never would have 
fathomed, bringing me to a better/higher realization and recognition...I
 am so thankful that I’m in the presence of friends that I will never 
have to explain that to cause you to GET IT.<br>
<br>
This is one common sentiment repeated over and over by fans, regardless 
of their geographical location, gender, sexual orientation or social 
class - that Bruce has provided them with the soundtrack of their lives,
 Bruce ‘understands’ them. Close to fifty percent of all fans I have 
spoken with over the years have expressed these feelings.. Given that 
Springsteen has long been called the quintessential ‘American’ artist, I
 found it curious that fans in other countries would also feel this way.
 The American love affair with the automobile, and the car imagery in 
Springsteen’s songs do not seem very European. Invariably, however, when
 I questioned fans in Germany and France about this, and what they found
 to identify with in Bruce’s music, their answers dismissed his 
‘American- ness’ and focused on his humanity and the greater human 
themes of love and sorrow, rejection and redemption, fulfillment and 
disappointment.<br>
<br>

CONCLUSION</strong><br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“Tomorrow There’ll be Sunshine and All this Darkness Past</em>”<br>
(Land of Hope and Dreams, 2001)<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“Now I’m out here on this road, alone on this road tonight<br>
I close my eyes and feel so many friends around me in the early evening light.<br>
And the miles we have come, and the battles won and lost<br>
Are just so many roads traveled, and just so many rivers crossed.<br>
And I ask God for the strength and faith in one another<br>
‘Cause it’s a good night for a ride ‘cross this river to the other side<br>
My blood brothers.</em>”<br>
(Blood Brothers, 1995)<br>
<br>
This thesis has documented the ways in which fans have created a 
community and a spiritual home for themselves, open and welcoming to all
 those likewise inspired by the words, music, and deeds of Bruce 
Springsteen. Springsteen has himself laid the groundwork for this and 
consequently can claim some credit for the positive ways in which his 
fans are working towards maintaining this community and doing good work 
in the world. To paraphrase Springsteen: the world we carry in our 
hearts is waiting, we just need to help manifest its potential 
greatness. By their own accounts, these congregants have been supplied 
with spiritual/emotional sustenance, gaining solace and companionship in
 some fashion equal to the comfort and companionship provided by church 
congregations or ministerial counseling. Bruce says this is his job: <br>
<br>
That’s my business, that’s what it’s all about – trying to connect to 
you. It comes down to trying to make people happy, feel less lonely, but
 also about being a conduit for a dialogue about the events of the day, 
the issues that impact people’s lives, personal and social and political
 and religious. That’s how I always saw the job of our band. That was my
 service...I can’t do it by myself. I need my audience.. You’re in that 
room together, that dark room together. (Levy 2007: 52).<br>
For this man Bruce Springsteen, rock ‘n’ roll is serious business, sacred business. <em class="text-italics">“What
 are the things that bring you ecstasy and bliss, what are the things 
that bring on the darkness...what can we do together to combat those 
things?”</em> (Levy 2007:52).<br>
<br>
 His music and performances serve as a conduit for the faithful to that 
larger sense of the divine, the light that counters the darkness, the 
vehicle for some of that ecstasy and bliss we all need in our lives. And
 if the truer measure of religion is found in what it does for its 
believers rather than what it is, then fans really are closer to being a
 congregation than a mere audience (Mazur &amp; McCarthy 2001:5). For 
those without close religious affiliations, this connection with 
Springsteen and fellow fans presents a way out of isolation and 
alienation and a way into relationship, a refuge and solace from 
everyday life every bit as legitimate and meaningful as any religious 
institution. What Bruce has in common with all of the great religious 
leaders throughout time is his way of speaking. Ultimately, when talking
 about spiritual leaders, we are talking about story-tellers. Buddha, 
Jesus, Mohammed – their stories captured the people, drew them in and 
left them open to the higher truths of existence and faith. And if there
 is one thing that Bruce Springsteen is, it is a storyteller of the 
people. As Sarfraz Manzoor, a Muslim and devoted Springsteen disciple 
says, Springsteen fans are “<em class="text-italics">defined not by geography, race, or religion, but by passion</em>” (2007:103). <br>
<br>
Bossfan950 sums it up:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">In our world of Bruce we get to forget our 
problems for 2 and a half hours or so. We hide on the backstreets and as
 dogs on Main Street howl, we howl and dance and sing and hug and love 
and live and die in the company of our blood brothers and sisters.</em><br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you Bruce and thank you my blood brothers and sisters for being 
with me on this part of the ride. We may all agree to disagree. We have 
our fights. But in the end we all share the music, a bond that we may 
bend but we cannot and will not break.<br>
<br>
“<em class="text-italics">Tonight my baby and me we’re gonna ride to the sea,<br>
and wash these sins off our hands.”</em><br>

<strong class="text-strong">MAKING AN IMPRESSION IN CHICAGO<br>
Chicago Tribune (1/26/73)</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen’s first performances in Chicago came during a five 
night stand at the Quiet Knight, where he and the E Street Band opened 
for The Persuasions (a cappella, from Bedford-Stuyvesant).  Here’s the 
review from opening night Jan. 24, 1973.<br>
<br>
“Bruce Springsteen is the engrossing opening act, coming to us direct 
from Asbury Park, N.J.  Singer-songwriter Springsteen has borrowed some 
of his characters from neighborhoods bordering Dylan’s “Desolation Row” 
and some of his vocal approach from Van Morrison, though he has also 
lent his own original stamp to both his songs and style.  At first, he 
accompanied himself on guitar, sharing the stage with an  accordion 
player.  Later he brought up the rest of the band, a rhythm-and-blues 
based group that includes at one time or another drums, piano, sax, 
electric guitar, flute and tuba.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">HE VIOLATES EVERY RULE!<br>
Los Angeles Times (3/3/73)</strong><br>
<br>
The first review of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band in the Los 
Angeles Times was from Santa Monica where the band opened for Blood, 
Sweat and Tears.  It read:  “The opening performer, rock singer Bruce 
Springsteen, was entertaining despite the fact that he violated nearly 
every rule of good singing. Springsteen, who played piano and guitar, 
and was  accompanied by a capable quartet, charmed his audience with his
 merry, clownish manners and his wacky songs.  The high point of his set
 was a comically tuneless rendition of the Beach Boys’ classic, “Fun, 
Fun, Fun”.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">GREAT HEADLINES<br>
The Diamondback (University of Maryland – 5/7/73)<br>
The Globe and Mail (Toronto – 8/28/85)<br>
NRC Handelsblad (The Netherlands – 5/29/09)</strong><br>
<br>
Headline writers are a repetitive lot.  Consider, for example, the 
hundreds  upon hundreds of Springsteen articles headlined “The Boss Is 
Back”.  Yet every once in a while, a headline full of “wow” makes it 
into print.  Here are three:<br>
<br>
(1) The best known of Springsteen’s 19 early shows in the Washington 
D.C.  area was also the first — on April 28, 1973 at the University of 
Maryland in  College Park.  Oft-told is how the E Street Band opened for
 a crowd of approximately 6,000 waiting to hear Jerry Lee Lewis and 
Chuck Berry, and how because Berry traveled solo, Bruce and the boys 
served as Berry’s backup band, without the benefit of rehearsals or 
sound check.  The concert resulted in one of the greatest newspaper 
headlines in Springsteen history, published in the student newspaper, 
The Diamondback:  “Berry Lee Lewisteen.”<br>
<br>
(2) When the Born in the U.S.A. tour arrived in Toronto, reporter Liam 
Lacey  wrote:   “There’s a good reason why people write theological 
papers on Bruce Springsteen, why politicians praise him, and why a whole
 stadium full of people walking away from his marathon shows feel better
 than if they had been working out and living right for a year.  Monday 
night’s first of two shows at the Canadian National Exhibition Stadium 
was another confirmation that he simply delivers a more joyful, more 
intense, longer and more varied performance, tells better stories and 
acts better than anyone you’ve ever seen in one evening.”  The headline,
 to match, read: “Bruce Makes Fans Happy To Be Alive.”<br>
<br>
(3)  The Dutch broad-sheet daily NRC Handelsblad used the following 
poetic  metaphor to headline its pre-Pinkpop analysis of Bruce 
Springsteen’s relevance  in times of crisis: “Regen in de wasstraat” 
which translates into the lyrical “Rain at the Carwash.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
FIRST IMPRESSION IN BINGHAMTON<br>
Sun-Bulletin (Binghamton, NY – 6/14/73)</strong><br>
<br>
The brief summer tour of 1973 when the E Street Band opened for Chicago 
was far from the band’s happiest (advertisements for some venues didn’t 
even list Springsteen’s appearance).  Audiences were clearly there for 
Chicago, and that included reporter Bob Dalke, who wrote this about the 
seven-song E Street opener in Binghamton, NY:<br>
<br>
“The five-member band had a strong, but uninspired, guitar section and a
 sax player who could occasionally honk his horn.  The audience seemed 
to like the group, although it was obvious who they were there to hear.”<br>
<br>
The Evening Press of Binghamton was slightly kinder.  Reporter Dave 
Bourdon  wrote that the band “thumped through a 45-minute set which, 
although  musically cluttered and distorted at times, was long on 
enthusiasm and set the  tone for the night.”<br>

STUDENT REVIEWS</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">NIAGARA UNIVERSITY, LEWINGTON, NY.  (3/24/73</strong>)
 – “It was near midnight on the 24th of March, a small caravan of people
 looking stunned, dazed, and  gasping for breath, proceeded out of NU’s 
Student Center.  They were put into that condition by the likes of Bruce
 Springsteen, who, three hours before, engulfed the stage and at the 
same time sent a tingling sensation through one’s spine as a warning 
that a  storm was a brewin’.”  (Carl Ehmann.)<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">CLARK UNIVERSITY, WORCESTER, MA.  (10/6/74)</strong>
 – “‘Controlled energy’ –  that’s how I would describe Bruce 
Springsteen’s performance.  On stage, silhouetted dramatically by green 
light, the slight man became a magician, deftly manipulating his band, 
his body, us, his audience.  When he jerked his hips to the left and to 
the right, a double-barreled drum rolls and flashes of purple and red 
light occurred simultaneously, radiating to us in a wave of total 
sensuality; when his voice dropped to a husky, caressing whisper, we 
held our collective breath and rose with him to the crescendo on 
Clarence Clemons’ ethereal sax.”  (Ruth Polsky.)<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">SETON HALL UNIVERSITY, SOUTH ORANGE, NJ. (12/11/75) </strong>–
 “Atomic energy.  The only way one could justly describe Bruce 
Springsteen’s timeless performance.  The man was fascinating, 
mushrooming with energy right through his fourth encore –  amazing … 
They loved him.  His fatigues, leather jacket, T-shirt and goppoline, 
modeled like no one else could.  The kicked-out, beat up, punk against 
society was there in all his glamour.”  (Steve Marcopoto.)<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">RUTGERS UNIVERSITY, NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ.  (10/12/76)</strong>
 – “Bruce and the E Streeters were at their Jersey best.  Opening the 
two and a half hour performance with “Night”, off the Born to Run album,
 they performed with such cohesion, and such confidence, that any ‘hype’
 critics would be silenced immediately.  Yes,  there is truth to the 
rumor ‘you can’t really appreciate Bruce until you see  him live.’  The 
band debuted tunes from their forthcoming albums, while throwing in some
 old rock ‘n’ roll standards just to boot. While such favorites like 
“Rendezvous” and “Something in the Night”, both on the new album, were 
tremendously received.”  (John Wooding.)<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">ST. VINCENT COLLEGE, LATROBE, PA. (3/11/77) </strong>–
 “Asbury Park wasn’t in New  Jersey last Friday night.  Instead, Bruce 
Springsteen and his band brought it to Kennedy Gymnasium and WOWed a 
sellout crowd of over 3,000 people…Springsteen’s band deserved much of 
the credit for the show’s success, as did the four-horn backup.  
However, Clarence Clemons deserves special notice as he almost stole the
 show with some great tenor sax solos and a stage presence that rivaled 
that of Springsteen.”   (Bernie Coppolino.)<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, PRINCETON, NJ.  (11/1/78) </strong>– “As much as 
can be said about the other members of the band, the secret to the 
success of Springsteen’s shows lies in the man himself.  The intensity 
he displays on stage is compelling; he sings as if he were living every 
word, and the feeling is infectious.  Projecting complete sincerity, he 
delivers his vocals with the assurance of one who knows that he has 
something important to say, someone who has ‘been there and back.’  
Thus, when he moans in seeming anguish at the end of “Backstreets,” each
 member of the audience can feel the sympathetic pain.  Or when he 
raises his fist in defiance during the chorus of “Promised Land,” 
hundreds in the crowd raise their fists, too, not in imitation but in 
agreement””  (Jon Healey.)<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">CRAZY ON THE TRAIN<br>
The Houston Post (3/9/74)</strong><br>
<br>
After a 31-hour train trip into Texas, Bruce Springsteen told 
interviewer Bob Claypool about being a captive audience to a religious 
fanatic.  “There’s always one crazy lady  on every train, right?” 
Springsteen said.  “We had one who was ruining everyone’s trip. She 
thought my drummer was Jesus, and all kinds of stuff.  She asked me 
where I’m from, and I tell her – Asbury Park, New Jersey.  She says, 
‘That’s just where I’m going.’  Later, she asks what I do, and I tell 
her ‘I play.’  But she thought I said ‘I pray,’ so she’s yelling at me, 
‘WHAT’S THE PRAYER?, WHAT’S THE PRAYER?’  It was wild.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">HEY BRUCE, LIKE SOME SPAGHETTI OR SOMETHING?<br>
The Grinnell Magazine (Grinnel, IA – Fall 2005)</strong><br>
<br>
Thirty years after the E Street Band performed at Grinnell College in 
Iowa, the College published a richly detailed article entitled “The East
 Street Shuffle, 30 Years After the ‘Springsteen Invasion.’”  Tucked 
into the fascinating recollections of Sept. 20, 1975 was the story of 
how a Grinnell student, Gordon Edelstein, wondered what Springsteen 
intended to do for dinner, so he called the band’s motel, asked for 
Bruce, and someone picks up the phone.<br>
<br>
The voice on the phone said:   “Hold on a second.  Bruce, it’s for you.”
   Edelstein thought:  “Ohmygodohmygodohmygod.”  Seconds later, a 
muttered voice  said:  “Hello.”  Edelstein said:  “Hi my name is Gordon 
Edelstein and I go  to Grinnell College where you are playing tonight 
and we really really love your music, I mean we are so into your music 
and I wonder if you want to come  over for dinner before the concert or 
something like for some spaghetti or  something.”  And Springsteen said:
 “That’s really nice of you.  Hold on a second …  Hey, any of you guys 
wanna get some spaghetti at some kid’s house before the  sound check?”  
After a moment, Springsteen again on the phone: “Sorry man, that’s 
really nice of you, but we’ve got the sound check and then it’s like 
gonna be too late, but  thanks.”  To which Edelstein said:  “That’s OK. 
 Hey, just thought I would ask.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">ATTENTION CLASS!<br>
Asbury Park Press (10/26/75)</strong><br>
<br>
William Starsinic, who was Bruce Springsteen’s music teacher at Freehold
 Regional High School, told the Asbury Park Press that Springsteen was 
very solitary and not especially interested in his music class.  “He 
always carried his guitar  around in the halls, and every once in a 
while he’d sit down in the corner and  play for hours,” Starsinic said. 
“I don’t think too many people knew him well.  I don’t remember him 
having a lot of friends.”<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, after listening to Springsteen’s albums, Starsinic said 
that in his professional opinion, “he’s an exceptional talent.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">FILLING IN SOME BLANKS<br>
The Red Bank Daily Register (New Jersey – 11/21/75)</strong><br>
<br>
In “Old haunts still lure rock star Springsteen,” reporter Linda Ellis wrote that:<br>
<br>
(1)  Springsteen took Christian Confraternity Doctrine classes while at 
St. Rose of Lima School in Freehold.  These after-school classes were 
intended to prepare children for Confession, Holy Communion, and 
Confirmation.<br>
<br>
(2) Carl “Tinker” West, who managed Steel Mill into the 1970s, taught 
Springsteen how to drive on the band’s cross-country trip to California 
in January 1970.<br>
<br>
(3) Ann Campbell, vice chairman of the New Jersey Democratic Party, was 
quoted as saying Springsteen played gratis at George McGovern for 
President  fundraisers in 1968.<br>
<br>
(4) Springsteen was said to have baby-sat for Danny Federici’s newborn 
son in the early ‘70s, sitting by the crib and playing his guitar.<br>

“Nashville came face to face with the future of rock ‘n’ roll yesterday –
 and only one person, a record store employee, recognized him,” reported
 Eve Zibart for The Tennessean. “Springsteen had already had a rough 
day: coming in yesterday morning from Chattanooga, the band traveled 
some 50 miles before realizing that the drummer (Ernest “Boom” Carter) 
had been left behind.”<br>

<strong class="text-strong">THE SELDOM MENTIONED AWARD<br>
Rock Music Awards program (9/15/77)</strong><br>
<br>
On Sept. 15, 1977, the legendary recording and television producer Don 
Kirshner staged his third annual Rock Music Awards at the Hollywood 
Palladium.  The show, broadcast nationally on NBC, featured awards in 15
 categories  as voted by rock writers, critics and disc jockeys. Bruce 
Springsteen was nominated for  best song composer.  The other nominees 
were Stevie Wonder for “I Wish” and “Sir Duke,” Rod Stewart for 
“Tonight’s the Night,” and the Felder-Henley-Fred song writing  trio for
 the Eagles’ “Hotel California.”  All four compositions were penned in 
1976.  Strangely enough, Bruce was nominated for “Blinded By The Light,”
 written in 1972 and recorded in 1973. In the awards ceremony program, 
there is no explanation for why a 1972 composition won in 1977 against 
four 1976 songs, but it may have had something to do with Manfred Mann’s
 Earth Band’s cover of “Blinded” which was released in 1977.<br>
<br>
Springsteen also received a nomination for best male vocalist along with
 Daryl Hall, John Oates, Boz Scaggs, Rod Stewart and the eventual 
winner, Stevie Wonder.<br>

<br>
On the evening of Aug. 6, 1981, Springsteen stunned the crowd in 
Washington D.C. by joining Robbie Thompson, his old pal from Steel Mill,
 on stage at The Bayou, a small club in Georgetown.  Before the show, 
Springsteen ate at Joe and Mo’s, a trendy DC restaurant.   Recalling the
 evening a month later, The Washington Post noted that prices at the 
restaurant were “more expensive than most restaurants in Springsteen’s 
New Jersey,” and when asked by the owners to autograph an album cover, 
Bruce wrote: “I thought it was a diner.”<br>

Zig Zag  (6/1/81)<br>
Melody Maker (4/17/93)<br>
Melody Maker (4/22/95)</strong><br>
<br>
The Brits don’t mess around.  Not one bit.  If they like you, they say 
so.  If  they have a problem with your work, look out. Here are three 
examples on both sides of the coin.<br>
<br>
(1) Many journalists have tried to put the excitement of a live 
Springsteen  show into proper context.  In Zig Zag, following the June 
1, 1981 show at Wembley Arena, Kris Needs summed it up like this: “Only a
 person with a heart of   sun-dried bison excrement could fail to have 
been moved by The Bruce  Springsteen Extravaganza.”<br>
<br>
(2)  Melody Maker reviewer David Bennun wasn’t especially fond of the  
“Lucky Town” (live) single.  Here is his entire review: 
“AH-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ur-hur-ha-ha (snurf)! Hee-hee-hee!  Heh! Heh. 
Snurk. Heh. Snark. Snore.”<br>
<br>
(3) Compared to Bennun, Melody Maker reviewer Everett True was 
positively  wordy in his review of the “Secret Garden” single, which he 
liked  (maybe).  Again, this is the entire review:  “It’s not a “Born In
 The  U.S.A.” Thank God.  It’s not a “Pink Cadillac,” either.  Thank 
God.  And it’s most assuredly not a “Hungry Heart.” Thank God.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">HE PLAYED WHERE?<br>
Intelligencer Journal (Lancaster, PA – 6/23/84)</strong><br>
<br>
One of Springsteen’s most unexpected performances took place June 21, 
1984 at The Village, a small club in Lancaster, PA., in the heart of 
Pennsylvania Dutch country.  Down through time, the show has been 
portrayed as the E Street Band’s last tune-up before the start of the 
BITUSA tour, but that begs the question – why Lancaster?<br>
<br>
As reporter Jon Ferguson told it, the E Street Band drove to Lancaster 
from tour rehearsals in Lititz, PA., and took in a set by the Sharks, 
the only band scheduled to play that night.  Around midnight, the Sharks
 “cut their last set short and curtly announced that the next person on 
the stage would be Springsteen … and when Springsteen and his band raced
 onto the stage a few minutes later, picked up the Sharks’ instruments 
and ripped into a roaring version of “Out in the Street,” the Village 
exploded… His fans exultantly screamed his name, clapped until hands 
were raw, sang along when Springsteen dipped the microphone into the 
crowd and punched their fists in the air in celebration.  People stared 
in disbelief and threw their arms around each other as they watched this
 rock ‘n’ roll fantasy unfold.”  For the crowd of 200 at The Village, 
Ferguson wrote, “nothing can compare to what happened early Friday  
morning.  You had to keep pinching yourself to make sure it was real.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">THE $16 RIP-OFF<br>
The Ring (12/84)</strong><br>
<br>
In 1984, Randy Gordon edited The Ring, a monthly magazine self-described
 as “The Bible of Boxing.”   Gordon was among the uninitiated when it 
came to Springsteen, having never been to a show until one of his 
friends told him that in concert, Springsteen “is a dynamo.  He’s 
probably in better shape than most of  the coke-head athletes in the 
world today.”<br>
<br>
So Gordon packed up the car, drove 120 miles and took in the Sept. 7, 
1984 Born in The U.S.A. show in Hartford, CT., the 31-song show that 
included “Rave On” in honor of Buddy Holly’s birthday.  “The $16 I paid 
for a ticket was a ripoff,” wrote Gordon afterwards. “Only, it was the 
promoter who got ripped off.  Charging me only $16 for the most 
incredible concert I’ve ever seen was like handing me the ticket for 
free … I saw a physical and mental performance which far surpassed 
anything I’ve seen in years …Springsteen is a champion.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">SUSPENDING THE RULES<br>
The Greensboro News &amp; Record (North Carolina – 1/19/85)</strong><br>
<br>
When a private club in downtown Greensboro booked a hot musical group 
called the Del Fuegos, it expected to draw a crowd.  It didn’t expect 
what happened next.<br>
<br>
As told by The Greensboro News &amp; Record, Bruce Springsteen showed up
 at The Rhinoceros club with Nils Lofgren, surprising about 100 patrons.
  He drank  beer, shot pool and performed “Hang on Sloopy” and “Stand by
 Me.”<br>
<br>
“The place was the craziest I’ve ever seen,” said Pete Clary, Greensboro
 lawyer and Thursday night bouncer at the club.  “People were hanging 
from the rafters.  The owner doesn’t usually allow that, but I looked 
around and saw the owner standing on the bar, so I guess the rules were 
suspended for a while.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Japan Times (Japan – 4/85)</strong><br>
<br>
On April 10, 1985, the E Street Band opened their first tour of Japan 
with a 27-song set at Tokyo’s Yoyogi Olympic Pool.  It was a 
breathtaking experience  for the Japanese, and especially for one 
reviewer who penned this review:<br>
<br>
“Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band rocked the hyperboloidal 
rafters off the Yoyogi Olympic Pool all Wednesday night long in the 
opening show of their first Japan tour to an absolutely 
hyped-to-the-hilt house rocking on their feet through two 
electromagnetic sets and two hell-rocking encores with the thousands 
shouting along the lyrics with the New Jersey band from the opening 
zazen-vaporing “Born in The USA” to a raw-rocking “Twist and Shout” 
finale in four-part audience harmony, as the  Brucer boogied and stomped
 across the stage and up the piano, slinked in step  with the rest of 
the octet, warned us of time’s winged chariot while pointing  out how 
Big Man Clarence Clemens (sic)  has ‘maintained his youthful beauty,’  
dedicated “My Home Town” (sic) to a madding Tokyo crowd in Japanese – 
they went  crackers over that one – and seduced a woman from the 
frenetic multitudes to  rock with him on stage only to carry her off 
after she fainted, crescendoing  the bonzo Tokyoites from one climax of 
pure rock energy to the next and the  next and the next, this preacher 
of rock ‘n’ roll spinning yarn and singing his hungry heart out about 
tough times, feeling good, cars and girls and cars and  girls, this cool
 rockin’ daddy from the USA.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">UNKNOWN FACT #15<br>
The Sun (UK – 5/30/85)</strong><br>
<br>
If you’re hooked on little known factoids, here’s one for the ages.  In 
 its rundown of  “20 Things You Didn’t Know About The Boss,”  The Sun 
put this at Number 15: “Bruce used to be a member of a wild teenage  
gang called The Greasers who spent all their time fighting a rival gang 
called  The Surfers.”  The Sun quoted Springsteen allegedly explaining: 
“We were all no-hopers.”<br>
<br>
Here’s another one, this from The San Diego Union of July 2, 1978.  It  
identified the name of Springsteen’s fourth album as “Stranger on the 
Edge  of Town.”<br>
<br>
And another: reviewing the 10 biggest shows ever on their campus, the 
Penn State University Alumni Association website (imakenews.com 2/24/09)
 credited Bruce with three major hit albums: Born in the U.S.A., The 
River, and The Nylon Curtain.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">IN THE PHILADELPHIA OF YORE<br>
Welcomat (Philadelphia – 2/25/87)</strong><br>
<br>
In the early 1980s, Philadelphia writer and editor Dan Rottenberg took 
over a neighborhood weekly called Welcomat and transformed it into 
something unique — a paper that published nothing but opinion pieces.  
Anybody could write for the Welcomat, on any subject.  If Rottenberg 
liked it, he’d buy it and the essay would reach 85,000 well educated, 
affluent Philadelphia readers.<br>
<br>
On Feb. 25, 1987, Welcomat published side-by-side Springsteen articles 
that were, in essence, a debate between freelance writers Dan DeLuca and
 Len Lear. (DeLuca went on to become the music critic for the 
Philadelphia Inquirer, where he wrote frequently about Springsteen, 
while Lear’s later writings focused on food and Philadelphia area 
restaurants.)<br>
<br>
DeLuca wrote how “Springsteen’s (political) vision has slowly but 
steadily grown.  The newer songs are richer in the small details of 
everyday life, more nuanced in their characterizations and more directed
 in their anger.”  In his cover of Edwin Starr’s “War” for example, 
“Springsteen names no names, and he does not try to make decisions when 
he talks of ‘blind faith in your leaders’ while the MTV screen mixes 
images of carnage in Vietnam with clips of the Contras training in 
Central America.”  As the song ends, DeLuca wrote, “the camera reveals a
 kitchen scene in which a draft-age boy had earlier been sitting 
watching television news footage with his father.  Now the chair is 
empty, only the father remains.  Some kids will watch and think to 
themselves, ‘Hey, that could happen to me.’ And that’s good for 
something.”<br>
<br>
Lear’s slam piece claimed that “piety has begun to collect around 
Springsteen’s curly head like fog around a valley of tears … the mist 
has gotten so dense that a realistic view of Springsteen has been all 
but obliterated.” Springsteen, said Lear, “‘sings’ like a man yelling in
 a drunken stupor for the New York Giants to score a touchdown.  There 
is no redeeming plaintiveness or charm or harmonic elegance or angst or 
subtlety.”  As for lyrics, Lear variously described them as 
“unintelligible” and “indecipherable,” best left “to those with an ample
 supply of earplugs and aspirin.”<br>

<strong class="text-strong">UNDER GOLDEN ARCHES<br>
Prince Williams Journal (Virginia – 2/22/89)</strong><br>
<br>
It’s Friday night, you’re sitting at your neighborhood McDonald’s, and 
who’s the last person you expect to run into?  You guessed it, and if 
you’re Michele McCarry, 5, Matthew Pisciotta, 10, and their mothers, you
 can be forgiven for making a commotion.<br>
<br>
According to the Prince Williams Journal, Bruce Springsteen pulled into a
 Manassas, VA., McDonalds in a metallic blue Corvette, spent some time 
in the parking lot talking to a group of teenagers, and signed 
autographs on napkins for Michele, Matthew and their moms while Patti 
Scialfa was in line for food.<br>
<br>
Greg Devine, McDonald’s hamburger flipper, said the women made quite a 
commotion and when he went to investigate, he saw Bruce getting into his
 car.  “He gave the thumbs-up sign.  After that, we were going nuts.”<br>

<strong class="text-strong">A BIG CONTRAST TO TEENYBOPPER SHOWS<br>
Hartford Courant (Connecticut – 5/9/00)</strong><br>
<br>
Just what do teenagers who dominate the music audience today think about Bruce Springsteen’s stage show?<br>
<br>
To gauge the reaction of at least one local teen, editors of the 
Hartford Courant sent Glastonbury High School senior Laura Passero, 
whose taste usually ran more to the teen pop groups, to review the May 
7, 2000 show at the Hartford Civic Center.  Afterwards, she wrote: “He 
doesn’t need fancy choreography like ‘N Sync or Britney Spears, nor does
 he need to lift his shirt to obtain screams like LFO. All Bruce 
Springsteen needs to enliven the crowd is to appear on stage…When things
 started to get hot and sweaty, he didn’t retreat to the side to get a 
towel, he continued to perform for the anxious crowd. This is one of the
 few concerts where the music is the most appreciated thing on stage… At
 50, he also proved he has more energy than the teen groups half his 
age, especially when he jumped from the top of the piano and landed  
without falling.  The audience for the concert was a big contrast to 
teenybopper shows. This concert was for the parents, young and old, 
dragging their reluctant children out for a night of classic fun.”<br>
<br>
That said, however, Passero also noted that “for most of the teens who 
attended, the main points of interest were two members of the E Street 
Band: drummer Max Weinberg, whose side job is music director for ‘Late 
Night With Conan O’Brien,’ and Steve Van Zandt, who has a recurring role
 on the hit HBO show The Sopranos.”</div>

<br>
 Anna Bayo Ibars <br>
Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona<br>
<br>
 September 2011</strong><br>
<br>
The lyrics on The Ghost of Tom Joad  will be analysed by taking into 
account the epic narrative told through the narrator or other 
characters. Parallelisms between Springsteen‘s album and Steinbeck‘s The
 Grapes of Wrath will be established in reference to content. 
Springsteen‘s opinion and other meanings underlying the text will also 
be commented on.<br>
<br>
Springsteen‘s album begins with the lyric of ―The Ghost of Tom Joad‖ 
giving name to the album which stands for an adapted version of 
Steinbeck‘s Grapes into a folk song. The lyrics of the album allow the 
reader to tour through unseen America border towns and stop in places 
where different characters migrate in search of a job, a home, or where 
fate brings them.<br>
<br>
―The Ghost of Tom Joad‖	acts as an opening scene and also as a closing 
one which offers an accurate cinematic adaptation of Steinbeck‘s novel. 
The verses of the chorus will be used to divide this part of the 
dissertation in three sections, each of them introducing different 
lyrics while connecting them to The Grapes through their subjects. Under
 the three main headlines we will be searching, waiting and finally 
finding ―The Ghost of Tom Joad‖.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
. “SEARCHING FOR THE GHOST”</strong><br>
<br>
Men walkin‘  ̳long the railroad tracks Goin‘ someplace there‘s no goin‘ 
back Highway patrol choppers comin‘ up over the ridge Hot soup on a 
campfire under the bridge Springsteen‘s version of ―The Ghost of Tom 
Joad‖ begins with a harsh portrayal where thousands of men are walking 
along a railroad, heading for a place they do not know if they are going
 to come back. They represent these thousands of displaced<br>
<br>
“Searching for the Ghost of Tom Joad”:<br>
<br>
 Resurrecting Steinbeck’s Gaze people in the world today who are living 
in shelters, eating in campfires, experiencing the humiliation of having
 been forced to get away from their countries for any political, 
religious or economical reason. The lyrics tell about the details, 
routines and daily activities of these homeless, placeless among a total
 misery and in this case, Springsteen is telling about Mexican migrants 
trying to cross the American border. Just some authorities like highway 
patrols appear, but we do not know if they are going to help them.<br>
<br>
As it happens in the story of ―The Line‖, Carl, an ex-military man from 
Fort Irwin, whose wife died, takes a job as a Californian Border Patrol 
(San Diego) to prevent Mexican from crossing a passage to Southern 
California cities. He becomes friend with Bobby Ramirez, a Mexican 
immigrant who always says:<br>
They risk death in the deserts and mountains pay all they got to the 
smugglers rings We send‘em home and they come night back again, Carl, 
hunger is a powerful thing‖.<br>
<br>
Bobby Ramirez is conscious that the desperate jumpers risk their lives 
many times in search of food or a job, paying all the money they have to
 smugglers while relying on them to survive. The only purpose is not 
dying of hunger. Later in the story, Carl, the narrator, reaffirms he is
 doing what he is told to do as a patrolman, which consists in waiting 
at night, hidden in the canyon, trying to chase drugs runners, farmers 
with families, women and children with the objective of keeping them 
from crossing the line.<br>
<br>
We do not know what Carl really thinks of his job and about the migrants
 until the day he meets an attractive Mexican woman to whom he feels a 
mixture of attraction, empathy, and understanding toward her and her 
situation. At a given moment, Carl neglects his duties trying to help 
her and she escapes through the arroyo. But on the highway, Bobby‘s jeep
 comes out and then it is when Carl says:<br>
<em class="text-italics"><br>
I felt myself movin‘ Felt my gun restin‘  ̳neath my hand We stood there starin‘ at each other As off through the arroyo she ran‖</em>.<br>
<br>
Bobby Ramirez never said anything although he could have prevented the 
woman from escaping, in fact, it was his job and responsibility as 
authority, but Carl also himself stopped from doing anything wrong to 
Ramirez as both understood the situation. Bobby because of his condition
 of being a Mexican immigrant himself, and Carl as his conscience was 
fighting between doing what he had been told to do and what he was 
feeling for the woman. At the end of the story, Carl, decides to leave 
the job and track down the woman in Tijuana‘s area (Mexican state of 
Baja California).<br>
A single connection with the woman changed Carl‘s sense of existence and
 his vision of a future life. His job did not fulfil him; he could not 
be in peace with himself just giving orders to those people who were 
tempting to cross the border into a land that long time ago belonged to 
Mexico16 as Springsteen himself states in his The Ghost of Tom Joad ‘s	
tour.<br>
<br>
Carl‘s character grows spiritually responding with physical assistance 
to the others when he realises what is happening. ―The Line‖ divides 
physically Mexico from the States and also divides people with the same 
needs but with different skin or social background.<br>
According to The Grapes, Steinbeck would also remember: ―Once California
 belonged to Mexico, and its land to Mexicans; and a horde of tattered 
feverish Americans poured in. And such was their hunger for land that 
they took the land... and they guarded with guns the land they had 
stolen‖ .<br>
And then: ―the dispossessed were drawn west -from Kansas, Oklahoma, 
Texas, New Mexico; from Nevada and Arkansas, tribes, dusted out, 
tractored out. Carloads, caravans, homeless and hungry...‖ , all of them
 following the well-known ― highway 66‖ as the main migrant road trying 
to escape from the degrading homeless, jobless conditions. Obviously, 
patrols, deputies and other people representing some kind of authority 
were completely inaccessible most of the times acting as if they were 
the owners of the land insulting and degrading the migrants. One example
 is the case of the deputy near Tulare (California): ―We ain‘t gonna 
have no goddamn Okies in this town‖ ; or the service-station boy that 
the Joads met on the road with in his white uniform commenting to a 
friend: ―...They ain‘t human. A human being wouldn‘t live<br>
<br>
Between 1846-48 the Mexican government had to give half of its territory to the USA (Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo)<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">“STILL SEARCHING FOR THE GHOST”</strong><br>

like they do. A human being couldn‘t stand it to be so dirty and 
miserable. They ain‘t a hell of a lot better than gorillas‖(221).<br>
Other deputy sheriffs used ―shotguns patrolling the lines so a man might
 not pick an orange for a thin child, oranges to be dumped if the price 
was low‖ (234) or even shouted to them: ―This ain‘t your land. You‘re 
trespassing ...You goddamned squatters.	Pretty soon you‘d think you 
owned it‖ (235), as if the land belonged to them.<br>
<br>
As David Masciotra would say in The Progressive Political Vision of 
Bruce Springsteen:	―As long as homeless and desperately poor are 
invisible to the eye, they are also invisible to the pen used to sign 
local, state, federal budget‖ (78).	This is in fact what happened to 
these Okies that in spite of a New Deal Programme settled by the 
president at the time in order to assist them, the most of the laws were
 not applied caused of the bad use of authority in the hands of the ones
 mentioned before. The only exception being the treatment given at 
Weedpatch camp, in The Grapes.<br>
<br>
Springsteen seems to reflect in his ―Youngstown‖ a story which repeats 
again in spite of the years and in spite of different political problem 
and different administrations since President Roosevelt. Despite his 
efforts, the Depression hung until 1941-42 when American involvement in 
the Second War World resulted in the drafting of young men into military
 service and the creation of million of jobs in the industry of defence 
and war.<br>
<br>
Springsteen, himself, who was born in 1949, lived a childhood and youth 
haunted by a kind of darkness surrounding his town and household. The 
aftermath of the years of the Depression brought a grim picture of decay
 and darkness to many cities, states as is the case of the story of a 
steelworker in Youngtown. The narrator situates the reader on the 
setting of the story which goes back to 1803, when James and Danny 
Heaton found a mine of gold and built the furnaces which later were to 
make ―<br>
<br>
"..<em class="text-italics">.the cannon balls  that helped the Union win the War </em>
 (and which later in WWII built also the tanks and bombs). Although the 
story begins happily, the chorus is repeating constantly that the 
narrator is getting more and more depressed, defeated by some reason: ―<em class="text-italics">I‘m sinkin‘down / Here darlin‘ in Youngstown</em>‖.
 Later, the reader is transported to the 1960s, when the steelworker‘s 
son describes his returning from Vietnam with the purpose of having a 
secure job at the mill thinking that he will be able to feed a family:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Well my daddy worked the furnaces Kept  ̳em 
hotter than hell I come home from  ̳Nam worked my way to scarfer A job 
that‘d suit the devil as well Taconite, coke and limestone Fed my 
children and made my pay Then smokestacks reachin‘ like the arms of god 
Into a beautiful sky of soot and clay.</em><br>
<br>
The comparison of smokestacks to the arms of god provides a sense of 
importance to the steel industry in Youngstown. These arms seem to be so
 powerful, so strong that they provide jobs, opportunities to people. 
This industry helps them to live decent lives. Later, the narrator still
 remembers his father coming to Ohio after coming back from WWII saying 
that the evilest men in the world had not destroyed the city but the 
wealthy and powerful American corporations did: ―<em class="text-italics">Them big boys did what Hitler couldn‘t do.</em>‖
 And once again, the chorus is repeating ―I‘m sinkin‘ down‖ beating 
strongly telling why he is feeling so depressed as another victim of 
economic exploitation.<br>
<br>
Curiously, the story is repeating again in many American homes and 
cities, from Monongaleh Valley to the Mesabi iron range to the coal 
mines of Appalacchia. With the words: ― Once I made you rich enough / 
rich enough to forget my name‖, the narrator feels finally hopeless in 
front the situation, and in spite of his effort, his dedication to his 
work during long years, he can not expect any recognition from the 
owners. He feels betrayed, turned into a useless object where neither 
moral nor economical compensation is going to be offered to him.<br>
The only thing he can do is to preach to find a small place where to 
stay after death, he is so deceived in front so much hostility that 
maybe he would not find peace in Heaven but in Hell, near the furnaces 
where he has spent his life earning his living and doing his work so 
proudly. This is not just a tale about workers, bad labour conditions 
but it gives a clear image of the power of material things in front of 
human feelings where economical profit is more important than desperate 
human souls. The narrator does not find spiritual peace in any religious
 faith or prayer, but instead he invokes the devil.<br>
<br>
With this dark portrayal of Youngstown, Springsteen is invoking 
Steinbeck‘s Okies spirits experiencing a similar situation in Oklahoma 
about 50 years before. Actually, the Great Depression began with the 
Crash of the Stock Market (1929) and at the height of the Depression 
(1933), incomes fell down, farm prices too, men went hungry and families
 were obliged to migrate to California. They were offered jobs as Tom 
Joad said to Timothy at Weedpatch camp: ―You know,  ̳fore we lef‘home, 
we heard they was plenty work out here. Seen han‘bills askin‘folks to 
come out‖ (Grapes: 293) which was not true so that the owners had been 
spreading more handbills than workers needed.<br>
<br>
Gangs of youth rode the rails in box cars like so many hobos hoping to 
find a job, travelling from one place to another for free via fright 
trains trying luck somewhere being mostly ―farmhands‖. At the same time 
as Okies, hobos left the Great Plains heading for California in search 
of farms, fields where to work, the sector industry was also badly 
shaken, factories closed, and mills and mines were abandoned in other 
parts of the country. After president Hoover, Roosevelt was elected in 
1932 and with him a New Deal Programme was established. New laws created
 with the aim of improving the welfare of many citizens were not applied
 as is the case of the Hooverville‘s, where meanwhile government was 
trying to feed and give medical assistance to the needed, banks and huge
 growers were sabotaging them.	Weedpatch camp was one of those 
exceptional camps designed to help and relieve migrants where they could
 have sanitary units, where families never missed a meal and where 
everybody could work and enjoy with some balls and new clothes.	There 
were no cops and the people living there could run themselves the camp 
and even organize some committees in order to share responsibilities and
 other community tasks, as the watchman, Mr Thomas told Tom: ―No cops. 
We got our own cops. Folks here elect their cops.‖(Grapes: 286).<br>
<br>
Million of migrants had been dispossessed of their ―homesteads‖ after 
many years of working the land as their ancestors, old pioneers and even
 Indian tribes. But it was the bad treatment of the land ecologically 
and economically speaking that had caused the well-known Dust Bowls 
Storms which so accurately had been depicted by Steinbeck at the 
beginning of the Grapes:<br>
<br>
―The air and the sky darkened and through them the sun shone redly, and 
there was a raw sting in the air. During the night the wind raced faster
 over the land, dug cunningly the rootlets of the corn, and the corn 
fought the wind with its weakened leaves until the rots were freed‖ 
(Grapes: 2).<br>
The poor farmers lost everything they owned from the shanties they had 
built to the animals they had including the closest of their relatives 
who were killed or disappeared in the storms. The entire region that 
comprises Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas was totally 
devastated where men could not grow anything, and land could not hold 
the earth and turned into dust which the wind blew away. As Donald 
Worster would state in his Dust Bowl, The Southern Plains in the 1930s 
commenting about who was to blame about the disaster in the sense that 
the storms did not get the blame but the machines of the new era, he 
says: ―It is the hand of culture that selects out innate human qualities
 and thereby gives variety to history. It was culture in the main that 
created the Dust Bowl (94)‖. According to him, the unlimited wealth 
which came with the capitalism was transforming a rural economy leaving 
the homestead tenants without a home to live, without land to grow their
 own food to survive but with anger, humiliation and total uncertainty 
concerning their fate.<br>
<br>
This is the grim and pessimistic vision that Steinbeck tries to give throughout<br>
The Grapes:<br>
<br>
The cars of the migrant people crawled out of the side roads onto the 
great cross- country highway ...in the daylight they scuttled like bugs 
to the westward; and as the dark caught them, they clustered like bugs 
near to shelter and to water... they shared their lives, their food, and
 the things they hoped for in the new country <br>
<br>
When the Joads arrive at Baskerville camp, the shelters described offer a clear image of refugee camps: ―<em class="text-italics">And there was a huge tent, ragged, torn in strips and the tears mended with pieces of wire.</em>..‖
 (. Also the image of hunger, especially when Ma Joad tries to cook 
something for the family and suddenly the smell of the food makes some 
children come close to her: ― I dunno what to do. I can‘t rob the 
fambly. I got to<br>
<br>
<br>
“<strong class="text-strong">WAITIN’ON THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD”</strong><br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">He pulls the prayer book out of his sleeping 
bag Preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag Waitin‘ for when the last
 shall be the first and the first shall be the last In a cardboard box  
̳neath the underpass</em><br>
<br>
<br>
"...feed the fambly...and outside they could hear the children digging 
into the pot with their sticks and their spoons and their pieces of 
rusty tin‖ causing her a restless feeling between her duties as bread 
giver of the family and her wish to help the starving children."<br>
<br>
Springsteen, being both an artist and observer, is also depicting the 
life of the refugees in the 90s ironically inviting the reader to 
welcome	―The New World Order‖ that H.W. Bush administration ̳s promises 
which instead of leading to a series of social improvements, they turned
 into long queues of jobless, Mexican citizens having for only shelter 
their cars in the well-known Southwest highway as the Joads had. He is 
concerned with the frustrating migration movement of his contemporaries 
and also concerned with their inner, spiritual lives. He tries to show 
that in spite of the gap of years since The Grapes, the new government 
has not succeeded in offering to citizens a better world where to live 
decently.<br>
<br>
If the characters in previous stories had been trapped in hopeless 
situations in different places of the States, now, the characters are 
going to go through an awakening process where their past experience, 
knowledge and faith in any religion is going to be questioned since 
there is no explanation to the injustices they have to face.<br>
The narrator of TGOTJ mentions somebody who pulls a prayer book from his
 sleeping bag which reminds the figure of preacher Casy in The Grapes 
while he is thinking and trying to understand what is happening around 
him. His previous faith, his former speeches are not useful anymore, he 
does not know what his duties are as a preacher: ―I got the spirit 
sometimes an‘ nothin‘ to preach about. I got the call to lead the 
people, an ‘no place to lead them‖ (Grapes: 21) or when later, he says: 
―I figgered about the Holy Spirit...maybe it‘ all women we love; maybe 
that‘s the Holy Sperit-the human sperit...Maybe all men got one big soul
 ever‘body‘s a part of‖ (Grapes: 24), words which Tom eventually comes 
to understand by the end of the story. Without pretending, Casy acts as 
Tom‘s spiritual mentor trying to put on words how he feels and what he 
thinks about the injustices suffered by their own folks. He tries to 
work out how can a preacher like him can still be useful to them.<br>
<br>
Later in the novel, when Tom Joad meets under a bridge ―beside a tiny 
stream...a man sat on a box in front of the tent‖ (381) which happens to
 be Casy, Tom begins to understand what Casy is trying to tell him about
 how strikes begin and how cops then come down on them:<br>
<br>
What made  ̳em bad was they needed stuff. An‘ I begin to see, then. It‘s
 need that makes all the trouble...one fella started yellin‘, an‘ 
nothin‘ happened...then another ...and we al got the same tone an‘ I 
tell ya, it jus‘ seemed like that tank bulged an‘give and swelled up. By
 God! Then somepin happened! (382)<br>
With the lyrics of ―Straight Time‖, ―Highway 29‖ and ―Dry Lightning‖, 
Springsteen examines the life of people living on the fringe in these 
Southwest border towns. He tries to express how the characters feel, 
when somebody‘s mind is swinging in that ―thin line‖ ready to make a 
choice which can be decisively in one‘s life.<br>
<br>
In ―<strong class="text-strong">Straight Time,</strong> Springsteen 
tells about the story of an ex-con who works at a rendering plant and 
wants to live a life on the right side of the law. He seems that the 
first thing he does after getting out of prison is to get married with 
the idea of saving his life if he tries to domesticate his wild previous
 life. But as an ex-con, it is difficult to choose among jobs and the 
one he has in the slaughterhouse does not help him much. Working among 
death, blood of animals: ―It ain‘t gonna make me rich‖, is not going to 
give much sense to his life, not even a good reason to wake up every 
morning. He considers other options as the trade proposed by his uncle 
which deals with stolen cars, but once again, he faces again the 
criminal world which he fears: ― I got a cold mind to go tripping across
 hat thin line / I‘m sick of doing straight time‖ as he does not want to
 go back to jail.<br>
<br>
<br>
The ex-con cannot put aside his previous life, the evil temptation of 
the uncle who is going to pay him better than choosing any other job, is
 tempting him in spite of his fear of doing ―straight time‖. However, as
 he says:<br>
<br>
Eight years in, it feels like you‘re gonna die But you get used to anything Sooner or later it becomes your life<br>
So he does not matter too much.	He also faces the possibility of his 
boring married life which he compares to life in jail and he sees no 
real light at the end of the tunnel. His future is dark and the only 
option is to continue his ―straight time‖ inside jail or outside, both 
ways are going to lead him to the grave. Death is there, whether it is a
 crime he is going to commit, or if it is his own death. The smell of it
 is there too.	It symbolizes a life which is not worth living, where 
there is no hope.<br>
We are responsible fo<br>
r our own choices, but if they turned to be irresponsible in the eyes of
 justice, they might grow into nightmares in a society where greed, 
selfish behaviour does not help to improve some tragic choices. In The 
Grapes, Tom had spent four years in McAlester prison for homicide in 
self-defence and when the story begins he has just come out of it after 
getting parole to keep and not being able to leave the estate. When 
being asked about the time spent there, he would answer: ―Course you get
 goddamn good an‘ sick a-doin‘ the same thing day after day ...But when a
 bunch of men take an‘ lock you up four years, it ought to have some 
meaning...That sort of senselessness kind a worries a man‖ (55), which 
means it is difficult to forget an experience like this and also to 
forgive the ones who are to blame of a given crime, especially when 
someone is in jail for a innocent crime.<br>
<br>
In ― <strong class="text-strong">Highway 29</strong>, Springsteen always
 haunted by the ghost of his earlier Nebraska album, presents a 
character who seems to work as a shoe salesman in a store where he meets
 a woman which whom he establishes a short conversation and exchanges 
telephone numbers. He meets her later in a roadhouse and together, they 
rob a bank and flee down Highway 29 heading for Sierra Madre (West 
Mexico and Southern American States) where they finally are going to be 
involved in a car crash:<br>
<br>
We headed into Sierra Madre  ̳cross the borderline The winter sun, shot 
through the black trees I told myself it was all something in her But as
 we drove I knew it was something in me Something had been comin‘for a 
long long time And something that was here with me now On highway 29<br>
While driving, thousand images cross the character‘s mind. Surrounded by
 a dark winter, black trees all the way, he begins to blame her 
companion for his deeds, then he comes to realise that he is the only 
one to blame for his actions and discovers the evil side inside him.<br>
The premonition of what it is going to happen is in the air and the 
highway is there to help him escape from his bad choices, from himself 
and from the law while trying to be free. His inner battle acts as a 
liberating force stronger than his mind. His soul is so broken that he 
can only run, escape from his sins and demons although he fears death:<br>
The wind comes silent through the windshield All I could see was snow 
and sky and pines I closed my eyes and I was runnin‘ I was runnin‘ then I
 was flyin‘.<br>
A similar situation occurs when Tom Joad‘s uncle, John, gets drunk as 
the only way to escape from a sin which does not allow him to feel 
decent, burdening often the family. He is wondering about Casy‘s words: 
―a fella‘s sinned if he thinks he‘s sinned‖ (267) which brings more 
problems to his conscience.<br>
<br>
―<strong class="text-strong">Dry Lightning</strong> is about a recent 
and strong experience which is still in the mind of the narrator while 
he is staring at the horizon where flashes of lightning are crossing the
 desert. Sweet memories of a lover, maybe, come to him in the shape of 
an appaloosa as a rare and attractive breed riding in Western regions of
 America. Under a halo effect of dark skin under the white coat next to 
the spots, the appaloosa appears as strong and powerful figure with 
flashes of ―dry lightning‖ crossing the sky, and the narrator first 
memories of a well-built dancer who enchanted him fill his mind. He also
 recalls some fighting of an unsuccessful relationship with a dancer he 
met in Alvarado Street (Los Angeles) in which passion had been hard, 
violent but also devastating as dry storms in the area can be: ―Is dry 
lightning on the horizon line / Just dry lightning and you on my mind‖.	
Relationships are difficult and memories can be bitter and also<br>
sweet, but they quickly belong to one‘s past although they help us to 
move forward or even prevent us from doing anything. As is the case of 
bad memories, hope is the only help and it can only be found in oneself:
 ―ain‘t nobody gonna give nobody / What they really need anyway‖.<br>
<br>
In The Grapes, when the Joads had to leave their home and all their 
belongings, they were asking themselves: ― How can we live without our 
lives? How will we know it‘s us without our past? No. Leave it. Burn 
it...How if you wake up in the night and know- the willow tree‘s not 
there? Can you live without the willow tree? Well, no, you can‘t. The 
willow tree is you.‖ (Grapes: 89)<br>
<br>
The ―willow tree‖ as a symbol of a whole life plenty of good and bad 
memories together with the bitterness of losing everything was provoking
 a dreadful pain to the family, which made them load the car quickly and
 drove away as anybody else would help them.<br>
<br>
In ―<strong class="text-strong">My Best was Never Good Enough</strong>, 
the character seems to apologize for his lack of ability with his 
personal relationships. Springsteen uses a number of popular sayings to 
help the character overcome his difficulties with ―the other‖ while 
trying to tell him how to behave and how to focus life differently like 
when in the ―The Ghost of Tom Joad‖ one of the verse sings: ― Waitin‘ 
for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last‖. Patience,
 acceptance of one‘s fate and appreciation of simple details seem to be 
really advisable as well as the daily effort and willingness of working 
hard to get the most out of you and out of the others. There is also a 
kind of redemption through which one person can feel spiritually 
rewarded and useful to others. The changeability of life and the fact 
that everyone has its opportunities to change, to adapt, and to ―take 
the ride‖ as Springsteen himself would say: ―knowing you could lose 
didn‘t mean you didn‘t still take the ride. In fact, it made taking the 
ride all the more important‖ (Alterman: 265). All these suggestions or 
advice seem to be behind this story in order to help the character to 
overcome and to adapt to his situation.<br>
<br>
In The Grapes, The Joads take also the ride when their consciousness is 
awakening, : ― This you may say of man...having stepped forward, he may 
slip back, but only a step, never the full step back‖ (Grapes: 150) 
through the novel, they are learning to change, to adapt to the new 
conditions, that is the only way they can survive as when they take 
―their step forward‖ and begin to realise they are not the only ones<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Got a one-ticket to the Promised Land You got a
 hole in your belly and a gun in your hand Sleeping on a pillow of solid
 rock Bathin‘ in the city aqueduct</em><br>
<br>
immerse in this situation but thousands more, so they come to understand
 that they need to behave differently, they need to cooperate to 
survive: ―The two men squatting in a ditch, the little fire, the 
side-meat in a single-pot, the silent, stone-eyed women...the baby has a
 cold. Here, take thus blanket. It‘s wool...This is the beginning from 
―I‖ to ―we‖. <br>
<br>
The words ―a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand‖ from this stanza
 of ―The Ghost of Tom Joad‖ bring us to another song of the album called
 <strong class="text-strong">―The New Timer.</strong><br>
<br>
 In it, Springsteen tours us to another part of the country which was 
well known by Steinbeck. The narrator, a labourer with a boxcar hobo 
credentials dating back to the Depression, having left the Northeast, 
travels to America countryside looking for work. The story is again very
 similar to the one in ―The Ghost of Tom Joad‖ where the narrator meets 
Frank, who becomes a mentor for him. They travel from East Texas to New 
Mexico, to Colorado and California, hoeing sugar beets and picking 
peaches as the lyrics says. The narrator remembers Frank‘s advice: ―you 
don‘t cross nobody / you‘ll be all right here kid‖, meaning that it is 
better to follow the rules, to accept conditions, to be careful with 
what you say when being in the American side, but the following summer 
Frank is found dead in Stockton (California). Like Casy in The Grapes, 
he was a victim of a motiveless crime: ―That shiny bastard. That‘s 
him... Casy stared blindly at the light. He breathed heavily. ―Listen‖, 
he said. ―You fellas don‘ know what you‘re doin‘. You‘re helpin‘ to 
starve kids.<br>
The narrator also tells about the bad treatment they received concerning
 their working experience: ―They bunked us in a barn just like animals /
 me and a hundred others just like me‖, similar image to that of The 
Grapes: “We tried to camp together, an‘ they druv us like pigs. 
Scattered us. Beat the hell outa fellas‖ . Eventually, the New Timer‘s 
character will lament about his loneliness and the family he has left 
behind.	He will be alone, without job, in a hostile world where he will 
try to survive with a ―machete‖ and at the mercy of Jesus. In fact, this
 was how the ―ticket to the promised land‖ put an end to this story.<br>
<br>
In other stories such as ―<strong class="text-strong">Across the Border</strong>,
 Springsteen makes us travel to the ―mythical promised land‖ where the 
character tries to fulfil his dream and be in peace with him, physically
 or metaphysically speaking. The geographic ―border‖ that the Bravo 
waters form from south western Colorado State to the Gulf of Mexico has	
much broader connotations than the mere physical ones. The narrator 
sings that he has packed his bag; he seems ready to cross a border which
 will lead him to his love. They will be reunited; they will sleep in 
the open sky in each other‘s arms. As he keeps saying, all the pains and
 sadness they have met in this world will disappear as soon as they 
―drink from the Bravo‘s muddy waters / where the sky grows grey and 
white‖, but the waters are ―muddy‖ and the sky is not blue, so maybe the
 new life will not be so idyllic as he wishes.	In spite of some 
darkness, the character has the dream of building a home on a grassy 
hill where:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Sweet blossoms fill the air<br>
Pastures of gold and green Roll down into cool clear waters</em><br>
<br>
Waiting for the time when he finally will reach that instant of bliss. 
The moment is so perfect, that it becomes difficult to think that this 
paradise will be found in earth but maybe in Heaven. He keeps being 
strong, having faith:<br>
<br>
For what are we Without hope in our hearts That someday we‘ll drink God‘s blessed waters And eat the fruit from the vine<br>
However, this physical border could be referring to another boundary 
which all human have to face, the one between life and death:<br>
Tonight we‘ll sing the songs And tomorrow my heart will be strong And 
may the saints‘ blessing and grace Carry me safely into your arms<br>
<br>
With this story, Springsteen brings us back to the Joads when they were 
coming closer to California, ―the promised land‖ which was to fulfil 
their dreams and expectations: ―suddenly they saw the great valley below
 them...The vineyards, the orchards, the great flat valley, green and 
beautiful, the trees set in rows, and the farm houses. And Pa said, ―God
 Almighty!‖ The distant cities, the little towns in the orchard land, 
and the morning sun, golden on the valley‖ (227).<br>
This was Grandpa‘s only dream about California: ―Jus‘ let me get out to 
California where I can pick me an orange when I want it. Or grapes. 
There‘s a thing I ain‘t never had enough of. Gonna get me a whole big 
bunch a grapes off a bush, or whatever, an‘ I‘m gonna squash‘em on my 
face an‘ let‘em run offen my chin.‖ <br>
<br>
In fact, the Joads felt very proud about their status of ―homesteaders‖ 
as it gave them the sense of property of the land as when Tom, after 
leaving the prison and coming closer to his house pointed to the 
boundary fence: ― That there's our line. We didn‘t really need no fence 
there, but we had the wire, an‘ Pa kinda liked her there. Said it give 
him a feelin‘ that forty was forty‖. As tenants, this was their land. 
They were born there, they had worked there, and they even ―had to kill 
the Indians and drive them away...‖ . According to them this made 
ownership, not a paper with numbers.<br>
But if at that time the monster was represented by the bank which they 
could not control, being forced to get off the land, it seems that after
 a time, roles had got upside down in the sense that in earlier 
generations the ―monster‖ could have been the first colonizers, the 
pioneers, even Grandpa, all of them driven by the greed of land.<br>
<br>
When Pa Joad realises that he cannot work his land since his individual 
labour is not anymore useful, his dream crushes.	―The myth of the 
frontier‖ which means going west, starting anew, forgetting about past 
which is present in many of the tenants like Pa Joad vanishes.	However 
as Louis Owen would say:<br>
This Garden is inhabited by flawed men, men who, like Tom with his scar 
at the novel‘s end, are marked. The Eden - and Canaan-like valley that 
spreads so wonderfully beneath the Joads will prove to be filled with 
hatred, violence, greed, and corruption- the fruits of man‘s wisdom and 
knowledge lying rotting in the fields and orchards. It is a heavily 
ironic promise into the Promised Land (Bloom: 70)<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">“WITH THE GHOST OF OLD TOM JOAD”</strong><br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Now Tom said ― Mom, wherever there‘s a cop 
beatin‘ a guy Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries Where there‘s a fight
  ̳gainst the blood and hatred in the air Look for me Mom I‘ll be there 
Wherever there‘s somebody fightin‘ for a place to stand Or a decent job 
or a helpin‘ hand Wherever somebody‘s strugglin‘ to be free Look in 
their eyes Mom you‘ll see me</em><br>
<br>
On one way or another, this is what many of Springsteen‘s characters experience about their own American Dream.<br>
<br>
Finally with ―The Ghost of Tom Joad‘s words ―bathin‘ in the city 
aqueduct‖, the Joads and the Wilsons from The Grapes come to our mind 
again when they stop at Needles for getting water. Finally, they have a 
bath in the river: ―They lay in the water and looked across at the sharp
 peaks called Needles, and the white rock mountains of Arizona‖ (203) 
where water helped them relieved themselves physically and also 
spiritually. This is when Noah expresses that he likes to stay there 
forever and in fact he will leave the family. At the same time, Tom 
begins to have the premonition that ―This here‘s a murder country. This 
here‘s the bones of a country. Wonder if we‘ll ever get in a place where
 folks can live  ̳thout fightin‘ hard scrabble an‘rocks‖ . The water 
acts as a symbol of renewal and also as a symbol of conversion to a new 
faith or a change into a new situation as it happens with the character 
of Bravo waters in ―Across the River‘ song.<br>
At the end of Springsteen‘s ―The Ghost of Tom Joad‖, it seems that the 
narrator is trying to reproduce Steinbeck‘s Tom Joad‘s last words with 
his mother before taking the ride of his own life at the end of the 
novel. Eventually Tom‘s consciousness is awakening and he has been fully
 aware of Casy‘s words since the day they met after Tom left McAlester‘s
 jail while going home. Now, Tom knows how put	Casy‘s words in action 
and he promises his mother to be true to himself, to the land and to his
 breed while fighting and helping the others.<br>
<br>
With his words ―I‘ll be there‖, he means he is going to be present, he 
will fight to defend anybody who is involved in a fight or in any bloody
 situation like it is the case with the character in ―<strong class="text-strong">Balboa Park</strong>,
 where prostitution, corruption is present during the story. He also 
―will be there‖ in ―Galveston Bay‖ where the two main characters are 
surrounded by ―hatred in the air‖ and where a story about racism and 
revenge takes place. He will be present ―wherever there‘s somebody 
fighting for a place to stand‖ or where he would be needed to help to 
find a decent job as is the case of the character in ―Sinaloa Cowboys.<br>
<br>
―<strong class="text-strong">Sinaloa Cowboys</strong> lyric chronicles 
the lives of two Mexican brothers, Miguel and Louis, who crossed the 
border into California and began working in the orchards of San Joaquin 
Valley. They left their families and homes; they headed north working 
all day long doing jobs that others would not do.	One day, they heard 
from some Sinaloa men (Mexico) that some workers were needed in Fresno 
County (California) in ―a deserted chicken ranch‖ cooking 
methamphetamine.	In spite of the physical danger involved in the job:<br>
<em class="text-italics"><br>
If you slipped the hydriodic acid Could burn right through your skin 
They‘ve leave you spittin‘ up blood in the desert If you breathed those 
fumes in</em><br>
<br>
The brothers chose this illegal job as they could make quicker money 
than working in the orchards. By the end of the story, Louis has an 
accident when the kitchen explodes. Miguel carries his young brother ―To
 the creekside and there in the tall grass, Louis Rosales died ―, then, 
Miguel droves him to a grove where they had buried the money they had 
saved. Miguel digs up the ten thousand dollars and buries his brother in
 the grave, act which symbolizes the exchange of money for life. At that
 moment, he recalls his father‘s words mentioned at the beginning of the
 song: ―My sons one thing you will learn / for everything the north 
gives, it exacts a price in return‖.	Louis is another casualty of drugs,
 another story that can be found in many inner-cities which are 
characterized by urban-decay. Drug-dealers could be the ones to blame 
for the death of Louis but maybe the truth is that ―others‖ could be the
 responsible of his death.<br>
This is the cost of living in the promised land of the New West as the 
father had well experienced along the years working in industrialized 
areas which do not give anything for free and where working conditions 
are not easy, not even decent. More often than not, the use of these 
working conditions are degrading as is the case in The Grapes when the 
son of Joe Davis‘s boy prefers to take a job in which he is going to 
earn enough to feed his family in spite of being morally corrupted 
against his people as the tenant said to him: ―But for you three dollars
 a day fifteen or twenty families can‘t eat at all. Nearly a hundred 
people have to go out and wander on the roads‖ . His greed and 
individualistic behaviour did not allow him help the others, choosing to
 follow the orders from the East and ―crushing the house like a bug‖. 
This is what the power of money can do in some situations where human 
beings turn into cold machines.<br>
<br>
There is also another scene in which the family is trying to bury 
Grandpa but as they cannot pay for a funeral they are discussing the 
best way of burying him just not to have problems with the law: ―The 
gov‘ment‘s got more interest in a dead man than in a live one. They  ̳ll
 go hell-scrapin‘ tryin‘ to fin‘out who he was and how he died‖ to what 
Casy responded with a comforting prayer, telling them that the poor man 
has lived his life and the rest of the family had to go ahead even if he
 had to be buried like a pauper. Again,	the power of money dividing 
social classes even when dying.<br>
<br>
―<strong class="text-strong">Balboa Park‘s</strong> lyrics tells about 
the story of a teenager boy and other friends who deal with drugs and 
get involved in a bad game between drug dealers ―in their Mercedes‖ and 
the patrol borders. Sure the boys have met doing the same dehumanizing 
job somewhere. The boy in the lyrics, Spider, hears the border patrol 
near the bridge and begins running down the highway. During the raid, he
 gets hit by the car and nobody stops to help him. He is too invisible 
to the eyes of authorities and other citizens who maybe use this road to
 commute to his peaceful suburban areas from their work. The character 
takes shelter in an underpass where he lies among the filth, waiting for
 his death. This is the side of America cities nobody mentions. The main
 topic of the lyric deals with the cost of living in the Promised Land 
among drug dealers. Little Spider and the other hustlers X-man and 
Cochise	smuggle cocaine from Mexico: ―they come north to California / 
end up with the poison in their blood‖ as the narrator says. Maybe they 
have made the choice of earning fast money; maybe they have been forced 
to accept this job as they have to send money to their families apart 
from the earnings to subsist including their own intake of inhalants 
like the ―toncho‖ mentioned in the song. Never mind if the work is a 
degrading one which means risking their lives everyday: ―He did what he 
had to do for the money / sometimes he sent home what he could spare‖. 
More often than not poverty and powerlessness go together and as a 
consequence these people are excluded from society. In addition, their 
skin colour, their roots and their language help them to be easily 
trapped under these fatal circumstances.<br>
<br>
Some other times, Springsteen‘s stories tell about right choices 
although they involve prejudices, internal fights when the character is 
hesitating about his deep values as is the case in ―<strong class="text-strong">Galveston Bay.</strong>
 In it, Le Bin Son, a Vietnamese immigrant decides to come to America 
after having ―fought side by side with the Americans‖. He left Saigon 
and brought his family to the Promised Land and settle down in the Gulf 
of Mexico, a place which ―reminded him of home‖. He worked hard as a 
machinist, saved money to buy a ―shrimp boat with his cousin / And 
together they harvested Galveston Bay. The other important character is 
Billy Sutter, an American who fought in Vietnam too. After being 
wounded, he shipped home in ‘68 and he married, had a family and made 
his living fishing in the gulf. As more refugees came, Billy, the 
veteran together with other native-born Americans began to be resentful 
as they ―settle on the same streets and worked the coast they grew up 
on‖. Soon in many locals it was heard ―America for the Americans / 
Someone said, ―You want  ̳em out, you got to burn  ̳em out‖ and the Ku 
Klux Klan invaded the place with racist feelings.	After a trial, he 
could leave the court, but Billy said ―My friend, you‘re a dead man‖ 
wanting to revenge the death of one of his friends.	One night, Billy had
 the opportunity to commit the crime, but he finally forgave him, or at 
least he tried to turn away from his devils:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Le lit a cigarette, the bay was as still as 
glass As he walked by Billy stuck his knife into his pocket Took a 
breath and let him pass</em><br>
<br>
Billy seemed to have understood and accepted what Le Bing had done. Both
 had been fighting for the same cause in Vietnam, later, life had 
brought them to America with the aim of living a decent and peaceful 
life with their families : ―And casts his net into the water‖ is a verse
 which is used three times along the song giving sense to this wish. In 
fact with ―every wish it comes a curse‖ as Springsteen would say in some
 lyrics. Maybe here both character‘s wish was thrown there, into the 
waters, trying to find what they need to feed their families and their 
own souls. However there was something in this multicultural world that 
filled Billy with prejudices of race, an anger towards the situation but
 in fact, in Vietnam, Billy could have been the vulnerable one, not the 
stronger among Le‘s people.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">The highway is alive tonight But nobody‘s 
kiddin‘ nobody about where it goes I‘m sittin‘ downhere in the campfire 
light With the ghost of old Tom Joad</em><br>
<br>
For the vast majority of Springsteen‘s characters, the American dream 
has turned into an empty one like the okies. Ironically, California 
which stood for the Promised Land with beautiful springs, green fields 
plenty of trees in blossom ready to fulfil the dreams of migrants who 
desperately needed to pick up some fruit to survive, were forced to see 
and suffer more humiliations: ―Carloads of oranges dumped on the ground.
 The people came for miles to take the fruit, but this could not 
be...they had to be destroyed to keep up prices‖  while they were dying 
of hunger. The image of degrading labor conditions at that time began to
 be voiced by some of the characters, and Casy was the one acting like a
 leader.<br>
<br>
After leaving Weedpatch Camp, the Joads found themselves in an 
overcrowded ―highway‖ heading north in search of a new field where to 
work. Crossing such a rich country, they were overwhelmed by a feeling 
of happiness dreaming once more about picking up plenty of peaches, 
grapes and having a small house, but	all of a sudden, these dreams fade 
away at Hooper Ranch: ― in the eyes of people there is the failure; and 
in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of 
people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy 
for the vintage‖ (349).	Lies, speculation, prices slowing down and 
starvation among other injustices filled the souls of people with wrath.
 This is what Casy tried to tell Tom when they met under the bridge near
 the highway: ―It‘s need that makes all the trouble...one fella yellin‘,
 an‘nothin‘ happened...then another ...Then somethin‘happened!They come 
a- runnin‘, and they give us some other stuff to eat‖ (382). After 
Casy‘s experience in jail talking, listening and observing other 
fellows, he came to realise that they had to tell the others what was 
happening. Casy‘s former religious speeches had turned	into	workers 
prayers to help them realise that they had to be together and yell for 
their rights. After Casy‘s death, Tom cannot stop thinking about Casy‘s 
words: ―a wilderness ain‘t no good,  ̳cause his little piece of a soul 
wasn‘t no good  ̳less it was with the rest‖ after what Tom decides that 
although human beings are normally alone, their soul can be shared in 
order to reach the same objectives.<br>
<br>
In chapter 28, while the family is working as cotton pickers and is 
living in boxcars sharing what they have with the neighbours, Tom has to
 hide after having taken revenge on Casy‘s death. He is badly injured 
and although it is going to be difficult for him to escape from the 
estate, he has to take a decision and leave the family. He tries to 
sooth the farewell with	his mother, giving her hope since maybe they are
 not going to be able to see each other anymore physically, but 
reassuring her that his spirit will always be near her:<br>
<br>
I‘ll be ever‘where-wherever you look. Wherever they‘s fight so hungry 
people can eat, I‘ll be there. Wherever they‘s a cop beatin‘ up a guy, 
I‘ll be there. If Casy knowed, why, I‘ll be in the way guys yell when 
they‘re mad an‘-I‘ll be in the way kids laugh when they‘re hungry an‘ 
they know supper‘s ready. An‘ when our folks eat the stuff they raised 
an‘ live in the houses they build-why, I‘ll be there. See? God, I‘m 
talkin‘ like Casy. Comes of thinkin‘ about him so much. Seems like I can
 see him sometimes. <br>
With these words, Tom Joad is taking the ride like Casy did before him, 
and others have done during their lives. Since old times troubadours, 
song-writers and writers have told their folks about the experiences of 
many fictional and non-fictional characters and through their short or 
long narratives, real or allegorical stories have been there informing 
―the others. If their works had not been transmitted, present 
generations would not have known about their past and perhaps and human 
evolution would have been different.<br>
<br>
Steinbeck‘s Tom Joad was immortalised in the story of	The Grapes of 
Wrath and as he has grown old, Springsteen has invoked ― his ghost‖ to 
give voice to the thousands of invisible people that nowadays are 
suffering the same injustices as Tom Joad and others who have long time 
ago disappeared. Along these last lyrics, ―the ghost of old Tom Joad‖ 
has been already there witnessing different deaths through the stories 
of Balboa Park ,Sinaloa Cowboys and Galveston Bay where the characters 
have been involved in the decay, darkness and emptiness of a modern 
America. They have been exploited in their jobs, and they have faced 
emotional struggles when trying to accept the ethnic ―other.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">CONCLUSION</strong><br>
<br>
As this dissertation has tried to argue, Springsteen‘s The Ghost of Tom 
Joad can be understood as a close adaptation of Steinbeck‘s The Grapes 
of Wrath, now cast in the genre of folk music. Whether the main purpose 
of Springsteen was actually to adapt the novel or to use it as a source 
of inspiration to tell about the suffering of American people basically 
invisible to the eyes of society is not relevant here. However, we can 
claim that the use of a fictional character such as Tom Joad is an 
effective use of the literary original in order to speak about what was 
going on in America in the 1990s.<br>
<br>
My point here is not analyze the specific circumstances that brought 
Springsteen to read from Steinbeck or other authors to fulfil his 
projects while creating and writing his lyrics; but what it is certain 
is that Tom Joad helped Springsteen to give voice to his message. With 
the release of this album in 1995, Springsteen helped to resurrect 
Steinbeck‘s character as one who was witness to all the injustices and 
suffering of a sector of his contemporary American society and to a 
certain extent, to society in general.<br>
As mentioned in the introduction, ―the land‖ and mainly ―the greed for 
the land‖ brought many immigrants to America with the desire of getting a
 decent job and a home where they could fulfil their dreams. If, during a
 certain period of time, America stood for the Promised Land, where 
opportunities for getting land were many, through the years this dream 
has become a nightmare.<br>
Springsteen‘s vision of justice and fairness has also transformed over 
the years, and at some points in his life he has tried to express his 
concerns and tell people about struggles and injustices by helping the 
voiceless. He has wanted to make his audiences ―reflect‖ on human 
behaviour, and the loss of values of this society. Even though he had 
tried to do this in previous albums, it was The Ghost of Tom Joad that 
turned out to be his most intimate and convincing album in this 
particular ambit. With his harsh voice and simple accompaniment, he was 
giving a direct, uncomplicated and accessible voice to the anxieties of 
many people (as well as to his own worries), just as Steinbeck did in 
the 30s with his novel.<br>
Audiences are free to interpret his lyrics in many ways, but whenever 
Springsteen composes, he appears to have a particular project in mind. 
His lyrics give<br>
response to a variety of events which, as well as reflecting his 
personal ―journey‖, may also affect the experience of a whole community 
or even his own experience. Through his career, lyrics to songs such as 
―The River, ―My City in Ruins‖, ―The Last Carnival or ―This Land is your
 Land‖ have been used to speak about life, to give support to a given 
cause, to pay tribute to a friend (to mention only a few examples). But 
what is certain is that Springsteen always offers the message of ―faith 
and hope‖ to overcome any spiritual or physical loss. In recent albums 
he has gone back to old folk songs, he travels back to earlier times, 
invoking the pioneering ―American spirit‖ present in song-writers such 
as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, as well as in writers such as 
Steinbeck.<br>
<br>
With The Ghost of Tom Joad, Springsteen paid tribute to Steinbeck‘s 
Grapes by allowing people to know more about this work and the 
novelist‘s vision of America in earlier decades. Springsteen‘s concerns 
are the same as Steinbeck‘s and both men have, in effect, played the 
role of Tom Joad throughout their careers. My aim here has been to 
analyse how Springsteen‘s characters evolve into a socially conscious 
characters during the course of their stories and how their suffering 
develops into a focus for exposing injustice, exactly in the same way as
 Steinbeck‘s characters did. In that sense, the whole album seems to be a
 legacy of Steinbeck‘s vision, warning his society about the 
consequences of the disappearance of human values in the face of a cold 
and materialistic society. Steinbeck‘s fears were that the uprooting and
 alienation of society was destroying the soul of America; my reading of
 Springsteen‘s lyrics would seem to confirm this fear, as expressed 
through the characters that reveal the injustices of their world or, in 
contrast, struggle to keep up their small moments of dignity. Perhaps we
 now no longer need to search any further for the ghost of Tom Joad: in 
the narrative folk songs of Bruce Springsteen‘s music, he is already 
with us.</div>

Who's the Boss, Steinbrenner or Springsteen?<br>
Eric Hellman</strong><br>
<br>
As I started playing with Mathematica when it first came out (too late 
for me to use it for the yucky path integrals in my dissertation), I 
just had to try Wolfram|Alpha. The vanity search didn't work; assuming 
that's what most people find, its probably the death knell for W|A as a 
search engine. Starting with something more appropriately nerdy, I asked
 W|A about "Star Trek"; it responded with facts about the new movie, and
 suggested some other movies I might mean, apparently unaware that there
 was a television show that preceded it. Looking for some subtlety with a
 deliberately ambiguous query, I asked about "House" and it responded 
"Assuming "House" is a unit | Use as a surname or a character or a book 
or a movie instead". My whole family is a big fan of Hugh Laurie, so I 
clicked on "character" and was very amused to see that to Wolfram|Alpha,
 the character "House" is Unicode character x2302, "⌂". Finally, not 
really expecting very much, I asked it about the Boss.<br>
<br>
In New Jersey, where I live, there's only one person who is "The Boss", 
and that's Bruce Springsteen. If you leave off the "The", and you're 
also a Yankees fan, then maybe George Steinbrenner could be considered a
 possible answer, and Wolfram|Alpha gets it exactly right. Which is 
impressive, considering that somewhere inside Wolfram|Alpha is 
Mathematica crunching data. The hype around Wolfram|Alpha is that it 
runs on a huge set of "curated data", so this got me wondering what sort
 of curated dataset knows who "The Boss" really is. To me, "curated" 
implies that someone has studied and evaluated each component item and 
somehow I doubt that anyone at Wolfram has thought about the boss 
question<br>
<br>
The Semantic Web community has been justifiably gushing about "Linked 
Data", and the linked datasets available are getting to be sizable. One 
of the biggest datasets is "DBpedia". DBpedia is a community effort to 
extract structured information from Wikipedia and to make this 
information available on the Web. According to its "about" page, the 
dataset describes 2.6 million "things", and is currently comprised of 
274 million RDF triples. It may well be that Wolfram Alpha has consumed 
this dataset and entered facts about Bruce Springsteen into its "curated
 data" set. (The Wikimedia Foundation is listed as a reference on its 
"the boss" page.) If you look at Bruce's Wikipedia page, you'll see that
 "The Boss" is included as the "Alias" entry in the structured 
information block that you see if you pull up the "edit this page" tab, 
so the scenario seems plausible.<br>
<br>
Still, you have to wonder how any machine can consume lots of data and 
make good judgments about who is "The Boss". Wikipedia's "Boss" 
disambiguation page lists 74 different interpretations of "The Boss". 
Open Data's Uriburner has 1327 records for "the boss" (1676 triples, 
1660 properties), but I can't find the Alias relationship to Bruce 
Springsteen. How can Wolfram|Alpha, or indeed any agent trying to make 
sense of the web of Linked Data, deal with this ever-increasing flood of
 data?<br>
<br>
Two weeks ago, I had the fortune to spend some time with Atanas 
Kiryakov, the CEO of Ontotext, a Bulgarian company that is a leading 
developer of core semantic technology. Their product OWLIM is claimed to
 be "the fastest and most scalable RDF database with OWL inference", and
 I don't doubt it, considering the depth of understanding that Mr. 
Kiryakov displayed. I'll write more about what I learned from him, but 
for the moment I'll just focus on a few bits I learned about how 
semantic databases work. The core of any RDF- based database is a 
triple-store; this might be implemented as a single huge 3 column data 
table in a conventional database management software; I'm not sure 
exactly what OWLIM does, but it can handle a billion triples without 
much fuss. When a new triple is added to the triple store, the semantic 
database also does "inference". In other words, it looks at all the data
 schemas related to the new triple, and from them, it tries to infer all
 the additional triples implied by the new triple. So if you were to add
 a triples ("I", "am a fan of", "my dog") and ("my dog", "is also known 
as", "the Boss"), then a semantic database will add these triples, and 
depending on the knowledge model used, it might also add a triple for 
("I", "am a fan of", "the Boss"). If the data base has also consumed "is
 a fan of" data for millions of other people, then it might be able to 
figure out with a single query that Bruce Springsteen, with a million 
fans, is a better answer to the question "Who is known as 'the Boss'" 
than your dog, who, though very friendly, has only one fan.<br>
<br>
As you can imagine, a poorly designed data schema can result in 
explosions of data triples. For example, you would not want your 
knowledge model to support a property such as "likes the same music" 
because then the semantic database would have to add a triple for every 
pair of persons that like the same music- if a million people liked 
Bruce Springsteen's music, you would need a trillion triples to support 
the "likes the same music" property. So part of the answer to my 
question about how software agents can make sense of linked data floods 
is that they need to have well thought-out knowledge models. Perhaps 
that's what Wolfram means when they talk about "curated datasets".</div>

Bruce Springsteen's "Factory": A Theological Reflection</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Early in the morning factory whistle blows,<br>
Man rises from bed and puts on his clothes,<br>
Man takes his lunch, walks out in the morning light,<br>
It's the working, the working, just the working life.<br>
<br>
Through the mansions of fear, through the mansions of pain,<br>
I see my daddy walking through them factory gates in the rain,<br>
Factory takes his hearing, factory gives him life,<br>
The working, the working, just the working life.<br>
<br>
End of the day, factory whistle cries,<br>
Men walk through these gates with death in their eyes.<br>
And you just better believe, boy,<br>
somebody's gonna get hurt tonight,<br>
It's the working, the working, just the working life.<br>
</em><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen burst into the national limelight in 1975 with his 
classic musical expression of naive youthful idealism, Born to Run. In 
what I consider to be his best song, "Thunder Road," the narrator 
expresses his desire for a better life, and entreats his girl to come 
along as escapes the stultifying life of his has-been home town: "It's a
 town full of losers/I'm pulling out of here to win." Well, in the 
following years Bruce — courtesy of former manager Mike Appel — learned 
first hand of the vicissitudes of life and the crushing of the human 
spirit that inevitably comes when "the promise is broken."  The result 
was his bitter and bleak classic of disillusionment, Darkness on the 
Edge of Town, which was finally released in 1978, and from which is 
culled the somewhat obscure, country-tinged ballad, simply entitled 
"Factory."<br>
<br>
Springsteen's inspiration for this song came, not surprisingly, from his
 father, a man who bounced around from job to unsatisfying job, 
including stints in the old Karagheusian Rug Mill in Freehold, New 
Jersey (referenced in his 1984 song, "My Hometown") and a plastics plant
 that served as the direct inspiration for the lyric about encroaching 
hearing loss (Springsteen discusses this here). Considering the strained
 relationship Springsteen had with his father throughout his youth, it 
comes as no surprise to hear the deliberate allusion to the melody of 
Andrew Lloyd Webber's "I Don't Know How to Love Him," from Jesus Christ 
Superstar (especially evident in the instrumental bridge played by Roy 
Bittan and Danny Federici).<br>
<br>
With haunting simplicity, Springsteen captures the soul-killing drudgery
 and (often) meaninglessness that characterizes so much work in both the
 industrial and (now) post-industrial eras in the West — and, just as 
importantly, the deleterious effects of such on human relationships both
 in the home and in society. What I would like to suggest is that, in 
doing so, the Boss has provided an exquisite artistic commentary on what
 the biblical Book of Genesis portrays as one of the consequences of 
humankind's fall into sin. Genesis 3:17-19 read as follows:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">To Adam he said, “Because you listened to your 
wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, ‘You must 
not eat from it,’<br>
“Cursed is the ground because of you;<br>
    through painful toil you will eat food from it<br>
    all the days of your life.<br>
It will produce thorns and thistles for you,<br>
    and you will eat the plants of the field.<br>
By the sweat of your brow<br>
    you will eat your food<br>
until you return to the ground,<br>
    since from it you were taken;<br>
for dust you are<br>
    and to dust you will return.”</em><br>
<br>
It is essential to realize that the mandate of work itself is not the 
curse. Rather, the curse consists in the transformation of work, which 
is part and parcel of what being human entails, into toil. The "thorns 
and thistles" of the creation narrative illustrate the kinds of 
difficulties one inevitably encounters while laboring in the fallen 
world in which we now live. Humans, indeed, were created to work in 
their capacity as God's image bearers, wisely bringing God's rule to 
bear on the created order. But, as we all instinctively know, things are
 not as they are "supposed to be." And nowhere is this more evident than
 with respect to work. As anyone, like I, who has ever been employed to 
do industrial shift work can readily attest, work all too often bears 
the marks of tedium and insignificance, bringing with it mental anguish 
even as it hastens the physical breakdown to which we all eventually 
succumb. And this is especially the case when work is cut loose from its
 proper context as a means to glorify God and mediate his rule, and used
 instead as a means of self-aggrandizement in the arena of cutthroat 
competition for societal prestige and material comfort.</div>

Dylan, Young, Geffen, Springsteen, and the Head-On Collision of Rock and Commerce<br>
By Fred Goodman<br>
Random House/Times Books<br>
<br>
ROBERT CHRISTGAU</strong><br>
<br>
Like Fredric Dannen's 1990 Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside 
the Music Business, The Mansion on the Hill tells a great story that's 
weakened by a humdrum thesis--or, to be more precise, tells a bunch of 
great stories that cry out for a thesis strong enough to hold them 
together. Lacking Dannen's convenient suspicion that rock and roll is a 
Mafia plot, the best Fred Goodman can do for a narrative and analytic 
thread is to cry somewhat incoherently in his beer about the long-lost 
'60s. His advantage is that by eschewing the page-turning True Crime 
Tales that help make Hit Men so much fun, Goodman's research ends up 
seeming somewhat more substantial. But where Dannen strives to pinpoint 
murky relationships between minor record executives and the Mob, 
Goodman--a business reporter who, unlike Dannen, has always made music 
his beat--sticks to far more significant bizzers who don't need crooks 
to help them win at information capitalism.<br>
Foremost among these is David Geffen, as of 1990 the industry's first 
billionaire. Bruce Springsteen and his producer-manager, lapsed rock 
critic Jon Landau, place a clear second. Note, however, that the other 
star attractions proffered by Goodman's subtitle, Bob Dylan and Neil 
Young, play exemplary roles no larger than those of, for instance, Dee 
Anthony, a hilariously (if chillingly) unclassy manager few potential 
readers have ever heard of, or Dylan's legendary handler Albert 
Grossman. Stars move product, and Times Books is in the entertainment 
business too--as is Goodman, this publication, and your humble reviewer.
 The differences among us, decisive though they may be, are matters of 
style and degree--a truth that Goodman glimpses intermittently if at 
all.<br>
<br>
Geffen is a fascinating figure, and if no one has yet satisfactorily 
explained his synthesis of solicitous empathy and ruthless greed, much 
less what it portends about the way we live now, that's excellent reason
 for Goodman to try. He organizes the facts expertly, with special 
attention to both the fiscal machinations underlying Geffen's empire and
 the unflappable charisma that has discouraged any but the most 
foolhardy from getting in his way. Starting off at Hustler U., a/k/a/ 
the William Morris mailroom, Geffen discovered--as had Grossman, several
 of whose acts Geffen briefly booked--that a passion for music was a 
shrewd businessman's most bankable asset in hippie-era rock. Having 
established his bona fides with his immensely remunerative 
representation of Laura Nyro and Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, 
Geffen created a record label he dubbed Asylum for such Los Angeles 
soft-rock icons as Joni Mitchell, Jackson Browne, and the Eagles. 
Delighted to have a killer deal-maker shielding them from the stink of 
lucre, these unsullied souls were shocked when he sold their safe haven 
to Warner Bros. for $7 million in 1972. But this was hardly the first 
time--or the last--that big-money transactions for Geffen's clients 
ended up profiting him even more.<br>
<br>
Goodman leaves little doubt that it's been 20 years or so since Geffen 
cared for one of his "significant artists," to use his pet phrase, the 
way he loved Laura Nyro in 1967. His enduring passion and genius is 
financial. Worth $30 million by 1980, he took $25 million of Warner 
money and parlayed Geffen Records, where younger hirelings nurtured the 
multiplatinum, into his billion. Now he is a Broadway angel, Hollywood 
producer, philanthropist, and liberal macher who brutalizes perceived 
rivals while skillfully manipulating his own legend. What makes him tick
 is probably a gift for power itself. No wonder nobody understands 
him--the very few who share this ability don't waste time writing about 
it. Still, Goodman might have noted that other billionaires exert their 
largess less humanely, and wondered why Geffen doesn't.<br>
<br>
The author's small interest in such distinctions very nearly wrecks the 
Springsteen sections, where it is difficult not to suspect some unstated
 personal animus against the artist and especially Jon Landau. Since 
Goodman is a stickler about conflicts of interest, I should note that I 
knew Landau slightly way back when and was once close to his sometime 
associate Dave Marsh, an intimacy that suffered a permanent crimp in 
1975, when I publicly accused Springsteen of not being God. He isn't, 
and no matter when you think he peaked, it's reasonable to believe his 
best years are past. Nevertheless, Springsteen has proven both more 
vital and more moral than skeptics would have deemed possible. While a 
return to the wordy sprawl Landau excised from his music in the late 
'70s might be refreshing long about now, Goodman's attempt to paint this
 uncommonly honest and idealistic rock star as an irrelevant hypocrite 
simply isn't convincing. A failure to vote is hardly proof that you 
don't care about the working class.<br>
<br>
The author's grudging admission that Springsteen "provided entertainment
 value in an extremely ethical manner" merely muddles his story further.
 Relying on such sources as a rejected early fan who confides that Bruce
 "isn't very bright" (an opinion that--even in the unlikely event it's 
true--might help explain why he was rejected) and a faithful lighting 
designer who develops "a bad cocaine habit" after Springsteen fires him 
(leading one to wonder whether it was merely mild before), Goodman can't
 get over the inevitable fact that Springsteen isn't the wartless 
paragon hagiographers like Marsh claim.<br>
<br>
Thematically, this obsession connects to Goodman's belief that what made
 rock a form of unparalleled promise was its roots in the hippie 
counterculture, where, according to Goodman, it "assumed the mantle of 
meaning and intent from folk music." He can see that hippiedom's wuzzy 
vision of peace and love had even less chance of coming true than the 
Movement's inflamed fantasies of overthrowing capitalism. But that 
doesn't stop him from blaming Jon Landau for refusing to act on these 
illusions. Landau has always believed that the best thing about rock and
 roll was the musical spark that originally made it such a hot 
commercial item, not its noble links to Joan Baez and Pete Seeger. Hence
 he's concluded that only within the music business can rock and roll 
make its impact as rock and roll. This vision has severe limitations, 
especially in its resistance to formal innovation and cultural 
weirdness. But Landau and Springsteen have made lots of remarkable music
 out of it, not all of which has been calculatedly market-ready.<br>
<br>
Don't misunderstand me. For any longtime fan, it has been confusing and 
often disheartening to watch a popular form get rationalized into a $12 
billion business--to watch the meaning of "commercial," a term Goodman 
tosses about with unseemly abandon for a business reporter, change from 
something like, "If we do this, kids will like it," to "If we do this, 
we can maximize our audience share and/or optimize our profitability." 
My nomination for the bleakest moment here comes when Dee Anthony drills
 his charges in Al Jolson's stagecraft--for 25 years I'd wondered why 
fools from Peter Wolf to Peter Frampton suddenly started milking the 
same shtick at the same time. But I'd understand if more casual 
observers cited Goodman's succinct, damning account of rock's 
international corporatization. Similarly, I understand why many prefer 
Neil Young's eccentric career to Springsteen's. I do myself. But 
eccentricity is the opposite of a political or social solution, which 
can only begin with a cogent anlysis of the cultural contradictions 
well-meaning artists like both Springsteen and Young are living through.
 Regrettably, this ain't it.<br>

Bruce Springsteen<br>
Devils &amp; Dust<br>
<br>
By Carlo Wolff</strong><br>
<br>
My thoughts run in threes on this album, Devils &amp; Dust: folk, rock, pop; Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen.<br>
There’s a doctoral dissertation to be written on the culture of Columbia
 Records, primary home to Cash (he started on Sun and defected to 
Mercury, but his key stuff was on Columbia, at least until Rick Rubin 
landed him for the American Recordings), Dylan (a Big Eye stalwart save 
for an early-’70s defection to David Geffen’s Asylum for a few records) 
and, ever since Greetings From Asbury Park in 1973, Springsteen. All are
 idiosyncratic, speak for the common man (albeit in different tongues), 
and are, in their heart, folksingers. They’re also quintessentially 
American, compassionate, and even spiritual.<br>
Each imagines himself into the core of this country, and each speaks for
 America at its best. Theirs are lonely voices, particularly these days.
 Cash’s, sadder yet, is now still.<br>
The nearest antecedent to Springsteen’s first album in three years is 
the similarly intimate, similarly anomalous 1987 disk Tunnel of Love. 
This is not the Springsteen of the grand gesture, who performs with the E
 Street Band. Nor is it the Springsteen of Nebraska, his chilling, 
gothic 1982 work, or of the even less audible, equally moving Ghost of 
Tom Joad, his 1995 sleeper.<br>
This is more diverse than these, and, perhaps, subtler. It’s surely one 
of his most controlled and effective albums, even though he lets loose 
emotionally on several tunes. As a storyteller, he’s extraordinarily 
precise and imaginative here.<br>
My wife, a diehard Springsteen fan as I’m a diehard Dylan fan (it’s 
generational), turned me onto “Maria’s Bed,” the beautiful hornpipe at 
the center of this. It was the first tune I heard from it, and it’s 
enchanting and joyous. Then I popped the CD into my car player and began
 to absorb it. It’s a complicated, textured album indeed. There’s the 
stark, cold “The Hitter,” a tune about a corrupt boxer who tries to hold
 onto his integrity. There’s “Black Cowboys,” a bleak, vividly imagined 
picture of ghetto life. There’s “Leah,” a rollicking tune of domestic 
aspiration, and there’s a clutch of tunes about the tamed, commercial 
West we know now and the lost Wild West that inspires us.<br>
So there’s folk, in “The Hitter” and “Silver Palomino”; rock, in the 
political, “Rising”-evocative title track and “All the Way Home,” a 
supplicant’s toughest stab at relevance; sex, in “Reno,” a tune so 
salty, so sad, so lubricated Wal-Mart would be scandalized; and pop, in 
“All I’m Thinkin’ About,” the oldest tune on the album.<br>
Written in 1991, the anomalous “All I’m Thinkin’ About” is one of the 
best pop tunes Springsteen has ever written, right up there with 
“Dancing in the Dark” (and a whole lot prettier). He sings it falsetto, 
as he does parts of “Maria’s Bed”; that’s a new persona for him, and 
it’s totally alluring. Springsteen is in his mid-50s now, but he’s never
 sounded so coltish. Why he didn’t include it on Human Touch and Lucky 
Town, his forgettable double release of 1992, is a mystery.<br>
None of this is overtly topical, but it’s immediate and universal. I’d 
love to know where Springsteen goes for inspiration; I suspect it’s 
family and friends.<br>
The music on Devils &amp; Dust, sparked by the woozy gypsy violin of 
Soozie Tyrell, the sharp, refined drumming of Steve Jordan, and 
Springsteen’s wife, Patti Scialfa, on vocals, is never obtrusive. 
Brendan O’Brien’s production is friendly and inviting, and the Nashville
 String Machine is anything but goopy. That it’s largely about aspiring,
 about including all those marginal characters who’ve combined into the 
United States despite ever-longer odds, makes it all the more moving.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen: Nebraska (1982)<br>
CASSETTE CASE<br>
MARCH 5, 2013</strong><br>
<br>
Disclaimer: It’s outright absurd to be writing a blog post about Bruce 
Springsteen’s Nebraska in the year 2013. It’s such a widely respected, 
acclaimed, revered, and eminently American album. Nebraska is so deeply 
and deservedly entrenched in its canonical place that it feels as though
 nothing less than an extensively researched, heavily notated 
dissertation could even begin to do it any sort of literary justice. So,
 Mr. Springsteen, please pardon the brevity.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen had been reading the stories of Flannery O’Connor soon
 before beginning to write the material that would comprise Badlands, 
and it shows. Through these songs flows a bleak, though not hopeless 
sense of powerlessness in the face of a starkly American strain of 
fatalism. The protagonist of title track “Nebraska”, based on real-life 
murderer Charles Starkweather, cites unrepentantly the existence of “a 
meanness in this world” as explanation for his crimes.  Self-proclaimed 
lack of culpability is a theme that runs through Badlands, and key lines
 are repeated in multiple songs. Criminal protagonists in “Nebraska”, 
“Johnny 99”, “Highway Patrolman”, and “State Trooper” all refuse to 
repent; this theme is eerily paralleled in the religious (though 
arguably also Nietzschean) song “My Father’s House” with the line 
“Shining ‘cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned.” 
Springsteen was of course raised Catholic and has cited his religious 
upbringing as a strong influence in his work.<br>
<br>
One gets the sense that Springsteen’s protagonists are not so much 
asserting their innocence as they are eschewing personal blame in the 
light of the insurmountable social and economic conditions that would 
only grow more rigid with the incipient domestic plague of Reagonomics. 
The classic Springsteen protagonist could be viewed almost as a martyr. 
Rather than repent to lessen his sentence and save his own neck, this 
protagonist instead (particularly in “Johnny 99”) states honestly and 
plainly the conditions leading to his predicament, leaving himself at 
the mercy of the judge and jury.<br>
<br>
One achingly poignant line that is featured in two songs (“Atlantic 
City” and “Johnny 99”) “debts no honest man could pay”, cuts to the 
heart of what Springsteen seems to be really about, especially with 
Nebraska. The working people who populate his world have the odds 
stacked against them, and can only work so many hours for low pay before
 they’re pushed to the fringe, out of money, options and patience. The 
“gates of hardened steel” that surround the “Mansion On The Hill” are a 
clear metaphor for the sadly apocryphal state of the American Dream and 
the absence of social and economic mobility. The vastness of the country
 and its massive geographical features also shape the fates and psyches 
of these people. When, in more than one song, the plea to “deliver me 
from nowhere” is offered, it seems to be used both literally and 
figuratively.<br>
<br>
There are a few lonely beams of redemption shining down on this dark 
landscape. “Reason to Believe” marvels at man’s ability to sustain hope 
in the face of adversity, bereavement, and loss. “Atlantic City” touches
 upon the possibility of reincarnation with the line “But maybe 
everything that dies someday comes back.” And, though excluded<br>
<br>
from the comforts and carefree festivities behind the hard steel gates, 
the people down by the mill nonetheless enjoy hiding in the “tall corn” 
and beholding the “beautiful full moon rising” above the mansion on the 
hill.</div>

THE FREE THINKER<br>
Bruce Springsteen on Jesus</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Every now and then a song rises to the top of my personal charts.  The latest is "Jesus Was an Only Son," by Bruce Springsteen:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Jesus was an only son<br>
As he walked on Calvary's hill<br>
At his side his mother Mary<br>
In the path where his blood spilled<br>
<br>
Jesus was an only son<br>
In the hills of Nazareth<br>
Reading the psalms of David<br>
At his mother's feet<br>
<br>
A mother prayed, 'Sleep tight my child sleep well<br>
For I'll be at your side.<br>
No shadow, no darkness, no tolling bell<br>
Shall pierce your dreams tonight.'<br>
<br>
In the garden of Gethsemane<br>
He prayed for the life he'd never live.<br>
He beseeched his Heavenly Father to remove<br>
The cup of death from his lips.<br>
<br>
Now there's a loss that can never be replaced,<br>
A destination that can never be reached,<br>
A light you'll never find in another's face,<br>
A sea whose distance cannot be breached.<br>
<br>
Jesus kissed his mother's hands<br>
And said, 'Mother, still your tears<br>
Remember, the soul of the universe<br>
Willed a world and it appeared.'</em><br>
<br>
I think that's the best portrayal of Jesus's humanity I've ever read.  
That's partly because Jesus's divinity is not mentioned.  It reminds me 
of Bulgakov's potrayal of "Yeshua" in his novel The Master and 
Margarita.  Bulgakov's "Yeshua" is heart-breaking good, but his goodness
 is a naivete which is helpless against Pilate.  There is no 
resurrection.  Christians believe in Jesus's humanity, as well as his 
divinity-- that's the whole point-- but I wonder whether they are 
permanently unable to express it as poignantly as the "good agnostic" 
(agnostic about Christianity, not necessary about God) for whom Jesus's 
humanity is all that there is.  The apostles, after all, were like the 
"good agnostics" in the time of Jesus's Ministry: like Springsteen or 
Bulgakov, they recognized his goodness, but not his divinity.<br>
<br>
Bulgakov's "Yeshua" is a fictional character, and Christians would have 
some reason to take offense at the liberties Bulgakov takes with the 
historical record.  But there is nothing in Springsteen's song, as far 
as I can tell, that a Christian should object to.  The second and third 
verses, about Jesus's childhood in the hills of Nazareth-- it is the 
portrayal of Jesus's childhood that makes him so human-- are not in the 
Gospels, which all either begin with Jesus's Ministry (Mark and John) or
 jump from the Christmas story to Jesus's Ministry (Matthew and Luke).  
In the Gospel of Luke, there is a single episode in between, about Jesus
 teaching in the Temple when he was twelve.  That's all the Bible says 
about Jesus's childhood.  Yet Jesus must have had a childhood, and the 
two scenes Springsteen represents-- Jesus reading the psalms of David at
 his mother's feet, and Mary singing him a lullaby-- are as orthodox as 
you could ask for.  We know that Jesus must have read the psalms of 
David a lot because he quoted from them so much in his teachings.  This 
is more obvious from the "good agnostic" point of view than from the 
Christian point of view: I think Christians can have a vague notion that
 since Jesus was God, he was omniscient and wouldn't have needed to 
study.  Or maybe Jesus read the psalms for devotional reasons; we know 
that he prayed often during his Ministry.  And the other verse.  Did 
Jesus need to be comforted by his mother, like any common child, to go 
to sleep?  Well, yes.  That's the incarnation for you.  Yet it's amazing
 to imagine it.  Anyway, given how little the Bible says about Jesus's 
childhood, it's remarkable that Springsteen was able to write two verses
 about it without making anything up.<br>
<br>
<br>
Reversing the Gospel pattern, Springsteen details Jesus's childhood and 
then jumps over Jesus's Ministry, straight to Gethsemane, where he 
mentions another astounding fact which Christian believers in Jesus's 
divinity would find hard to accept if it weren't there in the Gospels 
(though it occurs to me now: Jesus was alone, so how did the evangelists
 know about it?): that Jesus didn't want to go through with it!  He must
 have known, surely-- conceived it somehow, at least, even in his human 
state-- that his death was the only hope of salvation for the world.  
How could he ask the Father to "take this cup from me" (even if he added
 "not my will, but yours be done")?  What could be more heart-breaking? 
 The  threads of tragedy that bind this world together broke the heart 
even of God.<br>
<br>
The fifth verse is pure Bruce Springsteen, with his ethos of infinite 
sadness.  And if the song ended there it would quite definitely not be a
 Christian song (as The Master and Margarita is not a Christian novel). 
 But then there is the sixth verse, where Jesus, who resembles for the 
first time in the song the Jesus of authority-- he is calmly comforting 
his mother, not begging for reprieve, even though he is about to die-- 
reminds Mary: 'Remember the soul of the universe / Willed a world and it
 appeared.'  What can I add?  Rarely have twelve words evoked such a 
sense of wonder in me as these.  Creation!  Yet how is it relevant?  
Somehow, it is intimated, the power of God ("the soul of the universe") 
can heal even this unspeakable grief, the mother watching her son go to 
die-- but nothing is said of how, no promise is explicitly made.<br>
<br>
There is a sense, I think, in which this song is wiser than the ancient 
Church Councils: wiser, because it says less, because it uses the 
details of the Bible to evoke the humanity of Jesus, because it 
juxtaposes heart-breaking sadness on impossible hope, because it opens 
the mind to the great mystery without trying to formulate it.  The 
ancient Churchmen knew they could never put into words "the mystery of 
faith," that the best they could hope to do was to put a hedge against 
error.  Praise God for their work, and I am in their debt for guidance. 
 I do believe they got it right.  They were trying to express, as this 
song does in its way, the mystery of the incarnation, and they came up 
with dogmas like:<br>
<br>
the Son of God is true God, born of God the Father before all ages, and 
is eternal, as is God the Father; He was begotten, and not made, and is 
of one essence with God the Father. (First Ecumenical Council, Nice, 325
 AD)<br>
the equality and the single essence of God the Holy Spirit with God the 
Father and God the Son. (Second Ecumenical Council, Constantinople, 381 
AD)<br>
united in Jesus Christ at the time of the incarnation were two natures, 
divine and human, and that one should confess Jesus Christ as true God 
and true Man, and the Holy Virgin as the God-bearer (Theotokos).  (Third
 Ecumenical Council, 431 AD)<br>
as God Jesus Christ is eternally born from God. As man, He was born of 
the Holy Virgin and in every way is like us, except in sin. (Fourth 
Ecumenical Council, 451 AD)<br>
in Jesus there are two wills, Divine and human, and in these two natures
 there are two wills, but... the human will in Christ is not against, 
but rather is submissive to His Divine will. (Sixth Ecumenical Council, 
Constantinople, 680 AD)<br>
(All quotes from The Law of God, Archpriests Seraphim Slobodskoy, 1996.)
  But even if the Councils were right, was it worth it?  Each council 
was a source of schism, with some who had been at peace with the Church 
becoming heretics.  Had they stayed in the fold of the Church they would
 have been a source of confusion, but sometimes, perhaps, sometimes, of 
insight too-- as Bruce Springsteen and other good agnostics sometimes 
have been.  Would it be better if the Church had more room for them?<br>
<br>
I owe this song a person debt: it opened my eyes to the cult of the 
Virgin Mary, which I had never quite understood.  There aren't many 
stories about Mary in the Bible.  She mostly does only one thing, though
 of course that one thing-- bringing Jesus into the world-- is very 
important.  She deserves our respect, to be sure, but why is she honored
 above the Apostles, who spread the Gospel and died as martyrs, or above
 any of the prophets and saints?  What was the sense of making 
intercessory prayers to the Virgin Mary?  Imagine her trying to cope 
with all those millions of prayers!  It's one thing for God, an 
omnipotent Being, to hear so many prayers, but poor Mary-- just a simple
 Jewish girl, with so much responsibility!<br>
<br>
But think of Mary singing a lullaby to Jesus-- to God-- in the night, to
 comfort his childish fears and help him sleep.  Mother of God.  Moses 
saw God in fire and cloud on Mount Sinai, and in the Burning Bush, and 
only a few times.  Mary-- she spent thirty years of her life with him, 
with him every day, not fully understanding who he was, to be sure-- we 
learn that from Luke-- yet she was able to bear the divine presence.<br>
<br>
If I could write one song like this my life would not be wasted.</div>
