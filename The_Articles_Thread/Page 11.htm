<br>
David Sinclair, Times, The, 3 June 1985<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen: Slane Castle, Dublin<br>
<br>
"HE DOESN'T WEAR his money on his back", commented the Irish cabby, 
referring to the renowned lack of ostentation of Bruce Springsteen, the 
man responsible for the first of the season's major outdoor events, a 
vast gathering on a cloudless summer day on the banks of the River 
Boyne.<br>
<br>
The rustic charm of the setting belied the good-natured pandemonium 
which prevailed in some parts of the enormous audience, estimated at 
100,000. Although there was a cool breeze, stewards continually sprayed 
water from hosepipes over the sweating bodies crammed in a dark mass at 
the front. A steady stream of casualties were hauled out of the crowd 
and lifted away on stretchers (forty heat victims, two crushed and two 
appendix cases were reported), while some of the more adventurous 
non-ticket holders attempted to swim or wade across the river to gain 
access behind the stage.<br>
<br>
Huge Diamond Vision monitor screens, positioned by the stage, relayed 
close-up images of the musicians that were a good half second out of 
sync with the sound as it struggled to catch up with the sound over the 
distance to the back.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's ability to communicate to such a large gathering was 
impressive, and the visible surges of excitement which greeted the start
 of practically every song bore witness both to the cohesion of the band
 and his strength as a song-writer and performer. Some of the numbers 
were prefaced by long, articulate introductions, and in 'Pink Cadillac',
 a fire-and-brimstone rap concerning the balancing of material greed 
again spiritual wellbeing, made excellent rock 'n' roll listening while 
turning in a sharp philosophical point.<br>
<br>
The poignant melodies of 'I'm On Fire' and 'The River' contrasted with 
the bombastic melodrama of 'Born to Run' and 'Rosalita'. But as ever, 
the core of Springsteen's live appeal was his perfect mastery of the 
rock 'n' roll dance beat. Like the Rolling Stones, to whom he owes a 
small debt, he played songs which absolutely commanded the audience to 
dance: 'Born in the USA' and 'Dancing in the Dark', to name but two, 
sent the cheers of a multitude echoing round the verdant Irish 
countryside.<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: At Wembley Stadium<br>
<br>
Biba Kopf, NME, 13 July 1985<br>
<br>
I HAVE seen the future cast as a rock'n'roll song. I do not much like 
what I see: Bruce Springsteen everywhere confirmed as the way forward – 
the museum-keeper to the flame as the Messiah (yet again). The future 
once more beats a retreat to the past. Your place in it hinges on your 
having a share in the collective memory that governs it.<br>
<br>
The collective memory is selective. It only remembers the good times, 
intrusive bad times – factory shutdowns, wars, girls turning you down – 
serving to point up all the more poignantly the lost good times that 
preceded them. To bring those good times back, Springsteen – an 
undeniably bighearted and enthusiastic keeper of the r'n'r flame 
–pitches his camp/show in this perfect past.<br>
<br>
An "I remember" rap precedes his key songs. Each one recalling the swell
 years running with the boys back in smalltown New Jersey. They boys he 
grew up with became his E Street Band. Together they still quite 
endearingly behave like peewee gang, striding the plateau of the Wembley
 stage like bare-assed kids mimicking a New Orleans marching band or 
indulging daft impressions of ZZ Top, complete with 40 gallon hat. There
 is no malice in the latter impression. This is only loudhearted 
buffooning, for no irony mars Bruce Springsteen's soul. Irony, in his 
book, is a sophisticated trick of the mind adults use to protect 
themselves from the inevitable pains of growing up. Springsteen 
naturally acknowledges he is getting on, pushing 36 in fact, but he 
wants to feel every wrinkle being etched into his forehead. He has no 
need for protective intellectual headgear.<br>
<br>
He wants to be hit between the eyes with the hurt of every factory 
shutdown. He has become a master of recording the slow shock brooding in
 sudden disenfranchisement, of having your ticket to the American dream 
abruptly withdrawn. Sadly, his shock always turns to resignation, mute 
anger becomes wallowing melancholy. The characters in Springsteen songs 
have a seemingly bottomless capacity for taking slaps in the face 
without their faith in the dream being too severely shaken.<br>
<br>
In what should be his most defiant song, the one that lists entering a 
foreign war blind, returning broken and forgotten to no job prospects, 
the one called 'Born In the USA' that opens his concert to the 
accompanying video projection of the Stars And Stripes, Springsteen, 
brought so close to acknowledging complete despair, still affirms his 
faith in the flag, as if his accidental birthright affords him the 
automatic protection of being one of God's chosen people and despite all
 the evidence he has gathered to the contrary.<br>
<br>
The highways of America are strewn with great US novels (Dos Passos' 
USA, Steinbeck, Kerouac) and songs recording the century's shortchanging
 and outright betrayals of the American working man. It would seem that 
in walking these traditions Springsteen is less interested in learning 
from them than simply conforming to them. A new song, however, called 
'Seeds' almost breaks the mould by asserting rage above acceptance. In 
outlining the misery of migrants heading for the Texan oilfields in 
search for work, Springsteen summons an unparalleled ferocity at their 
plight, usefully contrasting their enforced idleness to the band's 
splendid piston-pumping simulation of the oil wells in motion.<br>
<br>
The rage, however, is shortlived. Here comes another "I remember..." to 
disperse it, more nostalgia for cars, gals, guitars, waterholes, rivers,
 endless rock'n'roll summers. The further the Summer of Youth recedes 
into Springsteen's memory, the more warmly he reheats it, remoulding the
 component parts into the shape of rock'n'roll eternals, asserting 
through sheer energy of his stagecraft and his undeniably likeable 
nature that there is only one way forward and it shimmies like this. 
That is, like it always has done.<br>
<br>
But his belief in the regenerative force of rock'n'roll is misplaced. 
The myth of Presley, the Beatles, etc emerging from one long Saturday 
night of '50s teendom is only so much mist. The past appears rosier 
through its haze. It allows for misinterpretation, the renaming of high 
spirits as heroism, for the canonisation of the state of being young, 
thereby establishing it as the touchstone to the collective memory of 
any generation recognizing the classic r'n'r strains in his songs as the
 one pattern for fun.<br>
<br>
For sure it is Springsteen's undeniable achievement that his songs are 
the key to the collective memory for so many. And undoubtedly he has 
defied the general rule that the saturation level of playing the sports 
stadia of the world automatically snuffs the spark.<br>
<br>
The sheer weight of numbers is on his side. The collective memory he 
keeps is subscribed to by millions, and the USA, frozen out in 1977, is 
reborn in a Springsteen song to once more reign supreme in the popular 
subconscious. Kraftwerk's Autobahn has been deserted for Route 66, the 
future has been re-cast as a rock'n'roll song. I do not much like what I
 see.<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: Live/1975-85<br>
<br>
Gavin Martin, NME, 15 November 1986<br>
<br>
GAVIN MARTIN rummages through his pre-Christmas stocking and uncovers 
the heavyweight Broooce, a five-album set of Springsteen live, including
 mucho unreleased material.<br>
<br>
OPEN THE box – 34-page colour lyric booklet and a short note from Bruce.
 There is no commentary, the accompanying five albums recorded live 
across America over 10 years provides eloquent testimony to his status 
as the most resonant and charismatic performer in rock music.<br>
<br>
A Springsteen live album has been on the cards for years, in the interim
 the demand has been met by a host of bootlegs. By the end of the Born 
In The USA tour last year the black market boasted a record of nearly 
every show on the tour. Voluminous as it is (40 songs, 200 minutes of 
music) Live/1975-85 can't hope, nor does it wish, to compete with the 
market supplying every last Bruce belch to the besotted.<br>
<br>
Large chunks of sides 1-3 were live radio broadcasts, there's no 
scramble to include the many '50s and '60s cover versions or a stage 
favourite like 'Fever'. Rather the whole is carefully constructed to 
show Springsteen's growth as the irrefutable centre of, and most 
consistent voice in, popular culture. It's the ultimate titan's 
marketing ploy, allowing him both the last word on his myth and a 
breathing space. There could be no advance on the witheringly intense 
music that climaxes this LP. Live leaves the way clear for a rebirth as 
deliberate as Nebraska.<br>
<br>
Does a decade of anyone merit this much vinyl? After three days' 
listening my answer must be yes. This is a thrilling document tracing 
Springsteen's growth from fantasist and dreamer to a stage where he 
combined it with responsive and perceptive maturity without being a 
contradiction. Much of that has to do with the equivocal relationship 
established between performer and audience, the longings, pains and 
hopes etched in his songs are widely felt. Springsteen and the E Street 
Band fuel tense anticipation more acutely as the set progresses, the 
exhilaration of shared release permeates this record like nothing you'll
 ever hear.<br>
<br>
'Thunder Road' opens – the protagonist and his girlfriend looking for 
redemption in a broken-down car are dispossessed dreamers, everyday 
heroes. The song is beautiful and affecting, words dance on a piano 
rhapsody, the harp adds a lonesome edge, their concerns will remain 
constants throughout the record. But first Bruce has a headful of 
jukebox tunes and purple, image-laden street prose to unload. The joyous
 roar and classy swagger of the band is irresistible, adding all the 
bravado of romantic adventure to songs like 'Growing Up', 'It's Hard To 
Be A Saint' and 'Sandy'. But while hungry for escape and outlining an 
index of possibilities, Springsteen tries to cram too much in.<br>
<br>
Wisdom and focus would come later as would restraint; here 'Adam Raised A
 Cain' is an overwrought firedance and the brooding drama of 'Fire' 
spoilt by a somewhat mannered vocal. In direct contrast to other 
megastars, as Springsteen has got bigger he's become less blustering and
 sprawling, more impacted.<br>
<br>
Not that the panting blitzkreig of 'Rosalita' or a spirited version of 
Steve Cropper's 'Raise Your Hand' are without their charms, it's just 
that for all the group's barnstorming vigour in tackling a mediocre 
bunch of rockers from The River, on side four you know something has to 
change. The carefree recklessness is silenced by the closing 
'Independence Day'. A calmly unfolded tale of struggle between father 
and son this is where the break is made, exuberant heroism now admits to
 fear and uncertainty. From here on Springsteen's personal odyssey and 
his vision of America is more troubled, more demanding – a quite 
different E Street Band sound is shaped to meet it.<br>
<br>
Interestingly, side five showcases songs from Darkness On The Edge Of 
Town though that album preceded The River, but thematically it's more in
 keeping with the harsher world depicted in his '80s work. And the 
versions of the songs here, recorded at the dawn of the decade are a 
revelation; for anyone who ever lived with that record they are 
essential, uncovering new vistas and depth. 'Badlands' is a deep, 
searing wound, jarring, jagged – the gaudy youthful visions splinter; 
the furious claustrophobic power of the band is the only sustenance. 
'Because The Night' and 'Candy's Room' sting and scream for love in a 
remorselessly pounding, vicious backdrop. There wasn't much allusion to 
sex in Springsteen's work before, but here the passion is inexorable and
 the voice resounds with a new surety. The clangorous, superbly 
embittered war of white hot guitar, saxes, synths and keyboards subsides
 for the haunting 'Racing In The Streets'. Here are the hearty fools 
from the old days on the New Jersey boardwalk but celebration is 
replaced by reflection, impending doom. Their quest now requires real 
heroism, the mounting splendour of the music is both a tribute to their 
endurance and a requiem for their dreams.<br>
<br>
Springsteen the high dramatist, orchestrating his character's emotions 
by tapping into the elemental backdrop, scorches the landscape with the 
tunes from Nebraska. He precedes these with a version of Woody Guthrie's
 'This Land Is Your Land' (along with the instrumental 'Paradise By The 
'C'', 'Because The Night', 'Fire', 'Seeds', 'Raise Your Hand', 'War', 
and 'Jersey Girl', that makes eight previously unavailable tracks in the
 collection). He talks about the song's history, how it was written as 
an angry answer to Irving Berlin's 'God Bless America', In so doing he's
 making claims on a tradition of disaffection that runs through American
 culture. What makes Springsteen unique among rock giants is that he's 
made the link between this culture and mass marketing.<br>
<br>
At the moment the most atmospheric performances for me are thus the 
diligently assisted acoustic horror stories, 'Nebraska' and 'Johnny 99'.
 They hang suspended, echoing a terror which buries ever deep into the 
dark side of psyche; here the audience is confronted with experiences 
rather than asked to share them.<br>
<br>
'Born In The USA' bursts with the barely contained rage memorable from 
its performance here last year, it's a lethal assault aimed at all the 
injustices and betrayals felt by native sons and America's enemies since
 the '60s. Anyone who thought it dodgy or jingoist evidently hasn't 
heard this blast of black fury. Along with 'Seeds' this is where the 
beleagured Springsteen characters get their payback. The latter is the 
nastiest slice of crude funk this side of There's A Riot Goin' On 
matched to a tale of uprooted dustbowl refugees. Here he does something 
that the drifter troubadours of the past never did – scouring and 
lambasting the source of injustice with an unsettling, ugly noise. A 
sentimental rambling monologue precedes 'The River' but it works, 
outlining penance, pathos, rebellion and reconciliation in keeping with 
the song's regenerative pulse, melody and message.<br>
<br>
Sixties Motown classic 'War' finds a devastating new relevance, played 
as a matchless nuclear showdown. The disarmingly frank assertion before 
the song's launch that "in 1985 blind faith in your leaders or anything 
will get you killed" should silence those who doubt his intent. And the 
more you go on the better it gets, more inflamed, yet more intimate, a 
panoramic sound that doesn't become crowded, a group that knows the 
value of suggestion over bombardment.<br>
<br>
Springsteen himself has learned economy and the knack of detail. 
'Darlington County' and 'Working On The Highway' feature recognisable 
people, they could be and probably are your friends. His voice too has 
reached a peak of projection, he doesn't have to strain anymore, holding
 the audience spellbound with the locomotive slowburn of 'I'm On Fire', 
the vastly improved ballad version of 'No Surrender', and a gentle 
regreatful 'My Hometown'.<br>
<br>
Throughout Live sticks to a rough chronology but rather than end with 
Born In The USA's most universal track ('My Hometown') side 10 is 
something of a reprise; familiar hopes and promises are reborn and 
affirmed in '10th Avenue Freeze Out' and 'No Surrender'. 'Born To Run' 
is a frantic swirling peal of Godlike thunder, performed at such a 
blasting pitch it's a miracle it doesn't crack.<br>
<br>
Perhaps surprisingly it's not a Springsteen song but a Tom Waits (or T. 
Waite according to my label – I would've thought he was too busy saving 
hostages) that closes, a 1981 version of 'Jersey Girl'. Springsteen adds
 a verse of his own, giving the song added poignancy.<br>
<br>
Live/1975-85 fulfills promises and supplies affirmations, it's all too 
easy to forget rock music is still capable of this. Almost without 
exception each composition is superior to the original recorded version –
 expressiveness more fully coloured, tenderness more warmly cushioned, 
rage more vociferous. It may not prove Springsteen is invincible (though
 he's closer than anyone ever has been) but it will make him immortal. 
£30? Cheap at twice the price.<br>

				<div class="content">Tougher Than Most: Bruce Springsteen's Tunnel of Love tour<br>
<br>
Geoffrey Himes, Baltimore Sun, 24 March 1988<br>
<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN'S 'Tougher Than the Rest' is a sombre, unforgiving 
song typical of his recent Tunnel of Love album. It describes love not 
as an answer to problems but as a reward for survivors of those 
problems, and when he sang it at Philadelphia's Spectrum March 8, he 
gave it a slow, deliberate arrangement that featured ominous 
synthesizers and a funeral march beat.<br>
<br>
Just as the song ended-with Patty Scialfa singing a wordless wail over 
Springsteen's forlorn harmonica solo-a rainbow-colored beach ball 
bounced from the crowd onto the stage. The contrast seemed to crystalize
 the underlying tension of the evening: the collision between the stark 
realism of Springsteen's new music and his audience's expectation that 
he would still be the same old partying hero they've always known.<br>
<br>
When the song was over, Springsteen stepped back to the mike and said 
with no-nonsense bluntness, "Do me a favor and get rid of those fucking 
beach balls." There was a moment of stunned silence, but the beach balls
 never reappeared the rest of the night.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's Tunnel of Love Express Tour, which arrives at the Capital 
Centre April 4-5, is a brilliant evening of music and performance, but 
it is quite different from the celebratory, triumphant juggernaut of the
 Born in the U.S.A. Tour, which came through our area three times in 
1984 and '85.<br>
<br>
The Born in the U.S.A. album was Springsteen's final breakthrough to 
superstardom on the mythic level of a Presley or Beatles, and the 
subsequent tour had the air of a conquering march to the sea that 
rewarded and reaffirmed the tenacious faith of his longtime fans. By 
contrast, this new tour has a more restrained, more individual flavor, 
as if Springsteen were challenging those same fans with his most 
piercing questions about myths in general.<br>
<br>
Springsteen, now 38 and married, seems to be deliberately extricating 
himself from his own self-created image as the eternally young rocker, 
always ready to lead his fans down the highway to a "promised land" on 
the Jersey Shore where the friendships of youth are cemented forever by 
rock'n'roll. Instead it seems he's trying to recover his individual 
voice so he can speak to his audience rather than speaking for them.<br>
<br>
The stardom that Springsteen achieved four years ago is a double-edged 
sword. On the one hand, providing a shared experience for such a broad, 
diverse audience is an invaluable service in a society divided so many 
other ways. On the other hand, sustaining that consensus often requires 
so much universalization that the songs can lose their bite.<br>
<br>
Springsteen learned this the hard way. The Born in the U.S.A. album was 
strongly influenced by his increasingly left-wing populism, but he 
deliberately avoided making those sentiments explicit to keep the record
 accessible to the widest possible audience. In doing so, he allowed 
right-wingers from Ronald Reagan to George F. Will to misinterpret the 
title song as a bit of flag-waving patriotism.<br>
<br>
So on this tour, Springsteen is no longer trying to be everybody's 
friend. In Philadelphia, he did a vicious parody of right-wing preachers
 which included the declaration that "Pat Robertson can't save my soul; 
in fact, Pat Robertson can kiss my ass!" He did a ferocious version of 
'Roulette'. the apocalyptic song about nuclear power on the B-side of 
his new single. Instead of laying the blame on technology itself, 
Springsteen laid the blame on the political and industrial leaders who 
"keep on playin' roulette with my life, roulette, with my kids and 
wife."<br>
<br>
He included a pounding, stop-and-go version of Edwin Starr's 'War' that 
ended with his 12-member band and the sold-out arena shouting, "War! 
Hunh! What is it good for?" and Springsteen shouting back, "Absolutely 
nothing!" Back and forth the shouts went, building and building until an
 exhausted Springsteen whispered, "Absolutely nothing."<br>
<br>
At that point, everything stopped still for a moment as the singer 
raised his hand above his head. When he whipped it back down, drummer 
Max Weinberg kicked off the familiar riff to 'Born in the U.S.A.', which
 the beefed-up band seemed to play louder and harder than ever before. 
It was the kind of moment that rock'n'roll was made for. Moreover, the 
juxtaposition of the two songs insured no one would misinterpret 'Born 
in the U.S.A.' as a pro-Rambo anthem this time around.<br>
<br>
On any Springsteen tour, the songs change every night, but this March 8 
show was consistent with the new tour's emphasis on recent material. The
 22 songs he performed before the encores included eight songs from 
Tunnel of Love, four songs from Born in the U.S.A., six original songs 
that he has never put on any studio album and only two songs from the 
'70s.<br>
<br>
Even some familiar old songs were radically rearranged. 'You Can Look 
(But You Better Not Touch)' was transformed from a straightahead 
frat-rocker into a loping rockabilly/boogie number. Before he sang 'Born
 to Run', he acknowledged that it was his favorite song; "This song has 
kept me company on my search," he said, "and I hope it has kept you 
company on yours." He then performed it as a solo acoustic folk song, 
Woody Guthrie-style. As he played a slow harmonica solo at the end, it 
was the audience that sang the "woh-woh-woh" refrain.<br>
<br>
He unveiled three songs that he has never released on any record. 'Light
 of Day', the song he wrote for the ill-fated movie of the same name, 
was done in a joyously rocking arrangement that easily topped Joan 
Jett's film version. 'I'm a Coward When It Comes to Love' revamped the 
themes of the Tunnel of Love album into a comic singalong number not 
unlike 'Pink Cadillac'. Set to a reggae groove, 'Part Man Part Monkey' 
made the point that the "creationism" controversy has less to do with 
science than with sex; mimicking an ape on stage, Springsteen sang like a
 man with no shame.<br>
<br>
"The Boss" has added five horns for this tour-including three alumni of 
Southside Johnny's Asbury Jukes. For much of the concert, though, they 
were a subtle presence; they thickened the textures more often than they
 played standard horn charts. The familiar E Street Band was in top 
shape, with Patty Scialfa taking a more prominent role on the new songs 
than she ever had before and with Max Weinberg working harder than 
anyone. Maryland's own Nils Lofgren took several lyrical guitar solos; 
he was especially effective on a haunting version of 'One Step Up'.<br>
<br>
The heart of the show was the Tunnel of Love material. The concert 
opened with the album's title cut, played with the disorienting swirl of
 an amusement-park ride. Just as disorienting for may fans was the 
unheroic, demystifying look at love in the songs. Perhaps the best 
example of this was 'Spare Parts', a jagged-edge blues that told of a 
pregnant young woman deserted by her would-be fiance.<br>
<br>
As the woman in the song took her baby down to the riverside and 
considered the comforts of suicide, Springsteen knelt by the edge of the
 stage as if it were the bank of a river and lowered his voice to a 
scary whisper. Only then, when he had taken his audience to the brink of
 despair, did he stand up and belt out the final lines about the woman 
going home and pawning her engagement ring for some "good cold cash." It
 was a powerful moment, but it was no place for beach balls.</div>

				<div class="content">Was Bob Dylan the Previous Bruce Springsteen?<br>
<br>
Steve Turner, NME, 6 October 1973<br>
<br>
"RANDY NEWMAN is great but he’s not touched. Joni Mitchell is great but 
she’s not touched. Bruce is touched... he’s a genius!" Manager Mike 
Appel is talking in the dressing rooms of the Spectrum stadium in 
Philadelphia. His artist Bruce Springsteen has just finished a 40-minute
 opening set and Chicago are tuning up in the room next door.<br>
<br>
"When I first came across Bruce it was by accident," he says, "but when I
 heard him play I heard this voice saying to me... Superstar. I couldn’t
 believe it. I’d never been that close to a superstar before."<br>
<br>
Not wanting to miss the chance of being Albert Grossman for the ‘70s, 
Appel took acetates of Springsteen straight to Columbia Records in New 
York. There he played them to John Hammond... the man who signed up Bob 
Dylan... and Louis Armstrong... and Bessie Smith... and Billie 
Holiday... and Tommy Dorsey... and Woody Herman.<br>
<br>
Also they were played to then president Clive Davis. According to Appel 
they only needed to hear one track before signing him up.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s a hungry, scrawny-looking guy. There’s definitely 
something very Dylany about his whole being, about his curly licking 
hair and his scrub beard... and, I must say it, about his songs. It’s a 
comparison a lot of people are going to draw because of the connections 
with Hammond, the looks, and the highly influenced style of writing.<br>
<br>
By this time man himself must be regretting the resemblances because the
 surest way of killing a man these days is to liken him to the late Bob.<br>
<br>
Too many people have been primed to walk in to those boots and only to 
find they didn’t fit. After all, no one wants ‘another’ of anything we 
once had, because we still have the original in our collections<br>
<br>
The other fault with PBDs (potential Bob Dylans) is that people choose 
them on looks and sound alone, thinking that’s what made BD into BD. It 
wasn’t. BD filled the psychological need of a generation. Where there 
isn’t a psychological need there’ll be no BD or indeed no PBD.<br>
<br>
The Beatles too came at just the right time in history and filled an 
awaiting psychological vacuum. To think it was their music, or worse 
still their lyrics, that made them the phenomenon they were is to be 
totally naïve.<br>
<br>
We were the phenomenon... our need for them was the phenomenon... and 
they passed the audition to play seven years in the starring role of Our
 Psychological Need.<br>
<br>
Now the 1,000,001 intricacies which make up a moment in history have 
changed. It may never happen again as it did between ’63 and ’70. To 
expect another Bob Dylan or another Beatles is like expecting a reunion 
10 years after any event to be exactly the same as the event itself. No 
way. History itself would need to be reconstructed for such a thing to 
happen.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, BD or no BD, Springsteen is a good ‘un. His songs are 
crammed with words and multiple images. "He’s very garrulous," agrees 
Appel. On stage he’s powerful and confident... there’s a charisma there 
that doesn’t occur with many people.<br>
<br>
His allegiance to Dylan is evident in the songs. They’re mostly stories 
of a crazy dream-like quality. Where Dylan had peddlers, jokers and 
thieves, Springsteen brings us queens, acrobats and servants. Where 
Ginsberg gave us hydrogen jukeboxes and Dylan gave us magazine 
husbands... Springsteen has ragamuffin gunners and wolfman fairies.<br>
<br>
Compare his use of adjectives too. Dylan used "mercury mouth", 
"streetcar visions" and "sheet metal memory"... Springsteen comes up 
with "Cheshire smiles" and "bar room eyes". Another notable likeness is 
in their use of internal rhymes.<br>
<br>
Some of Springsteen’s numbers almost come over as direct parody.<br>
<br>
Just for the record, other PBDs of the last couple of years include Kris
 Kristofferson, John Prine and Loudon Wainwright III. Both Kristofferson
 and Wainwright are the property of Columbia Records... who recently 
lost the services of Bob Dylan. Now, I don’t want to start drawing 
conclusions but...<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is 23 years old and comes out of New Jersey. He first 
started playing music at age nine under the influence of Elvis. At 14 it
 really hit him. "It took over my whole life," he remembers. "Everything
 from then on revolved around music. Everything."<br>
<br>
Two years later he was playing regularly at the Café Wha? In Greenwich 
Village. "I was always popular in my little area and I needed this gig 
badly.<br>
<br>
I didn’t have anything else. I wanted to be as big as you could make it... Beatles, Rolling Stones."<br>
<br>
For the next eight years Springsteen played in bands... Steel Mill... 
Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom... and finally his very own 10-piece band 
which he named after himself. After two years the numbers began 
dwindling.. 9... 7... 5... until... it was Bruce Springsteen – solo 
artist.<br>
<br>
Then: "I just started writing lyrics, which I had never done before. I 
would just get a good riff, and as long as it wasn’t too obtuse I’d sing
 it.<br>
<br>
"So I started to go by myself and write these songs. Last winter I wrote
 like a mad man. Put it out. Had no money, nowhere to go, nothing to do.
 Didn’t know too many people. It was cold and I wrote a lot... and I got
 to feeling guilty if I didn’t."<br>
<br>
At this time he met up with Appel who in turn took him along to meet 
Columbia’s John Hammond. Appel is a fast talker and took it upon himself
 to sell Springsteen.<br>
<br>
Hammond listened and began to take a dislike to this salesman. In 
contrast Springsteen just sat, very quiet, in the corner of the office.<br>
<br>
"Do you want to get your guitar out," asked Hammond. Springsteen did. He began playing ‘Saint In The City.’<br>
<br>
"I couldn’t believe it. I just couldn’t believe it" recalled Hammond.<br>
<br>
In Hammond’s opinion, Springsteen is far more developed now than Dylan 
was at the corresponding point in his career. He feels that Dylan had 
worked hard at creating a mystique even before he signed with Columbia 
but Springsteen is... just Springsteen.<br>
<br>
His first album for Columbia has been Greetings From Asbury Park N.J. 
Reviews have been ecstatic. It marks a strong contrast from the way John
 Prine was handled. In his case it was the publicity handouts that had 
the ecstasy... in the hopes that they could set the Press on fire.<br>
<br>
‘In the tradition of Brandon and Dean’ was how they sold him.<br>
<br>
With Springsteen Columbia are restraining themselves and relying on understatement.<br>
<br>
Mike Appel believes totally in Springsteen. "I’ve sunk everything I’ve 
got into him," he tells me. "And if he doesn’t make it...?" Appel 
demonstrates by holding his nose and flapping around in an imaginary 
ocean.<br>

<br>
Jerry Gilbert, Sounds, 16 March 1974<br>
<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN was confined to the boardwalk life on New Jersey. He 
lived over a drug store "in all the craziness of downtown", prayed for 
summer, sought sanctuary on the beach at Asbury.<br>
<br>
Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J. his picture postcard intro to city life
 is like a holiday ad for Blackpool. On the way it put Springsteen on 
the road to stardom – along with his mates from N.J. He came on like Bob
 Dylan, all the hip imagery and he a frail city urchin with a scrubby 
beard and tousled hair and clothes that he might have been living in for
 the past six months. Springsteen doesn't talk, he mumbles, he don't 
walk, he shuffles.<br>
<br>
He spent a few years quenching his insatiable thirst for the city by 
commuting between Asbury Park and downtown New York – mostly at the Café
 Wha in the Village; spent his CBS advance by putting a band together.<br>
<br>
New Jersey, cowering under the burgeoning weight of New York, could 
never be credited with any character and Springsteen was hardly likely 
to become a significant so long as he stuck to the Jersey bars. The 
Greetings album put 'em both on the map.<br>
<br>
"Jersey's a dumpy joint," Springsteen opined. "I mean it's OK, it's 
home, but every place is a dump. I guess it just took a long time for 
someone to think of something to write about it but Asbury Park had a 
lot to do with the tone of the first album."<br>
<br>
He was hailed as a rising genius – inevitably the new Dylan, but as the 
pressure has been removed so he has tended to get better.<br>
<br>
But right now it's 4.30 in the morning and Springsteen has just 
completed his second show at Georgetown University. Washington, scenario
 for The Exorcist. He's been ill – coughing up blood, causing the 
cancellation of the two preceding gigs. He's still coughing profusely 
and draws on a bottle of prescribed cough medicine which the doctor 
provided along with the statutory shot. What was the matter, Bruce? A 
futile question when you're on the road ninety per cent of the time. 
"The doctor knows I only go and see him when there's something wrong," 
he says, and calculates that he's played over two hundred gigs this past
 year. He puts on his old black jacket, check shirt tails showing out 
underneath. At 4.30 in the morning he shuffles over to the piano in the 
dressing room to play a new song on request, and at five he decides we 
should go and eat. The cops direct us to a subway café which says "Open 
for breakfast" but the doors are closed and we drive back along "M" 
street to Georgetown and the last remaining hamburger joint. Springsteen
 bemoans the lack of good food with a tacit gesture on behalf of his 
sick body and prays for summer and watersports.<br>
<br>
Six o'clock. Springsteen decides the hamburger will be sufficient to 
induce a good day's sleep before catching the train down to New Orleans.
 At his hotel Mike O'Mahony of CBS informs Bruce that I've traveled 
18,000 miles to see the band twice – in Los Angeles last year and in 
Washington tonight. "Sure 'preciate it," he says proffering his hand, 
and disappears to bed.<br>
<br>
Twelve hours earlier we had arrived at the Jesuit college, found the 
hall and walked right in on the soundcheck... "Spirits in the night, all
 night, in the night, all night..." CUT. Back to that bluesy, Discordant
 into, start again, great song that.<br>
<br>
Like most of Bruce's songs, it's improved with age. I mean there's cuts 
on the new album which you'd only just about recognize if you heard 'em 
onstage now – 'New York City Serenade', for instance, whilst 'Kitty's 
Back', an outstanding cut, is stretched across a marathon piano intro 
from David Sancious which is horribly over-embellished but a guaranteed 
winner with audiences.<br>
<br>
"I've never heard him play a song the same way twice," exclaims a 
Springsteen fan who has been following him on the road. And as we survey
 the assembly of instruments and the incongruous bunch of bar musicians 
who are about to play them you wonder how the hell Springsteen can 
induce a discipline that would invite comparisons with Van Morrison.<br>
<br>
Anyhow he's onstage and he's given a pop star's welcome – the crowd are 
screaming for him but they cut off instantly in order to decipher the 
mumble of his opening rap which is a pretty funny monologue punctuated 
by the occasional laugh and the odd decipherable word. He picks up 
acoustic guitar. Danny Federici has accordion and Garry Tallent hauls 
the tuba up into playing position by which time the audience have 
already predicted 'Wild Billy's Circus Story'.<br>
<br>
Gradually he works his way through the new songs – 'Incident On 57th 
Street' which he refers to as 'Spanish Johnny', 'New York City 
Serenade', Then 'Spirit In The Night' which he now intros himself on 
harmonica in unison with Clarence Clemons' sax.<br>
<br>
As the show builds Springsteen eventually picks up his Strat and the 
band rock straight into the 'E Street Shuffle', the highlight of his new
 album, slow the pace for his beautiful love song '4th Of July. Asbury 
Park (Sandy)' which I've never heard referred to as anything other than 
'Sandy'. It's Springsteen at his most evocative, more relaxed and for 
once Springsteen resists the temptations of incorporating as much as 
three different musical themes intertwined in one composition. It's a 
carnival type song with Federici on accordion and Bruce going crazy on 
boardwalk assimilations.<br>
<br>
But he's still in the mood for rocking and attacks 'Blinded By The 
Light', the song that started it all happening for him, with such gusto,
 that he was into the third verse before I'd recognised the song.<br>
<br>
He called for a handkerchief from the audience and went into a new 
comedy routine, the bar entertainer's legacy, and in this instance his 
cold was definitely giving way to what has become a regular feature of 
his act.<br>
<br>
Then he came on with that masterful guitar intro to 'Kitty's Back' which
 smacks of authority like it was the theme tune to some movie epic. 
Anyway this is where the band really starts cooking, organ and sax in a 
swirling mass of sound, Springsteen's guitar rising in sympathetic 
harmony and new drummer Ernest Boon Carter attacking a great solo only 
four gigs after the departure of Bruce's long time sideman Vini Lopez.<br>
<br>
The crowd went wild and demanded an encore. Bruce obliged with 
'Rosalita', one of his own favourites from the new album, and the only 
song remaining for him to play. Sancious and Federici swopped keyboard 
instruments as the ninety minute show reached its conclusion.<br>
<br>
It was after the second show, well over two hours long and featuring old
 standards like 'Let The Four Winds Blow' and 'Walking The Dog', that I 
settled down to talk to Bruce in the desolate dressing room. The band 
had split as had Bruce's manager/producer Mike Appel, and Bruce himself 
was bemoaning the fact that in spite of his marathon stage stint it had 
been impossible to play everything that people wanted to hear. "We're 
doing largely recorded material at the moment because the drummer's only
 been with us for four dates." As to the departure of Vini Lopez, Bruce 
was deliberately vague. "He'd been with me four years," he said "There 
were various pressures – it was a difficult decision to make."<br>
<br>
He broke into another fit of coughing and cursed his ill luck at having 
to cancel those two gigs. "We never do that unless we really have to," 
he qualified – and besides they were New Jersey gigs where he's most 
popular. "I mean you play all the time half sick but it got to the point
 where I couldn't play piano, I was spitting blood. I don't get sick a 
whole lot but this year we have been. I mean we've done so many gigs 
this past year that it just starts to collect...the fatigue...that's why
 it's good to be working on new songs and whenever I have the discipline
 to make myself write, I write. I used to write everyday, on the buses, 
on the streets...but I tend to be more critical now, that's why I 
haven't written much recently."<br>
<br>
He's pleased with the outcome of his new album The Wild, The Innocent 
And The 'E' Street Shuffle but like CBS he's wondering why the album 
sales haven't lived up to the critics' expectations since he's received 
rave notices everywhere. "The new album was a little more what I wanted 
to do – there was more of the band in there and the songs were written 
more in the way that I wanted to write. But I tend to change the 
arrangements all the time in order to present the material best, 
although it's often to suit the style of the band. I just try to update 
things a little bit to keep everybody interested, for instance 'Sandy'. I
 like the way it is on the record but it was entirely different up until
 the night I recorded it and then I changed it."<br>
<br>
Bruce claims that generally his favourite songs were those that were 
written over a short period of time. "'For You' was written really fast 
and 'The Angel' was written in ten of fifteen minutes and that's one of 
my favourites because it's one of the most sophisticated things I've 
written. 'Hey Bus Driver (Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street)' was done 
real quick and 'Blinded By The Light' I wrote partly in the morning and 
partly in the afternoon, in fact the only thing that took time on the 
first album was 'Spirit In The Night'."<br>
<br>
He recognizes that his writing environment is different now – he misses 
that boardwalk existence and maybe the road is no place for a man of 
Springsteen's caliber to be writing. But just how much of the confusion 
he writes about is a true reflection of Asbury life? "I see these 
situations happening when I sing them," he admits, "and I know the 
characters well. I use them in different songs and see them in shadows –
 they're probably based on people I know or else they're just there. 
There's a lot of activity in my songs, a whole mess of people. It's like
 if you're walking down the street, that's what you see, but a lot of 
the songs were written without any music at all – it's just that I do 
like to sing the words!"<br>
<br>
He proceeded to play a piece he is in the throes of completing and then 
outlined his future plans. "I want to get girls into the band for the 
next album because I've got some good ideas which add up to more than 
just background vocals. But right now I don't have the money to do it."<br>
<br>
Springsteen's songs are an often alarming reflection of city streetlife.
 "They're written to be bigger than life," he says, but at the same time
 he admits that he really doesn't have any more insight than anyone 
else.<br>
<br>
"I really didn't spend a lot of time in the city – Jersey was so 
intense, you couldn't even walk down the street so I went to New York 
and used to hand out mostly in the village but also uptown a little bit.
 I was mostly by myself with no particular place to go but sometimes I'd
 hang out with this other guy."<br>
<br>
Yet essentially he was a band musician and only a few months earlier he 
had been hanging out in bars playing blues and rock and roll. "Then I 
wrote my first batch of songs and if nothing had come of it I'd probably
 have been back in the bars by now."<br>
<br>
He quickly overcame his early ego problems realising the 
self-destructive influence he was having on himself. "The mistake is 
when you start thinking that you are your songs," he says. "To me a song
 is a vision, a flash, and what I see is characters and situations. I 
mean I've stood around carnivals at midnight when they're clearing up 
('Wild Billy's Circus Story') and I was scared, I met some dangerous 
people. As for Spanish Johnny's situation well I'd never get into that 
situation but I know people who have lived that life."<br>
<br>
Right now Bruce is working with a pretty regular band "a real spacey 
bunch of guys" with a desire to come to Europe, but not much hope. "It 
just goes on forever here, on and on."<br>
<br>
Quite how long he can continue at this rate – up on stage every night 
playing to ever-increasing crowds obsessed by the idea "that the singer 
is the song" – is anyone's guess.<br>
<br>
But if I traveled 18,000 miles to see the Springsteen band twice, then 
he probably gets through that inside a month – mostly by train!</div>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen - The brilliant, the awful and the bumfluff shuffle<br>
<br>
Charles Shaar Murray, NME, 1 February 1975<br>
<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN IS an excellent rhythm guitarist, which just about compensates for the fact that he grows a terrible beard.<br>
<br>
He also has a knack of making otherwise respectable people say things 
like "I listen to Bruce Springsteen for dear life, the way I used to 
listen to Bob Dylan, John Lennon and Chuck Berry," or even "I have seen 
the future of rock and roll, and it is called Bruce Springsteen."<br>
<br>
This last eulogy emanated from no less a personage than Jon Landau, the man who produced Back In The USA.<br>
<br>
Springsteen was, purely on the strength of Asbury Park, probably the most spectacular of the recent crop of New Dylans.<br>
<br>
He qualified because he was (a) Jewish, (b) the owner of the 
aforementioned terrible beard, an outbreak of bumfluff which instantly 
flashed connoisseurs back to the growth sported by Zimmenheimer at the 
Isle Of Wight, (c) he writes lines like "madmen drummers bummers and 
Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat in the dumps with the 
mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat" and so on ad 
infinitum into the sunset.<br>
<br>
Pretty good, huh?<br>
<br>
Plus he sings like Van Morrison and has a back-up band who, on the basis
 of the photo on the back of The Wild, The Innocent And The E Street 
Shuffle are absolutely the meanest-looking gang of switch-blade jugglers
 since the original line-up of the Butterfield Blues Band. These guys 
just reek of the street; real punks, not a gang of over-dressed poseurs 
with season tickets to Max's.<br>
<br>
Finally, the whole schmear was imported from New Jersey, which, as 
everybody knows, is real effnic like, and full of that real nitty-gritty
 street consciousness which is where it's all really at.<br>
<br>
So you got a smart-ass Jewish punk writing neo-Dylan lyrics complete 
with enough densely-packed internal rhymes to choke Sir John Betjeman, 
backed up by a serviceable R&amp;B oriented band who include among their
 numbers not one but two spades, plus a wop and a Chicano, all of whom 
wear army-surplus clothes which pay lip-service neither to glitter-trash
 to SuperSly pimp-cool.<br>
<br>
Credibility incarnate.<br>
<br>
Still, it's more than a year since that new-Dylan nonsense went down, 
and since CBS have just shovelled both albums out again to get them 
re-reviewed and spark off some hoopla for Brucie's tour, it seems like a
 reasonable time to get down and do some of that there re-evaluatin'. So
 have at thee, Springbum.<br>
<br>
As a lyricist, Our Brucie is very similar to that breed of guitarists 
prevalent some years ago who couldn't bear to play at anything less than
 top speed, and attempted to jam every lick they knew into every single 
solo.<br>
<br>
On Asbury Park, he crams ten minutes worth of lyrics into three minutes 
worth of song, machine-gunning words until they collide with each other 
in mid-air, the bad lines smothering the good like weeds choking out the
 roses in a flower-bed where the gardener is asleep at the switch.<br>
<br>
'Growin' Up' is a good case in point; the tune's a lot like 'My Back 
Pages', and most of the lyrics are pure cosmic punk garf, but just when 
you think that you've been totally suckered into wasting your time, 
Springsteen hits you with a gorgeous line like "I pushed B-52 and bombed
 'em with the blues" and you realise that anybody who could come out 
with a line like that has to be worth listening to even if he's totally 
incapable of acting as his own editor and thereby forces the listener to
 do it for him.<br>
<br>
Then it's almost another full verse of drivel and moonshine I before he 
comes back with "and I swear I found the key to the universe in the 
engine of an old parked car" and that image is almost as exhilarating as
 its predecessors have been irritating and Springsteen's twisted your 
synapses again by being brilliant and awful in adjacent lines.<br>
<br>
Which is infuriating, really, because it leaves you with the nagging 
feeling that anybody who scatter-guns so many lines is bound to win the 
stuffed panda at least once in any given song, and maybe he ain't as 
good as he seems after all.<br>
<br>
If it's still necessary to defuse the "New Dylan" hoax, then a swift 
listen to 'Mary Queen Of Arkansas' should be equal to the task.<br>
<br>
Here Springbok hauls out his acoustic guitar and mouth-harp and tries 
for an action replay of 'To Ramona', fumbling the ball so embarassingly 
that it's almost a relief to get back to his basic R&amp;B musical 
stance on 'Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?' even though this time 
he's going on about "wizard imps and sweat sock pimps, interstellar 
mongrel nymphs" ad infinitum.<br>
<br>
Still, at the end of the first side Springsteen saves his ass in fine style with 'Lost In The Flood'.<br>
<br>
Using the flood as a handy metaphor for 
imminent-doom'n-destruction-and-even-for-(gulp)-life-itself certainly 
isn't unique (see Dylan, B.), but here Springsteen really makes it 
count, anchoring himself down with almost pedantically "street" imagery 
over a steady rolling backup and building up to singularly powerful 
climaxes at the end of each verse.<br>
<br>
So maybe he's not a bozo after all, huh?<br>
<br>
Watch him try not to klutz out on the second side.<br>
<br>
Well, 'Angel''s more or less a dead loss, and that leads us onto 'For 
You', which contains more lyrical dandruff but which fair skips along 
like a young lamb doing the limbo on a GEC hotplate, with distinct signs
 of life from the drummer. However, from here on in things start getting
 really good.<br>
<br>
Exhibit A is a cunning little ditty entitled 'Spirits In The Night', 
which musically recalls the title track from Van the M's Moondance and 
lyrically carries some of the ambience of 'And It Stoned Me' from the 
same album.<br>
<br>
Springsteen discards his tongue-twisting IBM approach in favour of a 
rather charming relative simplicity to tell a story of a gang of street 
types driving off into the hinterlands to get stoned and enjoy a 
midnight swim, and while it's far less ambitious than most of the rest 
of the stuff on the album, it's easily the most satisfactory, with a 
gorgeously loose-limbed R&amp;B swing and a beautiful chorus.<br>
<br>
Finally, 'It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City', which coalesces the 
verbal-diahorrea approach and the street-punk imagery better than any of
 the other attempts included here. It's one of the tracks that Bowie was
 raving about a couple of years ago when he ran down a frenziedly 
drunken number about Springsteen over supper in Paris.<br>
<br>
Greetings From Asbury Park N.J. sounds like the product of an extremely 
talented young guy frantically trying to be impressive and attempting to
 do half a dozen things at once and succeeding only in nearly capsizing 
himself in the process.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, his second album The Wild The Innocent And The E 
Street Shuffle showed him as having gotten far more used to his backup 
musicians (most of whom had played on the first album).<br>
<br>
Instead of being singer-songwriter-plus-band, it was 
band-featuring-singer-songwriter, and while the material wasn't as 
startling, the music was better.<br>
<br>
It gets off to a blinding start with 'The E Street Shuffle', which'd be a
 natural for the J. Geils Band if they weren't so hung up on recording 
their own lame material these days.<br>
<br>
The intro, with Springsteen playing some flashing Telecaster rhythm 
under a stuttering piano loop from the miraculously-named David L. 
Sancious comes as near to getting me off the floor and strutting around 
the living-room as anything else I've heard recently, and it's got a 
great line about "if the kids ain't dancing they're hung up in a 
scuffle/snakeskin suits backed with Dee-troit muscle/doin' the E Street 
shuffle".<br>
<br>
I hate to say it, but damifitain't better funk than most of those spade sharpies are laying down these days.<br>
<br>
The vibometer sinks about eight points with '4th Of July Asbury Park 
(Sandy)' which is dreary as hell, and all that really needs to be said 
about it is that the Hollies have covered it on their new elpee, and if 
you think that I can't wait to hear it, then you're absolutely right.<br>
<br>
The rest of the album is okay, but unspectacular; I've listened to side 
two three times and I can't remember anything about it, whereas all of 
the first album and side one of E Street had made a definite impression 
after on play.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen has very little taste and no small endowment of 
pretentiousness, but when he pulls it off he comes on like a man who 
knows what he's doing at least part of the time.<br>
<br>
If he can develop a little more control without dissipating his energy 
in the process, he may even end up being as good as his more vocal 
supporters claim he is.<br>
<br>
The only thing that really worries me is that the critics who go into 
convulsions over Springsteen are the same ones who raved over Elliott 
Murphy.<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: Into the Future<br>
<br>
Wayne Robins, Newsday, 4 April 1988<br>
<br>
THE "TUNNEL OF LOVE" tour is not rock-and-roll business as usual, or 
even Springsteen business as usual. This, after all, is a show that for 
its first few hours revolves around non-hits, B sides and dramatic 
revisions of familiar material. Say goodbye to 'Thunder Road'. Say hello
 to 'Be True', 'Seeds', 'Roulette', 'War', 'I'm A Coward' and 'Light of 
Day'.<br>
<br>
But this show is not a willful denial of the past. It is a confident, 
mature journey into an uncertain future. It was thematically cohesive, 
as thoughtful as it was uplifting. As the phrase went on the back of the
 T-shirts sold out at the concert, "This is not a dark ride."<br>
<br>
The concert is centered on the songs from last fall's Tunnel of Love 
album, a drastic departure from its predecessor, Born In the U.S.A. 
Instead of proud anthems played and sung with 50-megaton force by 
Springsteen and the E Street Band, the Tunnel songs were rueful 
lamentations on the difficulty of relationships and, occasionally, the 
joy of emotional connection. Members of Springsteen's band made only 
intermittent appearances on the sparely arranged album.<br>
<br>
In concert, the band is back in force, and augmented by a five-piece 
horn section. The Tunnel of Love songs all benefit from the fuller 
arrangements: The primal scream of the single-mother protagonist in 
'Spare Parts' was embellished by howling, bluesy guitar riffs; 'Ain't 
Got You' had a more emphatic rhythmic current that allowed it to segue 
perfectly into 'She's the One', and Clarence Clemons' saxophone parts 
added a rich dimension to 'All Heaven Will Allow'.<br>
<br>
But more than the arrangements have changed in Springsteen's music: so 
has the personality of the group. The E Street Band used to be a rogue 
boys club, with Bruce sometimes literally leaning on Clemons' broad back
 for all the support he needed.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and Clemons don't pal around as much on stage. Now the 
singer draws much of his energy from Patti Scialfa, who has graduated 
from backup singer to a frontline guitarist and vocalist.<br>
<br>
In a theatrical skit before 'All That Heaven Will Allow,' Springsteen 
and Clemons sat on a park bench as the singer reminisced about the old 
days. They're both married now, and Springsteen cut the visit short: 
He's got to be home at 6:30 for dinner.<br>
<br>
Once it was Bruce and Clarence against the world. Clarence is still his 
symbolic best friend, but Scialfa, the symbolic wife, now comes first. 
Their almost shrill shouts in 'Cover Me' evoke all the joys, and all the
 fears, of unbridled intimacy.<br>
<br>
Springsteen used to tell wild stories about running with the boys. 
Friday night, introducing 'Spare Parts', he told how it was about a 
woman "trying to understand the value of her own individual existence", 
and, in an even larger sense, how the past keeps us down when we obsess 
about dreams that don't come true instead of moving forward.<br>
<br>
Just how far forward Springsteen is intent on moving was made clear near
 the end of the show, when he appeared alone with an acoustic guitar. 
The song was one he wrote 15 years ago, and its meaning has changed for 
him. It used to be about running away. Now, he realizes, "You can get 
away, but your individual freedom is meaningless unless it's attached to
 people, friends and feelings you know. . . Here's a song that kept me 
good company on my search. I hope it's kept you good company on yours."<br>
<br>
The song was 'Born To Run'. Sung alone, in this context, the emphasis 
changed drastically, from the teenage boast "tramps like us, baby we 
were born to run" to his adult mission: "I want to know if love is 
real."<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, Springsteen hasn't forgotten how to have fun. 'Hungry 
Heart', 'Glory Days' and the old, reliable 'Rosalita' had an exuberant 
joyfulness, and a Mitch Ryder medley, Arthur Conley's 'Sweet Soul Music'
 and Eddie Floyd's ''Raise Your Hand' ended the night on a roaring 
adrenalin high.<br>
<br>
But what gave richness to the show was Springsteen's insistence on 
dismantling the rock star facade built around him, brick by brick. He 
comes across as a man with an unquenchable desire for growth and 
self-knowledge, who has challenged his audience to keep growing with 
him.<br>

				<div class="content">Casing The Promised Land: Bruce Springsteen at Hammersmith Odeon<br>
<br>
Simon Frith, Creem, 1975<br>
<br>
So you’re scared and you’re thinking<br>
That maybe we aren’t that young anymore.<br>
Show a little faith, there’s magic in the night.<br>
You ain’t a beauty, but hey you’re alright<br>
Oh and that’s alright with me!<br>
<br>
IF BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN had been British he would either have been Leo 
Sayer or, later, if he hadn’t made it the first time round, Alex Harvey.
 Now, Leo Sayer’s a pathetic little fellow who looks like he’s about to 
lie down and let you tickle him, and Alex Harvey’s a cynical old Scot 
with one of the most offensively calculated stage shows you could hope 
to see. Bruce Springsteen, when he was finally ready for London, was 
wonderful, but he wasn’t quite what I’d expected and he had an art that 
Britain could not have nurtured.<br>
<br>
He arrived as the most hyped-up American act in ages. There are other 
bands with obsessive cults and no sales – Little Feat, Steely Dan – but 
Springsteen’s following seemed to grow from an in-rock family affair to 
enough people to fill the Hammersmith Odeon twice with black-market 
chiselers overnight. This was an odd buzz because everyone was expecting
 something but no one knew what. Other unseen acts, like Little Feat, 
had records that were known and loved and the glory of their live show 
was a bonus, but people weren’t that impressed with Springsteen’s 
records. What the hype had done, especially the whisking of Britain’s 
rock press to see the man in LA was convince us that this was going to 
be the greatest live act of the ’70s. How or why, who knew?<br>
<br>
I guess you’re used to this sort of spiel, but we ain’t. Big American 
acts don’t need Britain much and we get them only as a favor or reward 
or never, like Elvis. Big British bands need America so bad that they 
dump any local commitment just to be there and ever since The Beatles 
won, the advance strategies for US conquest have been carefully worked. 
You must be sick of being told that the latest group whose records you 
haven’t bought actually has the most wonderful stage act you’ll ever see
 and has just devastated Britain – Slade? Roxy Music? 10cc? Queen? Alex 
Harvey? But the Bruce Springsteen campaign was special for us and 
because I always believe everything I read in the music press I was as 
excited as everyone else, waiting for this cool, tough, city-slick 
rock’n’roller.<br>
<br>
Well, you’d’ve sniggered too. I mean, he’s so bloody small! I know that 
the average size of a rock star is about 5’1" but on the cover of Born 
To Run Springsteen is leaning down on this big black man so it was kind 
of a shock to see that he actually came up to his nipples. And then he 
was wearing a woolly hat. Not the kind that West Indians wear, with a 
gun and a knife and five pounds of stuff hidden underneath, but the kind
 your mother knits you in case your ears get cold; only his mother had 
given it to him years before and he’d never quite got round to taking it
 off though he did keep dropping it. And dirty baggy pants! And almost a
 beard but not quite! My God, he’s Dustin Hoffman being Ratso Rizzo in 
Midnight Cowboy! This is the future of rock’n’roll??<br>
<br>
Later on I thought maybe and then yes. At the end of one of the encores 
(and before he got into a tedious routine of old rock’n’roll just like 
an English band) his band had to carry him off, two by the ankles, two 
by the armpits, and Bruce had a smile of great joy which you rarely see 
on a rock star these days. I had seen why you have to see him. The 
Springsteen stage show is a jumpy, nervous, desperately dramatic affair;
 not carefully constructed like The Stones’, not floppily spontaneous 
like The Who’s, but lived. Bruce Springsteen has seen a future without 
rock’n’roll and he’s hanging on to what he’s got.<br>
<br>
It took me a while to figure out his persona: his eagerness to please, 
his love of his band, his eloquence and violent vision. I got there in 
the end. Like Stevie Marriott a long time ago, like Van Morrison more 
recently, Springsteen was the kid on the block whose parents didn’t give
 a shit, who lived on the street, raggedy and surviving. He is not the 
laid-back hero that rock stars like to pretend to be, but neither is he 
the fearful observer most rock stars actually are. He was just there. 
Winning some, losing some and always in the action. Cheeky, charming but
 not pleasant, the big boys protected him but sometimes put the boot in.
 It was home and home was rock’n’roll and Springsteen’s secret is his 
absolute belief in what he’s doing. He has to believe it. Without his 
music, nothing.<br>
<br>
The audience clapped and cheered a lot but the critics were cagey. It 
wasn’t just a determination not to be publicly hyped, Springsteen also 
broke the two basic rules of British rock: his band weren’t very good on
 their instruments, and his act wasn’t stylish. British rockers are 
obsessed with technical qualities. Musical skill is valued higher than 
the beliefs and purposes that lie behind it and Springsteen’s band was 
pretty crummy in its technical range and subtlety. They had fun 
together, though: none of the cold concentration of the English 
superstar. Shame on Rod Stewart for leaving his lovely loose back-up for
 the sterile expertise of the Atlantic Crossing session men, but he was 
only following a long British tradition.<br>
<br>
England’s other vice is Art. Englishmen are so embarrassed by their 
emotions that they even play rock behind layers of make-up and silken 
underwear. The latest talent in the heavily disguised Bowie/Roxy mode is
 Queen. Their ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ is top of the hit parade and lasts for
 five minutes and every style from The Beach Boys to Gilbert and 
Sullivan and I still can’t work out what the fuck it’s about. 
"Gali-leo," they chant, "Gali-leo," and I can’t think why. Or Elton 
John. He’s sung easily about everything for years but I can’t remember 
anything he’s said. We do have visionaries but they grow old or drunk 
and even our ace punk, Ian Hunter (‘All The Young Dudes’ is the nearest 
thing we’ve had to the Springsteenian rap) is soft-centered. Like a 
puppy dog. Like Leo Sayer. Which brings me back to where I started. If 
Bruce Springsteen had been British he would have been Leo Sayer. Be 
thankful for what you’ve got and I blame the Welfare State.</div>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: Hustling For Rock’s Record Machines<br>
<br>
Don Snowden, Pasadena Guardian, 24 September 1975<br>
<br>
HE STARTED HIS career as a solo performer and fronting New Jersey bar bands like the Steel Mill and Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom.<br>
<br>
Signed to Columbia by John Hammond in 1972, his first album Greetings 
From Asbury Park, N. J. sent critics scurrying for superlatives; he was 
hailed as another new Dylan for his physical appearance, off-the-wall 
lyrics and imposing array of colorfully-named street characters. The 
chorus of acclaim grew to a roar with the release of The Wild, The 
Innocent And the E Street Shuffle, a 1974 Rolling Stone Record of the 
year; comments placing the future of rock’n’roll on his shoulders began 
to appear and Jon Landau quit his job at Rolling Stone to help produce 
Born to Run.<br>
<br>
He took the E street Band to the alien turf of Texas to play his brand 
of R&amp;B-flavored punk rock drawn from the streets of Jersey and the 
sidewalks of New York to an audience unfamiliar with his work – and 
received a standing ovation after the song. At Carnegie Hall he closed a
 song with the line "Uptown in Harlem she throws a rose to some lucky 
young matador" – and as the last notes faded away, a young girl in the 
audience silently stood up and threw a single red rose past his ear.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is a 25-year old romantic whose feet are firmly 
cemented in urban concrete, whose heart and mind are directly attuned to
 the hopes and fears of the young American male. An adventurous spirit 
musically, his albums range from the acoustic-dominated Asbury to the 
Latin-tinged electric eclecticism of E Street and the arranged precision
 of the new album. Born to Run is a virtual primer on the music of the 
mid-‘60s filtered through the experiences of the ‘70s. Springsteen has 
been ably abetted throughout by the potent E Street Band, a unit who may
 well be everything you always wanted in a rock band but were afraid to 
ask for.<br>
<br>
The power and versatility of the band perfectly complements 
Springsteen’s throaty singing. He is a vocal actor, utilizing techniques
 ranging from a hoarse stage whisper to soulful falsetto whoops to 
maximize the dramatic impact of his songs. The key to his vocal 
effectiveness is his sense of timing, an instinctive grasp of what to do
 when and for how long.<br>
<br>
When his vocal delivery and lyrics mesh, Springsteen is capable of 
creating a compelling persona through vivid imagery drawn from a myriad 
of sources. Springsteen’s lyrics are drawn from the classic themes or 
rock’n’roll – young love, cars, the celebration of youth and the strains
 of growing up, the dream of hitting it big – but with a rare 
combination of intelligence and emotional intensity. His songs, highly 
romanticized depictions of nighttime street life – often cinematic in 
their scope and attention to detail – are populated by people like the 
Magic Rat, Crazy Janey, Spanish Johnny, and Sloppy Sue and Big Balls 
Billy.<br>
<br>
The emotions are extreme, undercut by the desperation and impatience of 
youth and sobering sense of mortality and dashed hopes. He wants to know
 if life is real, to place his faith in the magical spirits of the night
 and find one of his dreams, to die on the streets in an everlasting 
kiss, to run from the stifling atmosphere of his town. The women in 
Springsteen’s life can have hearts of gold (‘The E Street Shuffle’ and 
‘Incident on 57th Street’) or stone (‘She’s The One’); many of his 
greatest songs are those where he must persuade a reluctant woman to 
come with him by painting a vision of excitement and romance in the 
night (‘Rosalita’, ‘Thunder Road’ and ‘Born to Run’).<br>
<br>
Throughout his writing, characters must share the spotlight with 
hemi-powered drones – Springsteen’s obsession with cars rivals those of 
Chuck Berry and the hot-rodding Beach Boys. Automotive imagery abounds; 
cars are vehicles of release from the confining drudgery of the 
nine-to-five world, from the suicide-trap towns full of losers.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is just a prisoner of his dreams, honest and aware 
enough to accurately depict the dilemmas facing someone growing up in 
these times, sensitive enough to capture their emotional quandaries in 
attempting to deal with them. He is the embodiment of the rock 
traditions of the late ‘50s and early mid-‘60s – his genius lies in his 
ability to synthesize those familiar elements into a compelling. It 
works because Springsteen has lived and sings of experiences and 
fantasies common to all: joining the circus, hanging out in amusement 
parks and pinball arcades, cruising in the summer looking for love, 
skipping school and acting cool, staying out all night. The effect is 
galvanizing on vinyl; live, with the E Street Band playing like a jungle
 fire behind him, Springsteen’s impact is riveting. If rock’n’roll has 
ever struck a responsive chord in your soul, this man will affect you.<br>
<br>
He’ll be at the Roxy Oct. 16-19 – don’t expect the tickets to last long once they go on sale.<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: Hammersmith Odeon, London<br>
<br>
Vivien Goldman, Sounds, 29 November 1975<br>
<br>
WHEN THEY were good they were very very good, and when they were bad they were so-so.<br>
<br>
There was an immense feeling of strain about this show, following a 
press and publicity campaign of unparallelled intensity. With slogans as
 pompous as 'Finally...the world is ready for Bruce Springsteen' 
splattered all over town, the poor geezer, unless he has an ego twice 
the size of the Post Office Tower, must have walked onstage with a 
barrel of monkeys on his back.<br>
<br>
It didn't come over like that. Whole chunks of the show were pure 
delight – after the dramatic first sighting of the long-awaited Messiah 
of rock 'n' roll bathed in a shaft of green light, head bowed, in stark 
silhouette, as he intoned 'Meeting Across The River' amidst the unwonted
 sound of silence.<br>
<br>
Yes, the clamorous audience hushed up when their hero came on-stage, one
 of the biggest marks of respect you can get. One of the only musicians 
I've ever seen receive this tribute is wonderful Mike Nesmith.<br>
<br>
The show started off with Springsteen, a tiny figure thrashing about 
with the physical exhuberance that made his music more exciting live 
than on vinyl, through 'Thunder Road' and 'Tenth Avenue Freeze Out'. So 
it carried on for the next hour, the general pattern being that the fast
 ones were better than the slow ones. The reason for this seemed to be 
that Springsteen very much values proximity with his audience, being 
used to the club context in the States, and attempting to strike up a 
rapport when you're separated by yards from a completely unfamiliar 
audience isn't the kind of two-way communication he's used to 
instigating.<br>
<br>
Gags like tumbling into the laps of the front row of the audience, for 
example, are completely out unless you feel like breaking your back. 
Seemingly discouraged, Bruce held back from the sprightly monologues 
introducing and explaining each song that we'd come to expect as one of 
the main charms of Springsteen Live.<br>
<br>
Anyway, 'Worse Than The Flood', and 'She's The One', especially the 
latter, were excellent, with much more attack than the album versions. 
At this stage of the game, Springsteen looked as if he was having an 
infectiously nice time, and Clarence Clemens was letting fly with some 
apt sax, not earth-shattering but suitable.<br>
<br>
They're very funky together but come apart at the seams somewhat when 
called upon to do solos – the biggest mistake of the evening was the 
lukewarm bunch of individual efforts on 'Kitty's Back'. The organ solo 
stank (Danny Federici), but the piano was a little better. Clarence on 
sax came out of it best, Brucie wasn't extra-special and the drummer was
 pretty good.<br>
<br>
I think it was about that time that the old attention began to flag, and
 when you find yourself watching the clock during the premier by the 
Great White Hope of rock 'n' roll, something's wrong somewhere.<br>
<br>
It seemed like the real trouble was that someone had warned Bruce to get
 out there and not let up for 2 hours, play nothing but his own material
 when he usually sprinkles the set with oldies, and the burden of being 
ordered to take London by storm proved too much for his slender 
shoulders. He shoulda done a week at Ronnie's. I'd have liked a good 
bop.<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: Proceedings of Discovery<br>
<br>
Bruce Pollock, Gannett Westchester Newspapers, 1978<br>
<br>
WE ROCK PUNDITS, critics and reviewers, Rockwells of good taste, 
O'Neills of moral fervor, are in reality no better than the average slob
 on the street, nose pressed up against the windowpanes of status.<br>
<br>
We have our own highly-defined Continental League where we vie in the 
standings for points, key by-lines, new discoveries, lead quotes. Each 
of us reads the daily papers to keep tabs on the opposition. Each scans 
the monthlies nervously, afraid of missing a shift in the national 
musical mood. The competition is fierce and deadly. At times sly and 
subtle, it is often hid-	den in the guise of camaraderie.<br>
<br>
Let me take you back to the summer of '74, to the Bottom Line, New 
York's famed hot spot and hangout, where the group known as Kansas was 
being showcased before the press and trade over cocktails, convivial 
chatter, and free food.<br>
<br>
I arrived early, nodding and smiling at familiar faces as I moved toward
 the free food. Halfway there I spotted a face too familiar to ignore: 
Bruce Springsteen, then as yet a budding superstar, a year away from the
 hoopla and the simultaneous covers of Time and Newsweek which are now 
media legend.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and I went all the way back. I was, in fact, one of the 
prime contenders for the title of "The Man Who Discovered Bruce 
Springsteen", along with three or four other prominent journalists – 
each convinced his case was at least as good as mine.<br>
<br>
"Hey, Bruce!" we said to each other, almost in unison, as I slid into 
the last vacant seat at his table, next to him and across from his 
manager, a photographer and the photographer's girlfriend from Ohio. 
Taking this seat I was aware of my honored status. Not every pundit was 
invited to sit at the arm of a budding superstar – and I was at his arm,
 his mouth was less than a foot from my ear. I was in position, through 
judiciously disarming tactics, to elicit virtually a column's worth of 
spicy quotes, perhaps to scoop the entire music press on some unsavory 
scandal heretofore unknown to even avid Springsteenophiles.<br>
<br>
If I maneuvered it right, perhaps I could get the photog to snap one of 
me and Springsteen together, which I could paste into my scrapbook, 
alongside the one of myself and Martin Mull. I even saw the caption: 
Bruce and Bruce – Two Rising Stars!<br>
<br>
At which point, who should saunter	by but another contender for "The Man
 Who Discovered Bruce Springsteen" title. (In the tradition of 
post-Watergate morality and candor, I shall refer to him as Deep Craw.)<br>
<br>
Now the history of my rivalry with Deep Craw for the B.S. trophy (Bruce 
Springsteen, that is) was already probably legend in the industry. 
Although I was one of the first to view the Asbury kid when he opened 
for David Bromberg one dismal evening in Boston in January, 1973, Deep 
Craw ran a cover story in his magazine on the boy a full month before my
 ecstatic review hit the stands.<br>
<br>
During the long lull before Bruce's second album, Deep Craw could be 
heard on the street, claiming to have written the liner notes for it. 
But when the album appeared, no liner notes could be found. (God, was I 
relieved!) Instead it was I who came up with the plum, the Sunday Times 
review of that album, which offered written notice to the world that I 
(as well as, of course, Springsteen) had arrived.<br>
<br>
Then the capperoo. When Rolling Stone ran the Springsteen ad, there was 
my name under the huge lead blurb. Below it, definitely in second place,
 came Deep Craw's quote, no less ecstatic, no less huge, but obviously 
outgunned. Perhaps Deep Craw had been there first, but clearly I was the
 one to watch.<br>
<br>
At the Bottom Line, Deep Craw luckily could not fit next to Bruce and 
had to settle for a seat way at the far end of the table, squeezed in 
behind the photographer's girlfriend. I chuckled as I leaned over and 
whispered a joke for Springsteen's private benefit.<br>
<br>
At which point Don Kirshner ap-peared on the horizon. Kirshner was the 
man who had signed Kansas to his label. He and I went part of the way 
back, so I had to momentarily leave the table to score a point with 
Donnie. When I returned I found that Deep Craw had swiped my seat! 
Blinded by self-pity, I stumbled into his seat, from which obscure 
outpost I sat through Kansas' set – chagrined, dumbfounded, alone.<br>
<br>
When the set ended, suddenly the then-president of Columbia Records, the
 late Goddard Lieberson, spied Springsteen and joined the table in a 
hail of hearty greetings. Room was made for the prez to sit down across 
from Bruce – right next to Deep Craw – while I was edged out even 
fur-ther from the action, forced to mutely watch as the table rapidly 
became the focal point of the entire Bottom Line, with photogs circling,
 groupies gaping, Lieberson, Deep Craw and Springsteen sharing racy 
stories and secret handshakes. (It should have been me in that seat, 
getting my mug in the Trades, nuzzling up to the president and the 
superstar!)<br>
<br>
Ever since then a certain Deep Craw has been going around town thinking 
he had the last laugh on me. Well, I'd just like to mention something if
 he's reading this (and I know he is): I have recently been in touch 
with a very high source at Columbia, who has confirmed to me exclusively
 that Bruce Springsteen's latest album will be out shortly. Although I 
have yet to hear the LP, I would like to go on re-cord right now as 
having this to say about it: "I've seen Bruce Springsteen's future... 
and his middle name is rock 'n' roll!"<br>
<br>
Eat your hearts out, all you runners-up.<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: Darkness On The Edge Of Town<br>
<br>
Paul Rambali, NME, 10 June 1978<br>
<br>
So where you been, Bruce?<br>
<br>
POOR OLD Bruce Springsteen. Through no particular fault of his own, he 
finds he has more to live down than most musicians ever have to live up 
to. That doesn't mean he hasn't got an awful lot to live up to as well; 
it merely emphasises his prickly position.<br>
<br>
Springsteen, you may remember, is no stranger to the bloated claims of 
shortsighted critics and short-term loan publicity machines. After a 
good, if somewhat patchy and sometimes indulgent first album and then a 
steadily maturing second effort, he was unlucky enough to be proclaimed 
the New Bob Dylan, class of '73. John Prine held the title in '72, and 
Elliot Murphy won it in '74 – everybody ignored them too.<br>
<br>
Then, in the winter of '75, came Born To Run. The New Jersey Devil's 
backstreet romance scenario was given full reign. Then, after the hype, 
came the backlash. It manifested itself in an almost universal and to my
 mind undeserved thumbs down for his debut British gigs. It became cool 
to be unmoved by Born To Run – to actively hate it would have given the 
game away.<br>
<br>
All of which served to obscure the true nature of things. Born To Run 
was a good album – certainly fresher and more exciting than much of what
 was around at the time – but not without its faults. The fanciful 
imagery was prone to excess (like spreading half a jar of peanut butter 
on a slice of bread) and the canyon-like production didn't help (adding 
half a jar of jam too).<br>
<br>
Since then Springsteen has had lengthy legal squabbles freeing himself 
from his former managers, instinctively dodged any press encounters, 
taken to performing mostly old R&amp;B songs for fear of bootleggers 
getting hold of his new material, written songs for Southside Johnny, 
Patti Smith and Robert Gordon, and recorded a new album over a period of
 nine months. Promotion this time is distinctly low profile. The budget 
has been limited by his order, and no words of hyperbole adorn the ads –
 just 'Bruce Springsteen, his new album'.<br>
<br>
And in the mighty opening rush of ‘Badlands’ you feel – if nothing else –
 it's good to have him back. The first South side cadence; the cavernous
 guitar sound; Clarence Clemons' rasping sax solo; the chord changes: 
it's a rousing textbook Springsteen anthem – as is its counterpart on 
the second side, ‘The Promised Land’. Four lines in and he squares up to
 the events that have overtaken him since the release of Born To Run: 
"I'm caught in a crossfire that I don't even understand".<br>
<br>
The adrenalin level intensifies for ‘Adam Raised A Cain’, a brooding 
slow burner that in tandem with side two's ‘Factory’ reveals an 
enigmatic twist in his lyrical preoccupations. Both songs are about his 
father, whom he romanticizes as someone whose hopes were crushed by the 
system, and whose life coloured the fears and aspirations of his son; 
"You inherit the sins, you inherit the flames".<br>
<br>
In fact, the sombre sad evocation of the working life in ‘Factory’ and 
‘Cain's’ baptism of hellfire emerge as the killer standouts.<br>
<br>
And then there's ‘Candy's Room’, a song about being in love with a whore
 where Springsteen – as with the above pair – momentarily exceeds his 
musical and vocal confines, in this case with an intoxicating circular 
hook and some Bowie-like intonation.<br>
<br>
‘Something In The Night’, ‘Racing In The Streets’, ‘Streets Of Fire’ and
 ‘Darkness On The Edge Of Town’ are standard widescreen vehicles where 
he narrowly escapes self-parody. The songs themselves, though strangely 
subdued and sometimes even Jackson Browne dirge-like, are 
all-too-classic Springsteen from subject matter right down to ‘Be My 
Baby’ backbeat.<br>
<br>
That leaves only ‘Prove It All Night’. It's the direct choice for a 
single and confirms lurking suspicions that ‘Because The Night’ had a 
lot more to do with Bruce Springsteen than Ms Patti Lee Smith.<br>
<br>
So, Darkness On The Edge Of Town walks a fine line between the 
outrageous claims made on Springsteen's behalf and his tendency towards a
 grandiose, epic feel that encouraged those claims in the first place. 
The blockbluster production techniques of Born To Run have been 
studiously avoided, and the conquer-the-world romantic of before sounds 
oddly disillusioned, frustrated even.</div>

<br>
Peter Silverton, Sounds, 10 June 1978<br>
<br>
LET'S START with the obvious. It's impossible to approach this album 
without taking into heavy account the fortunes and misfortunes of this 
Crown Prince of New jersey in these two years past. Any album can be set
 against the background of its own history. Only with this one, that 
history is both better known and more obviously influential.<br>
<br>
Leaving to one side for the moment Springsteen's management probelms you
 can't help but ponder on the results of the time it's taken to record 
these 10 songs. It is nearly three years since Born To Run. If you're to
 believe what you read (or, in my case, write) all these songs were 
re-recorded time after time and they're the final selection of enough 
recordings for at least a double album – ask the Dilators; they were in 
the next studio to Springsteen and they recorded a whole album while he 
was putting the finishing touches to a couple of tracks for this one.<br>
<br>
So you can't help suspecting, even before you hear it, that maybe too 
much has been lavished on this vinyl brainchild. After all, that amount 
of time and money being expended does suggest indecision and 
uncertainty. And he's got the cross round his neck of having to follow 
up an album with the fiery power and consumate panache of Born To Run.<br>
<br>
And, unlike that album which was recorded before Springsteen was 
anything more than just another new Dylan, this one was put together 
under the full glare of mostly ridiculous expectations. Which is, in 
more than one way, the core of both its successes and its failures. And 
further, those successes and failures are often so deeply intertwined as
 to be almost inseparable.<br>
<br>
Basically, Springsteen has grown up. Or more accurately he's got older 
and moved on from the adolescent concerns of his earlier work to the 
trials and tribulations of adulthood. Gone are the two-bit hoodlums, 
would-be hoodlums and sidewalk hustlers down there on E street. Now, the
 action, like those kids has mostly got itself a wife, two kids, a 
mortgage and a midnight shift.<br>
<br>
If, as many of those who should now have said. Stallone's Rocky was the 
beginning of a new dominance in American movies, blue-collar rule, 
Darkness could well turn out to be its rock and roll equivalent. Nearly 
every track on it is Springsteen's vision of life as it's lived by the 
inhabitants of (presumably) the industrial sore that goes under the name
 of New Jersey. In fact, this emphasis on blue collar life is so nearly 
obsessive that a more apt title for the album would have been the key 
chorus of the second track on side two, 'Factory': 'It's the working, 
the working, just the working life'.<br>
<br>
As Springsteen groaned at the end of Lou Reed's 'Street Hassle', 'tramps
 like us, baby we were born to pay', so here it's 'factory takes his 
hearing, factory takes his life'.<br>
<br>
Naturally, it being Springsteen, these visions are just the other side 
of romance. Kind of a 1970's Woody. Guthrie without any sense of humour.
 He's so intense about it all that at times, you can't help wishing 
someone'd give him a horse tranquiliser.<br>
<br>
The other side of that is the intensity is exactly what gives him his 
artistic strength and his individual voice. Unlike his earlier albums, 
there's few shades of emotion here. It's manic depression all the way 
down the line. The screaming, desperate 'up' of the almost martial 
opening track, 'Badlands'. Or the pained contemplativeness of, 'Racing 
In The Street' (which, as well as having a chorus which is a direct and 
deliberate echo of 'Dancing In The Street', features the best set of 
concrete images about cars since Chuck Berry went to jail: 'I got a 69 
Chevy with a 396/Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor').<br>
<br>
Only 'Promised Land', with its Highway 61 organ swirls and harmonica 
combines both excitement and real feeling. And, even then, the 
production is on the way to spoiling it. Over the whole album, the 
production shows the ill effects of too much time. While it's hardly in 
the Queen league, there are several moments where the continual overdubs
 and reconsiderations have meant that potential surges have been spoilt 
because the basic feel has been sacrificed on altar of that one good 
idea.<br>
<br>
However, that makes it sound like a worse album than it actually is. 
Apart from the fact that the kids have grown up and Brucie now knows his
 way round the recording studio a little better, it represents no real 
advance over Born To Run – the songs certainly aren't as good and it 
only has a fraction of the vitality. And yet, that's rather like saying 
Chuck Berry only had one tune. Partly true but also meaningless and 
irrevelent. There's certainly a whole area of music for Springsteen to 
explore on the basis of Born To Run.<br>
<br>
What is wrong though is that he sounds a frightened man, awed by his own
 history. He even looks like a scared rabbit on the back cover photo. 
But there's no denying he's capable of a lot, lot more. Hopefully, this 
album represents a clearing of the decks and now he can come up with the
 real Springsteen comeback album.<br>
<br>
Here's looking at you, Bruce.<br>

<br>
Mitchell Cohen, Creem, September 1978<br>
<br>
If I walk away from this, he thought, I'll be an old man – all ghosts 
and hangovers and mellow recollections. Fuck it, he thought, follow the 
blood. This is the one. This is the one to ride till it crashes.<br>
– Robert Stone, Dog Soldiers<br>
<br>
THIS AIN'T SALVATION. This ain't betrayal. Darkness On The Edge Of Town 
is an artful, passionate, rigorous record that walks a slender line 
between defeat and defiance, and if it had considerably more of the 
go-for-broke recklessness that it celebrates, it might have also been a 
great record. But if frustration is its subject – the walled-up 
sensation that pounds at your gut, the daytime monotony that leads to 
nighttime explosion – it's also its essence, its soul. The best of this 
music – ‘Badlands’, ‘Streets Of Fire’ – doesn't just describe the rage, 
it embodies it, and becomes apocalyptic sentimentality, the hero of 
these little dramas like a film noir fugitive (Dane Clark in Moonrise, 
Farley Granger in They Live By Night). Then the album is about as 
powerful as rock 'n' roll gets. As often, however, the songs sound 
mannered, overly solipsistic, and so serious. Doesn't this guy ever get 
in the car just to go get a pack of cigarettes? It's a major production 
every time he turns the ignition key.<br>
<br>
There are no jokes on Darkness On The Edge Of Town – no intentional 
ones, anyway – and Bruce Springsteen really used to be quite the 
rockomic (maybe it was all those months in the studio that squelched his
 sense of humor). ‘For You’, ‘Kitty's Back’, ‘Sandy’, ‘Rosalita’, 
‘Thunder Road’, all have impish one-liners, or musical insolence, or a 
quizzical reading, something to lighten up the proceedings, and I'd 
trade all seven minutes of ‘Racing In The Street’, including Roy 
Bittan's admirable piano work, for one moment of the spontaneity with 
which. Bruce shouts ‘Come on, Wendy!’ like some hoodlum Peter Pan on 
‘Born To Run’. The album seems less populated than his others, less 
vividly atmospheric, and the emphasis on father-son conflict and 
Catholic checks-and-balances make Springsteen too much a James Dean 
character as seen by Martin Scorsese. In other words, the LP isn't much 
fun. On stage he mixes up his mythic masculinity with the pure, slightly
 intimidated love/lust of ‘A Fine Fine Girl’ and ‘Pretty Flamingo’ and 
partytime rousers like ‘Quarter To Three’ and ‘You Can't Sit Down’, so 
the question is why he doesn't put those moods, if not those songs, on 
disc.<br>
<br>
("Aw, ‘fess up," says the voice of emotion, overruling, the voice of 
reason. "When The Girl wheeled out of the room, blasting you away, you 
put on 'The Promised Land' for the first time and wept through the rest 
of the side. This is, you gotta admit, moving stuff. Springsteen does 
have that feel for what it's like to drown in disappointment and to want
 something so intensely...")<br>
<br>
Well; yeah. These are very sensitive buttons he's pushing, calling on a 
twister to "Blow away the dreams that tear you apart/Blow away the 
dreams that break your, heart." When he sings "Honey, I want the heart, I
 want the soul/I want control right now," or bitterly puts his life on 
the line on the title track, or mines his durable 
grab-the-girl-and-split story into an infectious piece of machinery 
called ‘Prove It All Night’, Springsteen is at the top of his game, 
taking wild swings and connecting. He has his themes, his environment 
(there is no sunlight at all on the record; even the venetian blinds are
 closed on the cover), his buzz words, but so long as he eventually 
remembers that someday this will all seem funny, he doesn't need to 
break new ground.<br>
<br>
Sometimes it's the arrangement that does in the material, flattening the
 melody and wasting a good lyric, as on ‘Something In The Night’; 
sometimes the track is doomed from the moment of conception (‘Factory’ 
tries to pass off workaday cliches as insight). And sometimes all it 
takes is an urgent Springsteen vocal or guitar solo, Clarence Clemons' 
swaggering sax, or the combination of Max Weinberg's pulsative drumming 
and a romantic image ("I go driving deep into the light in Candy's 
eyes") to pull a surprise success out of clutter. Somehow Darkness On 
The Edge Of Town works, through cumulative impact, variations on 
repetition, the sudden sizzling effect, and it's an achievement when an 
album so self-absorbed, claustrophobic and didactic can still be filled 
with blood and hope.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is definitely out there on the wire, keeping his footing, 
making a few breathtaking daredevil moves. Shit, I don't know. Right 
now, in the middle of a heartbreak, Darkness sounds like the record it's
 supposed to be: a tough, exhaust-fumed hymn to feverish desire, a 
dissection of internal wounds that can be healed not by compromise but 
by conquest. Bruce Springsteen matters because he knows there is a 
vision worth pursuing: to find the dark glow of possibility in a 
beautiful woman's eyes, seize it, and run like hell as far as it will 
take you. Put your foot to the floor and, darling, don't look back.<br>
