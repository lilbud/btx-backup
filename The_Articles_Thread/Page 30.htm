<strong class="text-strong">WHY SHOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN?</strong><br>
<br>
It's a fair question as we prepare for an all but sold-out 10-date visit
 by Springsteen and his E Street Band, as part of a 133-show (and 2012's
 second-highest grossing) world tour that has critics and fans of a 
certain age gushing.<br>
<br>
Sure, he played at Barack Obama's presidential inauguration. Yes, he's 
been quoted, misquoted, criticised and eulogised by politicians of all 
stripes, from Ronald Reagan to Wayne Swan. True, he was one of the 
biggest stars of the 1980s - the last time the music industry ruled the 
entertainment world. And he certainly has inspired imitation, from Bon 
Jovi to Arcade Fire, from Meatloaf to Moving Pictures, from Badly Drawn 
Boy to the Gaslight Anthem.<br>
<br>
But he's in his 60s, has only toured here three times in his 
near-50-year career and is the quintessential American artist. How could
 he possibly mean anything to us?<br>
<br>
Advertisement<br>
Well, here are the reasons why New Jersey's second-most famous son is worth talking about (and you need a ticket).<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">HE CARES AND FIGURES YOU WILL, TOO</strong><br>
<br>
Earlier this year, Springsteen was named the MusiCares Person of the 
Year for his efforts on gay rights, equal rights, migrant workers, 
support for labour, Barack Obama and just simply giving a toss about 
your fellow humans.<br>
<br>
He also cares passionately about making music and what music can do for 
you, as a musician or a listener. As he explained in his keynote speech 
at the South by Southwest music conference last year, you can put that 
down to seeing Elvis Presley on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1956 and 
thinking ''a white man could make magic''. ''You did not have to be 
constrained by your upbringing, by the way you looked, or by the social 
context that oppressed you,'' he said. ''You could call upon your own 
powers of imagination, and you could create a transformative self.''<br>
<br>
Transformation, the search for it or the failure of it, is at the core 
of his songs and may be why people and locations rooted so completely in
 the American life translate in nations, and languages, far from it.<br>
<br>
As writer and fan David James Young puts it, in Springsteen songs, ''the
 names may have changed, and a few steps may have been taken back in 
order to take in the bigger picture; but the sentiments seem to have 
remained intact. Small-town stories of heroes, villains, 
could-a-been-champions, parents, friends and lovers … find themselves 
attempting to escape their community or dealing with the consequences of
 not getting out while they could.'' In other words, stories from pretty
 much everywhere.<br>
<br>
In his book 31 Songs, English author and occasional songwriter, Nick 
Hornby, talked about how the song Thunder Road ''somehow manages to 
speak to me'' even though Hornby is not American, young, into cars or 
ignorant of the fact some see Springsteen as bombastic and histrionic.<br>
<br>
''Sometimes songs and books and films and pictures express who you are, 
perfectly. And they don't do this in words or images, necessarily; the 
connection is a lot less direct and more complicated than that,'' Hornby
 writes. ''It's a process something like falling in love. You don't 
necessarily choose the best person, or the wisest, or the most 
beautiful; there's something else going on.''<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">OTHER ARTISTS LOVE SINGING HIS SONGS</strong><br>
<br>
David Bowie gave It's Hard To Be a Saint in the City a glam makeover 
while New York Afro-beat chaps Vampire Weekend made with the pretty for 
I'm Going Down. Outre '80s pop glossies Frankie Goes to Hollywood 
assayed Born to Run faithfully while post-rock nerds Tortoise joined 
indie oddball Bonnie ''Prince'' Billy to make Thunder Road prog 
rock-like.<br>
<br>
Pop duo-turned-dancefloor group Everything but the Girl and jangly 
sensitive Scots Camera Obscura both covered Tougher than the Rest. 
Spectral pop act Bat for Lashes sang I'm On Fire spectrally and 
agit-rockers Rage against the Machine heavied The Ghost of Tom Joad into
 a quasi-metal crunch.<br>
<br>
Emmylou Harris went country on Racing in the Streets and Mansion on the 
Hill and Johnny Cash did something similar with I'm On Fire and Johnny 
99. Soul sister Bettye LaVette brought extra grit to Streets of 
Philadelphia, and Dion recorded a doo-wop version of If I Should Fall 
Behind, a song also recorded by the Go-Betweens' Grant McLennan.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
OTHER ARTISTS HAVE HAD HITS WITH HIS SONGS, EVEN WHEN HE DIDN'T</strong><br>
<br>
Blinded by the Light bombed in 1973 as the first single from 
Springsteen's debut album, Greetings from Asbury Park N.J., but became a
 No.1 song in 1976 for English band Manfred Mann's Earth Band. Because 
the Night was a cast-off from the long sessions for what would become 
1978's Darkness on the Edge of Town; Patti Smith added a verse and some 
magic and the song became her biggest hit.<br>
<br>
Fire was another song from the Darkness on the Edge of Town sessions 
that manager Jon Landau feared would be released as a non-representative
 single by the label because of its obvious hit potential. So obvious 
that the Pointer Sisters' version went to No.2.<br>
<br>
Having promised Donna Summer, but then keeping, Cover Me (which became a
 top 10 hit from 1984's Born in the USA), Springsteen gave her 
Protection, earning her a Grammy nomination.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
NO QUICK SHOWS</strong><br>
<br>
The man may be 63, but when he's got the E Street Band he doesn't play 
sitting down, he doesn't play quietly and he doesn't play short. Typical
 shows in the '70s went for three hours or more. Typical shows on recent
 tours have been going for three hours or more. The Helsinki show of 
July 31, 2012, went for four hours and six minutes, the longest he's 
ever done.<br>
<br>
Guitarist Steve van Zandt, who won't be on the Australian leg, told 
Rolling Stone a year ago that the band didn't look at the clock or think
 about how long the show was going because they, and the audience, are 
being transported. ''You're taken out of time during the show and 
brought to some other place, and then returned at the end of the 
journey, hopefully with positive energy that you then take into your 
regular life,'' van Zandt said. All of which might be tiresome if he 
wasn't the master of stadium rock shows, boasting a set-list of songs 
seemingly built to be sung by thousands.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
IT'S A BIG BAND THIS TIME, BUT SOME FAMILIAR FACES WILL BE MISSING</strong><br>
<br>
Formed in 1972, the group was formally named the E Street Band in 1974 
and, save for a decade's hiatus from the mid-'80s, were the constant 
part of a Springsteen show. Sax player Clarence Clemons, organist Danny 
Federici and bassist Garry Tallent were founding members who remained by
 Springsteen's side into the 21st century. The core of eight musicians 
behind him, which was established in 1995 when long-time 
foil/guitarist/consigliore van Zandt rejoined the band alongside his 
replacement Nils Lofgren, has been augmented at different times but 
never as much as now. On this current tour, there are 19 musicians on 
stage including brass, fiddle and backing vocalists alongside stalwarts 
Tallent, backing vocalist Patti Scialfa, drummer Max Weinberg and 
decade-old ''newbie'' violinist Soozie Tyrell.<br>
<br>
However, the E Street Band is not the same and will never be the same 
again. Federici died in 2008 (replaced by Charles Giordano), Clarence 
''The Big Man'' Clemons died in 2011 (replaced in part by his nephew 
Jake) and van Zandt will miss the Australian tour because of commitments
 with his radio show (replaced by Tom Morello).<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
HE STILL PULLS A CROWD</strong><br>
<br>
Though the last Australian tour in 2003 was a disaster for the promoter,
 who overestimated and picked the wrong venues, and a fizzer for many 
fans in Sydney in particular who got lumbered with awful sound, 
Springsteen's 2013 tour looks like a safe return. The two Brisbane shows
 have sold out, the first two Melbourne shows and first Sydney have, 
too, as have the two shows at Hanging Rock in country Victoria.<br>
<br>
Of course, we're small beer compared with the US and European legs of 
the tours. According to Billboard magazine, the 2007-2008 tour grossed 
more than $235 million from 104 shows; the 2002-2003 tour grossed more 
than $221 million from 120 shows. The current tour, which began in March
 last year and was Billboard's second-highest grossing tour of 2012 
(behind Madonna), has clocked up 90 shows before the 10 Australian 
concerts with another 33 to go before the final show in Rio de Janeiro 
in September.<br>

By STEPHEN HOLDEN<br>
Published: August 09, 1992<br>
The New York Times<br>
<br>
Last year, shortly before marrying his former backup singer Patti 
Scialfa, Bruce Springsteen was seized with an intense creative fever.<br>
<br>
"It was nine months after my son was born," he recalled recently. "I was
 a father, and I had a real relationship with Patti, which was something
 that had evaded me for a long time. I'd just finished the album 'Human 
Touch,' but it felt unfinished."<br>
<br>
Working with an acoustic guitar and a drum machine, Mr. Springsteen 
wrote "Living Proof," a majestic rock ballad. A centerpiece of both his 
live show and new album "Lucky Town," it portrays fatherhood as a 
transcendent deliverance from a prolonged period of self-doubt and 
unhappiness.<br>
<br>
"I crawled deep into some kind of darkness/ Lookin' to burn out every 
trace of who I'd been," sings the narrator, who remembers his 
predomestic life as a prison with "no keys no guards/ Just one 
frightened man and some old shadows for bars." With the birth of his 
son, he finds salvation.<br>
<br>
<br>
" 'Living Proof' was the key unlocking the door into the next room, 
where a lot of songs were waiting," Mr. Springsteen continued. "I wrote 
one a night over the next three weeks, and they became 'Lucky Town.' The
 songs deal with a lot of the same spiritual issues that were in 'Born 
to Run.' "<br>
<br>
Lounging on a couch in his spacious dressing room at the Brendan Byrne 
Arena in New Jersey, before a concert in his sold-out 11-show 
engagement, which ends tomorrow, Mr. Springsteen reflected on what he 
said was "the single biggest transition of my life." A painful journey 
from what he called "the mythic world into the real world," it drove him
 to seek therapy 10 years ago. He has been in and out ever since.<br>
<br>
During the conversation, Mr. Springsteen shrugged off what some have 
perceived as an impending career crisis. After the albums "Human Touch" 
and "Lucky Town" were released by Columbia Records in April, the singer,
 whom critics had once treated as sacrosanct, received a few rare 
snipes. The reviews for both albums, though mostly favorable, were not 
as glowing as those for previous Springsteen records. There were also 
suggestions that the Boss, now a family man, 42 years old and wealthy to
 boot (with a $13 million house in Beverly Hills and another home in 
Rumson, N.J.), had gotten too comfortable and fallen out of touch with 
his Jersey Shore roots.<br>
<br>
The records, which respectively entered Billboard's pop album chart at 
No. 2 and No. 3, were beaten out by Def Leppard's "Adrenalize." When 
they quickly fell to the lower reaches of the chart, Entertainment 
Weekly ran a cover story that asked, "What Ever Happened to Bruce?"<br>
<br>
"In the mythic world, real things get in the way," Mr. Springsteen said,
 speaking in a quiet, husky voice while sipping tea and mineral water. 
"Real people get in the way. Or a real woman. Some people will just be 
upset by your real life and by the real choices you make because they 
get in the way of the dream."<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen has countered his critics with doses of humor. In the 
opening concert in New Jersey, he invited his audience to boo his move 
to Beverly Hills. "I can take it," he joked. The notion that Mr. 
Springsteen has in some way sold out is contradicted by his longtime 
friend and former E Street bandmate, (Miami) Steve Van Zandt (now known 
as Little Steven), who helped him remix his current single, "57 Channels
 (and Nothin' On)," from the "Human Touch" album.<br>
<br>
"Bruce is an adult with a wife and kids," he said, "and I think he'd 
have the same life style whatever town he chose to live in. I don't 
think living in California or in New Jersey has much to do with 
anything."<br>
<br>
Trim, with no trace of gray in his hair and a face full of stubble that 
thickens into a beard, Mr. Springsteen looks considerably younger than 
his years. If he is now a father of two children (his son, Evan James, 
born in July 1990, was followed last December by a daughter, Jessica 
Rae), the aura of a rock-and-roll gypsy still clings to him. Triple-loop
 silver earrings adorn both ears. He wears a large silver cross around 
his neck, a loose-fitting open shirt, cuffed blue jeans and 
weather-beaten black motorcycle boots with metal tips.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen, who gives few interviews, takes answering questions 
seriously. He speaks slowly and deliberately, often pausing to gather 
his thoughts and making only fleeting eye contact. There is a brooding 
quality in his deep-set eyes, but it is offset by a generous grin and 
frequent eruptions of slightly nervous laughter, which carries a note of
 self-deprecation. He seems intent on projecting the conviction that, 
despite his fame, he is an ordinary person who has done well because he 
happens to be good at one thing.<br>
<br>
During the interview, he always referred to his musical career as "my 
job"; to him, that job comes down to communication. "I've always 
believed that people listen to your music not to find out about you," he
 said, "but to find out about themselves."<br>
<br>
In describing his own personal odyssey, Mr. Springsteen unabashedly 
compared it with sea changes in the national consciousness. The myth 
that fueled his early music, and that ultimately became a burden, can be
 traced to American pop culture itself.<br>
<br>
"As a child, I felt the myth coming from everywhere, especially from 
television westerns with those big landscapes," he said. "In rock music 
it was Chuck Berry, the cars, the guitars, the girls, the sense of 
endless highway and endless night and sexual power. I believe it was 
something that everybody felt, and, of course, it was a romanticized 
view. It lasted until the 60's. Then in the 70's people really began to 
feel that there wasn't going to be enough for everybody."<br>
<br>
For Bruce Springsteen, maturing has involved "sorting out the images of 
manhood that are thrown at you in a little town in New Jersey," he said.
 "There was the car thing. I wasn't what you would call a car freak, as 
far as building them goes, but I was taken with the image."<br>
<br>
"Born to Run," the 1975 album that made him a star, codifies the myth of
 a rebellious young dreamer charging down the American highway in a 
quest for adventure. But barely seven years after its release, the 
singer took a cross-country trip during which his fantasies of leading 
an eternal rock-and-roll caravan came to an end.<br>
<br>
"I was 32, and I wasn't a kid anymore," he said. "At the same time I 
wasn't attached and didn't have a home life. For a couple of thousand 
dollars I bought a car and drove it across the country with a friend 
from North Jersey who ran a motorcycle shop. One day in the South we 
stopped by a river bank where some band whose name I forget was playing.
 I walked around the crowd and felt vey detached and far away. I had 
that sinking feeling that something had gone fundamentally wrong."<br>
<br>
Throughout the rest of the trip, he said, "I experienced a lot of bad 
feelings. It was an empty, floating feeling, like I had gotten lost. We 
finally got to California where I had a small house. And when we walked 
in, I couldn't sit down. I realized that the only thing I wanted to do 
was to get back in the car and go back the other way. And when I got 
home toNew Jersey, I knew I wouldn't want to stay there either."<br>
<br>
That fall of 1982, Mr. Springsteen said, was when "I found a doctor and started to talk to him."<br>
<br>
Since then, his life has been something of an emotional roller coaster, 
"finding some stuff out," as he puts it, "and then running away."<br>
<br>
One exhilarating compensation was the Brucemania that accompanied the 
overwhelming success of his 1984 album "Born in the U.S.A." The record 
sold 21 million copies worldwide, 11 million of them in the United 
States, and made him a pop megastar surpassed by only Michael Jackson.<br>
<br>
The album's cover image of Mr. Springsteen as a working-class hero with 
bulging biceps and tight jeans made him such an appealing icon of 
American machismo that both political parties angled for an endorsement 
in that year's Presidential election. He did not back anyone.<br>
<br>
When asked whom he would support this year, he hedged. "I don't come out
 and promote politicians," he said. "But I'm not voting for Bush. The 
last time I voted was in '72, for McGovern. This year I am going to 
vote."<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen played the role of the working-class hero for a while, 
but "it's not the way I grew up," he admitted. "I wasn't one of the guys
 or anything like that. I was a quiet, keep-to-myself kind of kid, and 
in a certain sense I was fragile. But during the 'Born in the U.S.A.' 
period I was doing a lot of physical things and exercising. I still do 
it, but in a more balanced sort of way."<br>
<br>
In 1987, he released "Tunnel of Love," a compelling chronicle of the ups
 and downs of a troubled relationship not unlike his with Julianne 
Phillips, an actress and model whom he married in 1985. He insists, 
however, that the songs were not strictly autobiographical.<br>
<br>
After the couple divorced in 1989, Mr. Springsteen married Ms. Scialfa, a
 willowy, redheaded singer and guitarist who had sung backup on his 1988
 "Tunnel of Love" tour with the E Street Band. Mr. Springsteen also 
separated from his longtime musical cohorts; only one member of the 
original E Street Band, the keyboardist Roy Bittan, plays with his 
current band. Although some fans saw the breakup as Mr. Springsteen's 
rejection of his roots, Mr. Van Zandt, who left the E Street Band in 
1983, was supportive.<br>
<br>
"He had been doing one thing for a long time, and he wanted to try 
something new," he said. "I don't think it's anything more dramatic than
 that."<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen has shown a deep streak of caution when it comes to 
tampering with his music or drawing on other art forms. Talking about 
literature that has impressed him, he cites the Canadian poet Leonard 
Cohen's album "I'm Your Man," but he is unfamiliar with Robert Bly's 
"Iron John."<br>
<br>
"I like to read, but I don't do it, and it's one of the worst things I don't do," he lamented.<br>
<br>
Although he is more in touch with movies than with books, he has no 
plans to be in one. With his New Jersey accent and the aura he wears of 
the rebel hood with the heart of gold -- Mr. Springsteen would seem an 
ideal choice to play one of Martin Scorsese's urban street characters or
 one of Sam Shepard's loners. In fact, his videos have revealed a 
telegenic star quality that is unconnected to music. But he claims that 
that kind of stardom holds little allure. "My experience with video has 
been that film is complicated and you have less control," he said. "It 
would be a very new form for me, when I feel I haven't gotten near to 
exhausting the one I'm in."<br>
<br>
The contemporary film that has left the deepest impression on him is Wim
 Wenders's "Wings of Desire," whose story he feels parallels many of his
 own concerns.<br>
<br>
"It's about an angel who gives up his wings to experience mortality," he
 explained. "To experience love and beauty, he has to accept 
temporalness. These are some of same issues I've tried to get at on my 
new records. I think one of the issues that is facing not only 
individuals but the whole country is that things are finite."<br>
<br>
The creative dry spell that coincided with Mr. Springsteen's personal 
tumult ended when he began writing the songs for "Human Touch," a 
turbulent album that took more than a year to record, beginning in 
January 1990. But when it was completed, he decided to delay its release
 until the second album, "Lucky Town," was complete.<br>
<br>
"I still felt I was dancing all around things I really wanted to say but
 didn't quite know how," he said. "For me, 'Lucky Town' was more 
emotionally realized."<br>
<br>
Both of his new albums almost totally ignore the electronic innovations 
that have colored much of 90's pop, though he is a fan of some new pop 
music. "For me, rap is the stuff that gets closest to the vitality of 
50's rock-and-roll. It's the rawest, most direct kind of in-your-face, 
bursting-off-the-street sound." He remembers watching Public Enemy on 
television recently. "When they came on, they felt like what I imagined 
Dylan must have felt like in the 60's, real timely and comedic and 
darkly funny, with a tremendous sense of energy."<br>
<br>
He's only vaguely familiar with Billy Ray Cyrus, the country star whose 
voice reminds some of Mr. Springsteen's. "It's real healthy right now 
out there," he said, adding that Guns 'n' Roses, Metallica and Nirvana 
are "really good bands who have something to say and who really mean 
something in their fans' lives."<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen sees his own albums as soul-and-blues-influenced ("Human
 Touch") and part of the folk-rock tradition ("Lucky Town"). Said Jon 
Landau, Mr. Springsteen's manager and co-producer: "Bruce's 
preoccupation is, above all, his writing. If the song is right, that's 
80 percent of it for him. In our approach to production you won't find 
much that gets in the way of the song." In fact, "Lucky Town," on which 
Mr. Springsteen played most of the instruments, sounds like the homemade
 album that it is. Though one of Mr. Springsteen's most brilliant 
collections of songs, it lacks the commercial sheen that might have made
 its catchiest songs radio-ready hits.<br>
<br>
With the onset of the tour, which is expected to continue through North 
America into 1993, sales of Mr. Springsteen's two albums have begun to 
pick up. In the New York market, after only two concerts, both albums 
saw an increase of more than 80 percent in sales from the previous week.
 In the United States, "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town" have sold, 
respectively, 1.7 million and 1.6 million copies. Together, that is more
 than "Tunnel of Love." Overseas sales for the two new albums are well 
over four million.<br>
<br>
The New Jersey concerts, which draw heavily on material from the two 
albums, open with three songs from "Lucky Town" and close with 
back-to-back renditions of "Born to Run" and "My Beautiful Reward," the 
tender, searching ballad that closes "Lucky Town." Mr. Springsteen said 
he sees the two songs, and their albums, as bookends.<br>
<br>
"In 1974, I was a 24-year-old sitting on my bed in Long Branch, N.J., 
saying, 'Hey, I want to know if love is real,' " he said. "If you listen
 to 'Born to Run,' that's the question the song asks. If you've followed
 my characters over the years, you could see them struggling and failing
 and losing each other and finding each other again, and losing 
themselves and finding themselves i pursuit of some sort of answer to 
that question. I felt that if you had followed my characters all the way
 back to 'Born to Run,' 'Lucky Town' was the place where they were 
going."</div>

Bruce Springsteen – Racing in the Street<br>
Bruce Springsteen knows rock'n'roll tells us lies – he loves the falsehoods, but he wants us to know the truth, too<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
When I was 19, I thought Paddy McAloon had been so clever. He had 
watched Bruce Springsteen's kingdom become an empire through the mid-80s
 and responded with with an acerbic little song critiquing Springsteen's
 lyrical preoccupations. "Look at us now, quit driving," he sang on what
 became a hit single for Prefab Sprout, "some things hurt more, much 
more than cars and girls." Yeah! You showed him! That big, bloated 
American with his will to rock power and his trite tunes about good ol' 
boys in Cadillacs.<br>
<br>
As you may have guessed, I didn't actually know very much about 
Springsteen. If I did, I'd have realised that he, more than anyone, 
knows some things hurt more, much more than cars and girls. Those 
cars-and-girls songs we were pointing and laughing at? Most of them 
weren't really about cars and girls. Even Racing in the Street, a song 
that talks explicitly and in great detail about cars, and about meeting a
 girl in a car, isn't about cars and girls. Even Racing in the Street? 
Especially Racing in the Street.<br>
<br>
One of rock's commonest tricks is to pair triumphalist music with 
despairing lyrics. As it opens, Racing in the Street reverses that: it 
is sombrely paced, Roy Bittan's piano picking out a phrase adapted from 
the Crystals' Then He Kissed Me. That melody is dropped and Springsteen 
enters, telling us about his "69 Chevy with a 396/ Fuelie heads and a 
Hurst on the floor". Read the lyrics to the first verse on the page, and
 you'd swear they're from one of the Beach Boys' hot rod albums – 
there's no ambivalence or ambiguity here, and certainly not in the 
chorus: "Tonight, tonight the strip's just right/ I wanna blow 'em off 
in my first heat/ Summer's here and the time is right/ For goin' racin' 
in the street."<br>
<br>
But it's not a celebration. We know this from the music. And we wonder: 
why has he lifted a melody from the Crystals? Why does the title crib 
from Martha Reeves and the Vandellas? Why has Springsteen taken these 
anthems of youthful joy and turned them into laments?<br>
<br>
Racing in the Street, I think, is about a self being torn apart. Our 
narrator's at the age where he has seen his friends put their cars in 
the garage, forget their past, and – in his eyes – forget who they are. 
These are the guys who "just give up living/ And start dying little by 
little, piece by piece." So why is he conflicted? Because he's also at 
the age where he's coming to realise that maybe there's more to life 
than cars. That's why we've got those musical steals: they are the songs
 of his youth, the songs before there was doubt. The songs from when 
racing in the street seemed like a worthy life ambition.<br>
<br>
And so, in the third verse – think of it more like a film: this is the 
third act – he meets a girl (and isn't it telling he encounters her "in a
 Camaro with this dude from LA"? The car, not the boyfriend, is what he 
notices first). He races the Camaro, he wins, and then he "drove that 
little girl away".<br>
<br>
And here the perspective shifts: our narrator stops telling us about his
 car, and we learn about the consequences of investing your hope in your
 youthful dreams. Because the girl has been driven away in both senses –
 his fecklessness, his insistence on defining himself through his own 
desires leaves no room for the compromise that is necessary in an adult 
life. Just three years after the couple met, "she stares off alone into 
the night/ With the eyes of one who hates for just being born."<br>
<br>
What Springsteen understands more than any other artist I can think of 
is that the transcendence of great rock'n'roll comes from it being built
 on lies. Rock'n'roll almost never tells you the truth: from Elvis to 
Oasis it has insisted you can live the moment; it writes the listener 
cheques that real life can't cash. We're gonna live forever, we're gonna
 party til we puke, we'll revel in girls, girls, girls. That is not real
 life, and Springsteen doesn't want to pretend it is, even if he thrills
 to the idea of it.<br>
<br>
And so we get this – forgive the pretension – dialectic. Springsteen 
wants us to celebrate, he wants us to have that moment of transcendence.
 On stage he works tirelessly, hamming it up shamelessly, cajoling the 
audience to that point where we embrace the deception – where for that 
moment all our worries and fears are forgotten – and we can be heroes, 
just for three hours. But all the time he is reminding us of what lies 
outside, and so – as another song puts it – "we'll keep pushin' till 
it's understood/ and these badlands start treating us good." (I think 
the most telling exploration of this chasm at the heart of Springsteen's
 music is heard on bootlegs of his 1978 tour, where he would often open 
with an old rock'n'roll cover – Oh Boy!, Rave On, Summertime Blues, Good
 Rockin' Tonight – and then pile straight into Badlands. He told the 
lie, then he lifted back the veil and exposed the lie.)<br>
<br>
Springsteen's music resonates so powerfully for me because it enables me
 to be in two places at once: to be both the kid dancing and shouting 
and drinking and singing, and to be the adult worried how his kids will 
fare, whether there'll still be a job this time next year, whether I'm 
being fair to my wife about this and that. I don't think there's anyone 
else who tells us that both these experiences are not just valid, but 
vital. Embrace contradiction, Springsteen tells us, it's what makes us 
who we are.<br>
<br>
And back to the song, where the contradiction is indeed embraced. It 
ends with man and woman together, somehow. "Tonight my baby and me, 
we're gonna ride to the sea/ And wash these sins off our hands." One 
more chorus, and we enter a coda that washes up again and again, like 
that sea, unending, fading slowly, letting us know there was no 
cataclysm, that there is hope, somewhere, no matter how hard it might 
seem to believe that.</div>

<br>
THE COMPLETE 1995 INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT<br>
<br>
<br>
“BY REQUEST”  (to quote a phrase)  - This the  only known transcript of 
the complete interview of Bruce Springsteen by  the Australian music 
journalist Ian Meldrum at Sony Studios in  New York City  on April 7, 
1995.  Ian broke every rule in the book  in conducting this interview 
but Bruce quickly realized three important things-<br>
<br>
1-	Ian was knowledgeable; <br>
2-	he was polite; and <br>
3-	he obviously liked Bruce’s music. <br>
<br>
<br>
What happened next was quite  possibly the best interview Bruce has ever
 given. It has been –by far – the most requested interview/ article on 
this thread and so, sit back and read on !   </strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Q- Well first of all, I’ve gotta congratulate you on the other night, 
here in this building, I guess, somewhere - to have a private concert 
for about 300-400 people. What was it like being back with the E Street 
Band ?<br>
<br>
A-	It was great. We played a couple of gigs about a month ago in a 
little bar here in New York in the course of shooting the video and it 
was interesting because the imprint of all  the music we have played 
together is actually right at your fingertips but you think you don’t 
remember but you count off the song and get into it and it just comes 
back. But it was really interesting because we have’nt had the 
experience of playing together for years and its such a complex group of
 people with our history together being so deep at this point. We were 
just kids when we started  and now everyone has grown into men and women
 so there is this long emotional history  and then the separation so 
there was a lot of things we were carrying around on stage. It still 
feels as if I am able to do something with that particular group of 
people that I am not able to do on my own. They broaden my musical 
perspective sometimes just by being there.  So its about a lot of that 
history together. I will look over there and see the guy I was with when
 I was twenty and I knew him when he got divorced or had babies or had 
his problems. The music is really a map of our lives and being back on 
stage ne if the nicest things is that everyone really liked one another !
 <br>
<br>
Q-  It was really quite funny being in the audience because it was like 
watching a next door neighbour that you have seen growing up getting 
together and it was almost like peering through the window and seeing 
them have a good time again.<br>
<br>
A-	I think that demonstrates the importance of the band being a tangible
 bridge between my work and my audience. They were a physical 
manifestation of the community that that was all about and they brought 
my work in a very particular way and over the years the E Street Band 
became very deeply symbolic-and this  feeling was partly intentional and
 it was probably also caused by the time we had spent together as the 
presence of the band became very important and symbolic for my audience 
and for me also. When we play together there is a certain world that 
does get created and I think that people do think like you have just 
expressed. The audience recognizes somebody up there and maybe they  
have a comparison with some experience in their own lives, maybe about 
the way you feel about this or that friend. The E Street band are the 
physical evidence of the community that I wrote about.  Being musicians 
we travelled around a lot and we were young and away from our parents a 
lot and the community that I dreamed about in my songs are represented 
by the E Street band who broaden and explain the scope of my work.<br>
<br>
Q- Even Patti seemed to be looking down like the mother very happy with the children that they were all getting along so fine.<br>
<br>
A-	Well, its just such a complicated situation and the people themselves
 are very unusual and complex people.  Just take Patti and I- we’ve gone
 through so many changes since she got in the band. Originally she just 
got in the band as a singer and now here we are on stage and she is my 
wife and we now have kids together and in some way it makes a certain 
sort of sense. But the other night was different and everyone is older 
but it felt right. I look 10-15 years down the road and I just wish 
everyone would be so lucky as to have such a good group of friends 
around them. The separation has made everything very real again.<br>
<br>
Q-  It must make it stronger I would have thought.<br>
<br>
     A -  Yes. In 1989, I had gotten into a place with the band that I 
just did not know what to do with them or myself. Some of us had spent, 
even then,   twenty years together and I thought I ought to go out and 
see what happens next.  So I called the guys and said that I wanted to 
go out and work with some other musicians. I said that I don’t really 
know whats gonna happen next – who knows ?   It was tough and people 
went through a wide range of emotions about it but we stayed in touch 
over the years so the other night was pretty sweet.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q- Over the years there have been many songs of yours that have touched 
the soul or the heart and the listener will have their own 
interpretation about what the song is about and what it may mean to them
 personally and for me, to see you perform ‘Streets of Philadelphia” 
brought tears to my eyes because it reminded me of friends and people I 
have known etc…I guess you wouldn’t have performed that many times on 
stage ?<br>
<br>
A-	No, only once or twice but it’s a simple song to perform but a good 
one for the band to perform. When I sat down to think about writing for 
the band again it broadened my thoughts into writing into a more social 
area.<br>
<br>
Q- To come up with just 18 tracks for the “Greatest Hits “ album must 
have been hard because I know how you agonize over what songs make it on
 albums.<br>
<br>
<br>
A-	Jon Landau will take the glory or the blame for that one !  What we 
originally tried to do was a singles collection and with the exception 
of Thunder Road, everything else was a single but we still didn’t get 
everything on it. We never got “Blinded By the Light “ on and we never 
had a single on the second album anyway. <br>
<br>
Q- New York City Seranade is a great song.<br>
<br>
A-	Yeah but in those days my chances of getting on to commercial radio 
were next to none. So Jon wrote out a list of songs and with the 
exception of Prove It All Night, I think they all went on. But we knew 
that it would be a no win situation because everyone wants their 
favourites on. I wanted “Frankie” on it but it never happened. But I 
guess I wanted I record that young fans could go into the store and buy 
and get a taste of all the work that we have done over the past twenty 
years and learn a little bit about the band and get a feeling for some 
of the music without having to go back and get all the albums.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">NOW- AT THIS TWELVE MINUTE MARK OF THE 
INTERVIEW, THIS SEEMED LIKE THE USUAL TIME TO WIND THINGS UP  -BRUCE HAD
 COVERED THE REUNION AND HAD PROMOTED THE ALBUM….BELIEVE IT OR NOT, 
ABOUT 12 MINUTES OF TALK MIXED WITH FILM CLIPS CAN CREATE A ONE HR TV 
DOCUMENTARY…. <br>
<br>
-BUT AT THIS POINT MOLLY THREW HIS HAIL MARY……….</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Q- I wonder if we could just look at the album track by track ?<br>
<br>
A-	Sure    <br>
<br>
Q- The first track is of course, “Born To Run” from the 1975 album of 
the same name and over the years, so much as been written about this 
song and album that I guess that at times you must have hated recording 
that album ?<br>
<br>
A –Yeah, I was really young and insecure. One day I thought I was the 
greatest and the next day I thought I was worthless.  My emotions were 
all over the place. Before I made “Greetings” I had never met anybody 
who had ever made an album so after that and after the Wild and the 
Innocent” which both only had very modest success, there was a lot of 
pressure on me during the Born To Run sessions. This wasn’t helped 
because I was trying to create something really special. I wasn’t a 
revolutionary like Bob Dylan or Elvis but I was synthesizing a lot of 
different elements and trying to pull together things that I wanted to 
get on my record along with the exhilaration of some of my own favourite
 rock and roll records.  I wanted it to be physical but I wanted it to 
have some sort of intellect also and I was trying to get everything that
 I ever knew or heard of on to one record. I didn’t know if this was 
going be my last shot because I had a three album deal and this was my 
third album and I didn’t know if I would ever make another album again 
so I wanted to make that album really count. So in some way, when that 
album pushes you to go over the top that’s because of the desperation 
behind it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q- When you are writing do you take parts of different songs and combine
 them into a single song. Because “Born To Tun” itself seemed to have 
parts of “the Violent Ones” in it.<br>
<br>
A-	Really ?  Who did that ?<br>
<br>
<br>
Q- You did.<br>
<br>
A-	Really ? You’re kidding me !  I don’t remember it but I would like to
 hear it because it’s a good title.  But…..really  was it on a bootleg ?<br>
<br>
Q- Yeah, a 1972-75 one and that song seemed to have parts of “Born To Run”  on it.<br>
<br>
A-	Really ?  I don’t remember that I usually remember the titles….<br>
<br>
Q- Or “Wild Angels” it was called at one time ?<br>
<br>
A-	Yeah, probably it did metamorphose  out of something else because for
 example, “Thunder Road” was twice as long at one point and I know there
 are bootlegs of that out there.  Because at the time I was getting 
dogged with “the new Bob Dylan thing “ and I was trying to create my own
 vision.<br>
<br>
Q- You’re a great Dylan fan I’m sure ?<br>
<br>
A-	Oh man, still am, still am.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q- Is it true that when your Mom first heard Dylan she said,  “He can’t sing ! “<br>
<br>
A-	Yes. He was on the radio and it was an interesting moment because up 
to then she was a big rock ‘n roll fan, mostly 50s and early 60s and we 
would agree about almost everything  but with Bob, that was a big 
difference. And I think that may have been the intent of his records 
because he sang in a way that was simply not allowed on the radio 
previously. Bob fundamentally changed the way that pop singers could 
sound and opened the airwaves to all different and more regional and 
unique  voices.  Its similar in way that “Smells like Teen Spirit” here 
in the States recently because all of a sudden you could have noisy 
guitars again. So both Dylan and Nirvana are both artists who changed 
the rules of the game. So Bob was something that Mom and I both 
disagreed about at the time and it was a good break for me because at 
that time I was struggling to sing at all. <br>
<br>
Q-	I heard you were going to throw the finished “Born To Run “ album out and do a live version of the album at The Bottom Line ?<br>
<br>
A-	Yeah. I don’t know what I was thinking. I was exhausted but the only 
thing I felt sure about was when we played it felt really true and I 
just didn’t really know how to make records at all.  What was good about
 it though was that it made for very eccentric sounds. The “Born To Run”
 album doesn’t really sound like any other record I know of and I have 
never made another record that sounds like that. The funny thing is the 
record I was listening to at the time was Nills Lofgren’s first solo 
album and the way the drums sounded on that album was pretty influential
 as was the purity of the rock’n roll he had on it.  So we were 
struggling to record that album. We were struggling to play in time –we 
were struggling to be musicians and I had sat a much higher standard for
 what I was trying to do on that record than we did on the first two 
albums. I wanted “Born To Run” to sound a particular way and Jon Landau,
 who became my friend and my producer was very influential in 
streamlining the souns. He had a very specific and austere sound that he
 thought the band could sound like. So it was very collaborative and I 
was very unsure about allowing anyone else’s influence on what I was 
doing because I was young and I thought that if I allowed someone to 
change it, that it might not be me anymore. So there was all kinds of 
stress and pressure going on. <br>
<br>
<br>
Q-   There are two tracks from the Born to Run sessions on the Greatest 
Hits albums, the title track and Thunder Road and you were quoted as 
saying you wanted to make a great rock record.<br>
<br>
A-	Yeah –I wanted to make the greatest rock record that had ever been 
made. I had plenty or arrogance and ambition in that area. I was rolling
 the dice so I wanted to do something that was going to be definitive so
 I had my eyes set on a pretty bug target.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q- Was Thunder Road originally called “Glory Road” ?<br>
<br>
A-	That title sounds familiar. That sounds right. Was that on another bootleg ?<br>
<br>
Q- No. Your original title was “Glory Land” . <br>
<br>
A-	The title of “Thunder Road” came from a Robert Mitchem movie that was
 very strange and eccentric that I think he put together himself. I 
think he produced it and he both sang and wrote the title song. Its 
actually a very good picture about running moonshine in the southern 
United States in the 50’s. It’s a film noir and he is fantastic in it 
and his son is in too. He plays his brother. I was a big Mitchem fan and
 I wanted out band to sound like thunder; I wanted to feel that power 
but I ‘m not sure if that song started out as “Glory Road” or not but 
the title came out of the Mitchem picture.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q-  Did you try and sing like Roy Orbison on “Thunder Road” ?<br>
<br>
A-	Yes. I was fanatically listening to Roy at the time and I wanted to 
sing a big throated vocal from deep in my chest. But there will never be
 a voice like his again.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q- What was it like to sing together ?<br>
A-	That was a huge thrill for me. He was one of my heroes for so long 
and he was a very sweet, thoughtful and generous man with me. <br>
<br>
Q- Did the success of Born To Run frighten you ?<br>
<br>
A-	Yes but of course, you pursue success at some level but we made the 
music we wanted to make and I made it uncompromisingly. I wanted my work
 to have an impact and I wanted to reach an audience. I believe in rock 
music as popular music in that something happens when good music reaches
 a large audience when, despite their differences, people find a common 
ground.  All of my favourite Motown and Dylan and soul records were big 
hit records that you heard on the radio and they were music for  the 
people; music for everybody.  I wanted that kind of impact and I wanted 
to see where I would take it to but the first time it hits -you  might 
not be ready for it. I always knew I wanted to be a musician but you can
 never be sure you are ever going to have that kind of success.  Its 
very destabilizing  because all of a sudden there is a lot more people 
in your life and a dynamic occurs concerning something inherently 
personal that you no longer have control over.  It has a life of its own
 and many wonderful things happen to you but some things you would 
rather do without.  So at the beginning you try to find a balance which 
is a bit like the first time you step on to a surfboard; in six months 
or a year you will be ok but the first few months, you are up and down 
and all over the place.  But at least I did have the E Street Band 
around me and we were a group of friends who had grown up in small towns
 but had never travelled out of the United States. So when I walked down
 the street and saw some big poster, the guys were a very stabilizing 
force. I should have probably jumped for joy but at the time I had not 
established myself and I was frightened of my music being co-opted in a 
way that wasn’t what it was meant to be about and this is a challenge 
for all new young bands when they take that first big step into the 
spotlight.<br>
<br>
Q-  You have always been a big Elvis fan. Was he an example of how not to control the fame ?<br>
<br>
A-	Well, you worry that can’t even control yourself much less anything 
else ! And even when it happened again in 1985 and I was 35, there were 
moments when I thought, “Ok, this is too much , now.”  But you have the 
stories  and the maps of the people who came before and they guide you 
whether it be Elvis, Dylan or even a one hit wonder.<br>
<br>
Q- You have been quoted as saying that by the time of “Badlands” you understood your songwriting better.<br>
<br>
A-	Well after I had the initial success, a lot of it was positive but 
some of it was controversial because the record company was laying it on
 hot ‘n heavy, and people were saying that I was just a creation of the 
record company. You wonder you are going to lose yourself and at the 
time you feel irreparably damaged, used and abused. Of course every 
artist feels that they are losing control of their work at some point 
but it does have a life of its own and then you are forced to react and 
how well you react becomes a big part of what your story is going to be.
 <br>
Q- How did you parents react to your success following Born to Run and later Born In the USA ?<br>
<br>
A-	My parents moved to California when I was 19 and I stayed in New 
Jersey and lived with the band. Until Born to Run, I didn’t really have 
the money to visit them or even phone that much. So there was a period 
when I was distant from my folks and I was trying to fashion myself and 
lead a very stripped down existence with an intense focus and my concern
 after the Born To Run record was – “Ok, what are you going to do now ? “
  So I started to develop a more self conscious philosophy about the 
type of music I wanted to make  and who I wanted to write about and give
 voice to that was going to set the path for the rest of my career. I 
wanted my music to be about real issues and about real lives – 
exhilarating and entertaining –but grounded in what real people were 
experiencing everyday. So that was the beginning of  “Darkness” but then
 I went through some bad times and couldn’t record and had the law suit 
so a long period then happened when I was back in New Jersey, in the 
bars and writing my redemption music.  Previously, I hadn’t really 
thought about my family life and my roots but after I had that initial 
success I grabbed on to those things for all they were worth because 
they were the values that I wanted my music to remain grounded in. So on
 Darkness, I started to very purposefully write about my family and my 
hometown and the limitations of real life. <br>
<br>
Q- The River sessions were in 1979-1980 and you have said that the title track was a real breakthrough song for you ?<br>
<br>
<br>
A-	Yes.  I had been listening to a lot of country music but in 
particular, Hank Williams and his writing became very important to me 
because of the great writing. His imagery was so stark, dramatic and raw
 and I wanted to write about the classic American images. I had written 
about cars and there is great rock images in car songs associated with 
“girls “and “Saturday night” and I wanted to address those images in my 
own way. But I also wanted to include the country references and the 
sense of geography, location and place that the characters would grow 
out of. The difference between rock ‘n roll and country music is that 
rock’n roll is Saturday night but country music is Sunday morning when 
you are left with the consequences because freedom always has its 
consequences and the price your going to pay for it. So I wanted my 
music to have both the exhilaration of Saturday night but I wanted to 
address the truth that these things all have a price. I also wanted to 
write about Monday to Friday which is the work week where people spend 
so much of the time. So I wanted my work to address all of these things.
 <br>
<br>
Q- There are two tracks from those sessions on the album. “The River” which is a great track and “Hungry Heart.”<br>
<br>
A – “Hungry Heart”  was going to be my great hit single. To me it was 
just like a Frankie Lyman song, something that you would hear popping 
out of the radio in the middle of summer, with the harmonies and the 
sounds sparkling in a certain way. As much as I was influenced by Elvis 
and Dylan there was also all of the garage bands and the one hit 
wonders. I loved that whole world of pop music and I initially wrote 
“Hungry Heart” for  The Ramones. I met them in Asbury Park on a Friday 
night and they asked me to write them a single and I probably wouldn’t 
have written it for myself because it was too pop sounding. I went home 
and wrote it pretty quickly. So I played  to Jon and he said. “No –you 
better keep that one !”   As a kid I had followed the pop charts and it 
was fun to be part of that world. <br>
<br>
<br>
Q- So it gave you a buzz to hear it on the radio.<br>
<br>
A-	Oh yeah, that’s one of the greatest things to hear something new you 
wrote come on the radio.  To follow the pop charts when I was young was 
the most subversive part of life in a small time where nobody went 
anywhere and if they did they didn’t come back. There was no kids on 
television at the time except the most bizarrely sanitized versions of  
kids that you knew wasn’t real. But the radio kept pumping in music that
 was subversive that made you behave and think differently and made you 
want to be someone different. It filled you with a certain kind of 
vitality that can be positive but also dangerous to.<br>
<br>
Q- A song that is still relevant today is “Out in The Street”. <br>
<br>
A-	That is a song that is the closest I have ever got to Beatles 
structures. With Born to Run, I was writing Orbison type songs that 
developed  operatically in sections which were not repeated and where 
everything led up to a crescendo. But with Darkness I started to write 
more folk based songs which spoke with simple, direct and plain images. 
 <br>
<br>
Q- It is  a great song.<br>
<br>
A-	To be truthful, when I wrote it I was trying to copy one of my all 
time favourite songs, “Friday On My Mind” by the Easybeats.  I have 
always loved that song. The structure on that is just incredible and it 
had that unbelievable exhilaration when they broke into the chorus. You 
know, its Friday and you are out of school or out of work and you’re 
just “Out there !” In my town, there was a particular place you drove to
 on  Friday that was filled with teenagers and “Out In the Street”  was 
my attempt at that writing about that image but with a Beatles type 
structure. <br>
<br>
Q- After The River sessions we have “Atlantic City”  from “ Nebraska.  That was an album  recorded in your home ?<br>
<br>
A-	I did that because I was tired of spending so much money in the 
studio where we spent such a lot of time making mistakes or recording 
things I never used. It got frustrating, so I said I am not going to go 
in until I know the songs are good. I got a new teak tape recorder and 
used two mikes and sat in my bedroom. Most of the tracks are one or two 
takes and the whole thing was done in three days.  I mixed it on  a 
Gibson beat box that taped two fast so I carried it around as a demo and
 took into the studio and tried to play it with the band but it didn’t 
work out. It was no good. So then I tried to re- record it solo in the 
studio which felt really weird because the better it sounded the worse 
it was. So I decided, well however it happened in my bedroom – that’s it
 ! <br>
<br>
Q- Sometimes demos do sound better..<br>
<br>
A-	Most of the time they really do. You leave certain things alone and 
that’s why I have made a lot of records in my house because it can 
capture that moment of creation when you are relying on your instincts 
and teaching yourself the songs based on the craft you have learned and 
it is often the most direct and most honest rendering of your work.<br>
<br>
Q- What was the record company’s reaction when you took Nebraska in to them ?<br>
<br>
A-	Well, it was kina weird in that I had just had a successful record  
and it had a hit which we had never had before. The Nebraska songs were 
meant  to be the Born In the USA album. Originally there was just going 
to be that one album and tha actual demo tape of Nebraska was so strange
 that it wouldn’t at first even transfer on to a record. So we thought 
we are going to have to put this out on just a cassette and were really 
ready to do that and finally after a long process, Charlie Plotkin found
 some old mastering equipment but it was really down to the wire. So I 
then brought it to the record company and I said “…this is it. This is 
my music right now.” And I have gotta salute the guys at my record 
company who were tremendous. They just said “Ok”. They were really 
supportive and I have been very fortunate in the support they have given
 me for almost my entire career. So I went back and worked on the “Born 
In the USA record. As I did that, the “Nebraska” album came out and it 
got a little airplay but not a lot  but I expected that.<br>
<br>
Q- Fans love the Nebraska album. Its great that in performance that a song like “Atlantic City” stays simple. <br>
<br>
A-	With that song, I was again trying to write thematically. I was 
reading a lot of Flannery O’Connor and there were a couple of movies out
 at the time  that had a certain tone that I liked. There was a movie by
 Terrence Mallick called “Badlands” with Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek 
about the Charlie Starkweather killings. It was like the real “Natural 
Born Killers” and so minimalist pictures like this affected the tone of 
my music. Also at the time, the country was swinging to the right but 
when I sat down I didn’t have any particular political motivation in 
mind but I was interested in telling those stories. <br>
<br>
Q- When you were talking earlier about Dylan and Nirvana, you very modestly left yourself out…..<br>
<br>
A-	Yes, it’s the great false modesty that I have perfected ! <br>
<br>
<br>
Q-  Yes, but did you were aware that you were now indeed having an influence then ?<br>
<br>
A-	I think the main thing was that I wanted to have an opportunity to 
influence and in 1985, I got the opportunity to travel around and shine a
 light on a lot of people who were doing great work within the 
audience’s home town and give a different vision of my country than was 
being provided by the people who were in power at the time. The earliest
 rock music had political implications but when I was young I never 
liked people preaching at me and for a while I didn’t think there was a 
place for it in my music. But I was trying deal with it thematically but
 I had a big audience at that time and I was able to provide an 
alternate vision that we were semi-successful at sometimes. (53.26)<br>
<br>
Q- “Born In The USA” seems like another era for the band.<br>
<br>
A-	That was a time when we had a chance to be definitive  and to mess 
with the rules of the game.  Its something all artists would like to do.
 At that time, I knew I had written a powerful song, which I knew would 
communicate with my audience , but I didn’t know just how much.  It was 
certainly one of the most challenging moments of my work life. What 
happened in 75 happened again in 85 but this time I was older and more 
able to deal with it in a saner fashion and it didn’t frighten me 
anywhere near as much - though I still felt I had be really on my toes.<br>
<br>
Q- It must have bee disorientating for a musician who wrote about American life to have politicians now refer to your work ?<br>
<br>
<br>
A-	It was probably the only moment in my adult life that I wished I had 
stayed in school. Not as an alternate occupation but I wished I had more
 education and had, for example, studied history more closely. I was 
reading a lot of history  in 1984-85 but when you set something that big
 lose, it has a life of its own. The party that was in power at the time
 had co-opted everything American as its own. If it was the flag –it 
belonged to the right.  If it was mom’s apple pie, it was only baked by 
Republicans and everybody else was “the other”.  You were outside and 
you didn’t even get a chance to spoil the party because you were not 
invited to it. So what I wanted to do with my music when I performed it 
was to claim my own flag and stake my own claim to those images that I 
felt were mine by birthright.  I thought I could give some kind of 
alternative vision to what the country could be about but the whole 
thing was pretty jingoistic and it was a pretty intense time.  <br>
<br>
Q- As an outsider, not an American, it has always fascinated me to see 
Black Americans, Korean Americans, Hispanic Americans or whatever of how
 proud they are to be American when they hear the national anthem or the
 flag, more so than a lot of other countries have. Its like “America-one
 for all…”<br>
<br>
A-	Actually, , Australians do pretty well at that as well…<br>
<br>
Q- Its fascinating how it all comes together and “Born In the USA” seemed to have that pride ….<br>
<br>
A – Yes it did have that in it but maybe that is why some people 
misinterpreted some of it. But along with that there was that 
character’s pride and determination to be noticed and to claim a part of
 that for himself. Those issues are tricky…they are dynamite and they 
are constantly being abused by jingoistic flag waving and nationalism 
which is very , very distructive. There are so many grey areas in that 
whole subject where you can stumble and that was running through the 
country at the time and I was putting in my two cents worth to claim 
that feeling for myself because that’s how I felt and also because I had
 created a body of work based on characters who had been left out. In 
“Born In the USA”, the character is a Vietnam veteran who comes home and
 is so disillusioned and rightly so because the system has failed him. 
It’s the same in Australia because I met quite a few of the Vietnam Vets
 down there in ’85. So he comes home and he feels betrayed so he is now 
searching for some piece of America that he can lay claim to. He just 
wants to find one small spot of honest ground to restart his life on. 
That song is basically about survival and that guy now has to create 
some sort of country for himself now. <br>
<br>
Q- That song was and is, a real breakthrough for so many guys…<br>
<br>
A-	I met some of those guys here in the States and the initial 
organization was the VFW – “the Veterans from Foreign wars” including 
the veterans from Korea, and these guys didn’t have a  lot in common 
with a generation that had grown up while they were away or in training.
 They took a lot of shit, people calling them “losers’ and I met this 
guy called Bobby Muller who said that the Vietnam Veterans needed an 
organization of their own and he was in the process of setting up an 
organizations called “Vietnam Veterans for America”.  Bobby came to one 
of the shows and asked if I would help get the ball rolling. I also met 
 by accident, Ron Kovic who wrote “Born On the 4th of July”.  I was in a
 little hotel in California and this guy was sitting by the side of the 
pool and it was him and I told him I had just read his book.  But with 
that song, I was always afraid of getting it wrong. I was an outsider 
and I didn’t know anything about what was a profound shaping experience 
for anyone who went through it, so I was very concerned with trying to 
get it right.<br>
<br>
Q-  Track 7 is “Dancing In the Dark” and I’ve gotta tell you, the video had me fooled for a long time.<br>
<br>
A-	Me too ! <br>
<br>
Q- It was a great song and a very clever video.<br>
<br>
A-	I don’t know how clever it was. I showed up and it happened but I 
don’t know how.  Except for “Atlantic City” that was our first video and
 I want dragging and screaming into the video experience. I didn’t 
really want to do it but it had become part of the job at the time. It 
was a funny song because we had done the whole of the “Born in the USA” 
record and Jon Landau said “We don’t have a hit”.  I replied, “Well, I 
don’t care if we don’t have a hit. If you want a hit, you write it.” But
 I sat around that night and wrote it and again it was the idea of 
having a big radio hit and yet it was one of the most personal songs on 
the album because I was actually writing about me and how I was feeling 
at the time.  It was a record that later on I said, “I don’t know about 
that one –its just too pop. I’m not so sure…”  But we played it and it 
did sound pretty good and Jon and I had one of our yearly pop v rock 
arguments around it. <br>
<br>
Q- It also set the them for the 1984-85 tour because it attracted a new audience.<br>
<br>
A-	yes –that it did because there were people who had never heard our other music who I had never seen before.<br>
<br>
Q- Well, you also see it in the sense of a combining of the new and old Bruce Springsteen audiences.<br>
<br>
A-	And they left straight after that to !  But it was pretty different 
because all of a sudden I saw a lot of really young kids and a whole lot
 of different kinds of people which I liked because I had been playing 
for 15 years or so and all of a sudden I saw old fans with kids on their
 shoulders. I always wanted our band to be a vessel that would help our 
audience understand their community and some of the things in their 
lives but I also wanted it to be a party and entertainment and I think a
 lot of people came out for the whole thing.<br>
<br>
Q- I think it achieved both and with Dancing in the Dark, Born In the 
USA and My Hometown, you dealt with all of those themes which combined 
to make it a great record –not to mention a huge selling album. Glory 
Days is another great track.<br>
<br>
A-	That was me meeting a guy as I used to go to school with as I was 
going into a bar and he was coming out. We both said “ Hey –how yer 
going ?” , and we went back in and sat down and the song basically 
happened. It was easy to write –it just came flying out.<br>
<br>
Q- Is it true that you wrote a verse about your Dad in  Glory Days  which you later did not use ?<br>
<br>
A-	No I only remember those three verses but you know more than me so maybe ! <br>
<br>
<br>
Q- I love the “Tunnel of Love “ album. Tell me about “Brilliant Disguise” ?<br>
<br>
A-	After 1985, I needed to take stock and see where I had been 
successful  and also where I had failed. I needed to regroup and 
re-introduce myself to the fans as a songwriter but at the same time 
there were a lot of issues in my own life that I had not sorted out and I
 wanted to write about men and women which was a subject I had not 
really written about very much. I also thought that a lot of that stuff 
had not really bee written about in pop music that much. Most of it was 
very romantic but Bob’s romantic music was always very complex and 
fundamentally adult because he came out of the folk tradition.  I also 
wanted to write very adult love songs about things which dealt with the 
real compromises and issues which are involved when you have  a real 
relationship with somebody.  I originally wrote it in a couple weeks in 
my garage.<br>
<br>
Q- Originally, I think you went to LA ?<br>
<br>
A-	No- I wrote a series of songs in my little house in the hills in LA 
in the winter immediately after the Born in the USA tour. Those songs 
have never seen the light of day and are still sitting around. This 
record really started when I went back and set up in my garage in Jersey
 and I recorded it there. <br>
<br>
Q- We move on to the Human Touch sessions in 1990-91. These songs were recorded when your children were born ?<br>
<br>
<br>
A-	Yeah. After the Tunnel of Love tour I was going through all of my 
personal problems and I took a lot of time off to find out exactly what I
 was doing with myself. I had had a lot of success with my work but I 
was a mess and totally confused otherwise. So I took a year off and then
 started to record when I finally felt like I wanted to start working 
again. But the whole period was really a hiatus where I was trying to 
centre myself and create a life that I had never had off stage. I wanted
 a life that would work and was meaningful. <br>
<br>
Q- Roy was around on that ?<br>
<br>
A-	Yes- he came up with “Roll of The Dice “ but I had recorded a few things before that.<br>
<br>
Q- David Sancious came back as well ?<br>
<br>
A-	Yes –he played on a few things and this was an opportunity that I 
wanted. I had the exhilaration of working with different musicians and 
Davy was around and he was always a great player so he came in and 
played a little bit. So we just chipped away on it until we came up with
 something that we felt was releasable. <br>
<br>
Q- And then came “Lucky Town”<br>
<br>
A-	Well I was trying to write one last song for “Human Touch” but out 
came “Living Proof” and it sounded completely different to me. And then 
in two weeks I worte the rest of those songs. What happened on “Human  
Touch”  was that we had a very controlled recording process and it was 
very much a “studio record”. By the end of it, I wasn’t sure about some 
of it and the “Lucky Town “ record was a reaction to it. I just went 
over to my house, set up my acoustic guitar and that record developed 
literally in a month after we finished the “Human touch” record. So we 
ended up with two records.<br>
<br>
Q-  I caught a concert you did on that tour in Paris. A fantastic show- 
did you enjoy that first tour without the E Street Band ?<br>
<br>
<br>
A-	Yes, I did enjoy it, particular the European tour. The musicians were
 not only great players but they were very nice people who came from 
very different backgrounds. Zac was rock, Shayne was R&amp;B, one woman 
was a gospel singer another was a pop singe. Bobby King was a soul 
singer. Tommy Sims was from funk –so you had all of these different type
 of people all in one place. We would get on the bus and switch the 
beat-box around and everybody would play the type of music they grew up 
with, so you were exposed to all different types of music which was a 
very stimulating type of thing. And this was what I was looking for. The
 E Street Band fellows and I all have relatively  the same musical 
background and that’s what made that strong but I wanted to do something
 where people came from different places musically and geographically 
and see how that worked together.<br>
<br>
Q- You once did 32 songs in Sydney …. (March 28, 1985)<br>
<br>
A-	Maybe it was too long ?<br>
<br>
Q- No it was great but you played in stinking hot weather in Paris in 1993 for almost as long.<br>
<br>
A-	I like it when it is hot. It greases the wheels and everybody gets 
hot and sticky and start smashing together and the sweats flying. To me 
that’s what it was all about. I used to love the to see the great soul 
performers sweat it out !  My music was never a cool thing. It was never
 coming from a cool place. But in a long show, you learn how to conserve
 your energy.<br>
<br>
Q- “Streets of Philadelphia” is up next from a great film.<br>
<br>
A-	I recorded it in my house in Jersey.  Jonathan Demme wanted a rock 
song but I had seen the part of the film that the song was to be played 
over and this was going to introduce the character before the film 
actually began so a ballad felt right to me. <br>
<br>
Q- We have discussed “Born to Run” and how its success had frightened you….(81.42)<br>
<br>
A-	Yes but it can be a wonderful experience also watching the impact 
that your work has on peoples lives. At the end it is a good deal but it
 can be a strange ride. <br>
Q- Secret Garden is a beautiful song.<br>
<br>
A-	It’s a song about relationship and it was meant to connect back to a 
song like “Brilliant Disguise”. When any two people get to know each 
other, it involves letting down your defences and that can be 
frightening.  .<br>
<br>
<br>
Q- And “This Hard Land”<br>
<br>
A- Its about those themes I discussed earlier when we were talking about
  “Born in the USA” which is when I wrote it. Its about someone trying 
to find a place –trying to build his life but its also about friendship –
 just as “Blood Brothers” is really a song about my friendship with The E
 Street band.    ……….Look –we better go soon or you’ll be lynched by 
these women over there. (points behind) <br>
<br>
Let me interview you, what would you have put on this album ?<br>
<br>
<br>
Q- Maybe something from the first two albums  but I can see why you 
didn’t. Anyway, thanks for keeping your integrity and get back in the 
studio !  <br>
<br>
A- I will.  Shit this has been a work out !</div>

Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. Brisbane Entertainment Centre, Thursday, March 14.</strong><br>
<br>
Rating: 5 out of 5 stars<br>
<br>
Sometimes a show takes the breath out of your lungs and leaves you 
speechless. In awe. Unsure how to articulate what you just witnessed.<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band is one such show. This is a man 
at the top of his game, defying his 63 years and displaying the energy 
of a man one third his age.<br>
<br>
Springsteen opens with We Take Care of Our Own, a song familiar to anybody who watched Barack Obama's reelection campaign.<br>
But the second song takes us far from the American campaign trail and 
much closer to home – a cover of The Saints' Just Like Fire Would. It's a
 nice touch for the Brisbane crowd.While keen to give a nod to his host 
city's musical history, Springsteen's also never far from his own 
roots.You can imagine a young Springsteen in his formative years on the 
Jersey shore, with his mates carefully studying the greats – Sam &amp; 
Dave and James Brown get a mention – to learn how to capture an 
audience. To put on a show.<br>
<br>
Boy did they take note. And, in return, Bruce Springsteen and the E 
Street Band put on a master class of their own. A master class in rock 
'n' roll, folk and a whole lot of brass-infused soul. Springsteen's big 
on sentiment. It's The Boss's first show in Brisbane since 2003, and the
 first Australian tour without Clarence Clemons, whose presence looms 
large throughout.<br>
<br>
“Are we missing anybody?” Springsteen asks after an E Street Band roll call during My City in Ruins.<br>
<br>
“Yes. Yes we are.”<br>
<br>
But while Clarence is gone, Clemons is not – his nephew Jake is on the 
sax and cuts an uncanny likeness to his uncle in both sight and sound. 
Another E Streeter gone is former Sopranos star Steven Van Zandt, in 
Norway filming Lilyhammer (Springsteen gives an impromptu, animated 
geography lesson at this point demonstrating the spherical nature of 
Earth and the relative positions of Australia and Norway – I only wish 
my geography teacher was so cool).<br>
<br>
But in his place tonight is Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom 
Morello. And those who witness him tonight will be speaking about it for
 decades. Morello is sublime; just sublime. And those who bear witness 
to his amazing solo in The Ghost of Tom Joad – a track, incidentally, 
that was covered by RATM – will be raving about it in much the same way 
as those who saw Hendrix's Star Spangled Banner at Woodstock.<br>
<br>
I've never seen anything like it. Nor have I seen an artist interact with a crowd in the way Springsteen does.<br>
<br>
It's a relationship built on mutual trust. Springsteen spends an 
incredible amount of time in the audience with his fans – epic crowd 
surfing during Hungry Heart, dancing on the floor (though not in the 
dark) with them, sharing the microphone with them and, seemingly, 
shaking hands with a healthy percentage of the 12,000-strong Brisbane 
Entertainment Centre crowd. With that sort of interaction, we all know 
what's coming. And it happens deep into the encore.<br>
<br>
It's been 29 years since a young Courtney Cox joined Springsteen on 
stage in the Dancing in the Dark film-clip. Nearly three decades on, 
it's Nada Smith's turn, thanks to her daughter's hand-written sign: 
“Bruce please dance with my Mum”.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is an accommodating chap, so it's not surprising when he 
takes young Georgia Smith up on her offer. It's clear there's no 
barrier. He's one of us. We're one of them.<br>
<br>
And, outside the venue after nearly 3½ hours of relentless Springsteen brilliance, Nada Smith is floating on air.<br>
“Am I dreaming? Did that really happen?” she asks.<br>
<br>
It's a common question around the happily dazed throngs around the Entertainment Centre tonight.<br>

<br>
George Palathingal-the Sydney Morning Herald<br>
<br>
Rating: 4 out of 5 stars<br>
March 18, Allphones Arena, Olympic Park- Sydney Australia</strong><br>
<br>
The circumstances were considerably different to Bruce Springsteen and 
the E Street Band's last Sydney appearance – or as the man himself 
described it, "the great power failure of 2003" – at the first of his 
three-date residency at Allphones. Before some had even made it into the
 arena Springsteen had banished memories of that Sydney Cricket Ground 
debacle, standing tall, chopping away at his guitar and beaming like a 
proud uncle, as he led his legendary band through selections from their 
brilliant career.<br>
<br>
As a songwriter and performer, if perhaps not as a singer, Springsteen 
is in the form of his life. Still, even though he could have fit all of 
current album Wrecking Ball into his famously long set and disappointed 
few, he's evidently as content performing older songs he has played 
countless times and could be bored of, as he is the fresh material that 
keeps him vital. Indeed, at a little longer than two-and-a-half hours 
(without a break), this turned out to be one of the band's shorter shows
 – but they still gave everyone a memorable night.<br>
<br>
Whether crowd-surfing during Hungry Heart or goofing around at the top 
of Spirit in the Night, Springsteen's enjoyment was infectious. There 
was cute audience participation in both a 10-year-old girl joining him 
to sing Waitin' on a Sunny Day and a young woman joining him for the 
coda of Dancing in the Dark. And few will forget the sight of 14 of the 
18 musicians on stage shuffling from side to side in a simple but 
enormously likeable bit of formation dancing.<br>
<br>
More importantly, the whole band rocked fiercely throughout, from its 
warm five-piece horn section to its soulful backing singers. Others made
 valuable contributions with violins, accordions and possibly, on Death 
to My Hometown, the kitchen sink.<br>
<br>
It's easy to forget what a fantastic guitarist Springsteen is himself 
but he graciously shared that limelight with Nils Lofgren, a whirling
