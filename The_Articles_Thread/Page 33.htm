<br>
Reviewing a Bruce Springsteen concert is like reviewing Father Christmas.<br>
The Boss and Santa have very different gigs, but they never put on a bad
 show and, in the end, you always feel like you’ve been given a gift -- 
even if you’re the one paying for it in the form of a $130 ticket.<br>
On his off nights, Springsteen is better than most other performers at 
the top of their game. When he’s on … well, there’s just nothing that 
can compare.<br>
On Sunday night at Copps Coliseum in front of a near-sellout crowd of almost 18,000 loyal fans, The Boss was on.<br>
At 63, Springsteen may not be moving with the same fireball energy with 
which he started more than 40 years ago, but the vitality remains, and 
that raspy voice of his seems to be getting better – maybe it’s because 
of the incredible clarity of the sound system and maybe some things just
 improve with age.<br>
He started out late, hitting the stage for a scheduled 7:30 p.m. concert
 at 8:25 p.m., but he made up for it by opening, almost apologetically, 
with a personalized greeting: “Hello Hamilton, it’s Hammertime,” and 
then tore into My Love Will Not Let You Down.<br>
He was anxious to meet the crowd and on his second number, Out In The 
Street, he stepped off the stage and into the crowd, rubbing flesh, 
passing his microphone to young children, reaching over the boards to 
touch, hug and shake hands.<br>
By the third song the audience was in full sing-a-long with Hungry 
Heart, with Springsteen pushing his way onto a second stage in the 
middle of the rink, trusting his fans enough to fall backwards on to 
their waiting arms and then crowd-surfing his way a full fifty feet back
 to the main stage.<br>
Not bad for an old man. And there were still some two and a half hours 
and some 25 more songs left in a show that didn’t end till almost 11:30 
p.m. — three full hours without a break.<br>
The show was slick and sentimental, at times a little cheesy (how does 
he manage to find so many little girls who know the lyrics to Waiting On
 A Sunny Day?), but most of all it was passionate, even inspired.<br>
This is the first tour Springsteen and his E Street Band has toured 
without the towering presence of the Big Man, Clarence Clemons on 
saxophone, who died last year. There were plenty of teary moments 
marking Clemons’ passing, especially during the closing encore of Tenth 
Avenue Freeze Out which include a special video tribute.<br>
Musically, Springsteen made up for the loss with a special expanded 
edition of The E Street Band, with a five-piece horn section and a four 
backing singers and percussionists. All told, there were 17 players on 
stage (Patti Scialfa sent her regrets), adding a depth to the music that
 took on revival-tent proportions during a spectacular gospel-tinged 
Spirit In The Night.<br>
He picked his set list from every part of his 40-year career, including 
Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street (from his first album, Greetings From 
Asbury Park), The Rising, She’s The One, Born To Run, Because The Night,
 Badlands, Rosalita, Dancing In The Dark and Land of Hope And Dreams.<br>
As well, the band performed several songs from the newest album Wrecking
 Ball, including the title song, Shackled And Drawn, We Take Care Of Our
 Own, Jack Of All Trades and Death To My Hometown.<br>
There was also the now-familiar request segments, where Springsteen 
wades out into the crowd and picks colourful “song signs” from crowd 
members – we got I’m Going Down (for a fan who confided that he had just
 been “dumped” by his girlfriend) and a rare solo acoustic performance 
of Terry’s Song, a “hidden track” from Springsteen’s Magic. It closes 
the album, but isn’t listed on the album cover.<br>
Whether it was on the set list or prompted by a sign from the crowd 
isn’t clear. But it was requested in honour of Sydney Wood, an 
11-year-old girl who died suddenly in August.<br>
Terry’s Song was a special moment, with Springsteen telling the audience
 how he wrote it in honour of a long-time friend (Terry Magovern) who 
worked as Springsteen’s personal assistant for 23 years before dying in 
2007.<br>
It was a sad story that Springsteen told, but still it was filled with 
laughs about the good old days playing the New Jersey bar circuit. 
Terry’s Song got a huge ovation. For true Springsteen fans, it was just 
like a gift found under the tree.</div>

<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Greetings from Asbury Park NJ [Columbia, 1973]</strong><br>
<br>
"The Angel" and "Mary Queen of Arkansas" are turgid 
unaccompanied-acoustic horrors that could scare anybody off this 
particular Dylan hype. But the jokey lingo and absurdist energy of 
everything else are exactly the excesses that made Dylan a genius 
instead of a talent--it takes real conviction to save "But did not heed 
my urgency" with "Your life was one long emergency." Even urban-mythos 
rambles like "Lost in the Flood" are not without charm. And in songs 
like "Growin' Up" and "Blinded by the Light" there's an unguarded 
teen-underclass poetry that has Springsteen's name on it. B+<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle [Columbia, 1973]</strong><br>
<br>
 Folkie trappings behind him, Springsteen has created a funky, vivacious
 rock and roll that's too eager and zany ever to be labeled tight, 
suggesting jazz heard through an open window with one r&amp;b saxophone,
 or Latin music out in the street with zero conga drums. He celebrates 
youth in all its irresponsible compassion and doomed arrogance, but he's
 also old enough to know better--for him, the pleasures of the city are 
bigger and more exquisite than the defiance and escape that define most 
hard rock. "New York City Serenade" is as bathetic as you might fear, 
but "Rosalita" is more lyrical and ironic than you could have dreamed. 
This guy may not be God yet, but he has his sleeveless undershirt in the
 ring. A-<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Born to Run [Columbia, 1975]</strong> <br>
<br>
Just how much American myth can be crammed into one song, or a dozen, 
about asking your girl to come take a ride? A lot, but not as much as 
romanticists of the doomed outsider believe. Springsteen needs to learn 
that operettic pomposity insults the Ronettes and that pseudotragic 
beautiful-loser fatalism insults us all. And around now I'd better add 
that the man avoids these quibbles at his best and simply runs them over
 the rest of the time. If "She's the One" fails the memory of Phil 
Spector's innocent grandeur, well, the title cut is the fulfillment of 
everything "Be My Baby" was about and lots more. Springsteen may well 
turn out to be one of those rare self-conscious primitives who gets away
 with it. In closing, two comments from my friends the Marcuses. Jenny: 
"Who does he think he is, Howard Keel?" (That's a put-down.) Greil: 
"That is as good as `I Think We're Alone Now.'" (That's not.) A+<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Darkness on the Edge of Town [Columbia, 1978]</strong><br>
<br>
 "Promised Land," "Badlands," and "Adam Raised a Cain" are models of how
 an unsophisticated genre can illuminate a mature, full-bodied 
philosophical insight. Lyrically and vocally, they move from casual to 
incantatory modes with breathtaking subtlety, jolting ordinary details 
into meaning. But many of the other songs remain local-color pieces, and
 at least two--"Something in the Night" and "Streets of Fire"--are 
overwrought, soggy, all but unlistenable. An important minor artist or a
 rather flawed and inconsistent major one. B+<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The River [Columbia, 1980]</strong><br>
<br>
 All the standard objections apply. His beat is still clunky, his 
singing overwrought, his sense of significance shot through with Mazola 
Oil. He's too white and too male, though he's decent enough to wish he 
weren't; too unanalytic and fatalistic, though his eye is sharp as can 
be. Yet by continuing to root his writing in the small victories and 
large compromises of ordinary joes and janies whose need to understand 
as well as celebrate is as restless as his own, he's grown into a bitter
 empathy. These are the wages of young romantic love among those who get
 paid by the hour, and even if he's only giving forth with so many short
 fast ones because the circles of frustration and escape seem tighter 
now, the condensed songcraft makes this double album a model of 
condensation--upbeat enough for a revery there, he elaborates a myth 
about the fate of the guys he grew up with that hits a lot of people 
where they live. A-<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Nebraska [Columbia, 1982]</strong><br>
<br>
] Literary worth is established with the title tune, in which 
Springsteen's Charlie Starkweather becomes the first mass murderer in 
the history of socially relevant singer-songwriting to entertain a 
revealing thought--wants his pretty baby to sit in his lap when he gets 
the chair. Good thing he didn't turn that one into a rousing rocker, 
wouldn't you say, though (Hüsker Dü please note) I grant that some 
hardcore atonality might also produce the appropriate alienation effect.
 But the music is a problem here--unlike, er, Dylan, or Robert Johnson, 
or Johnny Shines or Si Kahn or Kevin Coyne, Springsteen isn't 
imaginative enough vocally or melodically to enrich these bitter tales 
of late capitalism with nothing but a guitar, a harmonica, and a few 
brave arrangements. Still, this is a conceptual coup, especially since 
it's selling. What better way to set right the misleading premise that 
rock and roll equals liberation? A-<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Born in the USA [Columbia, 1984]</strong><br>
<br>
] Imperceptible though the movement has been to many sensitive young 
people, Springsteen has evolved. In fact, this apparent retrenchment is 
his most rhythmically propulsive, vocally incisive, lyrically balanced, 
and commercially undeniable album. Even his compulsive studio habits 
work for him: the aural vibrancy of the thing reminds me like nothing in
 years that what teenagers loved about rock and roll wasn't that it was 
catchy or even vibrant but that it just plain sounded good. And while 
Nebraska's one-note vision may be more left-correct, my instincts (not 
to mention my leftism) tell me that this uptempo worldview is truer. 
Hardly ride-off-into-the-sunset stuff, at the same time it's low on 
nostalgia and beautiful losers. Not counting the title powerhouse, the 
best songs slip by at first because their tone is so lifelike: the 
fast-stepping "Working on the Highway," which turns out to be about a 
country road gang: "Darlington County," which pins down the futility of a
 macho spree without undercutting its exuberance; and "Glory Days," 
which finally acknowledges that among other things, getting old is a 
good joke. A+<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Tunnel of Love [Columbia, 1987] </strong><br>
<br>
Where Nebraska was plunged in a social despair he never quite made his 
own, this companion piece comes out of personal compulsion. By depicting
 the fear of commitment as sheer terror, he does the impossible: renews 
L-O-V-E as pop subject. First side's got distance, bravado, optimism, 
even a joke, but then comes one long deep look inside, so well-observed 
that he seems neither self-pitying nor self-important, just a decent guy
 with a realistic understanding of his major but not insoluble emotional
 problems. And although the format is almost as spare as Nebraska's, the
 man has worked on his sense of rhythm the way he's worked on his 
marriage, which means he's pleasing to hear with just a drummer or 
alone. Next thing you know he'll learn to dance. A<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Chimes of Freedom [Columbia EP, 1987]</strong><br>
<br>
 If the title cut on this live charity record invests Dylan's protest 
with an aura of sacred majesty, the other three invest honorable 
Springsteen copyrights with an aura of sacred cow. Supposedly, his 
"reinterpretations" of his own "classics"--acoustic "Born To Run," E 
Street "Tougher Than the Rest"--have a demythologizing effect, but years
 of enormous rooms have finally taken their spiritual toll; the 
self-importance he's always accused of drips from his all-American drawl
 like Vitalis off a D.A. He's staved off this fate for as long as he has
 with modest strokes like Nebraska, and it's conceivable he'll come up 
with another one. Then again, this was probably supposed to be another 
one. B-<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Devils and Dust [Columbia, 2005] </strong><br>
<br>
Springsteen the superstar's one-man-band album is less engaging 
musically than Malkmus the cult artist's, but more engaging 
artistically, because for all his overreliance on dramatic drawls, 
Southwestern locales, and mother love, Springsteen has stories to tell. I
 dearly hope the two kids in "Long Time Comin'"'s sleeping bag are off 
with their parents on a cheap but restorative vacation--that would be so
 much less a commonplace than on the road. But I'm not so curious I'm 
tempted to boot up the explanatory DVD on the other side of the 
superstar's DualDisc. A-<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Born to Run (30th Anniversary Edition) [Columbia, 2005] </strong><br>
<br>
In his career-making third album, a Jersey contender turned an old Chevy into a Pink Cadillac and took an epic ride<br>
The biggest problem with Bruce Springsteen's 1975 breakthrough album was
 always how unabashedly it proclaimed its own greatness. The 
wall-of-sound, white-soul-at-the-opera-house Born to Run is definitely 
full of itself--its lead track emoted over five minutes of portentous 
piano, its title track laden with glockenspiel and guitar guitar guitar,
 its thematic burden an unresolved quest narrative, its groove as grand 
as a V-8 hearse. Newcomers may not get why its class-conscious songcraft
 provided a relief from the emptier pretensions of late-hippie 
arena-rock. Yet it sounds greater today than it ever did.<br>
By definition, the remastered thirtieth-anniversary edition of the album
 that put a cult artist from South Jersey on the cover of Time and 
Newsweek isn't shy about its greatness either. Greatness is what such 
packages hawk, so be grateful that this one has a right. Rather than 
"bonus tracks"--45-rpm mix of "Born to Run," anybody?--you get the 
original album and nothing but the original album. The remastering adds 
only presence, warmth and texture to the digitalization, which by lax 
early-Columbia standards wasn't bad to begin with. Three decades later, 
Springsteen still takes pride in his workmanship and his art, and that's
 strong of him. But the bonus DVDs that bring the damage up to $40 
suggest some questions--and not just who will watch either of them 
twice.<br>
One disc is a re-edited version of the oft-bootlegged November 1975 
London concert that lasts two hours; the other, 20 minutes of a 1973 
performance in L.A. plus an 87-minute making-of-the-album documentary. 
Surprisingly, it's the documentary that conveys more of the impish 
irrepressibility that made Springsteen so hard to resist onstage when he
 was young. His febrile ambition is less omnipresent than fond memory 
would hope at the London show, which the documentary recalls as if it 
was V-E Day. It's there in London when the singer disappears into an 
onstage crevice during "Spirit in the Night" or launches another chorus 
of "Rosalita," and on the show-topping rock &amp; roll covers. But it's 
intermittent on the Born to Run material and lost in the fog of several 
loosely structured earlier songs. Which isn't even to mention the 
solos--let's hope organist Danny Federici knows how lucky he is to have 
his job.<br>
In the still photos, taped studio chatter, reminiscences and 
descriptiosn of the 25-year-old Springsteen who bet his life on Born to 
Run, however, youthful intensity is palpable. The idea here, as in so 
much public Springsteen, is to establish a seriousness that avoids the 
pomposity the music risks. We learn Springsteen composed the album's 
melodies on piano and worked out the words in a notebook where a single 
lyric can occupy dozens of mostly scratched-out pages. We hear a 
boogieing run-through of "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out," an abandoned femme 
chorus behind "Born to Run," a lost violin intro to "Jungleland"--all 
possible bonus-cut fodder. Springsteen grins sheepishly at these shards 
of misplaced enthusiasm. They were just errors, history tells the 
auteur. As of 1975, Born to Run said what he wanted to say, and because 
it's a realized work of art, its truth will endure.<br>
But its truth is now historic. Whatever factual value there once was in 
Springsteen's epic vision of small-town street kids buying a cool old 
car and pursuing their destiny on the road--and it was always a 
romance--is reduced to poetry in a world where college graduates wait 
tables to get through the indentured servitude of internship and gas 
costs whatever the oil companies say it does. But if any rock star knows
 that, it's Springsteen. He's pleased that many of his former 
dead-enders can afford $40 commemorative reissues. If he's also angry 
that today's young have it worse, which he is, he can at least help them
 appreciate their parents' lives. A+<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions [Columbia, 2006</strong>]<br>
<br>
 We shall overkill, he means. Never have his Howard Keel tendencies, or 
maybe now they're Paul Robeson tendencies, tripped him up so bad. The 
idea is to big up the music and play the jokes you don't ignore like 
you're working a Roman amphitheater. I'm glad to have met the anti-war 
lament "Mrs. McGrath" and Sis Cunningham's "My Oklahoma Home," and sort 
of hope young people deprived of music appreciation funding will now 
hear "Erie Canal," "Froggie Went A-Courtin'," "John Henry," and "Jesse 
James." Only are young people really ignorant of these songs? And how 
many of them buy Springsteen albums anyway? Amping up his strange 
bluegrass-Dixieland hybrid like E Street is just around the corner, he 
sings his lungs out. But in folk music, lightness is all--and only 
newbies and John Hammond Jr. lean so hard on the cornpone drawl. B<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Magic [Columbia, 2007] </strong><br>
<br>
Always emotional, sometimes mawkish, he lives with war as he tries to forget it ("Last to Die," "Livin' in the Future"). **<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Wrecking Ball [Columbia, 2012]</strong><br>
<br>
 The first six tracks are all heavy irony shading over into murderous 
rage, with refurbished arena-rock to slam it home; it's perversely 
anti-political to lay any other interpretation on the opening "We Take 
Care of Our Own," which cites places "From the shotgun shack to the 
Superdome" where we--meaning the U.S.A. so many Americans weren't even 
born in--documentably haven't taken care of our own. It's protest music,
 damn right about moral abstractions rather than those finely limned 
characters good little aesthetes get gooey about, and for me a cathartic
 up. Second half's less of a scour, which the anti-political find a 
blessed relief and I find a forgivable nod to humanism and Clarence 
Clemons--especially since the climactic "We Are Alive" is so vulgar as 
to assume that all America's oppressed will rise up from the grave they 
share. To wreak vengeance, y'think? They got a right. A-</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen: Say Hello to Last Year’s Genius<br>
Zoo World, March, 14, 1974<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
Perhaps you know someone who at a very early age proclaimed his 
intention to become a doctor and, after vanishing into deep study for 20
 years, emerged wearing a stethoscope. If so, you might be able to 
imagine the intensity of Bruce Springsteen’s lifelong obsession with 
music.<br>
<br>
“I always knew what I wanted to do and where I was going,” says the 
singer/songwriter from Asbury Park, New Jersey. “Anything other than 
music was always a dead end for me.”<br>
<br>
Now twenty-four, Bruce first picked up a guitar at age nine and has been
 playing, with only rare interruptions, ever since. The only “real” job 
he has ever had, as a gardener, ended quickly. He left behind an equally
 brief college career because “the times were weird, the students were 
weird and the school was weird.” And because the Army thought Bruce just
 as strange as he felt the college scene to be, he was exempted from two
 years in uniform.<br>
<br>
Sidestepping these irrelevancies with pleasure, Bruce continued to 
concentrate on his music. After performing in more local bands than he 
can now remember by name, he worked for a time as an acoustic soloist. 
And by early last year, he had assembled his present band and had put 
together a solid repertoire of original material.<br>
<br>
It was then that Mike Appel (who with Jim Cretecos manages Bruce and now
 produces his albums) brought him to Columbia Records. Upon hearing a 
few songs, Columbia’s John Hammond Sr. promptly handed a two-record 
contract to Bruce and his band. Hammond, who had signed Bob Dylan ten 
years before, reportedly said that Bruce was a lot further along 
musically than Dylan had been at the same stage of his career.<br>
<br>
On the strength of this praise, Columbia poured big money into 
promotion, but the advertising push partly backfired. Rolling Stone, for
 example, did a piece called, “It’s Sign Up a Genius Month” and 
dismissed Bruce’s first album (Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.) with a 
string of sarcastic superlatives.<br>
<br>
Most reviewers, however, were genuinely enthusiastic. “One of the truly 
great singer-songwriter-performing talents our country has produced,” 
wrote a Record World columnist. “You know the kid is good when you wake 
up and you’re singing his songs,” commented Crawdaddy editor Peter 
Knobler. “Never have I been more impressed with a debuting singer,” 
raved a writer for the L.A. Free Press, and Al Bianculli, in these 
pages, said simply, “’73 is “Bruce Springsteen’s year.” Bruce, it 
certainly seemed, was well on his way.<br>
<br>
But a year later, he explains that he has not yet exactly taken the 
country by storm. “I ain’t makin’ that much money,” he says. “I’ve got 
some great musicians in my band and I’m payin’ them terrible money. I 
pay myself the same, but it’s terrible for me, too. I mean, we’re barely
 makin’ a livin’, barely scrapin’ by.”<br>
<br>
Though Bruce’s newly released second album may sell better, Greetings 
attracted only about 23,000 buyers, a respectable yet not spectacular 
achievement for a debut LP. The Columbia contract has been extended, but
 only for a third album. And while the critical praise keeps coming, 
Bruce wishes he could sell records as easily as he elicits a reviewer’s 
acclaim.<br>
<br>
The second album indicates, at the very least, that he deserves a much 
wider audience. Written and arranged by Bruce, its highly emotional 
songs fuse vivid lyricism to poignant melodies. Incorporating touches of
 jazz, soul and Latin music, this is basically get-up-and-dance rock ’n’
 roll. When the record ends, you may find yourself wishing Bruce and his
 group could jump out of your stereo and do an encore.<br>
<br>
The five unknowns who comprise the backup are among the most flexible 
and versatile rock musicians performing today. Perhaps because they’ve 
been working with Bruce for a long time, they are able to inject the 
music with a dose of their own ideas without ever straying from his 
intentions or detracting from the overall cohesion.<br>
<br>
While it is difficult to single out any one band member over the others,
 Clarence Clemons’s sax playing has to be considered a high point. 
Daubing the broad strokes of Bruce’s moody portraits, he underlines the 
reflective side of the singer’s style. And, when the tempo accelerates, 
Clemons punctuates the change with a burst of energy.<br>
<br>
Bruce’s own immense talent is omnipresent. Like Rod Stewart, Van 
Morrison and Dylan, he has a limited vocal range, but his imagination 
and expressive ability seem almost boundless. His melodies are 
influenced by the work of many other musicians, most notably Van 
Morrison; yet, like all true originals, this composer absorbs what his 
predecessors have done and uses the gleanings to create music that can 
only be called his own.<br>
<br>
Lyrically, Bruce accomplishes more in one tune than many artists do in 
an entire album. From each of his songs, which are structured like 
stories, one or more well-defined characters emerge. “Incident on 57th 
Street,” for example, is a close-up look at Spanish Johnny, a “romantic 
young boy” who wavers between involvement with a girl named Jane and the
 hard life on “Easy Street.”<br>
<br>
Playing a “cool Romeo” to Jane’s “late Juliet,” he sits up alone and 
watches her while she “sleeps in sheets damp with sweat.” When she opens
 her eyes, he is dressing to leave and voices are heard beckoning 
through the window: “Hey Spanish Johnny, you want to make a little easy 
money tonight?”<br>
<br>
Leaving their relationship no more or less tentative than it was when 
the song began, he whispers a farewell: “Goodnight, it’s all right Jane /
 I’m gonna meet you tomorrow night on Lover’s Lane.” Not quite sure why 
he is going, what he is looking for or whether he will discover it, he 
adds: “We may find it out on the street tonight, baby / Or we may walk 
until the daylight, maybe.”<br>
<br>
“Fourth of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)” similarly balances the emotions of
 its central character against the outer situation that helps mold them.
 In this vignette, some of the imagery recalls Van Morrison’s 
“Brown-Eyed Girl,” but Bruce builds a much richer environment than does 
Morrison.<br>
<br>
By the time Bruce tells Sandy that “for me, this boardwalk life’s 
through,” the listener has been transported by the lyrics to Asbury’s 
arcades, beaches and casinos. And one perceives that, for the singer, 
this “carnival life on the water” is a colorful, fascinating film, but 
one that has become stuck at a single frame.<br>
<br>
“I just got tired of hangin’ in them dusty arcades,” he sings, “bangin’ 
them pleasure machines.” And later: “That tilt-a-whirl down on the south
 beach drag . . . they kept me spinnin’, I didn’t think I’d ever get 
off.” When the song ends, one realizes that it has not dealt so much 
with the “scene” as with its main protagonist, because everything is 
described so completely through his eyes.<br>
<br>
Is Bruce singing about himself here? “I don’t know,” he says, pausing 
for a long moment. “I’ll tell ya the truth. I really don’t want to talk 
about it. I really don’t want to touch on the songs at all, because I’ll
 screw them up. As soon as you start talking about it, you’re messing 
with the magic, you know?”<br>
<br>
While he himself is reluctant to discuss his songs, Bruce seems glad 
that other people are beginning to do just that. “I got talking with a 
cop last night who knew all the music, all my tunes, and it blew my 
mind! You know, it was an amazing thing. He was talking about ‘Sandy’ 
and ‘Rosalita.’ He knew all the songs.”<br>
<br>
Visions of stardom have been known to dance in the head of a young 
artist as his work starts to become popular. But, says Bruce, “I don’t 
think about it. I can’t get involved in that. ’Cause I learned, don’t 
ever expect anything. I got my hopes, you know, but my hopes are 
completely based in reality, in what I know I can do.”<br>
<br>
For example? “Well, for one thing, I hope to be makin’ a little more 
money than I am right now. I want to be able to take care of people a 
little better than I can right now. ’Cause if you don’t have a 
sufficient amount of money where people can be comfortable, they’re 
always going to be sweating it out, worrying whether they’re gonna make 
it or not.<br>
<br>
“That’s very hard for the people in the band, ’cause there are 
pressures. Guys in the group gotta pay alimony, rent, food bills. And a 
guy may just want to go out for the evening to relax, go to a bar or 
something and buy a drink, you know?<br>
“The older people get, the harder it is for them to hang on to an 
unprosperous thing. Even though this is a very together band. You start 
thinkin’, ‘Maybe I ought to go into a different profession, fix TVs, 
become an electrician or something.’ You start thinking a little bit 
more seriously, you know.”<br>
<br>
Does Bruce find that happening to himself? “Oh, no, not to me.” He 
laughs. “This is it for me, you know. I got no choice. I have to write 
and play. If I became an electrician tomorrow, I’d still come home at 
night and write songs. If you can choose, you might as well quit. But if
 you have to, you have to.”</div>

Musicians’ best friends to be honored in Freehold</strong><br>
<br>
By clare marie celano<br>
<br>
<br>
Tex Vinyard walked next door to complain about the volume of the music 
being played by a group of neighborhood kids. With that action, Vinyard 
started a chain of events that would ultimately lead to the birth of an 
American rock star.<br>
<br>
According to Freehold Borough Councilman Kevin Coyne, borough officials 
are planning to honor Marion and the late Gordon "Tex" Vinyard by 
dedicating the small park at Center and Jackson streets across from the 
Rug Mill Towers in honor of the couple to acknowledge what they gave of 
themselves.<br>
<br>
<br>
What they gave in turn would eventually give the borough of Freehold, 
and ultimately the world of music, a legacy that will live forever.<br>
<br>
Ceremonies naming the park in honor of the Vinyards are scheduled for May 18.<br>
<br>
Vinyard worked for Kimberly Clark in Spotswood during the day, but when 
his shift was over, much of his time was spent listening to the music of
 a neighborhood band called the Castiles.<br>
<br>
According to George Theiss of Freehold Township, the initiator of the 
Castiles, Marion and Tex became surrogate parents to a group of kids who
 wanted to make it to the "Big Time."<br>
<br>
One of those kids did make it to the "Big Time" — borough native and Castiles member Bruce Springsteen.<br>
<br>
Theiss told Greater Media Newspapers his band was practicing one day in 
the mid-1960s at the Center Street home of Bart Haynes, drummer for the 
Castiles. (Haynes was later killed in Vietnam. In fact, he was the first
 soldier from the borough to die in Vietnam). Haynes lived in the duplex
 next door to the Vinyards.<br>
<br>
According to Theiss, when Vinyard asked the kids to turn down the 
volume, it was Theiss who suggested that he might want to help them out 
by managing the band himself.<br>
<br>
Vinyard did just that and the events that followed are now a part of rock ’n’ roll history.<br>
<br>
Theiss said that a short while after the initial encounter with Tex, the
 members of the Castiles found themselves in the Vinyards’ home. The 
couple had turned their dining room at 35 Center St. into a makeshift 
studio to provide space for the band to practice, work on music, hang 
out and eventually, a place for every other kid in town.<br>
<br>
Theiss recalled that although initially the Castiles were the only band 
that played in the Vinyards’ dining room, over a period to time, the 
number of kids grew.<br>
<br>
"Kids in other bands would come around and listen to us. Then there were
 the sisters and the girlfriends and lots of other kid besides our own 
gang that would come and listen to us play. In fact, eventually, there 
were kids sticking out of the windows, out on the porch — they were 
everywhere," he said laughing.<br>
<br>
Theiss recalled with a chuckle that borough Mayor Michael Wilson was 
among the youths hanging out on the porch and parking there to listen to
 the music.<br>
<br>
"Marion and Tex were like second parents to us. They didn’t have any 
children of their own, and I think they kind of felt that we had become 
almost like their own children," Theiss said.<br>
<br>
According to Theiss, who still plays guitar with the George Theiss Band,
 the Vinyards’ house was filled with kids most of the time. He said 
Marion cooked for them and made them feel at home while they practiced.<br>
<br>
There was not a tremendous age difference between the band members and 
the Vinyards so they were better able to relate to one another than they
 would have had the couple been older.<br>
<br>
"We could say and do things with Tex and Marion that we couldn’t do with
 our parents," Theiss said. "Yet, they were still very protective of us 
and supervised us.<br>
<br>
"Tex would get us bookings and then shuffle us all over to the gigs in 
that ’61 black Mercury of his. Because the car always had these giant 
speakers hanging out of them, we inevitably got pulled over. In fact," 
Theiss remembers, laughing, "Once I opened my mouth, it was all over. My
 smart mouth got Tex a lot of tickets."<br>
<br>
Theiss said he has many pleasant memories of those years between 1965 
and 1967 with Marion and Tex guiding them. He remembers the generosity 
of the couple and things like Tex buying the band guitar strings and 
other equipment.<br>
<br>
"I think it’s a wonderful idea for Freehold Borough to dedicate a park to the Vinyards," he said.<br>
<br>
The new children’s playground and park at Center and Jackson streets is 
built on the site where the house that once nurtured, fostered and 
supported young talent and honored the dreams of a bunch of hometown 
kids who were reaching for the stars once sat. The Vinyards’ home was 
eventually torn down in the early 1970s.<br>
<br>
According to Marion Vinyard, Tex passed away in December 1988. She 
remembers the Castiles and the music in those early days with fondness 
and a touch of nostalgic sadness for what no longer exists in her life.<br>
<br>
When asked to go back to the beginning, Marion said that all she knew 
was that her dining room was gone for good. Memories flooded over the 
face of the woman who said she knew in her heart that Springsteen would 
make it.<br>
<br>
"He always said he was going to make it," Marion said. "I believed him."<br>
<br>
Among an array of snapshots and news clippings, Marion took a brief trip
 back in time and took a Greater Media Newspapers reporter along for the
 ride.<br>
<br>
"I enjoyed all of it," she said, as she lightly fingered the snapshots 
that told the story of a rise to stardom for one young man and a heck of
 a ride for those who supported him.<br>
<br>
She remembers when the "boys," as she endearingly referred to the 
members of the band, would practice while their sisters and girlfriends 
prepared food for them.<br>
<br>
"We gave them a lot of tuna fish," Marion said, laughing. "The girls 
would also make pizza and hot dogs and sometimes biscuits, too."<br>
<br>
Soon many other kids started arriving to watch the show.<br>
<br>
From Marion’s description, the small duplex swelled with both the music 
of the boys’ playing and the audience would be tapping their own brand 
of rhythm to the sounds they heard.<br>
<br>
She said she doesn’t remember anyone complaining about the volume of the music.<br>
<br>
Wilson was one of those youths tapping to the music at the Vinyards’ 
home. According to the mayor, he was the lead singer in a band called 
Legend. Wilson called the Vinyards’ house the band’s "home away from 
home."<br>
<br>
"I met Tex for the first time when my band was playing at the YMCA on a Friday night, just like in Bruce’s song," Wilson said.<br>
<br>
"Bruce and Tex came to hear us. I was playing bass guitar and singing at
 the same time. Well," Wilson said, beginning to laugh, "I was kind of 
playing guitar and singing at the same time. Bruce and Tex noticed that 
my guitar wasn’t plugged in. My own band members didn’t see it, but they
 did. I got caught. I found out I couldn’t play guitar and sing at the 
same time. We laughed so hard. It was the end of my bass guitar playing 
career. I think I decided then that my career would be in politics and 
not in music."<br>
<br>
Marion Vinyard said she enjoyed the kids in all of the bands Tex eventually ended up managing.<br>
<br>
"We built a whole family over the years," she said.<br>
<br>
One is witness to this family of teens of all shapes and sizes due to 
Marion’s self-appointed role as chief journal and record keeper of the 
family musical journey the whole group was traveling on.<br>
<br>
"People used to tell me I was wasting my time," she said smiling, "but I didn’t think so."<br>
<br>
Flipping through the pages of a photo album filled with Polaroids of 
teens sitting, standing, posing or eating snacks is actually like 
flipping through the history of the early years of rock ’n’ roll and the
 Vinyards’ absolute devotion to the kids who were making it all happen.<br>
<br>
To this day, Marion continues to make collages for Springsteen — photos 
of his successes, year after year. She said Springsteen has the photos 
and memorabilia of the band’s history and his career for safe keeping.<br>
<br>
Springsteen thanked the couple during his November 1996 concert at St. Rose of Lima School, South Street.<br>
<br>
In dedicating "This Hard Land" to Marion Vinyard, Springsteen said of 
the couple, "They let us play loud. When Tex would come home, he’d 
somehow have an extra microphone that we needed. I can’t say how 
valuable that support was. Marion, I love you very much."<br>
<br>
Marion said she always wanted a "dozen boys." She feels she and Tex had 
them. Although Tex and Marion shared — and she continues to share — a 
special closeness with Springsteen and Theiss, she said she still hears 
from many of the youths who were a part of her life in the those days.<br>
<br>
When asked how she and Tex felt as they watched Springsteen’s rise to 
fame in the 1970s and 1980s, she said she always knew he would make it.<br>
<br>
"Tex was tickled pink," she said. "We were both so very proud of him. His success made us both very happy."</div>

 <br>
By Martin Chilton, <br>
Daily Telegraph, London<br>
June 14, 2013</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen, who is touring Britain this month, has given hundreds
 of interviews during his half century as a musician. A brilliant new 
book, Springsteen on Springsteen, re-prints the best interviews, going 
back to 1973. Here is how Springsteen has evolved:<br>
<br>
THE 1960s . . .<br>
<br>
Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born on September 23, 1949, in New 
Jersey), attended Freehold Borough High School. His father, Douglas, was
 a bus driver and also worked in factories. In the book, the singer 
speaks of a troubled adolescence, describing himself as "a dreamer", 
"one of the town freaks", and "a misfit who was pretty ostracised by my 
hometown". He says he was a "sensitive kid" who had the "devastating 
experience of not being accepted by my father". He said of his father, 
"he was a pretty good pool player and not much else".<br>
He said he was not a literary child and "went through a year and a half 
of college, which I don't remember a darn thing from". His mother, an 
Elvis Presley fan, bought him his first guitar at 13, changing his life.
 Although he started as a guitarist only, he later said: "I never felt I
 had enough personal style to pursue being just a guitarist."<br>
<br>
He refers to himself as "an isolated" teenager, saying "from when I was 
17 until I was 24 I never had a record player, so I never heard any 
albums that came out after, like 1967. And I was never a social person 
who went over to other people's houses and got loaded and listened to 
records – I never did that. And I didn't have an FM radio."<br>
<br>
THE 1970s . . .<br>
<br>
His musical influences were Chuck Berry, Elvis, Buddy Holly, Van 
Morrison's Them and Bob Dylan – but it was his own desire to make music 
that drove him on. Aged 24, he had already started playing in a band 
with lifelong friend Steve Van Zandt but they were struggling to make a 
real breakthrough (they were booed as the support act to Chicago) and 
scraping by day-to-day. "I was living on like a dollar a day. Some chick
 was helping me out . . . and I haven't paid the band for three weeks," 
Springsteen said in 1974. "But this is for me, you know. I got no 
choice. I have to write and play. If I became an electrician tomorrow, 
I'd still come home at night and write songs."<br>
The "only real job Springsteen ever had, as a gardener, ended quickly," the book says.<br>
The superstar about to play Wembley Stadium was dismissive of large rock
 venues, saying, in 1974, that big arenas drove him "insane" adding: "I 
won't go to those places again, we won't play any place over three 
thousand. I am always disappointed in acts that go out and play those 
places . . . I don't know how Joni Mitchell can do it."<br>
After the breakthrough of Born To Run, Springsteen was a worldwide 
success. In 1978, he said: "Now all of a sudden . . . There's more money
 than we can spend."<br>

It was a period of intense work. He said he was "self-conscious" about 
his lyrics and worked like a demon to hone them, going to bed at eight 
in the morning, sleeping until four and writing all night. "For at least
 an entire winter, I suffered from severe light deprivation," 
Springsteen admitted.<br>
He was widely known as 'The Boss' but insisted: "The name 'Boss' started
 with people that worked for me ... It was not meant like Boss, capital 
B, it was meant like 'Boss, where's my dough this week?' And it was sort
 of just a term among friends. I never really liked it."<br>
As he released Darkness On The Edge of Town, his own music taste 
broadened to country music, especially a passion, which remains to this 
day, for Hank Williams. "He's just incredible," said Springsteen. For 
relaxation, Springsteen would play softball with saxophonist Clarence 
Clemens, adding: "We used to play hard. We had to stop, though, when 
Clarence and myself used to get too battered up."<br>
<br>
THE 1980s . . .<br>
<br>
As he entered his thirties, he considered himself as hard-working as 
ever, saying in 1981: "When you get fat and lose your hunger. That is 
when you know the sellout has happened."<br>
He looked back on his sudden success in the mid-1970s and said: "When I 
was 25, I was much more insecure . . . I've seen all sides of the music 
thing and now – whatever happens now is only gonna be a shadow of that 
moment."<br>
The decade started well – with Born In The USA and the magnificent 
Nebraska – and he said "I feel better than I have ever felt before – I'm
 kinda at peace with the whole thing "<br>
The late 1980s was a more tumultuous time. Springsteen met and married 
actress Julianne Phillips but they divorced in March 1989, less than 
four years into their marriage. Some of his emotions were chanelled into
 the album Tunnel Of Love. He then fell in love with singer Patti 
Scialfa, with whom he has three children. He wrote of this period: "You 
have to understand the limitations of your own life and keep pushing 
through it."<br>
He retains a great rapport with his fans and recalled many happy 
encounters including the time when "I was down at the beach, this little
 kid called Mike who was about eight came up to me and said, 'You want 
me to show you my Dancing in the Dark moves?' so I said OK."<br>
<br>
THE 1990s . . .<br>
<br>
Springsteen released two albums (Human Touch and Lucky Town) on the same
 day in March 1992. He said that life had not turned him into "a cynic" 
but said he understood as a middle-aged man that "we all live with our 
illusions and our self-image, and there's a good percentage of that 
that's a pipe dream."<br>
<br>
He also talked about having therapy at this stage of his life, 
admitting: "It's very difficult for me to connect up with anything. From
 my youth, I had a tendency to be isolated psychologically". 
Psychoanalysis would not have been part of his upbringing, but he said 
therapy was "a tool that helps you centre yourself" and described it as 
"one of the most healthy experiences of my life ... It demands a leap of
 consciousness".<br>
The man who once lived on scraps, moved to a $14million Beverly Hills 
estate. He called having young kids "a blessing and a work out".<br>
He had parted from the E Street band and played a series of solo 
concerts after releasing the superb Ghost Of Tom Joad album in 1996, 
saying the introspective songs were bringing the "fullness of my 
experience to the audience".<br>
He was also getting more overtly political, having written an 
introduction to book Journey To Nowhere: The Saga of the New Underclass.
 He said he was concerned at "people we write off" adding that his own 
dad "had a difficult life . . . I've always felt like I'm seeking his 
revenge".<br>
He said he drinks the occasional Jack Daniels whiskey but asked whether he had ever taken drugs, replied: "No, I never did".<br>
<br>
<br>
THE 2000s . . .<br>
<br>
In 2003, Springsteen released The Rising, his first album with E Street 
band in 18 years. "When I hit fifty, I became very prolific," he said of
 a decade in which he released four new albums and won 13 Grammy awards 
in a decade.<br>
His work was increasingly political, as he wrote about 9/11 and helped 
raise money for Democrat candidate John Kerry. He later campaigned for 
Barack Obama in 2008 saying: "I want my country back. I want my dream 
back. I want my America back," and spoke out in favour of gay marriage.<br>
His musical tastes were broadening (he did a folk album called The 
Seeger Sessions) and said he had started listening to the jazz of Louis 
Armstrong.<br>
Springsteen, his second wife Patti and children Evan, Jessica and 
Samuel, moved back to New Jersey in this decade, with Springsteen 
exclaiming: "God bless the Garden State".<br>
<br>
THE 2010s . . .<br>
<br>
Springsteen in his sixties has lost none of his work ethic. He keeps a 
folder of successful past sets to make sure his concerts are vibrant and
 started playing festivals, including Glastonbury in 2011. His children 
are growing up (when they saw video footage of him as a 27-year-old, he 
said: "I've been informed by my kids that we simply look ridiculous") 
and one is following him into the music business.<br>

He does power walking and weight-lifting to keep fit and said he was "a 
lot less uptight and a lot less self-conscious" than ever before. It's 
been a time of loss, too, with Springsteen writing a moving eulogy to 
Clarence Clemons, who died in June 2011 aged 69. He said what still 
mattered was playing concerts. "The long conversation with my fans has 
been one of the most valuable experiences of my life."<br>
In March 2012, he gave the keynote speech to SXSW Festival in which he 
said: "We live in a post-authentic world. And today authenticity is a 
house of mirrors . . . at the end of the day, it's the power and purpose
 of your music that matters."</div>

Springsteen: what it's really like to work for The Boss<br>
<br>
By Neil McCormick<br>
Daily Telegraph ( London)<br>
June 15, 2013</strong><br>
<br>
It has been hailed as the greatest rock ’n’ roll show on Earth. Tonight,
 Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band take the stage at Wembley 
Stadium to deliver another epic set, containing everything from stark, 
emotional intimacy to righteous explosions of joy and anger. There will 
be 18 musicians, dipping in and out of music that encompasses blues, 
soul, gospel and folk, all focused on rock’s most charismatic, 
critically lauded and popularly acclaimed singer-songwriter.<br>
Over a 41-year recording career, Springsteen has sold more than 120 
million albums, won 20 Grammy awards, and played thousands of gigs, 
mostly backed by his legendary ensemble the E Street Band. It’s not for 
nothing that they call him “The Boss”. But what is it really like to 
work for Springsteen?<br>
“It’s a term of affection, but he is certainly ‘The Boss’, both in a 
figurative and literal sense,” says drummer Max Weinberg, who has been 
playing with Springsteen since 1974. “We are all parts of a 40-year-old,
 well-oiled machine directed in every aspect by Bruce. I have never seen
 any other aggregation of singer and band that’s like this.”<br>
Guitarist Nils Lofgren, a member of the E Street Band since 1984, as 
well as being an acclaimed solo artist in his own right, agrees. “In 
Bruce, you’ve got a guy with hundreds of great songs, which is the core 
of any rock ’n’ roll show, [who is also] an incredible singer and 
performer,” he says. “And even beyond that, you’ve got a guy who just 
grew up very engaged and passionate. You can’t fake that. He’s picked 
musicians over the decades that have that same sensibility. 
Collectively, it’s a formidable thing.”<br>
The seriousness with which Springsteen takes his music is reflected in 
his staging. “There is a simplicity to the lighting, and the only 
pyrotechnics come from his physical performance and from the music 
itself,” says Roy Bittan, the band’s piano player for the past 39 years.
 “The goal is to make it feel like a one-on-one experience. If you’re 
out in the audience you feel like he’s talking to you.”<br>
<br>
Certainly, by the standards of modern, hi-tech productions, 
Springsteen’s live shows are old fashioned and stripped back, with few 
special effects other than big screens relaying the performance. All of 
the action comes from the band, who regularly perform for over three and
 half hours a night. In July last year, when the Wrecking Ball tour came
 to Hyde Park, in London, promoters pulled the plug on an encore 
performance by Springsteen and Paul McCartney because the three-hour 
show had gone past its official 10.30pm curfew, provoking guitarist 
Stevie Van Zandt to denounce Britain as a “police state”, and proclaim: 
“we break curfews in every country”. Two weeks later, in Helsinki, the 
band closed the European leg of the tour by performing for four hours 
and six minutes, which fans claim was Springsteen’s longest ever show.<br>
These highly physical performances are no mean feat for a 63 year-old. 
Earlier in his career, the skinny, junk-food eating star would become so
 exhausted that trainer, Phil Dunphy, once claimed “they used to have to
 carry him offstage”. But in 1983, Dunphy devised a fitness regime for 
Springsteen that involved free weights and running up to six miles a 
day, and the star has followed it ever since. Thanks also to a mainly 
vegetarian diet and his distaste for narcotics – that most clichéd of 
rock star vices – Springsteen is the picture of good health, still to be
 found stage diving into the front rows. “I watch every night, and I’m 
constantly amazed at the energy he has,” says Bittan.<br>
Springsteen is also fond of mixing things up a bit. “On any given night,
 30 per cent of the set Bruce comes up with spontaneously, so we are 
expected to know every song we’ve ever played, without rehearsal,” says 
Weinberg. “The only thing you can be sure of is that you can never be 
sure what he’s going to do. So you’d better pay attention or you’re 
going to miss the bus. When we leave the stage at night, we don’t leave 
anything up there; we are giving you everything we have.”<br>
Concerts are so unpredictable that Lofgren keeps 30 guitars by the side 
of the stage, including banjos, lap steel and pedal steel guitars so 
he’s ready for any contingency.<br>
“I have emergency guitars so if I can’t get the right instrument, at 
least I have something to play,” he says. “I have capos and slides, so 
at least I can get going with the song and if I need to switch up to 
another guitar my [technician] and I will work that out during the song.
 It’s very exciting.” At a concert in Europe this month, a sign in the 
crowd prompted Springsteen to launch into Dobie Gray’s Drift Away. 
“We’ve never played that song in our lives but the singers just started 
singing and it was spectacular,” says Lofgren.<br>
<br>
Springsteen writes a set list in the run up to each show “but he never 
follows it”, says Lofgren. “Sometimes he’ll change the first song on the
 way to the stage ‘cause he hears the roar of the crowd and he gets a 
better idea. And all night long he’s getting better ideas. He’ll change 
the songs, and even inside the songs he’ll change the arrangement. He’s 
really a master of stream of consciousness, he’ll pick up an acoustic 
guitar and point to the pedal steel, tell Soozie [Tyrell, violinist] to 
play fiddle, point to Charlie [Giordano, keyboards] to pick up an 
accordion, and he does that all night. Bruce is always challenging 
himself to make each show unique, something you will never see again. 
The horn players say he’s like an old jazz cat.”<br>
The core of the E Street Band formed over a number of years in the 
Sixties and early Seventies in Asbury Park, in Springsteen’s native New 
Jersey. When Springsteen was signed by Columbia as a solo artist in 
1972, he enlisted local musicians including bassist Garry Tallent and 
late, long-serving members saxophonist Clarence Clemons and keyboard 
player Danny Federici. Weinberg and Bittan arrived in 1974 and Van 
Zandt, a long-time friend and collaborator, officially joined in 1975. 
Backing singer and guitarist Patti Scialfa (who later became Mrs 
Springsteen) was brought in alongside Lofgren in 1984. Federici died of 
melanoma in 2008, aged 58, and Clemons of a stroke in 2011, aged 69, but
 a core of seven musicians remains, augmented by a touring line up that 
has risen, over the years, to 18. “It’s kind of like Bruce is the Pied 
Piper and these are people he’s picked up on his journey,” says 
Weinberg.<br>
Of course, being The Boss necessitates a certain distance; a space 
between employer and employee. Springsteen disbanded the E Street Band 
in 1989 saying he felt stuck in a rut. But Weinberg insists there was 
never a falling out. “We all just kind of went about our business, and 
grew up and stayed close. No one offered more advice and assistance, 
emotional and otherwise, than Bruce. He was checking in on a weekly 
basis, how’s everybody doing?”<br>
Springsteen made guest appearances on many of his former band member’s 
solo projects and used them on his own solo sessions over the next 
decade, eventually reconvening the group in 1999. Since then, they have 
produced one acclaimed album after another, from the inspirational post 
9/11 masterpiece The Rising to last year’s angry bulletin from 
recessionary America, The Wrecking Ball.<br>
All of the E Street Band talk keenly about the loss of Federici and 
particularly Clemons, the imposing saxophonist who appeared with 
Springsteen on the cover of Born to Run. When I spoke to Springsteen 
last year he compared losing Clemons to losing “something elemental 
[like] the air or the rain”. The band now features Clemons’s nephew, 
Jake Clemons, on saxophone as part of a five-piece horn section, 
something which, Lofgren says, puts “more tools in the box for Bruce to 
play with.”<br>
And offstage? Bittan insists there is little difference between the 
public performer and the private man.“You can’t do what he does without 
really being able to have feet-on-the-ground centred-ness,” he says. “We
 all know it’s easy to get caught up with all the things you are 
presented with when you reach a certain level of celebrity. I think he 
realised that if he doesn’t make his own personal life as real as 
possible, that would spill into what he is trying to do.”<br>
Weinberg adds, “Bruce is the guy who has got to sit in his room with a 
pencil and a guitar and write those songs. That’s why he’s The Boss. 
It’s pretty simple when it comes down to it.”</div>

Wembley Stadium, London<br>

Bruce Springsteen is more than three hours into the show when he raises 
an eyebrow to the crowd and warns them he fears the plug might get 
pulled if he plays another song. And with a flourish, he leads the E 
Street Band into Twist and Shout – finally getting to play the number 
that was cut short in Hyde Park last summer, though there's no Paul 
McCartney on stage this time. Steve van Zandt and Garry Tallent take the
 falsetto hollers, a five-piece horn section adds heft, and you'd swear 
Springsteen had brought the best wedding band ever to London.<br>
<br>
But the E Street Band are so much more than that. The centrepiece of 
tonight's show is a complete performance of the 1978 album Darkness on 
the Edge of Town, an album Springsteen describes as being "at the heart 
of what we do", which deals with themes barely suited to this mass act 
of communion: doubt and identity, and lives being torn apart. It's one 
of rock's most profound and ambiguous albums, and its performance is a 
triumph. As the coda of Racing in the Street ebbs and flows across the 
71,000 people in the stadium, the silence is absolute, as if everyone 
has their own shattered dream to remember. Only Candy's Room, so 
dependent on precision for its build and release of tension, suffers a 
little with stadium sound, but it's a tiny gripe.<br>
<br>
The run-through of Darkness had not been announced in advance, but it is
 apparent early in the show that something unusual is in store for the 
evening, because after only three songs, Springsteen is prowling the 
front rows of the audience, harvesting signs for requests. And so 
Rosalita – as explosive an expression of unbridled joy as you can 
imagine – is played while north London is still light, rather than at 
the end of the set. Hungry Heart gets a nod after Springsteen notices a 
sign requesting it and promising souvlaki in return.<br>
<br>
His interaction with the crowd is funny and deeply moving throughout – 
two women are hoisted up to dance in stage during Dancing in the Dark, 
the older of the two giving Springsteen a come-hither gesture that 
suggests that if playing for 200 minutes at the age of 63 doesn't give 
him a heart attack, her attentions surely will. He dives straight in, 
taking her tenderly in his arms. Maybe one could say it's routine, just 
showmanship, but the eternal miracle of Springsteen is that he never 
appears to be faking it for the audience's benefit. It's almost 
commonplace to say a Springsteen show is another triumph, but – really –
 he just keeps getting better and better.</div>
