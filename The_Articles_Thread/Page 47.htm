<br>
Thirty years after singing on an anti-apartheid anthem, the rock star is
 touring South Africa for the first time. Bernadette McNulty joins him<br>
<br>
<br>
DAILY TELEGRAPH   <br>
By Bernadette McNulty<br>
Feb 1 2014</strong><br>
<br>
Johannesburg’s cavernous FNB stadium will always be inextricably linked 
to Nelson Mandela. Back in 1990, not long after it was built, the 
football ground was the perfect location for the ANC leader, finally 
released from imprisonment after 27 years, to address the nation of 
which he would become the first democratically elected president. Then, 
in December last year, Africa’s largest stadium (with a capacity of 
nearly 95,000) held the passionate, euphoric tribute to the country’s 
beloved Madiba.<br>
If anyone can step up to the legacy and atmosphere of the FNB stadium it
 will be Bruce Springsteen. The American rock star has come to the 
country for the first time ever to play a series of four concerts. He 
arrives at a point when his international popularity seems to have risen
 once more to match his Eighties heyday. His latest album, High Hopes, 
released last month, has reached number one in 17 countries, making him 
the only US artist to have had records at the top of the American charts
 in each of four decades.<br>
<br>
When Springsteen touched down in Cape Town for three smaller concerts at
 the Bellville Velodrome ahead of the Johannesburg date, the arrival of 
his private jet and the sight of the Boss stepping on to the tarmac, 
wearing his signature black leather jacket despite the sweltering sun, 
were reported as if it were a royal visit. At his traditional first-gig 
press conference, the 64 year-old described how he felt he had 
“accidentally walked into the crossroads of history” by arriving just 
after Mandela’s death. He laughed, though, when asked if he thought his 
visit was historic. “It may be eventful but it is not historic. You’ve 
got too much history here in this country for it to be historic. We are 
just going to try and make it eventful for the audience.”<br>
<br>
International rock and pop stars are not the exotic creatures they once 
were in South Africa. Since the World Cup in 2010, the country has 
become a more regular stop-off for musicians, hosting concerts last year
 by the likes of Rihanna, Bon Jovi and Justin Bieber. But what makes 
Springsteen’s visit more resonant is that he brings with him a personal 
connection with South Africa’s past and the international protest 
movement against apartheid in the Eighties. In 1985 he performed on the 
song Sun City, which was directed against the South African gambling 
resort for its luring of international stars to break the sanctions 
against performing in the country; three years later he played two 
consciousness-raising gigs in Africa alongside Sting, Peter Gabriel and 
Tracy Chapman as part of a tour organised by Amnesty International.<br>
<br>
Springsteen credits his guitarist and old friend Stevie Van Zandt for originally switching him on to the issues in South Africa.<br>
“The Sun City record was really important for us in the States in 
understanding what was going on down there. Steve was way ahead of the 
curve: he got rockers and rappers together, something that hadn’t 
happened before in America.”<br>
<br>
On stage, bedecked in his typical hippie bandana and scarves, Van Zandt 
is the visually florid ying to Springsteen’s clean-cut yang. His face, 
flashing between comic pout and broad, mischievous smile, is becoming as
 familiar as that of his New Jersey schoolfriend thanks to his 
television acting roles, first in The Sopranos and now in the Norway-set
 comedy drama Lilyhammer. It was the filming schedule for the latter 
that led to his absence from the tour of Australia last year, during 
which Springsteen recruited Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom 
Morello to fill his place. Morello’s attacking style inspired many of 
the new versions of songs on High Hopes and he is now a full band member
 for the latest tour. Van Zandt’s distinctive Italian nose doesn’t seem 
to have been put out of joint, though. “I get to work the audience. I 
don’t even have to be in tune, let alone learn all the chords.”<br>
Van Zandt first travelled to South Africa in 1984 to research a solo 
album. Appalled by the government’s plans to relocate the black 
population to artificial “homelands” he came out of the trip with a much
 bigger ambition: to force Ronald Reagan to end his opposition to 
economic sanctions against apartheid South Africa. The focus of his 
campaign became Sun City, a huge resort built on one of the homelands, 
luring stars such as Elton John, Rod Stewart and Queen to play by 
offering million-dollar fees. “By zoning in on one policy I could tell 
the whole story of South Africa and I could tell it quite literally. You
 wouldn’t usually do that in a song,” says Van Zandt.<br>
<br>
Only months after the Live Aid concerts, Van Zandt quickly assembled an 
astonishing roster of musicians to appear under the banner of Artists 
United against Apartheid: Miles Davis, Bob Dylan, Lou Reed, Bobby Womack
 and, of course, Springsteen signed up alongside rappers such as Afrika 
Bambaataa and Run DMC. “At that moment, record companies were hoping 
that rappers would just go away. But I knew it was important to have 
them because it was the first time black artists had been able to 
express themselves directly.”<br>
<br>
Despite little radio play – “it was too black for white radio and too 
white for black radio” – the brilliant video showing Reed, Springsteen 
and co larking around on the streets of New York was a massive MTV hit. 
“It was completely disorganised compared to We Are the World,” says Van 
Zandt. “I would ring our video guy up at 2am and say, ‘Get up, Miles 
Davis is here playing. Come over and video him.’ ” The song raised a 
million dollars for the anti-apartheid campaign and, more astonishingly,
 had the political effect Van Zandt had aimed for. When Reagan used his 
presidential veto to try to block the Anti-Apartheid Act’s passage 
through Congress in September 1986, the House of Representatives 
overrode the veto three days later, and the act became law.<br>
<br>
“Sun City became a street-orientated revolutionary song,” says Van 
Zandt. “This was not intended to last for ever. It was intended to fix 
the situation. And in the end we achieved one of the few victories we 
will ever see in our lives.”<br>
<br>
Equally significant for Springsteen was the Amnesty concert he played in
 Harare two years later. Desperate to see him play, 15,000 young South 
Africans applied for visas to enter Zimbabwe to attend the concert. 
Hearing of the influx, Springsteen addressed them from the stage. Rather
 than condemning the white population, he offered sympathy for those 
being conscripted to fight in South Africa’s border war with Angola. 
“There can’t be much worse than living in a society that’s at war with 
itself, under a government at war with its own people and being required
 to support that government,” he said.<br>
<br>
Richard Pithouse, a lecturer in politics at Rhodes University in 
Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape, was too young to attend the concert but
 says its impact, along with that of protest records like Sun City, were
 significant inside the country: “Along with Bob Marley’s concert in 
Zimbabwe in 1980, this gig still resonates now. He showed young South 
African men sympathy rather than dictating to or hectoring them. He was 
uncompromising in his condemnation of apartheid but they also felt they 
were being understood. It’s easy to forget how isolated young people 
felt when books and records were hard to get hold of. Records like the 
Specials or Eddy Grant’s Gimme Hope Jo’anna didn’t bring down the system
 but they did nurture a subculture of resistance.”<br>
<br>
As meaningful as Springsteen’s connection is with South Africa, it seems
 as much the universality of his musical themes – romantic, rousing 
narratives about daily economic and emotional struggles – and his 
spectacularly physical shows, most lasting over three hours, that are 
captivating audiences around the world.<br>
Jon Landau, Springsteen’s manager, cuts an avuncular, gently bearish 
figure backstage, and it is hard to believe this relaxed, smiling man is
 overseeing the complex logistical operation of shifting the Springsteen
 show around the world. “Touring has been completely professionalised, 
it is not like the olden days,” he says. He compares Springsteen to an 
“athlete” but also stresses how carefully they arrange the shows so that
 the 64 year-old can look after his voice: “We can do three, sometimes 
four shows in a week. If we do five, that is playing with fire. Once a 
singer’s voice gets strained you don’t have a chance to get it back 
unless you cancel shows.”<br>
While everything backstage is run with calm but ruthless efficiency, on 
stage, he says, Springsteen puts planning secondary to being in the 
moment with the audience, “He doesn’t have a watch. He gets in a zone, 
and he knows when a show is complete. That is why every show is 
different, the set list is different. It isn’t a recital.”<br>
Springsteen speaks in measured, serious tones about issues such as 
economic inequality, although like Van Zandt he believes it is harder 
now to make a political statement in music. He says there are too many 
distractions to cut through to get people’s attention, which chimes with
 Van Zandt’s view of the Sun City record. “I’m not so sure we could pull
 it off again now,” Van Zandt says. “We are in a different place, in a 
permanently bad economy across the world. I don’t think you could 
interest people in foreign issues in the way that you could then. It was
 a golden moment; you could get things done.”<br>
Despite rejoicing in “the miracle” of having black presidents in South 
Africa and the United States in the 25 years since he was in Zimbabwe, 
Springsteen says his aspiration for the South African shows is the same 
that he has anywhere: “I just want to play the best shows I can and 
entertain people.” Rather than political, the word Landau and Van Zandt 
use to describe the shows is “spiritual”. Van Zandt says that since the 
death of E‑Street Band members Danny Federici and Clarence Clemons 
“spirituality is now a permanent part of our show. You lose them but you
 don’t. They live for ever in the work and in the show.” It’s a 
sentiment that takes on greater poignancy later that week when 
Springsteen’s hero Pete Seeger dies and he plays We Shall Overcome in 
remembrance of him.<br>
On stage at the Bellville those ghosts are joined by Mandela, whom 
Springsteen pays tribute to in a jubilant opening cover of the Special 
AKA’s Free Nelson Mandela and later in a more meditative We Are Alive, 
saying: “This is a song about the living and the dead. About how the 
body dies but how the spirit lives… the dead are always whispering into 
the ears of the living.”<br>
Surveying the 10,000-seat velodrome, Springsteen jokes that it feels as 
if he is back in New Jersey’s Asbury Convention Hall, but the smaller 
venue doesn’t stop him from delivering another barnstorming performance.
 As he flits between soul, folk, rock and gospel, drawing on 
rock’n’roll’s most electrifying showmen, from Elvis to James Brown, all 
wrapped up in the distinct mythology of his own blue-collar rock’n’roll,
 the mostly middle-aged audience, finally enjoying the songs they only 
heard at far remove, are transformed into a sea of almost teenage 
rapture. It is the kind of party you feel the country deserves – and 
that Nelson Mandela would have very much enjoyed.</div>

The West Australian<br>
STAFF REPORTERS The West Australian<br>
February 4, 2014.<strong class="text-strong"></strong><br>
Bruce Springsteen has rocked into Perth ahead of his three sold-out shows.<br>
<br>
The Boss was greeted by fans at Perth Airport this afternoon.<br>
<br>
Asked about his first impressions of Perth, Springsteen replied: "It's hot."<br>
<br>
"I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet," he said of his visit.<br>
<br>
These are Springsteen’s first gigs in WA in a career stretching five decades.<br>
<br>
The 65-year-old added a third Perth show after the first two concerts sold out in a matter of minutes in September.<br>
<br>
Promoter Michael Gudinski said the Born to Run rocker was “knocked out” 
by the demand for tickets in Perth and agreed to fly into town a few 
days earlier to accommodate the extra gig.<br>
<br>
He kicked off the tour with his first-ever show in South Africa in Cape Town on January 28.<br>
<br>
Fans lucky enough to score tickets to the Perth Arena shows won’t have 
to ruin their concert experience by trying to record it on their mobile 
phones.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is giving fans the chance to enjoy his shows at home by selling instant downloads of his gigs.<br>
<br>
Fans can buy USB wristbands on the internet or at one of his concerts. 
These allow them to download a concert of their choice hours after the 
event and watch it online.<br>
<br>
Springsteen released his 18th studio album, High Hopes, on January 17 ahead of his world tour.<br>
<br>
High Hopes mixes unreleased originals and covers from the past decade 
with live fan favourites from the 2013’s Wrecking Ball tour.<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen promises to keep surprises coming for Australia<br>
The Sydney Morning Herald<br>
February 5, 2014 <br>
 Corey Stephenson<br>
<br>
<br>
Up close and personal: Bruce Springsteen has said of his upcoming 
Australian tour that there will still be an element of surprise. <br>
Back in Australia less than a year after his Wrecking Ball tour smashed 
the country, Bruce Springsteen has assured fans he hasn't just returned 
to visit places he missed, he's here to keep surprising his audience. <br>
<br>
Speaking on stage in Perth after a media-exclusive sound check of Dream 
Baby Dream, Springsteen said that even the fans that followed him across
 Australia in 2013 would be kept guessing and that no night would ever 
be the same.<br>
<br>
"I don't have any approach to it except to keep changing it up."<br>
<br>
"And even if you've seen many, many of the shows, there's going to be a moment when I surprise you, which is what I try to do." <br>
<br>
The band played the Suicide's cover, recently released on new album High Hopes.<br>
<br>
When asked if he was planning any more Australian covers after also 
releasing a version of The Saints' Just Like Fire Would, which first 
featured on the Wrecking Ball tour in Brisbane, Springsteen said he 
didn't know. He even took suggestions for which Aussie song to consider.<br>
<br>
Springsteen also said the release of High Hopes before the tour meant 
that he wasn't sure if any Australian or New Zealand audiences would 
hear a full album played like a few European shows had last year.<br>
<br>
"I don't know, I pull that out once in a while ... but we have some new 
stuff and I still feel like we have a fresh audience for it, that we're 
gonna keep changing it up every night."<br>
<br>
Also back on stage is long-time friend and E Street guitarist Stevie Van
 Zandt, whose filming commitments meant he was replaced for the 
Australia tour with Tom Morello of Rage Against The Machine.<br>
<br>
It was Morello's addition to the band and his fresh approach to some of 
Springsteen’s tracks that led to the release of High Hopes, a collection
 of reworked tracks, covers and older songs recorded with late E Street 
alumni Danny Federici and Clarence Clemons.<br>
<br>
On his first ever concert in Western Australia, Springsteen said the 
$550 million Perth Arena narrowly missed out on the last tour.<br>
<br>
"I took so long to come to Perth ... because Perth is so very far away." <br>
<br>
This time Perth welcomes Springsteen and The E Street Band for three 
sold-out shows before they travel to Adelaide, another city eagerly 
awaiting The Boss' debut after more than 40 years in the music industry.<br>
<br>
"This is a six-week tour," he said.<br>
<br>
"I haven't done a six-week tour since ... I'd have to go back to my 30s.
 This is the longest stretch away from home ... for 20 years."<br>
<br>
After return visits to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, with a weekend 
stop in the Hunter Valley, the tour moves to New Zealand for two dates 
at Auckland’s Mt Smart Stadium.</div>
