THE NEW YORK TIMES</strong><br>
<br>
September 17, 2012<br>
<br>
By MATT RICHTEL<br>
<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">The Rangers had a homecoming<br>
In Harlem late last night<br>
The magic rat drove his sleek machine<br>
Over the Jersey state line</em><br>
<br>
“Jungleland,” from Bruce Springsteen’s 1975 album “Born to Run.”<br>
<br>
I first heard “Born to Run” on a cassette that my buddy Noel made me in 
the summer of 1984, nearly a decade after the album came out. I was late
 to the Springsteen party but I’ve well more than hung around.<br>
Early on, I didn’t much analyze why I liked him. He was cool. He wasn’t 
Cyndi Lauper. I can picture our group of seven guys in high school, 
gathered in a basement, putting our heads back and singing “Badlands” at
 the top of our lungs.<br>
In retrospect, I think Springsteen let us be guys while still giving us 
permission to feel. Something inimitable in the combination of lyrics 
and music and that rugged, edgy voice let us retain the aura of cool, 
brave – whatever we imagined we should be – but still be on our knees 
begging for mercy. He could make me want to die with someone in an 
everlasting kiss and yet feel, far from a whiny romantic, like Gen. 
George Patton tilting at adolescence.<br>
Or like one of Patton’s men. Springsteen seemed so confident in owning 
his yearning, in his candor, that how could we not follow him into 
battle?<br>
It’s also taken a third of a lifetime to appreciate another aspect of 
Springsteen’s genius: his best stuff shows and doesn’t tell. “Rosalita” 
took me to a bar down San Diego way. “Jungleland,” my favorite on any 
given day, showed me the magic rat and the barefoot girl on the hood of 
the Dodge.<br>
By telling stories, not spouting adages or commands, he let me fill in 
the blanks, interpret, reach my own conclusions about life, keep my 
dignity intact.<br>
He turns 63 this week. A gift to us.<br>
Yet I’ve been thinking about whether something has changed with him. Or with me. I’m not connecting with him the way I used to.<br>
I am slightly less wowed by his new stuff, for a decade or more. I still
 play the albums out, sure. I just don’t feel the way I once did. I’m 
older. Not surrounded by the guys in the basement. How much can you take
 on the night when you’re cranking up the stereo in the Volvo to three?<br>
This is so, even though Springsteen is more polished than ever as a 
musician. Given that his pocket is a few years shy of a Social Security 
card, he’s more astounding on stage. His peerless muse has neither 
boundaries nor fatigue.<br>
He’s more political for sure, something I’m hardly the first to observe.
 The 2007 album “Magic” took on the Bush administration, “The Rising,” 
dealt with the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. “Wrecking Ball,”
 which came out earlier this year, has big, catchy anthems, explosive 
reminders of economic hardship and resilience, but it tends to miss 
details, characters, the hollows and images where I can insert myself 
and interpret. On the whole, it feels less personal to me.<br>
Springsteen’s been very frank about his evolution, talking about how 
artists need to reinvent themselves, and about his feeling of 
responsibility to the world, his community.<br>
I wonder how easy it is for him, for any artist at his stage and station
 of life, even for the listener, to fully connect with the rawness of 
everyday life – given the stability, spouse and children. He’s far 
removed, I presume, from the injuries that drove him four decades ago.<br>
I personally find it a little harder to connect to politics or ideas, 
which tend to be informed by true emotion but are not its equal.<br>
And while Springsteen still introduces us to characters, there are more 
pronouncements, packaged less as narrative than lesson. In “Land of Hope
 and Dreams,” he writes about a train bound for glory that “carries 
saints and sinners, losers and winners.” It’s incredibly catchy but I 
feel more like a pupil than a camper swept up in a ghost story.<br>
I guess it’s not so much that I miss Springsteen. He’s a genius out 
there doing his thing, what feels right, and more power to him. But I do
 miss us.<br>
And I need us. Who else but Springsteen could bring the kind of 
catharsis and belonging that he brought to adolescence, to parenting, 
marriage, frailty? Who else could match music to quirky characters, 
idiosyncratic and pointed images, gritty settings, so that I could be 
swept up, taken on a final journey, shown, not told, and, in turn, able 
to lose myself completely but keep my dignity intact?<br>
When I’m in the Volvo with the two car seats in the back, I listen to 
whatever Springsteen is handy, old or new. The old stories never get 
old, even keep revealing themselves. The newer stuff still beats just 
about anything else going. The children like “Land of Hope and Dreams.” 
They call it “the train song.” They like songs about trains.<br>
It’s just I feel like we’ve got another gear, Springsteen and me. I want
 to hear him weave his stories, our stories, stories, then, overcome, 
leap to my feet and tilt with him at mortality.</div>

<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen:</strong> This man right 
here dragged me through the longest four hours of my life. Whenever I 
think of you I think of pain. Wow we’re on film already. I’m not ready I
 need to be beautified.Here we are, you dragged your arse a long way may
 I say, all the way up here! Thank you.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Molly Meldrum</strong>: It’s a beautiful 
place.You could live anywhere in the world. Without sounding offensive, 
this is like the old MacDonald had a farm. Here’s this amazing farm with
 goats. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen</strong>: Does that make me old MacDonald?<br>
Molly Meldrum: No, no old MacDonald had a farm.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen</strong>: Well there are 
goats out there yes there are and some chickens also. We enjoy it. I 
grew up ten minutes from here. The house I recorded Nebraska in is five 
minutes this way.<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Molly Meldrum</strong>: The Darkness  recording session was filmed three decades ago, a few miles from here ?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen</strong>: Yeah. We had a 
big box of things we didn’t know what it was and in it we found all this
 footage from the recording of darkness on the edge of town which makes 
up half the picture and shows all these skinny little 27 year old kids 
trying to come up with their masterpiece in the studios. When I saw the 
documentary I went in into shock because I never dreamed that I was that
 skinny, that these guys were that skinny.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Molly Meldrum</strong>: Is it strange to look back and see yourself at that age?<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen</strong>: I look a lot 
like my son so it was interesting. My sons are close, 20 and 16 and some
 of the scenes you’re just a dead ringer for your kids you know.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Molly Meldrum:</strong> Some times it looks  tense. And other times it’s loose and carefree. It was just after the celebrated lawsuit…..<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen</strong>: It was very rough at the time. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Molly Meldrum</strong>: I have always loved the title track.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen</strong>: Out of all the songs I’ ve written- that’s way, way up near the top as one of my favourites.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Molly Meldrum:</strong> Would it be fair to say that you didn’t like becoming a rock star?<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen</strong>: There’s a lot a lot of rock stars always will be. I don’t mind being that but I don’t want to be just that.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Molly Meldrum</strong>: Did you like making videos?<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen:</strong> I would have 
been fine if there were never any videos personally really I’ve enjoyed 
making them over the years it was one of the things I did over the years
 because it became a way to get your music exposed I wasn’t driven to be
 a video maker. You look at the two times we had catastrophic success it
 was Born to Run and Born in the USA and after both of those times I 
kind of stopped and reflected. I wasn’t so concerned with the 
perpetuation of hit records of what it meant to who I was, who I wanted 
to be and what kind of music, I wanted to make where I wanted to go.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Molly Meldrum:</strong> When the kids see the documentary do they say look at dad there?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen:</strong> They don’t 
bother watching it. You have to respect the divine right of kids to 
ignore their parents that’s very important. Kids don’t want to go and 
see thousands cheering their mother and father its your worst nightmare.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Molly Meldrum:</strong> What advice would you give a young band today?<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen</strong>: It’s good to 
learn to play live. One suggestion to young musicians is to develop a 
flame throwing live show because that’s an important connection. There 
isn’t a night you go out on a stage of any size and you don’t realise 
that I am a guy who plays a guitar for a living. I am a lucky guy.</div>

<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Bruce Springsteen at the Honda Center in Anaheim</span><br>
<br>
Honda Center, Anaheim<br>
<br>
(Tuesday, Dec. 4)<br>
<br>
Epic" is one of those superlatives whose meaning has been watered down 
in our culture to the point of near-uselessness: like "awesome," 
"hilarious" or "superstar." But to blazes with hyperbole: Tuesday 
night’s concert by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band was epic, 
arguably their best local show since the mid-’80s glory days.<br>
<br>
Obama Brokers Peace Between Chris Christie and Bruce Springsteen<br>
Forget the notion of a band cruising on a tour’s second leg, this 
sold-out Honda Center gig was longer, more energetic, more fun, more … 
everything than Springsteen’s L.A. show in April. And that one was very 
good. No, this 28-song, 3½-hour intermissionless marathon brought old 
fans back to the times of a quarter-century and more ago when singer, 
band and crowd bonded in ways rarely experienced in rock history. Sheer 
symbiosis.<br>
“Something for everybody” -- another overused phrase that abuts cliche, 
except when it’s entirely merited. Consider: The oldest-school fans got 
songs from the first two albums, the die-hards got deep cuts, the pop 
fans got “Hungry Heart” and “Dancing in the Dark,” the kiddies got 
“Waitin’ on a Sunny Day,” the folkies got tunes recalling or inspired by
 Seeger and Guthrie, the scholarly got Steinbeck, the soulsters got 
“Raise Your Hand,” and the catnip encore of megahits -- including “Santa
 Claus Is Comin’ to Town” -- was for, well, everyone. Springsteen even 
regaled the crowd in a funny story, a tactic rarely deployed in recent 
years.<br>
There were all manner of tricks of the arena trade: call-and-response, 
name-checking the tour stop, bringing fans onstage, cruising through the
 crowd, slapping hands, huge sing-alongs. Yes, Springsteen still engages
 an audience as well as anyone. At 63, he is as fit and more fiery on 
the boards than folks half his age, even leaping atop the piano and 
doing a yoga-like back-bend that must have made some in the 
well-seasoned crowd feel it in their knees.<br>
The wildly entertaining throwback show ultimately was about two things: 
passion and branding for the next career phase. Emphasizing the former 
is important, but pointing out the latter is not a jab. Rather, it’s 
noteworthy because it is apparent that Bruce Springsteen and the E 
Street Band are back in it for the long haul. And they want the audience
 to know it.<br>
Who knows how many in the crowd were seeing him and the band for the 
first time, but anyone who was had to come away impressed. That’s how 
careers are sustained. Springsteen was careful to court the young’uns --
 a relative term, of course, but one that could more broadly include 
folks from 5 to 40 on the fringe of fandom.<br>
For example, he brought a young girl onstage to dance and sing a couple 
choruses of “Waitin’ on a Sunny Day.” She now likely is a lifelong fan; 
Springsteen even went out of his way to make sure the kid got a guitar 
pick as a memento. And bringing SoCal honchos Mike Ness and Tom Morello 
onstage -- the latter for a half-dozen songs -- might help bridge a 
couple of potential generational gaps. <br>
He also played up the Orange County angle. “Anaheim!” Springsteen 
shouted as he introduced O.C. OG Ness before a run-through of “Bad 
Luck,” from Fullerton’s own Social Distortion. They rather slogged 
though the song, but point made: Bruce played with Mike Ness in Orange 
County. He’s cool!<br>
Later, Springsteen said: “I’m so glad to be here tonight in Anaheim. I’m
 going to Disneyland!” With that he launched into a yarn about how he 
and bandmate Steven Van Zandt went to the Happiest Place on Earth at the
 “height of our mega-stardom.” Inside Disneyland, an official told them,
 “You can’t stay in the park dressed like that!” Said Springsteen: “It 
was 1985; I had my bandanna on. So we left and said, ‘We’re going to 
Knott’s Berry Farm!’ " After a pause for knowing cheers, he added, “They
 wouldn’t even let us in there.”<br>
Classic Bruce.<br>
So maybe “rebranding for the future” is a more descriptive term. 
Although implied by some song choices, politics was never mentioned at 
this show Behind the Orange Curtain, where his fellow Democrats don’t 
exactly rule. After being all but joined at President Obama’s hip during
 the last days of the bitterly contested presidential campaign, 
Springsteen knew it was time to take the focus off his politics and put 
it squarely back where it belongs: onstage.<br>
The old “revival” description of Springsteen’s shows was in full force. 
(After a particularly fiesty number, Springsteen leaned the mike down to
 a coached fan who asked the singer, “Did you feel the spirit?”) And 
there were many musical highlights. Among them: “Reason to Believe” was 
transformed into an ancient blues, fueled by a ZZ Top-like growling 
guitar riff; “Darlington County” drew a huge shout-along for its 
repeated “sha-la-las”; and “The Ghost of Tom Joad” unleashed Morello’s 
inner Rage with an enormous solo.<br>
The gig again spotlighted several songs from this year’s Wrecking Ball 
album, though not as many as in April (among the jettisoned were “Rocky 
Ground,” thankfully, and “Jack of All Trades,” regrettably). But this 
time it wasn’t the focus. No, that would be The Catalog. The show 
touched 11 of Springsteen’s 17 studio albums.<br>
Perhaps the most telling inclusion on the set list this go-round was 
“Jungleland,” which features the most iconic solo by Springsteen’s late 
longtime saxman Clarence Clemons. The band, still getting its footing 
after being bulked up, likely didn't feel ready to play the fan favorite
 early in the tour eight months ago. But Clemons’ nephew Jake Clemons is
 a full-on E Streeter now, and he wailed through the song, not copying 
the solo but adding and subtracting just enough to make it his own. And 
of course, he got the disproportionate cheer that always greeted his 
uncle’s spotlight time.<br>
There was audible shushing amidst the crowd during “Jungleland’s” 
super-quiet climax, which was shattered by Springsteen’s most 
full-throated, primal vocal of the night: that singular and extended 
yell/roar that brings the song to its close. He absolutely killed it. 
Again, epic.<br>
Springsteen opened and closed the show with the same phrase: “Are you 
ready to be transformed?” It's easy to imagine the exhausted crowd 
replying: "Yes and yes. Again and again." See you next time, Bruce.<br>
<br>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Springsteen’s former girlfriend was student at KSU</strong><br>
<br>
By Bob Dyer  Beacon Journal columnist<br>
Published: February 25, 2013<br>
<br>
After all these years, I thought I had read and heard everything there 
was to read and hear about the 1970 shootings at Kent State.<br>
I hadn’t. And you haven’t, either, unless you’ve read Bruce, a marvelous new biography of rock ’n’ roll icon Bruce Springsteen.<br>
In the midst of its 475 pages, we discover that one of the students in 
the crowd on that awful May day was ... Springsteen’s girlfriend.<br>
Pam Bracken was finishing her sophomore year at Kent State when the 
school earned a permanent spot in American History textbooks. She was 
close enough to the action to see victims falling.<br>
She was horrified, and to this day tears up whenever she talks about it.<br>
Bracken returned to Kent State in the fall but soon transferred to 
Monmouth University in New Jersey, primarily to be closer to 
Springsteen. The two had been hot and heavy throughout the summer of 
1970, and she was frustrated when the relationship became long-distance.<br>
Bruce and Pam first hooked up the previous summer at a little club in 
Asbury Park, N.J., less than 10 miles from her hometown of Little 
Silver. Although far from a household name at that point, he was already
 a hero on the Jersey Shore, where he had appeared regularly with 
various bands.<br>
Pam liked the fact that he didn’t act like a typical rock star. In those
 days, he didn’t drink, didn’t do drugs, didn’t even swear. Nor did he 
seem full of himself.<br>
They were an item for more than two years, off and on — the “offs” and “ons” too numerous to count.<br>
“Bruce was and is a wonderful person,” Bracken says by phone from her 
father’s house in Santa Barbara, Calif. “Even though our relationship 
was rocky, there were many sweet moments.”<br>
The rocky ones were not mere pebbles.<br>
Unlike the dozens of reverential tomes by writers who analyzed 
Springsteen from afar, the author of Bruce, Peter Ames Carlin, had the 
superstar’s full cooperation. But this was not an “authorized” 
biography, so Carlin was free to paint a complete portrait of the man, 
warts and all.<br>
Never are Springsteen’s warts more evident than in his dealings with Pamela J. Bracken.<br>
As the author wrote, Springsteen, circa 1970, was “something other than an early adopter of feminist principles.”<br>
One of the most jarring stories involves a confrontation Springsteen had
 with Bracken shortly after she discovered that he had, shall we say, 
“provided comfort” to a female acquaintance who had just broken up with a
 boyfriend. The revelation resulted in a screaming match that culminated
 with Bruce slapping Bracken in the face.<br>
She ran out the door and down the street. Bruce ran after her, yelling 
apologies and claiming he only smacked her because he thought that if he
 didn’t she would become “hysterical.”<br>
Nice logic, Bruce.<br>
That was the chief indiscretion among many during the years she was his 
main squeeze. Most of the problems involved additional squeezes.<br>
Bruce wanted to have things both ways. Wrote Carlin: “As desperate for 
the comforts of emotional intimacy as he was terrified by its 
requirements, Bruce veered between fits of jealousy and barely secret 
bouts of faithlessness.”<br>
Bracken concurs. “I don’t regret having had the relationship. I just wish I had been stronger to walk away and stay away.”<br>
By Columbus Day 1972 (after Bruce had landed his first record contract),
 Bracken had had enough. She told Springsteen she just couldn’t take it 
any more.<br>
Best and worst<br>
From a distance of four decades, Pam assesses her years with Bruce as 
“the most wonderful time in my life and also the most hellish.<br>
“To date somebody in the music industry is very, very difficult. There’s
 a thousand girls in the world and they all have an ulterior motive. You
 didn’t know who really was your friend and who just was trying to get 
close to you to get close to him.<br>
“I said to him a long time ago that I wish he had decided to become a 
writer and not a musician so I didn’t have to share him with the rest of
 the world.”<br>
Perhaps, Ms. Bracken, you are simply unfamiliar with writer groupies?<br>
She laughs and continues. “He was such a great storyteller and he wrote 
such wonderful stuff. You could just sit there and listen to him for 
hours, and I think that’s why so many people gravitate to him.<br>
“He is just very engaging, and he can really make you laugh.”<br>
Father figure<br>
She says Bruce reminded her of her father, who had the same qualities.<br>
Ironically, as the traumatic breakups continued to mount, Bracken’s 
parents were anything but Springsteen fans. Bruce would call the house 
asking for Pam, and her mother would tell him to never call again. Her 
father was so adamant about ending the relationship that it caused a big
 rift between father and daughter.<br>
“Of course, when my father talks about him now, he’s some fabulous person,” she jokes.<br>
Until Bracken agreed to talk to the author of Bruce, she had never 
spoken with a writer about her Springsteen days. Your favorite columnist
 (who got her number from Carlin) is the second — but it wasn’t easy.<br>
Although we ended up talking for nearly an hour one night, she didn’t 
call back until after my third voice mail. She says her reluctance 
stemmed from me telling her I wanted to talk about Kent State. She was 
not at all certain she “wanted to go there in my head again.”<br>
May 4 horror<br>
On May 4, 1970, Bracken was on her way to French class, textbook in 
hand, when she stopped on the hill overlooking the Commons and watched 
as the rally turned into a riot.<br>
After catching a snootful of tear gas, she sprinted to a dorm. When she 
turned around, she saw the guns firing and people falling.<br>
The campus switchboard was overwhelmed, so she couldn’t call her parents
 or boyfriend. She rounded up three friends and drove her car to a farm 
owned by the grandmother of one of the friends.<br>
“I didn’t know where else to go, and neither did anybody else. We 
couldn’t call our families because there were no phones. It was 
horrible.”<br>
She remembers taking her finals by mail, and then driving back in the 
summer to pick up the belongings she had left when the students were 
hustled out of town.<br>
So what attracted a Jersey girl to Kent State? A family friend was enrolled there; Pam visited and felt comfortable.<br>
Until the shootings, “I loved the place. I was in the new dorm — 
Tri-Towers. It had only been open a year, and in my second year I was in
 the same dorm, same room.”<br>
Famous pal<br>
Among her good friends at the time: a dorm mate from Akron named Chrissie Hynde.<br>
Hynde had not yet joined a band, much less become famous. The two grew tight.<br>
“She was somewhat bizarre,” Bracken recalls. “I thought she was 
amazingly beautiful. She had the same look she’s had all these years.<br>
“When she was young, she was just incredibly gorgeous. She had beautiful skin.”<br>
Today Bracken (who declined to send a photo, either ancient or 
contemporary) lives in Orange County, Calif., and works as an escrow 
agent, a job she has held for three decades. She never married or had 
kids.<br>
“I just was a serial dater,” she says with a laugh. “Every relationship,
 three or four years was my max and then I had to move on to somebody 
else.<br>
“Some people just aren’t made [for marriage]. It wasn’t like I wasn’t 
asked. I just didn’t see myself spending my life with somebody.<br>
“I kind of regret not having children. I do have a large family around 
me, lots of nieces who keep getting married, so that’s fun.”<br>
She hasn’t talked to Springsteen since the late 1980s, when she went 
backstage after a California concert. Although their meeting was 
pleasant, the “girlfriend of the moment” was there, she says, along with
 a slew of other people, so it wasn’t ideal.<br>
Bracken hasn’t read the new book. Why not? Because she realized after 
her interview with Carlin that the majority of her comments sounded 
negative, which is not the way she looks back on things.<br>
Asked whether Springsteen is an extremely complex guy, she replies, “Yeah, but basically a really, really good guy.”</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">FROM THE CHARLIE ROSE INTERVIEW 1998</strong><br>
My music, because of what I wrote about, always had political 
implications. I suppose that came up originally out of my home life, my 
experience growing up, and my relationship with my father. And trying to
 understand the concept of work, and how work plays a central role in 
your life. I had two real, very different examples. My mother’s relation
 to work was very joyous. Very happy. It provided the entire family with
 stability. What she gained from it was an entire mode of behavior. You 
get up in the morning, at a certain time. You prepare yourself. You get 
yourself ready to go to a job. You walk down the street and you’re there
 at a particular time of the day. And you interact with your co-workers.
 And that’s a big part of your social life, your work life, and your 
place in the world. You’re doing something that has a purpose. There’s a
 reason you’re there besides just feeding your family. You’re a part of 
the social fabric. You’re what’s holding the world together. You’re 
what’s holding the town together, that’s holding your family together. I
 always remember that she walked with tremendous pride and strength, 
enormous strength, and it gave such great comfort, such great great 
comfort to a child. That makes sense. I understand that.<br>
<br>
My dad had a different experience. Work was involved with pain. He lost 
his hearing when he worked in a plastics factory. Lost a lot of his 
hearing. He struggled to find work and go to work. The regulation of 
behavior that work provides wasn’t a big part of his life, and that was 
painful for everybody involved.<br>
<br>
That’s essential. That’s central to the way that we live and think about
 ourselves, and who we are, and the place we live in. And so I saw both 
sides of it. I saw what happens when that’s not present there is pain, 
and there is anger. And deep, deep … it’s a destructive force. You 
wither away. You waste away. You don’t know where you’re going or who 
you are, and you take that out on the people that you care about. And 
that’s something you don’t want to do. But it happens.<br>
<br>
So that’s what I wrote about. That was really really important. It’s the
 single thing that I’ve written about, my entire life, that fundamental 
idea. The importance of that idea in society. The cost of not providing 
that for … whether it’s for people to be able to take care of their 
families, to have productive jobs. The debasement of ourselves, in not 
having a society where that’s provided to all our citizens.<br>
<br>
It all grew from there. It grew from my experience, and my trying to 
sort out my experience. I didn’t grow up in a political household. I 
didn’t have some particular ideology, or be a political person from 
where I came from, but I needed and wanted to write about those things 
because they were essential. A lot of my music has grown out of that 
place over the years.</div>
