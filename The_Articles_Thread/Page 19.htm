<br>
March, 24 2012<br>
<br>
Orlando Sentinel</strong><br>
 <br>
That phrase, delivered as a spiritual incantation in the title track of 
Bruce Springsteen’s latest album, is a theme that’s often played out in 
his music.<br>
Springsteen’s songs always have been powered by a combination of hard 
times and joy – and the mixture was as potent as ever in a generous, 
age-defiant 2 hours and 50 minutes for a packed house on Friday at the 
Tampa Bay Times Forum.<br>
The show was the only Florida stop by the Boss and the E Street Band on 
the opening leg of its Wrecking Ball tour, the first since the death of 
one of the group’s defining members, saxophonist Clarence Clemons. 
Springsteen found ways to acknowledge the Big Man, his longtime on-stage
 foil, all night – in ways subtle and grandly symbolic.<br>
“We’re here with some old friends and some new ones,” Springsteen told 
the crowd in the early going, “but the mission of the E Street Band 
remains the same: To bring the glorious power of music and shoot it 
straight into your heart tonight.”<br>
On Friday, the man’s aim was true.<br>
At 62, Springsteen couldn’t be more skilled at his craft. Not many rock 
stars of his vintage could open the show with a salvo of songs from a 
new album that worked as powerfully as “We Take Care of Our Own” and 
“Wrecking Ball.”<br>
The former, bolstered by a 5-piece horn section, was an arena-ready 
anthem that downshifted ambitiously – and effectively – into the 
understated introduction of “Wrecking Ball,” which hushed the crowd in 
the verses and encouraged fist-pumping in its exuberant chorus.<br>
An old favorite, “Prove It All Night,” turned the spotlight on one of 
the new friends, saxophonist Jake Clemons, the Big Man’s nephew. His 
spot-on solo was an intense and joyous moment for fans that look at the E
 Street Band as extended family as much as a musical ensemble.<br>
There were plenty of those electric moments in that one song alone, 
ranging from the Boss and lifelong pal Steven Van Zandt sharing the 
microphone in the final chorus to Springsteen pulling a broken guitar 
string off his instrument to hand to a fan in the front row.<br>
Springsteen introduced the band in an R&amp;B flavored “My City of 
Ruins,” recognizing Van Zandt, guitarist Nils Lofgren, pianist Roy 
Bittan, drummer Max Weinberg, singer-guitarist Patti Scialfa, bassist 
Garry Tallent, violinist Soozie Tyrell and keyboardist Charlie Giordano,
 the latter in the slot left vacant by the death of Danny Federici in 
2008.<br>
“Are we missing anybody?” Springsteen shouted, another Clemons reference
 as a spotlight shone on his empty place on stage. “If you’re here and 
we’re here, they’re here,” he said of the missing musicians.<br>
If all this sounds maudlin, it wasn’t. The band rocked rambunctiously on
 “Waiting on a Sunny Day,” “The Promised Land” and a doo-wop 
wall-of-sound version of the Temptations’ “The Way You Do the Things You
 Do.” On Wilson Pickett’s “634-5789,” Springsteen crowd-surfed back to 
the stage from a platform in the middle of the floor, obviously 
forgetting his age in a senior moment.<br>
There were serious moments, most notably “American Skin (41 Shots),” 
Springsteen’s song about the police shooting of unarmed New York 
resident in 1999. Springsteen delivered it without comment, but the line
 about getting “killed just for living in your American skin” hit hard 
in the wake of the killing of Sanford teen Trayvon Martin.<br>
In the end, however, the show was about savoring happiness amid the 
tough times, a lesson hammered home in the glorious finale of “Born to 
Run,” “Dancing in the Dark,” “Glory Days” and “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out.”
 The latter was halted for one last long ovation for the Big Man.<br>
“Tonight is about hellos and goodbyes,” Springsteen said, “the things that leave us and the things that remain.”<br>
Obviously, fans will mourn the losses, but what remains is worth celebrating.</div>

				<div class="content">"Springsteen is still searching for love and salvation"<br>
<br>
Human Touch * * * 1/2<br>
Lucky Town * * * *<br>
<br>
Chicago Tribune , March 29,  1992<br>
By Greg Kot<br>
<br>
With his first album in 4 and 1/2 years, Bruce Springsteen doesn't 
reinvent himself or his art, but tries to cut to their essence. With 
"Human Touch," he approaches the level of his best work, on "Lucky Town"
 he equals it.<br>
<br>
"Human Touch" was recorded with numerous outside musicians at several 
Los Angeles studios, and it is the more overtly "commercial" of the two 
albums. After it was completed, Springsteen continued to write songs, 
playing most of the instruments and recording at his home studio in L.A.
 The resulting album, "Lucky Town," is one of his greatest.<br>
<br>
Of the 14 songs of "Human Touch," Springsteen asserts his knowledge and 
mastery of the tradition he works in, a synthesis of 60's rock and soul 
seasoned with a jazzy mood piece ("With Every Wish") and an acoustic 
reworking of a traditional ballad ("Pony Boy"). Like his 1984 
blockbuster "Born in the USA," many of his songs sound tailor-made for a
 stadium tour.<br>
<br>
Much was made of Springsteen's decision to part ways with his longtime E
 Street Band, but on "Human Touch" drummer Jeff Porcaro and bassist 
Randy Jackson (abetted by E Street pianist Roy Bittan) sound like an E 
Street replica. Porcaro in particular could pass for longtime 
Springsteen drummer Max Weinberg, with his terse style and rifle-shot 
snare.<br>
<br>
The album's deepest impression, however, is made by the singers. In the 
past, Springsteen tended to mumble on the ballads and rush through the 
rockers. But here he sings with clarity and force, even as he is pushed 
to the emotional brink by guest vocalists such as soul veteran Bobby 
King, Sam Moore (of Sam and Dave) and Bobby Hatfield (of the Righteous 
Brothers).<br>
<br>
Lyrically, "Human Touch" picks up where Springsteen's last studio album,
 "Tunnel of Love," left off in 1987, exploring the ambiguity and doubt 
that erode the ideal of ever-lasting love. With the 6 and 1/2 minute 
title track, a soul-fired rocker, Springsteen establishes the album's 
premise - that all we can ask of love is temporary shelter - then 
explores it from many stylistic and emotional angles through the album's
 first half.<br>
<br>
With the rockabilly-flavored "57 Channels (And Nothin' On)," the 
churning "Gloria's Eyes," and the jazzy "With Every Wish," Springsteen 
suggest that love can never outlast our restlessness, that security and 
permanence are illusions. The sexually charged "Cross My Heart," "Soul 
Driver," and "Roll of the Dice" imply that even in this imperfect and 
impermanent state, love is worth it all anyway. But with "Man's Job" and
 "Real Man," Springsteen's writing falters ("... takin' care of you 
darlin'/Ain't for one of the boys" he sings on "Man's Job"), and these 
clich?s make the last half of the album a bumpier ride.<br>
<br>
If "Human Touch" could stand a little pruning, "Lucky Town" is a model 
of concision and coherence. Its ten songs are sparse lyrically and 
instrumentally, and - like all great albums, from "The Band" to "Blood 
on the Tracks" ? they are almost unimaginable without each other. Each 
song resonates more deeply because of those that immediately precede and
 follow it.<br>
<br>
Ironically, the big-rock songs on "Human Touch" are introspective, 
preoccupied with small victories and momentary respite from a world 
spinning out of the singer's reach. On "Lucky Town," however, the singer
 plunges outward, even as the music becomes more intimate. The album is 
soaked in blues and country influences, and made even earthier by the 
twangy affectations in Springsteen's voice. "But it's a sad man my 
friend, who's livin' in his own skin/And can't stand the company," 
Springsteen sings on the first track, "Better Days."<br>
<br>
One listener who had heard the album months ago compared its theme to 
that of the recent movie "Grand Canyon," and drew a parallel between 
Springsteen's "sad man" and the character played by Kevin Kline. In the 
movie, Kline's life has sunken into mid-life malaise, only to be 
transformed by a stranger's act of courage. Springsteen's script isn't 
nearly as unbelievable or maudlin as much of the film's, but the 
comparison is apt.<br>
<br>
The search for redemption begins at the bottom of "The Big Muddy," which
 conjures up the doom- ridden blues of Robert Johnson. One can 
practically hear the flies buzzing around a carcass in the Delta swamp. 
"Waist deep in the big muddy," Springsteen moans, "you start up on 
higher ground but end up somehow crawlin' in."<br>
<br>
He is pulled from the muck in "The Living Proof," in which the love of a
 woman is compared to godliness. Two beautiful ballads, "Book of Dreams"
 and the hymn-like "If I Should Fall Behind" are like prayers of thanks.
 "Tonight I'm drinkin' in the forgiveness/This life provides," 
Springsteen sings on the former.<br>
<br>
The album concludes with two songs that are emotional book-ends. "Souls 
of the Departed" is a blistering indictment of a world too corrupt to 
save itself, and not even the singer is spared: "Now I ply my trade in 
the land of king dollar/Where you get paid and your silence passes as 
honor," he wails, before an abrasive guitar solo.<br>
<br>
Then, in "My Beautiful Reward," the spare elegance of Springsteen's 
verse takes on the healing power of poetry, bringing the album full 
circle:<br>
<br>
"Tonight I can feel the cold wind at my back I'm flyin' high over gray 
fields, my feathers long and black Down along the river's silent edge I 
soar Searching for my beautiful reward" - "My Beautiful Reward," 1992, 
Bruce Springsteen<br>
<br>
It suggests that there may never be a solution to life's anguish, but that the search itself is salvation enough.</div>

<br>
The Daily Record , July 15, 2009<br>
By John Dingwall<br>
<br>
Scottish football got a new Boss last night - as Bruce Springsteen gave a rock history lesson to 55,000 fans at Hampden Park.<br>
<br>
The man behind hits such as Born In The USA played for a sweat-soaked three hours at the home of Scottish football.<br>
<br>
And his set list included songs spanning a remarkable five decades.<br>
<br>
Bruce, 59, was back in Scotland with his famed E Street Band, including 
musical director Steven Van Zandt - aka Silvio from The Sopranos.<br>
<br>
His sellout European tour included a great performance at the Glastonbury Festival a fortnight ago.<br>
<br>
The Boss led the band into Badlands with a cry of: "Is there anybody alive at Hampden."<br>
<br>
He then told fans: "Good evening Glasgow, hello Scotland. It's good to be back.<br>
<br>
"The mighty E Street Band have come thousands of miles just to be here 
tonight to fulfil our solemn vow to rock the house. But we're gonna need
 help and that's why we're going to build a house here in Glasgow.<br>
<br>
"We want to take the fear that's out there and build a house of hope. We
 want to take the hurt and build a house of sexual healing.<br>
<br>
"We want to take the blues and sadness that''s out there and build a 
house of joy. That's a lot of work so we're gonna need help."<br>
<br>
After a rapturous sing-along throughout their hit-laden set, he told fans: "Good work Glasgow."<br>
<br>
As well as songs from his latest album Working On A Dream and classic 
hits such as The River, and Cover Me, Bruce worked in a request segment.<br>
<br>
He collected placards from fans which included the titles of songs they wanted to hear.<br>
<br>
And he created a new band member, handing the mic to a little girl in a 
cowboy hat to let her lead the chorus of Waiting On A Sunny Day.<br>
<br>
They saved Born To Run until close to the end - before the entire band 
held hands and saluted the crowd that had enjoyed every minute.</div>

				<div class="content">The Boss, Walking the Line at FedEx<br>
<br>
Washington Post , <br>
September,15, 2003<br>
By Joe Heim<br>
<br>
There was little doubt that Bruce Springsteen would play a Johnny Cash 
song at his concert at FedEx Field Saturday night. The loss of the 
country music giant, who died Friday, was clearly on his mind as he and 
the E Street Band -- all dressed entirely in black -- took the stage. 
Without a word to the crowd, the 53-year-old rocker strummed a few 
chords on his acoustic guitar, and a melancholy, haunting version of "I 
Walk the Line" took form.<br>
<br>
Cash and Springsteen have much in common, of course. Both are revered by
 fans not simply for their hits, but for their loyalty, principled 
beliefs and an ability to craft poetry from everyday events and to find 
heroism in the lives of ordinary people. And like Cash, Springsteen 
reaches straight into the hearts of his listeners. He connects with 
them. He makes them feel he is singing about their lives, giving voice 
to their restless spirits and their rebellious, romantic dreams.<br>
<br>
That he was able to do all of that in a soulless bowl like FedEx Field 
is nothing short of amazing. The giant video screens helped, of course. 
Springsteen's every grimace, glower and goofy grin was beamed to even 
the nether reaches of the upper deck. But technology doesn't explain the
 fervor and fever of the crowd as it sang along on "Born to Run," 
stormed through the chorus of "Promised Land" or raised a sea of fists 
to "Badlands." For a little more than three hours Springsteen and his 
never-better, self-described "Viagra-taking, lovemaking, legendary E 
Street Band" created a sense of community and wonder that was as much 
spiritual celebration as rock-and-roll throwdown.<br>
<br>
For all of its soaring moments, though, it is not music meant as an 
escape. The show was the 110th of the tour for "The Rising," a 
monumental CD created in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.
 For the first time on the tour, Springsteen played "Paradise," a 
chilling glimpse into the psyches of both a suicide bomber and the 
spouse of a Pentagon victim. He also didn't shy from political issues. 
"People come to my shows with many different kinds of political 
beliefs," he said. "I like that, we welcome all." With a short laugh he 
added, "Well, maybe with the exception of Dick Cheney. I'm not sure 
about him."<br>
<br>
His comments about the war in Iraq were stronger. Before launching into 
"Born in the USA," he said, "This playing with the truth during wartime 
has been a part of both the Republican and Democratic administrations in
 the past and it is always wrong, never more so than when real lives are
 at stake."<br>
<br>
As serious as he is one moment, Springsteen is loosey-goosey the next. 
He joked with guitarist Nils Lofgren about forgetting the beginning 
chords to "Pink Cadillac," shimmied with saxophonist Clarence Clemons at
 center stage, howled at the moon with guitarist Steven Van Zandt during
 "Ramrod" and, just when it seemed his energy must surely be sapped, 
reignited the venue with a show-closing combo of "Rosalita" and "Dancing
 in the Dark."<br>
<br>
It was a tour de rock-and-roll force, and knowing Springsteen's 
admiration for the Man in Black, it's probably not a stretch to suggest 
the entire concert was a tribute from a living legend to a late one. If 
so, Johnny Cash certainly would have been proud.</div>

				<div class="content">Springsteen pays tribute to victims of West Warwick fire<br>
<br>
Providence Journal , <br>
<br>
March 11, 2003<br>
By Andy Smith<br>
<br>
There is probably no one in popular music who can command a stage with 
the power and joy of Bruce Springsteen. The Boss proved that once again 
last night during a show at the sold-out Dunkin' Donuts Center.<br>
<br>
Although his back-up singer and wife, Patty Scialfa, was missing due to 
illness, it did not seem to slow Springsteen and the superb E Street 
Band.<br>
<br>
Springsteen opened with a political statement, Edwin Starr's "War" 
("War, what is is good for? Absolutely nothin'!"). Concert-goers pumped 
their fists and sang along.<br>
<br>
From there, Springsteen ran through two songs from his new album, The Rising, the title tune, and "Lonesome Day."<br>
<br>
The Rising, the album Springsteen released last year, was his response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.<br>
<br>
But with its persistent imagery of smoke, fire and death, it is all too 
appropriate in the context of last month's disastrous fire at The 
Station in West Warwick.<br>
<br>
The song titles alone paint the picture -- "Into the Fire," "Missing," 
"Lonesome Day." Springsteen's characters are often lost souls trying to 
come to grips with their grief.<br>
<br>
Late in the show, he touched on that theme in a tribute to the victims of The Station nightclub fire.<br>
<br>
Springsteen spoke of starting his career playing in little bars in neighborhoods that each held their own identity.<br>
<br>
He said he had received a card from someone mentioning that yesterday 
was the 30th birthday of one of his fans, Mark Blevins, of South 
Kingstown, who was injured in The Station fire and was discharged last 
weekend from Westerly Hospital.<br>
<br>
In Blevins's name, Springsteen played "Bobby Jean," a song about friendship from 1984's Born in the USA.<br>
<br>
Near the end of the three-hour show, Springsteen invited the crowd to 
make contributions to the Rhode Island Community Food Bank and The 
Station Nightclub Fire Relief Fund, both of whom had representatives in 
the arena lobby.<br>
<br>
Springsteen sang almost all of his current album, The Rising, and also 
delighted the crowd with old favorites such as "Candy's Room," and 
"Spirit in the Night."<br>
<br>
When he started out, Springsteen worshiped the holy trinity of fast cars, Jersey girls and rock 'n' roll.<br>
<br>
At 53, Springsteen seems to have lost his taste for fast cars and he has settled down with his own Jersey girl, Scialfa.<br>
<br>
Music though, maintains its transformative power, and Springsteen 
delivered a potent brand of rock religion to the crowd at the Dunkin' 
Donuts Center. Springsteen presided over the fans like a revival 
preacher, leading the crowd in lusty sing-alongs during "Out in the 
Street" and the new party anthem, "Mary's Place," and joining his band 
in a gospel chorus on "My City in Ruins."<br>
<br>
At the end of the show, Springsteen turned to politics once more. 
Introducing "Born in the USA," he said it was a song about the Vietnam 
War, adding he didn't want to have to write another song like it. "This 
goes out as a prayer for peace, a prayer for the safety of our sons and 
daughters," he said.<br>
<br>
Then he did a harsh, discordant version of the song that for once 
discouraged singing along. He shifted directly into a more hopeful 
vision of America, "Land of Hope and Dreams," reworking the folk song 
"This Train" so these coaches are open to all, and finally closing it 
out with a bit of Curtis Mayfield's "People Get Ready."<br>
<br>
Over his 30-year career, Springsteen has acquired a following of extremely loyal fans.<br>
<br>
Some of them braved a bitter wind yesterday to stand in line outside the
 Dunkin' Donuts Center, hoping to be one of the few hundred lucky souls 
who got to watch the concert from the "pit" directly in front of the 
stage.<br>
<br>
"My goal is to put my elbows on the stage," said Kelly Blodgett, 35, of 
East Lyme, Conn. Blodgett had been waiting on and off since Thursday 
night, her place in line designated by a big "2" inked on the back of 
her hand.<br>
<br>
Alan Mastrangelo (No. 161) of Saugus, Mass., and his sister Sheila 
DiSalvo had been in line since 8:15 yesterday morning. Mastrangelo said 
he's a teacher who used one of his personal days to try and get up close
 and personal with Springsteen.<br>
<br>
Mastrangelo, 55, said he's able to use some of Springsteen's lyrics as 
classroom material, adding it's one of the ways kids and their parents 
can make connections. Dave and Mary Dubosky, of Cumberland, arrived a 
little later, about 12:30 p.m. yesterday.<br>
<br>
"I love the lyrics," Mary Dubosky, 39, said. "As I've gotten older, I've
 seen Bruce become more politically aware, and my politics and his seem 
to jibe pretty well."<br>
<br>
Of course, it's not just politics.<br>
<br>
Dubosky, who now works at Blue Cross, said she used to have a job at the
 Dunk, when it was the Providence Civic Center, and Springsteen was the 
best show she ever saw.<br>
<br>
Last night's concert probably won't change that opinion.</div>

				<div class="content">Springsteen inspires his own Jacksonville roar<br>
<br>
Florida Times-Union , <br>
March 5, 2003<br>
<br>
By Nick Marino<br>
<br>
Whether at football games or rock concerts, Jacksonville audiences have a
 tendency toward sedateness. Any Jags season ticket holder or regular 
concert-goer can testify to that.<br>
<br>
But the roar that came forth as Bruce Springsteen and the E Street band 
finished playing Born To Run Tuesday night at the sold-out Coliseum was 
nothing less than a soul cry. It may have been the loudest sound I've 
ever heard from a Jacksonville crowd at any public gathering.<br>
<br>
People went nuts for this show. I saw grown men hugging in the aisles. I
 saw air guitar. I saw a group of fans in the seats unfurl a giant 
American flag, and I saw a fan on the floor waving the flag of Brazil. I
 saw a father bend over to his young son and point to the stage, as if 
directing the boy to the messiah himself.<br>
<br>
Springsteen has that effect on people. His marathon concerts bring fans 
-- particularly middle-aged white guys -- to a state of overwhelmed 
jubilation that ranks somewhere between hitting a World Series home run 
and holding your newborn infant for the first time.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and his crack band played for 155 minutes Tuesday night, 
giving the faithful all they could have wanted. The show was every bit 
as good as the Orlando performance that sent many-a local Boss fan on a 
road trip down I-95 last November<br>
Much of the setlist was the same. Springsteen again played a generous 
amount of material from his Grammy-winning 2002 album, The Rising, and 
several of the older tunes you'd expect -- Dancing in the Dark, 
Badlands, Born in the U.S.A. and so on.<br>
<br>
He also threw in a few curveballs. From his vast back catalog, he played
 the brooding Tougher Than The Rest and Prove It All Night. He also 
played the classic Thunder Road, which somehow escaped the Orlando 
setlist.<br>
<br>
The most unexpected Jacksonville highlight, though, had to be a loving 
tribute to the late singer/songwriter Hank Ballard, the man who gave us 
The Twist and many others.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and the E Street Band honored Ballard with a joyous, 
piano-heavy trip through Let's Go, Let's Go, Let's Go, a song that 
lacked the typical E Street polish -- Bruce appeared to call out the 
keys as they played -- but nonetheless maintained the band's big-hearted
 vibe.<br>
<br>
That's perhaps the best part about this band: they radiate warmth, 
playing their shows without a shred of irony or pretense or detachment.<br>
<br>
No other arena act so effortlessly and sincerely welcomes the masses to 
its altar. When Springsteen sings "tramps like us. . ." he really means 
the us part. Everyone in the building is part of the community.<br>
<br>
During Mary's Place, Springsteen accurately compared his show to a house party. That's really how it felt in there.<br>
<br>
At most shows, the audience is asked to acknowledge the specialness of 
the performer. Springsteen makes the fans themselves feel special.<br>
<br>
That's a pretty neat trick, enough to inspire hugging and flag-waving. Now if only the '03 Jaguars can do the same.</div>

<br>
Greenville News , <br>
December 10, 2002<br>
By Donna Isbell Walker<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen's concerts have often been described by fans and 
critics as the closest you can get to a secular religious experience, 
and Monday night's performance at the Carolina Center was no different. 
Springsteen was back in the pulpit of the First Church of Rock 'n' Roll 
Monday night, backed by his stellar E Street Band, with a show that took
 fans from the earliest days of his career to his most recent album, the
 Sept. 11-inspired "The Rising," with no shortage of hallelujahs from an
 appreciative audience of 14,000.<br>
<br>
"The Rising" was an appropriate theme for the show, as Springsteen 
evoked the moods of individual Americans and the country as a whole in 
the wake of the terrorist attacks, through his music. Opening with the 
disc's title track, he and the band appeared on a nearly black stage 
illuminated by only a few backing lights, and the song began as a quiet 
gospel-flavored number and built in intensity to full-on revival mode. 
The song waned with a haunting violin solo by Soozie Tyrell, then built 
to a crescendo as it flowed into the second number, "Lonesome Day," also
 from "The Rising."<br>
<br>
The New Jersey native leaned heavily on newer songs for the concert, and
 he made them memorable, in particular the twin hymns of "Empty Sky" and
 "You're Missing." The emotion of losing so much in so short a time was 
evident in his face and voice, and the distance between loved ones when 
one of them has died was embodied by the harmonies of Patti Scialfa, 
Springsteen's wife, who added eerie vocals to the former, making it feel
 as though she was much farther away than just across the stage.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's message was one of the power of love and community, 
blended with some of his strongest tunes of defiance against everyday 
oppressions. That was plenty evident in older songs like "Badlands" and 
"No Surrender," the latter of which could have been interpreted as a 
signal to any number of individuals in power. He bit off the words 
almost angrily as Max Weinberg pounded the drums with a vengeance.<br>
<br>
Then there were the songs that were there just for fun, including the 
often-neglected gem "Growin' Up," from his debut album, "Greetings From 
Asbury Park, N.J," a song about adolescent bravado that lost nothing 
from being sung by a 53-year-old man with a big grin on his face. He 
added a country flavor to the intro of "She's the One," and by the end 
of the song was playfully dueling with Clarence Clemons, Springsteen on 
harmonica and Clemons on saxophone.<br>
<br>
This was my fourth Springsteen concert, and the singer gave by far the 
best and fiercest performance I've seen. And also one of the loosest. He
 danced atop the piano, skipped and ran across the stage, even slid from
 one end to the other on his knees, just like in the old days. 
Springsteen brought out his grizzled preacher-man voice to introduce the
 band in the middle of the rave-up "Mary's Place," after he commanded 
the audience to "rise up off of your (backside). C'mon, you ain't that 
old." He had a clever line for each band member, from his wife ("the 
first lady of love") to Clemons ("you wish you could be like him, but 
you can't, I'm sorry.")<br>
<br>
The two-hour and 45-minute show included two encores, totaling eight 
songs, including "Born to Run" and his newly christened "prayer for 
peace," "Born in the USA." As the night grew later, Springsteen seemed 
more energized. His exuberance was contagious, even making the tired 
"Dancing in the Dark" seem fresh and spontaneous. He turned serious for a
 moment, dedicating the piano-driven song "My City of Ruins" to 
Columbia's Harvest Hope Food Bank.<br>
<br>
But soon enough, he was back in form, donning a Santa hat for "Santa 
Claus is Coming to Town," and mugging with everybody in the band for the
 deliciously over-the-top roadhouse-blues number "Quarter to Three." 
It's a rare concert when the audience leaves the building feeling as 
drained as the performer must feel, but that's always been a Springsteen
 trademark. It's nice to know that some things never change</div>

The Boss dazzles on some songs, but drones on others<br>
<br>
Austin American-Statesman , <br>
March 2, 2003<br>
By Michael Corcoran<br>
<br>
With a solid two hours and 45 minutes of music from Bruce Springsteen 
and the E Street Band, there were plenty of thrills at the Erwin Center 
Sunday night.<br>
<br>
The crowd of just under 12,000 (not a sellout) spent most of the show on
 its feet, exploding at the instant of recognition for old faves such as
 "Thunder Road," "Out In the Street" and, especially, "Born To Run." 
Their Boss, meanwhile, gave a performance as athletic as it was 
passionate.<br>
<br>
What was truly remarkable about the show, rescheduled from Nov. 6 when 
sax player Clarence Clemons had emergency surgery to repair a detached 
retina, was just how many dull stretches there were. Great songs such as
 "Badlands" and the new "Into the Fire" were expanded past the point of 
interest and lesser material, such as "Worlds Apart" ? one of 10 songs 
performed from "The Rising" ? was gaudily overwrought and 
self-indulgent.<br>
<br>
With Clemons blowing the same big honking solo over and over and that 
headache machine Max Weinberg playing drums with as much soul as a 
metronome, the E Street Bland hardly performed like the live act of 
their legend. Keyboardists Danny Federici and Roy Bittan are stellar 
players, as is the newest E Streeter, violinist Soozie Tyrell. But their
 contributions could barely be distinguished in a trebley mix that 
seemed to divide the sound into three areas: Bruce's vocals, Max's snare
 and "other."<br>
<br>
"The Rising," inspired by the Sept. 11 tragedy, is a fine album ? on the
 stereo at home on a rainy night. As concert fodder, however, the 
heavy-hearted sentiments weighed the set down. A gorgeously stark 
coupling of "Empty Sky" and "You're Missing" was an early highlight, 
however, with Springsteen and wife Patti Scialfa's voices blending like 
shared sorrow. When the group followed with the buoyant "Waitin' On a 
Sunny Day," a stage-sliding Springsteen whipping the crowd into a 
singalong frenzy, the sequence brilliantly reflected the message of 
grief and resurrection at the core of Bruce's latest album. This one was
 going to be special. But "well enough" was like a redhead at a 
roadhouse and just couldn't be left alone. The group tried in vain to 
turn the new "Mary's Place" into a "Rosalita"-worthy workout and it came
 off like the second cast of "Saturday Night Live." "Countin' On a 
Miracle," which followed a Nils Lofgren Spanish guitar intro, was an 
even clearer case of overreaching, a plodding piece of lyrical 
redundancy in a slot that called for a lift.<br>
<br>
I've been to Springsteen concerts where fans found any number of 
creative solutions to nature's call because they couldn't bear to miss a
 single minute. For Sunday's show, you could take a newspaper into the 
restroom and read Dave Barry's column without fear of something 
spectacular happening onstage.<br>
<br>
Springsteen did make Austin feel like a special stop when he 
acknowledged his early '70s shows at the Armadillo World Headquarters 
while introducing "Growin' Up." He dedicated the stirringly spiritual 
"My City of Ruins," on which he played piano, to the Capital Area Food 
Bank and brought his buddy Joe Ely up to sing "All Just To Get To You," 
which they'd previously performed together at the Erwin Center in April 
2000.<br>
<br>
The Austin audience was the first on the 2002-2003 tour to hear 
Springsteen's take on "War," the old Edwin Starr song that opened the 
show. They were also the first on the 2002-2003 tour to realize, 
good-gawd-y'all, the song's pretty goofy. But Sunday's throng was also 
treated to a seemingly impromptu, show-closing hoedown on "Working On 
the Highway," which, with Ely once again aboard, was just exuberantly 
sloppy enough to leave a smile on the night.<br>
<br>
The concert was supposed to end with "Dancing In the Dark" 
(Springsteen's "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy"), which had the crowd bopping 
deliriously to the whiff of glory days, even as the band phoned it in 
and Springsteen gladhanded the lucky 300 blue wristband wearers in the 
pit up front.<br>

<br>
The Indianapolis Star , <br>
December 18, 2002<br>
By David Lindquist<br>
<br>
Let's say you're the musician who's better than the rest at writing modern fanfares for the common American.<br>
<br>
What's your move when the world is turned upside down for all of them -- and most critically for the ones in your back yard?<br>
<br>
If you're Bruce Springsteen, you press ahead with new hymns drawn from a highly attuned and humanistic perspective.<br>
<br>
And one more thing: You make sure the old band is intact for the ride.<br>
<br>
Playing song after song from Sept. 11-inspired album "The Rising," 
Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band elevated the spirits of 12,000 
concertgoers Tuesday night at Conseco Fieldhouse.<br>
<br>
They did it with tunes such as "Into the Fire," a rousing eulogy for public servants lost at the World Trade Center.<br>
<br>
When the concert's momentum swung from early rave-ups "No Surrender" and
 "The Night" -- important moments in establishing audience attentiveness
 -- to "Rising" ballads "Empty Sky" and "You're Missing," it mirrored 
that day's inconceivable shifts in reality.<br>
<br>
Flowing from ethereal harmonies sung by Springsteen and Patti Scialfa, 
"Empty Sky" couldn't make its twin towers references any clearer. 
There's more personal mourning within the lyrics of "You're Missing."<br>
<br>
As its title suggests, however, "The Rising" isn't a work of pessimism 
or resignation. In fact, two of the album's tracks have become rock' em,
 sock' em show-stoppers in the grand Springsteen tradition.<br>
<br>
"Waitin' on a Sunny Day," which resembles John Mellencamp's "Lonesome 
Jubilee" era more than a little bit, ascended from acoustic guitars and a
 fiddle to a signature sax solo by Clarence Clemons and a dynam"Waitin' 
on a Sunny Day," which resembles John Mellencamp's "Lonesome Jubilee" 
era more than a little bit, ascended from acoustic guitars and a fiddle 
to a signature sax solo by Clarence Clemons and a dynamic audience 
sing-along.<br>
<br>
In the case of "Mary's Place," this unhinged party anthem (and 
Springsteen's introduction of band members across its bridge) provided 
more entertainment than many entire concerts I attended this year.<br>
<br>
Regarding the evening's sound mix, it's safe to say the bad-job memo 
from 1999 made its way to the Boss. After Springsteen played the 
inaugural concert at Conseco Fieldhouse, many upper-deck patrons exited 
with complaints of harsh echoes and muffled vocals.<br>
<br>
On Tuesday, the sound crew raised the PA speakers high and cranked the 
volume higher. This adjustment aided balcony listening, even if some 
teeth rattled in the lower level.<br>
<br>
But this was a rock 'n' roll show after all -- one made unforgettable by
 moments such as "Born to Run" under full-house lights, Springsteen and 
Steven Van Zandt trading flubbed lines during "Two Hearts" and the 
thrilling audience participation of "Badlands."<br>
<br>
This was the group's final show of 2002. Next year marks the 30th anniversary of "Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J."<br>
<br>
No worries. By all indications, Springsteen is fully fueled to keep the faith.</div>

				<div class="content">Journey with the Boss always ends in land of hope and dreams<br>
<br>
St. Louis Today , <br>
December 18, 2002<br>
<br>
The journey began on a warm, breezy summer's night in New Jersey. It was
 Aug. 7, and as we tailgated outside the arena, we were giddy with 
expectation, knowing that we were about to set out on a wonderful 
adventure. And it ended on a cold, drizzly winter's day in Indianapolis.
 We stood outside of Conseco Fieldhouse on Dec. 17, wearing silly Santa 
hats, shivering like fools, chilled to the bone as we waited to enter 
the building. But we knew we'd be warmed, and uplifted, by three hours 
of rip-roaring music. The music of Bruce Springsteen never lets you 
down.<br>
<br>
And I just finished one of the greatest, most satisfying experiences of 
my life. I followed Springsteen's "The Rising" tour, hitting about 12 
shows. My travels took me to virtually every section of the nation. I 
made new friends. I took my daughter to three shows. Some of you heard 
my concert reports on KMOX or read about them in my forum at 
STLtoday.com/bernie, and my Springsteen obsession was spoofed by my 
friends at The Riverfront Times. So I feel a need to explain . . .<br>
<br>
Now, some of you are undoubtedly asking the question: What does this 
have to do with sports? Here's my answer: Because I am truly blessed to 
have this job, Springsteen has everything to do with where I am today. 
So please forgive me for writing a personal column, which is something I
 rarely do.<br>
<br>
Let's turn back the clock. As a teenager, I ran a family business. It 
was expected of me. I didn't mind the work, and my grandparents were 
important to me, but I knew I wanted to do more with my life. I wanted 
to be a writer. I didn't want to get stuck in a small town, operating a 
convenience store, caught in a numbing routine. I want to be in the 
world. These were difficult days; I wanted to love and respect my family
 but felt that I must rebel against the course that they chose for me. 
And Springsteen's music was a constant source of inspiration for me 
during that era. The message in his defiant anthems - Born to Run, 
Thunder Road, Badlands, Promised Land - reinforced my heart.<br>
<br>
The words comforted me in ways that no one will ever know. Springsteen 
reminded kids like me - tramps like us - that there's nothing wrong in 
wanting a better life, and that we should persist and push through and 
never give up on our dreams. And I do not believe that I'd be writing a 
sports column today had I not been challenged and encouraged by 
Springsteen's anthems.<br>
<br>
I admit that I got tired of Springsteen for a while. I didn't like it 
when he fired the E Street Band, married the Hollywood actress, and 
moved to Los Angeles. But a St. Louis Springsteen fan named Tom Weaver 
reminded me that Springsteen had every right to evolve, just as we all 
try directions at various stages of our lives. Weaver was right, and I 
felt like a jerk for resenting the changes in Springsteen's life. 
Besides, Springsteen eventually returned to his roots.<br>
<br>
Now, let's fast forward. I've gone through a lot of changes in the last 
year or so. My father has been battling an illness that seems terminal. I
 was worried about my own health and being overweight but for some 
reason couldn't find the courage to do anything about it. A serious 
relationship ended; a woman that I thought I'd marry decided to move to 
New York. I don't know if my heart was broken or cracked or about to 
implode . . .<br>
<br>
And Springsteen came to my emotional rescue again, just as he did a 
quarter-century ago. Much of "The Rising" is about coping with the 
aftermath of the deaths on Sept. 11, 2001. But the collection of songs 
apply to anyone who has experienced personal loss, or is fretting over 
the potential death of a loved one (my dad). But much of the music is 
hopeful - a reaffirmation of life in wake of death and grieving.<br>
<br>
I played "The Rising" dozens of times during my daily walks and runs 
through Forest Park, as I began an attempt to salvage my own health. 
Whenever I felt particularly down about my father's condition, I found 
comfort on several songs on the CD. And when I had sad thoughts about 
the end of my romance, I'd crank up "Lonesome Day" and feel better.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's new music was right on time. Again. And I wasn't alone in 
this dynamic. Cardinals manager Tony La Russa, a devoted Springsteen 
fan, turned to the song "The Rising" after Darryl Kile's sudden death. 
La Russa listened when he needed something to help get him through the 
darkest moments of his emotional angst. "I've always thought the 
messages in Springsteen's songs are so powerful," La Russa said. "And 
they apply to our lives over and over again. And it was true again this 
summer for me. Personally, everyone reaches out in a different way to 
cope with a tragedy. When each of us were searching for a source of 
strength of how to deal with losing Darryl, Bruce's song became very 
special to me. It helped pull me through."<br>
<br>
It's an example of how music can touch, and impact, our lives. But I 
wanted more. I wanted to go back to my younger days when I'd see about 
15 Springsteen shows a year. So this past summer I started flying off to
 "The Rising" concerts, lining up late at night, or early in the 
morning, to secure one of the 300 standing-room spots in the "pit," area
 directly in front of the stage. And each invigorating concert made me 
realize how happy I am to be alive. And as Springsteen once told us, it 
ain't no sin to be glad you're alive.<br>
<br>
Thanks, Bruce.</div>

<br>
Albany Times Union , <br>
December 8, 2002<br>
By John Massaro<br>
<br>
I was prepared to be sharply disappointed with Bruce Springsteen and the
 E Street Band's latest album, "The Rising." Because I teach a course at
 the State University College at Potsdam titled "Walk Tall: Political 
Themes in the Lyrics of Bruce Springsteen," I was concerned when a 
review in Time concluded: "What's missing on 'The Rising' is politics." 
After repeated and enjoyable listening to the album and attending recent
 Springsteen concerts in Cleveland and Detroit (I don't have tickets for
 Friday's sold-out show in Albany -- yet), I must report the album is 
not only a respectful, rocking and fitting testimony to the events of 
Sept. 11, 2001, and its aftermath. It is also distinctly and beautifully
 political.<br>
<br>
While the conclusion that "The Rising" lacks a political perspective is 
erroneous, it is, nonetheless, understandable. Politics is present in 
any human endeavor involving power and influence. A common but critical 
mistake is to conclude that it is the sole or even primary nature of 
politics for some to employ power and influence to achieve selfish or 
malevolent ends or to force others manipulatively, aggressively and, 
perhaps, duplicitously to do what they would not ordinarily choose to 
do. Power and influence can, however, also be used to attain benevolent 
ends as well as in assisting others to achieve goals in accordance with 
their hopes and dreams. People cannot only be moved to action by 
appealing to their demons but also to their better angels.<br>
<br>
Refusing to pander<br>
<br>
Springsteen's "The Rising" avoids the politics of fear and hate, the 
politics of threatening to harm or otherwise bully or manipulate others.
 In the album, he refuses to pander to the reactionary right's 
momentarily popular, jingoistic and macho version of the politics of 
vengeance and retaliation calling for the humiliation and extinction of 
Osama bin Laden, al-Qaida and, perhaps, Islam itself. On the other hand,
 he does not embrace the radical left's dogmatic version of politics 
tracing the events of Sept. 11 to the greed, arrogance and insensitivity
 of United States' imperialism and unilateralism.<br>
<br>
It appears to me that Springsteen justifiably believes post-Sept. 11 
nerves are still too raw to absorb an album decisively siding with 
either of these political poles. To his credit, he eschews such 
political differences in order to emphasize our human similarities. In 
timely fashion, he offers the balm of the politics of love and 
understanding, the politics of human compassion and tolerance, the 
politics of the better angels that he has faith lie within the hearts of
 all of us. Even while Springsteen does not present a specific political
 blueprint as to how to achieve the peaceful and just world community he
 envisions, he challenges listeners to never lose sight of this worthy 
goal.<br>
<br>
A caring humanity<br>
<br>
"The Rising" features several notable illustrations of the theme of the 
politics of love and community, of a caring humanity. There is 
Springsteen's caution against pursuing a knee-jerk, vengeful reaction to
 return hate for hate, violence for violence, terror for terror. In 
"Lonesome Day," he notes: "Better ask questions before you start to 
shoot. Deceit and betrayal's bitter fruit." Springsteen also asks us to 
forget past grudges, past hatreds, past killings employed by some to 
promote deeds causing still more pain, hatred and death. He urges us to 
seek peaceful solutions by consistently reminding us of the commonality 
of the human spirit. Springsteen's appeal, while often invoking a deity,
 is not made to a God or even gods in heaven but rather to people on 
Earth. In the fittingly titled "Worlds Apart," he writes that we will 
not find the truth, the path to peace and justice, in otherworldly 
appeals but only "in your skin upon my skin, in the beating of our 
hearts." And in the bouncy "Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin)," he 
endorses the politics of togetherness, cooperation and community, 
forsaking the traditional politics of combat, conflict and hatred. 
Springsteen tells us that while there are "a lot of walls need tearing 
down, together we could take them down one by one."<br>
<br>
Two people<br>
<br>
The humanistic nature of the politics extolled in "The Rising" is 
evident in the album's most compelling, most significant song, 
"Paradise." Springsteen presents two people, one a Muslim, the other a 
Christian. Both have been victimized by the politics of hate. While the 
lyrics are, perhaps, intentionally ambiguous, it appears the Muslim is a
 parent, spouse or friend, left behind to mourn the death of a beloved 
female suicide bomber who has taken her own life and, likely, the lives 
of others. Springsteen then introduces the widow of a Pentagon employee 
killed in the Sept. 11 attack. While the Muslim and the Christian are 
separated by many, many miles and by different cultures and religions, 
Springsteen connects them through the commonality of human suffering. 
Neither survivor can find solace in ethereal thoughts that his/her 
deceased loved one is now in some version of paradise. And even when 
they do gain a mystical glimpse of their departed, they see their eyes 
not reflecting peace but "as empty as paradise."<br>
<br>
Springsteen seems to be suggesting that the power to bring about a 
loving global community in which such senseless deaths do not occur 
rests not with appeals to dogma or even to the divine. Rather, it rests 
within the hearts and minds of humanity. Appeals for a peaceful, loving 
world community made beyond our own humanity are likely doomed to fail 
unless we are willing to work toward that goal together. While never 
denying God's love and power, Springsteen calls upon us to accept 
responsibility for making the world a safer, saner and just place. 
Notably, in the final verse of "Paradise" an anguished survivor is 
tempted to escape this responsibility and join a mourned loved one by 
drowning him/herself. He or she realizes the futility of this gesture 
and re-embraces life and the human condition of trying to make the best 
of an imperfect world.<br>
<br>
I break above the waves / I feel the sun upon my face.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is calling upon all of us to embrace life, our common humanity and each other. And that is political.</div>

<br>
Rolling Stone , <br>
December 12, 2002<br>
By Anthony DeCurtis<br>
<br>
His album The Rising dealt with life after 9/11. His world tour 
confronted the realities of war Asked if he's read anything this year 
that he'd like to recommend, Bruce Springsteen mentions Founding 
Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation, by Joseph J. Ellis, a book that 
explores the conflicting notions about nationhood that gave birth to the
 American republic. He also mentions The American Idol, an Op-Ed piece 
in that day's New York Times by Thomas L. Friedman. "He talks about how 
Europeans perceive American power and its influence around the world," 
Springsteen says. It's a subject fresh in his mind. The E Street Band 
has just returned from a two-week, six-country European tour, during 
which, he says, "the intensity of the audiences caught us a bit by 
surprise."<br>
This year, Springsteen released The Rising, one of the first works by a 
major artist to address the world as reshaped by the September 11th 
attacks. It was also the first album of new work since 1987 by the E 
Street Band, which launched a world tour to support it.<br>
<br>
By all accounts, your European dates were explosive.<br>
<br>
I love going to Europe. I feel really at home there. The band loves 
playing there, and there was something particularly powerful about those
 shows. When we came out in Paris the first night, the audience was just
 . . . it caught the whole band by surprise. Those audiences actually 
have a pretty complex view of the philosophical roots of the band. They 
hear us as a very specific voice of where we're from, and at this point 
that voice is not easily blurred or made simplistic or jingoistic. They 
distinguish the voice of our band, say, from the current 
administration's foreign policy.<br>
<br>
What do they hear in your voice?<br>
<br>
I think people are attracted to American energy and an optimism that's 
tempered by criticism. Also, they have a sense that the basic values in 
our songs transcend national boundaries, and people relate to those 
values as the strengths of the States.<br>
<br>
How did people there feel about the potential of war with Iraq?<br>
<br>
There's an enormous amount of concern about it; people overseas are very
 mistrustful of the current administration. But I feel it here, too. 
There's enormous ambivalence about where we're going. Personally, I 
think diplomacy should rule. I haven't seen the specific rationale that 
justifies putting thousands and thousands of young American lives on the
 line.<br>
<br>
You commented at many of your U.S. shows about the danger that the war on terrorism presents to our freedoms.<br>
<br>
In times of emergency, the first thing to take a whipping is our civil 
rights. There were thousands of people detained. Who are they? What 
happened to them? There was talk about military tribunals. These things 
are fundamentally against the grain of what's made us who we are.<br>
<br>
More personally, were you heartened by the response to The Rising?<br>
<br>
You're always trying to write something that's talking to people in some
 fashion. That's the root of the whole job. And it felt like people were
 hungry to hear it. That was the most satisfying thing.<br>
<br>
Did the year have a particular high point for you?<br>
<br>
It always comes back to the playing. It's really that. And at this 
point, for me, it's also about the band's presence in my life and 
onstage. So I don't know if I had any single high point, outside of 
bringing the music out onstage the first few times. The beginning of the
 tour was very powerful because we played New York, New Jersey and 
Washington. New York, in particular, felt very meaningful.<br>
<br>
But it can happen on any night -- that moment of physically bringing the
 music to an audience, to where they live. That's your trial by fire. 
That's what moves you to continue. That, and being able to do it with 
the guys who I've lived with most of my life.<br>
<br>
Was there a low point?<br>
<br>
Well, it was a year in which everybody was trying to make sense of 
everything that had happened. You'd be home and, as a parent, one of 
your jobs is to try and make your children feel as safe as they can 
possibly feel. It wasn't such an easy year to do that. So maybe that was
 it.<br>
<br>
What does 2003 look like to you?<br>

For us, it's a touring year, so there will be a lot of travel. The band 
will be very active, doing its job. And then there's everything else 
that is going on out there. What's going to happen in Iraq? What's going
 to happen in the Middle East? What's going to happen here? Those are 
things that everybody's anxious about. Me, too.</div>

<br>
South Carolina Free Times , <br>
December 4, 2002<br>
By Kevin Oliver<br>
<br>
There is a sense of community in the music of Bruce Springsteen, whether
 in the increasingly topical albums he has released since the 1970s, or 
at one of his legendary concerts with The E Street Band. One stunning 
visual confirmation of this was provided about halfway through his Nov. 
16 appearance in Greensboro, N.C. The crowd hugging the stage was 
predictably pumping their fists in the air from the first song of the 
set. But as the band kicked into "Badlands" (from the 1978 album 
Darkness on the Edge of Town), the house lights came up to reveal the 
entire audience with upraised arms punching the air in unison, all the 
way up to the top row of the arena. Few performers can inspire the kind 
of mass adulation afforded Bruce Springsteen, and fewer still have 
handled it with as much grace and success.<br>
<br>
After the events of Sept. 11, much was made of the need for us to return
 to the comfortable and the familiar, touching base with family and 
friends in ways the boom years of the ?90s had shunted aside as 
secondary concerns to cashing in one?s stock options. The tragedy 
inspired immediate musical tributes, from the tenderly simplistic (Alan 
Jackson?s "Where Were You When the World Stopped Turning") to the overly
 reactionary (Toby Keith?s "Courtesy of the Red White and Blue" and 
Charlie Daniels? "hat Ain?t No Rag, It?s a Flag". Leave it to 
Springsteen to produce The Rising, an album-length response that 
sidesteps the big political issues and the little, petty hatreds, 
focusing instead on the very real and personal effects of Sept. 11 on 
individuals, including many of his neighbors in New Jersey.<br>
<br>
Since his 1991 marriage to E Street band member Patti Scialfa, 
Springsteen and family have spent most of their time in the same central
 Jersey area where he grew up. If you spend any time in his old haunts 
of Freehold or Asbury Park, you?ll likely run into someone who?s had a 
drink with Springsteen at a local sports bar, shook his hand over pizza 
at Federici?s or seen him jump on stage with a friend?s band at The 
Stone Pony. It is this grounding in the familiar that has allowed 
Springsteen to expand his writing scope, from the fanciful characters 
from his early years on the Jersey Shore to the exquisitely drawn 
portraits of grief on The Rising. Terry, Hazey Davey and The Magic Rat 
may have given way to the unnamed protagonists of "Worlds Apart" and 
"Mary?s Place," but the needs of the people Springsteen writes about 
remain the same ? to escape from a life that?s either oppressive or 
unbearable. The difference between songs like "Spirit in the Night" or 
"Born to Run" and the new disc?s "Waitin? on a Sunny Day" and "Let?s be 
Friends" is that now the goal is defined, whereas in the past there was 
satisfaction?however fleeting--in escape itself.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the best example of this on The Rising is "Mary?s Place." On the
 surface, "Mary?s Place" is a throwaway party song in the tradition of 
"Darlington County," but deeper digging reveals a searching for familiar
 community in times of trouble. The Sept. 11 references are subtle, but 
they are there, from the biblical echoes of "Eleven angels of mercy 
sighin? over that black hole in the sun" to the unanswered question, 
"Tell me how do you live broken hearted?" The narrator isn?t wallowing 
in grief and self-pity, however; he is comforting himself with the 
presence of friends and familiar rituals, a process that comes across 
like a trip to the altar rail: "Your favorite record?s on the turntable,
 I drop the needle and pray (turn it up)." In concert, the refrain?s 
admonition, "Waiting for that shout from the crowd," provokes just 
that--a roar of approval that threatens to drown out the band.<br>
<br>
This level of approval also has had its down side: Long known for his 
big anthems--from "Born to Run" to "Born in the U.S.A."?Springsteen has 
struggled over the years with the misinterpretation of his songs. Most 
famously, "Born in the U.S.A." was briefly appropriated by the 1984 
Reagan campaign, which looked no further than the chorus when they used 
the anti-Vietnam song at several appearances. During his 1996 solo 
acoustic tour, and again on the reunion tour with the E Street Band in 
2000, Springsteen played a radically different, bluesy slide guitar 
version of the song--perhaps in an effort to distance it from its 
flag-waving reputation. This time around the band is back to a close 
approximation of the original album version, but Springsteen has taken 
to introducing it as "a song for peace."<br>
<br>
Once the show opener of choice, "Born in the U.S.A." has now been 
supplanted in that role by the title track to the new album, "The 
Rising." It too is a call to arms, albeit the kind of arms that reach 
out to others and lift them up: "Come on up for the rising, come on up, 
lay your hands in mine." In the second verse, Springsteen addresses the 
morning of Sept. 11 directly, in lines that could apply to either the 
firefighters who responded to the scene or to his own sense of 
responsibility to tell their story: "Left the house this morning / Bells
 ringing filled the air / Wearing the cross of my calling / On wheels of
 fire I come, rolling down here." It is nearly a gospel song, with a 
rousing refrain sung by a large backing choir, and it sets the stage 
perfectly for the near-religious fervor of a Bruce Springsteen concert.<br>
<br>
Anthems aside, it is in the quieter moments that Springsteen has had his
 most meaningful impact in recent years. "Philadelphia," his hit title 
song to the 1993 movie in which Tom Hanks starred as a lawyer stricken 
with AIDS, was an early indicator of a gentler, more contemplative 
Springsteen--one who could invest social concerns with a humanity that 
connected his audience to others. "American Skin," the controversial 
song written about a police shooting in New York, was a chilling 
highlight of the reunion tour and subsequent live album. The Rising also
 boasts several down-tempo tunes that pack a mighty emotional wallop. 
"My City of Ruins," a song written about the degeneration of Asbury 
Park, N.J., and performed first at a benefit show there last year, fits 
into the Sept. 11 theme in an almost eerily prescient way. "Paradise" 
speaks to the wider issues of race and human perceptions as it tells a 
group of parallel stories similar to the tales of the Mexican/ American 
border that filled the 1994 folk-tinged solo disc, The Ghost Of Tom 
Joad. "You?re Missing" and "Into the Fire" speak most directly of the 
Sept. 11 tragedy, from the former?s palpable sense of loss to the 
latter?s stirring tribute to the heroes of the day--those firefighters 
who went "up the stairs, into the fire."<br>
<br>
Though the lion?s share of the songs Springsteen played in Greensboro 
were drawn from The Rising, there were more than enough hits and 
obscurities thrown in to satisfy both the casual and rabid fans alike. 
Highlights included a smoldering take on "The Fuse," a song of sexual 
longing that seems oddly out of place on the new album. The live version
 expands on the guitar solos, increasing the tension of the lyrics for a
 more meaningful result. "Empty Sky," another song explicitly related to
 Sept. 11, was given a gently inspiring reading with just Springsteen 
and his wife Scialfa on acoustic guitars and vocals. On CD, "Worlds 
Apart" has ethereal background vocals and pseudo-worldbeat rhythms, but 
in concert it takes on a more direct, muscular quality, with its story 
of cross-cultural romance visually aided by the face-to-face singing of 
Springsteen and Scialfa into a single microphone.<br>
<br>
While Springsteen shows are great communal events, like all concerts, 
they do end. Even at this stage in his career, however, Springsteen?s 
two-and-a-half hour shows end a lot later than anyone else?s. One final 
word of advice: Don?t leave your seats until the roadies start tearing 
down the stage, because Springsteen and the band usually do at least two
 encores, and it is in these extra mini-sets that some of the greatest 
crowd-pleasers are placed. From "Glory Days" and "Born to Run" to 
"Dancing in the Dark" and "Thunder Road," if it hasn?t been played in 
the regular set, chances are good it will show up here.<br>

Bruce?s Records--And What to Expect Live By Kevin Oliver<br>
<br>
Despite his high profile and multi-platinum album sales, Bruce 
Springsteen has released only 15 albums over the past 30 years, 
including two box sets, two live discs and a greatest hits album. Here?s
 a quick look back at the studio albums, with some clues as to which of 
the older songs might pop up in this week?s concert.<br>
<br>
Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. (Columbia, 1973):<br>
Springsteen?s debut showed what a scruffy 24-year-old with a Dylan and 
Van Morrison fixation could do with a band of Jersey Shore ruffians 
behind him. Heavy on the wordplay and colorful characters that would 
remain staples of Springsteen?s work for years to come. "Blinded by the 
Light" was a minor hit, but went to No. 1 when covered by Manfred Mann. 
"Lost in the Flood," "Hard to be a Saint in the City" and "For You" have
 been played so far on this tour.<br>
<br>
The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle (Columbia, 1973):<br>
An extension of the first album, with the trio of "Incident on 57th 
Street," "Rosalita," and "New York City Serenade" ranking among the most
 perfect album sides ever. "Incident" has shown up frequently on this 
tour, with Bruce plinking out a nice solo version at the piano, to the 
delight of longtime fans.<br>
<br>
Born to Run (Columbia, 1975):<br>
The album that put Bruce on the covers of Time and Newsweek 
simultaneously, this is his self-described attempt to sound like Phil 
Spector and sing like Roy Orbison. Springsteen has been drawing heavily 
from this album, with "Night," "She?s the One,"and of course the title 
track making multiple appearances in the set and encores.<br>
<br>
Darkness On The Edge Of Town (Columbia, 1978):<br>
The darker follow-up to the big hit of Born to Run, Springsteen?s 
Darkness was influenced by business conflicts with his original 
management, a lengthy lawsuit and the pressure to follow a career-making
 album. Songs like "Badlands" and "The Promised Land" have been a good 
fit next to the new material in concert, and even "Candy?s Room" and 
"Racing in the Street" have shown up a few times.<br>
<br>
The River (Columbia, 1980):<br>
A sprawling double album that worked more times than it didn?t, with 
many diverse sounds and styles attempted. The title track has been 
another good fit in some shows, and the rockers like "Ramrod" and even 
"Cadillac Ranch" have been loads of fun for the band and the audience.<br>
<br>
Nebraska (Columbia, 1982):<br>
This stark, acoustic album was recorded at home on a four-track and 
contains some of the most gripping, powerful material Springsteen has 
ever written, from the title track?s examination of serial killer 
Charles Starkweather to the last hope anthem, "Atlantic City." But aside
 from "Atlantic City," little if any of Nebraska is being performed on 
this tour.<br>
<br>
Born in the U.S.A. (Columbia, 1984):<br>
Bruce?s biggest selling album, with seven out of the 12 songs released 
as singles. Curiously, several of the other songs, including "Bobby 
Jean" and "No Surrender," have been given some stage time alongside the 
hits like "Dancing in the Dark" and the title song.<br>
<br>
Tunnel of Love (Columbia, 1987):<br>
This was the beginning of the end for the E Street band, with 
Springsteen completing most of the album on his own with minimal band 
contributions. What resulted was an introspective masterpiece on the 
pitfalls of love--a document of Springsteen?s first marriage 
disintegrating. Though it contains some of his best songs ("Brilliant 
Disguise," "One Step Up") few of them are played these days with second 
wife Patti Scialfa sharing the stage with Springsteeen.<br>
<br>
Human Touch/Lucky Town (Columbia, 1992):<br>
Separately released on the same day, these are the much-maligned albums 
Bruce made with California studio musicians after jettisoning the E 
Streeters. The result was Boss-lite, with some of Springsteen?s weakest 
songs coupled with relatively uninspired performances. The ballad 
"Should I Fall Behind" is among only a handful of songs on either album 
Bruce has revisited since, and "Human Touch" is, as of this writing, the
 only one to be played on this tour.<br>
<br>
The Ghost of Tom Joad (Columbia, 1995):<br>
This is Springsteen as Woody Guthrie in an almost solo acoustic format 
that came out oddly flat in comparison to the much less produced 
Nebraska. There are some interesting stories here, but little melody to 
hold a casual listener?s interest. Live versions from the acoustic tour 
(including a Columbia show at the Township Auditorium in December 1996) 
were much more robust, but so far nothing from this album has surfaced 
on the current tour.</div>

				<div class="content">A BOSS SHOW!<br>
<br>
Springsteen and his E Street Band put on a powerhouse show of rock, revival and healing at the ACC last night<br>
<br>
Toronto Sun , <br>
December 6, 2002<br>
By Jane Stevenson<br>
<br>
'Come on up for the rising, come on up, lay your hands in mine," sang 
Bruce Springsteen during The Rising, the first song of his sold-out show
 at the Air Canada Centre last night.<br>
<br>
There were more than a few takers among the 19,000-plus fans who had 
gathered to worship at the feet of The Boss, touring again with his 
beloved E Street Band in support of their new album, The Rising.<br>
<br>
The 53-year-old New Jersey native last hit the road with the E Streeters
 in their highly publicized 1999/2000 reunion tour, which visited the 
ACC in May of 2000.<br>
<br>
But this time out seemed extra special and poignant given The Rising was
 mostly written in the months after 9/11, and is the first studio effort
 featuring Springsteen and E Streeters in 15 years.<br>
<br>
Last night's show, which sold out anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours 
depending upon whom you asked, was a combination powerhouse rock show, 
religious revival meeting and respectful time for healing.<br>
<br>
And it lasted for two-and-a-half-hours.<br>
<br>
"It's going to be a little quiet for the next few songs," explained 
Springsteen, as he led into the new songs Empty Sky and You're Missing.<br>
<br>
That such a tender moment could occur in an arena-sized venue while 
Springsteen and his wife, backup singer and acoustic guitarist Patti 
Scialfa, sweetly harmonized during Empty Sky was a testament to The 
Boss' powers as a performer.<br>
<br>
The quiet intensity was only matched later during another new song, Into
 The Fire, which saw Scialfa wailing away during the opening 
introduction before the tune eventually took off in a more hopeful 
direction.<br>
<br>
"May your strength give us strength, may your faith give us faith, may 
your hope give us hope, may your love bring us love," sang Springsteen 
and the entire band.<br>
<br>
His usual front line of Scialfa, sax man Clarence Clemons -- who seemed 
fully recovered from retinal surgery that postponed some shows last 
month -- guitarists Steven Van Zandt and Nils Lofgren, and back line of 
bassist Garry Tallent, drummer Max Weinberg and keyboardists Roy Bittan 
and Danny Federici, was supplemented by a female violinist.<br>
<br>
Her powers came to the forefront during the sombre You're Missing and 
the more optimistic and upbeat Waitin' On A Sunny Day, the latter 
prompting a spirited singalong which saw an impassioned Springsteen 
finally start to seriously work the room.<br>
<br>
He high-fived audience members, encouraged them to join him on the 
chorus and even performed his trademark slide on the knees at the front 
of the stage, to everyone's delight.<br>
<br>
Upping the ante were the anthemic chestnuts Cadillac Ranch, Badlands, 
She's The One and Thunder Road, which prompted a major jam session among
 the band members and increased crowd participation.<br>
<br>
Even the new song, Mary's Place, thrilled the room as Springsteen got up
 on Bittan's piano and whipped off his vest to huge cheers and applause.<br>
<br>
When it came to the two encores, it was mostly a no-holds-barred 
crowd-pleasing time -- or "Boss time!" as Van Zandt called it -- with 
such barnburners trotted out as Dancing In The Dark, Born In The U.S.A 
., The Land Of Hope And Dreams, and yes, even Santa Claus Is Coming To 
Town, complete with white-fur trimmed red Santa hats.<br>
<br>
But nothing could match the overwhelming, uninhibited, air-punching joy 
that greeted Born To Run, which saw The Boss playing guitar at the front
 of the stage with dozens of outstretched hands reaching towards him.<br>
<br>
All this with the house lights on for the entire song.</div>

<br>
Beaver County Times , December 5, 2002<br>
By Scott Tady<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen waited eight songs Wednesday before delving into his 
classic rock repertoire. It was a buoyant rendering of "Out on the 
Street" that sent into rapture the full-house Mellon Arena crowd. To its
 credit, the crowd also responded enthusiastically to Springsteen's new 
material, which composed nine of the night's first 15 songs. This show 
was not just a nostalgia fest, this was a celebration of a still-vital 
American artist.<br>
<br>
Not that Springsteen put on airs like an artist Wednesday, sliding on 
his knees across the stage and flashing that ornery grin when urging 
fans to sing along. The Boss arrived for work 45 minutes late, though 
all was forgiven once the houselights went down, and the first of many 
"Bruuuuce" cheers arose. Backed by his trusty E Street band, Springsteen
 went for the gusto early with a rousing version of "The Rising," the 
title track of his new CD.<br>
<br>
With the band wearing head-to-toe black, the black-vested Springsteen 
gave the "one-two-three" chant that led the charge into an equally 
uplifting "Lonesome Day." As a treat to longtime fans, the group played 
"Surrender" with its memorable line, "We learned more from a 
three-minute record than we ever learned in school.'' Midway through 
that song, Clarence Clemons took his first sax solo, hitting notes that 
filled the arena in much the same way the Big Man filled out his suit. 
Springsteen and his wife, Patty Scialfa, stood alone on stage performing
 the Sept. 11, 2001-inspired song "Empty Sky." Springsteen mournfully 
played harmonica as Scialfa softened the lyrical blow with soulful 
vocals.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's first big smile of the night came during the next new 
song, the decisively upbeat "Waitin' on a Sunny Day." From that song on,
 it was a typical, sweaty, fun-filled Springsteen show. "Badlands" 
elicited a sing-along, leading smoothly into "Worlds Apart," highlighted
 by Springsteen, Nils Lofgren and Steven Van Zandt trading fiery guitar 
licks. Showing their versatility, as well as an awareness of their 
setting, the band dusted off the song "Youngstown," a moving tribute to 
the downtrodden Ohio town.<br>
<br>
Of course, Springsteen brought onto the stage Pittsburgh buddy Joe 
Grushecky to play along on their co-written song "Murder Incorporated." 
Then came the killer package of "Dancing in the Dark," "Glory Days" and 
"Born to Run." You go to a Springsteen show expecting to see chinks in 
the armor. Perhaps he's lost a little passion, his voice has gotten 
rusty or his band isn't quite as tight. Know what? There are no chinks 
in this armor, in fact, there's still not a better live band in America.<br>
<br>
The Rising Tour, which continues halfway into 2003, has grossed $1.1 
million so far, making it the second-most-lucrative tour of this year. 
Only Paul McCartney's $2.1 million tour earned more in 2002, though Sir 
Paul charged an average of $130 per ticket, far exceeding Springsteen's 
average $72.15 ticket price.</div>
