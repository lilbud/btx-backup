He may be Catholic, but to many fans—including this one—his lyrics speak to a different creed.<br>
6:00 AM ET <br>
Eric Alterman</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is the son of Catholic parents and grandparents. There
 is no ambiguity on this point. And yet, in much the same way that New 
York football fans have casually annexed the stadium across the river to
 root for what they like to pretend is their “home” team, some Jewish 
Springsteen fans are devoted to proving that New Jersey’s favorite Irish
 Italian son is, if not actually Jewish, nevertheless somehow Jew-ish. 
Perhaps you thought young Bruce was mostly singing about cars, girls, 
and getting the hell out of town before he switched gears to focus on 
the dignity of working folk, the broken promises of the American dream, 
and more cars and girls. But amid the empty factories, crowded 
barstools, and swimming holes that constitute the foundation of the 
Springsteen oeuvre, some detect a whiff of the Chosen.<br>
<br>
Jews are an essential part of Springsteen’s entourage. His drummer, 
“Mighty” Max Weinberg, is so Jewish, his parents ran a Jewish summer 
camp in the Poconos. Bruce’s first sound engineer, Louis Lahav, was an 
Israeli. Bruce’s two managers, Mike Appel and Jon Landau, hail from the 
Hebraic faith. So does the record-company exec who originally signed 
him, Clive Davis. (Davis was forced out because—wait for it—he charged 
his kid’s bar mitzvah to the company.) Writers at the Forward newspaper 
have gone so far as to track “Springstein” misspellings in The New York 
Times. And the Forward writer Seth Rogovoy was pleased to read in 
Bruce’s 2016 memoir that in his teenage years, he lusted after Jewish 
neighborhood girls, with their “fabulous voluptuousness, full mouths, 
smooth dark skin and weighted breasts—oy!”<br>
<br>
Springsteen is not at all Jewish, as Adam Sandler admits in his 
“Hanukkah Song,” but, he adds, “my mother thinks he is.” And the “Jew or
 Not Jew” website somehow gives Springsteen a 6 out of 10 on its Jewish 
scale, even with its inevitable “verdict: Not a Jew.” Springsteen 
himself has dropped hints of his affinity for the Chosen People. At the 
wedding of his former sound man Marc Brickman, in 1979, he led the band 
in an abbreviated “Hava Nagila.” He credited a sermon on the importance 
of shared love, given by Rabbi Harold Schulweis of Valley Beth Shalom, 
with inspiring “a lot of songs” on The River.<br>
<br>
Sounding like a spiritual salesman for tikkun olam—the Jewish concept of
 “repairing the world”—Springsteen told David Remnick in 2012, “We’re 
repairmen, repairmen with a toolbox. If I repair a little of myself, 
I’ll repair a little of you. That’s the job.” Max Weinberg once made 
this connection explicit. Preparing for an evening at the National 
Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia in 2012, he emailed 
the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that drumming in Bruce’s band was “my way 
of living a life of tikkun olam.”<br>
<br>
And while Mary, Wendy, and Rosie are perhaps the best-known denizens of 
Springsteen’s compositions, you might be surprised at how often figures 
from the Old Testament show up. There’s Adam raising “a Cain.” Then 
there’s 2012’s “Rocky Ground,” in which Springsteen sings, “Forty days 
and nights of rain have washed this land … Floodwaters rising and we’re 
Canaan-bound.” There’s the decidedly unorthodox theological deployment 
of Moses in “Leap of Faith”:<br>
<br>
Now you were the Red Sea, I was Moses<br>
I kissed you and slipped into a bed of roses<br>
The waters parted and love rushed inside<br>
And, of course, despite his never having set foot in Israel, there’s the
 man’s undying belief in “The Promised Land,” which, according to 
Setlist.com, he has so far played in concert 1,374 times.<br>
<br>
The search for the Jewish Springsteen is not the fool’s errand it 
initially appears. Traditionally, discussions of Springsteen as 
theologian have been monopolized, understandably, by Catholic thinkers, 
including such disparate and impressive sources as Walker Percy, Andrew 
Greeley, Robert Coles, and even Martin Scorsese. Thanks, however, to 
Azzan Yadin-Israel, a Rutgers University Jewish-studies and classics 
professor, a decent case can be made that Bruce has been awfully 
influenced by our part of the Bible.<br>
<br>
In The Grace of God and the Grace of Man: The Theologies of Bruce 
Springsteen, Yadin-Israel avoids Springsteen’s biography and focuses 
exclusively on his lyrics. In a chapter provocatively titled 
“Springsteen’s Midrash,” he looks closely not only at the obvious 
choices, including “Adam Raised a Cain” and “Into the Fire,” but also at
 the obscure, such as “Swallowed Up (In the Belly of the Whale).” 
Springsteen, Yadin-Israel points out, transposes Old Testament stories 
into contemporary American landscapes. Why, in “The Promised Land,” does
 Springsteen describe “a dark cloud rising from the desert floor,” into 
which the protagonist packs his bags and heads “straight into the 
storm”? Yadin-Israel finds the answer in Exodus 13:21, in which “the 
Lord went in front of them in a pillar of cloud by day, to lead them 
along the way.”<br>
<br>
On a purely personal level, I’m convinced of Springsteen’s Jewish spirit
 because he made me better understand the faith of my fathers. Some 60 
years ago, the late Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, the founder of 
Reconstructionist Judaism, defined God as “whatever gives meaning to the
 world” and seeks the interests of “welfare, reason, and spirit.” The 
sacred, he said, is “any element of human experience which serves as a 
means of enhancing human life.” Although my parents sent me to a 
Reconstructionist Hebrew school, I didn’t grasp Kaplan’s idea of the 
sacred—until Bruce showed up.<br>
<br>
I first encountered Springsteen as a 15-year-old back in the summer of 
1975, just as Columbia Records was stoking excitement for the release of
 Born to Run. I grew up in Westchester, New York, and I remember going 
into Manhattan, walking around the garbage-strewn streets, and seeing 
Springsteen posters on Dumpsters and abandoned construction sites like 
he was a modern-day Russian icon, except in sneakers and a leather 
jacket, with a guitar on his back. When I finally got my hands on the 
record, it changed my life. Born to Run offered me an alternative 
context for my life: one in which it was okay to try and fail, rather 
than just to appear too cool to care. After years wasted in Hebrew 
school, I had found meaning and, therefore, as Kaplan would have it, 
faith. What had previously felt ridiculous was endowed with dignity and,
 no less important, solidarity. Screw my stupid suburban hometown, 
ripping the bones off my metaphorical back like, yes, a metaphorical 
deathtrap. One day I would pull out of there to win.<br>
<br>
Four years later, in September 1979, Springsteen brought me even closer 
to Kaplan’s definition of God. But it was at the expense of some trouble
 during the High Holy Days.<br>
I was a sophomore at Cornell, and I had decided to spend a week with my 
folks instead of attending classes, because The Who, The Clash, and 
Bruce were all giving concerts in the city. My parents were paying my 
tuition and were not pleased. Still, they reasoned, at least I would be 
home to observe Yom Kippur with them, the holiest of days on the Jewish 
calendar, and one, I argued, not entirely truthfully, I had planned to 
come home and spend with them anyway.<br>
<br>
The Springsteen show was actually a benefit at Madison Square Garden 
with some musician friends who wanted to warn the world about the 
dangers of nuclear energy, and the first of Bruce’s two performances was
 scheduled on Kol Nidre, the night before Yom Kippur service, which is 
somehow even more important than the daytime services and fasting and 
all that. Ah, well, I promised, I would make it up to them by being in 
shul the following morning as soon as services began.<br>
<br>
Nuclear power? Rarely in history have people shown less interest in a 
cause than those assembled at the Garden that night ostensibly to oppose
 it. Sure, it sucked—whatever. We were there to see Bruce. The 
performers who preceded him on the bill either rode the Springsteen wave
 or found themselves buried beneath it. Jackson Browne smartly joined 
the crowd in chanting “Broooce” between his own songs.<br>
<br>
The 50 or so minutes it took the crew to set up the E Street Band’s 
equipment were the longest of my young life. It was more than just the 
weight of the wait, though that was considerable. Rather, the longer 
Bruce took to come onstage, the greater the likelihood that I would miss
 the midnight train home, end up sleeping outside Grand Central 
Terminal, and miss my appointment in synagogue. If he didn’t get started
 by 10, I figured I was sunk.<br>
<br>
I was. Springsteen came on late, played a magnificent 90-minute set, and
 forced me to pass Yom Kippur morning with the bums. I did not make it 
to services until early afternoon, another in a series of broken 
promises made to my long-suffering parents. Yet if the point of prayer, 
according to Kaplan, is to seek one’s “higher self,” and if “holiness” 
means “the quality anything in life possesses insofar as it serves to 
inspire or guide man in his effort to achieve his destiny,” then, 
dammit, I was in the right place on Kol Nidre.<br>
<br>
This was not just music anymore. It was something bigger, more powerful;
 more like a religion, if only religion did what it was supposed to do, 
which was to bring together people of faith and inspire them to go out 
into the world and be their best selves. That night, Bruce premiered 
“The River,” and a more moving or powerful performance I have yet to 
hear. That night, I and (I’m guessing) everyone else in attendance 
believed in the Promised Land.<br>
<br>
More than 30 years and well over 200 Springsteen shows later, I got a 
chance to talk to Bruce. The occasion was a reception for Steve Van 
Zandt’s Netflix show about gangsters hiding out in Lillehammer, Norway. 
It was a small party—I don’t know how I got invited—and the fact that 
Bruce was there inspired a great deal of anxiety. I had always 
maintained that what was meaningful to me was the art, not the artist. I
 had never tried very hard to interview Bruce, even while I was writing a
 book about him. I could tell he was a decent guy, but I still did not 
want any human imperfection to potentially pollute the space his music 
had occupied in my life. And there was certainly a good chance that I 
would say something silly and never be able to forget it. But then 
again, when was I ever going to get another chance like this? Wouldn’t I
 regret it for the rest of my life if I just chickened out?<br>
<br>
So we talked. What I decided to tell him, I kid you not, was the story 
of my daughter’s bat mitzvah. I explained to Bruce that I had written 
the service myself, and that he was the only Gentile whose writing had 
made it into the program, because one of his lyrics had convinced me, in
 my 38th year, that maybe I did want to have a kid after all. It’s from 
the song “Living Proof,” which Springsteen wrote after the birth of his 
son Evan. The key lyric went:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">In a world so hard and dirty<br>
so fouled and confused /<br>
Searching for a little bit of God’s mercy /<br>
I found living proof.</em><br>
<br>
I won’t pretend that the song by itself changed my mind about 
procreating. But it haunted me over time, forcing me to turn the matter 
over and over in my mind. Living proof of God’s mercy. That sounded 
pretty damn compelling, and I trusted Bruce, as I trusted few people in 
my life, to tell me the truth.<br>
<br>
When I told Bruce this story, he hugged me. Now, I’m not a hugger, but I
 let this one happen. We talked a little more about our kids and then, 
at about the 12-minute mark, I told Bruce I was going to have to cut 
things short. I couldn’t take the risk that he might say something that 
might, somehow, interfere with my relationship with the music. He put 
his arm around my shoulder and said something like “See you down the 
road, friend.” Amazing. I had wondered about how such a meeting might go
 for nearly 40 years, and here, it had come and gone nearly perfectly. 
How often is life like that? It’s almost enough to make you believe in …
 well, something.<br>
<br>
Is Bruce Jewish? Perhaps not. But world-famous rock stars don’t come any menschier.<br>

<strong class="text-strong">Springsteen conquered music and Broadway. Now he’s making movies.<br>
THE WASHINGTON POST<br>
By Ann Hornaday<br>
OCTOBER 17, 2019</strong><br>
   <br>
COLTS NECK, N.J. — “Ahh, it’s early!” Shortly after 9:30 on a warm 
autumn morning, Bruce Springsteen walks into the cozy kitchen-sitting 
area of Thrill Hill, the recording studio nestled into a corner of his 
Monmouth County farm. “For the first interview of my 70s, it’s early!<br>
<br>
<br>
A few days after turning 70, Springsteen looks tan and fit as he settles
 into a leather slingback chair, stretches his arms and runs his hands 
through brush-cut hair the color of steel shavings. This is the same 
room where “Western Stars,” a movie based on his recent album of the 
same name, was in postproduction over the summer, with co-director Thom 
Zimny editing at a nearby dining table as he listened to Springsteen 
working on the score in the next room. The movie had its world premiere 
at the Toronto International Film Festival in September; it opens in 
theaters on Oct. 25.<br>
<br>
Springsteen makes his feature directing debut with “Western Stars,” 
sharing a credit with Zimny and making official a fact that has been 
obvious to anyone who’s ever listened closely to his music: Bruce 
Springsteen — singer, songwriter, rock star, consummate showman, 
American icon — has always been a filmmaker. Whether in the form of 
widescreen, highly pitched epics or low-budget slices of daily life, 
Springsteen’s records have been less aural than immersive, unspooling 
with cinematic scope, drive and pictorial detail. Phil Spector might 
have built a wall of sound, but Springsteen used sound to build worlds.<br>
<br>
He greets the suggestion that he’s an auteur with one of his frequent 
self-effacing chuckles. But Springsteen admits that a cinematic point of
 view came naturally to him. “Movies have always meant a lot to me,” he 
says in his familiar rasp. “It’s probably just a part of being a child 
of the ’50s and ’60s and ’70s, when there was so much great filmmaking.”<br>
<br>
He grew up in a blue-collar, Irish Italian family at a time when the 
local bijou was still a vital community hub. “The Strand Theatre in 
Freehold, N.J., was dead in the center of town,” he recalls. “It was 
your classic old, small-town movie theater. Its main attraction was, 
‘Come on in, it’s cool inside.’ ”<br>
He laughs again.<br>
<br>
“It didn’t matter what they were playing, it was air-conditioned. So, on
 all those dead, small-town summer days, when it would get up into the 
90s in Freehold, you’d drift in no matter what was playing, and see what
 was on the screen.”<br>
<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s first album, “Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.,” 
introduced him in 1973 as an instinctively visual, character-driven 
storyteller. The title of his second album that year, “The Wild, the 
Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle” was inspired by a 1959 movie 
starring the icon of postwar American Westerns, Audie Murphy. The songs 
evoked everything from “West Side Story” to the edgy, urban style of 
young Martin Scorsese.<br>
<br>
But it was 1975’s “Born to Run” that brought Springsteen’s sensibility 
into its fullest expression. Structured as a day in the life of young 
people trying to escape their own dead, small-town summer days, the 
record plays like a movie of the mind’s eye, with propulsive movement, 
linear narrative and third-act catharsis.<br>
Zimny, who has directed several Springsteen music videos and 
documentaries and recently won an Emmy for “Springsteen on Broadway,” 
recalls listening to “Born to Run” long before the two worked together, 
and being particularly affected by the album’s most ambitious track: the
 street opera “Jungleland,” with its fugitive leading man, barefoot love
 interest and kids flashing guitars “just like switchblades.” The song 
“opened up a world of possibility for me,” he says, “because it just 
dealt in imagery. ‘Jungleland’ was the first time I heard a sax solo 
feel like a Technicolor film.”<br>
<br>
If “Born to Run” evoked the chrome, concrete and escapist fantasies of 
the movies Springsteen watched at the Strand, the lexicon of “Darkness 
on the Edge of Town” was grainier and less mannered, but still harked 
back to the imaginary worlds of his youth.<br>
“When I wrote ‘Born to Run’ and ‘Darkness,’ I saw them as B-pictures,” 
Springsteen says. “If they worked really well, they were good ones, and 
the songs I was unhappy with were bad ones.”<br>
He wanted both records “to have the breadth of cinema,” he says, “while 
at the same time remaining very, very personal for me. Those were the 
parameters of what I was imagining at that particular moment. I was sort
 of using the contours and the shape of films and movies, while at the 
same time trying to find myself in my work. But the film-ness of my 
songs was never far from my mind.”<br>
<br>
And it was a self-mythologizing vernacular that his audience immediately understood.<br>
<br>
“It was just how you processed everything,” he continues. “As a 
teenager, you were looking for a dramatic life. Where is my dramatic 
life? As if things weren’t dramatic enough. And you were writing your 
own script in your head as you walked down the street. It was all just 
part of living at that time.”<br>
<br>
Cinematic influences<br>
Jon Landau co-produced “Born to Run” and “Darkness on the Edge of Town” 
(as well as several subsequent records) and would talk with Springsteen 
for hours about music, novels and movies, a conversation that hasn’t 
ended (Landau has been Springsteen’s manager for 42 years). While they 
were making “Darkness,” he remembers, Springsteen told him about a movie
 he’d seen on TV, without catching the title. “He started to describe 
the film to me, and I said, ‘Oh, Bruce, that was “The Grapes of Wrath.” ’
 He said, ‘That’s about the greatest thing I’ve [ever] seen.’ I said, 
‘What did you like about it?’ And he said, ‘Everything. The look, the 
intensity, the focus, the artistry, everything.’ And I said, ‘Well, you 
know, John Ford directed that.’ And he said, ‘Oh, I’ve heard of him.’”<br>
<br>
That was the point, Landau says, when Springsteen “started looking at 
film in a whole different way. He started to make contact with great 
American cinema and it just grew and grew and grew.” Eventually, 
Springsteen formed his own canon of go-to movies, each of which has had 
an imprint on his records — Ford’s ambivalent Western epic “The 
Searchers,” noir classics “The Night of the Hunter” and “Out of the 
Past,” Scorsese’s “Mean Streets” and “Taxi Driver.” All share 
Springsteen’s love for poetic imagery, volatile emotion and deep 
misgivings about the American myth.<br>
<br>
“The Grapes of Wrath” would become the chief influence on Springsteen’s 
1995 record “The Ghost of Tom Joad,” just as the desolate acoustic mood 
of “Nebraska” had been inspired by “The Night of the Hunter,” Terrence 
Malick’s “Badlands” and the 1980s crime drama “True Confessions,” with 
Robert De Niro and Robert Duvall. “There was something about the 
stillness of it that affected the way that I wrote at the time,” 
Springsteen says. “The violence underneath.”<br>
<br>
Nearly every Springsteen record has its own musical signature but also 
its own production and lighting design, character arcs, and shot 
structure: the high-kicking production numbers of “Rosalita” and “Out in
 the Street.” The gleaming close-ups and jump-cut rhythms of “Born to 
Run.” The “East of Eden” Oedipal rage of “Adam Raised a Cain.” The 
erotic-thriller charge of “Candy’s Room” and “I’m On Fire.” The lurid 
neon nightscape of “Tunnel of Love.” The aging actors and magic-hour 
tonal values of “Western Stars.” Over the course of a nearly 50-year 
career, both as a solo performer and with the E Street Band, 
Springsteen’s music has become its own extended cinematic universe, 
populated by recurring characters, environments and themes: broken 
heroes. Rattrap towns. Dashed ideals and dogged faith in redemption. 
And, always, the beckoning highway<br>
<br>
Along with the characters he invented, Springsteen has shaped his 
persona to emulate musical heroes such as Elvis Presley and Woody 
Guthrie, as well as his favorite actors. On the cover of “Darkness on 
the Edge of Town” he could be Al Pacino imitating a young De Niro while 
wearing Marlon Brando’s T-shirt under James Dean’s leather jacket. 
Springsteen says he was “tremendously” influenced by all those actors as
 he sought to forge his identity as a performer.<br>
<br>
“Italian American actors from the 1970s had a huge impact on me,” he 
says. “If you came and saw us onstage in the ’70s, you saw a very 
theatrical performance. I was kind of channeling all of those actors 
from that time, and bringing them onstage with me.” Even the piratical 
high jinks with Miami Steve Van Zandt and the playful showdowns with 
Clarence Clemons felt like they sprang directly from the screen: 
Sharks-vs.-Jets by way of the Bowery Boys.<br>
<br>
It was also at that time — the first crest of his eventual superstardom —
 that Springsteen landed on the covers of both Time and Newsweek, 
prompting the inevitable calls from Hollywood. He met with Milos Forman,
 who considered him for “Hair.” And he laughs at a classic Kid, I like 
your moxie! moment with “King of the Gypsies” producer Dino De 
Laurentiis. “I was like, 25, and he was behind a big desk smoking a big 
cigar. It was just that entire scene, played out hilariously.”<br>
Eric Roberts eventually got that part. But Springsteen has no regrets. 
“I didn’t have the confidence at the time,” he says. “I thought, I don’t
 really deserve to be working in this arena right now, because I hadn’t 
done the homework. I hadn’t prepared myself. Whereas in music, I’d 
prepared myself thoroughly.”<br>
<br>
In a rock-and-roll world that prizes authenticity above all else, 
Springsteen has succeeded at both embodying unaffected sincerity and 
shrewdly deploying it as a brand: In addition to the unassuming men and 
women he valorized in his songs, perhaps his most brilliant character is
 “The Boss,” a Bruce-adjacent alter ego who, in hundreds of music 
videos, movie soundtracks and “Sopranos” needle-drops, has gone from 
scruffy boardwalk hustler to bandana-and-biceps teen idol to a 
multimillionaire in working-class drag.<br>
<br>
In the 1992 single “Better Days,” Springsteen sang about being “a rich 
man in a poor man’s shirt.” Today, in addition to the sprawling horse 
farm in New Jersey, he owns homes in Florida and Los Angeles, but still 
convincingly radiates man-of-the-people modesty, a contradiction he 
deflects by being the first person to call it an act. (“I made 
everything up!” he says at one point. “It’s a fascinating magic trick.”)
 Springsteen admits that he continues to find the notion of authenticity
 elusive, “knowing what a self-creation I was, and to some degree still 
am. But the strange thing of it all is that if you do it long enough, 
you start to become the thing that you pretended to be.”<br>
<br>
In fact, the man and the image feel so organically fused that 
Springsteen has become an emotional instrument in his own right. The 
latter-day meta-version of Bruce Springsteen, as seen in both 
“Springsteen on Broadway” and “Western Stars,” is simultaneously subject
 and protagonist, humble singer-songwriter and larger-than-life leading 
man.<br>
<br>
In both films, the camera often pushes in for a tight shot and stays 
there, a strategy that Landau notes is by design. “Some of that comes 
instinctively from our shared love of Sergio Leone, who is the man who 
proved that you could never be too close,” he explains. But it’s also 
the result of learning over the years that Springsteen is physically far
 more expressive than stylized visuals or manipulative edits. Even on 
huge stadium screens, Landau observes, the close-up has always been 
king. “The story of the song is on his face,” he says. “If you weren’t 
hearing the lyrics, you’d still have some idea of what he’s saying just 
from looking at him.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Beyond the music</strong><br>
<br>
As a movie, “Western Stars” began with a modest proposition. Instead of 
touring for the album, Springsteen intended to release a documentary of a
 performance he and his wife Patti Scialfa recorded over two days with a
 band and a 30-piece orchestra in their farm’s 100-year-old barn. “I 
said, ‘Okay, I’ll shoot the record start to finish,’ ” Springsteen 
recalls, “and that would be my tour.”<br>
<br>
But as he watched the concert footage, he realized that the songs and 
their lush ’70s-era arrangements needed more context. One night, while 
Scialfa watched TV, Springsteen spent a couple of hours writing 
introductions that became the voice-over script for “Western Stars.” He 
and Zimny went to the California desert near Joshua Tree, where 
Springsteen can be seen roaming amid the brush, reflecting on the 
American Dream, its disappointments, personal demons (“If I loved you 
deeply,” he says at one point, “I would try to hurt you.”) and his 
cardinal theme: “the struggle between individual freedom and communal 
life.”<br>
<br>
Eventually, “Western Stars” morphed from a straightforward concert doc 
to a sweeping montage and introspective portrait, composed of 
present-day footage, home movies, archival photographs and an achingly 
beautiful live performance. In the process, Zimny realized that 
Springsteen’s instincts as an image-maker were just as canny more than 
40 years after “Jungleland.” The two were in “constant communication” 
throughout filming, Zimny says, with Springsteen throwing out ideas far 
beyond just the music. “It’s getting texts, it’s getting imagery, it’s 
getting lines from a song and visual references.”<br>
<br>
At one point, Zimny received a text from Springsteen suggesting a shot 
of his hand on the steering wheel of a vintage El Camino, then a similar
 image, this time including Scialfa’s hand. The bookends made the final 
cut, symbols of freedom and community writ large, but also a man 
reconciling a lifetime of restlessness and all-consuming ambition to the
 consolations of domesticity and commitment.<br>
<br>
For Landau, the themes and imagery of “Western Stars” circle back to the
 conversations he and Springsteen had about their mutual love for John 
Ford decades ago. But mostly, he says, it reflects “the maturation of 
Bruce’s whole life of learning about film.” More than any previous movie
 or video, “this one is him from the get-go, 100 percent,” Landau says. 
“Every idea, word, sound, edit and cut.”<br>
Springsteen describes “Western Stars” as of a piece with both his 2016 
memoir and the Broadway show — a trilogy that, perhaps unconsciously, 
was part of his coming to terms with the birthday he just celebrated.<br>
“I was thinking, ‘How do I sum up my experience to this point?’ ” he 
says. “The book, the play and this film, they all serve that purpose. It
 kind of cleanses the palate and it will allow me to move on to whatever
 we do next.”<br>
<br>
The “we” in that sentence is the E Street Band and “next” is recording a
 new batch of songs he wrote for them earlier this year. Springsteen 
doesn’t see another movie in his immediate future, unless it’s the 
four-minute kind he’s been making all along.<br>
“Music was always enough for me,” he says philosophically. “Anything 
else that came along was just an adjunct, and an organic and happy 
accident that came from being a musician, which is what I wanted to be 
my whole life.”</div>

By Fraser Lewry (Classic Rock) a day ago Classic Rock  <br>
Bruce Springsteen and director Tom Zimny talk about how new concert movie Western Stars was made</strong><br>
<br>
Hello early morning film watchers," says Bruce Springsteen. "I hope you like my film."<br>
<br>
Springsteen is onstage at a cinema buried beneath a hotel in London's 
infamous Soho district, introducing his latest project. Having triumphed
 with Springsteen on Broadway and written one of rock's more honest 
autobiographies in Born To Run, The Boss has made a film.  <br>
It's a brief intro, but the movie does most of Springsteen's talking. 
Western Stars is beautiful film, shot live in a 100-year-old barn on 
Springsteen's New Jersey property and intercut with footage of The Boss 
out west, near Joshua Tree, driving dusty roads and philosophising.  <br>
<br>
Made with longtime collaborator Thom Zimny, who directed the Emmy 
Award-winning Springsteen on Broadway and has been been working with 
Springsteen for two decades, Western Stars finds the singer performing 
tracks from his Western Stars album accompanied by a 30-piece orchestra 
and a group of musicians including wife Patti Scialfa. <br>
<br>
It's a surprisingly intimate film considering the large number of 
players, and the barn itself is one of the stars of the show, swaddling 
players and punters alike in a hazy, whiskey-toned warmth. <br>
It's a moving, tender film. It's a film that's as much about growing old
 as it is about the power of performance. The shots of Springsteen and 
Scialfa sharing a mic, taking turns to sing lines from Stones, are 
poignant and lovely. And it's a film that cements Springsteen's growing 
reputation as one of rock's true elder statesmen, delivering wisdom with
 road-worn gravitas and no small amount of honesty.<br>
"I've spent 35 years learning to let go of the destructive parts of my 
character," says Springsteen, in one of the pieces that link the songs 
together. "And I still have days when I struggle with it."<br>
After the screening, Springsteen and director Zimny took part in a 
Q&amp;A with broadcaster Edith Bowman. An edited transcript is produced 
below. Western Stars opens in UK cinemas on October 28.   <br>
 <br>
<strong class="text-strong">What was the reason that you wanted to make this film?</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Thom Zimny:</strong> I think the first thing
 was that I got a call from Jon Landau saying that Bruce was going to 
check in. There was some new music that we wanted to just capture, and 
then I think after shooting it at the barn it evolved to doing some 
interviews and from there we started to look at the interviews and think
 about approaching it differently in the cutting room. We kind of found 
what we ended up with. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen:</strong> It was really 
just pragmatic because I made this record, and that took me a long time 
to make. I started it in 2012. You know, I'd put it away for a couple of
 years and go back to it. And then I had like 40 songs and I edited them
 all down and I had to find a record that I'd been making. <br>
But it was an unusual piece of music so I knew I wasn't going to tour on
 it and bring an orchestra. So I said, ‘well if I'm not going to perform
 it, maybe we could perform it once and film it that way people get a 
chance to see what it's like to play it.’ And so it just started with 
that. And initially it just started out as a performance film. I was 
gonna just shoot the record from start to finish. <br>
<br>
The whole performance was shot and we rehearsed once in New York, once 
in the barn, and then shot it for two days, and that's when it was done 
and the band were completely ready when I walked in. I had never seen 
them before, and I haven't seen them since. <br>
They're like ghosts of your imagination. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen:</strong> So it just 
started out as a performance film, and what's the next thing you do in a
 performance? Well, you interview the people who have performed and they
 say what a great guy I am and what an honour it is to work with me. So 
that's just what comes next, you know, so we did that. <br>
But at some point I said, ‘well gee, this is all new music, how am I 
going to get people into the inner life of these songs that they've 
never really heard before’, and I start with what I need to introduce 
them. And one night in front of the television I was sitting there and I
 just kind of started to scribble my thoughts down for each song. And it
 was all right there. So I ended up with the script that that is the 
voiceover. And then once we sort of had the voiceover, we needed 
something for it to voiceover. <br>
<br>
So Thom had some images and we shot a little film during the photo 
session for the record and we just started to play with that and it 
started to feel good over the voiceover and then I started to score the 
voiceover and that got us into this whole other section of the film. 
Which is really what turned it into a movie you know rather than just a 
concert film. You know, so it really kind of happened very organically 
and just bit by bit. <br>
These little films, they're so beautiful, like mantras.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen</strong>: It was very 
enjoyable because I got to go inside the songs again. And try to have a 
deeper understanding of what they were actually about. What was I 
actually trying to write about? While I was working on a meditation 
about men and women and love and the difficulty of love and how do you 
move from being an individual actor into a life that's filled with 
people and family and friends and some communal experience. <br>
Everybody has to walk that journey. And so the film was a study about 
what that trip is like, and the spoken pieces end up being just these 
meditations, you know these little tone poems that lead people into a 
deeper understanding of the music. <br>
Was it was obvious to you, Thom, in terms of when you were thinking 
about how you were going to shoot it and what it would look like 
visually, that it had this kind of real sort of filmic quality to it 
already? <br>
Thom Zimny: Well I think I immediately responded to the sonic landscape 
and as a filmmaker I could just feel listening to this album for the 
first time, the colour palette and just it evoked all kinds of 
references to cinema and just widescreen and when we shot the concert we
 had no idea it would end up being a movie at all.<br>
But we did shoot it in a way that gave those sweeping barn shots and I 
was really responding to the sonic qualities and listening to those 
arrangements with the strings, because for me it evokes all kinds of 
feelings of visuals and a landscape even before we start. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen:</strong> When I write in 
character, in other words, I'm writing these narrative short stories 
about, you know, it's a way of exposing your own inner life and 
struggles but you're writing all the details of someone else's life, you
 know.<br>
I tend to write real cinematically when I do that whether it's Nebraska 
or The Ghost Of Tom Joad or Devils &amp; Dust. Those are all my short 
story records and really, they're my little movies that that I script 
out before. And so, those songs are always suggestive of a visual 
landscape. <br>
You look great driving a car as well. Oh man.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen:</strong> When in doubt I just get in and drive the car. What are we going to do with this song? Ahh, drive the car [laughs]. <br>
There's some beautiful old footage as well. And I wanted to touch on 
that footage and where it came from and making the decisions about what 
you would use for that. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Thom Zimny:</strong> For me this is a space 
where I'm just really grateful to have this collaboration with Bruce 
because if you can imagine I have his voiceover that is really powerful 
and you have nothing there. And I am so happy to have that space of 
trust that I can throw up some old Super 8 and we can both sit in the 
room and wait until that thing happens that I can't put into words, 
which is it.<br>
It feels right. It's magical. A home movie from the 50s or we explored 
things on a rainy Saturday afternoon with home movies that as a 
filmmaker I had nine cameras and Bruce discovered a clip that you shot 
your honeymoon. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen:</strong> Yeah but if you 
look at the films that Thom chose it's all ritual, ritual, ritual, 
ritual. The things that connect us: weddings, parties, family, dancing, 
the things that keep our heads above water, and so Thom dug out all that
 beautiful archival footage that really suggest all those things you 
know, and then he also found the home footage of my honeymoon.<br>
That's my honeymoon. A log cabin we decided it was a good idea and it 
was 1988 and he hadn't seen it before, so he had archived some of my 
home movies and pulled that stuff out. It was fun to get in the film. <br>
That's an amazing trust to have with each other.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen:</strong> Well we've been 
together a long time. Right from the beginning Thom's trustworthiness 
was always without question and he's just somebody I feel like I could 
do anything with cinematically I can say, ‘gee this is great or man I'm 
not looking so good in that shot’. I can kind of say or do anything with
 Thom and Thom always responds and he's a beautiful collaborator so I'm 
very lucky. <br>
<br>
There are pieces where it might go to black for a second or two after a 
performance before it goes on to the next thing and it almost feels like
 you're giving us a chance to either exhale or just take a moment. Was 
that deliberate?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Thom Zimny:</strong> I think this is 
reflective of a lot of the records that I listened to - actually what 
I'm thinking about is just like Born To Run in the seconds between those
 songs, the importance of those moments and I remember sitting in the 
kitchen editing room next to the studio and we would watch it in real 
time and then just wait for that natural gut moment. OK. Let's carry the
 story on those details matter. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen</strong>: It's like 
sequencing a record, all good records and all good cinema has rhythm. 
And you know you're trying to gently lead your audience on this journey,
 and so you're timing their breaths you know and good timing is 
essential in the filmmaking just as it is in music. So those, just those
 brief moments allow you to sort of collect your thoughts about what you
 just saw and just long enough to prepare for that next thought. <br>
<br>
Stones for me is just extraordinary and it's a different performance on 
the film than it is on the record. You have Patti singing with you, when
 you're singing together on the mic. Extraordinary.<br>
Bruce Springsteen: I should have had Patti on the record, you know, that
 was a big mistake because it's all about men and women and Patti brings
 so much and we've been together for such a long time, for 30 years, and
 so that's a lot of experience around that one little microphone.<br>
So we bring all of that the minute we lean in. Oh my Lord, there's this 
whole 30 years of emotional life together between us. She's wonderful 
and even when she's not singing with me, if you dig deep down into the 
centre of the film, she's there. <br>
We feel like you're really letting us in on such an intimate moment really.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen</strong>: Thom edited it all of that and caught all that himself. You know so that, he found all those moments. <br>
Well you only shot it in May, is that right? That's an amazing kind of turnaround for something so cinematic and beautiful. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Thom Zimny:</strong> These experiences get a
 little bit blurry in the sense that you just dive into this deep dream 
and then all of a sudden we were cutting and Bruce said ‘let's go to the
 desert’ and then we're in the middle of the desert and we're shooting 
and then before you know it I'm back in the cutting room and there's new
 score coming in and in a strange way we just keep very concentrated 
energy at it at all times. And it's a little fuzzy afterwards. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What is your drive, and where does that drive come from?</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen:</strong> I'm a man of 
many talents. You know I write books and Broadway plays and now l'm 
making movies. I'm going to try being an astronaut next, I’ll let you 
know how that goes. I've been lucky I think some of it might have to do 
with you know you're turning that, you know, you're getting to that age 
where you sort of, you’re summing up a lot of what you've learned and 
what your life has been and so the writing a book really was the first 
chapter and me doing that I suppose and then the play came out of the 
book and in a funny way you know this sort of came out of the play.<br>
You know there's some relation to that so I've had a really, really good
 run over the past five years as far as feeling really inspired and 
being really creative. I've done things I've never done before. It's 
been, I feel very lucky for that because you never know. <br>
I did hear you say on telly last night that you are going to tour though, you’re going back out on the road?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen</strong>: Yeah yeah I got to go back to the day job, you know, got to pay the bills, got to pay the bills. <br>
<br>
What's the catalyst for you to start a record?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen:</strong> I just hope I 
can write something because you always think you're never gonna write 
again because you can't explain writing. Writing is a mystery. Anything 
creative remains a mystery. Am I gonna ever write another song? Because 
you often think I have no ideas.<br>
I'm simply wandering around for a year without any ideas or any 
inspiration and so suddenly something comes along and you find another 
vein in your creative mind that you can tap. And so for this record it 
was sort of the Southern California, Burt Bacharach, Jimmy Webb and I 
said gee and it can come down to something as simple as OK, major 7th 
chords I've never written with major 7th chords. What if I tried to 
write some songs that had that feeling and suddenly something you're 
into something fresh, so you have all these new ideas and that's the 
key.<br>
<br>
The key is the hardest thing to do is write rock music because I've 
written a lot of it. But in a funny way the play and the book and these 
are all things that were very fresh and so I had a lot of new ideas as 
to what creative direction to go in but that's always the challenge as 
you get older you have to, you know. I always say your audience wants 
you to do two things, they want to feel at home they say and surprise 
me, you know, what you have to do those two things at the same time, you
 know, and then you've kind of clicked on something and your journey 
with your listeners continues down the line you know.<br>
So I'm feeling good. You know I'm lucky. I mean they have such a big 
audience at this point around the world and that supports my work as is,
 I don't ever take it for granted. You know, it's a wonderful thing and I
 enjoy providing fresh pieces of work and ideas you know, for them. <br>
There's another track in the film that isn't on the album: Rhinestone Cowboy. I love that song.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen</strong>: That was just 
tossed in at the end because we got to that, as well see you know, 
there's a little on a dark side, so, which this story was and was not. 
And that was just the tip of the hat to a lot of my inspiration. The 
inspiration for the record and film so it's great. <br>
Did you know it was coming?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Thom Zimny:</strong> No I was just thinking about that. I think I found out like three minutes before shooting. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen:</strong> Man we've got to do Rhinestone Cowboy! This isn't finished until we do Rhinestone Cowboy. <br>
I think that this film will give so many people the opportunity to 
address so many issues that you raise in these wonderful little films in
 between the songs.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen:</strong> I wish them a lot of luck. You know. It's complicated shit. <br>
I can't not talk about the barn. Just from watching it on screen it's a magical place.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen:</strong> The barn is 
pretty cool. You know, it just came with the property and we rebuilt the
 bottom for the horses and upstairs hasn't been touched since the late 
eighteen hundreds.<br>
<br>
So all that was, has been there for a hundred years and it's just a, you
 walk into that upstairs and it's just an incredible, incredible space, 
you know, so we have our parties and weddings and we built that little 
bar that's up there, all that is up there not just for the film. That's 
actually how we keep it. So it's kind of neat. <br>
It was fun. You know, it was like you have all that power off to your 
right. And I haven't played with a string section before you know just a
 little, very little bit but not in that way. And it sounded really good
 inside the barn so it was very inspiring. We sung every song twice. I 
think we did everything twice, shot it for two days and used almost 
exclusively the second day. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What would you like people to take away from this film?</strong><br>
Bruce Springsteen: Well you know, you come in to see it and you're with 
your gal and you sit down and you're watching it. Gets towards the end 
and you hold hands.</div>

<br>
In April 2010, " Ain't Got You", started the "Springsteen 
interview/article thread" which  had about 100 articles some of which, 
have been transferred to this thread. Thanks for that.  With the help of
 a lot of people, this Index is now the most comprehensive source of 
articles, reviews, interviews, essays and rants about Bruce Springsteen 
on the internet. <br>
<br>
Looking back on the contents, there is something for everyone here and I
 am confident there is nothing like it to be found anywhere else. There 
are doctral thesis, more than a hundred contemporaneous newspaper gig 
reviews plus almost all of the famous articles spanning Bruce's 
remarkable career (not all of them complimentary) and also many, many 
interviews. There are contributions from all over the English speaking 
world but alas, not nearly enough translations from Europe which would 
really improve its reach. There are contributions from Marxists, 
Darwinists, atheists and people of deep religious faith. There are 
pieces by Republicans and Democrats and also by anarchists, feminists 
and just plain folk. Four of the articles exceed 70,000 words - in other
 words, there is enough here to satisfy all tastes. At the moment, it is
 very Bruce- centric and perhaps it should be expanded to cover band 
members and influences. <br>

Bruce Springsteen:&nbsp;Western Stars— Songs From The Film (Columbia)<br>
Rating: *****<br>
Verdict: Stylish big screen portrait</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
We are&nbsp;now in an era of the pop album as an extended franchise, rather than simply a stand-alone release.<br>
Oxford band Foals today unveil the second instalment of their Everything
 Not Saved Will Be Lost LP (see below), while Sting’s My Songs is 
repackaged next month as a double album to form the basis of his 
forthcoming Las Vegas residency.<br>
Another getting in on the act is Bruce Springsteen, who has turned new 
album Western Stars into a full-length film with its own soundtrack. 
He’s pulling out all the stops to make it a success, too.<br>
<br>
<br>
Famously averse to hyperbole — he once tore down his own publicity 
posters outside Hammersmith Odeon — he has been avidly promoting this 
latest venture.<br>
<br>
The past week saw him appear on The Graham Norton Show and attend two advance screenings in London.&nbsp;<br>
And, as he told cinemagoers, his move to the big screen is part of the 
stock-taking that comes with turning 70, as he did last month.<br>
<br>
It’s a process that has also included an autobiography and last year’s Broadway residency.<br>
‘I’m getting to that age where you’re summing up a lot of what you’ve learned,’ he said during a live Q&amp;A.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
Writing a book was the first chapter. The play came out of the book and 
this [the film] came out of the play. I’ve had a good run over the past 
five years as far as feeling inspired goes. I’ve done things I’ve never 
done before. I feel lucky for that . . . because you never know.<br>
<br>
‘I’m a man of many talents,’ he went on. ‘I write books and Broadway 
plays. Now I’m making movies. I’m going to try being an astronaut next,’
 he joked. At least I think he was joking.<br>
Bruce certainly reaches for the skies on a film made with long-term 
collaborator Thom Zimny. The project frames the singer in an intimate 
setting, in stark contrast with his reputation as a stadium rock god.<br>
<br>
Backed by a band and full orchestra, and performing in a converted barn 
in the grounds of his New Jersey home, he sings the original album 
tracks in chronological order, adding a commanding cover of Glen 
Campbell’s Rhinestone Cowboy to finish — ‘a tip of the hat to a lot of 
my inspiration’.<br>
<br>
The film isn’t a straight performance picture, with the live takes 
interspersed with Super 8 footage from Bruce’s childhood and a playful 
clip from his honeymoon.<br>
The album’s character-driven story-songs are inspired largely by the 
American West, so we are shown lots of Breaking Bad- style desert 
scenes, with Bruce looking moody behind the wheel of his pick-up 
truck.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
His scripted voiceover gives Western Stars a loose narrative thread and 
the film opens with an explanation of how his songwriting was inspired 
by the two contrasting sides of the American character.<br>
‘One is transient, restless, solitary,’ he says. ‘The other is 
collective and communal in its search for family, deep roots and a home 
for the heart to reside.’<br>
<br>
The original album — a lush affair influenced by songwriters such as 
Burt Bacharach and Jimmy Webb — was a skilful homage. The cinematic 
update, boosted by the spontaneity of live performance and the acoustic 
properties of Bruce’s cavernous barn, feels like a proper Springsteen 
record.<br>
<br>
The presence of his wife Patti Scialfa helps.&nbsp;<br>
Springsteen admits it was ‘a big mistake’ not to utilise Patti on the 
original album and her fresh vocal arrangements add a new dimension to 
Sundown and Stones, the latter an astonishing performance featuring the 
husband and wife duo together on the microphone.<br>
<br>
Elsewhere, Tucson Train is looser and richer while The Wayfarer is lifted by improvised piano.&nbsp;<br>
Chasin’ Wild Horses is introduced with a telling aside from a singer once born to run.<br>
As he says: ‘You can run away for a while, but you can’t run away 
forever,’ reiterating the emotional punch packed by this engaging 
director’s cut.<br>
<br>
Springsteen turned Western Stars into a film because he wanted to 
promote it, but didn’t want to go on the road with an orchestra. ‘It’s 
an unusual piece of music,’ he admits. And it is.<br>
He plans to use his regular group, The E Street Band, for his next album and tour.&nbsp;<br>
‘I’ve got to go back to the day job,’ he says. ‘You have to pay the bills.’</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Springsteen talks mental health, therapy, John Wayne and Western Stars: The full transcript<br>
Chris Jordan  Asbury Park Press<br>
Oct 21, 2019</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is a John Wayne fan. So it is after listening to his 
latest album, “Western Stars,” and watching Springsteen's new movie of 
the same name. There are a few visual and verbal references to the Duke 
in both the movie and the song “Western Stars.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen and I began a recent interview talking about Wayne, then 
delved into other things “Western Stars”-related and touched on several 
other topics. Springsteen, wearing a dark dress shirt, shoes and sport 
jacket with jeans, was courteous, thoughtful, quick-witted and easy with
 a laugh.<br>
Read our story based on this interview here, and five takeaways here.<br>
<br>
It wasn’t the first time we chatted. Over the years, we had met several 
times around the Asbury Park area, talking on and off the record about 
the events of the day, or a show he had participated in.  This time, 
sitting down for a 45-minute interview conducted in the basement lounge 
of a New York City hotel about two weeks ago, Springsteen had one 
request beforehand: Could we turn the air-conditioning off? I was glad 
he asked. I was concerned the racket might drown him out on my tape 
recorders.<br>
<br>
Q: Tell me a little about John Wayne? You mention John Wayne in the song
 "Western Stars," you do the great framing of the Ethan in the doorway 
shot (from "The Searchers" in "Western Stars") and then, Bruce, you say 
"Pilgrim" at the end. But the thing about John Wayne is that rock ’n’ 
roll hasn’t embraced John Wayne since Buddy Holly.<br>
A: Right, "That’ll Be the Day."<br>
<br>
Q: Tell me what John Wayne means to you and maybe this is a moment where
 a certain type of person can embrace John Wayne a little bit more.<br>
A: I don’t know, it’s sort of intertwined in my life. If you grew up as a
 child in the ’50s of course he was just a huge Western star, he was the
 Western star and the civilized Western man all through the ’50s and 
’60s. So I think he fell out of favor due to his right-wing politics, 
but the films he made are eternal. They’re just beautiful and forever 
and his performances in them are things of wonder as far as I’m 
concerned. I’ve always been a big fan, you know. I always found a 
sweetness and a tenderness in them, particularly in ‘She Wore a Yellow 
Ribbon.’ That whole ensemble that John Ford used was an amazing group of
 characters, a wonderful group of actors who worked, Ward Bond, who 
worked so well together. So it was a big part of my aesthetic life. 
Clint Eastwood also, of course, he was a sort of opposite end of the 
spectrum. But John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Gary Cooper – they were towering 
figures to me as a child.<br>
<br>
Q: The Western motif, what do you do when you go to the West? You go 
there to become a man, to learn gun-slinging, you learn to face your 
fears. But also you go out West for the homestead, to set up a future 
for yourself and your family. To me, those are elements "Western Stars" 
speaks to, unless I’m over thinking it?<br>
A: No, that dichotomy is there. It’s a part of life but it was certainly
 a part of Western life. You had two kinds of people that left. There 
were people who just were always looking over the rise, they were these 
strange loners, and then you had wagon trains filled with people who 
went out to build a society and build churches and schools and 
communities and families. So it was a home for both kinds of Americans 
and really they brought that dichotomy with them. <br>
Q: I love how you threw in the element of people on the fringes of show 
business (in "Western Stars"). You have the stunt driver ("Drive Fast 
(The Stuntman))," you have the "Western Stars" guy, you have a Nashville
 songwriter ("Somewhere North of Nashville"). To me that shows … I think
 empathy is in short supply these days. You’re at the height of your 
profession, but you’ve walked those tracks. <br>
A: Those were, once again, just characters I was interested in and I 
felt I could write about them in a certain moment. I’ve been involved in
 writing these Western stories for quite a while. If you go back to "Tom
 Joad" (1995’s "The Ghost of Tom Joad"), you have all the border songs 
that I wrote at the time. If you go to (the 2005 album) "Devils and 
Dust," (the songs) "Silver Palomino," "Black Cowboys" and "Matamoros 
Banks," so I’ve been writing in the geography for quite a while and this
 particular record allowed me to sort of draw on what are to me Western 
musical influences along with Western stories. So I said, "What’s the 
modern West?" It’s Hollywood, it’s Los Angeles. I went searching there 
for a few interesting characters to write about.<br>
<br>
Q: To this day, I think it’s beyond a mythology, people view the West 
as, "I’m going to go West and make my name." Even yourself, you guys 
went out West, as depicted in "Springsteen on Broadway." It’s still the 
golden land.<br>
A: Well, it was for my parents. It was my father (Douglas Springsteen) 
who was the motivation, but he was going to leave Freehold and he didn’t
 think of going to Pittsburgh or Florida, he wanted to go to California.
 What did he know about California? Nothing! As a matter of fact, I had a
 girlfriend who had been to San Francisco, and they were asking her for 
advice as to where to go. <br>
<br>
Q: Oh, no.<br>
A: So he knew absolutely nothing about California or the West except 
that was where he wanted to go to begin his new life. And he took my 
mother (Adele Springsteen), and my sister (Pam Springsteen) with him and
 that’s where they went, and that’s what they did. You know, they were 
like Okies. They spent $3,000, that was all the money they had. They 
spent two nights in the car and a night in a motel on the way out there.
 They just built everything from scratch when they got there. The first 
time I visited them they were in a tiny little apartment in San Mateo 
and I was 20 or 21. The idea that continues to hold true for a large 
portion of the country, when people think of creating something new, or 
becoming something new, that lure of a place to restart your life, 
retrace your steps, erase you sins, continues to be Westward.<br>
<br>
Q: Even to this day, Silicon Valley’s out in the West. You kind of 
followed them, too. In the movie you state a girl on the East Coast 
broke your heart, what do you do? "I went out West."<br>
A: Yeah (laughs)! Same thing! I was like, OK, I got to get out of here. I
 got to get as far away on the continental United States as I can!<br>
<br>
Q: Yes sir!<br>
A: And so (laughs) that was the deal for me! Same thing. And it wasn’t 
easy to get there in those days  because no one had money for a plane or
 a train, so every time we wanted to go to California, it was usually 
with an old friend of mine Tinker (Carl West), we got into an old 
beat-up station wagon and we drove ourselves there. I was lucky I had a 
little outpost with my parents there after a while. And I went to do the
 same thing, I went with no plans on coming back. I thought I was going 
to go and begin a new career somewhere outside of San Francisco and I 
thought I would be able to do that with some difficulty, perhaps, but I 
thought I’d be able to do it. But at the end of the day I couldn’t.<br>
<br>
Q: Wow. So for me the movie has elements of "The Searchers," a little "Sunset Boulevard," with the darker side of Hollywood.<br>
A: There’s tiny little quotes from all my favorite things in there. Visual quotes.<br>
<br>
Q: To me, and I heard you say this — I watched a YouTube of the Toronto 
(International Film Festival) Q&amp;A — that it was a love letter to 
Patti (Scialfa). <br>
A: Right… <br>
<br>
Q: About how Patti helped you on this journey, not the physical journey 
to the West, but a journey to a better place. Do you feel it’s good and 
you’re lessening the stigma for other people who need a little help when
 it comes to therapy. In the play and the book ("Born to Run"), you said
 you grew up in a household where if there was that outlet, maybe things
 would have been different.<br>
A: It would have been a vastly different household. Everybody needs all 
the help they can get, that’s the bottom line. You know, I came to it 
relatively late in life.  I was in my 30s and it was and continues to be
 very valuable to me, it’s something … it’s been a very positive force 
as far as me sorting through my life and getting to a place where you 
can love somebody and receive love and Patti was an enormous, enormous 
part of bringing all of that into my life, that I had resisted and 
failed to be able to do earlier. You know, she was a very strong and 
supportive and a powerful woman, very loving and I got into a place 
where I was, I kind of dug myself into a black hole. It took quite a 
while to dig myself out of it and it took a lot of help from a lot of 
different places. So I’m very grateful for it and a part of what the 
film is a thank you to my lovely wife.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: Do you see, perhaps, there will be a benefit of it? If Bruce Springsteen needs help, I can ask, too?<br>
A: I don’t know. It’s sort of a thing where I just started talking about
 it because it was such a large part of my life and at some point 
something you’ve been doing for 30 years and it’s had such a deep 
influence on you, it’s something that comes up in conversation at some 
point. But everybody has to find their own way but if I had grown up in a
 house, say, where that had been part of our resources, it would have 
been a very different life. But, who knows, you don’t know at the end of
 the day where the fuel for the fire comes from. I don’t have any 
regrets, but it would have been a lot easier on my parents and on my 
father if he had recourse for some help.<br>
<br>
Q: Also, as was said at the Toronto Q&amp;A and it makes sense to me, 
too, this is almost part of a trilogy of you really going deep for your 
art, for the stories that you’re telling. The trilogy being the movie, 
the book and the play. That makes sense to me, does it make sense to 
you? <br>
A: I think probably coming up on 70 had something to do with it and just
 being at a certain point in your life and your work life where you felt
 prepared to sort of summarize the trip you’ve been on for quite a 
while. It all happened as an accident. The book came along as a result 
of us playing the Super Bowl (in 2009), and me writing a short essay 
about it that we put online and a few weeks following that I just 
started to write what became the book. And then out of the book, really,
 the play came, because I was asked by President Obama the last couple 
of weeks he was in office, "Gee, you never played in Washington, love to
 have you come down and play at the White House." So the last few weeks 
he was in the White House, Patti said, "Yeah, you should go down and do 
it." I don’t know, I don’t want to bring the band, it’s too big of a 
job, well maybe I’ll just go down and play some acoustic songs. I said 
maybe I’ll introduce some of the acoustic songs with some of the things 
I’ve written in the book and I spent about two afternoons in my studio, 
ended with … 90 minutes of what the Broadway show became. I went down 
there, I had the spoken pieces and I had the music pieces, at the end of
 the night he came up on stage and said, "Gee, I know you only did that 
for us, but it should be a show" (laughs).<br>
<br>
Q: I’m sorry, did President Obama say that? <br>
A: Yeah.<br>
<br>
Q: Oh, for crying out loud.<br>
A: So on the way back Jon (Landau, manager), Patti and I, we’re all 
thinking that was something I hadn’t done before. The alchemy was just 
something I simply hadn’t done before. And so we said maybe we should do
 a show, but we need a small audience. I did it for only 250 people in 
the East Room of the White House. So we said we need someplace small. 
Where are the beautiful small theaters? Well, they’re on Broadway. So we
 ended up looking around for some theaters, and we found the Walter 
Kerr, and Jordan Roth (owner of the Kerr, a Jujamcyn Theater). And then I
 ended up writing about another hour’s worth of material. It came 
together very fast and accidentally and the film came about sort of 
similarly in that sense as well, I’m not going to tour, so maybe I’ll 
just do a film of me doing a performance of the music with a big 
orchestra somewhere – in a theater or around home somewhere. We ended up
 doing it in the barn (on Springsteen’s Colts Neck property) and once it
 was finished, we said OK, we’ll do the normal sort of interviews: What 
was it like to play on the sessions? What a nice guy I am. How great it 
was to work with me, all the usual stuff (laughs). But before that 
actually happened, I started to look at some of the performances, and 
it’s all new music. How am I going to draw people in to what I’m doing? 
Well, I think I need some sort of exposition that occurs before each 
song. So I sat at home one night and spent about two hours and wrote the
 whole script for all the spoken parts for the rest of the film.<br>
<br>
Q: Oh wow. That fast, huh?<br>
A: Yeah, it was all there waiting to come out. It was in the record, it 
just hadn’t been verbalized. Then we started to use them as just 
voiceovers, and then we needed images to accompany the voiceovers. So 
Thom (Zimny, "Western Stars" co-director) had some found images. We had a
 little bit that we shot in Joshua Tree National Park with Danny Clinch.
 Those fit really well. Then we went out and spent a couple of days 
shooting our own footage and came back, then I scored all of that and 
suddenly we had something that turned into an actual movie, turned into 
an actual film. But it was something that happened very organically, 
there was no initial plan out in front. So all of those three things 
really have kind of summarized a lot of my work and my life to this 
point, were all things that happened somewhat accidentally. Obviously 
the timing was right and it was the kind of work I was ready and anxious
 to do.  But all those three things, I’m very proud of all those three 
things. I think they’re three of the best things I’ve ever done.<br>
<br>
Q: Yes sir. The songs of "Western Stars," I heard that this material was
 around for a little bit. Were the songs of "Western Stars" the first of
 this trilogy?                       <br>
A:  Yeah, the songs of "Western Stars" have been around since 2012 when I
 started to write them. I wrote a lot of them on tour. I slowly recorded
 them but I recorded them within a group of about 40 other songs, so 
there was a lot of material and I didn’t know where the album was, or 
what the album was. It took me quite a while to figure that and take the
 12 or 13 songs that we ended up using. You’re like a sculpture with a 
big block of stone in front of you. It just took a long time to chisel 
it down to those 13 songs on that particular record. So I had the music 
for quite a while and "Wrecking Ball" came along, and that seemed more 
speaking to the moment so we cut that record and of course, when you 
make a record like that, you’re out on a big tour that lasts a year and a
 half. So that’s two years that goes by the wayside pretty quickly. 
Every record project has a two year cycle to it for the most part.But I 
always had that music, and I always went back to it and it was a 
question of this seems like a little one-off record, I don’t know who’s 
going to be interested in it, but eventually I just worked on it. Ron 
Aiello came in and he worked on it with me. Really, Ron Aiello, the 
first time we worked together, the first idea was to finish "Western 
Stars" a long time ago! We worked on it until suddenly it became 
something that was really quite unique and different than what I’ve done
 in the past. The orchestras and the sound of the record and its Western
 influences and the settings of the music gave it a certain freshness 
that I enjoyed very much.    <br>
                   <br>
Q: Did you acknowledge to yourself when you were writing the songs that 
you were going into pretty personal spaces with "Western Stars" in 2012?
 <br>
A: We always sort of do that. I’m not noticing it any more than I’m 
normally am, I’m simply trying to write the best song I can, and 
whatever that entails is where I do. So I’m not really thinking about, 
I’m just trying to come up with the best piece of music that I can and 
wherever that is, wherever I can find that, that’s where I go.<br>
<br>
Q-What was it like working, I think you did some recording with David Sancious (for "Western Stars")?<br>
A- Yeah I did. He’s worked on my records a little bit over the years. 
He’s just always a pleasure to work with, he’s one of the best musicians
 I’ve ever known in my life, he’s an incredible musician, guitarist, 
pianist and still a great, great friend so it’s always a pleasure to 
have Davey on my records.<br>
<br>
Q: "Hitch Hiking" starts off the record and I think I hitch-hiked once or twice in the ’80s, by mistake.<br>
A: It’s pretty late by then. By the ’80s it was already considered too dangerous I suppose. <br>
<br>
Q: I was going to ask you about that. People don’t hitch-hike anymore?<br>
A: It’s done as an art form.<br>
<br>
Q: Do people hitch-hike in other parts of the country, or the world? They don’t hitch-hike in Jersey no more.<br>
A: If you see a hitch-hiker anywhere, even out West, it’s pretty rare. 
But in the ’60s and the ’70s, it was very common. That was my only form 
of transportation till I made "Born to Run." Literally through my first 
two albums, I was still getting around hitch-hiking up and down the 
Jersey Shore. <br>
<br>
Q: That is great. I’m listing to that song and I’m thinking that must 
have been a wealth of experiences and stories for you, that maybe you 
tapped into throughout your career? Because you’re in the cabin of this 
car, talking…<br>
A: You got to understand, I hitch-hiked … Every. Single. Day. Every day I
 went from Freehold to Manasquan, about 20 miles there, about 20 miles 
back and it’s probably three, four five car rides there, three, four, 
five back unless you hit somebody who happens to be going to your 
destination. I did that from when I was 15 to when I was 24. So I 
hitch-hiked for almost 10 years, really constantly. So it was an easy 
song to write (laughs).<br>
<br>
Q: The last time I hitch-hiked I was scratching my head at 3 o ’clock in
 the morning across the street from your former bungalow  (in Long 
Branch) and somebody picked me up. You know what, later I’m thinking I 
shouldn’t have jumped in that car, but the guy gave me a ride. I think 
my favorite song is, and I love it so much, is "There Goes My Miracle." 
I’m thinking Walker Brothers on that, and even the drumming part on 
that, you might even have a track going on too, but it’s almost like a 
funky drummer thing going on.    <br>
A: It’s something Ron threw on. <br>
Q: It’s glorious. That to me is the peak of orchestra there on that record.       <br>
A: Yeah, Ron had a little drum loop going. Yeah, I would say it’s Walker
 Brothers, Righteous Brothers, it’s sort of a classic, we’ll say 
Southern California pop orchestral piece. It’s the most accessible thing
  on the record, I suppose, it’s something that on another day it sounds
 like  it might have had a shot at being a single (laughs).<br>
<br>
Q: I’m a sucker for any song that talks about the rules. Any song that 
lays out the rules I’m down with. How many days did you guys do the 
recording of the songs in the barn on your property in Colts Neck (for 
the movie)?  <br>
A:  The whole project of the initial recording was just four days. There
 were two days of filming, a day of rehearsal, sort of filming a little 
bit, and then a day of pure rehearsal. Then I did a session up in New 
York of studio instrumentals with the band before we came down to New 
Jersey. The whole thing happened in four days.<br>
Q: Tell me about Rob Mathes (the orchestra conductor for "Western Stars")? You gave him a big role in this?<br>
A: Well, I need a lot of help when it comes to orchestrating something. 
The way I do it is sort of the way that I record when I’m recording on 
my own. I do everything really quick. I’ll sing a song to a track, to a 
loop – just me and an acoustic guitar. Everything on ‘Western Stars’ 
initially started with me, an acoustic guitar and little drum loop. Then
 I run around and put all the instruments on and it takes me about two 
hours. Then I listen to see if I have a song worth working on. If I do, 
I’ll continue working on it a little bit, but Ron Aiello will come in 
and really kind of does a lot of homework as far as taking the rough 
things I did and making them sound much better. But I would come up with
 all of the string parts, the lines and the different orchestrations but
 to actually have a string section play it, it’s got to be written out 
and it has to be notated and so Rob Mathes comes in and does that and 
adds his creativity to it also. So he was very, very valuable. Rob put 
together the entire orchestra and band that I played with in the film. I
 walked in in New York City and played with a rhythm section and they 
knew everything better than I did – it was the first time I met some of 
them. So I walked in, said hello, played the album from start to finish,
 and I was trying to keep up with the band, who were so good, and Rob 
had directed then so well, that they knew everything. So we spent the 
next four days together and that was that (laughs). So Rob was a 
wonderful collaborator. <br>
<br>
Q: You put a lot of faith in him and it sounds….<br>
A: He’s great, he’s a serious secret weapon, Rob Mathes. He works for a lot of people, he’s incredible.<br>
<br>
Q: Panic at the Disco, I think he produced a couple of records for them.
 Local guy, does a lot of high profile gigs, Marc Muller has a big 
presence on the record, the steel guitar.<br>
A: He’s incredible. Great musician, great guy, beautiful steel on all of
 the stuff, just so evocative. A wonderful musician and wonderful guy.<br>
<br>
Q: Tell me about your role co-directing ("Western Stars") with Mr. 
Zimny? Would you, sometimes, in the middle of a take … I’m curious about
 how that worked?<br>
A: Well, basically the film is a collaboration between the two of us. 
Once we had the performance pieces,  the conceptionalizing of the 
voiceovers and all the interstitial pieces that really turn it into more
 of a film, it was something that we worked on together and Thom was 
generous enough to say, ‘Hey, we collaborated on this, you co-directed 
this with me,’ and that’s how it came about. But I’m not behind the 
camera (laughs).<br>
<br>
Q: Any chance of doing these songs with E Street Band? Have you heard (Steven Van Zandt’s) version of "Tucson Train"? <br>
A: Yeah, he played it for me a few days ago, I think I heard it last week.<br>
<br>
Q: It’s good.<br>
 A: It’s great – it’s fun. It was really terrific.<br>
<br>
Q: Is that kind of planting a seed that maybe we would hear some of these songs…. <br>
 A: I don’t know, something might come out. But I don’t have any plans 
of featuring it in our next E Street Band tour. It’s really an 
experience of its own, like a lot of my other records tend to be 
sometimes. I won’t know ’til I get there.<br>
<br>
Q: Hey, I was at the Monmouth County Historical Association (in 
Freehold) the other day, and they have a new exhibit, "Springsteen: His 
Hometown," and the Springsteen Archives are involved. I wanted to ask 
you what’s your vision, what’s your hopes for the (Bruce Springsteen 
Archives and Center for American Music at Monmouth University) going 
forward. They’re based at Monmouth University and the exhibit is 
something that’s going to be a real shot for Freehold, you’re going to 
get people from all over the world …  <br>
A: That’s great.<br>
<br>
Q:  … coming to Freehold. What’s your vision for the archives and how 
it’ll engage the local community and the rest of the word, too, I guess?<br>
A: Yeah, I don’t exactly know at the moment. I know it’s been great to 
have a place where your stuff is so people who might be interested can 
go and have access to it. As far as what it will end up being, I hope it
 will be a creative space for young people and people in general who are
 interested in my music or American music in any way. It’s going to 
develop as it gets closer to being something that’s a reality. I look 
forward to being very involved in it and I think it’s just going to be a
 positive thing for the Shore community.<br>
<br>
Q: Do you plan on seeing the exhibit at the Historical Association? <br>
 A: Yeah, I’m looking to going to see it (Springsteen attended the 
opening event on Sept. 28). I have no idea about what’s been done, so 
I’m curious to see it.<br>
<br>
Q: It’s unbelievable. There’s a Springsteen in the Civil War, there’s a Springsteen in the Revolutionary War, it’s great!<br>
A; Right! It’s funny, someone sent me a family tree a couple of years 
ago, and I did find out that there had been a Springsteen in the 
Revolutionary and Civil wars.  I’m interested myself to see what they 
dug up.   <br>
                      <br>
Q: They have a guitar they say was played in the battalion that your Civil War ancestor served in.<br>
A: Really … I’m coming down!<br>
<br>
Q:  What caught my eye, and I was aware of this gentleman because I did a
 story on a young lady whose high school yearbook you signed, I saw a 
picture of Mr. (Robert) Hussey. I thought it was pretty cool that he 
seemed to make a connection to you.<br>
A: Yeah he did. It was English class and it was about writing and I 
think he recognized something in my writing at the time. Really, that’s 
all that you’re looking for when you’re that young – somebody who 
recognizes the spark in you somewhere. But my recollection of him is 
that he was just a good teacher and empathetic and someone I liked very 
much when I was in school.   <br>
<br>
Q: You do seem to be in town (Freehold) a little bit more lately?<br>
A: I don’t know, maybe all the writing about the past and things have 
brought me back a little bit and plus maybe we’ve just been home more. I
 get there pretty regularly you know, whether it’s Federici’s or Jersey 
Freeze, driving through or stopping and seeing a friend, I still come 
through pretty regularly.<br>
<br>
Q: My friends will kill me if I don’t ask you, still going forward with possibly an E Street Band tour?<br>
A: Yeah, sure. The way that works is pretty basic. I have some music, 
which I hope is good. But I don’t know ’til I hear it back (laughs). So I
 got to get the band together in the studio, which hopefully we’ll do 
before the year is out, and you start to make some music and we see what
 we have, and when we have something we look for places to play that 
music, and that’s how an E Street Band tour is put together (laughs). <br>
<br>
Q: Sounds like a deal.</div>

October 22</strong><br>
<br>
There’s your boss, and then there’s The Boss. But imagine if your boss and The Boss were one and the same.<br>
<br>
That’s the case for Thom Zimny, a long-time cinematic collaborator of 
Bruce Springsteen who has edited and directed numerous music videos and 
documentaries for the legendary rock star. Most recently, he won an Emmy
 for his work behind-the-camera on the Netflix special Springsteen on 
Broadway. But now Zimny is entering a new collaborative space with The 
Boss, taking on the role of co-director as Springsteen makes his 
directorial debut on Western Stars.<br>
<br>
The film is both a concert presentation of Springsteen’s 19th studio 
album of the same name filmed inside a 100-year-old barn on 
Springsteen’s property and a narrative fusion of autobiographical 
musings set against a blend of home movie footage and new sequences shot
 against the backdrop of the California desert. Like the best of 
Springsteen’s output, it’s a head-on collision of two different forces 
that smashes in your guts.<br>
<br>
For Zimny, the relationship is not so much Springsteen as boss, as it is
 Springsteen as artistic collaborator, even more so now that they’re 
sharing directorial duties. “The relationship I have with Bruce, and 
also my dialogue with [producer] Jon Landau, is that they expect me to 
step up and bring to the table the ideas that I have as a filmmaker,” 
Zimny tells EW. “It’s really not just serving the ideas of Bruce. It’s 
really bringing ideas to Bruce and collaborating with him in the space 
of, ‘How does this get the music across? Or how does it get the 
narrative across?'”<br>
<br>
Ultimately, that comes down to finding a middle ground between fan and 
filmmaker. “I’m really lucky because I’m a fan of Bruce’s music, and I 
get to work with him directly. There are two hats that I wear 
constantly. I love this music. If I feel that feeling inside the edit 
room, I know I’m doing my job as a filmmaker,” he reflects.<br>
<br>
Western Stars hits theaters Oct. 25, and it grants Springsteen’s fans an
 intimate view of the musician’s life and songwriting process, almost as
 if his annotated liner notes have come to glorious cinematic life. For 
more on the film, we called up Zimny to talk everything from the 
influence of classic Westerns to the joys of culling through 
Springsteen’s home movies.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY:</strong> Where did the
 idea to turn Western Stars into a film start?  Was it something you and
 Bruce were talking about already when doing the Broadway show? <br>
<br>
THOM ZIMNY: I got a call from Bruce right after the album was released 
that he wanted to film a concert of the full album Western Stars. He was
 not going to be touring with it, so he wanted to document the moment of
 performing this album with a 30-piece orchestra. That was the beginning
 of my conversations with him about making it into a movie. It was 
really important that we worked on making it different than Broadway. 
Right away we started discussing where could we place the audience, and 
how could we film this differently?That evolved to first looking at 
location. The barn, actually, is at Bruce’s house. So after we filmed 
the concert for two days with the 30-piece orchestra inside the barn, 
Bruce started to think about the idea of writing moments between the 
songs that would explain some of the themes of the album. The film then 
evolved to be something more than just a concert film.<br>
<br>
So then how did you land on the format of interlacing these monologues? 
Because it does feel like a natural next step from the Broadway show.<br>
One of the things of making the film with Bruce directly was a dialogue 
of “How can we step away from the experience of Broadway?” which was all
 contained on one stage. What happened in the cutting room was that we 
discovered that putting some of the imagery of the desert is really 
helpful in explaining the tone and visually conveying some of the 
feelings of the songs. We discovered in the process of cutting this 
hybrid of a genre — it wasn’t completely a concert film, it wasn’t a 
pure documentary. Also, it was something that was new for both of us and
 felt like it stepped away from Broadway, but also felt very close as a 
continuation of Bruce’s writing, very similar to the book or the 
Broadway show. It felt like the next natural next step in his dialogue 
with the audience.<br>
<br>
Alongside you, this is Springsteen’s feature film directorial debut, so 
can you break down that process a little bit? I mean, how does 
co-directing on this differ from something like the Broadway show or a 
music video?<br>
<br>
I’ve worked with Bruce for the past 20 years, and the difference between
 working on this film and other projects was the level of involvement he
 had with shaping and structuring the cut. The biggest thing was that he
 wrote a voiceover script that gave the film such a body and soul. It 
was an organic process that just happened in the cutting room. Starting 
off first with the concert, then filming these scenes with his 
voiceover, and then really, the building of it and cutting it together 
and then scoring it. He scripted, scored and co-directed this, which was
 really a different experience from all the other film work that we had 
done. One of the things that came about in working with Bruce was having
 the editing room right next to the studio, which was key. I was able to
 listen to the music that he was scoring and also share with him the 
edits as I was making it. So he was very, very much part of the process 
in the cutting room, and also, part of the color correct and the mixing.
 It was really a journey together in film.<br>
<br>
So you shot those western, desert sequences in Joshua Tree, yes? How did you land on that space specifically?<br>
<br>
We shot it in the desert area [around there]. The beauty of working with
 Bruce in that landscape was we both have a love and an interest in that
 cinematic landscape. He created a soundtrack with this album that fit 
perfectly with those emotional tones that the desert, the light and the 
color bring. His sonic palette matches the beauty of that desert and 
sky. It was great fun to work with him and my cinematographer, Joe 
DeSalvo, capturing Bruce in that environment. Which took you out of the 
barn and brought you into a little bit of a dream world of a character, 
while he reflected upon things that had happened in his life that 
influenced the songs and his writing and themes that he was exploring.<br>
<br>
The album references classic Hollywood Westerns so was there ever a 
discussion of filming somewhere more akin to that? Something more John 
Ford-esque like Monument Valley? What were the options on the table?<br>
<br>
The options on the table of what location to pick were What feels right?
 That location we ended up using was the album cover’s photography 
locations. It just held the beautiful balance of being very real, not 
feeling like a set, the wonderful landscape, wonderful sky and the 
character of this beautiful car. It just seemed fitting to return to the
 space where the album cover was shot and capture that landscape beyond 
stills.<br>
<br>
The older footage — the archival stuff and the home movie footage — 
where did that idea come from? And then how did you go about culling the
 pieces you would use?<br>
<br>
I was working with Bruce on a Saturday afternoon, and it was raining and
 it was completely quiet and we were working on the end sequence of 
“Moonlight Motel.” We were working on the section that discussed his 
relationship with [wife] Patti [Scialfa] in the past. He suggested to me
 that we take a look at a DVD, and [it] had this magical moment of home 
movie footage that showed not only their relationship, but showed the 
beauty of this moment of them early in their relationship. We put it 
into the cut, and it worked perfectly. You’re constantly preparing, 
you’re shooting, you’re capturing a concert in the barn, and you’re 
going through the desert, and at the same time, we’re both open to 
stumbling across a home movie that totally captures the moment. Who 
would’ve thought that a honeymoon home video would say exactly what the 
film needs at that point? But it works. Bruce is really exciting that 
way, by bringing these new challenges and surprises to the editing room.
 [It’s] my favorite part of the film where he’s literally just goofing 
around with a home video camera.<br>
<br>
It’s so intimate. He is always an intimate artist, but it’s a window into something we haven’t seen before.<br>
<br>
The beauty of looking in the archives is trying to find these moments 
that reveal a Bruce that a viewer might not have experienced before. 
With Western Stars, I went deep into the vault to find studio moments, 
to find moments of super 8 where he’s with his sister Pam early in [the]
 1970s — things that just have not been out there before. [We dug] deep 
into his home movies to give that feeling of stepping into this world 
where Bruce is talking about his life, his music, but also giving this 
view that you just haven’t seen.<br>
<br>
Was all of that footage from his personal collections and and things 
that were shot in relation to him and his life? Or were you also drawing
 from other archives?<br>
<br>
You know the beauty with working with Bruce’s music is it covers the 
world. It’s not a singular message from just a point of view of his life
 or New Jersey. So it was really important for me to find archival 
[footage] that represented the world that we live in…We poured over all 
kinds of home movies and poured over stills that just really tried to 
nail the thought behind the voice-over. It wasn’t just random B-roll 
ever.<br>
<br>
The album is very character-driven, and he’s talked about how he was 
really drawing on a lot of cinematic imagery in the song writing. Was 
there any discussion of trying to include footage from Westerns or some 
of those specific films that inspired him?<br>
<br>
There was no discussion of including clips from movies. But when you’re 
making a film with Bruce, and with Jon Landau around too, there’s always
 the discussion of references and movies. That’s a shorthand in the 
cutting room. We might not have ever talked about putting a film in the 
actual edit, but movies were discussed at all times.<br>
<br>
What were some of your primary reference points?<br>
<br>
We looked at the films of John Ford and the beauty of those landscapes. A
 lot of the classic Hollywood cinematography for Westerns in the ’50s 
and early ’60s and how they portrayed the land. And the use of light. We
 take references from all different decades. Jon Landau will turn to me 
at times and reference a silent film, so we’re not stuck in one genre. 
We’re not stuck in one era. It’s really a combination of all references.<br>
<br>
The score features a 30-piece orchestra that played live onstage with 
Bruce. Can you walk me through assembling that and deciding how you were
 going to shoot it?<br>
<br>
I really love this album — it felt like such a cinematic and sonic 
landscape for movies. Just putting it on the turntable, visually, I 
could sense so many things listening to the songs and the narrative in 
the record. When it came to shooting the orchestra, I knew that I wanted
 to stay in the dream of the music, make things happen within camera so 
we didn’t require a lot of edits. But also [to] give you a point of view
 that went beyond just the audience point of view and changed up the 
shot sizes. This is something I discussed at length with Bruce, which is
 bringing you behind him, but also never getting lost with seeing the 
cameras too much or audience members. We wanted to stay in the dream of 
the music, and being caught up in the lush sound of Western Stars.<br>
<br>
You said you filmed the performances in the barn over two days. Was it 
similar to the Broadway show where, as much as possible, you just tried 
to run straight through?<br>
<br>
Exactly. It was a filming that took place for two days, and we ran 
through as many songs as possible and then the second day we would do 
the same thing and cover the full narrative of the record. And Bruce 
pulled out the great surprise of “Rhinestone Cowboy.”<br>
<br>
Do you know why he chose that? Was it specifically the Jimmy Webb 
connection and his impact on the sound of the record or something else?<br>
<br>
I didn’t talk to [Bruce] directly. But I hear in “Rhinestone Cowboy” an 
amazing reference to the album Western Stars and its use of strings, but
 also that California pop sound. I can only assume that’s why he drew 
upon that song.<br>
<br>
Who was the janitor sweeping at the end? Because their sweeping was, let’s say, unusual. <br>
<br>
In the world of Bruce, he has friends for many, many years and he always
 brings people to the set. I always end up putting them into the movie. 
So every film I look forward to who Bruce is going to bring. This time 
he brought his good friend Ricky, who became the bartender and the guy 
who sweeps at the end. Every time I see the end credits or see Ricky in a
 shot, it reminds me of the beauty of the day we shot. But also Bruce 
has these relationships, in both his private and public life, where he 
brings them into the work.<br>
<br>
This feels like a major new step in Bruce’s career in that it feels like
 a definitively cinematic chapter, with the Broadway show going to 
Netflix, this release, and, indirectly, Blinded by the Light. Why do you
 think this is coming at this moment? Is it just a natural evolution? Is
 there something about the form that is better for his storytelling at 
this time?<br>
<br>
Bruce recently talked about this as being a trilogy. That this film was 
an extension of the book, an extension of the Broadway run. This type of
 writing gave him a chance to explore the themes of this new music in a 
unique way. In some ways, it all makes sense when you look at the book 
and Broadway and this film. He’s pushed it to the next level in the 
filmmaking process. I’ve seen this happen again and again from the music
 videos to the docs. We really start from a place of, “What’s the music 
telling us?” With this album, the music told us that we didn’t want to 
be on stage. The music told us that we needed an explanation from Bruce 
himself that wasn’t a documentary interview. That gave him the space to 
write, very much like he did in the book and the Broadway show, in this 
personal tone.<br>
<br>
Do you think, based on your experience with this process, that it is 
something he will want to keep doing and pushing forward? Whether that’s
 writing a new musical for Broadway or turning his book into a more 
narrative film, or anything along those lines?<br>
I don’t know. I wouldn’t be able to speak for Bruce. But working with 
him for the past 20 years, I’m always surprised with what he comes up 
with. I always look forward to the challenges that he throws at me. I 
don’t know what his role would be with the future in film, but I also 
know that I could have never predicted that Western Stars would have 
happened after Springsteen on Broadway.<br>
<br>
The film has a lot to say and is very introspective, but as a director, 
what do you hope is the number one message or theme that the audience 
takes away?<br>
<br>
I always hope that the viewer comes away with the feeling that they 
recognize the Bruce that they have in their collection at home and have 
grown up with and gone to the concerts with. But also, they recognize 
something new that Bruce shared with them. <em class="text-italics"> 
felt like the film honored both the sonic and the lyrical qualities of 
Bruce Springsteen’s music. My number one goal is to work with Bruce in a
 way that doesn’t detract from the beauty of his music. It’s a tricky 
balance. I always hope that I ended up in the space that enhances the 
experience of the album and also gives an understanding of the artist in
 a different way.</em></div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Warner Bros Pictures Chief Toby Emmerich’s Bromance With The Boss On Bruce Springsteen’s Directorial Debut ‘Western Stars’<br>
 <br>
By Mike Fleming Jr<br>
<br>
October 24, 2019 </strong><br>
<br>
On a rainy Wednesday last week at the Metrograph on Manhattan’s Lower 
East Side, Bruce Springsteen unveiled Western Stars to a small group of 
family and friends that ranged from bandmate Steven Van Zandt, Sopranos 
creator David Chase to CBS Records magnate Clive Davis, who signed The 
Boss. The film marks Springsteen’s debut as director alongside longtime 
collaborator Thom Zimny. Constructed around the live orchestra-backed 
performance of Springsteen’s latest album staged in a cavernous wooden 
hay silo/barn on The Boss’s ranch, the film’s power comes in what is an 
extension of the revelatory show he wrote and performed on Broadway, as 
Springsteen and Zimny lay in what The Boss called “the interior life of 
the songs.” Those moments of personal revelation are illustrated 
personal Springsteen family footage that includes Springsteen and wife 
Patti Scialfa in a cottage on their honeymoon that looks like your 
parents’ home movies.<br>
<br>
In this blockbuster-obsessed moment, Western Stars might not be 
considered worth the time of the exec running a major film studio. But 
for the second time, here was Warner Bros Pictures Group chairman Toby 
Emmerich introducing the film and presiding over its Q&amp;A. The first 
came at the film’s Toronto premiere, where Emmerich was present when 
more traditional studio releases, Joker and Just Mercy, made splashy 
premieres along with Western Stars.Springsteen described how the film – 
which Warner Bros releases this week through Fathom Events in over 300 
theaters – started with his desire to present hardcore fans an 
alternative to a live tour that would have been too cumbersome and 
impractical with that large an orchestra. He and Zimny transformed the 
film into something far more intimate as The Boss stares down his own 
mortality, along with the demons and depression and what they’ve done to
 his family and friends. Emmerich made the obligatory ask that 
Springsteen consider more theatrical scoring, and possibly more, but the
 Q&amp;A showed a studio exec well-tuned to an iconic artist’s canon, 
from the early rebellious anger to a fearful and depressed father and 
playing it safe that helped many young men with similar parental scars, 
to an emotionally evolved but imperfect man who has lived a full life 
and now faces reflection on the back nine. So what’s with Emmerich’s 
bromance with The Boss? <br>
<br>
DEADLINE: The moments between songs in Western Stars, convey a writer 
with profound understanding of emotions, human beings and the 
interactions between them that you can see Springsteen has a memorable 
movie in him if he chose to write and direct one. You’ve become a Boss 
buddy, but you run a major movie studio too. How hard have you pressed 
him?<br>
<br>
EMMERICH: I’ve never had that conversation with him, other than in a 
joking way. Whether he knew it when he started, or realized it looking 
back, the way he contextualizes this movie is…over five or ten years he 
published the autobiography, he wrote and performed the Broadway play, 
and then he wrote, performed and co-directed this film. He sees them as a
 trilogy, they are all part of him changing the conversation with his 
audience. He has had this very long conversation with a very loyal 
audience going back to the early 1970s when he used to tell long stories
 in between the songs, narratives about friends growing up, friends he 
lost in Vietnam, issues with his parents and his family, works of art 
that inspired him, novels and films. He would talk to the audience from 
the stage in between songs are very cinematic, like mini movies or short
 stories.<br>
<br>
 <br>
As he got educated over the years with John Ford movies, reading 
Flannery O’Connor…he didn’t graduate from college, but Jon Landau and 
others suggested things to him and he became a very literate 
self-educated guy and he has used a lot of that down time between albums
 and tours just reading and learning. He went through very intensive 
Freudian analysis he’s written about and talked about publicly. He’s an 
artist and a storyteller, and this trilogy is in some ways a summation 
and reflection on the conversation and journey he has had with that 
audience over the past 50 years. Jimmy Iovine told me that Bruce has 
found a way to make honesty radical and counterculture. So much of music
 and storytelling now is hype and posing and the internet. In this movie
 and the interstitial narrative voiceovers that he wrote and performs in
 the film, Bruce bares things that are incredibly raw and honest. I 
noticed that in the Broadway show, when he starts off by saying, I’ve 
never worked in a factory, I’ve never had a job that was five days a 
week before this show, and when I wrote Racing in the Streets, I had 
never driven a block. He has talked during that show about how we all 
wear masks. This completes a trilogy of him trying to take the mask off 
and show the emotional and human truth between what his music has been 
and what his art is.<br>
<br>
DEADLINE: Did you get involved when the film was completely finished?<br>
<br>
EMMERICH: Essentially. They invited me out to Bruce’s farm and we sat at
 his mixing board and watched a cut. There were minor changes. He 
basically made this whole movie, he financed it, he produced it with his
 team, he co-directed it. He made this in his own bubble.<br>
<br>
DEADLINE: How did Warner Bros get a shot at this?<br>
<br>
EMMERICH: I am a big fan and while I didn’t know him well I certainly 
knew his manager Jon Landau and Barbara Carr, a lot of people around him
 and Clive Davis, who signed him. We were dealing a lot with his 
management around the marketing and distribution plan for Blinded By The
 Light, for which he had granted his music rights. He met Gurinder 
Chadha, he read the book and the script, and was a fan. He made a 
special deal that made them able to license the music for that film. We,
 [New Line co-president] Carolyn Blackwood and her team bought that film
 at Sundance. And we started working with Bruce’s team on what stuff 
were they comfortable with us doing to promote the film. Barbara and his
 team got to know the Warner Bros team through that process and liked 
what they saw.<br>
As great as the deal was for him to bring Bruce Springsteen on Broadway 
to Netflix, I think he wanted this to be a theatrical movie. He didn’t 
want to make another deal with Netflix. He didn’t see it as a Netflix 
movie or HBO, which had been his home prior, when Richard Plepler had 
done all those docus that [Bruce] and Thom made, the documentaries on 
the anniversaries of Born To Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town and The 
River. He was looking for a theatrical release here, and there was one 
movie company where he was loosely in business, where his team was 
comfortable. So they said, do you want to see this movie? Absolutely. So
 I watched the whole movie. And Bruce was sitting there, maybe six 
inches away, to my left.<br>
<br>
DEADLINE: What’s that like?<br>
<br>
EMMERICH: Intimidating. I didn’t know he was going to stay for the 
screening. So one half of you is watching the movie. And the other half 
is going, I’m sitting next to Bruce Springsteen, watching this Bruce 
Springsteen movie. It was surreal. I knew it was a performance of the 
album Western Stars and that he decided not to tour behind the album and
 that his idea was to film a concert performance so he and the fans 
could feel what it would be like in a live experience. I knew there was 
going to be that. I had listened to the album a bunch already and I 
liked that it was a left turn. I have always liked when Bruce takes 
these left turns in what he calls his short story albums. Nebraska, The 
Ghost of Tom Joad, Devils &amp; Dust. They aren’t E Street Band albums, 
and he is writing characters that are different from his usual 
characters, more specific and particular and of a certain period. If you
 look at the movie Sean Penn directed, The Indian Runner, which is off a
 song called Highway Patrolman from Nebraska, you can see how that was 
adapted into a very contained film. I knew this was a short story 
record, and I liked those and the vibe and the musical references to 
Glen Campbell and Jimmy Webb, the people who inspired him and who he was
 cribbing from to make Western Stars.<br>
<br>
DEADLINE: That in itself makes a great album, but not necessarily a movie with strong commercial prospects…<br>
<br>
<br>
EMMERICH: What I didn’t expect and what blew me away was, I didn’t know 
it was going to be so revealing and emotional, much the way his 
autobiography and the Broadway play were. I figured he had scratched 
that itch; I didn’t know he had another one up his sleeve. In some ways,
 I find this one to be the most raw, honest and unfiltered. The things 
he talks about, are super private and personal and are admissions of 
profound shortcomings, mistakes and hard lessons learned.<br>
<br>
DEADLINE: You mean like when he talks about trying to hurt the ones he loves?<br>
<br>
EMMERICH: I found it profound when he said, if I loved you, I found a 
way to hurt you, and it was a sin, or where he talks about chasing wild 
horses. He goes there. He talks about carrying baggage and it gets 
heavier and heavier. He doesn’t romanticizes himself at all in this 
movie, as he did in the book and Broadway, which traced the rise up, the
 story of rags to riches and this kid dreaming and becoming this huge 
rock star. Here, he doesn’t talk about the rise to rock stardom, it’s 
his inner life, his inner struggle.<br>
<br>
DEADLINE: The movie’s visuals shot by Springsteen and Zimny, the desert 
and the skies, are as rich visually as is the music. Even the way 
Springsteen looks and sounds in voiceover at 70 years old gives him the 
aura of Sam Shepard, who also wore the miles very well.<br>
<br>
EMMERICH: My honor’s thesis at Wesleyan University was about Sam Shephard, Bruce Springsteen and Martin Scorsese.<br>
<br>
DEADLINE: What was the connective tissue there?<br>
 <br>
EMMERICH: Similar generation, children of the ‘50s and ‘60s, who came of
 age creatively in the ‘70s with the baggage of that time, the Vietnam 
War, the broken promise of the ‘60s. That long after-burn of post Nixon 
and Vietnam, the assassination of King and the Kennedys. That generation
 of American storytellers has a conflicted relationship between what it 
means to be American. There is a great pride, but also a shame in being 
American, this paradoxical embrace and rejection of American frontier 
mythology. It’s this land of civilization with this great wilderness 
that’s unexplored. When we head West and push against that boundary to 
undiscovered land the central American myth is that we find redemption, 
reinvention, renewal. But as a professor of mine has written, it is 
regeneration through violence. A lot of American storytelling is what 
happens when a situation can’t be resolved. This is most clearly 
delineated in the Western and something Bruce talks about in this film, 
with The Searchers being his favorite movie. And all these references to
 gunfighters and cowboys you see throughout a lot of Sam Shepard and 
Springsteen. And with Marty, it is transposed to the gangster, but it’s 
all men of violence. That is a central American iconic protagonist. I 
wrote that that in ’83 when Reagan misinterpreted Springsteen’s Born In 
The USA song, but with all three guys it was about the love hate 
relationship of what it meant to be American, and how we love and buy 
into the myth of the American frontier. But also realizing how 
disgraceful it was. Because what was the American frontier really about?
 It was about the genocide of the indigenous Americans.<br>
<br>
DEADLINE: So what grade did you get on that paper?<br>
<br>
EMMERICH: I recall I got a good grade, but don’t remember. What was fun 
about it, I got to spend a lot of time with Sam, Marty and Bruce and I 
love all three of them. Their storytelling meant a lot to me as a young 
man studying and maybe wanting to be a storyteller. As an older man, 
walking a different path, it still means a lot to me.<br>
<br>
DEADLINE: Beyond a personal connection to his work, what makes 
Springsteen’s Western Stars a success for Warner Bros, where the 
priority is profit in narrative films, and not concert film 
documentaries?<br>
<br>
<br>
EMMERICH: Bruce fully financed it and made it super economically. Nobody
 was involved but him and his team. It’s a true independent film that is
 being released by a major studio. The high water mark and a similar 
strategy we are using is one we did on Peter Jackson’s They Shall Not 
Grow Old. That one was a home run that exceeded our highest 
expectations.<br>
<br>
DEADLINE: It grossed over $20 million worldwide.<br>
<br>
EMMERICH: If that film was the sky high dream, a win here would be a decent percentage of that.<br>
 Warner Bros<br>
<br>
DEADLINE: In your interview with him before the tastemaker crowd at the 
Metrograph, Springsteen leaned into an interpretation of The Searchers 
and what he didn’t want his life to turn into. He mentioned the ending, 
and how the family goes into the house with the kidnapped niece who had 
assimilated with the Commanches. And how John Wayne rescued her and 
reunited his family, but could not himself go into the house. 
Springsteen said he didn’t want to be that guy. On what other films did 
you connect?<br>
<br>
EMMERICH: By the way, that character in The Searchers is very iconic. 
There’s an academic term for him, the guy who lives in the amorphous 
terrain on the border between civilization and wilderness. He’s not at 
home with family, but he doesn’t really live with the quote unquote 
savages. If you watch the end of Shane, well Shane walks off, too. If 
you go back and watch the Westerns, you’d be amazed how often you see 
that gunfighter, the Clint Eastwood guy, the one who comes into town 
willing to do what the others won’t, which is, kill the bad guys, and 
when the killing is done, there is no place for that guy in polite 
society, so he has to leave. It’s axiomatic to the gunfighter canon.<br>
<br>
DEADLINE: But as Springsteen relates in Western Stars and your interview, it’s no way for a man to live.<br>
<br>
EMMERICH: Exactly, and if you fall in love with the myth or the legend 
and try to live like that, it’s not real. We get fooled by that and as 
kids growing up, you think that’s romantic. I can be alone. You listen 
to those songs on the album, he talks about how you get too used to 
being lonely, you become trapped in it. That’s what happened to him 
where he was just really comfortable being alone, which is a dangerous 
thing. As for other movies, he’s a movie junkie so a better question is 
what hasn’t he watched. He’s a huge Coppola fan; I was with them 
together one night and he’s seen all those movies, and they were talking
 about The Rain People, that early Coppola movie that Robert Duvall was 
in. He’s clearly fluent in cinema.<br>
<br>
DEADLINE: So does Springsteen have a narrative film in him? He shows in 
this film more enlightened about emotion and human interaction than we 
see in a lot of scripts turned into films. Of course, he’d have to fire 
his agent as a writer because of the Guild standoff, though not if he 
was directing…<br>
 Warner Bros<br>
<br>
EMMERICH: I think I have zero ability to influence whether he’s going to
 do that or not. I think he knows if he wanted to, Warner Bros would be 
the first in line with a checkbook and an open door. He knows that. But 
he’s a man who, as much as anyone I’ve come across in this life, takes 
his own counsel.<br>
<br>
DEADLINE: When you invited him onstage to do more film scoring, he 
parried with the observation that he’ll save his creative ideas going 
forward and use them as ways to get his E Street Band back on the road 
as fast as possible.<br>
<br>
EMMERICH: I think he’s planning to record a rock and roll record with E 
Street and then tour behind it. My sense is that’s next on his agenda. 
What comes after that? Your guess is as good as mine.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Me and My Motor interview: Bruce Springsteen’s life in cars<br>
“My style behind the wheel was considered inept and reckless by the band”<br>
<br>
London Sunday Times<br>
October 27, 2019<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
After four decades of rockin’ and rollin’ and the sale of 135m albums, 
Bruce Springsteen could afford a fleet of limousines, yet his car 
collection is as modest as the man and as blue-collar as his music.<br>
<br>
Stashed away in outbuildings on his 300-acre farm in New Jersey are “a 
few American cars from back in the day”. By that, he means some 
beautiful American classics from the 1960s and ’70s — plus some 
motorcycles, including British machines. He tinkers when he gets the 
chance and uses them as often as he can.<br>
<br>
“I have a garage full of cars that I’ve collected over the years,” he 
says. “They’re not collector’s pieces; they’re what I call drivers. I 
have my original Corvette. I’ve got a ’69 Chevy. I’ve got a Cadillac. 
I’ve got an old pick-up truck. I’ve got a small collection of older 
American vehicles that I get in and drive once in a while.”<br>
<br>
Most of the cars have a story to tell. The 1960 Corvette is on the cover
 of his autobiography Born to Run. The ’69 Chevy features in one of his 
best-loved songs, Racing in the Street. In classic Springsteen style, 
it’s about a man trying to escape from his problems and his mundane life
 by racing cars at night.<br>
<br>
The singer is also an aficionado of two-wheeled machines, a passion he 
revived later in life. He’d stopped riding in his teens after being 
concussed in an accident, when a ’63 Cadillac T-boned his small Yamaha 
in 1967.<br>
<br>
“I started riding again in my thirties,” he says. “So for the past 30 
years I’ve put together a small collection of bikes in my garage. I have
 one vintage Triumph Trophy and a Thunderbird from ’94. I’ve got a more 
modern Triumph, a kind of a souped-up Bonneville. And I’ve got a new 
Norton 961 Commando. Then I have my old Harleys.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen also keeps some modern 4x4s for getting around his property.
 “Just for daily drivers we have Jeeps — Cherokees — and a Range Rover,”
 he says.<br>
<br>
Since his 1973 debut album — Greetings from Asbury Park, NJ — cars have 
helped to power his lyrics, often as a metaphor for escaping smalltown 
America.<br>
<br>
“[Cars] continue to be, for me, resonant and romantic and I think the 
idea of a journey is always compelling to people,” he says today. “The 
image of driving is just very evocative for people. It’s a geography 
that I like to say all people carry inside them. Those images are images
 that people have internalised through films and travel over the years.”<br>
In Western Stars, a feature-film companion piece to his recently 
released album of the same name, Springsteen says: “We still live a lot 
of our lives, here in America, in cars, just trying to get from one 
place to another. I suppose 40 years ago they were a potent metaphor for
 open roads and freedom. Over the rise, around the bend, into the 
future. And to settle the spirit sometimes.”<br>
<br>
The film shows Springsteen in concert, not in his usual stadium setting 
but in an old barn on his ranch. Between songs we see clips of Super 8 
footage of a younger Springsteen, and sequences of him against a 
backdrop of big skies and wild horses. He provides the voiceover, 
summoning up homespun philosophy about life and love, struggle and 
reward. Some of the homilies are delivered from the driving seat of an 
antique Chevrolet El Camino as he travels through a parched landscape in
 Joshua Tree national park.<br>
Given that his music is so deeply rooted in car culture, it’s all the 
more surprising that he wrote those early songs when he didn’t have a 
licence and barely knew how to drive. Springsteen, 70, jokes he was 
something of a fraud in those days, composing lyrics about cars when he 
didn’t own one and singing about factory work when he’d never done a 
day’s manual labour.<br>
<br>
His first experience behind the wheel was so hair-raising that it’s 
surprising it didn’t kill off his affection for automobiles — not to 
mention Springsteen himself. He took turns driving a friend’s truck on a
 three-day journey from New Jersey to Big Sur in California. He and his 
bandmates had been booked for a gig and couldn’t afford to turn it down,
 even though it was 3,000 miles away. The ancient wagon had a 
dilapidated gearbox. He recalls in his 2016 autobiography: “I just drove
 — no licence, no permit, no experience. The truck was an old manual 
shift. You had to clutch, shift, clutch, shift, the engine begging for 
mercy.”<br>
<br>
He still couldn’t drive when he toured with the E Street Band in 1973 to
 promote Greetings. “Everyone but myself took turns driving. I still had
 no licence and my style behind the wheel was considered inept and 
reckless endangerment by the band.”<br>
<br>
Even when, in 1974, he wrote Born to Run, the album that shot him to 
international stardom, he still owned no car. He bought his first the 
following year, aged 26, for $2,000. It was a 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air 
convertible, with flame detailing on the bonnet and a “Hurst on the 
floor” (echoing the lyric in Racing in the Street about that kind of 
gearlever).<br>
<br>
As album sales took off, he could finally afford the set of wheels he’d 
always wanted, buying it in New Jersey from a worker at an ice cream 
stand. “Born to Run had earned me a Steinway baby grand piano and a 1960
 Chevrolet Corvette I bought for six grand from a kid behind the 
counter,” he recalls.<br>
<br>
He was delighted when, as a thank-you gift for writing Gary “US” Bonds’s
 comeback hit song This Little Girl, Bonds bought him a classic 1963 
Chevrolet Impala convertible, another American land yacht.<br>
<br>
So in love was he with Americana — and cautious with money — that for 
years he wasn’t interested in buying a new car. He records in his 
memoirs: “I’d never owned a new car in my life. For that matter, I’d 
never spent $10,000 on myself. Still I bit the bullet, rode down to the 
dealer and drove away in a 1982 Chevy Z28 Camaro. I felt as conspicuous 
as if I were driving a solid gold Rolls-Royce.”<br>
<br>
Even after he’d bought it, he still hankered after the old classics: 
American barges, redolent of long, straight roads stretching across the 
desert towards the horizon. When he acquired a house in the Hollywood 
Hills, he needed a car to cross the continent, so he bought “for a few 
grand” a 1969 Ford XL “with a white ragtop, sea green and Cadillac 
long”. It was the perfect road trip car with Jack Kerouac On the Road 
cool, Springsteen recalls.<br>
<br>
Only when he started a family with Patti Scialfa, a singer with the E 
Street Band, did he succumb to a more practical form of transport — a 
minivan — for transporting his children, Evan, Jessica and Sam. Indeed, 
he would often ferry them and their friends to sports matches, along 
with their kit, sometimes to the surprise of other parents, who would do
 a double take when they saw a rock star acting as taxi driver and 
roadie.<br>
<br>
Cars feature in the lyrics of his latest album, his 19th, although 
Springsteen admits that these days they have lost some of their power as
 a symbol of freedom and escape.<br>
<br>
“At best, they are a metaphor for movement,” he says in the film. “When 
we’re in a car we can feel like we’re always moving forward. But are we 
moving forward? A lot of the time, we’re just moving.”</div>

By KYLE SMITH<br>
The National review<br>
December 27, 2019 6:30 AM<br>
<br>
The Bard of authenticity salutes cheesy Seventies style.</strong><br>
<br>
In 1975, I was nine. Glen Campbell’s “Rhinestone Cowboy” was the first 
song I was ever obsessed with, the first 45-rpm single I ever bought. 
The price of a song then was 100 percent of my weekly income, which was 
one dollar. Costly, but worth it. As “Rhinestone Cowboy” was making its 
way to No. 1, which it reached on September 6, 1975, another single was 
sputtering on the charts. Released on August 25, Bruce Springsteen’s 
“Born to Run” didn’t do so well. It peaked at number 23. Victory for 
Glen Campbell.<br>
<br>
“Rhinestone Cowboy” sounds very much like 1975, and “Born to Run” 
doesn’t; it’s difficult to place. It doesn’t sound like the Sixties, 
Eighties, or Nineties either. It’s beyond the constraints of time. 
That’s one reason it’s an enduring classic, it still gets played on the 
radio, and is always a highlight of Springsteen’s fabled concerts. 
Springsteen looked beyond the moment and created timeless art. In the 
documentary on the making of Born to Run the album, there’s a priceless 
scene in which Springsteen is listening to one of the early mixes of 
“Born to Run,” and just for a few seconds it sounds like the Seventies. 
Springsteen winces. We’re all glad he cut out that interlude and made 
something that didn’t get stuck in 1975.<br>
<br>
Born to Run turned out to be one of the greatest rock albums ever made, a
 deathless slate of eight spellbinding, essential songs. Rock radio 
stations have been playing all eight for decades. Springsteen is an 
emperor of the stage who sells out stadiums and caused a frenzy when he 
took up residency in a Broadway theater for a year; Campbell, when he 
died a couple of years back, was semi-forgotten. His image forever 
adhered to the unfortunate tastes of the American masses in the Nixon 
era, when his hokey, meretricious, down-home cornball variety show The 
Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour was a top-20 television hit.<br>
<br>
And yet here is Springsteen covering “Rhinestone Cowboy” in the closing 
credits of his new documentary Western Stars, which he made to promote 
the album of the same name. Bruce hardly every sings others’ songs (it’s
 the only cover in the movie). He doesn’t sing this one with a smirk or a
 wink. Why did he choose this one to wrap up the movie? I think it’s a 
sly confession. Glen Campbell and Bruce Springsteen are not so far apart
 as they appear.<br>
<br>
One of these two men lived a reckless rock-and-roll life as though he 
expected never to see 40. The other was a relative Romney. As a British 
tabloid once put it, with delightful concision: “Glen Campbell’s dark 
side: Cocaine binges, booze addiction, three failed marriages and eating
 squirrel to stay alive.” Campbell had eight children with four women, 
one of whom he married when she was 15 (and pregnant by Campbell, who 
was 17). That’s straight out of “The River.” Campbell was more of a 
Springsteen character than Springsteen.<br>
<br>
At the time of “Rhinestone Cowboy” Campbell was a cocaine fiend. He was 
freebasing, too. Sometimes he would snort the white stuff while he had 
the Bible open on his table. In the Eighties, his relationship with 
Tanya Tucker was chaos; during his affair with her he busted up his room
 at the Plaza Hotel in New York and did $1,200 worth of damage. Tucker 
said he hit her so hard he knocked out two of her front teeth. In 1981, 
after a dispute on an airplane, he told an Indonesian gentleman, “I’m 
going to call my friend Ronald Reagan and bomb Jakarta.” Campbell became
 a born-again Christian and said he kicked the bad habits, but they 
kicked back. As late as 2003, he earned himself ten days in prison after
 being busted for drinking and driving in Phoenix. When asked his name, 
he said, “Glen Campbell, the Rhinestone Cowboy.” He insisted he wasn’t 
drunk but had merely been “over-served” via a Coke he did not know also 
contained rum. He tried to knee a cop in the thigh.<br>
<br>
Campbell’s songs (which he didn’t write) were not about desperation and 
woe, but his life was. For Springsteen it was the reverse; the darkness 
in his songs is strictly make-believe. This would have been obvious to 
anyone paying attention, but should you doubt it, I refer you to 
Springsteen on Broadway, in which Springsteen admits he made it all up, 
using the following words: “I made it all up.” He went to the movies and
 borrowed from features such as Thunder Road (1958) and Badlands (1973).
 In 1987, his album Tunnel of Love reflected frankly on his (brief, 
unwise) first marriage, to Julianne Phillips, and in his 1992 song 
“Better Days” he drops a reference to being “a rich man in a poor man’s 
shirt,” but for the most part what Springsteen has been doing his whole 
career is speak through fictional characters — gangsters and losers and 
Tom Joad. He never raced cars. He was never a street punk. He never saw 
the inside of a factory. “Standing before you is a man who has become 
wildly and absurdly successful writing about something about which he 
has had absolutely no personal experience,” he said in the Broadway 
show. How could it be otherwise? He’s been a rich man since his early 
twenties. He lives on a 380-acre estate in New Jersey, when he isn’t at 
his $60 million property in Benedict Canyon. His daughter is an 
equestrian. If Springsteen were being frank, “The River” would be about a
 Mississippi of money.<br>
<br>
No one should feel cheated, though. Springsteen is a creative artist, 
and he spent most of his career carefully refining his greatest 
creation: “Bruce Springsteen.” Seemingly an introspective, confessional 
writer, Springsteen was in reality more akin to a novelist or an actor. 
In the film Western Stars he talks about creating his “character” for 
the album — a faded cowboy actor who makes a living doing Haggar 
commercials and performing in rodeos. There’s been a load of 
compromisin’ on the road to his horizon.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s take on “Rhinestone Cowboy” brings it all back home: It’s a
 confession by a phony, a poser, a guy in sparkly fake gems who, far 
from working the rodeos, instead walks “the dirty sidewalks of 
Broadway.” Its author is neither a Westerner nor a cowboy, nor even 
cowboy-adjacent: Larry Weiss is a Jewish guy who grew up in Queens. Glen
 Campbell, the Arkansas country boy who grew up eating varmints, reached
 his zenith channeling the words of a New Yorker who wrote of yearning 
to make it big as a fake buckaroo. Everyone trying to make it in showbiz
 has an act; Springsteen is happy to admit that for many years 
authenticity was his act. His signature character may have been the 
turnpike desperado, but he is the Garden State version of the Rhinestone
 Cowboy.</div>

Confessions Of A Springsteen Fanatic<br>
By Steve Pond<br>
<br>
I remember when it started: May 31, 1974, the day I first heard Bruce 
Springsteen.  But I don’t remember precisely when I lost control.  Maybe
 it was the following spring, when I left a party at midnight and drove 
across town to get my Springsteen records because nobody would believe 
me about him.<br>
	Maybe it was August 1975, when I went to the record stores every day 
for a month because I heard Bruce’s “Born To Run” album was about to 
come out and I had to have it the day it hit the stores.<br>
	Maybe it was 1976, when I spent the night on the sidewalk in front of 
the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium waiting for tickets to go on sale; or 
1978, when I flew to San Francisco to see a single Springsteen show.<br>
	Maybe it was 1980, when I went to San Francisco for two shows, drove 
all night to get back home immediately after the second show, saw four 
consecutive shows in Los Angeles – and then, already having seen six 
shows in two weeks, got behind the wheel and drove 600 miles to Phoenix 
to see him one more time.<br>
	Or maybe it was 1984 and ’85, when I saw 18 shows: all 11 shows he did 
in Los Angeles, all four in Oakland and the first three of the tour in 
Minnesota.  To get to those, I arranged a business trip to the East 
Coast so that I’d be heading west at the time Bruce was beginning his 
tour, and then convinced a newspaper to pick up the extra expenses in 
exchange for an opening-night review.<br>
	Whenever it happened, I’m a Springsteen fanatic.  I’m writing this the 
morning after my 42nd Bruce show, the last performance of his 15-month, 
worldwide “Born In The USA” tour.  I’m exhausted, my ears are still 
ringing, and my wife just called in sick because rearranging her life 
for late-night, open-air concerts has taken its toll.  But if Bruce 
Springsteen decided to do another show tonight in, say, San Diego, I’d 
hop in the car and hit the road.<br>
--<br>
	It’s a rough life.  When tickets go on sale, I wait in line overnight 
to buy them, just in case my music industry contacts don’t work out.  I 
buy his records as soon as they come out, even though I’ll be getting 
copies in the mail.  I buy import copies of his singles because the 
lettering on the sleeve is a different color or the photos are 
different.<br>
	Once a year, I throw a mock birthday party for Springsteen.  I take 
everything off the walls and put up four dozen Bruce posters and photos;
 I turn on my Springsteen neon sign; I stick my 35 backstage passes to 
the kitchen walls; and I play Bruce videos and Bruce records and Bruce 
tapes.  Then I watch people who’ve never been over before nervously 
mutter “Nice place” when they clearly think I’m a wacko who lives in a 
perpetual Springsteen shrine.<br>
	I have one friend who has her own Springsteen birthday party.  I have 
other friends I’d never have met without a mutual interest in Bruce.  
And if my wife hadn’t liked Springsteen…well, sometimes I wonder.<br>
	In the middle of Springsteen’s seven consecutive LA shows last fall, I 
got a call from writer Mikal Gilmore, who’d been convinced partly by my 
enthusiasm to try the seeing-Bruce-every-night regimen.  “I woke up this
 afternoon and realized I only had a few hours before I had to be down 
at the Sports Arena again” Mikal groaned.  “I thought, ‘My God, I’ve got
 the Steve Pond Disease!’ “<br>
	Mikal still goes to every Springsteen show.  This year he also went to 
the Washington and Oakland shows.  He doesn’t call it the Steve Pond 
Disease anymore.  He’s hooked, and we get along very nicely.<br>
--<br>
	Bruce Springsteen makes great rock’n’roll records and he’s been a heck 
of a nice guy the handful of times we’ve talked.  But is that any reason
 to drop everything whenever his tour enters the Pacific time zone?<br>
	I don’t know.  It’s not like Bruce saved my life or kept me from going 
crazy or anything like that.  Sure, he restored my passion for 
rock’n’roll at a time when it was hard to sustain and in that way was 
probably responsible for the start of my writing career.  But that was 
when I was still in my teens.  Now I’m 30, and it’s getting harder to 
explain why a passion for one rock-and-roller can reorder my life at 
regular intervals.<br>
	I know that when I first put on a Springsteen record – which I bought 
for myself on my birthday in 1974, because I’d heard good things about 
the guy and figured it was worth a shot – the wildly romantic menagerie 
of characters and the unrestrained wash of musical influences left me 
open-mouthed by the middle of the second song.  I know that when I first
 saw him two months later, even at that early stage, he was the greatest
 live performer I’d ever seen.<br>
	And I know that I’m still as impressed, though the freewheeling 
romantic of those early records has grown into a writer more focused, 
realistic and sober-minded, and a showman who has by now perfected the 
rock concert.<br>
	But that’s not why I act like such a maniac.  For that, you’ll have to 
start with the standard reasons: Because every night is different.  
Because you never know what he’s going to do.  Because in a single 
Springsteen show is a range as all-encompassing as the work of half a 
dozen other artists, from monumental silliness to heart-breaking 
compassion to raging determination.  Because on any given night when 
Springsteen is playing, there is nothing I would rather do.  And because
 Bruce has never done a show that’s made me think that attitude was a 
mistake.<br>
	(In case my last shreds of critical credibility haven’t all flown out 
the window, I ought to add that this doesn’t mean I love every show the 
guy does: Lately I think his second set has been too short and the 
concerts were a little too pat and he should’ve done “Backstreets” or 
“Point Blank” or “Racing In The Street” occasionally, and it worries me 
when I can lip-synch his raps as well as his songs…But then, I do the 
same thing every night he’s in town; why shouldn’t he?  Besides, the 
show I saw last night was completely wonderful and I’m not in a critical
 mood.)<br>
	On a Springsteen tour, every night’s song list is different – but 
what’s more important is that seeing a string of shows gives you a 
ringside seat at a process that’s unique in rock and roll.  Night to 
night, you can see changes made, limits tested, experiments tried and 
adopted or discarded, themes explored.<br>
	It came into focus last year when he did seven shows at the LA Sports 
Arena.  Midway through the engagement he decided to drop “Rosalita,” the
 raucous rocker that had been his closing number for a decade.  Instead 
of substituting another rave-up song, he chose “Racing In The Street,” a
 chilling ballad about lost opportunities.  Every night, the song got 
better; every night, he rearranged both the set and the song and 
darkened the complexion of what was once a flat-out party-time set.  He 
started talking over the song’s instrumental introduction, slipping into
 the character of a weary hot rodder whose wife hides the keys to keep 
him from heading down to the drag.<br>
	“It got hard to make her understand,” he’d say softly, “that when I 
took the car out, and when I won, it was the only time I got to feelin’ 
good about myself.”  The lines could as easily apply to a kid with a 
guitar.  “And that to have just one thing in your whole life that makes 
you proud of yourself – that’s not too much for anybody to ask.  Not too
 much at all.”  Then he’d ease into the song, stretching out its ending 
until you thought the slow, mournful music said all there was to say - 
and then capping his tale of one last shot at redemption with a whisper:
 “That was the night that we left.  We still don’t know where we’re 
going, but I guess that’ll come in time.  As for this place, we’ll 
always remember it.”  Then, with the crowd quietly expecting 
“Rosalita,”, he’d walk offstage.<br>
	Every night, it was worth the trip downtown and the $15 tickets just to see what he’d do with that song.<br>
--<br>
	There are plenty of others like me out there, and a good many of them 
make my fanaticism look mild.  Springsteen maniacs surround you, and 
unless you know the warning signs we’re a deceptive lot.  We don’t wear 
Bruce T-shirts to work.  We can carry on adult conversations about 
politics or books or movies or the weather.  If someone says, “Nice 
day,” we don’t automatically retort, “Yeah, like when I saw Bruce at the
 Roxy in ’75.”<br>
	But when Bruce gets ready to put out a record, we start acting antsy.  
When tickets go on sale we’re on the phone a lot, exchanging details 
about the least-trafficked ticket outlets and planning our strategies.  
When Bruce comes to town we’re exhausted the morning after every show.<br>
	And we can also be possessive, especially now that Bruce is the 
favorite of people whose older brothers and sisters never believed us 
when 10 years ago we sang the praises of “The Wild, the Innocent and the
 E Street Shuffle.”  On a recent Op-Ed page of the Los Angeles Times, 
for example, writer Bob Baker spoke for lots of longtime Springsteen 
fans: “Thousands of you people jamming those concerts discovered 
Springsteen sometime last week,” he snapped, “and have proclaimed 
yourself rock-ribbed fans.  You’re not…Are you listening, Miss Woodland 
Hills High School Sophomore With the Daddy’s-Money-Fourth-Row Tickets, 
who thinks ‘Jungleland’ is a Disneyland ride?...You think ‘Kitty’s Back 
in Town’ is a song from ‘Cats’.”<br>
	The guy’s got a point, but he blew it.  The name of the song isn’t “Kitty’s Back in Town.”  It’s “Kitty’s Back.”<br>
	See, we’re a demanding lot, and we find it hard to share Bruce 
Springsteen when he’s changed from our private secret to some sort of 
national icon.  It’s hard to share him with the teen-age girls in front 
of me Monday, who danced themselves silly during “I’m Goin’ Down” and 
“Glory Days” but sat during “Thunder Road.”  It’s hard to share him with
 the guy next to me last Sunday who yelled “Yo, dude!” every time Bruce 
started talking.  It’s hard to share him with the pickup truck full of 
rowdies who barreled past me last weekend blaring “Dancing in the Dark” 
and shouting “SPRINGSTEEEEEEN!” (Don’t they know the appropriate yell is
 “BROOOOCE!”?<br>
	But elitism like this is dumb.  Bruce Springsteen has welcomed his 
other fans and so should we.  He’s marvelously reassuring and convenient
  as a private obsession – an easy way to prove to yourself you’ve got 
good taste – but he’s far more important as a national treasure.  Sure, 
some fans misinterpret “Born in the USA” and come to the shows to hear 
the singles from the latest album, but they’d have to be pretty dense 
not to come away with more than that.  And even if that’s all they get, 
it’s still the best party in town, and who am I to deny anybody an 
invitation when Bruce Springsteen’s given them one?<br>
	So I go to all the shows, not with the stunned euphoria that hits most 
people the first time they see him, but with an eye for the changes, the
 tunes that hit home each particular night, the special moments.  After 
11 years, 42 concerts and untold people questioning my sanity, I’ve got 
plenty of those moments to treasure.<br>
--<br>
	I remember the first time, when a 24-year-old in a white tank top and 
gray slacks came onstage in front of a handful of people who’d come to 
the Santa Monica Civic to see Dr. John (and some of us who’d come for 
“Bruce Springstein,” as some ads put it).  His 40-minute show opened the
 eyes of everyone in the place; when it was over and he simply had to do
 an encore, he pulled out a 20-minute version of his meandering, 
atmospheric ballad “New York City Serenade.”<br>
	I remember seeing him two weeks after his 1975 Time and Newsweek cover 
stories in the gym of a university two hours north of LA, hitting his 
stride with a show far more explosive than the heralded ones he’d done 
in town.  After two encores the crowd simply refused to leave; Bruce 
came out alone, sat down at the piano and turned “For You” from an 
up-tempo rock song into a surpassingly poignant ballad.<br>
	I remember spending the night on the sidewalk in front of the Roxy in 
1978 because Springsteen, who’d just played the 18,000-seat Forum, 
wanted to do a smaller show.  That show ended with Bruce and his band 
dragged out of the showers because, once again, nobody would go home.  
He did “Twist and Shout” and I nearly fell off my chair.<br>
	I remember driving from LA to Phoenix in 1980, good-naturedly 
complaining to a CBS staffer about my seats and ending up with the 
front-row center seats Springsteen saves for every performance.  The day
 before, Ronald Reagan had been elected president; that night, 
Springsteen stopped near the end of the first set and said, “I don’t 
know what you guys think about what happened last night, but I think 
it’s pretty frightening.”  Then he tore into “Badlands” – his rock-hard 
tale of grim determination to survive – with a fury almost too much for 
even that masterful song to contain.<br>
	I remember a week ago, when in front of 85,000 fans at the LA Coliseum 
he told “the young people” in the audience that “blind faith in your 
leaders, in 1985, will get you killed.”  Then he blasted into Edwin 
Starr’s antiwar song “War” (“War! What is it good for? Absolutely 
nuthin’!”), in one of his most surprising and exhilarating covers ever.<br>
	And I remember the last night of his 1985 tour.  He told the crowd it 
had been the best year of his life, asked us not to let him down and 
finished with a giddy version of, appropriately enough, “Glory Days.”  A
 few songs earlier, though, he’d given the crowd one of the sweetest 
benedictions imaginable with a soaring version of his “Bobby Jean.”  The
 song ends with the image of a traveler hearing Bruce’s song while out 
on the road: “If you do, you’ll know I’m thinking of you and all the 
miles in between/And I’m just calling one last time, not to change your 
mind/But just to say I miss you baby/Good luck, goodbye, Booby Jean.”<br>
	There have been lots of other moments: songs that hit their peak one 
night, sets that made me wonder if rock and roll could ever get any 
better, nights that fulfilled every promise the music ever made.  And as
 someone who, for better or worse, has gotten some of his greatest joys 
and most profound emotional experiences through popular music, I can say
 that every time I’ve listened to Bruce he’s shown me that my enthusiasm
 isn’t misplaced.<br>
	“Enthusiasm,” I guess, is the key word.  It may be a little late for 
this kind of disclaimer, but I’m writing about enthusiasm – ridiculous, 
over-the-edge, wide-eyed enthusiasm – rather than hero worship.  I had a
 great time during the last Springsteen tour, but I’m not going into 
mourning now that it’s over.  After all, blind faith in your rockers 
isn’t a very good idea, either.<br>
	Springsteen himself says it every night during “Thunder Road.”  “I 
ain’t no hero, that’s understood,” he sings, “And all the redemption I 
can offer is beneath this dirty hood.”<br>
	Hey, Bruce, I understand.  But thanks for some of that redemption, and I’ll see you next time around.</div>
