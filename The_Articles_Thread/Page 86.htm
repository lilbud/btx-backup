Bruce Springsteen’s Playlist for the Trump Era<br>
“I don’t know if our democracy could stand another four years of his custodianship.”<br>
6:45 AM ET<br>
David Brooks<br>
<br>
Contributing writer at The Atlantic and columnist for The New York Times</strong><br>
<br>
This is a moment of tumult, anger, hope, and social change. At moments 
such as this, songwriters and musicians have a power to name things and 
help us make sense of events—artists such as Kendrick Lamar, Janelle 
Monáe, Tom Morello, Nina Simone, Marvin Gaye, Bob Dylan, and Bruce 
Springsteen.<br>
<br>
It’s been 20 years since Springsteen wrote “American Skin (41 Shots),” a
 powerful song about the police killing of a black man. I thought it 
might be a good idea to check in with Bruce, to get his reflections on 
this moment and on music in this moment. Here’s a slightly edited 
transcript of our conversation, which took place on June 9. (Bruce’s 
full playlist is available on Spotify.)<br>
<br>
<br>
David Brooks: We’ve got people marching in the streets. We’ve got great 
tumult. What do you see? Are you optimistic or pessimistic about what’s 
going on out there?<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen: I don’t think anybody truly knows where we’re going 
from here yet. It depends on too many unknowns. We don’t know where the 
COVID virus is going to take us. We don’t know where Black Lives Matter 
is going to take us right now. Do we get a real practical conversation 
going about race and policing and ultimately about the economic 
inequality that’s been a stain on our social contract?<br>
<br>
And of course, nobody knows where our next election is going to take us.
 I believe that our current president is a threat to our democracy. He 
simply makes any kind of reform that much harder. I don’t know if our 
democracy could stand another four years of his custodianship. These are
 all existential threats to our democracy and our American way of life.<br>
If you look at all this, you could be pessimistic, but there are 
positive sides in each of these circumstances. I think we’ve got hope 
for a vaccine. I think any time there is a 50-foot Black Lives Matter 
sign leading to the White House, that’s a good sign. And the 
demonstrations have been white people and black people and brown people 
gathering together in the enraged name of love. That’s a good sign.<br>
<br>
What’s more, our president’s numbers appear to be crashing through the 
basement. That’s a good sign. I believe we may have finally reached a 
presidential tipping point with that Lafayette Square walk, which was so
 outrageously anti-American, so totally buffoonish and so stupid, and so
 anti–freedom of speech. And we have a video of it that will live on 
forever.<br>
<br>
David Brooks: How music made Bruce Springsteen<br>
<br>
I have the feeling of optimism about the next election. I think it’s all
 these kids in the street that are inspiring the most hope in me. And 
the fact that these are demonstrations that are going on around the 
world. I think it’s a movement that ultimately is going to be about more
 than police violence, and George Floyd, may he rest in peace.<br>
<br>
Brooks: Let’s talk about some of the big subjects. These events have 
been yet another unveiling of racial injustice, racial division, and 
racial inequality. You’ve been singing about this for a long time. I 
remember in your song “My Hometown,” you talked about racial tension in 
the high school you grew up in. How do you think we’re doing overall? Do
 you think we’re making progress?<br>
Springsteen: If you look at some of the harsh events in the past weeks 
and then back to even just the recorded instances of oppression and 
police violence, you’d say we’re doing very badly. You could be very 
pessimistic. But on the other hand, I had a funny experience. When I 
watched the president march to St. John’s and pose with his Bible and 
his phony all-white contingent, it didn’t look real. Because it wasn’t 
real. That is not the America of today. That culture, which keeps black 
people invisible, is gone.<br>
<br>
In the present moment, if black people are not visible, that’s not 
acceptable. And I think that’s a sign of progress. When you see the 
Democratic side of the House filled with brown people and black people, 
straight people and gay people, and then you look at the Republicans, 
who appear unchanged by history at this moment? They look ridiculous. 
And despite their current power, they look like a failing party.<br>
<br>
If you look at the long narrative, like a half century ago when I was 20
 or in 1968, when I was 18, you would say there have been great 
improvements—the civil-rights movement, the Voting Rights Act, the Obama
 presidency. Of course, there’s a constant pushback to whatever progress
 gets made, by a reactionary element. But I feel that that’s smaller now
 than at any time in the past, and it’s diminishing. It’s folks who see 
themselves being left behind by history and losing status, and it’s 
forces within the Republican Party and in society that are intent on 
keeping the power balance of the nation in one place, when that’s simply
 going to be impossible.<br>
<br>
So I would say there have been a lot of improvements, but obviously we 
have a long way to go. There is the classic Martin Luther King quote: <br>
<em class="text-italics">“The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.”</em> <br>
<br>
I still believe that. But it just does an awful lot of zigging and 
zagging along the way. And it feels way too slow for our current times.<br>
<br>
But we’re having a national discussion of police behavior that’s been so
 long overdue. It’s going to be painful, but I think it’s going to have 
positive effects. In the video age, police misconduct—unprovoked 
violence, murders—can’t be ignored or hidden. The president can pretend 
it’s all not happening, and that George Floyd is smiling down from 
heaven because of the job reports this week. But every American, and I 
believe the whole world, can see right now that the status quo is not 
okay. And that’s progress. I have a feeling that things are better now 
and are going in the right direction, despite or because of our current 
moment of some chaos.<br>
<br>
Brooks: We’re not going to have only conversation here; we’re also going
 to hear a little music. And these are songs you selected to enrich the 
moment and maybe give a deeper understanding of what’s going on. The 
first song you selected is “Strange Fruit” by Billie Holiday.<br>
<br>
<br>
Springsteen: It was written by Abel Meeropol in 1937. So imagine writing
 “Strange Fruit,” a song about southern lynching, and getting a popular 
singer like Billie Holiday to sing it in 1939. That was a very 
controversial recording. Her label, Columbia, did not want to release 
it. And she released it on another label.<br>
It’s just an epic piece of music that was so far ahead of its time. It 
still strikes a deep, deep, deep nerve in the conversation of today.<br>
<br>
Brooks: Let’s talk about America and the meaning of America. I once 
heard you say, in an interview, that Woody Guthrie wrote “This Land Is 
Your Land” in response to Irving Berlin’s “God Bless America.” That’s an
 illustration of how songwriters have always had this long conversation 
about what America means. And we’re sort of in a crisis around that now.
 We have an American national narrative that doesn’t include everybody. 
So how do you think about the meaning of America, the American story?<br>
<br>
<br>
Springsteen: When I started, I self-consciously saw myself as an 
American artist and as an average American. I figured I had a talent 
that allowed me to create a language in which I could speak about the 
things that concern me and that I felt were of concern to the place that
 I lived—to my neighbors and the people that I’d grown up with. I don’t 
know if I would call it a political point of view, but I had a point of 
view when I was very young, and I always viewed popular music as a 
movement towards greater freedom. Great music brings greater freedom …<br>
I don’t think there will ever be one music that’s going to tell the full
 story, the full American story, again. The culture is too fractured 
right now. But I believe it’s the artist’s duty to proceed as if that 
above statement is untrue. To proceed as if it’s possible to have a 
monocultural moment and to write something and to record something that 
is deeply meaningful and exciting and will reach the whole nation and 
change the culture. You’ve got to go ahead on that impulse, you know.<br>
<br>
But I think from here on in, the American musical conversation is going 
to be a cacophony of rap and pop and Latin music and so on, and there’ll
 probably even be some room for an old guy and a little bit of rock 
music. On my radio show on SiriusXM, I try to include all those 
different voices. It’s the only way to tell the American story that I 
remain committed to doing.<br>
<br>
Brooks: One of the songs you selected is the Paul Robeson version of 
“The House I Live In.”&nbsp; This was a song originally written to 
combat anti-Semitism, and Robeson told it in a new way.<br>
<br>
Springsteen: The Robeson version is quite, quite beautiful. He was an 
interesting guy. He was blacklisted during the McCarthy era. He was an 
anti-fascist and took part in the early civil-rights movement, supported
 the Loyalists during the Spanish Civil War, and was a stage and film 
actor also. He had this incredible baritone that was just kind of room 
shaking. And this, once again, is a song written by Abel Meeropol. I 
don’t know exactly who he was, but he was the Bob Dylan of his time. He 
was writing incredible music. And it’s just a beautiful and powerful 
piece of music.<br>
<br>
Brooks: Let’s talk about social change. Every few decades, we seem to 
have moments of convulsive change. We had such a moment in 1968, when as
 you mentioned, you were 18. And a lot of people think this is another 
of those moments. How does this feel compared to 1968?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Yeah, there are similarities. I certainly felt them a few 
weeks ago when the SpaceX rocket was going up and cities were burning. I
 had a 1968 flashback.<br>
<br>
But I think, as President Barack Obama said in his speech recently, that
 there are great differences. There was an unbridled rage in 1968 that 
isn’t quite there today to the same degree. The level of violence, as 
bad as it was last week, was noticeably less than in ’68. And the 
protesters are younger. They’re much more diverse.<br>
<br>
White and black people were not burning down Newark or Asbury Park 
together in 1968. That was not happening. The outrage and the feeling of
 “enough is enough” is similar. But all in all, I think it’s different 
protests for different times. In ’68 we had assassinations. We had wars 
in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia. We had the rise of the “southern strategy” 
to counteract the rise of the civil-rights movement, which all led to 
Nixon and impeachment—and which should have actually happened here, if 
not for the gutlessness of the Republican Party.<br>
<br>
Brooks: Let’s go to your next song. It’s “Made in America,” by Jay-Z and Kanye West. This is off their Watch the Throne album.<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Yeah, I love this song. It’s so soulful and beautiful<br>
<br>
<br>
Brooks: You’ve written dozens of what I guess, if you’re comfortable 
with the label, could be called protest songs. They talk about social 
evils. They talk about wrongs. “The Ghost of Tom Joad” and so many 
others. Probably your most prescient song was “American Skin,” which 
most people know as “41 Shots.” And what’s interesting about that song, 
and I’m curious to ask about just how you write political music, is that
 it has a political message in response to a police shooting of a young 
African American guy.<br>
<br>
But it’s also got different vantage points. You’ve got a black mother 
talking to her son about how to stay safe. You’ve also got the vantage 
point of the cop. So how do you keep the ambiguity of art, but also make
 it a clear political statement?<br>
<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Well. I never looked at my music as protest songs. I always
 tried to write what I thought were complicated character studies that 
had social implications, because I believe you have to create complex 
characters that you breathe creative, three-dimensional life into. And 
that’s how you find the truth in something.<br>
<br>
“American Skin” came about while I was on my way to Atlanta and New 
York. It was the last two shows of the tour, and I wanted to write 
something new. We played it in Atlanta, which was a great place to debut
 it, you know. But by the time we got to New York and before we had even
 played it, it exploded in the press. It was tremendously controversial 
with some of the police unions. And this was a song—we have to 
understand—nobody had heard yet. But there was a big brouhaha about it. A
 lot of the people who had strong opinions about that song simply never 
heard it. And if they did hear it, they didn’t really listen to it, 
because it was quite a balanced picture of that incident, the shooting 
of Amadou Diallo.<br>
<br>
It’s one of the songs I am most proud of. Diallo’s family came and saw 
his tribute at Madison Square Garden. There was some tussle when we 
played it. I got shown the New Jersey state bird by a group of police 
officers, but it was all okay. There was some booing and some cheering, 
and it was just a part of the set at the end of the day.<br>
<br>
But it was written out of the idea that at the heart of our racial 
problems is fear. Hate comes later. Fear is instantaneous. So in 
“American Skin,” I think what moves you is the mother’s fear for her son
 and the rules that she has to lay down so he can be safe. It’s simply 
heartbreaking to watch a young child be schooled in this way. And the 
officer lives in his own world of fear. He’s got a family at home with 
expectations and needs. They were both living pawns in centuries-long 
irresolution of our race issues. And with each passing year a bill 
arrives, let’s say, and for every year of not dealing with this issue, 
payment on that bill comes due, and that payment is in blood and tears, 
the blood and tears of us all.<br>
<br>
Those were the stakes I thought I was writing about, and it’s one of the
 songs I’m still proudest of. It’s a good song. It’s lasted and it’s 
done its job well<br>
<br>
Brooks: There is a question I’ve always wanted to ask you. You’ve spent 
so much of your life writing about working-class men and, in particular,
 working-class men who were victims of deindustrialization, who used to 
work in the factories and mills that were closed, whether in Asbury Park
 or Freehold or Youngstown or throughout the Midwest. But a lot of those
 guys didn’t turn out to share your politics. They became Donald Trump 
supporters. What’s your explanation for that?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: There’s a long history of working people being misled by a 
long list of demagogues, from George Wallace and Jesse Helms to fake 
religious leaders like Jerry Falwell to our president.<br>
<br>
The Democrats haven’t really made the preservation of the middle and 
working class enough of a priority. And they’ve been stymied in bringing
 more change by the Republican Party. In the age of Roosevelt, 
Republicans represented business; Democrats represented labor. And when I
 was a kid, the first and only political question ever asked in my house
 was “Mom, what are we, Democrats or Republicans?” And she answered, “We
 are Democrats because they’re for the working people.” (I have a 
sneaking suspicion my mom went Republican towards the end of her 
cognizant life, but she never said anything about it!)<br>
<br>
<br>
In addition, there is a core and often true sense of victimization that 
has been brought on by the lightning pace of deindustrialization and 
technological advancement that’s been incredibly traumatic for an 
enormous amount of working people across the nation. The feeling of 
being tossed aside, left behind by history, is something our president 
naturally tapped into.<br>
<br>
There is resentment of elites, of specialists, of cosmopolitan coast 
dwellers, some of it merited. It is due to attitudes among some that 
discount the value and sacrifice so many working people have made for 
their country. When the wars are being fought, they are there.&nbsp; 
When the job is dirty and rough, they are there. But the president 
cynically taps into primal resentments and plays on patriotism for 
purely his political gain.<br>
<br>
There is a desire for a figure who will once again turn back the clock 
to full factories, high wages, and for some, the social status that 
comes with being white—that is a difficult elixir, prejudices and all, 
for folks who are in dire straits to resist. Our president didn’t 
deliver on the factories or the jobs returning from overseas or much 
else for our working class. The only thing he delivered on was 
resentment, division, and the talent for getting our countrymen at each 
other’s throats. He made good on that, and that is how he thrives. 
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Brooks: A kid growing up watching Elvis and the Beatles on The Ed 
Sullivan Show wasn’t automatically going to turn political. What was the
 influence in that part of your life?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: It came out of an instinct I had when I reached the 
position of having great personal license, which I did in 1975 with the 
release of the album Born to Run. Something didn’t feel right to me. I 
didn’t feel finished. I didn’t feel at home. I felt incredibly 
uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
And it took me a long time to realize that personal license is to real 
freedom what masturbation is to sex. It’s not bad, but it’s not the real
 thing. And as I started on this record, Darkness on the Edge of Town, I
 said, I want to turn the car around. I want to go back to my 
neighborhood, and I want to understand the structural issues, personal 
issues, social issues that are pressing down hard on the people I’m 
writing about and still living among. That’s where what I’m looking for 
resides. And so that’s kind of where my politics really began to 
develop, out of concern for my own moral, spiritual, emotional health, 
and that of my neighbors.<br>
<br>
Brooks: That brings us to our next song, which sounds like a 
Trump-protest song. It’s “That’s What Makes Us Great” by Joe Grushecky.<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Joe said to me, “Gee, I wrote this song. It’s called ‘That’s What Makes Us Great.’”<br>
And this was right around the time of the MAGA movement. I said, “Well, 
that’s a great title.” And it is. And he said, “Why don’t you sing it 
with me?” And so we sang it together.<br>
<br>
<br>
Brooks: You mentioned that when you made Darkness, you had to go back to
 your roots. You were on the cover of Newsweek and Time; your career 
blew up. You could’ve gone big and global. Instead, you went back home 
and local. And you’re still there. You’re still sort of in the 
neighborhood of Asbury Park.<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Yeah, I’m still in New Jersey, 20 minutes away from Asbury, 10 minutes from Freehold.<br>
So I’m still very comfortable here.<br>
<br>
Brooks: How are those towns doing?&nbsp; What do they tell you about the wider American experience?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: I’ve always felt everybody has this moral, spiritual 
geography, emotional geography, inside themselves. You may live in 
Barcelona, but you can feel you’re related to Asbury Park, some place 
you may never go. But if a songwriter is writing well and is writing 
about the human condition, you’ll take them there. They’ll get there. We
 have our greatest audience overseas—I think two-thirds to more of our 
audience now is in Europe. People are still captured by and deeply 
interested in America, what’s going on here and the American myth. The 
American story is a worldwide story, and it continues to have tremendous
 power.<br>
<br>
Brooks: One final question. When you did your Broadway show, you ended 
it with a very direct, stark version of the Lord’s Prayer, which 
surprised a lot of people. It made me go back to your music and listen 
to old songs in new ways. You have a party song called “Mary’s Place.” 
But when you see it through the possible prism of faith, it’s the most 
happy tribute to Mother Mary ever written. I don’t know if you wrote it 
that way. So I just want to ask you, how do you experience holiness and 
the holy presences in the world right now?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: If you look at “Mary’s Place,” it’s about going someplace 
where there is community and fraternity and spiritual sustenance. So 
that’s what that song is all about at its bottom, and that’s what most 
of my music is about—“The Promised Land,” “Badlands,” and the rest are 
all about people trying to find their spiritual and moral and social way
 through the world. And trying to find a place where they can build a 
home, where those values sustain them.<br>
<br>
I don’t follow a lot of rituals, but I still hold a close place, 
probably, for the Catholic Church, just out of indoctrination and habit,
 I suppose. You know, despite my misgivings, my children aren’t 
baptized. I’ve got pagan babies, and they seem to be doing fine 
spiritually. They’re good, solid souls!<br>
<br>
But I reference my Catholic upbringing very regularly in my songs. I 
have a lot of biblical imagery, and at the end of the day, if somebody 
asked me what kind of a songwriter I was, I wouldn’t say I was a 
political songwriter. I would probably say a spiritual songwriter. I 
really believe that if you look at my body of work, that is the subject 
that I’m addressing. I’ve addressed social issues. I’ve addressed 
real-life issues here on Earth. I always say my verses are the blues and
 my choruses are the gospel. And I lean a little heavier on the gospel 
than the blues. So I would categorize myself as ultimately a spiritual 
songwriter.<br>
<br>
Brooks: Let’s close with a jolt of caffeine from a friend of yours—“People Have the Power,” by Patti Smith.<br>
<br>
Springsteen: This is just purely a great, great anthem. And one of those
 songs I wish I’d written, but I’m really, really happy that she wrote 
it. I don’t think there’s a better song for this moment than this song.</div>

<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"><strong class="text-strong">APRIL 8</strong></span><br>
<br>
“My children are all off in their own homes, and claim they don’t want 
to come and visit, in order not to kill us. So … it’s hard to argue 
against.  The only thing that I’m really sure of is that after all this 
is over, the world isn’t going to be quite the same. I think we’re all 
going to be suffering some post-traumatic stress, and people are going 
to take a while before they trust one other again, before they can come 
close, before they can gather at events that have been so wonderful 
parts of the celebration of being human and being together.<br>
<br>
It’s lonely down here on the farm. I got my baby with me and we’re doing
 great: Patti and I have a new rhythm to our day. But it’s tough not 
seeing the people you care about. These days, you can feel like you’re 
looking out over the edge of the apocalypse. I think the strangest thing
 is how the world suddenly feels so unsafe. A walk. Going to the grocery
 street. A drive and then a walk along the beach, which is now closed. 
All you know is, that feeling of safety that you once had has been 
stripped away. <br>
<br>
Everybody’s wakin’ up these days with that feeling that it’s Groundhog 
Day. Every day is like the other day. And that’s like the other day. And
 that’s like the other day. I get up. I exercise. I exercise some more. I
 go downstairs. I eat breakfast. I eat breakfast again. Then I sit in 
front of the fire and I read a little bit. If we’re lucky, we get 
outside, get around the farm a little bit, Patti and I. And then we get 
to have dinner. And then we have some more dinner. And then we watch the
 news. It’s all bad. And we got to bed. And then we get up and we do it 
again. Looking for a little light at the end of the tunnel.<br>
<br>
The folks who are suffering the worst are the folks who have no safety 
net, nothing to soften the blow of the incredible unemployment that’s 
sweeping the nation out there, folks who live week to week, and just one
 week out of work, simply is enough to change and kick the bottom out of
 your life.<br>
<br>
There is an element of the spiritual that you have to call on to make it
 through these days, whether it’s prayer, or whether it’s just praying 
together. I’m not sure, but I know that when these days end, and they 
will end, there will be a religious celebration, a spiritual 
celebration.<br>
<br>
There is that cliché that says women like to talk, and men don’t like to
 talk. But all I can say is that in our house, we’re talkin’ (laughs). 
We’re doin’ some talkin.<br>
<br>
I believe that some of the love that has grown, the togetherness that 
has grown … you see people come out on their balconies and applaud all 
of the health workers who are putting themselves on the line day after 
day after day. Their courage and their bravery is truly something I have
 never seen before<br>
<br>
“Are you alright out there? Are you social distancing? Are you washing 
your hands? are you staying in your home with your loved one. I think 
that’s the question of the year: Are you alright?”<br>
<br>
If you’re there by yourself, that ain’t so bad! I did 35 years by myself
 … and I liked it! (laughs) My son’s doing that now. Both of them. And 
they sound pretty happy. … What do you miss? Everybody misses something.
 What do you really miss? I miss going to Max’s and the Windmill and 
getting a hot dog. I miss walking along the promenades, the beach and 
boardwalk in Asbury Park. I miss sitting at the bar, having some beers 
and drinking with some friends. And I miss baseball. Baseball. I’m not 
much of a sports fanatic at all, but I do like baseball. And this is for
 all the things we miss. All the things that make us, us. And all I know
 is, when this is all over, I’m going to take Patti to a baseball game.”<br>

“I’ve lived in the United States for 70 years now, and I have to admit 
I’ve often been disappointed in our failure to live up to our ideals. 
But I also have to say, I’ve never really been able to deny that there’s
 a promise that constantly resides in the American people, that could 
make us the great democratic nation that we carry in our hearts and in 
our dreams. And if we put our hearts and our lives together and fought 
for the very ideals, those of equality, of liberty, of social justice, 
of compassion for our neighbors, we would find that this is where our 
strength resides. And we have it within in our power to create the kind 
of humane society we’ve always dreamt of. Now, all of this sounds corny 
when you say it. But it ain’t corny when you do i<br>
<br>
I guess one of the hardest things about recent times is the distance you
 have to place between you and your loved ones. The inability to hug 
them and to kiss them and to comfort them … it is painful to live 
without. You know, my mom has had Alzheimer’s for 10 years, and she 
lives in the present. This moment and this moment only is hers. And so 
touching her, and hugging, and kissing her are very, very, very 
important for her life experience right now. And one of the things we’ve
 had to suffer with is, we can’t do that right now, for her safety and 
for her health.<br>
<br>
New York has struggled so tremendously with this disease. My son lives 
up there, Downtown, and of course we’ve been worried him, and about 
everybody else, too. I’m gonna send these next two songs out to all the 
health care workers, all the doctors and the nurses who’ve put their 
lives on the line, for the critically ill, and the citizens of New York.<br>
<br>
“I think one of the most frustrating things about this virus is not 
knowing how long we’re going to have to live like this. I have a 
blackboard that I mark the days on, as if I was in prison. I think I 
reached a month and a half a few days ago. So looking at the months 
ahead, it’s going to be quite a while before we’re able to open up our 
society, before people are going to be able to trust one another to 
congregate in large or small groups, before there is music, before there
 is sports, before there is family gatherings. It’s a very disheartening
 view. I think it may take a vaccine until we’re all really comfortable 
with one another. So we’ve got to stay strong, and stay at home, and 
stay together,<br>
<br>
I think one of the hard things in difficult times is keeping faith, and 
not letting the struggle and the pain … and the grief overcome you. 
That’s very, very hard. There’s a lot of people that have suffered a lot
 of loss over these days. Now our thoughts and out prayers, of course, 
go out to you, but I know that that is cold comfort, because those of 
you who have lost husbands and wives and sons and daughters<br>
<br>
There was an oped a while back in the New York Times that I would advise
 every American who cares about his country to read. It is called ‘The 
America We Need.’ Now let me paraphrase from just a small, small piece 
of it. Frank Delano Roosevelt said liberty requires opportunity to make a
 living, a living decent according to the standard of the time. A living
 which gives a man or a woman not only enough to live by, but something 
to live for. Now the … pandemic has laid bare the inequalities in wealth
 and in health that plague our nation. In Michigan, hard-hit by the 
coronavirus, African-Americans make up 14 percent of the population but 
40 percent of the deaths from this disease. So many disenfranchised 
Americans lack the essential liberty to protect their own lives, and the
 lives of their families. This pandemic has shown the great divide 
between our American Dream and American reality, between current America
 versus the ideals enshrined in our founding documents. Now that’s just a
 small piece of the editorial, and I hope I didn’t do it a disservice. 
But all I know is, here in the beginning of the 21st century, in 
Paterson and other New Jersey cities, in Michigan, in rural America, and
 all across the United States, this reality is so frustrating that, as 
the great Marvin Gaye said, then we should want to holler.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"><strong class="text-strong">May 6</strong></span><br>
<br>
As hard as it is to believe right now, your children will go back to 
school. Churches will be open and full. You will once again hug and kiss
 family members at your gatherings. You will shout over the noise of a 
crowded bar to order a drink and speak to your friends. You will buy a 
hot dog at Yankee Stadium. You will walk through the streets of your 
hometown, free and easy. You may hold a complete stranger on a crowded 
dance floor. And 50,000 people will once again scream their heads off 
somewhere in New Jersey.<br>
<br>
It’s funny how the weather this past two and a half months, since the 
lockdown … the weather has taken on a whole new level of importance in 
my life (laughs). I check the forecast three or four times a day. I pray
 for summer. I suffer through gray clouds and rain. I got a dog that 
wakes me up like clockwork, every morning at sunrise. So around 6:30 
every day, I am standing in our front field, waiting for the sun to come
 up. And on those days, when it rises and washes a golden light across 
the fields into the trees, I take a deep sigh of gratitude, and I am 
momentarily deceived into believing that things are almost normal, or at
 least that they will be. I never thought that the emotional beginning 
of my day could so depend on a change in the weather.<br>
<br>
I can tell you one thing I’m doin’ every day. Come rain or shine, at 4 
o’clock, I’m setting myself up a drink. A shot and a beer … I’m not 
waitin’ til 5 o’clock … or a little vodka and soda. And I am on my way 
to shortly putting a new shine on this whole experience. I take no shame
 in it, at this place and time, to looking into something that is gonna 
fuck me up.<br>
<br>
I was out last night on an errand, around 9:30. Let me tell you who else
 was out there: Nobody. Nobody at all. The streets were barren, the 
highway was not alive. It was like, while we were waiting for the 
apocalypse, it had already happened.<br>
“All I can tell you is, when this experience is over, I am gonna throw 
the wildest party you have ever seen, and you, my friends, are all 
invited<br>
<br>
Now all this staying at home can create tension between you and your 
significant other. After about two months of 24/7, you are gonna know 
exactly where your relationship stands. Tolerating each other is not 
enough. Deep down, you’ve got to like one another. You’ve got to give 
each other as much room as you can.<br>
<br>
“Besides the bravery of our front line health care workers … the folks 
who’ve stepped to the front during this national crisis, whose service 
goes less remarked upon, are the working people who keep our society 
running. Our sanitation workers, our grocery clerks, the folks who are 
in low-paying service jobs that require a high degree of contact with 
the public, they are carrying the full weight of this virus for all of 
us. The coronavirus has revealed, once again, the fissures in our 
society, the inequalities that put the backbone of our society, our 
working people, at risk. <br>
<br>
Remember to practice your social distancing. We need a new dance called 
The Distance. You have to be 10 feet away from your partner to do it. 
All right, somebody work on that.<br>
<br>
“Well, I’ll tell you what frustrates me right now: The fact that, as a 
country, we were so ill-prepared for this pandemic. And it’s not like it
 hadn’t been predicted. If you willfully ignore science and scientific 
fact in the year 2020, you end up suggesting to people that they should 
ingest household products to clear themselves of the virus. Not a smart 
idea. You and all those you’re responsible for will pay the price. Now, 
the head of our government knew as early as January of the dangers the 
coronavirus posed to our country, and failed to act. Thousands of mortal
 lives could have been saved, had their warning been heeded<br>
<br>
We are currently living through a once-in-a-century event, and as such, 
it feels biblical in nature. We have been visited by a plague. Our 
strength resides in our ability to hope, and in our faith. So I went to 
The Bible, and I found an Ephesians quote. ‘I pray that the eyes of your
 heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which 
He has called you.’ ‘That the eyes of your heart may be enlightened’: I 
like that. We could use some enlightened hearts, right about now,<br>
<br>
“I was living in L.A., and I walked into the Sunset Marquis motel, one 
late afternoon, and I walked into its Whisky Bar, and there was exactly 
one patron sitting at the bar: Joe Strummer. We had never met, so we 
introduced ourselves to each other, and we had a relaxed and sweet 
conversation for 45 minutes or so. It was the only time we ever met, but
 I always felt very, very close to him, as an artist, and was deeply 
saddened at his young and untimely passing. <br>
<br>
“Now I used to regularly go to Freehold Memorial Day Parade. It was kind
 of the beginning of each summer. I’d ride my bike down there and take a
 spot on the corner with everybody else, just watch it go by. And it was
 something beautiful in its small town consistency. It was just the same
 year after year, since I was a child. You know, the fire engines, the 
marching band, the Veterans of Foreign Wars marching in lockstep. A few 
classic cars, ending at the racetrack. And that was about it. Right now,
 I miss a parade. I’d like to go to a parade on an early summer day, 
right about now.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%"><strong class="text-strong">MAY 20</strong></span><br>
<br>
Times like these are testing. They reveal character. They can bring out 
your generousness or your selfishness, you kindness or your cruelty, 
your love or your fear. Just take a look at our man at the top. Hard 
times do that.<br>
“So I take a daily drive, because driving has always relaxed me, and it 
gets me out of Patti’s hair for a while. I drive all my old routes, 
through all my old towns, day after day. I see old shops shuttered, what
 folks there are on the street, in masks. My favorite hangouts closed. 
Take-out only, God bless ’em. And I drive out to Manasquan Inlet, my old
 man’s stomping grounds, to sit and watch the boats for a while. But 
they’ve closed all the parking places, and the boardwalk’s closed, so I 
find a side street. And I sit, roll down the window and feel the ocean 
breeze and read the newspaper for a while.<br>
<br>
“Thirty million workers joined the jobless ranks over the last two 
months. That is frightening and heartbreaking. A day doesn’t go by when I
 don’t thank my lucky stars, when I don’t know how profoundly fortunate I
 am.<br>
<br>
“So after an hour, I fold my newspaper, I start the car and I head home.
 And on my way on 79, I pass the ShopRite that I opened with The 
Castiles during its Midnight Madness opening in 1965. We played out in 
front of the supermarket. And it was the only time during this day that I
 saw a parking lot filled with cars, and it almost brought me to tears<br>
<br>
I’ve been thinking. Dating: how’s that going, all you singles out there?
 How is love in the time of corona? I am old and I simply can’t imagine 
it. I mean, it’s got to be happening. But how? I mean, is testing going 
on? I guess there’s virtual dating. Why wouldn’t there be? I don’t know 
how satisfying that can be. No physical contact. Yikes! There’s no sex, I
 would imagine. I guess there’s also sexting and naked selfies. They say
 naked selfies is the new seduction. I read an article that said this is
 the golden age of naked selfies. Hell, I may take a few myself when 
this show is over. Why not? Desperate times call for desperate measures<br>
<br>
When this is over, and I do have faith that it’s gonna be over, I want 
to do the simple things again … get an ice cream cone at the Jersey 
Freeze. Be able to walk inside, step up to the counter and say, ‘soft 
vanilla, dipped in chocolate, please.’ I wanna get a pizza with my pal, 
the ex-mayor of Freehold, and all my old friends, down at Federici’s. I 
wanna take in the boardwalk on a quiet weekday night in Point Pleasant, 
lose all my money at the wheels of chance. Hang at the beach till around
 5:30 or 6, when the evening cool just begins to drift in, and that sun 
is low and warm on your skin. That is my favorite time of the day. Then I
 may head into Red Bank and stop at Jack’s record store — stay strong, 
Jack, we’re lucky to have a record store in Red Bank, that’s for sure — 
and maybe find a place to sit outside and have a drink, just surrounded 
by folks without a worry, just going about their business. Never has the
 mundane seemed so … attractive. Yep, when this is over, I just want to 
take a walk downtown.<br>
<br>
Now, the toughest thing about lockdown is the feeling of not knowing 
what the future holds, the feeling of your whole life being placed on 
hold. Time seeming to move quickly but slowly. Now empty and unused 
time, I don’t care for, especially at 70. I’m counting my days and, my 
friends, I’ve got things to do that involve me and you. My son’s 25 and 
he worried about the time it’s taking out of his life. But I feel like 
Muhammad Ali, who was at his prime — I’m in my late prime — but who was 
at his prime, and the years that he could have spent boxing were taken 
away from him. So I try to heed my deceased Aunt Eda’s advice. She 
always said, ‘Just live every day live as if you’re gonna live forever.’
 I like that: ‘Live every day as if you’re gonna live forever.’ I think 
she meant, ‘Greet each day on its own terms, as an opportunity for 
life’s possibilities. Breathe it in, let the world open up before you, 
and prepare yourself to accept it in its entirety, on its own terms, 
with a vengeance.’ Well, I’m ready, and I hope you are, too. But right 
now, the waiting is the hardest part.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now the protesters that we’ve seen in some of our state capitols, 
pushing to get the country to open up and cut back on some of the 
mitigation, concern me. I worry for them, first of all. Because up to 
this point, that mitigation’s been our only defense against the deadly 
virus. I know folks need to get back to work, they need to get their 
bills paid, they need to feed their families. But the country should 
reopen in a cautious, safe and responsible manner, not carelessly, in a 
gesture that will cost tens of thousands of lives, prodded on by a 
president who went against his own government mandate in advising 
citizens to ‘liberate Michigan’ and ‘liberate Virginia.’ And frankly, 
that is the wrong language right now, and it pissed me off. It’s just 
weak and irresponsible. It was the gesture of a man willing to roll the 
dice with the lives of those who put him into office, and their 
children, and their elderly friends and families at risk, for perhaps 
nothing more than an election-year ploy. It’s cowardly.”<br>

8 MINUTES - how long it took George Floyd to die, with a Minneapolis 
officer’s knee buried into his neck. That’s a long time. That’s how long
 he begged for help, and said he couldn’t breathe. The arresting 
officer’s response was nothing but silence and weight. Then he had no 
pulse, and still it went on. That goes out to Seattle, to New York, to 
Miami, to Atlanta, to Chicago, to Dallas, to Philadelphia, to 
Washington, to Los Angeles, to Asbury Park, to Minneapolis, and to the 
memory of George Floyd. May he rest in peace.<br>
<br>
“As we speak, 40 million people are unemployed (and) 100,000-plus 
citizens have died from COVID-19, with only the most tepid and unfeeling
 response from our White House. As of today, our black citizens continue
 to be killed unnecessarily by our police, on the streets of America. 
And as of this broadcast, the country was on fire and in chaos. We are 
153 days to our next election. God help us. Vote. That’s what makes us 
great. When the politics of paranoia, division, prejudice, intolerance, 
fear — all that’s antithetical to the American idea — hold court in the 
land, we are in deep trouble, my fellow citizens.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“ Thank you very kindly, my very dear friends.<br>
<br>
These churches are really loaded tonight. Never in the history of this 
nation have so many people been arrested for the cause of freedom and 
human dignity. You know, there are approximately 2,500 people in jail 
right now.<br>
Now let me say this: the thing that we are challenged to do is to keep 
this movement moving. There is power in unity and there is power in 
numbers. As long as we keep moving like we are moving, the power 
structure of Birmingham will have to give in. And we are probably nearer
 to a solution to this problem than we are able to realize, and don’t 
worry about your children — they are going to be all right. Don’t hold 
them back if they want to go to jail, for they are doing a job for not 
only themselves, but for all of America and for all mankind.<br>
Somewhere we read a little child shall lead them. Remember there was 
another little child just 12 years old and he got involved in a 
discussion back in Jerusalem as his parents moved down the dusty road 
leading them back to that little village of Nazareth, and when they got 
back and bothered him and touched him and wanted him to move on at that 
moment he said, “I must be about my Father’s business.”<br>
<br>
These young people are about their Father’s business. And they are 
carving a tunnel of hope through the great mountain of despair. And they
 will bring to this nation a newness and a genuine quality and an 
idealism that it so desperately needs.<br>
<br>
Now we are going to see that they are treated right. Don’t worry about 
that. The Justice Department is already in here, and they don’t have 
some small fish from the Justice Department, they have some of the big 
fish in here. We are reminding them at all times that these persons are 
political prisoners. There is a distinction between a political prisoner
 and somebody who is there for getting drunk, or somebody who’s there 
for engaging in a robbery, and we’re gonna see that they are treated 
right, and go on and not only fill up the jails around here, but just 
fill up the jails all over the state of Alabama if necessary.<br>
<br>
Keep this movement going. Keep this movement rolling. In spite of the 
difficulties — and we’re gonna have a few more difficulties — keep 
climbing. Keep moving. If you can’t fly, run. If you can’t run, walk. If
 you can’t walk, crawl. But by all means, keep moving.”</em><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">-Martin Luther King jnr, 1963</strong><br>
<br>
The Birmingham Movement was organized by the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference, to bring attention to the integration efforts of 
African-Americans in Birmingham, Ala. Their confrontations between young
 black students and white civic authorities led to the municipal 
government changing the discrimination laws, and was part of the broader
 movement towards civil rights that changed the face of the nation.<br>
<br>
“Now, almost 60 years later, we wake again, to an America with 
burned-out buildings, torched police cars, and shattered shop windows, a
 cost that we’re paying for another half of a century of unresolved 
fundamental issues of race. We have not cared for our house very well. 
There can be no standing peace without the justice owed to every 
American, regardless of their race, color or creed. The events of this 
week have once again proven that out. We need systemic changes in our 
law enforcement departments, and in the political will of our national 
citizenry, to once again move forward the kind of changes that will 
bring the ideals of the Civil Rights Movement, once again to light, and 
into this moment.<br>
<br>
We remain haunted, generation after generation, by our original sin of 
slavery. It remains the great unresolved issue of American society. The 
weight of its baggage gets heavier with each passing generation. And as 
of this violent, chaotic week on the streets of America, there is no end
 in sight.<br>
<br>
We have a choice between chaos or truth, a spiritual, moral, democratic 
awakening or becoming a national fallen to history, with critical issues
 we refuse to or couldn’t address. Is our American system flexible, to 
make, without violence, the humane, fundamental changes necessary for a 
just society. The American story, our story, is in our hands, and may 
God bless us all. Stay safe, stay well, stay strong, ”<br>

<br>
Well, it is the responsibility of those who lead us to inhabit the nexus
 where our national political and spiritual lives meet. The United 
States of America is ultimately a nation of souls. In times of historic 
calamity and tragedy, it is necessary for our leaders to administer, not
 only to our social needs, but to the union of souls that is our common 
citizenry. To tend to our wounds, both physical and psychic, and speak 
to the strengths and fears of our national family. <br>

“José Torres, 73, New York. A restaurateur favored by the city’s salsa music’s stars.<br>
“<br>
These are just a few of the souls who have passed away due to the coronavirus.<br>
<br>
“Now one of the most heartrending aspects of these deaths is that the 
virus has stolen from us our rituals: our funerals, our wakes, our house
 meetings with family after the burial, our ability to stand by our 
loved ones, to touch them, to kiss them as they pass, to look into their
 eyes, and to let them physically know how we love them. This is the 
cruelty of this disease, to say our last goodbyes to our loved ones by 
phone, and then to return home alone, to an empty house. It is a 
heartbreaking and lonely death for those afflicted, and for those left 
behind, to pick up the pieces.<br>
“Now when my father died, my close friends and my brother-in-law, we 
stood in the graveyard, in the midst of our large family, and we took 
shovels, and we buried my father ourselves. It meant a great, great, 
great deal to me, and is a memory I’ll cherish as long as I live. The 
importance of that ritual, and to stand with my loved ones on the 
burying ground.<br>
<br>
<br>
Real illness is frightening, and make no mistake about it, these are 
frightening times. The footage from inside some of the ERs that we’ve 
seen should be enough to convince you to stay safe, behave responsibly 
and heed the warning of your medical professionals. The souls intubated,
 struggling for each breath, are a testament to the deadliness of this 
virus, and to the bravery of our frontline doctors, nurses and health 
care professionals. Our health care professionals who willingly put 
themselves in harm’s way, risking their own lives for others, deserve 
some special dispensation in heaven and here on Earth. We owe them our 
eternal thanks.<br>

Summertime </strong><br>
<br>
<br>
I loved, and love summer. As a child, I became summer. I melted into the
 hot tarmac, I rolled myself into a sand ball at the beach. I slid 
beneath the murky water, ducking summer dragonflies at the Freehold 
Pond. I sat in the tops of trees, feeling the summer breeze trickle over
 my freshly cut Saturday afternoon flattop. I’d stand with my bike 
‘neath the August sun by the roadside, watching the locals on the road 
crew lay down the steaming blacktop, that beneath their rakes and 
shovels and heavy equipment curled and flattened like hot licorice. And 
when the big man in the machinery moved away, I waited, and I wanted my 
wheels to be the first to touch that steaming virgin roadway.<br>
<br>
“In the evening twilight, I sat glued to the curb with a Pinky rubber 
ball in my hand, waiting for my best friend Bobby Duncan to finish his 
dinner, so we could engage in epic gutter ball tournaments, into 
midnight. And then later, with scissors, we’d poke holes into the lids 
of glass Mason jars, and invade the vacant lot across from my 
grandmother’s front porch, to capture our nightly quota of the evening’s
 fireflies, just to leave them twinkling till dawn on our night tables, 
may they rest in peace. We’d play home free, running from pool of light 
to pool of light from our neighborhood streetlamps, until we were called
 in as the neighborhood’s porch lights went dark, by my grandmother’s 
voice. And there my sister and I would sleep on opposite sides of the 
bed, wrapped between hot, sticky sheets, on pre-air conditioning, humid,
 Jersey summer nights.<br>
<br>
“There were evenings, that if it got hot enough, my dad showed mercy on 
us, and he’d pack us into the Olds and set off in the darkness, on Route
 33, for the 20-mile ride to Manasquan, where — on those nights the heat
 and the humidity of inland Freehold became too much to bear — we’d 
sleep in our pajamas, our bed blankets stretched out on the cool sand, 
enjoying the ocean air of the Manasquan inlet. And then at early light, 
like magic, we’d be carried back into the house, into our bedroom, 
sandy-haired from our beach sleep, and I’d watch the sun splash its 
morning gold over the western wall of my room, and soon I’d smell my 
mother’s coffee drifting up through the floor grate that opened to my 
room. I’d lie awake and listen to my parents leave for work, and then 
I’d dress, skip breakfast, walk out onto our side porch, where the bare 
bones of the sun’s rays cut through the green latticework and warmed the
 wooden steps of our porch. There I’d sit, barely human, a creature of 
the earth, and the rain, and the sun, and summer.”<br>
<br>
<br>
As a teenager, I would stay up all night, as a crucible to pass, for 
three or four nights of the summer, as the house sank into a midsummer’s
 evening silence, I’d be camping out in my room, I’d have my flashlight,
 I’d have my Japanese transistor AM radio that I was listening to. I 
would take 2 or 3 a.m. walks around the town of Freehold, when the 
streets were mine! At night and only at night was I king of the streets 
of Freehold, N.J., unhassled by the day’s rednecks. (laughs) Anytime 
they’d see some long-hair pass the barber shop, they’d come running out 
with shaving cream half on their face. ‘Hey, are you a girl?’ (laughs). 
Ah! Whoah! That was bullshit I didn’t need in those days. So in the 
middle of the evening, I’d return home, 3:30 a.m., I’d arrive into the 
kitchen, I would build myself an almighty peanut butter and jelly 
sandwich, pouring it on. I would then retire to my room, to wait for my 
favorite song to be broadcast by the WMCA good guys. <br>
<br>
<br>
Now in my bed, in the summer, I’d be reading all my old copies of 
Surfing magazine. Did I surf? No. But the magazine held two very 
essential elements, surf or not. I was deeply interested in the 
perfectly tanned surfer girl in bikinis, and in the advertisements for 
Fender guitars. There they were in the fresh ads, the true objects of my
 desire. Three white Fenders. A bass, a Stratocaster, and a Jaguar, each
 as white as the Hawaiian sand, lined up next to each other, each more 
desirable than the next, but taken as a group, my God, the perfect 
Trifecta. Now I spent relatively short quality time with the pictures of
 the surfer girls, but I spent hours in my bunk, in my room, salivating 
over those guitars. I’d drift off to sleep with the magazine open on my 
chest, and then, riding the summer breeze, from the west, came skipping 
through my open bedroom window, a sound I swear that was coming from 
some perfect beach, thousands of miles away.”<br>
<br>
<br>
Those heartbreak summer songs … ‘Sealed with a Kiss,’ ‘See You in 
September,’ ouch! It was the longing, the longing from spring, late 
school year breakup … I cheated on a fabulous girlfriend I had, with one
 of my exes. One of the dumbest things I’ve ever done! And I immediately
 had buyer’s remorse. That summer, the summer of ’67, the summer of Sgt.
 Pepper, I chased my girl from beach town to beach town to beach town. 
Thank God, I was aided by a big ol’ ’60s ragtop black Cadillac and a car
 of good friends. My running pack: Jay, Sunrise, Bird. You guys saved my
 life that summer. I don’t know where you are now, but I’ve never 
forgotten you, and the solid that you did me in the summer of ’67.”<br>
<br>
Lana Del Rey is a singer, and a song, that reminds me of the hot, humid,
 sultry summer nights, and the girls that went with them. Nights so hot 
and still, fields of fireflies, leaves so still on neighborhood trees 
that they did not whisper. No rumor of a breeze in sight. You’d sit on 
the porch. You were dressed, waiting either for her, or the end of the 
world.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well up next is a studio outtake from 1983, of which there are many 
more, and one of the days, all this work that I did between Nebraska and
 The River will show up magically. I lived up on Telegraph Hill, on an 
old 165-acre farm that I rented for $700 a month. I had my ’60 ‘Vette, 
from the cover of “Born to Run” (the book), and I would take my girl to 
the Monmouth County Fair, which was a lot of fun, but a funkier 
proposition in those day. A lot of 4-H farm animals, and there was a car
 you could bust up with a sledgehammer, for two bucks. Oh, the simple 
joys. A dunk tank. After the fair, we’d ride back to the farm and put 
the roof down and sit out in front of the big old white farmhouse, lean 
back, listen to the music down low. We’d talk and look up at the stars.”<br>
<br>
<br>
As a teenager, my bedroom window faced south. And we lived on 68 South 
St. So I got light, but not much sun in the morning. I’d wake, I’d put 
on my uniform for a ’60s midsummer’s day. It was a white T-shirt, a pair
 of washed-out, cut-off blue jeans, slightly stiff with the salt of 
daily ocean swimming, their legs shredded at the thighs with grains and 
grains of sand in each pockets. And a pair of faded Converse sneakers. 
Now, I’d just finished and barely survived summer school. And Mr. 
DiTomasso — along with my Italian cousin Alphonse, Mr. DiTomasso’s 
assistant, and he was a Spanish wiz — now together we had all striven to
 understand the nuances of español. A musical language as it is, and as 
musical as I am, unfortunately we remained a hopeless match. Now with 
Alphonse’s sly assistance, I passed.<br>
“Well, now all I know is the rest of this summer is mine. My mornings, 
my afternoons, my evenings belonged to me. So I make my way down to the 
silent morning kitchen, last night’s dinner plates shining in their 
drying holders, compliments of no one, of course, but my mom. There was a
 $5 bill on the table next to a box of Corn Chex and a bowl. It’s her 
daily summer greeting to me. But the five is gonna have to last me all 
week, and the house is mine for a moment. My pop at work or, having 
bailed, still in bed, sleeping. My sister still in bed. The house is 
mind, and I love the quiet. I love the quiet of the house in the 
morning.<br>
“So I have a quick bowl of cereal, I scoop up the five, and I’m out the 
door, striding down South Street towards Route 33. I carry nothing but a
 folded beach towel under my arm. I made sure not to stick my thumb out 
until I reach 33, as that would bad-vodoo and jinx my chance of a quick 
ride east. At the stoplight, I settled into formation at the 
intersection: Highway 33 and Shore points. Where they meet, I take my 
hithchiker’s stance, one hip slung low, a knee slightly beat, thumb out,
 an air of nonchalance, like, I could give a shit if you gave me a ride 
or not. I take the occasional few steps backward towards for my 
destination, the beaches and bikinis of Manasquan, N.J., and I wait for 
the magic to begin. Now I’m confident that shortly a bored trucker … 
hot-rodder, traveling businessman or concerned mom will pick me up. I’ll
 hear car wheels squeal on gravel, and the passenger side of the door 
will open and then soon make that beautiful slamming sound of victory in
 the morning. Small talk will ensue, which you must be good at. And then
 an hour, three or four rides later, I will be deposited at Manasquan 
main beach. I will dodge the badge counters. Though it is un-American, 
in New Jersey we must pay to go to the beach. I do not, however, plan to
 have my arcade or lunch money eaten up by stinking beach badges. So I 
head for a plot of sand, I scan thoroughly for the beach cops and the 
nearest crowd of pretty girls, and I settle in. After a few moments in 
the sun, I head for my morning baptism in the wonderful, God-given 
Atlantic Ocean. Summer’s on.”<br>
<br>
<br>
In 1965 Freehold, there were no visible drugs to be seen. The high 
school principal was still concerned with you hiding out behind the gym,
 swigging beer. But that started to change around 1967, and one evening,
 there was the first drug bust that had ever occurred in history, as far
 as we knew, in Freehold, NJ. And the bass player for The Castiles? 
Goodbye. The organ player for The Castiles? Goodbye. The drummer for The
 Castiles? Goodbye. All ripped out of mommy’s and daddy’s arms, at 3 
a.m.<br>
“I was standing on the corner of Throckmorton and Main, standing guard 
at my phone booth, waiting for a late night call from my girlfriend. 
This was one of my permanent positions throughout the years of my high 
school, as we had no phone at home, and I was there at all hours of the 
evening and morning, standing with a friend of mine, Bruce Nelson. Bruce
 Nelson says, ‘I just saw Mrs. Bots go by in the cop car with Baby 
Bots.’ Mrs. Botts was Vinnie ‘Skeebots’ Manniello’s better half. I said,
 ‘Get outta here!’ He says, ‘She was in the the cop car with the Baby 
Bots, on her way to the police station.’ I said, ‘Nobody gets arrested 
with their baby!’ But sure enough, the Bots family went down to the 
police station, victims of the new Freehold Borough war on drugs. So 
that spelled the final chapter in my first band, the fabulous Castiles, ”<br>
<br>
<br>
I had a … painted white Chevy, seat-10, originally aqua blue truck, that
 my girlfriend had christened Supertruck. I had a three-on-the-tree 
manual trans, and I had it custom-rigged for drive-in Saturday nights. I
 had a half-couch that I had picked up off the curb garbage, and I fit 
it perfectly into the rear bed of the truck, pressed up against the rear
 window, and I set it in backwards, facing the tailgate. I picked up a 
cooler and a small hibachi grill, and we would head for the Shore, and 
in those days, the ’70s, you had your choice of three drive-ins in the 
Shore area. You had the Hazlet Drive-In, you had the Eatontown Drive-In 
and you had the Shore Drive-in. Now my favorite, because it was where my
 mom and pop would take us after the beach, the doubleheaders, was the 
Shore Drive-in, so that’s where we’d head, and I would back that truck, 
backwards into the parking place, with the bed facing the screen, andI 
would throw the speaker over the side, I would open the cooler, I would 
warm up that hibachi and pop on a little burger, and I would sit on that
 couch, with my arm around my girl, in paradise. That summer, we saw a 
doubleheader, Warren Oates in ‘Cockfighter’ and Clint Eastwood in 
‘Fistful of Dollars.’<br>
<br>
“There is nothing like the sea at night, when the water is slightly 
warmer than the air, even though the air is humid after a 95 degree day.
 God, I love swimming at night. It is all darkness and mystery. It is 
the void. And it must be done naked. Clothes at the waterline, please. 
Do this, and my pilgrim, you will become cleansed. Never will the 
evening air, or a kiss on the beach, or a dry towel, ever feel so good 
again. The walk to the car will be filled with star-lit grace, and you 
will never forget it. And once you’ve hit the water, you will be covered
 in the blossoming beauty of your youth, no matter how old you are, and 
whoever you are with, you will always remember them.”</div>

<br>
Tonight, we will start with a favorite of mine, as a child: Robert Louis
 Stevenson. I remember the summer I spent in my grandmother’s porch 
rocking chair, drinking cold lemonade and reading ‘The Wizard of Oz’ and
 ‘Treasure Island.’ Long John Silver, Jim Hawkins, mutiny, treasure 
maps, pirate ships.<br>
“The man who brought us ‘The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde’ 
was also a poet. This is a poem of his that’s fit for the evening.<br>
“Now the Land of Nod is mentioned in the Book of Genesis. It is where 
Cain was exiled by God after Cain had murdered his brother Abel, and 
Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the Land of Nod
 on the East of Eden. Nod is the Hebrew root of the verb ‘to wander.’ 
Therefore, to dwell in the Land of Nod can mean to be condemned to live a
 wandering life, I have known a little bit about that life.<br>
“This is ‘The Land of Nod’:<br>
“From breakfast on through all the day “At home among my friends I 
stay, “But every night I go abroad “Afar into the land of Nod.<br>
“All by myself I have to go, “With none to tell me what to do — “All 
alone beside the streams “And up the mountain-sides of dreams.<br>
“The strangest things are there for me, “Both things to eat and things 
to see, “And many frightening sights abroad “Till morning in the land of
 Nod.<br>
“Try as I like to find the way, “I never can get back by day, “Nor can remember plain and clear “The curious music that I hear.”<br>
<br>
For most of my life, I had no great fondness for the day. I was a born 
night crawler, up till 3 a.m. as a young child. Daylight hours meant 
waking too early, schoolwork, and somebody else runnin’ my life. But at 
night, I found my mind came to life. I felt a stimulation, and a 
creative excitement, a freedom, that eluded me in the day. At night, I 
felt most like myself.<br>
“Writing The River, I would rise around 4 p.m. I would crawl into the 
kitchen, I would eat a bowl of Cheerios, and I would go to work. Now I’d
 work for three hours, popping rough cassettes into my cassette player, 
and living and dying over each and every written word. I’d take a 7:30 
break to watch the ’77 Yankees battle the hated Dodgers until Reggie, 
Mr. October, launched three consecutive pitches from three different 
pitchers into the stands, putting one stadium and one small room in 
Holmdel, N.J., into an uproar. I’d finish my milk and my brownies, my 
baseball rations, and around 11 p.m., I’d pick my guitar back up. I 
would head to my workroom/bedroom, go to my desk and work till dawn. 
During the night, I’d grab anything to eat that would keep me burning, 
and I would bunk in around 8 a.m. For an entire fall and winter, I led a
 vampireish existence, barely catching any daylight.<br>
“All that night was just something that came naturally to me. There was 
just something I loved about being awake as the straight world slept. It
 excited me. It sparked my creativity. And it gave me the uninterrupted 
peace and quiet I needed to work. Occasionally I’d break curfew, just to
 get out of the house. I’d take a 2 or 3 a.m. night drive in my ’60 
‘vette, over the local roads of Monmouth County, the darkness and 
shadows of the highway at night was where I lived. I was a wandering 
spirit, barely there, looking briefly into the dimly lit homes, where I 
could be living any one of a thousand other lives, filled with family, 
and friends. But I wasn’t. For now, the life I chose was here: the life 
of words, the life of song, the life of these roads, of these evenings. 
This life. And all it gave and all it withheld, was my life.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, though I had many fine girlfriends, as a young man I was not lucky
 at love. I was always sure to choose someone with whom it would never 
work out. I could spot the wrong woman across a crowded dance floor, in a
 packed club, and be certain before I spoke two words, or looked deeply 
into a pair of lovely, unsuspecting eyes, that this was never gonna work
 out. Now, I mean, I didn’t know at the time, I just knew it, in my 
bones or something. Of course I wouldn’t figure it out until two or 
three years into the relationship. But I always suspected I 
instinctively knew it from the top, and I had it perfected to an art, 
one completely fine and decent woman after another, at a mostly 
monogamous two- or three-year interval. I seemed to be incapable of 
choosing any other than women you could not unlock, women whose hearts 
remained passionately untouchable, who remained a mystery, even unto 
themselves. The unknown soul in them always just out of reach. Or maybe 
that was me.”<br>
<br>
<br>
All right, the dance floor is empty. The hour is late. I am behind the 
bar, where I have cashed out, and I have served my last beer. I have 
announced last call. The bar has been cleaned and cleared, with the 
exception of two tequilas, 10 feet down the bar from where you are 
sitting on a corner stool, nursing your last drink. And I am 10 feet on 
the other side of those two tequilas, not watching the band. Now, in a 
perfect world, we could meet at these two tequilas. Bottom’s up, glasses
 empty, then let’s you and I find something slow and fill that dance 
floor. On the way to the dance floor, my elbow brushes your elbow 
gently, my arm slips around your waist, feeling your ribs beneath my 
right hand. My left hand slips around your wrist and our fingers 
intertwine, as your arm slowly settles into the middle of my back, with 
your chin at the top of my chest. And then, your head rests ever so 
lightly on my shoulder.”<br>
<br>
<br>
“Now the bar is cleared out, the dance floor is empty, leaving just you 
and I. I head to the back bar, into the manager’s office. I grab my 
jacket. I hit the main light switch. And when I come out, you’re sitting
 in the shadows of the back bar. Now just 50 feet from our dance floor 
is a side exit. And just 20 feet from that side exit, sitting at the 
curb, is a ’69 Super Sport, your magic chariot. Climb on in. 
Destination: Unknown.”<br>
<br>
Oh, I was persona non grata at my first real girlfriend’s house. It was 
1965. Maybe it was the hair, my cultivated look of dishevelment, but 
whatever it was, I was marked as an undesirable by my perfect 
girlfriend’s mother. Now, I was 15, and my gal was a year younger than 
me, 14. But though a year younger, she had a surprising, burgeoning 
sexuality that showed me up for being as inexperienced as I was at that 
age. But I had one thing goin’ for me. I was forbidden. I was not to be 
had. I was not to be touched. And she had a bit of a closeted rebellious
 streak of her own, so when mom was away, we ventured to mom’s bedroom, 
where she introduced me, for the first time, to what I think was full-on
 sex, though due to the fog of war, 55 years later, I can’t be 
completely sure. All I remember was she was beautiful, with a softness 
and a kindness, cut by a streak of cruelty I should have took more 
notice of.<br>
“Now in the shadows always lurked a major problem to our paradise. You 
see, she was solidly middle class. Perfect plaid skirt, blouse with the 
Peter Pan collar, white socks, long blond tresses. I was a denizen from 
the far side of nowhere, where Blacks intermingled with whites, where a 
man never left his house in a suit unless he was going to church or in 
trouble. Where the firemen, and the truck drivers, and the auto workers 
gathered around each other’s porches on summer nights and passed beers 
and stories of the week around.<br>
“Well, her mother could not help but be disappointed in and disapprove 
of who she thought I was. So the word came down, and she theatrically 
threatened to get a restraining order that would forbid me from seeing 
her perfect daughter. Now, her perfect daughter had plenty of ‘Fuck you,
 mom’ in her, so we began to meet at night, at the Broad Street 
schoolyard. And there, amongst the empty monkey bars and sliding boards 
and swings and seesaws, stood an oak tree that became our rendezvous and
 redemption point. We worked and leaned hard against that oak’s trunk on
 many a summer and fall night, trying to find whatever pleasure and 
satisfaction we could there. She stole time from mama, girlfriends and 
homework, to meet me there, but it was always too short and a little 
painful. But at least she’d come. And we were there together.<br>
“Then one night she didn’t come. Or the next night, either. So I sat on 
the swings with the rest of the ghosts, dragging my feet through stones 
and dirt, until 2 a.m. Then I went home. The revolution was over. 
Whatever use I had been, I was needed no longer. I had engaged the enemy
 on the field of the battle of love and I had been defeated. Or maybe 
she just got tired of it all. It became too much of a hassle. Well, I 
finally caught her at her locker in school, one morning, and she tried 
to be kind, but I wouldn’t let her. I wanted to hear her say it was all 
over. So she said it. I went home, and I decided to rid myself of her, 
to relieve my heart of her, to release my mind of the burden of thinking
 of her. It didn’t work. I’d see her in my dreams.”<br>
<br>
<br>
“How do we live beneath the beauty of God’s hand? How do we become 
worthy of the love that he’s made possible for us on Earth? And how do 
we light and carry our own lamp through the darkness? How do we be brave
 in His name and in our love?”</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">How Bruce 
Springsteen confronted death, saw Clarence in his dreams, and knocked 
out a raw and rocking new album with the world’s greatest bar band<br>
<br>
By BRIAN HIATT<br>
ROLLING STONE<br>
SEPTEMBER 20, 2020</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is standing on a gravel driveway outside his house, 
squinting up at the sky. This morning, an early-August thunderstorm 
straight out of one of his own metaphors rumbled through New Jersey’s 
Monmouth County, soaking Asbury Park, buffeting Freehold, leaving muddy 
ground here in the horsey acres of Colts Neck. It’s afternoon now, and 
above Springsteen’s farm, the clouds are scattering, with sunshine 
breaking through. “It ended up being a halfway decent day,” he says, 
with real gratitude. (The more time he spends in semi-isolation here, 
the more he ends up focusing on the weather: “What else is there?”)<br>
<br>
His hair is silver and black, cropped short, and on his still-lean torso
 is a thin white undershirt not unlike the one he wore on the cover of 
Darkness on the Edge of Town, with a low, ribbed neck and a tiny hole on
 the side. On his sockless feet — incredibly! — are a pair of leather 
sandals. He’s in jeans, needless to say, but they’re light blue, in a 
loose carpenter cut. We are six months deep into a global pandemic, and 
even Bruce Springsteen has been working from home for a long while.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen's Raw Energy Makes 'Letter to You' a Song You Need to Know<br>
It is, as always, mildly jarring to be standing next to him, as though 
one of the heads from Mount Rushmore peeled itself off the cliff to hang
 out. When you’ve hardly spoken with anyone else face-to-face for 
months, it’s even odder. I grew up around here, too, so as we head to a 
covered porch, there’s some local small talk — we mourn a mutually 
beloved Carvel store, mentioned in his book, that’s morphed into a 
Dunkin’ Donuts. We settle into wicker chairs, six feet apart, across a 
table of white stone that overlooks a tree-lined field, where leaves are
 swaying in what’s left of the morning’s wind. For a man who’s born to 
run but more or less stuck in place, there are worse spots to be.<br>
<br>
So, how’s he doing? “Hangin’ in there, like everybody else,” Springsteen
 says, sinking further into his chair. “As far as my own plans, you 
know, I think you’re concerned about ever playing again.” (He says this 
lightly enough, and later takes pains to clarify that he’s far more 
concerned about “working musicians who go week to week, and all your 
back-line people in the crew.”) “So that weighs on your mind a little 
bit because, well, it was fun. Some of the uncertainty that the virus 
has brought with it is something everybody’s got to live with. But in 
general, I’m OK.”<br>
<br>
It doesn’t hurt that Springsteen, who has been open about his struggles 
with depression, is still taking meds. “I’m on drugs!” he says later. 
“So my mood is good!”<br>
<br>
On a snowy day last November, just a few yards from where we’re sitting,
 in the light-splashed, blond-wood studio he shares with his wife, Patti
 Scialfa, Springsteen gathered the E Street Band for five days of 
recording. They managed to lay down an entire album. “We were doing a 
song every three hours,” says Steve Van Zandt, who compares the pace to 
the Beatles’ early sessions. “We basically cut the album in four days. 
We booked five days and on the fifth day we had nothin’ to do, so we 
just listened to it.”<br>
<br>
In the studio, they all toasted to the tour they were sure would follow.
 Now, there’s “no touring in sight,” as Springsteen puts it, but Letter 
to You is still coming out October 23rd. There was no point, he decided,
 in holding it back. “When I make music,” he says, “I’m going to put it 
out.”<br>
<br>
Were it not for the intervention of a once-in-a-century global 
catastrophe, Springsteen — who turns 71 on September 23rd — would right 
now be preparing for that world tour with the E Street Band. It was 
supposed to start, he reveals, in the spring of 2021. Instead, he says, 
“My antenna tells me, at best, 2022. And I would consider the concert 
industry lucky if it happens then.… I’m going to consider myself lucky 
if I lose just a year of touring life. Once you hit 70, there’s a finite
 amount of tours and a finite amount of years that you have. And so you 
lose one or two, that’s not so great. Particularly because I feel the 
band is capable of playing at the very, very, very top, or better than, 
of its game right now. And I feel as vital as I’ve ever felt in my 
life.… It’s not being able to do something that is a fundamental life 
force, something I’ve lived for since I was 16 years old.”<br>
 <br>
And livestreamed sets? For a guy who crowd-surfed into his seventh 
decade, who would no doubt leap into any available sweaty mass of 
concertgoers at this very moment if he could, it’s just not the same. He
 did an acoustic set with Scialfa from their studio for a Jersey 
Covid-19 benefit, and jammed remotely with the Dropkick Murphys in May, 
beaming onto a screen in Boston’s Fenway Park. But he found it deeply 
weird to work himself into an approximation of his usual performance 
frenzy for two songs, only to land back in an empty room. “Those are 
some of my favorite guys,” says Springsteen. “It’s always fun. But it 
was very strange to put yourself in a room with a band and then stop. So
 it’s not something I’d want to make a career out of.”<br>
There may be no bringing together the E Street Band right now, a group 
almost big enough to constitute a mass gathering in its own right. But 
Letter to You sounds live enough to make you feel a little guilty 
listening to it, as if you’re violating quarantine. That makes the album
 feel all the more precious, and the lack of a tour all the more 
painful. Letter to You is the first time since Born in the U.S.A. that 
Springsteen and the E Street Band recorded live in the studio to this 
extent, and possibly the rawest album they’ve ever made, with close to 
zero overdubs. “It’s the only album where it’s the entire band playing 
at one time,” says Springsteen, “with all the vocals and everything 
completely live.” (A few of Springsteen’s twangy guitar leads, played on
 a Gretsch, are among the only exceptions.)<br>
<br>
“It was really like the old days,” says drummer Max Weinberg. “Just pure
 musical energy, with the hard-earned musical and professional wisdom of
 guys in their 70s, or close to 70.” It also happens to be the most 
classically, unabashedly E Street-sounding album since at least The 
River. It’s a late-period rebirth of sorts, and it started with thoughts
 of death.<br>
<br>
In the early days of Springsteen’s first real band, an assemblage of 
teenage central-Jersey greasers called the Castiles, there was one 
member marked for success. He had a smooth, pure tenor. He was the 
group’s designated heartthrob. His name was George Theiss, and he 
invited Springsteen into the band as lead guitarist in the first place. 
“We were the only five freaks in Monmouth County,” Theiss once told 
Rolling Stone — though Van Zandt, over in Middletown with his band the 
Shadows, would beg to differ. Theiss and Springsteen were close, often 
walking to high school together, but they clashed as time went on, 
especially as Springsteen began singing more. “They were competing for 
the same spot in the band,” says Diana Theiss, George’s widow. “And 
George was a little threatened.” The Castiles broke up in 1968. In the 
end, one of the band’s singers became Bruce Springsteen, and the other 
did not. Theiss married Diana at age 20, worked as a carpenter, and kept
 playing music in Jersey Shore clubs on the side. While Springsteen 
famously took inspiration for the early marriage he wrote about in “The 
River” from the lives of his own sister and brother-in-law, Diana always
 wondered whether he was also thinking about George.<br>
 <br>
It wasn’t always easy for Theiss to watch his former bandmate leap from 
one unimaginable triumph to another. When Theiss and his wife attended a
 party with a band at Springsteen and Scialfa’s property a few years 
ago, Theiss resisted an invitation to get up and jam. “He just couldn’t 
put himself in that position of being the almost-was kind of guy,” Diana
 recalls. “And that’s not to say our whole life was one big 
disappointment! Of course it wasn’t.” Springsteen understood George’s 
feelings, she adds. “I always felt like Bruce saw his alter ego there — 
‘There but for the grace of God.'”<br>
<br>
“It’s just different paths,” says Springsteen. “I don’t know how to make
 much more sense of it than that.” He and his friend never fully fell 
out of touch, but Springsteen and Theiss reconnected in the past few 
years. When Springsteen learned in July 2018 that Theiss was in the 
final stages of terminal lung cancer, he chartered a plane to North 
Carolina to sit with him just before his passing. The whole way back, 
Diana was told, Springsteen was silent, lost in his thoughts. He was, at
 that point, performing on Broadway five nights a week, talking about 
his past again and again. Springsteen realized he was the last surviving
 member of the Castiles, a revelation he sat with for a while. “You 
can’t think about it,” he says, “without thinking of your own mortality.
 Most of the guys in the band died young for one reason or another, and 
so it really kind of came down to George and myself.”<br>
<br>
Before 2019, Springsteen hadn’t written a song he thought would work for
 the E Street Band “in about six or seven years. I’ve written a lot of 
other kinds of music.” He had a particularly fruitful burst of 
songwriting at the start of the decade, which led to 2012’s Wrecking 
Ball (fiery populist-protest lyrics, experimental-for-Bruce production),
 last year’s belatedly released Western Stars (melodically surprising, 
slyly autobiographical orchestral pop), and a third album that’s “in the
 can,” he says, declining to elaborate. He’s vague about any other 
songwriting last decade, but there also was an acclaimed 500-page 
autobiography; the Tony-winning Springsteen on Broadway; and 2014’s High
 Hopes, a collection of covers and older songs, most written in the 
2000s.<br>
<br>
“You’re down in the mines,” he says, “and you’re searching for different
 veins of creativity. Sometimes you burn through one, so you have to 
search for something else. That vein can burn out for years or weeks at a
 time.… You’re also at the mercy of events.” For Springsteen, few events
 were more life-shaking than the 2011 death of one of his closest 
friends, E Street saxophonist and force of nature Clarence Clemons, 
especially on the heels of the loss of organist Danny Federici in 2008. 
Though Springsteen doesn’t make the connection himself, it’s hard not to
 notice that his E Street songwriting dry spell started around then.<br>
<br>
It took the death of Theiss, a friend he’d known even longer, to push 
him out of it. “We were very close at a very intense period in our 
lives,” says Springsteen. “And I learned almost the entirety of my craft
 in that group.” Springsteen had far more success with a subsequent 
prefame band, the hard-boogieing Steel Mill, who jammed through his 
winding original songs of the era to massive hippie crowds. But the 
Castiles burrowed into the day-to-day lives of their audience. They’d 
cover Sam and Dave, the Beatles, Bo Diddley, Jimi Hendrix — whatever it 
took to set kids in motion in a beach club or church basement or roller 
rink. That was a framework Springsteen would revisit after he scored his
 record deal in 1972. “I still have a deep emotional thread that links 
me with the Castiles,” Springsteen says. “It was a really good local 
band that provided a fundamental service to a local audience. And that 
idea is not that far from the idea that I had of what the E Street Band 
can be — the world’s biggest bar band.”<br>
<br>
Sometime before Theiss’ passing, a fan — from Italy, he thinks — gave 
Springsteen an acoustic guitar at his Broadway stage door. “I said, 
‘Geez, you know, thanks,’ ” Springsteen recalls. “And I just took a 
quick glance at it and it looked like a nice guitar, so I jumped in the 
car with it.” The guitar, made by a company he’s never heard of, sat in 
his living room for months, until Springsteen picked it up around April 
of last year.<br>
<br>
Without warning, “all the songs from the album came out of it,” he says,
 full of wonder. “In perhaps less than 10 days. I just wandered around 
the house in different rooms, and I wrote a song each day. I wrote a 
song in the bedroom. I wrote a song in our bar. I wrote a song in the 
living room.” The first to emerge was the slow-building, elegiac “Last 
Man Standing,” one of the most directly autobiographical songs in 
Springsteen’s catalog, tracing the Castiles’ gigs (“Knights of Columbus 
and the Fireman’s Ball/Friday night at the Union Hall/The black-leather 
clubs all along Route 9”) before jumping to a future scarred by loss: 
“You count the names of the missing as you count off time.”<br>
 <br>
Springsteen had begun to create his first set of songs about what it 
felt like to be in a band. He was also writing about being haunted, not 
unpleasantly, by the dead, most directly on the rousing “Ghosts” (“I 
turn up the volume and let the spirits be my guide/Meet you, brother and
 sister, on the other side,” he howls), the opening ballad, “One Minute 
You’re Here,” and the closing track, “I’ll See You in My Dreams.”<br>
<br>
“The loss of Clarence and Danny still echoes every day in my life,” says
 Springsteen. “I still don’t believe it. I’m like, ‘I’m not gonna see 
Clarence again? That doesn’t sound quite possible!’ I live with the dead
 every day at this point in my life. Whether it’s my father or Clarence 
or Danny, all those people sort of walk alongside you. Their spirit, 
their energy, their echo continues to resonate in the physical world.… A
 beautiful part of living is what we’re left by the dead.”<br>
<br>
And he really does see his friends in his dreams. Terry Magovern, his 
friend and longtime assistant, who died in 2007, stops by “a couple 
times a year.” “I see Clarence every once in a while,” he says. “I’ll 
see the houses I lived in as a child. I’ll walk through their halls. We 
see all those folks in our dreams until we become a dream ourselves.”<br>
<br>
Clarence’s nephew, Jake Clemons, replaced him in the band, and Charlie 
Giordano, an organist with similar musical roots, took over for 
Federici. But the departed are still along for the ride. “It’s a little 
chilling,” says Roy Bittan, E Street’s keyboardist since 1974 and a 
linchpin of the band’s sound. “You’re playing, and I guess you could say
 that the ghosts of Danny and Clarence are there.… We miss them dearly, 
but they’re standing right next to us.”<br>
<br>
<br>
Soon after Springsteen wrote the new songs, he had lunch with Bittan, 
and told him about the material. The musician had one suggestion: “I 
said, ‘Hey, man, y’know, don’t demo anything,’” Bittan recalls. “‘Let’s 
do it the way we used to, which is play us the song and let us record 
it.’ ” It was a perceptive piece of advice, with deep implications for 
the album. It echoed what Van Zandt had been telling Springsteen for 
years.<br>
 <br>
“I knew he was right,” says Springsteen. One of the most pivotal moments
 in his career came in 1981, when he sent a roadie out to buy what 
became his first home-studio setup, a Tascam cassette four-track that 
would end up on display in the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. On 
Nebraska, released the next year, what were meant to be demos for the E 
Street Band became his first real solo album, kicking off an entire 
career apart from the band. 1987’s Tunnel of Love was essentially 
homemade, bedroom pop, and the line between demos and released 
recordings blurred from there — take the one-man sparseness and aching 
solitude of “Streets of Philadelphia.”<br>
<br>
In the 2000s, the echoes of Springsteen’s work with the E Street Band 
were easy to find, as acts from Arcade Fire to the Killers aimed for 
bombast. Lately, though, it’s his solo material that seems more 
influential, from the hermetic churn of the War on Drugs to avowed 
superfan Jack Antonoff’s synth-y production for Taylor Swift, Lorde, and
 Lana Del Rey. (Springsteen played the War on Drugs on his excellent 
radio show, From My Home to Yours, and is fond of Del Rey: “Patti and I 
are both big fans,” he says. “Norman Fucking Rockwell! Just the detail 
of the writing. It’s really novelistic and cinematic and quite lovely.”)<br>
<br>
Springsteen kept making demos even after he resumed recording with the E
 Street Band on The Rising (which, somehow, is now 18 years old, a fact 
Springsteen finds “mind-boggling,” since “that’s one of my new 
albums!”). But last year, he finally saw a reason to stop. “When I demo,
 I start putting things on to see if it works,” says Springsteen. “And 
suddenly, I’m locked into an arrangement. And then the band has to fit 
themselves into an arrangement. And suddenly, we don’t have an E Street 
Band album. So I intentionally did not demo anything.” Bypassing his 
studio, he captured the songs only on his iPhone, in quick solo-acoustic
 renditions, to make sure he remembered them.<br>
<br>
No one was happier about this decision than Van Zandt, who thrived in 
the freewheeling early days, when he could jump in with his formidable 
arranging skills. For Van Zandt, the entire Brendan O’Brien period of 
(oft-superb) E Street albums — The Rising, Magic, and Working on a Dream
 — were “kind of transitional,” with Springsteen slowly moving away from
 thinking of himself as a “solo artist.” “We finally made it back to the
 band sensibility,” says Van Zandt, “where Bruce is comfortable trusting
 the band again, thinking like a band member again.”<br>
 <br>
It only took 37 years, I point out. Van Zandt laughs. “He’s a little slow,” he says. “Let’s call it … deliberate.”<br>
Letter to You is also full of the signature stylistic flourishes that 
Springsteen has largely avoided in the studio for decades: glockenspiel,
 lyrical piano intros, swelling organ chords, Jake’s uncanny evocation 
of Clarence’s call-to-arms solos. At one point in the sessions, 
Springsteen actually told Bittan to play more “E Street.” “It makes me 
chuckle,” says Bittan, “because there were times when he said, ‘Don’t 
play it like E Street!’”<br>
springsteen castiles<br>
<br>
“I wanted to revisit that sound with my current material,” says 
Springsteen. “I think the audience always wants two things — they want 
to feel at home, and they want to be surprised.” As early as 1978’s 
Darkness on the Edge of Town, he was already pushing away from the style
 he’d established on Born to Run. “Your first records, you’re just 
making music,” he says. “Then when you have a hit, you slip into a 
reactionary and self-protective mode. And from that record onward, I 
didn’t have anybody play that fundamental ‘E Street’ style. I didn’t 
want to repeat myself.”<br>
<br>
But at this stage of his career, he’s just not worried anymore. “You’re 
less self-conscious,” he says. “And you’re less rigid. So it’s just 
like, ‘Hey, what would be creative? What would be fun for the fans? What
 would we enjoy doing?’ It’s sort of your own set of rules be damned.”<br>
<br>
In that spirit, he went as far as to lead the band through muscled-up 
rearrangements of three often-bootlegged, never-released songs from 1972
 or 1973. All of them made the album: “Song to Orphans” (a Dylan-derived
 slow-burner that may have captured some of Springsteen’s turn-of-decade
 disenchantment with the dreams of the Sixties), “Janey Needs a Shooter”
 (a lost classic the band rehearsed as late as 1979 in a near-identical 
arrangement, leading Warren Zevon to half-borrow its title for his own 
“Jeannie Needs a Shooter”), and an unexpectedly hard-hitting take on the
 gleefully sacrilegious gem “If I Was the Priest” (covered by Hollies 
singer Allan Clarke in the Seventies). Last year, Springsteen was 
working through his archives for a follow-up to his 1998 outtakes box 
set, Tracks, when he “sort of came across these songs.” There’s no 
particular message in their inclusion. He simply wanted to hear the band
 play them now, he says, “to be able to go back and sing in your adult 
voice but with ideas of your youth.… It was kind of insane fun, because 
the lyrics for all those songs were so completely crazy.”<br>
 <br>
Despite a release close to Election Day, Letter to You is decidedly not 
an album of fiery anti-Trump anthems. “That would be the most boring 
album in the world,” Springsteen says, a wrinkle of annoyance appearing 
between his eyebrows. He took on 9/11 with The Rising and George W. 
Bush’s failures with Magic, but those state-of-the-union reports are 
exceptions. With its focus on poverty, dispossession, and the plight of 
immigrants from Mexico, 1995’s The Ghost of Tom Joad was his most 
prescient album, but he released it in the heart of the Clinton boom 
years.<br>
<br>
The song that seems to most directly address the Trump era on Letter to 
You is a foreboding, rootsy rocker called “Rainmaker,” in which a conman
 offers false hope to drought-stricken farmers. Springsteen acknowledges
 the relevance — “it’s about a demagogue” — but he wrote it a few years 
before Trump took office. “That was sort of the one that stood in for 
the album I didn’t make,” Springsteen says.<br>
<br>
The album’s only actual reference to current events is in one line, a 
glancing reference to a “criminal clown” who “has stolen the throne” in a
 song that otherwise transcends politics, the sweeping anthem “House of a
 Thousand Guitars,” in which Bittan’s E Street-redux piano looms large. 
That song, which paints a beguiling picture of a rock &amp; roll heaven 
on Earth, a place “where the music never ends” and fellowship reigns, a 
destination not far from his “Land of Hope and Dreams,” is important 
enough to Springsteen that he dashes into the house and grabs his 
MacBook so he can listen to it again before we discuss it.<br>
<br>
Once he’s back at the table, he plays the song over the computer 
speakers, eyes shut, head nodding to Weinberg’s beat. “It’s about this 
entire spiritual world that I wanted to build for myself,” he says, “and
 give to my audience and experience with my band. It’s like that gospel 
song ‘I’m Working on a Building.’ That’s the building we’ve been working
 on all these years. It also speaks somewhat to the spiritual life of 
the nation. It may be one of my favorite songs I’ve ever written. It 
draws in everything I’ve been trying to do for the past 50 years.”<br>
 <br>
There’s a reference in there to churches and jails, and I ask if it’s a 
nod to a similar line in “Jungleland.” Springsteen laughs. “That line 
has been tickling my brain since we recorded the record,” he says. “And I
 wasn’t sure where I heard it! You just reminded me where I heard that 
line before.”<br>
Even if it’s not the current focus of his songwriting, Springsteen is 
still willing to dive directly into politics, as his approval of — and 
brief appearance in — a Democratic National Convention video using “The 
Rising” in August made clear. He’s found the past few years to be a 
“very disturbing time.” “Overall, as somebody who was a born populist,” 
he says, “I’ve got a little less faith in my neighbors than I had four 
years ago.”<br>
<br>
Many on the left — including Springsteen’s friend Tom Morello — see 
Trump as more of a symptom of larger problems, I point out. “I’m 
probably not as left as Tom,” says Springsteen. “But look, if we want to
 have the America that we envision, it’s going to need some pretty 
serious systemic changes moving leftward.” As for the leading politician
 on the left: “I like Bernie Sanders a lot,” Springsteen says. “I don’t 
know if he was my main choice, my first choice. I like Elizabeth Warren,
 I like Bernie.” For the moment, though, he is fully on board with the 
centrist Democratic nominee. “The power of the American idea has been 
abandoned,” Springsteen says. “It’s a terrible shame, and we need 
somebody who can bring that to life again.… I think if we get Joe Biden,
 it’s gonna go a long way towards helping us regain our status around 
the world. The country as the shining light of democracy has been 
trashed by the administration. We abandoned friends, we befriended 
dictators, we denied climate science.”<br>
<br>
His review of the Republican convention? “Horrific. Just seeded with 
constant lies and total distortion of the American idea. It’s 
heartbreaking and terrible. The first thing is to get the Trump 
administration out of office and start again.”<br>
<br>
For Springsteen, the Black Lives Matter movement has unearthed truths he
 hadn’t quite grasped, even when he became the rare white rock star to 
take on police violence against black Americans with “American Skin (41 
Shots),” back in 2000. “White supremacy and white privilege have gone 
much deeper than I thought they did,” he says. “I think my feeling 
previously to the past three or four years was that racism and white 
supremacy and white privilege were veins in our extremities, rather than
 an aorta that cuts through the very heart of the nation, which I feel 
it is now. So that was eye-opening, whether I was previously stupidly 
innocent to that or not.”<br>
 <br>
He’s proud that his 30-year-old son, Evan, has been marching in New York
 City. “There’s not going to be any post-racial society,” Springsteen 
says. “That’s never gonna happen. But I think that a society where 
people really see one another as full men and women, as Americans, is 
possible. It’s a movement of tremendous hope, and it’s a tremendously 
diverse group of young people that are out on the street. And it’s a 
movement that history is demanding right now.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen flips through a blue, spiral-bound notebook, looking for 
some writing he’s been doing about Clarence Clemons and BLM. He finds a 
page with the letter “C” on top. Part of his audience’s outsize reaction
 to his and Clemons’ stage antics and palpable brotherhood, he thinks, 
is that they were seeing “an America they would like to imagine existed.
 And I think that was not completely unintentional. Our idea was, we 
wanted to present to our audience a musical version of John Lewis’ 
‘beloved community.’” The late congressman and civil rights leader often
 referenced that phrase of Martin Luther King Jr.’s, which Lewis 
described as “a society based on simple justice that values the dignity 
and the worth of every human being.”<br>
Springsteen knows it wasn’t always easy for Clemons, who only briefly 
experienced life in a half-white, half-black version of the E Street 
Band, the one that recorded the title track “Born to Run.” The black 
members encountered racism on the road, but racial tensions weren’t an 
issue within the group, drummer Ernest “Boom” Carter once told me: “None
 of that shit ever came into the band. The only time I had problems was 
outside the band.” When Carter and David Sancious left together in 1974 
to start a jazz-fusion group, Clemons was, from then on, the only black 
member of a white band, often playing to all-white audiences. “We were 
too close,” says Springsteen, “to pretend that race wasn’t an issue.” 
(Clemons told author Peter Ames Carlin that he was overjoyed to finally 
perform for a sea of black faces at the E Street Band’s first show in 
Africa, in 1988: “It was the first time I ever saw more than one black 
person at Bruce’s concerts.… I was like, ‘Wow! Purple trees and no white
 people! This must be heaven!’”)<br>
 <br>
In the old days, Springsteen would, pretty frequently, give Clemons a 
lingering kiss right on the lips onstage, sometimes sliding all the way 
across the stage to meet his welcoming arms. For years, this gesture 
sparked cultural-studies theorizing — queer overtones, racial 
subversion, etc. — and lately, it’s been inspiring social media photo 
collages from young music fans charmed by the thought of the seemingly 
super-straightest of rock stars challenging the squarer elements of his 
audience. When I bring all this up to Springsteen, he’s as amused as he 
is dumbfounded. “You’re kidding,” he says. “I gotta be honest with you. I
 never thought about it. I can honestly tell you, I never felt 
self-conscious about it or gave it any thought. We were just close.”<br>
Later, he adds: “We’re talking about one of the deepest relationships of
 my life. I can’t reduce it to an intellectual exercise. I can’t reduce 
it to a capsule sociological explanation, of 45 years of work and love 
between me and one of my dearest friends.”<br>
<br>
There is, from some angles, an unnerving sense of finality around Letter
 to You. The cover photo shows Springsteen in a wintry landscape, while 
the title track, he acknowledges, is a sort of summation of his artistic
 output: It was all a letter he sent out to the world, where he “tried 
to summon all that my heart finds true.” Even unearthing the three 
Seventies songs has a full-circle feel to it, as much as Springsteen may
 insist otherwise.<br>
<br>
Could this be the last E Street Band album? “I think what he has come to
 realize is, it could be,” says Van Zandt. “Confronting one’s mortality 
is both truthful and realistic, and it can assist people who are in that
 frame of mind — who may be leaving, or who had someone pass right now 
that they love. And by the time this comes out, it could be 200,000 of 
us. It could be cathartic for those people. It could also be literal. At
 this point, if you have something to say, you better say it now! Don’t 
wait too much longer! Because who knows? I don’t think he meant it 
literally. And if it is the last album, y’know, we went out swinging. 
And if it’s not, we’re gonna have to come back, and we’re gonna have to 
beat it!”<br>
 <br>
Springsteen acknowledges that “no tomorrows are guaranteed,” but that’s 
as far as he’ll go on the subject. And it’s probably worth noting that 
the chorus of “Ghosts” finds him practically screaming, “I’m alive!” “I 
plan,” says Springsteen, “to have a long road in front of me.… Some of 
my recent projects have been kind of summational, but really, for me, 
it’s summational for this stage of my work life. I’ve got a lot left to 
do, and I plan to carry on.”<br>
<br>
He’s got “a lot of projects” in the works, including all of that work on
 his archives, which include various full “lost albums” along with more 
scattered outtakes. (Weinberg, for one, has been in the studio to 
overdub at least 40 old songs “in all different styles” over the past 
three years. “Any other artist would kill to get these songs,” the 
drummer says.) Some of these songs will appear on a second volume of 
Tracks, some perhaps in other formats. “There’s a lot of really good 
music left,” Springsteen says, noting that he enjoys collaborating with 
his former selves. “You just go back there. It’s not that hard. If I 
pull out something from 1980, or 1985, or 1970, it’s amazing how you can
 slip into that voice. It’s just sort of a headspace. All of those 
voices remain available to me, if I want to go to them.”<br>
<br>
It’s been a long afternoon, and Springsteen starts to walk me to my car —
 trailed by two dogs, a German shepherd named Dusty (Dusty Springsteen!)
 and a small apparent terrier named Toast — before calling an audible. 
We head into the studio, where Ron Aniello, his producer since Wrecking 
Ball, and engineer Rob Lebret are at work at whatever the day’s mystery 
project might be. On a music stand sits a piece of paper listing a set 
of chords, with an unfamiliar song title on top. “This,” says 
Springsteen, gesturing at the instruments overflowing from every corner,
 “is the house of a thousand guitars.” He also shows off the adjoining 
garage, stuffed with motorcycles and vintage cars, including the 
Corvette from the cover of his autobiography, which one of his sons 
recently rebuilt to look precisely as it does in the photo.<br>
 <br>
He asks Aniello to break out a bottle of ice-cold Cuervo, and we sit 
down in front of a flatscreen to take in Thom Zimny’s movie of the 
Letters to You sessions. His longtime documentarian was there to capture
 every moment of recording, in evocative black and white, right where 
we’re sitting. (“There were, like, 20 cameramen there,” Weinberg 
recalls.) Springsteen’s plan is to show only 10 minutes or so of the 
movie, which will be out to accompany the album.<br>
<br>
Instead, we end up watching the whole thing, for an hour and a half, 
with Springsteen periodically grabbing a remote control to crank the 
volume to MetLife Stadium levels. He pours himself a bit more tequila as
 the film goes on, laughing at the jokes, maybe singing along 
occasionally. It’s just another afternoon in Jersey, watching Bruce 
Springsteen watch Bruce Springsteen record an album with the E Street 
Band.<br>
Before the film starts, Springsteen pours glasses for me and Aniello and
 offers a toast. “To rock &amp; roll,” he says, pausing for a long beat 
before the punchline: “What’s left of it.” He laughs, and we all drink.</div>

THE NEW YORK TIMES<br>
OCTOBER 18, 2020</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">By Lindsay Zoladz</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Every music fan with blood burning in their veins has felt the sting of 
missing live shows since March, but the pain has been particularly acute
 for Bruce Springsteen, an artist who’s spent the past six decades 
onstage, yet says he’s just now hitting his stride.<br>
<br>
“I’m at a point in my playing life and artistic life where I’ve never 
felt as vital,” he said on a Zoom call from his New Jersey home. “My 
band is at its best, and we have so much accumulated knowledge and craft
 about what we do that this was a time in my life where I said, ‘I want 
to use that as much as I can.’”<br>
<br>
Springsteen, 71, was stationed in a small, utilitarian home office with 
primary-color file folders hanging on the wall in place of flashier 
décor, to discuss “Letter to You,” his first record with the E Street 
Band in six years, and an Apple Plus film of the same name that captures
 the kinetic experience of recording it last November.<br>
<br>
“Letter to You” often harks back to a time much earlier than that, 
though: The elegiac rocker “Last Man Standing” is an ode to the band 
Springsteen joined as a teenager, the Castiles (and a meditation on the 
fact that, after the death of his friend George Theiss in 2018, 
Springsteen became the only surviving member). And three of the album’s 
songs originated almost 50 years ago, when Springsteen was an unknown, 
writing florid, Dylan-esque ballads.<br>
<br>
“The record is the first record that I’ve made where the subject is the 
music itself,” he said. “It’s about popular music. It’s about being in a
 rock band, over the course of time. And it’s also a direct conversation
 between me and my fans, at a level that I think they’ve come to expect 
over the years.”<br>
<br>
The closest Springsteen has come to picking up a quarantine hobby (“I’m 
not a big hobby guy”) has been hosting a Sirius XM radio show, “From My 
Home to Yours,” a project he’s thrown himself into with palpable gusto. 
He ran to get his laptop to giddily read off a list of artists whose 
music has been exciting him recently: J.S. Ondara, Mondo Cozmo, H.E.R., 
Orville Peck, Larkin Poe and Bon Iver, to name a few. (He said he hasn’t
 yet listened to Taylor Swift’s “Folklore,” but “all I’ve heard is good 
things about it.”)<br>
<br>
Having the time to listen is, at least, one upside of being stuck in 
place. “I’ve been really enjoying sort of being deeply back into music,”
 Springsteen said, “almost like I was when I was a kid. I was always in 
the record store, looking for the next thing.”<br>
<br>
These are edited excerpts from the conversation.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Like everyone else, this year hasn’t exactly gone how you’d expected. You’re putting out a record that you can’t yet tour.</em><br>
<br>
Oh, yeah. I think there’s going to be a process before people are 
comfortable rubbing up against one another again. But if somebody told 
me, “That’s never going to happen again” — that would be a big life 
change for me. That act of playing has been one of the only consistent 
things in my life since I was 16 years old. I’ve depended a lot on it 
not just for my livelihood, but for my emotional well-being. So if 
somebody said, “Five years from now, maybe” — that’s a long time. 
Particularly at my age. I’m 71, and I’m thinking, “Well I know one 
thing. I’m in the mood right now to burn the house down for as long as I
 can.”<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">I take it you saw the people playing “Born in 
the U.S.A.” outside Walter Reed when President Trump was there earlier 
this month. How did that make you feel? Decades after Reagan, people 
still seem to be misunderstanding that song.</em><br>
<br>
That is my lot in life. [Laughs] That is my lot in life and I have 
learned to live with it with a smile. I mean, I do believe that as much 
as it is the writer’s job to write well, it is the listener’s job to 
listen well. And yet still, on occasion, I’m going to hear something 
like that. I still believe it’s one of my best songs, and when we play 
it, it just has a cumulative power that remains with it. The pride that 
people feel as a part of that music is true. But to understand that 
piece of music you need to do what adults are capable of doing, which is
 to hold two contradictory ideas of one thing in your mind at one time. 
How something can be prideful and at the same time call to account the 
nation that you’re writing about. That was just a part of that piece of 
music. It’s a song that’s not necessarily what it appears to be.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">You got the band back together for “Letter to You.” At what point did you realize it needed to be an E Street Band record?</em><br>
<br>
I knew I wanted to make a record with the band, and I knew I wanted it 
to be the pure instrumentation of the band: two keyboards, the guitars, 
the bass, drums and saxophone, and I didn’t want anything else. I didn’t
 want to demo or have preconceptions of the music, so I didn’t touch the
 songs until I taught them to the band. My blueprint for what I was 
doing was basically the two songs that we’d done in the past that were 
cut completely live, “Darkness on the Edge of Town” and “Born in the 
U.S.A.,” which is like two takes. So we cut about a song every three 
hours, we did two a day, and we were done in four days. And on the fifth
 day, we rested.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Recording wasn’t always that easy for you.</em><br>
<br>
Oh, no, recording used to be hell on earth. I spent years making records
 sometimes. Even “Western Stars” took a long time. It was not a painful 
process, but it was a lengthy process.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Aside from the new material, there are three 
songs on this album that you wrote in the early 1970s. What made you 
return to them?</em><br>
<br>
I had been working on a box set of music from our vault, so I came 
across a bunch of those songs that I had recorded for John Hammond, the 
previous vice president of Columbia Records who discovered me and got me
 signed. I had done a demo for him in 1972 when I was 22, and these 
songs were on it, and they were songs I’d written previous to my first 
record. So I happened to come into contact with that music, and there 
were a couple of others that I thought might be fun for the band to 
play. It’s fun to go back and see how wild my lyric writing was, and how
 uninhibited it was at a certain moment, and to be able to take that and
 bring it into the present with the band, and sing it in my voice right 
now, was a bit of a joy ride. The thing about those songs, every line is
 insane! And somehow they end up making sense about something. I’m not 
sure how I did it at the time.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">I hear you grappling a lot with spirituality on this record, especially in a song like “The Power of Prayer.”</em><br>
<br>
As I’ve gotten older, I’ve kind of become a spiritual songwriter just by
 nature, by the things I’ve grown interested in. At the end of the day 
I’m writing about my own spiritual life, and I’m addressing yours. We 
make a lot of music that addresses the soul, that’s the nature of our 
band. Whether I heard, as I say on the record, Ben E. King’s voice, or 
the Drifters, some of the otherworldly doo-wop of the early ’60s — I 
just find a great essence of spirit in them. It was something that I 
wanted to communicate when I wrote my own music. It’s not sort of 
dogmatic or overblown, there’s no religion in it. There’s just spirit, I
 hope.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Between your book, the Broadway show, and now 
the “Letter to You” film and some of the reflections on this album, I 
get the sense that you’re starting to think about your legacy.</em><br>
<br>
Legacy was on my mind when I was like, a kid. The older you get, the 
more you realize — who the [expletive] knows! [Laughs] Who knows what’s 
going to last and not last. John Sayles, a director friend of mine, 
said, “I make my movies for right now. I make them for the audience 
that’s going to come and see them right now and take them into their 
lives.” Because nobody knows what’s going to happen tomorrow. And I’ve 
sort of taken that as my mantra the past 20 or 25 years, that my records
 are for today. They’re for what they’ll do for you right now and that’s
 where I find the joy in them, and the joy in my audience.<br>
<br>
I think the projects that I’ve done that were summational in a sense — 
the book was, the Broadway show was, even this film — it’s sort of just 
stopping for a moment and taking stock of what you’ve done and where you
 are at a critical point in your life, which I think, once you hit 70, 
you’re there. But I look at it as, that’s what I’ve done up to this 
piece of my work. I still see vital work ahead.<br>
<br>
I just try to find a vein of present energy in what I’m doing and in the
 language that I’ve learned to make my music both current and relevant 
at this point on. I think if you keep the inner spirit of what you’re 
doing alive you remain relevant. I remember playing behind Roy Orbison 
in 1988, I was surprised at how incredibly present and current his music
 felt, and it was all because that was the way he was singing it. I 
realized, it was not old to Roy. It was not nostalgia to him. It was as 
alive in his heart and in his spirit in 1988 as it was in 1960.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">It’s interesting that you made a record and a 
film that are in some ways both about the primacy of playing live music 
at a time when we can’t really experience that, and maybe we feel an 
extra sense of yearning for it.</em><br>
<br>
I grew up in a golden age for rock bands. Back in 1967, if the beach 
club wanted to hire a band, they had to hire teenagers. And so you 
played the Elks Club, the firemen’s fairs, high schools, bowling alleys,
 pizza parlors; you played every place where they could move chairs and 
create a dance floor on Saturday night. And you played hundreds of those
 shows. I really benefited from growing up during that particular period
 of time. It’s still evident in the ability that the band has to play 
live. The level of craft that we bring to live shows is a result of 
playing a thousand nights before I signed a record contract. When I see 
young bands, I tell them, you’ve got to learn how to play live. It’s 
still important, and it’s an experience that cannot yet be simulated.</div>

REVIEW MAR. 9, 2021<br>
The Obama-Springsteen Libcast Is One Long Dialogue That Can Only Say So Much<br>
By Craig Jenkins<br>
</strong><br>
Still, it’s intriguing to hear men who believe in the country as much as these two do recalling moments that shook their faith. <br>
<br>
When Bruce Springsteen met Barack Obama on the latter’s 2008 campaign 
trail, the two became fast friends. They may observe the American 
disorder through different lenses, but they still seem to have drawn 
some of the same conclusions; they’re evangelists of the kind of modern 
liberalism best explained by the famous Dr. King quote about the arc of 
history bending toward justice. Now we can hear Springsteen and Obama 
explore this worldview in the new Spotify podcast Renegades: Born in the
 USA, a series of conversations between the rock star and the politician
 about the commonalities and differences in their backgrounds.<br>
<br>
In its more profound moments, Renegades offers a patchwork history of 
the United States, from the Cold War to the current culture war. 
However, it also inherits its hosts’ blind spots along with their 
admirable convictions and intelligence. Their journeys have been unique,
 but they seem to converge in a shared ideological space — that of the 
unshakably upbeat establishment Democrat, who bolsters morale by 
pointing out how far we’ve come, no matter how disconcerting the last 
decade of social discord, wealth and power disparities, and natural 
disasters has been.<br>
<br>
<br>
Both Obama and Springsteen make intriguing podcast hosts, as public 
figures whose way with words is a function of meticulous craft: Bruce as
 a songwriter and Barack as a speaker, one known as much for the insight
 and optimism of his words as for the pregnant pauses between them. The 
podcast medium usually tends to favor deliberate, intentional essays and
 reporting or fast-paced dialogue. Renegades doesn’t quite fit either 
category. It unfolds like a series of porchfront chats between old 
friends; these conversations feel winding and loose, sometimes almost 
too loose.<br>
<br>
The aim — as expressed by the former president in the first episode, 
“Outsiders: An Unlikely Friendship” — is to pave a path out of the 
cultural and political entrenchment of the last five years through an 
appreciation of the vastness of the American experience. There’s a 
general theme to each of the eight episodes, which play out as a series 
of philosophical conversations around overarching ideas about America. 
Between Bruce’s Irish Catholic upbringing in Jersey’s predominantly 
white Monmouth County — close enough to commute to New York City but far
 enough away to seem authentically suburban — and Barack’s early years 
as a biracial child in Hawaii a decade later, you get a picture of 
disparate, intersecting Americas. Where one story ends, the other 
begins.<br>
<br>
It makes for a fascinating way to approach matters like race. Bruce can 
talk about what it was like to see his Black friends in Freehold’s 
integrated school system in the ’60s, frustrated and hesitant to talk to
 white people amid racial tensions. Barack can talk about what it feels 
like to be on the receiving end of those tensions; he recounts how he 
taught a buddy what mainland slurs not to use, with a fist to the guy’s 
nose.<br>
<br>
Also connecting both dreamers is the idea that things could and should 
be better, but that they won’t get there without incredible effort. In 
an early episode, Obama spells out his guiding ethos: “I believe in the 
upward, forward trajectory of humankind, but I do not believe that it is
 a straight and steady line.” Later on, Bruce confirms what we have 
gleaned about his perspective from songs where ambition drives lovers on
 quests of self-discovery: that he thinks “part of the essential aspect 
of being an American is getting out of where you are.” The two agree 
that the road is one of the best ways to experience both the sheer size 
of the country and the surprising similarities bridging far-flung 
communities, a sense of scope that has informed both men’s work.<br>
<br>
As paragons of liberal hopefulness, Barack and Bruce speak candidly 
about America’s problems — and stop short of suggesting that America 
itself is the problem. You want to hear them discuss why the divisions 
of the ’60s have evolved into new and upsetting manifestations in every 
decade since, how so many Americans have come back around to embrace the
 overt, torch-carrying racism their predecessors fought hard to chase 
out of the public discourse. But they often breeze by these complexities
 like scenery during a road trip. Still, it’s intriguing to hear men who
 believe in the country as much as these two do recalling moments that 
shook their faith. Obama lists the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary-school 
shooting as a low point in his career and a stark reminder of the limits
 to the power of a president: “The closest I ever came to losing hope 
about this country was probably after efforts for modest gun-safety laws
 were defeated … after 20 children had been slaughtered.” He remembers 
struggling to find words when asked to speak at the funeral of Reverend 
Clementa Pinckney, who was killed by Dylann Roof during the Charleston 
church massacre in 2015, explaining his decision to sing “Amazing Grace”
 at the service to address a point about the power of music to move 
people.<br>
<br>
Elsewhere, Bruce talks about running a racially integrated band and 
learning about the unknowable emotional cost that his late friend and 
saxophonist Clarence Clemons shouldered along the way. He revisits 
“American Skin (41 Shots),” the song he wrote about the 1999 police 
shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed Guinean immigrant shot at 41 times
 by plainclothes NYPD officers who claimed they mistook Diallo’s wallet 
for a gun (the officers were eventually acquitted). It also seems to 
reveal something about Springsteen’s politics that he would be surprised
 to hear of police officers being angry about the song. (This seems 
especially notable in the aftermath of his recent arrest on reckless 
driving charges, which happened after a cop saw him take a shot of 
tequila with fans before getting on his motorcycle. Some smoke never 
settles.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Renegades suffers from a pacing issue; there’s an almost unusual amount 
of dead air here. Sometimes it scans as two people comfortable enough 
with each other to relish the silence. Sometimes you’ll find yourself 
checking to see if you’ve dropped WiFi. This is truer to the experience 
of listening to elders speak, though, than the lilting ASMR typical in 
the podcast sphere: It invites you to listen closer, to tune your 
thinking down to a different speed, and consider simpler, though perhaps
 not brighter, days. As it moves through different moments in time and 
ping-pongs between opposite but complementary perspectives, you start to
 grasp the show’s vision of America as a society on the brink of 
breakthrough — where we could all progress if our most virulent 
nativist, exclusionary contingent could get over its hang-ups.<br>
<br>
This is, of course, rose-colored idealism. Nationalists and xenophobes 
choose their stances, choose to shut people out, and that position is 
not necessarily fueled by simple ignorance about conditions on the other
 side of town. It might serve a sunny outlook to suggest that America is
 only zigging a bit on the way to the zag. But the country’s hunger for 
bogeymen and scapegoats is as central to its character as purple 
mountains’ majesty. Whenever Renegades touches this horror, it retreats 
into the boundless positivity of the duo that gave us “Born to Run,” The
 Audacity of Hope, “The Promised Land,” “A More Perfect Union,” and 
“Land of Hope and Dreams.”<br>
<br>
But that’s why we come to these two, right? For hope. This podcast isn’t
 trying to change the country or offer solutions. Its only intention is 
to use our distance from the worst points in our past as motivation to 
keep pushing, and to model a way of celebrating our differences at a 
time where that seems increasingly difficult. To that end, at least, 
Renegades is hearty comfort food.</div>

<br>
And in his excited way of speaking I heard again the voices of old 
companions and brothers under the bridge, among the motorcycles, along 
the wash-lined neighborhood and drowsy doorsteps of afternoon where boys
 played guitars while their older brothers worked in the mills. All my 
other current friends were “intellectuals.” …But Dean’s intelligence was
 every bit as formal and shining and complete…And his “criminality” was 
not something that sulked and sneered; it was a wild yea-saying 
overburst of American joy…long prophesied, long a-coming (he only stole 
cars for joy rides).<br>
<br>
-Jack Kerouac, of Neal Cassady<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen reaches his stride at a time when the listening 
audience is not only desperate for a new idol but unprecedentedly 
suspicious of all pretenders to the throne. We have no idea what the 
Next Big Thing will be, but we’re pretty certain what it isn’t - and one
 thing it certainly isn’t is Another Bob Dylan. So here’s this kid 
Springsteen, coming on like a customized wordslinger in a black leather 
jacket, his mother’s own favorite Francois Villon. And as if we weren’t 
suspicious enough already of all run-on rhapsodic juvenile delinquents, 
we have another cabal of rock critics (including one who later went on 
to become his producer) making extravagant claims for him, backed up by 
one of the biggest hypes in recent memory. Out here in the Midwest, 
where at this writing Springsteen has not even toured yet, you can smell
 the backlash crisp as burnt rubber in the air.<br>
<br>
Springsteen can withstand the reactions, though, because once they hear 
this album even they are gonna be ready to ride out all cynicism with 
him. Because, street-punk image, bardic posture and all, Bruce 
Springsteen is an American archetype, and Born to Run will probably be 
the finest record released this year.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is not an innovator - his outlook is rooted in the Fifties; 
his music comes out of folk-rock and early rock'n'roll, his lyrics from 
1950s teenage rebellion movies and beat poetry as filtered through 
Sixties songs rather than read. Springsteen’s gifts lie in the way he 
has rethought traditional sounds and stances, coming up with a synthesis
 fresh enough to constitute a minor renaissance. After all, what’s more 
old-fashioned than the avant-garde?<br>
<br>
When his first album was released, many of us dismissed it: he wrote 
like Bob Dylan and Van Morrison, sang like Van Morrison and Robbie 
Robertson, and led a band that sounded like Van Morrison’s. We were too 
hasty, of course, but I still don’t think Springsteen’s true voice began
 to emerge until this album, and a friend’s criticisms still nag: “When I
 listen to Bruce Springsteen, I hear a romanticization of New York. When
 I listen to Lou Reed, I hear New York.”<br>
<br>
Maybe so, but maybe that’s precisely the point. Springsteen’s landscapes
 of urban desolation are all heightened, on fire, alive. His characters 
act in symbolic gestures, bigger than life. Furthermore, there’s 
absolutely nothing in his music that’s null, detached, or perverse and 
even his occasional world-weariness carries a redemptive sense of lost 
battles passionately fought. Boredom appears to be a foreign concept to 
him - he reminds us what it’s like to love rock'n'roll like you just 
discovered it, and then seize it and make it your own with certainty and
 precision.<br>
<br>
If I seem to OD on superlatives, it’s only because Born to Run demands 
them; the music races in a flurry of Dylan and Morrison and Phil Spector
 and a little of both Lou Reed and Roy Orbison, luxuriating in them and 
an American moment caught at last, again, and bursting with pride.<br>
<br>
If Springsteen’s music is calculated, it’s to extract the most emotional
 mileage out of relatively sparse instrumentation - rich without being 
messy, the solos are succinct, built for speed, providing a perfect 
counterpoint to the headlong surge of the lyrics. Particularly 
intelligent use is made of keyboards and instruments like the 
glockenspiel which contribute mightily to the Spectorish feel. And 
Clarence Clemons’ sax solos, like Andy Mackay’s in Roxy Music, 
demonstrate that in terms of sheer galloping exuberance, Johnny and the 
Hurricanes are just as valid an influence as John Coltrane.<br>
<br>
The playing is clean but the mix is keyed to a lightly distorted throb 
in which Springsteen’s voice is almost buried. When you do get to the 
words, you discover that they have been tightened up from his first two 
albums; no longer cramming as many syllables as possible into every 
line, he is sometimes almost economical, and the album resonates with 
breathtaking flashes like:<br>
<br>
The amusement park rises bold and stark<br>
Kids are huddled on the beach in the mist<br>
I wanna die with you Wendy on the streets tonight…<br>
<br>
It could almost be a concept album, from the opening “Thunder Road,” 
where Springsteen grabs his girl and hits the highway in his car, 
“riding out tonight to case the promised land,” to the melded metaphors 
of “Jungleland”:<br>
<br>
Kids flash guitars just like switchblades<br>
Hustling for the record machine<br>
The hungry and the hunted…<br>
<br>
Through all of these songs Springsteen’s characters “sweat it out in the
 streets of a runaway American dream,” skating for a longshot in 
automobiles and beds with the omnipresent roar of the radio station 
driving them on to connect anew, as even in the failure of their 
striving they are redeemed by Springsteen’s vision: “Tramps like us - 
baby, we were born to run.”<br>
<br>
In a time of squalor and belittled desire, Springsteen’s music is 
majestic and passionate with no apologies. He is so romantic, in fact, 
that he might do well to watch himself as he comes off this crest and 
settles into success - his imagery is already ripe, and if he succumbs 
to sentiment or sheer grandiosity it could well go rotten. For now, 
though, we can soar with him, enjoying the heady rush of another gifted 
urchin cruising at the peak of his powers and feeling his oats as he 
gets it right, that chord, and the last word ever on a hoodlum’s 
nirvana.</div>

<br>
Robert Christgou<br>
October 29, 2016<br>
<br>
The Realest Thing You've Ever Seen</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
So what else was he going to call it, asked one reviewer of the big new 
Bruce Springsteen autobiography, Born to Run. "Born to Run," as you may 
know, was the title song of the 1975 album that put Springsteen on the 
covers of Time and Newsweek, whence he became the free-wheeling, 
hard-touring American hero we know today. But as often happens with this
 man of the people, the song is trickier than it appears--the lyric more
 about feeling trapped than breaking free, the music an exhilarating up 
that's all about escape. You could say it's too grand--Springsteen cites
 rebel-rousing guitar twanger Duane Eddy, operatic rockabilly Roy 
Orbison, and convicted megalomaniac Phil Spector as inspirations. But 
its grandeur is subsumed by the layered momentum of 85mph drums, 
blood-rousing piano, and tinkling glockenspiel. Is it true, as 
Springsteen feverishly declares, that he and Wendy plan to die together 
in their "suicide machines"? Only metaphorically, the music insists. 
They were born to run again--and then again.<br>
<br>
Of course, Springsteen could have chosen a parallel title more in 
keeping with his grandiose side: Born in the U.S.A., after the title 
song of the 1984 album he went deca-platinum on, which framed a dark 
antiwar lyric inside a solemn, deceptively martial groove. Although soon
 misprised by Ronald Reagan and lesser liars, it became the Ur-source 
all the Springsteen books whose titles sport phrases like "American 
poet," "American song," "American soul," and the inevitable "American 
dream." Yet Springsteen still called his autobio Born to Run, and 
properly so--he's not really a pretentious guy, and anyway, the title 
serves to emphasize a running metaphor. More times than I had the wit to
 count, he feels compelled to get on his motorcycle or in his car and 
race around this U.S.A. he was born in, often for days or even weeks at a
 time. Then he comes home, generally in a better mood. After 30-plus 
years of psychotherapy, he's still running.<br>
<br>
That's right, psychotherapy. By now even his most ardent fans have 
figured out that their hero isn't just a fun-loving bundle of energy 
fronting three-hour concerts that exhilarate you for your money, and in 
2012, David Remnick honored his complexity with a massive New Yorker 
profile in which therapy played a crucial role. But Born to Run doubles 
down on the gambit. It reads like it was written by an analysand--he 
thanks his shrink by name, in the text rather than the 
acknowledgments--and that's good. This is someone who's thought a lot 
about his upbringing, and not just the brooding father sitting in the 
dark kitchen with his six-pack and smokes who was a fixture of his stage
 patter from the beginning.<br>
<br>
Far more incisive than any biographer's version, Springsteen's account 
of his early years--say pre-Beatlemania, which hit when he was 14--lasts
 over 50 pages. Although his parents both worked, his mother steadily as
 a legal secretary and his father usually as whatever he could get, to 
call the Springsteens lower-middle-class would be pushing it: when he 
was young, a single kerosene stove provided all the heat in the house. 
Yet his mother came from money even if it was damaged money--her 
thrice-married father was a lawyer who did three years in Sing Sing for 
embezzlement and held court thereafter in a proverbial house on the 
hill. But it's even more striking that his paternal grandmother was 
young Bruce's primary caregiver, indulging him so unstintingly that he 
refused to live with his parents even when he reached school age, 
sleeping down the block in his grandmother's bed with his grandfather 
exiled to a cot across the room. "It was a place where I felt an 
ultimate security, full license and a horrible unforgettable 
boundary-less love. It ruined me and it made me."<br>
<br>
There are no typical childhoods anyway, but this part of the book, which
 I wish was even longer, cracks through the working-class/South Jersey 
typology that has long encrusted Springsteen's myth. It's weird. And 
it's written. Put aside your literary preconceptions and taste the two 
sentences I just quoted. They're a mite awkward, the three commaless 
adjectives barely in control. But they make a big point loud and clear. 
Autobiographer Springsteen doesn't command the brash fuck-you eloquence 
of rock memoirists Bob Dylan, Patti Smith, and Richard Hell, each quite 
distinct yet all of a piece in their aesthetic verve and acuity. He's 
cornier. But there's a life to his prose that such high-IQ rock 
autobiographers as Pete Townshend and Bob Mould don't come near, a life 
redolent of the colloquial concentration and thematic sweep of his 
songwriting. Sure he bloviates sometimes. But the book moves and carries
 you along.<br>
<br>
In Remnick's profile, Springsteen's manager-for-life, intellectual 
mentor, and dear friend Jon Landau (who as the world's wealthiest former
 rock critic could have supported more pages, though he gets his share) 
calls Springsteen "the smartest person I've ever known." Intimates could
 probably say the same of Dylan, Smith, Hell, for that matter Townshend 
and Mould. But never think Springsteen has less brain power than these 
art heroes. Insofar as his book is corny, that's a conscious aesthetic 
choice he's made for the entirety of his career. It's just that as he's 
matured he's gotten more conscious about it--and even smarter. Sure he's
 all about Jersey, as he should be. But his first Jersey was the 
late-'60s one, where a hospital in Neptune refused to treat the head 
injury of a long-haired teen named Bruce who came in after a serious 
motorcycle accident--there are outsiders everywhere, and the longhair 
gravitated to them and knows he owes them. Moreover, he tenders many 
thanks to Greenwich Village--as a human being, because it bristled with 
life-changing alternatives to Jersey's manifold limitations, and as an 
artist, because its poesy-spouting singer-songwriters and bohemian 
esprit lured him far enough away from his home turf to reflect on it 
with perspective.<br>
<br>
Born to Run is a true autobiography, a thorough factual account of the 
author's life until now. But since it's an artist's autobiography, it 
can't do that job of work without telling us stuff about his art. For 
some this might mean the 12 out of 79 chapters whose italicized titles 
match those of albums he deems worthy of individual attention, which I 
found merely useful except as regards his overrated post-9/11 The 
Rising, which indicates that much of it was written pre-attack and then 
retrofitted to the catastrophe New Jersey's poet laureate felt compelled
 to address, where the much sharper 2012 Wrecking Ball was protest music
 from its conception. Others will savor the celebrity gossip that's 
always a selling point of these books--Sinatra knowing a paisan when he 
sees one, or "the GREATEST GARAGE BAND IN THE WORLD" prepping his 
"Tumbling Dice" cameo at their 2012 Newark show with a single 
five-minute rehearsal space run-through that blows his fanboy mind. But 
for me both were dwarfed by his reflections on persona and performance.<br>
<br>
Never in Born to Run does Springsteen claim the mantle of "authenticity"
 he's forever saddled with. "In the second half of the twentieth 
century, `authenticity' would be what you made of it, a hall of 
mirrors," he says, but also, mirror fans: "Of course I thought I was a 
phony--that is the way of the artist--but I also thought I was the 
realest thing you'd ever seen." And if you'd prefer your analysis 
straighter, there's: "I, who'd never done a week's worth of manual labor
 in my life (hail, hail rock 'n' roll!), put on a factory worker's 
clothes, my father's clothes, and went to work." No matter how you slice
 it, it's an act, or to use a word he loves, a show: "You don't TELL 
people anything, you SHOW them, and let them decide." To convince them, 
he works hard, Jack, exerting himself as unrelentingly as any manual 
laborer, because only the audience's boundary-less love can satisfy that
 deep, ruinous emotional hunger. Yet what you think you see is not 
necessarily what you're getting. The book's most dazzling single passage
 is a phantasmagoric two-page recollection of the frighteningly 
self-conscious "multiple personalities" who battled within him during 
his very first European performance, at London's Hammersmith Odeon in 
1975. Ordeal over, he returns to his hotel room "underneath a cloud of 
black crows" and feeling like a failure. Only he was wrong--the 
performance became legendary, and when he worked up the guts to watch 
film of it 30 years later all he saw was "a tough but excellent set."<br>
<br>
Impinging even on these aesthetic reflections, however, you'll notice 
the familial history that provides not only this full autobiography's 
substratum but its true subject. You may want more about, say, Pete 
Townshend, who is quoted fruitfully on how the rock band makes de facto 
family members out of people you happen to meet as a kid, and his old 
pal Steve Van Zandt gets plenty of ink, as do departed saxophone 
colossus Clarence Clemons and departed organ grinder Danny Federici. But
 Springsteen leaves no doubt that although the show is his lifeline and 
he may die running, his love life in the broadest sense is what got 509 
pages out of him. Offstage he's been loved and loving from an early age,
 but between his unconditional grandmother and his silent father, 
learning to stick at it has been quite the sentimental education. 
Clearly Dr. Myers was his best teacher until he finally settled on 
homegirl turned backup singer Patti Scialfa in 1988 and married her in 
1991. But although he's not bragging, much of the credit redounds to 
him.<br>
<br>
Full autobiographies generally portray elders more acutely than youngers
 for the obvious reason that the elders are dead--they can't stop you 
and their feelings won't get hurt. But in Born to Run, Bruce's father 
Doug ends up packing more mojo than Van Zandt or Landau or Clemons or 
even Scialfa, and that's unusual. The story returns to Doug when it 
doesn't have to--no one would have missed that fishing trip. The account
 of his senescence, when he was finally diagnosed with not one but two 
major psychological disorders, is topped off with a bravura description 
of his body--"elephant stumps for calves and clubs for feet"--in the 
final hours of his life. Which in turn is topped by a briefer tribute to
 Bruce's miraculous mother, still radiating "a warmth and exuberance the
 world as it is may not merit" as she navigates Alzheimer's at 91.<br>
<br>
Scialfa doesn't resonate as vividly as his parents--discretion no doubt 
intervened, and is presumably why the redolently homely divorce case 
naming Bruce as a respondent goes unmentioned. Nonetheless, she's the 
silent hero of this book. Springsteen was never a dog, but from his 
teens he was a serial monogamist with lapses who acknowledges with less 
vanity than chagrin that he went through a lot of women, including his 
first wife, the model Julianne Phillips. Scialfa benefited from Dr. 
Myers's spadework as well as the failed Phillips experiment. She's no 
beacon of calm because that wouldn't work at all--she'd better the hell 
stand up to him. But she gives her husband the superstar version of a 
normal life he's clearly craved since a childhood that taught him he 
couldn't have one--a life both his maturing art and his everyman 
politics impelled him toward. Even the three kids are richly described, 
with discretion deftly served by focusing on their very different early 
years--in a passage few autobiographers would adjudge worth their 
literary while, Scialfa jawbones him first into getting up with the kids
 and learning to make pancakes and then into giving young Sam his 
late-night bottle-and-story. As he puts it: "She inspired me to be a 
better man, turning the dial way down on my running while still leaving 
me room to move."<br>
<br>
Born to run, yet happy with room to move. The artist's story is worth telling. But so is the man's.</div>

    <br>
5/5<br>
Recorded live with his seven-piece band, Springsteen's stirring album is an antidote to auto-tuned pop<br>

<br>
“One minute you’re here, next minute you’re gone,” Bruce Springsteen 
croons on the pensive opening of his 20th album, Letter To You. At 71, 
the veteran singer-songwriter seems in a reflective mood.<br>
<br>
One Minute You’re Here is a folky gem, as poignant as anything 
Springsteen has ever sung, his bruised vocals softened to match his 
acoustic guitar. It is, perhaps, what you might expect from a grand old 
man of rock and roll, entering his seventh decade in trying times with a
 tender rumination on the fragility of life.<br>
<br>
But then something rather wondrous happens as we roll on to the title 
song. With a dramatic wallop of snare drum smashes, a grand descending 
piano motif, a twisting howl of electric guitar and the high soaring 
flutter of a Hammond organ, the E Street Band announces itself in all 
its sinuous, spectacular glory. And Letter To You takes off like a 
rocket.<br>
<br>
Late last year, Springsteen summoned his long serving seven-piece band 
to his New Jersey home studio and recorded an entire album in just five 
days. He had a set of songs dwelling on mortality, memory, loss, hope 
and faith, shot through with a vein of defiance, a conviction that music
 itself has the power to heal and restore.<br>
<br>
“Rock of ages lift me up somehow,” Springsteen pleads on Last Man 
Standing, commemorating his first schoolboy band, The Castiles, of which
 he is the only surviving member. “I’m alive!” he roars with 
hair-raising conviction on Ghosts, whilst paying tribute to those the E 
Street Band have lost along the way: saxophonist Clarence Clemons and 
organist Danny Federici.<br>
<br>
Over the years, the Springsteen oeuvre has enumerated the ordinary 
struggles of blue-collar lives, but on House of a Thousand Guitars he 
addresses his own occupation as a working musician, serving his 
community. It is given a contemporaneous political setting where “the 
criminal clown has stolen the throne” but its core is mythic, to locate 
“a lost chord / That will band us together as long as there’s stars.”<br>
<br>
Recorded live, with no overdubs, the album is a celebration of 
performing music; a roar against the silence enveloping the world. It is
 deeply and unashamedly old-fashioned – almost the opposite of the 
stripped back, carefully layered and technologically processed digital 
pop of today.<br>
<br>
The E Street band build a towering wall of sound, a tsunami of 
instrumental attack. Its beauty lies in the intuitive simpatico of the 
playing, with different elements rising to the surface at just the right
 moment. It used to take them months in the studio to achieve this 
blend. Now these old road warriors can conjure it in a single take.<br>
<br>
The past is alive on three lost songs revived from Springsteen’s early 
days. The passionate commitment Springsteen brings to the wordy Song For
 Orphans, rambunctious If I Were the Priest and absolutely storming 
Janey Needs A Shooter (a title borrowed by Warren Zevon in 1980) 
demonstrate that, in essence, he hasn’t changed much over five decades 
of recording. Elegiac closer In Your Dreams has a wiser, more lived-in 
tone, but the optimism remains undimmed – a conviction in the power of 
music to lift us up, even in the face of death.<br>
<br>
Springsteen remains the gold standard in rock and roll, a 
singer-songwriter who never gives less than everything. Letter To You is
 another first-class missive from the Boss, signed, sealed and delivered
 with love.</div>

    <br>
5/5<br>
By<br>
Neil McCormick,<br>

LONDON TELEGRAPH<br>
June 13, 2019 <br>
</strong><br>
When Bruce Springsteen started out, he was a young man, frustrated at 
small-town life, roaring that he was born to run. In some ways he didn’t
 get very far, as he pointed out in recent one-man show Springsteen On 
Broadway. Over 40 years later, he still lives 10 minutes from his 
hometown of Freemantle, New Jersey.<br>
<br>
Springsteen turns 70 this year. He rose to stardom exploring the 
drudgery, sacrifice and rewards of working-class life while expressing a
 profound yearning for escape. The open road looms large in his songs, 
and in the mythology of America, but there is a very bittersweet tang to
 Springsteen’s latest road trip.<br>
<br>
“It’s the same old cliché/ Wanderer on his way/ Slipping from town to 
town,” Springsteen sings on The Wayfarer, acknowledging the itinerant 
leitmotif of his art. Even as the melody rises in a glorious rush of 
strings, the mood is tinged with regret. “Where are you now?” calls the 
wayfarer, thoughts stuck on someone left behind.<br>
<br>
Nostalgia has always been a core part of Springsteen’s oeuvre. The 
souped-up Seventies sound he created with the E Street Band was never 
particularly progressive, amalgamating blues, folk and rock ’n’ roll 
with the gossamer magic of pre-Beatles pop melodies and Phil 
Spector-style Wall of Sound production.<br>
<br>
On Western Stars, he follows an alternative thread of Sixties pop, 
evoking the orchestral baroque country of Jimmy Webb and Glen Campbell. 
Orchestras are woven into songs at source, with lush strings, booming 
timpani and flourishes of horns, while pedal steel guitars and tremolo 
effects add electric resonances. Springsteen drives proceedings with 
acoustic strumming, the rough tones of his voice rooting the symphonic 
gorgeousness in gritty reality. It stands comparison with his very best 
solo albums.<br>
<br>
Lyrics offer character sketches, lives caught with a few deft lines and 
evocative melodies. The title track pictures a washed-up Hollywood actor
 advertising Viagra, Drive Fast portrays a lonely, broken-down stuntman 
and Somewhere North of Nashville gives us an embittered songwriter who 
traded love for “a melody and time to kill”.<br>
<br>
The narrative is far from remorselessly bleak, however, lifted by the 
music and by Springsteen’s compassion for his characters. He has 
acknowledged lifelong struggles with depression, but the soaring Hello 
Sunshine chooses connection over the defeatist romance of isolation. It 
is a reminder that Springsteen’s own life as a touring musician has been
 grounded in family and domesticity (he has been married to his E Street
 bandmate Patti Scialfa since 1991).<br>
<br>
With its tension between escapism and responsibility, Western Stars is 
an album about reaching the end of the road, and what you might find 
there.<br>
<br>
Western Stars is released by Columbia on June 14</div>
