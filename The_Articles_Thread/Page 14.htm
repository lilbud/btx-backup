Bruce Springsteen at Hard Rock Calling 2012 review<br>
'A very disappointing end to an otherwise excellent gig<br>
15 July 2012</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
After the cancellation of a big gig in Hyde Park earlier this week, due 
to poor weather, The Boss's followers were understandably concerned they
 may miss out on seeing the big man play this weekend, but after 
goodness only knows how many tonnes of wood-chip, and a dry spell or two
 later, the central London park was good to go.<br>
<br>
62-year-old Springsteen, with his his E-Street Band behind him, still 
looks 'hot to trot' in a grey shirt and black waistcoat. He opens with a
 curious choice, the tender choice loaded with substance, 'Thunder 
Road', before seamlessly moving into some of his newer material, 
including the socio-political behemoth that is 'Wrecking Ball'. Sadly, 
for those jammed in like sardines anywhere other than in front of the 
sound-desk, the sound is hopeless. It's one of the few downsides of Hyde
 Park gigs, carefully repositioning yourself behind the speakers reaps 
rewards however.<br>
<br>
Renowned for his three-hour long shows, the set proves very similar to 
his Isle of Wight Festival set, as he plays a drawn out version of 'City
 of Ruins' and later groups the Borns together - 'Born In The USA' and 
'Born To Run', before squeezing in a heartfelt 'Glory Days' and nailing 
it with 'Dancing In The Dark'. There's a distinct feeling that this is 
all building up to something big, and low and behold - it is. <br>
<br>
After bringing Rage Against The Machine's Tom Morello out for a jaw 
dropping guitar solo, you'd think the collaboration element was done but
 then former Beatle, Paul McCartney, saunters on for a impassioned duet 
of 'I Saw Her Standing There'. But it's 'Twist And Shout' which really 
gets the crowd going, though The Boss can, and did, totally pull this 
one off on his own. <br>
<br>
Sadly, the organisers take the decision to pull the plug before the song
 has finished, leaving a clearly frustrated Bruce to try and say his 
goodbyes to tens of thousands of pissed off gig goers without the aid of
 a microphone - a very disappointing end to an otherwise excellent gig.<br>
<br>
Tonight Hard Rock Calling isn't just about the old Boss. There's a 
definite political element to the proceedings, with Tom Morello playing 
an early afternoon set of rousing protest songs, including a Woody 
Guthrie number; then there's old timer John Fogerty, who brings the 
party vibe with some upbeat old classics; finally Amy McDonald serenades
 the big man with her rendition of 'Born To Run' amidst a set of hits, 
including 'Mr Rock'n'Roll'.<br>

<strong class="text-strong">Review: Bruce Springsteen at the RDS<br>
<br>
Steve Van Zandt and Bruce Springsteen restore power at last night's gig<br>
<br>
By Ken Sweeney Entertainment Editor<br>
Wednesday July 18 2012</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen opened his first of two concerts in Dublin last night 
by making light of his weekend concert in London, which was brought to a
 halt for breaking a curfew.<br>
<br>
Coming on stage at 7.25pm, he stood with guitarist Steve Van Zandt in 
front of a huge power switch and told the crowd of 35,000 in the RDS: 
"Before we were so rudely interrupted . . ."<br>
<br>
It was fitting that his opening tune was 'Twist And Shout', the same 
Beatles song which he was performing with Paul McCartney when the plug 
was pulled at Hyde Park by the UK authorities.<br>
<br>
There was more fun made with the incident by his choice of second song, 
the Bobby Fuller Four track made famous by The Clash, 'I Fought The 
Law', whose thrashing by the E Street Band prompted Springsteen to 
remark: "That will teach them".<br>
<br>
It wasn't long before Dublin City Council chiefs were the next target. 
Springsteen and his band were fined an estimated €50,000 for breaching a
 curfew by 15 minutes at the RDS with their first concert and 19 minutes
 at their second gig in July 2009.<br>
<br>
"We're not sure when the curfew is tonight. Do you really have curfews 
in Ireland?" he said of the 11pm cut-off point agreed between promoters 
and Dublin City Council Planning.<br>
<br>
But curfews were forgotten as he began to hit his stride.<br>
<br>
There are few performers aged 62 who give three-hour live performances 
into which they throw themselves both mentally and physically. But 
Springsteen live is the stuff of legend.<br>
<br>
Maybe that's why, when other superstars are struggling to sell tickets, he continues to perform to sell-out crowds.<br>
<br>
With his legs astride, he delivered hit after hit from a back catalogue stretching back four decades.<br>
<br>
However, among the big choruses of rousing hits, 'Born in the USA', 
'Glory Days' and 'Dancing in the Dark', there was room for material from
 his 2012 album 'Wrecking Ball', his first since the recession.<br>
<br>
"We love Ireland and that's reflected in a lot of the music Bruce has 
been playing for the last 10 or 15 years -- its very rootsy and that's 
from Ireland," guitarist Van Zandt said.<br>
<br>
And there was an Irish stomp to many of the songs Springsteen played -- 
appropriate given that his great-great grandmother was one Ann Geraghty,
 born in Rathowen village, Co Westmeath, in October 1836.<br>
<br>
At the heart of the Springsteen engine, which has helped him sell 120 
million records and collect more than 20 Grammies, is the E Street Band.<br>
<br>
They took their first bow at 9.45pm as a giant white moon appeared on screens behind Springsteen.<br>
<br>
He started to bring the show to a close with the last song on Wrecking 
Ball' -- 'We Are Alive', -- which moved from acoustic ballad to a 
foot-stomper.<br>
<br>
'Born In The USA' had the house lights up and 35,000 hands punching the 
sky as they sang along and it was followed by 'Born To Run'.<br>
<br>
At 10.15pm he was still on stage playing 'Rosalita'. "Curfew, curfew," 
shouted Bruce before raising a fan's banner that said: "Only the boss 
says when to pull the plug", to cheers.<br>
<br>
'Dancing In The Dark' continued the greatest hits send-off to the night 
as he hoisted a fan out of the audience to dance with him on stage.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's long-time saxophonist was remembered in an array of video clips for tribute 'Tenth Avenue Freeze Out'<br>
<br>
In another send up of the Hyde Park concert, Springsteen wrestled with a
 man dressed as a London policeman over the on/off switch seen earlier 
in the show but the Boss kept to the curfew, ending at 10.46pm -- a 
total of three hours and 25 minutes on stage.<br>
<br>
Tonight, Bruce Springsteen and his E Street Band will do it all again.<br>

Darkness on the Edge of Town Box Set<br>
<br>
December 3, 2010<br>
<br>
<br>
Still the Boss ... Springsteen, shown in the late '70s, made the most of his small-town roots.<br>
<br>
Every album comes with a parallel universe in which the choice of 
different songs/sounds/emotions could have created another reality, 
another equally valid "definitive statement".<br>
<br>
It's one reason why many of us love box sets, with their 
unreleased/alternate songs. It's also why this massive collection is 
nigh on essential. It includes three CDs (the remastered album and two 
discs of unreleased material) and three DVDs (a fascinating documentary,
 a somewhat flat 2009 performance of the album alongside more enjoyable 
rehearsal/recording footage from 1976-'78 and a typically exhilarating 
'78 concert) packaged in a reproduction of one of Springsteen's famous 
spiral notebooks (containing notes, plans, lyrics and lists).<br>
<br>
It's important to understand the context of Darkness on the Edge of 
Town. In 1975, Springsteen compressed his style into translatable pop 
songs on Born to Run, scoring huge success by making euphoric-sounding 
tales of narrow horizons seem universal. He became a legitimate star.<br>
<br>
Almost immediately he became embroiled in legal action with his first 
manager, which prevented him from even entering a recording studio. 
During more than two years of litigation, Springsteen could do little 
more than write (some 60 songs), rehearse and simultaneously begin 
figuring out exactly what kind of artist he wanted to be.<br>
<br>
The answer, as the vividly captured characters in the sober-minded but 
passionately felt Darkness on the Edge of Town show, was someone more 
connected to the small towns he grew up in, more in tune with the lives 
of those he saw, more reflective of the less-than-euphoric mood of the 
country amid what president Jimmy Carter called its "malaise".<br>
<br>
Many of the unreleased songs were set aside not because they weren't 
good but because they couldn't fit in with this concept. If they had 
come out in '76 or early '77, immediately in the wake of Born to Run, 
songs such as the girl group romance of Gotta Get That Feeling and its 
sibling Ain't Good Enough For You, the Orbison homages of Outside 
Looking in and Wrong Side of the Street and the punchy pop of Talk to Me
 would have made a fine album you'd still be hearing on radio now. But 
by 1978 they weren't where Springsteen's head was at. Likewise Fire 
(later done by the Pointer Sisters) and Because the Night (added to and 
recorded by Patti Smith) felt too much like personal pop songs rather 
than stories of "real" lives.<br>
<br>
The notable exception among the unreleased songs is The Promise, which 
in its tale of frustrated dreams and burning, if contained, anger done 
in an almost hymnal setting would have (and maybe should have) slid on 
to Darkness perfectly, except that Springsteen felt it too 
self-referential.<br>
<br>
Darkness is a great album on its own, an essential point in one of the 
great careers. This box doesn't change or add to that album but it does 
expand the world around it in ways that any fan would revel in.</div>

A true original: Bruce Springsteen <br>
<br>
May 26 2005- The Daily Telegraph <br>
<br>
David Cheal reviews Bruce Springsteen at The Point in Dublin<br>
<br>
How does one man with an acoustic guitar hold thousands of people 
spellbound for two and a half hours? Answer: by being Bruce Springsteen.<br>
Bruce is currently in the throes of his solo acoustic world tour, which 
reaches London's Albert Hall tomorrow, and, while most performers would 
be left badly exposed by such a venture, for Springsteen, it's all in a 
night's work.<br>
To be fair, he had a grand piano and a harmonium on stage with him as 
well as his guitars; even so, he was entirely alone, and, far from being
 found out, he was clearly thriving.<br>
He's done this kind of thing before, nine years ago, when he released his downbeat narrative heavy, The Ghost of Tom Joad.<br>
This time the album is the new Devils &amp; Dust collection, a similarly
 sombre affair, which formed the backbone of this show. Minimally lit, 
surrounded by big elegant drapes, Springsteen became a kind of conduit 
for his music, eyes closed, body tensed, head tilted.<br>
There were, I have to admit, moments when my attention wandered - 
something that would be unthinkable during the Springsteen big band 
experience - but, as the evening went on, these were fewer and further 
between. By the end I found myself hypnotised by this shadowy figure 
singing his vivid story-songs in the gloom.<br>
The title track from the new album, which suggests moral and spiritual 
bankruptcy on the part of warmongers, was chilling. The River was 
gorgeous.<br>
The Rising, the title track of his last album but one, was 
inspirational, uplifting. Land of Hope and Dreams was spine-tingling. 
And, on Matamoros Banks, the story of a Mexican who drowns while trying 
to enter the States, he unleashed an astonishingly rich, exquisitely 
wistful soprano.<br>
Best of all was a completely reinterpreted Promised Land, which could 
serve as an object lesson for the likes of Bob Dylan in how to reinvent a
 song: not, as Dylan seems to think, by making it up as you go along and
 hoping that something interesting will happen, but, as Springsteen did 
here, by taking it back to its bones and starting again.<br>
Tapping out a rhythm with his hand on the soundbox of his guitar, he 
stripped the song of almost everything that made the original version 
great - chords, instrumentation, melody - and yet the result was 
hypnotic, and got the biggest cheer of the night. Only Bruce Springsteen
 can do this.</div>

<br>
Why they call him Boss — no drugs, not much drink, just hard graft, reveals this life of Bruce Springsteen<br>
<br>
Nick Rufford Published: November 11 2012<br>
<br>
It is hard to believe that it’s nearly 40 years since Bruce Springsteen 
released his first album. Fans who grew up listening to his songs will 
wonder where the years went. Some 120m album sales later he’s still 
going strong, completing a marathon world tour and appearing at election
 ­rallies in support of President Obama. Now 63, he must be mindful that
 the clock is ticking, though. Two of his ­longest-serving band members 
have died — his accordionist from cancer and Clarence Clemons, his 
saxophonist, from a stroke. Perhaps that’s why he has ­co-operated on 
this biography by the music critic Peter Ames Carlin. “There’s nothing 
like an oncoming train to focus the mind,” Springsteen said recently.<br>
<br>
It is a painstakingly researched book and based on — for the first time —
 interviews with Springsteen’s family and friends as well as with the 
Boss himself. To that extent it is the first authorised account for a 
decade. It sweeps through a career that began with Springsteen singing 
Twist and Shout at the Elks Club in Freehold, New Jersey, and ended in 
­stadium shows and megastardom.<br>
<br>
There is no shortage of detail. Carlin even tracked down the patrolman 
who was first on the scene of Springsteen’s 1968 motorcycle crash that 
left him injured and ineligible for military conscription. What 
distinguishes this account from recent books such as those by Pete 
Townshend and Keith Richards is the absence of the usual rock’n’roll 
ingredients. Springsteen’s father often consumed a six-pack of beer 
nightly, which gave Springsteen an enduring aversion to drugs and 
excessive drink. When he once went backstage and found one of his 
musicians holding a cocaine spoon up the nose of another he jumped on 
the individual straight away, snarling: “If I ever f****** see this 
again, I don’t care who it is, they’re gone, on the spot — fired.”<br>
<br>
<br>
As well as the highlights, Carlin does a good job of spelling out the 
humdrum, including Springsteen’s periods of isolation while he was 
song-writing, when days often consisted of getting up, eating Cheerios, 
walking on the beach or boardwalk and tinkering at the piano or acoustic
 guitar. There is enough good material to overcome Carlin’s sometimes 
chaotic style — a problem that a good editor could have sorted out by 
chopping up long sentences and elucidating puzzling points.<br>
<br>
Other rock stars of Springsteen’s ­vintage have commissioned 
ghostwritten autobiographies to put their own gloss on things. Instead, 
this is a warts-and-all account that includes Springsteen’s flashes of 
temper when things didn’t go his way. The book’s publicity blurb 
promises “little-known tales” of his father’s mental illness, the 
evening Bruce was nearly shot dead in his family’s home and the 
soft-porn movie he appeared in. These turn out to be damp squibs. If 
anything, the strength of Carlin’s account is in unravelling some of the
 folklore. Springsteen’s sister, for instance, recalls that his famous 
rows with their father, often cited as the source of his angst and 
creativity, were typical dad-teenage son stuff. “[Dad] wanted Bruce’s 
hair short and he wanted it long. Maybe to us it wasn’t that big a deal,
 but obviously to Bruce it was.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s first manager and producer, Mike Appel, with whom he had 
an acrimonious split, is refreshingly portrayed not as a typical 
record-industry villain but as a hard-working manager who fell out with 
the Boss over irreconcilable business differences. Overall, Springsteen 
emerges well — a self-taught musician from an unexceptional background 
with an exceptional talent. What set him apart, according to Carlin, was
 his single-mindedness. Other band members took jobs in boatyards and on
 construction sites to pay the bills, but Springsteen refused to be 
distracted, preferring to eke out a few dollars playing in dives, 
scraping along on just enough for his junk-food fixes and for the rent.<br>
<br>
He spent six months honing the title song of Born to Run, his 
breakthrough album, labouring over every syllable of the lyrics, then 
threw the finished acetate (first copy) of the record into a swimming 
pool because he thought it sounded dreadful. Springsteen says about 
himself: “I’m the most committed person I’ve ever run up against.”<br>
<br>
That same grittiness earned him the nickname the Boss and a reputation 
as a hard-ass. One night the lead singer of a rival New Jersey group 
turned up at a gig to find that the rest of his band had defected to 
join a then up-and-coming Springsteen. An audience member yelled at the 
unfortunate musician: “What instrument do you play?” He shrugged in 
defeat and replied, “second fiddle”.</div>

<br>
The tale of Bruce Springsteen’s ‘lost album’ The Promise is full of 
heartache and legal drama. There is lovely pop here, but it’s not the 
pop of its time<br>
<br>
Harry Browne Published: November 14 2010<br>
<br>
The Sunday Times of London<br>
<br>
"Remember,” says Bruce Springsteen to a bandmate, “there’s always room 
to throw out.” The black-and-white footage shows an astonishingly 
beautiful young Springsteen in the studio. He is slowly driving his 
fellow musicians crazy with his capacity to write new songs, record them
 and then toss them away. The album to be born in June 1978 is Darkness 
on the Edge of Town, and its gestation appears to be a process of 
elimination as much as of creation.<br>
<br>
Even when it comes to the songs he plans to keep, Springsteen — whose 
three previous albums had swelled with lyrical and musical excess — is 
intent on stripping them down. “Roy, you playin’ any fills?” he asks his
 piano player Roy Bittan. “If so, they’re out.” The tone is mock-Bossy, 
with a hint of mincing, but he’s clearly serious.<br>
<br>
These moments appear in Thom Zimny’s recent documentary, The Promise: 
The Making of Darkness on the Edge of Town, which — along with other 
home-movie clips and live footage — fills no fewer than three DVDs in an
 extraordinary (and pricy) new box set with an annoyingly similar name.<br>
<br>
For many fans, this set evokes a lyric from Darkness: “. . . if dreams 
came true, oh, wouldn’t that be nice”. The album holds a special place 
in our hearts; without the hype of Born to Run, the mega-popularity of 
Born in the USA or the scattergun eclecticism of The River, Darkness is 
the pure stuff, unadulterated Springsteen at his creative peak. In my 
own New Jersey adolescence, it was the first record, by anyone, that I 
fully inhabited, and I’ve heard of a fair few Irish adolescences in 
which it played a similar role.<br>
<br>
As Springsteen describes it in the recent interview that anchors Zimny’s
 film, Darkness was a “tone poem” of “power, directness and austerity”. 
The documentary relates Springsteen’s obsessive pursuit of a relentless 
drum sound. “Stick!” he would scream, annoyed at hearing the drumstick 
rather than the primal crack-boom of Max Weinberg’s drums. Many songs on
 the album are so austere that the “melody” consists of little more than
 whatever note Garry Tallent’s bass intones whenever the bass drum 
sounds.<br>
<br>
With all that stripping clean and throwing away, what was left out? And 
why was Springsteen only just getting into the studio nearly two years 
after being the magazine-cover face of record-industry hype with the 
release of Born to Run in 1975? The answers to these questions go to the
 heart, not only of this autumn’s “new” release, but also of the special
 place Springsteen holds in the history of the business — as opposed to 
the art — of rock’n’roll.<br>
<br>
For most of the gap between Born to Run and Darkness, Springsteen was 
hamstrung by a lawsuit with his former manager that kept him out of the 
studio. Although it was settled quicker than, say, Muhammad Ali’s ban 
from boxing eight years earlier, it has taken on some of the same weight
 for fans. We revel in his defiance of “the Man” — but we still wonder 
what might have been, if he hadn’t been kept out of the ring in his 
late-twenties prime.<br>
<br>
The Promise, tantalisingly, purports to give an answer, in the form of a
 double CD of 21 songs — Springsteen’s “lost album”, the one he says 
“could have/should have been released” in those gap years. (Just to 
cement the confusion, this album is also called The Promise, with a 
different ­mouthful of a ­subtitle.)<br>
<br>
Springsteen is hardly the only big old star to root through the archives
 or rejects for Christmas stocking-fillers. Yet he and his PR machine 
are uniquely playing “back to the future”, magically trying to recreate 
the “missing” Springsteen album. The vaults were full of unfinished 
works, so on this album about half the songs are substantially revised, 
with vocals, instruments and even lyrics that weren’t there at the time.
 In the liner notes, he writes absurdly: “I did what I would’ve done to 
them at the time and no more.” Not even “what I think I would’ve done”. 
No, the 61-year-old Bruce knows the 27-year-old Bruce so well he can 
reproduce exactly what his younger self “would’ve done”.<br>
<br>
Tampering aside, the claim that is this is the “lost album” is 
demolished when we recall a handful of the best outtakes from this 
period appeared in 1998 on the four-CD album Tracks and are not repeated
 here.<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, the two discs of The Promise comprise a good old/new 
Springsteen album. From the opening piano and ­harmonica of Racing in 
the Street (78) — like the version on Darkness itself but in a less 
monotonic voice and fatalistic key — to the moving lament of the title 
track, it often seems a more deliberate successor, or response, to Born 
to Run than ­Darkness itself does.<br>
<br>
Most of its songs are far more conventional but, like Darkness, it is 
shot through with anxiety — mostly romantic yet often material. These 
are the songs of a man who was worried about money. These days, Bruce 
isn’t so worried. The box set contains a DVD of the E Street Band in 
2009 playing the Darkness songs. On the title track, Springsteen changes
 a lyric, “I lost my money and I lost my wife”, to “I lost my faith and I
 lost my wife”.<br>
<br>
During 1976-8 he had every reason to worry: his former manager Mike 
Appel had failed to pass on a half-million-dollar cheque from the record
 company, and legal battle was joined. In the documentary, the 
21st-century Springsteen insists “It wasn’t” — the word barely gets to 
an unconvincing final ‘‘t’’, even by the low standards of New Jersey 
diction — “a lawsuit about money. It was a lawsuit about control.” Yet, 
five minutes later, he’s acknowledging how precarious his position was 
by the time the suit was resolved: “If I’d a had that one success [Born 
to Run] I’d a went back [sic] to Asbury Park millions of dollars in debt
 rather than the other way around.” The unusually fractured syntax from 
the carefully spoken Springsteen may indicate how painful the thought 
remains.<br>
<br>
The two “new” CDs of The Promise, along with Darkness, seem to contain 
more references to money, price, cost and status than anything in the 
pop-music canon outside Marvin Gaye’s What’s Going On. And that’s not 
the only link to soul music. On The Promise, there are several direct 
lines to Otis Redding and Motown. Ain’t Good Enough for You is stuck 
catchily in my head like Martha Reeves or the Supremes.<br>
<br>
Guitarist Steve Van Zandt suggests Springsteen could have been known as 
one of the great pop songwriters if he hadn’t kept throwing out catchy 
songs. The Promise seems to have been produced with that thesis in mind 
but assess it sceptically. There is lovely pop here, but it’s not the 
pop of its time. A few tracks sound like they could have charted in the 
mid 1960s — but not the late 1970s.<br>
<br>
In fact, while Springsteen was paring Darkness to a tone poem, he was 
letting “pop” songs out to other performers. Several went to Southside 
Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, his Jersey-shore pals, a group it would be 
only slightly cruel to describe as a truly great Sam Cooke tribute band.
 Even with songs such as Springsteen’s Talk to Me — itself one of the 
highlights of The Promise, with the singer crying repeatedly to his lost
 love “I got a full week’s pay!” over a Stax-like horn section — they 
made little impact on the charts.<br>
<br>
The two 1970s hits that feature in ­Springsteen’s own versions on The 
Promise don’t support Van Zandt’s thesis, either. Patti Smith reached 
the top 20 with Springsteen’s Because the Night after he couldn’t finish
 it, but that was scarcely pop. The Pointer Sisters’ version of Fire got
 to No 2; but the siblings were something of a novelty act, with clothes
 and harmonies drawn from mid century. They suited the song perfectly 
yet scarcely provide evidence of Springsteen’s contemporary pop 
sensibility — not that it matters to the catholic and often nostalgic 
tastes of 2010 when we can enjoy such work guiltlessly.<br>
<br>
We remember 1977-8 for disco, punk and the death of Elvis Presley. Of 
these, only Elvis figures prominently on The Promise, both as a source 
of inspiration and with a mention in a lyric. Punk is more relevant to 
the humourless austerity and explosive power of Darkness than to 
anything on the “missing” album.<br>
<br>
So, we’ve got an unproven thesis about Bruce the lost pop genius; a 
rather questionable archive exercise; and a good-but-not-great 
Springsteen album that melds a part (mainly the black part) of his 1970s
 sensibility with the pop nostalgia that dominated his 2009 Working on a
 Dream. His current single, Save My Love, is a mostly new, lightweight 
concoction that would have fit on that album.<br>
<br>
It’s the video for that single that reminds fans why we care. Shots, old
 and new, of Bruce and his band mix with images of his fans and even of 
some of the bootleg LPs that helped us fill those 1970s gaps. In this 
era of industry paranoia about piracy, the video reminds us how the 
pirates of yore gave us Springsteen’s music when the industry couldn’t 
oblige. Bruce gets it.<br>
<br>
On the song The Promise, recorded in 1977 — the nearest thing to a track
 “about” his lawsuit — Springsteen manages to configure what he had lost
 and what he feared losing as a sort of heroic sacrifice he had always 
intended to make: “we were gonna take it all and throw it all away”. 
Well, he didn’t. We didn’t. And (to hell with sacrifice!) 33 years later
 we’re glad he and his work — the great, the good, the indifferent — 
were carried back to us from the edge of the business’s abyss.</div>

<br>
Bruce Springsteen’s glory days may be behind him, but at 58 he is still 
forging ahead with a confidence and vigour that few acts of any age or 
era could muster. His current album, Magic, topped the chart in both 
Britain and America, and the star from New Jersey has come away with 
four nominations for the forthcoming Grammy Awards. Arriving in London 
at the end of a European tour, accompanied by his redoubtable E Street 
Band, Springsteen powered through his last show of the year with a 
classic, no-frills approach that still provided plenty of thrills.<br>
The eight men and one woman, were dressed entirely in black and 
stationed across the full width of the bare, functional stage. Apart 
from the screens above relaying close-up images of the musicians there 
was nothing in the way of theatrical effects, let alone costume changes -
 unless you count the donning of red fur-trimmed hats for a final encore
 of Santa Claus Is Coming To Town. For this was a show without window 
dressing.<br>
Instead, Springsteen’s trick has always been to invest all his thought 
and energy into the physical presentation of the songs, making “business
 as usual” seem like an occasion of profound and lasting importance. He 
didn’t just sing numbers like The Promised Land and Lonesome Day, but 
found a way to inhabit every crevice of their emotional landscapes. Eyes
 screwed shut, jaw clenched, right arm pumping away on his Telecaster 
guitar, he seemed to pour himself into the performance with all his 
strength and soul.<br>
He played a lot of harmonica, conjuring a spectacularly ghostly wail on 
the bluesy Reason To Believe. And he took a couple of rare guitar solos,
 jousting with Steven Van Zandt, during the magnificent closing section 
of Gypsy Biker. The saxophonist Clarence Clemons lent his usual touch of
 class to the sound and Soozi Tyrell added violin to Lonesome Day and 
several others. The best solo of the night, however, was supplied by 
guitarist Nils Lofgren during Because The Night, a spiralling sequence 
which combined virtuoso ability with a stunning sense of pacing and 
imagination.<br>
Springsteen prefaced Livin’ In The Future and the title track of Magic 
with brief homilies about the parlous state of American politics. He 
bemoaned the “roll back” of civil liberties and the twisting of the 
truth which has become part and parcel of the political process, but 
didn’t make too much of a meal of it. “We’re musicians,” he pointed out.<br>
Although two and a half hours long, the show proceeded at a tremendous 
pace, with barely a moment wasted at any point between songs. While new 
numbers, including the sombre Last To Die and the lighter touch of Girls
 In Their Summer Clothes delighted, it was the closing run of old 
favourites, Jungleland, Born To Run and an epic Dancing In The Dark that
 threatened to lift the venue’s already very high roof.<br>

Pete Paphides - London Times<br>
<br>
For one night only at Old Trafford, The Boss wasn’t a gum-chewing Scotsman pondering how to get the best out of Wayne Rooney.<br>
Nevertheless, Bruce Springsteen was quick to confide his own emotional 
ties to Manchester United. Before the show his soccer-mad 18-year-old 
son had filled his dad in on the triumphant climax of United’s season. 
What he perhaps failed to grasp was that an Old Trafford full of 
Springsteen fans didn’t necessarily double up as one full of United 
fans. Hence the mixed reaction when the screens revealed one fan giving 
him a United shirt with “The Boss” written on the back.<br>
Still, some way though a marathon show, it offered a reminder that 
Springsteen was fallible. That we needed reminding was beyond doubt. Far
 from playing down the effect he has on fans within his immediate 
proximity, Springsteen seems to derive immense amusement from putting 
himself among them and drinking up the love. He walked down from the 
stage to meet them with the bow-legged gait of an old farmer striding 
out to check on his cattle, and returned with a fistful of written 
requests. After a Lonesome Day high on audience participation, 
Springsteen apologised for the absence of his wife, Patti Scialfa - “at 
home making sure the kids don’t burn the house down and sell my 
favourite clothes on eBay”.<br>
Deliberately or otherwise, it all fed into the image of a consummate 
everyman. That shouldn’t detract from the fact that, in his way, 
Springsteen is a sophisticated showman. With the “Let it rain” refrain 
from Mary’s Place resounding into the persistent Mancunian spray, he ran
 across the stage, sank to his knees and continued to slide at a 
velocity that belied his 58 years. Aware that, right at the back, the 
big screens were people’s best chance of getting any sense of his 
actions, Livin’ in the Future was one of several songs that saw him 
striding from camera to camera, effectively eyeballing 50,000 fans as he
 sang.<br>
Like almost everything else on last year’s Magic album, a compendium of 
big-hearted rock’n’roll tunes, it already sounded like an old favourite.
 This, you suspect, is why Springsteen keeps returning to the E Street 
Band - in particular the dissonant harmonising of Steve Van Zandt and 
the affirmative honking of the veteran saxophonist Clarence Clemons 
(though, sadly, not Danny Federico, the keyboard player who finally 
succumbed to cancer last month). Present amid this synergy of 
imperfections were all the things that captured the collective 
imagination when these musicians first came to Britain 33 years ago.<br>
Far from dissipating with the decades, the old hunger was tempered with 
an increasing, inevitable knowledge that this really doesn’t last for 
ever. By the time the nine musicians on stage encored with a version of 
Born to Run, that more than mitigated for not knowing that Manchester 
was home to another football team.</div>

His songs speak eloquently about the injustices of blue-collar America. Can Bruce Springsteen do the same in person?<br>
<br>
Nick Rufford Published:November 21 2010<br>

The Sunday Times of London<br>
<br>
Sanctuary, Bruce Springsteen has found happiness at his New Jersey farm 
(Jonathan Torgovnik) Bruce Springsteen has got the shed that every man 
wants. There’s storage space for his motorcycles, for junk and 
memorabilia. There’s a music room with a mixing console and various 
guitars, and a den with that all-important beer fridge. Recently 
finished, it still smells of new wood. It’s a pretty big shed, but then 
Springsteen’s got a pretty big garden: at least 300 acres of farmland, 
accessed via a track that takes you through electrically operated gates 
and past a security hut.<br>
<br>
The man who has chronicled the struggles of ordinary people in 
broken-down, blue-collar towns has settled into the bosom of rural 
America. Long ago, the land around here earned New Jersey the title of 
“the Garden State”; hard to imagine as you make the drive from 
Manhattan, an hour away. Through the tunnel under the Hudson River, on 
to the New Jersey turnpike, then miles of monotonous industrial 
landscape. Go far enough south, though, and the factories and fuel 
depots give way to green fields and fresh air.<br>
<br>
New Jersey is very protective. It’s out of the media spotlight. I just 
go where I want to go, and do what I want to do Springsteen’s farm is 
close to Freehold, the Monmouth County town in which he grew up, but it 
could be in another state or another country. Away from the backstreets 
and closed-down mills, there’s a restored farmhouse and outbuildings 
surrounded by woodland and pasture. He spends his time here, riding 
horses and tinkering with his cars, which, since you ask, include a 1960
 Chevrolet Corvette, an old ’48 Ford Woody and a Range Rover “for 
getting from A to B”. At 61, he’s enjoying the rewards of 40 year’s 
rock’n’rolling, which have won him 20 Grammys, an Oscar and undreamt-of 
wealth. I’m standing in the music room looking at some of the 
memorabilia, including pictures on the walls of Springsteen with Mick 
Jagger and Bono, and a cushion embroidered with the cover of Greetings 
from Asbury Park, his first album.<br>
<br>
I don’t have long to wait before he breezes in, wiry and weatherbeaten, 
wearing jeans, work boots and a checked shirt. He’s walked across from 
the main house but he looks as though he could have parked his pick-up 
truck outside and come in for a beer after a day climbing telegraph 
poles. Earlier, he was sitting in holiday-weekend traffic, hence the 
short delay.<br>
<br>
“I had to go to the city [New York], which could have been worse, given 
it was Columbus Day. Then I took a swim in the ocean.” Catching my look 
of surprise, he says. “I go until about November. It’s still nice.”<br>
<br>
He settled in this corner of Monmouth County because people are used to 
seeing him around and he doesn’t get pestered. “New Jersey is very 
protective. It’s out of the general media spotlight you run into in big 
cities. I still like the ocean, the land around here and the smaller 
towns. I just go where I want to go, and do what I want to do.”<br>
<br>
Revitalising this farm has been a long process. He stopped the use of 
artificial fertiliser that was poisoning the soil — “It took five years 
to clean the soil, and some expense” — and now grows crops and grazes 
horses on chemical-free land. He’s turned the day-to-day running of it 
over to an expert in organic farming. Deer and other wildlife migrate 
here, he says, to escape hunters. Well, well. Springsteen the 
conservationist. Greetings from the deer park.<br>
<br>
We retreat to the den, where there’s a big lolling couch and easy 
chairs. He won’t remember, but I’ve spoken to him once before — at a 
packed concert in Roundhay Park in Leeds in 1985 when he was on his Born
 in the USA tour. I was editor of my university magazine and hoping, 
naively, as I hadn’t even approached the tour promoter, to get a few 
words from him.<br>
<br>
As he came off stage I shouted from the crowd, “You didn’t play No 
Surrender.” He shrugged and smiled: “You can’t play ’em all.” From that,
 I managed to construct a front-page “exclusive” about my encounter with
 the Boss.<br>
<br>
These days, interviews with Springsteen are, if anything, even harder to
 get. When he does them, he generally prefers to do them in a hotel 
suite in Manhattan, where journalists get a timed slot. One thing 
Springsteen doesn’t need is publicity. He’s sold 120m records worldwide,
 half of them outside the United States.<br>
<br>
Four of the five studio albums he’s made this decade have gone to No 1 
in the US charts. In recession-hit America, his hard-times music about 
shutdowns and lay-offs is arguably more relevant than ever. If he never 
wrote or recorded again, he could carry on earning millions from 
royalties.<br>
<br>
But on this occasion there’s something on his mind. He’s easy-going, 
affable — disarmingly so. Once we’ve got a little way through the 
interview, though, he leans forward and adopts a serious look. “There’s a
 widespread political consciousness that’s perhaps deeper in Europe than
 it is in the States,” he says. “I’ve noticed that, generally, if I’m 
interviewed by writers from overseas there’s a lot of interest [in 
politics].”<br>
<br>
 He’s saying this in measured tones and there’s a message building in 
his voice. It has to do with America and the way certain things aren’t 
working. Springsteen nailed his political colours to the mast when he 
backed Barack Obama in the 2008 election. His song The Rising became a 
theme of the Democrats’ “Vote for Change” rallies and was played over 
loudspeakers at Obama’s victory celebration in Chicago. He seems pleased
 to be airing his views to a journalist from a country where a state-run
 health service is not viewed as a throwback to the old Soviet Union.<br>
<br>
“The climate [in America] is very, very ugly for getting things done,” 
he says. “The moderate reforms President Obama fought to make are called
 Marxist, socialist. I mean, the most extreme language is put into play 
to describe the most modest reforms that would move the economy back 
towards serving a majority of its citizens. There’s a tremendous 
distortion of information.<br>
<br>
“The biggest problem we have now is almost 10% unemployment, but we also
 have the disparity of wealth. You can’t have an American civilisation 
with the kind of disparity of wealth we have. It will eat away at the 
country’s heart and soul and spirit.”<br>
<br>
Most people don’t want to be taking their political direction from guys 
that are shaking their ass in front of 60,000 people As Springsteen 
talks, the targets of his frustration become clearer. Since Obama swept 
to victory on a wave of popular enthusiasm, the president’s ratings have
 nose-dived and his party took a “shellacking”, as he put it in the 
mid-term elections. Conservative America — including some sections of 
the blue-collar bit that happen to be Springsteen’s natural constituency
 — has joined up to obstruct Obama, and Springsteen’s angry. “You have a
 guy [Obama] who comes in, he gets to be president for four years. Maybe
 eight. But you have the financial institutions, you have the military, 
the corporations. They’re in play constantly and, in truth, they’re 
shaping the economy and shaping the direction the US is moving in. Those
 forces are huge. The money and lobbyists are pouring in to do 
everything they can [to preserve the status quo]. It’s a very tough 
time, a very hard time here in the States.”<br>
<br>
The rich and powerful have made a grab for America, he’s telling me, and
 it’s up to ordinary citizens to seize it back. Occasionally, he can 
sound more like a hardcore politico than the man who paints gritty 
pictures of the American landscape in his lyrics. “Our economy has 
oriented itself away from the mass of US citizens and oriented itself to
 be at the service of the folks at the top, the plutocracy. [It] has to 
be oriented back to where it serves the health and purposes of a 
majority of American citizens. That’s not on the books right now.”<br>
<br>
Undoubtedly, he is moved by the worsening plight of those at the bottom 
of the heap who have been hit hardest by the recession. But isn’t this a
 bit much coming from a man who, according to Forbes magazine, earned 
£47m ($70m) last year? As well as the farm, there’s his house in an 
ocean-front area of Rumson, New Jersey, across the river from Jon Bon 
Jovi, plus a retreat in a gated equestrian community in Florida. He paid
 $3.1m for the Florida house two years ago, then bought a 
better-appointed neighbouring property for $4.6m, selling the original 
house at a loss. When he spends time there he’s among the well-heeled; 
his neighbours are Daniel and Ellen Crown, heirs to the General Dynamics
 fortune.<br>
<br>
Does his money make it difficult for him to write credibly about the 
poor and the dispossessed? He looks at me squarely. “Here’s the only 
thing I know. I write very well about these things. And I think about 
them very seriously. I take a lot of time and effort in the music that I
 write to try and honour the experiences of the characters I write 
about. That’s the best a writer can do.”<br>
<br>
If that sounds like a less-than-satisfactory answer, at least it’s an 
honest one. And it’s only fair to point out that in the United States 
rich people who believe in political reform are not dismissed as 
champagne socialists, as often happens in Britain. There’s no doubt he’s
 sincere, too. This is no longer the Springsteen of the sleeveless 
T-shirt and bandana, the one who delivered those sinew-straining, 
fist-in-the air renditions of Born in the USA in the mid-1980s, looking 
like Robert De Niro from the combat scenes of The Deer Hunter. In those 
days he steered clear of party politics, fearing — according to his 
biographer — “his own lack of political expertise would prove 
embarrassing”.<br>
<br>
When Reagan used Springsteen’s name to rally Republican voters (Reagan 
misinterpreted Born in the USA as a piece of jingoism instead of what it
 was — an indictment of the treatment of Vietnam veterans), he delivered
 a polite put-down to the president. So what changed his mind?<br>
<br>
“A moment comes when you cash in whatever credibility a guy can have who
 plays and sings rock songs for a living and you put your chips where 
you think they might do some good.<br>
<br>
“Most people don’t want to be taking their political direction from guys
 that are shaking their ass in front of 60,000 people. That’s 
understandable. So I put my two cents in when I can, to be as helpful as
 I can, when the moment arises.”<br>
<br>
It’s a decision he acknowledges has alienated some of his fans. “Half 
the people you’re gonna make mad. And that has to be okay with you. I 
got some nasty reactions. People sent me busted-up CDs or got mad if 
they saw me sometimes.” Springsteen’s very visibility means many fans 
didn’t hesitate to bend his ear. “Like you have the chef in the 
restaurant run out and say, ‘Why are you doing this?’ So you find 
yourself in the parking lot in a 10-minute discussion with the guy who 
just cooked dinner for you.<br>
<br>
“I’m a huge John Wayne fan. I didn’t care for his particular political 
bent, but I still love The Searchers and a lot of other work he’s done. 
Some people may never come and see me again, but I’d hope that’s a small
 percentage.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen may, in the words of Jeremy Clarkson, have made more money 
than God, but he made it the American way. In New Jersey in the 1950s 
and ’60s, his parents struggled to support him and his two sisters. His 
upbringing was marred by frequent rows with his father, who had a string
 of jobs as bus driver, prison guard and factory worker, but couldn’t 
hold on to any of them. “There was no going out on Saturday night,” 
Springsteen recalls. “I was never in a restaurant until I had a record 
contract. I was 27 years old and I’d still be intimidated by the guy on 
the door at the Steak and Ale. ‘You want a table?’ ‘I don’t know. Do I 
deserve one?’ ”<br>
<br>
At Freehold High School in the 1960s he was “at very best a mediocre 
student and would probably have been voted least likely to succeed”. His
 enduring memory is of never fitting in. He fared no better when he 
progressed to Ocean County Community College, where a group of students 
voted for his expulsion on the grounds of his “unacceptable weirdness”.<br>
<br>
Summing up his admiration for Bruce, Barack Obama said: 'I’m the president, but he’s the Boss'<br>
Weird or not, by his early twenties he was making a name for himself 
playing gigs on college campuses and in bars along the Jersey Shore.<br>
<br>
He earned the “Boss” nickname when he was in charge of doling out the 
meagre earnings to his band. “It’s been the merry bane of my existence 
ever since,” he scolds me when I ask (“and no, my wife does not call me 
the Boss”).<br>
<br>
Reconciliation with his father, Douglas, took a little longer. When he 
won an Oscar for his theme to Philadelphia in 1994, he took the award to
 show Springsteen Sr. Moved by his son’s success, Douglas said, “I’ll 
never tell anybody what to do again,” recalls Springsteen.<br>
<br>
His father was no longer alive — he died in 1998 — when, last year, 
Obama handed Bruce one of the highest accolades for those in the 
performing arts, a Kennedy Center Honor. Summing up his admiration for 
him, Obama said: “I’m the president, but he’s the Boss.”<br>
<br>
He’s leaning back in his chair, smiling at the memory. Lines appear on 
his face when he casts his mind back to more difficult times.<br>
<br>
In the 1970s, Springsteen and the E Street Band spent thousands of 
hours, mostly unpaid, shaping and recording songs, only to discard most 
of them. The “outtakes” from this period are what make up a new album, 
The Promise, which he has spent this summer working on. It consists of 
songs he decided didn’t fit the austere mood of the music he was making 
at the time.<br>
<br>
It’s no surprise to hear Springsteen confess on the DVD that accompanies
 the special-edition version of the album to having an “obsessive 
compulsive” side to his personality. “I was a dangerous man to be 
around,” he says.<br>
<br>
I push a little harder on the demons that drove him. He is famous for 
never having taken drugs, but it’s whispered that he’s “done therapy”.<br>
<br>
“How can I explain it to you?” he says, silent for a moment. “It’s 
simply an investigation of the forces that are at play on your psyche or
 your behaviour at any given point. I was interested in those forces, 
both as part of the work I was doing and also because [long pause… 
laughter] I had a lot of problems.<br>
<br>
"I still have ’em but I think there’s less now than when I started. Either that or I’m going to want my money back.”<br>
<br>
The problems that got under his skin, and inside his head, included his 
marriage in 1985 to the model and actress Julianne Phillips. After a 
whirlwind romance, the two were forced to conclude they had little in 
common, she having led, according to friends, a “charmed life”, growing 
up in a well-to-do family on the west coast, him a scruffy 
rock’n’roller. It was also said that he wanted children; she wasn’t 
ready.<br>
<br>
 He dissolved the E Street Band in 1989, and moved to LA, starting a 
family with his new girlfriend, Patti Scialfa, now his wife. His affair 
with her began when she was a vocalist in the E Street Band, predating 
an expensive divorce from Phillips.<br>
<br>
For a time he recorded with session musicians or on his own, but the 
shows were never quite the same as with the old line-up. After a decade 
in the Hollywood Hills, he uprooted and moved his new family back east, 
setting up home in New Jersey, close to his extended family, and 
reuniting with the E Street Band. Installed back where he grew up, he 
was keen to connect with the community. His charitable foundation helped
 pay for the FoodBank of New Jersey (which distributes food to the 
hungry) and for repairs for run-down housing in his neighbourhood. 
Dozens of folk had leaky roofs fixed or heating installed without 
knowing who their benefactor was.<br>
<br>
Previous to family life, I lived upside down and ass backwards, you 
know. I’d be up all night, sleep all day, do whatever came next He kept 
an astute eye on his own finances, on one occasion publicly thanking his
 business team. “They’re the money men,” he said at a music-industry 
event. “They bring back the pink Cadillac, the blue Cadillac, the yellow
 Cadillac, and the red Cadillac. And they make sure neither you, nor 
themselves of course, are gonna be broke when you’re riding in the black
 Cadillac.”<br>
<br>
At the same time, he resisted offers of easy money from advertising and 
endorsements, turning down on one occasion $12m that Chrysler reportedly
 offered him to use Born in the USA in a car advert.<br>
<br>
“I did?” he says with a twinkle in his eye. “That was the dumbest thing I’ve ever done. If that’s true, can I decide again?”<br>
<br>
He later insists it was not about principle. “I don’t have to do them [advertisements], you know, so it’s a luxury.”<br>
<br>
After the 9/11 attacks, Springsteen rallied support for a telethon in 
aid of victims’ families. He was moved by the fact that in the 
obituaries of victims, his music was often mentioned — typically a 
favourite song or just that they were a fan of the Boss. An album 
followed, The Rising, recorded in the aftermath of the attacks and 
released in 2002. There’s no denying that Springsteen benefited too. On 
the subsequent tour, he filled the New York Giants stadium to capacity 
for a run of 10 concerts — a record.<br>
<br>
In 2006, the tabloid New York Post accused him of getting too close to 
one of the relatives he was trying to help, linking him romantically 
with the widow of a 9/11 victim. The story petered out, despite being 
spiced with detail about the woman concerned being a redhead similar to 
his wife. Allegations of an affair with a different woman emerged in 
2009, but were later denied by the alleged mistress. On both occasions, 
Springsteen dismissed “ugly rumours”, saying in a statement that he was a
 loving father and devoted husband.<br>
<br>
In the den, he’s hunkered down into an easy chair. He’s pausing to let 
the past catch up with the present. He tells me that his daily routine, 
when he’s not on tour, now revolves around his family. “[Being] a 
musician is a shiftless lifestyle, one in which you’ve opted out of 
conventional rhythms and routines for the most part until family life 
forces you into them.<br>
<br>
“Previous to family life, which was very late for me, in my forties, I 
lived upside down and ass backwards, you know. I’d be up all night, 
sleep all day, do whatever came next.”<br>
<br>
A typical day now starts with the school run. “That’s the first thing I 
do. I make breakfast; I’m sort of in charge of that part of the morning.
 Once that’s successfully accomplished, and quite a challenge it can be,
 I may work out a bit or sometimes I’ll swim in the ocean. In the 
afternoon I may work on some songs, or whatever I’m doing. Over the 
years I’ve learnt to write quite well and quickly in stolen pieces of 
time. Then there’s dinner at home.”<br>
<br>
Two of Springsteen’s children — Evan, 20, and Jessie, 18 — are at 
university. Sam, 16, his youngest, is still at school. It’s a fee-paying
 establishment known for rigorous courses and a dress code that would 
have got Springsteen kicked out in his younger days. His two older 
children also attended.<br>
<br>
 Do your kids listen to your music?<br>
<br>
“No. Why would they do that? For your kids, it’s the least important 
thing about you. It’s just your job and it’s actually invasive and 
intrusive on their lives, I find. They just need you to be Dad. They 
don’t need you to be anything a whole lot more than that. Come in our 
house, and with the exception of some guitars around, you probably 
wouldn’t know musicians live there.”<br>
<br>
Many rock musicians might have considered hanging up their Fenders when 
they hit 60. Instead, Springsteen is taking his music directly to the 
audience, sidestepping the industry-wide slump in CD sales. His 
continent-hopping tours, some lasting over a year, have, with U2 and the
 Stones, put him consistently among the top earners from ticket sales, 
grossing a reported £276m in the last decade. His biggest followings are
 in the unlikeliest of places. In Scandinavia, where his music resonates
 in bleak, snowbound towns, record-company executives talk about the 
“Bjørn to Run” effect.<br>
<br>
In Japan, where rock singers are elevated to deity status, he’s known as
 “Bosu”. On the most recent tour, in 2009, he performed in 16 countries 
at 65 different venues, including Glastonbury, where he was a headline 
act. So how long can he carry on?<br>
<br>
Steve Van Zandt, guitarist, vocalist and Springsteen’s most loyal 
lieutenant, said recently: “Bruce has never talked about stopping. He’s 
not even close to running out of ideas.<br>
<br>
"Physically, he’s in the greatest shape of his life. There’s no reason 
why we shouldn’t keep the band together for another 10 years. Maybe 
more.” Springsteen hasn’t heard the quote before and seems tickled. 
“Steve said that? Jesus. Well, I guess it’s what I’ve spent my life 
doing.<br>
<br>
Has he achieved greatness? 'I wanted to be very, very good. I’ll leave 
everyone else to decide how well we did on a scale of 1 to 10'<br>
"That’s what gets me up in the morning. Why would you stop?”<br>
<br>
He amplifies the point, talking about what makes him continue to “empty 
the tank” for his audiences night after night, as Jon Stewart, the 
American TV host, put it recently.<br>
<br>
“You have to be able to hold two somewhat conflicting ideas in your mind
 simultaneously,” he says. “One is, it’s only rock’n’roll. The other is,
 at this particular moment, on this particular evening, it’s the most 
important thing in the world you can do. I feel the same as I felt when I
 was at the Elks Club in Freehold singing Twist and Shout for the first 
time: abject fear that you’ve been given an opportunity [and] that you 
may waste it. I don’t want to do that.”<br>
<br>
I remind him of something he says on the DVD: that when he was 27, his 
ambition was to be not rich, not happy, not famous, but great.<br>
<br>
Has he achieved greatness? He laughs loudly.<br>
<br>
“Yes,” he says, then checks himself. “I don’t know. Perhaps what I meant
 was that I wanted to be very, very good. I’ll leave everyone else to 
decide how well we did on a scale of 1 to 10.”<br>
<br>
The interview, sometimes more like a conversation because of his 
tendency to lapse into the kind of storytelling he does on stage, has 
been going more than twice the scheduled duration, and it’s time to wind
 up.<br>
<br>
He wants to show me a few things on the farm. We go outside, and in the 
gathering dusk he points out some deer moving like shadows in the grey 
light. “We let those out just to show visitors,” he jokes. The slightly 
earthier Springsteen — Springsteen the farmer — takes over. “This place 
was part of a big area for horses; the red-clay footing was very good on
 horses’ hooves,” he says. “It was also a huge agricultural area when I 
was a child. Originally, the Italians came over and worked in the 1920s,
 when it was potato farms. Now it’s Hispanics. There’s still agriculture
 but it’s a lot less. Soil in the area was driven toxic over the years 
from all the chemicals people fed to crops, so it takes a while to get 
it back.”<br>
<br>
We’re crunching on a gravel driveway and there’s a chill in the autumn 
evening. Surely there won’t be many more ocean swims. Neighbours regard 
the Springsteen spread as the best horse farm in the area. He keeps 
quarter horses, a popular American breed that excels at sprinting, as 
well as a string of showjumpers — “some Olympic standard”. His daughter,
 Jessie, has won a clutch of equestrian awards.<br>
<br>
“It’s a big place. Patti and I got it just as a respite, you know. She’s
 the one who said, you gotta be responsible for it. She had an eye 
towards conservation. So all of a sudden, you’re the caretaker.”<br>
<br>
He’s smiling as we part company. Before I leave, I tell him about an 
office cleaner who used to live in my road. Displayed proudly on the 
side of his van was his firm’s name: Spruce Springclean.<br>
<br>
Back then, this man would stop me whenever I walked past and remind me 
that “Elvis may be the King but Springsteen is the Boss.” That was 20 
years ago.<br>
<br>
Spruce Springclean. And yes, he’s still chuckling as he heads back to the shed.</div>

'I love Springsteen because he always captures the mood of the time'<br>
<br>
Greg Dyke<br>
The Observer, Sunday 24 April 2005<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
The arrival of a new Springsteen album is always a major event in my 
life. By complete coincidence, it always seems to mark a new phase or a 
new time for me, especially when it is accompanied by the chance to see 
the great man himself on tour.<br>
<br>
My mind is littered with memories of Springsteen albums and the 
Springsteen concerts which invariably accompany them. The first, for me,
 was at Wembley, way back in 1981, soon after my marriage broke up, 
followed a few years later with Bruce opening up with 'Independence Day'
 at the Born in the USA concert at Wembley Stadium, which just happened 
to be scheduled on American Independence Day. Then there was the Tom 
Joad concert at the Albert Hall in 1996, when I went with just my 
seven-year-old son. He still claims he saw Springsteen that night, even 
though he slept in my arms throughout the whole concert. Or Springsteen 
at Earls Court in '99 on the day I was interviewed by the governors of 
the BBC for the director-general's job. I remember explaining to them I 
had to be away by seven, as some things are not to be missed. I saw the 
concert and got the job.<br>
<br>
In truth, Springsteen has been part of my life for more than a quarter 
of a century and although he's younger than me I somehow feel we have 
grown old together, with his music reflecting the two areas of music - 
rock and folk - which have dominated my musical tastes.<br>
<br>
So what is it about Springsteen which makes him quite so special for the
 likes of me? Somehow, on every new album, there's always a track or two
 which manage to capture the mood of the time and they always come from 
his own left-of-centre perspective. I was proud when he sent money to 
the miners during the great miners' strike, when he led the concert 
after 9/11 and when he toured the country opposing the re-election of 
George Bush. Somehow, I felt he represented me.<br>
<br>
I don't know him, I've never met him but I do believe he's real and 
genuine, that he does sympathise with people in adversity - the illegal 
immigrant, the displaced industrial worker, the people whose lives were 
destroyed by 9/11 or now, on the latest album, the soldier going to 
Iraq.<br>
<br>
I need to play a new Springsteen album at least 20 times before I can 
really appreciate it. I need the journeys alone in the car late at night
 with Springsteen blasting out before I can truly work out which I think
 are the outstanding new songs. So all I can say of Devils &amp; Dust is
 that it's from the Tom Joad tradition, that the title song is haunting 
and that Mary, who is usually to be found in at least one song on every 
album, is replaced by Maria. But, in truth, all I really need to say is 
that it's the new Springsteen album. That's enough.</div>

<br>
By Ken Hoffman | August 13, 2012<br>
<br>
Houston Chronicle</strong><br>
<br>
After the U.S. Men's Olympic basketball team beat Spain for the gold 
medal Sunday, the arena blared Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the U.S.A," 
while U.S. fans whooped it up.<br>
<br>
They've got to stop using that song.<br>
<br>
"Born in the U.S.A." is not a patriotic song. It's not a happy song. 
It's not about winning or triumph or anything positive. It does rock, 
for sure, and the title says "U.S.A." But that's where the good times 
end.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's song is about a troubled Vietnam vet who can't find a job, and our Veterans Administration won't help him.<br>
<br>
Come back home to the refinery<br>
<br>
Hiring man said son if it was up to me<br>
<br>
Went down to see my V.A. man<br>
<br>
He said son, don't you understand?<br>
<br>
This is the thanks he gets after the Army sent him halfway around the 
world to kill the enemy in Vietnam. For the cherry on top, the lyrics 
contain an offensive description of Asian people. That's the Olympic 
spirit, all right.<br>
<br>
And just when the song can't get any more depressing, we learn that the vet's brother was killed in the war.<br>
<br>
I had a brother at Khe Sahn<br>
<br>
Fighting off the Viet Cong<br>
<br>
They're still there, he's all gone.<br>
<br>
"Born in the U.S.A" is an angry protest song against the U.S. 
government. Stop using it to celebrate victories by U.S. athletes. It's 
not helping us win friends.<br>
<br>
A couple of years ago, I was in Williamsport, Pa., covering the Little 
League World Series. They played "Born in the U.S.A." before a game 
between a team from Connecticut and - this is unbelievable - a team of 
Asian kids from Taiwan.<br>
<br>
I told Little League officials to listen to the words to "Born in the 
U.S.A." A week later, I got a letter from the president of Little League
 International. They'll never use that song again. If Little League can 
wise up, surely the Olympics can follow.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen's masterpiece is worth revisiting<br>
By Andrew Dansby | November 15, 2010<br>
<br>
Houston Chronicle</strong><br>
  <br>
Bruce Springsteen made his first big splash with the album Darkness on the Edge of Town. <br>
<br>
Reviewing the new reissue of Bruce Springsteen's masterpiece Darkness on
 the Edge of Town is a lot like reviewing a thunderstorm. Do you go for 
the sights? The sounds? The feeling of it? Its contents span more than 
30 years, and the set includes three CDs and three DVDs. It also comes 
with a hefty price tag; there will likely be early sale prices, but the 
retail tag sits 2 cents shy of $120. Only you know the degree of your 
devotion in the middle of a recession. But the contents are undoubtedly 
admirable.<br>
<br>
The key carrot for many locals will be the inclusion of Thrill Hill 
Vault Houston'78 Bootleg: House Cut, a concert recording from The Summit
 on Dec. 8, 1978.<br>
<br>
Let's get one very faint quibble out of the way first. Today's standards
 for filming a concert differ greatly from those in 1978, so the 
multicamera film lacks some of the visual pop we've come to expect. 
There are moments when the lights go down that the screen goes 
completely black. Quibble concluded, as it really doesn't matter because
 this concert was volcanic.<br>
<br>
Obviously nothing could compare to being there, but those in attendance 
are likely to be goosed seeing Springsteen and the E Street Band 
slashing through these 26 songs again (it seems some between-song 
footage has been excised as the DVD's three hours runs much shorter than
 the four-plus-hour estimates fans have recalled). There's little point 
in singling out songs because the performance was relentlessly frenzied 
(though Streets of Fire is fittingly incendiary). Was the show better 
than others from the tour? Who knows, but it's an awesome marriage of 
brawn and brain in a single rock concert.<br>
<br>
Dale Adamson's Chronicle review is reprinted inside the spiral notebook 
that houses the set. Proof that faster isn't necessarily better in this 
line of work, the poor guy had to split nine songs early to file his 
story. So he caught a great Because the Night and missed Backstreets, 
Rosalita, Tenth Avenue Freeze Out and Born to Run, among others. 
(Imagine trying to summarize a baseball game after six innings.)<br>
<br>
So, the rest of the set…<br>
The Darkness album is given a punchy remastering here, fitting because 
it was a leaner album than its predecessor. And these songs are always 
worth revisiting — dark documentarylike tunes about desperate people in 
desperate times. They race, they love well, they love poorly, and they 
end up on a hill when they probably shouldn't be on that hill.<br>
<br>
The Promise, a documentary about how this magnificent album got made, is
 also included. Die-hards likely already saw it on HBO a few weeks back.<br>
<br>
For those who didn't, it lacks the flimsy quality of most "about an 
album" music docs, featuring Springsteen's cooperation and commentary, 
along with copious vintage footage from the era. It also offers an 
interesting look at Springsteen's 
create-and-destroy-and-re-create-and-edit working process, which 
involves different iterations for some songs. Others get left by the 
wayside. Two CDs worth from the Darkness era end up bundled here as The 
Promise, the title track being one of the best of them. The pretty and 
plaintive fiddle-driven Come On (Let's Go Tonight) and soulful 
countrified rocker It's a Shame are great tunes that simply wouldn't 
have worked on Darkness - these songs, which celebrate the old-school 
rock from Springsteen's youth, represent what could've been a very 
different follow-up to Born to Run.<br>
<br>
Another DVD - Thrill Hill Vault 1976-1978 - is odds-and-endsy but still 
contains some fine footage, studio and live, from that span. How 
Springsteen's eyes don't fly from his skull during a Phoenix performance
 of Badlands will just have to remain a mystery. That DVD is filled with
 a live performance from Asbury Park's Paramount Theatre in 2009. From a
 production standpoint, it looks and sounds perfect. But something is 
also missing, and it's not just keyboardist Danny Federici, who died the
 year before.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and the E Street Band remain a powerful thing live. But the 
tight shots and the seasoned players lack some go-for-broke quality that
 the older footage - with Springsteen moving and snarling like a wolf - 
does. There's not that sense of courtship or seduction. It's hardly 
rote, his passion still leads with its chin. But the whole thing exudes 
wisdom before swagger.<br>
<br>
All in all, though, this package takes an essential album - one that 
speaks to the times as well now as it did then - and places it in a 
treasure chest.</div>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen still surprises with his concert set lists<br>
Springsteen’s long show will probably include ‘Dancing in the Dark,’ but what about ‘Highway Patrolman’?<br>
BY DAVID MALITZ<br>
The Washington Post<br>
<br>
One reason fans keep flocking to Bruce Springsteen shows is that an 
element of surprise exists. Not just from tour to tour, but from night 
to night.<br>
<br>
This is a rarity when it comes to arena-size concerts, where what people
 pay for is less a music event than a carefully choreographed 
production. The norm with most acts is to play the same songs in the 
same order and have the same pyrotechnic explosion at the same moment 
every night. The show Madonna performs in Cleveland on Saturday is the 
same exact show fans saw last week in Kansas City.<br>
<br>
A Springsteen show is different. There are scripted moments, of course, 
but on any given night he could break out a song he hasn’t played in 
years. To give you some idea of what the Boss might play next week at 
his Sprint Center show, we’ve put the set list possibilities into 
categories and included possible percentages of the concert, below.<br>
<br>
• 12 percent staples from ‘The Rising’: The Boss experienced yet another
 resurgence in popularity with the release of his 2002 album, “The 
Rising,” which became the unofficial soundtrack to American resilience 
post-Sept. 11. Three of the album’s best songs, the title track, “My 
City of Ruins” and “Waitin’ on a Sunny Day,” are set list regulars.<br>
<br>
• 16 percent every-night classics: It’s great when Bruce breaks out the 
rarities, but there are certain inalienable rights that come with buying
 a Springsteen ticket. Hearing “Born to Run” is one of those rights. 
There’s a 99 percent chance you’ll hear a handful of other songs, 
particularly during the encore: “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,” “Thunder 
Road” and “Dancing in the Dark.”<br>
<br>
• 20 percent new material: Springsteen released his 17th studio album, 
“Wrecking Ball,” in March, and his spring tour featured it heavily. At a
 D.C. performance in April, he played eight of the album’s 11 songs. 
This second trip across the country is still technically part of the 
Wrecking Ball tour, but don’t expect to hear almost the entire album; 
five new songs looks to be the norm this time around.<br>
<br>
• 24 percent almost-certainties: These songs aren’t locks on the level 
of “Born to Run,” but it’s likely that on most nights you’ll hear many 
of them. Of such tried-and-true favorites as “Badlands,” “Rosalita,” 
“Glory Days,” “Hungry Heart,” “Working on the Highway,” “Darkness on the
 Edge of Town” and “Darlington County,” one of them might not make the 
cut, but you can count on such classics making up about a quarter of the
 set.<br>
<br>
• 28 percent wild cards: For true Springsteen fanatics, this is where 
things get fun. Will he dig deep for “Atlantic City”? Maybe he’ll take 
it back to the beginning with “The E Street Shuffle” or break out “Prove
 It All Night.” Perhaps a fan with a colorful sign request will catch 
his eye and the audience will be treated to a real rarity. “In the past 
several years, Springsteen has been taking requests from the crowd. He 
has never been stumped,” David Remnick wrote in a recent New Yorker 
profile. Springsteen usually will play a cover or two as well. You’ll 
likely hear more obscurities in cities where Springsteen plays multiple 
nights; in single-show cities, the “standard” set list usually is the 
norm.</div>

				<div class="content">MUSIC; From the Quiet of a Bedroom, Raw Songs of America<br>
By ANTHONY DeCURTIS<br>
Published: December 31, 2000<br>
The New York Times<br>
<br>
I WANTED to let the listener hear the characters think, to get inside 
their heads, so you could hear and feel their thoughts, their choices,''
 Bruce Springsteen has written about his 1982 album ''Nebraska,'' a 
chilling portrait of an America that has spun off its moral compass. ''I
 wanted the music to feel like a waking dream and the record to move 
like poetry. I wanted the blood on it to feel destined and fateful.''<br>
<br>
Those lofty ambitions would seem to run counter to the confession Mr. 
Springsteen made about ''Highway Patrolman,'' one of the most powerful 
moments on ''Nebraska,'' in a note to his manager during the album's 
earliest stages. The song is ''not really finished,'' he said, but 
''about as good as I can get it at the time.''<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen recorded the songs for ''Nebraska'' in his bedroom, 
using a four-track tape machine. He assumed that those versions were 
merely demos, that he would soon flesh the songs out in a proper studio 
with his band. When he tried to do that, he ended up feeling that he was
 losing the essence of his original vision. He then recorded versions of
 the songs solo in a studio, and the results were similarly sterile. So 
10 of the performances on Mr. Springsteen's bedroom tape, which he had 
carried around in his pocket for months, became ''Nebraska,'' and the 
album's quality of being ''not really finished'' became part of its 
mythology, a crucial reason why it holds such a revered place in the 
lore of popular music.<br>
<br>
Like ''Pink Moon,'' the painfully spare album released in 1972 by the 
doomstruck English folk singer Nick Drake -- and recently revived, with 
perfect postmodern irony, by the use of its title track in a Volkswagen 
ad -- ''Nebraska'' proves several of the most staunchly held tenets of 
the rock 'n' roll faith: the first impulse is the best; the right feel 
trumps musical perfection; production, with its perceived lack of 
spontaneity and its emphasis on craft, crushes the individual voice and 
is the enemy of art.<br>
<br>
Consisting largely of Mr. Springsteen's performing solo on acoustic 
guitar, ''Nebraska,'' strictly speaking, is hardly rock 'n' roll. But 
its risk-taking rawness -- as well as its sympathetic but unforgiving 
depiction, in Mr. Springsteen's words, of ''characters out on the 
edge,'' traveling ''from nowhere to nowhere'' -- is driven by the 
rebellion at the heart of that music.<br>
<br>
It is a rebellion that, for Mr. Springsteen at the time, had taken on a 
political cast. He has called ''Nebraska'' his most personal album, but 
it also indicts the smug certainties of the then ascendent Reagan era. 
In a couple of years, Mr. Springsteen would square off directly with Mr.
 Reagan when the president spoke approvingly of ''Born in the U.S.A.,'' a
 song originally written for ''Nebraska,'' as endorsing his own vision 
of America.<br>
<br>
''The president was mentioning my name the other day, and I kind of got 
to wondering what his favorite album might have been,'' Mr. Springsteen 
told an audience in Pittsburgh. ''I don't think it was the 'Nebraska' 
album.'' He then played a song from ''Nebraska'' called ''Johnny 99,'' 
about an unemployed man who commits a murder. ''Now, judge, I got debts 
no honest man could pay,'' Mr. Springsteen sang. ''The bank was holdin' 
my mortgage and they was takin' my house away/ Now I ain't sayin' that 
makes me an innocent man/ But it was more 'n' all this that put that gun
 in my hand.''<br>
<br>
So the release on election day of ''Badlands: A Tribute to Bruce 
Springsteen's 'Nebraska' '' (SPCD 525) is a heartfelt endorsement of 
that rebellious spirit in a time dominated by political apathy, pop 
slickness and marketing might. As a form, the tribute album has proved, 
almost by definition, to be a mixed bag, and ''Badlands,'' which takes 
its name from the Terrence Malick film that inspired the album's title 
track, is no different. The biggest disappointment comes right at the 
top, a soporific version of the title song served up by Chrissie Hynde 
and Adam Seymour of the Pretenders. In Springsteen's hands, the tale of 
Charles Starkweather and Caril Fugate's murder spree in the 1950's 
becomes emblematic of a corrosive spiritual exhaustion summed up in a 
line meant to evoke the tormented ramblings of the Misfit, the murderous
 main character in ''A Good Man Is Hard to Find'' by Flannery O'Connor: 
''There's just a meanness in this world.'' Ms. Hynde and Mr. Seymour 
stagger through a glacially slow meditation on ''Nebraska'' without 
displaying any comprehension of its violent depths.<br>
<br>
The artists who fare best on ''Badlands'' do so by upsetting the 
listener's expectations as radically as Mr. Springsteen did the first 
time around. For example, Hank Williams III, the grandson of the country
 music legend, transforms the brooding ''Atlantic City'' into a 
honky-tonk stomp, suffusing it with the manic desperation so prevalent 
elsewhere on ''Nebraska.'' And Crooked Fingers, the latest project of 
Eric Bachmann, the former singer and guitarist of Archers of Loaf, 
deftly find the swirling, dreamlike center of ''Mansion on the Hill.''<br>
<br>
Playing beautifully on acoustic slide guitar, Ben Harper sings ''My 
Father's House,'' a song about the devastating psychological absence of a
 parent, with all the heartbroken yearning of a child seeking a 
connection that can never be. Most surprisingly, Deana Carter shoots a 
steamy erotic current through the lost-highway saga, ''State Trooper.'' 
She is the country singer known for the album ''Did I Shave My Legs for 
This?''<br>
<br>
''Badlands'' also includes versions of three songs that were on Mr. 
Springsteen's original cassette but never made it onto ''Nebraska,'' the
 most notable of which is Damien Jurado and Rose Thomas's haunted 
reading of the relatively obscure ballad ''Wages of Sin.''<br>
<br>
In both its stripped-down sound and its themes of guilt, suffering and 
redemption, ''Nebraska'' is Mr. Springsteen's most rigorously focused 
album, if one of his least commercially successful. It was a bold 
aesthetic move by a man who had only recently become a superstar. With 
performances by 13 artists, ''Badlands'' could never aspire to that kind
 of conceptual unity. But, like ''Nebraska'' itself, its implications 
reach beyond the pop marketplace. Complacency can destroy you, these 
songs whisper, because ''there's just a meanness in this world.'' It's a
 message of existential urgency that has lost none of its currency and 
isn't likely to any time soon.</div>

<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
By J. Freedom du Lac<br>
Washington Post Staff Writer <br>
Tuesday, November 13, 2007</strong><br>
ABruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert circa 2007 comes with 
an implicit quality guarantee. While it might not say as much on your 
ticket, you know going in that the show will have a particularly high 
base line, given that the group is more or less incapable of proffering a
 poor live performance. Indifference and creative implosions simply 
aren't on the list of possibilities; even on their worst nights, the 
band is at least good.<br>
<br>
Sunday night at Verizon Center was not one of those nights. Instead, 
Springsteen and his longtime band were simply great, performing a 
well-considered set with heightened intensity and a very clear sense of 
purpose.<br>
<br>
The guiding principle of a Springsteen show is to deliver salvation and 
hope through song. Forging bonds is critical, as well -- no audience is 
more important to Springsteen than the one he's currently trying to win 
over -- and so he set out to do just that with the audience here 
immediately. "Is there anybody alive out there?" he wondered. " Is there
 anybody alive out there?" And away he and the E Street Band went with 
"Radio Nowhere," a chugging new single about searching for connections 
in a disconnected world.<br>
<br>
Performing the first of two sold-out nights at the arena, Springsteen 
and his nine-piece band delivered a marvelous 24-song set that included 
some of his greatest hits ("Born to Run," "Dancing in the Dark," 
"Badlands") but was particularly heavy on songs from "Magic," a new 
album whose central figures are isolated, alienated and disillusioned. 
They've been betrayed and deceived, and so there's a riptide of angst 
tugging at those who occupy this wartime Americana.<br>
<br>
<br>
Springsteen articulated that in both music and words: The song "Magic," 
he said, is about how "the truth gets twisted into lies, and lies get 
twisted into the truth." In introducing "Livin' in the Future," he 
talked about rendition and wiretapping and a Constitution under 
"attack." "The E Street Band is here tonight to do something about it!" 
he said. "We're going to sing about it. We're musicians. It's a start."<br>
<br>
His moaning harmonica set the tone for "Gypsy Biker," a haunting tale 
about a soldier who comes home in a casket. "Last to Die" was a soaring,
 impassioned antiwar rant. "Devil's Arcade" -- dedicated to Veterans Day
 -- was a moving, meditative lament from a soldier's lover who lost her 
man to the military.<br>
<br>
Their ideas were big, and the sound was bigger. Sometimes too big: With 
the audio mix muddy throughout the arena, instrumental parts stuck 
together and some vocals were swallowed whole. It was a shame, given 
just how tight the band's playing was, from Nils Lofgren's pealing 
guitar leads to Max Weinberg's tempo-pushing drumming, so furious yet so
 steady.<br>
<br>
Still, the message rang clear: All is not well in the promised land of 
America. But all is not lost, either. "At the end of every hard-earned 
day, people find some reason to believe," Springsteen sang as the band 
turned "Reason to Believe," one of his stark "Nebraska" songs, into a 
bluesy stomp.<br>
<br>
Springsteen remains one of the most potent live performers in popular 
music -- largely because he's among the most committed practitioners of 
the form, draining all of his creative energy every time he's onstage. 
(And there is much to drain, as his well runs exceptionally deep, even 
at the age of 58.) He also maintains an unwavering faith in the power of
 rock-and-roll; in turn, his own power is undeniable. Add the E Street 
Band to the calculus, and the result can be exhilarating and explosive, 
whether they're performing Springsteen's trenchant political poetry, his
 brittle working-class anthems or his rich, youthful narratives.<br>
<br>
Sunday's 2-hour 15-minute set touched on all of Springsteen's thematic 
hallmarks, and even reached deep into his catalogue for a pair of songs 
from 1973, back before he'd established himself as one of the most 
gifted and important voices in rock. Among them was the shifty 
blues-jazz of "Kitty's Back," a most welcome and thrilling stylistic 
curveball thrown into a marvelous set that was heavy on muscular rockers
 with overdriven guitars.<br>
<br>
There were songs about love and broken hearts, about refusing to grow 
old ("No Surrender") and the reality of growing even older ("Girls in 
Their Summer Clothes"), and, in "Night" -- an old warhorse that somehow 
still sounds fresh -- about restless, romantic young souls whose world 
is busting at its seams.<br>
<br>
Arguing about whether the concert would have been better served if only 
they'd eschewed such-and-such (off "Magic" in this case) for so-and-so 
(from the "The River," no?) is something like an Olympic sport among 
Springsteen die-hards, and those debates have been raging since the last
 note of the old-time folk finale "American Land" faded inside the arena
 on Sunday. Which just goes to show you how hard Springsteen and the E 
Street Band have it: When you're always good, simply being great might 
not be good enough.<br>

<br>
The New York Times<br>
<br>
FIFTY THOUSAND guests were gathered at a twilight party in this 
straitened, immobile summer, and the host knew just what was on their 
minds.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen had collected from the front rows in Giants Stadium 
the signs that fans have been bringing to concerts lately, scrawled with
 the names of the songs they hoped to hear. He chose from among them one
 that, he said, he had performed live only twice before, “Held Up 
Without a Gun.”<br>
<br>
“I’m going to dedicate this to what it cost you guys to drive here,” he 
said, and then ripped so fast through the song — the shortest of the 
night — that it was over almost as soon as it started, much like the 
summer journeys of many in the crowd.<br>
<br>
Gas at $4 a gallon. Mortgages past due. Canceled flights and airport 
chaos. Looming layoffs and truncated vacations. Where do you go and what
 do you do when everything seems to be keeping you in one place, with a 
lock on your wallet?<br>
<br>
One lesson of this grounded summer is that if you can’t get away from 
home, at least you might take a new look at it. Another — for those who 
may not have lived here long enough to learn it already — is that New 
Jersey is a much bigger place than it seems: You don’t have to go far to
 get someplace new, which happens to be the lesson at the heart of Mr. 
Springsteen’s work, too.<br>
<br>
When the great French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson was shooting 
images for a photo essay of the United States, he spent much of his time
 here. “New Jersey is America,” he said by way of explanation. Our state
 sits at the center of the Northeast Corridor like a natural history 
exhibit, a compendium of dioramas from other states, conveniently 
arranged at short distances from each other.<br>
<br>
You can see Vermont in the green and rounded hills of Morris County, New
 Hampshire in the craggier reaches of Passaic County, the Finger Lakes 
of upstate New York in Sussex County. You can see Cleveland and 
Pittsburgh in Trenton and Newark, Niagara Falls in Paterson. Martha’s 
Vineyard is in Ocean Grove, Nantucket in Cape May. Las Vegas is in 
Atlantic City, Churchill Downs in Monmouth Park. The San Joaquin Valley 
is in the vegetable farms around Vineland and Bridgeton. Island Beach 
State Park is Cape Cod, without the houses.<br>
<br>
Drive through the drowsy, shady small towns that hug the banks of the 
Delaware River and you might be tracing the upper reaches of the 
Mississippi. Warren County noses so far toward Pennsylvania that it is 
almost indistinguishable from it. The Palisades echo the Oregon coast, 
the salt marshes of Cumberland and Salem counties the coastal lowlands 
of the Carolinas. The piney, sandy expanse of Fort Dix might easily be 
in Georgia.<br>
<br>
Even here in the Meadowlands, if you had detoured on the way to the 
concert, you could drive down an unmarked road into the marshes, stand 
amid the tall swaying grasses under a huge, unbroken sky, and imagine 
for a moment you were in Nebraska.<br>
<br>
And what is the Shore — the part of New Jersey that Mr. Springsteen 
evokes more sweetly than any other — but Southern California, with a 
Labor Day expiration date?<br>
<br>
“So how has your summer been going?” Mr. Springsteen asked the audience,
 and the answer they roared back seemed to say that things hadn’t been 
too bad after all, no matter how many places they hadn’t been.<br>
<br>
Staying in one place can show you some other things, too, beyond these 
scenic postcards. You get to see how things turn out. New Jersey gave 
Mr. Springsteen — whose roots in the state predate the Revolution, and 
who has raised his family here — a rich store of raw material, of 
characters and stories and wisdom, from which to build the songs that 
50,000 people knew the words to when he turned the microphone to them.<br>
<br>
“I’ve always found it deeply resonant holding the hands of my kids on 
the same streets where my mom held my hand, swimming in the same ocean 
and taking them to visit the same beaches I did as a child,” he said in 
May, when he was inducted as an inaugural member of the New Jersey Hall 
of Fame. “That’s what New Jersey is for me. It’s a repository of my time
 on earth. My memory, the music I’ve made, my friendships, my life. ...”<br>
<br>
You don’t have to go far to get someplace new — over and over again, he 
pounded out the same message with his band. I was in the upper tier, and
 all through the evening, I could glance up and see the lights of the 
planes heading in and out of Newark. They were going somewhere else, but
 so was I.</div>

				<div class="content">Album review: Bruce Springsteen's 'Wrecking Ball'<br>
March 4, 2012 | 10:35 pm<br>
 <br>
The Los Angeles Times<br>
<br>
It's not necessarily a bad thing that “Wrecking Ball,” Bruce 
Springsteen's first studio album in three years, sees the 62-year-old 
artist updating his sound. <br>
<br>
He's done it before, though not with as much apparent intent as on 
studio album No. 17, which often seems like a direct response to the 
music of Canadian indie rockers Arcade Fire. After all, it's important 
for a boss to pay attention to the ideas of the upstarts in middle 
management from time to time. Inspiration often needs an external boost,
 and at some point an artist must acknowledge that the inheritors are 
now guiding the conversation.<br>
<br>
But Springsteen doesn't always get it right on “Wrecking Ball,” a record
 that, more than anything he's done in a decade, sees him addressing Big
 Picture themes about America, war, the economy, provincialism and 
revolution. <br>
<br>
Whether he's channeling Montreal's finest, his own New Jersey heart, 
Southern gospel, Irish folk music, New York rap (yes, there's a 16-bar 
rap — very ill-advised — on “Rocky Ground”) or Southern twang, the Boss 
is pumped up and full of anthemic energy.<br>
<br>
Produced by Ron Aniello (Jars of Clay, Barenaked Ladies, Candlebox), 
“Wrecking Ball” is a big record in every sense of the word: It's 
Springsteen with a large band and cruising on musical growth hormones, 
filled with muscle and bellowing out phrases loudly: “Shackled and 
drawn!” he sings on a song of the same name. “Death to my hometown!” 
goes another. On the title track, Springsteen, manifesting his Jersey 
roots, challenges anyone listening to “C'mon take your best shot / Let 
me see what you got / Bring on your wrecking ball.”<br>
<br>
This is a change of pace. For the last decade, Springsteen — since his 
2002 album with the E Street Band, “The Rising” — has been examining his
 gentler side: The first notes on his last album, the middling “Working 
on a Dream,” came via a string section, and throughout that record the 
Boss seemed content using his inside voice and a hefty helping of piano.
 <br>
<br>
“Magic,” from 2007, had some rockers, but they too felt designed for 
dining room listening in comparison to “Wrecking Ball.” The 2006 
hootenanny that was “We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions” was a 
backyard campfire album.  “Wrecking Ball,” by contrast, sees Springsteen
 out in the virtual great wild, where screams resonate and nobody's 
gonna tell you to shut up.<br>
<br>
Chances are this raised voice is the result of the election cycle. 
Bruce, though unwilling to take specific political sides (he alludes to 
right and wrong way more than he does right and left), refers to the 
state of America in nearly every song and understands more than anyone 
else that political music made in election years tends to reverberate 
louder. Romance is the furthest thing from his mind on “Wrecking Ball” —
 unless it's in service of some sort of grift, as on “Easy Money.”<br>
<br>
That few are going to talk back to the Boss isn't always a good thing. 
After so much output, the songwriter has certain themes he falls back 
on, and a few of them here border on self-parody. “Jack of All Trades” 
is a Springsteen period piece about a blue-collar man and bankers who 
grow fat; “Easy Money” features yet another Springsteen woman in a red 
dress and relies on a “honey,” “money” “sunny” rhyme scheme that you can
 see coming from a mile a way. He rhymes “hat” with “cat.” <br>
The lyrical angle of “You Got It” sounds strikingly similar to Def 
Leppard's '80s hard-rock anthem “Armageddon It.” And Springsteen may owe
 Tom Waits a writing credit — or at least a rib-eye dinner — for 
“Shackled and Drawn,” which seems ripped from his more experimental 
peer's playbook.<br>
<br>
All this adaptation isn't on the surface a bad thing; in fact, his 
citations are in the liner notes, naming five songs as inspiration, 
including funk vocalist Lyn Collins' James Brown-produced song “Me and 
My Baby Got a Good Thing Going,” Curtis Mayfield's “People Get Ready” 
and 1950s gospel field recordings directed by ethnomusicologist Alan 
Lomax. He employs the sound of an AK-47 firing, and even swipes a chunk 
of Johnny Cash's “Ring of Fire” for the album's closer, “We Are Alive.” 
But as evidenced by that song, he doesn't always pull it off. <br>
<br>
The propulsive energy of Arcade Fire, whose “Keep the Car Runnin'” 
Springsteen has covered live, drives much of “Wrecking Ball,” though. 
The band has long cited Springsteen as an influence, but the tables have
 turned: You can hear it in the violin sprint — and in Springsteen and 
wife/backing vocalist Patti Scialfa's call-and-response — on the title 
track. You can hear it in the bonus cut “American Land,” which also 
conjures the spirit of post-punk Irish band the Pogues. And you can hear
 it most obviously on “We Take Care of Our Own,” the first single.<br>
<br>
Granted, no one creates in a vacuum, and all enduring artists have 
thematic obsessions: Walt Whitman addressed the same ideas and words 
over and over again in the course of his life, and with each turn he 
refined his own universal message for a new year and mind-frame. Woody 
Guthrie and Ma Rainey had ideas they repeatedly turned to over the 
course of their lives, and taken as a whole each of these artists by the
 end of their careers had created singular bodies of work.<br>
<br>
Ditto Springsteen — though his days as an artist whose new work inspires
 young minds seem to be in the past. While you're likely to find youth 
citing “Darkness on the Edge of Town” or “Nebraska” as touchstones, it's
 far less likely that in two decades they'll be discussing “Wrecking 
Ball” that way. It'll be considered a late-period record that saw him in
 good, not great, voice.<br>
