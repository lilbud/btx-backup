<br>
Producers: Jon Landau, Chuck Plotkin, Bruce Springsteen, Steve Van Zandt • Engineers: Toby Scott, Bob Clearmountain<br>
Published in SOS March 2010<br>
<br>
 <br>
Seven top 10 singles isn’t bad going for a career, let alone one album, 
yet that’s precisely what Bruce Springsteen achieved with his smash hit 
1984 LP, Born In The USA. This is the story of how it was made...<br>
<br>
<br>
The mid-’80s were the apex of Bruce Springsteen’s still-flourishing 
career. Not only did Born In The USA become the most successful album he
 has ever released — selling more than 15 million copies in America and 
30 million worldwide — but it spawned seven top 10 US singles, tying it 
for the record that is currently also held by Michael Jackson’s Thriller
 and Janet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation 1814. To date, those songs — ‘Dancing
 In The Dark’, ‘Cover Me’, ‘Born In The USA’, ‘I’m On Fire’, ‘Glory 
Days’, “‘I’m Goin’ Down’ and ‘My Hometown’ — still comprise more than 
half Springsteen’s present tally of 12 top 10 hits, while the title 
track is a radio staple and a regular at Fourth of July celebrations.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, despite its anthemic chorus and the fact that President 
Ronald Reagan tried to utilise the song for his 1984 re-election 
campaign, ‘Born In The USA’ is not the energetic paean to flag-waving 
patriotism that many people initially thought — and some still think — 
it to be: “I got in a little hometown jam / And so they put a rifle in 
my hands / Sent me off to Vietnam / To go and kill the yellow man.”<br>
Focusing on a small-towner who, after trading jail time to serve his 
country, returns home an outcast and can’t even find work at the local 
refinery, Springsteen’s song, far from appealing to the jingoistic, 
actually flushes the American Dream straight down the toilet. And it 
does so with a intense passion that is stirring and infectious. That is,
 on the hit version, with its thunderous drums and then-contemporary 
synth backing. Yet, as originally recorded by ‘The Boss’ and eventually 
issued on his 1998 Tracks four-CD box set, the acoustic demo is, in line
 with its desolate message, both stark and funereal.<br>
<br>
Meet The New Boss<br>
<br>
It was in 1981 that writer-director Paul Schrader asked Bruce 
Springsteen to write the title track for a movie about a blue-collar bar
 band. This had the working title Born In The USA, and Springsteen came 
up with the song of the same name while working on a track called 
‘Vietnam’. Schrader would eventually rename his film Light Of Day after 
Springsteen, who turned down the lead role that subsequently went to 
Michael J Fox, provided him with a replacement song in the form of 
‘(Just Around The Corner To The) Light Of Day’, recorded by Joan Jett.<br>
“‘Born In The USA’ didn’t sound like the Bruce Springsteen that I had 
mixed on his previous two records,” says Toby Scott. “I didn’t know what
 Bruce wanted the track to sound like, but what the producers and I 
definitely knew was that it sounded sensational.”<br>
In addition to serving as an engineer on 18 Springsteen albums and 
numerous live performances, Scott has also recorded artists ranging from
 Bob Dylan, Natalie Merchant and Steve Perry to Manhattan Transfer and 
Little Steven &amp; The Disciples Of Soul. Musically inspired by the Ed 
Sullivan Show TV appearances of both Elvis Presley in 1956 and the 
Beatles in 1964, Scott taught himself to play guitar as a high-school 
student in Santa Barbara, California, during the mid-’60s. Then, after 
playing bass in some local garage bands, managing a couple of them, 
studying music theory and orchestration in college, and working for 
concert lighting and production companies in conjunction with acts such 
as Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and Blind Faith, he began engineering, 
recording his own songs with a TEAC 3340S simul-sync four-track tape 
recorder and six-channel Sony mixer.<br>
In 1975, two six-week engineering courses led to Scott securing a job at
 LA’s Clover Studios, owned by A&amp;R/producer Chuck Plotkin. There, in
 the course of assisting on an album by Robert Palmer and recording 
others by Booker T &amp; The MGs and Harry Chapin, he honed his craft by
 learning from the likes of Steve Cropper, producers Tom Dowd and Steve 
Smith, and engineers Phill Brown and Richard Digby-Smith. It was quite 
an education, yet Scott still had plenty to learn about Bruce Frederick 
Joseph Springsteen when, in the spring of 1978, he first encountered the
 man with whom he would forge his most prized professional relationship.<br>
“I had heard of Bruce some time earlier as being ‘the next Bob Dylan’, 
but that was about it,” Scott now recalls. “Then, when Chuck Plotkin 
came in with this kid, I quickly realised he was about the same age as I
 was, about the same size, about the same everything — we were like two 
peas in a pod. We both weighed about 130lbs; I’m 5’11”, Bruce is 5’10”, 
and he was very down-to-earth. Chuck needed to mix one of the songs for 
the Darkness [On The Edge Of Town] record, and after we spent one or two
 days on it we sequenced the record and mastered it.”<br>
<br>
Working The Room<br>
<br>
Following this assignment, Toby Scott became Clover’s manager and chief 
engineer, and just over a year later he began combining these roles with
 independent work at other studios. In 1980, he assisted Chuck Plotkin 
on the mix of Bruce Springsteen’s album The River. This was after Neil 
Dorfsman and Bob Clearmountain had already tried their hand at it.<br>
“I went into Clover on a Monday and put up a mix,” Scott recalls, “and 
Bruce, who would always stay in the upstairs lounge, came down to listen
 and said, ‘It sounds pretty good, but it sounds funny. It doesn’t sound
 right.’ I said, ‘Well, what’s wrong?’ and he walked behind the console 
and said, ‘The drums. Didn’t we use some room mics?’ I said, ‘Yeah, 
they’re on these two faders.’ I had them all the way down, about an inch
 from the bottom, and Bruce took them and jammed them all the way up to 
the top. Immediately, the sound was all room, and so I said, ‘Oh, OK... 
Well, now that I’ve got the concept of what you’re looking for, let me 
just rebalance stuff.’<br>
“I can’t remember which song it was, but clearly he wanted the room in 
there, and that was fine — I roll with the punches. So, I rebalanced it 
for the room, readjusting stuff to account for the drums sounding like 
they were coming from the other end of a basketball court, and when 
Bruce came back down and listened he went, ‘That’s it! Great! Good 
deal!’ The next day, we did another song. At that point, Neil [Dorfsman]
 was coming in, looking over my shoulder for the first 10 or 15 minutes 
and going, ‘Now, this is the saxophone that we use, and then you use the
 guitar on this track for the first part of the solo and the guitar on 
that track for the second part of the solo...’ This was how we worked on
 the Monday and Tuesday, and then on the Wednesday, after a couple of 
hours working on another song, I took a break, saw [Springsteen’s 
manager/producer] Jon Landau out in the hallway, and when I asked him 
where Neil was he told me Neil was in New York. ‘You’re doing fine,’ he 
said. ‘Don’t change anything, just do what you do.’ Whatever the 
differences were in our mixing, they apparently liked my style.”<br>
<br>
A Focused Mix Point<br>
<br>
A couple of months later, Toby Scott found himself using the Record 
Plant’s remote truck to record some Bruce Springsteen concerts. Then, 
after mixing Gary ‘US’ Bonds’ On The Line album in March 1982 — for 
which Springsteen wrote seven of the songs, co-producing them with 
Steven Van Zandt — Scott was asked to fly to New York to not only mix 
Van Zandt’s own Men Without Women, but also to record Springsteen’s Born
 In The USA at the Power Station.<br>
“From noon until six, I was working at the Hit Factory, mixing Steve Van
 Zandt, and then from seven until one in the morning I was with Bruce at
 the Power Station, recording basic tracks,” Scott explains. 
“Eventually, Steve was so excited by the mixes and the perspective, he 
wrote four more songs that I recorded and mixed, and in all I ended up 
spending about four months in New York.<br>
“Bruce had recorded The River at the Power Station, which he liked 
because of the ambience of the main room, but I had never worked in a 
control room like that. Most all of the control rooms in Los Angeles 
were of the dead variety, or acoustically treated so that anything by 
the speakers was live while the back of the room was dead [or, later, 
the other way around]. It was therefore strange being in the Power 
Station environment where everything was very live.<br>
“The floor in the control room was wood, all of the walls were wood, the
 ceiling was wood, and the ceiling was not sloped whatsoever, whereas 
Los Angeles studios in the ’70s and early ’80s had gotten into this 
design that had a focused mix point. The Altec 604E monitors would be up
 on the wall above the control-room glass, pointed at an angle down 
towards a focused mix point. From there, the ceiling would be sloped 
down to about six or seven feet above the head of the focused mix point,
 and it was like sitting at the cone of a big speaker. The Power Station
 was just a rectangular room, with the speakers actually hanging from 
cables or track on the ceiling, and it was fabulous. To this day, I will
 declare the best rooms I have ever worked in are those that are either 
designed or run by active engineers: not people who used to do it, not 
people who think about doing it, but people who are doing it.<br>
“Tony Bongiovi designed the Power Station, having worked at Media Sound 
for a long time with Bob Clearmountain as one of the assistants, and the
 whole place was set up for an engineer, or, more likely, an 
engineer/producer. It was ergonomically very functional and Tony had 
gone to extremes to get the main Studio A [live] room right, building 
multiple sides of unequal lengths that went into a pyramid shape and, 
after being dissatisfied with the initial sound, adjusting the distances
 between the vertical panelling boards of the walls. By the time I got 
in there, it was just a great-sounding room — provided you used a little
 bit of sense, the drums sounded incredible.”<br>
<br>
Troubleshooting<br>
<br>
On the first day of Born In The USA sessions all was far from well, as 
Scott explains: “nothing came together... the sound was just a 
mish-mash.” Determined that this experience would not be repeated on day
 two, he therefore re-analysed the main studio area for 
musician/instrument placement, including that of E Street Band drummer 
Max Weinberg. Utilising the drum-miking setup that Scott had perfected 
with Jeff Porcaro, Weinberg enjoyed a bigger sound courtesy of Neumann 
U87 room mics that were on huge boom stands at the far end of the room, 
pointing up towards the ceiling.<br>
“Neil [Dorfsman]’s recording of the room mics had been one of my 
problems when I mixed The River,” Scott explains. “There was so much 
cymbal in those room mics, I had to recreate the room by using the 
Clover studio and piping some of the drums back out over speakers into 
the studio to have them reverberate around, while also using reverb 
units. On the other hand, for Born In The USA I was somehow able to find
 a spot where the cymbals were at an even volume with the tom-toms and 
things like that, so you merely got the effect of a room.”<br>
While bassist Garry Tallent was in the main room with Max Weinberg and 
recorded with a DI and an amp miked with an Electro-Voice RE20, 
saxophonist/percussionist Clarence Clemons was in the lounge, looking 
through the porthole of the studio loading door so that he could see 
Tallent and Weinberg, as well as Bruce Springsteen who sang and played 
his guitars in an iso booth to the right of the control room, adjacent 
to the mic closet. Steve Van Zandt was in his own booth to the right of 
the control room, and both his and Springsteen’s guitar amps were in 
another booth across from the control room on the right-hand side. 
Keyboardist Danny Federici, meanwhile, played his Hammond B3 through a 
Leslie. This was miked with a Neumann U87 on the top speaker and an RE20
 on the bottom in a booth directly across from the control room on the 
left-hand side, separated by a divider from yet another booth which 
housed Roy Bittan, who played the grand piano as well as a Yamaha CS80.<br>
<br>
The Words Are The Song<br>
<br>
“The entire E Street Band played live,” says Toby Scott. “Bruce sang 
into a U87, and while he may have redone his vocal, as a general rule he
 has always been very confident. He just sings his part and that’s it, 
and usually the only reason we will do a second take is if he wants to 
impart a different inflection, sing with a fuller voice, whisper 
something a little bit more or change the words. After I’d started out 
recording him with a U87, he used a U67 for a little while because it 
was fuller and smoother. However, it was not quite as clear, and so I 
then miked him with a dual-capsule Sanken CU41.<br>
“As far as I’m concerned, the words are the song, so I want to hear 
them. Bruce is the most eloquent guy that I know, but his enunciation 
isn’t always the greatest, so I try to do everything I can to make it 
really easy to hear his words clearly. The CU41 was really clear, and he
 used that up until about four years ago when he spotted a Telefunken 
[ELAM] 251 next to his mic in the studio. I go back and forth, recording
 both Bruce and his wife [singer-songwriter Patti Scialfa], and back in 
the late ’90s, after we’d experimented with several microphones, she 
decided that the 251 was the one that she loved. So, I found one and 
bought it for her, and I used to have both that and the CU41 sitting 
side-by-side in the little vocal area of their home studio setup. Well, 
one day Bruce asked what the mic was, and when I told him it was Patti’s
 he asked, ‘Why don’t you use it on me?’ I said, ‘Because the one I’m 
using on you sounds fine.’ He said, ‘Can we try it?’ I said, ‘Sure,’ and
 he said, ‘OK, just open a track and I’ll experiment.’<br>
“You have to understand, Bruce and I hardly ever experiment. I pick the 
microphone that, in my estimation, is the one that will work, and I also
 have a philosophy that I don’t want to waste an artist’s time while I 
figure out how to do my job. However, in this case Bruce sang into the 
CU41 and into the Telefunken, and in the end he pointed to the 251 and 
said, ‘Gee, I kind of like it. Can I use this one?’ I said, ‘Sure,’ he 
said, ‘OK,’ and that certainly simplified my life. I now use the same 
microphone and the same chain for him and his wife. Since I’m not a 
close-miking person, I usually start Bruce off at least six inches from 
the mic, with a windscreen about an inch or two in front of it. Then, 
for his acoustic guitar, I use an AKG 460, whereas back in 1982 I would 
have used a 451.”<br>
<br>
Broken Reverb<br>
<br>
“The tape machine in the Power Station’s Studio A was a Studer A80, the 
console was a 44-input Neve 8048, and that facility must have had around
 10 reverbs. One of them was a five-storey stairway that had been 
blocked off, where you could move the microphones and speakers up and 
down. Then there was the Ladies’ Room, formerly the ladies’ bathroom, 
which was an all-tiled room that they used for very good drum reverb. 
Additionally, they had about five EMT 140 stereo plates, along with a 
Scandinavian knock-off of the 140.<br>
“The assistant there told me, ‘We have this other plate, but it’s 
broken.’ I said, ‘What’s wrong with it?’ and he said, ‘The motor on the 
decay adjust is shot.’ I said, ‘Let’s hear it,’ and so he plugged it in,
 I ran a drum into it, and the decay boomed and rattled and kept on 
going for about three or four seconds. When I was told it was broken and
 nobody wanted to use it, I said, ‘Perfect, I’ll take it! Put my name on
 it for the duration of this project!’ I wanted stuff that nobody else 
was going to screw with.<br>
“You know, if you’ve got an EMT plate it’s real critical, especially in a
 mix, and I would just dump every instrument on a tape full-on into the 
reverb unit, into an EMT plate, so it was reverberating like mad. Then I
 would adjust the decay time on the plate, and I’d stop every so often 
to hear how stuff sounded, tuning it so that the decay time and the 
tempo of the song sort of correlated. After a few minutes you could 
actually listen to it and go, ‘Well, jeez, it doesn’t sound that bad,’ 
even though all of the echo knobs were fully turned up on everything. If
 you get it to the point where a ton of echo is almost believable, you 
can then pare it down to a normal level and it’ll just blend in so that 
you won’t even realise there is echo on anything. However, that takes 
time and I didn’t want to do that every night. So, when I tried the 
knock-off plate I said, ‘I’ll use that. Just patch it in and don’t even 
fix it.’<br>
“I took the output of that plate and ran it through what at that time 
was the only gate, a Kepex. I set the Kepex for an external input of the
 bottom snare mic and I set it to close in about a second. Then, I fed 
the top snare drum mic into that reverb unit — it was the only thing 
that went in there — and that created the explosive snare drum sound 
that you hear on the album. A combination of Max hitting the snare, the 
physical sound of the drum, the room mics from the Power Station and 
then this four-second plate reverb created this really tremendous drum 
sound, and the first song we recorded with that was ‘Born In The USA’.”<br>
<br>
Out Of Order<br>
<br>
“In those days, Bruce had a particular way of teaching the band a new 
song. He wouldn’t play it for them from the beginning to the end; he 
would teach them the different parts of the song, and not necessarily in
 the order that they appeared. So, he might start off by saying, ‘Well, 
there’s this part,’ and play them a little bit of the chorus, showing 
them the chord changes. After that, he might say, ‘Then there’s this 
part,’ and play them the bridge, and follow this with ‘And then there’s 
this part,’ and play them a verse. While the guys would be making notes,
 he might say, ‘Then there’s this part, which is like an 
intro-instrumental thing,’ and if there was any other part, such as a 
solo, he’d teach them that, too. Then he’d ask, ‘Everybody got that?’ 
and if they did, he’d say, ‘OK, we’re going to start with the second 
part I showed you and then go to part number four. We’ll play that 
twice, and then we’ll go to part number one before going back to part 
number four, then on to part number three, back to part number four, 
back to part number one, then part number three again, then part number 
four, and then number one, number one and we’ll ride out on one...’ 
They’d be like, ‘Huh?’ and he’d go, ‘All right, you want to run through 
it?’ while the guys were scrambling to understand exactly how the song 
should be laid out.”<br>
For his part, Toby Scott was able to understand Springsteen’s modus 
operandi when the latter explained that, were he to teach the musicians a
 song from beginning to end, they’d immediately know all the chord 
changes as they transitioned from one section to another, probably 
resulting in contrived licks and less spontaneity. What he wanted to 
capture were those moments of inspiration that might emerge during the 
early takes, and such was the case with ‘Born In The USA’. After 
explaining the structure, Springsteen went to his booth and set the 
tempo while his fellow musicians played through their parts. Then, once 
everybody was ready, Scott rolled tape and take one was recorded.<br>
“I was in the control room, listening through my Yamaha NS10s at a 
reasonable volume, and then Chuck asked me to put it up through the big 
speakers,” Scott recalls. “So, that’s what I did, and I remember 
listening to it and going, ‘Wow!’ Right from the start, the snare drum 
was exploding, and you have to remember this was 1982, when we were in 
the middle of disco-land there in New York. There were no exploding 
snare drums in New York — there were no exploding snare drums anywhere —
 and then, what with Danny’s synthesizer playing that grand intro, the 
song was just cracking away and I turned to Chuck Plotkin and Jon Landau
 and said, ‘I don’t know whether it’s Bruce, but man, it sounds good to 
me!’ They agreed.<br>
“I’d gotten a good cue mix for everybody, so they all could hear it, and
 the takes were like 10 minutes long. On the final cut there’s a rather 
long ride-out, but it was even longer and we cut it down by three or 
four minutes. The band just kept playing. There were eight takes of the 
song, take six was the master — thanks to Max perfecting his bass-drum 
pattern — and when the band members came into the control room after the
 first couple of takes and heard the track, they too were going, ‘My 
God, we’ve never heard anything like this before!’ It was totally, 
revolutionarily different-sounding to anything else at that time.”<br>
<br>
All Systems Go<br>
<br>
Thereafter, with a sound perspective that Toby Scott could return to 
every night, the sessions proceeded quickly, with Springsteen delivering
 a steady stream of new songs, and in less than a month he and the band 
had recorded all of the material he felt he needed. About a week was 
then spent on overdubs before, in mid-1982, Scott began mixing the album
 on an SSL console in the Power Station’s Studio C.<br>
“My perception was that the whole thing was moving a little too fast for
 Bruce,” Scott remarks. “All of a sudden, we were mixing a rock record 
that we had only started to work on a few weeks before. Normally, he’d 
spend several months on each record, and so in the middle of mixing he 
had us re-enter Studio A to work on some other songs. He had demoed a 
few of these on a little TEAC four-track back in January, and while some
 were for the band, others were more pared-down, maybe for him to play 
with just a couple of the guys, and one of those — not recorded on the 
TEAC — was ‘I’m On Fire’.”<br>
Recorded with Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan, this moodily atmospheric, 
synth-based rockabilly track would be added to the album and released as
 its fourth single. However, many of the other songs that Springsteen 
had demoed on the TEAC were now given the full band treatment, before he
 quickly opted to go with the original four-track cassette recordings 
and issue them on the Nebraska album. Released in September 1982, this 
had been completed a couple of months earlier while Born In The USA 
remained in limbo. It wasn’t until February 1983 (by which time Toby 
Scott had quit Clover Studios to become a freelancer) that the sessions 
were revived for a week at New York’s Hit Factory. They then resumed 
that May, when Springsteen cut ‘My Hometown’, and continued sporadically
 through the beginning of 1984, when ‘No Surrender’ and ‘Bobby Jean’ 
were both completed.<br>
At this point, after Scott did some rough mixes at the Power Station, 
Bob Clearmountain was recruited to add his magic touch, and while Scott 
was retained as a consultant and sounding board, he considered his job 
largely done until, that May, Jon Landau persuaded Springsteen to 
compose an upbeat “here-and-now song” that could serve as the album’s 
lead-off single. That song, written overnight and recorded the following
 day at the Hit Factory, was ‘Dancing In The Dark’. To date, it is the 
most successful single of his career.<br>
<br>
Born To Run &amp; Run<br>
<br>
Released on 4th June, 1984, Born In The USA was not only the 
best-selling album of 1985 in the United States, but also the one to 
spend the most ever weeks — including its first 84 — on the Billboard 
top 10. In total, it was on the Billboard 200 for more than two and a 
half years, during which it shared another record — having topped the 
chart for four weeks from July 7th to August 4th, 1984, it actually 
spent 18 weeks at number two while Prince’s Purple Rain resided at 
number one, marking the longest period with a fixed top two in the 
history of the Billboard 200. In January 1985, Born In The USA replaced 
Purple Rain atop the chart for another three weeks.<br>
In the process, Bruce Springsteen elevated his status as the 
all-American everyman, and while the title track may have misled those 
who paid no attention whatsoever to its lyrics, the iconic album cover 
that it inspired proved to be equally ambiguous. Shot by Annie 
Leibovitz, this depicted Springsteen from behind in a white muscle shirt
 and blue jeans, set against the backdrop of the US flag. This prompted 
some to assume that he was peeing on the Stars &amp; Stripes, yet the 
man himself firmly denied this, explaining, “We took a lot of different 
types of pictures, and in the end, the picture of my ass looked better 
than the picture of my face... I didn’t have any secret message.”  <br>
<br>
<br>
Drum Miking: East Vs West<br>
<br>
“Los Angeles was really into high fidelity and tube mics, and at Clover 
we had a very good and extensive selection of vintage mics from the ’50s
 and ’60s,” Scott explains. “However, when I first went to New York and 
suggested miking the drums with [AKG] 414s or [Neumann] U87s as 
overheads and a [Sony] C37 on the snare, it was totally out of the realm
 of what people used there. I mean, when people like Tom Dowd and Steve 
Cropper gave me advice, it was a case of ‘Hey, that sounds good!’ Thanks
 to them, I also used U67s on tom-toms, but when I wanted to do this 
during my first gig at the Record Plant the reaction was ‘Huh?’<br>
<br>
“All they had were Shure SM57s, Sennheiser 421s and a few U87s. When I 
asked, ‘Well, how do you record stuff?’ I was told, ‘We put those on 
everything.’ I thought, ‘Wow, I can’t do that. I want some dynamics 
here.’ I was always very much into the dynamics of the individual 
performers, yet dynamic microphones are not all that dynamic because 
there’s an inherent compression that takes place due to the fact that 
you’re moving the capsule around.”<br>
Told that no studios in New York had U67s, Scott subsequently located some that he used, together with 421s, on the bass drum.<br>
“Another part of my drum setup was to create a tunnel by using a second 
bass drum in front of the main bass drum,” he adds. “Since the second 
one had no head and was facing the main one, it didn’t matter whether or
 not you had a head on the regular bass drum. I’d just put a microphone 
in the middle, pointing at the beater, and I got into this extensively 
with [session man] Jeff Porcaro, who was a drumming genius. He taught me
 that if the second bass drum was the same size as the main one and you 
tuned the head on that second one, you could then adjust the distance 
back and forth by a few inches so that it created this sort of 
compression chamber. The result was a great bass-drum sound, and by 
throwing a blanket over the secondary drum you wouldn’t have a lot of 
bass drum leakage in the room mics while still getting a very large, 
open bass-drum sound.”<br>
<br>
<br>
Miking Amplifiers<br>
“At that time, if I recorded each of Bruce and Steve’s electric guitars 
with two microphones, one of those mics would probably have been an 
SM57, positioned about two or three inches from the grille cloth. 
Generally, the actual sound of each amplifier would determine where I 
would point this microphone, not only in terms of angle but also 
position. One starting place is straight on, perpendicular to the grille
 cloth — you can start in the middle of the cone, you can move to 
halfway between the middle and the edge of the cone, or you can be all 
the way out at the edge. Then, the other option is to angle the 
microphone at maybe 30 degrees off perpendicular and move that across 
the axis so that it’s looking straight down the side of the cone and 
pointing at the centre. These were all techniques that Porcaro had 
turned me onto when trying to get the drums to sound thinner or tubbier 
depending on where you pointed that mic along the head, from the centre 
to the rim.<br>
“In addition to the SM57 about two or three inches from the grille 
cloth, often times I would also use a Neumann KM86 about three feet 
back, and both of these microphones would be recorded to one track since
 we were working 24-track.”</div>

Artist confirms Australian studio time with Tom Morello<br>
<br>
Rolling Stone<br>
By DAVID FRICKE<br>
June 24, 2013 <br>
<br>
"I have stuff I'm working on that I'm very happy about," Bruce 
Springsteen said backstage before his June 3rd concert in Milan, Italy, 
during a rare interview for a story about his European tour in the new 
issue of Rolling Stone. He was talking about his plans for the followup 
to the 2012 studio album, Wrecking Ball. "I hate to say, because I don't
 like to be wrong," he added, laughing. "But I have a lot of material. I
 still feel like I'm in the middle of the well."<br>
<br>
Springsteen, whose European trek ends in Kilkenny, Ireland on July 28th,
 has already cut new tracks this year, during the recent Australian leg 
of his world tour. He and the E Street Band – with Tom Morello of Rage 
Against the Machine temporarily subbing for guitarist Steve Van Zandt – 
spent one of their days off in a studio in Sydney. That was a first, 
Springsteen pointed out: "We've never had a recording session during a 
tour in our lives. We did a couple of things that I wanted to put down. 
So that was very exciting. And being with Tommy was exciting. The band –
 Steven, Nils, all those guys – continues to be a source of inspiration 
for me."<br>
<br>
"I always used to say, in the past decades, that I wanted to make more 
records – and I've done that," Springsteen said, noting his recent rate 
of production: six studio albums since 2002's The Rising. "I struggled 
through the Nineties. We weren't playing together," referring to the E 
Street Band, "and I didn't know how we sounded on record. Brendan 
O'Brien" – who produced The Rising, 2007's Magic and 2009's Working on a
 Dream – "gave us that gift. It gave us a rebirth and inspired me, I 
believe, to write more songs. Of course, it was a decade with an awful 
lot going on in the United States and elsewhere."<br>
<br>
Springsteen wouldn't divulge any more specifics on the new album or the 
songs he is writing for it. But he was certain that the momentum from 
his year-long touring with the E Street Band will carry over into his 
next work. "It's ongoing," insisted Springsteen, who has one more 
confirmed show after the European tour, on September 21st at Rock in Rio
 in Brazil. "A week or two later, after stopping, I'm in the studio 
working, making a demo. You stop the performing for awhile, because this
 level of intensity. . . You need a break from it."<br>
<br>
"But this has been a great, tremendously rewarding period of our time 
together," Springsteen said. "This has been the best ten, twelve years 
we've ever had."</div>

				<div class="content">Music: Q&amp;A: Bruce Springsteen on Touring Europe, the E Street Band and a Half-Century of Rock<br>
BY DAVID FRICKE<br>
JUNE 20, 2013 <br>
<br>
<br>
In the new issue of Rolling Stone, Bruce Springsteen gives his first 
major interviews in nearly a year – in the middle of the live action and
 euphoria of his current European stadium and festival tour. Backstage 
before shows in Padua and Milan, Italy, in the middle of writing set 
lists that he will largely ignore once he gets on stage and immerses 
himself in the moods and needs of his audiences, Springsteen, 63, speaks
 at length about the freshened, dynamic state of his E Street Band; the 
powerful, emotional resonance of his songs abroad, from the New Jersey 
tales of the early Seventies to the topical fire on last year's Wrecking
 Ball; the passing of his great friend and saxophonist Clarence Clemons 
two years ago; and the arrival of Clarence's nephew, Jake, blowing those
 iconic licks through his uncle's original horns and taking 
Springsteen's storytelling into a new, reborn phrase.<br>
<br>
"What are the odds that Clarence's brother had a son that played the 
sax, that travelled with Clarence on the road . . . ," Springsteen says 
at one point in Padua, his voice trailing off in amazement. "Jake 
allowed us to deal with Clarence's legacy, to deal with death as it 
plays upon you."<br>
<br>
"You get to remember and rebuild," he goes on, as the 40,000-strong 
crowd outside makes a mighty noise, anticipating showtime. "Something 
has happened through this period of time, in the United States and 
Europe, that greatly deepened our relationship with the audience. Now 
it's a part of our experience together."<br>
<br>
What follows are additional excerpts from those interviews, including a 
notable announcement: Next year, Springsteen celebrates his 50th 
anniversary as a live performer and working musician. This is how he got
 there.<br>
<br>
Foreign Affairs<br>
<br>
How would you describe the reception you get in Europe?<br>
It's fascinating. We played in Naples. It was only the second time I've 
played in southern Italy. We were about 30 minutes from where I'm 
actually from, Vico Equense [where Springsteen's maternal grandfather 
was born]. I'm only one full generation away from these people I'm 
playing to. And they were incredible, not hidden at all. There is an 
emotional openness that is rare in the States.<br>
<br>
Why do the songs on 'Wrecking Ball' resonate so strongly with European 
audiences, given the Stateside conditions addressed in the lyrics?<br>
The last time we played Ireland – we noticed they were going through 
very hard times. "Jack of All Trades" was a big song there. They were 
right in the middle of what that song is about. But generally, it's not 
an intellectual experience. The nice thing is the songs fall in the body
 of the show. It extends your story down the road. And if you get a 
chance to sit with individual fans and talk about it, it kind of comes 
out there.<br>
<br>
They are not issues that are easily ignored. But I've been writing about
 these things for so long now. It's been a conscious 30, 35 years. And 
it was before that, sort of naturally. The fascinating thing, when we 
come over here, is the band is so fundamentally American. We have a very
 generous audience. They are interested in the ideas that we're talking 
about. Maybe it's because it's somewhat exotic. But there is a level of 
interest. People are politically conscious.<br>
<br>
Have your recent European tours played a part in extending the life of 
the E Street Band? You keep coming here at a time when, for many bands 
of your vintage, doing the States is like repeating a cycle.<br>
We have one simple idea – we are on the planet to do it for you one more
 time. [Laughs] What happened yesterday or the year before or 30 years 
ago – we hope we did a good job then. But we are here to do it for you 
one [pauses] more [pauses] time. We're trying to write one more song 
that's going to mean something to you, the way I hope some of my earlier
 music connected. And we're here to play one more show that feels like 
tonight was the greatest night we ever played. That's just a road-dog 
code of honor. We're not out here to pass the time.<br>
<br>
The Big Band Era<br>
<br>
So this is not a summer vacation.<br>
No. The thing that has always served our band is I had a delivery system
 that was unique. I go back to the very beginning. I was signed to a 
record label at the same time as my friend Elliot Murphy, who makes 
great records to this day. I was signed along with Loudon Wainwright 
III, John Prine.<br>
<br>
The so-called New Dylans.<br>
But I was the wolf in sheep's clothing. Because I had spent eight or 
nine years in that hard-core bar-band experience, before I signed a 
contract. I played in front of every conceivable audience you could 
face: an all-black audience, all-white, firemen's fairs, policemen's 
balls, in front of supermarkets, bar mitzvahs, weddings, drive-in 
theaters. I'd seen it all before I ever walked into a recording studio.<br>
<br>
<br>
You need two things to remain very, very present. You need to continue 
to write well and engage yourself in the issues of the day. And you have
 to continue to make good, relevant records. People say, "I have the 
record from 20 years ago. I don't need the new one." No, you need to 
make records where if people are interested in your world, then they 
need the new one. Because there is something new in it.<br>
<br>
You have also toured for the last year and a half with a new, very large
 E Street Band, with horns, extra singers and percussion.<br>
The Seeger Sessions band – I incorporated some of the things from that. 
Then when Clarence passed away, we were fortunate that Jake was there. 
And I have not toured with a horn section since the late Eighties. So it
 was, "Let's give that a try." There is a range of expression over the 
course of a night that divides, very specifically, this band from 
previous E Street Bands. It's a real re-thinking of what the band is.<br>
<br>
Does it free you as a performer, having that armory behind you?<br>
I had a ten-piece band when I was 21 years old, the Bruce Springsteen 
Band. This is just a slightly expanded version of a band I had before I 
ever signed a record contract. We had singers and horns.<br>
<br>
How did you pay them?<br>
That was the problem. Paying and travelling were impossible. I think we 
might have played a dozen shows. We travelled in the back of a Hertz 
truck – with the equipment [laughs]. It didn't last long. The band went 
back to being five pieces. But the idea was there. And I can afford it 
now.<br>
<br>
But the point is the band and the live performance as a tool of 
rejuvenation. It keeps your music alive, vibrant, present. That has been
 of tremendous value to us. It just stirs it to life, every single 
night. You can't underestimate that particular power.<br>
<br>
50 Years and Counting<br>
<br>
You talk a lot about the "we". What about the "me" feeling, the life 
force for you? You've been doing this since the mid-Sixties.<br>
It's actually 50 years next year [laughs].<br>
<br>
Doesn't that seem extraordinary to you?<br>
I'm not sure I envisioned it at the time. When I started, I was 14 and 
1/2. I remember there was a circle of guys on the beach every Sunday. I 
said, "I'd just like to play well enough to sit in that circle. All I 
want to do is play well enough so on a particular Sunday, I can sit in 
that circle of guys and play along." It was 19 or 20 guys. They'd play 
"La Bamba," "Twist and Shout."<br>
<br>
<br>
Guitars and bongos?<br>
That's all it was, on the main beach in Manasquan [New Jersey]. Then I'd
 go see bands. I'd watch the guy who stood in the back, the 
rhythm-guitar player. "I'd just like to be that guy. I'd just like to be
 there – know some chords, give me my spot. Let me be good enough just 
to be a part of it." That was my dream.<br>
<br>
And I followed it. And it turned into a life, one I wouldn't have had 
the courage to imagine when I was young. But piece by piece. . . So now,
 it doesn't seem strange that I have been doing it for 50 years.<br>
<br>
It's what I do. And what do I do? I live to do it for you one more time 
[laughs]. That's what seems natural to me. What I can't imagine is not 
doing that. That's your primary life force. I go back home after a tour,
 what am I thinking about? "What story needs to be told? What do I have 
to say of urgency to a 15-year-old kid, or a 70-year-old guy, out 
there?"<br>
<br>
That is an appetite. It's like breathing. It's not something I have to 
work on. And it doesn't strike me as work. It's just an adventure. I'm 
always looking for that next line, that next song.<br>
<br>
It's the old Dylan line: "He who is not busy being born. . ." I live by that one a lot.<br>
<br>
Everyone misses Clarence so bad I loved him with the E street band so 
happy that his son is getting to play with them! The Boss always puts on
 a great concert!</div>

Hard Rock Calling 2013</strong><br>
<br>
By Bernadette McNulty<br>
London Daily Telegraph<br>
July 2013<br>
<br>
For rock fans, a trip to the Hard Rock Calling festival on the same 
weekend The Rolling Stones were playing at Glastonbury might have seemed
 like a consolation prize. But, as it turned out, what they really got 
with Sunday night's headliner, Bruce Springsteen, was a Willy Wonka 
golden ticket.<br>
If this was an attempt to rewrite the history of Springsteen's London 
gig last summer, when fans braved ankle-deep mud in Hyde Park only to 
see his duet with Paul McCartney cut off mid-encore, then it succeeded. 
The setting, a pop-up venue on the site of the old Olympic basketball 
arena, wedged between empty blocks of athletes' flats and the 
Pringle-shaped curve of the Velodrome, couldn’t have been more different
 from the royal park. The hard, concrete floor may have been carpeted 
with artificial grass, but it was difficult to disguise the fact that 
this was a gig being held on a building site. Yet with all those solid 
surfaces, and speakers cranked up to top volume, the sound, finally, was
 perfect and, as if in collusion, the sun stretched out above to create 
an almost perfect setting.<br>
Support band, the Black Crowes, responded in kind with a short yet sweet
 set of pure Muscle Shoals soul rock. Mocked as anachronistic rock 
revivalists when they emerged during the grunge boom of the early 
Nineties, their commitment to midcentury southern grooves now makes them
 seem like retro-pioneers. Mick Jagger may have thanked Otis Redding but
 it was lead singer Chris Robinson, looking like he was wearing the same
 shirt and flared jeans he wore the last time I saw him nearly twenty 
years ago, who really conjured up the legend’s sprit in his still 
blistering cover of Hard to Handle.<br>
Springsteen’s take on rock was no less joyful, celebratory and, to my 
surprise, funky. When you know someone is going to deliver a three hour 
set, it comes as a bit of shock when they come out all guns blazing. As 
the E Street Band tore through Badlands, Prove it All Night and Johnny 
99 I wondered how on earth they were going to keep this up, but also how
 on earth I was going to keep this up, dancing on this unforgiving 
AstroTurf without my back or knees giving way? But Springsteen goads and
 shames you on with his own stunning filibuster of a show. Never have I 
seen a rock star’s face so burnished with bliss at the joy of performing
 and his band partied around him like they were having their own New 
Orleans’s carnival.<br>
But the real shock and joy came when Springsteen announced he was going 
to play the whole of his landmark Eighties album Born in the USA. For 
old fans and the large contingent of twenty and thirtysomething 
newcomers, this was as good as it got. A magical hour went by as the 
65-year-old used the brilliance of his band and his weathered voice to 
find new depths in those classic songs. He topped it off by bringing out
 his mum to serenade her during Dancing in the Dark, in place of 
Courtney Cox, followed by his little sister. It felt like the Olympic 
Park was still a place where magic exists.</div>

<br>
 Bruce Springsteen, Stadium of Light, Sunderland</strong><br>
<br>
The River? It's the Wear... Bruce's anthems rock rainy Sunderland<br>
"Who needs 75 degrees and sunny?" asked Bruce Springsteen as he bounded 
into Sunderland football ground in the rain last night, looking almost 
distastefully tanned and fit for a man in his 63rd year. “This is what I
 want in Sunderland.”<br>
There must have been 40,000 soggy people in the stadium who begged to differ, but then again you don’t argue with the Boss.<br>
Still, there had been moments before the concert when it had seemed as 
if the fog would make it all but impossible for anyone beyond the golden
 circle to see the stage. In the end, the weather abated and Bruce 
rocked for close to three hours to an adoring crowd.<br>
Mixed in with classic tracks such as “Born to Run”, “The River” and 
“Thunder Road” were a healthy number from Springsteen’s latest album 
Wrecking Ball, which, like Born in the USA and The Rising, has come 
close to encapsulating the spirit of contemporary America, if not the 
Western world.<br>
Despite selling in excess of 120 million records and collecting more 
than 20 Grammies, Springsteen remains a credible figure in the eyes of 
his fans.<br>
Sure, he is probably as cushioned as any other mega-bucks rock star with a back catalogue stretching back four decades.<br>
But his latest work offers a heartfelt indictment of capitalism’s 
current failings and the hard times it is bringing on both sides of the 
Atlantic to those required to work for a living. Tracks such as “We Take
 Care of Our Own”, “Jack of All Trades” and particularly “Death to my 
Hometown” stand up against anything in his repertoire.<br>
Here, on the site of the former Wearmouth colliery where 2,000 men once 
hewed coal before it closed, his fables of shattered communities, 
blue-collar angst and shut-down factories have particula rresonance. 
Springsteen offers extraordinary value to his diehard fans.<br>
A virtuoso performer he scuttles about the runaways like a man 40 years younger. The 14-piece E Street Band is formidable.<br>
Springsteen has said he will not support anyone in this year’s US presidential race.<br>
Artists have to be “canaries in the mine”, he said. It is an admirable idea but the world – and Barack Obama – need him now.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Music review: Bruce Springsteen's Hard Rock Calling show was a three-hour masterclass in rock<br>
<br>
Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London<br>
JAMIE MERRILL <br>
Yje Independent (UK)<br>
July 1, 2012.<br>
</strong><br>
Last summer when Bruce Springsteen played Hard Rock Calling at Hyde Park
 the curfew police pulled the plug on him halfway through a rather 
cringe-worthy version of "Twist and Shout" with Paul McCartney, the 
weather was dire and the battered ground resembled a quagmire of 
mid-1990s Glastonbury proportions.<br>
This year at a new venue in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park there was 
no Beatle, a later curfew and with the sun setting over the Olympic 
velodrome, the perfect opportunity for Springsteen to make amends with a
 three-hour power-drive through his back catalogue. Sadly the dusty and 
stone-filled venue failed to live up to the rose-tinted Olympic memories
 of the site and even the £600,000 “easigrass” surface (basically a fake
 lawn) failed to stop the place feeling like a bit of building site.<br>
If Springsteen, 63, had noticed this he didn’t let on though as the 
ever-expanding E Street Band launched off with a smattering of tracks 
from his latest album, including a power-charged "Shackled and Drawn", 
before diving into his past for a sombre "Badlands" and bringing an 
orchestral feel to "Johnny 99".<br>
At his recent Wembley gig the rocker played the entirety of Darkness on 
the Edge of Town. At the Olympic Park we were treated to the Born in the
 USA album in its entirety as he brought his 87-year-old mother on stage
 for "Dancing in the Dark" as well as his younger sister Pam on guitar. 
In true ageing-rocker style he even called out a young fan, hoisted her 
on his shoulders and handed her the microphone to join him in an 
uplifting "Waitin’ On A Sunny Day". This should have been cheesy and had
 us wincing but Springsteen is master of life-affirmation and knew 
exactly how to press the crowd’s buttons.<br>
His three-hour masterclass in rock verged on hero worship at times, but 
that’s the brilliance of Springsteen. He may be a showman but he also 
has the human touch, the ability to create intimacy and put you at ease 
in his company, despite the 50,000 odd other fans dancing around you.<br>
And as the light faded, the beer flowed and the crowd swayed, he called 
on us to feel it from our “sexual organs” before taking us closing his 
barnstorming journey through Springsteen’s America with an emotionally 
charged encore of "Jungleland", "Born to Run" and "American Land". He 
finished – without interruption this time – with "My Lucky Day". The 
venue might have been a let-down but the crowd seem to agree with his 
sentiment</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Music review: Bruce Springsteen proves he is still The Boss with epic Wembley Stadium set<br>
The Independent (UK) <br>
Wembley Stadium, London<br>
ENJOLI LISTON<br>
 JUNE 17, 2013</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Few fans are quite as devoted as Springsteen’s. The booming sound 
emanating from the 71,000-strong crowd gathered at Wembley Stadium to 
see The Boss - the first time he played the venue (now in its new 
incarnation) for 25 years - is the familiar guttural chant of “Bruce” 
reserved only for one of the kings of Americana.<br>
And what a reward these fans received. Beginning with "Land of Hope and 
Dreams", it was a night that few Springsteen die-hards will ever forget.
 Running down to the crowd, with a grin plastered across his age-defying
 63-year-old face, Springsteen gathered up requests written on signs 
held up by the front rows, which led to such rarities as "Save My Love" 
and "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)", all performed with trademark command 
and vocal passion, though the best of the mammoth three-and-half-hour 
set was yet to come.<br>
With little ceremony, Springsteen announced that he and the E Street 
Band – including Steve Van Zandt, his best friend from all the way back 
to the beginnings of the New Jersey rock scene, and the man who dubbed 
him ‘The Boss’ - would perform a complete rendition of the 1978 album 
Darkness on the Edge of Town, an inarguable classic from rock music’s 
back catalogue and one that he describes as remaining “at the centre of 
who we are”. With touching sincerity, he adds: “We always want to do 
something different for you.”<br>
From "Badlands" to the album’s final track and namesake, the performance
 is a thing of real and rare brilliance, leaving the crowd silently awed
 and euphoric in equal measure throughout it. <br>
An entertainer to the last, "Dancing in the Dark" sees Springsteen 
invite two women up onto the stage (the latter of whom’s child appeared 
to be waving a sign reading ‘dance with my mum for a dollar’), and he 
achieves that rare thing of making such banter funny and touching.<br>
The rendition of "Twist and Shout" builds on this sense of Springsteen’s
 dedication to making sure his fans enjoy themselves (and proves a point
 - it was the song that saw the plug pulled at that Hyde Park gig), but 
it grates – it feels unnecessary for an artist who does not need 
gimmicks. This is only underlined with a magical stripped-back rendition
 of "Thunder Road", yet another delight for a crowd that already 
believed he just couldn’t get any better.</div>

Springsteen has the capacity to stir, inspire and move on the grandest 
of scales without sacrificing his fireside, one-to-one intimacy<br>
<br>
 July 1 2013<br>
The London Evening Standard</strong><br>
 <br>
When the plug was pulled on Bruce Springsteen's set at last year's Hard 
Rock Calling as he and Paul McCartney duetted past the 10.30pm curfew, 
it catalysed the festival's departure to pastures new.<br>
<br>
Last night, Springsteen and his largest ever E Street Band returned to 
Hard Rock Calling, but this time at the Olympic Park. The volume was 
louder and the curfew more generous, although, ironically, Springsteen 
was sipping post-concert cocoa by 10.15pm. A long, long trek to 
Stratford station and TFL's evident surprise that 40,000 souls might 
need transport home were hopefully mere teething troubles.<br>
<br>
Now 63, Springsteen remains the master of the marathon, unpredictable 
outdoor set. Last night, he unfurled the Born In The USA album in its 
entirety; he waltzed with his 87-year-old mother Adele on Dancing In The
 Dark (which also featured his younger sister Pam) and he merged the 
familiarity of a barnstorming Born To Run with the distinctly unfamiliar
 My Lucky Day, never previously played solo and acoustic.<br>
<br>
Part-everyman, part-showman ("I want you to feel it from your sexual 
organs!" he gushed - but primly - at one point), Springsteen can 
transcend the corny like no other. Plucking a child from the audience is
 usually the cheapest of tricks, but Springsteen made it a moment of 
life-affirming loveliness by placing her on his shoulders, jogging back 
on stage and handing her his microphone so she could sing Waitin' On A 
Sunny Day.<br>
<br>
Ebbing and flowing, the evening turned into an emotional tidal wave when
 it was most hymnal. Framed by a breathtaking sunset, the new Wrecking 
Ball, the 38-years-old Jungleland and The Rising, Springsteen's sifting 
of the ashes of 9/11, all testified to his capacity to stir, inspire and
 move on the grandest of scales without sacrificing his fireside, 
one-to-one intimacy. That's his gift: nobody does it better.</div>

Book unearths Stasi files to reveal how Communist leaders misjudged their bid to assuage East Germany's youth in 1988<br>
		<br>
Kate Connolly in Berlin <br>
Friday  July  5, 2013 <br>
The Guardian  (UK)</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen said 1988's gig in East Berlin was one of the shows 
that will live with him for the rest of his life. (YouTube)<br>
When Bruce Springsteen turned up in Communist East Germany on 19 July 
1988, it was, according to one fan, a "moment some of us had been 
waiting a lifetime to hear". The US rock star greeted an audience that 
was restless, jaded and sick of being locked behind the Berlin Wall. And
 nothing, as it turned out, was to provide a better outlet for their 
frustration than a rock'n'roll concert.<br>
But it was still a surprise when an estimated 300,000 people from all 
over the German Democratic Republic (GDR) surged into a large field by a
 cycle track to hear him play, while millions more watched the shaky and
 distorted transmission on state television. Historians believe almost 
no young East Germans did not know about it.<br>
Communist authorities, whose regime was notorious for widespread 
censorship, suppression of political opposition and spying on its 
people, had given its youth wing, the Free German Youth (FDJ), the 
go-ahead to book one of the west's most popular musicians in a desperate
 effort to release some of the growing tension. However, the event had 
the opposite effect. "It was a nail in the coffin for East Germany," 
said Jörg Beneke, who was there that day.<br>
Now, in the biggest collection of eyewitness reports, files from the 
Stasi secret police and interviews with Springsteen's entourage, a new 
book has pieced together how the gig inflamed a spirit of rebellion that
 contributed to the fall of the Berlin Wall 16 months later.<br>
"Forget David Hasselhoff," says Erik Kirschbaum, author of Rocking the 
Wall, referring to the actor-singer whose single Looking for Freedom was
 No 1 in West Germany in the spring of 1989 – and who famously claimed 
he brought down the Berlin Wall. "Unlike Springsteen, Hasselhoff didn't 
go to East Berlin to perform, and neither did he call for the wall to 
come down a year before it happened."<br>
The highlight of Springsteen's four-hour concert, in which he played a 
total of 32 songs, was undoubtedly a passionate speech, delivered in a 
creaky but understandable German, that carried a subtle but clear 
political message. "I'm not here for any government. I've come to play 
rock'n'roll for you in the hope that one day all the barriers will be 
torn down," he said to a crowd that erupted, before he launched into Bob
 Dylan's Chimes of Freedom, whose lyrics – about the "city's melting 
furnace … with faces hidden while the walls were tightening" – could 
hardly have resonated more with his captive audience, many of whom the 
crowd waved homemade American flags.<br>
Historians believe Springsteen's gig, far from appeasing people, simply 
made them want more. "Springsteen's concert and speech certainly 
contributed in a large sense to the events leading up to the fall of the
 wall," Gerd Dietrich, professor of history at Berlin's Humboldt 
University, told Kirschbaum. "It made people … more eager for more and 
more change … Springsteen aroused a greater interest in the west. It 
showed people how locked up they really were."<br>
According to Thomas Wilke, an expert on the impact of rock and pop music
 in East Germany, it was the GDR's biggest concert ever. "It was a topic
 of discussion for quite some time afterwards, he said. "There was 
clearly a different feeling and a different sentiment in East Germany 
after that concert."<br>
Among the 80 pages of files Kirschbaum dug up from the Stasi archives 
was evidence that the concert was part of a leadership-sanctioned 
campaign to assuage the country's youth. "They were still reeling from 
incidents in 1987 when police used truncheons and electric stun guns to 
beat back East Berliners who, hungry for some of the fun the west was 
enjoying, had pressed themselves as close to the Berlin Wall as possible
 to listen to concerts by the likes of David Bowie and the Eurythmics 
that were being held just metres away from them in West Berlin."<br>
A year later, before Springsteen's gig, thousands of troops lined the 
wall to keep East Germans at bay as Pink Floyd and Michael Jackson 
played in the west.<br>
The decision to site the Springsteen concert far from the wall, in the 
depths of East Berlin, was a strategic one, to prevent huge crowds 
gathering at the border and – intoxicated by rebellion – sparking an 
impromptu revolution.<br>
One Stasi file reveals how the FDJ sought to justify Springsteen to its 
communist elders, most of whom had no idea about rock'n'roll. "He's 
considered to be at the undisputed pinnacle of contemporary rock music 
in the world today," they said. The file also emphasised the singer's 
working-class roots, stressing how his music included "hard and 
unadorned songs about the shady side of American reality". They also 
tried to make the concert more palatable by misleadingly selling it as a
 charity concert for Nicaragua.<br>
Even now, many who were there that night talk about it as a 
life-changing moment. "There was this underlying sentiment in the crowd 
that night that people didn't want to live behind a wall anymore," 
Andrea Dubois, then a 27-year-old scientist, told Kirschbaum.<br>
"It was gradually dawning on everyone between about 20 and 30 years old 
that things couldn't just continue in East Germany the way they had been
 going. Something had to change. And when Springsteen came, his concert 
fitted right into all that."<br>
But what was so special about Springsteen? Kirschbaum believes East 
Germans tuned into his working class ethic, not least his willingness to
 play for free. The Rolling Stones were also huge and they, too, 
Kirschbaum is certain, could have had a huge impact. "But they wanted 
hard currency, which the East didn't have, so they didn't get there 
until the summer of 1990, once the East Germans had converted their 
ostmarks into deutschmarks."<br>
Years later, Springsteen reflected on the concert himself. "Once in a 
while you play a place, you play a show that ends up staying inside of 
you, living with you for the rest of your life," he said. "East Berlin 
in 1988 was certainly one of them."</div>

				<div class="content">OUR MUSICAL ROOTS-  BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN AND STEVEN VAN ZANDT  -APRIL 2011<br>
<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics"><strong class="text-strong">Thanks to our 
friends at the Underground Garage, this is the official unedited  
transcript of the conversation between Bruce Springsteen and Steve Van 
Zandt originally broadcast in edited form over three episodes in April 
2011.   Here Bruce and Steve focus on their primary influences and in so
 doing give a potted history of Jersey Shore music, trends  and 
influences between 1963 to 1969.</strong></em><br>
<br>
<br>
BS - <em class="text-italics">(playing music from his laptop)</em>- Do 
you know this one ?  This is “Hosanna “by The Darwin’s Theory. Its 
incredible !  At least, it sounds pretty good once it gets going. <br>
<br>
SVZ- Let me guess- its from 1966 ?<br>
<br>
BS- 1965. Lets talk about our actual immediate roots. For me, it’s the 
British invasion. Period- that’s it.  Yes, there were things that lit a 
small fire when I was 9 or 10 –Elvis and all that but that soon past 
because we were young and just kids. But the real explosion was the 
British invasion and literally everything I thought about and wrote 
about came out of that. Period.<br>
<br>
SVZ- Yeah, me to. Up until then you would hear songs and you would like 
them. I remember hearing certain singles like Duke of Earl but I never 
thought of doing it. I never knew anything about the 50’s-nothing. It 
might have been different for you.<br>
<br>
BS- Well, I did see Elvis and so we went out and rented a guitar. I 
didn’t want to buy one because what were the chances of me using it two 
weeks after I got it. I wish I kept it-its probably a 1959 Gibson J200- a
 classic or something. So I brought it home and tried to play it for two
 weeks. But that was it –period –until February 9, 1964. So it was a 5 
year gap from the point of desire  to actual ignition.  The first record
 I bought was an EP by Dusty Rhodes covering four Elvis songs. Remember 
in those days they would make EPs of four top singles that you could buy
 for 59c instead of 99c and you would get four songs instead of two. <br>
<br>
SVZ – So you had no guitar lessons and just started playing ?<br>
<br>
BS- No- I did take a lesson but they were horrible in those days. The 
first thing they wanted you to do was to read music but I needed instant
 gratification. I needed to rock now !  Not later- not after I learned 
the scale; not after I learned those notes with the names. I am not 
buzzing on the B string- I need to make an horrific meal right now ! No 
one could teach me that in those days. Mike Deal, the guy in “Deals 
Music” in Freehold was clueless as to the power of the instrument he had
 in his hands and he had no way of transmitting its significance to an 
incoherent nine year old !   So the whole thing was ass backwards and 
wasn’t going to work but I took a shot at it at nine years old.<br>
<br>
SVZ- Do you remember the singles you purchased in between ?<br>
<br>
BS – I bought the Elvis EP but I don’t remember really buying any 
records before the British Invasion.  I might have bought a couple of 
Beach boys singles during the surf music craze. Maybe Dick Dale 
“Miserlou”  and there was also the Four Seasons. I bought their 
singles-they had incredible productions.<br>
<br>
SVZ – Yeah, “Sherry”, “Big Girls Don’t Cry”. Bob Gaudio and Bob Crewe.<br>
<br>
BS- Yeah- Gaudio and Crewe.  I bought all of those and then I bought 
“South Street” by the Orlons  because I lived on South Street.  “Where 
do all the hippies meet ? South Street”.  That’s my house- there were no
 hippies there-just my Mom and Dad and my kid sister. But that record 
added cache to the address. I also bought “ Don’t hand up for love”.  
The Orlons were cool-they had some great stuff. <br>
<br>
SVZ- That’s part of the Cameo -Parkway gang. Very under rated.<br>
<br>
BS- A great record label. <br>
<br>
SZV- They had all the dance records. Chubby Checker, Bobby Rydell,  Dee 
Dee Sharpe, Mashed Potato Time. They also had the Dovells.<br>
<br>
BS -I also bought James Darins “ Goodbye Cruel World” which I just 
bought again on ITunes the other day to see if it still held the same 
buzz for me. You see, what you are interested in when you are young are 
novelty records.  My kids are interested in novelty records. So at that 
time, there was that strange place where pop records crossed over into 
novelty music. So I bought things like “Purple People Eater” and I spent
 hundreds of my Mother’s dimes trying to hear “Purple People Eater” over
 and over again.  Or Lonnie Donegan- “ Does your chewing gum lose its 
flavor on the bedpost…”  I would stay up all night to hear a Lonnie 
Donegan record.  When I was young, that’s what initially caught my ear. 
  What’s the  first record you bought ?<br>
<br>
SVZ- Mine was “Tears on Your Pillow” by Little Anthony.  <br>
<br>
BS- You started very high end here. That’s  a serious  piece of music. <br>
<br>
SVZ- Yeah, I don’t know why.  And I also remember my Aunt  bought me 
“Poison Ivy” by the Coasters when I was a kid.  The Coasters wrote the 
book on novelty records.  And I bought “the Duke of Earl’, Palisades 
Park ”, You Cant’t Sit Down”, “Bristol Stomp”….<br>
<br>
BS- Philadelphia was influential. We were in New Jersey and we were half
 way to Philly. On our television we got all the New York stations and 
we got 3 and 6 and we also got all the Philadelphia stations. I used to 
see all of the Philadelphia tea shows- Jerry Butler, Steel Pier from 
Atlantic City. Lloyd Thaxton <br>
<br>
SVZ- Its amazing how much rock’n roll was on TV in those days.<br>
<br>
BS – I might have bought a Beach Boys album before the British invasion. All of that stuff was very influential along the Shore.<br>
<br>
SVZ –Lets get to the most important album we ever owned…<br>
<br>
BS –Meet the Beatles<br>
<br>
SVZ –Yes, which we thought was their first album but it was the second. 
But everything changed. That was the beginning. We saw them on Ed 
Sullivan, February 9.<br>
<br>
BS –Oh yeah. That was it. Battle lines were drawn in 68 South Street on February 9, 1964. <br>
<br>
SVZ – And at 263 Wilson Avenue also.  You see I never had the thing of 
wanting to be in the business until that moment. It was the band thing 
that appealed to me. Individuals didn’t appeal to me in the way that I 
wanted to do it. I liked them and I bought occasional records but it 
wasn’t until the Beatles came that it happened. <br>
<br>
BS. That’s right. The folk music boom happened pre –British Invasion. 
That was stirring and I had some interest through my cousin Frankie . 
There was the Hootenanny Show on prime time television and folk music 
became completely main stream and it was huge. My cousin initially 
played the accordion and then bought a guitar and I remember going over 
his house and he was playing the New Christie Minstrels and those groups
 were having hits at the time.  The Roof Top Singers –“Walk right in, 
sit right down” <br>
<br>
SVZ –We had never heard of Bob Dylan.<br>
<br>
BS –No –we had heard the song. Peter Paul and Mary….<br>
<br>
SVZ –Yeah, the most money he had ever made.  That’s how history gets 
made because he later went down to the Byrds rehearsal to talk them into
 doing “Mr Tambourine Man”  which they didn’t want to do. <br>
<br>
BS- I tried the accordion one Christmas- that’s was impossible so I said
 “Forget it”.  So my cousin gave me a lend of his guitar and he gave me a
 book called “100 Greatest American Folk Songs”  and that was the first 
thing I ever tried to play before “Twist and Shout”.<br>
<br>
SVZ- Did you go back to lessons again ?  How did you learn to play chords. <br>
<br>
BS- I went down to Western Auto and bought a $18 guitar . It was barely 
playable but that’s what I scrubbed out all of my early chord 
progressions on. <br>
<br>
SVZ- How did you play it ?  How did you know ?<br>
<br>
BS- At first I didn’t. I just bought it home and played it “as tuned’ 
which was not tuned at all.  So I taught myself a variety of “ear 
things” on a completely untuned guitar.  I then made the mistake of 
taking it to my cousin Frankie who tuned it so now everything I had 
learned was useless. He said, “See where those little dots are ? That’s 
where you put your fingers, you idiot!”  So he gave me the book and I 
went home with the chord charts.   How did you start ?<br>
<br>
SVZ- My mother’s father, Grandpa Lento showed me some songs from his 
village in Calabria.  And we then discovered an acoustic guitar in my 
father’s mother’s attic. So Grandpa Lento started teaching me folk songs
 from Italy. And I got about a year’s jump before The Beatles hit. So I 
was 13. I started taking lessons- “Old Macdonald had a farm”- I learned 
the notes….and the guy said. “Gee, you have natural talent”  And I said “
 Good- Why did I need you for then ?” But I wasn’t interested in “Old 
Macdonald Had a farm”. I wanted to learn The Beatles but that was hard 
to learn.<br>
<br>
BS- It was. In a small town, there was no music school or music teacher 
who even thought about teaching rock’n roll music. You had to learn 
scales, then maybe notes and then I you were lucky, they might teach you
 a chord. <br>
<br>
SVZ- Looking back, what were they actually grooming you for ?<br>
<br>
BS- A wedding band – that’s what they were grooming you for. <br>
<br>
SVZ- So The Beatles hit. What was the first Beatles song you heard ?<br>
<br>
BS- Well, going back to the what they were grooming you for –they were 
NOT grooming you for when lightening strikes. They wanted you to read 
music. They wanted you to be able to sit with other musicians and to 
have a musical language. Whereas rock’n roll was lightening and there 
was no way you could groom someone for that to occur. So there was a 
completely different mind set. <br>
<br>
SVZ- Now that you mention it. I think chords were the last thing you learned.<br>
<br>
BS- You learned notes first. You learned the building blocks of musical 
language first with the idea of learning something in a  sane, 
constructive manner. Whereas rock was the opposite. It was three chords 
 and “.Get me on this now !”  The immediacy of rock was thought of as 
something sloppy.<br>
<br>
SVZ- Its funny how chords were not part of the lessons. Why would you want to play chords ?<br>
<br>
BS- My own kids now –the first thing they learn is chords and start to 
strum a song that they like. But in those days- no. I don’t even want to
 begin to think how long it would have taken to get to the three chords 
of  “Twist and Shout” at the rate I was learning. <br>
<br>
SVZ- Now lets discuss the single record that changed the world. “Twist and Shout” was the first one I heard.<br>
<br>
BS-Me too. <br>
<br>
SVZ- What did you think ?<br>
<br>
BS- My world changed. Literally. I mean it. My world changed. It didn’t 
sound like anything you have ever heard before. When you hear something 
like that, your hair stands on end and on your arms. It has some strange
 and voodoo like effect on you. You can’t figure it out. All I remember,
 is that I heard it in my mother’s car and  I ran straight to the 
bowling alley to call my girl friend . I said to her “ Have you heard 
this song called “I Wanna Hold Your Hand” by The Beatles .  It stopped 
my day when it hit and that was even before I knew what they looked 
like. <br>
<br>
SVZ- It got leaked to radio just after Christmas ’63 and we would see 
them five weeks later on Ed Sullivan. We had never seen anything like 
it.<br>
<br>
BS- It was guitar based in an unusual way. If you think about music at 
that time,with a few exceptions, the self contained group did not exist.
 In The Beatles, everything had to be done with two guitars, bass and 
drums and then the integration of the two guys doing the singing and the
 writing. The sound of “I Wanna Hold Your Hand is fascinating. If you 
remove the voices it is unique of itself. <br>
<br>
SVZ- I guess they were influenced to some extent by the Crickets-that’s 
where they got the name from. But uniquely they also had four lead 
singers and that would prove to be unusual even later. If you look 
through the whole history of rock’n roll there have only been a few 
groups that have that phenomenal harmony. It always came from multiple 
lead singers singing harmony.<br>
<br>
BS- Did you buy the Tony Sheridan records ?<br>
<br>
SVZ- Yes<br>
<br>
BS-Before The Beatles records were available, there were the Tony Sheridan records.<br>
<br>
SVZ- We thought it was them !<br>
<br>
BS- Yes, we did. It was billed “Tony Sheridan and the Beatles”. I guess 
they were backing him. There was a version of “My Bonny”  and “ Ain’t 
She Sweet”<br>
<br>
SVZ- It was confusing there for a while and then, all of a sudden, all 
the singles started coming out. We didn’t know that there first four 
singles were turned down over here. <br>
<br>
BS- I’m glad the first one I heard was “ I Wanna Hold Your Hand” because
 that was for me a nuclear explosion.  What were the other early singles
 ?  “Love Me Do”, I guess?<br>
<br>
SVZ- The first single was “Love Me Do” and then “Please , Please Me”.<br>
<br>
BS- Oh-My God !  Whoa ! Wait a minute.<br>
<br>
SVZ- Yeah-they had it right from the beginning. <br>
<br>
BS- That’s right, I could have  went with those.<br>
<br>
SVZ- Then “From Me To You”<br>
<br>
BS- Oh- that could have been nice. That is still one of my favourite ever records.<br>
<br>
SVZ- And then there was “She Loves You”. That’s no slouch !<br>
<br>
BS_ What ! That was before “I Wanna Hold Your Hand”.  Whoa- we would 
have been alright !  But “From Me To You”  and “Please Please Me” are 
both still two of my favourite ever things. <br>
<br>
SVZ- Del Shannon covered “From Me To You” . He had toured with them and grabbed the song. <br>
<br>
BS- Great version. Fabulous.   What was next ? <br>
<br>
SVZ- The Dave Clark Five were next. <br>
<br>
BS- That’s right. That’s what caught my attention. <br>
<br>
SVZ- They were a very interesting and unique band being a throwback and maybe a little influence on us by having a saxophone.<br>
<br>
BS- They had a little more 50’s element to what they did as a result of 
the saxophone and then they covered “Do You love Me”. But what stood out
 for me was the incredible sound of those records. They were some of the
 best produced “small band” records that I have ever heard. You put 
those records on and they just roar.<br>
<br>
SVZ- It was interesting because a few of the groups-and they were one of
 them- would not make the transition into later 60’s rock success. <br>
<br>
BS- It is interesting. I don’t know why that was. If we looked at it- 
they had a moment which probably lasted a year at best. We tried to play
 “Anyway You Want”  live once and we just couldn’t pull it off. Its such
 an incredible sounding record.<br>
<br>
SVZ- The next big group was actually “Herman’s Hermits”. Again the 
novelty thing comes up again here with Henry the Eighth and it hurt 
their career. I remember Frank Barcelona telling me that their producer 
Micky Most did not want that song released because it would hurt their 
career.<br>
<br>
BS- Well, they got stuck in a situation and had to create endless 
novelty  records.  But things like “I’m Into Something Good” is a 
phenomenal song and they made a beautiful record of it.  They had a lot 
of hits over a short period. <br>
<br>
SVZ- I think Peter went with the novelty factor . I think he had been a 
child actor but in the end this hurt their credibility which was unfair I
 think.  Because they were a terrific band live. But to this day, they 
have trouble getting into The Rock’n Roll Hall of Fame because they are 
not taken seriously. <br>
<br>
BS- It was very connected to the British Music Hall tradition. And it 
was almost a pre-rock throwback. I remember the night I aw them in 
Asbury Park they were the headlining Act  with The Who and Blues Magoos.
  It was a wild night. No one knew that Pete Townshend was going to 
smash his guitar and beat the Hell out of the amps at the end of the 
show. Shock and awe wne t over the Jersey Shore !  We couldn’t quite 
figure out what was going on. <br>
<br>
SVZ- Now- get ready- we come to The Animals.<br>
<br>
BS- They were truly apocalyptic to me. “House of The Rising Sun” is 
still one of the great apocalyptic rock records of all time.  When that 
thing comes on-it is still a very dark and great, great incredible 
record.  And they had a lot of them.  They were also the first real, 
flat out class conscious white rock artists.  “We’ve Gotta Get Out of 
This Place” and “In My Life”  and “Outside looking In”. It was all very 
class conscious pop. It was always pop’s undercurrent-“Down in the 
boondocks”  “The Poor side of town” – it is a recurring them in rock but
 they did something with it. They made it grow up.  “We Gotta Get Out of
 This Place” is a work song. What do they yell ?   “WORK !, WORK !. 
WORK!”. That’s the chant. For me those records are way, way influential.
 Beyond that- way, way up there. To this day it remains. In “Darkness On
 the Edge of Town” in both Prove It All Night” and in “Badlands”, I 
tried to rip off “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood”.  If you play the 
intros side by side, you will see the similarities. That was still my 
model in 1977   <br>
<em class="text-italics"><br>
(Bruce uses guitar to demonstrate the similarities between “Prove It”, “Badlands” and “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood”.</em> )<br>
<br>
BS- So there you –these are songwriters secrets !  I wrote both of them 
on the piano. I flipped them from minor to major. Close-but not close 
enough to give you legal problems !  . Another thing is,  everyone of 
The Animals records had the big presentational opening riff.  It 
announced its presence.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">(Bruce plays the riff to “We’ve Gotta Get Out of This Place”)</em><br>
<br>
BS- they all started off with “Here it comes”.  And Eric’s voice. It was
 never a young man’s voice.  What was he- twenty years old  the time ?  
Where that voice came from at the time, I don’t know.  To me it is still
 one of the great voices of rock’n roll and it took that kind of writing
 to a very mature level.  You cn just go down the list- “I’m Crying”, 
“Don’t Let Me Down”- I love ‘em.<br>
That’s how its done kids- that’s all you need to know.  Go to your 
rooms-find a riff you like –flip it from minor to major-  and you are on
 your way ! <br>
<br>
SVZ- Now- The Kinks and the invention of the hard rock riff.<br>
<br>
BS- “You Really Got Me” - and ironically, it was written on the piano. I
 have privileged insider information on this, having sang on the recent 
Ray Davies record a few months ago. I went to those sessions and I said-
 “ All I want to know is how did you come up with this ?”  (Bruce plays 
the riff)   Ray said- “I wrote it on the piano!”   It was the end of 
some song that Dave had been writing which is why is it goes to “A” 
next, which is a move you would make on the piano but not on the guitar.
 So the ironic thing is that the invention of guitar riff rock began on 
the piano. You have heard that riff played a thousand other times but it
 has never sounded better than on that Kinks record.  We need to find 
out what guitar they was using because in my opinion no guitar has ever 
sounded better than on those early Kinks record like “All of the Day and
 All of the Night”. <br>
<br>
SVZ- They were an interesting mix because they didn’t quite break 
through.  They were quite big and they had four or five hits but they 
had management problems and union problems and immigration problems .<br>
<br>
BS- What the Kinks were unique for was that they combined incredible 
primitivism with sophistication. If you go into the structure of those 
songs <em class="text-italics">(he plays “All of the day and all of the night”)</em> you go through two key changes…<br>
<br>
SVZ- And the melody just blasts through the two changes without regard.<br>
That’s the point where Ray invented the stupid melody.<br>
<br>
BS- Exactly-that’s where you sing the notes of the riff which The Troggs
 then took to fabulously absurd new lengths on many of their records. <br>
<br>
SVZ- And The Kinks manager became their producer. But in lesser hands, 
the “stupid melody “ would have remained stupid but in this case with a 
genius like Ray, it became a primitive cry of desperation. <br>
<br>
BS- they always had an intelligence and sophistication that shone 
through that stuff which was an interesting blend on all of those early 
Kinks records. They truly did have both things- think of “Till The End 
of The Day” – incredible.<br>
<br>
SVZ- Phenomenal. And “Tired of Waiting for You”- such an important song and Dave added that riff on the bottom.<br>
<br>
BS- “Till the end of the day”-<em class="text-italics"> (he plays it on his laptop) </em><br>
<br>
SVZ- The Yardbirds introduced us to a whole new level of guitar playing .<br>
<br>
BS- I had a religious experience related to that recently at the Rock ‘n
 Roll Hall of Fame where I saw Jeff Beck’s Telecaster which for me is 
the Holy Grail. Fo some people it is Hendrix’s Stratocaster or Eric 
Clapton’s Les Paul and Neil’s got the black Gibson but for me Beck’s 
guitar was everything I thought was the essence of the rock’n roll 
guitar post surf guitar .  I used to buy surf magazines just to look at 
the Fender guitar ads . Those magazines would   have  beautiful three 
part adds where they would have color photographs of  a Stratocaster, a 
Jazzmaster and a Jaguar guitar on a double page.  They didn’t even think
 of putting the Telecaster in there because it was the low rent model. 
But they used to put these beautiful guitars on the beach somewhere. and
  I would have thrown out the Playboy magazine just to keep those Fender
 guitar ads which I stared at every night. I had all of the fun I needed
 to have just looking at that thing. Night after night it was like, 
where is a world where a man could own those three guitars. But then 
came Jeff Beck’s guitar because you and I had the luck of going to the 
city and seeing Teddy Spealios who had, at that exact moment,  mastered a
 lot of Jeff’s style and technique so we could go and sit two feet from 
the guitar player and he was incredible. <br>
<br>
SVZ- He was in a group called The Source who recorded as “Kangaroo” and 
they also  included Congressman John Hall in that band. But even though 
we were only two feet  away we couldn’t figure out what he was doing.<br>
<br>
BS –We didn’t know what the Hell was going on.  We came all the way from
 New Jersey on the Lincoln Transit Bus arguing who was better Led 
Zeppelin or Cream.  Two weeks ago I was in the village in that part of 
town where you have dinner and exactly on the opposite corner was where I
 played 45 years ago.  So I said, I am going to go downstairs and see if
 it is still the same and I did and it was EXACTLY the same !  They had 
changed nothing –Steven believe me- it was THE same as it was in 1966 
when we were there. But you know, you and I used to sit in front of 
Teddy and ask him how he got that amazing sound.<br>
<br>
SVZ- Yeah and one day, we worked up the courage to ask him  and he said –“You turn it up “. <br>
<br>
BS- But we didn’t know how to do that because we went straight home that day and we turned it up and it sounded like Hell. <br>
<br>
SVZ- It wasn’t until you found this amazing guitar…<br>
<br>
BS- The first distortion on the Shore !<br>
<br>
SVZ- Yep- Which was actually a bass but we didn’t know it and we used to wonder why the strings didn’t fit. <br>
<br>
BS- I got it from an ex marine who told me he had a guitar in the garage
 . He said “..Its got a long neck but no strings. “  So I said, “It 
looks kinda strange. Its got no strings and only one pick up.  So I put 
the guitar strings on it and the thing that surprised me was that they 
just barely made it on  and you didn’t have to cut them !.   But when I 
plugged that thing in – whoa !   (<em class="text-italics">plays  “Sunshine of Your Love”)</em>  I was suddenly Eric Clapton overnight ! <br>
<br>
SVZ- And the reason was it didn’t have the trebles or the highs to feedback –it could only feedback in a good way !<br>
<br>
BS- Exactly ! So you could turn the damn thing up and it was the exact sound from “Sunshine of Your Love” .<br>
<br>
SVZ- We had hit oil – the Holy Grail !   You played that crazy thing for a long tie  didn’t you ?<br>
<br>
BS- I did. Until a kid came up to me and said, “ That’s cool, man. 
That’s pretty smart- stringing that bass with guitar strings.”  I said, 
“yeah, that’s right…” And I turned away and thought “ Shit –I’ve playing
 the bass guitar for the last year- strung like a bass.”<br>
<br>
SVZ- Major brakethrough  there. Major breakthrough  which led directly to our success today.  <br>
<br>
BS- So The Yardbirds –God – “Heart Full of Soul”- we played the Hell out
 of that. They brought in that Gregorian Chant thing –“For Your Love” 
was amazing.  And of course, “Under Over Sideways Down”, I’m a Man and 
then of course, the ultimate test for any guitar player –Could you play 
“Jeff’s boogie “? And the answer was “No”.  You could fake your way 
through Jeff’s boogie but you could not play it. That was a touchstone 
back in the day. Everybody was taking their axe to that thing. <br>
<br>
SVZ- Yeah – You would slow down the turn table to try and understand how to play it.<br>
<br>
BS –Yeah –I feel sorry for the young guitarists today who don’t have 
turntables .But in the old days, there was a disc that turned and that 
disc could be slowed down to  a variety of speeds -78, 45 and 33 and  
that’s how I learned “Jeff’s boogie”  -at 33 and a third.  (sings it)<br>
<br>
SVZ –Of course, we didn’t realize he was paying two guitars at the time !<br>
<br>
BS –No wonder I couldn’t play it. <br>
<br>
SVZ –Then The Hollies –Is there anything any better than “Look through Any Window ?<br>
<br>
BS – No, no. My God.<br>
<br>
SVZ – One of those riffs that to this day, we would have difficulty playing. <br>
Your using open strings at first and then it modulates. <br>
<br>
BS- That was a problem. Once that modulation hit –you were swimming in deep water. <br>
<br>
SVZ- So for about a year and a half from February 1964 it was all the 
British Invasion until then the Americans took the charts back with The 
Byrds and folk rock. And they introduced Bob Dylan. I guess we always 
knew that it was a Dylan song.<br>
<br>
BS- No –I didn’t  know that “Mr Tamborine Man was a Bob Dylan song.  I did’nt listen to any of the Dylan folk albums. <br>
<br>
SVZ –None ?<br>
<br>
BS –None at all.  The first Dylan record I ever heard was “Like a 
Rolling Stone””.  But I was strictly “hit radio” and hit radio was the 
British Invasion. And the  only folk stuff I heard   was on hit radio at
 the time or  because it was on hit television. I had no other musical 
background.  I was strictly pop charts and I never heard any Dylan music
 until I heard “Like A Rolling Stone”. Later on , I went back and 
listened to all of his records but before that I was strictly top 40 
rock’ n roll music.  You knew when you were hearing “Like a rolling 
Stone” that it had a breath and depth that you just knew it was another 
 revolutionary moment. <br>
<br>
SVZ- In top 40 terms, he was saved by The Byrds because top 40 radio 
would not have played Bob Dylan. He did not have a top 40 voice and I 
think The Byrds sets that up. And then, out of that, all of a sudden 
explodes “garage rock.” Which was a sort of combination of the British 
Invasion and folk rock. <br>
<br>
BS –Another enormous influence on both of us was then  Motown and Stax 
and they go hand in hand with our British influence. In terms of 
arrangments and putting a band together, that’s the other side of the 
scale. <br>
<br>
SVZ – The British Invasion would put a lot of people out of work. Little
 Richard, Bo Diddley and all the pioneers. So ironically, they put their
 own heroes out of work.  <br>
<br>
BS – Mowtown, Stax, The Beach Boys – they survived. <br>
<br>
SVZ –The Beatles and other guys had  hits with some of their songs just 
months after they were released. So soul music survived.  <br>
<br>
BS –The Beatles covered The Marvelettes and Please Mr Postman. The 
Beatles covered a lot of Motown with a tremendous amount of love. <br>
<br>
SVZ – And The Stones did “Hitchhike” and “Can I get A Witness.”  We 
haven’t talked about the Stones yet. And so there is Motown with that 
ridiculous roster of great acts –The Temptations, the Four Tops, Stevie 
Wonder, Marvin Gaye. <br>
<br>
BS –And then the songwriters  -incredible record production and songwriting.  <br>
<br>
SVZ- Whats funny is you go back and look at some of the old TV shows 
which we were very lucky to have so many of- on comes The Beatles 
followed by Marvin Gaye, on come The Stones then come The Chiffons. <br>
<br>
BS- It was that moment when it all co-existed.<br>
<br>
SVZ- everyone of those shows had soul music right there-every other act.<br>
<br>
BS- Absolutely.<br>
<br>
SVZ- And that combination is what we grew up with. And you can hear it 
in our stuff today.  I think that for me, the Rolling Stones were my 
real entry into the business because I saw The Beatles and they opened 
up this whole new world to me but they were so alien and so perfect and 
talented that I never thought I could do that even my greatest fancy. <br>
<br>
BS- when you saw The Beatles you said- “OK- there are four guys in the 
world that can do that. And there they are- that space has been taken. 
But there was something when you saw The Stones- there was something of 
“the wreck” about them.  Ad you said- “Well, maybe ..I don’t know..I 
think I could find a spot there somewhere. “<br>
<br>
SVZ- What was the first Stones thing you remembered hearing ?<br>
<br>
BS- I went out and bought “Not Fade Away” backed with “I Wanna Be Your 
Man”. I hadn’t heard it. I bought it because of the sleeve. I went to 
the first Mall anyone had ever seen (now they would call it a “strip 
mall”) and it was put up just outside of town. We had never heard of 
such a thing so we went out to see what it was. One of the stores was a 
Department and it had a little record shop and I saw that beautiful 
photo of the Stones in their vests. So I took it home. The Stone had the
 experience of not being a success straight away. They were very 
different to The Beatles. They were working stiffs for a while in the 
USA. People either didn’t like them or didn’t know what to make of them.
  They never had that – boom ! – single like “I Wanna Hold Your Hand” 
that was galvanizing straight out of the box. So they had a very 
different introduction to the American audience.<br>
<br>
SVZ – When you look back on it , I don’t remember ever seeing before a 
singer in show business who didn’t smile. I don’t remember ever seeing 
that before. They were serious. The Beatles projected a certain joy as 
did Sinatra and everybody.<br>
<br>
BS- So you are making a pitch that The Stones invented the solemn faced rock star ?   You might be right. <br>
<br>
SVZ- You got a little smile, ironically, from Brian Jones and Keith was 
having a good time but Mick- look at that film clip of “Little Red 
Rooster”  on “Ready Steady Go !”<br>
<br>
BS- You might be right. They had a certain image of themselves  and this
 combined with their comparative lack of early success -came the idea of
 remaining uncompromised.  Blues musicians had very different roots from
 The Beatles in that sense. <br>
<br>
SVZ- Just imagine it- a time when “Little Red Rooster” was a number one hit.<br>
<br>
BS- In the States ?<br>
<br>
SVZ- No, in England.<br>
<br>
BS- That would be right.<br>
<br>
SVZ- But you look at his performance- he was so serious.<br>
<br>
BS- Well, for young people that’s cool.  What do you want to be more 
than anything else ?  COOL !  And do there was a detachment to it- a 
certain imperiousness that, if you were a young man was- yeah- just 
cool.  And they wore street clothes. Before the Rolling Stones no one 
wore street clothes.<br>
<br>
SVZ- There you go. <br>
<br>
BS- that was revolutionary. The battles we had with our first manager, 
Tex with our faux snake skin vest and our ruffled shirts…when the Stones
 came along..<br>
<br>
SVZ- It was a good look !<br>
<br>
BS- Yes it was and we probably made a mistake.  I have pictures of me 
dressed outside the Café Noir in a grey striped sweater and immediately,
 the Stones were your visual holy grail. It as saying we are trying to 
bring you something more authentic..<br>
<br>
SVZ- And it was less intimidating to a kid because show business is intimidating .<br>
<br>
BS- And the idea that you have to dress up. In forty five years I have 
never worked that out !   I used to say that I just can’t dress up- I 
don’t know how to do it. We took the shirts off and it was done for the 
next forty years.<br>
<br>
SVZ- The Who- For me their first album remains their best album. Its amazing. <br>
<br>
BS- Its’s a hell of a sounding record man. Its explosive-its combustible-the sound of those few instruments-amazing.<br>
<br>
SVZ- A whole new composition of how instruments sounded. Never had drums
 been part of the composition with Keith Moon. But aside from that, 
starting with their second album, Pete Townsend invented the concept 
album. Now I have come completely full circle on that and we only play 
three minute records on here.<br>
BS- The thing about The Who that has always fascinated me was the 
incredible violence of the instrumentation complete with beautiful Beach
 Boys harmonies. I wonder how much was Keith Moon’s influence because he
 was the Beach Boys freak. I wonder how that happened in the studio 
because it was a beautiful characteristic of those early recordings. You
 have the violence of the instruments combined with those wonderful 
squeaky Brian Wilson harmonies. <br>
<br>
SVZ- That’s true. I asked Roger Daltry  about that first album and I 
said “Roger, you sing differently on that” And he said, “ Well, `I was 
just trying to sing like Johnny Cash”.<br>
<br>
BS- Really ? <br>
<br>
SVZ- And if you do listen to that first album, the singing is very low.<br>
<br>
BS- `(sings<em class="text-italics"> )  “the good’s gone…”  </em>That’s low. I never saw the association but now that you mention it. <br>
<br>
SVZ- Yeah – that violent vocal with that stoic deep lead vocal. He known
 for being a little bit histrionic later with that “Won’t Get Fooled 
Again” type of vocal but here he was very serious and –well, cool. He 
was a mod.<br>
<br>
BS- Yeah and once again, the perfect rock record of “I Can See For 
Miles”. It doesn’t get any better than that. I was completely into that 
first record because we were seeking out anything at the time but –wow- 
“I Can See For Miles” is a fantastic record.<br>
<br>
SVZ- Lets get into the next generation -this is only a year after the 
British Invasion  and this is the garage rock years that started in 65 
and went to about 67. I remember you played some unusual songs with your
 band.<br>
<br>
BS- Lets talk about “Them”. You see, we busted our ass in a battle of 
the bands to get the key slot as support act for “The Rascals” and we 
played our show stopper which was “Mystic Eyes”. We kicked the Hell out 
of that thing. Yet this was a cross over moment on the Jersey shore 
because there were a lot of  Doo wop acts still there.  But I was a huge
 “Them “ fan.<br>
<br>
SVZ- How did you discover them because they didn’t have that many hits 
in the America  if any. The Shadows At Night  at covered “Gloria” and 
had a hit with it.<br>
<br>
BS- I used to buy things on instinct. I think I did that. I might have 
liked the cover. I bought Steve Earl’s “Guitar Town” when I saw the 
title. – “I’m having that- and took it home ! ”.    But Them also had 
“Here Comes the Night” with that great riff- I loved that record.  And 
then the phenomenal cover of “Its All Over Now, Baby Blue”. <br>
<br>
SVZ- And then they had the great garage classic “Gloria” which together with “Louis, Louis” are THE garage anthems.<br>
<br>
BS- Oh yeah- if you didn’t play it you would not get out alive. If you 
couldn’t play it, you couldn’t get a gig.  They would ask you if you 
could play a certain handful of songs like “Satisfaction” and “Gloria” 
and if you couldn’t play them, you didn’t get hired. <br>
<br>
SVZ- I think their ultimate moment was  “I Can Only Give You Everything”.<br>
<br>
BS – Oh Man ! <br>
<br>
SVZ- It wasn’t a hit. Who knows how that can not be a hit ? <br>
<br>
BS – I think it was too aggressive. It had that wild fuzz Gibson Maestro
  Fizz Tone which gave you the sound of a kazoo on hallucinogenics.  <br>
<br>
SVZ- That was commercial after “Satisfaction” –look at the “Psychotic Reaction”. <br>
<br>
BS – That was the sound. That’s why is should have been a hit. <br>
<br>
SVZ- Maybe “Management” again.  Anyway, we did also get the blues sound 
from England as well but over here we also had groups like Paul 
Butterfield and they were very important. Mike Bloomfield and that…<br>
<br>
BS- Well, I think you had your first wave –the Stones and those guys to 
hip everyone to the blues which 15, 16 and 17 year old kids knew nothing
 about. I knew absolutely noting about  the blues and had no connection 
with it until it came through The Rolling Stones. Then there was your 
second wave like Mike Butterfield and Mike Bloomfield and people who 
studied  it and loved it. And the Blues Project.<br>
<br>
SVZ- And Taj Mahal.<br>
<br>
BS- And that was when we went back and got into Muddy Waters and Howlin 
Wolf. And suddenly we went back and studied all the original blues 
artists and we covered them as best we could.  Of course –you were one 
of the first artists on the Jersey shore who played in a regular blues 
band and also in a country rock band.<br>
<br>
SVZ- Its hard to imagine now but things changed very quickly in those 
days and in a very short period of time. Over six months or so an 
entirely new trend would come in and we would follow it because we 
didn’t know who we wanted to be.<br>
<br>
BS- You were exposed to music both new and pre-existing in such a 
condensed period of time. I’d say between 64 and 69  what happened was 
that you went backwards and forward in time and every year was a 
completely different development. If you had the same band, you would 
have moved on to a completely different type of material in a short 
time. <br>
<br>
SVZ- Or you would have a different band .<br>
<br>
BS- Yes- In my band “The Castiles” we had an unusual situation going 
because we were together for three years which was an enormously long 
time to be together with the same guys. But we went from the early 
British groups to when we were over acid rock and The Doors.  There was a
 moment when, guess what ?  Everybody had to find a keyboard player. 
Initially you did not because all the groups on the Shore were guitar 
based. But probably because of The Animals and Alan Price and suddenly 
you needed an organ. You had to get some guy who had thrown out that 
friggin accordion and had a mother who would be him a Farfisa !   Then 
you had to get the B3 –which was a monster –you had to carry that thing !<br>
<br>
SVZ- But very few people could afford one. <br>
<br>
SVZ- You saw it was The Rascals, and the Spencer Davis Group  -the “Give
 Me Some Lovin” riff.  Mitch Ryder oddly enough, featured it on the 
records but not live.<br>
<br>
BS- The answer is really simple. There were two types of instruments. 
One kind was meant to travel while the other kind was meant to sit in 
the corner in your Church or your home and not move at all.  In other 
words, it was furniture and suddenly you were in the friggin furniture 
moving business. When I was with Steel Mill I busted my ass carrying B3s
 up and down stairs of clubs all over the United States from the late 
60s to the early 70s .  If the organ wan’t bad enough, you had to lug 
the Leslie which was like  a refrigerator.  So along with your guitar 
and amps you were playing with the accoutrements of your living room !  
 The B3 sounded great but it was a bitch. <br>
<br>
SVZ- The fashion part of rock n roll was extremely important.  Neil 
Young wearing that old Western jacket in Buffalo Springfield- iconic, 
man.  It was the old west-it was rock. <br>
<br>
BS- I saw that a week ago in Cleveland. That place is a fetishist’s 
dream. The spirit power of those items – Jeff Beck’s guitar or a certain
 jacket holds a mystical power that holds me to this day.  If I go up 
there and I see the notebook sheet for “The Night They Drove Old Dixie 
Down” because in the end it’s a magic act because you are taking 
something out of the air and making it physical and its real. So the 
physical totems of it –the shoes or the jackets –they old such unusual 
power in your imagination. <br>
<br>
SVZ- Because what we communicate is more than just the music. It is the lifestyle,  the attitude.<br>
<br>
BS-  I was reading an essay on Tolstoy the other day. But it applies to 
music as well. A great record just makes you love life. And at the end 
of the day that’s what we are trying to pass on. The richness of  
experience and getting in touch of that part of your self that loves 
life. <br>
<br>
SVZ-  The psychedelic era was largely a West Coast thing.  We were 
prejudiced against it at first in my neighborhood.  I think you 
appreciated it quicker.<br>
<br>
BS- I appreciated it enough to go out and buy a smoke bomb and a vase of
 flowers. I bought a strobe light, and at the school dance at St Rosa 
High School I turned  it on, and I set off my smoke bomb and I then got 
up on my amp and smashed the vase of flowers at the end of the evening. 
 And the teachers said , “Thank you Bruce, that was……very nice”.  People
 were transformed that night, I tell you. <br>
<br>
SVZ- But we never really understood the rise of so called progressive music. <br>
<br>
BS- No. But the point was that you had been originally hired as a dance 
band for a few years and with the rise of the psychedelic era, it became
 “a concert” or music to be listened to. It was a different experience. 
That was quite revolutionary locally. For years, the people came into 
the venue and stood in front of the band and danced. Now, they came into
 the venue and sat in front of the band and sat down. <br>
<br>
SVZ- And then with that music came the drug culture which had the effect of closing down venues.<br>
<br>
BS- Yes, when we were 16 or 17 there were five or six venues where we go
 and play dance music. All High school dances were live bands with 
singers and speakers !  There were surf clubs and all of that.. There 
was Freehold, Middleton and Asbury Park . There were two teen clubs 
operating in Freehold on a weekend- the Left foot and The Hullabaloo. I 
was at the beach last year  and ran into the drummer from the Chevelles 
and he would sing one song a night without a microphone. He would get up
 just shout it out  into the gymnasium. It was a mighty effort !  You 
had to have a microphone and you had to have a PA system. Previously, 
you just needed amplifers but you wouldn’t hear a word out of them all 
night except (Bruce plays surf music on his guitar) –Pipeline and all 
the rest-huge hits and all rock instrumentals. <br>
<br>
SVZ- I guess it was a big, big moment when – I guess it was a liitle bit before The Beatles but that really was the fault line. <br>
<br>
BS- Oh yes- and once the singing started. If you didn’t sing, you were 
out of a job. That was it- you went home and it all happened within the 
space of a month or so. And it was the bands from overseas that caused 
it. <br>
<br>
SVZ- Things happened so quickly in those days. And most of the sax 
players, if they didn’t have a singer-they were out of work. Because up 
to that moment, every band had a sax player. Every record had a sax 
solo.  <br>
<br>
BS- And locally- the Motiff- there was Walter from out your neck of the woods up Middletown.<br>
<br>
SVZ- Johnny Wisedorf and The Rogues.<br>
<br>
BS – That’s right and The Mods.-they brought the singer in. <br>
<br>
SVZ-  The last surprise the sixties had for us was that the psychedelic 
 area would yield groups Traffic and Procol Harum, Jimi  Hendrix who 
became the force of the big four – Page, Beck, Clapton and Hendrix. I 
remember walking down the street with you here in the Village  and we 
had no idea how Hendrix did what he did.<br>
<br>
BS- There was no precedent for it. Not even Link Wray did that. You were
 at a loss. There was a moment when you said- “Ok-the weekend is coming.
 How am I going to make that sound ?”  You had your fuzz tone but it 
really didn’t really quite work.<br>
<br>
SVZ- I guess that the end of the decade would coalesce into Hard Rock 
with Cream, the Jeff Beck Group which we should talk about because in 
its day it was one of the greatest things I have ever seen.<br>
<br>
BS- In any funny way, things gravitated slightly back towards the 
instrumental. You would certainly say that with those two groups that 
you just mentioned, the thing you think about is the playing. You don’t 
necessarily think of the songs, even though there were some great songs.
 The return of the guitar hero was return, at least to some degree, to 
the instrumental.<br>
<br>
SVZ- With the Jeff Beck group’s introduction of Rod Stewart as vocalist 
you had the birth of the singer/guitarist relationship that would be the
 model for every hard rock group since including Led Zeppelin who pretty
 much copied that model a year later.  We all knew Rod Stewart was 
black- we didn’t think he was black- we knew it !  We never heard anyone
 sing like that and when you combine that with Jeff Beck- that was quite
 a band.<br>
<br>
BS- That was a tough game !   You know, what have we discussed- about 
six a year period and what’s that ?  The difference between 2006 and now
 ?  You know what I’m saying ?  We lucked out because we were around at 
the invention of something. When you think about it, we have been 
musicians throughout all this time from the British Invasion and right 
through to Pink Rock with the reinvention of amazingly vital bands and 
it has been a great period to be alive and to be making music. And the 
stuff that happens between the ages of 14 and 20 –those are imprinted on
 you. It’s the fundamental vocabulary of what we have done. You add to 
it something that may have come from the 1920’s or the 2010s  - well, it
 all just makes you happy to be alive  and want to pick that guitar up 
and play boy play !   And that hasn’t changed.  Well listen, we have 
been talking about sitting down and talking about our main influences  
for the past two or three years and its been fun doing with with my life
 long compadres,  Little Steven who has been a pal for me to journey 
from the teenage years when the world was just sitting around waiting to
 be born. We have been best friends for such a long time to sit down and
 talk about the music that means so much to me and you. I think you my 
friend .  <br>
<br>
SVZ- We needed each other as kids.<br>
<br>
BS- Oh yeah- they thought we were freaks and it was a great privilege.<br>
<br>
SVZ- And you were always inspiring but at the time we got it together, I
 thought it was all over. I thought the renaissance was over and we had 
missed it. And you were the one who knew better. Maybe we can add 
something to that !<br>
<br>
BS- Lets try.</div>
