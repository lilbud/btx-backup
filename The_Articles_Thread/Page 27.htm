Bruce Springsteen <br>
Columbia 35318 <br>
Released: June 1978 <br>
Chart Peak: #5 <br>
Weeks Charted: 83 <br>
Certified 2x Platinum: 7/6/89</strong><br>
<br>
On this long awaited effort, Springsteen eschews the tight dense sound 
of his acclaimed "Born To Run" to put the emphasis on his unique throaty
 singing style. While more sparse, the music is equally powerful, with 
the seven-man band behind Springsteen aided by the studio prowess of the
 producers along with Steve Van Zandt, Jimmy Iovine and Charles Plotkin.
 Springsteen's lyrics continue their exploration of doom and adolescent 
angst as perceived is small New Jersey towns. This is the type of album 
that grows with each listening. Best cuts: "Adam Raised Cain," 
"Factory," "Prove It All Night," "Darkness On The Edge Of Town."<br>

Bonus Reviews!<br>
<br>
"Promised Land," "Badlands," and "Adam Raised a Cain" are models of how 
an unsophisticated genre can illuminate a mature, full-bodied 
philosophical insight. Lyrically and vocally, they move from casual to 
incantatory modes with breathtaking subtlety, jolting ordinary details 
into meaning. But many of the other songs remain low-color pieces, and 
at least two -- "Something in the Night" and "Streets of Fire" -- are 
overwrought, soggy, all but unlistenable. An important minor artist or a
 rather flawed and inconsistent major one. B+<br>

The delayed release of this album served notice that Springsteen, like 
Stevie Wonder, would not churn out product by any set schedule. Three 
years had passed since his previous work, Born to Run. In truth, the gap
 would have been shorter had he not been absorbed for the better part of
 the year in a legal scuffle with his former manager.<br>
<br>
Also like Stevie Wonder, Springsteen did not merely record enough tracks
 to fill an album, but wrote many songs and selected numbers that would 
work together to produce the effect he desired. As with Stevie, some 
numbers were given to other artists, some retained for future albums, 
and several consigned to seemingly interminable limbo.<br>
<br>
The effect Bruce and his producers did create with this album was 
intense and powerful, too strong for AM radio. Though several tracks 
were outstanding, none emerged as hit singles, "Prove It All Night" and 
"Badlands" peaking in the mid-third of the Hot 100.<br>
<br>
In 1987, Darkness on the Edge of Town was chosen by a panel of rock 
critics and music broadcasters as the #59 rock album of all time.<br>
<br>
- Paul Gambaccini, The Top 100 Rock 'n' Roll Albums of All Time, Harmony Books, 1987.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Contractual disputes kept Springsteen out of the studio for a couple of
 years. So when he bounced back after two years of intensive touring he 
had hardened his performance and honed his professionalism. The lyrics 
of these new songs were written from a more mature viewpoint -- teenage 
obsessions replaced by a working man's concerns.<br>
Another Jimmy Iovine/Record Plant recording, Darkness is far tighter and
 "shifts gear" so much more easily than Born to Run. The deliberate 
padding out of the sound is no longer indulged in and the recording sets
 out to capture the band straight-head on.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's screaming delivery in a song like "Adam Raised a Cain" is 
still robbed of much of its impact by the relatively two-dimensional 
recording. The density of sound leaves the album without ebb and flow.<br>
<br>
- David Prakel, Rock 'n' Roll on Compact Disc, 1987.<br>
<br>
From the cover photos to the contents, it's clear that this is the 
statement of a changed man; the boyish beliefs have been supplanted by 
hard won knowledge of the "real" world. (Obviously, reflection of two 
years of court battles with his first opportunistic manager which kept 
him out of the recording studio where he might have capitalized on the 
resounding acclamation accorded Born to Run.) Darkness on the Edge of 
Town echoes with the honed down gritiness of material that reflects more
 the reality than the romance of his beloved road. Highlighted by 
Bruce's painfully potent vocal outpourings and his slashing guitar, it 
includes some of his strongest material, "Promised Land," "Badlands," 
"Adam Raised a Cain" and the title cut. The CD sound is uneven, 
admittedly dynamic and crisp most of the time, it is impaired by 
occasional harshness and audible hiss on the quieter sections. Overall, 
the sound is an improvement over the LP, but would be substantially 
better if there were clearer separations among the various voicings. A<br>

<br>
Coming three years, and one extended court battle, after the commercial 
breakthrough of Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town was highly 
anticipated. Some attributed the album's embattled tone to Springsteen's
 legal troubles, but it carried on from Born to Run, in which 
Springsteen had first begun to view his colorful cast of characters as 
"losers." On Darkness, he began to see them as the working class. One 
song was called "Factory," and in another, "Badlands," "you" work 
"'neath the wheel/Till you get your facts learned." Those "facts" are 
that "Poor man wanna be rich/Rich man wanna be king/And a king ain't 
satisfied/Till he rules everything." But Springsteen's characters, some 
of whom he inhabited and sang for in the first person, had little and 
were in danger of losing even that. Their only hope for redemption lay 
in working harder -- "You gotta live it everyday," he sang in 
"Badlands," but you also, as another song noted, have to "Prove It All 
Night." And their only escape lay in driving. Springsteen presented 
these hard truths in hard rock settings, the tracks paced by powerful 
drumming and searing guitar solos. Though not as heavily produced as 
Born to Run, Darkness was given a full-bodied sound, with prominent 
keyboards and double-tracked vocals. Springsteen's stories were becoming
 less heroic, but his musical style remained grand. Yet the sound, and 
the conviction in his singing, added weight to songs like "Racing in the
 Street" and the title track, transforming the pathetic into the tragic.
 But despite the rock &amp; roll fervor, Darkness was no easy listen, 
and it served notice that Springsteen was already willing to risk his 
popularity for his principles. Indeed, Darkness was not as big a seller 
as Born to Run. And it presaged even starker efforts, such as Nebraska 
and The Ghost of Tom Joad.<br>
<br>
- William Ruhlmann, The All-Music Guide to Rock, 1995.<br>
<br>
On this, the flip side of Born to Run, the idealism of those characters 
turns into stark terror once they hit adulthood. This is where 
Springsteen's reputation as a working-class mouthpiece is based, but 
there's much more here than that. * * * *<br>
<br>
- John Floyd, The All-Music Guide to Rock, 1995.<br>
<br>
Coming after a long legal battle to extricate himself from a management 
deal, Darkness on the Edge of Town is indeed darker than Born to Run but
 not without redemptive hope in songs such as "Badlands" and "The 
Promised Land." This may well be Springsteen's best batch of songs, 
though the production is criminally flat. * * * * 1/2<br>
<br>
- Gary Graff, Musichound Rock: The Essential Album Guide, 1996.<br>
<br>
After a three-year absence imposed by legal battles with his former 
manager, Bruce returned with a blistering tour de force that really 
showed off his band. Though the production is a little rough, this 
cathartic record is tight and direct with some of his most resonant 
songs. Turning to the troubles of adulthood, it offered a brooding, 
stark version of life for his characters and yet hope shines through -- 
"I believe in the promised land," indeed. * * * * *<br>
<br>
- Zagat Survey Music Guide - 1,000 Top Albums of All Time, 2003.<br>
<br>
For anyone who might have thought Bruce Springsteen couldn't sustain the
 creative arc and evolutionary path attained on his breakthrough album, 
Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town proved them soundly wrong. 
With this astounding album, the New Jersey native took his bar-band 
boogie from the boardwalk to sold-out shows across the States and let 
everyone know that he would forever be "The Boss."<br>
<br>
With a title that hints at the invisible corners in life that some can't
 see into and others choose not to see at all, Darkness's lyrics 
represent a streetwise poeticism that is lofty without being highbrow 
and straightforward without being simplistic. From the badlands to the 
Promised Land with the wastelands and the heartland in between, 
Springsteen travels across the American dream as his cast of outsiders, 
dreamers, and quiet failures yearn for redemption, wisdom, and escape. 
On "Prove It All Night" he sings "Everybody's got a hunger, a hunger 
they can't resist / There's so much that you want, you deserve much more
 than this," epitomizing that basic sense of hope that his songwriting 
of this period captured so eloquently. You got the sense when you 
listened to Springsteen that he wanted the same things as his tortured 
characteres. So, when he sang "For all the shut down strangers and hot 
rod angels rumbling through this promised land / Tonight my baby and me,
 we're gonna ride to the sea" in "Racing in the Street," you knew that 
he too was gonna drive to the sea if it was the last thing he did. And 
you loved him for it.<br>
<br>
Kicking up a notch the wall-of-sound aesthetic he had so successfully 
employed on his previous LP, Darkness on the Edge of Town takes out all 
the exuberance and joy from the mix and leaves the listener to 
contemplate the music's somber underbelly. This set of material ranks as
 one of the great examples American songwriting and helped place Bruce 
Springsteen in the pantheon alongside the likes of Bob Dylan and Johnny 
Cash. And that is where he remains decades later, still standing as one 
of the most vital and influential rock 'n' roll artists of all time.<br>
<br>
Darkness on the Edge of Town was voted the 68th greatest album of all 
time in a VH1 poll of over 700 musicians, songwriters, disc jockeys, 
radio programmers, and critics in 2003.<br>
<br>
- Nevin Martell, VH1's 100 Greatest Albums, 2003.<br>
<br>
"When I was making this particular album, I just had a specific thing in
 mind," Springsteen told Rolling Stone. "It had to be just a 
relentless...just a barrage of that particular thing." That obsession 
was the aftermath of the epic romanticism of his first three records: 
songs about people struggling with collapsed dreams. This was tough 
music, inspired by tough movies by Sergio Leone and John Ford. Recorded 
after a long absence from the studio (due to a lawsuit against his 
former manager), Springsteen and the E Street Band played rockers such 
as "Badlands" and "Promised Land" with barely contained passion.<br>
<br>
Darkness on the Edge of Town was chosen as the 151st greatest album of 
all time by the editors of Rolling Stone magazine in Dec. 2003.<br>
<br>
- Rolling Stone, 12/11/03.<br>
<br>
A near three-year gap separates Darkness On The Edge Of Town and its 
predecessor, the star-confirming Born To Run, a delay caused by 
Springsteen's acrimonious lawsuit against his former manager, but in 
that time he had clearly lost none of his energy and ability to 
encapsulate the American blue-collar experience. Eleven months in the 
making, sales for the album did not match its predecessor's sales of six
 million; however, it managed Number Five on the Hot 100 chart in the 
US, while actually bettering Born To Run's showing in the UK, peaking at
 Number 16.<br>
<br>
Darkness On The Edge Of Town was intended by Springsteen to be a more 
sparse record than his previous album, but it sounds just as powerful. 
"I just had a specific thing in mind," Springsteen explained later, "It 
had to be relentless." A lot has been made of the creative influence 
wielded by producer -- and later to become Springsteen's manager -- Jon 
Landau, who is said to have guided the singer/songwriter back towards a 
more stripped-down sound, with songs averaging four minutes in length, 
and certainly the album's overall brevity is a new departure, albeit 
that "Racing In The Street" was a portent of things to follow on his 
follow-up, The River.<br>
<br>
As of 2004, Darkness On The Edge Of Town was the #67 best-selling album of the 70s.<br>
<br>
- Hamish Champ, The 100 Best-Selling Albums of the 70s, 2004.<br>
<br>
Thanks to a legal dispute with former manager Mike Appel, Springsteen 
had three years to bask in the stellar success of Born To Run, and to 
comtemplate its follow-up. The resulting album, Darkness On The Edge Of 
Town, is a very different beast from its predecessor.<br>
<br>
Like Dylan before him, Springsteen withdrew from fame, moving to a farm 
in New Jersey so he could refocus on "life in the close confines of the 
small towns I grew up in." He wanted to "write about the stress and 
tension of my father's and mother's life that came with the difficulties
 of trying to make ends meet." (The album was originally to be called 
"American Madness," after a Frank Capra movie about the Depression.) 
Fatherhood is one of the album's themes ("Adam Raised A Cain"); struggle
 another ("Streets Of Fire," "Factory"). These are songs about 
small-town frustration, sometimes sexual ("Candy's Room"), sometimes 
social ("The Promised Land").<br>
<br>
Being Bruce, the angst is tempered with romance, particularly for the 
road -- many songs involve driving, either for escape, for thrills, or 
both -- but musically, this is a much more subdued affair than Born To 
Run. Clarence Clemons' sax is rarely heard. Instead, Springsteen's 
guitar and Roy Bittan's measured, melancholic piano set the tone.<br>
<br>
Uplifting, downbeat, bleak, and mad as hell, Darkness... is a 
spellbinding B-movie epic to follow the blockbuster of Born To Run.<br>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Columbia Radio Hour Interview </strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">November 1995</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
[Bruce Springsteen was interviewed by Bob Costas about "The Ghost of Tom
 Joad" and other subjects for the Columbia Radio Hour. The syndicated 
broadcast aired on various stations in late November of 1995. Most of 
the interview is transcribed here and on subsequent pages.<br>
Bruce: I'd made a record, or part of a record, last year, that I didn't 
finish, and I worked on it quite a bit and I listened to it ... maybe 
before last Christmas time or something and I said, "Gee, you know, it's
 not quite right." And I worked with the band on the "Greatest Hits" 
record. There's something about the band that always has sort of drawn 
me outside of myself to write more about the world outside, I suppose. I
 think I wrote "The Ghost of Tom Joad" originally as a rock song for the
 E Street Band, thinking I might use it as one of the extra songs on the
 "Greatest Hits" record. And for one reason or another that didn't 
happen, but it kind of set me in that direction a little bit. And I had 
this song "Straight Time," which is on this record. And I had that for 
about a year or so and I liked its basic feeling. And as I was working 
at that time -- you follow where your voice is, you don't particularly 
choose where your voice is at any given moment ... at this particular 
time in my work life ... it seemed like my voice is where this record 
ended up. It was more of a folk voice. That seemed to be something that 
was just saying, "Hey, work over here." I didn't sit down and plan to 
particularly make this type of record or not. Parts of it presented 
itself to me and then you sort of ... follow it along.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bob</strong>: Bruce, Tom Joad of course, 
from John Steinbeck's novel "The Grapes of Wrath," but it's clear that 
your inspiration for this comes more from the John Ford film, not just 
for this track, but the whole album has a cinematic feel. I know you're a
 fan of John Ford.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce</strong>: Yeah, that picture I guess I
 saw in the late '70s and it had a really deep effect on me. I think I'd
 read some John Steinbeck, probably earlier than that, in high school, 
and there was something about the film that sort of crystallized the 
story for me. And it always stayed with me after that ... there was 
something in that picture that always resonated throughout almost all of
 my other work. It was just an image that popped out as I was sitting 
around on the couch messing around with the guitar.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bob</strong>: Do you remember the first time that you watched Henry Fonda give that speech at the end?<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce:</strong> Oh yeah, I cried ... That 
was a very powerful speech for me. I think to some degree the things you
 write are a conversation with yourself ... I think that's probably what
 that song was to me, it was a conversation I was having with myself. 
Not about, "Oh, brother, where art thou?" or "Where is this in the world
 today?" It was just, "Where is it in me?" I think you gotta start with 
that question. If you can get people to ask that question, then the 
song's done its job.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bob:</strong> You've often come to the theme
 of a person in difficult circumstances trying to find some nobility, 
some dignity in those circumstances, maybe not in a dramatic way that 
everyone can see, but in some small way that would have a redemptive 
power for that person. And in these cuts, I find a little bit of that, 
but also a lot of resignation on the part of these characters that maybe
 they're just not even gonna find that little bit of dignity.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce</strong>: Well, I guess I sort of see 
there's a little bit of it out there. I don't really start from any 
political point of view -- no conscious one. I suppose everybody carries
 their politics innately and emotionally in their psychology in some 
fashion. But I think that's what's been happening. I think that the 
American idea of equal opportunity, obviously it hasn't been realized. 
And I think what's worse, every study that's come out about the division
 of wealth in society over the past 10 or 15 years has shown that the 
middle class has been getting smaller and people have been getting 
farther and farther apart. I think that while it's something that hasn't
 led to, say, riots, it leads to diminished hopes, diminished 
expectations, diminished possibilities. And so that feeling ... like I 
said I don't sit down and start from any particular conscious point of 
view, but I think that feeling of the way things feel to me right now, 
that colors the stories and the characters' lives on the record.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bob</strong>: Like we said earlier, "The 
Ghost of Tom Joad" is based much more on the movie, or draws its 
inspiration much more from the movie than from the book, and you think 
about the movie and this whole family making its way out west in this 
little rickety car, and nothing about their circumstances is nurturing, 
nothing should give them reason to be optimistic, and they're trying to 
forge some sense of community among themselves and find something that's
 real that can help them transcend these circumstances. And that theme 
shows up in a lot of your work through the years, doesn't it?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce</strong>: I guess, see my folks in 
1969, I was 19, my folks went west. They went to California to start a 
new life ... it was my mom, my dad and my little sister, I think they 
had saved $3000, and I remember I stayed in New Jersey because I'd 
gotten very involved with the band and I guess that'd become my family 
at that point in time, and it was also where I could make a living. I 
went out to California, I tried to make a living and I couldn't get a 
job. I couldn't get a job where somebody'd pay me to play. And back home
 I had two or three clubs where I could come up with a hundred, a 
hundred-twenty-five, or a hundred-fifty bucks a week, which was enough 
to survive on. I was sleeping with six other guys in an apartment and 
everybody's chipping in a few bucks for rent. But my folks went in '69, 
they had three grand, they slept two nights in the car and one night in a
 motel, and that was what they did. They drove into California, they 
didn't know anybody ... I had a girlfriend who was one of the first sort
 of hippies in the area, she was the only person anyone knew who'd ever 
been to San Francisco (laughs), and she sent 'em to Sausalito, (laughs) 
which was sort of, I guess, this sort of hipsters' enclave at the 
time...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bob:</strong> Was she sure to wear a pretty flower in her hair?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce:</strong> (laughs) So my folks pull 
straight from New Jersey into Sausalito, where of course, they realize 
very quickly that they don't belong there. And my mother claims they 
pulled into a gas station and asked the attendant, "Hey, where do people
 like us live?" (laughs) and somebody said, "Oh, you live on the 
peninsula." That's her story, so they started a whole new life out 
there, they did well, but they struggled pretty hard. I went out there 
-- there was a time when I'd never been on an airplane, till I made a 
record, nobody could afford an airplane ticket. To get to see them about
 once every year or so, me and a buddy of mine, we'd drive across the 
country, go three days straight, we'd save -- whatever, a hundred bucks 
... and drive straight through. I went to California ... I did some 
auditioning, but I realized really quickly that I wasn't gonna be able 
to live out there ... you know, there were just a lot of musicians, and 
while it was a much bigger music scene, I was a nobody, and I realized 
very quickly that while someone might let you play, they're not gonna 
pay you. So I stayed about two months and I realized I was gonna have to
 be living off my folks and I didn't want to do that, so I went back to 
New Jersey. And I don't know if that's had something to do with part of 
what I've written about. Maybe it's some of my own experience and some 
of just, that's the American story. The American story is transience and
 the idea of "over the rise," which is less now, I suppose, but I think 
it's some ingrained part of, not just the American spirit, but human 
spirit in general. My characters have always been on the move going 
someplace, searching for something -- whether it's a better life or 
running from something with the idea that somehow moving will make you 
better, it'll heal you inside.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bob:</strong> This may not be the exact 
quote, but you said something like this once: "I was 24 years old, I was
 sitting at home in New Jersey asking myself the question 'Is love 
real?' and if people have followed my characters through all the years, 
they can find a common thread with them and they see that 'Lucky Town' 
is where those characters wind up." That's what it was at the time you 
made that statement. Is "The Ghost of Tom Joad" where those characters 
wind up or where their thoughts wind up now, or is it more a nod of 
recognition at a path that all of us could conceivably take if we make 
the wrong choices or if our circumstances aren't so lucky?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce:</strong> I guess I don't like to use 
the idea of "wind up." I guess you don't "wind up" till it's over. 
(laughs ) There's a lot of different things, questions, I tried to work 
through in my work over the years. The idea of 'is love real,' yeah, I 
think it is, but it's hard to find. And it can be hard to find evidence 
of it. I'd written I think all of this record. And I was in my library 
one night and pulled a book out called "Journey to Nowhere," which was a
 book I'd bought years before and I hadn't read. The text is by a fellow
 named Dale Maharidge and there's some really great photos by a fellow 
named Michael Williamson, and basically what they did, they went out on 
the road and they road the trains from, I think, St. Louis to Oregon, 
and it documented a lot of what had been happening to a group of 
Americans in the latter half of the '80s -- the people that the 
trickle-down economy never trickled down to. It's a book that makes very
 real, puts real faces on what it's like if you slip through those 
cracks. I was very frightened, I remember I read it all in one night and
 I closed it -- my God, you never know what tomorrow brings. It strikes 
some sort of fear: what if you couldn't take care of your family, what 
if you had to leave them, what if you couldn't be home with your sons 
and your daughters, what if you couldn't pay for their health care, and 
couldn't provide them with the health care that they need? What if that 
was your kids? I know how deadly important my job is to me. What if I 
didn't have that job? Or what if I couldn't do that job after I did it 
for 20 years or 25 years?<br>
Bob: or what if the job you had...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce:</strong> ...disappeared.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bob:</strong> ...didn't have anything to do with anything that really meant something to you?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce:</strong> Right, so these are all 
questions that I don't know, I ask myself a lot I guess, and hey, I've 
had an enormous amount of luck and fortune and have worked hard, but 
that other thing, I don't know, it never feels that far away, and I 
think that it's as far away as the guy next to you. It's not that far.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bob</strong>: If you believe as you said 
once that people listen to your songs not to find out about you, but to 
find out about themselves. What do you think they'll come away from this
 record thinking or thinking about?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce:</strong> Basically, I think I tried 
to sit down and feel... I think your music always ends up being two 
things... one, it's probably a photograph of your own inner landscape, 
emotional landscape to some degree. And possibly your character in some 
fashion -- how you perceive your life, lives around you, the place you 
live. And then it's a picture ... I tried to reflect what the country 
feels like to me right now. The bottom line. That's the line that people
 will always judge ... America will always be judged against that, 
that's what the American idea was, some concept of shared burden. I 
guess what I was trying to do probably for myself was to put myself back
 in touch with those ideas, those values. I have children now. I'm a 
grown man. Now's not the time to think about what I want to be like, 
it's the time for me to be what I want to be like. So I think I was 
trying to really get myself back in touch ... with my family, my 
children, the man you want to be and what you want the place you live in
 to be like ,,. I sorta go for that first and I assume that if it's 
working for me, then it'll work for my audience or whoever listens to it
 ... I think that's probably where I'm coming from. <br>
 <br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bob:</strong> Wanna talk a little bit about the inspiration for Youngstown ?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce:</strong> That was a song that really 
-- I go back to this book called "Journey to Nowhere" -- I had written 
the whole record and then I read the book, and "Youngstown" and a song 
called "The New Timer" are really drawn from a lot of the information 
and the stories that were in this particular book. I guess that was 
something that probably out of all the things on the record maybe that 
connects the most directly to something if you were a fan of "The River"
 or just the story of post-industrial America, what happens when your 
job disappears. You were able to make a good living for 20 years and all
 of a sudden that's not there for you and maybe you can find a job that 
pays half as much or a quarter as much and you're 45 years old, you're 
50 years old. What happens when the craft you've learned, the skill 
you've learned ... I think, hey what if I couldn't... my music ability 
that's all that I have, I'm not a multitalented person, I have a talent 
in a specific area and I fumble around every place else. So I wanted to 
re-engage some of those ideas and some of those issues and that's really
 where that song came out of.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bob:</strong> How much of your present 
approach on this album is attributable -- even if it's a small amount --
 to some self-doubt about whether you'd become, for whatever reasons, 
too mainstream -- the whole idea that celebrity is the natural enemy of 
integrity, so you'd better deliver a counter-punch.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce</strong>: Oh, I don't know. I'm not 
sure I really ... I don't sort of steer myself by those particular 
lights. And I have a variety of different feelings about it. A lot of 
the things I really liked were things that were very mainstream. The 
stuff that moved me and changed my life were mainstream records. They 
were from people who came from outside of the mainstream but changed the
 mainstream to accommodate who they were by the force of their abilities
 and their talent and their ideas and their presence. Those are the 
artists that I admired a lot, whether it was Dylan ... hey, before "Like
 a Rolling Stone" you couldn't sing like that and get on the radio. They
 couldn't get on the radio like that. I've also said the same thing 
before Nirvana came out with "Smells Like Teen Spirit." You couldn't 
sound like that and get on top 40 radio. And I always believed that it 
was a valuable risk to take. It was a funny situation in that I think 
that I was essentially probably a child of Elvis Presley initially, but I
 grew up in the '60s and Dylan's work and later Woody Guthrie's also 
meant an enormous amount to me so I sorta got caught in between ... 
those are some different roots in certain ways. The things that meant a 
lot to me when I was young were the things that came across the AM 
radio. I didn't live in an environment where there was a lot of cultural
 education, we weren't exposed to things that were outside of the 
mainstream for the most part. The mainstream was what you had and in 
your small town what came across the radio was ... I found it very 
liberating and I found it very meaningful. I think I incorporated that 
... I had my choices. Way back, way way back in 1975. I could have not 
have done those interviews and probably not have been on the cover of 
both Time and Newsweek, and I could have possibly made some different 
choices in '85, but I was very interested in where that road lead and in
 finding out about who I was and what I could do or would do under those
 circumstances. 'Cause I thought I'd do something different, and in some
 ways I did and in some ways I didn't. And those are the things that 
interested me. I think that at this point if I had anything to say about
 the particular level of celebrity, which I don't have now, ten years 
ago it was different, was that at some point it felt pretty 
overwhelming, and I think at some point it overwhelms the story you're 
telling and trying to tell.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bob:</strong> This much is also undeniable. 
Without everything that went before the audience would be smaller for 
what you're trying to say here. There's no fighting that.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce</strong>: Right now, there'd be almost no audience. (laughs)<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bob:</strong> On it's own merits, no matter how high those merits are, absent what went before, this is a record that only a few people hear.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce:</strong> You are absolutely right. 
And that's the facts. And that's something that I've been conscious of 
that sort of throughout my career, I've kind of made one sort of record 
and I'll go off an make another one. And that balance has always felt 
right to me. I know that an audience is hard to find. And it's easy if 
you've had one for a long time, it's easy to take that audience for 
granted and think oh, hey, people just come when I play, they just buy 
my records when they come out. But the truth is that that audience -- I 
was years on the circuit, years on the circuit I studied my craft in 
bars since I was 14 years old, that's 32 years ago, and it happened over
 a long period of time. And it is something of tremendous value. At the 
same time, not just necessarily any audience is of tremendous value. I 
think that if you subvert what you're saying, what you're doing, what 
you want your work or your life to be about, then you've lost yourself 
and the essence of what you do.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bob</strong>: Do you feel like you ever did that?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce:</strong> I don't think so. I think 
basically, I've made the records that I've wanted to make. I think that 
in the course of probably the "Born in the USA" record, the story I was 
living overshadowed the story I was telling, and that is the consequence
 of a certain amount of maybe success and fame, and that's just 
something you learn. Not with everybody, not with my core audience, and I
 think that there's a few things on that record that are probably... 
certainly the title song, which I knew that when I wrote it that it was 
gonna have impact. But "My Hometown," I didn't know people were gonna 
respond like they did one way or the other. But I think that it's 
something that I'm very, very cautious of right now, and I'm really, I 
feel like I'm just out there checking it out. I'm trying to find ... I 
want this record to be heard, at the same time, I want it to be 
understood.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bob:</strong> Seems to me like "The Ghost of
 Tom Joad" is a record that people will have to listen to a half dozen 
times before they begin to form their feelings about it.<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce</strong>: I don't know...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bob:</strong> The first couple times through, I'm not so sure you're going to get it all.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce:</strong> I don't know. That's for the
 listener. I've heard it a lot of times. I haven't heard it ... since we
 finished it off. I think I can have the experience of the record, I 
can't quite have that initial listening experience that you're talking 
about. That's something I have as each song goes down, and that's 
slightly different because if I don't think I'm getting it, I move on to
 something else. Sometimes I'll go back, like "Straight Time." I played 
it once, I put it away and basically, I threw it away. And Jon [Landau] 
came out and he has a tendency ... he always asks my engineer, "What's 
laying around that hasn't been played or I haven't heard?" I think my 
engineer pulled that one out and he came back and said, "Hey, wait a 
minute." So sometimes you don't know; sometimes you do something that 
was better than you thought it was.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bob</strong>: When people come to see you on
 this tour, obviously they're going to see an acoustic show, not an 
acoustic version of songs previously recorded...<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce</strong>: It's not "Unplugged," it's not "Unplugged"...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bob:</strong> Right. So they're gonna see an acoustic show. There's an interesting contrast in that...<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce</strong>: What the show is, it's a 
folk show, to put it in sort of in the sense that I'm not sorta doing my
 favorites or their favorites, or the hits or whatever you call it. I'm 
concentrating very specifically on this particular record and material 
that feels like it complements it. It's a show that ... it's a quiet 
show. There's a lot of focus in it. So it's pretty different.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bob:</strong> I guess there is some feeling 
on the part of fans of an individual or a group, that when they go to 
see a concert, that concert should be an updated version of the catalog.
 We're gonna get all the classics, plus we're gonna get the handful from
 the new release that will join that group of classics, and that's not 
what's going to happen here.<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce:</strong> I think there's a time to do
 that. We'd played a couple nights with the E Street Band and we played a
 bunch of the old songs, and it was fun to do I enjoyed it and it's 
something where it's a departure. I really haven't done this before. 
I've played a few isolated shows. I've played Neil Young's Bridge 
Benefit a few times acoustically, and I've played a benefit for the 
Christic Institute acoustically with Jackson Browne. Then I started out 
on my own, when I got signed I was playing Max's Kansas City by myself 
with acoustic guitar, so in a funny way it's a throwback to what that 
was. But it's something I haven't really done before; it's something 
I've wanted to do for a long time. It really pares everything away and 
makes what you're about and what you're doing real clear, and that's 
what I'm interested in communicating right now. I'm real excited about 
it and I think the fans are going to enjoy it.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bob:</strong> Everyone wonders, no matter 
how much they enjoy this record, no matter how much they enjoy this 
tour, when will Bruce be back with the E Street Band? So now I've asked 
the question. I've discharged my obligation, now you discharge yours.<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce:</strong> (laughs) Oh, we had a great 
time doing the "Greatest Hits," and what can I say, it's a special group
 of people and I'm sure at some point we'll be doing something. I hate 
to predict because I'm always wrong myself, and I follow, when I said 
you sort of follow your voice, and the voice of this particular record 
was something that felt like, yeah, was just something I heard in my 
head right now, whether you hear the world speaking to you or something 
inside you speaking to you that moves you in a particular direction, and
 that's really, that leads you hopefully to your most honest work, 
hopefully to your best work, hopefully to your honest job. But then also
 if you make a quiet record you tend to want to make some noise maybe 
later or something. I'd want to be able to call on the guys, and if 
everybody felt like it and if I was gonna make a rock record right now 
that'd be the first thing that I'd do. Outside of my family, that's the 
most important relationship in my life, that and my relationship with my
 audience.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bob:</strong> Do you still stand by your 
statement that the two best days of your life were the day you picked up
 the guitar and the day you learned how to put it down?<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce:</strong> Oh, those days have been 
supplanted now. I guess the best days of my life were certainly the 
birth of my children. I think any parent always says that. And finding 
the thing that moves you ... something to do... finding something to do 
is really really important. I think maybe that that's why I'm attuned to
 that in others. Something that is so important to me, it was so 
important, and it's been so rewarding. That was the American idea was 
that everybody would have that opportunity, that chance. That's an idea 
worth fighting for.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bob:</strong> The easy, glib thing is when 
people say when someone gets successful and they have material wealth 
they get out of touch with the troubles of people on the margins. I 
think that's too easy, but if a person truly finds happiness -- and it 
seems like you're happier than you've ever been for a stretch of time 
now in your life -- if the person finds happiness, is there a danger 
that the artistic edge can be muted?<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bruce:</strong> No, no, because ... it 
depends, once again any of those things you can't generalize. Life's 
circumstances change people in a lot of different ways. I know you can 
make a lot of money and be isolated, but I knew some hard-core isolated 
people who had nothing and who cut themselves off. I've said in the 
past, you can isolate yourself with a six pack of beer. I don't buy 
those types of generalizations, I think it depends on the individual and
 the idea that happiness somehow mutes your work, I'm not so sure. It 
depends what drives you, it depends what you want and the things that 
you still ... I still search for the big part of the meaning of my life 
in my work ...<br>
Bruce: ... since you were born isn't something that disappears. I think 
anybody who was ever seriously kicked around never ever forgets. You 
know that stuff never leaves you, and I think if you're a person whose 
job is to mine your imagination, you keep every aspect of your life wide
 open. It's never a closed book. You never say, "Well, that was then." 
It's always now. It's all always now. And so you draw from that well as 
you can. </div>

“Bruce’s wild ride on the Express-way of Love”<br>
By Edna Gundersen<br>
<br>
Worcester, Mass. – Armed with a mixed bag of songs and moods, Bruce 
Springsteen finds the light in his Tunnel of Love Express Tour, launched
 Thursday at the Centrum, performed to a third sell-out Monday.<br>
If it’s a joy ride you’re after, he’s the one. Despite an absence of 
staples like Thunder Road and Badlands, 16,900 spectators were as 
bewitched as they were bewildered by Springsteen’s clear departure from 
pop demigod.<br>
The show opens on a light note. E Streeters emerge to buy a ride from a 
carnival barker behind a ticket booth. Springsteen arrives last, in 
silver-tipped boots, black jeans and a satin vest over a white dress 
shirt. He tosses a bouquet of roses to the crowd and yells, “Ready for a
 date?”<br>
And off to the circus he goes, breathing fire in one ring, clowning in 
the next and taking a few strolls on the high wire. The festive 
atmosphere belies a serious undertaking: to shed Born in the U.S.A’s 
shackles of sainthood and hit machinery. On this three-hour 
merry-go-round, Springsteen succeeds in reinforcing integrity without 
yielding momentum. <br>
He reaches deep into his catalog for rare B-sides like 1981’s charming 
Be True and Roulette’s thunderous nuclear protest, and plunges into 
Tunnel’s dark corners eight times.<br>
Humor and bone-rattling rock’n’roll take charge in the second set. 
Springsteen and Clarence Clemons reminisce about singlehood before 
storming into the rockabilly treat, You Can Look (But You Better Not 
Touch). The Boss mocks TV evangelism in a feverish sermon that precedes 
Coward.<br>
He premieres a waggish Part Man, Part Monkey, does Elvis proud in Can’t 
Help Falling in Love and crushes Joan Jett’s rendition of his Light of 
Day. The concert closes with a fusillade of Rosalita and the Detroit 
Wheels medley.<br>
The night fireworks are staggering, but it is a calculated lull that 
stole the show: a stirring, acoustic re-invention of Born to Run, the 
blistering anthem that once roared independence. Now it seethes a more 
contemplative urgency.<br>
The band is typically unfaltering with a five-piece horn section pumping
 new life into classics. Patty Scialfa’s higher profile and shimmering 
vocals give Tunnel’s tales a luscious feminine charge.<br>
Plainly delighted to be back on stage, Springsteen’s euphoria matches 
the crowd’s. “It’s good to see you again!” he tells the glory-dazed. 
“Missed you!”<br>
Likewise.</div>

Springsteen speaks: 'The goal is very clear'<br>
<br>
By JAY LUSTIG<br>
STAR-LEDGER STAFF<br>
<br>
A ROCK 'N' ROLL dream team including Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam, 
R.E.M. and the Dave Matthews Band will launch its own political campaign
 over eight days in October. These artists will attempt to boost John 
Kerry's run for the presidency by raising money and rallying voters with
 34 shows in nine swing states.<br>
<br>
It's arguably the most ambitious attempt at political activism in rock history.<br>
<br>
"Our main goal is to change the direction the government's been going in
 for the last four years, and to change administrations," said 
Springsteen in a phone interview with The Star-Ledger yesterday.<br>
<br>
This is not a single tour, but six of them that will often come to 
different cities in the same state, on the same day. Springsteen and his
 E Street Band will headline an arena tour that also will feature 
R.E.M., John Fogerty and Bright Eyes. Other touring teams include the 
Dixie Chicks and James Taylor; and John Mellencamp and Babyface. Tickets
 for all shows will go on sale Aug. 21.<br>
<br>
Here's what Springsteen had to say about the tour, and a few other subjects:<br>
<br>
Q. Were you involved in the initial talks to get this tour up and running, or did you sign on later?<br>
<br>
A. It started, I think, in some discussions that (manager) Jon (Landau) 
and I had about wanting to do something this election season. I 
initially thought I was going to go out with my acoustic guitar, and 
play in some theaters in the battleground states. Just play my music and
 make some of my ideas known, and get the audience to think on it 
together, and try to mobilize the progressive voters. (Landau) had been 
speaking to some of the other managers of groups that were also 
interested in doing something, and I know he got together with Pearl 
Jam's manager, and R.E.M.'s manager, and the Dixie Chicks' manager, and 
slowly, this thing came into focus. They looked around for the 
organizations we wanted to work with and they put it together.<br>
<br>
Q. So, to ask a basic question, what are you trying to accomplish with the tour?<br>
<br>
A. The goal is very clear. We want to change administrations in 
November. Outside of that, we're looking to mobilize progressive voters.
 ACT (America Coming Together, an organization that will benefit from 
the tour) has got foot soldiers out there that are going to be going 
door to door and making sure people get to the polls. So it's a 
combination of voter mobilization and some education. It's going to be a
 lot of fun, and entertaining for people - and inspirational, hopefully.
 But our main goal is to change the direction the government's been 
going in for the last four years, and to change administrations.<br>
<br>
Q. What would you say to, let's say, a conservative fan of yours, who 
might argue that musicians shouldn't be out there making political 
statements?<br>
<br>
A. This is one of my favorite questions ( laughs ). First of all, I can 
understand that there is an artist- audience bond, and part of the bond 
is, you look into the audience, and you see yourself, as I always do. 
And they look on-stage and they see themselves - hopefully, that's what 
we always hope for. Differences in opinions and beliefs, for some 
people, can sever some of those bonds. At the same time, the 
artist-audience relationship is more complicated than that. I always 
give the example of, I've gotten more inspiration and soul from, say, 
the movies of John Wayne, throughout my life . . . I found them 
consistently inspirational. But I was never a fan of John Wayne's 
politics, you know?<br>
<br>
Then the other answer, sort of, is, you have lobbyists in Washington, 
and they wheel and deal, and that's how they influence the government. 
"They're just businessmen. Why shouldn't they just shut up and do 
business, instead of getting involved in public policy?" ( laughs ). Big
 corporations influence the government in their fashion. You have labor 
unions who influence the government in their fashion. You have farmers, 
they influence the government in their fashion.<br>
<br>
Well, artists write and sing and think. This is the way that we do it.<br>
<br>
You can't tell anybody what to think. And I don't believe that people 
fundamentally even go to musicians for their political opinions. But I 
grew up in a generation where artists were always an alternate source of
 information. And the means of communication are relatively locked down.
 On cable news, you pretty much have the same guys interviewing the same
 guys, who then turn around and interview those guys on their show 
(laughs) . We're another voice out there with a particular point of 
view, and hopefully it enriches my relationship with all my fans.<br>
<br>
I always say, at our shows we've got Democrats, we've got Republicans, 
and people come and they take what they need from the music. But this 
was a particular election that I thought was probably the most critical 
election of my lifetime. I've been singing about the ideas of American 
identity and American ideals for 25 years. My point of view has been 
pretty clear. If you've been involved in my work, even a bit - unless 
you've done selective listening, which people do do with pop music ( 
laughs ) - it's not a secret where I've stood on most of the issues over
 the years. So, that's how it lays. The artist-audience relationship is 
multifaceted and more complicated than "I've got to agree with 
everything they think," or "They have to agree with everything I think."<br>
<br>
Q. So, obviously you're anti-Bush. Is it safe to assume you're pro-Kerry?<br>
<br>
A. Yes, I am.<br>
<br>
Q. At Shea Stadium last October, you upped the political content of your
 show significantly, playing a tape of President Bush (talking about 
weapons of mass destruction) before "Souls of the Departed." Was there 
anything specific that prompted that?<br>
<br>
A. The issues of how we got into Iraq were quiet for a long time. I was 
sitting back watching that happen, and I had great reservations and 
fears about entering into that war . . . I don't believe it was a 
Democratic or a Republican issue. I believe that any time we are going 
to risk the lives of our bravest young men and women, we honor those 
lives by doing it only under the most dire circumstances.<br>
<br>
Q. On a lighter subject, any ideas what songs you're going to do on this tour?<br>
<br>
A. I don't know. The set will probably be shaped by the event. It is a 
rally. But I think the show's going to be, hopefully, as it's always 
been, fun and inspirational, and joyous and serious. I'm not quite sure 
how it's going to shape itself. But we have an interesting bill, with 
R.E.M., and John Fogerty, who's going to sit in with the E Street Band. 
That's going to be a big thrill. Bright Eyes - a great singer-songwriter
 (Conor Oberst). So I think it's going to be different and exciting, and
 a lot of fun for the folks to attend.<br>
<br>
Q. When you say Fogerty will sit in, do you mean the band will back him in his set?<br>
<br>
A. We're gonna back John, yeah. John's coming, he doesn't have a band right now, so we're gonna do our best for him (laughs ).<br>
<br>
Q. Will you be part of that, or will it just be the band?<br>
<br>
A. Are you kidding me? (laughs) I'm going to be playing those John Fogerty songs. You better believe it.<br>
<br>
Q. Will there be some sort of grand finale or something?<br>
<br>
A. I don't know. The artists have just started to communicate a little 
bit. I hope we'll all get a chance to play a little bit on each other's 
music. That's part of the fun of the evening.<br>
<br>
Q. I know Steven Van Zandt is very liberal, politically, but do the other members of the E Street Band share your convictions?<br>
<br>
A. Well, they're all coming ( laughs ). I didn't make anybody go. I know
 (drummer) Max (Weinberg) has done some work for John Kerry already. 
Steve has always been very politically involved. And the other fellows 
said they were coming along. And my wife (E Street vocalist-guitarist 
Patti Scialfa) is comin', too.<br>
<br>
Q. Is it disappointing that there isn't more hip-hop, or Latin, or 
country music on this tour? That a broader range of music isn't 
represented?<br>
<br>
A. Yeah, that's always . . . I know Jurassic 5 is coming, and some other
 folks. Given the time frame they had . . . and I don't know how exactly
 all the acts were gotten together, but I guess they did the best they 
could.<br>
<br>
Q. Is there any possibility that you could put out an album this year, 
or will that have to wait? Will this tour impact when you'll be able to 
put out another album?<br>
<br>
A. Not really. I don't have anything immediately in the works. I'm just 
doing some writing. Really, I took most of the year off. Patti was 
working, she got her record ("23rd Street Lullaby") going, so she needed
 some time to do her thing. She made a great record, and she's in the 
process of trying to get that out to people. I'm enjoying being home 
with the kids. If it wasn't for this, that's where I'd have been (in 
October).<br>
<br>
In (the last) 25, 30 years, I haven't taken part in partisan politics. 
I've always believed it was best to keep an independent voice. But this 
was the rule-breaker. This is where I believe there are very basic 
questions of American identity and American values on the line, and it's
 stuff I've been singing about for 25 years, and so I've got to be 
there.<br>
<br>
Q. Are the new songs you're writing politically oriented, and might you be doing them on the tour?<br>
<br>
A. I can't tell 'til I have one, you know. I have good ideas, but that 
happens all the time. I wish I was somebody who could work from the 
outside in, and pick a subject, and just go home and write a song about 
it. But that's generally not the way I've worked. I've got to sort it 
out from the inside out. I would love to have written a good song about 
this particular moment. I'm sure there's a thousand songs there. If I 
can find the one I'm gonna sing, I'll sing it. But I never know until 
it's there.<br>
<br>
Q. The last time you did something like this was the Amnesty 
International Tour, in 1988. Do you have good memories of that tour, and
 do you think it accomplished what you and the other musicians wanted it
 to accomplish?<br>
<br>
A. It was an incredible experience. I mean, I played in front of 
audiences we had never played to previously. India, Africa. And we were 
trying to raise the awareness of amnesty and human rights issues in the 
countries we visited. It was a pretty satisfying experience. I guess 
this is somewhat like a stateside version of it, in that we spent six 
weeks together, I think, the last time, and we did 16 shows.<br>
<br>
This is a little bit different, though. I don't know of a situation where anything like this has quite happened before.<br>
<br>
Q. Did you select R.E.M., Fogerty and Bright Eyes personally?<br>
<br>
A. Initially, when all the acts' managers started talking, we were just 
sorting out what we were going to do. I was originally going to play in 
theaters, and R.E.M. was going to play in some clubs, with Bright Eyes 
opening. So then we said, "Maybe I'll take the (E Street) band, and 
we'll play in some bigger halls." I had met R.E.M. on our past few 
tours, and was a big fan pretty much from the beginning. So I said, 
"Maybe they'll want to come out with us." So we asked and they said, 
"Yeah, that would be great," and they brought Bright Eyes along, who I 
was a big fan of, from the first record. And John (Fogerty) was 
interested in being involved. When I lived in California, we lived 
pretty close to one another for a while, so we knew each other pretty 
well.<br>
<br>
Q. I just have one more question. Couldn't you persuade everyone to do at least one show in New Jersey?<br>
<br>
A. ( Laughs ) Well, hopefully New Jersey is pretty (solid) for Kerry. 
But we're going to be in Philly. There was a short period of time when 
all the acts were available, so we tried to go into the crucial places, 
where we might have the biggest effect. <br>

"Bruce Springsteen explores a time of 'Darkness'"<br>
By Elysa Gardner</strong><br>
<br>
NEW YORK — Bruce Springsteen still writes songs the old-fashioned way. 
Which is to say The Boss keeps his initial creative process low-tech.<br>
<br>
"I've got this big fat notebook," he says, holding his hands out for 
emphasis and flashing a distinctly self-deprecating grin. "It's the same
 kind I've always used, with everything written in longhand."<br>
<br>
In the documentary The Promise: The Making of Darkness on the Edge of 
Town, which makes its debut Thursday on HBO (9 p.m. ET/PT), 
black-and-white footage shows a 27-year-old Springsteen leafing through 
such a notebook while working on Darkness on the Edge of Town, the 1978 
album that cemented his reputation as a great American troubadour. A 
three-CD, three-DVD box set including the film, due Nov. 16, features an
 80-page simulation, complete with facsimiles of his scribbled lyrics, 
song ideas and recording and personal notes from that era.<br>
<br>
Its blue cover suggests an item favored by schoolchildren since long 
before the Information Age. "My new notebook looks just like that," he 
confirms. "Maybe the color's different, but that's all."<br>
<br>
Perhaps that's fitting, given the 61-year-old rock icon's response to 
watching himself and his longtime collaborators in the E Street Band as 
young men in director Thom Zimny's film. It premiered to wide acclaim in
 September at the Toronto Film Festival.<br>
<br>
"A lot has changed, and yet not very much has," Springsteen says, 
looking fit and relaxed in a plaid shirt and jeans as he chats in a 
Midtown hotel room. "We all know a lot more about what we're doing now, 
which is good, because we were truly amateurs at the time. But the same 
intensity remains about making music — the idea that it should matter, 
that it should be worth thinking hard about."<br>
<br>
A turning point<br>
<br>
Indeed, The Promise— which juggles footage of rehearsals, studio 
sessions and performances from 1976 to 1978 with new interviews with 
Springsteen, E Streeters and other colleagues — traces the recording of 
Darkness and the hard-won personal and artistic growth marked by the 
album, Springsteen's fourth.<br>
<br>
Darkness was delayed by a lawsuit pitting Springsteen against 
then-manager Mike Appel, who had co-produced previous albums, including 
Born to Run, the 1975 epic that made the singer/songwriter a superstar. 
Appel appears in the documentary, in which he and Springsteen speak 
about each other without acrimony. Springsteen states that the suit was a
 bid not for money but for control of his career. (In 1977, freed from 
contracts with Appel, he hired current manager and Born to Run and 
Darkness co-producer Jon Landau, a major presence in the film.)<br>
<br>
Darkness also was haunted and enriched by Springsteen's struggle to come
 to terms with his success and with a growing sense of social awareness.
 He wrote most of the songs while living on a farm in Holmdel, N.J., not
 far from the working-class neighborhood where he was raised.<br>
<br>
"I became interested in the mystery of my family life, and in its larger
 social implications," he says. "Initially you're not very interested in
 your parents as people, but in my late 20s, I started to have enough 
distance to see their story, and I found it compelling and provocative."<br>
<br>
The plaintive song Factory, for instance, was inspired by Springsteen's 
father, who lost his hearing after working amid the noise in a plastics 
plant, as he recounts in the film. "I wanted to delve into the personal 
and try to connect it to the political, and to write about things that 
were permanent. Work, family, relationships — generation after 
generation, those things are the essence of our experience."<br>
<br>
The resulting songs are leaner and grittier than the majestic 
soundscapes of Born to Run. Though Darkness has sold 3 million copies to
 date, about half as many as the previous album and only a fraction of 
the 15 million sold by his 1984 smash, Born in the U.S.A., critics 
consider it a pivotal work.<br>
<br>
Reviewing the album in Rolling Stone, future Springsteen biographer Dave
 Marsh wrote: "Occasionally, a record appears that changes fundamentally
 the way we hear rock &amp; roll. ... I have no doubt that (Darkness) 
will someday fit as naturally within that list as the Rolling Stones' 
Satisfaction or Sly and the Family Stone's Dance to the Music."<br>
<br>
Time clearly hasn't diminished the pundits' enthusiasm. "It's the record
 where Bruce grew up," says Rolling Stone contributing editor Anthony 
DeCurtis. "Born to Run, tremendous as it was, was like a last wail of 
adolescence, of the romantic agony that you go through as a young 
person. On Darkness, he takes a hard look at what people's lives are 
really like, at who gets opportunities and who doesn't. There's no 
longer that sense that somehow rock 'n' roll is going to save 
everything."<br>
<br>
Springsteen, too, sees Darkness, with its vivid depiction of everyday 
lives, dreams and disenchantment in now-classic tunes such as Badlands 
and Racing in the Street, as a transition point. "Some of the big themes
 I started to write about here, you'll spot them intermittently on my 
first three records. But it was really on Darkness and then (1980's) The
 River and (1982's) Nebraska and Born in the U.S.A. that they came to 
the fore."<br>
<br>
The band wasn't just trying to make a record, he says, "we were trying 
to make an essential record. So that if you were interested in rock 
music, interested in what was at stake in the late '70s culturally, then
 you had to deal with this particular piece of music. That became a 
blueprint for the way we continued to work, and I think that 
thoughtfulness has resonated over the long haul. The songs are still a 
vessel for the topics I want to discuss."<br>
<br>
Since his youth, Springsteen has viewed popular music as a "natural 
freedom promoter. You listened to Elvis' records or Woody Guthrie's or 
Hank Williams' and suddenly you had more breathing room, more license to
 be who you wanted to be. I've always felt that there were enormous 
political implications to Elvis' career. As a very feminized man who 
crossed racial lines, he was a bit of a precursor to the sexual 
revolution and the civil rights era — without uttering a political or 
rhetorical word in any of his songs."<br>
<br>
For Springsteen, the more politically conscious songs on Darkness 
"haven't become dated" in the 32 years since its release. "If anything, 
they're more relevant right now." He notes that the album was crafted 
"during the Carter recession." The country's mood has darkened, he 
acknowledges, since the 2008 presidential campaign, when he supported 
Barack Obama.<br>
<br>
"It's tough, because when people are out of work, they're hurt and 
angry. But we've been living through economic troubles for years. One of
 the biggest issues right now is the disparity in wealth, and that's 
been growing through all the boom times. We've worked with a lot of food
 banks over the past 25 years. There are constantly people dropping out 
of the middle class."<br>
<br>
Still scribbling notes<br>
<br>
Of Obama's performance as president, Springsteen says: "I continue to 
have great faith in him. There's that quote that says you campaign in 
poetry and govern in prose — or you campaign as a visionary and govern 
as a legislator. Maybe that's something he suffers from, or something 
people are struggling with. But I think President Obama is very smart 
and very steady."<br>
<br>
With The Promise, Springsteen hopes to flesh out his own image, 
particularly for younger fans who had not seen or heard his work with 
the E Street Band before the late '80s. "After I got the band back 
together again in 1998 or 1999, we did a few tours and made some good 
records, and I realized that there were a lot of kids coming to the 
shows. I thought it would be nice to put together a record of what we 
did at that earlier time."<br>
<br>
For the old faithful, the coming box set The Promise: The Darkness on 
the Edge of Town Story will include 21 previously unreleased songs, also
 available on a two-CD set, The Promise. The tunes include Springsteen's
 recordings of Because the Nightand Fire, respectively hits for Patti 
Smith and the Pointer Sisters.<br>
<br>
"All the tracks except one were recorded 30 years ago," Springsteen 
says, but didn't make the final cut. "I just decided that I wanted to 
say something else at the time. I wanted to wait until I felt I could 
have an essential conversation with my audience."<br>
<br>
It hasn't yet been determined when that conversation will resume in the 
form of a new studio album. At the moment, Springsteen is focused on 
seeing his 16-year-old son, Sam — the youngest of his three children by 
wife and E Street member Patti Scialfa— through his junior year of high 
school. But he's still finding time to scribble in notebooks.<br>
<br>
"I want to write some more good songs, play some more good shows," 
Springsteen says. "I want to come back and look again into all those 
wonderful faces that I've been looking into for the past 35 years. I 
just do what I do, you know?"</div>

"Bruce SPringsteen: My deal with the Devil"<br>
By Leonardo Colombati<br>
<br>
He sold more than 160 million records. He won an Oscar, 2 Golden Globes,
 19 Grammy Awards. In the last 35 years he managed to sell 25 million 
tickets for his shows. If you check the list of the most powerful 
celebrities in the world recently published by “Forbes” his name is at 
number six: Bruce Springsteen.<br>
When I met him a couple of years ago on the backstage of the Köln Arena,
 we chatted a little bit about literature (and specifically about Philip
 Roth, “another New Jersey hero”) and then he confessed that rockin’ all
 over the world was still his priority: “I really love to rock the 
house! Look at tonight’s setlist. You see? We’ll play 26 songs and only 
two of them are slow”.<br>
In September Bruce will turn 60, but if you have seen him live recently 
you can confirm Albert Einstein’s smart intuition about relativity of 
time. Today the Boss is in Stockholm and we talk before the second of 
his three sold-out gigs in the old Olympic Stadium. My first question 
is:<br>
<br>
How do you do that?<br>
<br>
“How do I do what?”<br>
<br>
It’s practically ten years that you are on tour and in the last seven 
years you have made five studio albums. You were never so prolific as 
you are now, not even at the beginning of your career. It’s like the 
Stones in the Decca years…<br>
<br>
“Focusing is the secret”, he says. “You get a little older and you have a
 defined amount of time for doing your work and enjoying your friends . .
 . I also believe that I learnt how to do my job in a more efficient 
manner that allows me to get more, to put good music out to my audience.
 I think that when I was young I had a lot of insecurity, I would second
 guess everything and the creative intelligence that allows you to make 
good choices while you’re writing wasn’t as fully developed. I had a 
little bit of a shotgun approach, where I was writing a million things 
and then try to go back and choose what was right. Now I write very 
concisely, I have few outtakes from my albums, but with the songs I’ve 
written and demoed I know that I have something that’s gonna make a good
 record before I even step into the studio. That allows me to do few 
more records and to tour more constantly, which I love doing, and I have
 to thank my wife Patti who has taken a large share of the burden at 
home with the children, so that I can come over here and be able to tour
 for my fans.”<br>
<br>
Actually, Patti didn’t come for the European leg of the “Working on a 
Dream Tour” because she has to take care of Even (19), Jessica (18) and 
Sam (15). What is amazing is that few days ago, in Netherlands, half of 
the audience was the same age of Bruce’s three kids.<br>
<br>
“That’s true,” he reckons. “We have a new audience that comes each tour,
 we seem to gather new young faces. Most of those guys weren’t even born
 when I made Born in the U.S.A. That’s another reason why this has been a
 very prolific and active time for myself and the band.”<br>
<br>
Every time we talk about passing of time during our conversation, I 
notice that Bruce tends to be more serious and passionate. Although it’s
 clear that he made a deal with the Devil, he’s running into “those 
crisp fall days that come along in September”, as he said. I wonder if 
that’s the reason why he chose to make some pop songs for Working on a 
Dream.<br>
<br>
The sound of the great records made by the Beach boys, The Byrds and the
 Beatles is perfect for emphasizing the main themes of the album, which 
are Love and Time…<br>
<br>
“Yes, or to put it in other words, the transcendence of Time in Love”, 
he says. “It was a talent that I had in the early days of my career to 
build those kind of arrangements that I hadn’t use very much during the 
past 10 or 15 years, when I tended to strict the band down to a more 
rock sound, you know . . . Rock ‘n’ roll, folk-rock, roots . . . And I 
kind of tilted away from those very rich pop arrangements until we got a
 little bit of it on Magic with ‘Girls in their Summer Clothes’ and 
‘Your Own Worst Enemy.’ I really enjoyed to make them because I love 
those big sweeping pop records. And now I had my little opera with 
‘Outlaw Pete,’ and then ‘Queen of the Supermarket,’ ‘Kingdom of Days’ 
and ‘This Life’—all little symphonies that sort of tackled different 
adult issues. It was very enjoyable.”<br>
<br>
Working on a Dream is an album full of happiness and melancholy. People,
 in America and in Europe, are living times of fear and anguish. Is that
 the reason why you play only few songs of the new album and you pick up
 some of the most political songs in your catalogue, like “Seeds,” 
“Johnny 99” and “The ghost of Tom Joad”? Your fans call them the 
“Recession Suite.”<br>
<br>
“We do try to do a variety of things. We want to entertain and we want 
to bring joy and smile to our audience’s faces. We also want to inform 
and reflect times we are living through. When I put a set together for a
 tour those are the requirements that I have before I feel that I’ve 
created something that is in the tradition of what we’ve pursued in our 
work life. You know, after 9/11, in 2002 we had The Rising, than we had 
Magic a couple of years ago that address a lot of the issues of the Bush
 administration, the Iraq war… And so, this record came right between 
those things and the Obama campaign.”<br>
<br>
A campaign that Bruce endorsed by playing in various rallies before the 
Inauguration Ceremony held in Washington last January, an unforgettable 
afternoon opened by Bruce who played “The Rising” in front of 500,000 
Americans gathered at the Lincoln Memorial. Few days before, Obama said,
 “I decided to run for Presidency because I can’t be Bruce Springsteen .
 . .”<br>
<br>
“There was a lot of hope out there,” Bruce says, “and remains a lot of 
hope out there, but the times also became hard, the Country was near 
down off the cliff by of the last administration.”<br>
<br>
It was the end of a nightmare . . .<br>
<br>
“Yeah, and so I needed some music on this tour that’s gonna reflect the 
consequences of the choices that we made. So I went back to ‘Seeds’, 
‘Johnny 99’, ‘The Ghost of Tom Joad’, Steven Foster’s song ‘Hard Times’…
 You know, my favourite promise is to tell the bad news and the good 
news.”<br>
<br>
The good news for his fans are that Bruce is still the best live 
performer in town. Someone said that the world is split in two: whose 
who adore Bruce Springsteen and whose who have never seen him in 
concert. People that attended his last shows can easily confirm that. 
The E Street Band is having a lot of fun.<br>
<br>
Now you started to play a game called “stump the band.”<br>
<br>
“That’s something that happened. I started to pick a sign or two out of 
the audience and more signs showed up, and then somewhere towards the 
end of the last tour it became a little bit of a thing that we did, and 
now I save a place at night, I leave three or four songs blank on our 
setilist and the band knows that I’m gonna run out there and grab a few 
signs and we’re gonna see what the audience want to hear right now. That
 allows the audience to get their hands on the show, it opens the show 
up and brings a lot of warmth, and it breaks that law between the 
audience and the performer down. You know, we don’t have a rigid setlist
 from town to town. We are here tonight responding to you and with your 
input we would give you a show that is uniquely yours and only get 
played in your town.”<br>
<br>
How is it working with Jay?<br>
<br>
“Jay is a phenomenon!”, he says. “A 18 years old drummer is not supposed
 to be able to sit in that seat and perform the way he does. A 18 years 
old drummer he’s barely supposed to play in time! He’s a real phenomenon
 and he prepared very deeply with his dad. He takes a certain amount of 
Max’s style that is recognizable and he infused it with his own style. 
You know, he’s playing in punk-rock bands, very hard rock and heavy 
metal bands, and he brings some of that energy. He’s excited to play 
with the band and he’s a lovely lovely kid.”<br>
<br>
I believe that Jay is the proof that the E Street Band is not only a 
rock band but it works like a family… When you see the E Street Band 
live you can feel that sense of brotherhood, what Walt Whitman called 
the “dear love of comrades . . .”<br>
<br>
“To have the only other guy on that seat in 35 years be that guy’s son is a wonderful thing for the band”.<br>
<br>
Jay will give back that seat to his dad by the time the tour will hit 
Italy. There are three shows on schedule: Rome (07/19), Turin (07/21) 
and Udine (07/23). <br>
<br>
Don’t you know that with Working on a Dream you became the first foreign
 artist to reach ten times the #1 position in the Italian album chart?<br>
<br>
“Wow, that’s incredible!” he says. “Italian audience was always one of 
the most deepest and the most loyal and fanatic . . . It’s an endless 
pleasure to come back to Italy, it’s always magic. I always look forward
 to coming back.”<br>
<br>
It’s a love story started 24 years ago when you played at S. Siro Stadium in Milan for the first time.<br>
<br>
“I remember that show pretty well.”<br>
<br>
Last time that we met, we recalled your second concert at S. Siro, in 2003 . . .<br>
<br>
“Yeah. After a couple of songs it started to rain very heavily and we 
thought that we had to stop because of the lightning. But none of you 
60,000 crazy Italians moved, so we continued to play and the result was 
one of the five most amazing shows of my entire career.”<br>
<br>
Talking about Italy, Sergio Leone—a film director that exerted a big 
influence on your work—died exactly 20 years ago. The first track of 
Working on a Dream, “Outlaw Pete,” reminds me the atmosphere of the 
soundtrack of The Good, The Bad and the Ugly . . .<br>
<br>
“It was a little homage,” he laughs. “I had a cowboy song and I said I 
got to dress this up with a little bit of Ennio Morricone’s style. They 
were fabulous movies and of course Ennio is one of the greatest 
composers for film in the world. He made an incredible body of work. A 
lovely man, I had the honour of meeting him a couple of times.”<br>
<br>
Someone say that rock ‘n’ roll started to loose its power since iTunes 
put the idea of disc in a critical position. The album format – its 
length, its structure, the lyrics printed on the sleeve, reclaim a 
certain attention, it’s an experience similar to reading a book. The 
best artists of the Sixties, the Seventies, the Eighties, trusted in 
that kind of attention and that’s why they could use their expressive 
freedom at its maximum potential even if they were doing mainstream 
music. Take the Beatles, for instance: in 5 years, they moved from “Love
 me do” to “A day in the life,” and people were following them.<br>
<br>
Now it’s seems to me that the new ways of listening music don’t allow the same liberty. How do you deal with that?<br>
<br>
“My theory is that you have to go about your business the way you go 
about your business. In other words, the world of music—and the world 
period—change constantly. If you live to be my age you’ve seen great 
changes, you know? When I started recording there were only records, 
then I saw the cassette tapes, I saw cd’s . . . These things change on a
 10 ten year or 12 year cycles, and they will continue to change 
probably forever. What doesn’t change is the artist’s commitment to his 
audience, his commitment to be understood, his commitment to creating a 
body of work that hopefully will have meaning for the listeners, and 
then you have to trust that that work will be communicated to those 
listeners in some way. Maybe not the way you intended, but I think there
 are people out there who are always searching for a deeper experience. 
Rock ‘n’ roll has been like a secular religion in the second half of the
 20th Century: there were people who sought a context for the answers to
 the daily life and daily problems and to dance and to be exhilarated 
and helped through struggling times. My job is to provide content and 
music that would address those issues. That is the way that I serve my 
people and my audience. The only thing that I know to do is to continue 
to do that, and then I look to the vehicles that are available to me at 
any given time, whether it’s the internet or a cassette tape or digital 
press, whatever . . . So that’s the way that I approach this issue and I
 don’t have all the answers and everybody does it in a different way… 
You know, I used to love the big album covers, they were magic. Well, 
they’re gone now, something else is there. You are livin’ your times and
 I always thought that if Shakespeare was alive today he would be on the
 internet!”<br>
<br>
Talking about secular religion I always thought that Dylan and yourself 
were the authors of pop music’s New Testament, the first who talked 
about adult issues in rock ‘n’ roll. You wrote “Thunder Road” in your 
twenties, but there was already a line that says, “I’m ready to grow 
young again . . .” Your characters always live with the uncertainty, the
 contradictions and the compromises of the adult world, and that’s why 
maybe “Thunder Road” talked to me when I was 15 years old and continue 
to talk to me now . . .<br>
<br>
“That was a funny song,” Bruce recalls. “It was recognising the lost of 
innocence that was throughout post-Vietnam America. Why did I say that I
 wasn’t young anymore? Because nobody after Vietnam was truly young or 
innocent anymore. Somehow, we were all been felt responsible for the 
times we lived in, and even a 24 years old young man could feel young in
 the early Seventies after 50,000 dead. Those were extremely adult 
issues and if you were a teenager you had to face it because of the 
draft, you couldn’t ignore the course of history in those days. Everyone
 knew someone who died, everyone knew someone who didn’t come back from 
the war. I liked the romance of rock ‘n’ roll but I had also to face the
 sense of the real world. We were all a sort of romantic realists, you 
know . . . and still I am, I think . . .”<br>
<br>
Show time is near. But I want to know about Bruce’s future releases.<br>
<br>
In the last couple of year you wrote some solo stuff . . .<br>
“I’m always writing,” he laughs. “I write all the time.”<br>
<br>
It should be your next project?<br>
<br>
“I don’t know. I think that the E Street Band will probably take a rest 
for a little while. But it all will happen again. We’re lifers, we’re 
gonna go on forever.”<br>
<br>
What about the Darkness on the Edge of Town box-set?<br>
<br>
“Oh yeah, that’s something we’re working on. We take it slow and try to put something together that would be nice for fans.”<br>
<br>
Bruce, before we finish . . . We were talking about requests. Can I do mine?<br>
<br>
“Sure.”<br>
<br>
I would love to hear “Once upon a time in the West” while you are 
entering on stage in Rome, like you have done a couple of times in the 
past . . .<br>
<br>
“Okay, let me write it down and see what we can do! Take care my friend.”</div>

“Bruce Springsteen is not God and doesn’t want to be”<br>
By Robert Duncan<br>
<br>
Understand. New Jersey has no baseball or football teams and half of it 
stinks. It used to be that if you were from Jersey and you came over to 
New York— by that I mean Manhattan, naturally; Queens certainly doesn't 
count—you didn't admit you were from Jersey. No, if there was one thing 
we New Yorkers could get together on it was Jersey: not a one of us 
would've given a second thought to blowing the joint off the face of the
 universe like the infected pimple that it was...Was, I say. My God, how
 times change. I mean, I stopped going to the Academy of Music on 14th 
Street because the average patron there was a Jerseyite—you know, loud 
or nodded out or smelly or in any way obnoxious. But now, just like the 
guys down the hall from me who pretend that they're black and jive and 
shuffle about the building all day, I—a New York chauvinist if ever 
there was one—wonder why my mother wasn't considerate enough to have 
gone to Jersey to borne me. And when folks ask, these days, if I have 
any interest in impressing them, I say: "Me? Hey, I'm from Jersey, man!"
 Because—may Fiorello LaGuardia rest in peace—it's finally and 
unmistakably hip to be from the "armpit of the nation," that 
newly-venerable State of New Jersey...<br>
But, of course, I don't try to fool these guys, these authentic 
specimens, and besides, they probably have ways of checking . . .<br>
"I was born in Sheboygan," I tell Bruce Springsteen, Miami Steve Van 
Zandt and company, who unanimously fall over in their seats laughing, 
having just discussed the drag scene that had gone down in 
Wisconsin—they think it was "some place like Sheboygan probably." And 
they're still laughing while this chick journalist who is accompanying 
the band and who lives in England "but originally came from Jersey"—I 
bet, bitch!—asks me with a singular ridiculing distaste, "Exactly how do
 you spell that...She-boy-gan?"<br>
Well, all I know is God wasn't shittin'! The last shall be first, indeed! And I begin to counterattack.<br>
"Sure, I know," Springsteen readily admits. "When I was 18 and playing 
in this place in California in this bar band these people would come up 
to us and say, 'Hey, I really dig you guys! Where do ya come from?' And 
I'd say, 'New Jersey,' And they'd just go 'Yecch! Ecch!"' So he knows, 
huh. I suggest to Springsteen that he probably should get some sort of 
public service citation from the Governor (if this one's not in jail 
yet) for finally making Jersey—I chose my next word carefully so as not 
to flatter my uppity tormentors —"tolerable." But Bruce doesn't detect 
my thinly-veiled sarcasm, mulls the point over for a moment, stroking 
his grizzly chin, and says, "I ain't got nothin' from nobody in Jersey. I
 mean, when I'm home I walk up and down the boardwalk all day and not 
one person—well, sometimes one—stops and says, 'Hi!' or 'Hey, I know 
you!'" Then the lights go on behind this Jersey punk's eyes—which he 
averts from mine, shyly, because we've just recently met—and he tells me
 whimsically, but only half jokingly, "What I think I'm gonna do is get 
on all the clothes I'm wearing on the album, you know, and get it just 
right. And hold my guitar out here, this way, just so...And maybe I'll 
even get ol' Clarence and lean on him just so...Do the whole cover 
thing... Maybe then people'll notice." And for the first time since the 
show several hours earlier Springsteen laughs in his wheezing kind of 
chortle-through-the-nose way and looks directly at me. The ice is 
broken.<br>
As the waitress passes, my new buddy (Can a guy from New York really 
call a guy from Jersey his "buddy"? I am drunk.) and I decide that more 
beer is in order. While it's only Springsteen's second of the evening, 
the record company man asks protectively of his Next Big Thing, "You 
sure you should have another, Bruce?" In mortal fear that I may lose a 
drinking partner, I insist that Springsteen try the famous local brand. 
Over the protestations of the company man, Springsteen instructs the 
waitress "OK, yeah. Give me one of them." He points to my empty. "But I 
won't know<br>
the difference," he says to me. "I don't really drink beer." Doesn't 
drink beer? I remark to myself suspiciously. And when he confirms the 
stories that he doesn't take drugs either...well, frankly, it bothers 
me. Somehow, in terms of the tradition which he is carrying on, it makes
 Springsteen, the would-be new Rock 'n' Roll Rebel King, somewhat 
inauthentic.<br>
I must deal with this contradiction. Sitting across from him in this 
sleazy downtown Detroit jock bar, once owned by ex-football star turned 
TV personality Alex Karras, this place that is absolutely a drinker's 
hangout. I assess the Phenomenon's offstage persona, seeking the flaws. 
The clothing immediately stands out. In place of the studded black 
leather jacket, which Springsteen expropriated from James Dean for stage
 use, is a much more stylish, tapered sport coat of reddish leather. In 
place of the sneakers, which the record company has established as some 
sort of trademark, is a pair of brand new shiny high-heeled boots. Aha! 
This street kid stuff is just so much showmanship as I had suspected! 
Beside me, Miami Steve, who has a much more recognizably Jersey accent 
as well, looks more the part than Springsteen (or "Da Boss," as he calls
 him), having shed his onstage pimp costume to deck himself out entirely
 in black leather. Disillusionment is setting in. Then I listen to the 
conversation.<br>
Springsteen is speaking in what appears to be his natural voice, 
breathy, gritty with a black cadence. He and Miami are talking about 
their old buddies on E Street (Yes, there is such a place) and if those 
guys could see them now. As Bruce has been warming up with the beer 
which he so rarely indulges in, Steve has been warming up with these 
miniature bottles of rose. Now they're talking quite seriously about the
 boardwalk at Asbury Park and the pinball machines. Miami Steve has made
 the seemingly logical proposal to Bruce that if the pinball people can 
make an "Elton John-Pinball Wizard" table, why shouldn't there be a 
"Bruce Springsteen-Born To Run" table as well. Bruce explains to him 
with a similar forthrightness and logic, "Ya see, these guys wanna make 
bucks...You gotta be famous." (Little did the two kids quietly turning 
over their dream world, determining what is and what will be, realize 
that around the next corner lurked Time and Newsweek covers. Little did 
they dream of Springsteen's unprecedented ascension to nationwide fame.)
 Then they started to tease their record company guys, New York City 
rats both, about a recent trip to Asbury Park. Bruce mockingly relates 
the incident wherein one of the guys joined him<br>
on Asbury Park's infamous "Rock 'n' Roll Ride." "It goes around and 
round," he explains. "And up and down, in and out"—he accelerates with 
the ride—"and this and that way and-all-over-the-place! Wow!" he laughs.
 The company guy owns up, "Yeah, I was screwed up for two whole days 
afterwards." Tapered red leather sports coat? That's just the way they 
dress up in Jersey for a Saturday night. Listening to Springsteen, it 
becomes readily apparent that he's for real, that if he's no longer one 
of them, at least he's from them, those kids he writes about, and deeply
 rooted in the steamy, frenetic landscape of Asbury Park, New Jersey. 
And while the Next Big Punk/Street Poet/Rock 'n' Roller hype may have 
put his current album at the top of the charts, it certainly isn't 
disseminated by him and seems to have caused Springsteen enough pain 
with the pleasure.<br>
We're talking about the recording of Bom To Run. Abruptly Bruce shifts 
gears and stomps on the pedal. He leans across the table willfully to 
within inches of my face. Everyone else at the table is shut out. His 
eyes are ablaze. "That was the most horrible period of my life...the 
most horrible period of my life," he states, shaking his head slowly 
back and forth and sweeping his hand unequivocably across everything. 
And when I ask him why, he grabs the Columbia press packet from in front
 of his publicist and holds it up beside his face. Across the top is Jon
 Landau's famous quote, "I saw the rock 'n' roll future and its name is 
Springsteen." Bugging eyes rivet me. Then<br>
impulsively, frustratedly, Springsteen bites the packet and rips it with
 his teeth, finally tearing it in half with his hands and throwing it to
 the floor. "THAT!" he barks savagely in answer to my question.<br>
"Let me tell ya," he continues more quietly, but no less intensely. "I 
had this horrible pressure in the studio and for the whole last part of 
the record l was living in this certain Inn in New York over west. The 
place is, in fact, notorious and has been raided more than once for 
gambling and prostitution.] And the room there had this..." He sizes 
something up. "It had this crooked mirror. And everyday, before I'd go 
over to the studio I'd straighten out this crooked mirror...And everyday
 when I'd come home, that mirror was crooked again. Every time. That 
crooked mirror...it just couldn't stay straight...So I'm in there with 
this crooked mirror and after about a week the room<br>
started to look like Nagasaki anyway..." He pauses suspended in his 
gesture that indicates the room and then launches in again. "...junk all
 over the place. And then one day this chick I was with one night in 
Texas calls up and says she's in Jersey and she doesn't have any place 
to stay and she's freakin ' out! And so finalIy I say, 'OK. You can stay
 here.' So every day I'd go into the studio and there was that and then 
I'd come home and there'd be this crooked mirror and...this crazy chick,
 you see." And he has to laugh as each Chinese box of his story gives 
way to another absurd package.<br>
But as Springsteen goes on, elaborating on how every day of recording 
was supposed to be the last, brief sessions stretching on into weeks, 
and how everybody was "getting crazy," he gets serious again. "One 
night," he tells me, "towards the end of the record, I was sittin' there
 at the piano in the studio, tryin' to get down the last cut, 'She's the
 One,' and Landau's in the booth and we've been at it for hours and 
hours. I just lean my head down on the piano. It just won't come. And 
everybody's<br>
tryin' to tell me how to do it—they were all there to help me and they 
were really tryin'—and Landau's sayin' this and that and freakin' 
out...and then, all of a sudden, everyone looks around and Landau has 
just disappeared, just walked off into the night— night, it was like six
 a.m.—couldn't take it. He was smart to go home and get some sleep. The 
whole thing was like that. And when I got home around 10 in the morning 
to the room with the crooked mirror, this chick she says to me—she says 
it every night when I come home—"and Springsteen's voice softens, " 'Is 
it finished?' and I say, 'No.' And I could've cried...l almost cried..."
 Springsteen goes further away for a moment. "...Well, maybe I did cry a
 little..." And then snaps back. "...I almost cried."<br>
The "crazy chick" is now his nearlongtime girlfriend, Karen Darvin. And 
the record? "After it was finished? I hated it! I couldn't stand to 
listen to it. I thought it was the worst piece of garbage I'd ever 
heard. I told Columbia I wouldn't release it. I told 'em I'd just go 
down to the Bottom Line gig and do all the new songs and make it a live 
album." Of course, Columbia prevailed upon him to release the record, 
and while it did rise to the top of the charts and while Bruce can now 
laugh and say of the album these several months later, "I like it," he 
also assures firmly: "Never again!"<br>
But you mustn't believe him. First of all, he's from Jersey. Second: 
just listen to the care that went into Born To Run and you try and 
figure out how he can retreat from that. Third: he has this limitless 
energy and is driven by a sincere desire to give an audience everything 
that they could have hoped for in a performance because "You cannot take
 the audience lightly." Unless he gets thoroughly corrupted by corporate
 economic policy and/or his own publicity, this guy will never just put 
out "product"—live or in the studio—he's too honest.<br>
Miami Steve is making sure that the barmaid tells Alex Karras that 
"Miami says hello," as we're all swept out of the bar. One record 
company guy has gone ahead to get the car, and, as we emerge onto the 
street, he pulls up. Everybody is piling in when Springsteen announces, 
"Nahh, I don't want to drive. I'm gonna walk back." And he expands his 
chest to take in a lungful of the dubiously nutritional Detroit air. In 
drunken mimicry, I do the same...and damned if it don't feel good! I tap
 on my chest and shout to Springsteen, "H20! H20!" And he responds at 
first with a sheepish grin, unsure of my comic intentions, but a little 
drunk himself, echoes "Right! H20!" And despite the protests of the 
company chaperones, the Next Big Thing and I set off into the murky 
Motown night, oblivious to danger and also oblivious to the fact that 
I'm not at all sure of the direction of the hotel, though I'm a 
certifiably good guesser.<br>
Springsteen has his harp out and is stepping jauntily in time to his own
 unaccompanied version of "Not Fade Away," singing between his honks in a
 quiet sinuous wheeze. (If they ain't downed out, Jersey cats can get 
hopelessly corny.) A block into our perilous journey, Springsteen 
realizes that the company guys are following slowly behind us in the 
car. He motions them on. When they stay put, he steps up to the car and 
good-naturedly tells them to "Get outta here!" We walk on. Another 
block. The car remains on our trail. Suddenly, Springsteen pivots and 
races head-on at the slow-moving car, bounding solidly onto the hood in 
his high-heeled boots, and then stomping and skidding his way onto the 
roof where in mock-frenzy attack he jumps up and down repeatedly. "Hey! 
You're gonna wreck the goddamned rented car, Bruce!" some Nervous Nellie
 within shouts out. "Nahhh!" Springsteen countermands as he finishes his
 assault and leaps back to the pavement. The car scoots off.<br>
I laugh. It's the kind of wanton nonsense that I expect from Rock 'n' 
Roll Kings. He chortles in his nose and withdraws back into the harp and
 “Not Fade Away.” But fade away he does. Back at the hotel (amazingly 
enough) he makes a gracious, if perfunctory, gesture to invite us all 
in, but when we get off the elevator at the sixth floor it's clear that 
he's heading towards his room—swaying, actually—and sleep and that 
everyone else should go elsewhere. Aww! Those Jersey punks could never 
take it! I think as I careen off to whatever I can find. But in a more 
rational moment, I realize that mere mortals must sleep.</div>
