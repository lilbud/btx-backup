The 'Springsteen paradox' that explains why Trump won Michigan, By Michael Luongo:</strong><br>
<br>
My first clue that something was up was the Bernie Sanders rally I attended at the University of Michigan.<br>
Several thousand people (compared to the much smaller number who showed 
up for Hillary Clinton's rally in nearby Detroit around the same time) 
filled the Crisler Center. Not all of them were students; in fact, many 
of the students hadn't even been born in 1994 when NAFTA, one of 
Sanders' immediate targets for criticism, was passed. But many of the 
people I saw that day had driven hours from the conservative western 
side of the state to hear Sanders' populist message. They had lived with
 economic devastation (much of it caused by NAFTA and the Great 
Recession) and for many of them, the memory of the first pink-slip 
remains vivid. So it wasn't a surprise to me that Sanders won the 
Democratic primary and despite fivethirtyeight.com's predictions, I 
wasn't shocked that Donald Trump won Michigan.<br>
I could see it coming. I knew this would happen, because the Boss told me so.<br>
Call it the "Springsteen paradox": Coastal elites (and their Midwestern 
contemporaries) who might pay hundreds of dollars to see the famous 
singer perform his songs of working-class life have lost touch with the 
very people whose lives populate his ballads. In fact, the disconnect 
cuts both ways. Many of the very people Springsteen immortalized have 
now tuned out the Boss, who campaigned hard for Clinton, because of his 
politics. For decades, Springsteen has rallied for Democratic 
candidates, railing against Republicans, including Donald Trump, who 
insist on playing his songs at their events. Yet the men and women in 
Springsteen songs, decades after the "Born in the USA" album's debut 
during the Reagan Democrats era, continue to flip parties.<br>
I have a unique perspective on this paradox. The empty shell of a 
long-closed plant loomed large in the town I grew up in. The mill was on
 the edge of railroad tracks, the signs above its doorways and walkways 
peeling paint, the rebar in its docks rusting through flaked concrete. 
The factory was the Karagheusian Rug Mill, which at its peak in the 
1930s employed 1,700 people. I didn't grow up in the Rust Belt, but in 
Freehold, New Jersey, in the suburbs of the New York metropolitan 
region, within 50 miles of Times Square. Freehold also happens to be 
Bruce Springsteen's hometown. (Though New Jersey went for Clinton, 
voters in Monmouth County, where Freehold is, chose Trump by a very 
comfortable 53% to 42% for Clinton.)<br>
He memorialized the mill in his 1984 song "My Hometown." with the famous
 lines: "They're closing down the textile mill 'cross the railroad 
tracks. Foreman says these jobs are going, boys, and they ain't coming 
back." I was in high school when the song came out, sitting in class 
with the children of families who had devoted their working lives to 
making carpets that graced Radio City Music Hall, the United States 
Supreme Court and many other landmark buildings. I might have been 
middle class myself, the child of Harvard-educated parents, but the 
working class was not an abstraction to me; they were my friends and 
their families who were hit hard by the bad times that never seemed to 
end.<br>
Now 30 years after high school, I'm based in Ann Arbor, one of the 
Midwest's most elite academic bubbles. Living down the road from 
Detroit, it's hard not to think of Bruce when listening to Rust Belt 
stories of economic struggle. Yet the students and wealthy locals I 
encounter in this liberal enclave seem entirely disconnected from the 
experience of the American worker so prevalent on the Sanders or Trump 
campaign trails.<br>
I see the Springsteen paradox here in Ann Arbor, which, according to a 
2015 study published in the Atlantic's CityLab, is America's eighth most
 economically segregated city. And it shows. In an undergraduate 
entrepreneur class I audited at the Ross Business School, I was struck 
that many students' imaginary business plans spoke of manufacturing in 
China. In their defense, they are surrounded by industrial ruin, so 
maybe they see no hope for America's manufacturing future. And though 
there are some University of Michigan programs looking at Detroit, 
still, I found myself asking, don't they feel any sense of desire to put
 their fellow Americans back to work?<br>
I get a different view traveling around this blue bubble. I'm living 
here without a car, which forces me to rely on buses and taxis, where I 
interact with people who have little or no access to Ann Arbor's 
academic economy. Waiting for the Greyhound bus, for example, I chat 
with the chain-smoking window clerk, who, while grateful for her job, 
listed for me her resume of well-paying industrial jobs that no longer 
exist. At station stops throughout the Midwest, the same conversations 
would happen with other underemployed rural white workers, urban blacks 
and even young liberal first-generation university students who are not 
as well off as their wealthier classmates. Taxi drivers in Ann Abor and 
Detroit tell me about how apps popular with students — in fact with 
anyone with a smartphone — have decimated their work, which though never
 entirely secure did come with some protections.<br>
In the Internet age, it's easy for those of us who never interact with 
blue-collar workers to ignore how seemingly simple things we do harm 
them in ways invisible to us. Journalists are as culpable as anyone. 
Despite our own industry's instability, we celebrate the disruptions of 
Uber, Airbnb and other apps that can lead to the loss of thousands of 
jobs, replacing them with precarious piecemeal work and leapfrogging 
over decades of progressive worker-protection legislation hard won by 
unions and community planning regulations meant to keep neighborhoods 
affordable for the working class.<br>
And that's what the Boss' songs do so flawlessly. They take the plight 
of invisible Americans and make it impossible to turn away.<br>
It's easy now for journalists to engage in well-deserved 
self-flagellation for not having a better understanding of what happened
 in Michigan. But I wasn't the only one predicting Trump's strong 
performance here. The London Review of Books wrote on how Michigan's 
Democratic US Rep. Debbie Dingell had been warning Clinton she was bound
 to lose the state unless she did more to solidify her position. (She 
didn't, as we know now, declining to campaign in a "safe" state once she
 had won the nomination.) But this isn't just about failing to predict 
an election outcome. The Springsteen paradox speaks to an empathy gap 
that needs to be closed.<br>
We need to understand how the things we celebrate, or simply accept as 
economically inevitable— from apps to cheap clothes, imported food and 
toiletries — hurt American workers by shipping once seemingly 
untouchable jobs to Canada and Mexico. If you doubt me, take a look at 
the label of your Colgate toothpaste and your Oreo cookies the next time
 you're at the grocery store. Living on the coasts, far from the center 
of American manufacturing, we might be blissfully unaware of these 
things, but the laid-off workers in the Midwest certainly are not.<br>
So I come back to the Boss. How can we have so completely absorbed his 
lyrics into the cultural fabric of modern America but still not be ready
 to understand and do something about the plight of American workers? It
 might not be particularly romantic, but how many of us choose to visit a
 restaurant instead of using Seamless or choose the checkout line with 
an actual person to ring up our drugstore purchase instead of the 
automated scanners?<br>
After the 2004 election, where despite the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and
 pending economic doom, George W. Bush won re-election, we said to 
ourselves we would listen more to the middle of the country. But instead
 both parties, with the leadership of President Barack Obama, pushed for
 job-damaging trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. 
Clinton was for it as well, until she was forced to disavow it when 
Sanders and Trump bashed it successfully on the trail. We grew 
complacent, secure in our own echo-chamber, convinced that global trade 
is a modern inevitability and not reckoning the human cost.<br>
The good news is that since the election, journalists are going to be 
more important than ever, and news consumers seem to be putting their 
money where their reading concerns are. Harvard's Nieman Lab reported 
that since the election, digital subscriptions increased at The New York
 Times and elsewhere, and donations are on the rise to ProPublica, a 
nonprofit investigative media site.<br>
Journalism remains precarious, but perhaps re-engaging with the people 
we should be writing about can be the way we as journalists reassert our
 necessity to the democratic process. Otherwise, Springsteen, who 
recently received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, might be singing 
about us one day, except by then we won't be able to afford to hear the 
show.</div>

				<div class="author">by <strong>Beazle</strong></div>
				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Guardian article (UK)<br>
January 2013 2017<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">You must feel an incredible sense of power, 
standing in front of 80,000 people. And with great power comes great 
responsibility, as Spider-Man put it. Do you feel that responsibility, 
too?</strong><br>
<br>
Well, you’ve got to look at it … you go out on stage each night as if, 
one, it’s the most important thing in your life you can do, two, it’s 
only rock’n’roll. You’ve got to be able to keep those coI’m probably not
 going to do three running somersaults at this point. But the basic 
thing, the only thing that I notice as I’ve gotten older is that you 
have certain structural weaknesses in your body that arise, and you’ve 
got to manage your physical self so it can do the essential and 
important things. So you can deliver your message and create the evening
 you want to create. So you curtail a few of the other things that at 
this point aren’t as necessary – you have the possibility of busting 
your back or your neck.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">You can remove the adornments from a cathedral, but it’s still a cathedral …</strong><br>
<br>
Yeah, exactly! Those are the only adjustments I’ve had to make. Energy 
wise, I don’t feel anything different. Physically, I don’t feel anything
 different. We’ve played some of the longest shows of our career [in 
2016], so there are a few small things, but not too much.<br>
<br>
Does it feel different to play to 70,000 people as opposed to 150 people?<br>
The machine, the inner workings of what you’re doing is exactly the 
same. You’re still working as hard to impress 150 people. The hunger in 
you that drives you to throw everything out there, amazingly enough, I 
believe would be the same in front of an audience of one. Because you’re
 trying to start a conversation, to fire up a conversation, 
fundamentally with one other person, which then extends itself, to 50, 
to 500, to 5,000 to 50,000. But the act itself is profoundly the same. 
You have to learn some different elements of your craft to play a bigger
 crowd, you have to have a certain talent for it. But the inner alchemy 
is basically the same.<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Are there shows where you don’t feel you make that connection?</strong><br>
<br>
The key is you have to take each audience on its merits. No two 
audiences are the same. If you go and play a show in Spain, it’s not the
 same as playing in Hyde Park [in London]. It’s not the same as playing 
in the States. Every audience has its own characteristics. You can’t 
expect the audience to conform to your expectations. You have to come 
out and say, “OK, I’m meeting someone new tonight. First let me meet 
them and learn a little bit about them.”<br>
So you have to come out, start playing, and get a feel for the audience 
that evening. They may be quiet. They may be wildly boisterous. They may
 overwhelm you with their energy. You may feel there’s a particular 
crowd where the energy is low. But you can’t have preconceptions – if 
the energy is low, people may simply be listening. Or they may be 
experiencing the music in a different way.<br>
<br>
I’ve had circumstances where I’ve seen somebody in the front row who 
appears completely stone-faced, not enjoying the show at all. I’ll see 
’em at another show – “Gee, that guy wasn’t having much fun at the other
 show, what’s he doing here?” And then you bump into them in the street,
 and the guy’ll go, “I’ve been the biggest fan of yours for the last 25 
years.”<br>
You can’t read what people are thinking or how they’re experiencing what
 you’re doing. So you have to have faith in what you’re doing, and you 
have to have faith in the audience when you come out. Then you have to 
go about your business until you can feel the connect happening. But 
it’s very important not to come out with a set of preconceived notions 
about who the audience is.At the big outdoor shows, there’s also the 
fact of geography: diferent songs work in different ways in different 
parts of a huge crowd. Sometimes, at your shows, I’ve found ballads work
 well at 120 yards away, because people have to be quiet. Whereas up 
close, the big numbers steamroller you. Geography matters at those gigs.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">It certainly does. The sound will shift 
every hundred yards or so. So the audience has to mentally prepare 
themselves also. You find your place where you’re located and you find 
your way into the show as it’s being presented. So the audience has work
 to do also.</strong><br>
<br>
It varies from night to night but whenever you’re going out in front of a
 crowd of any size, your body knows it. This is what I do. This is the 
only thing I do. This is the only thing I’m qualified to do. So it 
matters how I do it at night. There’s a lot of anticipatory anxiety 
which then translates into a raw shot of adrenaline once you’re out 
there. We come out to press our case very hard, about what we think 
about everything, I suppose, and life itself. And so it’s challenging 
nightly.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">But how do you find meaning, night after 
night, in Born to Run, for example? Nils Lofgren said he does it by 
remembering that while he plays it 150 times a year, the crowd don’t 
hear it 150 times a year, so he finds that person in the crowd for whom 
it’s the big event of the year and feeds off them.</strong><br>
<br>
Yeah. It’s like if you’ve written something … You work on an album in a 
hermetically sealed environment. One of the most frightening things is 
playing it for someone else. For the first time you’re hearing it 
through their ears. They’re just sitting there, but you’re hearing the 
thing totally brand new through their ears. And you’re recognising all 
its faults and all its strengths. So the thing about coming out in front
 of an audience every night is that I’m hearing what I’m doing through 
that audience’s ears. That’s what Nils was sort of explaining. I may 
have heard it 100 times, but that guy’s only hearing it that night, 
that’s all. Part of my job is to have a foot on stage and a foot in the 
audience. To have one ear to the band and one ear to the crowd. And if 
you’re doing that correctly you experience the evening through their 
ears as well as your own.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Do you never get lonely being the leader of the band, being their employer, the Boss? </strong><br>
<br>
It’s been that way for so long that I don’t really think about it much 
anymore. While you feel the fullness of what you’ve accomplished, you 
also do your best not to dwell on it very much when it doesn’t serve you
 to do so. Everyone needs a degree of anonymity, a degree of freedom of 
movement – at the end of the day, a big piece of you is still who you 
were previous to when you picked a guitar up, or before you started. You
 need to feel that person still close by. You can’t live inside your 
work; your work has got to live inside you.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Are you still friends with the E Street Band
 members in the way ordinary people are friends? If you’re in the same 
place at the same time, would you call up and have a beer</strong>?<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, very much. Everyone has families and lives in different places.
 But if I get out west, I’ll see Roy [Bittan]. If I’m in New York, Steve
 and I will make a point of bumping into each other as much as possible.
 There may be long periods where you don’t see the guys. But I’m happy 
to report that the E Street Band is still filled with people who 
actually like one another. We may not have everything in common, but 
there’s a deep mutual respect and I believe a real love between the band
 members that projects from the stage and is very real.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">At times when your status has ebbed, as it does for all artists at some point, have you found that hard to deal with?</strong><br>
<br>
Not really. Everyone has their moments when they think, “Gee, why isn’t 
everyone listening to this record I made?” But I take the ebb and flow 
of my work life, after 50 years of doing it, as a natural part of the 
dynamic of your career. But whenever you put something out there – 
particularly if you believe in it completely – you want to to be 
understood, you want it to be well received. You want to grab people’s 
ears – that’s my business. If not, you’re going to be disappointed.</div>

<br>
Billboard<br>
January 11 2017<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Can popular music be used as a political force to change people's minds? Bruce Springsteen has some thoughts on the subject.<br>
<br>
"I met one kid who said it did, but only one," Springsteen said in 
response to a fan question at an appearance at Monmouth University in 
Long Branch, New Jersey. "I tend to believe music is important to 
activism in the sense that it stirs passion, it stirs interest, it stirs
 curiosity, it moves you to question your own beliefs. It strikes 
straight to your emotions and it stirs you up inside. After you've heard
 it, I think it marinates inside of you, and ends up coming out in your 
own energy."<br>
<br>
Springsteen -- dressed simply in a red plaid shirt, black jacket and 
jeans -- sat down for a 90-minute "conversation" moderated by Grammy 
Museum executive director Robert Santelli in the University's Pollack 
Theatre for the sold-out show, which seats 700, though some chairs were 
clearly unoccupied.  A third of the tickets were reportedly allotted for
 free to students in an online lottery.<br>
<br>
In that time span, the two covered plenty of musical ground, from 
Springsteen's beginnings withSteel Mill, his nine appearances at the 
University, evolution from a 10-piece to a five-piece unit, his early 
releases, creative process, future musical plans and stories as told in 
his new memoir, Born to Run.<br>
<br>
Through it all, the 67-year old singer was engaging, insightful, candid 
and funny as he spoke of seeing The Doors and The Who at Convention Hall
 in Asbury Park ("people were shocked when the amps went up in 
smoke"...the headliner was Herman's Hermits), his simultaneous 
appearances in Time and Newsweek ("for the young people here, those were
 magazines and it was a big deal to be on the cover"), his shortcomings 
("we were awful in the studio for many years"), his understanding of the
 music business ("I was even worse"), opening for Grand Funk Railroad 
("we blew them off the stage") and the group's first trip to San 
Francisco and the discovery that another musical act was "better than 
us" ("it came as a terrible shock," he joked).<br>
<br>
When asked about his political activism, Springsteen never talked 
directly about president-elect Donald Trump, but instead cited Pete 
Seeger's "If I Had a Hammer" and "Where Have All the Flower's Gone?" 
(also covered by  Peter, Paul and Mary) as examples of musical pieces 
"directly aimed at socially, politically conscious people and are 
important in the same way hymns are important in church."<br>
<br>
"It makes us stronger in our beliefs. And in a certain moment, the right song can start a fire," he said. <br>
<br>
Or a song can lose you fans, as he says his song "41 Shots (American Skin)" did. <br>
<br>
"It successfully pissed people off for a while, I ran into people who 
didn't like me very much," he said. "Then there were some people who 
really liked what I did a lot. It can stir the pot. It can bring ideas 
to the fore, and it can create dialogue and conversation and create 
argument out of which hopefully comes some sort of small resolution of 
events. Songs do have the capacity to translate and to communicate, and 
to sustain and serve."<br>
<br>
Springsteen's songs and legacy will now be preserved through a new 
partnership at the University with the just announced The Bruce 
Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music. Through the 
collaboration, Monmouth University -- an affiliate of the Grammy museum 
-- is now the official archival repository for Springsteen's written 
works, photographs, periodicals, and artifacts. <br>
<br>
Since 2011, the college -- which offers a music industry program in the 
curriculum -- has served as the home of the Bruce Springsteen Special 
Collection. The Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music
 will integrate the history and inspiration of American music into the 
curriculum and research experience at Monmouth. <br>
<br>
There were plenty of light hearted moments in the talk as well, as 
Springsteen discussed his Jersey roots and his feigned horror after 
reading an article that "says that New Jersey remains the No. 1 state 
that people move away from."<br>
<br>
"After all my hard work," he laughed. "But I made my living writing 
about moving away from New Jersey, so maybe that has something to do 
with it." <br>
<br>
Being from New Jersey, he said, was his ace in the hole after Columbia 
Records tried to package him as a new Bob Dylan and arranged a photo 
shoot in New York City. Even after playing shows at Max's Kansas City, 
sharing the same stage as The New York Dolls and Bob Marley &amp; the 
Wailers, he didn't feel right marketing himself as a New York act.<br>
<br>
"I was wary of that particular approach, so literally I was walking down
 the boardwalk in Asbury, and the postcard was there on a postcard 
stand, and I pulled it out," he said. " And I said, 'Yeah, I'm from New 
Jersey. Who's from New Jersey? Nobody. It's all mine."  <br>
<br>
	That postcard became the cover of his 1973 debut, Greetings from Asbury
 Park. Although critically acclaimed, Springsteen remembers it sold 
23,000 copies -- and was initially thrilled with that news.<br>
<br>
"That's fantastic. Who are all these people that I don't know buying my 
album?" Springsteen recalled saying to his manager, Mike Appel, at the 
time. "The next one (The Wild, The Innocent and the E Street Shuffle) 
did a little worse because the record company sank it intentionally. We 
had a little problem there, and we had a three record deal. The third 
record, if that didn't work, we were going to be back on the street 
where we were."<br>
<br>
That next album, Born to Run, was written when the singer lived in Long Branch, not far from Monmouth University.<br>
<br>
When Santelli noted the post-Born to Run period of shows from 1976 to 
1977 were his favorite shows -- when Springsteen's lawsuit against Appel
 prevented him from recording -- the singer responded: "I'm glad you had
 a good time..we were suffering."<br>
<br>
Another funny moment came when Santelli referenced the Born in the 
U.S.A. period -- which Springsteen called a "happy accident." Santelli 
joked that the singer had "muscles" during that time, to which 
Springsteen smile and said, "I still got them."<br>
<br>
When asked about his favorite record, he said, "I always roll with 
Nebraska...that is one of my personal faves," but also gave props to his
 1987 record, Tunnel of Love.<br>
<br>
"As a record, as a whole, it's a very full piece. It directly addresses 
what I was trying to address at the time. It was a record I had never 
made before, so it was successful that way. I can listen to it now and I
 just like the writing. I recorded almost all of it by myself, and then 
Bob Clearmountain came in to fix everything so it sounded like I knew 
what I was doing," he said. "That record is still very important to me."<br>
<br>
When Santelli remarked that The E Street Band was a communal family that
 fans could "relate to," Springsteen cracked, "I found that out when I 
broke up the E Street Band."<br>
<br>
Stan Goldstein, who along with Jean Mikle wrote the Springsteen-themed 
book Rock and Roll Tour of the Jersey Shore, asked why the E Street Band
 was named after the Belmar street where original keyboardist David 
Sancious lived. Springsteen explained the band discussed it on the bus, 
and just liked the way it sounded.<br>
<br>
"I wanted it to feel mythic. I thought of James Brown and the famous 
Flames. Who were The Flames? These must be the people who hang out with 
James. Or Buddy Holly and the Crickets, those must be Buddy Holly's best
 pals," he said. "All of those bands with the "and" intrigued me because
 it was more than just the main protagonist, there was a community 
suggested."<br>
<br>
As for future records and the previously-announced solo record, Springsteen offered: "It's kind of sitting there at the moment."<br>
<br>
"I'm working on a bunch of things at one time," he noted, adding that 
recently he strummed his guitar and created a new song as his wife, 
Patti Scialfa, was "laying on the couch."<br>
<br>
He said he does have some other songs "laying around" that aren't enough
 for an album, but could see daylight one day. "There's lots of stuff in
 the vault, and if I do a second Tracks or something, I will get that 
stuff out," he added.<br>
<br>
Springsteen also said Scialfa -- who was in attendance at the talk, as 
was Jon Landau, original E Street drummer Vini Lopez and Carl "Tinker" 
West" -- is working on another album. "She's as good a singer-songwriter
 as anybody out there," he enthused. "Whenever she works on an album, I 
get to play the bass, I get to play the keyboards. I like to be of 
service...as best as I can."<br>
<br>
Music, however, is not "the family business" as far as his children are concerned.<br>
<br>
"They're all musical in their own way, but they've all found different places to express themselves," he said. <br>
<br>
In the meantime, the E Street Band is hitting the road in a few weeks 
for a month-and-a-half tour of Australia. Tuesday night's talk was 
filmed by Thom Zimny for future release.</div>

The New Zealand Herald</strong><br>
<br>
Greg Fleming on why Bruce Springsteen is the man, ahead of the singer’s return to New Zealand next weekend.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen.<br>
<br>
Heroes are tricky things, especially when it comes to rock 'n' roll, because Rock Stars are really good at letting you down.<br>
<br>
One minute it's Rust Never Sleeps then it's Reactor, or you've sat through any Dylan show post-2006.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen might just be the exception.<br>
<br>
And perhaps that's because Springsteen has never been cool. Not really 
cool like Nick Cave, Dylan or Lou Reed - I'm not sure any of those 
artists have danced with their mum onstage. Nebraska (1982) made him hip
 for a minute but the global success of Born in the USA (1984) soon 
cured that.<br>
<br>
Indeed, in certain Auckland circles in the 80s Springsteen was as 
reviled as Coldplay is today - you kept your love of The Boss quiet.<br>
<br>
I remember wearing a Born in the USA T-shirt on stage at an 80s BFM gig to jeers and protests.<br>
<br>
Fast-forward three decades and while there's little chance of me fitting
 into that T-shirt, Springsteen remains one of the biggest live acts in 
the world.<br>
<br>
While the albums of the last few years haven't troubled the charts for 
long, a Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band show is guaranteed to 
fill stadiums from Johannesburg to Stockholm and will do the same in 
Auckland later next Saturday.<br>
<br>
Despite his fame and riches, Springsteen remains the Blue Collar 
Everyman to his fans; a regular guy - the sort who'll sit and pose for 
pics and play a few tunes when he sees a guy and his fiancee down at the
 beach - as he did to a New Jersey couple a few years ago.<br>
<br>
He hasn't hit the cocaine, the rehab clinic, the bottle or the Bible and
 has been married to sometime E-Streeter Patti Sciafla since 1991 - they
 have three grown children.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the most "celebrity" thing about him is that he's been seeing a 
therapist for decades, which is one of the things we learnt in last 
year's candid autobiography, Born To Run.<br>
<br>
Sure, Dylan's Chronicles is more artful, but Springsteen's turned out to
 be a much more relatable and human story - especially when it comes to 
the personal demons that both drive and cripple him.<br>
<br>
In parts it's surprisingly moving.<br>
<br>
He says, of the death of bandmate Clarence Clemons in 2011, "Losing him was like losing the rain."<br>
<br>
And Springsteen's particularly fearless when documenting his battle with depression.<br>
<br>
"I couldn't get out of bed," he writes of an 18 month-long bout in 2000.
 "Hell, I couldn't even get a hard-on. It was like all my notorious 
energy, something that had been mine to command for most of my life, had
 been cruelly stolen away. I was a walking husk."<br>
<br>
And few could have imagined the extent of his father's mental illness or
 the difficult family dynamics he was raised in - a home where he was 
spoilt and castigated in equal measure.<br>
<br>
Though the last decade has seen E Street get a little emptier with the 
deaths of band members Clemons (2011) and Danny Frederici (2008) - the 
core unit will be back - the indefatigable Max Weinberg on drums, Garry 
Tallent on bass, Roy Bittan on keys and Stevie Van Zandt and Nils 
Lofgren on guitars.<br>
<br>
The last time Springsteen played New Zealand (2014 at Mt Smart) he played to 100,000 fans over two nights.<br>
<br>
I saw the second show, which kicked off with a scrappy solo version of 
Lorde's Royals. Then, after a few crowd pleasers, he played Born to Run 
in its entirety - although by the reaction of the crowd perhaps many 
would have preferred the other Born - Born in the USA - his biggest 
record here - which featured the previous night (am I the only 
Springsteen fan who's never liked Jungleland?).<br>
<br>
<br>
On stage Springsteen was alternately goofy, manic and dour, and - when 
the material needed - a beautiful version of My City Of Ruins dedicated 
to those lost in the Christchurch quakes - empathetic. It was a 
strangely moving moment and wasn't the last time that night where the 
barrier between star and audience was breached.<br>
<br>
That's the magic of a Springsteen show. Suddenly we were just people in a
 field mourning, celebrating, remembering; you might not have talked to 
the person standing next to you but a bond had been made and Springsteen
 was the conduit.<br>
<br>
And then he's back, mugging to the crowd, and we're laughing and rolling
 our eyes as he brings another woman up on stage to dance (rather badly)
 with.<br>
<br>
His first show in New Zealand - on a rain-drenched night at Western 
Springs in 2003 - good as it was - paled in comparison to the bigger 
shows of 2014.<br>
<br>
On his last visit Springsteen seemed more at ease with the showmanship, 
the bigger band - a horn section, backing vocalists and guitarist Tom 
Morello (his inclusion still a bone of contention among long-time fans).
 He also seemed more attune to the breadth of his work - from the 
brooding noir rock of Darkness on the Edge of Town to the frothy, pop 
cliches of Waitin' On A Sunny Day.<br>
<br>
As he has said - "The older you get, the more it matters."<br>
<br>
And live, Springsteen remains at the height of his powers. He's 67 but 
still unstoppable onstage - a couple of shows pushed four hours in 2016.
 And the live renaissance has proved a winner financially too (the 
2015/16 tour grossed over US$255 million).<br>
<br>
But it's been a rockier road musically speaking.<br>
<br>
In Born to Run he reveals how disappointed he was with the reception of 
2012's Wrecking Ball, which he considers one of his finest works.<br>
<br>
"In the States, the power of rock music as a vehicle for [political] 
ideas had diminished," he writes. "A newkind of super-pop, hip-hop and a
 variety of other exciting genres ... [were] more suited to the current 
zeitgeist."<br>
<br>
Since then there's been a lot of looking back. High Hopes (2014) was a 
patchy collection of odds and ends, and 2015's reissue of 1980's The 
River (a four-CD, three-DVD box-set) was a great excuse to take the band
 around the US and Europe one more time - and to Australasia this month.<br>
<br>
Last year he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President 
Obama, finished that autobiography, attended a raft of bookstore 
signings, continued that tour and gave some of the most revealing 
interviews of his career (check out the one with Marc Maron on his WTF 
podcast).<br>
<br>
He also has a solo record in the can.<br>
<br>
So Springsteen is hardly slowing down but he knows the road does not go on forever.<br>
<br>
That couple he sings about in Thunder Road - well they're really not 
that young anymore and neither is the audience at a Springsteen show - 
but that non-denominational joy, those big, redemptive choruses that set
 fists pumping in stadiums the world over, that sense that we're all in 
this together - that's Springsteen's secret sauce - one which remains 
both uncool and incredibly heroic; a celebration of life, hard truths 
and all, through the power of rock 'n' roll.<br>
<br>
"I come out on stage to deliver to you the greatest band in the world," he told the Guardian last year.<br>
<br>
"I still have great pride in what I do. I still believe in its power. I 
believe in my ability to transfer its power to you. That's never 
changed. One of the things our band was very good at communicating was 
that sense of joy ... Rock bands try to project a lot of different 
things: intensity, mystery, sexuality, cool.<br>
<br>
"Not a lot of rock bands concentrate on joy, and I got that from my 
relatives on the Italian side - they lived it and they passed it down to
 me."<br>
<br>
State of play<br>
Springsteen chooses his set list the day of the show. He also responds to fan signs held aloft in the pit.<br>
<br>
Let's hope he plays:<br>
<br>
Incident on 57th Street - he played an incredible version of this in 
Brisbane in 2014 - but he's never played it in New Zealand - a song from
 his second album which many consider his finest ballad.<br>
<br>
Where the Bands Are - a River outtake - gorgeous garage rock.<br>
<br>
Terry's Song - a late heart-breaking addition to Magic after the death of friend and assistant Terry Magovern in 2007.<br>
<br>
Roulette - another River outtake circa 1979 - written within days of the
 Three Mile Island incident. Springsteen's first topical song; it boasts
 a guitar line very similar to Magazine's Shot By Both Sides.<br>

Saturday, February 25 with Jet and Marlon Williams &amp; The Yarra 
Benders in support.</div>

<br>
Ron Lillejord – The Stanford Daily <br>
<br>
January 16, 1979</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
“ Anyone who has seen Elvis Presley and doesn’t want to be Elvis Presley has got something wrong with him”<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen said that about four years ago, and at Winterland last
 month, he continued his obsessive pursuit of the ultimate in rock’n 
roll with a show that left everyone involved totally drained-happily 
exhausted. Joined by his phenomenal E Street Band, Springsteen put on 
the truest kind of rock celebration – one that pours out from the guts 
–from the heart.<br>
<br>
<br>
Every last ounce<br>
<br>
Springsteen and the E Streeters have the perfect  “rockin your ass off “
 philosophy, and they know how to communicate it. Everything they do is 
played like they won’t get another chance; every last ounce of energy is
 strained out of each song.  “ I don’t give a damn for just the in 
betweens”  Springsteen screams in the opening number,  “Badlands” the 
veins on his neck looking like they ‘d burst anytime. And when he 
continues, “ I want your herart, I want your soul, right now.” You’re 
damn sure he means it and he will get what he wants.<br>
<br>
The people he hadn’t convinced by that time were converted when, during 
 “ Spirits In The Night” , Springsteen threw himself on to the crowd 
massed on the floor , the people propelling him, hand by hand back to 
the stage.<br>
<br>
The full tilt fearlessness of the act infected everyone and as he 
slapped hands directly afterward, Springsteen grinned like a kid who had
 never known adulation before.  The audience was his.<br>
<br>
Dreams<br>
<br>
<br>
In the concert’s first set, Springsteen played most of  “Darkness On the
 Edge of Town” his latest (and best) album.  In “Darkness” unlike other 
Springsteen albums, there’s an intense awareness that your dreams can be
 taken away –“ crushed in the dirt” – and will be if you don’t fight for
 them.  The album is tinged with bitterness and pain and lies and stolen
 dreams but overwhelmingly, the tone is inspirational, and that’s made 
clear when the songs are done live. The extended “Prove It All Night”  
with Roy Bittan’s excellent piano brilliantly underscoring Springsteen’s
 searing guitar opening and “The Promised Land”  with the magnificent 
Clarence Clemons’ short blast on sax fitting perfectly between 
Springsteen’s solos on guitar and harmonica, are triumphant shouters 
–the roars of the survivors.<br>
<br>
The opening set ended with  “Born to Run’s” shatteringly powerful “Jungleland” .<br>
“Miami” Steve Van Zandt took on the guitar chores here, and Clemons 
dominated the song with his matchless saz solo. At the end, stark white 
lighting revealed a tensed Springsteen, who wailed  -‘ ..the poets down 
here don’t write nothin’….they just stand back and let it all be.”  It 
was a dramatic emotional shift: the lyrics snarled out in pure anger. In
 a new song, “Point Blank”, and again in a lengthy story told in the 
middle of “Backstreets”  about a lover who lied to him, Springsteen 
would again turn frighteningly personal. You wanted to either turn away 
or cry. It’s the not-too-pretty flip side of being a rock’n roll 
survivor.<br>
<br>
In the second set, the good time rock side was allowed to burst free. 
The set was dominated by  Springsteen songs that have been covered by 
others, including “Fire”  where Bruce did a very good “Elvis” imitation 
and a rowdy “Because The Night”  which blew away the strong Patti Smith 
version.<br>
<br>
“Because The Night” is the closest Springsteen comes to English heavy 
metal; as he prowls the stage with his guitar flashing, the notes of the
 instrument ripping through the hall, you know that the man has heard  
Jimmy Page – and that he’s got nothing to apologise for as far as his 
playing goes. <br>
<br>
In honor of the Christmas season, Springsteen even pulled out his rocked
 up “ Santa Claus is Coming To Town” . Clemons put on a red cap and 
supplied the rich bass tones of “…you better be good for goodness sake.”<br>
<br>
<br>
Harder and Harder<br>
<br>
<br>
“Backstreets”, “She’s the One” and “Rosalita” completed the set in 
forceful fashion. Springsteen and band kept pushing harder and harder 
during this half hour assault; there was no dip in the energy level. In 
“Backstreets’ Danny Federeci contributed moving organ work. Drummer Max 
Weinberg powered “She’s The One” and its short intro, the oldie “Hey 
Mona”  with a massive bass drum beat. Bassist Gary Tallent couldn’t  
stop moving – in “Rosalita” he jumped up and down like a crazed man.<br>
<br>
After the two and half a hours plus that preceded them, the energy and 
intensity of the concert’s encores were simply difficult to believe. The
 anthem “Born To Run” came first followed by the sing along “Tenth 
Avenue Freeze-Out” . Then cam a dizzying succession of golden oldies : 
“Raise Your Hand”, “Devil with The Bliue Dress On”, “Good Golly Miss 
Molly” and “Spinning like a Spinning top”; all frenzied, good time 
danceable rock.<br>
<br>
<br>
Powerhouse Version<br>
<br>
The concert ended with a powerhouse version of the Gary US Bonds oldie “
 A Quarter To Three” . Sitting just off stage, Bill Graham shook his 
head as if to say “he doesn’t have to do this ! ”  when Springsteen 
jumped off ten foot high speakers.<br>
<br>
Springsteen paused numerous times during the song, saying at one  point,
 “I think I’m going to throw up” at another assuming a De Niro pose and 
asking “..are you talkin’ to me ?” in response to the crowd’s cheers. 
Then he would go and beat his brains out again belting out the chorus 
for all its worth.<br>
<br>
Revival meeting<br>
<br>
<br>
At the very end, it was like a revival meeting, Springsteen screaming as
 loud as he could  - “ I’m just a prisoner ……of ROCK AND ROLL …..Do you 
understand me ?”     Then he  left whipping his coat in the air, the 
cheers deafening.<br>
<br>
And at that moment, I didn’t much care that I was completely exhausted 
and couldn’t hear or talk very well. All I wanted to do with my 
remaining energy was rave about this guy – what he does is the best 
thing going right now.<br>
<br>
Neil Young put it simply – “Hey , hey. My, my. Rock and roll can never 
die” – and its true, because the rock spirit will always be around, on 
the street , somewhere. That spirit was a big part of what Winterland 
was, and people like Bruce Springsteen, will, I think,  keep proving 
that it is around – proving it all night.</div>

<br>
The Onion<br>
<br>
March 23, 2017</strong><br>
<br>
FREEHOLD, NJ—Saying it hasn’t always been easy inventing reasons for not
 attending one of his gigs, local man John Gilman, 68, told reporters 
Thursday that he has spent approximately 50 years coming up with excuses
 to avoid checking out the band of high school classmate Bruce 
Springsteen.<br>
<br>
An insurance adjuster and friend of Springsteen since the mid-1960s when
 the acclaimed singer-songwriter played small venues in Monmouth County,
 New Jersey, Gilman told reporters that over the past half century he 
has falsely cited homework, car trouble, his kids’ baseball games, and 
late nights at the office as just a few of the reasons he could not be 
present at Springsteen’s shows.<br>
<br>
“After the first few times I told him I couldn’t make it, I thought he’d
 take the hint and figure I just wasn’t interested, but he’s never 
stopped asking,” said Gilman, who hastened to add that he couldn’t be 
happier his friend’s band is doing so well. “I love Bruce, but it’s kind
 of a hassle to drop everything on a Friday night and drive up to 
Madison Square Garden or wherever. So I tell him I’m too busy to make it
 this time, but to count me in next time. I’ve been doing that since I 
was 17 years old.”<br>
<br>
“I remember back in ’87 he gave me an early demo of Tunnel Of Love and 
told me he thought I’d really like it,” Gilman continued. “I thanked him
 and said I’d give it a listen, but to be honest, it’s just been sitting
 in a drawer.” <br>
<br>
In the decades since his friend formed the E Street Band and began to 
earn widespread critical accolades for albums like The Wild, The 
Innocent &amp; The E Street Shuffle, Gilman confirmed he has lied about 
his absence at Springsteen’s concerts by claiming he was sick 37 times, 
had a dinner party to attend 29 times, was out of town for a cousin’s 
wedding 18 times, and, on seven occasions, had to get up early the next 
morning for a dentist appointment.<br>
<br>
According to Gilman, the closest he has come to actually seeing his 
friend play was a night in 1971 when he walked by the Upstage Club in 
Asbury Park, noticed Springsteen’s band was on the bill, and briefly 
considered going inside. He ultimately concluded, however, that the 
venue was too crowded and would probably be too hot as well.<br>
<br>
“It was really hard when he did that 10-night stand at the Meadowlands, 
because I had to come up with something new to tell him every night,” 
said Gilman, referring to Springsteen’s legendary series of performances
 at Giants Stadium during his 2003 tour for The Rising. “It was really 
sweet of him to send me front row tickets to all of those shows, but 
big, loud concerts like that just aren’t my thing, you know?”<br>
<br>
“Now anytime he has that many dates scheduled in New Jersey, I make sure to tell him I’m on vacation,” added Gilman.<br>
<br>
To Gilman’s surprise, the multiplatinum recording artist has only grown 
more insistent in recent years, even going so far as to send him a copy 
of 2012’s Grammy-nominated Wrecking Ball and then call him a few days 
later to ask if he liked it. In order to avoid wounding his friend’s 
pride, Gilman reportedly glanced at the track list and remarked that 
“Easy Money” was “really great,” despite having never listened to it or 
any other song in Springsteen’s 18-album catalog.<br>
<br>
“Sometimes I get lucky and there’s a real-life event I can use as an 
excuse, like that time in ’93 when an accident in the Lincoln Tunnel had
 traffic backed up so bad I wouldn’t have been able to make it to his 
MTV Unplugged taping even if I’d wanted to,” Gilman said. “But for the 
most part, it just gets harder over the years. There are only so many 
ways I can change the subject when he asks if I’ve gotten around to 
checking out ‘Built To Run’ or whatever.”<br>
<br>
“I do occasionally feel guilty,” he added. “I mean, Bruce and his bandmates have helped me move like half a dozen times.”</div>

Lifestyle magazine<br>
June 2008<br>
<br>
By Erik Kirschbaum | BERLIN</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
When Bruce Springsteen spoke out against the Berlin Wall at the biggest 
concert in East German history in 1988, no one in the crowd of 160,000 
had the faintest idea that the symbol of the Cold War would soon be 
history.<br>
<br>
But now -- 20 years after the American rock star went behind the Iron 
Curtain -- organizers, historians and people who witnessed it say his 
message came at a critical juncture in German history in the run-up to 
the Wall's collapse.<br>
<br>
It was not the only show that summer with political fallout. In June, a 
concert for Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday in London was beamed to 
millions worldwide. Two years later he was freed from an apartheid jail 
and later elected South Africa president.<br>
<br>
<br>
Such concerts for a cause remain part of the summer music calendar, even if their impact is diluted in the internet age.<br>
<br>
Springsteen, an influential songwriter and singer whose lyrics are often
 about people struggling, got permission at long last to perform in East
 Berlin in 1988.<br>
<br>
Even though his songs are full of emotion and politics, East Germany had
 welcomed him as a "hero of the working class". The Communists may have 
unwittingly created an evening that did more to change East Germany than
 Woodstock did to the United States.<br>
<br>
Annoyed at the billing "Concert for Nicaragua" that Communist East 
German leaders stamped on his July 19 performance, Springsteen stopped 
halfway through the three-hour show for a short speech -- in heavily 
accented German:<br>
<br>
"I want to tell you I'm not here for or against any government," 
Springsteen said, as he pointedly introduced his rendition of the Bob 
Dylan ballad "Chimes of Freedom".<br>
<br>
"I came to play rock 'n' roll for you East Berliners in the hope that one day all the barriers will be torn down."<br>
<br>
The words fed the discontent building in East Germany and added to a 
restless mood in the country severed from the West after World War Two 
-- and especially in the city split by the Wall, built during the 
darkest hours of the Cold War in 1961.<br>
<br>
TASTE OF FREEDOM<br>
<br>
The East German organizer told Reuters hardline leaders only reluctantly
 endorsed the plan by the Communist party's FDJ youth group to let 
Springsteen in. It was an era of change sparked by the "perestroika" 
reforms of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.<br>
<br>
"It obviously wasn't easy and we had to fight hard to get permission but
 we eventually succeeded," Roland Claus, an ex-FDJ leader and now a 
member of parliament, said in an interview. East German hardliners were 
skeptical of Gorbachev.<br>
<br>
"The higher-ups understood that rock music was international and if East
 Germany wanted to do something to improve the lot of young people, we'd
 have to try it," he said. "We were proud we got him and had great hopes
 it'd help modernize East Germany."<br>
<br>
Instead, the open-air concert at a cycling arena only seemed to make 
East Germans long more for the freedoms that Springsteen sang and spoke 
about in a show also broadcast on TV and radio.<br>
<br>
"We were interested in opening the country up," said Claus, 53. "No one 
thought the Wall would be gone a year later. Anyone in the East or West 
who said that would have been considered insane. It was a great concert 
with a special atmosphere."<br>
<br>
AMERICANS IN BERLIN<br>
<br>
Other Americans had spoken out against the Wall in Berlin.<br>
<br>
But both presidents John F. Kennedy in 1963 ("Ich bin ein Berliner") and
 Ronald Reagan in 1987 ("Tear down this Wall") gave their addresses in 
West Berlin.<br>
<br>
Springsteen delivered his words in the heart of East Berlin, where 
Communist East Germany had long portrayed the United States as a 
decadent and belligerent "class enemy".<br>
<br>
"Springsteen's concert and speech certainly contributed in a larger 
sense to the events leading up to the fall of the Wall," said Gerd 
Dietrich, a historian at Berlin's Humboldt University.<br>
<br>
"It was a paradoxical situation. Before Springsteen, the FDJ had always 
cursed Western rock artists like Springsteen. And then all of a sudden 
they were welcoming him. It looked like they were caving in to the 
shifting values of young people."<br>
<br>
Dietrich, 63, said Communist party hopes that a small taste of 
Springsteen might pacify youths backfired. There was even a positive 
advance review in the Neues Deutschland daily: "He attacks social wrongs
 and injustices in his homeland."<br>
<br>
"But it didn't work out as planned," Dietrich said. "It made people 
eager for change. The organizers wanted to demonstrate their openness. 
But Springsteen aroused a greater interest in the West. It showed people
 how locked up they really were."<br>
<br>
Cherno Jobatey, now a well-known German TV anchorman, was another 
witness to the East Berlin Springsteen concert, writing about it as a 
young reporter for the West Germany weekly Die Zeit under a headline 
"Born in the DDR".<br>
<br>
He wrote Springsteen had longed to put on a concert in East Berlin since
 he paid a visit there in 1981. Jobatey described a rowdy mood 
beforehand -- surprising in a country where security police clampdowns 
were usually quick and ruthless.<br>
<br>
Jobatey, 42, reported the crowd erupted when Springsteen called for "the
 barriers" to be torn down. "There was thunderous applause from the 
crowd endorsing that proposal," he wrote.<br>
<br>
Jobatey told Reuters recently it was hard to know if Springsteen had 
helped set in motion the chain of events leading to the Berlin Wall's 
fall 16 months later. But he said it was a magical evening just before 
the upheaval gained momentum.<br>
<br>
"The music was great and he showed people a different experience, a 
different way life, a different world," Jobatey said. "There was an 
incredible vibe to it all. It was an amazing thing to experience in the 
middle of East Berlin."<br>
<br>
He said the concert probably affected East Germany more thoroughly than the 1969 Woodstock Festival did America.<br>
<br>
"People didn't want to leave when it was over," he said. "The police 
gave up after a while. I walked back across town for about two hours and
 everywhere everyone was happy and on a real high. But it didn't feel 
like a revolution, just yet anyhow."<br>
<br>
COMMUNIST BOSSES GET SCARED<br>
<br>
Claus, who organized the concert, acknowledged there was some chaos -- 
remarkable in a country with such an omniscient and oppressive security 
apparatus -- as 160,000 people arrived at a venue with a 120,000 
capacity; 100,000 tickets were sold.<br>
<br>
"We had to take down all the crush barriers, gates and fences to the 
concert because so many people showed up," he said. "We had to resort to
 the best instrument we had: anarchy."<br>
<br>
After Springsteen there were many other Western artists eager to come 
despite modest fees -- Springsteen tickets were 20 East German marks (or
 about $1).<br>
<br>
"Word of the huge crowd and great enthusiasm in East Berlin spread," 
Claus said. "A lot of international stars wanted to come after that. I 
spent a lot of time working on plans for a U2 concert in East Berlin 
that we wanted to do in August 1989."<br>
<br>
But the U2 concert never happened. By that point thousands of East 
Germans were streaming out of the country to the West, the final act 
that led to the Berlin Wall's opening on November 9.<br>
<br>
"I was trying to organise a parallel East-West concert with U2 in East 
Berlin and Duran Duran in West Berlin," Claus said. "But I couldn't get 
approval anymore from the higher-ups. They were too afraid. There was so
 much turmoil by that point."</div>

<br>
Rolling Stone<br>
By Daniel Kreps<br>
June 16, 2017</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen will reportedly stage an intimate Broadway residency 
this fall as the rocker will perform eight weeks of solo concerts at New
 York's Walter Kerr Theatre.<br>
<br>
"[Springsteen] wants to play a smaller house. He wants to try something 
more intimate, and he likes the idea of being on Broadway," a source 
told the New York Post of Springsteen's plans, which include five shows a
 week for eight weeks starting in November.<br>
<br>
A representative for Springsteen did not respond to Rolling Stone's request for comment.<br>
<br>
The Walter Kerr Theatre, which seats 975 people, has been unoccupied 
since the Broadway production of Amelie closed in May. Rather than let 
the venue sit empty, the Kerr's owner Jujamcyn Theaters offered 
Springsteen the theater rent-free; Springsteen will receive ticket 
revenues while the Kerr Theatre will get the profits from alcohol sales.
 "He'll keep the lights on in the building, and they'll sell gazillions 
of dollars worth of booze," the source added.<br>
<br>
The Post also posits that Springsteen's Great White Way run is a 
precursor for a potential Broadway musical based on his recent memoir 
Born to Run, though that has yet to be confirmed by Springsteen or 
anyone in his camp.<br>
<br>
Springsteen has been off the road since his tour celebrating his 1980 LP
 The River concluded in February. Since then, the rocker has appeared 
onstage alongside Steven Van Zandt as the E Street guitarist promotes 
his new solo album. In April, Springsteen sat down for an intimate 
conversation with Tom Hanks for the Tribeca Film Festival.</div>

by Colton Faull August 09, 2017 at 10:39 AM<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
In his original review for Scene of Bruce Springsteen’s Aug. 9, 1978, 
show at the Agora Jim Girard wrote, “In case you haven’t noticed, rock 
and roll has a new king. His name is Bruce Springsteen.” It was a bold 
statement, but everyone seemed to know that the show would be an 
experience they would never forget. “It was obvious to the lucky 
thousand or so Clevelanders that they were witnessing what could only be
 described as a truly historic event,” Giard went on.<br>
<br>
1978 was not Cleveland’s best year. Fortune 500 companies were leaving 
the city en masse, and the Great Blizzard got an early start in 
transforming the city into a ghost town. Even the night of the 
Springsteen show was not a pleasant one. It was hot and muggy outside, 
recalls John Gorman, author of The Buzzard: Inside The Glory Days of 
WMMS and Cleveland Rock Radio, over the phone. “There wasn’t a lot of 
good news to hear about in Cleveland but the one bright spot was rock 
and roll in the city.”<br>
<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s 1978 tour, often dubbed the Darkness Tour, was in support 
of his latest album at the time, Darkness on the Edge of Town. He 
performed in a mix of arenas and smaller clubs like the Agora. 
“Springsteen in Cleveland was no longer a club act by any stretch of the
 imagination. He could fill, at the time, the Coliseum, which was the 
biggest venue around,” said Gorman. <br>
<br>
Springsteen was in the midst of getting back into the public eye 
following a lawsuit with his manager that halted his career for a couple
 of years, and “Cleveland had gained a national reputation as an 
important break-out market for new music.” While Springsteen had already
 broken in the eastern seaboard market (New York, Jersey Shore, and 
Philadelphia) he really “became somebody to contend with when Cleveland 
embraced him,” according to Gorman.<br>
<br>
<br>
Part of what made the show so legendary was that it was broadcast live 
on WMMS, as part of the station’s 10th anniversary, and on eight other 
FM stations across the Midwest including St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Chicago,
 Detroit, and Minneapolis. The show would later become one of the most 
bootlegged concerts in history until it received an official release in 
2014. It “is one of those rare live albums that transports you to the 
front row of the hall,” says the Guardian’s Michael Hamm.<br>
<br>
Gorman, who managed WMMS at the time and was in attendance that night, 
talked to us about the show and what made it so legendary.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">How did Springsteen end up playing at the Agora?</strong><br>
<br>
Gorman: Originally the label, before Steve Popovich intervened and we 
[WMMS] complained very loudly, the show was either going to be in 
Detroit or Chicago because those are the two larger markets. They were 
not looking at Cleveland, but it was a case of — we fought over it and 
we used the same line we used for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: if 
it’s in another city it’s just another concert, if it’s in Cleveland it 
is the concert.<br>
<br>
The reason this concert was happening in the first place was, 
Springsteen had been out of the public eye for a couple of years. 
Following the Born to Run album, he got into a lengthy litigation with 
his former manager. It really prevented him from working and prevented 
him from releasing any music during that time. It was unfortunate 
because Springsteen had made the cover of Time and Newsweek and his 
career was on the way and then this was like hitting a brick wall. The 
public wants more from him but he couldn’t deliver. The label looked at 
it as we’ve gotta reintroduce Bruce Springsteen to the masses. We’ve got
 to gain those people that he already won over and also further his 
career. The label decided on doing a series of club concerts and then 
regionally broadcast them.<br>
<br>
The other thing too, it really helped WMMS because it coincided with the
 station’s 10th anniversary. So that became another thing, we were able 
to put it under the banner as a WMMS anniversary concert. It was 
something that Cleveland could be proud of; for that reason alone in an 
otherwise very bad year for Cleveland it’s noteworthy.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Why did this show stick out more than any other show on that tour?</strong><br>
<br>
What made the Cleveland one unique — and I have to say that not only did
 Bruce and the band pour their hearts and souls into the performance — 
but what makes a great performer better is the audience. And in 1978 
there was no better rock and roll audience in America than Cleveland. If
 a band plays the East Coast and West Coast, people sit on their hands. 
They don’t get as excited. They don’t sing along, they don’t become a 
part of the concert. There’s that coolness factor, which isn’t very 
cool. Meanwhile when an act plays Cleveland, the audience gets really 
enthused, the audience gets behind the band, they become part of the 
performance. That was the uniqueness of that concert and that’s why it’s
 looked at as part of one of Springsteen’s greatest if not his greatest 
concert. Because he had 100-percent connection with the audience, he and
 the band was firing on all cylinders. It was just a perfect storm, an 
incredible two to three hours of music.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">How many people were at the Agora that night?</strong><br>
<br>
I think legally the Agora had a capacity of 800, might have been a few 
over. I don’t know; I saw nothing but everybody having a good time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Why was this show being broadcast on so many other FM stations?</strong><br>
<br>
It was reintroducing Bruce Springsteen to the rest of the country. In 
Cleveland they never stopped loving Bruce Springsteen. The same is true 
for the eastern seaboard. But for the rest of the country Bruce 
Springsteen was this new artist that they first heard with Born to Run 
and then the momentum was building and he was developing, then — bang — 
the lawsuit hit and there was a brick wall. Springsteen couldn’t record,
 he couldn’t perform. You always have to come back for an encore, when 
you finally have that taste of success the first thing you have to think
 of is what are you gonna do for an encore? Springsteen wasn’t even 
allowed to do half that encore for years.<br>
<br>
These concerts were put together to jumpstart his career. He had just 
released a new album, Darkness, so this is also reintroducing him as an 
artists and helping people catch on with his new album. I think it 
worked in those other cities because the concert they heard coming from 
the Agora in Cleveland is one of the most amazing live concerts in 
history<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What was the impact of the recording after that night?</strong><br>
<br>
The reason why more stations ended up broadcasting the show, after the 
Cleveland performance it became known like, 'Man, did you hear about the
 Springsteen concert in Cleveland?’ So it became a much dubbed 
broadcast. I know that even though Springsteen did a concert in San 
Francisco, the San Francisco station that originated that broadcast also
 broadcasted the Cleveland show on a later date because it was so 
unique. A number of other stations ended up getting copies of the 
Springsteen concert in Cleveland and played it. I heard it was either 
the first or second most bootlegged concert in history. I think it was a
 tie between Bruce Springsteen at the Agora and Led Zeppelin at the 
Coliseum.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Are there any particular memories that stick out for you from that night?</strong><br>
<br>
It was the single best concert I’ve ever seen in my life. It was just 
one of those unique nights where everything came together. The audience 
was great, Springsteen was at his absolute peak. It was pure 
entertainment, it was pure energy. I’ve seen thousands of concerts but I
 compare all of them against this one. It was something very very 
positive for Cleveland, for the history books in an otherwise bad year 
in Cleveland at the time. That concert sort of made everything else go 
away. Yeah, it was a bad year but we had that Springsteen concert.</div>

Inside Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift's War on Scalpers, Ticket Bots<br>
New software finally putting a dent in secondary ticket market – but not without controversy<br>
<br>
By Steve Knopper<br>
<br>
September 11, 2017</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen's team was cautiously optimistic on August 30th, as 
the first round of tickets went on sale for "Springsteen on Broadway," a
 run of 79 solo acoustic shows in a small theater in New York. 
Springsteen knew demand for tickets would be enormous, and wanted to 
make sure they did not go to brokers, many of whom use advanced 
technology to snatch up 30 to 50 percent of tickets to high-demand 
shows, then resell them on sites like StubHub. Springsteen decided to 
try out Verified Fan, a new service that asks fans to sign up before 
tickets go on sale; after being vetted by the service, they receive a 
code that places them in a smaller pool, shutting out scalpers in the 
process.<br>
<br>
It worked: The next day, only about three percent of the Springsteen 
tickets made it to secondary-market sites. That's compared to seven to 
twenty percent of the tickets on his 2016 tour, according to TicketIQ, a
 site that compiles the best ticket resale deals for concertgoers.<br>
<br>
The Broadway sale was a major victory for the concert industry, which 
has been grappling with scalpers for years. The ticket-resale market, 
reportedly worth $8 billion, depends on "bots," or automating software, 
to scoop up hundreds of tickets at a time. Verified Fan, though, has its
 own algorithm, which approves buyers by looking at their data, 
including e-mail addresses and past ticket purchases. Since Dead &amp; 
Company started using the service last year, more than 50 other artists 
have gotten on board, including Foo Fighters and Harry Styles, with 
results similar to Springsteen's. "It's like a TSA precheck to make sure
 those registering for these presales are fans," says Brian Cross, a 
manager for LCD Soundsystem.<br>
<br>
The system has caused some controversy. The same week as the Springsteen
 sale, Taylor Swift announced she would be using the service for her 
first tour since 2015. Swift's plan had a twist: While Springsteen's 
ticket-buyers are picked purely by algorithm, Swift's fans can increase 
their chances of scoring tickets. Their place in line is determined by 
"boosts." Those boosts can be earned by tweeting and streaming – and 
also by buying merchandise. A $75 hoodie and a $60 gold-snake ring are 
among the items that will give fans priority in line. Several industry 
veterans criticized the plan to Rolling Stone. "It's about profit," says
 Gary Adler, executive director of the National Association of Ticket 
Brokers. "You don't have to look too deep to know it's designed to make 
you buy merchandise. 'Beating the bots' is a very clever 
public-relations move to hide the profit motive, because we're easy 
targets."<br>
<br>
Swift's representative vehemently disagreed, arguing the plan will put 
more hardcore fans in seats: "Taylor rewarding her fans for posting 
selfies, watching YouTube videos and downloading her albums, things that
 her fans are already doing, is a great thing."<br>
<br>
Brokers shut out of "Springsteen On Broadway" and other Verified Fan 
shows accuse Ticketmaster of trying to corner the lucrative secondary 
ticket market for itself. The ticketing giant has its own reseller, 
TicketsNow, and offers marked-up seats through TM+; for U2's University 
of Phoenix stadium show September 19th, ticketmaster.com offers 
face-value seats for $165 just a few rows back from scalped tickets for 
$563. "Ticketmaster is trying to do everything they can to monopolize 
both the primary and the secondary market," says Ram Silverman, a 
longtime ticket broker who owns Golden Tickets in Plano, Texas. "If a 
good show sells out in five minutes, does that mean you should be 
limited to only using TM+ because they tell you to? That's ridiculous."<br>
<br>
None of this matters to touring stars like Pearl Jam, Adele and Eric 
Church, who prefer to stop scalpers outright rather than trying to keep 
the revenue from resales. "I would recommend any service that would 
eliminate scalping," says Stuart Ross, a veteran manager and tour 
director for Tom Waits, who has opposed all forms of ticket reselling 
for years. "Tom would not want to go into any situation where scalpers 
have free access to tickets. As long as there's an option, you should 
use the option."<br>
<br>
Many anti-scalping artists, including Waits, have used another 
Ticketmaster option, paperless ticketing, which requires fans to show 
IDs and credit cards to get into a venue. Although the practice is 
especially effective in cutting off scalping for smaller shows—it can be
 unwieldly for fans waiting in line at arena and stadium concerts—it was
 unavailable for "Springsteen On Broadway" because New York's state 
legislature voted to essentially ban paperless ticketing a few years 
ago. "I would much rather stop a scalper from buying tickets in the 
first place than have to do the cancelations and scrubbings and whatnot 
that we did last time," says Fielding Logan, one of Church's managers, 
who oversees ticketing.<br>
<br>
Church's management office keeps a "straight-up scalper blacklist," as 
Logan calls it, and has employees dedicated to identifying buying 
patterns of resellers. Earlier this year, the office canceled the sale 
of more than 25,000 tickets. Logan, who heads the program, points to red
 flags, like a bulk order from Brooklyn for a Louisville, Kentucky, 
show. "There is definitely an element of 'I know it when I see it,' " 
says Logan. "Eric's not trying to change the world. He just wants to 
take care of his fans and get his house in order. So part of the 
strategy here is to be the biggest pain in the ass for scalpers."</div>

It’s not a small rock show or a theatrical event. Inspired by a White 
House concert, one of rock’s celebrated storytellers is bringing his 
tales to a new stage.<br>
<br>
By JON PARELES<br>
SEPTEMBER 27, 2017<br>
The New York Times</strong><br>
<br>
“Springsteen on Broadway.” For the songwriter who rose from bar gigs on 
the Jersey Shore to become a symbol of empathy for working-class 
America, who has been playing arenas for nearly four decades, the simple
 juxtaposition seems like a clash of scale and style. Is this an 
intimate concert, or a theatrical event? Mr. Springsteen says it’s 
something else, and that an extended Broadway residency is the statement
 he wants to make now.<br>
<br>
It started at the White House. On Jan. 12, in the last weeks of the 
Obama administration, Mr. Springsteen played an acoustic concert in the 
East Room as the Obama family’s parting gift for about 250 staffers. For
 Mr. Springsteen, who takes every performance seriously, it was a moment
 of reckoning. He carefully assembled a set list spanning his career; he
 illuminated the songs with spoken stories and memories echoing “Born to
 Run,” the autobiography he published in 2016.<br>
<br>
“There was a lot of storytelling, which goes back to our early days at 
the Bottom Line when you were in front of a couple of hundred people,” 
Mr. Springsteen said in an interview at his home studio in Colts Neck, 
N.J., recalling the Greenwich Village club where his shows in summer 
1975 became a sensation. “It worked in a very, very intimate setting.”<br>
<br>
Heading home from Washington, Mr. Springsteen and his wife, Patti 
Scialfa, and his manager, Jon Landau, thought more people should 
experience a performance like that. “The way he combines the spoken 
words with the songs he’s chosen to do sounds like a very simple thing,”
 Mr. Landau said. “But it’s a real piece of performance art.”<br>
<br>
The result, nine months later, is “Springsteen on Broadway,” which 
begins previews Oct. 3 and continues, five nights a week, through 
February. The show will be staged at the 960-seat Walter Kerr Theater, 
which was built in 1929 and has been the home of more Pulitzer and 
Tony-winning productions than any other Broadway theater. It will take 
Mr. Springsteen a month to perform for the number of fans he could draw 
at one arena show.<br>
<br>
Thinking that only Broadway could offer the kind of elegant, intimate 
experience they were looking for, Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Landau scouted
 theaters available from all three of the major Broadway owners — 
Shubert, Nederlander and Jujamcyn — before deciding on Jujamcyn’s Walter
 Kerr, one of the smallest. “They were really connecting with all angles
 of it — trying seats in all different locations, standing on the stage,
 coming back multiple times,” said Jordan Roth, the president of 
Jujamcyn Theaters.<br>
<br>
In Broadway terms, Mr. Springsteen is planning a one-man show; unlike 
his arena marathons, he’ll be onstage for two hours with a baby grand 
piano and an “array of guitars,” he said. But he intends to offer 
something different from a typical concert, where the songs and spoken 
words will add up to what he calls a “third entity.”<br>
<br>
“This isn’t a rock concert transported onto a small stage,” Mr. Roth 
said. “This is an experience of storytelling through word and through 
song, and that is what we do on Broadway. That is what the theater is.”<br>
<br>
The production uses seasoned Broadway hands. Its lighting designer, 
Natasha Katz, won Tony Awards for “Once” and “An American in Paris”; its
 sound designer, Brian Ronan, won Tonys for “The Book of Mormon” and 
“Beautiful: The Carole King Musical” and a Drama Desk award for Sting’s 
musical, “The Last Ship.” But the show doesn’t have a director. To 
manage a ticketing demand rarely seen on Broadway (outside of 
blockbusters like “Hamilton”), Mr. Springsteen’s tickets are being sold 
via Verified Fan, a Ticketmaster system that aims to cut down on 
scalping. Still, tickets are going for $700 to $2,400 on StubHub.<br>
<br>
“Our idea was to respect Broadway as a unique place and to try and to do
 what’s customary as long as our creative needs were being met,” Mr. 
Landau said, listing off what he called “the conventions of Broadway”: 
“The show starts, there’s absolute silence. People stay in their seats.”
 He added, “It invites a certain decorum and a certain atmosphere that 
is very conducive to the nuances of what Bruce does with this particular
 show.”<br>
<br>
In Colts Neck, Mr. Springsteen led me through his home studio, a long, 
wide-open room with row upon row of guitars — “the land of 1,000 
guitars,” he said with a laugh — along with assorted keyboards and 
drums, where he has worked on most of his music for a decade. In an 
adjoining room that’s part kitchen and part living room, sipping a 
bottled water, Mr. Springsteen was thoughtful and jovial, weighing his 
words — he speaks in full paragraphs — but laughing at himself any time 
he saw the possibility of pretension. What follows is an edited version 
of the conversation.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What was the mood in the White House when you played there?</strong><br>
<br>
The feeling was the same there as it was here (laughs). There was obviously the shock and concern.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Did it affect what you played?<br>
</strong><br>
I didn’t want to do something that was all about that. My thought on it 
was, well, I’ve had a long writing life, and over those years I’ve set 
out a certain set of values. And the best you could do at that 
particular moment was just to find a show that expressed those things as
 best as I could. There’s nothing Trump-centric about what I’m doing. My
 idea was really just to present the work that I’ve done for the past 40
 years or so and let it speak for itself. I didn’t feel like I needed to
 get on a soapbox or be real ideological about it. I wanted the night to
 play very naturally, and be broad enough to be about all the things 
I’ve written about over the years. And in that way, in the contrast, it 
would comment.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">You’ve been singing for decades about people
 who are unemployed, cast aside, left behind — a forgotten working class
 that apparently turned to Trump in 2016.</strong><br>
<br>
I think it’s still very difficult times, in the sense that the 
deindustrialization that occurred in the ’70s and ’80s was really 
devastating to a whole segment of the population. And those issues were 
never really addressed by either Republicans or Democrats. It’s a 
complex problem. It involves global technology, and I don’t really know 
the answers. But I know that there was a large part of the population 
that ended up disenfranchised and I think that Trump did tap into those 
feelings with a lot of his rhetoric at the time. He’s very good at 
knowing what people want to hear.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Let’s talk about Broadway. Yours may well be the only show there that doesn’t use a director or a scriptwriter.</strong><br>
<br>
That’s me! (laughs) That’s me! I’m going to direct myself onstage and I 
wrote up the script on my own. It’s a pretty basic show. It’s going to 
feel like a garage workshop basically, and I’m going to play my songs 
and tell my stories. So it wasn’t something that called for a whole lot 
more than that.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">You’ve got a lot of experience at shaping a show.</strong><br>
<br>
That’s what I’ve spent my life doing. That was a big piece of the craft.
 If you came up in our generation of musicians, you were mentored by the
 great craftsmen of how do you make a show move, how do you make a show 
go. Sam Moore from Sam &amp; Dave, and of course James Brown, those were
 the great masters of momentum and how you keep a show going. And that 
moves over to an acoustic show. It has to have its rhythms. [For this] 
the tricky thing was finding how to tell some stories without it slowing
 down the rhythm of the show. But it’s all instinctive at this point. 
Really, John Hammond [who signed Mr. Springsteen to Columbia as a solo 
songwriter] would love this show. This is the closest thing to what I 
would have done at Max’s Kansas City in 1973, when I was coming up by 
myself.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">You’ve done solo acoustic tours in 
3,000-seat theaters, for “The Ghost of Tom Joad” and for “Devils &amp; 
Dust.” How is this different?</strong><br>
<br>
Those were more concert experiences. The sets would change. This is a 
locked-in piece of music and script that I’m going to be performing 
pretty much the same on a nightly basis. It’s a solidified piece of 
work. And I think the intimacy of the venue is going to really affect 
it, to make it quite a bit different from the acoustic tours. Though I 
don’t know if I’d be doing this without the experience of doing them. 
When I recorded “Nebraska” back in the ’80s, I didn’t tour on it because
 I wasn’t sure if I could.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Are you using video?</strong><br>
<br>
Basically it’s a one-man show. There’s no production beyond the stage, 
some lights and some very high-quality sound. I thought anything beyond 
the song and the story ended up feeling too rigid and distracting. It 
happens every time we go to do a tour, you know?<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
You did a VH1 Storytellers with some extensive spoken interludes [in 2005].</strong><br>
<br>
That would be the closest thing to what I’m doing now. When I did the 
VH1 thing, Elvis Costello came up to me later and said, “Gee, it created
 some third entity.” And that’s what I’m interested in doing with the 
show. I’m playing familiar music, but I believe it will lead you to hear
 it with very fresh ears by the context that I set it in. I always make a
 comment that when things are working in art, one plus one equals three.<br>
<br>
I think an audience always wants two things. They want to feel at home 
and they want to be surprised. And I go out every time to do those two 
things. I try to make people feel that they’ve come to some place that 
they’ve known for a long time, and then also try to surprise them with 
some new insights or new forms or new energy or just a new way of doing 
something. You’ve got to have that X factor. If you don’t have that, 
you’re dead in the water.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Do you go to Broadway shows?</strong><br>
<br>
We go on occasion. I saw “Hamilton.” I guess that was the last thing I’ve seen. It was great.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">But you didn’t try to write a Broadway musical.</strong><br>
<br>
That’s tough! I salute the guys that have given that a shot. It’s not 
the same rules as pop music writing. It’s a completely different format,
 and I think it takes a set of completely different skills. It’s not 
like, oh, I’ll write 12 songs and kind of stick them together somehow. 
The guys I know who tried it really gave a good shot at it. My friend 
Sting, I thought, did a great job [with “The Last Ship”]. But it’s a 
different thing conceiving it from the beginning to the end. I admire 
all the Broadway writers, Sondheim, who have been able to do that so 
magnificently, but it’s not something I could ever do. It just seems too
 hard.<br>
<br>
And then I’ve never really been good at, say, writing to script. In 
other words, “Now I need a song about [a certain subject].” I’ve never 
written like that. I’ve always written about what’s pressing itself upon
 me to write at a given moment. I’ve never sat back and said, well, I 
need a song about Trump, or I need a song about this happening or that 
happening. When I’ve crossed over with topical songwriting, even that 
was something that began as, you’re angry about something or you want to
 say something. That’s the feeling that comes up first.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
With your book and with “Springsteen on Broadway,” you’re surveying your whole past. Are you also writing songs?</strong><br>
<br>
I’ve finished a record. I had some inspiration. When you’re locked into a
 period of creativity it’s very similar to being hungry all the time. 
You have an appetite to write. It’s one of the nicest feelings in the 
world for a songwriter because you know what it is to be without that 
appetite. Once you lock into that, then you’re feeding yourself. 
Everywhere you go you’re hungry. So I might come up with a verse sitting
 at the kitchen table, I might be asleep and wake up in the middle of 
the night and run upstairs to my writing room and come up with another 
verse or two. Literally I do it anywhere and everywhere and that’s a 
nice place to be. It doesn’t happen that often.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Writing the book must have made you think about your life story.</strong><br>
<br>
I really never had planned on writing anything. So when it came around, 
yeah, obviously, you draw a story from your story. I supposed you’re 
contextualizing your own life for yourself, and in the course of it 
you’re trying to have an honest hand.<br>
<br>
It’s one of the things that I’m sort of glad it exists. Just for your 
kids — your kids really don’t know much about your life, you know? We 
had our kids late, I was 40 when our first son was born, and they showed
 a healthy disinterest in our work over all the years. They had their 
own musical heroes, they had their own music they were interested in. 
They’d be pretty blank-faced if someone mentioned a song title of mine, 
and I always looked upon that as that we did a good job. I know that 
none of my kids have read the book, though I imagine someday they will 
perhaps. I kind of like that. My job, it’s a strange job, it’s an 
eccentric line of work. And it’s not comparable to anything else and it 
can be difficult to be around it. As I say in the book, I know a lot of 
kids who wouldn’t mind seeing 50,000 people boo their parents. But I 
don’t know how many would want to see those people cheer their parents. 
It’s just not right (laughs).<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The book explains that you’ve always been a 
musician. You never really had a 9-to-5 job. But “Springsteen on 
Broadway” is five nights a week for five months. It’s steady work.</strong><br>
<br>
That’s a real job. This is my first real job, I think (laughs). That’s 
the one thing I’m going into with a certain sense of faith. I go, well, 
I’m not using myself so totally physically on a nightly basis. And I’m 
not using my voice — you know, you’re not screaming. But the mental 
energy that it takes to do it is the same. People come to see you be 
completely, completely present. Any time you’re trying to do that, it 
takes a lot of energy.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">You say the show and stories are locked in — won’t that become repetitive for you?</strong><br>
<br>
I’ve played “Born to Run,” many, many times. I’m sure if we went on the 
internet we could find out how many. (laughs) But the key is, you have 
to approach it not as a repetition but as a renewal. And to do that your
 spirit has got to be 100 percent present. But it’s a new audience every
 night. There’s new faces, there’s new opportunities. Those songs have 
been very good to me over the years, and in return I try to be good to 
them. So you have a chance of renewing the emotion and the spirit in 
that music on a nightly basis. That’s the place I work to get to every 
night when I’m onstage. I think that if the foundation of what you’ve 
built is built well, you’ll be able to inhabit it on a nightly basis and
 your audience will come in and it will feel like they’re seeing it for 
the first time. (laughs) That’s my plan, anyway.[/quote][/quote]</div>

Bruce Springsteen is a totally new thing for Broadway. Will it change because of him?<br>
By Peter Marks September 28 <br>
The Washington Post<br>
<br>
NEW YORK — What would Walter Kerr think?<br>
<br>
It’s a safe bet that Kerr’s name will mean nothing to many of the Bruce 
Springsteen fans who, starting Tuesday, will be filling the 975 seats of
 the Broadway theater on West 48th Street that honors the late, great 
drama critic for the New York Herald Tribune and the New York Times. And
 that in itself seems only fitting. For the arrival at the Walter Kerr 
Theatre of “Springsteen on Broadway” — an all but sold-out 
five-nights-a-week stand running (at this point) through Feb. 3 — is in 
its way a revolutionary convergence for Broadway, a blending of theater 
and rock-star concertizing of a magnitude unlike anything the Great 
White Way has ever hosted.<br>
<br>
For sure, rock long ago solidified its impact on the music of Broadway, 
all the way back to “Hair” in the 1960s, and then through a variety of 
artists, including the Who (“Tommy”) Elton John (“The Lion King”), Paul 
Simon (“The Capeman”), Cyndi Lauper (“Kinky Boots”), Abba (“Mamma 
Mia!”), Bono and the Edge (“Spider-Man: Turn off the Dark”) and Sting 
(“The Last Ship”). The list goes on and on. And tribute shows such as 
“Beatlemania,” and jukebox musicals such as “Jersey Boys,” many with 
special appeal to nostalgic baby boomers, created hybrid new avenues for
 musical theater — while generating new financial goodies for the 
writers of oldies.<br>
<br>
But “Springsteen on Broadway” represents yet another kind of 
trailblazing crossover. Here is a superstar — a veritable rock-and-roll 
messiah to some of his followers — who’s committing at least the next 
four months to a Broadway residency, a length of stay unheard of for a 
rock singer-songwriter of his fame and reach. In other entertainment 
meccas, such visitations have occurred: Celine Dion made a famous 
long-term commitment to Las Vegas, for instance. Broadway, though, has 
resisted becoming an extended personal-appearance platform for the 
rock-and-role elite, a fact that makes Springsteen’s decision all the 
more intriguing.<br>
<br>
“The theater is a place for artists to come and expand their canvas,” 
says Jordan Roth, president of Jujamcyn Theaters, owner of the Walter 
Kerr and five other Broadway houses. “For an artist like Bruce to say ‘I
 want to be a part of that’ is extraordinary.”<br>
<br>
How extraordinary, exactly, remains to be seen, for whether “Springsteen
 on Broadway” is a bona fide expansion of Springsteen’s performance art —
 or just a much smaller room than usual for him to play — we’ll have to 
wait to learn.<br>
<br>
He’ll be appearing without his longtime friends and collaborators, the E
 Street Band, so the evening is likely to be closer in tone and format 
to the solo shows he’s toured with. Will it, though, conform to the 
etiquette of Broadway, or will Broadway yield up its conventions to the 
Tao of Bruce?<br>
<br>
Will Springsteen devotees, surely a majority of the ticket buyers, be 
allowed to indulge in familiar rituals of stadium concerts that normally
 would be taboo in a Broadway theater — flashing handmade signs, holding
 smartphones aloft and loudly chanting “Bruuuuuuuuuuce”?<br>
<br>
Or will “Springsteen on Broadway” be a comparatively sedate affair, with
 a “song list” rather than a “set list” and a refined, linear story to 
impart? Springsteen has provided some hints of the framework on the 
production’s website: <br>
<br>
“My show is just me, the guitar, the piano and the words and music,” the
 68-year-old songwriter is quoted as saying. “Some of the show is 
spoken, some of it is sung. It loosely follows the arc of my life and my
 work. All of it together is in pursuit of my constant goal to provide 
an entertaining evening and to communicate something of value.”<br>
<br>
Which leads you to wonder: Come June, is it remotely conceivable that 
rugged idol Bruce Springsteen, troubadour of the working man, could rush
 to the podium at Radio City Musical Hall in a tux to accept the Tony 
Award for best musical?<br>
<br>
“He has to tell a story. He has to be committed to it, night after 
night,” observes Steven Strauss, a Columbia-educated journalist who 
writes about theater and music, and who followed recent Springsteen 
concert tours to Australia, Europe and across the United States, and 
wrote extensively about them for Backstreets.com and his own blog. <br>
<br>
Strauss says Springsteen has always lived for the stage: “Absolutely no 
one — and I mean no one — works as hard, enjoys themselves as much or is
 as good at their job as Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band,” 
Strauss wrote during the Australia tour earlier this year. Of this 
newfangled gig, Strauss says: “I think he has a story to tell, the story
 of his life. And he’s an amazing storyteller.” That seems to have been 
confirmed with his 2016 memoir “Born to Run,” from which he’s expected 
to draw narrative material for the new production.<br>
<br>
“Take my hand and move with me down Broadway,” Springsteen sings in “New
 York City Serenade,” a song from his 1973 studio album, “The Wild, the 
Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle.” Where the rocker takes his 
Broadway audience is a matter of sustained fascination in Bruceland: 
another blog devoted to Springsteen, blogitallnight.com, reported what 
it said was the set list from a rehearsal of “Springsteen on Broadway” 
at Monmouth University in New Jersey last month. “Born in the U. S. A,” 
“Born to Run” and “Thunder Road” were all on the list, as well as less 
frequently heard pieces from his vast songbook, such as  “The Wish.”<br>
<br>
“That’s what die-hard fans want to hear,” Strauss says.<br>
<br>
For sure, other entertainers — film star Marlene Dietrich, magician 
David Copperfield — have sought to conquer Broadway with one-person 
shows. In 1981, it was actress and jazz chanteuse Lena Horne who 
created, in “Lena Horne: The Lady and her Music,” a show that in its 
earliest days struggled for its identity but ultimately catapulted Horne
 to another level of celebrity.<br>
<br>
Joshua Ellis, the Broadway press agent who handled the show, which would
 run on Broadway for 333 performances, recalls a rocky, shapeless first 
performance, during which it was clear that Horne had not found a 
powerful rationale for the evening. “At the first preview, she wore a 
wig,” Ellis says, “and I remember her taking it off after and throwing 
it into a trash can.” By the second show, the savvy Horne realized 
several songs had to be cut, and by virtue of her song list, the 
audience had to know they were seeing and hearing something special.<br>
<br>
The song that made it happen, he says, was the second that evening, 
Norman Gimbel and Charles Fox’s “I Got a Name,” originally recorded by 
Jim Croce. “It’s jolting, serious,” Ellis explains. “ It was the number 
that made people understand that they were not going to hear Lena Horne 
just doing song after song. It was a statement of who and what she was.”
 And although Horne had only begun the show, the number got a standing 
ovation.<br>
<br>
If Springsteen is able to bring that kind of drama to his Broadway debut
 — Horne’s show had a director, but none is listed for Springsteen’s — 
it will surely mute the concerns that some theater types might have, 
about a rock star taking up space on a Broadway with already limited 
real estate for new musicals and plays.<br>
<br>
In any event, it’s not hard to imagine other big names seeing what Bruce
 is doing and wanting to bask in Broadway’s glow, too. Perhaps a “Gaga 
on Broadway”? A “Mick Jagger at the Al Hirschfeld”? (And yes, fans of 
the Stones probably don’t know who Hirschfeld was, either.)<br>
 Given the modest size of its theaters — the largest ones are only in 
the 1,700- to 1,900- seat range, and most are much smaller — Broadway 
probably has only a boutique appeal for concert performers with global 
followings and international commitments. What it specializes in, and 
what Springsteen, who lives nearby in New Jersey, seems to have 
responded to, is a business model built on longer tenancies.  <br>
<br>
Clearly, though, Broadway landlords are happy to give entertainers of 
this caliber the keys to a theater. The speed with which tickets were 
gobbled up, at face-value prices of up to $850 each and on the resale 
market for thousands more, suggests that there are bundles to be made.<br>
<br>
Asked whether he’s willing to book other stars into his theaters, Roth 
says, “The short answer is yes. The longer answer is, this is one show, 
and the experience is about a unique kind of storytelling from a unique 
artist. So there’s nothing else that will ever be exactly this.”</div>

Bruce Springsteen on Broadway, His Next Album, and Loving New Jersey<br>
By Jem Aswad @jemaswad<br>
This is part one of Variety’s two-part cover story with Bruce Springsteen. For part two, click here. <br>
<br>
The woodsy rolling hills and vivid green pastures of central New Jersey 
are about as far from the proverbial bright lights of Broadway as one 
can get, both spiritually and psychically. But that’s where Variety is 
headed on a lovely September afternoon for a meeting across the river 
with Bruce Springsteen to discuss his career and his forthcoming 
18-week-long residency at Broadway’s Walter Kerr Theatre, which begins 
Oct. 3. His sprawling, 500-acre farm is just 10 miles — but a world away
 — from the gritty former factory town of Freehold, where he grew up and
 which inhabits so many of his songs.<br>
<br>
We’re greeted by friendly staffers — and, later, by Patti Scialfa, E 
Street Band singer and Springsteen’s wife of some 26 years — and ushered
 into the lounge in his home studio before the man himself arrives. He’s
 clad in a blue flannel shirt, patched jeans with white paint stains on 
them, work shoes and aviator shades, along with his trademark small hoop
 and cross earrings, and beaded necklaces and wristbands. He’s warm and 
friendly, with a firm handshake and a clear, direct gaze, if a bit 
reserved. After all, there’s a stranger in his home (me), and 
Springsteen’s life and career are based on decades-long, familial 
relationships with his band, his management, his label, his staff — even
 his guitar.<br>
<br>
Despite his proclivity for stability, the Boss is no fan of stasis, and 
stylistic left-hand turns are a hallmark of his long career. 
Notwithstanding the familiarity of his songs and his sound, each album 
and tour is strikingly, often drastically, different from what came 
before, and now is no exception. He says of his long-awaited, completed 
solo album, which still has no title or release date: “It’s connected to
 my solo records writing-wise … but it’s not like them at all. Just 
different characters living their lives.” His upcoming Broadway run, a 
solo performance of songs and storytelling in a 960-seat theater, serves
 as an intimate counterpoint to the stadium-filling, four-hour-long 
shows he performed on the 89-date, 13-month-long “The River” anniversary
 tour, which ended earlier this year and, according to Pollstar, grossed
 some $306.5 million globally.<br>
<br>
Variety caught Springsteen at an unusually retrospective point in his 
career. On stage, he’s spent the past couple of years reflecting on a 
roughly 35-year-old album; and in his compelling 2016 autobiography 
“Born to Run,” which will frame the songs and stories during his 
Broadway dates, he’s examined his entire life. And yes, at 68, with some
 65.6 million albums sold in the U.S. alone (according to the Recording 
Industry Assn. of America) over the course of a career that began in the
 early-1970s, and untold millions of concert tickets sold, there’s a lot
 for him to recall.<br>
<br>
Yet his restless nature persists. Just hours after this interview ended,
 he was onstage at Madison Square Garden with Paul McCartney; four days 
later he held the first invitation-only rehearsal for his Broadway set 
at Monmouth University in West Long Branch, N.J., near his beloved 
Asbury Park; six days after that he was performing with Jackson Browne 
and “Little” Steven Van Zandt, his longtime band mate and friend of five
 decades, in nearby Holmdel. “I’m always looking for something new,” he 
says. “A great song is always inspirational — it makes you want to be 
great. So I’m always on the lookout.”<br>
<br>
Your upcoming Broadway show sounds retrospective in nature. Is it based on your autobiography?<br>
<br>
Yeah, there’s a loose connection to the arc of the book, in that it sort
 of starts at the beginning and goes from there. I read a little bit 
from it, I tell some stories and play some music — that’s basically the 
show. Back in the early ’70s, when we played smaller places, there was a
 lot of time for storytelling; people were up close and it was fun, so 
it’s a bit of a return to some of that. We needed a place that was very 
small, so that’s how we ended up on Broadway, where all the beautiful 
small theaters are. I had been thinking about doing something that 
combined the book and music for a while, and I performed it once. In the
 last few weeks of the Obama Administration, I played at the White House
 in the East Room for about 300 people, and I brought this idea down 
there and it felt really good. I haven’t really played a venue of that 
size in probably 40 years.<br>
<br>
<br>
“Bruce took the poetry of Bob Dylan, the soul of Stax records, laid it 
over a rock ’n’ roll beat and inspired a generation and a nation.”<br>
MELISSA ETHERIDGE<br>
Are you playing the same basic set every night? <br>
<br>
It’s pretty scripted in the sense that it will be very close to the same
 every night. I’m sure things will shift a little as I go, but it’s 
pretty set and that’s what makes it a little bit different. It’s not 
just a random collection of songs on a nightly basis.<br>
<br>
Are you playing any Castiles songs? [Springsteen’s first real band] <br>
<br>
No, I don’t think there’s any Castiles songs in it yet!<br>
<br>
Are you pleased with the way ticket sales worked with Ticketmaster’s 
Verified Plan program, which is intended to weed out scalpers?<br>
<br>
Yeah, I thought it worked out pretty well. According to the information 
I’ve gotten, we were relatively successful at keeping the tickets out of
 the secondary market, where the prices skyrocket. It’s always difficult
 to curtail scalping, but I thought we did a pretty good job.<br>
<br>
You do a lot of multi-night stands at arenas; how do you feel about playing the same venue every night for four months?<br>
<br>
Yeah, it’s new — I don’t know what it’s gonna feel like. But once we 
decided to do something that small, we knew we were going to have to 
take a different approach. The Walter Kerr [Theatre] kinda feels like 
you’re inviting people into your living room, and it’s gonna allow for a
 different type of communication with the audience. Whether there’ll be 
more [shows added after the initial 16-week run] I’m not sure, we’ll 
have to see how I feel. I haven’t worked five nights a week 
consecutively in a long time. I have a show that’s not physically 
rigorous but it takes a lot of mental energy, as any time you’re trying 
to be really, really present does.<br>
<br>
Do you have a sort of psychological workout regimen to prepare for this kind of show? <br>
<br>
That just comes from your desire to be there and to take the opportunity
 to have this very intense communication with the people who are there, 
with the idea that you can bring something of quality for the evening 
but also something that will stay with them. You’ve gotta have respect 
for your own ability and for the audience’s investment in you, and it’s 
always driven me to be very present when I walk out on a stage on any 
given night. I can’t imagine coming out on any stage and not giving 
everything I have.<br>
<br>
“Bruce was the first person  I ever met who believed in what he was 
doing to such an extent. He wouldn’t compromise the vision:  You 
couldn’t rent him, you couldn’t buy him. He’s been that person since the
 day I met him.”<br>
JIMMY IOVINE<br>
What drives you to do or not do something creatively at a certain time? 
For instance, Neil Young talks about his muse like it’s a dictator — 
“She is my boss.” What’s that voice for you?<br>
<br>
Well, you do follow your inspirations; there’s times you write and times
 you don’t write. And after a long work life you’re OK with the ebb and 
flow of your creativity. The thing that drives me most is what I can do 
that would be of most value to my audience, and I think I put together 
something unique when I played this show [at the White House]. That’s 
what I’m always looking for — to do something that’s essential for my 
audience. We’ve made many more records than we released. Why didn’t we 
release those records? I didn’t think they were essential. I might have 
thought they were good, I might have had fun making them, and we’ve 
released plenty of that music [on archival collections over the years]. 
But over my entire work life, I felt like I released what was essential 
at a certain moment, and what I got in return was a very sharp 
definition of who I was, what I want to do, what I was singing about. 
And I still basically judge what I’m doing by the same set of rules.<br>
<br>
Do you still plan to release the solo album you’ve been talking about since before “The River” anniversary tour? <br>
<br>
Oh yeah, I’ve just been caught up in other projects. It’s kind of waiting for its moment. Good music doesn’t go away!<br>
<br>
Someone who’d heard it said it sounded like Aaron Copland. <br>
<br>
I don’t know if anybody made that particular connection. Really, that 
record is influenced by Southern California pop music of the ’70s.<br>
<br>
Like the Eagles and Fleetwood Mac?<br>
<br>
No — Glen Campbell, Jimmy Webb, Burt Bacharach, those kinds of records. I
 don’t know if people will hear those influences, but that was what I 
had in my mind. It gave me something to hook an album around; it gave me
 some inspiration to write. And also, it’s a singer-songwriter record. 
It’s connected to my solo records writing-wise, more “Tunnel of Love” 
and “Devils and Dust,” but it’s not like them at all. Just different 
characters living their lives.<br>
<br>
What kinds of songs have you been writing lately?<br>
<br>
I haven’t been writing lately. I think you have to process through your 
projects. In other words, if I have some songs that I haven’t released, 
once they’re released, then the machine starts turning for, ‘OK, now I’m
 gonna write for the band’ or whatever I decide to come up with. But 
unless something comes along — “Oh, I’ve gotta write this,” which hasn’t
 happened lately — I have to feel what I’ve just done is realized before
 <em class="text-italics">.<br>
<br>
Was this solo album your most recent burst of writing? <br>
<br>
Yeah, I would say so, which is unusual because I wrote most of that 
before [2012’s] “Wrecking Ball,” and I stopped making that record to 
make “Wrecking Ball,” and then I went back to it. So it’s been awhile 
since I’ve written, but that’s not unusual. That’s occurred plenty of 
other times in my working life.<br>
<br>
For many people, living 10 minutes from the place they grew up would be punishment. What do you love so much about this area?<br>
<br>
Well, I like living 10 minutes from Freehold, 20 from Asbury Park. The 
main thing that grounded us here is we had a huge family, like an 
80-member-or-more Italian-Irish family, and when we had our kids, we 
brought them back here because we wanted them to grow up around family. 
We were lucky enough to have them all in one area at a certain moment — 
that’s unusual these days — and they all basically grew up here around 
their aunts and cousins and grandmoms: how I grew up. And, I just still 
like it here. I think Jersey Shore is a great place to live, we have 
this beautiful farm and yet we’re only 25 minutes from the ocean … and 
I’m still a beach bum so I’ll swim until November. It’s just still a 
place that we love, man.<br>
<br>
I’ve heard the community is very protective of your privacy. <br>
<br>
Yeah, I have a very free existence down here. I go where I wanna go, I 
do what I wanna do, I live a really relatively normal life. There’s the 
rare occasion where some fuss might be made, but that’s one of the 
reasons we came back here with the children — it’s where they would be 
able to have the most normal childhood, and they did. I always wanted to
 stay out of the bright lights of the city; I was uncomfortable with 
that. I wanted to be someplace where you were a little hidden, where 
your privacy was respected and maintained, and I’ve had that down here 
for all these years, so I appreciate it. The locals have always been 
good to me.<br>
<br>
Does the small-town Jersey you grew up in still exist?<br>
<br>
Yeah! It still exists in my town [Freehold]. It’s very different than it
 was when I lived there in the ’50s, but if you drive through Jersey 
it’s all still out there. I take my motorcycle on the back roads and 
there’s a million little towns where I have a feeling kids are, despite 
all the modern tech and the internet, having a similar emotional 
experience. You’re a creature of your environment and there’s something 
that’s … inimitable, I suppose, about a certain place and time. In other
 words, when I’m gone and the E Street Band is gone, that thing is gonna
 be gone. There’ll be other things and other people doing fabulous 
things, but that particular thing won’t be there. But at the same time, 
somebody will be writing about it down the road.<br>
<br>
You’ve done so much to spur the area’s revival. But now Asbury Park even has a designer hotel!<br>
<br>
Yeah! It’s nice!<br>
<br>
Has it gotten to the point where it feels too gentrified or invasive?<br>
<br>
I think they’ve done a pretty good job with Asbury’s development. I 
never thought I’d live to see the day when it came back to life in such a
 vibrant and strong fashion. Also, it’s maintained its art base. It 
could easily have become a mini-mall or a wall of condos but it didn’t, 
and there’s still a place there; it’s still unique in its own right. 
That didn’t get erased, and that’s what really matters. It’s not gonna 
be the place that I grew up in — a little blue-collar resort, or the 
place that was the genesis of our band — but it’s a lovely, vibrant 
community right now, and I love going there in the summer now and seeing
 that beach jammed. I never thought I’d see it again.<br>
<br>
When talking about your sister in the book, you make a reference to “Jersey Soul.” What is that?<br>
<br>
It’s just a sort of hard-working, never-say-die, never-give-up, 
salt-of-the-earth essence that I find in my favorite Jersey people and 
in our family. My mother and her two sisters, no matter what happened, 
were always able to find joy in life. They had plenty of tragedy in 
their own right, but they always came back, they always found something 
to be joyful about. And that’s one of the things our band has done well 
over the years. There’s a lot of bands that are good at playing hard or 
playing cool, but there aren’t a lot of bands that do joy very much. And
 one of the things the E Street Band aspired to was a certain joyful 
feeling that I particularly got from the Italian side of my family, 
which I was always able to communicate to a big crowd.<br>
<br>
If you ran for governor of New Jersey, you’d win — is that ever a temptation?<br>
<br>
Pssht, nooo. I would have no business in politics. I’m just not 
interested in policy-making enough. I know people in entertainment who 
are interested in those things, but I’m a musician.<br>
<br>
Many people wondered why you didn’t come out in support of Hillary Clinton’s campaign earlier. Was there a reason for that? <br>
<br>
Um… I don’t think I’m necessarily that essential a factor. And I still 
tend to be a little bit ambivalent about getting involved directly like 
that in political campaigns. I’ve done it when I felt it was really 
necessary and that maybe my two cents might make some small bit of 
difference. But the more you do it, your two cents becomes one cent and 
then no cents whatsoever, so I think your credibility and your impact 
lessens the more you do it. So I’ve been hesitant to overplay my hand in
 that area, and I generally come to service when I feel it’s kind of 
necessary and it might help a little bit.<br>
<br>
I guess that was the case when you played at a rally for 32,000 people in Philadelphia on election eve?<br>
<br>
Yeah. I thought she would have made an excellent president, and I still feel that way, so I was glad to do it.<br>
<br>
Midway through “The River” anniversary tour you stopped playing the 
nearly 90-minute album in its entirety. Were you tired of it?<br>
<br>
No, it was actually very enjoyable on a nightly basis because that 
record was well built, well put-together, so it gave a formal but very 
satisfying experience. I’m hoping to have something similar occur with 
[the Broadway shows]. But the reason we stopped is because we were going
 to play outside [stadiums] and, particularly, we were going to Europe, 
where I just didn’t know if it was going to ring and play as well. The 
few times we did it in Europe it played very well, but I wanted to have 
the freedom once we went outside to these bigger shows to just play 
whatever I wanted.<br>
<br>
And sometimes that meant playing your first two albums, “Greetings From 
Asbury Park” and “The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle,” 
almost in their entirety, which you did later in the tour?<br>
<br>
Yeah, when we’re in that mode, [the show] varies on a nightly basis, and
 I think we got in a place toward the end of that tour where we were 
playing a little bit chronologically. I think the whole first hour or 
more of the show was the first and second records, which was a lot of 
fun because I hadn’t done that in quite awhile. It was the band before 
it was a hard-rock band, which we didn’t really become until “Born to 
Run.” Previous to that we were a rock and soul band, a swingin’ little 
club band; the music had a lighter touch to it. Once we fired on all 
eight with “Born to Run,” that’s when the rock started.<br>
<br>
You’ve done so much looking back recently, between the book and “The 
River” anniversary tour and now this Broadway run. Any thoughts on 
what’s next?<br>
<br>
I suppose the [solo] record that I haven’t released. It’s not topical at
 all — topical writing at the moment doesn’t hold a lot of interest to 
me. I really got out a lot of what I had to say in that vein on 
“Wrecking Ball.” I’m not driven to write any anti-Trump diatribe; that 
doesn’t feel necessary at the moment.<br>
<br>
Why, because so many people already are?<br>
<br>
Yeah, because it’s everywhere and all over, ya know? It feels a little 
redundant to me at the moment. And, once again, I always try to look at 
what I can deliver that’s personal to me and of most value. The audience
 has a wide variety of needs; whatever you’re writing, you’re trying to 
meet your own need, and as I’ve said in other interviews, Marty Scorsese
 once said, “The job of the artist is to make the audience care about 
your obsessions.” So I hope I write about the things that obsess me well
 enough for my audience to care about them.<br>
<br>
“I’ve never known him to not have the outline of some idea in mind. It’s part of his DNA.”<br>
JON LANDAU, MANAGER<br>
<br>
But don’t you think your opinions about Trump would matter to your audience? <br>
<br>
Well, if you read Charles Blow in The New York Times, he carries the 
flag pretty well. I’m ambivalent about … sort of getting on a soapbox. I
 still believe people fundamentally come to music to be entertained — 
yes, to address their daily concerns, and yes, also to address political
 topics, I believe music can do that well. But I still believe 
fundamentally it’s an affair of the heart. People want you to go deeper 
than politics, they want you to reach inside to their most personal 
selves and their deepest struggles with their daily lives and reach that
 place; that’s the place I’m always trying to reach. I’d never make a 
record that’s just polemical, I wouldn’t release it if I did. To me, 
that’s just an abuse of your audience’s good graces. But if I’m moved, 
I’ll write, say, something like “American Skin” [inspired by the 1999 
shooting death of Amadou Diallo by New York City Police officers — who 
were later acquitted]. That just rolled very naturally for me, and 
that’s as good a topical song as I’ve ever written. And when it comes 
up, I write ’em. If I felt that strongly, I’d do it now. But I watch 
myself, because I think you can weigh upon your audience’s indulgence in
 the wrong way.<br>
<br>
What do you mean? <br>
<br>
I never wanted to be just a proselytizer for an ideological point of 
view. That’s not my job; that’s somebody else’s job. And if you even 
look back to Woody Guthrie’s material, he didn’t do that. He wrote these
 very full character pieces that, whether you were there in the 
Depression or not, they live today. They weren’t hollow, they weren’t 
one-dimensional; they were these very full character pieces about the 
times. I still aspire to that, really, and if it has political 
implications that’s fine and if it doesn’t that’s fine too.<br>
<br>
His songs are about those times but aren’t bound to them. <br>
<br>
Yeah, that’s what I mean. That’s the target; those are the kinds of 
works that you aspire to. It’s like if “The Rising” was only about 9/11,
 it would have been hollow. But you can listen to it today and it’s a 
record that has a spiritual resonance that, whether it was connected to 
that event or not, it retains its life and its poetry. If you delve deep
 enough into yourself —and that doesn’t mean it’s autobiographical, it 
means if you’re reaching deep enough into your own humanity — it becomes
 universal. And that’s a guiding light that I use when I write.<br>
<br>
“Born to Run” had an impressionism to the storytelling that you never 
really went back to; your writing became much more direct. Have you ever
 wanted to bring back that style?<br>
<br>
“I like the storylines in his songs and his genuine delivery of them. 
And as a performer, he goes on forever — and the audience loves it.”<br>
PAUL MCCARTNEY<br>
<br>
I don’t think you can really recapture what you did in your youth. It’s 
tricky; if you try, it can feel like a cardboard copy of something you 
[formerly] did naturally. So I don’t think I’ll make a record quite like
 that ever again, where there’s a blizzard of words coming at you — I 
was havin’ fun throwin’ all those words around, and I imagined myself 
quite the poet at the moment. But later on I was interested in a more 
colloquial way of speaking through the songs, and a more direct 
approach. Also, at the time there were the comparisons to Dylan, so I 
moved away from that style — although now I go back and realize, gee, it
 really wasn’t like Dylan much at all. We could have taken that a little
 further, but I was interested in creating my own identity at the time.<br>
<br>
In the book you say that after you’d finished touring behind “The River”
 in 1981, you’d earned enough money that you’d essentially “made it.” 
Then you made “Nebraska,” your darkest album. Why?<br>
<br>
I dunno… you have to look back later at some of the psychological 
elements that led you to tap a particular creative vein at a certain 
moment. Looking back, I was very interested in this sort of American 
gothic form of writing. Flannery O’Connor was very influential, the 
[1973] Terrence Malick film “Badlands,” the [1981] movie “True 
Confessions” with Robert De Niro and Robert Duvall that didn’t get much 
attention but I really loved. And then the noir writers I’ve mentioned 
many times in the past, James M. Cain and Jim Thompson. I wanted to 
write something that felt like these films and stories, and that also 
connects to the youngest memories I have of my life, between, say, when I
 was born and 13 or 14, in a little town surrounded by relatives that 
were very old-world Irish and first- or second-generation Italian. I 
always thought “Nebraska” felt like my childhood at that time, and what 
it felt like around here in the mid-’50s. Then I had my own 
psychological issues, I suppose, that led me to that place, some 
unresolved things I was struggling with. The music was all very lonely. I
 suppose that was me at that moment.<br>
<br>
What have you been reading lately?<br>
<br>
I just read a bunch of true-crime things…  The last thing I read that 
jumped out like “man you gotta read this” was “Moby Dick,” which I’d 
never read, and which ended up not being as intimidating as people claim
 — it was actually a boys’ adventure story that was particularly well 
told. And then I read a lot of Russian writers — I really enjoyed 
[Dostoyevsky’s] “Brothers Karamazov” … I went on a big Elmore Leonard 
stretch, which was fantastic, particularly the “Western Stories” … a 
couple of books on Isis. I’ve been wandering a bit with my reading.<br>
<br>
How about TV?<br>
<br>
Like everybody else, I was nuts about “Mad Men.” I watched “Breaking Bad.” I thought “Westworld” was incredibly realized.<br>
<br>
Is it difficult being married to someone you work with? <br>
<br>
Actually, no. We’ve kind of developed natural boundaries. Some places we
 have a more professional approach, like if I walk into the studio while
 she’s working, I have certain boundaries where if she requests my 
opinion or asks for my help, I give it on a very professional level. 
When she comes onstage with the E Street Band she’s an E Street band 
member, and when we walk offstage we’re husband and wife.<br>
<br>
What are your favorite songs to sing with her?<br>
<br>
I like “Brilliant Disguise,” “Tougher Than the Rest.” Those are songs 
we’ve sung together for a lotta years, and they encapsulate our 
relationship in a very universal but personal way. We sing “Fall Behind”
 together, “Mansion on the Hill” — Patti can have a really gothic voice 
when she wants to. She’s a very distinctive, underrated singer and 
songwriter. She’s made some excellent records that I think, because of 
her connection to me, have gone a little under-noticed and underrated. 
She’s got a great record she’s making now.<br>
<br>
Was she in your life when you wrote “Tougher Than the Rest”? When you 
sing it together it almost feels like it was written for her. <br>
<br>
Um… maybe it was! I might not have known it. It’s one of those songs that really feels like it’s hers and mine now.<br>
<br>
Most of your major relationships have lasted for decades: wife, band, 
management, label, even your main guitar. Are you seeking a family vibe 
in all areas of your life?<br>
<br>
I like consistency. I don’t like change. I change reluctantly, 
particularly with the people around me. And then when you find the right
 people, you hold onto them. There’s been some attrition over the years 
and sometimes I chose well and sometimes I didn’t, but the times I chose
 well I really stuck with. My relationship with Jon [Landau, 
Springsteen’s manager since the mid-1970s] is one in a million and one 
of the most important relationships in my life, and it’s maintained its 
creative edge since the day we got together. I still feel an excitement 
when we get on the phone together — like something could happen! We 
might learn something together that we haven’t known the other 10,000 
times we’ve talked. That possibility is always there, similar to my 
experience with Patti — when we get together on any given day, I might 
learn something.</em></div>
