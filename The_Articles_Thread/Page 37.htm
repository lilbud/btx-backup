THE NEW YORK TIMES REVIEW<br>
NOVEMBER 28, 1980<br>
<br>
BY JOHN ROCKWELL</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Almost any Bruce Springsteen concert is triumphant, in the sense that 
his music celebrates ecstatic release more than any other rock musician 
alive and his performances are so consistently affirmative that 
audiences become part of that ecstasy.  But his Madison Square Garden 
appearance Thanksgiving night was special. It was the first of four 
there, all long since sold out and it came at a time when , for the 
first time, an album of his, “The River” had reached No. 1 on the sales 
charts.<br>
<br>
While Springsteen aficionados could recall other shows, especially years
 back in the clubs that were just as exciting as Thursday’s 245 minute 
performance (including a 35 minute intermission) marked a new maturity. 
With no loss of energy, Mr Springsteen has intergrated his theatrics and
 lighting into the music better than ever before, and in his new songs, 
has purged some of his more lurid textual excesses. He was also singing 
better than ever and the E Street Band playing at a new level of 
excellence. <br>
<br>
The set concentrated on the last three albums. The first part began with
 “Born To Run” and ended with “Thunder Road” and included a moving 
trilogy of “Darkness on the Edge of Town”, “Factory” and “Independence 
Day”.  Part 2 led off with “Cadillac Ranch” as the first of five upbeat 
singles-orientated songs including “Hungry Heart”, “Fire” and “Because 
The Night” and proceeded through a mostly slow group (here was the only 
place where pacing might be reconsidered) to the wonderful “Backstreets”
 and then “Rosalita”. The encores were “I’m A Rocker”, “Jungleland” and 
Mr Springsteen’s Mitch Ryder medley.<br>
<br>
There are many things that make Mr Springsteen the finest performer in 
rock music. Perhaps above all is the positive nature of what he conveys 
to his fans. Mr Springsteen is no Paul McCartney, all sunnily 
simplistic. But he is a far finer role model for teenagers than the 
petulant, bored and nasty rock stars who customarily fill the Garden. Mr
 Springsteen’s themes may arise from the despair of working class lives.
 Yet his ultimate message is affirmative, a vision of the promised land 
right there just beyond his grasp. And the way he proposes to reach that
 land is through the joyous energy of rock-and-roll.<br>
<br>
Rock started out as a slightly naughty kind of dance music but it soon 
became a catalyst for the transformation of Amercian popular culture. As
 soon as people realized its power, they began to elevate it into an 
art. Yet too much “art-rock” is either pretentious or not really rock at
 all, whatever its other virtues may be. Mr Springsteen has not entirely
 escaped charges of pretension and self consciousness. But the 
toughening of his lyrics is a sign that he is balancing himself ever 
more securely between that of innocent rock and its usage as art.<br>
<br>
That useage is at one with a range of contemporary films (Martin 
Scorsese) of visual arts (Duane Hanson) than the lives of working people
 in this country as a fit subject for artistic expression. Mr 
Springsteen does that –and does it in an idiom –rock music-that is by 
now inextricably a part of people’s lives. The extent of this serves to 
validate the very notion of popular art, in the face of the trash 
continually proppgated in its name.<br>
<br>
Years ago, Jon Landau spoke passionately if ungrammatically of Mr 
Springsteen as “rock and roll’s future” and subsequently would realize 
his vision by becoming Mr Springsteen’s manager and producer. While some
 may assume that Thursday’s triumph constituted the fulfillment of that 
goal , others have seen Mr Springsteen as a figure from the past; at 
worst,  maker of rock pastiche or at best, the last of a long but dying 
breed of rock avatars.<br>
<br>
But it is still possible to hope that Mr Springsteen represents  a 
future not just of  rock, but of the wider reach of American culture. He
 has now reached No 1, but his work is still widely regarded as kids’ 
stuff by people who might happily go and see “Raging Bull” or read Mr 
Terkel’s “American Dreams”. Seeing Mr Springsteen’s effect on Thursday’s
 audience, it is hard not to believe that he will soon make the next 
jump, staying true to rock’s spirit but bringing its message out beyond 
it’s current area of class, age and race and help inspire the country as
 a revelation of the beauty that music can provide.</div>

ROCK:BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN IN CONCERT<br>
By JOHN ROCKWELL<br>
the New York Times<br>
Published: August 7, 1984</strong><br>
<br>
WITH all the excitement swirling about the Jacksons, let us not forget 
Bruce Springsteen. He did have a No. 1 album this summer, after all, 
with ''Born in the U.S.A.'' And he is playing to more ticket- buyers in 
the New York area than the Jacksons or anyone else has ever done in a 
single engagement - 202,000 of them, to be exact, in 10 long- 
since-sold-out concerts in the Brendan Byrne Arena in the Meadowlands of
 his native New Jersey. The first of those concerts was Sunday night, 
and they continue in pairs, with rest days in between, through Aug. 20.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen and his E Street Band will need the rest. Without an 
opening act, they offer a prodigious four-hour performance, an almost 
unstinting (there is one intermission) outpouring of music, dancing 
energy and heartwarming communal feeling. Mr. Springsteen is, not to put
 too fine a point on it, the best rock-and- roll performer this writer 
has ever seen. At one point Sunday, Mr. Springsteen pulled a teen-age 
girl on stage with him. Through binoculars, one could read her lips: ''I
 love you so much,'' she said, and in that she spoke for the entire 
audience.<br>
<br>
To say Mr. Springsteen is the best rock performer ever is not to say he 
is the best composer, the best singer, the best guitarist or the best 
top-10 singles artist. He has his limitations - of musical invention, of
 audience (there was hardly a black face to be seen Sunday), of social 
impact in a time that distrusts the redemptive power of popular art.<br>
<br>
But for his very perseverance, his proud assertion of the values that 
have made rock music so beloved, Mr. Springsteen deserves our 
admiration. But if that were all there was to it, he would have to rest 
content as a wax dummy in a rock-and-roll museum. What makes him so 
appealing is how he carries on, alive and literally kicking, 
entertaining and instructing us in a way that we can't tell the 
difference between the two.<br>
<br>
The entertainment part is obvious: not just in his ebullient uptempo 
songs, but in his set as a whole Mr. Springsteen gives his people what 
they want. And yet he's made them want more, and better, than they 
usually do today. Unlike so much of the best rock, which evoked a 
rebellious negativism, and so much latter-day rock, which panders to 
what the Soviets call ''hooliganism,'' Mr. Springsteen's projects an 
almost unfailing positive vision. It is a remarkable feat: passion 
without enduring pain; positivism without sacrifice of power.<br>
<br>
The instruction also comes because Mr. Springsteen is such a deep and 
all-encompassing encyclopedia of rock idioms. His historicism can be 
heard most clearly in his encores, when he sings the songs of others - 
Sunday, Tom Waits's ''Jersey Girl,'' his Mitch Ryder medley and ''Twist 
and Shout,'' based on the Beatles' version. But such a love for the past
 suffuses his own composition, as well. Mr. Springsteen's detractors 
complain about his lack of musical invention, but the charge seems 
misplaced. He works within a set of idioms; together they constitute a 
tradition. But he uses those idioms as if it never once occurred to him 
that they might be stale, and in his hands they aren't.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, he was in fine voice Sunday, and the E Street Band (despite
 a sound system that seemed a little overblown and muddy from this 
writer's seat) was in solid form, with Nils Lofgren filling in adeptly 
for the departed Steve Van Zandt. There is also a new backup singer, 
Patti Scialfa, but she had little to do.<br>
<br>
For all his traditionalism, however, there is also a discernible 
evolution in Mr. Springtseen's work. He hardly does anything now from 
his period of the early 1970's, apart from ''Growin' Up'' and 
''Rosalita.'' The self-conscious myth-making and inflated verbosity live
 on in some of his best-loved songs of the mid-70's, however. Those 
songs perhaps overdominated the set selection Sunday, bumping out some 
of his more sombre recent work. But the crowd - his crowd - loved it. To
 hear 20,000 people singing whole songs a cappella, loud and clear, was 
extraordinary.<br>
<br>
Since the mid-70's, Mr. Springsteen has moved into an austere phase, 
telling grim heartfelt stories about people struggling to survive in a 
society indifferent to them. What was interesting about Sunday's show, 
in part, was how all this work sounded of a piece. The acoustic songs on
 his ''Nebraska'' album were fleshed out (sometimes too sweetly, as with
 the overuse of a noxious chime effect from one of the electronic 
keyboards); the synthesized dance-rock textures of ''Born in the 
U.S.A.'' were revealed as superficial overlays of his standard rock 
arrangements.<br>
<br>
For sheer excitement, this writer still prizes Mr. Springsteen's club 
shows of the mid-70's: arenas inevitably rob music of some of its 
impact. But their large scale also becomes a fitting setting for an 
artist of such genuinely popular aspirations.<br>
<br>
This is not ''pop''; not commercial calculation. What makes Mr. 
Springsteen such a satisfying harbinger of the ''rock-and-roll future'' 
is not his anticipation of today's trends - they have grown almost 
foreign to him - but his role as a musician working lovingly within the 
rock tradition to make serious adult art. That's worth cheering about, 
just as much as the spellbinding fervor of his actual performances.</div>

Bruuuuuce:<br>
The Louisville Review <br>
By Raj Ranade<br>
November 4 2012<br>
<br>
I never realized the key side-effect of “Bruuuce”-ing until I saw it in 
person at the KFC Yum Center in Louisville last night. “Bruuuce”-ing, 
for the uninitiated, is when Springsteen fans just yell “Bruuuce” 
instead of applauding, which, en masse, kind of sounds like booing. 
Audience dissent becomes way harder, since the boos are masked by the 
enraptured “Bruuuces,” as one drunken concert-goer in my row found out. 
Apparently irritated when Springsteen used the word “democratic” (though
 Springsteen wasn’t referring to the political party – the liberal 
rocker pointedly avoided any explicit political references in the show),
 the guy tried booing to no avail, lost amid the “Bruuuces.” (He tried 
“Vote Mitt Romney” after that, but that just doesn’t have the concise 
oomph or crowd-spread potential of a good “boo.”)<br>
<br>
This isn’t to say that Springsteen deserves booing – far from it. Even 
at the age of 62, Springsteen is as energetic, hard-working, and 
flat-out spectacular a performer as any I’ve ever seen. It’s just 
emblematic of the kind of sway he manages to create over his crowds.<br>
<br>
Sometimes he achieves this by being a gladhanding ham – early on in the 
set, Springsteen hopped off the stage to stroll along the perimeter of 
the stadium floor, stopping to invent an impromptu secret handshake with
 a young boy and to pose wearing the hat of a young girl. (He had a lot 
of these moments with youngsters in the crowd – if he avoided politics 
during the show, he still had a politician’s eye for photo ops.) 
Sometimes he does it through carefully staged self-deprecation – after 
declaring himself the head of “a glorified Jersey bar band,” Springsteen
 mimed decrepitude, crawling like a wizened old man to the lip of the 
stage until he was inches from a female fan’s face – at which point he 
immediately dropped the act and began flirting. And sometimes he does it
 through deeply earnest solemnity – he channeled a gospel preacher as he
 lamented Hurricane Sandy’s effect on his native New Jersey, building up
 to a moment of silence where he asked the crowd to pay tribute to the 
ghosts living around us.<br>
<br>
Springsteen switched between these different personas with 
whiplash-inducing speed on Saturday night, creating an almost 
Broadway-style framework for his songs about desperate, sometimes-doomed
 rock-and-roll dreamers. And he tore into the performances of the songs 
themselves with equal zest – with Springsteen, any guitar note that can 
be played with a full-on windmill arm swing will be, and elaborate 
synchronized dance moves with his bandmates are the rule rather than the
 exception.<br>
<br>
Accompanying him, the E Street Band was as sharp as ever, despite the 
passing of Clarence Clemons last year. Clemons has been replaced by a 
horn section of five people on this tour, with his nephew Jake Clemons 
capably handling most of his solos.<br>
<br>
Guitarist Nils Lofgren ripped through a guitar solo on “Because the 
Night” while pirouetting on one leg for a long chunk of it. And the band
 put together some striking new arrangements of old songs – the acoustic
 ballad “Atlantic City” (this critic’s favorite Springsteen song) was 
turned into a full band rave-up, a quiet lament turned into powerful 
raging against the inevitable.<br>
<br>
It’s been almost exactly a decade since Springsteen has played a show in
 Kentucky (the last was at Rupp Arena on November 14th, 2002) and he 
seemed happy to be back – in part because the doting father revealed 
that his daughter, show-jumper Jessica Springsteen, is competing in the 
Alltech Games in Lexington this weekend (starseekers may want to keep an
 eye out for The Boss at the arena). And Springsteen found a nicely 
subtle way to cater to the hometown crowd when he mentioned that while 
he might be getting older, he could still “float like a butterfly and 
sting like a bee” – that was all that the locals from Muhammad Ali’s 
hometown needed to start cheering (or “bruuuce”-ing, of course).<br>
<br>
The rocker was giddy enough during the performance of “Tenth Avenue 
Freeze-Out” that he inexplicably started doing the “Gangnam Style” dance
 for a few brief moments. It was maybe one of the more ill-advised 
moments of the evening, but it nevertheless revealed the critical thing 
about Springsteen – he’s a guy who will go to some pretty impressive 
lengths to make sure the audience gets their money’s worth.<br>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong"> BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN IN IRELAND<br>
THE IRISH TIMES<br>
Jul 30, 2013</strong><br>
<br>
Now that Bruce Springsteen is back home in New Jersey, having dropped 
into his local bank once he got off the plane to lodge a couple of 
million euros from his five night stand in Ireland and the rest of the 
takings from his European tour, the question turns to who, if anyone, 
can emulate what he’s just done. Springsteen may have played 28 Irish 
shows since 1985, but it’s the five shows this month which many agents 
and acts will be looking at closely.<br>
<br>
At a time when ticket sales for everything from festivals (this is 
likely to be Oxegen’s annus horribilis sales-wise judging by the word 
out of Punchestown) to standalone shows by superstars of every stripe 
(there are still tickets on sale for Blur’s gig at Dublin’s IMMA this 
week, their only Irish and UK show this year, going on the ads), 
Springsteen’s success in shifting 140,000 tickets is quite a feat. That 
he did so by doing an Irish tour is even more remarkable.<br>
<br>
Of course, there are caveats to this success story. For a start, his 28 
appearances here (which include two guest spots with Joe Ely, if memory 
serves me right) have helped to build the Springsteen brand in Ireland. 
From that seminal appearance in Slane in 1985, one of those occasions 
when that hilly field really had the look and feel of an event venue to 
it, to the post-”Rising” gigs when the fanbase and gig count seemed to 
rise with every passing year, the growth in Springsteen’s Irish appeal 
has been quite startling to watch. There are few other acts who’ve been 
able to come back almost year after year (he played here every year from
 2005 to 2009 in three different guises – solo, with the Seeger Sessions
 Band and the E Street Band) and still maintain demand.<br>
<br>
But the real masterstroke in 2013 was to leave Dublin. A Springsteen 
summer show in the RDS has become a bit of a ritual so moving the circus
 to Limerick, Cork, Belfast and Kilkenny freshened up the tour itenary 
for the dedicated fanbase, those who were curious about why so many 
people were so evangelical about the E Street Band live and the event 
gig junkies. Cue five sold-out shows and a huge new narrative about 
Springsteen in Ireland. Certainly, there wasn’t this much fuss about a 
Springsteen Irish show since that Slane gig in 1985 as all media outlets
 jumped in to cover the story, leading to more fuss and attention and 
lots of angst for those who can’t stand him or his fans.<br>
<br>
Can someone else really copy what he’s just done? Could Bob Jovi, for 
example, have played five shows around the country instead of not quite 
filling Slane? Are Neil Young and Bob Dylan still enough of a draw to do
 the business like that or have they totally lost everyone beyond the 
core audience? Are U2 really the only other act out there who could do 
five stadium shows without breaking sweat? Maybe AC/DC? And, of the new 
guns, could Kings Of Leon do the business?<br>
<br>
But there are several reasons why we don’t see acts of Springsteen’s ilk
 in places like Kilkenny and Limerick. Tour itenaries are tightly 
controlled beasts and agents rarely see a possibility for more than one 
or maybe two shows in Ireland. That means playing the biggest venue 
possible to maximise the take, which is why the acts tend to play 
somewhere in Dublin or Belfast (or a big field near those centres) and 
get out again right away.<br>
<br>
There are also very few acts who will feel they have the pull to do what
 Springsteen has done and most promoters have become very risk-adverse 
when it comes to this kind of thing. As we saw with the underwhelming 
turnout for Dylan in Limerick in 2010 and the Eagles’ failed attempt to 
play Galway in 2009, there’s a reason why promoters are happy when acts 
stick with the bigger urban centres.<br>
<br>
Whatever about any local pent-up demand for more of these shows – there 
has been much talk in Limerick over the last few weeks about getting an 
act like Springsteen back to Thomond Park (a brilliant stadium for a gig
 like this) – the act has to be right to make the show work in the first
 place and to fill the venue. And such acts are few and far between.<br>
<br>
Then, there’s the very nature of those stadium shows. A band like U2 may
 well be able to pull the crowds – it’s a long time since they played 
anywhere in Ireland bar the capital so you could imagine the palaver 
around such shows – but their recent tours have been massive production 
jobs, with elaborate specs and a lot going on above and below the stages
 which often rules out a tight venue like Nowlan Park. Remember too that
 even Springsteen’s Irish tour probably required three different stage 
builds, which is another additional cost to be taken into account and 
another reason for hefty ticket prices. A band like U2 could easily do 
the business were they to strip the show down and do a greatest hits 
tour. They’d net way more from a provincal run than they would from a 
night at Croker.<br>
<br>
So you can probably expect more acts, especially heritage acts, to head 
to the country in the next few summers, especially if the promoter and 
agent think it’s possible to pull 20,000 or more people and make it all 
add up. There might even be attempts to string a few shows into a tour. 
But chances are we won’t be seeing a tour of Springsteen’s ilk, an Irish
 tour where 140,000 tickets are snapped up in a few hours, for quite 
some time simply because that was truly a once off thing from a 
once-in-a-lifetime act.</div>

By Joe Heim<br>
 The Washington Post <br>
Monday, May 16, 2005</strong><br>
<br>
Turn off those damn cell phones. That was the first item of business for
 Bruce Springsteen before playing a single note at a sold-out Patriot 
Center Saturday night. "If I hear one of those idiotic jingles, I'll 
sweep the audience with my chain saw," he said with a chuckle. "I don't 
want to decapitate any lobbyists or senators." No clapping along either,
 he told the crowd of 7,000 or so: It would destroy his "already 
tenuous" sense of rhythm.<br>
<br>
After establishing Bruce's Rules of Order for the solo acoustic evening,
 the 55-year-old rock giant began with "My Beautiful Reward," an 
anguished song about searching for meaning when life's ephemeral 
offerings disappear or fail to deliver on their promises. That theme 
dominated the stripped-down, 2 1/2 hour, 25-song performance. And it was
 a theme he explored in his between-song comments as well.<br>
<br>
Drawing heavily from his new album, "Devils &amp; Dust," Springsteen 
traversed minefields of doubt and belief, anger and forgiveness, 
suffering and hope. As he sang the new album's title track through 
gritted teeth, his words sounded dark and cautionary: "We've got God on 
our side / We're just trying to survive / What if what you do to survive
 / Kills the things you love." On another new song, "The Hitter," he 
related a harrowing tale of a son beseeching his mother for a temporary 
reprieve from a life gone far off course.<br>
<br>
<br>
In addition to the new songs, Springsteen performed "The River" on piano
 and some radically reworked older material, including the grim and 
rarely played "Wreck on the Highway" and a version of the heroic anthem 
"Promised Land" that was slowed to a muttered crawl. "Reason to Believe"
 from 1982's "Nebraska" was recast as some sort of foot-stomping, 
Gothic, Delta blues exorcism. The rendition, sung through a tricked-up 
microphone and accompanied only by Springsteen's howling-cat harmonica, 
was so incomprehensible that even the signer for the hearing-impaired 
sat that one out.<br>
<br>
A supporter of John Kerry in last year's presidential election, the Boss
 didn't back off on the political front. He took President Bush to task 
for his stance on evolution in a humorous intro to "Part Man, Part 
Monkey." Later, in his prelude to "Matamoros Banks," a song about the 
death of a Mexican migrant worker that could be a 21st-century version 
of Woody Guthrie's "Deportees," Springsteen said, "We don't really need 
vigilantes along the border. What we need is a humane immigration 
policy." Lou Dobbs might want to book him as a guest.<br>
<br>
As antidote to the evening's more somber fare, Springsteen offered the 
joyful "Long Time Comin'," a celebration of coming to terms with 
fatherhood that he introduced by saying, "I'm just happy to be viewed as
 a tolerable idiot by my kids."<br>
<br>
Before playing another life-affirming song, "Leah," Springsteen talked 
about choices people need to make in a world where temptation and lures 
are set in front of them like "giant mousetraps." "You've gotta have 
faith," he advised, "and come down on the right side of the equation." 
It was a point reinforced by the concert's beautiful conclusion, "Dream 
Baby Dream," a reworked song of the same name by the obscure synth band 
Suicide. "I wanna see you smile / I just wanna see you smile," 
Springsteen sang, repeating the line over and over until it felt like 
some sort of spiritual incantation. Faced with the choices, he comes 
down on the right side, offering himself, and his fans, reasons to 
believe.</div>

<br>
By Joe Heim<br>
Washington Post <br>
Wednesday, April 26, 2006</strong><br>
<br>
Afunny thing goes missing on Bruce Springsteen's new album, "We Shall 
Overcome: The Seeger Sessions," a collection of covers that New Jersey's
 most famous son says was inspired by the grandpa of American folk 
music, Pete Seeger. Guesses, anyone? Well, if you said an actual Seeger 
song, then -- ding-ding -- you win.<br>
<br>
For some reason, the Boss decided that while he would name the tribute 
album for the revered singer and songwriter, he wouldn't include covers 
of even one of Seeger's songs. Instead we get a spirited, fairly 
straightforward remaking of folk ditties and standards that ol' Pete 
helped popularize . It can't be that Bruce is so tight with a dollar 
that he didn't want to pay Seeger any royalties, but the omission of any
 Seeger songs is still baffling -- and remains unexplained.<br>
<br>
Imagine for a moment Springsteen in his dotage, maybe 30 years hence, 
being told of a tribute album being made to him by a middle-aged 
recording star (a graying Kanye, perhaps?) that didn't include any songs
 he had penned. No "Born to Run," "The River" or "Atlantic City?" Tell 
me Bruce, how does it feeeel?<br>
<br>
Well, perhaps this bothers Pete Seeger not at all. He has always been an
 unselfish crusader for and propagator of the American folk song. And 
with this effort, Springsteen and a dozen or so energetic band mates 
(not the E Streeters) do that tradition proud, revitalizing 15 songs in 
danger of being forgotten.<br>
<br>
Beginning with a rollicking version of "Old Dan Tucker," the album 
sweeps through the past few centuries to visit legendary tales of 
outlaws, ("Jesse James"), railway builders ("John Henry") and anguished 
mothers of soldiers ("Mrs. McGrath"). It also breathes new spirit into 
the gospel standard, "Mary Don't You Weep."<br>
<br>
<br>
Springsteen channels his gritty Western/Jersey drawl for a bittersweet 
take on "My Oklahoma Home," and later revs up the band for a shambling, 
rambling shanty, "Pay Me My Money Down." But it is his version of "We 
Shall Overcome," offered here as a gentle prayer, that is the album's 
riveting centerpiece. Dave Marsh's extensive liner notes help explain 
the lineage of each song, and a 30-minute making-of video adds some 
levity to this project while also shining a light on Springsteen's 
attention to detail in the rearrangement of these historic songs.<br>
<br>
So perhaps it is unfair to criticize Springsteen too harshly for his 
Seeger song bypass. Perhaps taking these songs that might have otherwise
 languished in semi-obscurity and reintroducing them in a new century is
 the essence of the folk tradition. Perhaps Pete Seeger isn't missing 
from this tribute after all. Perhaps.</div>

<br>
By J. Freedom du Lac<br>
Washington Post <br>
Tuesday, October 2, 2007</strong><br>
<br>
Meet the new Boss, same as the old Tommy Tutone.<br>
<br>
Seriously: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band's deceivingly dark 
(but eminently listenable) new album, "Magic," opens with "Radio 
Nowhere," a glossy, chugging rocker that shares a chord progression with
 Tommy Tutone's long-ago smash, "867-5309/Jenny." Or is it Warren 
Zevon's similar-sounding "Splendid Isolation"?<br>
<br>
Either way, it makes for a startling opening salvo -- and not because 
one doesn't figure Springsteen for a Tommy Tutone fan. "Radio Nowhere" 
happens to be the most melodically sticky tune we've heard from the Boss
 in years. It also rocks relatively hard, powered by Max Weinberg's 
crashing drums and a ringing triple-guitar attack.<br>
<br>
The lyrics may be somewhat suspect, with Springsteen noting that his 
drive "through the misty rain" is part of his search for "a mystery 
train" -- words that could have been produced by a 
random-Springsteen-lyric generator, or maybe Brandon Flowers of the 
Killers. But "Radio Nowhere" still works musically.<br>
<br>
It's no outlier: "Radio Nowhere" is the perfect stage-setter for 
Springsteen's most musically accessible album since "Born in the U.S.A."
 became a bestseller (and seller . . . and seller) 23 years ago. Full of
 strong melodies, sharp hooks and the sort of muscular, fluid playing 
one expects on a collaboration between Springsteen and his longtime 
band, "Magic" marks a stark change from Springsteen's recent output -- 
from 2002's somber post-9/11 salve, "The Rising," and 2005's 
monochromatic "Devils &amp; Dust," to last year's old-time folk 
hootenanny, "We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions."<br>
<br>
That "Magic" isn't the most original of all Springsteen albums may not 
matter. Springsteen recycling Springsteen (among others) is still a 
pretty fair formula, even if it means references to courthouse flags, 
neon lights and fatherly advice, along with some vintage Springsteen 
sounds. "Livin' in the Future," for instance, brings to mind the classic
 "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out," what with Clarence Clemons's blaring 
saxophone, Garry Tallent's swaggering bass line and Danny Federici's 
organ breaks. "I'll Work for Your Love" opens with Roy Bittan's familiar
 twinkling piano and nothing but before turning into an updated take on 
Springsteen's "For You," set to a melody that faintly echoes Billy 
Joel's "Piano Man."<br>
<br>
<br>
"Magic" is not an overtly blue-state album, though it has its moments --
 most notably "Last to Die," which rocks with a particular focus and 
fury as Springsteen turns an angry eye to the Bush administration and 
sings: "The wise men were all fools." In the song, Springsteen 
resurrects John Kerry's Vietnam-era congressional testimony, repeatedly 
asking: "Who'll be the last to die for a mistake?"<br>
<br>
There's also "Devil's Arcade," a vague lament from a soldier's lover who
 loses her man to the military. "You said heroes are needed, so heroes 
get made," Springsteen sings. "Somebody made a bet, somebody paid/The 
cool desert morning and nothin' to save/Just metal and plastic where 
your body caved."<br>
<br>
While the music on "Magic" tends to sound buoyant, even triumphal, the 
central figures in the lyrics are isolated, alienated, disconnected and 
disillusioned. They've been betrayed, deceived, dismissed. There's a 
riptide of angst tugging at those who occupy Springsteen's Americana. 
This is not an album for happy people living in happy times. (Curiously,
 the most uplifting entry is "Terry's Song," a deeply heartfelt tribute 
to Springsteen's longtime assistant, who died in July.)<br>
<br>
"Trust none of what you hear/And less of what you see," Springsteen 
warns on "Magic's" swaying title track. In "Your Own Worst Enemy," a pop
 masterstroke rendered in the shimmering, expansive style of Brian 
Wilson, Springsteen sings: "The times they got too clear/So you removed 
all the mirrors/Once the family felt secure/Now no one's very sure."<br>
<br>
Springsteen, now 58, considers what it means to grow old, and he's not 
sure that he likes what he sees. "You'll be fine long as your pretty 
face holds out/Then it's gonna get pretty cold out," he observes in 
"You'll Be Comin' Down." In the melancholy "Girls in Their Summer 
Clothes," one of the weakest songs on the album ("Gypsy Biker" is 
another), Springsteen ruefully observes that said girls now pass him by.<br>
<br>
At least we think that's what he's saying.<br>
<br>
He's a tricky lyricist who can write with precision, drawing you in with
 poetic, if often unspecific, details. But the view tends to change as 
you step back for the long view.<br>
<br>
Is "Long Walk Home" about a broken romance -- or a veteran who now feels
 like an outsider in his own home town? There are even layers to "Radio 
Nowhere," on which Springsteen sings of drones bouncing off satellites 
and of spinning around dead dials. "This is Radio Nowhere/Is there 
anybody alive out there?" he growls. It's unclear whether the song is 
about the sorry state of commercial radio or the sorry, soulless state 
of the world at large.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Review: Bruce Springsteen's 'Working on a Dream'<br>
By J. Freedom du Lac<br>
Washington Post <br>
Tuesday, January 20, 2009</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen has a dream.<br>
<br>
He has a dream that one day, this rock-and-roll nation will rise up and live like it's 1965/1966 all over again.<br>
He has a dream that our pop stars will one day live in a nation where 
they will not be judged by the RIAA-certified colors of their gold and 
platinum albums, but by how well they appropriate the spectral mid-'60s 
sounds of the Beach Boys, Byrds, Beatles, Roy Orbison, Phil Spector and 
even Ennio Morricone.<br>
That's the prevailing musical message of Springsteen and the E Street 
Band's surprising new album, "Working on a Dream." Streaming this week 
on NPR.org and scheduled for release on Jan. 27, "Working on a Dream" is
 unlike any of the previous 15 studio sets in Springsteen's remarkably 
rich catalogue, inasmuch as it's the Jersey boy's first album in which 
style clearly trumps substance.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is forever striving to blend profound lyrics with bracing 
rock-and-roll or folk, depending on his musical mood. But "Working on a 
Dream" is full of lyrical missteps and half-realized ideas. The album 
doesn't go nearly as deep as you'd expect from one of rock's preeminent 
poets; Springsteen's lyrics tend to be overshadowed by the album's 
generally bright melodies and lush textures and sounds.<br>
<br>
The sonic sum here is frequently something to behold, as in "Queen of 
the Supermarket," which begins simply, as a mid-tempo piano ballad, 
before adding everything from swelling strings and swirling 
Eastern-tinged guitar chords to stacked vocal harmonies and the rhythmic
 beep of an electronic cash register. It's a marvelous, majestic song, 
save for the lyrics, in which Springsteen goes shopping at a store 
"where aisles and aisles of dreams await you" -- specifically, where "a 
dream awaits in aisle number two" -- and winds up snatching a 
hidden-beauty metaphor from the clearance bin. (Leave it to the Boss to 
try to romanticize the mega-mart shopping experience.)<br>
<br>
It's a recurring problem. "Surprise Surprise," for instance, is a 
devastatingly catchy power-pop song built around chiming, Byrdsian 
guitar chords and punched up with the sort of swirling keyboard line 
that might make Ray Manzarek beam with pride. It sounds like the best 
Traveling Wilburys song you've never heard, only with strings and, 
unfortunately, the sort of lyrics that Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Tom 
Petty, et al., might have laughed out of the room: "And when the sun 
comes out tomorrow, it'll be the start of a brand new day/And all that 
you have wished for I know will come your way."<br>
On the driving rocker "My Lucky Day," over ringing guitars and piano 
fills, Springsteen plays with the old love-is-a-gamble motif, but can 
only come up with this couplet: "Well, I lost all the other bets I 
made/Honey, you're my lucky day."<br>
<br>
Bruuuuuce?<br>
<br>
Much better is "This Life," which features some of the best vocal 
harmonies this side of the Beach Boys and includes one of the album's 
most memorable lyrics: "I finger the hem of your dress/My universe at 
rest."<br>
<br>
Bruuuuuce!<br>
<br>
Throughout the album, Springsteen sounds relatively content -- a far cry
 from his state of mind 16 months ago, when the bitter and oft-bleak E 
Street album "Magic" was released. Then, Springsteen was downright 
disturbed by the realities of this American life under the watch of 
George W. Bush. Now, he sounds optimistic and occasionally giddy. But 
it's hardly a celebration of Obama-era political change: "Working on a 
Dream" is an apolitical album that goes for subtlety over Big Statements
 as Springsteen, at 59, considers personal relationships and the passage
 of time.<br>
<br>
On "Kingdom of Days," Springsteen ponders love and mortality and how 
romance can almost make time stand still, singing: "I don't see the 
summer as it wanes/Just the subtle change of light upon your face." 
Lyrically, it's one of the album's more moving songs. But it's also 
musically overwrought, with strings adding a thick coating of schmaltz 
and sending the whole thing smashing into the wall inside the tunnel of 
love.<br>
<br>
Mortality looms over "The Last Carnival," the standout that comes near 
album's end. A gloriously bittersweet tribute to the late E Street Band 
organist Danny Federici, who died in April from melanoma, it's full of 
striking imagery and shot through with a haunting, echoing harmony vocal
 that sounds as if it's coming from the great beyond. "Hanging from the 
trapeze/My wrists waiting for your wrists," Springsteen sings. "Two 
daredevils high upon the wall of death."<br>
The Boss is at his very best on the album-closing, Golden Globe-winning 
theme from "The Wrestler," on which he sings of struggle and survival 
over strummy acoustic guitar with some tinkling piano and buried backing
 vocals, but no stacked harmonies, no strings and no stabs at soaring 
grandeur. It's a stark, simple character study, and the most emotionally
 gripping song on the album. Funny thing that: Springsteen shines when 
he's trying to sound less like Brian Wilson, et al., and more like . . .

<br>
By Neely Tucker<br>
Washington Post  <br>
Thursday, May 14, 2009</strong><br>
<br>
Just more than 300 fans who bought tickets for the Bruce Springsteen 
concert at Verizon Center on Monday night discovered yesterday they had 
purchased nonexistent seats from TicketsNow, an online company that sets
 up transactions for ticket-holders to resell their seats, often at 
highly inflated prices.<br>
<br>
The ticket company, based in Illinois and owned by Ticketmaster, was 
part of a larger Springsteen ticketing fiasco earlier this year. The 
company rushed to make amends throughout the day, offering slighted 
customers doubled refunds or tickets and travel money to different 
Springsteen shows.<br>
<br>
"We've talked to every customer and are down to 24 situations that we 
haven't yet worked out some measure" of compensation, said Julia Vander 
Ploeg, TicketsNow's senior vice president of marketing.<br>
<br>
The reimbursement packages consisted of either a 100 percent refund and a
 gift card of equal value for future purchases through the company, or 
tickets to other Springsteen shows plus $150 for a hotel and $75 in 
gasoline expenses.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's camp was clearly unhappy about this latest incident with TicketsNow.<br>
<br>
"There are what now appear to be chronic problems with how Ticketmaster 
uses its secondary market ticket reseller TicketsNow," said Springsteen 
manager Jon Landau in an e-mail. "We would like our audience to know 
that this is a problem concerning Ticketmaster and its wholly owned 
subsidiary TicketsNow. Neither Bruce nor his management have any control
 whatsoever over these two troubled entities."<br>
<br>
<br>
Media reports yesterday said that "thousands" of "premium" tickets could
 not be delivered by sellers, but Ploeg said those reports were 
inaccurate. She said the seats were spread out over the 18,000-seat 
arena, and were not the handiwork of dishonest sellers.<br>
<br>
"There is no fraud involved," she said.<br>
<br>
Rather, Ploeg said, the problem stemmed from the crush of ticket orders 
the minute the seats went on sale. She said "the confirmation of ticket 
orders with sellers is a manual process" and that, with so many tickets 
being bought so quickly, mistakes were made in the confirmation process.<br>
<br>
Verizon Center spokeswoman Sheila Francis confirmed yesterday that the 
arena sold out "in about 20 minutes" through Ticketmaster when they went
 on sale Feb. 2.<br>
<br>
Tickets for sports, concerts and other entertainment outings are sold by
 Ticketmaster, the nation's largest ticketing agency, at face value. But
 it has become a routine -- and, by some, despised -- occurrence for 
people to buy up blocks of tickets at regular prices and then resell 
them at inflated prices at virtual marketplace sites such as TicketsNow.<br>
<br>
That is what happened in February when tickets for Springsteen's Working
 on a Dream Tour first went on sale. Thousands of fans reported they 
were unable to buy tickets at face value from Ticketmaster but were 
instead offered seats at inflated prices on TicketsNow. Attorneys 
general in at least two states launched investigations, and Springsteen 
and his manager said they were "furious" about the "abuse" of fans.</div>

<br>
By J. Freedom du Lac<br>
Washington Post  <br>
Wednesday, May 20, 2009</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen wasn't about to shuffle quietly into the night. Having
 already spent nearly three sweaty hours striving for rock-and-roll 
deliverance Monday at Verizon Center, Springsteen thundered one last 
time down that familiar redemptive road.<br>
As the E Street Band roared through an encore version of the 
rambunctious old war horse "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)," Springsteen 
growled and howled his joyous circa-1973 lyrics about forbidden love and
 "stone desire." He stood on his tiptoes to punctuate particular guitar 
licks or vocals. He darted back and forth across the spartan stage, feet
 and, especially, fists pumping. He exhorted the crowd to sing the final
 pre-chorus part louder, then even louder still.<br>
"It's the big one!" he shouted. "BIGGER!" The sound inside the arena 
spiked, as requested, and Springsteen unleashed an impassioned shriek, 
sending his feverish fans over the edge.<br>
<br>
At 59, Springsteen remains one of the most potent live performers in 
popular music, largely because he's among its most committed 
practitioners. He drains every bit of his creative energy whenever he's 
onstage -- all in the service of proselytizing the power of 
rock-and-roll, in which his faith is unwavering.<br>
"Washington, are you ready to be delivered?" he asked at the outset of 
Monday's concert, before diving into "Badlands," a breakneck rocker 
about working-class spirit.<br>
<br>
Later, during a somewhat leaden performance of the title track from his 
new album, "Working on a Dream," the Boss bellowed his mission statement
 for the show: "We're gonna take the fear out there and we're gonna 
build a house of hope!" Also, he promised: Despair would be transformed 
into love, doubt into faith, sadness into joy and happiness.<br>
<br>
Springsteen long ago embarked on an everlasting edition of Brother 
Love's Traveling Salvation Show, whose guiding principle is to deliver 
hope and redemption through song. Accordingly, Monday's show featured 
more than a few moments of redemptive rapture.<br>
But it wasn't necessarily a show for the best-of books, despite the 
sense of purpose with which the band performed and the generosity of the
 nearly three-hour set, which spanned 25 songs -- 27 if you counted the 
instrumental riffs on "Hava Nagila" and "Hail to the Chief," the former 
requested on a Torah-scroll sign, the latter a nod to another sign's 
"Rosalita" request, which read: "Obama called, he wants 'Rosie.' " ("By 
executive order!" Springsteen joked by way of introducing the 
show-closing song.)<br>
<br>
The mix was muddy beyond belief. Opener "Badlands," for instance, was a 
toxic swirl of cacophonous noise during which the vocals and 10 
instrumental parts repeatedly crashed into each other. "No Surrender," 
an otherwise terrific mid-1980s anthem about war, romantic dreams and 
lost youth, was a relatively indecipherable and impenetrable wall of 
sound. "She's the One" suffered similarly once the instrumental parts 
began stacking atop the clean, simple power chords and Max Weinberg's 
irresistible Bo Diddley beat.<br>
<br>
The set also featured an overabundance of songs from Springsteen's 
fallow period -- which is to say, from his new album, which is full of 
lyrical missteps and half-realized or, worse, ill-considered ideas from 
one of rock's preeminent poets. There were only four songs from "Working
 on a Dream" in the set, but it sounded like three too many.<br>
<br>
Whereas "The Wrestler" was an emotionally gripping character study on 
which Springsteen sang convincingly of struggle and survival, "Outlaw 
Pete" was a melodramatic epic that played like a parody of a 
"Nebraska"-era Springsteen story-song, or maybe like Meat Loaf doing 
musical theater. It came across forced and farcical, especially when 
Springsteen donned a black cowboy hat. Would you like some cheese with 
that hamminess?<br>
Yes? Well, "Working on a Dream," whose lyrics sound like Springsteen on autopilot, featured a cheesy whistling interlude.<br>
"Kingdom of Days" was better lyrically, as Springsteen considered the 
notion of romance making time stand still with his wife, Patti Scialfa, 
singing by his side. But, as on the recorded version, the musically 
overwrought live performance sounded schmaltzy.<br>
Still, the set was generally well considered, with Springsteen mixing 
some of his greatest hits (the blistering "Born to Run") and oldest 
misses (the swinging, shifty jazz-blues workout "Kitty's Back") with a 
handful of superlative recent songs, including "Waitin' on a Sunny Day" 
and post-9/11 anthem "The Rising," on which Nils Lofgren's slide guitar 
soared.<br>
<br>
On 2007's Magic tour, Springsteen's set was loaded with songs about 
isolation, alienation and disillusionment. Monday's theme was more 
hopeful, with several references to the promised land -- including "The 
Promised Land" itself -- as well as multiple songs about optimism, as 
with "Land of Hope and Dreams," which included an interpolation of 
Curtis Mayfield's epochal "People Get Ready."<br>
Not that all's well in this American land. Springsteen acknowledged the 
recession in several songs, including "Seeds," "The Ghost of Tom Joad," 
an overly muscular "Johnny 99" and a standout version of Stephen 
Foster's "Hard Times (Come Again No More)."<br>
It wasn't the night's only cover, for Springsteen and the E Street Band 
have been getting in touch with their inner-jukebox lately; on Monday, 
they revived Eddie Floyd's R&amp;B hit "Raise Your Hand" to stirring, 
soulful effect and bashed out a wobbly garage-rock version of the 
Righteous Brothers song "Little Latin Lupe Lu" upon request.<br>
<br>
No audience is more important to Springsteen than the one he's currently
 trying to win over, and he's connecting with his fans on this tour by 
soliciting their set-list input at every show. So there he went, racing 
around the front of the stage, collecting handmade signs with titles on 
them and then calling out audibles to the band, including titles from 
their own catalogue.<br>
Most notable was "Out in the Street," an idealistic 1980 song about 
community -- a fitting theme, as Springsteen performed part of the 
raggedy rocker while seated at the foot of the stage, right next to the 
little girl who'd apparently made the request.<br>
She sang with him and held the microphone while Springsteen played his 
guitar. But he wasn't sitting down on the job for long; soon enough, the
 Boss was back on his feet, running, gesticulating, mugging, exhorting 
and hollering, doing everything in his considerable powers to deliver on
 that promise of salvation.</div>

Washington Post<br>
<br>
By David Malitz, Published: April 2, 2012 <br>
<br>
It was heavy.</strong><br>
<br>
That went for both the rumble and the message that came from the Verizon
 Center stage Sunday night when Bruce Springsteen delivered three hours 
of rock-and-roll in his signature blend of romantic, redemptive and 
reflective. Springsteen and his supersized E Street Band know how to 
preside over a party, and although Sunday’s show had its share of 
arms-around-your-buddy, beers-in-the-air moments, the bad times were 
clearly more on the Boss’s mind than the good ones.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen on America: Bruce Springsteen’s new album “Wrecking 
Ball” explores themes of a nation’s faded promise, of its lost covenant 
with its workers, veterans and youth. As he was working on the album, a 
new book gave him the chance to write his thoughts about three decades 
of tough times in our nation. The following are excerpts of his foreword
 to “Someplace Like America,” by Washington Post photographer Michael 
Williamson and writer Dale Maharidge, both Pulitzer Prize winners.<br>
<br>
The tone was set early when Springsteen opened with “We Take Care of Our
 Own” and “Wrecking Ball,” the title track of his latest album. Both 
songs find Springsteen stepping into the role of Everyman conscience of 
America, one he has played startlingly well for nearly four decades. On 
the former, he slashed at his Fender Telecaster and sneered the titular 
chorus, which has a message that’s equal parts “we’re in this together, 
America” and “get your act together, America.”<br>
<br>
Between songs, the Boss was in his usual rock-and-roll preacher mode 
(“We wanna wake you up, shake you up and take you to higher ground!”), 
but those sound bites were nothing more than a spirited version of a 
flashing “Applause!” sign. Springsteen is the rare performer who goes 
off script with his song choices, not his banter. His message was 
underscored with the inclusion of “American Skin (41 Shots),” a song 
written in response to the killing of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed Guinean 
immigrant who was shot by New York police officers. The song is 
Springsteen at his most outspoken and has reappeared on recent set 
lists. Springsteen didn’t say the name Trayvon Martin as he did at 
previous shows; he didn’t need to. “The Promise,” a 35-year-old song 
about the bleak prospects of Middle America (“When the promise is broken
 you go on living, but it steals something from down in your soul”), 
spoke to the current economic condition much more elegantly than his 
cheap-cheer line, “We want to put a whoop-ass session on the recession.”<br>
<br>
Another rarity to make the cut Sunday was “Adam Raised a Cain,” a 
thundering, brooding track from 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” 
It shook the arena with the force of three bands — mostly because that’s
 pretty much what Springsteen had onstage with him. This 17-piece 
incarnation of the E Street Band is a true power-in-numbers ensemble 
that succeeds on sheer abundance of sound. When the band took the stage,
 it was something like an NFL team assembling into a wildcat formation, 
and the expanded lineup helped rescue some of the limp new material. At 
times, it was like a rock-and-roll version of “The Twelve Days of 
Christmas.” There were five guitarists strumming, four tambourines 
shaking, three trumpets blasting, two keyboards buzzing and one Max 
Weinberg sitting behind the drum kit holding everything together with 
his fierce and precise playing.<br>
<br>
Of course, the E Street Band roll call was not entirely complete; organ 
player Danny Federici died in 2008, and saxophonist Clarence Clemons 
died in June. This is Springsteen’s first tour without the Big Man, and 
it was hard to envision him onstage without one of rock-and-roll’s most 
iconic sidemen to his right. A five-piece horn section helped cushion 
the blow, and that it was headed by Clemons’s charismatic and able 
nephew Jake was a nice multi-generational touch for a show that featured
 plenty of parents with children in tow. “Tenth Avenue Freeze-out,” an 
old Clemons showcase, ended the concert, and when the music cut out 
after Springsteen sang the line, “When the change was made uptown / And 
the Big Man joined the band,” cheers erupted for a full minute in 
tribute.<br>
<br>
Not that it was all death, doom and gloom. Grown men hugged each other 
during “Born to Run.” A medley of soul chestnuts including “The Way You 
Do the Things You Do” and “634-5789” saw Springsteen race across the 
stage and into the audience, touching dozens of hands that probably 
won’t be washed for a good two weeks. He plucked a sign out of the crowd
 and granted its request of fan favorite “Out in the Street.” He shook 
his hips like it was 1984 in a houselights-on version of “Dancing in the
 Dark.” Moments like these are standard at Springsteen shows, and the 
fact that he can still make them feel special is a testament to his 
abilities as a pure entertainer.<br>
<br>
Springsteen could have offered nothing but entertainment and pure 
escape, and it would have easily been a show worthy of his reputation as
 one of live music’s best. But on Sunday, he didn’t escape, he dove 
headfirst into the heart of America, and if what he found wasn’t always 
pretty, it sure was powerful.</div>
