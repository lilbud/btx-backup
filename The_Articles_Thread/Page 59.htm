 Does The Boss still have the talent?<br>
By Leora Arnowitz<br>
Published May 19, 2014<br>
<br>
FoxNews.com</strong><br>
<br>
As the lights dimmed at Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band's 
sold-out Mohegan Sun show in Uncasville, Conn., on Saturday, the packed 
arena of 9,000 fans fell briefly quiet. At 64, does The Boss still have 
the same musical chops he once did?  “Oh yeah,” said Sally Gonzalez, who
 traveled from Arizona for the show.  “He’s still got it!”  Gonzalez 
told FOX411 she’s seen Springsteen perform three times in the past three
 weeks, following his tour to Raleigh and New Orleans. She said she 
decided to come to the tour’s final performances after hearing murmurs 
that Springsteen may not head out on the road again.  A rep for the 
rocker confirmed to FOX411 that Springsteen has no immediate plans to 
tour again.  But some fans of The Boss are skeptical that he will ever 
slow down.  “He’ll keep going till he’s 100,” assured Leil Warner.  If 
Springsteen was feeling any of the typical signs of aging, he certainly 
didn’t show it. He played for three and a half hours, barely pausing 
between songs. In the middle of the show, he crowd surfed through the 
audience and stopped at one point on stage to chug an audience member’s 
beer faster than your average frat brother.  The crowd loved it, roaring
 “Bruuuuce” whenever he quieted. To the untrained ear, their chant could
 sound like boos, but the Springsteen fans in the crowd all understood 
what was up.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's only glitch of the evening came when he repeatedly 
prompted the crowd to cheer when he called out "Massachusetts," even 
though the show was in Connecticut. Otherwise, the evening was without 
errors.   He opened the show with “Racing in the Street” and sprinkled 
the show with well-known hits, like “Radio Nowhere.”  The audience was 
filled with Springsteen concert veterans and first-timers 
alike.  Douglas Litos, 32, and Lacy Weathersbee, 37, made the trip to 
see the show from New York City and managed to accidentally turn what 
should have been a two and a half hour drive into a six-hour trek.  “We 
got lost and ended up in Massachusetts,” Litos explained.  But the 
Springsteen concert first-timers said they couldn’t miss his tour’s 
closing.  A few rows up, Tom and Bonnie Stebbins snapped pictures of the
 stage as they waited to see their third Springsteen show. Last time 
they saw Bruce, Bonnie Stebbins was recovering from a liver transplant 
and got a hug from The Boss after he spotted her in the audience.  “I 
don’t know if lightning will strike twice, but we’re looking at those 
stairs [nearby] and hoping he’ll come over again,” Tom Stebbins 
said.  It didn’t. But Springsteen did make another fan’s dream come true
 as he jumped off the stage and into the crowd to dance with her during 
one of his songs.  Though the crowd at the show definitely skewed into 
the over 50 crowd, plenty of young people were there to see the 
64-year-old rock. Several young families were in the audience, complete 
with children wearing ear-protecting headphones and holding neon signs 
for The Boss to see.  Gonzalez said the diverse crowd is part of the 
reason she opted to follow Springsteen for the tail end of his tour.  “I
 always wondered about people who see the same show over and over 
again,” she said. She said each concert is a unique experience and “he 
does a different set list” every time.  “It was on my bucket list, and I
 didn’t want to miss [what could be] the last tour,” she said.  She said
 she thought his Mohegan Sun show was the best she’d seen. Litos and 
Weathersbee echoed her sentiment.  So was it worth their six-hour 
drive?  “It would have been worth 12,” Litos assured. “It was the best 
show I’ve ever seen.”</div>

<br>
By Sarah Rodman<br>
BOSTON GLOBE   MAY 20, 2014</strong><br>
<br>
UNCASVILLE, Conn. — When Bruce Springsteen walked onstage at Mohegan Sun
 Arena Sunday night to close out his tour with the E Street Band, he 
asked the sold-out crowd if they had won or lost money at the casino.<br>
<br>
The answer was of no consequence, however, as Springsteen declared, 
“Either way, we’re going to make you feel lucky tonight” as he and the 
band — 17 members strong — launched into the setting appropriate “Roll 
of the Dice.”<br>
<br>
From that point forward it seemed as if Springsteen was hellbent on 
exhausting himself, the band, and the crowd, wringing out every last 
drop of energy, sweat, and fire for the final show on a tour that 
started over two years ago. The group roared through nearly 30 songs in 
almost three hours, often counting off the start of one tune before the 
last had ended.<br>
<br>
While the set list was dotted with popular concert singalongs — 
“Badlands,” “Born to Run,” “Dancing in the Dark” — Springsteen was also 
clearly in an expansive mood, taking offbeat sign requests and calling 
so many audibles that the musicians were constantly scampering and 
huddling, telling each other what song was next.<br>
<br>
It was remarkable to watch as the group worked out arrangements nearly 
immediately to some songs that hadn’t been played all tour — or in the 
case of “Seven Angels,” ever — and then played them with remarkable 
precision. (And kudos to the teleprompter operator who uses that time to
 find the lyrics and load them.)<br>
<br>
In addition to “Dice” and “Angels,” a welcome down and dirty rocker, 
other left-field choices near the beginning of the night included a 
jubilant “Leap of Faith” and the slow-burning whisper of “Frankie.”<br>
<br>
Christmas also came early in the form of “Santa Claus Is Coming to 
Town,” played at the behest of a little girl who brought her request 
sign onstage. And they also took another go at Van Halen’s “Jump,” which
 they had played earlier this year at an NCAA basketball event.<br>
<br>
That last tune was among several that featured the newest addition to 
the touring band, Rage Against the Machine guitar alchemist Tom Morello,
 who contributed to the album “High Hopes.”<br>
<br>
In addition to proving a capable fill-in for Eddie Van Halen on “Jump,” 
Morello added welcome intensity to the song “High Hopes” — a maelstrom 
of acoustic and electric guitars, percussion, and Springsteen’s 
impassioned wail — and tore it up on an incendiary “The Ghost of Tom 
Joad,” during which he and Springsteen shared the microphone and traded 
solos.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s steady microphone partner, guitarist Steven Van Zandt, was
 also in fine form after having missed part of the tour to film the 
second season of his Netflix series “Lilyhammer.”<br>
<br>
He and Springsteen had walked out together, arms slung around each 
other’s shoulders, and were locked into a groove all night, at times 
harmonizing with intensity as on “Ramrod” and at others cracking each 
other up, as on a revved-up “You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch).”<br>
<br>
While the night’s tilt was toward the upbeat, there were several more 
contemplative though no less energetic passages, including a brooding 
“Darkness on the Edge of Town,” the biblical fire of “Adam Raised a 
Cain” — featuring a maniacally warped guitar solo from Springsteen — and
 the always uplifting “The Rising.”<br>
<br>
Even with a whopping 17 members, Springsteen gave each musician a chance
 to shine in some way. (It could’ve been 18 but Springsteen’s wife, 
guitarist-singer Patti Scialfa, chose to sit the show out.)<br>
<br>
The horn section in particular were a hit with the punch they added to 
everything from “Jump” to “Tenth Avenue Freeze Out,” and their 
showmanship added a level of gaiety to the proceedings, particularly on 
an epic horn breakdown section of “Johnny 99.”<br>
<br>
Saxophonist Jake Clemons was in particularly fine form, playing the epic
 solo from “Jungleland” with a skillful dynamism. Clemons appeared to 
choke up as he finished playing the solo created by original E Street 
sax man, his uncle Clarence Clemons, and Springsteen came over and laid 
his head on his shoulder after having given a hushed-to-howling vocal 
performance that seemed to have officially spent his energy.<br>
<br>
Both Clarence Clemons and the late keyboardist Danny Federici were 
warmly recalled with video tributes during “Tenth Avenue Freeze Out.”<br>
<br>
Curiously, Springsteen did not introduce the band or engage in one of 
his customary bursts of testifying, instead sticking with letting the 
music do the talking.<br>
<br>
Springsteen returned to the stage solo and sat at a small pump organ and
 thanked both the fans in the arena and the 4 million who had come out 
to see the tour for “one of the greatest musical stretches of our 
lives.”<br>
<br>
With the help of his trio of backing vocalists he performed a meditative
 cover of Suicide’s “Dream Baby Dream,” that was part elegy, part 
lullaby, part prayer, sending the audience off with a message of hope.</div>

By Bob Allen <br>
BILLBOARD<br>
| May 22, 2014 </strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen has wrapped his 2014 High Hopes tour that included 
performances in 25 cities worldwide during a four-month span. Ticket 
sales totaling $14.3 million from the final nine markets give the 
legendary rocker this week’s No. 1 Hot Tours ranking. The final date was
 a two-night engagement at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn. with 
sellout crowds for both shows. The performances on May 17 and 18 
produced a sold ticket count of 15,716.<br>
<br>
The tour was in support of Springsteen’s latest album "High Hopes," 
released just days prior to the late January tour opener in Cape Town, 
South Africa. The launch, a three-show arena engagement on Jan. 26, 28 
and 29, was followed by a sold-out concert at FNB Stadium in 
Johannesburg on Feb. 1. After South Africa, the tour made a seven-city 
sweep through Australia and New Zealand during February and early March,
 playing four arenas and two stadiums as well as an outdoor concert at 
Hope Estate Winery. The final trek through North America began on April 6
 with a festival appearance in Dallas that kicked off a swing through 15
 more cities. Although primarily an arena tour, the High Hopes outing 
included four outdoor amphitheaters during its North American trek as 
well as one stadium. That performance occurred on May 14 in Hershey, Pa.
 with a crowd of 28,398 in attendance at Hersheypark Stadium. The final 
box office gross from the High Hopes tour totaled $64.9 million from 
554,032 sold seats at 32 shows.<br>
<br>
The High Hopes tour came on the heels of the 18-month touring effort 
following the release of "Wrecking Ball" in March 2012. That tour began 
in March 2012 and wrapped last September. Combining the numbers from 
both tours, Springsteen’s overall gross during the past two years and 
two months on the road is $411.9 million from 157 concerts. More than 4 
million fans saw the iconic rock star during that time period.</div>
