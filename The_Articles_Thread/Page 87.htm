<br>
THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD <br>
MARCH 23, 1985</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">At his first Sydney concert, on March 21,  the 'saviour of rock and roll', Bruce Springsteen, gathered more true believers.<br>
<br>
By Katherine Tulich</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
For years we've been hearing about the saviour of rock and roll – Bruce 
Springsteen - that he was the greatest rock and roll performer of our 
time. The superlatives for Springsteen never seem to stop. Could the 
mythic proportions of his reputation be true?<br>
Well, I'm sure after Springsteen's first Australian concert on Thursday 
night at Sydney's Entertainment Centre, there are many true believers.<br>
￼<br>
Sydney has never seen a finer and more spirited show (nor is it likely 
to for some time). Springsteen played for 3 hours and 20 minutes. Not 
for one second did the energy levels wane.<br>
<br>
He sang with gut-wrenching conviction, played guitar, played harmonica, 
jumped into the first rows of the audience, leapt on top of the piano, 
slid across the stage, on his knees and by interval we thought we had 
seen a great concert. But after interval Springsteen just got better and
 better.<br>
He had the audience totally captured, whether he was doing the rockier 
songs like Prove It All Night, Badlands, Cover Me and Dancing in the 
Dark (during which, as in the video, a lucky girl from the front rows 
gets a chance to dance with The Boss), or whether he was doing the more 
emotional ballads like Atlantic City, Reason To Believe, Racing in the 
Streets and his Vietnam song Shut Out the Light, when there was total 
enraptured silence.<br>
<br>
He has a wonderful rapport with the audience, and introduces many of his
 songs with witty or poignant stories. He is just as good a storyteller 
in words as he is in song.<br>
￼<br>
While Springsteen has had a strong following in the US for more than 10 
years, much of his popularity was based on his stagecraft. His fame 
really exploded in this country with the single and video of Dancing in 
the Dark.<br>
<br>
One could expect a majority of the audience to be only familiar with his
 Born in the USA material, but there was a vast cross section of ages at
 the concert and his older songs were greeted with as much enthusiasm as
 his new ones. Even Springsteen seemed surprised when the audience 
started to sing along to Thunder Road, which is from his 1975 album Born
 To Run.<br>
<br>
The members of his E. Street Band are as legendary as The Boss - there 
was Roy Bittan on piano, Danny Federici on keyboards, Garry Tallent on 
bass, Max Weinberg on drums, Nils Lofgren on guitar and, of course, the 
great Clarence Clemons on saxophone. They are all consummate musicians 
and Springsteen works in well with them, all at ease from playing so 
many years together.<br>
<br>
Springsteen did two long encores with Born To Run, I'm A Rocker and 
Mitch Ryder ' s Detroit Medley (Devil With A Blue Dress, Good Golly Miss
 Molly and Jenny Take A Ride).<br>
<br>
Springsteen is so brilliant because he has an undying belief in the 
cause of rock and roll. There's no cynicism; for him, like the early 
rock and rollers, it's the kind of experience that changes your life.<br>
<br>

<br>
7 Lessons on Dynamic Pricing (Courtesy of Bruce Springsteen)<br>
<br>
by Rafi Mohammed<br>
September 30, 2022<br>
</strong><br>
Bruce Springsteen recently ignited an uproar by utilizing dynamic 
pricing for tickets to his 2023 U.S. concert tour. Dynamic pricing is 
the strategy of constantly adjusting prices in response to demand, a 
practice that consumers are accustomed to when buying airline tickets 
and booking hotels. In recent years, sports teams have begun using the 
technique, and Ticketmaster now offers musical artists the option of 
using it for concert tickets, too. As a result of Springsteen’s decision
 to allow Ticketmaster to use dynamic pricing, tickets for some of his 
shows reportedly jumped to over $5,000.<br>
Fans were upset that Springsteen – a longtime advocate for the working 
class – was charging such high prices. Some accused him of gouging. The 
controversy surrounding Springsteen’s new pricing strategy has several 
teachable lessons for businesses beyond the music industry. Here are 
seven:<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">1. Customers do not want to be surprised about prices.</strong><br>
<br>
Prior to the on-sale date, no hints had been proffered on how extensive 
dynamic pricing would be used nor how high prices could go. This was 
unexpected and caused outrage.<br>
<br>
The lesson from that is clear: Businesses need to clearly explain a new 
pricing strategy to customers in advance of implementation. After the 
initial uproar, Ticketmaster reported that just 11.2% of tickets were 
dynamically priced and the rest were sold at fixed prices, with the 
average price below $300. Only 1.3% of tickets sold were over $1,000. 
This is not egregious: If Springsteen and his team had been so inclined,
 every concert ticket could have been dynamically priced. But the 
failure to communicate this strategy in advance left fans confused and 
upset.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">2. Don’t be afraid to challenge pricing myths.</strong><br>
<br>
I routinely hear a variety of unsubstantiated dictums from managers 
about why their prices cannot be tinkered with, such as “we can’t raise 
our prices above a certain competitor.”<br>
<br>
Instead of following these types of rote missives, it is crucial to 
pushback and ask: Is this really true? In this case, the prevailing myth
 might be: If you are considered a friend of the working class, you must
 set egalitarian prices. But is that really true? Other socially 
progressive luminaries have not felt so. Prices for Michelle Obama’s 
2019 book tour reached $4,200 and fourth-row seats for “An Evening with 
the Clintons” event in Seattle were $829. Interest in Springsteen’s 
upcoming concert was so high that one Philadelphia promoter claimed that
 it was “experiencing the largest demand for tickets in Philadelphia 
music history.” Is The Boss required to set prices that are drastically 
below what the market will pay for all seats – even the best ones? I do 
not think so.<br>
<br>
And remember, for every concert, a significant number of tickets are 
bought by scalpers as well as fans who purchase “extras” to resell for a
 profit; when artists raise prices, the economic justification is that 
much of the profit they’re taking would otherwise go to scalpers, not 
fans. A survey of attendees at an October 2002 Springsteen concert 
revealed that 28.1% of tickets were resold, with an average markup of 
240%. So challenging these myths can make sense, if implemented 
correctly.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">3. You are not required to grandfather low prices to loyal customers.</strong><br>
<br>
One of the complaints about Springsteen’s pricing is he was exploiting 
longtime fans, who’ve been paying to attend his shows since the 1970s. 
It is natural to be grateful to long-standing customers. Just remember 
that they purchased out of self-interest, not charity, and they’re not 
necessarily owed a life-long discount. On previous tours, fans got a 
fantastic deal because for whatever reason, Springsteen preferred to 
price all tickets at below-market value. In my experience — I have seen 
Springsteen in concert approximately 40 times, and yes, I bought tickets
 to his 2023 shows — his energetic performances have yielded the 
greatest dollar-for-dollar value in concert history.<br>
For companies pricing goods or services that are purchased more 
frequently than concert tickets, however, when implementing a steep 
price increase, I recommend slowly transitioning existing customers when
 possible. Instead of raising prices immediately, let them know that as 
VIPs, the boost will be gradually implemented over a longer time period.
 This prevents sticker shock and conveys appreciation.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">4. Low prices can devalue a product.</strong><br>
<br>
Springsteen’s history of charging below-market prices conditioned fans 
to expect them. This illustrates the hazards of extending discounts.<br>
I’m often asked by start-ups if they should extend steep discounts to 
initial customers, because as a startup, these companies tend to be 
happy just to have some initial customers. I urge them to proceed 
cautiously. Not standing up for your product’s value by discounting to 
get early sales can be problematic when it comes time to focus on 
profit.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">5. Be aware of the expectations that accompany a high price.</strong><br>
<br>
Springsteen did a Broadway show in 2017 and raised a similar hullabaloo 
by charging $850 for the most desirable seats. The show earned critical 
acclaim (including winning a Tony Award) that justified the price. That 
said, with a $5,000 price tag associated with the upcoming tour, 
expectations will be high. Springsteen’s habit of starting tours by 
playing a significant amount of new material may be off-putting to fans 
who came for his hits from the ’70s and ’80s — and if they’re unhappy, 
they are likely to broadcast their displeasure on social media. Even if 
the buzz surrounding the concerts is weak, the beauty of price and value
 is it is straightforward to change both.<br>
There are already rumors that Springsteen’s early 2023 dates will be 
followed by a stadium tour starting next August. If the spring tour 
doesn’t meet fans’ expectations, Springsteen could lower prices and 
focus on his “greatest hits” for the stadium dates.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">6. Stated willingness to pay is likely not accurate.</strong><br>
<br>
In an effort to determine an optimal price, market research techniques 
such as a Van Westendorp analysis ask survey participants questions 
about their willingness to pay. I know several people who actually did 
pay over $1,000 for a ticket for the upcoming Springsteen dates. Since 
this amount was so out of their expected norm, they would have never 
stated it in a survey. At least for these diehard customers, their 
answers to these types of “how much” pricing questions would 
underestimate their true willingness to pay. It’s an example of how 
market research doesn’t always reflect reality.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">7. Your profit is not your customers’ concern.</strong><br>
<br>
Some have argued that since Springsteen recently sold his catalog for an
 estimated $550 million, he is wealthy and should not charge premium 
prices. Similarly, many of my B2B clients are afraid to charge prices 
that capture the value of their products because the increased profit 
will be reflected in their annual income report. They fear that this 
will upset their customers and lead them to push for discounts. This is 
when you should confidently say, “if you can find a better value, take 
it.” Even if you are a publicly traded company and your healthy profit 
is known, customers will purchase as along as a product’s price is 
commensurate with its value.<br>
<br>
Raising prices is rarely a frictionless event where customers readily 
agree. It is inevitable that some will complain and possibly not 
purchase. In such cases, the most important thing producers should focus
 on is making sure the price is backed up by value. Whether or not 
Springsteen’s pricing strategy is deemed a success will depend on him 
performing a strong “it was worth the price” concert. Given his track 
record of innovation and dedication to perfection, my money is on Bruce.</div>

<br>
Eye-popping ticket prices have generated furious op-eds and social media
 posts in recent weeks. A group of experts weigh in on what's wrong with
 the system alongside various solutions<br>
<br>
BY ANDY GREENE, ETHAN MILLMAN<br>
<br>
ROLLING STONE -AUGUST 2, 2022<br>
</strong><br>
FOR THE PAST four decades, Backstreets Magazine has devoted itself 
entirely to the world of Bruce Springsteen. Longtime editor and superfan
 Christopher Phillips and his team treat every new album, archival 
release, and concert as joyous affairs. But on July 24, days after 
Springsteen’s long-awaited E Street Band tour went on sale and stunned 
fans who came across tickets costing upwards of $5,000, Phillips and 
company found themselves in the unusual position of writing a deeply 
critical editorial about their hero.<br>
<br>
“This past week, too many Springsteen fans got thrown to the wolves, 
pushed aside in a way that seems as unfathomable as it was avoidable,” 
they wrote. “The artist has maintained that he understands the essential
 role of his audience. How, then, did we end up facing, in far too many 
instances, prices for tickets that exceeded normalcy, then departed from
 reality entirely by orders of magnitude?”<br>
<br>
The Springsteen fans were far from alone. Around the same time, Adele 
fans looking to buy tickets for her rescheduled Las Vegas residency on 
StubHub saw seats starting at $670 for nosebleeds and capping out at 
$40,000 for the front row. A quick glance at Ticketmaster reveals that 
“side view” seats for Lady Gaga at New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium are 
$445.80 (general admission front pit tickets are $923.40), and primo 
floor seats to Motley Crue/Def Leppard/Poison at PNC Park in Pittsburgh 
will set you back $987.50. Live Nation announced on recent earnings call
 that “fan demand for the best seats has driven concert ticket pricing 
up double digits from 2019, while entry level tickets average under 
$35.”<br>
<br>
<br>
But eye-popping prices for high demand shows generated furious op-eds 
and social media posts in recent weeks (“So this is what a crisis of 
faith feels like,” Backstreets wrote in a widely-shared tweet), and 
caused many to conclude this was simply a matter of rock star 
greed.&nbsp;<br>
The truth is far more complicated. For decades, the ticketing industry 
has formed into the current price-gouging headache it is, due to a 
combination of factors such as Live Nation’s near-monopoly over live 
music, artists’ growing reliance on touring for their revenue, new 
technology giving scalpers a larger platform to hike up prices, and 
limited government intervention to help control the market.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">How Live Nation’s Near-Monopoly on the Concert Business Changed Live Music</strong><br>
<br>
In 1995, Pearl Jam grew so frustrated by Ticketmaster’s exorbitant 
service fees and stranglehold on the live music industry that they 
attempted to play only venues that used competing ticketing services. As
 they soon learned, this meant playing non-traditional venues like The 
Adams Field House at the University of Montana. When they went back out 
in 1998, they simply gave up and played largely Ticketmaster venues.<br>
<br>
It’s been over 25 years since Pearl Jam found out that touring on a 
large scale without Ticketmaster is basically impossible, and the 
situation has only grown worse. Companies like SeatGeek may have inked 
deals with major venues like the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, but 
Ticketmaster still controls over 80 percent of major concert venues in 
America.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
“They are a monopoly,” says New York State Senator James Skoufis. “That 
comes with all of the standard problems that are associated with 
monopolies, not the least of which is there is not a healthy competitive
 market. They are able to charge whatever they want without any sort of 
consequence in what would otherwise be a competitive marketplace.”<br>
<br>
“The ticketing industry is more competitive than ever,”a Ticketmaster 
spokesperson said to Rolling Stone, “and Ticketmaster invests millions 
in our technology every year to ensure we are able to help event 
organizers sell their tickets how they want to.”<br>
<br>
“They are a monopoly. That comes with all of the standard problems that 
are associated with monopolies” – New York State Senator James Skoufis 
on Ticketmaster<br>
<br>
Ticketmaster’s 2010 merger with Live Nation made the two companies 
exponentially more powerful. In 2021, Live Nation sold over 13 million 
tickets and grossed over a billion dollars. AEG, its chief competitor, 
sold 3 million tickets and grossed $281 million. Simply put, Live Nation
 would be the hegemonic power in the live event space even without 
Ticketmaster. But once they merged, they became the mightiest force in 
the history of the live music industry.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
With that power, fans have come to accept things like service fees that 
often jack up the total price by 30 percent, and on-sales for major 
events where resellers wind up with the lion’s share of the tickets. In 
recent years, as opposed to finding new and innovative ways to weed 
scalpers out of the system, Ticketmaster decided to profit from them by 
providing them with a way to effortlessly sell their tickets. (A 
Ticketmaster rep vehemently disputes this claim, writing that they have 
“invested tens of millions of dollars and considerable resources 
developing technologies that help real fans get fair access to tickets.”
 The company also claims that it doesn’t fully control ticketing fees, 
and that venues more often set and keep the ticket fee.)<br>
<br>
Like most major ticketing companies, Ticketmaster has begun using 
“dynamic pricing” where ticket prices fluctuate, sometimes wildly, 
depending on demand. During the recent Springsteen on-sale, fans saw 
$400 tickets become $5,000 right in front of their eyes. “Promoters and 
artist representatives set pricing strategy and price range parameters 
on all tickets, including dynamic and fixed price points,” a 
spokesperson for Ticketmaster tells Rolling Stone. “Ticketmaster has 
created analytical tools that use historical and real-time data to help 
quantify supply and demand to determine prices. The promoters and artist
 representatives then determine the specific pricing for their shows.”<br>
<br>
After a flood of outrage over high prices by Springsteen fans, 
Ticketmaster released numbers showing that only 12 percent of tickets to
 most shows used dynamic pricing, and the average ticket cost was $262. 
“While people may have had a very different impression,” a spokesperson 
for Ticketmaster tells Rolling Stone, “overall 18 percent of 
Springsteen’s U.S. tour tickets sold for under $99, and only 1 percent 
of tickets sold for more than $1,000.”<br>
“If you underprice the tickets, you’re inviting brokers to get between 
you and fans and customers,” says one former industry executive<br>
Springsteen’s manager Jon Landau echoed this sentiment in a statement to
 the New York Times last week. “In pricing tickets for this tour, we 
looked carefully at what our peers have been doing,” he said. “We chose 
prices that are lower than some and on par with others. “Regardless of 
the commentary about a modest number of tickets costing $1,000 or more, 
our true average ticket price has been in the mid-$200 range,” he 
continued. “I believe that in today’s environment, that is a fair price 
to see someone universally regarded as among the very greatest artists 
of his generation.” <br>
<br>
(Landau declined to comment for this story.)<br>
<br>
But a lot of the cheaper tickets immediately wound up on resale sites 
like Stubhub or Ticketmaster’s own resale service. That left many fans 
forced to pick between inflated tickets on the secondary market or face 
value seats that typically cost $1,000 each.<br>
For many fans, buying tickets to concerts has become a confusing, highly
 stressful event, where they wind up spending way more than they’d like,
 and there’s little sign that’ll change anytime soon.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Addressing Low Supply of Tickets that Allows Brokers to Thrive&nbsp;</strong><br>
<br>
Even without a dynamic pricing model, fans likely would’ve spent 
thousands for the most desirable tickets for Springsteen’s shows, but on
 the resale market instead of from Springsteen himself. Tickets are a 
fertile breeding ground for scalping because artists usually try to make
 tickets obtainable for fans, but the demand is too high for tickets to 
stay that way.<br>
<br>
“What most people don’t recognize is that if you underprice the tickets,
 you’re inviting brokers to get between you and fans and customers,” a 
former industry executive says. “If you underprice anything, look at 
Sony — they underpriced their PS5s and a lot of interlopers stepped in 
and resold them at ridiculously high prices. It’s common sense: If you 
underprice something with overwhelming demand, someone is going to 
figure a way to get between you and your customer and make a profit off 
of that.”<br>
<br>
In fact, the executive contends that the Springsteen prices likely 
could’ve sold for even more than they did. While such an assessment 
seems ludicrous — given the jaw-dropping prices on shows like Adele’s 
residency — it may not be off-base.<br>
<br>
“I think you could’ve seen well north of $10,000 [per ticket]. You 
could’ve tripled the numbers. I think there was restraint; some careful 
consideration on how it looked for Bruce. It was a relatively 
conservative approach compared to what his peers do,” the exec says. 
“But it’s the first time he took a step like that and fans aren’t used 
to that from him. Clearly there was surprise. No fan ended up paying 
more than what they were willing to pay, and the same fans that bought 
the expensive tickets would’ve bought them on the resale market if not 
for this tactic.”<br>
<br>
“Brokers are valuable to both the industry and ticket buyers as they 
hedge the risk for event organizers who are promoting low-demand events”
 – StubHub’s chief business officer Cris Miller<br>
<br>
For decades, companies like StubHub and SeatGeek have harbored ticket 
scalpers who most consistently drive up ticket prices for the fans, and 
they’ve given them the best platform they’ve ever had to find a new 
buyer. No matter how much fans bemoan jacked-up prices, financially, the
 reselling sites have no incentive to dampen the market as they get a 
percentage of every purchase made on their sites.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
“They’ve done a masterful job in painting themselves on being on the 
side of the fan, but what they’ve really done is create this economy 
that in a sense has allowed brokers to get in the middle,” the ticketing
 exec says of the resale markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In a statement to Rolling Stone,&nbsp;StubHub’s chief business officer 
Cris Miller refuted the criticism and added that brokers play a key role
 in the ticketing landscape by helping mitigate risk promoters take on 
for concerts.<br>
<br>
“StubHub’s seller base is split evenly between brokers and independent 
sellers, made up of everyday ticket buyers who are re-listing tickets 
they’re unable to use,” Miller says. “Brokers are valuable to both the 
industry and ticket buyers as they hedge the risk for event organizers 
who are promoting low-demand events and they increase accessibility for 
fans by offering healthy competition and multiple points of 
distribution.”<br>
<br>
Miller claims that reselling is an important tool for fans in a primary 
ticketing environment that “is not currently predicated on access nor 
ease for fans. First and foremost, the industry is lacking transparency,
 which results in uninformed fans who are not empowered to make educated
 buying decisions,” he says. “Coupled with single channels for 
distribution – reducing healthy competition in the interest of buyers – 
fans are left with no options but to jump through hoops to try to buy 
tickets to an event from an unknown amount of inventory.”<br>
<br>
Regarding the potential to cap how much a reseller can earn on tickets, 
Miller maintains support for allowing resellers to charge what they want
 without limit. “We believe artists have a right to be able to sell 
their tickets at whatever price they see fit,” Miller says. “And 
similarly, once that ticket is rightfully purchased by a consumer, we 
respect that ticketholder’s right and freedom to resell their ticket, 
freely as a truly free market should allow.”<br>
<br>
“I could imagine a scenario where an artist parked in a city … They just
 have to sit somewhere and be willing to satisfy all the demand” – 
Lyte’s Chief Strategy Officer Lawrence Peryer<br>
<br>
The scalpers themselves still have a leg up on fans because of bots that
 can help them grab more tickets, and with other strategies like farming
 phone numbers to get more chances to land tickets that require personal
 information. The only way to calm down the scalping market is to 
address the low supply for the sky-high demand for shows. That could 
either be through government intervention or initiatives from 
artists.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There are also ticketing startups who want to find solutions themselves.
 Lyte, founded in 2014 by Ant Taylor, aims to give fans more power in 
the resale market by creating a market where they can exchange and 
return tickets. Lyte also works with promoters and agents by asking fans
 to “pre-order” tickets to shows by getting their credit card 
information to confirm they want to buy a ticket in advance.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
While an artist is routing their tour, they can use the information from
 Lyte to determine what size room they need and more specifically 
calculate demand. Such a strategy may not make much of a difference for 
the Billie Eilishes of the industry, who confidently know they’ll likely
 sell out whatever size venue they play, but Lyte’s Chief Strategy 
Officer Lawrence Peryer is confident the concept is effective.<br>
<br>
“A lot of other ticketing solutions focus on only the supply. So people 
go in time-exclusive ticketing deals for the rights to control a venue 
for a period of time or a tour for a period of time,” Peryer says. “And 
we really look at both sides of the market. We look at the supply and 
the demand. We try to capture as much demand before and after an on-sale
 and before and after sell out, so that the promoter or whoever is 
planning the event or the tour has insight into the demand. And then 
they can make decisions.”<br>
￼<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Artists Can Try and Take More Control of Their Ticketing Strategies</strong><br>
<br>
While corporations exert a significant amount of control over the 
market, the buck — to a certain extent — stops with an artist and their 
teams as far as decisions about ticket prices, the number of dates 
they’ll play and where they’ll perform. While Live Nation and 
Ticketmaster will more than likely urge high-demand artists to use tools
 like dynamic pricing to take more of the profits off the scalpers and 
put them into the artist’s hands and their own, the artist has to agree 
to whatever ticketing strategy their tour employs.<br>
<br>
Some of the more-common tools are Ticketmaster’s Verified Fan 
technology, which in theory should help ensure fans who won’t resell 
tickets get the first shot to buy. And there’s non-transferrable 
tickets, which should ostensibly remove scalpers from the marketplace 
and ensure tickets will maintain a fixed rate.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
And if an artist feels particularly passionate about ensuring tickets 
stay in fans’ hands and stay affordable, they have to take control of 
supply and demand. Garth Brooks, for example, notoriously floods a given
 market to drive up ticket supply to meet demand from fans.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
“I could imagine a scenario where an artist parked in a city,” Peryer 
says. “They don’t have to play more shows, they don’t have to do 
anything differently in terms of how they currently function. They don’t
 have to work harder. They just have to sit somewhere and be willing to 
satisfy all the demand.”<br>
“If you are working in this space as a policymaker and you aren’t 
already familiar with how much anger there is from fans, your head is in
 the sand,” says the former ticketing executive<br>
<br>
But while an effort like Brooks’ is admirable, it’s extreme and 
unsustainable for most artists and unreasonable to expect an artist like
 Bruce Springsteen to play the amount of nights in one city it’d take 
before everyone who wanted to could see him.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There’s no one-size-fits-all solution for an artist to address ticketing
 problems, and it’s often an uphill battle for an artist to address 
ticketing themselves. Some states passed legislation that limits the 
tool artists can use for their tickets. Verified Fan helps slow down 
bots, but it’s unclear how much it actually stops scalpers. And 
non-transferable tickets aren’t always convenient either. The Black 
Keys, for example, used non-transferrable tickets for a special 
fanclub-only show at the Wiltern in Los Angeles in 2019.<br>
<br>
Tickets couldn’t be resold for that show, but that didn’t stop scalpers 
from selling seats — which the band subsequently noted were $25 and 
intended for fan club members only — for hundreds of dollars on the 
secondary market anyways. Hundreds of fans were eventually turned away 
at the door the day of the show, and they sharply criticized the band 
for how the event was handled despite efforts that were initially 
enacted to try and guarantee fans had the fairest shot at getting into 
an exclusive show.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But still, artists do have some autonomy for their ticketing strategies,
 and while they shouldn’t always be the first to blame for a ticketing 
fiasco, it is somewhat a matter of how aggressively they want to pursue a
 fair ticketing market for customers. As the former executive puts it, 
“Ticketmaster is mainly the order-taker here. If an artist said they 
wanted tickets to be five dollars, then that’s what they’d cost. Whether
 it’s Live Nation, Ticketmaster, AEG, everything should be in support of
 that. Then it’s a matter of the artists owning their decisions.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
“Artists can say, ‘Look I’m worth it, you’re gonna pay that,’” the exec 
adds. “Take that to the consumers, then you let the fans decide if 
that’s right. Or on the other side, ‘I’m an altruist and I want fans to 
have the cheapest price possible, and I’ll still put on that show and 
leave some money.’ That’s great, and let the artists have those tools. 
The sad part is, I actually think a lot of those tools are there, 
they’re just not always being used.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
The Government Can Intervene&nbsp;</strong><br>
<br>
In theory, there’s much that the U.S. government could do to minimize 
the high price of tickets, or at least make the system fairer. They made
 a noble attempt in the final days of the Obama administration when the 
Better Online Tickets Sales Act passed, which outlawed the use of ticket
 bots. But there’s a big problem with the law nobody anticipated. “There
 has literally been zero enforcement,” says Skoufis. “Ticketmaster 
catches bot activity all the time. But they don’t send these instances 
to prosecutors.”<br>
<br>
(A Ticketmaster representative claimed the company advocated for the 
BOTS Acts to include “private right of action” put in so ticketing 
companies could go after violators directly, but ultimately that wasn’t 
included in the law.)<br>
<br>
Skoufis has attempted to pass a law that would compel Ticketmaster and 
other ticket services to alert the Attorney General’s office when bot 
activity is detected, and would even give them a piece of the fee that’s
 collected if successfully prosecuted, but it didn’t gain any traction 
in the State Assembly. “They went very hard against that on behalf of 
the ticketing platforms,” says Skoufis. “Across the board, they wanted 
nothing to do with this.”&nbsp;<br>
(“Ticketmaster continues to work with state Attorneys General and the 
Federal Trade Commission in an effort to enforce the provisions of the 
BOTS Act,” Ticketmaster shared in a written statement to the FTC. 
“Ticketmaster has also pursued private lawsuits against bot users. Most 
recently, Ticketmaster invested substantial resources to litigate a case
 in federal court in the Central District of California, which resulted 
in a sweeping injunction against the defendant’s use of bots and similar
 tools.”)<br>
<br>
Skoufis also tried to make it illegal for Ticketmaster and other 
companies to “double-dip” on a single ticket by charging a service fee 
for the original on-sale and then another one when it’s re-sold on their
 same platform. This was also shot down by the State Assembly even 
though it’s seemingly such a common sense measure that would be hard to 
reasonably oppose. “Everything I’m trying is a 99-1 issue out in the 
public,” Skoufis says. “Problem is the public doesn’t have an army of 
lobbyists. And the problem is the public doesn’t have access to the 
halls of power, in Albany or most other capitals.”<br>
<br>
One thing Skoufis did manage to get signed into law was a requirement 
that companies list the full price of tickets upfront, instead of 
burying the service fees until the final moment of the transaction. “We 
were the first state in the nation to do this,” he says. “I do believe 
it will make a meaningful difference when folks are shopping around for a
 ticket they want to purchase. But also, at least around the edges, I 
think that in egregious situations, it may even shame the sellers into 
being more reasonable with their fees.”<br>
<br>
“We worked collaboratively with New York policymakers to enact a new law
 that adds important new protections and transparency for fans, and we 
are supportive of industry-wide reforms to bring more clarity to ticket 
buyers,” a spokesperson for Ticketmaster told Rolling Stone, “and 
believe more can be done to aid artists in delivering their tickets to 
fans at price points they determine.”<br>
<br>
And while Ticketmaster and Live Nation have more pull with lawmakers 
than your typical rock music fan — and it’s hard to imagine the day that
 the Ticketmaster/Live Nation monopoly will be broken apart by the 
government — Skoufis is optimistic that significant change may come in 
the future if consumers remain as livid as they are right now with the 
status quo. “If you are working in this space as a policymaker,” he 
says. “and you aren’t already familiar with how much anger there is from
 fans, your head is in the sand.”</div>

<br>
Nebraska plunged listeners into a dark world of serial killers, poverty 
and a broken American dream. Could Springsteen have made it today?<br>
By Ian Winwood<br>
October 21,  2022 <br>
LONDON TELEGRAPH</strong><br>
<br>
On September 30 1982, Bruce Springsteen released Nebraska, his sixth 
studio album. Recorded in the living room of a rented house in Colts 
Neck, New Jersey, with an acoustic guitar and a harmonica as its 
prominent instruments, the 10-song collection is its author’s most 
complete, not to mention his most compelling, examination of 
street-level America. As one of the record’s doomed narrators warns, 
“down here it’s just winners and losers and don’t get caught on the 
wrong side of that line”. <br>
<br>
It’s a tough world, alright. Over the course of barely 40 minutes, 
Nebraska casts its eye over a landscape in which the deck is stacked 
against the working man (and, this being 1982, they are all men). With 
his cast of characters running to stand still, even their creator 
appeared to drift into the shadows of his strange and sparse new album. 
Declining to promote the LP with the normally obligatory world tour, 
instead, Springsteen absented himself from the stage for a remarkable 
two and a half years. <br>
<br>
Even more remarkable is that the record was finished in little more than
 a day. Needing to record a brood of new songs written in short order, 
Springsteen instructed his guitar tech, Mike Batlan, to “just go find me
 a little tape machine – nothing too sophisticated, just something I can
 do overdubs on”. In what would prove to be a breakthrough in home 
music-making, the lion’s share of the LP was recorded on the four-track 
Tascam PortaStudio, with two Shure SM57 microphones for voice and 
guitar. <br>
<br>
Crucially, Nebraska was never meant to be heard in this form. But when 
its songs proved resistant to either the adornments of backing group the
 E Street Band, or their author’s attempts to re-capture their fragile, 
ethereal magic in solo form in a professional recording studio, it 
became obvious that the best and truest version of the record was in 
fact a demo cassette tape that had been made for the ears of only a 
select few. It cost about a thousand dollars. <br>
<br>
“I wanted black bedtime stories,” Springsteen writes in his memoir Born 
to Run. “I wanted the listener to hear my characters think, to feel 
their thoughts, their choices. These songs were the opposite of the rock
 music I’d been writing. They were restrained, still on the surface, 
with a world of moral ambiguity and unease below. The tension running 
through the music’s core was the thin line between stability and that 
moment when things that connect you to your world, your job, your 
family, your friends, the love and grace in your heart, fail you.”<br>
<br>
You can say that again. The album’s opening song, its title track, is a 
first-person narrative inspired by the serial killer Charlie 
Starkweather, whose rampage in the coldest months of 1957 and 1958, in 
Nebraska and Wyoming, saw him executed for the murders of 11 people. 
Awaiting his fate on death row, in this musical retelling, the condemned
 man is asked the motive for his crimes. “Well, sir, I guess there’s 
just a meanness in this world,” is his reply. As a moral framework for 
an entire LP, this simple line is impossible to beat. <br>
<br>
Of course, more than any other wildly successful artist, Bruce 
Springsteen is skilled at singing about the dispossessed in a way that 
doesn’t sound as if one is listening to what he himself once described 
as “a rich man in a poor man’s shirt”. This much is known. But on the 
untamed expanse of Nebraska, the dark appetites that marble even his 
most celebrated material are given license to run riot. Never mind the 
redemptive possibilities of earlier songs such as Born to Run or Racing 
In The Street, by 1982 the mood is pessimistic to the point of 
hopelessness.<br>
<br>
Here, blue-collar grafters struggle to afford the price of a “brand-new 
used car”, unemployed sweethearts await the arrival of lovers placed on 
the nightshift by petty bosses, penniless patsies in Philadelphia fall 
prey to the mob, children stare in wonder at a mansion on a hill, and 
farmers retrain as cops on account of plummeting wheat prices. As the 
voices of America chatter on the radio – “it’s just talk, talk, talk, 
talk, ‘til you lose your patience,” notes one jittery narrator – 
everyone has been backed into a corner so tight that the only autonomous
 decisions available to them are acts of violence.<br>
<br>
As the album officially enters middle-age, remarkably, none of these 
characters have aged a single day. As economic and political headwinds 
bring havoc to their streets once more, the cast of Nebraska could just 
as plausibly be trudging through the sludge of 2022 with the same kind 
of buckled tenacity as they did four decades earlier. Springsteen’s 
refusal to eulogise his creations, his skill at drawing individuals in 
three-dimensions rather than as speculative or sentimentalised 
caricatures, means that it’s easy to imagine them toiling, or else doing
 terrible harm, throughout every day for the past 40-years. <br>
<br>
Reviewing the record for California magazine, Greil Marcus, the singer’s
 finest critic, struck a resonant note when he wrote, “The countless 
details of craft and empathy that underlie this album portray… a world 
in which honest work has been trivialised and honest goals reduced to a 
bet on a state lottery; a world where the rich live as a different 
species, so far above the aspirations of ordinary people as to seem like
 gods.” I don’t know about you, but this too reads to me like it could 
have been written yesterday. <br>
<br>
With much of its action taking place under cover of darkness, there is a
 theory that Nebraska’s timeline takes place over the course of a single
 day. Certainly, good bleeds into bad like twilight into dark. On 
Highway Patrolman, a police officer abandons a high-speed pursuit of his
 own brother on the grounds that family trumps the law. As the 
perspective flips, on State Trooper, a taut and troubled driver fears 
the prospect of being pulled over by a nearby squad car with a dread 
that is about more than self-interest. Maybe the cop has “got a kid, 
maybe [he’s] got a pretty wife,” whereas “the only thing that I got’s 
been botherin’ me my whole life,” is the ominous rumination.  <br>
<br>
Framed in such fragile settings, Nebraska left even the most admiring 
viewers in a state of confusion. Reviewing the LP in the San Francisco 
Chronicle, Joel Selvin wrote that “on this record, Springsteen fouls up 
time and meter on frequent occasions, mumbles inarticulate lyrics at 
points, and generally includes stray marks and moments of human 
fallibility anybody else would have taken the time to record over.”<br>
<br>
He went on, “Never before has a major recording artist made himself so 
vulnerable or open. Only somebody who is as trusted, known and loved as 
Springsteen could get away with dashing off a few quick sketches, 
throwing them in frames and mounting them on gallery walls… it is a 
stark, raw document, rough edges intact, and so intimately personal it 
is surprising he would even play the tape for other people at all, let 
alone put it out as an album.”<br>
<br>
Of course, even this high degree of unvarnished transparency wasn’t 
enough to prevent some listeners hearing only what they wanted to hear. 
As the magazine Artforum correctly pointed out, in an essay published in
 1984, “[Nebraska’s] final number was called Reason to Believe, and 
critics fell over themselves in a rush to assure their readers that this
 last word testified to their hero’s unbroken optimism”. <br>
<br>
But hold on a minute. As with Born in the U.S.A. – “one of my greatest 
and most misunderstood pieces of music,” according to its author – the 
easy shorthand of the song’s chorus tended to overshadow the rest of the
 song. Because, really, Springsteen’s announcements that “at the end of 
every hard-earned day people find some reason to believe” only sounds 
redemptive if one overlooks verses littered with jilted grooms, 
exploited lovers, and a man looking down at a dead dog “like if he stood
 there long enough that dog’d get up and run”. Believe all you want, but
 you’re wasting your time. <br>
<br>
Released amid the glitz of the Eighties, I don’t think it’s a surprise 
that (at the time, at least) Nebraska was Springsteen’s lowest selling 
album. But it’s also proved to be his most enduring. Certainly, in the 
21st Century, this strange and troubled piece about the cacophony of an 
American nightmare has become the record of choice for the committed 
connoisseur. The hard truths behind its cold stare have proved 
persistent to the point of immovability.</div>

<br>
For his 21st album, one of the greatest rockers of all time takes on vintage R’n’B. What's not to love?<br>
By Neil McCormick,<br>
MUSIC CRITIC<br>
LONDON TELEGRAPH <br>
<br>
November 4, 2022 </strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen's new album Only the Strong Survive will be released on November 11 <br>
Bruce Springsteen is one of the greatest rock stars of all time, a 
passionate and profound singer-songwriter on a mission to make music 
that matters and songs that serve the people. His 21st album, however, 
lets him do something else: just sing his heart out for his pleasure and
 ours.<br>
<br>
Only The Strong Survive is the second Springsteen album comprising 
entirely of cover versions, the other being We Shall Overcome in 2006, a
 rambunctious exploration of folk and gospel as an exercise in communal 
singalong. If that was all about the power of shared voices, this is 
about Springsteen’s individual voice. He has set himself the task of 
scaling what many might consider the summit of pop singing by tackling 
15 vintage soul and R’n’B songs, including such exalted classics as I 
Wish It Would Rain by The Temptations and Jimmy Ruffin’s What Becomes of
 the Brokenhearted. <br>
<br>
It is clear from the opening snare crack of the Jerry Butler title track
 that Springsteen is enjoying himself, launching into some feisty back 
and forth with a lush squadron of backing singers. The key, tempo and 
time-switching arrangement are identical to the 1969 original, but what 
is immediately noticeable is how beefed up the sound is, how the drums 
punch, strings float, guitars tickle and bass buoys the whole bottom 
end. A big ensemble of session musicians (not his usual E Street Band, 
though their ripe horn section plays a vital role) effectively recreate 
classic arrangements for modern ears. To use one of those automotive 
analogies Springsteen is so fond of, it’s like a vintage racing car has 
been stripped down and reassembled with 21st century turbo charged 
power. In the driving seat, Springsteen handles this old beast like he 
was born to it. <br>
<br>
<br>
Has Springsteen ever been considered purely as a singer? He has a gruff,
 rough, manly voice with a lot of lung power and a slow modulation. He 
doesn’t really have the inherent ache and delicate flexibility of the 
soul singers he most admires and has to locate different flavours of 
hurt masculinity in covers of William Bell’s I Forgot to Be Your Lover 
and Tyrone Davis’s Turn Back the Hands of Time. But Springsteen has 
charisma and conviction to match anyone who has ever picked up a 
microphone, allied to a dynamic grasp of exactly when to ramp up and 
when to hold back, and he delivers these songs like they mean the world 
to him. In other words, he’s got soul. <br>
<br>
Only the Strong Survive reflects Springsteen’s pre-fame days as leader 
of a covers band on the New Jersey shore, reminding us how much R’n’B 
filtered into the epic rock sound he ultimately developed. Frankly, he’s
 always going to come out second best to a singer of the cosmic class of
 Scott Walker on The Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine Anymore, yet with its 
melodramatic grandeur it could fit easily into his own back catalogue.<br>
<br>
Springsteen tackles Ben E. King’s 1962 single Don’t Play That Song! 
fully aware there is no possibility of going head-to-head with the 1970 
version by Aretha Franklin. Where she scales melismatic heights, 
Springsteen roars of his wounded love like he’s trying to get a crowd to
 back him up in a squabble. It’s not exactly darkness on the edge of 
town because he’s having way too much fun, but it’s pretty irresistible 
all the same, like stumbling into the world’s greatest bar band playing 
the world’s greatest setlist at the wildest shindig ever thrown. At 73, 
Springsteen sounds like he’s having the time of his life. Boss soul - 
what’s not to love?</div>

Bruce Springsteen: Only the Strong Survive review — an appealing love letter to a glorious era of music<br>
Will Hodgkinson<br>
Friday November 04 2022,<br>
 The Times of London via The WSJ</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
★★★★☆<br>
<br>
In a recent interview with the US radio DJ Howard Stern, Bruce 
Springsteen talked about his prodigious songwriting output. “I don’t 
have something to say every day,” Springsteen said in a wide-ranging 
conversation that also covered selling his back catalogue for $500 
million (“it was a timing thing”), the prospect of retirement (“I can’t 
imagine it”) and memories of the E Street Band’s late saxophonist 
Clarence Clemons. “I don’t go into a room at 11 o’clock and write till 
three or something like that. I wait for the songs to come,” he said.<br>
<br>
We can only assume that the songs have not been coming, because 
Springsteen is making his grand return with an album of covers, most of 
them soul classics from the Sixties and Seventies. The appeal is in the 
way he uses songs that — in being straight-talking anthems about love, 
joy and pain that are driven above all else by feeling — have a lot in 
common with his own material. The result is a new place for 
Springsteen’s trademark throaty, impassioned roar to inhabit, and it 
fits him like a glove. The downside is that it makes you wonder if 
Springsteen, having reached 73 with no intention of retiring but still 
putting his financial affairs in order, could ever write another song as
 good as these in the time he has left on this earth.<br>
<br>
Take Hey, Western Union Man, a US No 1 in 1968 for Chicago’s Jerry “The 
Ice Man” Butler, which captures everything great about soul: a simple 
message, in this case Butler imploring the Western Union man of the 
title to send a telegram to his baby and save him from acute loneliness,
 allied to a tune that makes you want to sing along and dance. Then 
there is I Forgot to Be Your Lover by William Bell, whose rootsy, 
country soul style contributed to the trademark sonic warmth of 
Memphis’s Stax Records. Springsteen has enough sympathy for the song to 
pull out the regret, tinged with seduction, which lies at its smooth 
heart.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s full-throttle approach doesn’t always work so well, 
chiefly because delivery of these songs has to be believable above all 
else. 7 Rooms of Gloom is one of the jewels in the Four Tops’ crown, a 
bluesy, baroque masterpiece about the bleakness of solitude in an empty 
house after a split. Springsteen’s theatrical delivery is oddly 
unconvincing, perhaps because it is hard to believe he is living in 
seven rooms of gloom — 77 rooms of gloom, maybe.<br>
<br>
In the main, though, Springsteen’s latest is an appealing love letter to
 a glorious era of music when a simple sentiment, a sweet melody, a 
classy arrangement and, above all, a great voice were the essential 
ingredients for songs that spoke to everyday people. Obviously there is a
 degree of nostalgia to all this, not least because Springsteen has 
eschewed modern recording techniques for an authentic soul stew of clean
 guitar licks, harmonising backing vocals and symphonic strings, which 
sound like they were played for the most part live.<br>
<br>
It proves, during our current period of historic flux and uncertainty, 
to be reassuring; a valuable quality indeed. To hear the Boss give his 
all to Frank Wilson’s 1965 Motown belter Do I Love You (Indeed I Do) is 
to feel, against overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that life isn’t 
so bad after all. (Columbia</div>

Bruce Springsteen breaks down his Covers LP — and Responds to Fan Outrage Over Ticket Prices<br>
"I know it was unpopular with some fans," Springsteen says of his ticket
 prices. "But if there's any complaints on the way out, you can have 
your money back"<br>
<br>
BY ANDY GREENE<br>
NOVEMBER 18, 2022</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
SEVEN MINUTES BEFORE Bruce Springsteen is scheduled to call Rolling 
Stone to talk about his new R&amp;B covers album, Only the Strong 
Survive, a number I’ve never seen before from Point Pleasant Beach, New 
Jersey pops up on my cellphone. This is usually the point where a 
manager or publicist conferences in the interview subject, but there’s 
just one person on the other end of the line. “Hey,” says a gruff, 
familiar voice. “It’s Bruce.”<br>
<br>
He’s wrapping up an exhausting couple of weeks in which he inducted 
Jimmy Iovine into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Los Angeles, played 
the annual Stand Up For Heroes veterans’ fundraiser in New York, flew to
 London to guest on the BBC and The Graham Norton Show, and still found 
time to make his debut appearance on The Howard Stern Show and shoot a 
two-night “takeover” of The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon where he 
played four tunes with a large band. He’s shared the story of how he cut
 Only the Strong Survive at his home studio in New Jersey to honor 
R&amp;B greats from the Sixties, Seventies, and Eighties, and explained 
why his longtime producer Ron Aniello handled much of the 
instrumentation on the album, letting Springsteen focus largely on his 
vocals.<br>
<br>
But there was still a lot left to talk about in our interview, including
 his next covers album, the E Street Band’s 2023 tour, future archival 
box sets, his online bootleg series — and the widespread and intense fan
 uproar that followed the high ticket prices on his tour and the use of 
dynamic pricing. We somehow crammed all of this into a 30-minute chat.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">So how did your Fallon week go?</strong><br>
<br>
It was fun. A lot of fun. I got to play in front of that big 20-piece band we put together. It was a mini-orchestra.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">I loved seeing you back with original E Street Band keyboardist David Sancious.</strong><br>
<br>
That was a treat. Davy flew in from Hawaii and sat in with us for the duration. We had a lot of fun together.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">I was watching that and thinking to myself, 
“What would have happened if David and [drummer] Ernest ‘Boom’ Carter 
had stayed in the band? What would Born To Run, Darkness, and The River 
have sounded like if they had been on them?” I just can’t imagine those 
records without Roy Bittan and Max Weinberg, but it would have happened.</strong><br>
<br>
It would have happened. Boom started out as a jazz drummer, really, but 
very, very quickly picked up his rock &amp; roll chops due to the fact 
that he was put in extreme pressure when he got in the band.<br>
<br>
The way it happened was [drummer] Vini Lopez left the band and we had a 
gig the next night. I had to play it, because it was a mob-owned club 
[laughs]. They were throwing some impolite suggestions in our direction 
about what they’d do if we didn’t show up.<br>
<br>
That night, David said, “I’ve got a friend named Boom.” And so Boom 
comes over, spends the entire night from midnight to morning learning 
the entire set. We then drive to Fort Dix and play at the Satellite 
Lounge at 11 p.m. and then 2 a.m. in the morning. That was Boom’s 
induction by fire. After that, he always swung…but he always grabbed 
enough of a rock edge to make that work.<br>
<br>
And he would have worked. It would have worked. But the band might have 
swung in a slightly different way and been more comfortable with the 
sound of the music we played last night at Fallon, probably.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Getting to the new record, you’ve said you 
originally recorded an entire different record that you decided not to 
release. Were those also soul and Motown songs, or were you 
experimenting with a different genre at that point?</strong><br>
<br>
It started out with me just saying, “I’ve written songs. I’ve made 
movies. I’m sitting here in the house. I like to record. Let me go 
record songs that I love and hope to record well.” I told my producer 
Ron [Aniello], “Ron, I want to make a record where I only sing.” And 
beside playing a little guitar here and there, and making some keyboards
 on occasion, I pretty much only sang.<br>
<br>
Ron was in charge of putting the tracks together, which he does 
fabulously. And we turned the music into rock and soul music. I 
basically have a rock voice with soul undercurrents. But we were looking
 for songs we could just push a little bit in the rock direction. And 
then, of course, we wanted songs that had great singers, and were 
beautiful songs.<br>
<br>
I did have a record previously that I made of me singing other people’s 
songs that wound up on the floor. It wasn’t until I discovered “Do I 
Love You (Indeed I Do)” by Frank Wilson, the Motown rarity, and my voice
 slipped in perfectly that I realized, “I should be singing soul music.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">You’d never done any of these songs before live in concert. Tell me about the song selection process.</strong><br>
<br>
“Do I Love You” I found just looking into Northern Soul compilations, 
because I knew Northern Soul compilations choose a lot of offbeat rhythm
 and blues and Motown records. I was looking to make a record that had 
some classics on it, but also things that people may not have heard so 
the record sounded fresh to people’s ears. And so I chose [songs like 
Dobie Gray’s 2001 single] “Soul Days.”<br>
<br>
“Nightshift” was a big hit, but it was 1985. All these songs were hits, 
but it was 50 years ago. I figured a good part of my audience might not 
know some of this music or these artists. I wanted a chance to sing 
these songs myself and re-introduce this music to the current cultural 
environment. I chose ones I liked at the end of the day, and what I can 
sing well.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Were you trying to avoid super iconic songs like “My Girl” and “Dancing in the Streets” that you still hear everywhere today?</strong><br>
<br>
I thought about doing both of those. I actually recorded “My Girl.” My 
attitude is, “The reason everyone knows this song is because it’s a 
great, great song. If I can strip away the part that people have gotten 
used to and just make a great record out of it again, people will hear 
that song in a fresh way.”<br>
<br>
When that works, we put it on the record. When that doesn’t work, it 
goes to the floor. So “What Becomes of The Brokenhearted,” which was a 
huge hit a couple of times, but we just had a really good performance of
 it, went on the record. “I Wish It Would Rain,” you’ve gotta be nuts to
 try and sing that song after David Ruffin sang it [laughs]. But I found
 my own little part of it, and I found my place in it, and it was such a
 beautiful, beautiful song. I found the hurt and the center of human 
emotion in it. I just felt great. It came out great, so we used it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">You’re really showing the full breadth of 
the Motown catalog and the Gamble and Huff catalog and all the other 
R&amp;B from that era. By the Eighties and Nineties, it was cut down to 
just a handful of hits you’d hear on oldies radio. Many people that 
didn’t grow up in the Sixties and Seventies have no idea just how many 
other great songs from this time are out there.</strong><br>
<br>
Most people probably wouldn’t even know “Only the Strong Survive.” It 
was a big hit. Elvis covered it. And certainly songs like “Soul Days,” 
“I Forgot to Be Your Lover” or “Hey, Western Union Man.” These are songs
 are that people, for the most part, won’t be that familiar with.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">When I first read the credits, I was pretty 
shocked to see that Ron Aniello was playing most of the instruments. I 
had no idea he was capable of basically being a one-man Funk Brothers.</strong><br>
<br>
He’s a genius musician. Ron Aniello is a genius musician. He goes 
totally under the radar. He lives here and works with me. I’m the 
luckiest guy in the world. I have him and [engineer] Rob Lebret, who is 
also a local guy. He’s just great at what he does. We got a three-man 
factory here [laughs]. We can do just about anything. I have tremendous 
freedom, because you couldn’t have a band standing around while we go 
through 30 songs, testing each one to see which one is going to work 
really well.<br>
<br>
And we get a beautiful, near-analog sound on the instruments. For the 
first time, we mixed the record right here in-house, which I’ve never 
done since 1984. It’s a tremendous freedom here in the studio. It allows
 me to go anywhere and do anything at any time.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">One might think you’d want the E Street Band
 to record these types of songs, but I guess you’re saying that wouldn’t
 have worked with this setup.</strong><br>
<br>
Getting the E Street Band together is a bit of a project right now. We 
did it for Letter To You, but that was four days. Everybody has lives. 
They act, they produce, they tour on their own. They have schedules. 
It’s possible, but it’s not quite as easy. Also, I don’t like to gather 
the band today, unlike 30 years ago, if I don’t know what I’m doing. I 
need to figure that out first.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bringing in Sam Moore is pretty cool. It’s incredible that he’s pushing 90 and can still sing like that.</strong><br>
I’ve known Sam for 30 years. He sang on the Human Touch record, on “Real
 World” and “Soul Driver.” He’s the greatest high harmony, high tenor 
I’ve ever heard in my life. When we sing on anything together, it’s just
 incredible. He’s probably the greatest living soul singer right now.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
Did this project give you an even greater respect for the craftsmanship 
of these Motown songs? By deconstructing them and re-building them, I’m 
sure you heard them in a very different way.</strong><br>
<br>
It just brings them back. These songs should be part of the American 
Songbook just like Gershwin and Cole Porter, these incredible songs from
 the Sixties and Seventies and Eighties. They should be current. They’re
 incredibly written. They’re beautifully written songs. They were 
amazingly recorded for their time, but you can really beef the 
recordings up now in a way you couldn’t in 1965 or 1970. You can get a 
full sound on these arrangements that gives them a lot of power. That’s 
what we’ve enjoyed doing.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
I love the Frankie Valli song “The Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine Anymore.” Did you know his version, or the one by the Walker Brothers?</strong><br>
<br>
The funny thing is I didn’t know that Frankie Valli did that song. It’s 
an incredible song. Scott Walker, obviously, sings it. But there was an 
operatic part of my voice that I used on Born To Run and a little bit on
 Darkness, but then I put it away and just sang with more of a barman’s 
rock voice for the rest of my work life, for the most part. But on that 
song, I was able to bring it back again and really sing in that big, 
round tone that I love to use. I want to try and find more things I can 
sing with that tone since it’s a whole different sound.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">“Nightshift” is a really special song since 
you could tell it was written by people that really knew Marvin Gaye and
 Jackie Wilson. They’re singing to a friend.</strong><br>
<br>
Yeah. First of all, it’s an incredibly written song, once again. These 
guys knew those people. The Commodores had a huge hit with it right 
after Lionel Richie left the band. It was a huge smash. I loved it when 
it came out. I’ve listened to it year after year since then. It would 
always bring tears to my eyes. I thought to myself, “I’ve got to cut 
‘Nightshift,'” because that’s just an incredible piece of music.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">There are guys like Jerry Butler and William
 Bell and Walter Orange from the Commodores who are still alive and 
really deserve such a bigger spotlight. You’re giving it to them here.</strong><br>
<br>
It’s nice to be able to do that. I got into Jerry Butler over the past 
six months in a way I had never before. I realized what a great singer 
and stylist he was. But all these artists should have second, third, 
fourth, fifth, sixth lives. These are records that should be popular 
forever. For me, it was just fun to do. It was just a project of pure 
pleasure.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
I’m hearing parts of your voice I hadn’t really heard before. Do you 
think that not screaming in front of a loud rock band all these years 
has given your voice a rest and allowed you to do new things with it?</strong><br>
<br>
That’s interesting. I don’t know. Generally, my voice has stayed strong 
and not given me any problems for 50, 60 years now. Unless I get sick, 
that’s the only time my voice gets funky. But not singing really hard 
and heavy might have given me a little extra range in this break. That’s
 possible. But also, it’s interesting music. It’s usually so mild during
 the verse, and then when the chorus hits, the singers push a little 
harder and get a little dirt and grit in their voices, like on “Turn 
Back the Hands of Time.”  It was interesting, when we were performing on
 the Fallon show, I was like, “Oh my God, I’m not pushing hard enough.” 
But I was. It was just that the music was demanding to be performed and 
sung differently. I didn’t realize it since I hadn’t performed it much 
until I got there and began to sing it. It was a real learning 
experience singing with the big band on Fallon. It was a lot of fun.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">You put together a whole band for Fallon 
you’ve never worked with before. Did you think to yourself at any point,
 “I should play a full show with these people?”</strong><br>
<br>
It’s like the Seeger Sessions band. It’s a band that good. It’s got 
great people in it. Eventually I’ll do more with them because it was so 
enjoyable.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">This project is called Covers Volume I. That really invites the question: Is a Volume 2 coming?</strong><br>
<br>
Volume 2, I would say, is probably three-quarters recorded.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What genre are you tackling on that one?</strong><br>
<br>
It’s very similar. I continued working in soul music because I was just 
having so much fun. But I thought of doing a series of these records in a
 variety of different genres with songs that I love. That’s because in 
the moment, I’m not writing. I might not write in a while. That’s very 
normal for me. I had that great output that happened during Letter To 
You. I always know after something like that happens, I might not write 
for a while. But this time, I don’t have to sit around, and fans don’t 
have to wait four years for me to make another record. I have a chance 
to record regularly, if I feel like that. And actually I’m looking 
forward to doing that in a little bit. When the writing comes, I’ll be 
ready for it.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">So you might change genres soon and try out British Invasion songs or something like that?</strong><br>
<br>
Yeah. I would love to do country music. I would love to do one record of
 country music. I would love to do a rock record. There’s just so many 
different things, and all focused around my voice, all focused around 
how well I’m singing. I’d really like to use this time when I’m not 
writing to really focus on my vocals.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">You haven’t played a full rock concert in nearly six years now. Are you itching to get back onstage in February?</strong><br>
<br>
Oh yeah. Definitely! Love the E Street Band. Can’t wait to get onstage 
with them. Come 2025, it’ll be 50 years together. Those are my guys, 
greatest band I’ve ever played with. We do something that’s totally 
unique. I’m extremely excited to see Max behind me again and Roy on the 
keyboard and Garry [Tallent] on the bass and Steve [Van Zandt] to my 
side and Nils [Lofgren] to my side and Patti…everybody there. It’s going
 to be a great, great time.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">You’re bringing a horn section and backup singers on this tour?</strong><br>
<br>
Yeah, so we can cover some of this stuff also.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
So it’ll be the same gang from 2014, with Ed Manion and Curtis King and those people?</strong><br>
<br>
Pretty much. There may be a few different people, but it’s pretty much those people.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Are you going to do Western Stars songs?</strong><br>
<br>
I might do one, but the E Street Band is going to come out and put on a 
rock show. That’s what people want to see. That’s what I want to play. 
And that’s what it’s going to be.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
The last time the band toured, some shows were over four hours long. 
Might that happen again, or are you going to trim it down a bit for this
 run?</strong><br>
<br>
That was by accident. That’s never a plan. I never tell the band, “We’re
 going to play four hours tonight.” They’d look at me like, “Oh my God.”
 That’s why when my voice is sick, they never like to see me take a 
steroid. They know I’m going to go insane to where three and a half 
hours feels like nothing and I just keep going. But I’m expecting the 
show to run somewhere near three hours.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
Are you thinking yet about the setlist? I know it always changes, but I mean the basic structure?</strong><br>
<br>
Yes. I made a setlist. I sent it out to the band. We will do it on the 
first day of rehearsal. It’ll change by the second day [laughs].<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Are you going to start rehearsals in January?</strong><br>
<br>
Correct.  I’m sure opening night will be really cathartic. It’s just 
been so damn long. This is the longest break since the group was on 
hiatus in the Nineties. It’s going to be wonderful. I’m super excited 
about playing with the E Street Band again.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">I’ve got to ask you about the ticket on-sale.</strong><br>
<br>
Sure.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
It caused a bit of an uproar in the fan community because some of the 
tickets used dynamic prices, and some tickets hit $5,000. Did you know 
in advance about those price points and dynamic pricing, and do you have
 any regrets about that?</strong><br>
<br>
What I do is a very simple thing. I tell my guys, “Go out and see what 
everybody else is doing. Let’s charge a little less.” That’s generally 
the directions. They go out and set it up. For the past 49 years or 
however long we’ve been playing, we’ve pretty much been out there under 
market value. I’ve enjoyed that. It’s been great for the fans. This time
 I told them, “Hey, we’re 73 years old. The guys are there. I want to do
 what everybody else is doing, my peers.” So that’s what happened. 
That’s what they did [laughs]. But ticket buying has gotten very 
confusing, not just for the fans, but for the artists also. And the 
bottom line is that most of our tickets are totally affordable. They’re 
in that affordable range. We have those tickets that are going to go for
 that [higher] price somewhere anyway. The ticket broker or someone is 
going to be taking that money. I’m going, “Hey, why shouldn’t that money
 go to the guys that are going to be up there sweating three hours a 
night for it?”  It created an opportunity for that to occur. And so at 
that point, we went for it. I know it was unpopular with some fans. But 
if there’s any complaints on the way out, you can have your money back.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">As you said, the fans were pretty upset. 
Backstreets said it caused them to suffer a “crisis of faith.” They 
wrote an op-ed where they said that dynamic pricing “violates an 
implicit contract between Bruce Springsteen and his fans.” How did you 
feel about all that blowback against you?</strong><br>
<br>
Well, I’m old. I take a lot of things in stride [laughs]. You don’t like
 to be criticized. You certainly don’t like to be the poster boy for 
high ticket prices. It’s the last thing you prefer to be. But that’s how
 it went. You have to own the decisions you have made and go out and 
just continue to do your best. And that was my take on it. I think if 
folks come to the show, they’re going to have a good time.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
Do you think in the future you’ll avoid using dynamic pricing, where the
 prices change in front of your eyes during the initial on-sale?</strong><br>
<br>
I don’t know. I think in the future, we’ll be talking about it, of 
course [laughs]. It changes from tour to tour. We will be coming back. 
I’m sure we’ll be playing outside somewhat. That’ll be a whole other 
discussion when that comes around. I don’t want to say anything now, but
 we’ll see what happens.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">To move on, I’ve read a lot of rumors about a
 sort of Tracks 2 box set with a bunch of your unreleased albums on it. 
Are you planning that?</strong><br>
<br>
Yes. I have a box set of five unreleased albums that are basically 
post-1988. People have always wondered…People look at my work in the 
Nineties and they go, “The Nineties wasn’t a great decade for Bruce. He 
was kind of doing this and he wasn’t in the E Street Band…” I actually 
made a lot of music during that period of time. I actually made albums. 
For one reason or another, the timing wasn’t right or whatever, I didn’t
 put them out.<br>
They’ve kind of gathered. I spent time over one of the past winters 
completely cleaning out the vault. I have a series of Tracks albums that
 eventually we’ll release. Some of it is older stuff that the band plays
 on, and some of it is newer stuff where I was conceptualizing during 
that period of time. It’ll give people a chance to reassess what I was 
doing during that time period. Also, a lot of the stuff is really weird.
 There’s going to be people that really…I can’t wait to see the response
 to some of it [laughs].<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">I’ve been reading about this mythical drum-loop album for years.</strong><br>
<br>
That’s going to be as weird as people think it’s going to be [laughs]. 
But it uses all drum loops and things like that, and it uses 
synthesizers. I like the record myself. But the first thing we’re 
putting out is a series of albums. It’s going to be so interesting to 
see the fan response because I love them all.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
Do you know when that’s coming?</strong><br>
<br>
I can’t say. I can’t give a release date because obviously there’s this record. Let me say, it’ll be in the near future.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">I’ve heard rumors of a Born in the USA box set. Are you working on that, too?</strong><br>
<br>
No [laughs]. I have not done anything on a Born in the USA box set. 
First of all, what people need to understand is that most of the Born in
 the USA great outtakes are out there on Tracks 1. The Born in the USA 
stuff we have left either isn’t very good or there isn’t any of it. I’m 
not sure which. We’re hoarding no secrets. Unfortunately, the Born in 
the USA tour was not filmed very well either. This is simply where we 
have a paucity of material ourselves. But we’ll look into it. When the 
time comes around, we’ll see what’s there. But I don’t see a big Born in
 the USA box set like there was with Darkness or The River. I’m not sure
 if we simply have that in our vaults.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Are you doing anything with Nebraska? I’ve heard some pretty amazing bootlegs with different versions of those songs.</strong><br>
<br>
Nebraska has a variety of different types of outtakes. Maybe something 
will get put together around that. I have some ideas I’d like to see. 
That’s a possibility. There’s a Nebraska book coming out. I don’t know 
if I’m blowing someone’s book release. At any rate, I don’t want to blow
 someone’s book release. But I know someone has been working on a book 
about just that album. That’s in the future also.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
I’ve heard these great bootlegs of Nebraska where you hear the pages 
turning in your notebook as you sing the songs. They’re all pretty rough
 with different lyrics. I think a lot of fans would find that 
fascinating.</strong><br>
<br>
Oh. I guess people like some of that. Myself, I’m not a big, “Let me 
hear the song six ways to Sunday.” I like the hear the song the way it 
was finished. The box sets with ten million versions of one song, I 
don’t listen to them. But maybe I’m a different kind of listener. I’m 
sure someone is looking into Nebraska to see what’s there. If something 
is there, we’ll put it out.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">You’re putting out a concert bootleg every month online. Do you play any role in picking those?</strong><br>
<br>
I have a team of people [laughs]. I see it and sort of go, “OK, that’s 
good. That’s good. That’s good.” I see it, but I’m not actively putting 
that together myself.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
There’s not much there pre-1975. Are you opposed to them putting out 
anything by Steel Mill or the Bruce Springsteen Band or that real early 
stuff?</strong><br>
<br>
Not really. If they can find something pre-’75… I wouldn’t mind them 
putting out some Steel Mill shows. They’re not going to sound great, but
 you’ll certainly get an idea of what I was whacking away at at the 
time. I’ll look into it. If there’s some good Steel Mill shows, I’ll get
 them to put some out.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
A big Human Touch/Lucky Town box set would be cool, too. It would be great to revisit that era and hear the songs in new ways.</strong><br>
<br>
With Human Touch and Lucky Town, once again, those were the songs that I
 had. There may be a few outtakes not from Lucky Town, but from Human 
Touch. But I don’t think we have box sets on those records. Those 
records kind of what they are.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">I’ll wrap up here, but I’m really looking forward to this tour. It’s long overdue.</strong><br>
<br>
Yeah. I’m really looking forward to it myself. We’re going to have a lot of fun.</div>

<em class="text-italics">Decades after its release, the haunted highways
 and haunted characters of the Boss’s largely acoustic masterpiece still
 haunt the American psyche</em><br>
<br>
By Elizabeth Nelson  Dec 14, 2022, 11:32am EST<br>
<br>
It is not an exaggeration to say that an entire way of American life died in 1981.<br>
<br>
Ronald Reagan’s summary dismissal of the striking PATCO—the union of 
federal air traffic controllers—was a shot directly across the bow fired
 at working people with the temerity to organize. A footnote to history 
at this juncture, but a prophecy in the moment. The circumstance was 
complex—the union overreaching in their demands, Reagan philosophically 
draconian—but the net result meant the end of the modern labor movement 
as it had previously existed.<br>
<br>
Per labor historian Erik Loomis: “It had three massive impacts. First, 
it ended the great militant decade of public sector unionism that had 
begun with the 1970 postal workers strike and that had led to major 
strikes throughout the decade. Second, it gave space for private 
employers to bust their unions too—and the ‘80s was filled with 
companies breaking union contracts that had existed for decades. Third, 
it made unions scared to strike. The number of workers on strike each 
year plummeted after 1981 and has never recovered.”<br>
<br>
The punishments just kept coming for working people: NAFTA and wage 
stagnation, the opioid crisis and mass incarceration, the cold shoulder 
of a Democratic party too interested in courting Silicon Valley and 
suburban elites to remember their rank and file, and the false 
profiteering of Donald Trump. None of it was unforeseeable, or 
unavoidable. It’s just that, save for lip service, no one within the 
political class really cared. Watching the beginning of that long 
downward trajectory commence, Bruce Springsteen worked on Nebraska.<br>
<br>
“I Guess There’s Just the Meanness in This World”<br>
Notoriously on any short list of the bleakest LPs ever rendered by a 
major recording star near the apex of their commercial powers, Bruce 
Springsteen’s Nebraska turned 40 this year. The initial shock of its 
fathoms-deep menace remains undiminished, its major themes more resonant
 than ever. It’s a 40-minute recitation of corruption and violence which
 reimagines the to-live-outside-the-law-you-must-be-honest folk heroes 
of Bob Dylan’s John Wesley Harding as a promenade of pointlessly 
marauding psychopaths.<br>
<br>
<br>
Recorded almost entirely to a Tascam four-track, Nebraska is a stark 
vision of American degradation seen through the lens of a guilt-ridden 
lapsed Catholic grown prosperous as the world around him becomes less 
and less reasonable. Its central mystery feels in many ways unresolved: 
How did Springsteen get from the joyous automotive liberations of Born 
to Run to the hellscape highways of Nebraska in seven short years? Or 
was the distance really that far?<br>
<br>
Sprung from cages on Highway 9.<br>
<br>
I went out for a ride and I never came back.<br>
<br>
I killed everything in my path.<br>
<br>
“A Suicide Rap”<br>
There isn’t, so far as I’m aware, a psychological term for convincing 
yourself that you love a thing you actually hate. But say for example 
you are surrounded by something all your life, surrounded so much that 
it invades your synapses and defines your personality from infancy. It 
is noisy and crowded and polluted and then it is lonely and empty and 
then noisy and crowded again. It is inescapable, and it is the escape—an
 unresolvable paradox. You internalize this as a means of survival—you 
celebrate it!—but on some fundamental level, it’s destabilizing. As much
 as Lou Reed’s downtown or David Bowie’s outer space, Springsteen’s 
highways map his music in forensic detail.<br>
<br>
<br>
In his 2016 autobiography Born To Run, Springsteen tells a strange story
 about a visceral disturbance from his early 30s. It’s shortly after the
 release of Nebraska. He’s signed up for a cross-country road trip with 
his buddy Matt Delia, a childhood friend, car repairman, poet, and 
frequent fellow traveler. A ‘69 Ford XL tricked out with every manner of
 delightfully garish shit. Springsteen’s so psyched he’s made bespoke 
mix tapes for every region they’ll pass through: Chuck Berry for the 
Midwest, Professor Longhair for the Delta, etc.<br>
<br>
Things start out OK enough, but the experience is not what Springsteen 
was hoping for. For one thing, his stalwart running buddy Matt has 
recently experienced a painful break-up and is riding disconcertingly in
 the passenger seat clutching a teddy bear. It’s apparent from the book 
that the stuffed toy freaks Springsteen out profoundly, but it isn’t 
totally obvious why.<br>
<br>
Heading further west, things get weirder. Springsteen writes: “As we 
cross the Mississippi and venture into Texas, it’s beginning to feel a 
little… wide open… out here.” He wrestles away the teddy bear from Matt 
and hides it in the trunk. Bruce is days away from a full nervous 
breakdown. The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense.<br>
<br>
“This Turnpike Sure Is Spooky at Night When You’re All Alone”<br>
In sonic terms, the principle dissonance is not what is present, but 
what is absent. Nebraska is the sound of a guy who always rolls with a 
crew, showing up all by himself and not in a good state. Usually he’d be
 boasting and strutting and capering for his boys, as they confidently 
shred and peacock behind him. Instead he’s rambling about traffic stops 
and state police and industrial skylines.<br>
<br>
<br>
Countless miles from the overstuffed banquets of Greetings From Asbury 
Park or The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle, Nebraska’s 
songs are weird vignettes and character studies, half-captured dreams 
and hellish nightmares, rockabilly and rebel-folk like Sun Records had 
been born under CCR’s bad sign. Exit Roy Orbison, enter Raymond Carver.<br>
<br>
The creeping “State Trooper” is one of the most insinuating and 
frightening performances of Springsteen’s career: a plea from a 
homicidal criminal fruitlessly praying to avoid more carnage.<br>
<br>
“Mansion on the Hill” evokes a different sort of menace, that of the 
chilling effect of cyclical poverty and the experience of literally 
living in the shadows of those who have benefitted from the 
arbitrary-at-best auspices of upward mobility and material wealth. Album
 closer “Reason To Believe” is a half-reverential, half-ironic 
spiritual.<br>
<br>
The song “Nebraska” is an unvarnished retelling of the 1958 killing 
spree perpetrated by Charlie Starkweather which started in Lincoln, 
Nebraska, and stretched to Wyoming. These were the murders covered in 
Terrence Malick’s 1973 film Badlands, a cinematic forerunner to our 
contemporary vogue for artfully rendered scenarios of slaughter. Eleven 
dead on a murder spree, a 19-year-old misfit on a pitiless rampage of 
cruel umbrage. Familiar to us now, but shocking at the time. Some 
fucking white dude with a gun and a chip on his shoulder.<br>
<br>
<br>
Springsteen sings in the first person, from Starkweather’s perspective. 
It’s disturbing. All unhurried tempo punctuated by a stately harmonica, 
Springsteen-as-Starkweather is unrepentant for his actions, but he’s not
 raving mad either. He is deeply insane, but with dignity. The melody is
 plain, the roll call of violence nearly perfunctory. The two men merge 
together. The final revelation is apocalyptic:<br>
<br>
“They wanted to know why I did what I did/ Well, sir, I guess there’s just a meanness in this world.”<br>
<br>
I read a few books about Charlie Starkweather in the run-up to writing 
this piece. I was hoping to provide some journalistic or sociological 
context to the story. I didn’t really get very far. It was too 
depressing—especially after 14-year-old Caril Ann Fugate became 
involved. Starkweather was bullied as a child—was bow-legged and had a 
speech impediment—and kids can be so cruel.<br>
<br>
He became a fighter and loved the taste of fighting. He was not big but 
he was fierce, and some classmates came to fear him. The others regarded
 him with sympathy. He got along well with his parents and siblings, and
 while certain teachers found his outsized intensity and modest 
intellectual acuity concerning, no one thought he was a killer. He 
joined a street gang and fashioned himself after James Dean. He got 
weirder. Visions of violent death came to him in dreams. The Occam’s 
Razor conclusion is the most unsatisfying one: he just had worms in his 
brain. Some people do.<br>
<br>
But one detail stuck and bothered me. His first murder was the year 
before the spree in November of 1957. Starkweather became enraged with a
 service station attendant named Robert Colvert and ultimately murdered 
him with a shotgun after a brief struggle. The animating conflict was 
this: Colvert refused to sell Starkweather a stuffed animal on credit.<br>
<br>
“A Dead Man’s Town”<br>
What’s the option really? You exhaust yourself—every moment, every 
opportunity, overkill in every direction. You knock on every door, and 
then eventually every tour causes riots. The fortune teller said you’d 
be a star. She didn’t tell you how strange that would feel. Springsteen 
was simultaneously working on Born in the U.S.A. while he was working on
 Nebraska. They were two sides of the same coin, in the way in which 
that cliché is annoyingly true. The umbrage-filled bluster of one and 
the quiet violence of the other taken together are a prophetic nightmare
 vision of a contemporary America, which can’t tell the difference 
between an execution and a compliment.<br>
<br>
When the prophecy was fulfilled—when Bruce Springsteen became the 
biggest star in the world—he could hardly contain himself. Ten million 
Springsteen fans can’t be wrong. Some kind of self-destructive grenade 
loomed. He recounts in his memoir:<br>
<br>
<br>
“I could be very dangerous [behind the wheel]. I would use speed and 
recklessness to communicate my own rage and anger, with the sole purpose
 of terrorizing my rider.”<br>
<br>
In a weird way this is a quote that doubles as an ultimate summation of 
his career. The relationship between Springsteen and his audience is as 
moving and unhealthy as rock has ever had on offer. Nebraska was a low 
confidence vote in a country that simultaneously made him rich and made 
him doubt everything. His doubt was ratified as the working poor were 
increasingly marginalized, city by city, union by union, one canceled 
promise following the rest. Of course this would turn out to be the 
guilt-driven fracture on the disjunctive avenues he was rockily 
treading. How many roads does a man speed down? The answer, my friend, 
is pissing in the wind.<br>
<br>
“Well They Blew Up the Chicken Man in Philly Last Night”<br>
Phil Testa died when a nail bomb exploded beneath his porch in March 
1981. He was the boss of the Philadelphia mob family, having succeeded 
Angelo Bruno, who had been killed by his own consigliere Antonio 
Caponigro. Now Testa had too been murdered by an underboss, Pete 
Cassella, in an attempted coup. A tidy legacy if not an elegant one. 
Testa was called “the Chicken Man,” ostensibly for his legitimate 
involvement in the poultry industry, and consider what a terrible, 
chilling nickname that is. “I want to see the Chicken Man!” exclaimed no
 cherubic, mirth-filled child ever, in the way they might Santa Claus or
 Goofy. The very idea of the Chicken Man jangles some terrifying place 
in the consciousness where we house Grimm’s Fairy Tales and David 
Cronenberg movies.<br>
<br>
Like “I Heard It Through The Grapevine’’ or “Pretty Vacant,” “Atlantic 
City” is a song that sounds scared of what it knows. Four minutes of 
nervous reportage and pointlessly forensic detail, all jittery confusion
 and I-don’t-want-to-be-here cowardice.<br>
<br>
“Everything dies / baby that’s a fact / but maybe everything that dies 
someday comes back.” Every nightmare psychic alarm clock blaring in his 
head. The erratic father and the sainted, unknowable mother. The ties 
that do not bind. The memories which won’t stop returning. The delirium 
of grief that attends so much of his music. The he-won’t-let-you-go 
four-hour stage spectacles. The liminal space between Jersey’s most 
sainted son and the Chicken Man. A weird but not-inexplicable 
coincidence: they both want to be known as “the Boss.”<br>

<br>
THE TIMES OF LONDON<br>
JULY, 5 1985<br>
<br>
Richard Williams</strong><br>
<br>
London always gets something special from Bruce Springsteen. In 1975, 
when he was still a promising but marginal figure, it was where he found
 himself confronted for the first time by the hard sell that record 
companies sometimes inflict on their contracted artists. The lesson was 
taken to heart. On his return, six years later, he tore into Wembley 
Arena like a man bent on exorcism, as if London was where he had to 
prove to himself, and to the world, that he had achieved success without
 compromising the integrity that he works so hard to define, and by 
which he stands or falls.<br>
<br>
On Wednesday evening, in the vastness of Wembley Stadium, he chose a 
rare moment of calm towards the end of his three-hour concert to remind 
his 72,000 listeners of the importance he attaches to that historic 
relationship. It was one of several signs that, despite his new status 
as the tabloid newspapers’ favourite pop sensation, he continues to 
respond primarily to the whisper of his conscience.<br>
<br>
There had, after all, been plenty of scope for doubt. Was Born in the 
USA not too calculated a simplification of his virtues? Who among his 
old admirers had not been dismayed by the announcement that his 1985 
British tour would consist only of stadium concerts? Could it not be 
said, in fact, that the past year had been the story of a sell far 
harder than anything attempted in 1975?<br>
<br>
Perhaps in pop music there are no alternatives. Perhaps the only thing 
to be is more popular than you were last year. At the end of the first 
hour on Wednesday, as Springsteen and the E Street Band took their 
customary break, the sun was bright, the temperature high and the crowd 
cheerful, yet for all but the few hundred crushed closest to the stage 
there was no feeling of true engagement at all.<br>
<br>
Only a brand-new song, a steel-braced road narrative called ‘Seeds‘, had
 illuminated a set otherwise deficient in surprise and zest. No, this 
was just another rock ‘n’ roll picnic, just another hot ticket. It was 
like Wimbledon: you see more on the television, and you don’t get your 
pocket picked.<br>
<br>
Then the second half began and, as the shadow of the stadium rim crept 
across the field, he began to enfold us in his magic. Where even 
‘Thunder Road’ had sounded coarse and perfunctory, now ‘Hungry Heart’ 
and ‘Rosalita’ shouted their joy to the darkening sky. Prefaced by a 
heartfelt retelling of his old Elvis story, the first batch of encores 
came and went in a rush. For the final gallop, ending with ‘Twist and 
Shout’, he was joined by his former lieutenant, Steve Van Zandt, whose 
humorous presence had been missed.<br>
<br>
Now the promise was being fulfilled, the contract kept, the stadium 
reduced to the dimensions of a club. Now even those in the far distance 
could forget the way the ropy sound lagged behind the image on the great
 video screens. But - bigger? louder? brighter? - what happens next?</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen: Magic album review <br>
The Times of London<br>
Victoria Segal<br>
<br>
September 29, 2007</strong><br>
<br>
A new Bruce Springsteen album is always an event, and Magic, his first 
with the E Street Band since The Rising, is no exception. It’s not, of 
course, the kind of event that you would dress up for: best instead you 
pull on something checked and work-worn and listen to songs that ring 
with a hard-earned truth. <br>
<br>
After We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions and The Rising’s 
meditations on 9/11, if Springsteen was any more elder statesmanlike he 
would be off signing the Treaty of Versailles. Admittedly, Magic can be a
 little obvious: diner waitresses, long journeys home by the glow of the
 radio’s dial and men called Sal all appear. Yet there is a grandeur and
 intensity here that strikes home immediately, Springsteen’s lyrics 
carried along by the tidal instincts of musicians who have worked 
together for decades. Springsteen could make a drive to the dry cleaners
 sound like the Great American Roadtrip. Sure enough, Magic begins with 
Radio Nowhere and a man lost in the dark of the “American night”. 
“Driving through the misty rain/ Searchin’ for a mystery train/ Tryin’ 
to make a connection to you,” he sings, and Magic is all about these 
missed connections and missed chances, the sense of dislocation that 
comes when love and morality spin out of control. <br>
<br>
His manager, Jon Landau, has said that this is not a political record – 
aside from Devil’s Arcade, a lament from a soldier’s wife – but 
Springsteen is drawn to express the heart’s turmoil in terms of global 
chaos. Last to Die uses the fiery language of regime change to discuss 
domestic meltdown; Long Walk Home, fuelled by Clarence Clemons’s 
saxophone, sounds like classic small-town angst, but there is an odd 
ambiguity to the courthouse flag and the neighbours on the street. 
Elsewhere, Girls in Their Summer Clothes is a masterpiece of regret, 
while I’ll Work For Your Love mixes the sacred and profane like a 
whiskey sour. <br>
<br>
You could bite these songs as though you were testing a coin – not one 
feels counterfeit. As he sings on Radio Nowhere, he is “spinning round a
 dead dial, just searching for a world with some soul”. It is a lot to 
ask but once again, Springsteen does his best to fill that void.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen: Western Stars review – His most radical and best album in years<br>
By structuring the music around an orchestra, there is a remarkable freshness to his sound<br>
<br>
<br>
Fri Jun 7 2019<br>
<br>
Joe Breen<br>
<br>
The Irish Times<br>
<br>
Western Stars<br>
    <br>
Artist: Bruce Springsteen<br>
Genre: Singer / Songwriter<br>
Label: Columbia</strong><br>
<br>
If there's one thing we know about Bruce Springsteen, it is that he 
likes, nay needs, to keep control. So this is his take on what is his 
most radical and arguably his best album for some time:&nbsp;"This 
record is a return to my solo recordings featuring character-driven 
songs and sweeping, cinematic orchestral arrangements."<br>
<br>
It is hard to argue with that precis. As the bulk of his songs are 
character-driven, the "solo" reference may be to the classic Nebraska 
(1982), while the reference to orchestral backing could be traced 
further back to 1973's The Wild, the Innocent and the E-Street Shuffle 
and the ballad New York City Serenade. That string score was written by 
the then departing pianist David Sancious who, interestingly, returns 
for Western Stars.<br>
<br>
The “cinematic” arrangements leave no room for the E-Street Band and 
though Springsteen is set to record and tour a new album with them later
 this year, I’d have my doubts. Springsteen is 70 in September and last 
year in his acclaimed Broadway solo show, based on his riveting 
biography, he seemed to signal farewell to the songs that had 
soundtracked his career since the early 1970s. They were his past. It 
was time for something different.<br>
<br>
This required a new approach, if only to escape what had become 
predictable. By structuring the music around an orchestra, he has 
achieved a remarkable freshness. It is important to stress that the 
orchestral setting, executed with invention and subtlety, is integral to
 almost all 13 tracks. It is not mere ornamentation, though there are 
other key colours such as Marc Muller’s steel guitar and Sancious’s 
piano fills.<br>
<br>
Springsteen has also said that the new songs were influenced by southern
 Californian pop of the late 1960s and early 1970s. And he is true to 
his word. Those old enough will recognise the influence of Burt 
Bacharach and Glen Campbell while Springsteen's nuanced vocals carry 
some of the drama and emotional heft of Roy Orbison or the Walker 
Brothers.<br>
Highways and desert spaces<br>
<br>
A press release stated that the album contained a "range of American 
themes, of highways and desert spaces, of isolation and community and 
the permanence of home and hope". Again all true to a point. All these 
characters are old, male and solitary, many of them refugees from a past
 nursing hurt and guilt. They live lonely peripatetic lives on the 
margins, drawn by the road seeking solace and meaning, what Tim Hardin 
once called "a reason to believe".<br>
<br>
Perhaps with his own fragile mental health in mind, the writer’s empathy
 with their vulnerability hits home. The 13 songs are also remarkably 
cohesive in tone with the exception of Tucson Train, a catchy if 
standard tune from another era and the Tex-Mex lite Sleepy Joe’s Cafe.<br>
<br>
All of the characters in his new songs are old, male and solitary, many of them refugees from a past nursing hurt and guilt.<br>
<br>
The rest promise to become, plus or minus, key stories in the 
Springsteen meta-narrative including the ostensibly friendly opener 
Hitch-Hikin’. Melancholy ballads dominate without ever becoming 
overbearing. The haunting title track (“I wake up in the morning, just 
glad my boots are on…”) follows the restless The Wanderer and leads to 
Drive Fast (The Stuntman).<br>
This brooding ballad of another (literally) broken character begins a 
run of eight tracks of varying excellence: Chasin’ Wild Horses, Sundown,
 Somewhere North of Nashville, Stones and the misleadingly jaunty There 
Goes My Miracle are all about men who have taken the wrong option and 
lived to regret it, condemned to “drift from bar to bar here in lonely 
town” (Sundown).<br>
<br>
The penultimate Hello Sunshine could be an enticing shuffling piece of 
country-pop but seems darker and more personal. Finally, Moonlight Hotel
 closes with a measured reflection on the passing of time and a 
cinematic image of loss and redemption.<br>
<br>
 A fitting end.</div>

Bruce Springsteen- Soul Survivor<br>
<br>
By DAN MCLAUGHLIN</strong><br>
<br>
In November, Bruce Springsteen released Only the Strong Survive, his 
21st studio album. It is the second of those albums, following 2006’s We
 Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions, that contains no new original 
songs. Indeed, it is billed on the sleeve of the album as “Covers: Vol. 
1,” suggesting that more of the same is in the pipeline. Springsteen has
 been in the habit of releasing something every holiday season for some 
years now, putting out anniversary box sets with unreleased stuff from 
his vast archive, old concert releases, or side projects like 
Springsteen on Broadway in years when he has no new studio work to 
promote.<br>
<br>
In one sense, Only the Strong Survive is a bookend to The Seeger 
Sessions. The former album mined American folk and gospel, while the new
 album goes back to Sixties soul and R&amp;B sounds of Motown, Stax, and
 other black-music powerhouses of the era. Combine the two strains with 
basic garage-band guitar rock n’ roll, and you have the elements of the 
rich roots-rock Jersey Shore sound that has characterized Springsteen’s 
career. As before, Bruce approaches the source material with love and 
reverence. Only the Strong Survive includes only two pervasively covered
 standards (“What Becomes of the Brokenhearted” and “Don’t Play That 
Song”), filling the rest of the album with deeper cuts from artists such
 as the Four Tops, the Temptations, the Commodores, Ben E. King, the 
Supremes, and Frankie Valli. These are not obscure songs, many of them 
having been hits, but they are mostly not songs you have heard on the 
radio any time recently.<br>
<br>
The E Street Band is absent, other than some backing vocals by the 
band’s violinist, Soozie Tyrell, who was also part of the Sessions Band.
 Eighty-seven-year-old soul veteran Sam Moore of Sam &amp; Dave joins 
Bruce on backing vocals on a few tracks. Moore backed Springsteen on 
three songs on 1992’s Human Touch. His voice meshes so well with Bruce’s
 on this material in part because, when you hear them together, it is a 
powerful reminder that Springsteen’s longtime wingman Steve Van Zandt 
has spent his whole career singing in the style and tone of Sam Moore.<br>
<br>
The good news is that the resulting album is a pleasant listen, 
alternating between smooth soul and energetic uptempo tracks. Bruce is 
in fine voice, and the songs are professionally arranged around him. If 
you like Springsteen’s voice and you like this genre of music, you’ll 
enjoy the album. This is, however, missing the spark of originality that
 marked The Seeger Sessions. Then, Springsteen assembled a new band and 
put his own stamp on the old folk standards, even touring with the band 
to retool some of his own songs in folky arrangements. As we discussed 
in part two of the Political Beats episodes on Springsteen, the 2007 
Live in Dublin album contains some innovative reworkings of songs such 
as “Open All Night,” “Atlantic City,” “Blinded by the Light,” and 
“Growin’ Up.” There is no such creativity at work here: Bruce is just 
wallowing in nostalgia and singing songs he likes, and hopes you will 
like hearing him sing and bring back those memories. The album literally
 opens with the backing singers repeating “I remember.” Springsteen has 
chosen tracks that name-check Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding, Jackie Wilson, 
and other long-departed greats of the genre. This is a love letter to a 
time and its sound, rather than an attempt to breathe new life into old 
material.<br>
<br>
Nostalgia and imitation, of course, have always been a big part of the 
Springsteen experience. Bruce takes a lot of guff for being a rich rock 
star who playacts at being a workingman. In his autobiography and his 
Broadway show, he cops to this, saying he built his career writing about
 things he had “absolutely no personal experience” with: “I made it all 
up.” But this misses the point: The people plopping down hundreds of 
dollars a ticket for Springsteen concerts aren’t blue-collar and 
working-class people, but many of them are — like Bruce — the children 
of blue-collar and working-class people, the Boomer and Gen X 
white-collar workers who connect with songs about Bruce’s 
factory-working lunchpail-carrying dad and dying-industrial home town 
because that describes the world they, too, left behind. They got out 
while they were young.<br>
<br>
At 73, Springsteen can be forgiven for a certain amount of creative 
exhaustion and self-indulgence. This is the tenth of his studio albums 
released since he turned 50; by contrast, he released only eight albums 
in his 20s and 30s when he was writing songs in a gusher of musical 
catharsis. Some of the albums of the past two decades had something 
fresh to say, and others did not. Letter to You, his last E Street Band 
album, was released in 2020, and it was the best original Springsteen 
album since The Rising in 2002. While Letter to You was padded out with a
 few songs written as far back as the early 1970s, the best material on 
the album was newly written reflections on mortality. It followed 
Western Stars, released in 2019, which took a mellow solo detour into 
the sounds of the West. Maybe those were the last chapter of fresh ideas
 in the Springsteen songbook, but even if that proves the case, he was 
strong enough to survive.</div>

<br>
THE NATIONAL REVIEW<br>
By KYLE SMITH<br>
December 27, 2019 </strong><br>
<strong class="text-strong"><em class="text-italics"><br>
The Bard of authenticity salutes cheesy Seventies style.</em></strong><br>
<br>
<br>
In 1975, I was nine. Glen Campbell’s “Rhinestone Cowboy” was the first 
song I was ever obsessed with, the first 45-rpm single I ever bought. 
The price of a song then was 100 percent of my weekly income, which was 
one dollar. Costly, but worth it. As “Rhinestone Cowboy” was making its 
way to No. 1, which it reached on September 6, 1975, another single was 
sputtering on the charts. Released on August 25, Bruce Springsteen’s 
“Born to Run” didn’t do so well. It peaked at number 23. Victory for 
Glen Campbell.<br>
<br>
“Rhinestone Cowboy” sounds very much like 1975, and “Born to Run” 
doesn’t; it’s difficult to place. It doesn’t sound like the Sixties, 
Eighties, or Nineties either. It’s beyond the constraints of time. 
That’s one reason it’s an enduring classic, it still gets played on the 
radio, and is always a highlight of Springsteen’s fabled concerts. 
Springsteen looked beyond the moment and created timeless art. In the 
documentary on the making of Born to Run the album, there’s a priceless 
scene in which Springsteen is listening to one of the early mixes of 
“Born to Run,” and just for a few seconds it sounds like the Seventies. 
Springsteen winces. We’re all glad he cut out that interlude and made 
something that didn’t get stuck in 1975.<br>
<br>
Born to Run turned out to be one of the greatest rock albums ever made, a
 deathless slate of eight spellbinding, essential songs. Rock radio 
stations have been playing all eight for decades. Springsteen is an 
emperor of the stage who sells out stadiums and caused a frenzy when he 
took up residency in a Broadway theater for a year; Campbell, when he 
died a couple of years back, was semi-forgotten. His image forever 
adhered to the unfortunate tastes of the American masses in the Nixon 
era, when his hokey, meretricious, down-home cornball variety show The 
Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour was a top-20 television hit.<br>
<br>
And yet here is Springsteen covering “Rhinestone Cowboy” in the closing 
credits of his new documentary Western Stars, which he made to promote 
the album of the same name. Bruce hardly every sings others’ songs (it’s
 the only cover in the movie). He doesn’t sing this one with a smirk or a
 wink. Why did he choose this one to wrap up the movie? I think it’s a 
sly confession. Glen Campbell and Bruce Springsteen are not so far apart
 as they appear.<br>
<br>
One of these two men lived a reckless rock-and-roll life as though he 
expected never to see 40. The other was a relative Romney. As a British 
tabloid once put it, with delightful concision: “Glen Campbell’s dark 
side: Cocaine binges, booze addiction, three failed marriages and eating
 squirrel to stay alive.” Campbell had eight children with four women, 
one of whom he married when she was 15 (and pregnant by Campbell, who 
was 17). That’s straight out of “The River.” Campbell was more of a 
Springsteen character than Springsteen.<br>
<br>
At the time of “Rhinestone Cowboy” Campbell was a cocaine fiend. He was 
freebasing, too. Sometimes he would snort the white stuff while he had 
the Bible open on his table. In the Eighties, his relationship with 
Tanya Tucker was chaos; during his affair with her he busted up his room
 at the Plaza Hotel in New York and did $1,200 worth of damage. Tucker 
said he hit her so hard he knocked out two of her front teeth. In 1981, 
after a dispute on an airplane, he told an Indonesian gentleman, “I’m 
going to call my friend Ronald Reagan and bomb Jakarta.” Campbell became
 a born-again Christian and said he kicked the bad habits, but they 
kicked back. As late as 2003, he earned himself ten days in prison after
 being busted for drinking and driving in Phoenix. When asked his name, 
he said, “Glen Campbell, the Rhinestone Cowboy.” He insisted he wasn’t 
drunk but had merely been “over-served” via a Coke he did not know also 
contained rum. He tried to knee a cop in the thigh.<br>
<br>
Campbell’s songs (which he didn’t write) were not about desperation and 
woe, but his life was. For Springsteen it was the reverse; the darkness 
in his songs is strictly make-believe. This would have been obvious to 
anyone paying attention, but should you doubt it, I refer you to 
Springsteen on Broadway, in which Springsteen admits he made it all up, 
using the following words: “I made it all up.” He went to the movies and
 borrowed from features such as Thunder Road (1958) and Badlands (1973).
 In 1987, his album Tunnel of Love reflected frankly on his (brief, 
unwise) first marriage, to Julianne Phillips, and in his 1992 song 
“Better Days” he drops a reference to being “a rich man in a poor man’s 
shirt,” but for the most part what Springsteen has been doing his whole 
career is speak through fictional characters — gangsters and losers and 
Tom Joad. He never raced cars. He was never a street punk. He never saw 
the inside of a factory. “Standing before you is a man who has become 
wildly and absurdly successful writing about something about which he 
has had absolutely no personal experience,” he said in the Broadway 
show. How could it be otherwise? He’s been a rich man since his early 
twenties. He lives on a 380-acre estate in New Jersey, when he isn’t at 
his $60 million property in Benedict Canyon. His daughter is an 
equestrian. If Springsteen were being frank, “The River” would be about a
 Mississippi of money.<br>
<br>
No one should feel cheated, though. Springsteen is a creative artist, 
and he spent most of his career carefully refining his greatest 
creation: “Bruce Springsteen.” Seemingly an introspective, confessional 
writer, Springsteen was in reality more akin to a novelist or an actor. 
In the film Western Stars he talks about creating his “character” for 
the album — a faded cowboy actor who makes a living doing Haggar 
commercials and performing in rodeos. There’s been a load of 
compromisin’ on the road to his horizon.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s take on “Rhinestone Cowboy” brings it all back home: It’s a
 confession by a phony, a poser, a guy in sparkly fake gems who, far 
from working the rodeos, instead walks “the dirty sidewalks of 
Broadway.” Its author is neither a Westerner nor a cowboy, nor even 
cowboy-adjacent: Larry Weiss is a Jewish guy who grew up in Queens. Glen
 Campbell, the Arkansas country boy who grew up eating varmints, reached
 his zenith channeling the words of a New Yorker who wrote of yearning 
to make it big as a fake buckaroo. Everyone trying to make it in showbiz
 has an act; Springsteen is happy to admit that for many years 
authenticity was his act. His signature character may have been the 
turnpike desperado, but he is the Garden State version of the Rhinestone
 Cowboy.</div>

November 5, 2022<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
“ Jimmy Iovine has graduated from being the skinny Italian kid who 
changes the tape and hits the start and stop buttons on the recording 
machine to the skinny Italian kid at the console engineer on Born To Run
 and Darkness on the Edge of Town. I walk in the studio and Jon just 
says to me, ‘he told me he could do it.’ I asked him ‘what’s this kid 
doing at our mixing boards?’ But somehow, he did it, and on an 
engineer’s salary, he had parked outside the Record Plant, an orange 
Mercedes. Now, this was a moment when no one knew what the words 
Mercedes Benz meant to me. Jimmy knew. What else does Jimmy know? That 
afternoon, gets me in that honorable Mercedes Benz, and takes me on a 
little drive to Coney Island. On the way, he casually drops, “What’re 
going to do with that song, “Because The Night?”<br>
<br>
“Whattya mean? It’s an outtake, it’s unfinished.”<br>
<br>
“That’s what I mean. If you’re not gonna finish it…”<br>
<br>
[Bruce interjects defensively] “Yeah I am!”<br>
<br>
“What are you gonna do with it?” [Iovine says.] “I want to get Patti Smith to sing it.”<br>
<br>
Of course, with Jimmy’s guidance, Patti turns “Because The Night” into a
 huge Top Five hit record. Something that I could never have done 
because I didn’t have the guts to turn it into a love song as Jimmy 
[did.]<br>
<br>
Jimmy knows great songs and he knows who can sing them. He has one of 
the greatest guts for talent is one of the greatest sponges for learning
 I’ve ever met. Jimmy misses nothing. […] Trust your artists. Let them 
know. Hire the best people. Give them the reins. Don’t be intimidated by
 talent. Recognizing her talent is your talent. Jimmy is brave and 
smart. He turned his relationship with the great Dr. Dre into one of the
 greatest and most valuable partnerships in the music business. He 
trusted Dre’s vision and he recognized the power of hip-hop and its 
ability to conquer the culture.<br>
<br>
Now, of course as an entrepreneur, he tells me he told Dre, ‘We 
shouldn’t make sneakers, we should make speakers!” So they did. They 
made millions of them. Jimmy has the intelligence, the art, the soul, 
and the trust to understand his artists, to put them first, and to put 
the business of music in its proper perspective. It isn’t rocket 
science, except for the fact that pretty much no one else was doing it 
the way he did.<br>
<br>
He is an incredibly well-rounded, visionary executive. Jimmy never took 
off his fan shoes. You need to keep them on. I still get messages from 
him with Born To Run blasting in the background. Jimmy recognized that 
the chemistry in Jon and I’s relationship is the secret formula — not 
just for rock and roll magic but for rock and roll. What does Jimmy 
know? Jimmy knew everything important. So, Jim, all I can say is-<br>
<br>
Congratulations, little brother. <br>
<br>
Welcome to the Hall of Fame."</div>

<br>
<em class="text-italics">"When our band goes to a Holiday Inn, we step up in the world</em>," says Springsteen<br>
<br>
BY STUART WERBIN<br>
<br>
ROLLING STONE <br>
APRIL 26, 1973</strong><br>
<br>
NEW YORK — It’s more than a decade since John Hammond Sr. of Columbia 
Records signed Bob Dylan to a recording contract. Since then, Hammond 
has signed a number of other successes and, by his own admission, a 
number of “stiffs.” Now he has signed Bruce Springsteen, 23, of Ashbury 
Park, New Jersey, and Hammond says: “He’s much further along, much more 
developed than Bobby was when he came to me.”<br>
<br>
Much about Springsteen reminds people of Dylan — the slept-in 
appearance, foggy manner, the twang, the lyrics and the phrasing of his 
songs. It seems only natural that Hammond should have signed him. But to
 Bruce “. . . it was just plain weird.<br>
<br>
“I mean a couple of weeks ago I had just finished reading Dylan’s 
biography and now I find myself sitting in Hammond’s office with my 
beat-up guitar, and like the whole thing I’ve been reading about is 
about to happen to me. But what Mike was doing was even weirder.”<br>
<br>
Mike is Mike Appel, who with Jim Cretecos manages and produces Bruce. 
Appel and Cretecos’ previous teamwork includes the creation of a couple 
of gold singles for the Partridge Family. For Springsteen, the 
managerial strategy is to “. . . start at the top and work down.”<br>
<br>
“Mike is a funny guy,” said Bruce. “He’s like a real hyper, and he gets 
into the whole thing like playing the role. So I’m sitting in the corner
 with my old beat-up guitar, when all of a sudden Mike jumps up and 
starts hyping John Hammond. I couldn’t believe it. I had to start 
laughing. John Hammond told me later that he was ready to hate me. But 
he asked me to do a song, so I did ‘It’s Hard to Be a Saint in the 
City.’ “<br>
Despite the hype, Hammond signed him and Bruce moved from his free 
wheelin’ stage into phase two — exploitation. It worked like this:<br>
<br>
A member of the press would get a phone call from the publicity 
department at Columbia and be told he would receive an advance copy of a
 record by a new artist (not unusual), and after he had a chance to 
listen to it, President Clive Davis would appreciate a call to get his 
reaction (highly unusual).<br>
Meanwhile, visitors to the CBS Building encountered publicity personnel 
and suited executives alike greeting people with the question, “Hi . . .
 have you heard Bruce Springsteen yet?”<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is admittedly surprised by all the attention, but is 
showing no signs of stress. “Well, shit man, you know, what do I care, 
I’ll do anything once. If it works it works. But I don’t wanna be 
concerned with too much of what’s going on with promotion. That don’t 
seem so important to me, but it’s important to Mike. I trust whatever he
 does. Anyway it never seemed like I had it that bad before,” he 
laughed.<br>
<br>
“I’ll admit it seems a little weird the way these record company dudes 
operate. Seems like one dude says ‘hey everybody’s signing up geniuses 
this month. Genius is going to be good for business, we better lock one 
up fast.’ But as I say, I’ll do anything. I mean I have nothing else to 
do. I have nothing else to do at all.”<br>
<br>
Bruce was 13 when his hometown cousin in Freehold, New Jersey, showed 
him how to make the same music on the guitar that the Beachboys, the 
Shirells, Gary (US) Bonds, the Chiffons, and his other favorites were 
making on the radio. That was enough to alter his fantasy of becoming a 
baseball player to a fantasy of becoming a rock &amp; roll star.<br>
<br>
The new fantasy stuck, and long after his cousin had gone on to a 
non-musical career at Freehold Raceway, Bruce continued to do nothing 
but play music.<br>
<br>
“WELL, ACTUALLY, I did work as a gardener once, but that didn’t last too
 long, even though I guess it was the only real job I ever had. I did go
 to college once, too. Ocean County Community College. But one day I got
 called into the nuttiedoctor’s office, and remember this was before a 
lot of people were getting weird . . . . The shrink asked me what was 
the matter. So I told him nothing could possibly be the matter getting 
to hang around a fine place like that campus. But then he told me that 
students had been complaining about me. That’s what the dude said. Well I
 figured there was no use hanging around there so I split.”<br>
<br>
Bruce’s musical career has not been interrupted since. A brief army 
physical cleared him of military duty, “for reasons of weirdness,” and 
left him free to play bars and weddings, fronting for various groups, 
the most successful being a “Humble Pie-type band” called Steel Mill, 
which stayed together for a couple of years building a reputation in New
 Jersey, and the least successful being Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom, 
which featured everybody he knew who could play an instrument.<br>
<br>
Dr. Zoom died after only a couple of booms, which left Bruce to form the
 (ten-piece) Bruce Springsteen Band, which was more successful, but not 
by much. At 21, Bruce unplugged and set out on a solo acoustic career.<br>
<br>
His present band of brilliant unknowns was put together here and there 
at bars Bruce was playing. And now, by his own account, they’re living 
high off the hog. “When our band goes into a Holiday Inn we step up in 
the world. The beds are nice. They got color TV. I love those places. 
When we go there we know we’re gonna eat good and have a good time. I 
can’t understand why those places get such a bum rap.”<br>
Bruce’s only national exposure so far came via recording of his live 
performance broadcast over 53 FM stations as part of the debut of the 
King Biscuit Flower Hour.<br>
<br>
His recent week’s appearance at Max’s Kansas City, however, created 
quite the scene in the Big Apple. The house was packed by the time he 
walked on stage each night. People were crammed on each other’s laps. 
His sets ran close to an hour followed by an impatient demand for an 
encore, which, because of time, and because he was playing second bill 
to Biff Rose, he could not fullfill.<br>
Onstage, he projected a dirty sexual energy that rivaled the best of the
 established stars with whom he has been compared (Robbie Robertson, 
Richie Havens, Van Morrison), coupled with a loose, cavalier attitude.<br>
<br>
A number of distinguished guests not previously known to venture so far 
downtown showed up at Max’s, including Mrs. Ted Kennedy. “Yeah they told
 me Mrs. Kennedy was out there,” Bruce said. “But I found that hard to 
believe. I mean, I had to ask myself, what would she be out there for?”</div>
