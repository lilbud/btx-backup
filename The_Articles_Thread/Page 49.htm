Bruce Springsteen fans just love being bossed around<br>
Sydney Morning Herald<br>
February 16, 2014<br>
Neil McMahon</strong><br>
<br>
Long before their hero took to the stage in Melbourne on Saturday night,
 the Springsteen fans who call themselves the Bruce Buds were making 
plans in lands near and far. From Sweden to New Zealand, from New York 
to Hoppers Crossing, the people who make up one of rock music's most 
devoted fan bases were doing what they have done many times before: 
moving heaven and earth to give themselves one more night in the 
presence of the man they call The Boss.<br>
<br>
It doesn't matter where he's playing, if they can get there they will.<br>
<br>
''I stopped counting after I hit 250 shows,'' says Pamela Scerba, from 
New York, who first saw him at Madison Square Garden as a teenager in 
1980.<br>
<br>
Sonja Strandberg from Sweden is only 21 but has notched up 16 concerts, 
and is seeing eight of the 11 shows on this tour. ''It's the way he 
gives everything to his audience,'' she says. Strandberg's Bruce 
memories are more potent than most: twice he has picked her from the 
crowd to join him on stage for Dancing In The Dark, an echo of Courtney 
Cox in the famous film clip from 1984.<br>
<br>
Such moments are part of Springsteen lore, and no fans take the 
accumulated legends of a performer's career as seriously as the Bruce 
Buds. His concert set-lists are shared and scrutinised with forensic 
intensity, to discover which obscure album cut he has played, or for 
surprises such as his roof-raising opener in Perth: AC/DC's Highway To 
Hell.<br>
<br>
Two nights before the first Melbourne show, as his fans gathered at a 
pub in the city, what was obvious was not only their shared passion for 
the music, but the other joys they've found in a community spanning 
continents and generations.<br>
<br>
Jon Walsman, from Los Angeles, said: ''I've loved Bruce since I was 
about 13 and I love him more now because of the people I've met … the 
friendships that I have made with people across the globe. So I'm 
grateful to not only the music and the man, but also to all the people 
who've been so kind over the years.''<br>
<br>
Similar bonds have been forged locally: the organisers of the event, 
Michael Egan and Russ Barclay, first met through a shared love of St 
Kilda Football Club. Then they found they had something else in common. 
When Springsteen announced this tour, Barclay decided to emulate an idea
 well-established abroad.<br>
<br>
''I got a text from Russ saying why don't we do a meet-up of Bruce fans like they do in the UK?'' Egan says.<br>
<br>
The night attracted scores of fans, swapping tales from the road and eagerly anticipating this weekend's AAMI Park concerts.<br>
<br>
Among them: Eden Reiss, from Auckland, first among equals. On her hand 
was branded the number 1, signalling she was first in line last week, 
giving her the honour of being first through the gates in the race to 
the foot of the stage - the ''pit'' where the true loyalists gather at 
Springsteen's feet for his three-hour shows.<br>
<br>
Reiss says the coup was well-earned - she spent Tuesday alone outside 
the stadium to make sure she'd be front and centre. She first saw him as
 a kid in Germany in 1988; a spark was lit and she's seen him more than 
100 times since.</div>

Springsteen plays 8 hours<br>
The Age<br>
Melbourne<br>
Feb 17, 2014</strong><br>
<br>
The musician played the surprise ‘album show’ card to differentiate the Melbourne shows from the ones he played last year.<br>
<br>
The Perth and Adelaide shows, where Springsteen was touring for the first time, got a ‘regular’ <br>
<br>
Boss fans in Sydney and Brisbane are now bracing for their own ‘album’ 
shows, perhaps of other Springsteen classic albums, to differentiate 
their 2013 and 2014 tours.<br>
<br>
The Melbourne dates continued Springsteen’s increasingly varied setlists
 for this tour, with 47 different songs played over the two nights in 
Melbourne, including obscure cover Jole Blon requested by a fan holding a
 sign.<br>
<br>
“We’ve done entire world tours doing 140 (different) songs, which is 
more than most groups, but that’s after 60 shows. We’ve broken 100 
(different) songs and that’s impressive, even for us.”<br>
<br>
Fans can now download each concert as a permanent souvenir.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN PLAYS 100th SONG IN MELBOURNE<br>
<br>
“The audience knows we are creating a show just for them,” Van Zandt 
said. “People get a memento of their show which is always unique. No two
 shows are the same. You want the show you were at like an audio 
T-shirt. I think we’re still getting better. I know it sounds silly to 
say that after 40 years, but it’s better in many ways.”<br>
<br>
The guitarist also said the increasingly lengthy shows were no surprise.<br>
<br>
“We started off in the ‘70s doing four-hour shows, so this seems quite 
civilised. But you’ve got to be in shape to do this show. If you don’t 
respect the show you will be hurt!”<br>
<br>
Van Zandt said playing with extra guitarist Tom Morello was a bonus for 
fans; Van Zandt missed the last Australian tour to film his SBS TV show 
Lilyhammer.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen thrilled Melbourne fans by performing the full Born in the USA and Born to Run albums. Picture Ian Currie.<br>
“Come one come all,” Van Zandt said. “There’s plenty of room up there. 
We’re having fun with it, makes it an even four guitars. Everyone does 
something different. I know it seems a bit of a redundancy going on but 
it’s actually not. I’m not there to express myself musically. My role is
 different. I’m the lifelong best friend. We’re coming up on 50 years. 
That’s its own thing. We work the audience, I’m out there with Bruce 
every now and then, helping him interact with the audience. Nils 
(Lofgren) and Tom split up big guitar solos. It seems we’ve added rather
 than replaced. We’re doing (Ghost of) Tom Joad pretty much every night 
which we wouldn’t probably do if Tom wasn’t there. Everyone gets their 
moment to do their thing. It’s more different ways of having fun.”<br>
Eddie Vedder joined Springsteen on Saturday to perform AC/DC’s Highway to Hell and The Boss’s Darkness on the Edge of Town.<br>
<br>
After his cameo, Vedder watched the show in the moshpit. The Pearl Jam 
singer said he was given an endless supply of free beer by fans who 
recognised him.<br>
<br>
“I didn’t want to appear ungrateful,” a hung-over Vedder told the crowd at his Palais show on Sunday night.<br>
<br>
Morello posted a photo of him with Springsteen and Vedder out on the town in Melbourne after Saturday’s show.<br>
<br>
During his own show, Vedder also pointed out the journey of his first 
concert being a back row seat to see Springsteen in Chicago in 1977 to 
singing on stage with him nearly 30 years later.<br>
<br>
He covered Springsteen’s Bobby Jean and Van Zandt’s I Am a Patriot at his first Melbourne show.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s next Australian show is Allphones Arena on Wednesday, 
Hunter Valley shows on Saturday and Sunday and the Brisbane 
Entertainment Centre on February 26.<br>
<br>
He will then play to over 75,000 New Zealanders in Auckland.<br>
<br>
Over 200,000 tickets have been sold for his 11 Australian shows on this tour.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen on the Stratocaster<br>
FEB. 13, 2014</strong><br>
<br>
In 2004, Bruce Spring­steen wrote a let­ter to Los Angeles Times staff 
writer Randy Lewis about why he did not wish to be in­ter­viewed about 
the 50th an­niversary of the Fend­er Stra­tocaster gui­tar.<br>
<br>
June 2, 2004<br>
Dear Randy<br>
<br>
I would like to be a part of your story on the Fender Stratocaster but,<br>
alas, I cannot. The Stratocaster is a great and iconic instrurnent. When Bob<br>
Dylan strapped one on in the mid-sixties (yes, it was a Stratocaster_that was<br>
supposedly booed so lustily at Newport) or when imi Hendricks played the<br>
Star Spangled Banner on one atwoodstock, well. . .that settled that.<br>
are mg kinds of people in the world. Those that play<br>
?_t;a;ocasters and those that play Ielgcasters. . .and the twain rarely meet.<br>
Ron Stratocaster. .. Keith Richards. . .Gibsons, Tele's, etc. The<br>
Strokes. . .a young man on a Stratocaster and a young man on a <br>
Nils Lofgren, Steve Van Zandt. . .Strat's. . <br>
TIL HE <br>
<br>
There are some, similar to those who change political affiliation late<br>
in life, who for some reason switch. Jeff Beck. . .Master of the Tele. . .Master<br>
of the Strat. . .but, they are rare. Robbie Robertson, who also had an affinity<br>
for both guitars, gave me a beautifiil Strat I play on occasion in the <br>
However, when that big Rock Roll clock strikes twelve I will be buried<br>
with my Tele on! So. . . When you do your article on the Telecaster please by<br>
all means give me a shout. Until then, I wish you good luck on your article<br>
on the Fender ?t_r_a_tocaster. A guitar that has contributed greatly to Rock and<br>
Roll, 3. fine and wonderful It's just not a <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PS. The guy standing next to the big black guy on the cover of Born to Run<br>
is wearing a Telecaster (actually, a Telecaster body with an Esquire neck)</div>

Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band<br>
Allphones Arena, February 19<br>
<br>
It's a communal thing. A two-way street. A give-and-you-shall-receive 
understanding we all grasp, on stage or off. It's why this night is not 
really like any other night. It's not just Bruce Springsteen, it's not 
even just Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band; it's them and us as 
one sweating entity.<br>
<br>
That roof-raising exultation in the soul-rousing, gospel power of Land 
Of Hope And Dreams or the way there's open sky hope out of grimness in 
Badlands; we are part of the reason for it, pushing with this 17-piece 
band that leads but shares rather than dominates. The hushed air and 
quiet despair of Racing In The Streets; everyone holds their breath and 
lets it through so it can reach that little bit further in you. That 
ripple of excitement as the opening notes of INXS's Don't Change are 
recognised; it washes from the floor to the stage and then returns, 
doubled, as the song runs free like some galloping brumby.<br>
<br>

(Notes from the moshpit: When the appallingly trim and taut Springsteen -
 “I'm sixty-f---ing-five” - makes first foray into the audience and on 
to the ramp midway down the room there's lots of touching. “I squeezed 
his bicep,” said an excited local songwriter. “It's so big.”)<br>
<br>
It is a big band and not everybody is needed all the time – five 
guitars? Who does that? But what's fascinating is how everybody is 
committed all the time. There's no dropping off in the brass section in a
 quiet part, no aimless strumming during a solo.<br>
<br>
Everyone has a role, an element they contribute, whether it is a look 
they exchange or a gesture to the crowd; Steve Van Zandt's presence as 
the benign consigliere, Eddie Manion taking all the sax solos in the 
forced absence of Jake (and of course, Clarence) Clemons as if he'd 
always done them, the solidity of Garry Tallent and Roy Bittan or the 
verve and fire of Nils Lofgren's out of nowhere solo in Prove It All 
Night.<br>
<br>
(Notes from the moshpit: There's a couple who have taken the fandom 
thing to the point of naming their children after their favourite song's
 characters. “Our daughter is Mary, our son is Danny,” their sign says. 
“Please play Frankie.”)<br>
<br>
Among the scrawled and smudged text of this reviewer's notebook - worked
 heavily for three hours - one word leaps out regularly and clearly: 
energy. The energy of Max Weinberg who at first looks super solid and 
powerful, then becomes the unrelenting and unequivocal base on which all
 flourishes, all side trips, all explosions are based. The energy that 
Tom Morello – not a universally appreciated addition to the E Street 
Band – has added; a pointed edge, a dirtier layer and, in The Ghost Of 
Tom Joad, a thrilling power.<br>
<br>
And of course the energy of Springsteen himself who runs, grabs, falls, 
rises, engulfs, invites, sweats, is carried by us and in turn carries 
us, right to the voice-and-harmonium intimate closer of Dream Baby 
Dream.<br>
<br>
(Notes from the moshpit: After Springsteen falls back into the mosh to 
be carried back, crowd-surfing to the stage, people rush from everywhere
 to be part of it, to lay on hands, and to, franky, grope. That excited 
local songwriter returns beaming. “I just grabbed Bruce Springsteen's 
arse ... it's so firm.”)<br>
<br>
In Melbourne they got Born To Run and Born In The USA albums played in 
full mid-show. Can't complain about those crowd-pleasers. But there's a 
gasp through the room when the wished-for full run through of Darkness 
On The Edge Of Town - the diehard's choice, the album which has that 
classic Springsteen motif of hope-out-of-grimness – is unveiled. For 
some here it's already a bucket list item ticked off.<br>
<br>
(Notes from the moshpit: There's a couple of Wiggles down here, quite a 
few musicians and a bunch of ABC TV faces, as excited as anyone. One of 
the ABC mob has a hastily fashioned sign: “It's my birthday. Dance?!”. 
It really is her birthday but she's not one of the chosen during Dancing
 In The Dark and comically stamps her feet in disappointment. Moments 
later though she's punching the air during Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out, 
sharing a grin with the three tall men in front her, throwing back the 
heat and laughter the band - still agog at the pace at which they had 
played Born To Run - are giving off. Lost in it. Together.)<br>
<br>
It's a communal thing. A two-way street. A give and you shall receive understanding.</div>
