PBS , 2012-03-15<br>
By Bruce Springsteen<br>
Good morning! Why are we up so fucking early? How important can this 
speech be if we're giving it at noon? It can't be that important. Every 
decent musician in town is asleep, or they will be before I'm done with 
this thing, I guarantee you. I've got a bit of a mess up here. <br>
<br>
When I was invited to do the keynote speech of this year's conference I 
was a little hesitant because the word keynote made me uncomfortable. It
 seemed to suggest that there was a key note to be struck that sums up 
whatever is going on out there in the streets. <br>
<br>
Five days of bands, hundreds of venues from morning till night, and no 
one really hardly agrees on anything in pop anymore. There is no key 
note, I don't think. There is no unified theory of everything. You can 
ask Einstein. But you can pick any band, say KISS, and you can go, 
"Early Theatre Rock proponents, expressing the true raging hormones of 
youth" or "They suck!" <br>
<br>
You can go, Phish, "Inheritors of the Grateful Dead's mantle, brilliant 
center of the true Alternative community," or "They suck." You go, 
"Bruce Springsteen, natural–born poetic genius off the streets of 
Monmouth County, hardest – hardest working – hardest working New 
Jerseyian in show business, voice of the common man, future of Rock and 
Roll!", or "He sucks. Get the fuck out of here!" <br>
<br>
You could pick any band, and create your own equation. It's fun. There 
was even a recent book that focused on the Beatles and decided, you got 
it, they sucked. So really, instead of a keynote speech, I thought that 
perhaps this should be a key notes speech, or perhaps many keynote 
speakers. I exaggerate for effect, but only a little bit. So with that 
as my disclaimer, I move cautiously on. <br>
<br>
Still, it's great to be in a town with ten thousand bands, or 
whatever…anybody know the actual number? Come on, a lot of them, right? 
Back in late sixty–four when I picked a guitar that would have seemed 
line some insane, teenage pipe dream, because first of all, it would 
have been numerically impossible. There just weren't that many guitars 
to go around in those days. They simply hadn't made that many yet. We 
would have all have to have been sharing. <br>
<br>
Guitar players were rare. Mostly, music schooled bands were rare, and, 
until the Beatles hit, played primarily instrumental music. And there 
wasn't that much music to play. When I picked up the guitar, there was 
only ten years of Rock history to draw on. That would be, like, all of 
known Pop being only the music that you know that's occurred between 
2002 and now. <br>
<br>
The most groups in one place I had ever seen as a teenager was twenty 
bands at the Keyport Matawan Roller Dome in a battle to the death. So 
many styles were overlapping at that point in time that you would have a
 doo wop singing group with full pompadours and matching suits set up 
next to our band playing a garage version of Them's "Mystic Eyes," set 
up next to a full thirteen–piece soul show band. And still that's 
nothing minutely compared to what's going on, on the streets of Austin 
right now. <br>
<br>
So, it's incredible to be back. I've had a lot of fun here in Austin 
since the '70s, and Jim Franklin and the Armadillo World Headquarters. 
It's fascinating to see what's become of the music that I've loved my 
whole life. Pop's become a new language, cultural force, social 
movement. Actually, a series of new languages, cultural forces, and 
social movements that have inspired and enlivened the second half of the
 twentieth century, and the dawning years of this one. I mean, who would
 have thought that there would have been a sax–playing president, or a 
soul–singing president, you know? <br>
<br>
When we started, thirty years old for a Rock musician was unthinkable. 
Bill Halley kept his age a relative secret. So when Danny and the 
Juniors sang "Rock and Roll is Here to Stay," they didn't have a clue as
 to how terrifyingly, fucking right they were going to be. When I look 
out from my stage these days, I look into the eyes of three generations 
of people, and still popular music continues to provide its primary 
function as youth music, as a joyous argument–starter, and as a subject 
for long booze–filled nights of debate with Steve Van Zandt, over who 
reigns ultimately supreme. <br>
<br>
There are so many sub–genres and fashions, two–tone, acid rock, 
alternative dance, alternative metal, alternative rock, art punk, art 
rock, avant garde metal, black metal, black and death metal, Christian 
metal, heavy metal, funk metal, bland metal, medieval metal, indie 
metal, melodic death metal, melodic black metal, metal core, hard core, 
electronic hard core, folk punk, folk rock, pop punk, Brit pop, grunge, 
sad core, surf music, psychedelic rock, punk rock, hip hop, rap rock, 
rap metal, Nintendo core, huh? <br>
<br>
I just want to know what an Nintendo core is, myself. But rock noir, 
shock rock, skate punk, noise core, noise pop, noise rock, pagan rock, 
paisley underground, indy pop, indy rock, heartland rock, roots rock, 
samba rock, screamo–emo, shoe–gazing stoner rock, swamp pop, synth pop, 
rock against communism, garage rock, blues rock, death and roll, lo–fi, 
jangle pop, folk music. Just add neo– and post– to everything I said, 
and mention them all again. Yeah, and rock and roll. <br>
<br>
So, holy shit, this is all going on in this town right now. For a guy 
who realizes U2 is probably the last band he is going to know the names 
of all four members of, it's overwhelming. Perhaps the most prophetic 
comment I've heard over the past quarter century about rock music was 
made by Lester Bangs upon Elvis' death. In 1977, Lester Bangs said Elvis
 was probably the last thing we were all going to agree on – Public 
Enemy not counting. <br>
<br>
From here on in, you would have your heroes and I would have mine. The 
center of your world may be Iggy Pop, or Joni Mitchell, or maybe Dylan. 
Mine might be KISS, or Pearl Jam, but we would never see eye–to–eye 
again, and be brought together by one music again. And his final quote 
in the article was, "So, instead of saying goodbye to Elvis, I'm gonna 
say goodbye to you."<br>
<br>
While that's been proven a thousand times over, still here we are in a 
town with thousands of bands, each with a style, and a philosophy, and a
 song of their own. And I think the best of them believe that they have 
the power to turn Lester's prophecy inside out, and to beat his odds. <br>
<br>
So as the records that my music was initially released on give way to a 
cloud of ones and zeroes, and as I carry my entire record collection 
since I was thirteen in my breast pocket, I'd like to talk about the one
 thing that's been consistent over the years, the genesis and power of 
creativity, the power of the songwriter, or let's say, composer, or just
 creator. So whether you're making dance music, Americana, rap music, 
electronica, it's all about how you are putting what you do together. 
The elements you're using don't matter. Purity of human expression and 
experience is not confined to guitars, to tubes, to turntables, to 
microchips. There is no right way, no pure way, of doing it. There's 
just doing it. <br>
<br>
We live in a post–authentic world. And today authenticity is a house of 
mirrors. It's all just what you're bringing when the lights go down. 
It's your teachers, your influences, your personal history; and at the 
end of the day, it's the power and purpose of your music that still 
matters. <br>
<br>
So I'm gonna talk, a little bit today, about how I've put what I've done
 together, in the hopes that someone slugging away in one of the clubs 
tonight may find some small piece of it valuable. And this being Woody 
Guthrie's hundredth birthday, and the centerpiece of this year's 
South–by–Southwest Conference, I'm also gonna talk a little about my 
musical development, and where it intersected with Woody's, and why. <br>
<br>
In the beginning, every musician has their genesis moment. For you, it 
might have been the Sex Pistols, or Madonna, or Public Enemy. It's 
whatever initially inspires you to action. Mine was 1956, Elvis on the 
Ed Sullivan Show. It was the evening I realized a white man could make 
magic, that you did not have to be constrained by your upbringing, by 
the way you looked, or by the social context that oppressed you. You 
could call upon your own powers of imagination, and you could create a 
transformative self. <br>
<br>
A certain type of transformative self, that perhaps at any other moment 
in American History, might have seemed difficult, if not impossible. And
 I always tell my kids that they were lucky to be born in the age of 
reproducible technology, otherwise they'd be traveling in the back of a 
wagon and I'd be wearing a jester's hat. It's all about timing. The 
advent of television and its dissemination of visual information changed
 the world in the fifties the way the internet has over the past twenty 
years. <br>
<br>
Remember, it wasn't just the way Elvis looked, it was the way he moved 
that made people crazy, pissed off, driven to screaming ecstasy, and 
profane revulsion. That was television. When they made an attempt to 
censor him from the waist down, it was because of what you could see 
happening in his pants. Elvis was the first modern Twentieth Century 
man, the precursor of the Sexual Revolution, of the Civil Rights 
Revolution, drawn from the same Memphis as Martin Luther King, creating 
fundamental, outsider art that would be embraced by a mainstream popular
 culture. <br>
<br>
Television and Elvis gave us full access to a new language, a new form 
of communication, a new way of being, a new way of looking, a new way of
 thinking; about sex, about race, about identity, about life; a new way 
of being an American, a human being; and a new way of hearing music. 
Once Elvis came across the airwaves, once he was heard and seen in 
action, you could not put the genie back in the bottle. After that 
moment, there was yesterday, and there was today, and there was a red 
hot, rockabilly forging of a new tomorrow, before your very eyes. <br>
<br>
So, one week later, inspired by the passion in Elvis' pants, my little 
six–year–old fingers wrapped themselves around a guitar neck for the 
first time, rented from Mike Deal's Music in Freehold, New Jersey. They 
just wouldn't fit. Failure with a capital F. So I just beat on it, and 
beat on it, and beat on it – in front of the mirror, of course. I still 
do that. Don't you? Come on, you gotta check your moves. All right? <br>
<br>
But even before there was Elvis, my world had begun to be shaped by the 
little radio with the six–inch mono speaker that sat on top of our 
refrigerator. My mother loved music, and she rahised us on pop music 
radio. So between 8:00 and 8:30 every morning, as I snowed sugar onto my
 Sugar Pops, the sounds of early pop and doo wop whispered into my young
 and impressionable ears. Doo wop, the most sensual music ever made, the
 sound of raw sex, of silk stockings rustling on backseat upholstery, 
the sound of the snaps of bras popping across the USA, of wonderful lies
 being whispered into Tabu–perfumed ears, the sound of smeared lipstick,
 untucked shirts, running mascara, tears on your pillow, secrets 
whispered in the still of the night, the high school bleachers, and the 
dark at the YMCA canteen. The soundtrack for your incredibly, wonderful 
limp–your–ass, blue–balled walk back home after the dance. Oh! And it 
hurt so good. <br>
<br>
In the late fifties and early sixties doo wop dripped from radios in the
 gas stations, factories, streets, and pool halls – the temples of life 
and mystery in my little hometown. And I would always be enraptured by 
its basic chord progression. Isn't there supposed to be a guitar around 
here somewhere? Anybody got one? <br>
<br>
(strumming guitar and singing opening lines of song, "Backstreets") One soft infested summer, me and Terry became friends... <br>
<br>
It all comes from the same place. Well anyway, then into my 
thirteen–year–old ears came 60's pop. Roy Orbison, besides Johnny Cash, 
he was the other Man in Black. He was the true master of the romantic 
apocalypse you dreaded, and knew was coming after the first night you 
whispered, I love you, to your new girlfriend. You were going down. Roy 
was the coolest, uncool loser you'd ever seen. With his Coke bottle 
black glasses, his three–octave range, he seemed to take joy sticking 
his knife deep into the hot belly of your teenage insecurities. <br>
<br>
Simply the titles, "Crying," "It's Over," "Running Scared." That's 
right, the paranoia, oh, the paranoia. He sang about the tragic 
unknowability of women. He was tortured by soft skin, angora sweaters, 
beauty, and death – just like you. But he also sang that he'd been risen
 to the heights of near unexpressable bliss by these same very things 
that tortured him. Oh, cruel irony. <br>
<br>
And for those few moments, he told you that the wreckage, and the ruin, 
and the heartbreak was all worth it. I got it, my young songwriters, 
wisdom said to me: Life is tragedy, broken by moments of unworldly bliss
 that make that tragedy bearable. I was half right. That wasn't life, 
that was pop music. <br>
<br>
But at twenty–four, who knew the difference? So I was on my way. Then 
Spector and the Wall of Sound. Phil's entire body of work could be 
described by the title of one of his lesser–known productions, "He Hit 
Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss)." Phil's records felt like near chaos, 
violence covered in sugar and candy, sung by the girls who were sending 
Roy–o running straight for the anti–depressants. If Roy was opera, Phil 
was symphonies, little three–minute orgasms, followed by oblivion. <br>
<br>
And Phil's greatest lesson was sound. Sound is its own language. I mean,
 the first thing you would think of with Phil Spector is (soundbite of 
mimicking a drum beat). That was all you needed. And then, the British 
Invasion. My first real guitar, I actually began to learn how to play, 
and this was different, shifted the lay of the land. Four guys, playing 
and singing, writing their own material. There was no longer gonna be a 
music producer apart from the singer, a singer who didn't write, a 
writer who didn't sing. It changed the way things were done. The Beatles
 were cool. They were classical, formal, and created the idea of an 
independent unit where everything could come out of your garage. The 
"Meet the Beatles" album cover, those four head shots. I remember, I 
seen 'em at J. J. Newberry's. It was the first thing I saw when you ran 
down to the five–and–ten cent store. There were no record stores. There 
weren't enough records, I don't think, in those days. There was a little
 set by the toys where they sold a few albums. <br>
<br>
And I remember running in and seeing that album cover with those four 
headshots. It was like the silent gods of Olympus. Your future was just 
sort of staring you in the face. I remember thinking, "That's too cool. 
I'm never gonna get there, man, never." And then in some fanzine I came 
across a picture of the Beatles in Hamburg. And they had on the leather 
jackets and the slick–backed pompadours, they had acned faces. I said, 
hey, "Wait a minute, those are the guys I grew up with, only they were 
Liverpool wharf rats." <br>
<br>
So minus their Nehru jackets and the haircuts – so these guys, they're 
kids. They're a lot cooler than me, but they're still kids. There must 
be a way to get there from here. Then for me, it was The Animals. For 
some, they were just another one the really good beat groups that came 
of the 60s. But to me, The Animals were a revelation. The first records 
with full blown class consciousness that I had ever heard. "We Gotta Get
 Out Of This Place" had that great bass riff, that (playing bass line of
 "We Gotta Get Out Of This Place) and that was just marking time. <br>
<br>
(Singing and strumming "We Gotta Get Out Of This Place"): <br>
In this dirty old part of the city, where the sun refused to shine. <br>
People tell me there ain't no sense in trying. <br>
My little girl, you're so young and pretty. <br>
One thing I know is true, <br>
You'll be dead before your time is due, this I know. <br>
See my Daddy in bed and dying. <br>
See his hair turning grey. <br>
He's been working and slaving his life away, yes, I know. <br>
It's been work – every day <br>
Just work – every day <br>
It's been work, work, work, work. <br>
We gotta get out of this place <br>
If it's the last thing we ever do <br>
We gotta get out of this place <br>
Girl, there's a better life for me and you. <br>
Yes, I know it's true. <br>
<br>
That's every song I've ever written. Yeah. That's all of them. I'm not 
kidding, either. That's "Born to Run," "Born in the USA," everything 
I've done for the past 40 years, including all the new ones. But that 
struck me so deep. It was the first time I felt I heard something come 
across the radio that mirrored my home life, my childhood. And the other
 thing that was great about The Animals was there were no good–looking 
members. There were none. They were considered to be one of the ugliest 
groups in all of rock and roll. <br>
<br>
And that was good. That was good for me, because I considered myself 
hideous at the time. And they weren't nice, you know. They didn't curry 
favor, you know. They were like aggression personified. It's my life, 
I'll do what I want. They were cruel. They were cruel, which was so 
freeing. It was so freeing. When you saw Eric Burdon, he was like your 
shrunken daddy with a wig on. He never, he never had a kid's face. He 
always had a little man's face, you know. <br>
<br>
And he couldn't dance. And they put him in suit, but it was like putting
 a gorilla in a suit. You could tell he was like, "Fuck that shit, man."
 He didn't want it. And then he had that voice that was, like, I don't 
know, the Howlin' Wolf, or something – coming out of some seventeen or 
eighteen–year–old kid. I don't know how it happened. I found their 
cruelty so freeing. What was that great verse in "It's My Life?" It's a 
hard world to get a break in, all the good things have been taken. And 
then, "Though dressed in these rags I'll wear sable someday, hear what I
 say. I'm gonna ride the serpent. No more time spent sweating rent." 
Then that beautiful, "It's my life. Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime.
 Hurt me sometime. But someday I'll treat you real fine. I love that. <br>
<br>
And then they had the name. The name was very different from the 
Beatles, or Herman's Hermits, or Freddie and the Dreamers. The name was 
unforgiving, and final, and irrevocable. I mean, it was in your face. It
 was the most unapologetic group name until the Sex Pistols came along. <br>
<br>
"Badlands," "Prove It All Night," Darkness On The Edge of Town was 
filled with, with The Animals. Youngsters, watch this one. I'm gonna 
tell you how it's done, right now. I took "Don't Let Me Be 
Misunderstood," <br>
<br>
(Singing and strumming beginning of "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood": <br>
Danta, danta, danta, dah. <br>
Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. <br>
Danta, danta, danta, dah <br>
Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. <br>
(Singing melody of "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" while strumming chords of "Badlands": <br>
Dah, dah, danta, tadah. <br>
Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. <br>
Danta, danta, danta, dah. <br>
Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. <br>
<br>
It's the same fucking riff, man.Listen up, listen up, youngsters, this 
is how successful theft is accomplished. "Darkness" was also informed by
 the punk explosion at the time. I went out and I got all the records, 
all the early punk records, and I brought "Anarchy in the UK," and "God 
Save the Queen," and the Sex Pistols were so frightening. They literally
 shook the earth. And a lot of groups managed shocking. But frightening,
 frightening was something else. There were, very, very few rock groups 
that managed frightening. And that was a great quality, and it was, part
 of their great beauty. <br>
<br>
They were brave, and they challenged you, and they made you brave and 
lot of that energy seeped its way into subtext of "Darkness." "Darkness"
 was written in 1977, and all of that music was out there, and if you 
had ears you could not ignore it. And I had peers that did. And they 
were mistaken, you could not ignore that challenge. <br>
<br>
Of course, for me, there was movies, films. That's another discussion. 
But it was, then about soul music. It's incredibly important. The blue 
collar grit of soul music. <br>
<br>
(Singing "Soul Man"): <br>
I was brought up on a backstreet <br>
I learned how to love before I could eat. <br>
<br>
Now even though I personally learned how to eat long before I knew how 
to love, I knew what he was talking about. It was the music of gritty 
determination – of the blues, of the church, of the Earth, and of the 
sex–soaked heavens. It was music of sweaty perspiration, and drenched 
demands for pleasure and respect. It was adult music, it was sung by 
soul men and women, not teen idols. <br>
<br>
And then it was the silk and sequined aspirational sounds of Motown. And
 that was something smoother, but that was no less powerful than, than 
Stax. There's a beautifully socially–conscious soul of Curtis Mayfield 
and the Impressions, "We're a Winner," keep on pushin'. Just great, 
great records that just filled the airwaves at a time when you couldn't 
have needed them more. You just couldn't have needed them more. <br>
<br>
"A Woman's Got Soul," what a beautiful, beautiful record to women. "It's
 All Right." It was the sound track of the Civil Rights Movement. And it
 was here, amongst these great African–American artists, that I learned 
my craft. You learned how to write. You learned how to arrange. You 
learned what mattered and what didn't. You learned what a great 
production sounds like. You learned how to lead a band. You learned how 
to front a band. <br>
<br>
These men and women, they were and they remain my masters. By the time I
 reached my twenties, I'd spent a thousand nights employing their 
lessons in local clubs and bars, honing my own skills. I was signed as 
an acoustic singer/songwriter, but I was wolf in sheep's clothing – 
signed by John Hammond at Columbia Records, along with Elliott Murphy, 
John Prine, Loudin Wainwright III. We were all new Dylans. <br>
<br>
And the old Dylan was only 30. So I don't even know why they needed a 
fucking new Dylan, all right? But those were the times. 30 was, you 
know…But I had nights and nights of bar playing behind me to bring my 
songs home. Young musicians, learn how to bring it live, and then bring 
it night, after night, after night, after night. Your audience will 
remember you. <br>
<br>
Your ticket is your handshake. These skills gave me a huge ace up my 
sleeve. And when we finally went on the road, and we played that ace, we
 scorched the Earth, because that's what I was taught to do by Sam 
Moore, and by James Brown. There's no greater performance than James 
Brown burning ass on the Rolling Stones at The T.A.M.I. show. Sorry, 
sorry, my friends. I fucking loved the Stones. But James Brown – boys 
and men, you were screwed. Yeah, I think I'll go on after James Brown. <br>
<br>
Oh, yeah, can you put me in the schedule somewhere after James Brown? 
Fuck, no. Get out. Go home. Save it. Don't waste it, man. I had a great 
thing with James Brown. I went to see James Brown one night, and he kind
 of knew me. I was sitting in the audience, and, suddenly I heard: 
Ladies and gentlemen, Magic Johnson, and Magic Johnson was onstage. And:
 Ladies and gentlemen, Woody Harrelson, and he was on stage. And then 
I'm sitting in my seat, watching, I hear: Ladies and gentleman, Mr. Mr.,
 Mr. "Born in the USA." And I realized he didn't know my name, so I ran 
my ass up there as fast as I could. <br>
<br>
I can't tell you, man, standing on stage alongside of James Brown…it was
 like, "Fuck, what am I doing here? He's such a, his influence. James 
Brown, underrated, still, today, underrated. He's, He's Elvis. He's 
Dylan. Dylan from whom I first heard a version of the place that I lived
 that felt unvarnished and real to me. <br>
<br>
If you were young in the sixties and fifties, everything felt false 
everywhere you turned. But you didn't know how to say it. There was no 
language for it at the time. It just felt fucked up, but you didn't have
 the words. Bob came along and gave us those words. He gave us those 
songs. And the first time he asked you was: How does it feel? Man, how 
does it feel to be on your own? And if you were a kid in 1965, you were 
on your own, because your parents, God bless them, they could not 
understand the incredible changes that were taking place. You were on 
your own, without a home. He gave us the words to understand our hearts.
 <br>
<br>
He didn't treat you like a child. He treated you like an adult. He stood
 back and he took in the stakes that we were playing for, he laid them 
out in front of you. I never forgot it. Bob is the father of my musical 
country, now and forever. And I thank him. <br>
<br>
The great, the great trick I learned from Bob is that he still does one 
thing that nobody, nobody can do. He sings verse, after verse, after 
verse and it doesn't get boring. It's almost impossible. But he didn't 
write about something, he wrote about everything that mattered at once 
in every song, it seemed like. <br>
<br>
He pulled it off. I said, "Yeah, I like that. I'm gonna try that." So 
now I'm in my late twenties, and I'm concerned, of course – getting 
older. I want to write music that I can imagine myself singing on stage 
at the advanced old age, perhaps, of 40? I wanted to grow up. I wanted 
to twist the form I loved into something that could address my adult 
concerns. And so I found my way to country music. <br>
<br>
I remember sitting in my little apartment, playing "Hank Williams 
Greatest Hits" over and over. And I was trying to crack its code, 
because at first it just didn't sound good to me. It just sounded cranky
 and old–fashioned. But it was that hard country voice and I'm playing 
it, and it was an austere instrumentation. But slowly, slowly, my ears 
became accustomed to it, it's beautiful simplicity, and it's darkness 
and depth. And Hank Williams went from archival, to alive for me, before
 my very eyes. <br>
<br>
And I lived on that for a while in the late seventies. In country music,
 I found the adult blues, the working men's and women's stories I'd been
 searching for, the grim recognition of the chips that were laid down 
against you. "My Bucket's Got A Hole In It." "I'll Never Get Out Of This
 World Alive," "Lost Highway," the great Charlie Rich song, <br>
<br>
(Singing "Life Has it's Little Ups and Downs"): <br>
Like ponies on a merry–go–round <br>
No one grabs a brass ring every time <br>
But she don't mind <br>
(Speaking) Oh fuck, man, that was like… <br>
(Singing "Life Has it's Little Ups and Downs"): <br>
She wears a gold ring on her finger <br>
And it's mine <br>
<br>
Oh my God, you know, that can reduce me to tears now. It was so much. It
 was "Working Man's Blues" – stoic recognition of everyday reality, and 
the small and big things that allow you to put a foot in front of the 
other and get you through. I found that Country's fatalism attracted me.
 It was reflective. It was funny. It was soulful. But it was quite 
fatalistic. Tomorrow looked pretty dark. <br>
<br>
And the one thing it rarely was, it was rarely politically angry, and it
 was rarely politically critical. And I realized that that fatalism had a
 toxic element. If rock and roll was a seven–day weekend, country was 
Saturday night hell–raising, followed by heavy "Sunday Morning Coming 
Down." Guilt, guilt, guilt, I fucked up. Oh, my God. But, as the song 
says: Would you take another chance on me? That was Country. <br>
<br>
Country seemed, not to question why. It seemed like it was about doing, 
then dying, screwing, then crying, boozing, then trying, Then as Jerry 
Lee Lewis, the living, breathing personification of both rock and 
country said, "I've fallen to the bottom and I'm working my way down." <br>
<br>
So that was hard core working man's blues, hard core – loved it. And in 
answer to Hank Williams question: Why does my bucket have a hole in it? 
Why? So along with our fun, and the bar band raucousness, the E Street 
Band carried a search for identity, and that became a central part of my
 music. Now country, by its nature, appealed to me. Country was 
provincial, and so was I. I was not downtown. I wasn't particularly 
Bohemian or hipster. I was kind of hippy–by–circumstance, when it 
happened. But, I felt I was an average guy, with a slightly above 
average gift. And if I worked my ass off on it…And country was about the
 truth emanating out of your sweat, out of your local bar, your corner 
store. It held its gaze on yesterday's blues, tonight's pleasures' and 
maybe on Sunday, the hereafter. And I covered a lot of ground, but there
 was still something missing. So, somewhere in my late twenties I picked
 up Joe Klein's "Woody Guthrie, A Life." <br>
<br>
And as I read that book, a world of possibilities that predated Dylan's,
 that had inspired him, and lead to some of his greatest work, opened up
 for me. Woody's gaze was – it was set on today's hard times. But also, 
somewhere over the horizon, there was something. Woody's world was a 
world where fatalism was tempered by a practical idealism. It was a 
world where speaking truth to power wasn't futile, whatever its outcome.
 <br>
<br>
Why do we continue to talk about Woody so many years on, never had a 
hit, never went platinum, never played in an arena, never got his 
picture on the cover of Rolling Stone. But he's a ghost in the machine –
 big, big ghost in the machine. And I believe it's because Woody's 
songs, his body of work, tried to answer Hank Williams' question: why 
your bucket has a whole in it. And that's a question that's eaten at me 
for a long time. <br>
<br>
So, in my early 30s, his voice spoke to me very, very deeply. And we 
began to cover "This Land is Your Land" in concert. And I knew I was 
never gonna be Woody Guthrie. I liked Elvis, and I liked the Pink 
Cadillac too much. I like the simplicity, and the tossed–off temporary 
feeling of pop hits. I liked big, fucking noise. And in my own way, I 
like the luxuries and the comforts of being a star. I had already gone a
 long way down a pretty different road. <br>
<br>
So four years ago, I found myself in an unusual situation. It was a cold
 winter day, and I was standing alongside of Pete Seeger, and it was 25 
degrees. Pete had come to Washington. Pete carries a banjo everywhere he
 goes – the subway, the bus – and comes out in his shirt. I said, "Man, 
Pete, put on a jacket, man, it's freezing out here." He's ninety years 
old, a living embodiment of Woody's legacy. And there were several 
hundred thousand of our fellow citizens in front of us. We had the 
Lincoln Memorial behind us and a newly–elected president to our right. 
And we were going to sing, "This Land is Your Land" in front of all 
these Americans. And Pete insisted, "We have to sing all the verses. We 
have to sing all the verses, man. You can't leave any of them out." I 
said, I don't know, Pete, there's only – we had, like, a crowd of six 
year old school kids behind us. He says, "No, we're all gonna sing all 
the verses – all the verses. And, so we got to it." <br>
<br>
(Playing guitar and singing "This Land Is Your Land"): <br>
As I was walking <br>
I saw a sign there <br>
And on that sign said <br>
We're trespassing <br>
And on the other side <br>
It didn't said nothing <br>
That side was made <br>
For you and me. <br>
This land is your land <br>
This land is my land <br>
<br>
(Speaking) This song is meant to be sung by everybody. <br>
<br>
(Playing guitar and singing "This Land Is Your Land" – crowd singing along): <br>
From California <br>
To the New York island <br>
From the Redwood Forest <br>
To the Gulf Stream waters <br>
This land was made for you and me <br>
<br>
So, on that day, Pete and myself, and generations of young and old 
Americans – all colors, religious beliefs – I realized that sometimes 
things that come from the outside, they make their way in, to become a 
part of the beating heart of the nation. And on that day, when we sung 
that song, Americans – young and old, black and white, of all religious 
and political beliefs – were united, for a brief moment, by Woody's 
poetry. <br>
<br>
So, perhaps Lester Bangs wasn't completely right, for here we all are 
tonight in this town together, musicians, young and old, celebrating, 
each, perhaps in our own way, a sense of freedom that was Woody's 
legacy. So, rumble, young musicians, rumble. Open your ears and open 
your hearts. Don't take yourself too seriously, and take yourself as 
seriously as death itself. Don't worry. Worry your ass off. Have 
ironclad confidence, but doubt – it keeps you awake and alert. Believe 
you are the baddest ass in town, and, you suck! <br>
<br>
It keeps you honest. It keeps you honest. Be able to keep two completely
 contradictory ideas alive and well inside of your heart and head at all
 times. If it doesn't drive you crazy, it will make you strong. And stay
 hard, stay hungry, and stay alive. And when you walk onstage on tonight
 to bring the noise, treat it like it's all we have. And then remember, 
it's only rock and roll. I think I may go out and catch a little black 
death metal. Thank you.</div>

ROCK 'N' ROLL HALL OF FAME 1999<br>
THE FOURTEENTH ANNUAL INDUCTION DINNER</strong><br>
<br>
at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York City<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Bono inducting Bruce Springsteen into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame - Here's the speech:<br>
<br>
"He hasn't done the things most rock stars do. He got rich and famous, 
but never embarrassed himself with all that success, did he? No drug 
busts, no blood changes in Switzerland. Even more remarkable, no 
golfing! No bad hair period, even in the '80s. No wearing of dresses in 
videos ... No embarrassing movie roles, no pet snakes, no monkeys. No 
exhibitions of his own paintings. No public brawling or setting himself 
on fire ... <br>
"Rock stars are supposed to make soap operas of their lives, aren't 
they? If they don't kill themselves first. Well, you can't be a big 
legend and not be dysfunctional. It's not allowed. You should at least 
have lost your looks. Everyone else has. Have you seen them? It's like 
Madame Tussaud's back there. <br>
"Then there's Bruce Springsteen. Handsome mother with those brooding 
brown eyes, eyes that could see through America. And a catastrophe of 
great songs, if you were another songwriter. Bruce has played every bar 
in the U.S.A., and every stadium. Credibility -- you couldn't have more,
 unless you were dead. But Bruce Springsteen, you always knew, was not 
gonna die stupid. He didn't buy the mythology that screwed so many 
people. Instead he created an alternative mythology, one where ordinary 
lives became extraordinary and heroic. Bruce Springsteen, you were 
familiar to us. But it's not an easy familiarity, is it? Even his band 
seems to stand taller when he walks in the room. It's complex. He's 
America's writer, and critic. It's like in 'Badlands,' he's Martin Sheen
 and Terrence Malick. To be so accessible and so private ... But then 
again, he is an Irish-Italian, with a Jewish-sounding name. What more do
 you want? Add one big African sax player, and no one in this room is 
gonna (mess around) with you! "In 1974, I was 14. Even I knew the '60s 
were over. It was the era of soft-rock and fusion. The Beatles was gone,
 Elvis was in Vegas. What was goin' on? Nothin' was goin' on. Bruce 
Springsteen was comin' on, saving music from the phonies, saving lyrics 
from the folkies, saving leather jackets from the Fonz. (Sings) 'Now the
 greasers, they tramp the streets and get busted for sleeping on the 
beaches all night, and them boys in their high heels, ah Sandy, their 
skins are so white. Oh Sandy, love me tonight, and I promise I'll love 
you forever.' In Dublin, Ireland, I knew what he was talking about. Here
 was a dude who carried himself like Brando, and Dylan, and Elvis. If 
John Steinbeck could sing, if Van Morrison could ride a Harley-Davidson 
.... It was something new, too. He was the first whiff of Scorsese, the 
first hint of Patti Smith, Elvis Costello and the Clash. He was the end 
of long hair, brown rice and bell bottoms. It was the end of the 
20-minute drum solo. It was good night, Haight- Ashbury; hello, Asbury 
Park. <br>
"America was staggering when Springsteen appeared. The president just 
resigned in disgrace, the U.S. had lost its first war. There was going 
to be no more oil in the ground. The days of cruising and big cars were 
supposed to be over. But Bruce Springsteen's vision was bigger than a 
Honda, it was bigger than a Subaru. Bruce made you believe that dreams 
were still out there, but after loss and defeat, they had to be braver, 
not just bigger. He was singing 'Now you're scared and you're thinking 
that maybe we ain't that young anymore,' because it took guts to be 
romantic now. Knowing you could lose didn't mean you still didn't take 
the ride. In fact, it made taking the ride all the more important. <br>
"Here was a new vision, and a new community. More than a community, 
because every great rock group is kind of like starting a religion. and 
Bruce surrounded himself with fellow believers. The E Street -- it 
wasn't just a great rock group, or a street gang. It was a brotherhood. 
Zealots like Steve Van Zandt, the bishop Clarence Clemons, the holy Roy 
Bittan, crusaders Danny Federici, Max Weinberg, Garry Tallent and later 
Nils Lofgren. And Jon Landau, Jon Landau, Jon Landau, Jon Landau, Jon 
Landau. What do you call a man who makes his best friend his manager, 
his producer, his confessor? You call him the Boss. And Springsteen 
didn't just marry a gorgeous red-headed woman from the Jersey Shore. She
 could sing, she could write, and she could tell the Boss off. <br>
"For me and the rest of the U2-ers, it wasn't just the way he described 
the world. It was the way he negotiated it. It was a map, a book of 
instructions on how to be in the business but not of it. Generous is a 
word you could use to describe the way he treated us. Decency is 
another. But these words can box you in. I remember when Bruce was 
headlining Amnesty International's tour for prisoners of conscience, I 
remember thinking 'Wow, if ever there was a prisoner of conscience, it's
 Bruce Springsteen.' Integrity can be a yoke, a pain...when your songs 
are taking you to a part of town where people don't expect to see you. <br>
"At some point I remember riding in an elevator with gentleman Bruce, 
where he just stared straight ahead of himself, and completely ignored 
me. I was crushed. Only when he walked into the doors as they were 
opening, did I realize the impossible was happening. My god, Bruce 
Springsteen, the Buddha of my youth, is plastered! Drunk as a skunk! ...
 I have to go back to the book of instructions, scratch the bit out 
about how you held yourself in public. By the way, that was a great 
relief. <br>
"Something was going on, though. As a fan I could see that my hero was 
beginning to rebel against his own public image. Things got even more 
interesting on 'Tunnel of Love,' when he started to deface it. A 
remarkable bunch of tunes, where our leader starts having a go at 
himself, and the hypocrisy of his own heart, before anyone else could. 
But the tabloids could never break news on Bruce Springsteen. Because 
his fans... he had already told us everything in the songs. We knew he 
was spinning. We could feel him free-falling. But it wasn't in chaos or 
entropy. It was in love. <br>
"We call him the Boss. Well that's a bunch of crap. He's not the boss. 
He works for us. More than a boss, he's the owner, because more than 
anyone else, Bruce Springsteen owns America's heart."<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Bruce Springsteen:</span><br>
<br>
Remember: You always want an Irishman to give your induction speech ... I
 knew I always liked you, Bono. You were scaring me a little bit there 
--- I wasn't that good -- but I like the part about my good looks. 
Anyway, let me warn you. The records took two years, the show's three 
hours, so the speech may take a little while. <br>
I stood on this stage and I inducted Roy Orbison, and Creedence 
Clearwater Revival, and Bob Dylan -- artists whose music was a critical 
part of my own like -- and tonight I hope that my music served my 
audience half as well. And if I've succeeded in doing that, it's been 
with the help of many, many kindred spirits along the way. I'd like to 
thank my mother, Adele, for that slushy Christmas Eve ... for that 
Christmas Eve and night like the one outside, when we stood outside the 
music store and I pointed to that Sunburst guitar and she had that 60 
bucks and I said, "I need that one, Ma." She got me -- she got me what I
 needed, and she protected me and provided for me on a thousand other 
days and nights. So ... As importantly, she gave me a sense of work as 
something that was joyous and that filled you with pride and 
self-regard, and that committed you to your world. Thanks Mom. This is 
yours tonight. Take is home as a small return on the investment you made
 in your son. Momma ... The Italian side of the family ... Momma ... <br>
Now my dad, he passed away this year, but I've gotta thank him because 
--- what would I conceivably have written about without him? I mean, you
 can imagine that if everything had gone great between us, we would have
 had disaster. I would have written just happy songs -- and I tried it 
in the early '90s and it didn't work; the public didn't like it. He 
never said much about my music, except that his favorite songs were the 
ones about him. And that was enough, you know? Anyway, I put on his work
 clothes and I went to work. It was the way that I honored him. My 
parents' experience forged my own. They shaped my politics, and they 
alerted me to what is at stake when you're born in the U.S.A. I miss you
 Dad. <br>
A lot of other people: Marion and Tex Vinyard. They took me under their 
wing when I was 15. They opened up their home to a bunch of rock and 
roll misfits and let us make a lot of noise and practice all night long.
 Thanks Marion. Carl "Tinker" West, another one of my early managers, 
whose support I couldn't have done without. He introduced me to Mike 
Appel, and Mike kicked the doors down when they needed kicking. And I 
consider him my friend; I want to say Mike, thanks for everything -- 
mostly everything --- and thanks for being my guest here tonight. I'm 
glad you're here with me. Mike introduced me to the world of Columbia 
Records, which has been my home for the past 25 years -- from the early 
days of John Hammond and Clive Davis to the high-rollin' years of Walter
 Yetnikoff and Al Teller, to the present with my friends Tommy Mottola 
and Donny Ienner. They created a conduit for a lifetime of thoughts and 
ideas, a place where I was ... I felt safe and supported and encouraged 
to do my best and my truest work. And I've heard enough record company 
horror stories right from this stage to realize, to appreciate the fact 
that I don't have one. And for that I've gotta thank all the men and 
women at Columbia Records around the world, past and present. Thank you 
very much for your efforts. I've gotta thank my co-producer, Chuck 
Plotkin, (and) engineer Toby Scott for their sustained contributors to 
my recorded work. They remained in the saddle as often years went by, 
wondering if we'd ever get the music or if they'd ever get a royalty 
check. They kept their cool and their creativity ... of course they're 
basket cases now ... but we remain friends and great working partners. 
And no mention of my records would be complete without Bob 
Clearmountain, a great mixer who helped me bring my music to a wider 
audience. I want to thank my tour director, George Travis, and the great
 crews he's assembled on the road over the years. Thank you George. I 
want to thank my agents, Barry Bell and Frank Barsalona, for a great 
job. All right ... Thank you ... Now the lawyers -- gotta thank them. 
Peter Parcher and Steve Hayes. They protected me and my music for 22 
years. I appreciate it. This next one's a little tough. Allen Grubman 
and Artie Indursky, names familiar to many in this room. They're the 
money men. How can I put this? These are great and complicated and 
misunderstood Americans ... They're men that are entrusted with a very, 
very important task. For the folks that don't know, the money man goes 
to the record company, and he's in charge of bringing back the pink 
Cadillac. Well, when Allen and Artie go, they bring back the pink 
Cadillac ... and the blue Cadillac ... and the yellow Cadillac ... and 
the red Cadillac ... and the pink Cadillac with the whitewalls ... but 
then they take the blue Cadillac ... and they take the hubcaps off the 
yellow Cadillac ... but that still leaves you with a few Cadillacs. And 
they make sure that neither you nor themselves, of course, are gonna be 
broke when you're riding in the black Cadillac. So ... they do that 
well. I've gotta thank Barbara Carr for her love and loyalty and 
dedication. Couldn't get along without you Barb. My friend Dave Marsh: 
Thank you so much. <br>
And oh, the next guy. Yeah. This is ... Jon Landau, or as I sometimes 
call him, Jon "Thank God I'm a Country Boy" Landau. I've seen the future
 of rock 'n' roll management, and its name is Jon Landau ... I had to 
return the favor there. But that was -- that quote was managing, it was a
 mite burdensome for me. But as he often said, "That's your job." But 
Jon's given me something beyond friendship and beyond guidance: his 
intelligence, his sense of the truth, his recognition of my 
intelligence. His creative ability as a producer and editor -- 
speechwriter earlier this evening -- his ability to see through to the 
heart of matters, both professional and personal, and the love that he's
 given me has altered my life forever. What I hope to give to my fans 
with my music -- a greater sense of themselves and and greater freedom 
-- he with his talents and his abilities has done that for me. There's 
no thank you tonight that's gonna do the job, and it's a debt that I 
can't repay -- and one I treasure always. Thank you Jon. I love you. I 
also want to thank Barbara Landau, and Kate and Charlie, for sharing Jon
 with me over the years. I know it hasn't been easy. <br>
Now, last but not least, the men and women -- the mighty men and women 
--- of the E Street Band. Oh Lord ... Oh Lord ... who I have reeducated 
and rededicated, reanimated, resuscitated and reinvigorated with the 
power, the magic, the mystery, the ministry of rock 'n' roll. Vini 
Lopez, Boom Carter -- early drummers of the band. Davey Sancious. Nils 
Lofgren, the most overqualified second guitarist in show business. He 
plays 10 times better than me and he still wanders over to hear my solos
 when I play. I guess he's checking to see if I'm getting any better. 
Danny Federici, the most instinctive and natural musician I ever met and
 the only member of the band who can reduce me to a shouting mess. I 
love you Danny. Your organ and accordion playing brought the boardwalks 
of Central and South Jersey alive in my music. Thank you. Garry Tallent.
 Southern man, my lovely friend, bass player, rock 'n' roll aficionado, 
whose quiet and dignity graced my band and my life. Thank you Garry. Roy
 Bittan. Roy's playing formed the signature sound of some of my greatest
 records. He can play anything. He's always there for me. His emotional 
generosity and his deep personal support mean a great, great deal to me.
 Thank you Roy. Max Weinberg -- Mighty Max. Star of the Conan O'Brien 
show. Conan ain't too bad either ... Max found a place where Bernard 
Purdie, Buddy Rich and Keith Moon intersected and he made it his own. I 
ask and he delivers for me night after night. Thank you Max. Stevie Van 
Zandt. For those of you who have seen "The Sopranos" and are worried 
that that's what Steve is like ... that's what he's like. He's a 
lifetime rock 'n' roll friendship. We did it all, you know. Great 
songwriter, producer, great guitarist. We haven't played together in 15 
years, and if it's up to me, that won't ever happen again. I love you 
Steve. Patti Scialfa. She busted the boys' club, big time. Oh ... It 
went like this: "Okay fellas. There's gonna be a woman in the band. We 
need someone to sing all the high parts. How complicated can it get?" 
Well, a nice paparazzi photo of me in my Jockey shorts on a balcony in 
Rome ... 10 of the best years of my life ... Evan, Jessie and Sam, three
 children genealogically linked to the E Street Band ... tell the rest 
of the story. Everybody ... everybody wants to know how I feel about the
 band. Hell, I married one of 'em. Thank you baby. You hit all the high 
notes. You're tougher than the rest. Oh now ... last but not least, 
Clarence Clemons. That's right. You want to be like him but you can't, 
you know. The night I met Clarence, he got up on stage (and) a sound 
came out of his horn that seemed to rattle the glasses behind the bar, 
and threatened to blow out the back wall. The door literally blew off 
the club in a storm that night, and I knew I'd found my sax player. But 
there was something else, something -- something happened when we stood 
side by side. Some ... some ... some energy, some unspoken story. For 15
 years Clarence has been a source of myth and light and enormous 
strength for me on stage. He has filled my heart so many night -- so 
many nights -- and I love it when he wraps me in those arms at the end 
of the night. That night we first stood together, I looked over at C and
 it looked like his head reached into the clouds. And I felt like a mere
 mortal scurrying upon the earth, you know. But he always lifted me up. 
Way, way, way up. Together we told a story of the possibilities of 
friendship, a story older than the ones that I was writing and a story I
 could never have told without him at my side. I want to thank you, Big 
Man, and I love you so much. So, as Stevie Van Zandt says: "Rock 'n' 
roll, it's a band thing." And that includes you, the audience. Thank you
 for giving me access and entrance into your lives, and I hope that I've
 been a good companion. But right now, my wife, my great friends, my 
great collaborators, my great band: Your presence tonight honors me, and
 I wouldn't be standing up here tonight without you, and I can't stand 
up here tonight with you.<br>
Please join me.<br>
Oh Jonny ... you too.</div>

it's a mythical landscape that everybody carries with them."</div></blockquote>

And on the LA Riots:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The band were ensconced in this 
rehearsal hall the afternoon of April 30 when the LA riots began. "You 
can go five blocks that way and you'll see burned out buildings. That 
was the day when all the invisible walls that get put up -- LA is 
actually a very segregated city -- all the walls started falling. You 
can feel them starting to melt away. The inner cities are reaching a 
critical mass at this point. People have been abandoned, thrown away, 
tossed out. The way that people have dealt with it over the past 10 
years has just been denial. That's not happening here, that's happening 
over there. The answer has been, let's get more police, let's build 
bigger prisons.

Under the Boss' Skin<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen talks about his reunion tour, recording plans and the 
recent controversy over a new song about the tensions of race relations 
in America<br>
<br>
<br>
by Robert Hilburn<br>
<br>
Wanting a new song for the final shows of his 1999-2000 reunion tour 
with the E Street Band, Bruce Springsteen thumbed through his notebook 
early last year and noticed the words "American Skin." It felt like the 
ideal title for a song he wanted write about race relations in America.<br>
<br>
In drafting the song, Springsteen drew on images from a highly 
publicized 1999 incident in which four white New York City policemen 
shot an unarmed black West African immigrant, Amadou Diallo, 41 times. 
The officers said they mistook the wallet in Diallo's hand for a gun.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and the band played the song in Atlanta and New York, and it
 became a cause célèbre when the president of the New York chapter of 
the Fraternal Order of Police, misinterpreting the song as an attack on 
law enforcement, labeled Springsteen a "dirt bag."<br>
<br>
"American Skin (41 Shots)" arrives on record this week, on a two-disc 
live album that will be released Tuesday by Columbia Records. It's one 
of the most evocative songs of Springsteen's career – a tense, chilling 
work that carries the documentary feel of his best "Nebraska" and "The 
Ghost of Tom Joad" narratives.<br>
<br>
The tune is a highlight of Springsteen's first TV concert special, which
 airs Saturday on HBO. Recorded at the New York shows, both the special 
and the album capture marvelously the intensity and character of the 
tour.<br>
<br>
The key to the reunion's success was that Springsteen and the 
eight-member band looked forward, not back, using new and relatively 
unfamiliar tunes to define his themes of commitment and community.<br>
<br>
In an interview, Springsteen, 51, spoke about "American Skin," the tour 
and the future. He and his wife, singer-guitarist Patti Scialfa, still 
have a home in Los Angeles, but they and their three children (ages 7 to
 10) spend most of their time at their home in New Jersey.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Question: Did you anticipate the controversy over "American Skin (41 Shots)"?<br>
<br>
Answer: No, I was surprised because the Diallo incident had been written
 about extensively in newspapers and magazines, and I felt the song was 
simply an extension of the music I had been writing for my whole life. 
It was a meditation on what it means to be an American at a particular 
moment in time.<br>
It struck me as almost funny that all these people would go on the 
record about something they never heard, since there was no record of it
 out. The song had only been played once in Atlanta when the uproar 
began. We were rehearsing for the New York shows and [guitarist] Steve 
[Van Zandt] brought in these [news]papers and we both went, "Holy cow. 
What's going on here?"<br>
<br>
Q: What was your purpose in writing the song?<br>
<br>
A: It felt to me like the most necessary issue to deal with at the turn 
of the century was the question of race in America and how we deal with 
one another. To some degree, the answer to that question is going to 
decide a lot about how the nation as a whole eventually rises or falls.<br>
I wanted to point out that people of color are viewed through a veil of 
criminality and that ultimately means they are thought of as somehow 
less American than other Americans, therefore people with less rightsNot
 just by law enforcement but the guy behind the counter at the 
convenience store and whoever.<br>
The first verse is about people trying to cross the river of race, and 
how the river is tainted with blood. The second verse is about a mother 
sending her child to school, having to give very specific instructions 
about how to act. It's so painful for her because most people assume 
their children will be safe, but she can't make that assumption. She 
knows the slightest movement or slightest misunderstanding could mean 
the end of your life.<br>
<br>
Q: What about the presidential election? Did you feel strongly about either candidate?<br>
<br>
A: Well, it goes without saying that I'd rather we didn't have a Republican president.<br>
<br>
Q: Do you think George W. Bush's election will lead to renewed activism in pop and rock?<br>
<br>
A: I don't know how that plays itself out in the musical world exactly. 
I've read that "Nebraska" was my response to the Reagan years. It may 
have been, but I wasn't thinking about that directly when I was writing.
 I was just thinking about the things I cared about that were not being 
voiced in some fashion. I think that's a songwriter's job.<br>
<br>
Q: Before we talk about the reunion tour, let's go back to the 1992 tour
 you did with a different band. Did it hurt you when so many of your 
fans wouldn't accept you or the albums or the other musicians you toured
 with?<br>
<br>
A: I don't take it personally in that fashion. I have a long 
relationship with an audience out there that is going to feel a whole 
variety of different ways about things I do. That's family life, you 
know [laughs]. I don't feel that someone must accept what I'm doing at a
 given moment 'cause they like what I did in the past. The [change] was 
just something I felt I had to do.<br>
<br>
Q: I've had this theory that you got the idea for taking time off from 
the band while on the Amnesty International tour and seeing how much 
Sting grew musically after leaving the Police. Did that have an impact 
on your thinking?<br>
<br>
A: It might have. Sting moved a lot between musicians and seemed to get a
 lot of enjoyment out of it, plus I met a lot of different musicians on 
that tour. There were some very admirable players, all with their own 
voices doing different things. By that time in the late '80s, I felt I 
knew this voice I had with the E Street Band and I didn't at the time 
have any idea of where to take that voice forward. So, I wondered what 
it would be like to play with other musicians. And I enjoyed the 
experience tremendously.<br>
<br>
Q: How intimidating was the prospect of the reunion tour? These things 
usually seem like nostalgia exercises or desperate attempts for a final 
payday. Why did you think yours would be perceived differently?<br>
<br>
A: I was very aware of the dangers, but I had a lot of confidence in 
this band. We had played together sporadically, like when we released 
the greatest-hits album, and the guys sounded great. The challenge was 
to put the music into a contemporary context. That was always on my 
mind.<br>
At the first rehearsal, all we did was play unfamiliar material—songs 
from the "Tracks" album [of previously unreleased material] or new ideas
 I had floating around. Then occasionally we would hit on things we had 
played in the past. The thrilling thing was seeing how good the band was
 playing. If you saw us on that tour, you saw us at our best.<br>
<br>
Q: That's hard for a lot of people to accept. It goes against the idea 
that people make their best rock music in their 20s. What's your feeling
 about that?<br>
<br>
A: There may be some truth to the fact that you may write some of your 
greatest songs at that age, but it doesn't mean that you won't also 
write great songs later, or that the band's playing won't get even 
better. If a band stays healthy and takes what they do seriously, it 
only figures that you are going to get better at it. I think we had that
 idea early—that we were going to be around for a long time.<br>
<br>
Q: Do you think that's also why your writing seemed to have a timelessness about it?<br>
<br>
A: Well, I was conscious of writing songs that I could sing for years. 
That might have been something I got from country musicPeople like Hank 
Williams. I wanted to write songs that I could get on stage and sing 
when I was 40 or 45, songs that I could even add to because of the 
experiences I'd have.<br>
<br>
Q: How hard was it not to lose perspective during the enormous success of the "Born in the U.S.A." experience?<br>
<br>
A: Not as hard as the "Born to Run" period because I was older. I was 35
 and had already been through quite a bit. I felt I was going on a very 
big ride, but I saw it as a challenge. My heroes were people like Bob 
Dylan and Elvis Presley or the great soul heroes—people who took a very 
large risk by accepting that exposure. They went after what they could. 
They claimed as big a part of the country for themselves as their 
abilities and their talents allowed. I found something admirable about 
that. They had tremendous influence and tremendous success at doing so 
and redefining what it meant to be an American for a lot of people in 
their audience.<br>
<br>
Q: This is your first TV special. Why didn't you do it earlier?<br>
<br>
A: In the early days, I just thought television was fundamentally a cool
 medium and what we did involved heat and passion and getting your blood
 up. But there have been a lot of breakthroughs in technology that made 
the idea of filming more inviting. The "Tom Joad" tour was a tremendous 
experience for me, and I felt very badly that we didn't film one of the 
shows. But I don't think we decided to film this show until the last 
week or two. The idea was just to see how it'd look, maybe just keep it 
for ourselves. But when I looked at it, I felt we caught an awful lot of
 the band's excitement, the heat and the passion.<br>
<br>
Q: So you'll be on HBO with Steve Van Zandt and "The Sopranos." Since 
he's in the cast, have they invited you to do a guest shot on the show?<br>
<br>
A: No [laughs]. It's a fabulous show. Steve has me in stitches every 
week on the thing. To me, it's one of the best things ever on TV—the 
level of writing is so rare, the level of psychological depth, the 
questions they are consistently able to bring up , very impressive, very
 hard to do on a consistent basis. I watch it all the time.<br>
<br>
Q: What about the other new song on the album? When did you write "Land of Hope and Dreams"?<br>
<br>
A: During rehearsal, just a couple of days before we played those 
[warm-up shows] in Asbury Park. I needed something brand new that was 
going to restate our purpose and our ideas on the tour. Literally, we 
were on stage and I was just kind of strumming that riff. The title had 
also been in my notebook for a couple of years.<br>
<br>
Q: What about your next album?<br>
<br>
A: I'm always wrong when I give a date, but I don't see why it should be
 too far away—certainly not the two or three years that it sometimes 
took us in the past. I wrote some songs toward the end of the tour, and I
 have some songs from when I worked with Joe Grushecky. We played a 
couple of those, "Code of Silence" and "Another Thin Line." Then I have 
some songs written before the tour, when I was already thinking about 
playing again with the band. "Further on Up the Road" is one of those 
from the New York show.<br>
I also have another acoustic album in the works, but right now I want to get with the guys and see what happens in the studio.<br>
<br>
Q: In 1995, you said one of the great lessons you learned after you 
finally had a family was that giving 100% to your job wasn't the same as
 giving 100% of your life to your job. Did you find yourself slipping 
back into obsessing about the music once you got back on the road?<br>
<br>
A: No, no. I think once you learn that lesson you don't tend to go back 
to that place, though I could never explain that to a young artist. I 
think the fear when you are young is you will somehow be diminished by 
separating your energy into this and that. In truth, it expands who you 
are and what you can do, your connection to the world, the way you see 
things, and all those feelings get funneled back into your music, so 
connecting with your family or someone you love enriches both your life 
and your music.<br>

"We've Been Misled"<br>
<br>
Springsteen talks about his conscience, and the nature of an artist and his audience<br>
<br>
by Jann S. Wenner<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Do you see these Vote for Change concerts reaching undecided voters, or 
are they more to rally the energy of people who have made up their 
minds?<br>
<br>
I always felt that the musician's job, as I experienced it growing up, 
was to provide an alternative source of information, a spiritual and 
social rallying place, somewhere you went to have a communal experience.<br>
<br>
I don't know if someone is going to run to the front of the stage and 
shout, "I'm saved" or "I'm switching," but I'm going to try. I will be 
calling anyone in a bow tie to come to the front of the stage, and I'll 
see what I can do.<br>
<br>
In a practical sense, what are you accomplishing?<br>
<br>
First of all, we have a large group of musicians - Dave Matthews, the 
Dixie Chicks, Pearl Jam, R.E.M., John Fogerty, James Taylor and many 
others - who are coming together as a rallying point for change. I think
 the concerts are going to be an energizing experience for all who come.
 Of course, I've met a few people who, in a very friendly way, said they
 are not coming.<br>
<br>
Basically, the concerts are raising money specifically for America 
Coming Together to do very practical things: voter education, to go out 
and mobilize voters, to go door-to-door, to assist voters getting to the
 polls. They're the real foot soldiers who are going to get out the 
progressive vote. That's probably the concerts' most important result.<br>
<br>
Why did you stay away from being actively involved in partisan politics for so long?<br>
<br>
I didn't grow up in a very political household. The only politics I 
heard was from my mother. I came home from grade school, where someone 
asked me if I was Republican or Democrat, and I asked my mom, "Well, 
what are we?" She said, "We're Democrats, 'cause Democrats are for the 
working people." I was politicized by the Sixties, like most of the 
other people of that generation at that time. I can remember doing a 
concert when I was probably in my very late teens, helping to bus people
 down to Washington for an anti-war demonstration.<br>
<br>
But still, basically, I wanted to remain an independent voice for the 
audience that came to my shows. We've tried to build up a lot of 
credibility over the years, so that if we took a stand on something, 
people would receive it with an open mind. Part of not being 
particularly partisan was just an effort to remain a very thoughtful 
voice in my fans' lives.<br>
<br>
I always liked being involved actively more at a grass-roots level, to 
act as a partisan for a set of ideals: civil rights, economic justice, a
 sane foreign policy, democracy. That was the position I felt 
comfortable coming from.<br>
<br>
Did it make you more credible if you avoided endorsing an individual?<br>
<br>
It makes people less likely to marginalize you or pigeonhole you. Taking
 a definite stand on this election has probably provided some extra 
definition to the work I've been doing over the years. Our band is in 
pretty much what I think of as the center. So if I wrote, say, "American
 Skin," which was controversial, it couldn't easily be dismissed, 
because people had faith that I was a measured voice. That's been worth 
something, and it's something I don't want to lose. But we have drifted 
far from that center, and this is a time to be very specific about where
 I stand.<br>
<br>
Because you scrupulously avoided commercial use of your music, you built
 a reputation for integrity and conscience. You must be aware of the 
potency of that. I tried to build a reputation for thoughtfulness - that
 was the main thing I was aiming for. I took the songs, the issues and 
the people I was writing about seriously. I wanted it to be an 
entertaining but thoughtful presentation. If there was a goal, it was as
 simple as that.<br>
<br>
Now you're asking your audience to think even more about and explore what else you're saying in your songs.<br>
<br>
There are a portion of your fans who do quite a bit of selective 
listening. That's the way that people use pop music, and that's part of 
the way it rolls. The upside is that there has been an increased 
definition about the things I've written about and where I stand on 
certain issues. That's been a good thing.<br>
<br>
I think that a more complicated picture of who you are as an artist and 
who they are as an audience emerges. The example I've been giving is 
that I've been an enormous fan of John Wayne all my life, although not a
 fan of his politics. I've made a place for all those different parts of
 who he was. I find deep inspiration and soulfulness in his work.<br>
<br>
Your audience invests a lot in you, a very personal investment. There is
 nothing more personal, in some ways, than the music people listen to. I
 know from my own experience how you identify and relate to the person 
singing. You have put your fingerprints on their imagination. That is 
very, very intimate. When something cracks the mirror, it can be hard 
for the fan who you have asked to identify with you.<br>
<br>
Pop musicians live in the world of symbology. You live and die by the 
symbol in many ways. You serve at the behest of your audience's 
imagination. It's a complicated relationship. So you're asking people to
 welcome the complexity in the interest of fuller and more honest 
communication.<br>
<br>
The audience and the artist are valuable to one another as long as you 
can look out there and see yourself, and they look back and see 
themselves. That's asking quite a bit, but that is what happens. When 
that bond is broken, by your own individual beliefs, personal thoughts 
or personal actions, it can make people angry. As simple as that. You're
 asking for a broader, more complicated relationship with the members of
 your audience than possibly you've had in the past.<br>
<br>
What do you stand to lose or gain from this as an artist?<br>
<br>
As an artist and a citizen, you're gaining a chance to take part in 
moving the country in the direction of its deepest ideals. Artists are 
always speaking to people's freedoms. The shout for freedom and its 
implications was implicit in rock &amp; roll from its inception. Freedom
 can only find its deepest meaning within a community of purpose. So as 
an individual I'm getting to take a small part in that process.<br>
<br>
As an artist, I'd like to have a broader understanding with all the 
different segments of my audience and have a deeper experience when we 
come out and play for people. I think that's something that could be 
gained, and that's something worth doing. I tend to think a relatively 
small amount of people might get turned off by it, 'cause I've tried to 
do this as thoughtfully as possible, and because any relationship worth 
something can take some rough-and-tumble. We'll see.<br>
<br>
This has obviously been on your mind for a while. How did you come to this decision?<br>
<br>
I knew after we invaded Iraq that I was going to be involved in the 
election. It made me angry. We started to talk about it onstage. I take 
my three minutes a night for what I call my public-service announcement.
 We talked about it almost every night on our summer tour.<br>
<br>
I felt we had been misled. I felt they had been fundamentally dishonest 
and had frightened and manipulated the American people into war. And as 
the saying goes, "The first casualty of war is truth." I felt that the 
Bush doctrine of pre-emption was dangerous foreign policy. I don't think
 it has made America safer.<br>
<br>
Look at what is going on now: We are quickly closing in on what looks an
 awful lot like the Vietnamization of the Iraq war. John McCain is 
saying we could be there for ten or twenty years, and John Kerry says 
four years. How many of our best young people are going to die between 
now and that time, and what exactly for? Initially I thought I was going
 to take my acoustic guitar and play in some theaters, find some 
organizations to work for and do what I could. I was going to lend my 
voice for a change in the administration and a change in the direction 
of the country.<br>
<br>
Sitting on the sidelines would be a betrayal of the ideas I'd written 
about for a long time. Not getting involved, just sort of maintaining my
 silence or being coy about it in some way, just wasn't going to work 
this time out. I felt that it was a very clear historical moment.<br>
<br>
So there wasn't a moment of doubt in your mind about what the right thing to do was?<br>
<br>
It was something that gestated over a period of time, and as events 
unfolded and the election got closer, it became clearer. I don't want to
 watch the country devolve into an oligarchy, watch the division of 
wealth increase and see another million people beneath the poverty line 
this year. These are all things that have been the subtext of so much of
 my music, and to see the country move so quickly to the right, so much 
further to the right than what the president campaigned on - these are 
the things that removed whatever doubt I may have had about getting 
involved.<br>
<br>
Are you expecting to have your motives severely criticized?<br>
<br>
That's just a part of what happens. You understand you're going to be 
attacked in different ways. That just comes with it. That wasn't any 
concern.<br>
<br>
Do you think there is a climate of trying to intimidate artists and creative people?<br>
<br>
People are always trying to shut up the people they don't agree with - 
through any means necessary, usually. There certainly was an attempt to 
intimidate the Dixie Chicks. What happened to them was a result of war 
fever – simple as that, war fever. They've handled it incredibly. They 
are very smart, tough women, and they did not back down. But it's one of
 those sad paradoxes that in theory we're fighting for freedom, and the 
first thing people are willing to throw out is freedom of speech at home
 and castigate anybody who is coming from a different point of view.<br>
<br>
A lot of people think that you have no right as an artist to comment on 
this or play a role in politics. I don't know if a lot of people think 
that. It is something that is said. It's sort of part of the "Punch and 
Judy" show that goes on when people disagree with what you're saying.<br>
<br>
How much do you follow this election?<br>
<br>
I think that Senator Kerry has long played it close to the vest, and 
that's his style. However, the presidency is like the heavyweight 
championship: They don't give it to you, you have to take it. He has a 
slow, deliberate style that may not make for an electrifying campaigner,
 but it may make for a very good president. But, of course, you have to 
get there.<br>
<br>
One of the most disturbing aspects of this election is that the 
machinery for taking something that is a lie and making it feel true, or
 taking something that is true and making it feel like a lie - the 
selling machinery has become very powerful. Senator Kerry has to make 
people pay attention to the man behind the curtain. He has to take the 
risk and rip the veil off the administration's deceptions. They are a 
hall of mirrors and a house of cards.<br>
<br>
For Senator Kerry, the good news is he has the facts on his side. The 
bad news is that often in the current climate it can feel like that 
doesn't matter, and he has to make it matter.<br>
<br>
What do you think of how the election is being covered and conducted through the press?<br>
<br>
The press has let the country down. It's taken a very amoral stand, in 
that essential issues are often portrayed as simply one side says this 
and the other side says that. I think that Fox News and the Republican 
right have intimidated the press into an incredible self-consciousness 
about appearing objective and backed them into a corner of sorts where 
they have ceded some of their responsibility and righteous power.<br>
<br>
The Washington Post and New York Times apologies about their initial 
reporting about Iraq not being critical enough were very revealing. I am
 a dedicated Times reader, and I've found enormous sustenance from Paul 
Krugman and Maureen Dowd on the op-ed page. There has been great 
reporting, but there has also been some self-consciousness in some of 
the reporting about the policy differences in this election.<br>
<br>
This is going to be an issue after the election. I don't know if it 
began with the Iraq War, but shortly thereafter there was an enormous 
amount of Fox impersonators among what you previously thought were 
relatively sane media outlets across the cable channels. It was very 
disheartening. The job of the press is to tell the truth without fear or
 favor. We have to get back to that standard.<br>
<br>
The free press is supposed to be the lifeline and the blood of 
democracy. That is the position of responsibility that those 
institutions have. Those things are distorted by ratings and by money to
 where you're getting one hour of the political conventions. No matter 
how staged they are, I think they're a little more important than people
 eating bugs. I think that for those few nights, the political life of 
the nation should take priority, and the fact that it so casually does 
not means something is wrong. If you want to watch people eating bugs, 
that's fine, I can understand that, too, but let's do it on another 
night.<br>
<br>
Real news is the news we need to protect our freedoms. You get tabloid 
news, you get blood-and-guts news, you get news shot through with a 
self-glorifying facade of patriotism, but people have to sift too much 
for the news that we need to protect our freedoms. It should be 
gloriously presented to the people on a nightly basis. The loss of some 
of the soberness and seriousness of those institutions has had a 
devastating effect upon people's ability to respond to the events of the
 day.<br>
<br>
Do you think the press is leading us away from a fair and objective reading of this election?<br>
<br>
It's gotten very complicated, and I think it's blurred the truth. 
Whether you like the Michael Moore film or not, a big part of its value 
was that it showed how sanitized the war that we received on television 
at night is. The fact that the administration refused to allow 
photographs of the flag-draped coffins of returning dead, that the 
president hasn't shown up at a single military funeral for the young 
people who gave their lives for his policies, is disgraceful. You have 
the Swift-boat guys who have been pretty much discredited, but there is 
an atmosphere that is created by so much willing media exposure that it 
imparts them credibility.<br>
<br>
What do you think the responsibility of the artist is in society?<br>
<br>
There is a long tradition of the artist being involved in the life of 
the nation. For me, it goes back to Woody Guthrie, James Brown, Curtis 
Mayfield and Bob Dylan. These were all people who were alternative 
sources of information. When Dylan hit in the mid-Sixties, he brought 
with him as true a reading of what was going on as was out there.<br>
<br>
People have the choice to not listen, but you have these business 
lobbyists who affect the direction of public policy. For example, what 
is going on with the assault-rifle ban is disgusting. The labor unions 
try to affect policy in their fashion. Artists do it by talking and 
singing and addressing the life of the mind.<br>
<br>
I don't think the audience are lemmings. They get their various points 
of view from a lot of places. I try to come in and be that alternative 
source of information. I try to speak my case as directly as I can. If 
that makes you angry, that's fine. The artist is there to open up 
discourse, to get people thinking about American identity: Who are we? 
What do we fight for? What do we stand for? I view these things as a 
fundamental part of my job, and they have been for the past thirty 
years.<br>
<br>
You've tried to think long and hard about what it means to be an 
American and about our distinctive identity and position in the world. 
What is that great thing about America that appeals to you that you are 
fighting for?<br>
<br>
I felt I lived the prototypical American life - the way I grew up, the 
town I grew up in, my family life. Things that I cared about, things 
that I aspired to, they were just something that naturally came to me 
when I wrote. I think that this particular election is, at the core, a 
debate about the soul of the nation. I think we can move toward greater 
economic justice for all of our citizens, or we cannot. I think we can 
move toward a sane, responsible foreign policy, or we cannot. For me, 
these are issues that go right to the heart of the spiritual life of the
 nation. That is something I have written about. It cannot be abandoned 
and is worth fighting and fighting and fighting for.<br>
<br>
When you embark on a creative life, it has a dynamic of its own. You are
 partially directing it, and you are partially riding the wave. If your 
work is threaded into people's lives and into the life of your town, 
your family, your country, then you're like everybody else - you're at 
the mercy of events, you're borne along on the currents of time and 
history.<br>
<br>
It's sort of "Gee, I came from this place, I wrote songs about these 
things that mattered to me." I was serious about them. I was serious 
about taking what I had written and having some practical impact, which 
we started to do in the early Eighties. Nothing fancy. I can play my 
guitar, I can make a few bucks, I can bring some attention to some folks
 doing the real work and have some small impact in the towns we visit. 
You move down the road and it just sort of ... happens.<br>
<br>
Did you feel the call of your nation or the call of your community?<br>
<br>
I don't know. Personally, I wouldn't view myself as that kind of valuable.<br>
<br>
So you feel the call from your heart?<br>
<br>
Yeah, I can hear the bells chiming. I've had a long life with my 
audience. I always tell the story about the guy with The Rising: "Hey, 
Bruce, we need you!" he yelled at me through the car window. That's 
about the size of it: You get a few letters that say, "Hey, man, we need
 you." You bump into some people at a club and you say, "Hey, man, 
what's going on?" And they go, "Hey, we need you." Yeah, they don't 
really need me, but I'm proud if they need what I do. That's what my 
band is. That's what we were built for.<br>

				<div class="content">The Catholic Imagination of Bruce <br>
Springsteen<br>
From February 6, 1988<br>
ANDREW M. GREELEY | <br>
<br>
T he imagination is religious. Religion is imaginative. The origins and 
the power of both are in the playful, creative, dancing self. Once 
influenced by Catholic imagery, that self is forever Catholic. Hence, 
the popular rock star Bruce Springsteen, perhaps without knowing or 
understanding it, is a Catholic meistersinger.<br>
<br>
This essay is the third and final installment of an investigation I 
began last summer of the relationship between religious imagination and 
the persistent loyalty of American Catholics. ...In this essay, I want 
to complete the cycle by suggesting that there is a powerful link 
between religious imagery, which is created by the Sacraments, and works
 of artistic and literary creativity. I will do so by analyzing the most
 recent work of Bruce Springsteen and argue that a) his work is 
profoundly Catholic, and b) it is so because his creative imagination is
 permeated by Catholic symbolism he absorbed, almost necessarily, from 
the Sacraments.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is a liturgist, I propose, because he correlates the 
self-communication of God in secular life with the overarching 
symbol/narratives of his/our tradition. Moreover, I also propose that he
 engages in this "minstrel ministry" without ever being explicit about 
it, or even necessarily aware of it, precisely because his imagination 
was shaped as Catholic in the early years of life. He is both a 
liturgist, then, and a superb example of why Catholics cannot leave the 
church.<br>
<br>
…<br>
<br>
A word about the Catholic imagination: Unlike the other religions of 
Yahweh, Catholicism has always stood for the accessibility of God in the
 world. God is more like the world than unlike it. Hence Catholicism, 
unlike Protestantism, Judaism and Islam, permits angels and saints, 
shrines and statues, stained glass and incense and the continuation of 
pagan customs—most notably for our purposes here, holy water and blessed
 candles.<br>
<br>
The point is not that the Catholic sensibility is better or worse than 
other religious sensibilities, but different. Nor is the point that any 
of the sensibilities can survive provided they are integrated with the 
others. Finally, the point is not that Catholicism has any monopoly on 
light and water symbolism, but rather it emphasizes them more strongly 
than other traditions. No one else has holy water or blessed candles.<br>
<br>
Why did James Joyce use such rich Catholic imagery in his work (in, for 
example, the encounter with the girl on the beach at Clontarf), when he 
rejected the Catholic religion he learned in school and the Catholic 
Church he thought was destroying his Irish heritage? The answer is that 
he had absorbed much earlier in life a more primary, a more pristine 
and, yes, a more powerful and more benign version of Catholicism.<br>
<br>
In the context of religion (in its origins) as an exercise of the 
metaphor-making dynamisms, Bruce Springsteen’s album Tunnel of Love may 
be a more important Catholic event in this country than the visit of 
Pope John Paull! The Pope spoke of moral debates using the language of 
doctrinal propositions that appeal to (or repel) the mind. Springsteen 
sings of religious realities—sin, temptation, forgiveness, life, death, 
hope—in images that come (implicitly perhaps) from his Catholic 
childhood, images that appeal to the whole person, not just the head, 
and that will be absorbed by far more Americans than those who listened 
to the Pope.<br>
<br>
I intend no disrespect to the Pope or to the importance of his trip. I 
merely assert the obvious: Troubadours always have more impact than 
theologians or bishops, storytellers more influence than homilists.<br>
<br>
Some rock critics contend that Springsteen has turned away from the 
"positive" music of Born in the USA to return to the grimmer and more 
pessimistic mood of Nebraska. It might be debated how optimistic USA 
really was. But, while there is tragedy in Tunnel of Love, there is also
 hope. The water of the river still flows, but now it stands, not for 
death, but for rebirth. Light and water, the Easter and baptismal 
symbols of the Catholic liturgy, the combination of the male and female 
fertility principles, create life in Tunnel of Love.<br>
<br>
Religion is more explicitly expressed in Tunnel of Love than in any 
previous Springsteen album. Prayer, heaven and God are invoked naturally
 and unselfconsciously, as though they are an ordinary part of the 
singer’s life and vocabulary (and the singer is the narrator of the 
story told in the song, not necessarily Springsteen). Moreover, religion
 is invoked to deal precisely with those human (as opposed to doctrinal)
 problems—love, sin, death, rebirth—that humankind in its long history 
has always considered religious.<br>
<br>
On the subject of human sinfulness, Springsteen sounds like St. Paul, 
who lamented that "the good which I would do, I do not do; and the evil 
which I would not do, that I do."<br>
<br>
In "Two Faces" the singer complains that he is two men, one good, one 
evil; one sunny, one dark; one that says "hello" and one that says 
"goodbye." He fears that the evil face may deprive him of his love. He 
tells us that at night he gets down on his knees and prays that "love 
will make that other man go away," but admits that the other will never 
leave. For nearly 2,000 years in Western culture that experience has 
been called Original Sin—the only Christian doctrine, as the Lutheran 
church historian Martin Marty has remarked, for which there is empirical
 evidence.<br>
<br>
Springsteen returns to this theme in "One Step Up." The singer and his 
wife are alienated. She is no longer the girl in white outside the 
church, and the church bells are not ringing any more. The singer does 
not know who is to blame, but he is caught in his own guilt. He is not 
the man he wanted to be; somehow he has slipped off the track. He is 
trapped, "movin’ one step up and two steps back."<br>
<br>
In "Cautious Man" the singer (Billy) has tattooed the word "love" on one
 of his hands, and "fear" on the other. In autumn he marries his spring 
lover because he always "wanted to do what was right." But, "alone on 
his knees in the darkness for steadiness he’d pray / for he knew in a 
restless heart the seed of betrayal lay."<br>
<br>
One night, the fear tattoo got the better of him and he stole away from 
his marriage bed and strode down the highway. The road, in the symbolism
 of earlier Springsteen lyrics, is always the way to freedom. Now, when 
he gets there, "he didn’t find nothing but road."<br>
<br>
And in the title song of the album, the singer realizes how difficult 
married love is: It ought to be easy when a woman and a man fall in 
love, but they live in a haunted house and their ride in the tunnel of 
love is rough, rough, rough.<br>
<br>
In all these songs the singer discovers the tragedy of life in the 
conflict between the two men that St. Paul described 1,900 years ago. 
Tragedy, however, is not pessimism, not despair. It is still possible to
 fight back.<br>
<br>
Possible, but not easy. Love dies. "When it goes, it’s gone gone." And "when you’re alone, you ain’t nothing but alone."<br>
<br>
Despite his "Brilliant Disguise" the singer knows in the wee hours that 
he is not the good husband he swore to be at the altar, but a harsh 
doubter whose bed is cold. He invokes God’s mercy "on the man who doubts
 what he’s sure of." And he knows he is a fool. He may have all the 
riches in the world but he lacks his beloved: he “Ain’t Got You."<br>
<br>
If Springsteen left us there, the charge of despair might be 
appropriate. Theologically he might well be characterized as a Manichee,
 one who believes that human love is perverse and evil. But he does not 
stop at either sin or the difficulty in fighting sin. He sings of 
renewal, each time using the Easter/baptismal renewal symbols of light 
or flowing water—usually both of them.<br>
<br>
In the song "Spare Parts," Janey, a young mother deserted on her wedding
 day by her child’s father, bemoans her fate: She is young and misses 
the party lights. She hears of a woman who has put her baby in the river
 "and let the river roll on." She is tempted to do the same, she kneels 
before his crib and "cried till she prayed."<br>
<br>
Then, despite her prayer, Janey brings her son to the river. As in every
 case where he sings of hope, Springsteen becomes poetic: Waist deep in 
the running water, with the sun shining brightly above her, she lifts 
her son up to the sky and then carries him home. She lays him in his 
bed, takes her wedding dress and ring to the pawnshop and returns home 
with good cold cash.<br>
<br>
The story of the young mother, holding her son in the waters of the 
river under the bright sun, then lifting him up and carrying him home, 
now sanctified for life, is surely a baptismal image. How could it be 
anything else? Could someone not raised in the traditions of blessed 
light and holy water, not exposed as a child to the light and water of 
Easter, have produced such a scene?<br>
<br>
Sure.<br>
<br>
But the point here is that Bruce Springsteen did acquire this imagery in
 his Catholic childhood. Even if he is not aware of the Catholic 
symbolism of light and water (and I suspect that he may know what he is 
doing, but not quite know that he knows), he is using in Catholic 
fashion these profoundly Catholic symbols of his youth: He is using 
light and water as symbols of rebirth.<br>
<br>
Billy does not desert his wife. Knowing that he will always be caught 
between fear and love, he returns to his marriage bed and brushes the 
hair from his sleeping wife’s face, which the moon has turned to white. 
Her glowing face fills the room with the beauty of God’s fallen light. 
The light now becomes quite explicitly God’s light—it is a sacrament, a 
hint of a power that, together with his wife’s beauty, enables him to 
fight his fear. And the singer, who knows that he has two faces, will 
not give up his woman. He defies the evil man he would not be. He will 
not deprive the singer of his love. Let him go ahead and try!<br>
<br>
Why such confidence? The most "liturgical" of all the songs in Tunnel of
 Love invokes a saint in the song "Valentine’s Day"-the Catholic feast 
(abandoned by our own prudish liturgical purists) of the renewal of 
romantic love.<br>
<br>
The singer is driving home, pondering the truth that in independence 
there is freedom and reveling in the excitement of the road. Yet he has 
just spoken to a friend who has become a father. The friend’s voice 
sounds like the light of the skies and the rivers and the timberwolf in 
the pines. Maybe, the singer admits, he travels fastest who travels 
alone; but tonight, as his big car rushes down the highway, he misses 
his girl and he misses his home. Now that might not be quite your man 
Seamus Heaney, but it’s not bad poetry either. And it also has light and
 flowing waters.<br>
<br>
In the final verses of the song—and of the album—Springsteen closes the 
circle of sacramentality: Light (God’s light again) and the river and 
the bride and God become one, an irresistible symbol and story of the 
rebirth and renewal of life and love. He wakes up from a nightmare and 
finds "God’s light came shinin’ on through." He is scared and terrified 
and also born anew. The water rushing over him is not the cold river 
bottom, the wind rushing through his arms is not the bitterness of a 
dream that did not come true. No, the wind and the water and the light 
is his wife. So he quietly asks her to be his Valentine.<br>
<br>
If that’s despair, I’m the Dalai Lama. Rather, it is Catholicism, pure and simple.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
Rock critic Steve Perry notes that throughout his career Springsteen has
 been obsessed with the themes of community (which is what one would 
expect from a person steeped in the Catholic imagination). On the one 
hand, he laments the death of his communities of origin; and on the 
other, he strains for the freedom of the river and the road. The 
advantage of such a position is that one can combine nostalgia with 
freedom from intimacy. Now in marriage he finds that he has created a 
new community of his own with its demands, frustrations and 
disappointments. He can still escape from it to the road. He can still 
flee from complexity and intimacy and human frailty to the power of the 
high-speed car.<br>
<br>
Only mostly he does not want to, not for long, because it is at home 
with the beloved that one finds healing water and God’s holy light. And 
the Valentine.<br>
<br>
The cover of Tunnel portrays the singer leaning, rather ruefully, 
against the Big White Car. It is not as much fun as it used to be. A car
 is an easier and a less demanding joy than a woman. But not nearly so 
rewarding.<br>
<br>
The piety of these songs—and I challenge you to find a better word—is 
sentient without being sentimental, an Italian-American male piety not 
unlike that found in some of the films of Martin Scorcese (especially 
"Mean Streets"). It is, perhaps, not Sunday Mass piety, but it is, if 
anything, much richer and deeper and more powerful. It is the piety of 
symbol rather than doctrine. (Most of the rock critics, by the way, 
agree that in terms of lyrics, music and singing technique, Tunnel is 
the most important artistic stride in Springsteen’s life.)<br>
<br>
I have no desire to claim Springsteen as Catholic in the way we used to 
claim movie actors and sports heroes. I merely observe that this is (not
 utterly unique) Catholic imagery on the lips of a troubadour whose 
origins and present identification are Catholic. I also observe that the
 Catholic origin of the imagery serves to explain them. I finally 
observe that the critics seem to pay no attention to the images, perhaps
 because without a Catholic perspective one has a hard time 
understanding where they come from and what they mean.<br>
<br>
So if the troubadour’s symbols are only implicitly Catholic (and perhaps
 not altogether consciously so) and if many folks will not understand 
them or perceive their origins, what good are they to the Catholic 
Church? Surely they will not increase Sunday collections or win converts
 or improve the church’s public image. Or win consent to the pastoral 
letter on economics.<br>
<br>
But those are only issues if you assume that people exist to serve the 
church. If, on the other hand, you assume that the church exists to 
serve people by bringing a message of hope and renewal, of light and 
water and rebirth, to a world steeped in tragedy and sin, you rejoice 
that such a troubadour sings stories that maybe even he does not know 
are Catholic.<br>

The singer, the sinner's prayer, and my spiritual journey.<br>
Andy Whitman <br>
<br>
My Christian conversion roughly coincided with my discovery of Bruce 
Springsteen. My sinner's prayer ran something along the lines of "If you
 can do anything with this mess, Lord, go for it." A few days later I 
found myself in a packed auditorium, dazzled for the first but far from 
the last time by a rocker who played for three and a half hours without a
 break, basking in the glory of the songs from Born to Run a few months 
before the album was released. And I've been along for the ride ever 
since, a Christian who is convinced that Bruce Springsteen has more to 
say to me than any other songwriter.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen<br>
This is curious because, as far as I know, Springsteen does not claim to
 be a Christian. He grew up in the Catholic Church, left it in his 
teens, and never looked back. But Springsteen understands mess; the kind
 of mess that I was in, the relational conundrums that can trace their 
roots to unresolved dreams, the power of choices that set us off down a 
path from which it is often difficult to retreat, the gap between the 
people we would like to be and the people we often are. In spite of 
this, his songs offer an unbroken testimony to those who face adversity 
and strive to overcome it. And, increasingly, his work is characterized 
by a buoyant hope that can only be seen as rooted in the person of Jesus
 Christ. If you doubt that claim, you need to listen to his latest album
 Wrecking Ball, an album in which Jesus and his teachings inform 
virtually every song.<br>
It needs to be reiterated that Springsteen, the multimillionaire rock 
star, writes character studies, and that the world his characters 
inhabit is one where the American Dream has been transformed into the 
American Nightmare. In this vision of the new America, the country is 
peopled with a few rich bankers and a lot of unemployed or underemployed
 individuals who struggle merely to survive. It is a world of shuttered 
factories, of jobs gone forever, and of hometowns turned to ghost towns.
 Assuming that you are not a multimillionaire rock star, it probably 
looks something like your world or mine. The conventional wisdom holds 
that these are songs of the common man, but the conventional wisdom is 
wrong. These people are anything but common. They have names like Joe 
and Mary, Miguel and Rosalita, and their stories are as unique and 
extraordinary as any and every human life.<br>
This is Springsteen's extravagant gift; finding the spark of uniqueness 
and worth in particular human lives and holding those lives up as a 
mirror for us to see the reflection of ourselves, of the time and place 
in which we live. He does it on Wrecking Ball time and time again. He 
finds the spark in the nameless narrator of "Shackled and Drawn" who 
longs to feel the sun on his face and the sweat of honest labor on his 
shirt, but who cannot find work; in the defiant, angry Jersey swamp rat 
of the title track who is willing to take on the fat cat bankers singly 
or in bunches; in the desperate handyman of "Jack of All Trades," 
willing to do anything, even the most menial of tasks, to put food on 
the table. The handyman holds out for a wistful dream:<br>
The hurricane blows, bring the hard rain<br>
When the blue sky breaks<br>
It feels like the world's gonna change<br>
And we'll start caring for each other<br>
Like Jesus said we might<br>
I'm a Jack of all trades, we'll be all right<br>
The vision finds its fulfillment in "Land of Hope and Dreams," the kind 
of arena-rattling anthem that Springsteen hasn't written in a while. 
This is an old song, one that he has been performing for well over a 
decade in his concerts, but it is fitting that it appears at the end of 
Wrecking Ball, the eventual victor in the usual Springsteen tug-of-war 
between despair and transcendent hope.<br>
In Flannery O'Connor's great short story "Revelation," Mrs. Turpin, the 
self-righteous and judgmental protagonist, sees a vision in which white 
trash, freaks, lunatics, and "black niggers in white robes" lead the 
heavenly procession, while the pious churchgoers bring up the rear. 
Springsteen, in his most blatant gospel song, offers a similar vision of
 the train of glory, rumbling heavenward to where faith will be 
rewarded. It is a train that carries "saints and sinners, losers and 
winners, whores and gamblers, lost souls, fools and kings," and one in 
which "dreams will not be thwarted" and "faith will be rewarded." It's a
 glorious song, a perfect encapsulation of the greatness of its 
songwriter and singer. It's also the gospel; good news—the best news, in
 fact—for those who are weary and heavy-laden, uncommon men and women 
sorely in need of grace.<br>

9/11 and Springsteen<br>
by Craig Werner<br>
<br>
<br>
The transformation of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, into a
 seemingly foreordained historical narrative began almost as soon as the
 first plane hit the north tower of the World Trade Center. I was 
teaching an 8 a.m. class at the University of Wisconsin-Madison that 
morning, so the first I heard of what had happened came from a colleague
 who greeted me at the door of the lecture hall with the simple words, 
“We’re at war.” Like hundreds of millions of others in the United States
 and around the world, I spent the rest of the day glued to a television
 screen, internalizing the images that have come to define that key 
moment in American history: the flames billowing from the side of the 
north tower, the appearance of the second plane, the Pentagon 
smoldering, the collapse of the towers, dense smoke filling the streets,
 the first images of the nightmare ruins, and the slow tolling of the 
dead.<br>
<br>
My colleague, of course, was right. Looking back, it’s difficult to see 
the events of what would soon be shorthanded as 9/11 as anything other 
than the prelude to war. It’s not hard to fill in the rest of the story 
as it’s likely to be told in the history books of the mid-twenty-first 
century: the identification of the hijackers with al Qaeda; Osama bin 
Laden claiming responsibility for the attacks; the initial defeat of the
 Taliban; the Bush Doctrine, broadening the set of circumstances in 
which the United States could take military action overseas; the shift 
of focus to Weapons of Mass Destruction; the bombing of Baghdad and 
troops making their way through the burning desert; President Bush’s 
premature celebration of the “mission accomplished”; and the agonizing 
years that followed.<br>
<br>
At least initially, however, there was another aspect to the story, one 
that focused on the depth of the human loss. The speech President Bush 
delivered the following week was recognized, even by his political 
opponents, as one of his finest moments, one that sought to connect a 
grieving nation without regard to party or ideology. The “America: A 
Tribute to Heroes” telethon broadcast on September 21 brought together a
 broad range of popular musicians to provide a focal point for the 
nation’s mourning and grief. The most memorable moments included Stevie 
Wonder’s “Love’s in Need of Love Today,” hip-hop artist Wycliffe Jean’s 
take on Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song,” Paul Simon’s “Bridge over 
Troubled Water,” and, most of all, Bruce Springsteen’s performance of 
“My City of Ruins.” Eventually, Springsteen would release the song as 
the closing cut of The Rising, an album-length meditation on loss and 
recovery that remains the most stirring artistic response to 9/11.<br>
<br>
“My City of Ruins” sounds as if it was written in direct response to the
 tragedy. Beginning with images of “a blood red circle on the cold dark 
ground” and a ghostly organ emanating from an empty church, Springsteen 
evokes the sense of desolation and absence that were pervasive in the 
days following the attack. The question “how can I begin again?” leads 
to a pledge, a prayer, and a call to “rise up.” Emotionally, the song’s 
connection with the tragedy seemed obvious.<br>
<br>
In fact, Springsteen had written “My City of Ruins” to address the 
economic and social devastation of Asbury Park, New Jersey, whose 
seaside clubs had catapulted him to success in the early 1970s. Daniel 
Wolff’s brilliant history, 4th of July, Asbury Park, traces the 
historical forces that led to the blasted streets and broken lives 
Springsteen invoked when he heard the “sweet bells of mercy” sounding 
above the boarded-up windows and “young men on the corner like scattered
 leaves.”<br>
<br>
“My City of Ruins” was the culmination of Springsteen’s ruminations on a
 set of issues brought into sharp relief by 9/11. In fact, the power of 
The Rising stems precisely from its ability to draw connections between 
seemingly disparate elements of early twenty-first-century American 
history. Intensely and personally aware of the human reality of the 
tragedy—around 150 residents of Monmouth County, where Springsteen 
lives, died when the towers collapsed—Springsteen nevertheless refused 
to join in the cries for vengeance. In “Lonesome Day,” for example, he 
follows the persona’s desire for revenge with the cautionary lines: 
“Better ask questions before you shoot / Deceit and betrayal’s a bitter 
fruit.”[1] In part because it is a consummate musical statement that 
taps deeply into the wellsprings of American music—the blues and gospel 
as well as rock and soul—The Rising served as a much-needed, if 
ultimately unheeded reminder of the human—and at least potentially the 
healing—stories that risk being lost in the political and military 
narratives.<br>
<br>
As a teaching tool, Springsteen’s musical response to 9/11 (not only The
 Rising, but also Devils and Dust and Magic) offers a present-tense 
sense of what it felt like to be there—which will become increasingly 
important as questions like “where were you when it happened?” and “how 
did your family react?” lose their pedagogical usefulness. In addition, 
it provides a window on the political and cultural logics that led from 
the attack to the wars, which in turn encourages reflection on the use 
and misuse of analogies in policy-making.<br>
<br>
Although the most visible part of Springsteen’s involvement with 9/11 
was the telethon, its most important dimension centered on his immediate
 community. Aware that he’d be criticized for capitalizing on the 
tragedy, he decided it was more important to respond to his neighbors’ 
pain than to worry about his image. Springsteen traced that decision to a
 driver who, seeing him pulling out of a parking lot at the beach near 
his home, rolled down his window and shouted, “We need you—now!” In the 
days and weeks that followed, Springsteen reached out to families who 
had lost fathers, mothers, or children in the attacks. One woman he 
spoke to told Time magazine, “After I got off the phone with him, the 
world just felt a little smaller. I got through Joe’s memorial and a 
good month and a half on that phone call.”[2]<br>
<br>
Summing up the immediate impact of 9/11 on the communities surrounding 
New York City, Springsteen said: “In the following weeks if you were 
driving towards the beach or something, if you drove by the Catholic 
church, there was a funeral every day. Then people got together and 
there were some shows done and benefits and candlelight vigils and a 
wide variety of ways that people were trying to sort through what 
happened. I don’t know what it was like in the middle of the country or 
on the West Coast, but here it was very real.”[3]<br>
<br>
The Rising elicited a particularly powerful response from those who 
shared Springsteen’s immediate experience. The measure of its artistic 
impact, however, rested on its ability to touch listeners who lived 
outside the Washington and New York metropolitan areas. That wasn’t an 
accident. From the time he began assembling material for the album, 
Springsteen was seeking, as he told an interviewer, to avoid treating 
the events of 9/11 in a “linear” or “literal” manner. The first song on 
the album, “Lonesome Day,” opens with a verse that has no direct 
connection with the attacks. “If you look at the first verse,” he said. 
“it feels like it’s a guy talking to his girl. So I switched right out 
of this personal thing to this sort of overall emotional mood and the 
feelings that were in the air. . . . All experience is personal so you 
have to start there, and then if you can connect in what’s happening 
with everyone, the universality of an experience, then you’re creating 
that alchemy where your audience is listening to it, they’re hearing 
what they’re feeling inside and they’re also feeling ‘I’m not 
alone.’”[4]<br>

The second verse of “Lonesome Day” reframes the persona’s loss in 
relation to larger, darker, and, in context, political forces: “Hell’s 
brewin’,” a dark sun’s rising, houses are burning, vipers slither 
through the grass. The line that follows offers a momentary resolution: 
“a little revenge, and this too shall pass.” Both the desire for 
vengeance and Biblically inflected reassurance resonate throughout The 
Rising. The emotional constellation recurs in “Empty Sky,” when 
Springsteen sings “I want a kiss from your lips, I want an eye for an 
eye. I woke up this morning to an empty sky.”[5] The title image can be 
understood in multiple ways: as a reference to the empty space where the
 Twin Towers once stood; to the grounding of air traffic in the days 
following 9/11; or as a symbol of metaphysical despair, the collapse of 
the protagonist’s religious faith. The crux of the song, however, lies 
in his desire for the harsh justice of the eye for an eye. It’s possible
 to hear the line as a call to war, an endorsement of the political 
response firmly in place by the time The Rising was released in July 
2002. That’s not what Springsteen meant. Stressing the importance of 
distinguishing between artist and persona, Springsteen spoke directly to
 the political point: “I wrote that phrase as an expression of the 
character’s anger and confusion and grief. It was never written to be a 
call for blind revenge or bloodlust.”[6]<br>
<br>
The emotional center of gravity of The Rising lies much closer to the 
bluesy resignation of “Waitin’ on a Sunny Day” or “Countin’ on a 
Miracle,” both of which emphasize the personal dimension of the 
recovery; and the hard-earned celebration of “Meet Me at Mary’s Place.” 
The religious undertones of those songs reflect Springsteen’s reliance 
on the African American gospel and the blues traditions grounded in the 
necessity of coming to terms with suffering without resorting to 
violence. “They’re all fundamentally gospel-rooted or blues-and-gospel 
rooted,” Springsteen said, referring to his pre-9/11 compositions “Land 
of Hope and Dreams” and “The Promised Land” as well as “Meet Me at 
Mary’s Place” and “My City of Ruins.” “[They ask] for help in discerning
 meaning from chaotic or cataclysmic events. I think people are asking 
themselves, ‘Where do I fit into this? What happened? Where did my 
husband go? Where did my wife go? What’s that about? What can I do about
 it? What do I do now? Where are they?’ I think all those questions, if 
you go through any sort of real shattering loss, become a constant part 
of your life.”[7]<br>
<br>
It only takes a few seconds of “Worlds Apart” to establish Springsteen’s
 understanding that loss was a constant reality not just for Americans, 
but for the Afghans and Iraqis—few of whom had anything to do with the 
attacks—swept up in the post-9/11 wars. Inspired by the widely 
circulated photographs of women in Afghanistan with the veils off their 
faces in the aftermath of the initial defeat of the Taliban—“their faces
 were so beautiful”—Springsteen contacted Pakistani musician Asif Ali 
Khan, who agreed to record an unmistakably Middle Eastern introduction 
to the song. Anything but a justification for the 9/11 hijackers or 
suicide bombers, “Worlds Apart” does insist that there’s more than one 
side to the story. Observing that the sound is as important as the 
lyrics to apprehending the album’s meaning, Springsteen biographer Dave 
Marsh wrote that “the graceful and eloquent ‘Paradise’ . . . attacks 
vengeful and suicidal beliefs, secular and religious, as being opposed 
to real spirituality.” In Marsh’s words, “Worlds Apart” issues a 
“warning against the madness of jihadist bombers and the insanity of 
American imperialism. It did its best not to side with evil, to endorse 
no nation or religion, and to seek justice, not an eye for an eye or a 
tooth for a tooth.”[8]<br>
<br>
Although Springsteen had kept his distance from electoral politics, even
 when Ronald Reagan misread “Born in the U.S.A.” as a jingoistic anthem,
 the rush to war following 9/11 convinced him to take a stand. Aligning 
himself with the nascent anti-war movement and providing active support 
to John Kerry’s campaign for the presidency, he introduced “Land of 
Hopes and Dreams” as a “prayer for our troops in Iraq and the peace of 
the Iraqi people.” In interviews, he emphasized that the stakes weren’t 
purely partisan. “I think the question of whether we were misled into a 
war in Iraq isn’t a liberal or a conservative question but it is an 
American one,” he said, “and protecting our democracy that we ask our 
sons and daughters to die for is our sacred trust as citizens.” In an 
op-ed essay published in the New York Times, Springsteen elaborated on 
his political evolution in the wake of 9/11: “Like many others, in the 
aftermath of 9/11, I felt the country’s unity. I don’t remember anything
 quite like it. I supported the decision to enter Afghanistan and I 
hoped that the seriousness of the times would bring forth strength, 
humility and wisdom in our leaders. Instead, we dived headlong into an 
unnecessary war in Iraq, offering up the lives of our young men and 
women under circumstances that are now discredited. We ran record 
deficits, while simultaneously cutting and squeezing services like 
afterschool programs. We granted tax cuts to the richest 1 percent 
(corporate bigwigs, well-to-do guitar players), increasing the division 
of wealth that threatens to destroy our social contract with one another
 and render mute the promise of ‘one nation indivisible.’”[9]<br>
<br>
Kerry’s defeat challenged Springsteen’s already shaky faith not only in 
the country’s political leaders, but also in the electorate that had 
returned them to office. At first, he looked inward. The title song of 
Devils and Dust, released in April 2005, offers a dark meditation on the
 state of the country’s soul. Singing from the perspective of a soldier 
“a long, long way from home,” Springsteen presents the persona’s dilemma
 as he fights for survival as an analog for the nation’s willingness to 
sacrifice civil liberties as a result of the “War on Terror”: “What if 
what you do to survive kills the things you love?” Acknowledging the 
power of fear to turn the best hearts black, he concludes mournfully, 
“It’ll take your God-filled soul, turn it to devils and dust.”<br>
<br>
By the time he released Magic in the fall of 2007, Springsteen’s sadness
 had resolved into anger. “Your Own Worst Enemy” picks up where “Devils 
and Dust” left off, holding up the mirror to politicians and polity that
 seemed incapable of acknowledging its own responsibility for the morass
 in the Middle East. The album’s title cut urges his listeners to 
protect themselves against the politicians and pundits: “Trust none of 
what you hear, and less of what you see.” Most telling, however, is the 
direct question raised in “Last to Die,” a phrase he adapted from John 
Kerry’s testimony at the Winter Soldier hearings publicizing war crimes 
and atrocities during the Vietnam War: “Whose blood will spill, whose 
heart will break? Who’ll be the last to die for a mistake?”<br>
<br>
As of the summer of 2012, no answer has been forthcoming.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s music quietly argues that, like Vietnam, the wars in 
Afghanistan and Iraq are primarily stories of unnecessary and 
ill-conceived suffering and loss. Springsteen most certainly wants us to
 remember the 2,752 who died when the towers collapsed and the families 
they left behind. But, as someone with a broad awareness of the legacy 
of Vietnam, he wants his listeners to think with equal seriousness about
 the 5,000-plus American men and women killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, 
as well as their families and the veterans struggling, not always 
successfully, to make it home. The most harrowing aspect of “Long Walk 
Home,” in some ways the most powerful song on the Magic album is that it
 resonates equally powerfully with Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan and 
the country’s struggle to regain its existential bearings. But he knows 
that full cost of the war includes the uncounted casualties among the 
Afghan and Iraqi people; estimates as of June 2012 range from a low of 
132,000 civilian deaths to a high of more than a million in Iraq alone. 
As Springsteen insisted in The Rising, the people of Iraq and 
Afghanistan, like the young men on the corners of Asbury Park, are in no
 meaningful sense living in worlds apart.<br>

<br>
By Joe Blog<br>
<br>
Johnny works in a factory. Billy works downtown.<br>
Terry works in a rock and roll band looking for that million dollar sound.<br>
Got a job down in Darlington. Some nights I don't go.<br>
Some nights I go to the drive in. Some night I stay home.<br>
-- Bruce Springsteen. The Promise.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
I remember the first time I heard The Promise. It was about a decade 
ago. The song had been around for a long time before I first heard it --
 Bruce Springsteen would say it was the first song he wrote after Born 
To Run made him a rock and roll star in 1975. It figures that this was 
the first song. Born to Run, the whole album, was about longing, open 
highway, the amusement park rising bold and stark, the poets who write 
nothing at all, the ghosts in the eyes of all the boys Mary sent away. 
Born to Run is about that brilliant age when you know dreams don't come 
true, but you still believe they might come true FOR YOU. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And The Promise is about the every day numbing of those dreams. It is a 
follow-up to Thunder Road, that song about the guy who learned how to 
make his guitar talk, and the girl who ain't a beauty (but hey, she's 
all right), both of them, pulling out of that town full of losers, 
pulling out of there to win. Now, that guy's got a job. It's a night 
job. Some nights he don't go. A friend told me, "You have to listen to 
this song. I can't believe you haven't heard this song."<br>
<br>
I listened to the version of The Promise on 18 Tracks. It's not the 
version Springsteen recorded more than 30 years ago. This version is 
stripped down to almost nothing, just Springsteen and a piano.<br>
<br>
And the weirdest thing happened, something I can never remember 
happening before or since when I listened to a song. I felt myself 
crying.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
I followed that dream just like those guys do way up on the screen.<br>
Drove my Challenger down Route 9 through the dead ends and all the bad scenes.<br>
When the promise was broken, I cashed in a few of my own dreams<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
If I had to pick a single memory, the memory that best summarizes my 
teenage years, the memory that best expresses the kind of man I hoped to
 become ... well, it is 6 a.m., and my bed shakes. That's how my father 
wakes me up. He mildly bumps the bed with his knee. It is summertime, 
but rain pours, so it is still dark, a harsh gray. My father walks out 
of the room without saying a word. There is nothing to say. It is time 
to get up.<br>
<br>
I dress quickly. There are no morning showers. We have timed our morning
 to the minute so that we can get as much sleep as possible ... or, more
 to the point, so I can get as much sleep as possible. Dad doesn't sleep
 much except for the naps he gets in front of the television. I meet my 
father downstairs. He is already there -- he is always there first, 
dressed, ready to go. He is always waiting on me. He wakes up long 
before 6 a.m. on his own. His lunch is packed in a brown paper sack. It 
is probably a salami sandwich. It is usually a salami sandwich.<br>
<br>
We trudge out to the car, a declining Pontiac T-1000 that I hope to buy 
at the end of the summer. The rain hits our necks, but there's no 
running. We ride in silence for a few minutes. Then, we start to talk 
about small things. We stop at Popeyes for a breakfast biscuit. The 
morning gains light slowly, like an old television picture tube coming 
to life. The ride is 30 minutes or so. There is little traffic this 
early in the morning.<br>
<br>
And then, we get out ... and go into the factory. Alisa is the name of 
the place. It is a knitting factory. We make sweaters, I guess, though I
 never actually see any sweaters. Everything is yarn. It is hard to 
breathe because of the heat and the humidity and the dust and the 
cardboard boxes, and because the yarn chokes the air. I feel sure that a
 sweater is being knitted in my lungs.<br>
<br>
My father's job is to make sure the knitting machines run. He unclogs 
jams, quiets the guttural sounds, tightens bolts that break free, 
loosens bolts that choke the machine. His hands are unnaturally strong; I
 have known this since I was a boy. Now I see that he uses his fingers 
to loosen bolts that are wedged tight. There is no time to find a 
wrench. Sometimes, when the machines run smoothly, I see him drawing Xs 
on graph paper as he works out a sweater color design. When kids in 
school used to ask me what my father did for a living, I would tell them
 he designs sweaters. It wasn't because I was ashamed of what he did; 
quite the opposite. That was how I saw him.<br>
<br>
My job is to stay in the warehouse, move boxes of yarn in and out, and, 
one day a week, Thursday, unloaded barrels of dye from a truck. I am 
doing this to raise enough money buy that old car, that Pontiac. I'm 18 
years old and thoroughly without purpose, except for that, I desperately
 want my own car. I am an accounting major at college though even the 
most basic accounting concepts baffle me. I can't help but think of 
debits as good and credits as bad. The professors keep telling me that 
they are not good or bad, but I don't believe them. I already know I 
won't be an accountant, but have not admitted it to myself yet. I don't 
have any idea what I will do -- or what I can do. Everything feels out 
of reach. <br>
<br>
I work six days a week at Alisa, and the pay, if I remember correctly, 
is $4 an hour. The minimum wage at the time is $3.35 an hour, so this is
 the second-highest paying job of my young life. The highest paying job,
 at $4.50 an hour, involved calling people who were past due on their 
mortgage. My job there was to set up a payment schedule with those 
people. I wasn't good at this; I didn't understand the fury and 
desperation of the voices on the end of dial tones. I got threatened a 
lot. I don't get threatened at the factory. Yelled at, yes. Threatened, 
no. There's no point in threats, not here. It's understood by everyone 
how easy I am to replace. I'm scrawny and weak and viewed as a 
non-prospect. I'm only here as a favor to my father, the only guy who 
knows how to fix the machines if they break down.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
Well now I built that challenger by myself.<br>
But I needed money and so I sold it.<br>
Lived a secret I should'a kept to myself.<br>
But I got drunk one night and I told it.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
Springsteen wrote The Promise for the "Darkness on the Edge of Town" 
album. People who follow the Springsteen story know that the time when 
he wrote The Promise, that time after Born To Run made him a star and 
before Darkness made him an adult, that was a strange time for him. He 
was locked in a searing legal battle with his manager Mike Appel over 
creative freedom -- the thing Springsteen called his musical soul -- and
 he was also struggling with what it meant to be a huge success for the 
first time in his life. He hated success and loved it, and hated himself
 for loving it.<br>
<br>
And the music poured out of him like sweat. He was 27 and hungry, still 
hungry, but he was not entirely sure for what. He was listening to punk 
music. He was listening to Hank Williams. The Born to Run sessions were 
legendary for Springsteen's refusal to compromise, his 14-month 
insistence on making every single song sound exactly like what he was 
hearing in his head no matter how many different ways he had to stretch 
the songs. But at least with Born To Run, there was a clear vision 
everyone could understand. Springsteen simply wanted to make the 
greatest rock and roll album that had ever been made. That's was 25 year
 old musicians did. The kid had ambition.<br>
<br>
But nobody quite knew what Springsteen was trying to do with Darkness, 
maybe not even Springsteen himself. The band learned song after song 
after song. Some of the songs sounded like hits, but Springsteen seemed 
uninterested in those. This was the time when he would give "Because The
 Night" to the punk star Patti Smith -- her biggest hit. This was the 
time when he gave "Fire" to The Pointer Sisters -- their biggest hit. He
 gave "This Little Girl" to Gary U.S. Bonds ... and it would become 
Bonds' first hit in almost 20 years. He gave an older song, "The Fever,"
 and "Talk to Me" to Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes. He gave 
"Rendezvous" to Greg Kihn. In the documentary about Darkness, 
Springsteen's guitarist and foil and alter-ego Stevie Van Zandt would 
say, seemingly without irony, "It's a bit tragic in a way. Because he 
would have been one of the great pop songwriters of all time."<br>
<br>
The one thing Springsteen knew for sure is that he didn't want to be a 
great pop songwriter. He did not want hits, not then. He did not want to
 repeat Born To Run. He wanted to say something, and he wanted to "leave
 no room to be misunderstood." He didn't want to try to make the 
greatest rock and roll album of all time, not this time. He wanted 
something else, something harder to describe. "I wanted to make an 
honest album," he would say. The band rehearsed and recorded "The 
Promise" for three months, trying to get it just right.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
All my life I fought that fight<br>
The fight that you can't win.<br>
Every day it gets harder to live<br>
the dream you're believin' in.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
My job at Alisa is monotonous and soul draining. Oh, it has sitcom 
elements -- I am still young enough and detached enough to see that. 
There is the vicious boss who loves to yell at me for no apparent reason
 except that I'm not good at moving boxes and he hates his life. Once he
 takes me and a couple of warehouse guys, puts us in a truck, drives us 
off somewhere without explaining where or why. We end up in a ritzy 
neighborhood. Turns out the owner of the factory needs his couch moved. 
And so we move his couch. <br>
<br>
There is a humorless old man who works with us in the warehouse who 
constantly tells us that he has seen kids come and go but that he has 
survived for all these years (we sometimes attempt to guess what he's 
making after all these years; we think $5 an hour). There is the 
preposterous nature of the actual work -- my job is to move boxes of 
yarn here, no, over there, no, back here, no, leave it there until 
later. There are even young non-beauties-but-hey-they're-all-right 
identical twins who look better and better the longer I work here (it is
 fitting, I suppose, that in time I come to like one of them, the 
prettier identical twin if that makes any sense, but it's the other one 
who seems to like me).<br>
<br>
But elements of comedy or not, there is little funny about the place or 
the job. Alisa is day after day after day after day after day of endless
 work that never gets completed. There is always another truck to 
unload, another tour of the floor ("Box 'em up!" the boss used to yell),
 another run to the dye part of the factory, which is poisonous and 
bleak and dangerous, like something out of a Dickens' novel or the 
Batman movies. All the while, the machines whir and shriek and clank and
 buzz -- the noise so overpowers everything it makes the boxes shake, 
but after a while I stop hearing the noise, at least while I'm in the 
factory. My ears ring for hours afterward, and sometimes I wake up in 
the middle of the night, and I still hear those machines.<br>
<br>
I make it through the first couple of weeks on adrenaline and 
exuberance, and make it through the next two on the promise of owning my
 very first car. But at that point, one month in, I lose all 
inspiration. I go to work simply because my father kicks the bed every 
morning, and I know he's waiting downstairs, and I do not know exactly 
how to quit. I work all day on automatic pilot -- I become proficient 
with hand trucks, I surprise myself with how much strength I build up, I
 try to hide in the gaps between the boxes every now and again, I sweat 
off 20 pounds that, at the time, I did not have to lose. I go home 
exhausted and desperate for something ... something hard to explain. And
 the next morning I wake up at the kick of the bed, and the blurry 
picture of my father dressed and ready, and stumble into my jeans and 
into the Pontiac and go through it all again. <br>
<br>
I believe that this will not be my life. I suppose this is what keeps me
 sane. This is not my life. This is only temporary. I do not know what I
 can do. I have a hard time looking at my life realistically. I'm 18 
years old, living in my parents apartment, failing accounting at a city 
college, and drifting through life without any marketable skills I know 
about. All I have is youth, and youth tells me that this will not be my 
life, cannot be my life, that this is a summer job so I can buy my Dad's
 car and drive off and that I really will do something bigger ... all I 
have is youth telling me that someday summer will end.<br>
<br>

<br>
When the promise is broken, you go on living<br>
But it steals something from down in your soul<br>
Like when the truth is spoken, and it don't make no difference<br>
Something in your heart runs cold<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
In the end, Bruce Springsteen stripped everything out of "Darkness on the Edge of Town" except for the hardest songs. <br>
<br>
Badlands, I think, might be the quintessential Bruce Springsteen song, 
about defiance in the face of the bitter winds of daily life.<br>
<br>
Adam Raised A Cain is is about a son clashing against a father who "worked his whole life for nothing but the pain." <br>
<br>
Something In The Night is about two people trying to find escape in the night but getting caught at the state line.<br>
<br>
Candy's Room is a hard-bitten love story about a boy who loves a beautiful prostitute who cannot be shielded from her sadness.<br>
<br>
Racing In The Street -- probably my favorite song on the album -- is 
about a man who has lost his dream (haven't they all lost their dreams) 
and finds his last bit of wildness and hope racing his '69 Chevy 
Chevelle with a 396 turbojet engine at night. There's a love story in 
here to, a love story with a woman he won in a race against a Camaro and
 who now "stares off along into the night/with the eyes of one who hates
 for just being born."<br>
<br>
The Promised Land is another anthem, the flip side of Badlands -- "I get
 up every morning and go to work each day/But your eyes go blind and 
your blood runs cold/Sometimes I feel so weak I just want to explode."<br>
<br>
Factory is ... about Bruce Springsteen's father going to work at the factory in the rain.<br>
<br>
Streets of Fire is more about those lost nights -- "I walk with Angels that have no place."<br>
<br>
Prove It All Night -- this was an album about endless nights leading 
into unchanging days, the same endless nights that inspired a million 
country songs, a million short stories, a million brilliant paintings 
and almost every sad thing Frank Sinatra ever sang.<br>
<br>
Darkness on the Edge of Town, I think, is about the same guy from Racing
 In The Street, only now his woman has left him, and he tries to keep 
his secrets, and all he has are "things that can only be found/in the 
darkness on the edge of town."<br>
<br>
Anyway, this is what I hear when I listen to the songs. The album is dim
 and black and unrelenting, there is no escape. There is not one bar 
song on the album, not one beach song on the album, not one happy song 
on the album (even though Springsteen and Stevie Van Zandt messed around
 one day and wrote one of their happiest songs, Sherry Darling). There 
is not even one hopeful song on the album. And yet, the album is not 
without hope. The music is the hope. The music soars and it swoops down,
 and it grinds, and it quiets to near silence. It is the music that 
insists on that notion, that notion deep inside, that it ain't no sin to
 be glad your alive, the seminal lyrics from the album, I think, the 
thing that it's all about in the end.<br>
<br>
And, as you know, as you can see, the song "The Promise" is not on 
Darkness. The band played it, and they knew it was great, knew that it 
might be the best song that Bruce Springsteen ever wrote. And it fit on 
the album, it was in many ways everything that Springsteen was trying to
 say. Only Springsteen could not let go of it. The song was too close to
 him. He has never been able to explain it any better than that. Some 
think The Promise is really about his fight with Appel for control of 
his own music. Some think it is about his fear of losing himself in 
success, his fear of losing what he thought was the best part of 
himself. Some think it is about his friends who got left behind.<br>
<br>
In the end, of course, it doesn't matter what The Promise means to Bruce
 Springsteen -- doesn't matter beyond trivia. Like all great songs, all 
great art, it only matters what it means to the person who accepts it. 
Springsteen did not put The Promise on Darkness, though for a while he 
played it at clubs. Then he stopped doing that too. By the time he 
released it in 1999 on 18 Tracks -- the first version I first heard -- 
it was a different song, more wistful, less bitter, more sad, less 
rebellious, all piano. And now, more than 30 years later, Bruce 
Springsteen releases an album of those songs that he recorded and left 
by the side of the road while making Darkness. There is the bar song 
"Rendezvous" and his raw version of "Because The Night" and the upbeat 
(if disturbing) "Fire" and a remarkable rock version of "Racing In The 
Streets" that sounds like it belongs on Born To Run (In this version, 
the car is a Ford, with a 383 -- probably a Mercury Marauder Engine from
 the late 1950s). Springsteen is 61 now and he writes now that these 
songs are like old friends.<br>
<br>
And, of course, The Promise is on there -- the album, in fact, is called
 The Promise. On this version, the song does seem to be more personal, 
less universal, more about what Bruce Springsteen was going through at 
the time -- the Challenger is almost certainly Bruce's music, the secret
 is almost certainly the depth of feeling he had for his music, and he 
sold it, he told it, and this has brought him to doom. It's a beautiful 
version of the song, but I'm glad it's not the first version I heard. 
Because the version I heard isn't about Bruce Springsteen and Mike Appel
 and a fight for art. The version I heard is about a car ride to the 
factory ...<br>
<br>

<br>
Thunder Road<br>
For the lost lovers and all the fixed games<br>
Thunder Road<br>
For the tires rushing by in the rain.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
My memory, the one that echoes in my mind, is not of my time in the 
factory, or the work, or the people (I cannot remember their names) or 
the death I'd feel at the end of the day, or even the fear I had that 
this is all I would become. No, the memory is of that rainy day in North
 Carolina, my father driving, me staring out the window, both of us 
sitting in what would become my first car. That Pontiac did not have a 
396. It struggled to go uphill.<br>
<br>
And I think, for the first time, I understood, really understood, what 
my father did. I knew of other fathers who brought home their 
frustrations, their fears, the discouragement, but I had never really 
understood them. My father did not drink. He did not rage. He did not 
race cars in the street. He smoked two packs of Kents a day, and he 
bowled on Sundays, and he played chess at the club one night a week. He 
coached my Little League team, and he drove all of us around the 
neighborhood so we could see the fireworks on July 4th, and he always 
bought champagne and caviar for New Year's Eve. He came home with oil on
 his pants, and salami on his breath. He fell asleep in front of the 
television.<br>
<br>
I don't remember what we talked about in the car. Sports, maybe. 
Television, maybe. Factory politics, maybe. I only remember the rain -- 
the tires rushing by in the rain -- and the way the wipers squeaked 
against the windshield. I only remember the way the realization hit me 
-- that this was my father's life. I still had years and the promise to 
shield me. In the end, I figured that I was pretty smart, that might get
 me through. Of course, my father was smarter than I was -- still is 
smarter than I am. My father, like all men of his generation (it seemed 
to me), could fix anything, could solve anything, could lift anything. 
My father also could play chess with grandmasters. My father could hit 
any target with a rifle (though he hated guns; he had learned to shoot 
in the Army). My father could dribble a soccer ball forever, it seemed, 
and throw pop-ups high above my imagination, and quote lines word for 
word from any song of the 1950s. And this was his life, this morning 
drive to the factory, every morning, for another sunless day in the howl
 of sweater machines.<br>
<br>
I had this weird experience a couple of weeks ago -- I was on a plane, 
and I was watching the movie Invincible, you know, the one about Vince 
Papale, the Philadelphia bartender who tried out and made the Eagles in 
the 1970s. I had seen it before. I have no idea why the movie was even 
playing -- it's a few years old. But I was watching, and it's 
entertaining enough, and then there was this scene when Vince's father 
was telling him how Steve Van Buren's touchdown, the one that gave the 
Eagles their championship over the Chicago Cardinals in 1948, how that 
touchdown was what kept him going through all the painful days. <br>
<br>
It was just a corny line in a corny movie on a plane heading to the next
 city and the next assignment, and dammit, I felt tears in my eyes. The 
same tears from The Promise. What kept my Dad going? It isn't the sort 
of thing you talk about except in movies and songs. In the car that day,
 I finally figured it out ... finally figured out what kept Dad going 
through all those long, dull, painful, agonizing days at the factory. He
 didn't say it. I didn't say it either. The rain kept showering down, 
but gently, and we stopped for our biscuits, and then we pulled up to 
the factory just as the gray darkness turned to light.</div>

The Boss will take you to the river if you help him get there.<br>
<br>
Killing the Bhudda , 2001<br>
<br>
By Cornel Bonca<br>
<br>
I. "The Ministry of Rock and Roll" <br>
<br>
One night during his 1999-2000 tour with the E Street Band, midway 
through an elongated version of "Light of Day," Bruce Springsteen 
stopped the song in its tracks to make a thunderous speech, in that 
pseudo-evangelist voice his fans know well by now, about 'the power, the
 glory, the ministry of rock 'n' roll!" <br>
<br>
Anthony DeCurtis, reporting on the opening of the tour for Rolling 
Stone, thought it was shtick, and "hilarious" shtick at that. But while 
it was hilarious, it wasn't really shtick. What Springsteen was doing 
was putting on a mask that enabled him to say things he wanted to say --
 things he's been saying, actually, for twenty years in interviews -- 
without coming off as a deluded messianic rock star. <br>
<br>
There's almost nothing worse in pop discourse than reading about Bruce 
Springsteen from a Springsteen fanatic. Critical enthusiasm for 
Springsteen takes decidedly different forms from, say, the critical zeal
 surrounding Madonna, which comes off as either spooky show-biz worship 
or (among highbrows) the sort of semiotic hysterics that gets one named 
to Modern Language Association pop culture panels. It's even different 
from Dylan fanaticism, which tends to fall back on Dylan's own 
remoteness, cool and irony when critical adoration gets too sticky. <br>
<br>
But Springsteen isn't cool and remote, he's sweaty, present, and very 
there. The forms of irony his music takes aren't cute or postmodern, 
which is to say he's not fundamentally evasive, which is to say -- and 
here comes trouble for any critic writing around the millennial hour -- 
he's sincere. Springsteen fanatics don't just love the work or the act. 
While they go through all sorts of verbal contortions to hide it, the 
fact is they deeply admire -- O.K., they love -- the man. <br>
<br>
In a pop landscape that's gone way beyond the music industry's 
traditional cynical button- pushing of audience emotion to the point 
where the audience fervently embraces its own manipulation as pop's 
puerile point (see Britney Spears, the boy bands, Limp Bizkit, etc.), 
Springsteen's genuineness and conviction, not to mention his command, 
embodiment, and extension of rock mythology, feels atavistic. It's also 
disarmingly heroic: the critics in his corner can hardly believe their 
own -- and rock's -- good fortune to still have him around. <br>
<br>
It's a little embarrassing how naked a love we -- I'll drop the evasive 
pronoun act, if you don't mind -- have for him. Here's what Marshall 
Berman, who isn't just a mere rock critic but a major league 
intellectual, once said about this love: <br>
<br>
It is extraordinary how Bruce Springsteen has worked his way into so 
many people's lives. Ask them to think of their peak experiences over 
the past decade: Alongside the intimate private moments with their 
lovers, spouses, and kids, in deepest privacy, they'll remember moments 
in immense public spaces with Bruce and 20,000 others. And the fact that
 the feeling is shared and multiplied -- indeed promoted and 
orchestrated -- doesn't diminish the ecstasy and communion. I remember 
my moment... I had to see the people around me; and see myself, with new
 eyes. I felt at that moment that I would trust this man with my life. <br>
<br>
Now it's easy to spy in this sort of thing a dangerous hero worship that
 flashes images of Nuremberg to the mind -- images that admittedly got 
reinforced during Springsteen's 1984-5 Born in the U.S.A. tour. But I 
don't know any Springsteen lovers who let such cynicism get to them. 
Instead, we merely nod our heads in appreciation at remarks like 
Berman's, as if to say, "Yeah, totally know what he means. I've felt 
that, I remember it, I treasure it." We're not afraid of giving 
ourselves wholeheartedly to a figure who, almost alone in the pop world,
 makes us feel as if we've got one -- i.e. a whole heart.<br>
<br>
That trust that Berman talks about is something I'm sure (I trust) 
Springsteen is eager to displace from his person onto his music, or 
better, to the circle of feeling that gets created and reinforced as 
artist and audience egg each other on in performance or speak to one 
another across his records. It's essentially a covenant that's been 
struck between Springsteen and his audience from way back, echoes of 
which are heard in everything from "Thunder Road," to "The Promised 
Land," and "The Ties That Bind," and gets summed up on an 80s B-side 
called "Be True": "You be true to me, and I'll be true to you." What's 
striking about this covenant, and what distinguishes it from most other 
rock experiences, is how morally complex this simple- sounding promise 
turns out to be. And moral complexity is very hard to talk about in a 
rock context without sounding like a solemn, righteous egghead. <br>
<br>
Yet Springsteen's music is demonstrably moral not because it does 
anything as simplistic as espouse a particular ethic (the idea of him 
pulling a Christian conversion album, like Dylan's Slow Train Coming, is
 unthinkable) but because it creates a form of address (a style of will,
 to borrow an old, usefully eggheady idea from Susan Sontag) whose 
greatest concern and sympathy have to do with consequences: What happens
 when we act out of passion or cowardice, weakness or strength, love or 
hate, the crazed desire for redemption and transcendence? How do we deal
 with guilt? And what happens when all these things flow into one 
another, when they become part of what Springsteen calls (on Lucky Town)
 the Big Muddy? Rock 'n' roll isn't supposed to be about consequences, 
but Springsteen has turned it to moral account in a way which forces its
 Dionysian passion to face the disasters that often follow in its wake. <br>
<br>
Skim the Springsteen catalogue -- from "Incident on 57th St." to "Born 
to Run" and Thunder Road," from "Badlands" to "Adam Raised A Cain" and 
"Darkness on the Edge of Town," from "The River" to "Point Blank" and 
"Stolen Car," then on to "Atlantic City," "State Trooper," "Born in the 
U.S.A." "Seeds," "Tunnel of Love," "Lucky Town," "Living Proof," "Human 
Touch," "With Every Wish," "The Ghost of Tom Joad," "Youngstown," and 
"Land of Hope and Dreams" and "American Skin (41 Shots)" from the 
recently released CD called Live in New York City. What you get over and
 over are dramatic enactments pitting a Dionysian spirit desperate for 
release against an equal and opposite force desperate for moral 
containment. This struggle frankly recalls what Nietzsche said made for 
great drama in The Birth of Tragedy, and goes a long way toward 
explaining why otherwise sober thinkers like Marshall Berman would trust
 Springsteen with their lives. <br>
<br>
To say Springsteen reliably delivers the cathartic goods is one way of 
putting it; another is to push the thesis here past the idea that 
Springsteen's power and originality lies in his moral address to the 
idea that Springsteen's music at its best is spiritually rejuvenative, 
even, in its modest way, religious. Which brings us back to what 
Springsteen called "The Ministry of Rock and Roll." <br>
<br>
II. "I'm Not Bullshittin' Back Here" <br>
<br>
Springsteen indeed does think that rock is ministerial; he does think 
it's redemptive; he does think that rock music literally saves people's 
lives -- ask Patti Smith, ask Eddie Vedder. He also knows that you can't
 just say this stuff straightaway without a mask, especially in front of
 20,000 people who can't keep their eyes off you. The mask supplies the 
necessary ironic distortion, and then you deliver the meaning, 
literally, in the moment, in the music. Live in New York City does this 
with nearly unparalleled power. <br>
<br>
I'm not going to go through the whole album, though it's tempting to 
note how the initial trio of songs ("My Love Will Not Let You Down," 
"Prove It All Night," "Two Hearts,") are entirely about, and 
passionately enact, Springsteen's commitment to his band and his 
audience, his commitment to the covenant he needs to help forge with his
 fans if the music is going to do its vital work. <br>
<br>
It's also tempting to drop a few hundred words about "Youngstown," which
 Springsteen has entirely transformed from its somber folk studio 
version (on The Ghost of Tom Joad) by lacing it with a new and monstrous
 rock guitar figure as well as a guitar solo (courtesy of Nils Lofgren) 
that with slow and accumulating power builds and then explodes past the 
dead-end nihilism in the lyrics ("When I die I don't want no part of 
heaven/ I would not do heaven's work well/ I pray the devil comes and 
takes me/ To stand in the fiery furnaces of hell") and forges for the 
song's suffering protagonist a steely dignity and grace. <br>
<br>
Finally, it seems necessary to remind ourselves that Bruce Springsteen 
was 50 years old when these concerts were recorded, and that it's 
difficult to imagine the other great rock singers of roughly 
Springsteen's generation -- McCartney, Daltrey, Van Morrison, Jagger, 
Plant -- or even anyone ten or twenty years younger than Springsteen - 
say, Bono, Zack de la Rocha or Vedder -- singing with his sheer power, 
range, expressiveness or energy over a three hour period. <br>
<br>
What I'd like to do is stick with the three songs that end the concert 
proper on the CD --the marathon showstopper "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out," 
and then the two new songs, "Land of Hope and Dreams," and "41 Shots." <br>
<br>
"Tenth Ave Freezeout" has served as a barnstorming finale in the past --
 it's a perfect number to introduce the band -- but while it does 
function that way here, Springsteen takes it to an entirely different 
place as well. He uses the song essentially the way he used "Light of 
Day" on earlier legs of the tour, to make manifest the spiritual purpose
 of the concert. He does it first by quieting down the song's R 'n' B 
stomp and slithering into a version of "Take Me to the River" which is 
equal parts Al Green and Jimmy Swaggart. (In the HBO filmed concert of 
the concert, first shown in April, there's even a close up of 
Springsteen's feet as they scoot and skip across the stage in mock 
tribute to Swaggart's ecstatic cross-the-stage shuffle.) Then slowing 
down further, he goes into an extended rap with the audience which 
borrows liberally from the styles of gospel revivalists and carnival 
barkers alike, though he never edges into straight parody, never gets 
merely "hilarious." Hiding behind the mask is a man who wants to mean 
everything he says. <br>
<br>
And this is what he says: <br>
<br>
That's where I want to go <br>
I want to go to that riverside <br>
I want to go to the river of life <br>
I want to go to that river of love <br>
I want to go to that river of faith <br>
And that river of hope. <br>
<br>
Tonight I want to go to that river of transformation <br>
Where you go to be changed. <br>
But you got to work at it -- that's right! <br>
<br>
I want to go that river of sanctification <br>
Where all life's graces and blessings fall down upon you like rain <br>
But you got to work at it. <br>
<br>
I want to go that river of resurrection <br>
Where everybody gets a second chance <br>
But you got to work at it. <br>
<br>
Tonight I want to go to that river of sexual healing -- and companionship <br>
I want to go find that river of joy and happiness. <br>
<br>
I'm not bullshittin' back here. <br>
<br>
But you don't stumble on those things by accident. <br>
You got to search them out, seek after them. <br>
And that's why we're here night after night after night after night. <br>
'Cause you can't get to those places by yourself <br>
You got to have help! <br>
<br>
That's where I want to go tonight <br>
And I want you to go with me <br>
Because I need to go with you--that's why I'm here. <br>
<br>
In these last two lines, which basically sum up the covenant, the circle
 of feeling the entire concert is about creating and affirming, you can 
hear him -- and see him on the HBO tape -- as he entirely drops the 
barker/revivalist voice to speak in a voice that is most his own. Then 
back to the mask: <br>
<br>
And tonight I want to throw a rock and roll exorcism! <br>
A rock and roll baptism! <br>
A rock and roll bar mitzvah! <br>
That's right! -- We're going to do it all tonight -- everything -- right now <br>
I want the waters to fall on me and set me free, set you free? <br>
<br>
Life, love, faith, hope, transformation, sanctification, resurrection, 
sexual healing, companionship, joy, happiness: Springsteen is not 
bullshittin' back here. Springsteen's faith in these things -- his faith
 in rock's ability to bring these things to life, in fact -- comes as a 
desperate lunge for sustenance when other forms of faith, specifically 
Christianity, fail. (From "Human Touch": "Ain't no mercy on the streets 
of this town / Ain't no bread from heavenly skies / Ain't nobody drawing
 wine from this blood / It's just you and me tonight"). <br>
<br>
In his early work, which is filled with fallen Catholic school boy 
images -- nuns, saints, crosses, church bells, etc -- there's no attempt
 to give the religious any weight, but since the late 80s, his lyrics 
have been filigreed with unironized religious images: "Cautious Man" 
(from Tunnel of Love) notes how the moonlight on the protagonist's 
wife's face fills "their room in the beauty of God's fallen light"; the 
tormented ex-lover in "I Wish I Were Blind" (from Human Touch) sees that
 "the world is filled / with the grace and beauty of God's hand"; the 
new father in "Living Proof" (from Lucky Town) calls his newborn son "a 
little piece of the Lord's undying light." The ritual, the rules, the 
submission of Christianity have dropped away, but the awe of the 
religious has remained and intensified, as has the sense of moral 
responsibility -- and for Springsteen it's rock and roll's job to help 
keep that awe, that responsibility and reverence toward life, alive. <br>
<br>
That's certainly the job of "Tenth Avenue Freezeout," which, after all 
the preachifying, plunges into a frenzy out of which Springsteen can 
hardly extricate himself. As you watch him extend the song into one more
 false finale after another, it's as if Springsteen's afraid to stop, as
 if he fears that the power, the glory, the ministry ends when the music
 does, and he can't stand it. Which is maybe why when his voice and body
 are just about ready to give out, he lets the guitars and drums surge 
to a giant crescendo and then he screams "SAVE ME SOMEBODY!" And if you 
have the HBO tape (the slo-mo button is great help here) you can look 
into his eyes and notice that he's stripped off the mask completely, and
 that he looks way past intense or committed or passionate or carried 
away and, for a brief moment, looks truly, beautifully insane. 
Possessed. <br>
<br>
III. "Faith Will Be Rewarded" <br>
<br>
The song that follows, "Land of Hope and Dreams," is a great hymn to 
America; not the real one, of course, but the dream America that accepts
 "saints and sinners," "losers and winners," "whores and gamblers"; the 
mythic America where "dreams will not be thwarted" and "bells of freedom
 ring." <br>
<br>
Lyrically, with the song's protagonist urging his love to join him on a 
train whose "big wheels roll through fields where sunlight streams," 
it's half Woody Guthrie and half Statue of Liberty opening her motherly 
arms. Without knowing Springsteen's back catalogue -- which is as 
chilling about darkness, evil, and unrelenting despair as any in rock 
("Adam Raised A Cain," "Point Blank," "Nebraska," "Seeds," "State 
Trooper," and much of The Ghost of Tom Joad hold up well against, say, 
"Gimme Shelter" or Tonight's the Night) -- the new song's lyrics might 
seem trite, the way Blake's Songs of Innocence can if they're not framed
 by the Songs of Experience. <br>
<br>
But in context -- that of Springsteen's career, and more specifically, 
of the concert this comes at the tail end of -- "Land of Hope and 
Dreams" sounds earned, an affirmation that survives the crucible of 
suffering which is particular to those mad enough to still dream 
America's dream. <br>
<br>
But the song isn't just about America. It's about rock and roll as the 
special American conduit through which faith, hope, and love gets 
created, strengthened, and rejuvenated through community. The song 
begins with the same call that animates "Thunder Road" and "Born to 
Run": Baby, let's hit the road. "We'll take what we can carry and we'll 
leave the rest... Meet me in a land of hope and dreams." And like those 
songs, in performance it doesn't just tell the characters' story, but 
the story that's happening at the moment Springsteen sings it. The 
burden carried by the simplicity of the song's optimism is something 
Springsteen is obviously aware of -- he has to make himself and the 
audience believe not only that America is a land of hope and dreams, but
 that it's worth thinking this is a land of hope and dreams. And the 
only way he can pull it off is make the experience of the song ring with
 such life, love, faith, transformation and all the rest that the 
experience becomes its own argument. For me, the song is overwhelming 
and unassailable. <br>
<br>
After the first two verses, the song veers into a bridge that for its 
final seven minutes it never leaves. We never get back to a verse or 
chorus. And the bridge keeps affirming "this train" that carries the 
weary, the downhearted, the lost, promising to them that "dreams will 
not be thwarted." And if the train is America, the train is more 
crucially the concert itself, is rock itself -- Springsteen, the band, 
and the audience in its covenant all stirring themselves to create the 
communal spiritual strength needed to believe, in the lyrics' central 
line, that "faith will be rewarded." <br>
<br>
It ain't easy. Springsteen's been singing his heart out for two and a 
half hours already, and he's worn out. The song, moreover, is hard on 
the lungs and vocal cords. But he keeps at it, the E Street Band 
building layer upon layer of noise and power, until Bruce quiets them 
down to focus on the lyrics again: <br>
<br>
This train... <br>
Carries saints and sinners <br>
This train... <br>
Carries losers and winners <br>
<br>
And his voice suddenly starts to falter. On the video, you look at him, 
sopping with sweat, his eyes almost puffed shut, and you think, "This 
song's got a long way to go, how's he going to get through this?" It's 
as if he's slipped off the train he's singing about and is hanging on by
 his fingernails, like some desperate character in a Depression road 
movie. But then you hear and watch him regather himself out of some deep
 reserve: <br>
<br>
This train... <br>
Carries lost souls <br>
This train... <br>
Dreams will not be thwarted <br>
This train... <br>
Faith will be rewarded <br>
<br>
And as he sings this last line, he raises his right palm into the air, 
facing the crowd (a gesture he repeats each time he sings these words) 
and it's suddenly true in the moment: His faith in the crowd, in the 
music, in the vision the song's about, has given him the strength to 
burn through the moment of his weariness and exhaustion, and to emerge 
with renewed energy to keep the song alive and kicking. Faith indeed has
 been rewarded. <br>
<br>
The song keeps going (clocking in, finally, at almost ten minutes), with
 Springsteen bringing the crowd closer to the song's ardor. At one 
point, he calls to the crowd, "Let me see your hands!" and the ensuing 
roar urges whatever hesitant stragglers there are in the audience to 
climb aboard the big steel wheels. Springsteen keeps it up, exhorting, 
begging the crowd to stay with him: "Come on this train... come on this 
train... come on this train..." because he knows he can't stay on it if 
they don't, and then comes a scream that's up there with the best of 
Roger Daltrey's: "Say Yeeeeeeaaaaahhhh! -- which is nothing less than a 
desperate plea for the audience to give itself over to the covenant ("I 
want you to go with me because I need to go with you -- that's why I'm 
here."). As it ends, the crowd's roar is as loud and intense for this 
brand new song as for any of his verified classics, and one realizes 
that that's because it worked, triumphantly, the song's faith begetting 
faith in the song, Springsteen's faith in his audience, his audience's 
faith in him. Rock's recurring mytho-poetic magic has done its work 
again -- and if the audience isn't sitting there trusting this man with 
their lives, they at least know that nothing feels better than faith 
that will be rewarded. <br>
<br>
IV. "Baptized in These Waters" <br>
<br>
That Springsteen doesn't call it a night at this point is a measure of 
his own rock fanaticism as well as his deep desire to continually 
complicate his vision. The stage darkens, the crowd roar drops (though 
not enough for Bruce: during the intro he says, "We're going to need 
some quiet"), and the band goes into the dark, elegiac "American Skin 
(41 Shots)," which is about the Amadou Diallo murder case, in which an 
unarmed black man was shot at 41 times by New York City police officers 
in February 1999. The song made news because some New York Police 
Association leaders, claiming the song was anti-cop, went after 
Springsteen in public. But as Hendrick Hertzberg pointed out in The New 
Yorker soon after the ruckus, the song isn't anti-anything: It's a 
tortured meditation on the fear and violence occasioned by the history 
of American racism. In separate verses, the song takes up the horror of 
the Amadou family ("You're kneeling over his body in the vestibule / 
Praying for his life"), the panic of the officers right before they shot
 him ("Is it a gun, is it a knife / Is it a wallet, this is your life"),
 and of a young ghetto mother who we imagine has heard of the case and 
cautions her child as he heads off to school ("If an officer stops you /
 Promise me you'll always be polite / And that you'll never ever run 
away / Promise Mama you'll keep your hands in sight"). The band's four 
guitars and two keyboards build to an excruciating tension, which 
reaches its apogee when Springsteen sings: <br>
<br>
41 Shots... and we'll take that ride <br>
-- Cross that bloody river <br>
To the other side. <br>
<br>
41 Shots...got my boots caked in this mud <br>
-- We're baptized in these waters <br>
And in each others' blood. <br>
<br>
This is the concert's Song of Experience to counter "Land of Hope and 
Dreams," and it's perfectly poised. The river of life, love, hope, 
faith, transformation, sanctification, resurrection, sexual healing and 
companionship, joy and happiness alongside which the train gloriously 
rides in "Land of Hope and Dreams" is also a river of blood where "You 
can get killed just for living / In your American skin." And with that 
awful, awe-inspiring juxtaposition, Springsteen ends his concert and 
sends his fans back into the world. <br>
<br>
Springsteen's "ministry" preaches strength, love and faith before 
suffering and radical ambiguity. He borrows a Christian idiom, ironizes 
and then recovers it. It's a humanism produced by a community observing 
the laws of its covenant, finally, but a humanism juiced by whatever it 
is about rock's power that makes us feel that desire, dreams, and life 
itself are sacred. <br>
<br>
"Hold holy your highest hope," Nietzsche said. Springsteen is one of the
 few popular artists now who can credibly work at that level of 
romanticism and spiritual affirmation.</div>

When I caught Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band in Philadelphia in
 late March, it was the eighth night of the band’s US and European tour,
 which would go on for another six or seven months. While the songs 
change with the release of new albums, like this year’s Wrecking Ball, 
the structure of the show has remained relatively constant for nearly 
three decades now. It is, as Springsteen told 60 Minutes, “part circus, 
dance party, political rally and big tent revival.” The sum of these 
parts forms an incomparably larger whole, one that has no equivalent in 
American life and culture.<br>
<br>
Across town, the National Constitution Center on Independence Mall was 
hosting an exhibition titled “From Asbury Park to the Promised Land: The
 Life and Music of Bruce Springsteen,” in which Springsteen’s old 
clothing, guitars, cars and lyric sheets were treated alternately as 
holy relics and fodder for scholarly studies—which for many fans and 
scholars, they are. Drummer “Mighty” Max Weinberg paid a visit to it 
after giving a lecture at the new National Museum of American Jewish 
History down the Mall, in which he spoke of his work in the band as his 
way “of living a life of tikkun olam.” (And if all this is a bit too 
much for you, then take heart in the cover of the alternative 
Philadelphia Weekly, on which Springsteen was pictured beneath a halo 
and above the headline, Enough Already.)<br>
<br>
I could go on, but you get the point: each Springsteen concert is an 
event so unique in our cynicism-besotted culture that relatively sane 
people like yours truly keep going back for more, after 200 shows and 
counting. (This is not a lot by true fan standards, trust me.) In 2003 
Springsteen decided, after more than thirty years of touring, to keep 
adding stadium show after stadium show at the Jersey Meadowlands until 
fans finally felt they got enough. He stopped at ten, selling 600,000 
tickets—more than any one artist has ever sold in a single place 
anywhere, anytime, and he could have kept going.<br>
<br>
It’s hard to find an analogue for Bruce Springsteen anywhere in American
 history. Musically, he is an amalgam of so many disparate influences it
 looks ridiculous to list them together. (Don’t believe me? OK, here 
goes: Elvis, Dylan, James Brown, Chuck Berry, Hank Williams, Woody 
Guthrie, Frank Sinatra, Sam &amp; Dave, the Shirelles, King Curtis, the 
Rolling Stones, the Animals, Roy Orbison, Gary “U.S.” Bonds, the Sex 
Pistols, Pete Seeger, the Swinging Medallions, Sam Cooke, Smokey 
Robinson, Jackie Wilson, Wilson Pickett…) But it is equally difficult to
 locate a proper political antecedent for Springsteen in American 
history. Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger are the obvious nominees, but the
 fact that they were associated with the Communist Party, as well as 
pretty orthodox folk singers, significantly limited their ability to be 
heard by many Americans. Springsteen, meanwhile, has managed to give 
voice to political values—what he calls “news with a beat”—that fall 
well leftward of the boundaries of mainstream political discourse.<br>
<br>
This happened almost entirely by accident. Springsteen began his career 
singing about guitars, cars and girls before moving on to empty 
factories and abandoned quarries. His songs began as stories of 
individual characters divorced from what Trotsky called “the dialectic,”
 until, in the early 1980s, he began to read deeply in American history 
and literature. Springsteen began to ask questions of himself about what
 really determined the contours of the lives of the working-class 
characters whose tribune he had become. “A lot of the core of our songs 
is the American idea: What is it? What does it mean? ‘Promised Land,’ 
‘Badlands,’” he would explain in 2009, decades after the transformation 
took place. “I’ve seen people singing those songs back to me all over 
the world. I’d seen that country on a grassroots level…. And I met 
people who were always working toward the country being that kind of 
place. But on a national level it always seemed very far away.”<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
Raised in Freehold, New Jersey, the first-born child of Irish and 
Italian parents, Springsteen’s father, Douglas, was an embittered man 
who struggled to find a place for himself in the local economy. He 
worked for brief periods in the local rug mill, as a jail guard and as a
 cab and bus driver. Adele Springsteen, who worked as a legal secretary,
 took pride in her professional identity and remained in the same job 
for Bruce’s entire childhood. To Bruce she “was just like superwoman. 
She did everything, everywhere, all the time.”<br>
<br>
The Springsteens lived in a lower-middle-class section of town called 
Texas, where a group of Appalachian refugees had come together with a 
smattering of white ethnics in one of America’s less publicized 
migrations. Yet the town was largely bypassed by the prosperity of the 
1950s and ’60s. Most of the available work came from the local 3M 
factory, a rug mill, a Nescafé factory and a number of much smaller 
manufacturers. Deeply segregated, Freehold’s whites and blacks lived on 
opposite sides of the railroad track.<br>
<br>
A loner par excellence, in high school Bruce participated in no 
activities, sports or even much in the way of academics. One of his 
teachers even suggested to his classmates that, for the sake of their 
own “self-respect,” Bruce not be allowed to graduate, given the 
indecency of his hair. After only the briefest appearance at community 
college, Springsteen practiced his craft obsessively, partaking in few 
of the late ’60s rituals that characterized the life of the rock 
musician. His early lyrics were rarely political, save the occasional 
mocking of the pretensions of the Woodstock generation with lyrics like 
“Take LSD and Off the Pigs.” Springsteen was interested in personal 
freedom—the right to be who he wanted to be, even if he didn’t know 
precisely who or what that was.<br>
<br>
Springsteen would go on to achieve almost unimaginable degrees of fame 
and national attention. In October 1975 he catapulted overnight from a 
virtual nobody with two critically acclaimed but commercially obscure 
albums to his credit to the first entertainer ever to simultaneously 
grace the covers of Time and Newsweek. The vehicle for this 
transformation, the now-classic Born to Run album, may be seen as a 
counternarrative to the culture of mid-’70s America, offering hope in 
hard times, but it was not political by any literal interpretation.<br>
<br>
Despite this taste of megastardom, Springsteen stayed out of the 
spotlight in the years immediately following as he fought his manager 
for creative control of his career. Springsteen repeatedly refused, 
against the advice of his lawyers, to give in on even the most minor 
points. As he explained to a judge at the time: “My interest is in my 
career, which up until now holds the promise of my being able to 
significantly contribute to, and possibly influence, a generation of 
music. No amount of money could compensate me if I were to lose this 
opportunity.”<br>
<br>
He took his music gradually from the personal to the political. Born to 
Run led to the grim but powerful Darkness at the Edge of Town, which led
 to the raucous The River, which led to Nebraska, a stark, Woody 
Guthrie–like album recorded at home on a cassette tape recorder. 
Released in 1982 as national unemployment reached 11 percent (and while 
President Reagan complained that he was tired of hearing about it every 
time someone lost a job in “South Succotash”), the album offered an 
intimate portrait of the people victimized by America’s winner-take-all 
economy.<br>
<br>
This work was filled with what literary historian Bryan Garman calls 
“working-class geographies,” like closed factories, mines and mills. For
 Springsteen, Garman writes, “These markers—the industrial town, the 
factory, and the neighborhood bar—have become so marginalized that it is
 impossible to forge a collective working-class identity which provides 
people with a sense of self-worth.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen remained cautious to a fault when it came to traditional 
politics, consistently resisting myriad pleadings to lend his reputation
 for integrity to one cause or another. He spent much of this period, as
 he put it, “tryin’ to figure out now where do aesthetic issues that you
 write about intersect with some sort of concrete action, some direct 
involvement, in the communities that your audience comes from.” At his 
first-ever political concert appearance in 1979 to protest nuclear 
power, he left his part of the printed concert program wordless. Three 
years later, when he made a surprise appearance with a single song 
alongside Jackson Browne at a 750,000-person nuclear freeze rally in 
Central Park, he again let the music do all the talking.<br>
<br>
Springsteen made his first stab at direct political involvement after 
reading Ron Kovic’s harrowing Vietnam memoir, Born on the Fourth of 
July, which would inspire the Oliver Stone film. Speaking from the stage
 at a series of Los Angeles fundraising concerts, surrounded by 
handicapped veterans, Springsteen compared his learning process to 
“walking down a dark street at night and you see somebody getting a 
beating in an alley. You want to keep walking because you don’t want to 
feel involved, but you feel guilty.”<br>
<br>
If Nebraska had been Springsteen’s quietest album, then what followed 
it, 1984’s Born in the USA, would be his loudest. Released as America 
was undergoing an orgy of right-wing patriotism during Ronald Reagan’s 
“Morning in America” re-election campaign, Springsteen suddenly found 
himself at the center of America’s political debate. The album, another 
commercial breakthrough, became Columbia’s bestselling album to that 
point in its history, and Springsteen’s world tour was an event of 
political and cultural significance—widely understood to represent an 
alternative model of American patriotism from that so ominously 
emanating from the Reagan White House.<br>
<br>
In a story that has been told and retold many times now, the 
conservative columnist George Will attended a Springsteen concert with 
cotton in his ears, and after leaving at midpoint in the show, offered 
up Springsteen as a right-wing icon. The president’s staff read the 
column and sought to hijack Springsteen’s left-wing patriotic bombast 
and turn it into right-wing patriotic bombast. Springsteen resisted, 
warning audiences with respect to Reagan’s war plans for Central America
 that “blind faith in your leaders can get you killed.” But the train 
had left the station and in truth, “Born in the USA” invited 
misinterpretation, as few people listen to rock music for the lyrics.<br>
<br>
The shock of such success led Springsteen to pull back again and 
inspired a long period of fitful personal growth and therapy, marriage, 
divorce and a second marriage; breaking up his band and then 
reconstituting it, moving to Los Angeles and then back again to New 
Jersey. During this period he would occasionally emerge with musical 
statements that sometimes spoke to the country’s cultural/political 
moment and sometimes stood outside it. He took part in a worldwide tour 
for Amnesty International. When Springsteen wrote and sang “Streets of 
Philadelphia,” he became the first prominent male singer to explicitly 
adopt the voice of a gay man. His largely acoustic 1995 album, The Ghost
 of Tom Joad, was a self-conscious re-creation of John Steinbeck’s (and 
John Ford’s) proletarian masterpiece The Grapes of Wrath, with songs 
drawn directly from stories in the newspapers. With its descriptions of 
railroad transients, people around a fire under a bridge, homeless 
people waiting in line for shelter and families sleeping in their car, 
the album was an implicit rebuke to the corporate-friendly politics of 
“triangulation” practiced by Bill Clinton at the time. Appropriately, 
Springsteen chose as his next cause that of legalizing (and honoring) 
Latino immigration, fighting against a proposed extremely punitive 
California law—Proposition 187—which united him with farmworkers, home 
workers and others who had hitherto been merely the subject of his 
songs.<br>
<br>
After a nearly fourteen-year break, Springsteen reconstituted the E 
Street Band in 1999 for a reunion tour and premiered the song “American 
Skin (41 Shots),” a pointed racial commentary in the aftermath of the 
shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed Guinean immigrant, and the 
acquittal of four police officers who had fired at him forty-one times. 
The song angered some fans, particularly policemen, and once again he 
was roundly misinterpreted. The lyrics were actually sympathetic to the 
officers, but their representatives denounced Springsteen, and quite a 
few beat cops booed the song when he performed it in concert. It was his
 first taste of a fan backlash, but he held his ground. (Springsteen 
played it on night one in Philadelphia after explaining, “This is for 
Trayvon.”)<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
September 11, 2001, returned Springsteen to the crossroads of American 
culture. As the story goes, he was pulling out of a New Jersey parking 
lot when a man in another car rolled down his window and shouted, “We 
need you!” The Rising was a major cultural event of 2002, and it was 
treated by the media as the equivalent of a presidential address. 
Employing explicitly religious imagery, Springsteen called upon people 
to “rise up” to their better angels—not out of vengeance but out of 
mutual understanding, rising above even reality. In the Muslim/Christian
 love story “Worlds Apart,” he sang, “Sometimes the truth just ain’t 
enough/Or is it too much in times like this/Let’s throw the truth away.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen continued to believe that an artist should act as a “canary 
in the coal mine…with a certain distance from the seat of power.” But he
 found himself chafing on the sidelines of the fight to save the country
 from the consequences of George W. Bush’s re-election. Given that he 
had set for himself the task of charting “the distance between American 
ideals and American reality,” once the country “reached a point where it
 seems that we’re so intent on protecting ourselves that we’re willing 
to destroy the best parts of ourselves to do so,” he felt he had no 
choice but to throw himself into the election process with the full 
force of his music, his reputation and the risks to both that an 
unambiguous political stance would mean.<br>
<br>
Springsteen led a tour of politically sympathetic friends like Jackson 
Browne, Bonnie Raitt, John Fogerty and James Taylor, doing concerts for 
the Kerry campaign in battleground states under the rubric of “Vote for 
Change.” His “No Surrender” became Kerry’s campaign theme. He gave 
speeches at these events about the darkness that had descended on the 
country under Bush, then agreed to travel the country by Kerry’s side, 
guitar in hand, singing before Kerry’s speeches like a rock ‘n’ roll 
Uncle Sam: the performer giving the politician/war hero credibility with
 segments of the citizenry with whom he would otherwise likely fail to 
connect.<br>
<br>
Following Kerry’s defeat, Springsteen toured with a makeshift folk troop
 he assembled in the spirit of Pete Seeger’s hootenanny shows. With the 
band, he toured the country in 2006 preaching against “rendition, 
illegal wiretapping, voter suppression, no habeas corpus, the neglect of
 that great city New Orleans and its people, an attack on the 
Constitution. And the loss of our best men and women in a tragic war.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen kept it up through the 2008 election, endorsing Barack Obama
 over Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination and touring the 
country on behalf of his candidacy in the general election against John 
McCain. On the eve of Obama’s inauguration, standing before the Lincoln 
Memorial, he sang “The Rising” for the president, the vice president, 
their families and a group of American dignitaries together with a crowd
 estimated at 400,000, and backed by a multiracial chorus of young 
people. He then joined Pete Seeger for a rousing (and complete) version 
of “This Land Is Your Land.”<br>
<br>
It was a rare and beautiful moment for this country and what remained of
 its progressive tradition, one in which Guthrie’s anti-capitalist 
anthem became “a part of the beating heart of the nation,” as 
Springsteen told the 2012 SXSW conference in Austin. But what did this 
magical moment mean in the realm of actual politics? The answer, as we 
all know now, was not to be found in a folk song—not even one in which 
the newly elected African-American president-elect could be seen tapping
 his feet and singing along.<br>
<br>
Following the death last year of his beloved saxophonist and longtime 
character foil, Clarence “Big Man” Clemons, Springsteen returned in 
March with what strikes most people as his angriest and most explicitly 
political album yet: Wrecking Ball. Speaking to reporters in Paris on 
the occasion of its release, he made the album’s inspiration—and 
intention—explicit. “The genesis of the record was after 2008,” he told a
 group of reporters there earlier this year, “when we had the huge 
financial crisis in the States, and there was really no accountability 
for years and years. People lost their homes, and I had friends who were
 losing their homes, and nobody went to jail. Nobody was responsible. 
People lost enormous amounts of their net worth. Previous to Occupy Wall
 Street, there was no pushback: there was no movement, there was no 
voice that was saying just how outrageous—that a basic theft had 
occurred that struck at the heart of what the entire American idea was 
about. It was a complete disregard of history, of context, of community;
 it was all about ‘what can I get today.’ It was just an enormous fault 
line that cracked the American system wide open.”<br>
<br>
The album’s opener, “We Take Care of Our Own,” is intended to be more 
aspirational and inquisitive than accurate or descriptive but has 
nevertheless already been adopted by the Obama campaign as part of its 
official rally mixtape. The driving force of the album, however, is a 
decidedly un-Obama-like anger at the increasing injustice of the 
American economic system. And yet despite the (sometimes violent) fury 
of his characters—one sings of irresponsible and exploitative bankers, 
“If I had me a gun, I’d find the bastards and shoot ‘em on sight”—Bruce 
Springsteen’s America remains one of shared optimism and collective 
responsibility. It is a land of “hope and dreams” where “dreams will not
 be thwarted” and “faith will be rewarded.” The stories change, but the 
“message” remains the same. It’s right there in Wrecking Ball: “Hold 
tight to your anger, and don’t fall to your fear.”</div>
