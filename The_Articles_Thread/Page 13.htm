<br>
Rod Tootell, Rock's Backpages, July 2008<br>
<br>
Rod Tootell asks how well-served the Boss has been by his official live recordings – and nominates his Top 20 tracks.<br>
<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN ON TOUR (Bloomsbury) is the third book Dave Marsh has 
written about Bruce Springsteen, and its tone varies little from its 
predecessors.<br>
<br>
As usual Marsh is at pains to point out how Springsteen has delighted 
fans all around the world delivering shows – sometimes up to four hours 
long – that seldom if ever disappoint. Springsteen, we learn again, is a
 performer with a conscience, making sure he gives value for money, 
trading in humour, romance, energy, and political commitment. At the 
same time, Marsh wants us to get The Message that Springsteen is 
spreading. When one cuts to the chase, the message seems to boil down to
 this: that given a certain amount of belief in ourselves, we can all 
live up to our true potential and not be dragged down by the pressures 
that life that slowly tangle around us as we start to leave behind those
 carefree days of youth. At least I think that's what it is.<br>
<br>
It's here that the befuddled fan may start to feel a little 
short-changed. Bruce Springsteen on Tour is meant to describe 
Springsteen's life on tour and yet the insights normally reserved for a 
book of this nature are mostly missing. So who always gets to sit at the
 back of the tour bus? What do they play at the sound checks? Does 
Springsteen really go home after delivering an explosion of rock and 
roll and start writing songs for his new Nebraska album?<br>
<br>
Strangely there are no interviews with the members of the E Street Band.
 There is one occasion where we learn that Roy Bittan and Nils Lofgren 
find themselves heavily involved in a game of table tennis, only to hear
 the opening chords of 'Born in the U.S.A.' thundering above their 
heads. Marsh appears to treat this as a worrying episode, as if some of 
the class have misbehaved, which may upset Teacher. In fact, Marsh comes
 across very much as Teacher's Pet, still intent on converting the rest 
of the class to how great Teacher is. Even after 23 years he feels he 
must once again recount the moment on Springsteen's birthday when a fan 
gave him a cake on stage. Springsteen duly kicked it back into the crowd
 shouting "Send me the cleaning bill!" Marsh is still deeply shocked by 
this but needs to get it out of the way so as to show his impartiality. 
Most of us would I think be pleased to know that the Boss is human. So 
he gets a little grumpy once in a while. Thank God for that.<br>
<br>
A less reverential book about Springsteen would surely be welcome. There
 is no doubt that he is a phenomenal writer, able to switch from pure 
pop to complex vignettes of American life. These various sides to his 
craft are showcased in his live performances, but many cannot see him as
 anything more than the stadium singer of the '80s. Whether this book 
does anything to change this attitude is debatable.<br>
<br>
There's another way in which fans are short-changed by Bruce Springsteen
 on Tour. Marsh's book suggests that you had to be there. Well, some of 
us were there, but many have only become fans within the last ten or 
fifteen years and the live material that CBS/Sony has made available 
over the years has been oddly wrong-footed. It's hard to know whether 
this is due to the lack of thought on behalf of Springsteen and manager 
John Landau or possibly too much of it. In the light of the simultaneous
 release of Human Touch and Lucky Town, there seems to be a strange 
combination of inertia and spontaneity when it comes to releasing 
Springsteen's albums.<br>
<br>
In 1975 we awaited a great live album to show that all the media hype 
about his live performances was true. It never came, one assumes because
 the lawsuit between Springsteen and his ex-manager excluded any 
releases. A steady stream of bootlegs kept us going, but these were of 
varying quality. No one was complaining though. The Darkness on the Edge
 of Town tour was well-bootlegged, the only CBS live material showing up
 on the No Nukes album. When Live 1975-85 appeared it simply wasn't good
 enough. This was no live concert but more a catalogue of live material,
 not a representation of what a live Springsteen gig was all about. At 
the same time, it was heavily weighted towards material from the 1984/85
 tour. There were odd choices. 'Darlington County' and 'Seeds' but no 
'Jungleland'. Highlights included 'Racing in the Street', 'Independence 
Day' and three songs from Nebraska.<br>
<br>
The next offering was In Concert/MTV Plugged, again not a real show and 
not even with the E St Band. Versions of 'Wish I Were Blind' and 'If I 
Should Fall Behind' are great but it ain't the real deal. Then we have 
Live in New York City, which seemed to be patched together from two 
concerts. Added to this are six bonus tracks (this on its first official
 release). Quite where they came from is anybody's guess. Since 
Springsteen had no new album to promote it's likely that this was simply
 a showcase for two songs, 'Land of Hope and Dreams' and 'American 
Skin.'<br>
<br>
In 2007 came Live in Dublin from the Seeger Sessions tour. This is a 
patch of three nights and is way overlong. One CD would have been enough
 to get the real juice from what was a great tour. Which brings us to 
Hammersmith Odeon '75, the album that should have been released in 1976,
 the one that could have done the job in the first place. Springsteen 
believed that this concert was the worst he had ever played. When many 
of us who were there heard about this, we struggled to work out how 
blinded we must have been. But then we weren't and when Springsteen 
listened to the tapes on the 30th anniversary of Born to Run he realised
 he'd been wrong all along.<br>
<br>
This is a real concert, showing, as Springsteen notes "an E St Band.... 
armed with a set list that I still dare any young band to match... with 
the keys to the kingdom dangling in front of us and a knife at our neck,
 we'd gone for broke." Listening to 'Tenth Avenue Freeze-out', 'She's 
the One' and 'It's Hard to be a Saint in the City' you can hear that how
 right he is. This was released with no fanfare at all and I know few 
Springsteen fans who ever discuss it. But it is at least released and it
 is representative of what we were looking for all along.<br>
<br>
So what of the other material that could have been released instead of 
the dodgy official ones? Some of those early bootlegs bearing titles 
such as You Can Trust Your Car To The Man Who Wears The Star and Paid 
the Cost to be The Boss were mostly from radio broadcasts that arrived 
in England on scratchy vinyl or over recorded cassettes. Listening to 
some of this material on the internet in their original form you wonder 
that some of it has remained hidden for so long.<br>
<br>
A concert from The Main Point, Philadelphia in 1975 was recently 
released in a series called Transmissions, not I think from the Sony 
camp but in any case with only selected tracks. Unfortunately it leaves 
out the glorious version of 'Incident on 57th Street' with Suki Lahav on
 violin. Then there's the concert from Dave Marsh's rightfully-heralded 
1975 nights at the Bottom Line featuring a great version of Jackie de 
Shannon's 'When You Walk in the Room'. A memorable gig from New York in 
1976 has a lengthy version of the Animals' 'It's My Life', during which 
Springsteen describes the stormy relationship he had with his father.<br>
<br>
One show that you feel could easily have made it onto an official 
release is the 1978 concert from Winterland, San Francisco. This is a 
real Springsteen concert, similar to what we were to experience in 1981 
but darker and heavier. The guitar work from Springsteen and Miami Steve
 is outstanding. Live versions of 'The Fever', 'Because the Night' and 
'Point Blank' have never been played better, the latter knocking spots 
off the version that ended up on The River.<br>
<br>
From then on the live material seems to lose its edge. The bootlegs fail
 to capture the stadium sound as well as at the smaller venues. The 
vocals sound brasher and the guitars don't come through as well. This 
situation doesn't resolve itself until around 2002 when the venues get 
smaller again and the recording techniques improve.<br>
<br>
However, running parallel to these stadium tours are Springsteen's solo 
shows, and here sound quality is no problem. Springsteen had never 
played a solo tour before 1996 when he went out to promote The Ghost of 
Tom Joad. The results as seen at the Albert Hall were compelling but 
rather awkward. The concert he played in Paris that year is a different 
story. Here he approached the material in a relaxed mood. If the album 
itself was initially hard to connect to, this concert is a revelation. 
Springsteen talks each song in with a detailed introduction and they all
 start to make sense. He offers up a selection of stories showing 
various characters victimised by their environment. He plays 
exquisitely, comfortable in a new skin. This is a concert that deserves 
to be heard.<br>
<br>
Lastly there is the Devils and Dust tour of 2005 when he went solo 
again. This time he didn't just keep to the album with a few chosen 
oldies to bolster up the set. It has been said that this was the tour 
when Bruce Springsteen discovered Bruce Springsteen. It is definitely 
the tour when no song was off limits. He aired songs that he hadn't 
played for 30 years, mostly done with real care. 'Two Hearts' is a 
different song, a better song, 'Reason to Believe' sounds like the cry 
of the hobo with a bottle of whisky inside him and a hellhound on his 
trail. 'My Beautiful Reward' is played on a pump organ. 'Cautious Man' 
and 'Valentine's Day' are both stunning. It's not just the songs but 
also the easy rapport with the audience that was missing from the 1996 
tour. When he played 'The Wish' in London, Springsteen said he wasn't 
sure about singing a song about his mother because we were such 'a bunch
 of cynical bastards' over here. Very true. Springsteen cynics would 
find it hard to keep it up after watching any of these shows. He 
finished most nights with a haunting version of Suicide's 'Dream Baby 
Dream'.<br>
<br>
Maybe live albums have to be released near to the albums that they 
represent but the trend seems to suggest otherwise. Older material, such
 as Springsteen's Tracks, Dylan's' Bootleg Series and Van Morrison's 
Philosopher's Stone, has been warmly welcomed. Springsteen has said that
 he has another Tracks up his sleeve. Why not include some live 
material?<br>
<br>
To any Springsteen fan it is the music that thrills, not the knowledge 
that he is a good person, spreading the message of rock'n'roll 
salvation. So let's redress the balance. Perhaps Dave Marsh could hand 
over the baton to someone else, and some of this great music could see 
the light of day.<br>

				<div class="content">Steve Van Zandt: Miami, Bruce, and Roots<br>
<br>
Harvey Kubernik, Melody Maker, 6 November 1976<br>
<br>
LOS ANGELES: Miami Steve Van Zandt has been in Bruce Springsteen's band 
for over a year now, and also finds time these days to guide the career 
of Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes.<br>
<br>
When I saw him in L.A. he was clad in a baggy white suit and matching 
loafers, along with a tam covering his curly brown hair. Dressed to 
kill, he resembled a big city pimp. A far cry from the puka shells in 
the audience at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium that night.<br>
<br>
Steve smiles when asked about the outstanding version of 'It's My Life',
 the Animals classic which has been worked up into a 20-minute 
mini-drama in Bruce's act.<br>
<br>
"That was at a soundcheck," he remembers. "When we do a soundcheck we 
jam and mess around on songs by the Four Tops, Marvin Gaye and the 
Sixties English things. 'It's My Life' started there. Bein' the 
brilliant cat he is, Bruce put that rap in which was so revealing.<br>
<br>
"We learned a lot on the Southern tour we Just did. We learned that Time
 and Newsweek cover stories are meaningless to people. These magazines 
make sense to the people who already know you or the small portion in 
big cities who respond to that. Down there it was very much Bruce who? 
It was especially rewarding when they were standing at the end."<br>
<br>
Some people were turned off by the hard-sell presentation of Bruce and 
the E Street gang as the greatest thing since sliced bread. Did Steve 
think the deserved hype turned off some potential fans?<br>
<br>
"I don't think it did anything except for the people who never saw the 
band live. Like Steve Stills, He said some pretty heavy things against 
us, and I know he never saw us in action. I ran into him and invited him
 down, and he didn't show.<br>
<br>
"Once somebody sees the band they can't possibly not like it. There's a 
difference between recording and the live situation. The albums give you
 a chance to know the songs and lyrics, and then that's expanded playing
 live.<br>
<br>
"It gives you a broader sense of who he is," he argues. "It would be kinda boring to see an identical record."<br>
<br>
From their last L.A. appearance at the Roxy, pianist Roy Bittan has 
worked with Bowie, tenorist Clarence Clemons has acted in New York, New 
York, the Martin Scorsese film, and Steve is heavily involved with the 
career of Southside Johnny. With all this alternative activity, the band
 are still thick as thieves.<br>
<br>
"Bruce is the best possible boss," he says, munching over a kosher dill.
 "He's hip enough to let everybody do their own thing, to express in 
other ways. All that does is make your gig better. When you go back to 
playing in the band it's like comin' home to foundation and security.<br>
<br>
"We look like we have fun on stage 'cause we do. Ninety-nine out of 100 
shows I enjoy as much as the audience. I think it shows up there. We're 
not playing baseball stadiums.<br>
<br>
"People aren't spectators, they're friends. The people stay with us. We 
have a real loyal following. In anybody else's case two years between 
albums would have been a disaster because Bruce Springsteen isn't a 
household word.<br>
<br>
"The people we play to don't like us – they love us. It comes from 
playing clubs and small theatres two years longer than the business 
would have suggested.<br>
<br>
"Small places have created this thing other bands seem to miss when they
 go for the bread and the 50,000-seaters. That's cool. It doesn't matter
 to me."<br>
<br>
Springsteen's is one of the few groups around today carrying on 
traditional rock and roll. "I don't wake up in the morning feeling I'm 
carrying on a tradition," Van Zandt smiles.<br>
<br>
"We're a roots rock group. We're conscious of it. I'm doing things not 
innovative, but we're always modernising the situation as much as 
possible. That's one of the reasons we use Jimmy Iovine as engineer. 
He's the best. A contemporary cat. We get a balance between us. If I had
 it my way we'd do the records in mono," he laughs.<br>
<br>
"I think it's a prerequisite that it's derivative. It's obvious where it
 comes from. I just worry it will be considered a throwback or an oldie.
 These words scare me.<br>
<br>
"I go home and someone puts on the new Peter Frampton album, and I then 
put Sam &amp; Dave's Greatest Hits on the turntable and I feel it was 
released yesterday. In Bruce's case, he's cool. He's innovative, and 
creative, and lyrically beyond any problems.<br>
<br>
"Every night I hear him change the rap between songs. That's gotta 
happen. We're not robots or actors. Why write a song or play one if it 
doesn't change or no-one is getting off? That's why I never understood 
the top 40 trip.<br>
<br>
"Every night you respond to something different. Tonight he mentioned 
Kingsley and Ocean Avenue in 'It's My Life'. I know where he's comin' 
from, but only 15 people in the crowd know where the f – those streets 
are.<br>
<br>
"But there's universal street corners, and no-one feels isolated or left
 out. The Stones used to talk about places in England (Knightsbridge in 
'Play With Fire') and everyone could relate. Maybe it even added to it, 
not being a common place."<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: Shouldn't He Be Famous?<br>
<br>
Dave Marsh, Let It Rock, December 1974<br>
<br>
IT WAS DIFFICULT to tell just when the stage caved in. It seemed to 
happen during 'Rosalita', the last song before the encore. But maybe 
that's just when the crush of Bruce Springsteen fans seeking to touch 
their hero began.<br>
<br>
Whenever it started, by the time the show was over, the success of 
Springsteen's first concert at Avery Fisher Hall in New York could be 
measured visibly. In the orchestra pit, collapsed and demolished, lay 
the front three feet of the stage. The weight of the crowd had snapped 
it from its moorings. Fortunately, no one was hurt.<br>
<br>
Bruce who?<br>
Bruce Springsteen, the young singer-songwriter from Asbury Park, NJ who 
many people feel is going to be the greatest new rock star of the 
seventies. With his mangy beard, and his greasy hair, he reminds many of
 that other symbol of alienation, James Dean. Dressed in an inevitably 
sleeveless T-shirt and mirror sunglasses no matter how dark the hall, 
Springsteen, playing guitar and singing, is the most mesmerizing rock 
performer to emerge since Bette Midler.<br>
<br>
But of course, his appeal, like his appearance, is antithetical to 
Midler's. When Springsteen chooses an old hit to perform, he'll reach 
for Sam Cooke's 'Cupid', or the Crystals 'Then I Kissed Him', or perhaps
 Gary US Bonds' 'Quarter To Three'. When he wants a new song, he'll 
write it himself, with a sense of rhythmic invention and a penchant for 
weird guitar lines that makes him a match for even those masters of the 
musically macabre, Steely Dan.<br>
<br>
Springsteen has been recording and performing in the national eye since 
1972. In that time, he's been compared, at one time or another, and with
 varying degrees of seriousness, to Bob Dylan, Elvis Presley and Van 
Morrison. And even though his two albums, Greetings From Asbury Park, NJ
 and The Wild, The Innocent And The E Street Shuffle, have only sold 
about 100,000 copies between them, the response that he elicits is akin 
to fanaticism. When his first single, 'Blinded By The light', was 
released, Clive Davis, then president of Columbia Records, stood up at a
 company meeting and read the lyrics, verbatim, aloud. When he made an 
appearance in Boston last spring, Rolling Stone record-review editor Jon
 Landau, ordinarily given to cynicism, wrote, "I have just seen rock and
 roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen." When he played Avery 
Fisher Hall Oct. 4, I watched a rock critic who hadn't bought a concert 
seat in years pay for a ticket and come out beaming.<br>
<br>
Why? Because Bruce Springsteen, as much as any other rock and roll waif 
who's come down the pike in this decade, can make you feel that rock 
music has a future. He can do everything. He writes lyrics that put 
Dylan's recent work to shame, evoking the seedy pastures of southern New
 Jersey and the dark criminal environments of his Manhattan haunts with 
an off-hand sense of wonder. He is wantonly sexual, physically imposing,
 though he is of diminutive stature. His hips, like Presley's, tell the 
tale. When he mimes one of his improbable tales of adolescent passion, 
he does so more provocatively than David Bowie or any of the other 
heralded practitioners of rock theatre. He is a perfectly choreographed 
rhythm machine, who duck walks like Chuck Berry and mugs like Dylan in 
his early, Chaplinesque days.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is also an impressive guitar player. He steps out to 
introduce a new song, and says, with utter arrogance, "You don't mess 
around with a beat like this. It makes good girls bad and bad girls 
worse." Scarily enough, when he plays the Bo Diddley-inflected 'She's 
The One', good girls all around get bad, and bad ones worse.<br>
<br>
The fact that he has one of the most dynamic rock bands in the world is 
an aid. His sax player, Clarence Clemmons is the most soulful horn 
player since the demise of King Curtis. The recently departed pianist, 
David Sancious, used to add Mozart quotations to the second album's 
masterpiece, 'New York City Serenade.' His replacement is no slouch 
either. When a gunshot is called for, the drummer adds it. And in a 
touch of pure bluster, the group now features a slight, blonde female 
violinist. But Springsteen dominates, a ball of energy who can play for 
more than two hours, as he did at his Fisher concert, with no noticeable
 letup.<br>
<br>
Of course, if Springsteen is that good, shouldn't he be famous? There is
 a variety of explanations for his lack of commercial success, the most 
plausible being that his recordings have been poorly produced. On both, 
the drumming (with a drummer not now in the group) is feeble, and the 
sound is less than it ought to be. The answer, some suggest, is a live 
recording, a device that worked for the Allman Brothers, another group 
that was hailed long before it made it to the top.<br>
<br>
Of course, nothing less than the top will do for Springsteen. His songs 
are filled with characters with no way out, and his new single, should 
it ever be released, is called 'Born To Lose'. But depicting sleazy 
losers isn't just a way of celebrating decadence for Springsteen. His 
losers are like the young prizefighters in the old movies, who had their
 choices laid out clearly for them. Springsteen has made his bargain, 
too, and it stands as either his motto or epitaph depending on the way 
things turn out. The advice rumbles from his masterpiece, 'New York City
 Serenade'. "Walk tall or don't walk at all." Bruce Springsteen holds 
his head high.</div>

Bruce Pollock, New York Times, December 16 1973<br>
<br>
Springsteen Celebrates Street Life<br>
<br>
WHEN BRUCE Springsteen's first Columbia album, Greetings From Asbury 
Park, came out almost a year ago, it was met with the most extravagant 
and outrageous praise I've ever encountered in the Rock Press. Reviewers
 compared him to Bob Dylan, The Band, Van Morrison, Allen Ginsberg, Jack
 Kerouac, El Topo, Webster's New World Dictionary. If superlatives were a
 dime a dozen, Springsteen could have retired then and there.<br>
<br>
Because of the amazing way he broke from the gate, even his most avid 
fans wondered how he could possibly sustain the pace. He'd never be able
 to follow his own act! Meanwhile, the cynical suspected a paper legend 
that would come apart at the first drop of split milk. Springsteen would
 have to do it again before they would believe.<br>
<br>
Now, after five solid months of dedicated labor, that second piece of 
work is here – The Wild, The Innocent &amp; The E Street Shuffle 
(Columbia KC 32432) – and in an era of diminishing returns, false 
prophets and false bottoms, where the best of our instant pop-up 
superstars are either choked-off, laid-back, lame or laid out flat, it 
is with a great sense of relief that I announce to the disbelievers that
 Bruce Springsteen has delivered another stone, howling, joyous monster 
of a record. Of course the fanatics knew the issue was never really in 
doubt.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is a word virtuoso, who uses language the way his band-mate 
Clarence Clemons plays the sax: tough, fast and funky, sometimes 
frivolous, often devastating. His lyrics are intuitive, emotional, a 
mass of flung images that spin toward you from all directions and 
somehow hang on a canvas – great swatches of local color that blend into
 a landscape of remembered adolescent scenes and dreams in the swamps 
and seasides of Jersey, in the slums of New York.<br>
<br>
In a time when everyone else is leaving the city for greener pastures, 
Springsteen celebrates street life, rendering it completely imagined, 
with places and names – Crazy Janey, Wild Billy, Rosalita. His vision is
 absolutely authentic; there's no doubting that he lives in that world 
of hoods and hitters, sinners, studs and saints. He is Jersey's Hubert 
Selby only younger and less defeated by life.<br>
<br>
But the true gift of the album is the music. The Springsteen Six – 
Clarence Clemons on sax, Danny Federici on organ and accordion, Gary 
Tallent on bass and tuba, Vinnie Lopez on drums and David Sancious on 
piano and Bruce on guitar – can play anything from a circus march to a 
classical dirge, often within the borders of the same piece. The album 
is a mad excursion from rhythm and blues edged in jazz to rock and roll 
touched with folk and funk; it swings like crazy, it drives home the 
torrent of his words to perfection. Each piece (you can't really call 
them "songs") is a world in itself, any one alone worth the price of the
 album.<br>
<br>
<br>
IN THE WILD, The Innocent &amp; The E Street Shuffle we start out by 
doing 'The E Street Shuffle', which takes place on the updated West Side
 of the Jets and the Sharks, in a speedy r&amp;b tempo. From there it's 
over to Asbury Park to visit Sandy and to experience the carnival 
summertime, penny arcade life on and below the boardwalk. 'Kitty's 
Back', is a street scene reminiscent of Kerouac's be-bop prosody, the 
endless sad jazz night of America, done in miniature by Springsteen's 
crew of romantic loners and losers. 'Wild Billy's Circus Story' is an 
incredible work which ends the side – a contemporary vision of a 
traveling tent show... "God save the human cannon-ball..."<br>
<br>
'Incident on 57th Street' and 'New York City Serenade' again take place 
in the bowels of Manhattan, and both sizzle like Eighth Avenue in 
August. Here are images of hustlers in leather jackets, huddled against 
the wind, cigarettes flickering in the violent night, and their dungaree
 molls, Crazy Janey, Diamond Jackie. 'Rosalita', which occurs between 
those two creations, is a wild, brawling bash, a precise and exuberant 
picture of teenage romance in the seventies. Springsteen's cast of 
characters, including himself, are easy to know and to like. They are 
determined to win you over and they will, and so will the album.<br>
<br>
The selections are neither too long nor too loud, have none of the 
excesses Springsteen has been known to sometimes display live. In fact, 
the album leaves you wishing it would go on forever. Every time 
Springsteen comes to town, all his friends flock to see him. This album 
should increase their number immeasurably.<br>
<br>
Can you imagine what his third album will be like?</div>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J. (Columbia)<br>
<br>
Dave Marsh, Creem, May 1973<br>
<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN has enough gall to actually commit suicide on stage of
 his own volition. Unlike Alice Cooper and David Bowie, who only yak 
about such stunts, Bruce would obviously come through all the way if 
given the opportunity. Unfortunately, his record company is trying to 
steal the scene by the usual act of ritual infanticide: i.e., claiming 
that Bruce is the Baby Bobby Dylan.<br>
<br>
Well, bull-shit, because Bruce Springsteen is really a throw-back all 
the way to the '50s. Springsteen is like Bo Diddley, like Elvis, like 
Jerry Lee. His entire career is based upon a total disregard for taste 
and control on the most fundamental level. "Ain't I a swell guy because I
 don't smoke dope, I drink beer" is out the window, – Bruce is so cool 
he probably does still smoke dope, he probably even shoots a little 
speed now and then to keep it going. Also, since Asbury Park, New Jersey
 is obviously one of the half dozen scuzziest places in the Western 
Hemisphere, Springsteen is the obvious heir-apparent to the throne of 
Scuzz King of Rock 'n' Roll, as soon as we stop being bamboozled by the 
klutz konsciousness inherent in our devotion to such pseudo-seamy 
vice-lords of pop as A.C., D.B., Lou Reed, and other nubile wankers-off 
in the face of Total Trash Thrills.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is possibly the only man in America who could out talk a 
rock critic, even if he spotted the rock critic a hit of speed, and he 
could do it because he doesn't give a shit how big a fool he makes of 
himself, he don't spend his time making up all kinds of fancy-ass 
phrases, he couldn't pronounce Roget if you stuck a .38 in his mouth and
 threatened to pull the trigger.<br>
<br>
Which also don't mean he's any kind of John Prine "I grew up in white 
slums and baby it's cold outside" corpse. If Elvis is the Pope of Pop 
with the ultimate secular call-and-response gospel show at his 
fingertips, Bruce Springsteen is like a Gnostic who spent three and a 
half years just slightly A.D. sitting on a rock in the middle of the 
desert, without eating so much as a breadcrust and came down 
jibjabbering, having not only seen the Lord but become him, if only for a
 Warholian quarter-hour. He spews it on out.<br>
<br>
St. Paul pulled the plug on them cats, but Bruce Springsteen don't need 
to have Columbia do that to him. There's one crucial difference between 
him and Dylan, see. Bruce Springsteen's no has-been.<br>

<br>
Jerry Gilbert, Sounds, March 16 1974<br>
<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN was confined to the boardwalk life on New Jersey. He 
lived over a drug store "in all the craziness of downtown", prayed for 
summer, sought sanctuary on the beach at Asbury.<br>
<br>
Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J. his picture postcard intro to city life
 is like a holiday ad for Blackpool. On the way it put Springsteen on 
the road to stardom – along with his mates from N.J. He came on like Bob
 Dylan, all the hip imagery and he a frail city urchin with a scrubby 
beard and tousled hair and clothes that he might have been living in for
 the past six months. Springsteen doesn't talk, he mumbles, he don't 
walk, he shuffles.<br>
<br>
He spent a few years quenching his insatiable thirst for the city by 
commuting between Asbury Park and downtown New York – mostly at the Café
 Wha in the Village; spent his CBS advance by putting a band together.<br>
<br>
New Jersey, cowering under the burgeoning weight of New York, could 
never be credited with any character and Springsteen was hardly likely 
to become a significant so long as he stuck to the Jersey bars. The 
Greetings album put 'em both on the map.<br>
<br>
"Jersey's a dumpy joint," Springsteen opined. "I mean it's OK, it's 
home, but every place is a dump. I guess it just took a long time for 
someone to think of something to write about it but Asbury Park had a 
lot to do with the tone of the first album."<br>
<br>
He was hailed as a rising genius – inevitably the new Dylan, but as the 
pressure has been removed so he has tended to get better.<br>
<br>
But right now it's 4.30 in the morning and Springsteen has just 
completed his second show at Georgetown University. Washington, scenario
 for The Exorcist. He's been ill – coughing up blood, causing the 
cancellation of the two preceding gigs. He's still coughing profusely 
and draws on a bottle of prescribed cough medicine which the doctor 
provided along with the statutory shot. What was the matter, Bruce? A 
futile question when you're on the road ninety per cent of the time. 
"The doctor knows I only go and see him when there's something wrong," 
he says, and calculates that he's played over two hundred gigs this past
 year. He puts on his old black jacket, check shirt tails showing out 
underneath. At 4.30 in the morning he shuffles over to the piano in the 
dressing room to play a new song on request, and at five he decides we 
should go and eat. The cops direct us to a subway café which says "Open 
for breakfast" but the doors are closed and we drive back along "M" 
street to Georgetown and the last remaining hamburger joint. Springsteen
 bemoans the lack of good food with a tacit gesture on behalf of his 
sick body and prays for summer and watersports.<br>
<br>
Six o'clock. Springsteen decides the hamburger will be sufficient to 
induce a good day's sleep before catching the train down to New Orleans.
 At his hotel Mike O'Mahony of CBS informs Bruce that I've traveled 
18,000 miles to see the band twice – in Los Angeles last year and in 
Washington tonight. "Sure 'preciate it," he says proffering his hand, 
and disappears to bed.<br>
<br>
Twelve hours earlier we had arrived at the Jesuit college, found the 
hall and walked right in on the soundcheck... "Spirits in the night, all
 night, in the night, all night..." CUT. Back to that bluesy, Discordant
 into, start again, great song that.<br>
<br>
Like most of Bruce's songs, it's improved with age. I mean there's cuts 
on the new album which you'd only just about recognize if you heard 'em 
onstage now – 'New York City Serenade', for instance, whilst 'Kitty's 
Back', an outstanding cut, is stretched across a marathon piano intro 
from David Sancious which is horribly over-embellished but a guaranteed 
winner with audiences.<br>
<br>
"I've never heard him play a song the same way twice," exclaims a 
Springsteen fan who has been following him on the road. And as we survey
 the assembly of instruments and the incongruous bunch of bar musicians 
who are about to play them you wonder how the hell Springsteen can 
induce a discipline that would invite comparisons with Van Morrison.<br>
<br>
Anyhow he's onstage and he's given a pop star's welcome – the crowd are 
screaming for him but they cut off instantly in order to decipher the 
mumble of his opening rap which is a pretty funny monologue punctuated 
by the occasional laugh and the odd decipherable word. He picks up 
acoustic guitar. Danny Federici has accordion and Garry Tallent hauls 
the tuba up into playing position by which time the audience have 
already predicted 'Wild Billy's Circus Story'.<br>
<br>
Gradually he works his way through the new songs – 'Incident On 57th 
Street' which he refers to as 'Spanish Johnny', 'New York City 
Serenade', Then 'Spirit In The Night' which he now intros himself on 
harmonica in unison with Clarence Clemons' sax.<br>
<br>
As the show builds Springsteen eventually picks up his Strat and the 
band rock straight into the 'E Street Shuffle', the highlight of his new
 album, slow the pace for his beautiful love song '4th Of July. Asbury 
Park (Sandy)' which I've never heard referred to as anything other than 
'Sandy'. It's Springsteen at his most evocative, more relaxed and for 
once Springsteen resists the temptations of incorporating as much as 
three different musical themes intertwined in one composition. It's a 
carnival type song with Federici on accordion and Bruce going crazy on 
boardwalk assimilations.<br>
<br>
But he's still in the mood for rocking and attacks 'Blinded By The 
Light', the song that started it all happening for him, with such gusto,
 that he was into the third verse before I'd recognised the song.<br>
<br>
He called for a handkerchief from the audience and went into a new 
comedy routine, the bar entertainer's legacy, and in this instance his 
cold was definitely giving way to what has become a regular feature of 
his act.<br>
<br>
Then he came on with that masterful guitar intro to 'Kitty's Back' which
 smacks of authority like it was the theme tune to some movie epic. 
Anyway this is where the band really starts cooking, organ and sax in a 
swirling mass of sound, Springsteen's guitar rising in sympathetic 
harmony and new drummer Ernest Boon Carter attacking a great solo only 
four gigs after the departure of Bruce's long time sideman Vini Lopez.<br>
<br>
The crowd went wild and demanded an encore. Bruce obliged with 
'Rosalita', one of his own favourites from the new album, and the only 
song remaining for him to play. Sancious and Federici swopped keyboard 
instruments as the ninety minute show reached its conclusion.<br>
<br>
It was after the second show, well over two hours long and featuring old
 standards like 'Let The Four Winds Blow' and 'Walking The Dog', that I 
settled down to talk to Bruce in the desolate dressing room. The band 
had split as had Bruce's manager/producer Mike Appel, and Bruce himself 
was bemoaning the fact that in spite of his marathon stage stint it had 
been impossible to play everything that people wanted to hear. "We're 
doing largely recorded material at the moment because the drummer's only
 been with us for four dates." As to the departure of Vini Lopez, Bruce 
was deliberately vague. "He'd been with me four years," he said "There 
were various pressures – it was a difficult decision to make."<br>
<br>
He broke into another fit of coughing and cursed his ill luck at having 
to cancel those two gigs. "We never do that unless we really have to," 
he qualified – and besides they were New Jersey gigs where he's most 
popular. "I mean you play all the time half sick but it got to the point
 where I couldn't play piano, I was spitting blood. I don't get sick a 
whole lot but this year we have been. I mean we've done so many gigs 
this past year that it just starts to collect...the fatigue...that's why
 it's good to be working on new songs and whenever I have the discipline
 to make myself write, I write. I used to write everyday, on the buses, 
on the streets...but I tend to be more critical now, that's why I 
haven't written much recently."<br>
<br>
He's pleased with the outcome of his new album The Wild, The Innocent 
And The 'E' Street Shuffle but like CBS he's wondering why the album 
sales haven't lived up to the critics' expectations since he's received 
rave notices everywhere. "The new album was a little more what I wanted 
to do – there was more of the band in there and the songs were written 
more in the way that I wanted to write. But I tend to change the 
arrangements all the time in order to present the material best, 
although it's often to suit the style of the band. I just try to update 
things a little bit to keep everybody interested, for instance 'Sandy'. I
 like the way it is on the record but it was entirely different up until
 the night I recorded it and then I changed it."<br>
<br>
Bruce claims that generally his favourite songs were those that were 
written over a short period of time. "'For You' was written really fast 
and 'The Angel' was written in ten of fifteen minutes and that's one of 
my favourites because it's one of the most sophisticated things I've 
written. 'Hey Bus Driver (Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street)' was done 
real quick and 'Blinded By The Light' I wrote partly in the morning and 
partly in the afternoon, in fact the only thing that took time on the 
first album was 'Spirit In The Night'."<br>
<br>
He recognizes that his writing environment is different now – he misses 
that boardwalk existence and maybe the road is no place for a man of 
Springsteen's caliber to be writing. But just how much of the confusion 
he writes about is a true reflection of Asbury life? "I see these 
situations happening when I sing them," he admits, "and I know the 
characters well. I use them in different songs and see them in shadows –
 they're probably based on people I know or else they're just there. 
There's a lot of activity in my songs, a whole mess of people. It's like
 if you're walking down the street, that's what you see, but a lot of 
the songs were written without any music at all – it's just that I do 
like to sing the words!"<br>
<br>
He proceeded to play a piece he is in the throes of completing and then 
outlined his future plans. "I want to get girls into the band for the 
next album because I've got some good ideas which add up to more than 
just background vocals. But right now I don't have the money to do it."<br>
<br>
Springsteen's songs are an often alarming reflection of city streetlife.
 "They're written to be bigger than life," he says, but at the same time
 he admits that he really doesn't have any more insight than anyone 
else.<br>
<br>
"I really didn't spend a lot of time in the city – Jersey was so 
intense, you couldn't even walk down the street so I went to New York 
and used to hand out mostly in the village but also uptown a little bit.
 I was mostly by myself with no particular place to go but sometimes I'd
 hang out with this other guy."<br>
<br>
Yet essentially he was a band musician and only a few months earlier he 
had been hanging out in bars playing blues and rock and roll. "Then I 
wrote my first batch of songs and if nothing had come of it I'd probably
 have been back in the bars by now."<br>
<br>
He quickly overcame his early ego problems realising the 
self-destructive influence he was having on himself. "The mistake is 
when you start thinking that you are your songs," he says. "To me a song
 is a vision, a flash, and what I see is characters and situations. I 
mean I've stood around carnivals at midnight when they're clearing up 
('Wild Billy's Circus Story') and I was scared, I met some dangerous 
people. As for Spanish Johnny's situation well I'd never get into that 
situation but I know people who have lived that life."<br>
<br>
Right now Bruce is working with a pretty regular band "a real spacey 
bunch of guys" with a desire to come to Europe, but not much hope. "It 
just goes on forever here, on and on."<br>
<br>
Quite how long he can continue at this rate – up on stage every night 
playing to ever-increasing crowds obsessed by the idea "that the singer 
is the song" – is anyone's guess.<br>
<br>
But if I traveled 18,000 miles to see the Springsteen band twice, then 
he probably gets through that inside a month – mostly by train!<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: Little Egypt From Asbury Park<br>
<br>
Dave Marsh, Creem, October 1975<br>
<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN SITS cross-legged on his half-made bed, and surveys 
the scene. Records are strewn across the room, singles mostly, 
intermixed with empty Pepsi bottles, a motley of underwear, socks and 
jeans, half-read and half-written letters, an assortment of tapes, and a
 copy of Richard Williams' Out of His Head, the biography of Phil 
Spector.<br>
<br>
The space is small, but Bruce and the two friends listening to Harold 
Dorman's 'Mountain of Love' don't mind. They're listening for the final 
few bars of 'Mountain', in which the drummer collapses and loses the 
beat – the song slows down to a noticeably improper tempo, and the 
effect is nothing less than absurd. Unfortunately, Springsteen, 
unlubricated by anything more than the spirit of the thing, is having 
trouble getting the turntable to spin consistently. (One of those weird 
things with the green push button that lights up when you press it.) 
When he finally does, it turns out the record was warped. It is 
unplayable. Hysterically, Springsteen sweeps it under the mass of 
accumulated debris.<br>
<br>
"Here," he says, "I'll play ya something else." He puts on a tape of he 
and the E Street Band at the Main Point in Philadelphia. Suddenly, out 
of the speakers booms his own voice, cracking up at what he's singing. 
("That song has some of the best lines," he says shaking his head, "and 
some of the dumbest.") "Standin' on a mountain lookin' down at the city/
 The way I feel t'nite is a dawgawn pity." When the band comes in, the 
room is charged. The playing and the singing is rough, even ragged, but 
it is alive, sparked with the discovery of something vital in an old, 
trashy song. It has been a long time since I heard anyone get this 
interested in rock and roll, even classic old rock and roll. It has been
 a lot longer since anyone has gotten me so interested.<br>
<br>
Song done, Springsteen snaps the tape recorder off. "There," he says, 
with the characteristic delinquent twinkle in his eye. "If that don't 
get a club goin', nothin' will."<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is determined to get 'em going. The magic is that he 
doesn't have to be so determined to get himself going. Without being 
constantly "on" like a performer, Springsteen is constantly on, like 
someone who knows how good he is. He is full of himself, confident 
without being arrogant, almost serene in his awareness of what he is 
doing with his songs, his singing, his band. His music – and nothing 
gets in the way of that. Unlike, say, Roxy Music, which makes very 
exciting music out of a nearly desperate sense of boredom, Springsteen 
makes mesmerizing rock out of an inner conviction that almost everything
 is interesting, even fascinating.<br>
<br>
Take the three songs which, at this point, form the focus of the 
long-awaited third Springsteen album. 'Born to Run' is almost a rock 
opera. But, rather than building his concept piece around a derivative 
European anti-funk motif, Springsteen has built his masterwork around a 
guitar line ripped straight from the heart of 'Telstar'. It may be too 
long (4:30) and too dense (layer upon layer of glockenspiel, voice, 
band, strings) to be a hit, but it does capture the imagination with its
 evocation of Springsteen's usual characters – kids on the streets and 
'tween the sheets – and its immortal catch-line: "Tramps like us, baby 
we was born to run."<br>
<br>
Not that he couldn't write something more classically oriented, if he 
needed to. 'Jungleland', the ten minute opus which may very well serve 
as the title of the third record, opens with 90 seconds of strings and 
percussion. But its influences are classical in the way in which '60s 
soul producers like Spector, Holland-Dozier-Holland and Gamble-Huff 
absorbed them, rather than in the way that pedants like those unctuous 
Britons Yes and ELP have done. Its imagery is magnificent, exceeded only
 by its music. Springsteen's music is often strange because it has an 
almost traditional sense of beauty, an inkling of the awe you can feel 
when, say, first falling in love or finally discovering that the magic 
in the music is also in you. Which may also be first falling in love.<br>
<br>
'She's the One', on the other hand, is pure sex, with a Bo Diddley beat 
that's nothing short of scary. Shorter, and less complicated than the 
other two, it could be the one. (The Hollies' 'Sandy' might've beat him 
to it. As Springsteen fans know only too well, the Hollies' version has 
almost nothing in common with Bruce's. But then, what did the Byrds' 
'Mr. Tambourine Man' share with Dylan's?)<br>
<br>
All of this makes Bruce Springsteen just about what he thinks he is, or 
at least, hopes to become: the Complete Rock and Roller. Few in rock and
 roll have attempted so much. None of the '50s rock and rollers were so 
ambitious – Elvis could have achieved everything, even intellectual and 
production brilliance, without drawing a heavy breath, if he had that 
ambition – and Bob Dylan never had the patience to, for instance, make 
interestingly constructed records. The Beatles had the production 
genius, with Martin and Spector and one suspects, without them, but they
 never really had to tackle it on stage. In any case, like the Stones, 
their magic was more collective than individual as subsequent events 
have shown. The Stones themselves couldn't be everything, because the 
scope of the group deliberately cannot contain some of Springsteen's 
farthest fetched (and I believe, most successful) ideas. For instance, 
it's hard to imagine Jagger coming out to sing a ballad as his first 
song, let alone a ballad sung only against violin accompaniment. Todd 
Rundgren had the idea, and the scope, but – one suspects – not quite the
 guts or talent or sheer keening madness to to go out and DO it, as a 
rock and roller. So he retired to the academy of his own electronic 
idiosyncrasy.<br>
<br>
And Rundgren's myth was always internal. Because he spent so much time 
in the cloister of the studio, word had to spread the hard way, by those
 who shelled out for his records. Certainly nothing to compare with 
Springsteen's full-blown stage show, which lately encompasses such 
tricks as the new introduction to the slowed down 'E Street Shuffle': 
Springsteen recounts walking down an Asbury avenue, late one dark night,
 and seeing a giant black man at the corner. "I took the money out of my
 pockets and threw it on the ground. I took my jacket and threw it on 
the ground," he says, standing in the glare of a single spotlight. "Then
 he put out his hand" – the enormous black palm of gargantuan, spooky 
saxophonist Clarence Clemons suddenly juts into the glare and 
Springsteen whispers: "SPARKS fly on E Street." It is a truly 
unforgettable moment, taking on a racial fear at the same time that it 
devastates it into an almost trivial joke. (And works better because 
Springsteen's music so fully encompasses soul influences.)<br>
<br>
So it goes with a number of one-liners, moments ("Brace yourselves," he 
shouted at the beginning of the final chorus of 'Quarter to Three', his 
third encore one night. You had to be there to discover how necessary it
 was to do that), even songs. I've only seen him do 'Then I Kissed Her',
 a remake of the gorgeous old Crystals' song, once, for instance, and 
I've been thirsting for it ever since. In this sense, it may be to his 
advantage that he has no record. Not only does word-of-mouth have a 
chance to spread more completely, but every instant is more special 
because it is irretrievable.<br>
<br>
That sense that he is special has begun to pervade even Springsteen's 
semi-private life. When he showed up at a party for label mates Blue 
Oyster Cult, Springsteen completely dominated the room. So much so that 
Rod Stewart and a couple of the Faces, no slouches at scene-stealing 
themselves, were all but ignored when they made a brief appearance. Yet 
he has yet to lose his innocence. Going to visit the Faces later that 
night, at the ostentatiously elegant Plaza Hotel, Springsteen feigned 
awe – although you wondered if it were entirely feigned – at the 
mirrored, plushly carpeted lobby.<br>
<br>
Fragments of a legend have begun to build. There are the stories about 
school – in high school, the time when he was sent to first grade by a 
nun, and, continuing to act the wise-ass, was put in the embarrassing 
position of having the first grade nun suggest to a smaller child: 
"Johnny, show Bruce how we treat people who act like that down here." 
Johnny slapped Springsteen's face. Or in college, the story of how the 
student body petitioned the administration for his expulsion, "because I
 was just too weird for 'em, I guess." The news that his father was a 
bus driver, which gives added poignancy to 'Does This Bus Stop at 82nd 
Street'. (Which begins, "Hey, bus driver, keep the change.") Aphorisms 
are not beyond him: On Led Zeppelin: "They're like a lot of those 
groups. Not only aren't they doing anything new, they don't do the old 
stuff so good, either." On marriage: "I lived with someone once for two 
years. But I decided that to be married, you had to write married music.
 And I'm not ready for that." On the radio: "I don't see how anyone 
listens to [the local progressive rock station]. Everything's so damn 
long. At least if you listen to [the local oldies station] you know 
you're gonna hit three out of five. And the stuff you don't like doesn't
 last long."<br>
<br>
All of this goes only so far, of course. A record, a hit record, is a 
crucial necessity. Sales of the first two albums are over 100,000 but 
that's nothing in America. There are still large areas of the country 
where Springsteen hasn't played – even important large cities such as 
Detroit have been left out – and though the word travels fast, and 
frequently, articles like this ultimately seem like just the usual 
rhetoric without something to back them up. As one Californian put it, 
"I've heard enough. It's like having everyone tell me I'm really missing
 something by not seeing Egypt. When's he going to come out here?"<br>
<br>
Presuming he has the hit he deserves, Springsteen should be hitting most
 of America over the rest of the year. After an abortive arena journey 
with Chicago, he is, he says, reluctant to play large halls ever again. 
But he is one of the few rockers who would have any idea of what to do –
 except blast – in a room the size of a hockey rink. (Mick Jagger is 
about the only example who comes to mind, though Rod Stewart and Elvis 
do pretty well now that I think of it.)<br>
<br>
Suppose that he does hit the big time. Even, suppose that he really is, 
as the ads have it, "rock and roll future." What happens then?<br>
<br>
Since I believe that all of the above is true, and is going to happen, I
 have been at some pains to try to figure it out. Certainly, not a new 
explosion, a la Beatles and Elvis. Those phenomena were predicated upon 
an element of surprise, of catching an audience unaware, that is simply 
no longer operative. Not with rock on nationwide TV too many times a 
week. And not the kind of quiet, in-crowd build-up that propelled Dylan 
into the national eye. What Springsteen is after – nothing less than 
everything – has to be bigger than that, in mass terms, though it 
obviously cannot exceed Dylan in influence, his biggest achievement.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's impact may very well be most fully felt as a springboard, a
 device to get people to do more than just pay attention. He can, 
potentially, polarize people in the way that Elvis, the Beatles, the 
Stones, Dylan – all the really great ones – initially did. (Already, 
some early Springsteen fans feel alienated by his ever more forceful 
occupation with his soul influences.) The key to the success of those 
four is that as many hated them as loved them – but everyone had to take
 a position. God knows who he'll drag into the spotlight with him – it 
might have been the N.Y. Dolls, whose passion for soul oldies was equal 
to his, or Loudon Wainwright, whose cool, humorous vision parallels 
Bruce's in a more adult (sort of) way – but that ought to be something 
like what will happen. Sort of the way Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis and
 the other rockabilly crazies followed Elvis.<br>
<br>
He's smart though. He said it all, one night, introducing 'Wear My Ring 
Around Your Neck', the Presley oldie. "There have been contenders. There
 have been pretenders. But there is still only one King."<br>
<br>
But no king reigns forever.</div>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: Darkness On The Edge Of Town<br>
<br>
John Tobler, ZigZag, July 1978<br>
<br>
THE RETURN of the street people, which should be a good thing. First, 
Springsteen, whose scenario of misfortune has been so well publicised 
that there's no need for pointless repetition here.<br>
<br>
I don't see any point in using any artist's business mistakes as some 
kind of excuse for what may be lacking in his comeback album, so I 
refuse to allow any sentiment (of which I had little anyway) to colour 
my judgment away from feeling that this album is pretty ordinary. It's a
 little difficult to pinpoint exactly what it is that makes this so much
 of a depressing earful – perhaps the fact that since 'Born To Run' came
 out three years ago, a large resurgence has occurred of loud, dumb, 
fast and totally unintellectual rock'n'roll, which has stopped a lot of 
people taking themselves too seriously, and has conclusively proved that
 popular music goes totally in cycles – at this point, we're back in the
 late '50s, with an added ingredient of protest, which was to occur a 
few years later, although its original sentiments were expressed far 
more eloquently than the punks have managed.<br>
<br>
Undigressing, the new Springsteen album would have been far more 
acceptable in 1976 than it is in '78. 1976 was a year when I was 
prepared to get into the untwisting of lyrics, prepared to tolerate and 
enjoy the odd dirge, but in June 1978, I'm not about to waste my time 
with sophisticated, even if well meant, claptrap. It pisses me off when a
 song like 'Racing In The Street' has a lyric that could conceivably 
have emerged from the pens of Chuck Berry or Brian Wilson, but is sung 
so slowly (but definitely not bluesily) that it makes your lids droop.<br>
<br>
It has been said in another review that the album was re-recorded to the
 power of infinity because there was so much hanging on it, which seems a
 likely reason for the utter sterility of so much of it, and certainly 
the early take syndrome (as opposed to the clinical computerized 
perfection of recording over and over until it's absolutely right and 
immensely boring) has come back into its own with a vengeance recently, 
and produced a lot of much needed life. But more intriguing for me is 
the fact that each of the weekly music papers has assigned the record 
for review to one of their up and coming young lads, rather than letting
 anyone who was an original Springsteen rock writer assess it and 
compare it with the older stuff.<br>
<br>
Do Mick Watts, CSM and the rest not feel terribly interested in 
Springsteen anymore? It would hardly be a big surprise to discover that 
when such as these early disciples heard the album, they too found it 
boring, or at least were unable to summon up quite the enthusiasm they 
felt should be accorded to their early '70s hero.<br>
<br>
And finally, never forget that it was Springsteen himself who chose his 
business associates, and if they ripped him off, it was nobody's fault 
but his own. Feel sorry for him if you like (and I certainly feel sorry 
for him), but don't make his poor judgment an excuse for the fact that 
this record sounds like it belongs in another time and another place. 
Let's hope the next one's lacking the self pity and offers us a little 
hope – that's what you're entitled to expect from a Messiah. And I still
 prefer Greg Kihn's version of 'For You'....</div>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: The Ghost Of Tom Joad<br>
<br>
Phil Sutcliffe, MOJO, December 1995<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN'S GOT HIS BOTTLE back. After the diverse dissatisfactions of
 Human Touch, Lucky Town, the point-defeating In Concert: MTV Plugged, 
and the unnecessary Greatest Hits, here he is matching the bravest 
career move he ever made. Like 1982's Nebraska, The Ghost Of Tom Joad is
 a commercial non-starter, largely acoustic and a hell of a risk – 
except that it had to be. And it's stunning.<br>
<br>
But entertainment value? Sorry, wrong queue. The Ghost Of Tom Joad's 
musical content is minimal and uniform. It is quiet. Turn it up to 11, 
it's still quiet. Small-room production sets Springsteen down beside 
you, muttering in your ear. Other sounds shade the background almost 
subliminally; the Streets Of Philadelphia keyboard lowers along, 
sometimes violin or pedal steel sigh and moan. The aural effect of this 
album could be restful or downright monotonous, according to taste. So 
it all depends on the lyrics. Good thing, then, that they're 
magnificent.<br>
<br>
The first and title track is crucial, from its opening yowl of frankly 
Dylanesque harmonica. Steinbeck's Tom Joad is a towering figure in 
American literature – the essential working-class militant liberal, who 
battles not so much for equality as a fair shake – and Springsteen, like
 Woody Guthrie before him, has written a song to match his stature. It 
evokes underbelly USA: dossers, hobos, soup kitchens, the straggling 
thousands on the move with "no home, no job, no peace, no rest". Amid 
these grim snapshots, Springsteen sets out the political morality which 
serves as a framework for the whole album. "Welcome to the new world 
order," he sings, courtesy of President Bush. Biblically, the campfire 
huddle sits "waitin' for when the last shall be first and the first 
shall be last". And every chorus summons up Tom Joad's ghost, guardian 
of the people's soul, to come back and join in the fight.<br>
<br>
With an addendum from 'Youngstown', an account of an Ohio steel town's 
rise and slump into dereliction, that's Springsteen's state-of-the-union
 report. Then come stories of the citizenry – in particular, illegal 
immigrants, the wetbacks who nightly throng the frontier with Mexico. In
 'Across The Border' a boy dreams of the good life with his sweetheart 
on the other side: "For what are we/Without hope in our hearts/That 
someday we'll drink from God's blessed waters." But he's the only 
innocent around. A border guard describes his work, confused and 
conscience-wracked ('The Line'). A kid called Spider becomes a rent boy 
in San Diego. He dies on his blanket under the freeway ('Balboa Park'). 
The Rosales brothers, Miguel and Luis, switch from fruit-picking to 
"cooking methamphetamine". It's volatile stuff and an explosion kills 
Luis. Miguel digs up the $10,000 they'd saved, then buries his brother 
in the hole ('Sinaloa Cowboys').<br>
<br>
This is all fierce, gripping reportage. Other, more metaphorical lines 
are crossed too, though. Springsteen, always one for tales of 
temptation, weaves in a quartet of songs about workaday men on the brink
 of fateful, dislocating change. In 'Highway 29', a shoe salesman loses 
it when a woman he's fitting with a size 7 gives him the eye and her 
number: "My hand slipped up her skirt, everything slipped in my mind." 
In no time, he turns bankrobber. He blames her; then admits to the 
something inside him "that'd been coming for a long, long time". 
Contrarily, the narrator of 'Straight Time' is a criminal who has been 
'clean' for years. Jailed by freedom's limitless opportunities to work 
hard and stay poor, he's about to crack.<br>
<br>
The world turns upside down more gradually for 'The New Timer'. He 
leaves his wife and kids to find work, but lets his commitment slide as 
he becomes accustomed to the hobo's life. It's only fisherman Billy 
Sutter in 'Galveston Bay' who actually manages to resist temptation, 
putting his knife back in his pocket when he could have murdered a man 
(for racist reasons, as it happens).<br>
<br>
Just the one moment of redemption, then. Not a lot of laughs. A plain 
sound. Toes will not tap. Yet sheer lyrical weight and substance could 
make The Ghost Of Tom Joad very influential in the long run. It's a 
matter of diligent, detailed imagination expressed economically. 
Characters and situations ring real. Thus, emotional involvement 
actually grows each time the story's told. You start to know the arid 
life of the lonely man in the stray lost-love song 'Dry Lightning': "I 
threw my robe on in the morning/Watched the ring on the stove turn red."
 You shuffle your feet in sympathy with the tension between 'Straight 
Time's antsy ex-con Charlie and his wife: "Kitchen floor in the evening 
tossin' my little babies high/Mary's smiling but she's watching me out 
of the corner of her eye."<br>
<br>
The Ghost Of Tom Joad isn't pretty but it breathes, sweats and bleeds. 
On the October tour with Joe Grushecky, Springsteen's long-time minder 
Big Terry told allcomers: "The new album? It'll tear your heart out." He
 wasn't wrong.</div>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: Hustling For Rock’s Record Machines<br>
<br>
Don Snowden, Pasadena Guardian, 24 September 1975<br>
<br>
HE STARTED HIS career as a solo performer and fronting New Jersey bar bands like the Steel Mill and Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom.<br>
<br>
Signed to Columbia by John Hammond in 1972, his first album Greetings 
From Asbury Park, N. J. sent critics scurrying for superlatives; he was 
hailed as another new Dylan for his physical appearance, off-the-wall 
lyrics and imposing array of colorfully-named street characters. The 
chorus of acclaim grew to a roar with the release of The Wild, The 
Innocent And the E Street Shuffle, a 1974 Rolling Stone Record of the 
year; comments placing the future of rock’n’roll on his shoulders began 
to appear and Jon Landau quit his job at Rolling Stone to help produce 
Born to Run.<br>
<br>
He took the E street Band to the alien turf of Texas to play his brand 
of R&amp;B-flavored punk rock drawn from the streets of Jersey and the 
sidewalks of New York to an audience unfamiliar with his work – and 
received a standing ovation after the song. At Carnegie Hall he closed a
 song with the line "Uptown in Harlem she throws a rose to some lucky 
young matador" – and as the last notes faded away, a young girl in the 
audience silently stood up and threw a single red rose past his ear.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is a 25-year old romantic whose feet are firmly 
cemented in urban concrete, whose heart and mind are directly attuned to
 the hopes and fears of the young American male. An adventurous spirit 
musically, his albums range from the acoustic-dominated Asbury to the 
Latin-tinged electric eclecticism of E Street and the arranged precision
 of the new album. Born to Run is a virtual primer on the music of the 
mid-‘60s filtered through the experiences of the ‘70s. Springsteen has 
been ably abetted throughout by the potent E Street Band, a unit who may
 well be everything you always wanted in a rock band but were afraid to 
ask for.<br>
<br>
The power and versatility of the band perfectly complements 
Springsteen’s throaty singing. He is a vocal actor, utilizing techniques
 ranging from a hoarse stage whisper to soulful falsetto whoops to 
maximize the dramatic impact of his songs. The key to his vocal 
effectiveness is his sense of timing, an instinctive grasp of what to do
 when and for how long.<br>
<br>
When his vocal delivery and lyrics mesh, Springsteen is capable of 
creating a compelling persona through vivid imagery drawn from a myriad 
of sources. Springsteen’s lyrics are drawn from the classic themes or 
rock’n’roll – young love, cars, the celebration of youth and the strains
 of growing up, the dream of hitting it big – but with a rare 
combination of intelligence and emotional intensity. His songs, highly 
romanticized depictions of nighttime street life – often cinematic in 
their scope and attention to detail – are populated by people like the 
Magic Rat, Crazy Janey, Spanish Johnny, and Sloppy Sue and Big Balls 
Billy.<br>
<br>
The emotions are extreme, undercut by the desperation and impatience of 
youth and sobering sense of mortality and dashed hopes. He wants to know
 if life is real, to place his faith in the magical spirits of the night
 and find one of his dreams, to die on the streets in an everlasting 
kiss, to run from the stifling atmosphere of his town. The women in 
Springsteen’s life can have hearts of gold (‘The E Street Shuffle’ and 
‘Incident on 57th Street’) or stone (‘She’s The One’); many of his 
greatest songs are those where he must persuade a reluctant woman to 
come with him by painting a vision of excitement and romance in the 
night (‘Rosalita’, ‘Thunder Road’ and ‘Born to Run’).<br>
<br>
Throughout his writing, characters must share the spotlight with 
hemi-powered drones – Springsteen’s obsession with cars rivals those of 
Chuck Berry and the hot-rodding Beach Boys. Automotive imagery abounds; 
cars are vehicles of release from the confining drudgery of the 
nine-to-five world, from the suicide-trap towns full of losers.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is just a prisoner of his dreams, honest and aware 
enough to accurately depict the dilemmas facing someone growing up in 
these times, sensitive enough to capture their emotional quandaries in 
attempting to deal with them. He is the embodiment of the rock 
traditions of the late ‘50s and early mid-‘60s – his genius lies in his 
ability to synthesize those familiar elements into a compelling. It 
works because Springsteen has lived and sings of experiences and 
fantasies common to all: joining the circus, hanging out in amusement 
parks and pinball arcades, cruising in the summer looking for love, 
skipping school and acting cool, staying out all night. The effect is 
galvanizing on vinyl; live, with the E Street Band playing like a jungle
 fire behind him, Springsteen’s impact is riveting. If rock’n’roll has 
ever struck a responsive chord in your soul, this man will affect you.<br>
<br>
He’ll be at the Roxy Oct. 16-19 – don’t expect the tickets to last long once they go on sale.</div>

				<div class="content">It's a Vet's Life: Bruce Springsteen and Born in the USA<br>
<br>
Phil Sutcliffe, MOJO, January 1999<br>
<br>
It was Springsteen's most epic moment – and his most misunderstood. Phil Sutcliffe uncovers the double life of Born In The USA.<br>
<br>
Until Bruce Springsteen took to the road as an acoustic folkie singing 
about poverty, drugs and human dereliction with the songs from The Ghost
 Of Tom Joad in 1995, many critics clove to the notion that he was just 
the grease-monkey bard of cars-and-girls culture. But this was only 
because they didn’t listen and missed nearly everything. They missed 
how, by 1980, in the emotional life beyond his music, his natural 
tendency to what he calls "isolation" within himself had taken him to 
the edge of a void which he was desperate to fill.<br>
<br>
His early ventures in self-education were, in part, an attempt to find a
 solution. The school dunce and drop-out, past 30 already, toiled at 
literature (crucially, Steinbeck) and forbidding volumes of American 
history. Then, by chance, he picked up Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic’s 
autobiography, Born On The 4th Of July. No sooner had he read it than he
 bumped into Kovic in Los Angeles and their conversation led to a 
heartfelt (and fund-raising) relationship with the Vietnam Veterans Of 
America organisation. Inspired by the potential for such "community 
involvement", Springsteen then tied most of his ’80s gigs in to 
publicity and personal donations to local causes ranging from American 
food banks to the campaigning wives of striking miners in Newcastle upon
 Tyne. His new perceptions and commitments translated into his 
songwriting too.<br>
<br>
On January 3, 1982, at his rented home in Holmdel, NJ. he recorded more 
than a dozen songs on a four-track cassette player. When most of them 
proved intractable to band treatment, he released the demos as a 
startlingly bleak solo acoustic album, Nebraska. But among the "rejects"
 – now available on Tracks – was the first draft of 'Born In The USA' 
(same words, different melody). Out of sorts as they were with their 
would-be Nebraska sessions, The E Street Band took hold of Born In The 
USA the moment Springsteen played it to them. The recording which was to
 change all of their lives erupted from only their second run-through. 
Weinberg’s nuclear snare drum, Bittan’s trumpet voluntary of a 
synthesizer lick, the whole band’s great rolling fanfare for the common 
soldier all came tumbling out in one mighty oceanic wave which rolled on
 into the unplanned 90 seconds of instrumental outro thundering to fade.
 Sincerely if not impartially, Jon Landau, Springsteen’s manager and 
co-producer, called it "The most exciting thing that ever happened in a 
recording studio".<br>
<br>
Come June, 1984, when the band album was finally ready, Springsteen says
 he knew that 'Born In The USA' would be huge, that it meant stadiums, 
the status of a temporary demigod. And he went for it. As he noted after
 the album had run its course, "We had that cut and that was kinda 
sayin’, All right, come on! In the end what we did was what we set out 
to do."<br>
<br>
With the title song its imperial signature, Born In The USA bestrode the
 music world for a year on its way to eventually selling 20 million. 
Although the muscled-up, headband-toting grunt image Springsteen adopted
 for the global tour drew obvious comparisons with Sylvester Stallone’s 
cliché Viet vet maverick Rambo, anyone who heard 75,000 at Wembley 
Stadium or 40,000 at St James’s Park singing along with all the verses 
could only conclude that the mass of fans got it. They heard that 'Born 
In The USA' roared with pain and a degree of defiance, but not triumph. 
They understood the story of a dead-end boy from "a dead man’s town" 
opting for Vietnam rather than jail at home, losing his buddy at Khe 
Sahn, coming home to unemployment and an empty life of "ten years 
burning down the road/Nowhere to run ain’t got nowhere to go".<br>
<br>
The story, Springsteen recalled to Mark Hagen, is that "There’s someone 
returning home and trying to find where they belong, if they belong. The
 music was martial and powerful, expressing a survivor instinct: I have 
been through this, I am out the other side, and I am alive."<br>
<br>
However, having entered the arena of political comment, Springsteen 
quickly found that the exposure he craved had a downside. Released in a 
presidential election year, the song soon became a prime target for 
partisan opportunism. Conservative columnist George Will took 'Born In 
The USA' for a gung-ho patriotic anthem, writing that "Springsteen is no
 whiner and the recitation of closed factories and other problems always
 seemed punctuated by a grand, cheerful affirmation: Born in the USA!"<br>
<br>
Then, in Hammonton, NJ, on September 19, 1984, President Reagan reached 
out for the youth vote, gravelling, "America’s future rests in the 
message of hope so many young people admire: New Jersey’s own Bruce 
Springsteen".<br>
<br>
A few nights later on stage in Pittsburgh Springsteen issued a barbed 
rebuttal, wondering aloud about Reagan’s favourite album: "I don’t think
 it was Nebraska... "<br>
<br>
Predictably, this rebuff immediately led to Democratic Party candidate 
Walter Mondale claiming Springsteen’s support. He was forced to 
apologise that his office had "misinformed" him.<br>
<br>
These altercations resolved any doubts music fans might have had about 
the import of 'Born In The USA'. But the experience of misinterpretation
 – and its durability: Bob Dole again used the song without permission 
during his 1996 presidential campaign – never persuaded Springsteen that
 he should have backed away from the song’s lightning-rod energy. "Any 
work out there is open to different types of interpretation," he says 
now. "That is part of the roll of the dice. I probably could have made a
 record that would have been more easily understood, but... that was the
 right record."<br>
<br>
However, the Born In The USA adventure introduced a whole range of 
uncertainties into his life as an artist and otherwise. "Bruced out", as
 he put it, he created a great, quiet album, Tunnel Of Love, from the 
emotional turmoil of his short-lived marriage to Julianne Phillips. 
Then, disgusted with "the macho thing" and the "iconic role" he had 
created for himself, he broke away from The E Street Band, divorced, and
 spent the following year in misery: "I spun off for a while, I just got
 lost... I was in a lot of fear", he said, confessing that he "made life
 generally unpleasant" for his new partner, Patti Scialfa.<br>
<br>
At that point, he took to therapy and, he believes, gained some insight 
into the "pure self-loathing" which had produced his painful emotional 
isolation. But his work did no better than stumble along: Human Touch, 
Lucky Town, the bizarre "Plugged" MTV album, the unnecessary Greatest 
Hits were all unsatisfactory.<br>
<br>
But eventually he pulled through. Clearly, his relationship with Scialfa
 deepened – "She has a very sure eye for all of my bullshit" – and he 
encountered his own "terrifying" capacity to love their three children. 
Musically, he downsized to 'The Streets Of Philadelphia', The Ghost Of 
Tom Joad, to playing theatres solo with an acoustic guitar. He still 
sang 'Born In The USA'. But he cut the chorus which, in 1984, made the 
world punch the air.<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: It's Hard to be a Saint in the City<br>
<br>
Jerry Gilbert, ZigZag, August 1974<br>
<br>
ALL DRESSED UP AND NO PLACE TO GO<br>
<br>
"When his two-hour set ended I could only think, can anyone really be 
this good: can anyone say this much to me, can rock 'n' roll still speak
 with this kind of power and glory?"<br>
<br>
These questions, which he then went on to answer, were posed by Jon 
Landau in a May issue of Rolling Stone. His five hundred word eulogy 
provided a head and shoulders vignette of a New Jersey street poet 
called Bruce Springsteen. "I racked my brains but simply can't think of a
 white artist who does so many thinks so superbly," went on Landau, 
stretching out in uncustomary fashion. "There is no-one I would rather 
watch onstage today... " Jeeez.<br>
<br>
Announcing the second coming of the man who first appeared from the pens
 of the scribes as the brother Messiah of Bob Dylan. One way and another
 American critics have laid a heavy onus on Springsteen but I guess it's
 easier to live up to a placing in just about every US writer's 1974 
Playlist than to efface the charlatan connotations which accolades 
pertaining to Dylan invariably conjour up in the eyes of the beholder.<br>
<br>
It just so happens that I agree with all Mr. Landau's comments and I'm 
glad that he, too, can detect the power of Springsteen's band ringing in
 his tired old bones just as I'm glad that Mr. Springsteen can quote 
dismissively that "Dylan influenced me as much as anyone I guess... when
 I was fourteen maybe... but I don't think about the comparison too 
much."<br>
<br>
A couple of years after it started, CBS's attitude in building 
Springsteen into the star the critics say he already is remains 
bewildering. He's never been to England and currently waits for his new 
single to be completed with the desperation of a man who's flat broke, 
pinning his final hopes on the record, wondering whether his band will 
survive and seeking fit to qualify only that he doesn't feel he's 
written AM station lyrics. When did he ever?<br>
<br>
I've travelled 18,000 miles to see Springsteen twice, courtesy of CBS 
London and shared my enthusiasm with other foreign journalists as the 
Springsteen band have disseminated waves of ectasy across theatre 
auditoriums and yet he maintains that Columbia have been constantly cool
 in dealing with their wonder talent.<br>
<br>
Peter Jay Philbin , a friend of Springsteen's long before joining CBS 
International press department in New York, claims that it isn't until 
sales really start to look good that CBS throw the full weight of the 
heavy artillery into the game and right now Springsteen may be the 
critics' fave but he ain't selling albums. All dressed up and no place 
to go.<br>
<br>
"We're at the lowest we've ever been right now," he told me last month. 
"It means that if we don't play every week of the year then we don't 
have money. Right now we've just come off the road and the guys are 
getting thrown out of their houses. Hopefully I'll be getting some money
 from Columbia and maybe with David Bowie doing some of the songs 
that'll be good. But that's the only problem right now... it's sort of a
 shame... I'd just like to be a little more secure that's all," he said 
in a vain attempt to make light of the problem.<br>
<br>
Physically, Bruce Springsteen has all the hallmarks of a guy who's spent
 his life being dragged through the gutter. He's of frail build, sports a
 scrubby beard and matted, tousled hair, has a uneven gait (stumbles) 
uneven speech (mumbles). Shirt tails hang beneath an old leather jacket 
that's followed him around 1,000 gigs and religiously been thrown from 
his shoulders at some point during the 120 minutes' worth of music that 
his band are guaranteed to pound out whether the contract says so or 
not.<br>
<br>
Such was the case at Georgetown University, Washington in March 1974 – a
 Jesuit college who's only claim to fame is the centrepiece of Blatty's 
Exorcist. My second visit to the Springsteen show.<br>
<br>
The first show opens, and to my delight it belongs to John Hall's band 
Orleans. Springsteen does his coupla hours. They take a break. Orleans 
open the second show and the audience bitch for an encore. Springsteen 
wanders onstage... the city orphan who had just cancelled two gigs 
because he'd been throwing up blood. Homes in on his regular 
showstoppers, and with all that out of the way, starts pulling up these 
old r&amp;b classics like 'Walking The Dog' and 'Let The be Four Winds 
Blow' with total disdain of the fact that we're living in the seventies.
 The show takes on a strange atmosphere that only nocturnal energy can 
generate and when this spirit in the night staggers off stage, beads of 
sweat dripping from the huge black frame of number one sideman Clarence 
Clemmons, it's way past three. In the dressing room a grand piano awaits
 his call and he starts to re-work a theme that he's been trying to 
mould into a song.<br>
<br>
<br>
*<br>
<br>
"MANY FALSE IMPRESSIONS WERE DRAWN"<br>
He has this knack of being able to make himself totally unobtrusive, 
quietly waiting for the band to wander out into the approaching dawn 
before settling down to an interview with more commitment than you'd 
dare expect at 4.30 am.<br>
<br>
Springsteen emerged out of rhythm and blues and rock and roll and the 
whole legacy of Chuck Berry and people like Gary U.S. Bonds. "All those 
old r&amp;b type people – Bonds had a great feeling on all his records, a
 feeling that everyone was singing, you know, thirty guys all playing 
and singing in the studio at the same time on things like 'Quarter To 
Three' and 'School Is Out'.<br>
<br>
It explains his obsession for a loose back-up band with a honking sax, 
and the same confusion, the same party chaos that he carries through so 
well in 'E Street Shuffle' and more especially, 'Rosalita'. As a bar 
musician he had little use for lyrics that delved beyond the accepted 
demarcation lines of rhythm 'n' blues sentiment. "I used to write 
straight rock stuff because the situation was such that whether we were 
playing in a bar or in a club the general conditions and PA were so bad 
you had to communicate on the most basic level you could and I was just 
never in a position to do more.<br>
<br>
"But after that, the ten-piece band went down to seven-piece and then 
five-piece and then just me, so that's when I really started to write 
some different types of lyric. The thing is I'd been fronting a band for
 nine years but when I walked to the record companies there was just me 
by myself with a guitar, and from that many false impressions were 
drawn."<br>
<br>
It's an important point and this fact, plus Columbia's dilatory 
behaviour in getting Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J. onto their 
schedules that resulted in Springsteen's debut being about half as 
auspicious as it might have been. "The album was so old by the time it 
got released, and I write songs fast, so that I was doing all kinds of 
different material by the time it got released.<br>
<br>
"I mean, I like to be doing new material but that record reflects the 
mood I was in at that particular time... you know, the fact of having to
 come into the city from where I was living, and I didn't have a band so
 it all contributed to that kind of down feel. But towards the end of 
the record I started pulling out of it with songs like 'Spirit In The 
Night' which started to get into a whole different feel."<br>
<br>
Asbury Park was recorded at 914 Sound Studios, Blauvelt, New York, 
co-produced by Mike Appel (Springsteen's manager) and Jim Cretecos 
featuring the collective talents of Vini Lopez, Clarence Clemmons, Gary 
Tallent, David Sancious, Harold Wheeler and Richard Davis of which the 
first four became regular members of the band and all but Lopez remain. 
That's the bare facts. The album, fronted by a picture postcard of 
Asbury Park, painted a sombre picture of city life and its victims – 
characters portrayed in the shadow of death. The production and some of 
the playing often leave room for improvement but it is impossible to 
deny the power and feeling which Springsteen's words and song structures
 exude just as it's impossible to deny the presence and strength of his 
imagery even when it threatens to dictate or obscure a song rather than 
carry it along.<br>
<br>
Of such paranoia Springsteen chooses to remain on the periphery and 
merely record it journalistically. "I can rise to an occasion... like 
with that album. The rest of the time I'm kind of laid back because 
there's too much going on to get excited about, too many people running 
around crazy. I just prefer to let it go."<br>
<br>
In New Jersey he prefers the incongruous... like water sports. He left 
the board walk life portrayed so vividly by Jack Nicholson in The King 
Of Marvin Gardens and misses the rundown environment of his adolescent 
period, living over a drugstore or whatever it was. The road is no place
 to write your new album, back in Asbury Park things were different.<br>
<br>
"I see these situations happening when I sing them and I know the 
characters well. I use them in different songs and see them in shadows –
 they're probably based on people I know or else they're flashes, that 
just appear there. There's a lot of activity, a whole mess of people... 
it's like if you're walking down the street, my songs are what you see, 
only distorted. A lot of songs were written without any music at all, 
it's just that I do like to sing the words."<br>
<br>
Springsteen's picture-book of city street life is a nightmare vision. 
"My songs are supposed to be bigger than life," he claims, but he 
insists he has not been blessed with any greater powers of insight than 
the next person.<br>
<br>
"Jersey was so intense you couldn't even walk down the street so I used 
to go to New York and hang out in the Village mostly, but also uptown a 
little bit.<br>
<br>
<br>
*<br>
<br>
GREENWICH VILLAGE FOLK URCHIN<br>
"I was mostly by myself with no particular place to go, but sometimes I'd hang out with this other guy."<br>
<br>
So paradoxically when Springsteen made it with Columbia it was as a 
Greenwich Village folk urchin. Totally out of context. "I'd written my 
first batch of songs and if nothing had come of it I'd probably have 
been back in the bars by now," he quipped at the time.<br>
<br>
CBS went with 'Blinded By The Light' for the single, Springsteen 
twisting as much distorted lyric into the metre as possible and hanging a
 catchy chorus at the end of each verse. A good ensemble legacy from his
 rock 'n' roll days.<br>
<br>
Yeah he was blinded by the light. Cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night.<br>
Blinded by the light,<br>
He got down but the never got tight<br>
But he's gonna make it tonight... .<br>
<br>
The best songs on that album, says Bruce were those written over a short
 period of time. Like the incredible suicide ballad 'For You' which 
remains one of Springsteen's greatest achievements as he recounts the 
final minutes of life drawing back to the final chorus with its emotive 
cry.<br>
<br>
I came for you, for you, I came for you,<br>
But you did not need my urgency.<br>
I came for you, for you, I came for you,<br>
But your life was one long emergency.<br>
And your cloud line urges me<br>
And my electric surges free.<br>
<br>
'The Angel', says Springsteen, is one of his great favourites – 
conceived, constructed and completed inside fifteen minutes. "It's the 
most sophisticated thing I've done," he said referring to the 
sex-power-death trip of the Angel astride his chopper. He starts the 
song thus :<br>
<br>
The angel rides with hunchbacked children,<br>
Poison oozing from his engine,<br>
Wieldin' love as a lethal weapon,<br>
On his way to hubcap heaven...<br>
<br>
and concludes:<br>
<br>
Off in the distance the marble dome<br>
Reflects across the flatlands with a naked feel<br>
off into parts unknown ,<br>
The Woman strokes his polished chrome<br>
And lies beside the angel's bones... .<br>
<br>
He hipped up the same theme in his trilogy of death in 'Lost In The 
Flood' where he portrays death as a sort of macabre disappearing point.<br>
<br>
He rides her low on the hip, on the side he's got 'Bound For Glory' in red white and blue flash paint,<br>
He leans on the hood telling racing stories,<br>
The kids call him Jimmy the Saint.<br>
Well that blaze and noise boy,<br>
He's gunning that bitch to blasting point<br>
He rides head first into a hurricane and disappears into a point<br>
And there's nothin' left where the body fell.<br>
And there's nothin' left that you could sell,<br>
Just junk all across the horizon,<br>
A real highwayman's farewell... .<br>
<br>
More recently David Bowie pulled 'Growin' Up' and 'It's Hard To Be A 
Saint In The City' from the same album to record; one a pop song, the 
other perhaps a little too ambitious and expansive, but both 
pre-ordained for Bowie; in any event by the time Springsteen was set to 
record his second album, The Wild, The Innocent And The 'E' Street 
Shuffle, he'd ironed out all his problems. Same studio, same producers 
but this time a band who had been knocked into shape on the road, 
largely through the experience of veteran horn player Clarence Clemmons,
 who once worked with James Brown.<br>
<br>
"The mistake," Springsteen reflected, "is in thinking that you are those
 songs," in an obvious allusion to the self-destructive influence the 
presence of his ego in those songs was having. "To me a song is a 
vision, a flash, and what I see is characters in situations.<br>
<br>
"I mean I've stood around carnivals at nights when they're clearing up 
and I was scared ['Wild Billy's Circus Story', still one of the 
highlights of the show with Garry Tallent playing tuba and Danny 
Federici accordion. Just that.] As for Spanish Johnny's situation 
['Incident On 57th Street'], well I'd never get into that kind of 
situation but I know people who have lived that life."<br>
<br>
You have to remember that it ain't easy to commute between Asbury Park 
and the Cafe Wha? down in the Village and hang onto your sanity. And it 
takes a lot of guts to blow your record advance on putting together a 
band – a band that Bruce calls "a really spacey bunch of guys...but a 
pretty regular band". There's been only one personnel change in two 
years, Ernest Boon Carter having replaced Vini Lopez on drums.<br>
<br>
"Vini'd been around for years," Bruce qualified vaguely. "There'd been 
various pressures... it was a difficult decision to make."<br>
<br>
In truth, Asbury Park had a lot to do with the feel of the first album. 
"Jersey's a dumpy joint," Springsteen had said. I mean it's OK, it's 
home, but every place is a dump."<br>
<br>
<br>
*<br>
<br>
"EVERY SYLLABLE ADDS SOMETHING TO HIS ULTIMATE GOAL"<br>
"Springsteen does it all. He's a rock 'n' roll punk, a Latin street 
poet, a ballet dancer, an actor, a poet joker, a bar band leader, 
hot-shit rhythm guitar player, extraordinary singer and a truly great 
rock 'n' roll composer. He leads a band like he's been doing it 
forever... Bruce Springsteen is a wonder to look at: skinny, dressed 
like a reject from Sha Na Na, he parades in front of his all star rhythm
 band like a cross between Chuck Berry, early Bob Dylan and Marlon 
Brando. Every gesture, every sylable adds something to his ultimate goal
 – to liberate our spirit while he liberates his by baring his soul 
through his music." Another sizeable chunk from Jon Laundau's Rolling 
Stone review that pretty much sums up the impact of a Springsteen show. 
But having looked at the lyrics, some qualifications of the musicians in
 the band.<br>
<br>
Bruce looks like he's appeared out of thin air but he's a regular old 
timer and he was just a straight forward rhythm guitarist in a band 
before coming out as a front man. He led a ten-piece in the bars and 
rough houses of New Jersey, and it was an experience that ultimately 
brought him down. But in the last and best bar band he had built up 
quite a following in the Southern States. "Over about four years I 
played mostly down South – for some reason I got popular around 
Virginia, Tennessee and Carolina and I played in a lotta different towns
 with the ten-piece band."<br>
<br>
His band today may lack the sophistication of Van Morrison or Tim 
Buckley but the versatility is indisputable. A long time admirer of 
Bruce's, watching the Georgetown gig and taking note of the amorphous 
nature of his songs, was moved to comment that he'd never heard 
Springsteen play or sing a song the same way twice. 'New York City 
Serenade' has changed beyond belief whilst 'Kitty's Back' (one of the 
best kinetic compositions) was stretched across a super-long embellished
 piano solo from David Sancious. "There was more of the band in the 
second album and the songs were written more in the way I wanted to 
write but I change the arrangements all the time in order to present the
 material best and to suit the style of the band. I just try to update 
the arrangements a bit to keep everyone interested. 'Sandy', for 
instance, I like the way it is on the record but it was entirely 
different right up until the night I recorded it and then I changed it."<br>
<br>
For this next album Bruce plans to incorporate chick singers and horns. 
He would do the same onstage but for the economics of it all.<br>
<br>
The road has really taken its toll on Springsteen's health. When I'd 
seen him in Washington he'd been bemoaning the lack of good food and 
swigging cough mixture from a bottle. Some months later, talking to him 
on the phone to New Jersey he could find little cause for optimism. The 
Wild, The Innocent And the E Street Shuffle, far more of an energy, band
 participation album, he said, had generally been better received and 
sold in larger quantities than the first album although Peter Philbin 
reckons the composition already shows signs of him being sucked away 
from his native enviroment. Technically it's a far better album, the 
tracks are longer and go through more mood changes and yet it doesn't 
reveal the same highs that the first had, though on reflection I think 
it would have been impossible to paint as vivid a picture that 
Springsteen had managed first time around. In the light of this, the 
lyrics on the second album lack the same monolithic grace as the first; 
no further qualification necessary – just cop a listen to the finished 
product.<br>
<br>
"I'm still fooling with the words for the new single but I think it'll 
be good," said Springsteen, taking up the story once again. "I've 
written a lot of stuff for the new album but when I get into the studio 
I'll have a clear picture – but it's a different assortment of material 
and most of it relates pretty much not to touring or playing in a band 
because we haven't played much at all this summer – but lately I've been
 getting a rush to write new songs and I've got quite a few, some short 
and some long."<br>
<br>
Mike Appel will again be producing. "I haven't met anyone else who 
understands the situation any better and he's very involved; besides I 
don't like too many outside people involved, it just gets too 
impersonal, that's why I never pick session musicians."<br>
<br>
He believes his band are improving and tightening all the time but as to
 whether his next album will outsell the previous two he's reluctant to 
say. "I do sell records... but real slow and not many... about 500 or 
1,000 each week. I don't think too many people listen to reviews and 
articles with regard to spending the bucks."<br>
<br>
He is particularly anxious to tour his current band in Britain before 
the line-up changes – and changes are very much on the cards. "It's a 
very open situation right now. I'm definitely going to add people, 
possibly a horn section and people who can double on instruments like a 
violin and trumpet maybe."<br>
<br>
<br>
*<br>
<br>
"RENTS ARE DUE AND ALIMONY AND WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY"<br>
At last Bruce Springsteen realises he is on the verge of a breakthrough 
and by constant touring he has managed to "erase false images that 
people have".<br>
<br>
But on a serious note he underlines his financial problem. "I'd like to 
get out of this situation where I haven't paid the band for three weeks.
 Rents are due and alimony and we just don't have the money. At this 
stage of the game it's really a shame and I'd just like to get some 
income because in the last two years we've just managed to make ends 
meet and sometimes we don't; so we're at the lowest we've ever been 
right now and if we don't play every week we don't have money... it's as
 easy as that."<br>
<br>
But he clearly visualises the theme of his third album in the light of 
the first and second. "Those were two very different albums," he 
appraised. "The second is more popular and it's sold more – I guess it's
 more musical, but the first one has a certain something for me. I 
tended to do two totally different things – the first album was a very 
radical album whereas the second wasn't quite so much. I'm surprised it 
didn't do better than it did because it sounded very commercial to me. 
This new album will possibly be something of a balance between the two –
 I'll try and hit somewhere between."<br>
<br>
There we have it then. Bruce Springsteen, the city punk with a disparate
 bunch of bar boys he calls his band. Just a bunch of lost souls 
striving to recover and release theirs through the music, or as a Jimmy 
Spheeris once likened his own urban paranoia to a "surfer boy stranded 
with city sand in my shoes".<br>
<br>
But for all it shambolic appearance, weird stage drawl that makes him 
relatively unintelligible, Bruce Springsteen has used the legacy of the 
fifties more comprehensively than anyone, from his rough, tough R&amp;B 
approach to the vivid documentation of his experiences. Maybe he is Bob 
Dylan, Jack Kerouac and James Dean all rolled into one, but if that's 
true then there's also a lotta James Brown and Gary Bonds tucked in 
there too.<br>

<br>
Glenn O'Brien, Spin, 1985<br>
<br>
Hey, it was the greatest show I’ve ever seen. It was like rock ‘n’ roll 
and a gospel meeting and a party and the World Series rolled into one.<br>
<br>
Some of my best friends are people I used to dislike. And it is 
frequently those qualities that made them repellent in the first place 
that later make them seem so attractive. Today, when someone says of a 
friend: "How can you stand it?" I just smile and say "Give 'em a little 
time."<br>
<br>
I think I've learned my lesson. Now I like people like that right off. 
It's not so much a matter of suspending judgment as collating it. And 
I've learned not to go by anybody else's opinion of anything. In fact, 
if they hate it, I'm intrigued. I didn't see the movie Bonnie and Clyde 
for three years because everybody liked it. Later I would see it ten 
times.<br>
<br>
It was like that with Bruce Springsteen. We're still not best friends, 
but now I'm a real fan, a fan who used to sort of roll his eyes and say,
 "Oh yeah, he's the guy with all the bells in his songs, right?" Just 
the fact that Rolling Stone writer Jon Landau said something like "I 
have seen the future of rock 'n' roll and it is Bruce Springsteen" was 
enough to keep me away for a couple of years. Later that would be 
replaced by, Like, any guy that Dave Marsh wrote a book about...<br>
<br>
Also, it seemed like such a pose, with the jeans and the T-shirt and 
everything. But sometimes I forget that if you hold a pose long enough 
it may take root. And then I might have thought, "Man, if he's hooked on
 that chick, he's not playing with a full deck... "<br>
<br>
A remark I might have successfully directed at myself any number of times.<br>
<br>
I don't know just what it was really. I guess I thought Bruce was opera.
 I thought he was overblown. I thought it was trumped-up romanticism. I 
thought it was lie. But if you tell a lie long enough... But now I don't
 think Bruce lies. Bruce wouldn't lie, man! Bruce has imagination. I 
think he always had it, but it wasn’t always so powerful. I think it got
 honed by the big beat.<br>
<br>
I’m not sure how I figured it out. I think if you’ve got an ear and 
radio you're going to figure it out sooner or later. I know I had 'Born 
to Run' going through my head at one point, but I was determined to 
resist. I think when I finally was ready to give up was around the time 
of The River. Maybe I heard 'Cadillac Ranch' on the radio and there was 
just no way not like it.<br>
<br>
But I'm one of those masses that went Bruce-crazy with Born in the USA. I
 got the promo in the mail and I played it and it was great, every song 
was great, and I kept playing it. A few days later I showed up at my 
favorite record store and I picked up all his albums and I went to the 
checkout counter and the cashier just couldn't believe it. "Oh no! You 
too?!" I guess I wasn't the only old new-wave person into this Bruce 
thing. This clerk seemed to think that all of her friends were dropping 
like files to it. "Oh no! You too?! She looked at me like "hadn't the 
Ramones and the Dolls and Iggy and Lou taught me anything?"<br>
<br>
Now you can go around pointing out facts like that Lou himself said "Hey
 man, Springsteen is OK" on his live Take No Prisoners album several 
years ago (the same album on which he refers to Robert Christgau as 
"some asshole in the Village Voice"). You might mention that Springsteen
 is friends with David Johansen; that they both used to play upstairs at
 Max's around the same period. But you know it won't do any good. You 
know that some of your East Village friends will not be converted, not 
because of anything having to do with Bruce per se, but because they 
cannot bear the idea of liking anything so popular. You get the feeling 
that if Joey Ramone himself made the cover of Time and Newsweek 
simultaneously, they would be forced to drop him too and complain that 
he had sold out.<br>
<br>
It's hard to accuse Bruce of selling out when he keeps his ticket prices
 low (like what? One third of the Jackson tour price?) and turned down 
the $12 million Chrysler offered him to do a three-second ad spot, but 
then they can always come back and say: "Hey, $12 million is nothing to 
him. He takes in over a million a show."<br>
<br>
No, all you can say to these people is, "Hey, that’s exactly how I felt.
 But have you seen the show? It’s the greatest rock 'n' roll show I've 
ever seen."<br>
<br>
This always gets 'em, because they know I've seen the Beatles, Stones, 
Hendrix, P-Funk, Iggy, Cream, Who, L.Z., Talking Heads, Ted Nugent, what
 have you. So then they give you that look like you've got this 
ultra-premature form of Alzheimer's that starts out in the so-called 
"pleasure pathways" of the brain. They look at you like you're a rock 
'n' roll form of Moonie. But, hey, it was the greatest show I've ever 
seen. It was like rock 'n' roll and a gospel meeting and a party and the
 World Series rolled into one. We did the wave. We danced. We sang. All 
the way back in the last stadium row you could see people singing and 
dancing, and they knew all the words. Bruce and the band played for 
fours hours, and at the end you were still ready to go.<br>
<br>
What I really liked, and what some people really hate, was the sober 
ecstasy of the Bruce show. You hear that his band doesn't drink or drug 
on the road. They say that you couldn't do that stuff and keep up the 
pace. But that's almost beside the point. The point seems to be that in 
this case imagination is enough. It's enough to make you sing and dance 
all night. And the singing is better and the dancing is better, 
everybody drives home fine, and the next morning they wake up singing. 
That's imagination.<br>
<br>
Then there's this thing where people have mixed up Bruce with Rambo. 
Rambo is the guy who posed with Reagan the same week his girlfriend's 
nude pictures were running in Playboy and his nude pictures were running
 in Playgirl. Bruce hasn't posed with any candidates, or, as far as we 
know, nude.<br>
<br>
Bruce's America is not a cartoon. If you think it is, then pick up a 
cassette of the Nebraska album and pop it in the car deck and drive some
 interstate and get back to us.<br>
<br>
I don't think Bruce is a goody-goody, I don't think he's holding back or
 reacting or faking it. The guy's got heart and soul. I bet he doesn't 
jack off. I bet he never told a girl he loved her just to get into her 
pants. Of course, I didn't either. I always meant it.<br>
<br>
I saw a picture in the paper of Bruce playing in a charity softball 
game. He has a beautiful swing. You can tell a lot about people by what 
kind of shoes they wear, but maybe even more (with men anyway) by how 
they swing a bat. Bruce is a natural. He keeps his eye on the ball. He 
swings level. He follows through. Like in life.<br>
<br>
I dont' think of Bruce as some flag-waver riding the crest of yuppie 
reaction. I think of him as the guy who is proving once and for all that
 you don't have to be an asshole to be an artist.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is a poet. He writes great words. But he's also a rocker. I 
listen to some of the older albums and I like them OK. But you live and 
learn. And if you live and learn right, you get better. I think with 
Nebraska Bruce really learned how to write and with Born in the U.S.A. 
he really learned how to rock. So I don't care that I just hopped on the
 bandwagon with the millions. It's just great right now. And I'm happy 
to be a very avant-grade mainstream far-out regular guy.<br>
<br>
Epilogue: I just read that there's bar in L.A. where all they play is 
Bruce and Bruce-related music. I don't know if that means Little Steven 
and maybe Southside Johnny are played too, or if it's like more sweeping
 and includes such Bruce-esque combos as John Cafferty and Beaver Brown 
(which has a Clarence Clemons lookalike) or such regular guys as John 
Cougar, who now seems to be threatening to be original. Anyway, I figure
 if I start out for that bar right now, maybe I'll know a lot more by 
the next issue.<br>
<br>
P.S.: We all know that Bruce is changing the world. I think it's for the
 better. He's already saving me money on clothing bills. But seriously, 
here's something to be considered:<br>
<br>
Early in the 21st century a great many of the young men you meet will be
 named Bruce, maybe even most of them. This will be the greatest 
popularity of the name Bruce ever. My brother is named Bruce, so I can 
tell you, not long ago it was not a fun name to have. It was not exactly
 like being a boy named Sue, but the other little guys didn't treat a 
Bruce like a Jim either. Bruces got sand kicked in their faces. The only
 heroic Bruce back then was publicly wimpy and only anonymously bold – 
he had to put on a bat costume to rock out. But in a new generation, 
Bruce will rule. Arnold will have made quite a comeback too. But Bruce 
will rule.</div>

<br>
"BLOOD", "FIRE", "dust", "dark", "empty" – the same words keep 
recurring. Lights shutting out, black hole in the sun, buildings 
burning, that lonely desperation that can drive an atheist to prayer.<br>
<br>
This is not the first time Springsteen has written about darkness in the
 USA; though his songs have always reflected America's glorious myths, 
he's equally mindful of its grim realities. And reality doesn't come 
much grimmer than planes ramming skyscrapers, incinerated firefighters, 
people leaving answering-machine messages then leaping to their deaths.<br>
<br>
In the aftermath of September 11, numerous novelists and poets published
 their writings on the horror, but musicians, largely, stayed silent. 
Some spoke out, or played fundraisers, but few wrote songs about it. Or 
if they did, most didn't release them.<br>
<br>
Can't say I blame them – there's a fine line between empathy and 
exploitation, no end of pitfalls in the matter of language, tone and 
timing. But Springsteen – champion of the common man; nearest damn thing
 to an East Coast poet laureate – had to do something.<br>
<br>
As is his way, he says his piece through adopted characters and their 
stories: the bitter man in opener 'Lonesome Day' who thought he knew 
everything about his wife, but now "the joke's on me"; the desperate 
optimist in 'Mary's Place' who throws a party for his gal, playing all 
her favourite records, hoping she'll show up ("I drop the needle and 
pray"); the emergency worker the papers call a hero, broken, propping up
 a bar in 'Nothing Man'; the widower in dark, menacing rocker 'The 
Fuse', where anger fuses with sexual need and terror. Hmm, terror – a 
hazardous area for any American with sympathy for the underdog/ability 
to see all sides of an argument to venture post-9/11. But Springsteen 
goes there, singing about bridge-building in 'Let's Be Friends' and 
'Worlds Apart', an odd, Middle-Eastern song, like Peter Gabriel backed 
by The E Street Band.<br>
<br>
Yes, the band the Boss let go in 1990 are with him here; wife Patti 
Scialfa too. Maybe the musical equivalent of the post-disaster desire to
 be with friends and family; maybe the realisation that a stark, solo 
Nebraska-style treatment might have been too desolate. The E Streeters 
sound much as ever – lots of rousing build-ups, soaring sax, big 
backbeats, bombast. There are more retro-sounding pop-R&amp;B numbers 
with "sha la la" backing vocals than the subject matter might indicate, a
 stadium-rocker, some soulful ballads recalling early Van Morrison, and 
stirring gospel. Closer 'My City Of Ruins', urging us to "rise up", is 
particularly rousing. In the end The Rising's message – as the other 
frequently-recurring words "hope", "strength", "faith" and "love" 
indicate – is one of indomitability.<br>

The Louisville Review <br>
By Raj Ranade<br>
<br>
I never realized the key side-effect of “Bruuuce”-ing until I saw it in 
person at the KFC Yum Center in Louisville last night. “Bruuuce”-ing, 
for the uninitiated, is when Springsteen fans just yell “Bruuuce” 
instead of applauding, which, en masse, kind of sounds like booing. 
Audience dissent becomes way harder, since the boos are masked by the 
enraptured “Bruuuces,” as one drunken concert-goer in my row found out. 
Apparently irritated when Springsteen used the word “democratic” (though
 Springsteen wasn’t referring to the political party – the liberal 
rocker pointedly avoided any explicit political references in the show),
 the guy tried booing to no avail, lost amid the “Bruuuces.” (He tried 
“Vote Mitt Romney” after that, but that just doesn’t have the concise 
oomph or crowd-spread potential of a good “boo.”)<br>
<br>
This isn’t to say that Springsteen deserves booing – far from it. Even 
at the age of 62, Springsteen is as energetic, hard-working, and 
flat-out spectacular a performer as any I’ve ever seen. It’s just 
emblematic of the kind of sway he manages to create over his crowds.<br>
<br>
Sometimes he achieves this by being a gladhanding ham – early on in the 
set, Springsteen hopped off the stage to stroll along the perimeter of 
the stadium floor, stopping to invent an impromptu secret handshake with
 a young boy and to pose wearing the hat of a young girl. (He had a lot 
of these moments with youngsters in the crowd – if he avoided politics 
during the show, he still had a politician’s eye for photo ops.) 
Sometimes he does it through carefully staged self-deprecation – after 
declaring himself the head of “a glorified Jersey bar band,” Springsteen
 mimed decrepitude, crawling like a wizened old man to the lip of the 
stage until he was inches from a female fan’s face – at which point he 
immediately dropped the act and began flirting. And sometimes he does it
 through deeply earnest solemnity – he channeled a gospel preacher as he
 lamented Hurricane Sandy’s effect on his native New Jersey, building up
 to a moment of silence where he asked the crowd to pay tribute to the 
ghosts living around us.<br>
<br>
Springsteen switched between these different personas with 
whiplash-inducing speed on Saturday night, creating an almost 
Broadway-style framework for his songs about desperate, sometimes-doomed
 rock-and-roll dreamers. And he tore into the performances of the songs 
themselves with equal zest – with Springsteen, any guitar note that can 
be played with a full-on windmill arm swing will be, and elaborate 
synchronized dance moves with his bandmates are the rule rather than the
 exception.<br>
<br>
Accompanying him, the E Street Band was as sharp as ever, despite the 
passing of Clarence Clemons last year. Clemons has been replaced by a 
horn section of five people on this tour, with his nephew Jake Clemons 
capably handling most of his solos.<br>
<br>
Guitarist Nils Lofgren ripped through a guitar solo on “Because the 
Night” while pirouetting on one leg for a long chunk of it. And the band
 put together some striking new arrangements of old songs – the acoustic
 ballad “Atlantic City” (this critic’s favorite Springsteen song) was 
turned into a full band rave-up, a quiet lament turned into powerful 
raging against the <br>
<br>
It’s been almost exactly a decade since Springsteen has played a show in
 Kentucky (the last was at Rupp Arena on November 14th, 2002) and he 
seemed happy to be back – in part because the doting father revealed 
that his daughter, show-jumper Jessica Springsteen, is competing in the 
Alltech Games in Lexington this weekend (starseekers may want to keep an
 eye out for The Boss at the arena). And Springsteen found a nicely 
subtle way to cater to the hometown crowd when he mentioned that while 
he might be getting older, he could still “float like a butterfly and 
sting like a bee” – that was all that the locals from Muhammad Ali’s 
hometown needed to start cheering (or “bruuuce”-ing, of course).<br>
<br>
The rocker was giddy enough during the performance of “Tenth Avenue 
Freeze-Out” that he inexplicably started doing the “Gangnam Style” dance
 for a few brief moments. It was maybe one of the more ill-advised 
moments of the evening, but it nevertheless revealed the critical thing 
about Springsteen – he’s a guy who will go to some pretty impressive 
lengths to make sure the audience gets their money’s worth.<br>
