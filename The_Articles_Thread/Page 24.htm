<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band played their first show since 
the death Thursday of longtime keyboardist Danny Federici, Tuesday at 
the St. Pete Times Forum.</strong><br>
<br>
Tampa Tribune , <br>
April 23, 2008<br>

<br>
Somewhere, Danny is smiling. <br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band played their first show since 
the death Thursday of longtime keyboardist Danny Federici, Tuesday at 
the St. Pete Times Forum. If Springsteen generally plays as if his life 
depends on it, Tuesday night he played as if his soul and those of 
everyone in the arena were at stake.<br>
<br>
The show began with a video tribute to Federici, who played with 
Springsteen for 40 years, beginning in pre-E Street outfits such as 
Steel Mill. <br>
<br>
Then, as pianist Roy Bittan played the introduction to "Backstreets," a 
spotlight shone on an unmanned Hammond organ and accordion, Federici's 
instruments, a silent expression of the band's loss. <br>
<br>
The rest of those expressions were anything but quiet. <br>
<br>
Springsteen howled the chorus of "Backstreets" with as much passion as 
he did in 1975. Max Weinberg pounded his kit so hard it seemed close to 
tumbling - or disintegrating. The whole band played with an intensity 
that seemed impossible to sustain for the length of the show. <br>
<br>
But they did. <br>
<br>
Springsteen and band stormed through the early part of the set with no 
let-up. Weinberg kept the pulse going as guitars were swapped between 
songs. "No Surrender" was especially moving, with guitarist Steve Van 
Zandt joining Springsteen at the microphone. The two ended "Gypsy Biker"
 with a stinging guitar duel. <br>
<br>
Finally pausing, Springsteen offered thanks for "prayers and condolences
 for Danny," then told the band, "We better get this right. Somebody's 
watching." <br>
<br>
With Bittan on accordion, they launched into the sad, sweet "Sandy 
(Fourth of July Asbury Park)," evoking the early days of Springsteen's 
and Federici's musical life playing clubs along the New Jersey shore. <br>
<br>
Springsteen told the crowd of 16,332 that the song's fortuneteller, 
Madame Marie, might be a Florida resident now. Then, he announced, "one 
more fairy tale," and delivered "Growin' Up" with more youthful vigor 
than a man on the downside of 50 should have. <br>
<br>
There were so many highlights - "Atlantic City," "Because the Night," 
"She's the One" - but the show's emotional centerpiece came with the 
pairing of "Racing in the Street" and "The Rising." <br>
<br>
The former song is one of Springsteen's most desolate, the cold flipside
 to "Born to Run," about finding out you're not that young anymore and 
maybe there's nowhere to run. <br>
<br>
The song is so devastating as to make any attempt at levity seem a lie. 
"The Rising," then, was the perfect tonic, a song about demanding life -
 joy, even - in the face of tragedy. If every song seemed to have 
special resonance given the circumstances, this one may have had the 
most of all. <br>
<br>
The encore began with a stirring rendition of the gospel hymn "I'll Fly 
Away," followed by "Rosalita," "Born to Run" and "Tenth Avenue 
Freeze-Out," a trio guaranteed to send any Bruce fan into spasms of 
sheer joy.</div>

<br>
San Jose Mercury News , <br>
April 22, 2009<br>
By Shay Quillen<br>
<br>
Being first isn't always an advantage. <br>
<br>
Wednesday night, San Jose got the first glimpse at Bruce Springsteen and
 the E Street Band's world tour to support their latest album, "Working 
on a Dream." And though the band labored admirably for two hours and 40 
minutes, it's clear that this show needs a little work before the dream 
is achieved. <br>
<br>
For long stretches, the near-capacity crowd at HP Pavilion was glued to 
its seats, and even the can't-miss anthems at the end failed to truly 
achieve liftoff. Throughout, Springsteen struggled to fuse the lush pop 
romanticism of the new album with bleak songs from his catalog that 
speak to the current economic state of the union. <br>
<br>
It's been a mere seven months since Springsteen and the E Street Band 
finished the tour for "Magic," a mostly dark album informed by war and 
political deception. As he finished the songwriting for that album, a 
new batch of songs began to emerge. Before the "Magic" tour was over, 
Springsteen had rushed into the studio to record these tunes, filled to 
overflowing with love and passion and vocal overdubs. But before the 
record could come out, the economy collapsed and Springsteen, always 
attuned to the national zeitgeist, had to readjust. <br>
<br>
As Don Rumsfeld might say, you don't go on tour with the album you wish 
you had, you go on tour with the album you've got. So Springsteen faces 
the tough task of hyping a new romantic pop record while simultaneously 
offering hope and support to a wounded nation ? not an easy task. <br>
<br>
Perhaps he was still tinkering with the formula at the last minute, as 
the band came out an hour late, around 8:30 p.m., to kick off the night 
and the tour with the classic "Badlands." <br>
<br>
Two additions to the troupe ? backup singers Curtis King and Cindy 
Mizelle, increasing the ensemble to an even dozen ? emerged next for 
"Outlaw Pete," the overwrought eight-minute slab of whimsical Americana 
that kicks off "Working on a Dream" in bizarre fashion. <br>
<br>
It was a tough night for the new material. The early appearance of the 
title track, despite some vigorous ensemble whistling, brought the 
previously enthusiastic audience to its seats, and Springsteen's 
attempts to rouse a sing-along were met with apathy. "Good Eye," a 
post-modern roadhouse blues built around repeated rhythmic loops and one
 of the standout tracks on the album, proved to be a difficult fit for 
the E Street Band live. <br>
<br>
Those two songs book-ended a trio of recession-minded numbers: "Seeds" 
(rarely performed over the past two decades) "Johnny 99" and "The Ghost 
of Tom Joad." "Johnny 99," a grim tale of a unrepentant killer from the 
solo acoustic "Nebraska" album, was turned into a rip-roaring rock 'n' 
roll number, with pounding boogie-woogie piano from Roy Bittan. It was 
fun, if a bit incongruous. <br>
<br>
The rock 'n' roll spirit emerged again when Springsteen, for no apparent
 reason, pulled out the classic oldie "Good Rockin' Tonight" mid-set. 
Finally, "Darlington County" got the crowd back to its feet, and a fan 
request for "Growin' Up" kept them there. <br>
<br>
The best showcase for new material was the back-to-back pairing of "The 
Wrestler," the gritty theme to the Mickey Rourke film that appears as a 
bonus track on "Working," and "Kingdom of Days." The latter is a 
unabashedly romantic celebration of marriage that lies at the heart of 
the new album. Springsteen sang it standing side by side with backup 
singer Patti Scialfa, his wife of 17 years (their teenage daughter, 
Jessica Rae, was spotted on the floor during the early part of the show 
dancing along to the music). <br>
<br>
Springsteen's signature song, "Born to Run," closed a two-hour main set that never quite caught fire. <br>
<br>
Yet the Boss kicked off the encores with a perfectly chosen '50s classic
 that showed the potential of this 12-piece band at this juncture in 
American history. A '50s tune is nothing new for Springsteen, you might 
think, except that this one was from the 1850s: Stephen Foster's "Hard 
Times." <br>
<br>
Springsteen and his compadres formed a virtual E Street Chorus as they 
began one of the most beautiful songs in the American canon, and one 
sadly applicable today. As the tour develops, Springsteen would be wise 
to make better use of the additional vocal firepower on hand by adding 
lush "Working" songs like "This Life" to the show. <br>
<br>
A poster for an old Robert Mitchum movie, a gift from a fan, prompted a 
performance of "Thunder Road," always a pleasure to hear. "Dancing in 
the Dark," however, has just about run out of juice, and "10th Avenue 
Freezeout" seemed to be a TiVo of the Super Bowl performance, sans the 
horns. <br>
<br>
"Land of Hope and Dreams," which followed, would have made a perfect 
finale, but instead Springsteen once more trotted out "American Land," 
the jig that has been closing the band's shows in recent years. <br>
<br>
For anyone else, the show would have been fine. For Springsteen and the E
 Street Band, it was decidedly subpar. But based on their track record, 
you've got to like their chances for getting a hold of this before long.
 Guys, please come back once you're warmed up.</div>

				<div class="content">Springsteen's 'Joad' revisits the disposessed<br>
Hartford Courant , 1995-11-20<br>
By Roger Catlin<br>
In 'Born to Run' the 21 year old anthem that introduced Bruce 
Springsteen to a mass audience, the highway was 'Jammed with broken 
heroes, on a last chance pwoer drive.' Still, its protagonist was fairly
 bursting with optimism that he'd 'Get to that place where we really 
want to go....and we'll walk in the sun.' His wild success a decade ago 
may have represented that walking in the sun. But, on 'The Ghost Of Tom 
Joad,' the tiltle track to the fine new Springsteen album due out 
tuesday, it's homeless protagonist notes that 'The highway is alive 
tonight, but nobody's kidding nobody about where it goes.' <br>
<br>
Springsteen moved to California a few years back, maybe to escape is 
overblown New Jersey legend, maybe attracted a bit by the same promise 
that lured John Steinbeck's Fictional Tom Joad from Oklahoma. The new 
surroundings have given him a new inspiration and chilling tales about a
 land where the highway, and its promise, runs out. <br>
<br>
Rather than focusing on his own relativley contented family life on his 
last albums "LuckyTown" and "Human Touch" in 1192, he's shifted his 
sharp gaze to the downtrodden- inspired on part by the success of his 
1993 AIDS meditation. "The Streets Of Philadelphia", and brought to life
 in the same gritty black and white realsim of his stark 1982 solo 
album, "Nebraska". Back among America's underbelly, it's petty thieves, 
cornered poor, and hardboiled characters struggling to make the right 
choices, "TGOTJ" shows Springsteen as commited, focused and intense as 
he's ever been in his career, on songs that are among his best written. 
In a sense, it revists the same "Nebraska" underclass after a decade, 
more battered and desperate in the Gingrich 90's than they were in the 
Reagan 80's. <br>
<br>
The highway isn't the only old Springsteen metaphor turned around in the
 tiltel song. "Got a one way ticket to the promised land," he sings, 
following one of the most chilling lines on the album: " Got a hole in 
your belly, and a gun in your hand." The seriousness these choices 
represent is further explores in the special song, in which an ex-con 
\struggles with going straight. "In the darkness before dinner comes, 
sometimes I can feel the itch." He says. <br>
<br>
While Springsteen still has a stron affinity for the dying hopes of the 
rust belt factory worker (In a mournful "Youngstown" that has a strong 
historical sweep), he's been more recently taken in by the stories of 
desperate Mexican immigrants, risking all for a better life in El Norte.
 The most shocking and original of these stories takes place in a desert
 drug factory, where illegal aliens ar sought to do the dangerous work. 
Another is from the point of view from a border guard, smitten by a 
young woman seeking to cross . <br>
<br>
It's similar to a plot in "The Border," the 1982 Jack Nicholson film for
 which the theme, "Across The Borderline", by Ry Cooder, John Hiatt and 
Jim Dickinson had been part of Springsteen's live repertoire. But 
Springsteen does the film one better by adding a subplot of a friend's 
loyalty- a mystery whose answer, in the best fiction writer's 
traditions, are not truly told. These are songs that invite repeated 
listening, rumination and analysis. <br>
<br>
He's borrowing again from the traditions of Woddy Guthrie, the acoustic 
troubadour and wanderer who watched out for the downtrodden. Along the 
same lines, Springsteen's songs tend to stand on the lyrics and not the 
music, which in many cases sounds similar to previous ballads. And if 
your memory of "Nebraska" is an album of unrelenting gloom, it 
absolutely rocks compared with "Joad." <br>
<br>
As with a collection of powerful short stories, it might be best ot 
consider the songs one a t a time rather than at one sitting. Like a 
volume of Raymond Carver, it may be too much to take in all at once. And
 like a good writer, Springsteen quotes source material- mostly 
newspaper stories. But he also clarifies that he's citing John Ford's 
cinematic vision of Joad based on Steinbeck's "The Grapes Of Wrath" and 
not the novel itself. At the end of the title song, Springsteen quotes 
Joad's moving speech from the classic film. "Wherever ther's a cop 
beatin' a guy.....wherever somebody's strugglin' to be free, look in 
their eyes Mom, and you'll see me." And despite whatever diminished 
commercial prospects this project may have, that's Where Springsteen 
will go to.</div>

Don't scream and shout. <br>
Springsteen's serious about getting serious.<br>
Newsweek , 1996<br>
By Karen Schoemer</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is about to put on a very intense performance for a 
very demanding audience: himself. At 6 on the night of his solo acoustic
 show in Stockholm, he walks out onto the stage for sound-check at the 
Cirkus, an 1.800-seat hall on the European leg of his "Ghost of Tom 
Joad" tour. The stage is bare. The only props are a mean little army of 
black Takamine guitars, lined up 13 strong behind a curtain, each tuned 
differently, yet each with an identical polish on its identical hollow 
body. Springsteen's guitar roadie and keyboardist, Kevin Buell, places 
four or five in a neat, protective semicircle around the microphone. 
Springsteen picks one up. He strums it a few times. Then he softly 
finger-picks the opening notes of "The Ghost of Tom Joad." About halfway
 through the song, he stops. "There is a different sound in here," he 
muses. "It's kinda cool." He listens intently to the fading notes, to 
the empty room, to the silence. <br>
<br>
He plays a couple more songs, trying out the different guitars, sorting 
out the different reverberations they make. A photographer creeps along 
the far reaches of the loge. He's been instructed not to get too close 
to the stage; the clicks of the camera will distract Springsteen's 
obsessive quest for perfection. He plays "Sinaloa Cowboys," another 
harsh, strained breath of a song. Midway through the first verse, the 
guitar emits a honk of feedback. Springsteen tries it again, and the 
feedback honks again. He tries playing the second verse, and it honks at
 the same place in the chord progression. "It's a funky note," 
Springsteen mumbles. "See if I can isolate it." He moves the capo on the
 guitar's neck, changing the key. Then he changes the key again, and a 
third time. "It's just one E flat, for some reason," he says. The false 
note is banished. This isn't just a sound-check; it's an exorcism. <br>
<br>
These days, Springsteen is in severe heavyweight mode. With "The Ghost 
of Tom Joad" and its accompanying tour, which returns to the United 
States this summer, he knows he has a lot to prove, "Tom Joad" is his 
way of asserting that, at 46, he still has something important to say. 
He seems worried that people won't listen, because in each show he 
instructs them to. "This is a community event," he tells the crowd in 
Stockholm. "If anybody's making too much noice, feel free to band 
together and tell them to shut the f- up." It's a new twist on rock 
psychology: tell your audience to be quite and not get too excited. The 
Swedish crowd was supportively attentive, but in the United States, "Tom
 Joad" is proving both a commercial and a critical risk. It's the only 
album in his catalog not to be certified gold or platinum, and the first
 U.S. shows received less-than-jubilant reviews last winter. (But 
another of Springsteen's brutal acoustic songs, the title track from the
 film "Dead Man Walking," was up this week for an Oscar.) If Springsteen
 was once the savior of rock and roll, right now he's its Puritan 
minister, taking America to task for its sins. <br>
<br>
Underneath all the messages, Springsteen is sending an odd, barely 
audible little SOS of his own. In recent years something has been 
missing from his music, and he wants it back very badly: relevance. Not 
just social relevance, but relevance to his audience, relevance to 
himself. His 1992 albums "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town" were commercial 
and critical letdowns. You have to go back to 1987's "Tunnel of Love," 
the heartbreaking chronicle of his failed first marriage, for vintage 
Springsteen; some might argue you have to go back to "Born in the 
U.S.A.," the 1984 runaway career train that sold 15 million copies and 
made him a household name. " I had very high goals for my band when we 
started," he says, backstage after the Stockholm show. He's every bit as
 intense and methodical in his speech as he was onstage. "We didn't go 
just to make music, we went out to make essential music. It was fun and 
entertaining and hopefully enjoyable, but at the core there was 
something serious and essential that tied into the experience of living 
in America. I think that the criticism of some records I made in the 
late '80s or '90s centered around that idea." <br>
<br>
Today Springsteen's personal life has never been more fulfilled. He's 
happily remarried, to singer and bandmate Patti Scialfa, and they're 
raising three kids: Evan, 5; Jessie, 4; and Sam, 2. But he's decided 
that happy home stories aren't what his audience craves. "Before I did 
'Tom Joad' I had another record that was based more on relationships and
 things," he says. "I finished maybe three quaters of it, and I invested
 a good bit of myself in it. But one night I said, 'Gee, I'm not sure 
this is what I want to hear from me right now.' So I sat back and said, 
'Well, what would I want to hear?'" The answer was: essential music. "I 
had a couple of things guiding me. One was 'Streets of Philadelphia,' 
which had gotten a tremendous response. It was a small song that I wrote
 in a few days, but I was addressing outside issues. ['Tom Joad'] is in 
that tradition. It's music that fulfills the promises that I made when I
 began. That's what I'm interested in doing right now. That's who I 
think I should be." <br>
<br>
Yet that evening after the show, when Springsteen and his tour party 
head out to dinner, a very different guy emerges. This isn't 
Springsteen, the retrofitted model; it's plain old vintage Bruce, the 
storyteller, the cutup, the local kid. Prompted by his longtime agent 
Barry Bell, he switches into tourstory mode. "We're playing Lincoln 
Center," Bruce recalls, "and it's a big night. Max [Weinberg, E Street 
drummer] was sick. And he blew his lunch in the middle of 'Born to Run.'
 But he didn't stop playing. Extra merit for Max. Then in the middle of 
'E Street Shuffle' I hear what sounds like a trumpet. And I,m going, 
'Damn. What the hell is Clarence [Clemons] doing with that saxophone?' 
And I look, and next to Clarence is a trumpet player. So I said, 
'Clarence, what's he doing over there?' Clarence goes, 'He said you said
 it was OK!' I said, 'Well, it's not OK. Get him off!' Then we come out 
for an encore, and all of a sudden I notice the stage is rising. I 
think, 'Jesus, this can't be happening.' And then I realize, no, the 
stage isn't rising, the audience is sinking. There's an orchestra pit 
that they put about 100 seats on, and a kid spilled beer into it, 
short-wired the ting. The monitors are crashing in after them. It was 
unbelievable. Our Lincoln Center debut." <br>
<br>
The Boardwalk: Springsteen never leaves that Jersey guy far behind. He 
grew up - it's a famous story - in Freehold, a small town near the 
shore, on a street with a church, a rectory, a convent and a Sinclair 
gas station. " Me and my parents lived in my grandparent's house," he 
says. "Then there was my cousin's house, my aunt's house, my 
great-grandmother's house, my aunt's house on my mother's side with my 
other grandmother in it. We were all on one street, with the church in 
the middle." By his teens, Springsteen was outsider, watching things 
happen, remembering them. "The drummer I had then, Bart Haynes, and this
 fellow Walter Shoeshone, they both died in Vietnam when we were in our 
teens," he says. "I can still see them in their uniforms. Those are very
 powerful images. The factories. It still finds its way into my work." <br>
<br>
People think Springsteen is an uppercrusty L.A. guy now, but he and his 
family still spend most of the year in New Jersey. He has a "big, 
beautiful farm" that he bought a couple of years ago, plus his house in 
tony Rumson. And every summer, they visit the Boardwalk. Jersey is "a 
place I've never left," he says. "I've tried many times, and never done 
it. A part of me did leave, but a part of me always stayed. I still 
enjoy the way it smells and feels in the summertime."</div>

<br>
The New York Times , <br>
June 13, 2000<br>
By Jon Pareles<br>
<br>
...or a songwriter who tries to be as concise and clear as possible, 
Bruce Springsteen can be strangely misunderstood. The mere fact that he 
had written a song prompted by the shooting of Amadou Diallo set off a 
hair-trigger response from police supporters. <br>
<br>
In a case that divided the city, the four police officers who fired 41 
shots at Mr. Diallo, an unarmed street vendor from Guinea, testified 
that they thought he was reaching for a gun when he was apparently 
reaching for a wallet. <br>
<br>
They were acquitted of murder charges. <br>
<br>
Reacting to the title of the song, "American Skin," and its refrain of 
"41 shots," Bob Lucente, the president of the New York state chapter of 
the Fraternal Order of Police, denounced both the song, for supposed 
anti-police messages, and Mr. Springsteen, calling him a "dirt bag." <br>
<br>
"American Skin" itself, which Mr. Springsteen performed on Monday night 
in his first of 10 sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden, is no 
anti-cop diatribe. With piano chords tolling behind Mr. Springsteen's 
care-worn voice, it's a resonant elegy and a reflection on how fear can 
become deadly. <br>
<br>
The song begins with Mr. Springsteen intoning "41 shots" again and 
again. In the first verse, a policeman kneels after the shooting over 
the "body in the vestibule, praying for his life"; in the second, a 
mother instructs her son to be polite to policemen, never run away and 
"keep your hands in sight." <br>
<br>
The third and last verse declares, "We're baptized in these waters and 
in each others' blood." In between, the chorus asks questions that may 
have run through the officers' minds -- "Is it a gun? Is it a knife? Is 
it a wallet? This is your life" -- and concludes, "You can get killed 
just for living in your American skin," a line that could apply to both 
Diallo and the policemen. The song is determinedly evenhanded as it 
ponders exactly what led to those 41 shots. <br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen has made no statement beyond the song itself. But on 
Monday night, he opened his three-hour set with a new rocker, "Code of 
Silence," that he wrote with Joe Grushecky, a kindred songwriter. It 
could be about a couple that has stopped speaking -- he calls someone 
"darling" and "baby" -- or about a broken public trust. He also placed 
"American Skin" between "Point Blank" and "The Promised Land." <br>
<br>
"American Skin" is not the first Springsteen song to be misread. "Born 
in the U.S.A.," released in 1984, is the bitter testimony of a 
down-and-out Vietnam veteran wondering what became of his birthright. 
But President Ronald Reagan, in his re-election campaign, tried to 
enlist it as a patriotic anthem. On Monday, Mr. Springsteen sang the 
version of "Born in the U.S.A." he introduced in the 1990's: a solo, 
with keening slide guitar lines steeped in the blues, that makes the 
song's desperation unmistakable. <br>
<br>
"American Skin" and "Born in the U.S.A." represent one side of Mr. 
Springsteen's songwriting: tales of ordinary people crushed by forces 
they cannot control. That's the side that has emerged as Mr. 
Springsteen, who is 50, has grown older. When he emerged in the 1970's, 
he was already writing about outsiders and castoffs, but they held on to
 some hope that in classic American style they could zoom down the road 
to better times. <br>
<br>
Those were the songs he recorded in the 1970's and 80's with the E 
Street Band; he and the band members went separate ways until the late 
90's. Mr. Springsteen has been touring with them for a year, and they 
have reached a new peak as an ensemble: gleaming with the keyboards of 
Roy Bittan and Danny Federici, surging with the bass lines of Garry W. 
Tallent and the drumming of Max Weinberg, honking with rhythm-and-blues 
from Clarence Clemons's saxophone and unleashing three lead guitarists 
-- Mr. Springsteen, Steve Van Zandt and Nils Lofgren. Mr. Springsteen's 
wife, Patti Scialfa, strums acoustic guitar and sings backup. The band 
vamps like a soul revue, then hits like a stainless-steel fist. <br>
<br>
And while Mr. Springsteen performed some of his no-way-out songs -- 
including a version of "Youngstown" that howled with desolation -- the 
concert was not about compassion or fatalism. It was about camaraderie 
and redemption. Twice, Mr. Springsteen let songs stretch out and turned 
himself into a preacher, promising to spread "the ministry of rock 'n' 
roll." <br>
<br>
He dropped to his knees, stretched out his arms and worked the crowd 
like a gospel singer. The house lights stayed on through much of the 
show; Mr. Springsteen wanted the audience <br>
<br>
to join in, and wouldn't rest until it did (although he met no 
resistance). He was also bonded with the band, sharing a microphone with
 all the musicians whose instruments were portable, even trading vocals 
on a love song, "If I Should Fall Behind." <br>
<br>
Reuniting with the band and singing anthems like "Born to Run" and 
"Thunder Road" have rejuvenated Mr. Springsteen. There were also 
unreleased songs in the set, and they were substantial and tinged with 
optimism. <br>
"Further on Up the Road" vowed, "Let's take the good times as they come"
 and "Land of Hope and Dreams" predicted, "Tomorrow there will be 
sunshine, and all this darkness pass." The way the band sounded, it was 
easy to believe.</div>

<br>
The Post's Joe Heim interviewed Bruce Springsteen backstage on November 
20 before his concert in Baltimore for this story about the Kennedy 
Center Honors. Here are some additional thoughts from Springsteen that 
do not appear in the piece:<br>
<br>
Washington Post , <br>
December 4, 2009<br>
By Joe Heim<br>
<br>
Q: You used to talk about these famous battles that you would have with 
your dad. I wonder what your dad would think about you winning the 
highest honor that America gives to its artists. <br>
<br>
A: First he would not have known what it was. (Laughs.) After my mother 
got done explaining it to him, it would have been like, "Well, that's 
nice." I had that experience when I won the Oscar back in mid-90s and I 
put it on the kitchen table. And it's there and he says, "Oh, I'll never
 tell anybody what to do ever again." (Laughs.) He took a lot of 
satisfaction and enjoyment out of the work that I did and the success 
that we had towards the whole last 10-15 years of his life. So, I wish 
he was around to be here. It would have meant a tremendous amount to the
 two of us. My mother will be here, but I would like to have had him 
here. <br>
<br>
Q: You said your 50s were this incredibly fruitful period. Do you have that same expectation for your 60s or no? <br>
<br>
A: Yeah, I do. I have a lot of ideas in the bag right now. I have a lot 
of things I'm working . . . I feel like writing is at its most natural 
now and it comes to me. You've studied your craft enough to know to make
 it a simple process. You know when something's not so great. You know 
when an idea is not going to work out. <br>
<br>
When I was young I was going on my instincts. Now, once you hit 60, you 
have your instincts and you have your creative intelligence. Your 
instincts, genius can come out of that. All the original rock and 
rollers had incredibly creative instincts. But if you don't develop your
 creative intelligence, you're gonna hit the wall somewhere. Now, or 
later. So developing that creative intelligence is what allows you to 
expand your work and broaden what you're able to do. So I am able to 
call on my study over the past 40 years so I can put less time in, get 
better work and hone in on the subjects I'd like to write about with 
more precision. <br>
<br>
Also, the stress of attempting to forge an identity, the fear of loss of
 that identity has subsided to a great degree. Because we've had 40 
years of establishing who you are, what you do. It also allows you to do
 more varied types of projects and write songs that might be a little 
off base or out to the left or out to the right. <br>
<br>
Q: More freedom? <br>
<br>
A: Yeah more creative freedom. Every record isn't your last anymore, now it's your next one. <br>
<br>
Q: Where did the poetry in your songs first come from? You've said you didn't do well in school and never really liked school. <br>
<br>
A: It came off rock and roll records. I read no poetry and was exposed 
to none. When I first heard "Greetings from Asbury Park" compared to 
"Howl" the Allen Ginsburg poem, I had to go out and get it and see what 
it was. I got it through my connection with Dylan and Donovan and the 
bottom line was in the early '70s there was an enormous explosion of 
"poetic" singer songwriters. <br>
<br>
And then you wrote it as a kid. Every teenager scrubbed out some sort of
 poetry on a sheet of paper. But really it came from rock and roll 
records. I didn't become a reader until I was 26 years old. I read very 
little of most things until rather late in life. <br>
<br>
Q: When you listen to your early songs, do you remember the meaning you 
had when you wrote them and does that meaning change for you over the 
years? <br>
<br>
A: Well, yeah, I remember, like "Lost in the Flood," if you look at it 
closely it's an anti-war song. We were involved in protests in New 
Jersey at a small local level in the late '60s and early '70s because of
 the Vietnam war. We did some benefit shows. We did one for McGovern and
 did one to send some protesters to Washington. This was when we were 
teenagers because it was part of the life of the day. Social 
consciousness was to the fore. Now people don't remember a time like 
that, particularly with that much tension in the air. <br>
<br>
There were two kinds of kids at the time. There were kinds of kids who 
threw themselves into the '60s, and there were guys who continued to 
lead a life of the '50s. My brother in law is a 1950s guy. In our family
 it got all mixed up. I went one way. My little sister is kind of post 
'60s. My other sister and brother-in-law were kind of products of the 
'50s and lived a very working class, blue collar, New Jersey life. But 
amongst my group of musicians and local bohemians and outcasts, 
political consciousness was part of what you wore at the time. It was in
 fashion! I look back and that's one of my favorite early songs. I set a
 lot of the scenes locally. At the dragstrip. It was sort of about the 
tremendous feeling of bloody confusion that was going on in the land at 
the time. I was trying to sort my way through it. <br>
<br>
A lot of those things in those early lyrics were sort of twisted 
autobiography. "Blinded by the Light" was just Asbury Park. "Growin Up" 
was just what the title says. <br>
<br>
Q: Let's talk a little bit about politics. You signed on for Kerry. Not 
successful. Obama wins and you talked about that night being this magic 
sort of night for America. Where are you now on Obama and the 
administration's progress so far? <br>
<br>
A: A year in office and I think he's done very well. I think that they 
are methodical. And the incredible mess that he inherited in its epic 
size, isn't something you sort out in a year. Afghanistan, we've got to 
be a little careful sending more boots in there. Because it does feel 
like deja vu all over again. I think there are other ways of making sure
 America is safe and combating our enemies . . . than expending more 
American lives. I think that's dangerous. That's just my opinion. <br>
<br>
Health care, I'd like to see the public option. I think that keeps the 
insurance companies more honest and it'd be better for the American 
public. I mean, I have my own opinions about all these things, there's 
nobody asking me for them. (Laughs.) It isn't any different than before.
 There's nobody saying, 'Call the guitar player from New Jerrrrsey and 
see what he has to say about this.' <br>
<br>
The most devastating thing at the moment, of course, is the unemployment
 level and they've got to find a way to put all these Americans back to 
work. There's got to be some sort of public funding, some sort of jobs 
program, whether it's for infrastructure or whatever it is to help get 
Americans back to work. That is crushing. I have friends losing homes 
that were solidly middle class previously. I've been working with food 
banks across the nation and every single one of them told me that 
shelves are going empty and that demand is going up tremendously. And we
 also have to deal with the fact that until there's balance, people are 
going to be angry about Wall Street doing so well and the people who 
bailed them out getting the [expletive] dumped on them. You've got to 
harness some of that anger. Anger and rage have their place. <br>
<br>
I think that [Obama]'s in a very difficult position in that people are 
looking towards him to be a Rooseveltian, Kennedy-like type of presence 
which is simply something that when you see him and you see him speak 
and when he was on the campaign trail, you simply felt that's what this 
man has in him. I believe he does. <br>
<br>
I thought there was a very interesting article in the New York Times a 
couple of weeks ago by Tom Friedman who was discussing the essential 
need for poetry in capturing the American public's imagination about 
these incredibly difficult tasks. [Obama's] very good about getting 
people excited and motivated. I think that keeping people centered, 
excited and motivated about fixing the country in the midst of all the 
dark and very hateful noise out there is a great, great challenge. <br>
<br>
A year in, after what came down, is not very long. So I'm still very 
hopeful and faithful and I'm looking forward to the rest of his term. <br>
<br>
Q: Are you writing an autobiography? <br>
<br>
A: I do a lot of things, many which never happen. (Laughs.) I've written
 a lot of records that don't see the light of day. So, I don't want to 
say, 'Yeah, wait til you hear this one! Have I got a tale to tell!' So 
I'm not going to say a lot about this one because very often I put work 
in on some things. . . . Don't be saving a spot on your bookshelf for 
it! <br>
<br>
Q: A number of people who were close to you passed away over the past 
couple of years. I wonder if you had any reactions to their passing that
 surprised you. <br>
<br>
A: By the time you've hit 60 you've seen a certain amount of dying going
 on. Well, I saw it in my teens too because I had two pals who were 
killed in Vietnam. But the most difficult thing is when it's younger 
people and I've seen people in their 30s. We had a lovely neighbor who 
passed away and left two sons. So it's very difficult when people are 
young and they seem to have so much unfinished business. Those are the 
people I find I'm always waiting to see come in the door again or pass 
by the front window of the house. Those are the people you can't quite 
put that in perspective. <br>
<br>
My close assistant, that was Terry, we were together for 23 years. He 
passed away on the last tour. He had a big life filled with a lot of 
experiences; a Navy Seal and a big legend on the Jersey shore. And I 
wish I had him around, you know, but he lived a pretty big full life. 
Danny, you know, had the terrible illness that he struggled with very, 
very bravely and it went along for a period of years. He was the first E
 Street band member that was lost. I was very proud of the fact that all
 of my men and women were alive after all these years. Not many other 
groups could make that claim. We didn't lose anybody in the usual, often
 very tragic ways that occur in rock and roll band. And if we had to 
lose somebody, it was sort of, hey, you get older, things happen, some 
times you get ill. That's what happens at a certain age. It's very 
difficult because the band is such an organic, cohesive unit. There's 
only one, there's not two of anybody that's going to be on the stage 
tonight. <br>
<br>
Q: Does the tour, you might not want to say forever, but does it feel like the end of the E Street Band? <br>
<br>
A: Oh no, man. Are you kidding me? There's still fannies in the seats 
out there! People want to see this [expletive]. They want to go away and
 say, 'Wow, I don't believe what I just saw.' And that's something we 
still do. So no, no. We're in the middle of something. We're in the 
middle of some new thing. There's an audience that will be there tonight
 that will way outlive us. The last decade it was like great, we got 
that started again. Now let's go! As long as people can stay healthy. 
Hell, we'll do it when we're half healthy. We're not choosy. No, there's
 a long life in the band left. I'm very excited about where the band is 
right now. I think if you come out tonight you're going to see the best E
 Street Band that ever played. The body of music is so large now and the
 audience is going from six years old to people actually, I believe, 
possibly older than myself. (Laughs.) <br>
<br>
And so that's deeply satisfying. We're musicians to the bone. It ain't 
easy to get us to go home. we're traveling musicians. Everybody in that 
van has got the same thing in their blood and in their bones. And 
there's many miles to go before we sleep. <br>
<br>
Q: On the E Street Band <br>
<br>
A: I've found that the last decade for me has been as exciting as any 
other 10 years we've ever had. I think we were one of the few bands of 
our generation that I think wrote songs and made records that stand up 
to what people consider our classics. And take a place in essential 
listening in our body of work . . . That was a great goal when I got the
 E Street Band back together. And it was the only thing that gave me 
pause before I got the band back together. I wasn't interested in a 
repetition of what we'd done. I was interested in a renewal of our 
spirit and action and our power in our fans life and in the life of the 
country. That was what we wanted to accomplish when we got the band back
 together. We wanted to write those kinds of songs, make those kinds of 
records and perform those kinds of shows. <br>
<br>
Q: On his recording process <br>
<br>
A: I have a process where I demo everything, which I really began with 
"Nebraska" but I really do it now, where I demo everything before I 
record so that I have the basis of album sitting in front of me. Brendan
 O'Brien, my producer, works quickly. We make our records in three to 
five weeks. Every record I've made over the past decade has been made in
 that short a period of time. It allows you to make more records, get 
more music out to your fans, move on to other ideas. It's just 
continually stimulating.</div>

				<div class="content">11/26, VANCOUVER: A GOOD COMPANION<br>
<br>
Backstreets founder Charles R. Cross on his first show of the tour <br>
<br>
For a whole variety of reasons — parenting demands, hellacious book 
deadlines, soccer tournaments, child custody schedules — Vancouver, BC 
was the first show of the current Springsteen tour I saw. Some readers, 
and many of my friends with dozens of shows under their belts, will 
consider that heretical, but "real life" has demanded more of me than it
 once did. There was a time when my biggest scheduling concern in life —
 back when I did little but follow Bruce tours around — was trying to 
time when the encore might end, so I could rush outside and hand out 
brochures for a magazine I had just started called Backstreets.<br>
<br>
The Vancouver show was emotional for me before it even began. Sitting 
just to the left the stage, only a few rows up — I don’t have the knees 
for G.A. — it suddenly hit me that this was the first show without him, 
the first E Street Band show for me without the Big Man's presence. It's
 not like I didn't know that going in, or hadn't watched the videos, or 
listened to the tapes. But it still hit me, as a reminder of my own 
mortality as well, that what once was will one day no longer be. And 
then when Charlie Giordano came on, a musician who I've always thought 
was absolutely top-notch, it was my reminder that Danny Federici was 
gone, too.<br>
<br>
But when Bruce came onstage and started with the somewhat odd choice of 
"Shackled and Drawn," the new era began, and I was onboard. It was 
unlike any E Street show opener I'd ever witnessed, with Bruce on 
acoustic and a song itself that seemed more Seeger Sessions than E 
Street. But by the end of the song, with 12 other band members joining 
Bruce in a line at the front of the stage, the head-on assault won me 
over.<br>
<br>
"Out in the Street" was more the traditional E Street mood, though 
"Hungry Heart" as the third song seemed strangely timed, as if we were 
starting the sing-alongs prematurely. And if Bruce's falling into the 
crowd was a bit too contrived to a veteran of many shows, it was still 
an impressive leap of faith, knowing that one drop to the concrete might
 shift history. Bruce seemed positively impassioned singing "We Take 
Care of Our Own," as if he were playing it on an election eve, and the 
song was an anthem that could change things. Maybe it did.<br>
<br>
As one of the old guard, I find "Death to My Hometown" somehow off, the 
sea-shanty-like tone simply too far a shift from the guitar rock I grew 
up on, or even the acoustic folk of the solo work. But "My City of 
Ruins" followed, and it was one of the highlights of the night. Yes, 
Bruce has been playing this song for years now, but it comes off as if 
he wrote it in the past three weeks, and his gospel-tinged singing was 
magnificent. He spoke about Asbury Park, how the band all met there, how
 the town had spent 25 years trying to recover and finally did, only to 
be washed away. It is a song that has become on this tour about 
"ghosts," he said, "people or places or things that have scarred your 
heart, and that you will carry with you forever." He didn’t need to 
mention his departed band members — everyone knew.<br>
<br>
No one gets through life without grief, without loss. Even during 
Springsteen's ascendant Born to Run tour there was always a melancholy 
onstage, there in Bruce, not far under the surface, raw. Some of it may 
have come from unrequited romantic love (rock music's grandest theme). 
Some may have come from growing up in a house with a troubled father, or
 from facing the impossible dream of life as a musician when that seemed
 crazy itself. And some of that melancholy may have simply come as part 
of his nature. It is the "dark cloud" talked about when they were in the
 studio during the Blood Brothers filming. That cloud is, and has always
 been, his greatest musical signature, where his darkness touches a 
listener with a sadness, but also with something innately human.<br>
<br>
That melancholy was all over "My City of Ruins," even if in Vancouver he
 was as far geographically from Asbury Park as he's going to get on this
 leg of the tour. It was also the song where I felt the original E 
Streeters were most present: Steven locked in, Garry playing as if he 
alone wrote it, Max powering through it as if he were driving a train 
against a gale-force wind. It was exquisite.<br>
<br>
It didn't stay that intense, of course. What came next were old 
chestnuts, "Spirit in the Night" and "Does this Bus Stop at 82nd 
Street?," the latter played, Bruce said, as a request. They were 
nostalgic, but felt somehow less ancient than "My City of Ruins," 
written decades later.<br>
<br>
In Bruce's nightly selection of signs there was a clear standout: A fan 
had created an anatomically correct, full-sized "Red Headed Woman,” and 
her cut-out was pulled onstage. Bruce liked the sign so much he said he 
was going to take it back to the hotel to "study it later." "This sign 
is so good we're going to play this one, and we don't even know it 
anymore," he said. And he wasn't exactly kidding, as it was a bit rough,
 but it was the night's comedic highpoint.<br>
<br>
"Streets of Fire" and "Because the Night" followed, then "She's the One"
 became the first song of the night from Born to Run, with Nils killing.
 And eventually, inevitably, there was the Born in the U.S.A. party 
segment with "Cover Me" and "Darlington County." As much as I dislike 
those songs, I still miss seeing Nils in the big foam hat, doing flips 
onstage, and seeing the whole band truly making it corny. "Raise Your 
Hand" was back more to my liking, and it works very well with the full 
horn section and the back-up singers. There were many times this giant 
super-sized E Street Band reminded me of Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom, 
with dozens of people onstage, and a musical landscape that could shift 
to soul music on a dime.<br>
<br>
"The Rising" brought it back to traditional rock, and "Badlands" 
followed. And on "Land of Hope and Dreams" Max proved why he's the best 
drummer in rock, taking a song that isn't an anthem, and barreling 
through it until he alone turned it into one.<br>
<br>
From "Racing in the Street" to open the encore, it was on to "Radio 
Nowhere," into "Born to Run," "Dancing in the Dark," "Santa Claus," and,
 finally, "Tenth Avenue Freeze-out" to end the night. A solid set, 
without any wild premieres or unheard of shout-outs, but for a show 
after a break, mostly tight and taut throughout.<br>
<br>
If there was a part of the night that stood above all others to me — 
someone who came of age in the '70s, and for whom Bruce Springsteen's 
live shows then were an indelible part of the soundtrack to my life — it
 was the one-two punch of "Streets of Fire" and "Because the Night." Not
 because they were the best-played guitar-rock songs of the night 
(though they were), but because they had the transformative effect of 
making me feel young again. They reminded me of a time in my life when 
any and everything was possible, even the idea that Backstreets, 
something solely about Bruce Springsteen, was feasible. That was 32 
years ago, but somehow listening to "Streets of Fire" and remembering 
the haunting, aching power of that song on my younger self, brought me 
back.<br>
<br>
Vancouver was a solid show, though most of the die-hards will not likely
 rank it in the top 20 of the tour, due to setlist and the occasional 
rusty moment. But at least for this particular fan, it had an added 
significance that will always rank it high. It was my first Springsteen 
show with my 12-year-old son Ashland next to me, and his first show 
ever.<br>
<br>
I decided never to force feed Springsteen to my child, so though he 
heard much over the years (and grew up in a house with Steel Mill 
posters), it became just part of the landscape, and not the paint on the
 walls. Eventually, he found Bruce on his own, mostly during the past 
year as he started to play guitar.<br>
<br>
<br>
So when Bruce played "Because the Night" in Vancouver, I watched as my 
own pre-teen sang and air-guitar strummed along. He'd found "Because the
 Night" on his own, added it to his iPod, asked his guitar teacher to 
show him the chords, and now he was yelling along, just like his dad. 
There was my DNA, my beautiful reward, in a moment that I never could 
have imagined 32 years ago, back when I thought Backstreets was my 
life's only creation.<br>
<br>
Vancouver wasn't the perfect Bruce show, but in a way it was my perfect 
Springsteen show. I'll stand by your side. You'll need a good companion 
for this part of the ride. Dreams will not be thwarted. All this 
darkness past. Faith will be rewarded.</div>

THE ORIGINAL WRECKING BALL: BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN’S “NEBRASKA”</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen’s seventeenth studio album, “Wrecking Ball,” has 
landed. It pairs some musical experimentation—tape loops, samples, a bit
 of rapping (not by the Boss, thankfully, but by the gospel singer 
Michelle Moore)—with familiar Springsteen lyrical iconography: American 
flags, steel wheels, shuttered factories, and suitcases packed for a 
quick escape. Springsteen told Rolling Stone that “the record basically 
started out as folk music—just me and a guitar singing these songs,” 
before he began working with producer Ron Aniello on a more eclectic and
 anthemic sound. In the same interview, Springsteen also said: “This is 
as direct a record as I ever made. That’s with the possible exception of
 ‘Nebraska,’ which this record has a lot in common with.”<br>
<br>
Let’s see. This January marked the thirtieth anniversary of the 
recording of “Nebraska,” one of the more mythical events in pop-music 
history. Over the course of several days at his home in Colts Neck, New 
Jersey, and armed principally with a guitar, harmonica, and 
glockenspiel, Springsteen laid down what he thought were demos for a new
 album that he’d record with the E Street Band. That album never got 
made; after rehearsals with the full band, Springsteen, his manager, Jon
 Landau, and others decided that the lyrics—about murder, hard luck, 
regret, and father-and-son strife—were better served by the low-fi 
originals. What emerged on “Nebraska” was a hushed, thin, and stark 
sound, which, because of its provenance, seemed almost divinely 
inspired. Accordingly, the device that captured the sound, a Tascam 
Portastudio 144 tape recorder, has become a kind of holy object among 
fans. The album’s lyrics, meanwhile, seem drawn from a harrowing and 
unnervingly gorgeous hell right here on earth.<br>
<br>
In “Heart of Darkness: Bruce Springsteen’s Nebraska,” a new history of 
the album, published this past December, David Burke connects its themes
 to the political and economic climate that marked the early Reagan 
years. Springsteen has said that Reagan’s election startled him into a 
newfound political consciousness. Burke quotes a Springsteen interview 
in which the Boss said that “Nebraska” was about the loss of community 
and “spiritual breakdown,” times and places when people “just get shot 
off somewhere where nothing seems to matter.” Among the album’s story 
songs, murder ballads, confessions, and deathbed laments are plenty of 
sociological markers. Bad prices have killed the family farm. The bank 
is about to take the house. Vietnam vets have been screwed from all 
sides. Someone closed the auto plant in Mahwah.<br>
<br>
The economy was lousy in 1982, and it’s lousy today, at least for the 
people who appear in Springsteen songs. “Wrecking Ball” is also filled 
with criminals, but they aren’t the outcasts and the misfits that 
populate “Nebraska.” This time, they are members of the one per cent. 
And, while “Nebraska” tells plaintive, first-person stories, most of the
 songs on “Wrecking Ball” are thematic rather than narrative—fables 
about the capital-letter ideas of Politics, the Economy, and the State 
of the Union. With its proud liberal populism and wide sampling of the 
national musical melting pot, “Wrecking Ball” is a big-tent vision of 
America. It may be an imperfect and deeply unfair place, but it’s still a
 party. And perhaps a hootenany will help sort things out. (It’s fitting
 that Obama included the album’s first single, “We Take Care of Our Own”
 on his campaign playlist on Spotify.)<br>
<br>
If “Wrecking Ball” is the big top, then “Nebraska” is the freak show. 
Burke’s book is informative, but it places too much emphasis on the 
songs as cultural commentary; they are about something deeply sinister. 
Sissy Spacek’s affectless narration in the Terrence Malick movie 
“Badlands” inspired the album’s title track, told from the man’s 
perspective, which opens: “I saw her standin’ on her front lawn, just 
a-twirlin’ her baton. / Me and her went for a ride, sir, and ten 
innocent people died.” The prairie edge continues with the screechy 
yodel that kicks off “Johnny 99.” And the chilling shriek that ends 
“State Trooper.” Springsteen was reading Flannery O’Connor at the time. 
The album is shot through with the real possibility of an evil that 
transcends circumstance, what O’Connor writes about in the story “A Good
 Man is Hard to Find”: “Then it’s nothing for you to do but enjoy the 
few minutes you got left the best way you can—by killing somebody or 
burning down his house or doing some other meanness to him. No pleasure 
but meanness.”<br>
<br>
“Nebraska” may be an anomaly in Springsteen’s career rather than a 
signpost. (Stephen Metcalf, writing at Slate, once called it “the only 
record you can push on the nonbelievers.”) It doesn’t offer signs of 
hope, redemption, or community. There’s no “we” anywhere in it. It’s 
nihilistic in its philosophy, and agnostic in its politics. Perhaps most
 importantly, the album, in its tightly controlled sound and theme, 
resists the power of Springsteen’s outsized personality and his immense 
power to entertain. There has often been a dissonance between Bruce 
Springsteen’s music and the content of his lyrics. It’s why “Born in the
 U.S.A.”—a deeply anti-American song—gets played at Tea Party rallies. 
The big political numbers on “Wrecking Ball” may have started as folk 
songs, and they look serious on paper, but they’ll be heard beneath the 
bright lights of stadiums, and most likely this fall at the Democratic 
National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. “Nebraska,” meanwhile,
 is about a different kind of politics, and should be heard in the dark.</div>

Redemption through rock and roll<br>
Wynn Wheldon 1 December 2012<br>
Bruce Peter Ames Carlin<br>
Simon and Schuster, <br>
<br>
E Street Shuffle Clinton Heylin<br>
Constable, pp.438, </strong><br>
<br>
‘I’m the President, but he’s the Boss’, Barack Obama declared a couple 
of years ago, and most Spectator readers will know Bruce Springsteen as 
the President’s celebrity pop star friend. (One of the first of the many
 pleasures Peter Ames Carlin’s book affords is the story of how 
Springsteen came byhis nickname: he was a ruthless player of 
‘Cut-throat’ Monopoly.)<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is much more than a celebrity, and Carlin’s book far 
from a dispiriting celebrity hagiography. Although written with the full
 co-operation of Springsteen himself, it pulls no punches in describing 
the singer’s faults and weaknesses, cruelties and mistakes. To his fans 
he can do no wrong (other than that awful video for Dancing in the 
Dark), but so driven a performer requires a robust ego. His temper is 
short and his judgment swift, and before his marriages he was a 
disagreeably jealous lover.<br>
<br>
He admits to too much self-analysis, and yet his songs are invariably 
narrated either by a fictionalised first person or are about others. On 
his most recent album, Wrecking Ball, he assumes an ironic ‘we’ (meaning
 the USA) in ‘We Take Care of Our Own’, the voices of the dead oppressed
 in ‘We Are Alive’ and the persona (if that is possible) of the Giants 
Stadium (awaiting demolition at the time) in the title song. Even early 
songs, such as ‘Thunder Road’ and ‘Born to Run’ are fantasies of escape 
rather than records of actual experience.<br>
<br>
Carlin’s book is first-rate for its first two thirds.  As it approaches 
the present, Springsteen’s status as untouchable cultural icon begins to
 ossify the tale. Even here, however, it is superior to Clinton Heylin’s
 book, which is standard rock biography with its treacle of hyperbolic 
adjectives. That is not to say that die-hard fans will not enjoy it. 
Heylin quotes Springsteen at length, so the book works as a compendium 
of the singer’s spoken (and written) words.<br>
<br>
Born in Freehold, New Jersey, in 1949, on his father’s side of a family 
that sailed from Holland in the mid-17th century, and on his mother’s 
from Irish-Italian stock, he was sent to a local Catholic school. He 
hated it. While rejecting the religion, he took from it a vocabulary 
that allowed him to imbue mundane lives with heroic qualities. His songs
 are full of holy nights, angels, fires, floods, and, most emphatically,
 faith and hope. (‘I knew he was a Catholic’, said legendary A&amp;R man
 John Hammond, having heard three songs.)What took the place of 
Catholicism was rock and roll, and he has been an evangelist for its 
redemptive powers ever since.<br>
<br>
Springsteen began playing in bands at the age of 15, and as both these 
books testify, started as he continued, with utter commitment, 
practising every spare moment, and gravitating to band leadership with 
whomsoever he played. He didn’t drink until his mid-twenties (and has 
always avoided drugs, for fear of ‘losing control’), his highs always 
natural, usually onstage.<br>
<br>
Eventually he found a like-minded manager in the form of Mike Appel, 
who, though often painted as villainous, emerges in both books as a 
character as determined as his client to make of Springsteen what 
Springsteen wanted made. It just so happened that another character took
 Appel’s place in Springsteen’s vision of himself.<br>
<br>
‘I have seen rock and roll future, and its name is Bruce Springsteen,’ 
music critic Jon Landau wrote in 1974. Although Springsteen hated the 
use to which the line was put, Landau became his manager, and remains so
 to this day. What Landau brought was a degree of creative 
sophistication that appealed to the autodidact in the singer.<br>
<br>
The album that made Bruce Springsteen was Born to Run, released the 
following year, a collection of urban stories characterised by what 
Springsteen called ‘an orchestral sound’ and boasting a famous cover, 
the leather-jacketed rocker leaning against the ‘Big Man’, saxophonist 
and friend Clarence Clemons. A decade later Born in the USA made him a 
megastar, with all the fatuous fandom that accompanies such a status, 
and likewise all the ignorant contempt (in Ian McEwan’s novel Saturday a
 country and western singer is described without irony as ‘the 
thinking-man’s Bruce Springsteen’).<br>
<br>
The truth is that the working-class boy became a consummate middle-class
 liberal, supporting the usual causes but avoiding the smug 
self-righteousness of many of his fellow superstars. Earlier this year, 
Springsteen ended a speech to young rockers with the following: ‘When 
you walk on stage tonight to bring the noise, treat it like it’s all we 
have — and then remember it’s only rock and roll.’ He does know that 
while he is the Boss, he’s not the president.<br>
<br>
There have been calls to put to bed ‘the American Dream’ as hopelessly 
out of sync with the times. Bruce Springsteen and Barack Obama are 
surely prime exemplars of its continuing plausibility.<br>

Bruce Springsteen walks with the ghosts -- and the fans -- at the Rose Garden: Review<br>
<br>
 By Ryan White, <br>
The Oregonian <br>
November 29, 2012</strong> <br>
<br>
The night was about "our ghosts," Bruce Springsteen was saying 
Wednesday. The ghosts of the fallen, the ghosts of places long gone. His
 ghosts, the E Street Band's ghosts. Our ghosts.<br>
<br>
"My City of Ruins," the song he was introducing, was originally written 
for Asbury Park, N.J. A prayer for strength and better days ahead, it 
came to be about New York, and the rest of the country, after Sept. 11. 
In the aftermath of Sandy, it is again about the Jersey shore.<br>
<br>
Places, and people.<br>
<br>
A spotlight fell on the the stage to Springsteen's right during the 
song, which came six songs into what would stretch to just another 25 
26-song, 3 hour, 12 minute flex of all his and the band's many powers.<br>
<br>
No longer can they do that, however, without acknowledging those ghosts.
 The E Street Band's history, its story, is part of the power.<br>
<br>
Where once the organ had been occupied by Dan Federici, and that side of
 the stage had been home to one Clarence "Big Man" Clemons, there was 
emptiness. Federici died in 2008. Clemons died in 2011. But in that 
emptiness, there was strength.<br>
<br>
We best honor our ghosts by living, right? That's really what the show 
was about. Life. Being alive. That's why the Rose Garden was nearly sold
 out, and exuberant, and for once almost -- almost -- as tireless as the
 star his own bad self.<br>
<br>
Opening with "Land of Hope and Dreams" as a sort of invitation, 
Springsteen and the 16-piece band powering behind him  (five horns, 
three background singers, a percussionist and all your favorites from E 
Street, minus Patti Scialfa) went to work.<br>
<br>
"I'm an old man," the 63-year-old Springsteen said, "but I've got a job to do."<br>
<br>
By the third song, "Hungry Heart," Springsteen's shirt was showing hints
 of the soaking to come, and he was surfing perhaps the slowest crowd 
wave in the history of crowd surfing, lolling from a riser in the middle
 of the Rose Garden's floor back to the stage.<br>
<br>
By the the seventh song, Springsteen was taking requests. The first came
 from a over-sized work made up to look a little like Elvis Costello's 
"Spectacular Spinning Songbook" wheel. After making sure the wheel spun,
 Springsteen invited a woman in the front row up to spin it. The first 
try landed on "Pay Me My Money Down," but she tried to quickly move it 
to "Roulette." <br>
<br>
"Spin it again," Springsteen said.<br>
<br>
"Uh oh," Springsteen said.<br>
<br>
Van Zandt thought about it for a moment and pulled out "Loose Ends," a 
River-era outtake that made its way to the "Tracks" box set.<br>
<br>
Next, a sign asking for "Growing Up" in honor of a 50th birthday. Not 
only did the guy get his song, but he got to get up and sing it with 
Springsteen. Later, the now-regular group of women in "Lesbians (heart) 
Bruce" T-shirts made it up on stage to dance during "Darlington County."<br>
<br>
A couple of girls got to help sing "Waiting on a Sunny Day." A little 
girl, and a bunch of women who had a sign declaring their desire to 
dance with Van Zandt were pulled up during "Dancing in the Dark." During
 the same song, when security saw some fans climbing on the riser in the
 middle of the floor and went after them, Springsteen urged them to 
stick with it.<br>
<br>
"Don't pay any attention to that guy," he said, pointing at his security detail and laughing. "(Bleep) that guy."<br>
<br>
It wasn't enough to walk with the ghosts, Springsteen seemed determined to walk with each person in the arena, too.<br>
<br>
And always, just when it seemed it could go totally out of control, 
Springsteen brought it back. Taking a request for "Seeds," a searing 
song about desperation, he paused to set it up with "Jack of all 
Trades," a resolute-in-the-face-of-adversity ballad from his latest 
record, "Wrecking Ball." Then "Seeds," then a blistering "Johnny 99" 
that ended with the horns taking over the stage, and the party was on 
again.<br>
<br>
By request, "Drive All Night" made only its seventh full-band appearance
 since 1981 (if this is right*), and Jake Clemons, one of two sax 
players taking the spot of his uncle, well, those solos were goosebump 
fuel.<br>
<br>
The main set ended with the left-right combination of "Badlands" into 
"Thunder Road." The encore opened with a solo "If I Should Fall Behind" 
followed by the familiar "One, two!" count-off of "Born To Run." 
"Rosalita" came out -- followed shortly by Santa Claus, and the night 
ended with "10th Avenue Freeze-Out," and Springsteen, drenched in sweat 
and water, first atop Roy Bittan's piano, then back in the middle of the
 arena leading one last salute to Clemons and Federici, and finally on 
his knees belting out the final notes.<br>
<br>
And by then it seemed like four or five other concerts had passed since 
Springsteen strummed away at the song "Wrecking Ball," a song that, when
 it debuted, seemed destined to be a one-off for a football stadium on 
the other side of the country.<br>
<br>
Songs change -- even from when they're recorded. What was once "When all
 this steel and these stories drift away to rust," is now, "When all 
this steel and my stories."<br>
<br>
Then: "When the game has been decided, and we're burning down the clock."<br>
<br>
Now: "When your game has been decided, and you're burning down the clock."<br>
<br>
It was personal. Us and him and them and everything we brought with us 
to the show, the good and the bad. But the bad wasn't any match for the 
good and the great on Wednesday night.</div>

by  Dave Marsh</strong><br>
<br>
June 26, 2011<br>
<br>
Clarence Clemons, said both my daughter and Bruce Springsteen this week,
 passed through his life doing exactly what he wanted to do. Bruce said 
the rest, which amounted to admitting that you can’t really do that, and
 the result of trying to is confusion and turbulence and discomfort and 
illusion. Except when it works. Then the result is clarity and joy, 
peace and truth miraculously revealed.<br>
<br>
There are all sorts of meanings for what I watched Bruce and the Big Man
 do up there on those hundreds of stages for the past four decades, but 
the one that always struck closest to my heart drew them into the soul 
of the American drama and dilemma. Like Huckleberry Finn, the guilty 
boy, and Nigger Jim, the escaped slave, they traveled against the 
current even as they flowed with it, innocents abroad on a mission to 
redeem themselves of “sins” they hadn’t even committed in their quest 
for something closer to free.<br>
<br>
Bruce and Clarence acted out their drama, which is our drama, in the 
exact same spirit as Twain, and with the exact same ambiguous result. At
 the end of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain was stuck because he had no 
ending. The ending he used is preposterous, obviously. But not because 
it’s over-reliant on the hand of God. The real problem is that it’s 
predicated on a false idea: Freeing one slave. You cannot free one 
slave, and since the slave owner is in the same prison as the slave, 
just like any other jailer, you can’t free two either. It’s all of us or
 none of us.<br>
<br>
But the road to freedom, as a great song tells us, is a constant 
struggle, and whatever anybody else thinks, I know–I have witnessed it 
as fact–nobody in the history of that great race-mixing tempest we call 
rock and soul music, struggled longer, harder or more continuously to 
reach that promised land. A Bruce Springsteen show could not in fact 
slide on its knees all the way across Jordan, but it was determined to 
take every inch that had ever been given and then push further, if only a
 millimeter or even if rebuffed.<br>
<br>
You could argue that Bruce and Clarence failed because they had no black
 audience to speak of (the idea that they had no black audience at all 
is a lie). But what need did the great majority of black people have to 
hear their story? (And why, for that matter, were most black listeners 
supposed to tolerate it being told in what, for their community, is an 
antique and discarded beat?). White Americans have the very strange 
habit of believing that racism and white supremacy and all that come 
with them are somehow problems for the black community to solve. This is
 absurd. Black people didn’t enslave white people and force them to come
 to America, and whip them and sell them, rape them and suck the life 
from them for profit. How could black people, then, end the consequences
 of those crimes? Black people did not portray whites as stupid, 
sinister, conniving, debased and debauched, thieving and rapacious, even
 though they’d have been able to marshal far more facts with far less 
fudging than whites have needed to spread such calumnies about them.<br>
<br>
What I am saying is, America’s race problem has never been solved 
because white people refuse to recognize that it is only action on their
 part that can solve it. And Bruce Springsteen and Clarence Clemons did 
not find a blacker audience because on the one hand, the anomaly of 
their enactment of the dilemma and its consequences, if not solutions, 
did not need to be impressed upon the black community. On the other 
hand, white people desperately require that story, even though when most
 witnessed that Pentecost on Thunder Road, which concludes with Scooter 
and the Big Man slipping each other a kiss right on the lips, they did 
not take away from it anything at all of what it was meant to mean.<br>
<br>
Bruce and Clarence persevered, continually sending out their message 
over Radio Nowhere in case somebody, somewhere even might be listening. 
The real miracle is not that Bruce Springsteen was capable of finding so
 many  variants of this theme, from the stage show itself to anthems 
like “Land of Hope and Dreams” and “American Skin (41 Shots),”  and 
allusions peppered through his other songs. (How dumb would you have to 
be not to understand that this is one implication of, to choose the most
 obvious for instance, “Darkness on the Edge of Town”?) No miracle 
there—Springsteen set out to write about the heart of the country, and 
race was central to what he found there. In order to do an honest job as
 honest as he could, he had no choice but to tell the truth about who 
shackled whom, who has the key and what that key consists of.<br>
<br>
The miracle was that Clarence Clemons, for all his affectations and 
clowning, playing for the most part accents and fills, found a way to 
portray a character not only of massive physical bulk but as massively 
stalwart, courageous, and dignified as the black part of this nation has
 always been. (If you doubt this, ask yourself how long you would be 
able to hold your community together if it were nightly vilified on 
television, erased from history where its story could not be falsified 
altogether, and beaten down by the cops and the other authorities as a 
matter of principle, while not even being granted its own name, instead 
referred to by a batch of code words as puerile as they are vicious.) 
Like Bert Williams and Louis Armstrong and a handful of others who 
crossed over not Jordan but simply the color line, Clarence held himself
 together at a cost that no white American, not even someone who studied
 him for decades and saw what the game was from the first encounter,  
can pretend to fairly estimate.<br>
<br>
There were, of course, several versions of Clarence Clemons but if we 
stick simply to the artist, the musician-thespian, the most obvious 
other is the Clarence Clemons of his solo records, with the Red Bank 
Rockers and Temple of Soul. This music, readily available even now, 
though it never sold much, harkens back to a version of the soul music 
Springsteen so often draws upon, but also to the honking R&amp;B music 
of the Big Man’s own youth. In that music, the guitar stayed in the 
rhythm section and the sax took instrumental center stage. Clarence was 
almost ten years older than the rest of the E Street Band and here, he 
let it show.<br>
<br>
There is other, less well-known, harder to find Clarence Clemons music 
on which he portrays another version altogether, a seeker, a  world 
traveler, influenced by the new age music of Narada Michael Walden (who 
produced and wrote Clarence’s one hit single, “You’re a Friend of Mine,”
 a duet with Jackson Browne), and by the time he spent in China wooing 
his fourth wife.<br>
<br>
I mention this not only to emphasize that Clarence Clemons was a man, 
not a mythic figure—or rather, not only a mythic figure—but also to 
point out what sacrifices he made, what impulses he did not indulge, 
what roads this man so committed to doing exactly what he wanted to do 
chose not to travel. I am not crazy enough to make him out a martyr—he 
was too hedonist for martyrdom. But it cannot have been much fun to 
travel through America in the mid-‘70s, the wounds of the civil rights 
movement yet so raw and its mission even now unaccomplished in so many 
places, as the only black man traveling with a group of white 
hippies—and he, quite often, dressed to the nines, as if he were the 
impresario running the whole show. As Bruce said in his eulogy, there 
were times when not even Clarence was big enough to shoulder past all 
the confusion and contradiction of race bigotry, and, once David 
Sancious left, which was not very long into the story, do it alone. <br>
<br>
The other side of that is, being treated as the safe, harmless, “why 
can’t they all be like this” black man. I loved Clarence, he paid me any
 number of small kindnesses over they years, mainly just always being 
glad to see me, but the idea that he was harmless is an absurdity, an 
insult and a symptom. Like any large orbiting object, Clarence had a 
powerful gravitational pull and while nobody who got caught up in it was
 endangered the way the ones who got pulled into the Keith Richards 
circle were, it was easy to see from whatever safe distance one could 
manage that the games inside Clarence’s circle were played on his terms,
 or not played at all. I mean, this is a guy who produced an 
autobiography that was admittedly half-fiction and lied so much of the 
rest of the time that even his bandmates weren’t sure where the truth 
lay in some of it. (Big Man: Real Life &amp; Tall Tales also happens to 
be one of the greatest rock’n’roll books ever written and possibly the 
funniest.) They can’t all be like that because you don’t know what even 
that one guy is altogether like. Which doesn’t mean that the role he 
played on stage was just an act, either. Is complicated safe and 
harmless? I don’t think so either.<br>
<br>
So…there they are, Scooter and the Big Man, the Boss and the King of the
 World, little Bruce and towering Clarence, and for all those years, 
through all those shows, through all that time, they did one thing, as 
static and yet as ever-evolving as Krazy Kat albeit with a larger cast. 
Bruce tried a couple of other foils—Crystal Taliferro on the Human Touch
 / Luckytown tour, the huge Art Baron and the small Larry Eagle with the
 Seeger Sessions band. But in the end, if there was one thing that made 
the E Street Band the most essential tool of the greatest live 
entertainer white America has ever produced it was the gravitational 
pull between him and Clarence Clemons. <br>
<br>
Curtis Mayfield, one of Bruce’s greatest unacknowledged influences  
wrote a prophecy in one of his songs that applied to the Scooter and the
 Big Man tableau: ‘Mighty, Mighty Spade And Whitey / Your black and 
white power / Is gonna be a crumbling tower.” That was not a prophecy of
 them but of what they fought against.<br>
<br>
Bruce and Clarence could not pull down the tower in which America is 
shackled, no two humans could do that, but they inflicted their share of
 damage and from the places I’ve sat and stood and watched them do it, 
their effort, properly understood, had something of grandeur about it. 
They were these two guys who imagined that if they acted free, then 
other people would understand better that it was possible to be free. 
How close they came is harder to see than how far the rest of us are 
from that goal. But there are hearts and minds a few steps closer to 
liberation out there because of them, people who had fun until it 
stopped being just fun and grew inside them.<br>
<br>
One of the other roles Clarence Clemons played for Bruce Springsteen is 
also not much remarked upon but it was crucial. When Bruce ran out of 
words—or more precisely, when the words could no longer tell the 
story—often as not it was the Big Man and that shining brass horn that 
took center stage and blew out the rest of the truth for us to hear. If 
you want to measure Clarence Clemons as a musician, consider what it 
must have been like to have to find a solo that could stand up after 
lines like “And the poets down here don’t write nothin’ at all / They 
just stand back and let it all be.” Then consider that, even if it took 
16 hours in the studio, he found it.<br>
<br>
During a concert, during one of Clarence’s solos, if you happened to 
look away from the horn and the giant blowing it for a minute, you’d see
 Bruce standing at center stage, chest thrust out, mic dangling from his
 hand, jaw jutting, in command and serene in the confidence that his 
story was being told, and told again anew, sending light not just into 
the darkness but out against it, too.<br>
<br>
I am sure he will find other vehicles—he always has had a few, including
 his own fingers speaking through his guitar. But it will never be quite
 the same, cannot be. Because on that dark and stormy night on the 
boardwalk, when the door blew open in that little barroom where the band
 was playing and the Biggest Man in the World stepped through it, the 
force behind it was not merely the wind but also fate. And not their 
fate alone but also ours.<br>
<br>
In this respect, it is not only Bruce Springsteen’s job to find a way to
 replace what Clarence Clemons meant, it is also yours and mine. It’s 
all of us or none of us and the cost is high. At the end of his eulogy 
on Tuesday, Bruce said that he and Clarence enacted a beautiful anomaly 
of two people who loved each other so much that race absolutely didn’t 
matter. He also said he thought they might need to be together in 
another lifetime to finish the job of making sure that their 
relationship was not an anomaly. But really, those lifetimes ought to be
 right here, right now—they ought to be our lives.<br>
<br>
Farewell, Big Man, see you in the land of hope and dreams. Thanks for helping drag us there.</div>

"Springsteen steps out of the Darkness"<br>
By Shane Hegarty<br>
<br>
In Toronto for the premiere of a documentary about the career-defining 
album that could so easily have been his last, a youthful 61-year-old 
Bruce Springsteen talks about retracing his steps to a creative fork in 
the road<br>
<br>
AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT on a calm street in downtown Toronto. Bruce 
Springsteen sits on the inside of a long table, his back to the wall, 
the focus of such attention from the group lunching with him, who are 
leaning in towards him, that it would be understandable if the singer 
asked everyone to just back off a bit. He doesn’t. He talks on, answers 
every question and indulges those trying to hog the encounter, while 
making sure to address those at its edges. The cluster of record 
executives and journalists are all male, except for a Japanese woman 
whose colleagues manoeuvre her so that she’s directly to Springsteen’s 
right. Thereafter she sports the stunned grin of the starstruck.<br>
<br>
It’s a popular look among those around the table. A waiter stops 
mid-service to earwig and is still there 15 minutes later. Already, 
Springsteen’s wife and E Street Band member, Patti Scialfa, has 
volunteered to be squeezed from the table: “I’m going to move out to let
 you guys get closer to him.” She does it with the generosity of someone
 who knows that some of us are in the thick of fulfilling a lifetime 
ambition. I won’t pretend I’m not among them.<br>
<br>
That Springsteen has joined us is something of a surprise. He is in town
 because of Toronto International Film Festival and the premiere of a 
documentary about the making of Darkness on the Edge of Town, which 
itself comes in advance of The Promise , a box set comprising an album 
of other songs recorded for that session, plus new and old live footage 
and the documentary. That year-long Darkness session, 32 years ago, off 
the back of a legal battle with his first manager, spawned dozens of 
songs. Some were half-finished, others dropped just as they were done, 
so that what Springsteen calls the “10 toughest songs” remained – 
including the title track, Badlands , The Promised Land, Racing in the 
Street, Factory, Streets of Fire – hewn from a session that drove the E 
Street Band “a good deal insane”.<br>
<br>
Springsteen spent weeks alone just trying to get “the drums to sound 
like drums”, as the documentary explains. While sonically sparse 
compared with the previous Born to Run , Darkness on the Edge of Town is
 an epic of American landscape, dispossession and resilience born out of
 a “huge amount of ego, ambition and hunger”. He wanted to write 
something truly great. It wasn’t greeted too keenly by much of the 
press. It didn’t sell too much at first either. Then he toured it. “When
 they saw it live, then they got it,” he says. Today it is a classic.<br>
<br>
When he was recording it he was doing so with the intensity of a 
musician who didn’t know if he’d get another chance to make an album 
once this one came out. At a time when a three-year gap between albums 
was career suicide he read “where are they now?” pieces about himself.<br>
<br>
“We were dead,” he says, with a certain relish. “They just wanted to 
know if it was real or if it had been a construction.” So he focused on 
writing “the most important album we could, the biggest thing ever”. 
When Darkness was released Dave Marsh, in Rolling Stone , declared it an
 album that would change the way people listened to rock. In The Irish 
Times , Joe Breen said it confirmed him as “the most important 
songwriter in rock” – but not all reviews were so positive. “It wasn’t 
Born to Run 2, so they didn’t get it,” says Springsteen. Then he took it
 on the road. “In one town,” he says, “this kid comes up to me and says,
 ‘Hey, Bruce, my friends say it’s not as good as Born to Run , but I 
think it’s okay.’ ”<br>
<br>
Earlier in the day about 40 of us gathered in an old cinema where some 
of the “lost” tracks and concert footage were introduced by his manager,
 Jon Landau, whose 1974 quote “I saw rock’n’roll future, and its name is
 Bruce Springsteen” we are at this point obliged to reference. Verses 
appeared on the large screen in time with the songs. The first track was
 not one that had been lost as such but a version of Racing in the 
Street that was so lush it was like hearing it for the first time. When 
it faded out someone behind me gasped quietly. They’re record 
executives, of course. They’re paid to gasp. But, hell, through surround
 sound, with Panavision lyrics, in the soft hush of the cinema, it was 
goosebump stuff.<br>
<br>
Seven more tracks were played, revealing a range of songs, with a more 
pronounced interest in love and relationships than present on the 
original album. There are some live clips from the DVD element of the 
box set, including a live recording of Darkness , in correct order, 
during which Springsteen is in full flight, neck straining, teeth 
gritted, making no concession to the fact that it is being recorded in 
an empty theatre.<br>
<br>
After this Landau returns to his mic in the corner of the room. A 
spotlight struggles to keep up with him. He thanks a few of the people 
involved. Then he thanks Springsteen. He is sitting at the back of the 
theatre. The man behind me gasps again.<br>
<br>
Springsteen gives a modest wave. He gets a standing ovation.<br>
<br>
Twenty minutes later Springsteen and the cloud of people that gathers 
around him have been ushered from the venue for a restaurant next door. 
Small groups are brought to his table intermittently. Our turn comes, 
and we move up, glasses of wine where autograph books might be. It is 
just after the starters, and we spend the rest of the meal with him. For
 the journalists in the group it is a strange set-up: not an interview 
but not off the record. Throwing a Dictaphone on the table would change 
the dynamic.<br>
<br>
He talks about survival, success, his memories of whichever country 
someone wants him to talk about. He talks about the way modern culture 
expects you to be ubiquitous. “They think I’m a recluse, that I never do
 any interviews,” he says. “I do interviews all the time. I think I’m 
pretty accessible. But if you’re not always out there, they think you’re
 Garbo.”<br>
<br>
His presence in Toronto has been the focus of media coverage during the 
week. At a festival that cultivates queues regardless, the one for a 
Q&amp;A with the actor Ed Norton began the night before. At that event, 
his voice a low rumble to Norton’s halting helium, he had talked mostly 
about Darkness on the Edge of Town , his “angry” record, informed 
primarily by his wish to write about his parents’ generation and their 
struggle to match the promise of the US with its reality – “honouring my
 parents and their history and the people I knew: these things weren’t 
being written about” – and to reflect the post-Vietnam era and his 
country’s loss of innocence.<br>
<br>
Artistically, it was influenced by the attitude of the punk movement, by
 movies such as Mean Streets and by Springsteen’s travels across the US,
 which took him out of New Jersey for the first time and sent him into 
an epic landscape that can be heard on the album. But most of all it was
 about reclaiming something of himself, post-fame. “I had my first taste
 of success, and I think you realise it’s possible for your identity to 
get co-opted,” he says. “When you have some success you have a variety 
of choices. I looked at some of the maps the people before me had drawn.
 ‘Here there be dragons!’ And the world was flat to them, and they fell 
off the edge. And that was something I’d rather not do. And part of that
 was keeping a sense of myself.”<br>
<br>
He became “a mutant in your neighbourhood”. “I decided that the key to 
that was maintaining a sense of myself, understanding that a part of 
myself had been mutated . . . There was a thrust of self-preservation 
more than anything else.”<br>
<br>
In the restaurant it is palpable how much he has built an inner circle, 
and fortified it over decades: Landau and co-manager Barbara Carr; the 
same record company; the core of The E Street Band has remained largely 
unchanged since the early days. He talks about this unit, how the 
film-maker Thom Zimny has become part of a crew that “go beyond 
committed” and a band who have to stay so in order to fulfil the stated 
mission.<br>
<br>
In a politically polarised US he is now as big – probably bigger – 
outside his home country. Even among the committed, the reaction in the 
US doesn’t quite match that he receives in Scandinavia, Italy, Spain and
 Ireland. Landau had said it earlier, Scialfa backs it up over lunch, 
and Springsteen adds to it. “They just bring such a passion with them, 
and you feed off that,” he says, but without the emptiness that usually 
comes from praising one or other country’s audience.<br>
<br>
Seven years ago he played a single show at the RDS. Over 2008 and 2009 
he played five. I wonder if there was a cementing of that relationship 
during the Seeger Sessions tour in 2006, when the folk-heavy music was 
appreciated here on a level not matched elsewhere. “No,” he says, “it 
was on Devils Dust . I came and played the Point, and I thought I’d love
 to just do 10 of these shows. There was an intensity about that show 
that was powerful.” There was indeed, aided by the fact that it was 
raining so hard that the drumming on the roof offered an atmospheric 
duet during what was a solo performance.<br>
<br>
The audience intensity is, though, a response to his own commitment on 
stage. He has toured relentlessly in recent years – 11 shows in Ireland 
alone since 2005 – and last time around he was playing almost three 
hours of bone-shaking brilliance without even the pretence of walking 
off for an encore. “You have to want to do it,” he says. “Also, you have
 to show, not tell. That’s why they call it show business. It’s not the 
‘tell business’, it’s ‘show’ business’ ”<br>
<br>
He talks about Sting once telling him, “You work too hard”, then later 
adding: “Oh, I get it, this is the only way you know how to do it.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s drive has to be matched by the band’s, and he will not 
allow it to flag. “I would put any of our shows now alongside anything 
we did 30 years ago,” he says. “I want it to be that if your brother 
comes to see this, he won’t have seen us play better. If your father 
comes, he won’t have seen us play better. If you’re grandfather comes, 
he won’t have seen us play better.”<br>
<br>
Since the turn of the decade he has become fascinated by his own past 
and is keen to catalogue it. “I’ve become interested in the history of 
the band, in putting it together,” he says. “For a long time I was u 
ncomfortable about filming, but about 10 years ago we decided to film 
everything. And this is about putting things together for all of those 
who are new to us, who have come to our shows and started listening to 
us but who weren’t even born when Darkness first came out.”<br>
<br>
Two years ago Born to Run received the box-set treatment, but what makes
 Springsteen so vital is that he has not turned to the past in the need 
to remind the world of his relevance. In his producer Brendan O’Brien he
 has found a steady hand on recent albums, but the core has been 
Springsteen’s creative purple patch.<br>
<br>
His most recent album, last year’s Working on a Dream , was in some ways
 a sigh of contentment after previous albums that were politically 
charged ( Magic, The Seeger Sessions ), intimate ( Devils Dust ) or 
spanning both personal and public grief and resilience ( The Rising ). 
Although even Working on a Dream was an exhalation of relief, following 
Barack Obama’s election.<br>
<br>
His music, he says, has always been a search for what he calls the 
“essential”, that element that gets to the core of everyone’s 
experience, “that essential thing that matters to me, that matters to 
him, that matters to you”. He has stuck with Martin Scorsese’s line 
about getting an audience “to care about your obsessions”.<br>
<br>
Darkness was the beginning of what he calls the “long narrative” of his 
songwriting, a story he began to tell with it and which he has committed
 himself to carrying through everything since.<br>
<br>
The night before, he had told Ed Norton that he always understood this 
necessity. “I said there’s other guys who play guitar well, there’s 
other guys who front really well, there’s other rocking bands out there.
 But the writing and the imagining of a world, that’s a particular 
thing, you know. That’s a single fingerprint. All the film-makers we 
love, all the writers we love, all the songwriters we love, they put 
their fingerprint on your imagination, in your heart. And on your soul. 
That was something that I felt touched by, and I thought, well, I wanted
 to do that.”<br>
<br>
It has meant that his themes have been not just political or societal 
but very personal. He writes, after all, about ageing in a way that few 
other artists are brave enough to do. There has to be a commitment to 
that, he says. He must be unflinching, must not shy away from saying 
that people change and age, and that you have to deal with it. “Write 
about it,” he says. “Don’t be scared of it.”<br>
<br>
When recording the Darkness live set he demanded that the decades be on 
stark display. He found a way in an unlikely source. “I saw this 
Jean-Claude Van Damme movie. I don’t know if you’ve seen it: it’s called
 JCVD , and he plays himself in it and gets caught up in a bank robbery.
 But it’s filmed in this washed-out way, very grey, and it really shows 
his age. And I said to Thom, that’s what I want for this recording.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen turned 61 on Thursday. He is tanned, fresh; even the crow’s 
feet are taut. His hair is dark enough that you wonder if it might be 
dyed, but grey splashes about his ears. He has an enthusiasm that seems 
to bubble through from his 27-year-old self, a wick of youthfulness that
 burns through.<br>
<br>
It becomes clear that, over the course of a couple of days, Springsteen 
has returned more than once to the notion of survival, of Darkness being
 recorded with an intensity born of an understanding that this could 
have been the last album he recorded. Stunted by the legal wrangle with 
his manager, Springsteen had to survive on live shows and the reputation
 of Born to Run . That album had made him a global star and was the 
thing that put him on the cover of Time and Newsweek in the same week in
 1975. In a sense, it had the power to kill him too.<br>
<br>
From this perspective Darkness is integral to the flow of his career, 
but from his own viewpoint at the time it could have been the end. He 
expresses deep pride at the result, how it sounded then, how it sounds 
now. But it is also becomes clear that his open excitement is from a 
keen appreciation that he is not just revisiting an album, a session, 
some old video footage, that this is not merely a holiday with 
nostalgia, but that he is revisiting a fork in the road with the 
satisfaction of knowing that his younger self chose the right path.<br>
<br>
The lunch ends. Springsteen’s meal has been half-eaten, accompanied by a
 largely untouched glass of orange juice. He has to be encouraged to 
leave for his flight.<br>
<br>
Ten minutes later a photograph is posted on Twitter by someone who lives
 by the restaurant. It is of Springsteen, in check shirt, jeans and 
sunglasses, with a huge grin, sitting on a motorbike on the street, 
posing with a fan. It is making someone’s day. You’d be hard pressed to 
tell whose.</div>
