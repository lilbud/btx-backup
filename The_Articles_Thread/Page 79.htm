Deliver me from nowhere<br>
<br>
In his own words, there’s a lot more to the story of The Boss than cars and girls. <br>
<br>
By Keith Cameron.<br>
<br>
In 1973, touring to support Bruce Springsteen’s debut album, each E 
Street Band member took a turn driving ‘Mad Dog’ Vini Lopez’s wagon – 
everyone except The Boss. “My style behind the wheel was considered 
inept and reckless endangerment.” One of the more ironic truths revealed
 in this superb memoir is that America’s automotive poet laureate was 
such a lousy driver he didn’t hold a licence until his mid twenties. So 
much for “racing in the streets”. As the author himself admits: “I know 
I’m good but I’m also a poser… ‘Authenticity’ would be what you made of 
it, a hall of mirrors. Put on the work shirt, young man. No big deal.”<br>
<br>
Work, of course, is the quality that defines Bruce Springsteen. It’s 
through sheer effort that he became so good at the other stuff – 
songwriting and performing. During his pre-fame scrabbles he got tagged 
‘the new Dylan’, but Springsteen himself knew better. At the end of a 
hair-raisingly entertaining account of his early band Steel Mill’s 
unsuccessful 1970 trip to California, a realisation dawned: “I was not a
 natural genius. I would have to use every ounce of what was in me… to 
push myself harder, to work with more intensity than the next guy just 
to survive.”<br>
<br>
At 500 unghosted pages, his autobiography is just another example of 
this maniacal commitment. Born To Run reads how the perfect Springsteen 
show or album might flow: meticulous existential analysis and ripping 
yarns, grit mixed with cheese. Aside from a brief initial showiness, his
 prose is lyrical yet pointed, at its best resembling a gentler Nelson 
Algren, all seasoned with humour (often surprisingly ribald).<br>
<br>
We realise his rigour is a by-product of psychotherapy for depression, 
which began in late 1982 following what reads like a breakdown. 
Springsteen acknowledges he could barely function beyond the stage or 
the studio. Confessing to briefly enjoying “the sexual perks of 
superstardom” circa Born In The USA, this “generally serial monogamist” 
was incapable of sustaining a relationship beyond three years. His first
 marriage, to actress Julianne Phillips, crashed just short of that 
buffer (“I was still emotionally stunted”).<br>
<br>
Thanks to a deeply evocative portrayal of his early years, the diagnosis
 is clear: the family home in working-class Freehold, New Jersey was a 
psychic warzone between ebullient mother Adele and misanthropic father 
Doug, whose mental illness profoundly haunted Bruce. These conflicting 
influences rendered him “a conceptual optimist yet a personal 
pessimist”. His salvation was Patti Scialfa, the Jersey girl who gave as
 good as she got, then parenthood – yet for all the personal and 
material nourishment he enjoys today, the black dog still bites. He’s 
taken antidepressants for the past 15 years; his sixties have been “a 
rough, rough ride”.<br>
<br>
Named after the song which first detonated him into mass consciousness, 
this is hard-wrought, beautifully delivered testimony to the realisation
 its author had upon that initial burst of celebrity: running is all 
very well, but you need to have somewhere to go. That’s when the hard 
graft starts, and perhaps never really stops if you’re Bruce 
Springsteen, still a work in progress, still tougher than the rest.</div>

True Bruce: Springsteen Goes Deep, From Early Trauma to Future of E Street<br>
Rocker opens up about his life, expanding on revelations in candid new memoir 'Born to Run'<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen goes deep on the revelations in his new memoir 'Born 
to Run' – from his childhood trauma to the future of E Street.<br>
<br>
By Brian Hiatt</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Enter Bruce Springsteen, whistling. He's cradling a couple of leather 
jackets for a photo shoot and looks a touch tired, probably because he 
was just on a stadium stage outside Boston 36 hours ago, wrapping up the
 last in a series of four-hour-plus concerts with the E Street Band. A 
week before his 67th birthday, Springsteen is back on his farm in New 
Jersey's Monmouth County, on a cloudless mid-September afternoon lovely 
enough to justify allegiance to his oft-maligned home state. He has a 
gray shadow of a goatee, and is dressed as you'd expect him to be 
dressed: black T-shirt, slightly stretched at the neck; dark jeans; 
boots.<br>
<br>
He's just trekked over from his actual home to his home studio, housed 
in a garagelike structure made of pristine blond-on-blond wood. It is, 
overall, a long way from the four-track cassette machine he used to 
record Nebraska.<br>
<br>
The main lounge is filled with memorabilia, most of it devoted to Elvis 
Presley or Springsteen himself (the couch has a Greetings From Asbury 
Park pillow, and there are Bruce-and-Clarence outtakes from the Born to 
Run photo shoot on the wall). The room is overflowing with books, many 
of them music-themed, from Chuck Berry's autobiography to Gerri 
Hirshey's soul history Nowhere to Run to When We Were Good, a study of 
the Sixties folk revival.<br>
<br>
Springsteen just wrote a perfect addition to this collection: his lucid,
 earthy, anecdote-stuffed autobiography, Born to Run. Along with rock 
&amp; roll tales (no drugs, some sex, precisely one smashed guitar), it 
offers a psychological recipe for the creation of a self-flagellating 
superstar: overly worshipful grandmother; withholding dad who turns out 
to have been mentally ill rather than just a hard-hat hardass; 
indefatigable mom who adheres to an "ain't no sin to be glad you're 
alive" ethos.<br>
<br>
In a sunny sitting room where windows overlook the green sprawl of his 
property, Springsteen discusses the genesis of the book, his struggles 
with depression, the future of his career and much more, staying silent 
on only one topic. When I mention my horror at the sight of Donald 
Trump–endorsing New Jersey governor Chris Christie pumping his fist and 
singing along to the lines "poor man wanna be rich, rich man wanna be 
king" at a recent concert in Brooklyn, Springsteen laughs until he turns
 red. When he catches his breath, he says, "I have no comment."<br>
<br>
So why do an autobiography?<br>
<br>
It kind of happened by accident. I didn't think of it initially as a 
book. I was writing to pass the time, and I felt if I didn't do anything
 with it, maybe my kids would like to have it. I wrote quite a bit for 
about two or three weeks. When I went back and read it, I said, "This 
feels pretty good." I'd write longhand in some notepads, and then I'd 
put it away for months. I'd dictate it to Mary Mac, my assistant, and 
then rewrite it until it felt nice and tight and concise. It just became
 a project I was working on. When we'd tour, I'd put it away for the 
entire tour, a year and a half. When I finished what became the first of
 the three sections, I said, "Well, there's a tale going on there that 
might be interesting to people."<br>
<br>
So you wrote it in chronological order?<br>
<br>
I did. I let the third section sit for quite a while. It's the most 
difficult one, because you're writing about your current life and the 
people that are currently in your life. There's just a lot of different 
kinds of judgments to make.<br>
<br>
You didn't hesitate to put in facts of your life that were 
halo-puncturing. Did you want to shatter your aura of saintliness a 
little?<br>
<br>
Yeah, that part of my thing has always annoyed me. It's too much, you 
know. So any dent in it I can make, I'm pleased to do. I mean, it wasn't
 something I was intent on doing. It was just writing about a life, and 
all of its many aspects. But I also decided that it was a book about my 
music first, and about my life kind of secondarily. If I didn't want to 
write about something, I didn't write about it. I didn't have any rules,
 except I wanted what was in the book to relate back to my music. So the
 revelations I made about my family or my own inner workings, I felt 
that could be central to understanding where some of my music came from.
 I didn't write all about myself. Plenty of things, I held back.<br>
<br>
At a 1990 concert, a guy shouted, "We love you!" And you said, "But you 
don't really know me!" Does this book get us closer to really knowing 
you?<br>
<br>
You know, I would say so. But once again, it's a creation. It's a story 
that I drew from my story. It's one of the stories I drew from my story.<br>
<br>
You use the word "misogyny" to describe your attitudes toward women as a young man. That's a striking self-evaluation.<br>
You have to wear the shoe that fits. I was an internal rager. So I had 
to look back at some of my attitudes when I was young, and that's the 
only way I can describe it.<br>
<br>
What do you know about women now that you didn't understand then?<br>
<br>
[Laughs] What do I know about women that I didn't understand when I was a
 young man? Oh, Jesus [laughs, pauses]. When Mama is happy, everybody is
 happy. When Mama ain't happy, nobody is happy.<br>
<br>
Did you give anyone in your life veto power over the final section of the book? Patti [Scialfa], particularly?<br>
<br>
I did have to open up parts of our life. She's an artist, she 
understands that part of our job. But it was still a really strong and 
generous thing on her part that I'm deeply thankful for. To go back to 
the question you asked – what I do know about women, I have learned from
 Patti. It was knowledge that I was searching for, and she came into my 
life and just provided me with an enormous amount of vision and love and
 security that I never had previously. She's the love of my life.<br>
<br>
There have been other books written about you. What do you think of them?<br>
<br>
I haven't followed them that closely. I mean, I read Dave Marsh's book 
[Born to Run] a long time ago, in the Seventies. And Peter Ames Carlin's
 book [Bruce] that came out recently. They're all good, if you're 
interested in different sides of me and different parts of my story.<br>
<br>
I thought it was sort of hilarious that you name-drop your first manager
 Mike Appel's book, Down Thunder Road, which is pretty negative.<br>
<br>
I mean, if you're interested in that, that's there too. I don't have a problem with all the different portrayals of me.<br>
<br>
I looked at that book again. There's a caption, "Bruce in 1989. Too old to rock."<br>
<br>
[Laughs] I love that.<br>
<br>
You used to say onstage that your mom wanted you to be an author. True?<br>
<br>
Yes. She did when I was young.<br>
<br>
Your talents weren't recognized in school, so what did she see in you that suggested that direction?<br>
<br>
I did start to write the songs when I was very young. I was 15 and I was
 already scribbling some things down, and I suppose to her it was a 
respectable way to be a writer of some sort. I happened to be good at 
it. While I wasn't very good at much else in school, in my 
creative-writing classes or when we had to do some writing in my English
 classes, I tended to do better at it.<br>
<br>
You've had what seems like a pretty serious and rigorous self-education. How did that work for you?<br>
<br>
It came very naturally. I never set out to hit the books or anything. I 
was always curious, but I was too young in school to take advantage of 
it, and things were presented a little dryly. When I met Jon [Landau], 
he was a conduit into film and books, and I started to read things that 
touched my soul. A lot of them were by noir writers – James M. Cain, Jim
 Thompson, Flannery O'Connor. And then I started to read history books. I
 was curious about the big story. I read Howard Zinn's A People's 
History of the United States and one by Henry Steele Commager [A Pocket 
History of the United States]. One thing led to another, and I became 
quite a self-educator.<br>
These days, I actually find myself more missing college. I missed the 
chance to live in the world of ideas when I would've been ripe to take 
advantage of it. A few years ago, my friend Robert Coles had a class at 
Harvard about Walker Percy, and I sat in. It was fun and I felt very at 
home. Made me wish I went to college!<br>
<br>
What writers shaped the voice you found for the book?<br>
<br>
Everything I've absorbed led to finding a voice I was comfortable with. I
 love all the Elmore Leonard books, for instance. But you can't copy it 
if you're trying to do something original.<br>
<br>
Your paternal grandparents loom large in your story, but you wrote just 
one, never-released song about them – "Randolph Street (Master of 
Electricity)."<br>
<br>
That was it. I probably don't think the song was very good. But it did 
capture some of the intensity I felt about them. It didn't enter my mind
 to write other songs about it, and I work from the inside out. I don't 
take a topic and decide to write about it. I write about what grows out 
of me.<br>
<br>
You've said that Nebraska connected back to your childhood in some spiritual and emotional way.<br>
<br>
I would say that it did. If you were looking for a record that connected
 to my grandparents, that's the record. It's just setting the tone of 
the time in our household.<br>
<br>
Did the emotions stirred up by Nebraska open the door to the depression that hit right after you made it?<br>
<br>
It could be. I was 32 at the time. I had just finished Nebraska, 
literally. I don't think it was out yet. And that was a pretty lonely 
record. It may have struck home. But my own biological clock may have 
been ticking toward that point. You carry your baggage, and if you don't
 start unpacking, your bags get heavier as you move along. So at some 
point, the weight becomes impossible to carry and you look for some way 
to unpack those bags. And it can get pretty messy. That's what happened 
to me.<br>
<br>
Where do you see the depressive side of your nature in your songs?<br>
<br>
In my songs? Every other record, probably [laughs]. And obviously, you 
look at The Ghost of Tom Joad and Nebraska and there's plenty of it in 
Tunnel of Love. I address it on Tunnel of Love, in the song "Two Faces."
 It's something I addressed as I've gone along by seesawing between what
 might be considered band records and what might be considered solo 
records. If you go to Darkness on the Edge of Town, there's plenty of it
 there.<br>
<br>
The other side of it is that the dark material helps us believe the lighter stuff.<br>
<br>
That was part of making a good song. You got to have friction and 
tension, something to push up against. Every writer needs that. I think 
it was Tom Stoppard who once said he envied Václav Havel.<br>
<br>
Right, talk about something to push up against.<br>
<br>
So if the triumphant part of the song was going to feel real and not 
just hacked out, I had to have something I was pushing up against. I 
just understood that balance. It comes out of gospel music, which is the
 music of transcendence. I wanted my music to be a music of 
transcendence.<br>
<br>
When you sing, "I believe in the faith that can save me," maybe we 
believe you because it feels like it's coming from someone who might not
 have believed it the day before.<br>
<br>
Yeah! Or maybe barely believing right now, you know?<br>
<br>
Interestingly, one of the only concerts that you describe in detail in 
the book is the overhyped Hammersmith Odeon show that was so rough for 
you in 1975, your first trip to England.<br>
<br>
Something heavy to push up against. It was a nightmare of a mind-fuck, 
so it remained with me for a long time. These days, I think you go 
onstage with a lot of confidence, because you've had so many years 
behind you. And I tend to try to move to that place every night, to that
 moment where suddenly it's just you and the audience; everything else 
has kind of fallen away, time, space. Some nights it's easier than other
 nights. But I pretty much always get there. You're just in this very 
kind of lovely place where you're really communicating. But it's always 
something you have to do on a nightly basis. Even after all the years, 
you still have to.<br>
<br>
You talk about being able to control time onstage. How does that work for you?<br>
<br>
You're doing a lot of things. You're compressing time in your music. 
You're compressing years into moments, an enormous amount of experience 
into just a few minutes. You're shifting between youth and maturity, so 
time gets warped and flipped around a lot during the evening. People are
 going back and forth in their lives. Time ceases inside of any creative
 piece. It creates its own time and space.<br>
<br>
The depression you write about suffering in your early sixties, how did it affect your working life?<br>
<br>
Not very much. I couldn't give you an answer to why that is. But I'd be 
way out on a limb and then I'd come into the studio and I'd just go to 
work. I'd write, record.<br>
<br>
How often have you toured while you were in that state?<br>
<br>
I had it come up on tours on occasion. And generally, it doesn't affect 
me onstage or the choices I make, but it may affect me offstage a little
 bit. I may feel down or confused at a certain moment. It's very rare, 
because touring is so emotionally and physically cathartic. If you work 
yourself physically to the point of near exhaustion, you're too tired to
 be depressed, and that may be one of the reasons I've done it my whole 
life. Your mind is not on overdrive – it doesn't have the energy to 
start looking for trouble in the weeds. Instead it's a very 
mind-clearing, centering experience, and you don't have the kind of 
space that depression thrives in.<br>
<br>
You used to have an element of self-punishment in those long shows.<br>
<br>
I was a good Catholic boy. So there was an element of the purification ritual.<br>
<br>
But have you come around to where now you're doing the same thing from a healthier place?<br>
<br>
I'm not sure myself [laughs]. Why does a man play four hours a night? 
I'm still not exactly sure, you know. And I would have to say it still 
hearkens back to some of those original impulses and the fact that I 
need to go all the way, all the time.<br>
There's a passage where you describe dinner with your mom's family in terms that sound just like your concerts.<br>
There would often be a level of hysteria that perhaps is not uncommon in
 Italian families, and mine was certainly no different. People were 
shouting and yelling. But also, there was a tremendous amount of joy and
 this unusual excitement about life – over nothing, except living 
itself.<br>
<br>
You mention a dream where you say to your dad, "That guy onstage, that's how I see you." What does that mean?<br>
<br>
They say that those you can't get close to, you emulate. So I was 
basically a bum who never worked outside of scratching on my guitar. But
 when I went to work, I put on the clothes of my father and I slipped 
into his roles in a lot of ways, in order to be close to him, in order 
to understand him. I didn't realize this till much later. So that dream 
was just me trying to explain to my dad, "Look, this is where all this 
took us. This is where you took me, and it's how I see you in my heart 
of hearts."<br>
You chose to universalize your dad's story into something it wasn't. Was the reality too messy for a rock &amp; roll song?<br>
Perhaps. Or perhaps I was just influenced by East of Eden and those 
kinds of archetypes, and I cast the two of us in those roles. That's why
 in the book I say I was a little unfair to my dad, 'cause our lives 
were much more complex.<br>
<br>
You write that you were kind of traumatized by what was going on at home.<br>
<br>
It was enough to make me a nervous wreck and it wasn't just what my 
father was doing, either. It was the nature of my relationship with my 
grandparents, which was very intense, perhaps incredibly 
anxiety-provoking. I didn't have any release for it. So I just chewed my
 knuckles until they were rocks, or blinked uncontrollably.<br>
<br>
You describe yourself around the age of eight as a "sissy" and a "weirdo."<br>
<br>
Totally.<br>
<br>
How did you make the journey from there to being a very conventionally masculine rock star, especially in the Eighties?<br>
<br>
It was an obvious reaction, I think, to my childhood – and I look back 
on it and it appears one-dimensional. My dad, to me, was a very 
conventionally masculine man. He worked physically. He was a big and 
beefy kind of guy. And again, you emulate. I believe that's how I got 
there. But he himself had that dichotomy. I believe he was similar to me
 when he was young. He was soft inside. And in the Forties and Fifties, 
you couldn't survive like that. As a child, he hadn't been provided with
 the confidence to be himself, to be fully masculine, and I don't mean 
that in a one-dimensional or conventional sense. So I had to sort my way
 through all this stuff myself, and what did I use to do it? I used my 
music and did the best I could.<br>
<br>
What have you tried to teach your sons about what it means to be a man?<br>
<br>
I try to emphasize the softer side of myself, and that there's no need 
to feel ashamed of or misunderstand this part of yourself. Just as 
you've got to be comfortable with the other side.<br>
<br>
There were so many times you came close to total failure. Is there a 
universe where you went back to Jersey and were just the greatest 
bar-band leader anyone ever saw?<br>
<br>
You can be very, very good and miss. But do I personally envision a 
scenario where that could have happened? No [laughs]. Or maybe I just 
prefer not to. I was a lion in pursuit of the things that I needed. And 
as I traveled around, I don't see that many people that are better than 
me. I've seen some, you know. Now of course you were very isolated in 
New Jersey at that time. Sometimes some sort of B-level rock star 
passing through town catches your band and says, "Oh, man," but nothing 
happens.<br>
<br>
And sometimes they slept with your girlfriend, apparently.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately. That part is true too [laughs]. So I knew what it was like to miss.<br>
<br>
The song "Backstreets" seems to capture that time in your life. Where did that song come from?<br>
<br>
Just youth, the beach, the night, friendships, the feeling of being an 
outcast and kind of living far away from things in this little outpost 
in New Jersey. It's also about a place of personal refuge. It wasn't a 
specific relationship or anything that brought the song into being.<br>
<br>
You mentioned the election onstage the other night. What do you make of the Trump phenomenon?<br>
<br>
Well, you know, the republic is under siege by a moron, basically. The 
whole thing is tragic. Without overstating it, it's a tragedy for our 
democracy. When you start talking about elections being rigged, you're 
pushing people beyond democratic governance. And it's a very, very 
dangerous thing to do. Once you let those genies out of the bottle, they
 don't go back in so easy, if they go back in at all. The ideas he's 
moving to the mainstream are all very dangerous ideas – white 
nationalism and the alt-right movement. The outrageous things that he's 
done – not immediately disavowing David Duke? These are things that are 
obviously beyond the pale for any previous political candidate. It would
 sink your candidacy immediately.<br>
I believe that there's a price being paid for not addressing the real 
cost of the deindustrialization and globalization that has occurred in 
the United States for the past 35, 40 years, and how it's deeply 
affected people's lives and deeply hurt people to where they want 
someone who says they have a solution. And Trump's thing is simple 
answers to very complex problems. Fallacious answers to very complex 
problems. And that can be very appealing.<br>
<br>
The New York Times found the guy you wrote the song "Youngstown" about, 
and he's a Trump supporter. What do you make of that? Does it surprise 
you?<br>
<br>
Not really. Not if you see the history of Youngstown and what happened.<br>
<br>
If people there are pushed to the edge, and reaching for a metaphorical 
gun in the form of Trump, it's the same anger you've written about.<br>
<br>
Yeah. I mean, I started writing about this stuff 30 years ago or whenever it was.<br>
<br>
What do you think of Black Lives Matter?<br>
<br>
Well, it's all chickens coming home to roost. These are issues that have
 been ignored or hidden, and due to modern technology and the 
availability of cellphone cameras and constant video feed, these things 
are coming to the surface. Black Lives Matter is a natural outgrowth and
 response to the injustices that have been occurring for a very long 
time in the United States.<br>
<br>
Why is it so hard for so many white people to grapple with? Why the backlash?<br>
<br>
Nobody likes being told they're wrong.<br>
<br>
What do you think of Colin Kaepernick's protests and the reaction to it?<br>
<br>
Athletics is a difficult place to make political statements. There was 
the Olympics in the Sixties, and obviously Muhammad Ali. But sports is 
such an escapist field. I think when politics or personal expression is 
injected, it rankles people more than in other fields. But we're in a 
time where there isn't any place where these issues can be excluded. I 
admire Kaepernick, but it's a very difficult field to be outspoken in.<br>
<br>
As was music, maybe, at times. In the Eighties, you tried to 
disassociate yourself from Reagan. But you didn't go nearly as far as 
you went later. Why?<br>
<br>
Maybe I didn't have the confidence.<br>
<br>
You haven't chosen to do anything for the campaign this year. Have you 
lost faith in whatever power you might have to affect these things?<br>
<br>
I don't know. I think you have a limited amount of impact as an 
entertainer, performer or musician. I feel what I've done was certainly 
worth doing. And I did it at the time because I felt the country was in 
crisis, which it certainly is right now. I don't know if we've been 
approached or not to do anything at the moment. If so, I would take it 
into consideration and see where it goes.<br>
<br>
No, I haven't really lost faith in what I consider to be the small 
amount of impact that somebody in rock music might be able to have. I 
don't think people go to musicians for their political points of view. I
 think your political point of view is circumstances, and then how you 
were nurtured and brought up. But it's worth giving it a shot when it's 
the only thing you have.<br>
<br>
Is there a lack of enthusiasm for Hillary on your own part?<br>
<br>
No. I like Hillary. I think she would be a very, very good president.<br>
<br>
Where do you see the upper limits of performing live? We have Paul McCartney, who is, what, 76?<br>
Seventy-four.<br>
<br>
Seventy-four. You're keeping track! He's playing three-hour shows. But how does it work for you going forward?<br>
<br>
At my age, life is day-to-day. Depending upon your health, you can be at
 a very different point in your life at the age that I'm at. So it's how
 you're feeling and the shape you're in and how you feel emotionally and
 spiritually inside and what you're up for and what kind of effort and 
commitment you still want to bring to what you're doing. I'm still 
firing on all eights. I'm completely committed like I was when I was 16 
or 21 years old. I can still do it with no problem. But life as you get 
older is more like, "What a great day today is. And let me see, what am I
 going to do? What am I going to do in the next six months or the next 
year?" But there's no real answer to that question, because it's just 
where you're at right now. You realize there's a finiteness to it. So 
that changes your nightly experience. You can look out ahead and go, 
"OK, I'm 67. In 10 years I'm 77. Maybe that's four tours away, or five 
tours." You can do that and go, "Wow." You can speculate, but that's 
all.<br>
It's the finiteness. The intensity that the audience brings to the show 
now – they experience the finiteness also. You can appreciate it a 
little more. And the whole experience gets heightened.<br>
<br>
The next few years and beyond: Is the idea to just move between the 
different modes you have – E Street, solo, archival releases?<br>
<br>
Yeah. All of the above, you know. At this point, my plan is to do 
everything that I do and at different intervals. I'd love to tour solo 
again. I look forward to playing with the band again. We're going to 
play in Australia this winter. And whatever else comes my way, whatever 
projects come my way. I don't have any five- or six-year plan, outside 
of having whatever music I'm making now and getting out and just 
continuing my work life.<br>
<br>
You've said you have an album done that's influenced by Glen Campbell and Jimmy Webb's collaborations.<br>
<br>
I don't want to overemphasize the influences too much, because people 
may hear it and go, "What's that got to do with that?" But it was sort 
of a place where I found some inspiration.<br>
<br>
Is that a different record than the one you almost finished before Wrecking Ball?<br>
<br>
It's the record I wrote before Wrecking Ball but could not finish, and 
in attempting to finish it, I wrote Wrecking Ball. So the roots of the 
record go back quite a ways. Sometimes you have to wait for these 
puzzles to sort themselves out, and it can take years. I mean, I have a 
record that I've been working on that's 20 years old. That's just the 
way the process is working at the moment.<br>
<br>
What's the pace of your songwriting now, compared with the 2000s, when you were extremely prolific?<br>
<br>
Well, Wrecking Ball came, I would say, easily. The albums and songs have
 been coming along for quite a while. But I haven't written in a while 
right now, outside of the record that I have ready.<br>
<br>
What would you have said to Elvis when you hopped the fence at Graceland in the Seventies, if he had been there?<br>
<br>
I had a song I was probably trying to sell him, "Fire." Outside of that,
 I truly have no idea. I'm not sure what I was looking for.<br>
<br>
Has fat Elvis haunted you – perhaps as a fitness inspiration and as an example of exactly where you didn't want to end up?<br>
I don't know. I saw Elvis shortly before he died and I remember enjoying
 the show tremendously. Everybody makes their maps, and people will look
 at the one I wrote and there will be things they'll want to follow and 
things they won't want to follow. I got so much from Elvis as an 
inspiration, and I admire that voice so deeply right until the end. And 
everybody struggles.<br>
<br>
At the same time, you have a "stay hard, stay hungry, stay alive" kind of counter-philosophy.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of distractions along the way and a lot of places you 
can lose yourself. I was very aware of that, thanks to the people that 
came before me. And I worked very hard to avoid some of those pitfalls, 
and still do.<br>
<br>
You write that the E Street Band was hitting its stride in the studio 
with The River. But after one more album with them, you waited 18 years 
for the next. In the abstract, doesn't that seem a little odd?<br>
<br>
It's just the way it played out. I think we learned how to record 
finally with The River, even though we made somewhat of a mess of it. 
But we were making the kind of sound we wanted to make, and that 
continued into Born in the U.S.A. But Born in the U.S.A. was such a 
transformative event that after it I didn't really know where to go with
 the band. So I went in a different direction. Also, I wanted to 
immediately downsize, because I didn't want to play the game of "You 
have to top this and top these sales." I don't want to get into being 
that kind of artist.<br>
<br>
That said, how did you feel about the commercial underperformance of 
Human Touch and Lucky Town in 1992 – which ran straight into grunge?<br>
<br>
I think Nirvana hit at the moment those albums came out. I remember Jon,
 at the time, was nervous that the records hadn't done as well as he'd 
hoped or we'd hoped. We had a conversation: "Jon, it's just not our 
time. We'll have other times." And if you have a long life and a long 
work life, you're going to go through that. Sometimes it's just not your
 time. It was somebody else's.<br>
<br>
You write about 1995's The Ghost of Tom Joad as a pivot point back to 
writing about the larger world – how do you understand your avoidance of
 topical songwriting for so many years?<br>
<br>
You're always in a box, and you're an escape artist if you do what I do –
 or if you're a creative person, period. You build your box and then you
 escape from it. You build another one and you escape from it. That's 
ongoing. And you may at some point escape enough boxes where you find 
yourself back around to the first one again and you go, "Oh, I didn't 
think I had any more to say about these things. Wait a minute, yes, I 
do. I've got a lot more to say about these things!"<br>
How do you balance the magic that happens with the E Street Band with the quotidian realities of being the boss?<br>
You have to accept the fact that along the way it becomes a business – 
if you don't accept it, everything is going to get fucked up very 
deeply. So you're doing everyone a service by acknowledging that's a 
part of your relationship and negotiating your way through it as friends
 and as adults.<br>
<br>
You write that you needed disciples rather than employees early on. Did that mean total dedication?<br>
<br>
Yeah, it did. I made unreasonable demands and then perhaps things were 
unreasonably demanded of me in return [laughs]. But that was who we were
 at the time. I was an insecure young man. So my need for total 
dedication from the people I was working with was very great. Those 
things were tempered as time passed by. There's still an enormous amount
 of dedication, but we have healthy boundaries now that we didn't have 
when we were younger.<br>
<br>
In the studio, you deliberately played Steve Van Zandt off Jon. Where did the instinct come from to do something as –<br>
As devious as that? [Laughs]<br>
<br>
I was going to say maybe sophisticated, Machiavellian, but let's go with that.<br>
<br>
It came very naturally out of that part of me that is ruthless in the 
pursuit of my song. And they joined a team, so they're in for the whole 
ride, and we're all big boys.<br>
<br>
You write that you and Clarence Clemons couldn't hang out because it would have ruined your life.<br>
<br>
Clarence was a wild liver, and it was fabulous. But don't think you can do it at home, kids. He was a hearty soul.<br>
<br>
So you have deep friendships that aren't hanging-out type of friendships?<br>
<br>
Of course. I've got plenty of them. As you get older, you're involved in
 your family. It's a great joy when I'm with, say, Steve. We don't hang 
out that much. So it's a tremendous joy when I am with him. It was a 
great joy being with Clarence. He was hilarious. One of the funniest 
guys on the planet, and someone who enlivened you when you were around 
him. And then what you did together was so deep. So you never questioned
 your friendship or your allegiance to one another. It doesn't mean 
you're going to have dinner every day.<br>
<br>
You write that Steve's opinions could be destabilizing in the band. How so?<br>
<br>
He's a powerful man, so his opinions count greatly. He's also more 
free-swinging than I am. If you're at the head of an organization and 
you're trying to give it continuity and collective power, a strong 
personality can be disruptive. But that's been a part of our 
relationship our whole lives. I believe I've played the same role in his
 life, and I need somebody who will do that.<br>
You expected Wrecking Ball to make a bigger splash, and you concluded 
that people aren't looking to rock for that kind of statement anymore.<br>
<br>
Rock, at the moment, it's not the prime vehicle for communicating those 
particular ideas. There's a sort of mixture of pop and hip-hop that 
dominates the airways and is the current carrier for cultural comment.<br>
<br>
How do you feel about that?<br>
<br>
It's just the lay of the land. Pop always moves on and transforms 
itself. There's great music being made now. Kanye West makes terrific 
records. Kendrick Lamar is incredible. You wouldn't want things to 
remain static or to have a lasting hegemony on cultural comment. But 
there's somebody in a garage right now with a guitar, probably, figuring
 out some different way to reinvent it, some different place to take it.
 That's always going on.<br>
<br>
With the benefit of hindsight, why was rock &amp; roll so powerful a 
transformational force in your life – and in the world at large?<br>
<br>
There was an explosion of the id that had been repressed, first of all, 
previously to a great degree. So when you had Little Richard and Chuck 
Berry and Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis, there was this thing that had been 
contained suddenly exploding onto the airways, into the world, giving 
you permission to live with part of your spirit and your body that had 
been in many ways denied previously. It also came along at a time when 
people were questioning religion. So there was a secular-spiritual side 
to it, based in bliss and joy and a personal transcendence of 
circumstances. It was caught up in the dead center of the American 
dream, the dream of success and fulfillment. So it was just a powerful, 
explosive force that came along at a time when history almost demanded 
it.<br>
<br>
And when you needed it too.<br>
<br>
I was born at the right time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">ADDITONAL EXTRACTS (10/17/2016)</strong><br>
<br>
I've seen different moods in your concerts. There are some that are much
 more more serious and then explode into joy, and there are some that 
are lighthearted from the start. Do you lean into that?<br>
<br>
Lately, we've been playing the stacks of [songs from] Greetings and The 
Wild, the Innocent. That's pretty happy music, in a funny sort of way. 
It has the other side, too. But there is a lightness because it was not 
hard rock music. Which meant it was less physically aggressive, with 
more swinging, Latin, soul influences. After that, with Born to Run, the
 band became much more of a rock band and we played those songs much 
more aggressively. So the early records, you're up there and you're 
swaying and you're jamming a little bit. People are playing solos, you 
know. It's a very different state of mind. <br>
<br>
Looking back, I wish I might have plumbed that direction more. If you go
 to some of our outtake records, you can find music like that. There's 
really no reason it didn't come out at the time – it just didn't. But 
it's a feeling I like very much and have enjoyed playing, over these 
past 10 shows. And so perhaps the hard-hitting, more serious side of 
what we've done takes a little bit of a backseat on some of those shows,
 though it's still in there.<br>
<br>
One of the most striking aspects of Greetings was the lyrics – what Lester Bangs called "a whopping passel of verbiage."<br>
<br>
[Laughs] It was! And they've been like new revelations to me and the band.<br>
<br>
At the time people were asking about Beat poets, which I think you hadn't actually read yet.<br>
<br>
 I went and checked them out after people said that my stuff was kind of in that vein.<br>
<br>
<br>
There are moments in your career when commercial considerations actually
 resulted in better music. When Clive Davis asked for something more 
like a single on Greetings, for instance.<br>
<br>
Clive made Greetings From Asbury Park a much better record simply by 
making that request. Take Greetings without "Blinded by the Light" and 
"Spirit in the Night," it's a slightly different record. They pointed 
towards my next record already. And I found Clarence, who had been 
missing in action. I got him on those two cuts and I got an electric 
guitar on "Blinded by the Light," which wasn't on the rest of the 
record. And I wrote this sort of jazzy R&amp;B thing for "Spirit in the 
Night." So Clive did me a great service at the time by giving me the 
record back.<br>
<br>
And Jon Landau did you a big service by suggesting you write another single for Born in the U.S.A.<br>
<br>
Yeah. Very much!<br>
<br>
You went in the direction that would lead to Greetings after quitting 
your hard-rock band Steel Mill. In your book, you talk about rethinking 
your music entirely after a trip to California.<br>
<br>
I learned. I went some place I hadn't been. I went into a bigger 
environment musically and I learned that we were very good, but not 
quite as good as I thought we were. I had to think what I was going to 
do about that.<br>
<br>
Your manager, Jon Landau, famously saw some of the same flaws in Cream 
that you saw in Steel Mill. And Clapton ended up making the same leap 
that you made into more of an ensemble thing.<br>
<br>
Of course looking back, Cream was pretty good. [Laughs] But yeah, I 
think people do reach these reckoning points where you bump up against 
the limits of what you've structured at that time and you make other 
choices.<br>
<br>
We were talking about depression in your songs. On "Something in the 
Night," on Darkness on the Edge of Town, you sing, "You're born with 
nothing and better off that way." That is a dark mindset.<br>
<br>
That was the situation I was in at the time.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, it points to what you told yourself on the elevator 
on your way up to audition for John Hammond, which is, "I got nothing, 
I've got nothing to lose." That was your preferred state, in some way.<br>
<br>
It was my preferred state of mind, if I could convince myself into it.<br>
<br>
I guess it also does explain some of the courage you showed as a young man, the adventures that you went on.<br>
<br>
Yeah. It was just the way my life was working out. It wasn't a choice. 
These were just the things that happened to me on my way to where I was 
going. And, you know, the unusual experience of my parents moving away 
from me! And I was 19. So that was a little strange. And in those days, 
there was no contact. You weren't running up big phone bills, and at 
that time, I don't know if I had met someone who had been on an airplane
 for any long trip. I couldn't go on an airplane; that wasn't practical.
 The only way I could go see my parents was by driving across the 
country to see them. So it didn't happen much. We were very cut off in 
those days. So we were living by the skin of your teeth there and I was 
very happy doing so. But that was the kind of life it was.<br>
<br>
You say in the book that at the time you signed to Columbia Records, you
 "wanted to collide with the times and create a voice that had a 
musical, social and cultural impact." You had all that in your head at 
that time?<br>
<br>
Yeah, when I was 23. But I had a lot of experience before that. From the
 time I signed my record deal, I made a lot of very specific choices. 
Just signing it on my own was a great departure and I had a very clear 
idea of the kind of musician I wanted to be. I was very, very ambitious 
at a very young age. And I had thought through these things a lot 
already.<br>
<br>
You obviously paid tribute to them onstage, but how much did the deaths 
of both David Bowie and Prince this year get under your skin?<br>
<br>
It was a terrible shame. It was a great loss and a tragedy. I felt a 
great kinship with Prince. And he was a guy, when I'd go to see him, I'd
 say, "Oh, man, OK, back to the drawing board." There was a film of him 
on the Arsenio Hall show, where he plays a series of songs in a row. 
It's just some of the greatest showmanship I've ever seen. And he knew 
everything. He knew all about it, and then could put it to work. Just 
since the Sixties and Seventies and your Sam and Daves and your James 
Browns, he's one of the greatest showmen to come along. I studied that 
stuff a lot and put as much of it to use as I can with my talents. But 
he just took it to another level.<br>
<br>
But when these guys go, does it give you a little boot in the ass or a reminder of the finite-ness of all of this?<br>
<br>
Well, I think we all sit back and go, "What?" I couldn't believe it when
 I heard it. Any death gives you renewed sight. It's a part of what the 
dead pass on to us. A chance to look at our lives and look at the world 
again. It's just a powerful experience.<br>
<br>
You've never starred in or directed a movie, never had an exhibition of 
your paintings. You don't do the extra stuff that a lot of rock stars 
do. This book is as far you've gone. Does the other stuff not interest 
you?<br>
<br>
You've got to have a deep feeling as to why you want to do something 
else and you may not have those particular talents. If I had some deep 
feeling of, I have to turn this into a film, I'd go ahead and give it a 
try. But I've never had that. If you go to Ghost of Tom Joad or Devils 
and Dust, those are my little films. And I have absolutely no ability to
 paint or draw whatsoever. So that's not a temptation in any way, shape 
or form. I found that the forms I worked in have been a great outlet for
 what I've wanted to express. Also, when I was very young and got 
offered a few different movie roles, I was concerned with diluting my 
work as a musician and the identity I was building for myself at that 
time. And so I said, "I'm going to focus everything I have on what I'm 
doing right here."<br>
<br>
The fun thing about Ghost of Tom Joad is it's the one record of yours 
that audiophiles love – they use it to demonstrate high-end stereos.<br>
<br>
That's very funny. That record was never really mastered, and we used 
the rough mixes we did on the day of the recordings and so it was never 
fucked with after that. It was this sort of very plain-sounding thing. 
But that's why the stories ring true on it. I didn't want to dress it at
 all, similar to Nebraska, you know. These were records that were made 
at the very moment the music was made.<br>
<br>
There's moments on that record where it feels you're pushing beyond the 
song form, where there's barely any music, almost like recitations.<br>
<br>
Yeah. <br>
<br>
It made me wonder at the time if you were going to start writing short stories.<br>
<br>
No. I'm very happy as a songwriter, and once again, it's a different 
talent. But I got very close to that style of narrative writing during 
that record. Also on Devils and Dust. It's a style of writing I get a 
great, great deal of enjoyment out of.<br>
<br>
It's very hard to marry that to a rock song.<br>
<br>
Yeah. Rock music. First of all, it's a lot louder and noisier. So 
narrative writing within the rock form, when I've tried it, it never 
melded very well. You know, you want that verse, chorus, you want that 
chorus to come along and take you somewhere. Though that's changed with a
 lot of modern music. A lot of modern music finds its hooks in so many 
different places. In the bass, in the rhythm. There's a lot of different
 ways to create content and narrative at this point that you hear on the
 radio.<br>
<br>
You mentioned in the book that two of the songs on Wrecking Ball came from a gospel film project. What was that?<br>
<br>
Um, I don't want to talk about it. It wasn't something that came to fruition and I'm still sitting on the rest of them.<br>
<br>
"Rocky Ground" always sounded cinematic to me. It always sounded like it should be in a movie.<br>
<br>
Yeah. It was originally written for a film.<br>
<br>
I think that's one of your best songs and probably didn't get the traction it deserves.<br>
<br>
Yeah. And a guy did a remix of it that's better than the one that's on 
the record. I'm just very proud of that song. It was just a small thing 
of beauty.<br>
<br>
In the wake of Tom Joad, it seemed that you were contemplating a sort of
 semi-retirement from the world of big records and big tours.<br>
<br>
I did for a while, cause I enjoyed the Tom Joad experience tremendously.
 I said, I might just continue here, making these kind of records and I 
made a record right after Tom Joad that was really Devils and Dust. But 
when I made it, I said, "Two of these in a row? I don't know. Maybe it's
 not for me, you know." Basically we went back towards the band again. 
So, you know, you're following your instincts and your impulses and when
 I got there and was going to make another one, I said, "Well, I would 
have to ignore a lot of my other abilities to just do this." And I took 
too much joy and pleasure in the physicality of the other kind of music I
 made, in the talents that I gathered to make that music, to just limit 
myself to one particular genre.<br>
<br>
How do you see Human Touch and Lucky Town now?<br>
<br>
I like those records, myself. There's great songs on those records. Of 
course, Steve [Van Zandt]'s comment at the time, was you should do these
 again and cut them with the E Street Band. You know? I just finished 
the record! The first thing he says to me, "You ought to make it again."
 That explains our relationship in a nutshell, having that kind of 
immediate interaction. And then when I played him Lucky Town, he said, 
"That's more like it." There was something correct about what he was 
saying, in a lot of ways. I think that while I loved the experience of 
playing with the musicians that I played with on that record and I 
learned a great deal from doing so, it might have gotten in the way of 
people hearing both of those records. And there are still plenty of 
songs on them that that we play. We played "Better Days" and we played 
"Living Proof." I love "Living Proof."<br>
<br>
Me too.<br>
<br>
And "Lucky Town." These are songs that we should play more of.<br>
<br>
It feels like the stripped-down rock of "Living Proof" and "Lucky Town" 
is still a direction you could explore more at some point.<br>
Maybe so.<br>
<br>
At least on the song "Real World," you've acknowledged that the 
production was wrong or the approach was wrong. A certain slickness 
crept in.<br>
<br>
Well, you know looking back on it, I might have cut those songs somewhat
 differently and with a different sound. That's the reason that 
immediately upon being finished with Human Touch, I wrote and recorded 
an entire other record before that record could even come out! You know?
 I think I was looking for an antidote of some sort or a balance of some
 sort that I felt, maybe we went a little too far in this direction 
production-wise on that album. You can make that argument.<br>
<br>
You write that your grandmother's overbearing love both broke you and 
made you. How much of the dysfunction of your early life was truly 
necessary to make you into the artist you became?<br>
<br>
I always say that artists come from the same place, where somebody told 
you you're the second coming, and somebody told you you're dirt. You 
believe both of those people and you go about trying to reconcile those 
two things through a lot of your work life. So on the one hand, you go, 
where are my apostles? Yet, I'm not really worthy of any of this. So 
you're always trying to reconcile those two points of view. You get 
older and you learn how to live with all those things and you realize 
the ridiculousness of some of it. And you put it aside. But yeah, it was
 a powerful, powerful, powerful motivation.<br>
<br>
Finally, given that you had some rough years emotionally, how are you doing now?<br>
<br>
I'm good! I'm good right now, you know [knocks on wood].</div>

<br>
NPR- October 7, 2016<br>
</strong><br>
As a young musician coming up in the early 1970s, Bruce Springsteen 
played in the bars of Asbury Park, N.J., a hardscrabble urban beach town
 full of colorful characters. The town fired his imagination and 
inspired him musically, but still he found himself longing for more.<br>
<br>
Springsteen tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross that he knew that if he was 
ever going to make his mark on the larger world, it would be through his
 words.<br>
<br>
"I looked at myself and I just said, 'Well, you know, I can sing but I'm
 not the greatest singer in the world. I can play guitar very well but 
I'm not the greatest guitar player in the world,' " Springsteen 
remembers. "So I said, "Well, if I'm going to project an individuality, 
it's going to have to be in my writing."<br>
<br>
Springsteen went on to record the album Born To Run in 1974; its title 
track paved the way for his mainstream popularity. The album also lends 
its name to his new memoir, in which Springsteen reflects on how he and 
his music were shaped by home, roots, family and community.<br>
What follows is the transcript of the conversation Springsteen and Gross had in the recording studio at his New Jersey home.<br>
<br>
Terry Gross: Bruce Springsteen, welcome to Fresh Air and thank you for 
welcoming us into your studio. I'd love it if you would start by reading
 the very opening from the foreword of your book. It's really a 
fantastic book, and I'd like our listeners to just hear a little bit of 
your writing.<br>
<br>
 Bruce-  I come from a boardwalk town where almost everything is tinged 
with a bit of fraud. So am I. By twenty, no race-car-driving rebel, I 
was a guitar player on the streets of Asbury Park and already a member 
in good standing amongst those who "lie" in service of the truth ... 
artists with a small 'a.' But I held four clean aces. I had youth, 
almost a decade of hard-core bar band experience, a good group of 
homegrown musicians who were attuned to my performance style and a story
 to tell.<br>
This book is both a continuation of that story and a search into its 
origins. I've taken as my parameters the events in my life I believe 
shaped that story and my performance work. One of the questions I'm 
asked over and over again by fans on the street is "How do you do it?" 
In the following pages I will try to shed a little light on how, and, 
more important, why.<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading that. So, what's it like for you to write something 
that doesn't have to rhyme, and that you don't have to perform onstage?<br>
<br>
[laughs] Not having to perform it onstage is a good one. But it's a 
little different, you know? I'm used to writing something, it becomes a 
record, it comes out, then I go perform and I play it and I get this 
immediate feedback from the audience, so that's been the pattern of my 
life. But the book has been a little bit different, you know?<br>
I mean, you get feedback from the press and fans are just starting to 
get a chance to read it, so I'm looking forward to that. But you still 
had to find the music inside your language, you know? That's a big part 
of what sort of moved me to begin writing the book.<br>
<br>
I wrote a little essay, and I felt, "Yeah, this has a good voice. This 
has a good feeling. It feels like me." But then once you get into the 
book, you've got to constantly find the rhythm of your prose, and it 
ends up being quite a musical experience either way.<br>
<br>
"<br>
But that's one of the things I love about the book, is that there is 
rhythm and music in it, even though it's not a song. So, we'll talk 
about this a little later if it's OK with you, but in the book, you 
write about how in your 60s, you've experienced periods of profound 
depression.<br>
<br>
Yeah.<br>
<br>
And I'm wondering if that affected either the motivation for writing the
 book, your approach to writing the book, what you wanted to write about
 in the book?<br>
<br>
No, it really didn't have anything to do with the book at all. The book 
was just something that came along after we played the Super Bowl and I 
wrote a little essay that went online. And I had two or three weeks and I
 said, "Wow, that essay was pretty good. Maybe I'll try and write some 
other stuff."   Writing about the depression — I just felt, you know, 
when you write a book like this you have to open up your life. You have 
to be willing to do so to a certain degree. And [my wife] Patti 
[Scialfa] was very gracious in the — to the extent that she allowed me 
to write the book. You know, there's a lot of it that's pretty personal.
 And I felt that it was connected to some of the music I had written, 
and so that was just an important thing to write about.<br>
<br>
So many of your songs, particularly the early ones, are about searching 
for a dream and wanting to bust out of the confines of your life. And in
 some ways, I get the impression from your book that that was your 
father's story, except he never found the dream. It's kind of a little 
bit like the story that you describe in your song "The River."<br>
<br>
Right. My dad was young, he went to work. But he'd been to war, he'd 
seen some of the world. It wasn't like he was going to be an extensive 
traveler or something. It didn't seem to be in his nature or in the 
nature of his parents or many of the folks in my family, really. We had a
 cousin that went off to Brown University — it was like a nuclear 
explosion took place, you know? It was just incredible for everybody.So I
 mean the book, yeah, you're correct that my parents did really sort of 
live out a big part of that story. And, to a certain degree, he did find
 his little piece of what he was looking for in California. <br>
<br>
Because when you were 19, he moved to California.<br>
<br>
Yeah, they moved out West, which was a huge undertaking, because no one —
 it was like moving to another planet for them. But I think that's what 
my father wanted to do, he wanted to move to another planet. And they 
had very little. They had $3,000 and I think they had an old Rambler and
 they slept two nights in the car, and a night in a motel and they had 
my little sister with them with all of the stuff packed on top. It was a
 really go-for-broke decision and it did pay off for them, you know. I 
think they enjoyed the West Coast and their California life quite a bit,
 you know. My father still had periods of illness that were —<br>
<br>
You're talking about mental illness.<br>
<br>
Yeah. Difficult to manage. But I believe he did feel like he found something there that he couldn't have found at home.<br>
<br>
Do you think the song "Born To Run" is in part about him and in part about you?<br>
<br>
Well, someone mentioned that to me the other day. I always thought it 
was just about me. [Laughs] But what do you know? And, looking back on 
it, my parents lived out quite a bit of that story themselves. <br>
<br>
Except you had a dream in a way that your father maybe didn't have a dream that he could articulate? <br>
<br>
It certainly wasn't one he could articulate. It was just,"I gotta get out of here." <br>
<br>
So, this story I think is really interesting. You tell the story of how 
in 1967, there's a lot of friction between you and your father, and 
you're in your teens, you're growing your hair long, you're into music. 
And long hair then, probably particularly in the working class town 
where you were, was a pretty —It was unusual.<br>
<br>
Radical thing.<br>
<br>
It was an unusual thing, it was.<br>
<br>
Making a statement. [Laughs]<br>
<br>
You were making a statement. [Laughs]<br>
<br>
So you were in a motorcycle accident, got thrown, like, 20 feet, really 
hurt yourself pretty bad. You were in the hospital. You get home, your 
father calls in a barber, and the barber cuts your hair against your 
will.<br>
<br>
[Laughs] It's funny now. I didn't think it was funny then.<br>
<br>
I'll bet you didn't!<br>
<br>
But I was lucky I survived the motorcycle accident, because the bike 
went under the car. I flew out about 20 or 25 feet, I didn't have a 
helmet on, I hit my head on the pavement and knocked myself out, gave 
myself a brain concussion, screwed up my left leg. And I was lucky then 
that I didn't get killed, because I didn't have any protective clothing 
on whatsoever. And I took a pretty good beating<br>
.<br>
But yes, such was the nature of the day when the barber was called in and Samson's locks were trimmed.<br>
<br>
But I actually found it an upsetting story, because here you barely 
survived. You're lying there disabled and your father takes advantage of
 you and cuts off something that you love that's part of your identity, 
when you're already so physically wounded. It felt very unfair to me. 
How did it feel to you at the time?<br>
<br>
[Laughs] Such was the lay of the land at the time. I mean, of course I 
was furious about it at the time. But what can you say — it's water 
under the bridge.<br>
So you write, too, about your father that he was kind of very — let me 
quote you, because you put it so well. You write that, "He loved me but 
he couldn't stand me. He felt we competed for my mother's affections. We
 did. He also saw in me too much of his real self. Inside, however, 
beyond his rage, he harbored a gentleness, timidity, shyness and a 
dreamy insecurity. These were things I wore on the outside and the 
reflection of these qualities in his boy repelled him. I was 'soft' and 
he hated 'soft.' Of course, he'd been brought up 'soft.' A mama's boy 
just like me."<br>
<br>
So that timidity and shyness that you wore on the outside, it's kind of like the opposite of your stage persona.<br>
<br>
I know, it's bizarre.<br>
<br>
Can you tell us a little bit more about the timidity and shyness of your youth?<br>
<br>
Yeah, well, T-Bone Burnett once said that much of rock music is simply 
going "Waaah Daddy!" So I gotta take my, I've gotta take some blame for 
that myself, I guess. [Laughs]<br>
But, yeah, when I was young, I was very shy and that was my personality,
 you know. I was a pretty sensitive kid and quite neurotic, filled with a
 lot of anxiety, which all would have been very familiar to my pop, you 
know? Except it was a part of himself he was trying to reject, so I got 
caught in the middle of it, I think.<br>
You say in the book that you were so nervous for a while during your childhood that you'd blink, like, 100 times a minute. <br>
Haha, yeah.<br>
<br>
And you chewed your knuckles. Was there a specific cause of that anxiety or was it just, do you think, the way you were wired?<br>
<br>
I mean, I never found out, you know. It was just tremendous anxiety, you
 know. Tremendous feeling of being out of control of your young life.<br>
<br>
So do you think that your stage persona draws both from the angry and 
uninhibited side of you and the more inhibited, timid side of you?<br>
I think I created my particular stage persona out of my dad's life and perhaps I even built it to suit him to some degree.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think it's both there. I think if you just, you know, I think plenty 
of folks, if you just looked at the outside, it's pretty alpha-male, 
which is a little ironic, because that was personally never exactly 
really me. I think I created my particular stage persona out of my dad's
 life and perhaps I even built it to suit him to some degree.<br>
When I was looking for a voice to mix with my voice, I put on my 
father's work clothes, as I say in the book, and I went to work. Whether
 it was a result of wanting to emulate him so I felt closer or whether 
it was, as I say in the book, I wanted to be the reasonable voice of 
revenge for what I had seen his life come to. It was all of these 
things.<br>
And so it was an unusual creation, but most of these — most people's 
stage personas are created out of the flotsam and jetsam of their 
internal geography and they're trying to create something that solves a 
series of very complex problems inside of them or in their history. And I
 think, annoyingly, when I went to do that, that's what I was — I was 
trying to integrate all of these very difficult things that I'd been 
unable to integrate in my life and in my life with my parents.<br>
 "<br>
So, you also lived near the church and church was a part of your life. 
And you write about Catholicism, "This is the world where I found the 
beginnings of my song. In Catholicism, there existed the poetry, danger 
and darkness that reflected my imagination and my inner self. I found a 
language of great and harsh beauty, of fantastic stories, of 
unimaginable punishment and infinite reward."<br>
<br>
Are there particular Bible stories or religious paintings that really made an impression on you? <br>
<br>
No, it was more just the basics. I think when you're a child, you just 
cling to the basics, which is the basic story of Jesus and the 
Crucifixion and hell and eternal punishment and the flames. This was all
 stuff that was, when you're young, this is very tangible and is as real
 as the gas station next door to you.<br>
<br>
Maybe especially since the church was just about next door to you.<br>
<br>
Exactly! So these things, and also because we lived in the presence of 
the church and the convent and the rectory and the school 24/7, and this
 was an enormous cornerstone in the lives of my entire family. They were
 all pretty serious Catholic churchgoers. And as a child, these things 
were very, very terrifying.<br>
What things? Were you afraid of hell?<br>
<br>
Haha, yeah.<br>
<br>
Eternal damnation?<br>
<br>
[Laughs] That one too! So, these were stories that were not stories, you
 know? They were simply facts. This is what occurred. This is what can 
occur, unless you toe the line, my friend. So, when you're a child — and
 you forget that the Catholic religion at the time was much darker and 
more mysterious. The entire Mass was in Latin. If you go to my church 
now it's incredibly bright inside, but when I was young, it was very 
dark inside.<br>
It was just the difference in the way they've painted it since I've gone
 there and it strives for a very different and welcoming spirit. Where 
when I was young, it was sort of built to intimidate, even on this very 
local level and this very small church in this small town, it still held
 you in the palm of its darkness. And it was something I carried with 
me, never forgot, brought into my music, and it's been in my music ever 
since.<br>
<br>
So when your father told the family that he had to leave New Jersey and 
go to California and he was going to do it, he hoped the family came 
with him, but he was going to go one way or the other. And so he left, 
your mother went with him, your youngest sister went with him, your 
sister who was in the middle was 17, she had just gotten pregnant, you 
say she didn't even know how to make toast.<br>
[Laughs]<br>
<br>
And your parents left.<br>
<br>
I may be a little harsh on her there. I think she knew how to make toast. [Laughs]<br>
<br>
And you were 19. And suddenly, there were no authority figures in your 
life. I mean, your parents were gone, your father wasn't going to — 
whatever he was doing, he wasn't going to do it anymore. He wasn't going
 to be around. What did that freedom feel like to you?<br>
<br>
By the time I was 19, my parents weren't very authoritative over my life.<br>
<br>
You were already gone?<br>
<br>
Yeah. At the time, I was already down at the Shore and I was staying out
 overnight and sleeping on the beach and, you know, coming home at 3, 4 
a.m. after having played a show in some club. And so, I was five years 
into my own life already. It started when I was 14 1/2. And I didn't 
have any doubt at that time about what I was going to do or where I was 
going. I was a musician. I was going to play. I had a band. We were 
gonna make enough money to survive on.I was quite prepared for that to 
occur, whereas my sister was in a very different situation. She just had
 a newborn and a new marriage and really missed the family when they 
left. <br>
<br>
During your early years as a musician, you were in Asbury Park, 
boardwalk, carnival atmosphere. What did you love about that kind of 
urban beach? <br>
<br>
Yeah.<br>
<br>
And Madame Marie and all the boardwalk regulars. I mean, you made great 
stories out of those characters, great songs out of those characters. 
But what appealed to you about knowing them and writing about them? <br>
<br>
It was just my location at the time. I didn't move to Asbury with the thought of — it wasn't an anthropological —<br>
<br>
But you connected in some way —<br>
<br>
— reason, but I went and I just fit in there. Asbury was down on its 
luck, but not as bad as it would get. And so there was a lot of room to 
move, you know, clubs were open until 5 a.m., there were gay clubs, in 
even the late '60s, it was a bit of an open city.... when I went to 
write, I just wrote about what was around me, which is kind of something
 I've done for most of my life.<br>
<br>
So as young ne'er-do-wells, we fit very comfortably in that picture, and
 then when I went to write, I just wrote about what was around me, which
 is kind of something I've done for most of my life.And it fired my 
imagination, it of course was a colorful locale. The city was filled 
with characters and plenty of people at loose ends, and so it just 
became a very natural thing to write about. I didn't give it too much 
thought at the time, but I did think that it gave me a very individual 
identity, and that if I was going to go out into the musical world on a 
national level, I was very interested in being connected to my home, my 
home state, my home base. And I thought all of these things were very 
local, and they were very much mine, there wasn't anyone else writing in
 this way about these things at that time. So it was something I did 
very intentionally in a sense, as creating a certain very, very specific
 and original identity. And that's one of the things that really 
interests me in comparing you to Dylan. Because when you first started, 
people were comparing you to Dylan, one of the "new Dylans," and 
everything.<br>
<br>
In some ways, persona-wise, you're the opposite. Because he's always — 
he changed his name. He surrounded himself in mystery. His lyrics are 
very obscure.<br>
And your lyrics tell stories. You're all about a place. You reveal so 
much about yourself and the world around you in your songs. You know 
what I mean? I know that you're more than what you literally tell us 
about in the songs, but still, you have an identity and tried to tell us
 something of who you are in your songs. <br>
<br>
You just go where your psychology leads you, I think. You know, I've 
always loved the fact that Bob's been able to sustain his mystery over 
50 or 60 years. In this day and age, that's quite a feat in itself and, 
you know, the things that I loved about Bob's music — and I describe him
 in the book as a father of my country, which he really is — were things
 that just didn't fit when I went to do my job, you know? I had come out
 of a somewhat different circumstance and the clothes just didn't fit.<br>
<br>
I want to quote you again. So you write, this is toward the beginning of
 your career: "I wanted to be a voice that reflected experience and the 
world I live in. So I knew in 1972 that to do this, I would need to 
write very well and more individually than I had ever written before." 
And at some point you realized, too, that although you had the most 
popular bar band in Asbury Park, that there was a bigger world, there 
were a lot of talented people, and in order to be someone in that world,
 to have a career, to make a difference, that you had to figure out what
 was unique about you and you had to write great songs.<br>
<br>
And, in fact, you achieved that. You wrote great songs, but how did you 
go about trying to write the best songs that you could? I mean, when you
 knew that a lot of this was going to depend on the songwriting?<br>
<br>
When I thought about signing a record deal or writing something that 
might put me in the position — because I had already had plenty of 
things that had fallen through with my rock bands — I looked at myself 
and I just said, "Well, you know, I can sing but I'm not the greatest 
singer in the world. I can play guitar very well but I'm not the 
greatest guitar player in the world. What excites me about a lot of the 
artists I love?" And I realized, well, they created their own personal 
world that I could enter into through their music and through their 
songwriting.<br>
There's people that can do it instrumentally, like Jimi Hendrix or Edge 
of U2 or Pete Townshend. I didn't have as unique a purely musical 
signature. I was a creature of a lot of different influences, and so I 
said, "Well, if I'm going to project an individuality, it's going to 
have to be in my writing."<br>
<br>
I just had myself and the guitar, so I was going to have to do something
 with just my voice, just the guitar and just my songs that was going to
 move someone enough to give me a shot.<br>
<br>
And at the time, for one of the few times in my life, I didn't have a 
band. I just had myself and the guitar, so I was going to have to do 
something with just my voice, just the guitar and just my songs that was
 going to move someone enough to give me a shot.<br>
So I wrote songs that were very lyrically alive and lyrically dense and 
they were unique. But it really came out of a motivation to where I 
understood I was going to have to make my mark that way. <br>
<br>
You've lived a lot of your life on the road, and for the first half — 
well, I'm not going to do the math here, but for a lot of your early 
years — I mean, you were single, you were in monogamous or 
semi-monogamous relationships, as you describe it. But you weren't 
married and you didn't have children. But you had a first marriage and 
then Patti Scialfa joined the band and you got married and you have 
three children now.<br>
<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
What did it take for you to see family as something that was a wonderful
 thing, as opposed to something that was going to harm your sense of 
freedom and flexibility and creativity?<br>
<br>
I think for a lot of musicians, that's a difficult call. Because by 
nature we're transient. We move on. We're people that — like I say in 
the book, there's folks that stay and there's folks that go, and we're 
folks that go. I didn't have a blueprint from my childhood that I could 
call on, which is an enormous deficit when you're trying to put together
 a family life. I didn't see a family life where men were thriving 
inside of it. My dad tended to blame the family for his inability to 
achieve what he wanted to achieve, you know? So, unfortunately, I was 
coming from that particular frame of mind, and it took quite a bit of 
work and time and mistakes to begin to feel, to understand the strength 
that comes along with building a home life, you know? That was very 
mysterious to me, I was very skeptical of it for a long time, and didn't
 understand it fully until Patti and I got together. <br>
<br>
Was it helpful to be married to somebody in the band? Because she would 
certainly understand what life on the road was and what being a musician
 is because she is one.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I think so. Patti was an artist and a musician and she was a 
songwriter and she was a lot like me in that she was transient also. She
 worked busking on the streets in New York, she waitressed, she just 
lived a musician's life, she lived an artist's life. So we were both 
people who were very uncomfortable in a domestic setting, getting 
together and trying to build one. And seeing if our particularly strange
 jigsaw puzzle pieces were going to fit together in a way that was going
 to create something different for the two of us — and it did.<br>
<br>
You write about redefining what it meant to you to be a man, that you'd 
learned about the rigidity in the blue-collar narcissism of manhood, 
'50s-style, from your father and you learned to always withhold 
something — you do not lower your mask. Did you consciously rethink what
 it meant to be a man?<br>
<br>
These are hard questions. Fresh Air is difficult! Let me think.<br>
<br>
Well, you know, you're young and you're always in pursuit of your young 
manhood. You know, you're trying to figure out, what does that mean? 
There's a lot of pressure on young men to sort that out, and we tend to 
gravitate towards one-dimensional iconography as far as what it means to
 be a fully grown man. And part of my onstage creation was someone 
trying to sort that out.<br>
<br>
I think initially, our audiences were filled with young men. Our initial
 audience was a lot of young guys who you played a bit of a big-brother 
role for, and were trying to sort out a lot of the same things, right? 
As soon as "Born To Run" hit, you know. So, it was something that I 
worked pretty hard on.<br>
<br>
You started going to therapy in 1983. And at some point, you say in your
 60s you had a really bad depression. And I'm wondering if you thought 
about, during that period when you were very depressed, how many people 
in the world really wanted to be you?<br>
It doesn't count for that much at the time.<br>
<br>
Yeah. Right.<br>
<br>
But people see you on stage and, yeah, I'd want to be that guy. I want 
to be that guy myself very often, you know? I had plenty of days where 
I'd go, "Man, I wish I could be that guy." And there's a big difference 
between what you see on stage and then my general daily, my daily 
existence.<br>
<br>
You write about how being on stage is almost like medicine for you? <br>
<br>
Sure!<br>
<br>
Does it get you out of yourself? <br>
<br>
Oh, of course. You're immediately pulled out of the inside of your head.
 I have been on stage on a few occasions where I felt I couldn't escape 
the interior of my interior thoughts, but Peter Wolf once said, "What's 
the strangest thing you can do onstage? Think about what you're doing." 
There's just nothing weirder you can do.<br>
If you're up there thinking about what you're doing, you're just not there. And it's not gonna happen, you know.<br>
<br>
So trying to learn how to overcome those — which is a normal thing to 
do, you're in front of a lot of people, people are going to get very 
self-conscious. So you have to learn to sort of overcome that tendency 
towards self-consciousness and just blow it wide open and you just jump 
in and join all those people that are out there enjoying what you're 
doing together. <br>
<br>
During the depression, there was a period of a year and a half when you 
weren't on the road. You were home with one of your sons, I guess with 
your youngest?<br>
<br>
Mhmm. <br>
<br>
Did that contribute to the depression because you couldn't be on stage and you couldn't have that kind of cathartic experience?<br>
<br>
Yeah, I tend to be not my own best company. So I can get a little lost 
if I don't have my work to occasionally focus me. But at the same time, 
you've got to be able to figure that out.<br>
<br>
The year and a half I was home, my son was in his last year of high 
school and it was kind of my last opportunity to be here with him in the
 house and I wanted to get that right. <br>
So, I want to ask you about a physical thing that happened to you that 
you write about in the book. You were getting numbness and tingling in, 
was it your left hand?<br>
<br>
My left hand and arm, yeah.<br>
<br>
Yeah, and it was hard for you to play. And it turned out you had a disc problem in your neck.<br>
<br>
Right.<br>
<br>
And you had this, wow, incredible surgery where they make an incision in
 your throat, push the vocal cords aside and basically rebuild your 
discs?<br>
<br>
Correct. It was probably from thrashing my head around for 40 years or 
so. But, you know, it was just wear and tear. And I had a pinched nerve 
and it was causing a lot of electricity down my arm, and I ignored it 
for about four or five years.<br>
It was just kind of getting worse and worse, but I was still able to get
 around on the guitar and then, during the end of — that was the middle 
of the Wrecking Ball tour, it simply became too much. I was having a lot
 of pain in my neck after the show and my arm was going numb and my 
fingers were going numb and towards the end of the night, it kind of got
 difficult to play. So I said, "Well, I guess I have to do something 
about it." So I found a doctor and it's kind of an everyday operation, 
though you wouldn't want to get it wrong, you know? You could lose your 
voice or lose complete feeling in your arms.<br>
<br>
It sounds terrifying! Putting your vocal cords aside?<br>
<br>
[Laughs] That was the part that was a little anxiety-creating. I said, 
"Well, what happens?" and he says, "Well, you know, we kind of slit your
 throat a little bit, then we go in and we pull your vocal cords and we 
tie them off to one side and then I get in there with the screwdriver 
and little tools and some titanium and we make a little basket in there.
 Then we take some bone off your hip and we stuff that into the basket 
and we kind of sew you back up and before long that all grows together 
and you're as good as new."<br>
Amazingly, that is exactly what happened. I spent about three months 
when I couldn't sing at all, so that was anxiety-provoking. But after 
that, I went back out.<br>
I sang for two hours in my garage one day to see if I had a voice. It 
seemed to be okay. And we went to South Africa and we just started 
playing, did the rest of the tour and it was much improved. So it's 
remained much improved to this day.<br>
<br>
Did physical pain — was that part of the cause of the depression? Did it feed depression?<br>
Physical pain?<br>
<br>
Yeah.<br>
<br>
Physical pain is my friend. I pursue it every night for four hours! 
[Laughs] That makes me feel good! I'm a good Catholic boy! So no, I 
don't think so. No, no. It didn't have anything to do with it. <br>
<br>
Do you feel like there's an extrovert and an introvert within you that sometimes compete?<br>
Yeah, I suppose everyone has that. In me, it's just a lot more 
noticeable. The extremes are a lot greater. I mean, if you see me 
performing, you're going, "That guy is simply the most extroverted guy 
I've ever seen! What a show-off!"<br>
<br>
But if you see me very often on a daily basis, and all the while growing
 up, I was very introverted. Very introverted. So I have sort of the 
extremes of both of those characteristics. <br>
<br>
As you mention in your book, you wanted to write songs that you wouldn't
 outgrow — that you could sing as an adult, that weren't just kid songs.
 And done. Accomplished. But when you sing some of your early songs now,
 as you still do, like "Born To Run," does the song have a different 
meaning to you than it did when you first started performing it?<br>
<br>
We just had a series of concerts where the show was very interesting 
because we'd start out with my earliest material and we'd play it about 
half a record off our first record, and then half or three-quarters off 
of the second record, so it was going back to my earliest music and 
re-singing my earliest songs that I wrote when I was 22. And it was 
funny that they just fit perfectly well, you know?<br>
<br>
... the wonderful thing about my job is that you can revisit your 
22-year-old self or your 24-year-old self any particular night you want.<br>
<br>
I sort of gathered the years up as time passes, and you can revisit — 
the wonderful thing about my job is that you can revisit your 
22-year-old self or your 24-year-old self any particular night you want.<br>
<br>
The songs pick up some extra resonance, I hope. But still, they're 
there. And I can revisit that period of my life when I choose, so it's 
quite a nice experience. And the songs themselves do broaden out as time
 passes and take on subtly different meanings, take on more meaning, I 
find.<br>
<br>
What's an example of a song that's taken on a different meaning or more meaning for you?<br>
<br>
A lot of the ones that are people's favorites, you know. "Born To Run," 
that expands every time we go out. It just seems that more of your life 
fills it in, fills in the story, and when we hit it every night, it's 
always a huge catharsis. It's fascinating to see the audience singing it
 back to me. It's quite wonderful to see people that intensely singing 
your song.<br>
<br>
As someone who grew up in Brooklyn and now lives in Philadelphia, I love
 that you've continued to live in New Jersey. Why have you stayed close 
to the home that your father left? Your father went to the opposite 
coast when you were a teenager.<br>
<br>
It's rather ironic. But I just felt very comfortable here and I was 
uncomfortable with city life. I didn't consider myself to be built for 
urban life. I was more or less a kid that came out of a small town and I
 was a beach bum and loved the ocean and loved the sun and I liked the 
people that were here. I liked who I was when I was here.<br>
I felt like a lot of my heroes from the past lost themselves in 
different ways once they had a certain amount of success, and I was 
nervous about that and I wanted to remain grounded. And living in this 
part of New Jersey was something that was essential to who I was and 
continues to this day to be that way. <br>
<br>
I wanted to continue writing about the things that I felt were 
important, and those things were pretty much here. I felt it kept me in 
close contact with where I came from, which I was interested in doing. I
 felt like a lot of my heroes from the past lost themselves in different
 ways once they had a certain amount of success, and I was nervous about
 that and I wanted to remain grounded. And living in this part of New 
Jersey was something that was essential to who I was and continues to 
this day to be that way. <br>
So we've been recording this interview in your home studio. Would you 
just tell us a little bit about the studio? I mean, it was built for 
you.<br>
Patti built this studio. She, with some help. This was just part of our garage.<br>
<br>
Yes, because I'm looking through a curtain, the curtain's closed now, 
but when it was open, there was a big vintage car or truck or 
motorcycle.<br>
<br>
Yeah, there's a lot of motorcycles over there.<br>
<br>
Most studios don't have a garage attached to it like that.<br>
<br>
We're surrounded by vintage automobiles and motorcycles. But this piece 
of the garage, Patti said, "Well let's make a studio out of it," because
 we were using the house across the street to record in for a long time.
 And I said, "Okay, go ahead, see what it's about," and she just did an 
incredible job building this facility here.<br>
But it's like, if I had died when I was 15 and went to heaven, this is 
where I think I would have ended up. We're surrounded by guitars, 
keyboards, recording decks. It's just a paradise.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen, I can't thank you enough for inviting us into your 
studio and allowing us to do this interview. Thank you so much.<br>
<br>
Thank you so much, very enjoyable.<br>
<br>
And I really loved the book.<br>
<br>
Thanks a lot.</div>

<br>
BEN MACINTYRE<br>
October 7 2016,<br>
 The London Times</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
The Boss may loathe The Donald but blue-collar Americans who inspire his music are siding with the Republican tycoon<br>
<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen once remarked: “I spent most of my life as a musician 
measuring the distance between the American dream and the American 
reality.”<br>
<br>
That disillusioned space, the expanse between hope and truth, is where 
some of the key battles of the presidential election are being fought. 
The American white working class that Springsteen sings about is 
suffering badly, battered by unemployment, drugs and economic decay. Of 
the two candidates, Donald Trump has appealed far more successfully to 
the fears, resentments and patriotism of this key demographic.<br>
<br>
The Boss has strong opinions about The Donald. “The republic is under 
siege by a moron,” he told Rolling Stone magazine, adding that Trump 
offers “simple answers to very complex questions”. Hillary Clinton, he 
says, would make “a very, very good president”.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is the great bard of the American Rustbelt. In his music and
 newly published autobiography he explores the plight of the working 
man, the forgotten veterans, the failed relationships, and the sadness 
and hardiness of deindustrialised America. The book, Born to Run, charts
 the “joy and heartbreak of everyday life” Springsteen felt growing up 
in dead-end Freehold, New Jersey, and what it was like to live through 
“the Fifties blue-collar world and the Sixties social experience”. Above
 it all looms the troubled relationship with his father, an ill-tempered
 high school dropout who drifted from one bar and one low-grade job to 
another, sometimes a bus driver and sometimes a pool shark, but never 
really there.<br>
<br>
As a result, Springsteen’s song-writing is full of the longing for 
escape, the frustrated American dream (“Seems like you can’t get any 
more than half-free”, he sings in Straight Times), the urge for the open
 road and a fast car in a gritty landscape with “the skeleton frames of 
burned-out Chevrolets” in Thunder Road. In Adam Raised a Cain he recalls
 his father: “Daddy worked his whole life for nothing but the pain/ now 
he walks these empty rooms, looking for something to blame”.<br>
<br>
<br>
But there is also a dogged faith in America, despite all the 
disappointments, that runs through Springsteen’s music. “Lately there 
ain’t been much work,” he sings in The River, a ballad of unwanted 
pregnancy, shotgun marriage, unemployment, poverty and hope. The old 
river still carries the hope of renewal that “sends me down to the 
river/ Though I know the river is dry.” In his greatest anthem, Born to 
Run, he evokes a better, mythical America that is always just over the 
horizon: “We’re gonna get to that place/ Where we really want to go . . .
 tramps like us, baby we were born to run.”<br>
<br>
<br>
This is the political landscape Trump has colonised. A recent analysis 
in The New York Times found that many of the towns and cities in 
Springsteen songs were either Trump strongholds or places where the 
Republican candidate is making significant inroads. In the depressed 
blue-collar communities of western Pennsylvania evoked by The River, for
 example, Trump has a 20 per cent lead over Clinton among white voters 
without a college degree.<br>
<br>
These working-class, middle-aged Americans feel they have been left 
behind by modern culture and a modern economy, and are looked down on by
 the metropolitan elite on both coasts. Eight years under President 
Obama have deepened that anger: an economy that failed to produce enough
 fresh jobs, the legacy of two botched wars fought for causes that few 
could understand, and Wall Street banks bailed out while ordinary 
Americans lost their homes. Trump has skilfully channelled their 
apprehension about low-wage immigration and free trade into solid 
support for the Republican ticket. He has done this, in part, by 
“looking for something to blame”, namely Mexicans and Muslims.<br>
<br>
When Trump promises to Make America Great Again he is appealing to the 
citizens who recognise themselves in Springsteen’s lyrics, the same 
people who, however downtrodden, still believe they can reach a 
mythical, better country.<br>
<br>
“A price is being paid for not addressing the real cost of the 
deindustrialisation and globalisation that has occurred in the US . . . 
and how it’s deeply affected people’s lives and deeply hurt people.” The
 words are Springsteen’s but they could just as easily have been 
Trump’s, a multibillionaire real estate magnate with no real empathy for
 the struggling classes.<br>
<br>
Springsteen campaigned for John Kerry, the Democratic presidential 
hopeful, in 2004 and performed alongside Bill Clinton at a rally for 
Barack Obama in 2008. His political allegiances are clear but it is 
equally certain that Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party have 
failed to strike a chord with many of the Rustbelt voters who should be 
flocking to her standard.<br>
<br>
In Youngstown, Springsteen sang of the Ohio steel town, fallen on hard 
times. “Seven hundred tons of metal a day/ now sir you tell me the 
world’s changed.” Northeast Ohio was once a Democratic stronghold but 
support for Clinton among working-class voters has steadily eroded, to 
the point where this battleground state is now regarded as a likely win 
for Trump.<br>
<br>
The distance between the American dream and American reality continues 
to grow, and Bruce Springsteen continues to measure it with inspired 
music. But Hillary Clinton has not been listening properly, and Donald 
Trump has<br>

"The Realest Thing You’ve Ever Seen"<br>
<br>
Essay by Robert Christgau / October 19, 2016 </strong><br>
<br>
<br>
So what else was he going to call it, asked one reviewer of the big new 
Bruce Springsteen autobiography, Born to Run. “Born to Run,” as you may 
know, was the title song of the 1975 album that put Springsteen on 
the-covers of Time and Newsweek, whence he became the free-wheeling, 
hard-touring American hero we know today. But as often happens with this
 man of the people, the song is trickier than it appears — the lyric 
more about feeling trapped than breaking free, the music an exhilarating
 up that’s all about escape. You could say it’s too grand — Springsteen 
cites rebel-rousing guitar twanger Duane Eddy, operatic rockabilly Roy 
Orbison, and convicted megalomaniac Phil Spector as inspirations. But 
its grandeur is subsumed by the layered momentum of 85mph drums, 
blood-rousing piano, and tinkling glockenspiel. Is it true, as 
Springsteen feverishly declares, that he and Wendy plan to die together 
in their “suicide machines”? Only metaphorically, the music insists. 
They were born to run again — and then again.<br>
<br>
Of course, Springsteen could have chosen a parallel title more in 
keeping with his grandiose side: Born in the U.S.A., after the title 
song of the 1984 album he went deca-platinum on, which framed a dark 
antiwar lyric inside a solemn, deceptively martial groove. Although soon
 misprised by Ronald Reagan and lesser liars, it became the Ur-source 
all the Springsteen books whose titles sport phrases like “American 
poet,” “American song,” “American soul,” and the inevitable “American 
dream.” Yet Springsteen still called his autobio Born to Run, and 
properly so — he’s not really a pretentious guy, and anyway, the title 
serves to emphasize a running metaphor. More times than I had the wit to
 count, he feels compelled to get on his motorcycle or in his car and 
race around this U.S.A. he was born in, often for days or even weeks at a
 time. Then he comes home, generally in a better mood. After 30-plus 
years of psychotherapy, he’s still running.<br>
<br>
That’s right, psychotherapy. By now even his most ardent fans have 
figured out that their hero isn’t just a fun-loving bundle of energy 
fronting three-hour concerts that exhilarate you for your money, and in 
2012, David Remnick honored his complexity with a massive New Yorker 
profile in which therapy played a crucial role. But Born to Run doubles 
down on the gambit. It reads like it was written by an analysand — he 
thanks his shrink by name, in the text rather than the acknowledgments —
 and that’s good. This is someone who’s thought a lot about his 
upbringing, and not just the brooding father sitting in the dark kitchen
 with his six-pack and smokes who was a fixture of his stage patter from
 the beginning.<br>
<br>
Far more incisive than any biographer’s version, Springsteen’s account 
of his early years — say pre-Beatlemania, which hit when he was 14 — 
lasts over 50 pages. Although his parents both worked, his mother 
steadily as a legal secretary and his father usually as whatever he 
could get, to call the Springsteens lower-middle-class would be pushing 
it: when he was young, a single kerosene stove provided all the heat in 
the house. Yet his mother came from money even if it was damaged money —
 her thrice-married father was a lawyer who did three years in Sing Sing
 for embezzlement and held court thereafter in a proverbial house on the
 hill. But it’s even more striking that his paternal grandmother was 
young Bruce’s primary caregiver, indulging him so unstintingly that he 
refused to live with his parents even when he reached school age, 
sleeping down the block in his grandmother’s bed with his grandfather 
exiled to a cot across the room. “It was a place where I felt an 
ultimate security, full license and a horrible unforgettable 
boundary-less love. It ruined me and it made me.”<br>
<br>
There are no typical childhoods anyway, but this part of the book, which
 I wish was even longer, cracks through the working-class/South Jersey 
typology that has long encrusted Springsteen’s myth. It’s weird. And 
it’s written. Put aside your literary preconceptions and taste the two 
sentences I just quoted. They’re a mite awkward, the three commaless 
adjectives barely in control. But they make a big point loud and clear. 
Autobiographer Springsteen doesn’t command the brash fuck-you eloquence 
of rock memoirists Bob Dylan, Patti Smith, and Richard Hell, each quite 
distinct yet all of a piece in their aesthetic verve and acuity. He’s 
cornier. But there’s a life to his prose that such high-IQ rock 
autobiographers as Pete Townshend and Bob Mould don’t come near, a life 
redolent of the colloquial concentration and thematic sweep of his 
songwriting. Sure he bloviates sometimes. But the book moves and carries
 you along.<br>
<br>
In Remnick’s profile, Springsteen’s manager-for-life, intellectual 
mentor, and dear friend Jon Landau (who as the world’s wealthiest former
 rock critic could have supported more pages, though he gets his share) 
calls Springsteen “the smartest person I’ve ever known.” Intimates could
 probably say the same of Dylan, Smith, Hell, for that matter Townshend 
and Mould. But never think Springsteen has less brain power than these 
art heroes. Insofar as his book is corny, that’s a conscious aesthetic 
choice he’s made for the entirety of his career. It’s just that as he’s 
matured he’s gotten more conscious about it — and even smarter. Sure 
he’s all about Jersey, as he should be. But his first Jersey was the 
late-’60s one, where a hospital in Neptune refused to treat the head 
injury of a long-haired teen named Bruce who came in after a serious 
motorcycle accident — there are outsiders everywhere, and the longhair 
gravitated to them and knows he owes them. Moreover, he tenders many 
thanks to Greenwich Village — as a human being, because it bristled with
 life-changing alternatives to Jersey’s manifold limitations, and as an 
artist, because its poesy-spouting singer-songwriters and bohemian 
esprit lured him far enough away from his home turf to reflect on it 
with perspective.<br>
<br>
Born to Run is a true autobiography, a thorough factual account of the 
author’s life until now. But since it’s an artist’s autobiography, it 
can’t do that job of work without telling us stuff about his art. For 
some this might mean the 12 out of 79 chapters whose italicized titles 
match those of albums he deems worthy of individual attention, which I 
found merely useful except as regards his overrated post-9/11 The 
Rising, which indicates that much of it was written pre-attack and then 
retrofitted to the catastrophe New Jersey’s poet laureate felt compelled
 to address, where the much sharper 2012 Wrecking Ball was protest music
 from its conception. Others will savor the celebrity gossip that’s 
always a selling point of these books — Sinatra knowing a paisan when he
 sees one, or “the GREATEST GARAGE BAND IN THE WORLD” prepping his 
“Tumbling Dice” cameo at their 2012 Newark show with a single 
five-minute rehearsal space run-through that blows his fanboy mind. But 
for me both were dwarfed by his reflections on persona and performance.<br>
<br>
Never in Born to Run does Springsteen claim the mantle of “authenticity”
 he’s forever saddled with. “In the second half of the twentieth 
century, `authenticity’ would be what you made of it, a hall of 
mirrors,” he says, but also, mirror fans: “Of course I thought I was a 
phony — that is the way of the artist — but I also thought I was the 
realest thing you’d ever seen.” And if you’d prefer your analysis 
straighter, there’s: “I, who’d never done a week’s worth of manual labor
 in my life (hail, hail rock ‘n’ roll!), put on a factory worker’s 
clothes, my father’s clothes, and went to work.” No matter how you slice
 it, it’s an act, or to use a word he loves, a show: “You don’t TELL 
people anything, you SHOW them, and let them decide.” To convince them, 
he works hard, Jack, exerting himself as unrelentingly as any manual 
laborer, because only the audience’s boundary-less love can satisfy that
 deep, ruinous emotional hunger. Yet what you think you see is not 
necessarily what you’re getting. The book’s most dazzling single passage
 is a phantasmagoric two-page recollection of the frighteningly 
self-conscious “multiple personalities” who battled within him during 
his very first European performance, at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 
1975. Ordeal over, he returns to his hotel room “underneath a cloud of 
black crows” and feeling like a failure. Only he was wrong — the 
performance became legendary, and when he worked up the guts to watch 
film of it 30 years later all he saw was “a tough but excellent set.”<br>
<br>
Impinging even on these aesthetic reflections, however, you’ll notice 
the familial history that provides not only this full autobiography’s 
substratum but its true subject. You may want more about, say, Pete 
Townshend, who is quoted fruitfully on how the rock band makes de facto 
family members out of people you happen to meet as a kid, and his old 
pal Steve Van Zandt gets plenty of ink, as do departed saxophone 
colossus Clarence Clemons and departed organ grinder Danny Federici. But
 Springsteen leaves no doubt that although the show is his lifeline and 
he may die running, his love life in the broadest sense is what got 509 
pages out of him. Offstage he’s been loved and loving from an early age,
 but between his unconditional grandmother and his silent father, 
learning to stick at it has been quite the sentimental education. 
Clearly Dr. Myers was his best teacher until he finally settled on 
homegirl turned backup singer Patti Scialfa in 1988 and married her in 
1991. But although he’s not bragging, much of the credit redounds to 
him.<br>
<br>
Full autobiographies generally portray elders more acutely than youngers
 for the obvious reason that the elders are dead — they can’t stop you 
and their feelings won’t get hurt. But in Born to Run, Bruce’s father 
Doug ends up packing more mojo than Van Zandt or Landau or Clemons or 
even Scialfa, and that’s unusual. The story returns to Doug when it 
doesn’t have to — no one would have missed that fishing trip. The 
account of his senescence, when he was finally diagnosed with not one 
but two major psychological disorders, is topped off with a bravura 
description of his body — “elephant stumps for calves and clubs for 
feet” — in the final hours of his life. Which in turn is topped by a 
briefer tribute to Bruce’s miraculous mother, still radiating “a warmth 
and exuberance the world as it is may not merit” as she navigates 
Alzheimer’s at 91.<br>
<br>
Scialfa doesn’t resonate as vividly as his parents — discretion no doubt
 intervened, and is presumably why the redolently homely divorce case 
naming Bruce as a respondent goes unmentioned. Nonetheless, she’s the 
silent hero of this book. Springsteen was never a dog, but from his 
teens he was a serial monogamist with lapses who acknowledges with less 
vanity than chagrin that he went through a lot of women, including his 
first wife, the model Julianne Phillips. Scialfa benefited from Dr. 
Myers’s spadework as well as the failed Phillips experiment. She’s no 
beacon of calm because that wouldn’t work at all — she’d better the hell
 stand up to him. But she gives her husband the superstar version of a 
normal life he’s clearly craved since a childhood that taught him he 
couldn’t have one — a life both his maturing art and his everyman 
politics impelled him toward. Even the three kids are richly described, 
with discretion deftly served by focusing on their very different early 
years — in a passage few autobiographers would adjudge worth their 
literary while, Scialfa jawbones him first into getting up with the kids
 and learning to make pancakes and then into giving young Sam his 
late-night bottle-and-story. As he puts it: “She inspired me to be a 
better man, turning the dial way down on my running while still leaving 
me room to move.”<br>
<br>
Born to run, yet happy with room to move. The artist’s story is worth telling. But so is the man’s.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen: More or less than The Boss?<br>
Will Gompertz<br>
BBC Arts editor<br>
19 October 2016</strong><br>
<br>
What can I possibly tell you about Bruce Springsteen that you might not already know? Certainly nothing about his attire.<br>
<br>
He wears the standard issue rock 'n' roll three-piece: jeans, t-shirt, 
and a black leather jacket, accessorised - in his case - with biker 
boots, earrings, and stories of working class life in post-war New 
Jersey.<br>
<br>
Then there's the usual rolling stone-type stuff about the compulsion to 
tour, about the "mind-numbing power of my rock 'n' roll meds", and about
 the love of a good woman, Patti, "queen of my heart". You know about 
the cock-sure kid who became an angst-ridden adult, about the boy with a
 taciturn father who performed to get attention, about the "fraud" who 
became a "hardworking journeyman".<br>
<br>
You know the script. He knows the script. It is the script. There is 
only one. But then there was an off-script surprise - for me, at least -
 that showed The Boss and Bruce to be very different animals.<br>
<br>
Bruce has - and I don't mean this as a criticism at all - very little 
presence. Almost zero. Which I found surprising. It's not just because 
of his media status as a "legend", "megastar", "icon" - which engenders 
its own presumptions in an interviewer, and you would have thought must 
have an effect on an interviewee's sense of self.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen on stage is all an ego-driven rock star should be.<br>
<br>
But it's also the fact that this is a guy who earns his living from 
standing in front of tens of thousands of adoring fans and royally 
entertaining them for epic four-hour stretches. You've got to have some 
persona wattage to pull that off for more than 40 years.<br>
But he hasn't, not in Bruce mode, anyway.<br>
<br>
'Toxic confusion'<br>
<br>
The self-proclaimed egotist is self-effacing to the point of 
awkwardness. On Monday I watched him in-conversation on-stage with the 
Gallic journalist and one-time Eurotrash presenter Antoine de Caunes.<br>
<br>
The room was packed with journalists, many of whom had travelled far and
 wide to hear Springsteen speak, but there was only one star showing off
 at the event, and he was French. I thought it might be a coy-boy thing 
they had going on - they're old friends. But no. When I met him, he was 
just the same.<br>
<br>
Springsteen came into the smart hotel room that had been designated for 
our sit-down interview as if to collect the breakfast tray. Bashfulness 
doesn't do it. Honestly, if I hadn't known who he was, I would have said
 "not now please".<br>
<br>
To be clear, most "stars" are not like this. I'm not saying they come 
into the room all personality guns blazing (unless they are called Aaron
 Sorkin), but there is usually a palpable sense of "an arrival". Their 
presence changes the mood, it causes folk to sit-up: there's a tension, a
 frisson. Which does makes Springsteen's humility remarkable.<br>
He is throttled back, low-profile, quiet; thoughtful. More. He is 
nervous. I got the sense that Bruce is his Clark Kent who - by picking 
up a microphone and guitar - can transform himself, Superman-like, into 
The Boss.<br>
<br>
The Boss would surely never succumb to mental illness, so I imagine it 
is the introspective aspect of Bruce's nature that has been partially 
responsible for the "toxic confusion" that led to a crippling depression
 that affected him in his 30s and in his 60s.<br>
Sensitive and empathetic<br>
It is also the reason, I think, that he has been able to write personal 
songs with such universal appeal. When you meet him you realise that 
Springsteen is as much a seer as he is a singer.<br>
His non-performing comfort zone is not holding court in public, but 
watching from the shadows: observing unseen and unheard. He is a 
sensitive and empathetic storyteller.<br>
The basis of his creativity, he says, is this duality of character. It 
comes from the dramatic and inspirational coming together of his 
opposing psychological states: between the "phony" and "the realest 
thing you'd ever see", the introvert and the showman; Bruce and The 
Boss.<br>
<br>
I guess one writes the songs; the other performs them.<br>
<br>
Like all partnerships, it has its own problems, which he explores with 
notable honesty in his autobiography Born To Run, but by and large it 
seems to have worked out reasonably well for him and his fans.</div>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">It’s my birthday, October 7th 1987.</strong><br>
<br>
I am in a phone booth outside a crab shack off the New Jersey Turnpike 
begging some Wall Street guy for mercy. Nowadays of course one would 
know better, but this was way before they took the gloves off and 
destroyed the global economy with a controlled demolition of derivative 
fraud.  You may not remember phone booths, but they were everywhere 
before cell phone. This one was useless, its plastic half dome did 
nothing to keep the rain off, especially when you are literally on your 
knees begging for mercy.<br>
<br>
His  wife had agreed to rent the kitchen of her mansion as our location.
  Wall Street had just come back from a business trip and freaked out 
when his wife told him that Springsteen and a film crew were coming for 
breakfast. He was having none of it. His wife and I worked on him in 
turns. She was a nice woman and a huge Bruce fan. He clearly didn’t give
 a damn.<br>
<br>
“You don’t understand what the effect of this is going to be,  I am on 
my knees begging you to reconsider, please… its my birthday ….. please 
reconsider…..”<br>
<br>
At the same time I could hear his wife pleading with him in the 
background.  Eventually he just hangs up on me, leaving me on my knees, 
his dial tone dead  in my ear, as the trucks on the turnpike steamed 
through the Jersey rain.<br>
<br>
It’s now 8pm, the night before the shoot. The NY teamsters are already loaded up for their 6 AM call. We are proper fucked.<br>
<br>
“Is that me baby or just a brilliant disguise”<br>
<br>
 <strong class="text-strong">Two months earlier, late summer 1987.<br>
</strong><br>
I get one of those dream phone calls out of the blue. It’s Jon Landau 
asking me to go to New York and meet Springsteen to pitch ideas for a 
video for the first single from the new album, “Brilliant Disguise”.<br>
<br>
I had been a Springsteen fan since since first hearing him sing the line
 “..  and the elephants dance real funky”  against Garry Tallent’s  daft
 tuba part on “Wild Billy’s Circus Story” in 1973.  Here’s a beautiful 
live version of this song .<br>
<br>
Here I have to confess that I had shot two videos with Nils Lofgren’s  
for his Flip ” album in 1985. The less said about them the better, and I
 have to assume that Bruce had never seen them.  Nils is a guitar genius
 in his own right, eclipsed by  the shadow of a giant, or two. One good 
thing that came out of that experience was a day climbing in the Wicklow
 mountains with Nils.  We climbed Mullacor and looked down into 
Glendalough, the Omphalos, navel of the world.<br>
<br>
Now it all makes perfect sense to me, as I understand that Ireland is a 
magical microcosm of the rest of the world, the meta-universe in a sod 
of turf. Back then I didn’t know that that  Co. Wicklow was the 
spiritual mini-me of New Jersey, and Bray was Asbury Park. Fossetts’ 
Circus had the same mangy characters.  Springsteen is half Irish.  
Madame Marie’s father was a traveler from Tinahealy way.<br>
<br>
I had always dreamed of running off with the circus. Now was my chance.<br>
<br>
 <strong class="text-strong">Background</strong><br>
<br>
By ’87 Bruce was the greatest rock artist in the world. He had retreated
 from public view following the record breaking “Born in The USA” albums
 and tours.  “Brilliant Disguise” was to be the first single from his 
new record. Feature film legends Brian de Palma and  John Sales had shot
 previous Springsteen videos. Everyone and his monkey wanted to shoot 
the new videos.  This was a a life changing opportunity for a director 
fresh off the boat. The only chance I had was to to come up with a 
perfect and unexpected video concept that was true to the song, the 
singer, and the times.<br>
<br>
I do a lot of research and strategic thinking about videos. The choice 
of this dark, introspective song as the first single was a clue to 
Springsteen’s frame of mind. He clearly wasn’t interested in going head 
to head with  his prior work, especially “Born in the USA”, which had 
paced Michael Jackson’s Thriller with 7 top ten singles.   This choice 
of lead single was a position statement to a worldwide  audience who saw
 Bruce as a rock and roll god. The human cannon ball was now back on 
earth, beginning over. The lyrics were intensely psychological and 
personal, a total departure from the archetype rich, mythological 
American narrative song cycles of his past.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The Treatment</strong><br>
<br>
For me the treatment writing process starts with getting rid of as many 
blind alleys as possible. Strip out the unlikely, the unworkable, the 
unoriginal, and what remains is what you have to start from. The clues 
were there.  If Springsteen had wanted a story video he would choose 
Sales or any number of great movie directors to shoot it. The new album 
was billed as a solo project without the official E Street Band, so he 
wouldn’t want a band performance driven video. Visual effects were out 
of place. I don’t usually like masks and theatrics in videos, and I 
really don’t do well directing videos with mimed soap opera narrative 
and “illustrated radio” in general.<br>
<br>
It was rumored that Springsteen wasn’t comfortable with the artifice of 
the video production process itself.  That narrowed down the 
possibilities, and left me with nothing.<br>
<br>
I go to work on the complex lyrics. A video should serve the song first,
 then the artist, and finally marketing. Springsteen was using song 
writing as therapy, a tool for personal growth. The lyrics were about 
marriage, but also a metaphor in the wider context of his public image. 
The song is about deception, doubt, and ultimately staring down one’s 
fear of the shadow lurking behind one’s persona, both onstage and in 
private. With Springsteen everything is connected, inside and out, this 
is what makes him a great  artist and a great man.<br>
<br>
The trigger to the video concept was in the choruses:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">So when you look at me<br>
<br>
you better look hard and look twice<br>
<br>
Is that me baby<br>
<br>
or just a brilliant disguise?</em><br>
<br>
Springsteen is a master of song structure. Among other techniques, he 
will sometimes subtly change the chorus to advance the narrative, or 
peel away its meaning to reveal a new one. The words of each chorus can 
have small but progressive differences. The phrasing remains the same, 
so you don’t consciously realize what he is doing. The chorus in 
“Brilliant Disguise” starts as a defensive,  heavily armored question to
 a partner, but ends as a narcissist’s dark mirror reflecting his own 
doubts back on himself. Providing the soul-birthing realization that you
 are unable to fool yourself, without someone else there equally willing
 and able to be to fooled by you.<br>
<br>
“Brilliant Disguise” is a very Jungian lyric.<br>
<br>
I imagined watching the man as he wrote and sang the song for the first 
time to a lover. This was one of the great performers, doing an autopsy 
on both of the corpses in the relationship, with words as his scalpel.<br>
<br>
So what to pitch? Sometimes all the director needs to do is get himself 
and his bag of tricks out of the way. I only had to provide a safe 
creative performance environment for Springsteen, and then have the 
camera relentlessly scrutinize his face for the truth, just as a 
deceived lover does. Catch the tension between deception and honesty in 
the lyrics shattering the singer’s persona. Catch his growing 
recognition of the darkness inside as it plays out on the iconic 
landscape of his own face. Watch the brilliant disguises being cut away 
right in front to us.<br>
<br>
Who in the audience could resist the opportunity to peer right into 
Bruce’s eyes, and ultimately recognize themselves there. What I was 
watching in my mind was one long camera move, starting as the POV of the
 woman to whom the song is addressed, then imperceptibly becoming a 
mirror in which Springsteen confronts his own part in their inability to
 love.<br>
<br>
I knew instantly I was now officially a f#cking genius, and that this 
anti-concept was the one that would unlock the project for me. I was 
going to pitch Bruce’s face, to his face.  I instinctively felt that 
Springsteen would love the idea. It was ballsy, it had not yet been done
 as far as I knew.  It was true to the song and to the man at that 
moment. It turned every  expectation its head, would make everything 
else on MTV look overproduced, and would free him from the impossible 
expectations of topping Born in The USA, which by now was becoming a 
prison of doubled irony and misinterpretation. There would be no way to 
escape the meaning and truth of this song.<br>
<br>
Best of all the final lines of the song:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">God have mercy on the man who doubts what he’s sure of.</em><br>
<br>
… would  be delivered in an extreme close up, become the dark redemption
 of the video, rather than wasted on some throwaway shot of an ending.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Live Vocals</strong><br>
<br>
Looking at his earlier videos, I got the feeling that lip syncing wasn’t
 Bruce’s strong suite, and this resulted in the video performances 
feeling less authentic than the song itself.  This was probably where 
his discomfort with the video process came from. A fake performance 
would be a fatal problem with this concept, as there was nowhere to hide
 and the disguise had to be brilliant. I had shot a live vocal video 
with Mike Scott of The Waterboys.  I wondered if shooting Bruce’s vocals
 live might be viable, especially given the one take visual. Most album 
vocals are not recorded in one take, even on “live” albums.   There 
would also be some technical challenges as I did not want a microphone 
in front of his face, but hey, this was normal in the film industry and 
we had boom operators and directional mikes.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Letters at 3AM</strong><br>
<br>
The idea for the setting came easily.  Michael Ventura, great, largely 
unsung American writer, writes a a series of essays called Letters at 3 
AM, then for the LA Weekly. Conscious writing on many subjects.  Out of 
that title came the image of Springsteen,  writing the song downstairs 
in his kitchen in New Jersey at 3 AM, while his wife sleeps alone 
upstairs. The kitchen was archetypal, everything good and bad in family 
verbal interaction happens in the kitchen.  For the set dressing I saw 
post-war mythological Americana, formica and aluminum.  In some way it 
is also Springsteen’s parent’s kitchen. Certainly this was an older and 
wiser Bruce Springsteen we were going to shoot.<br>
<br>
 <strong class="text-strong">The Pitch</strong><br>
<br>
I get on a plane from LA to New York with a light heart, looking forward
 to meeting the man. It’s my first visit to New York, and its visually 
overwhelming from the bridge on. NY still gives me vertigo every time.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The taxi drops me outside Jon Landau and Bruce’s office.<br>
</strong><br>
To my surprise Bruce is in the elevator when I get in. White T Shirt, 
blue jeans, boots, every inch Bruce Springsteen, in person. He is at a 
disadvantage, having no idea what I look like, but we work it out on the
 way up to Landau’s office. Springsteen in person is exactly what you 
would expect from his lyrics: warm, direct, funny, perceptive and 
gracious. Thankfully his self-confidence is infectious.<br>
<br>
When I have to talk to more than one stranger at a time my Social 
Anxiety Disorder kicks in and I suffer an unpleasant dissociative tunnel
 vision effect. It’s quite trippy but not conducive to verbal 
communication, especially combined with its matching acoustic FX. Many 
people have the same problem.<br>
<br>
Landau, Barbara Carr, and Jack Rovner were waiting in the office for us. Their warmth and humor dissolved my discomfort.<br>
<br>
The pitch went well. For once I knew how to describe each shot. This 
didn’t take long. as there was only one. My understanding of the 
psychology behind the lyrics was accurate. Springsteen jumped on the 
idea of shooting the vocals live, rather than having to lip-sync  Both 
Rovner and Springsteen shared the same general strategic agenda for the 
video. They wanted to keep it as simple as possible. I had read their 
minds from a distance. Bruce embraced how performing the song in one 
uninterrupted take would leave him, and the viewer, with nowhere to 
hide. They even agreed to shoot in black and white with Carlo Di Palma 
as DP.<br>
<br>
Next thing, I am back on the sidewalk with my head in the clouds, with some first world cinematic problems to sort out.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Math</strong><br>
<br>
I knew I wanted Bruce sitting in a real kitchen, and the camera move was
 going to be defined by optical physics and the location itself. I 
wanted the shot to end on an extreme close up of Bruce’s eyes.  The on 
screen zoom isn’t a purist’s tool, but it would be necessary to get the 
extreme close up at the end. The change in focal length would also 
change the compression of the image and subtly transform the feel of the
 viewer’s experience from someone in the room’s POV, to a private 
introspective self scrutiny.<br>
<br>
<br>
I had researched Carlo Di Palma’s choreographed takes for Woody Allen, 
and was a fan of Antonioni’s Red Dawn. Di Palma was an expert at 
shooting long scenes, avoiding coverage and cutting. Carlo also had a 
reputation for liking zoom lenses, rather than the primes that many 
fashionable DP’s are more comfortable with. He was now living and 
shooting in New York, and had a solid New York crew.<br>
<br>
<br>
I meet up with Carlo in the Algonquin Hotel.  The man is a legend, and 
like Springsteen, has no pretense about him. His father had been a 
camera operator, and he had grown up on the set watching his father at 
work. Carlo had lived though the  glory days of Italian cinema. He had 
shot “Blow Up”, a film that created a new way of telling stories.  That 
was just the beginning of his life’s work.<br>
<br>
I am in awe, but he graciously takes me seriously, and our music video 
project to heart. Carlo approached it as a scene from a movie. He wanted
 to understand the lyrics, the performer’s motivation, as well as the 
wider context. He must have wondered why I boarded a single shot video, 
but kept a straight face throughout.<br>
<br>
There are two types of DP. The first kind asks: “so where does the 
camera go?”. This can be a threatening question, and always floors me 
for a moment, especially after only a few hours sleep.  A handy reflex 
answer to this question is:  ”Give me a few minutes to block the scene, 
and we’ll work it out”.<br>
<br>
The second kind of DP actually directs the photography. Meaning he takes
 creative responsibility for all aspects of the image itself, and 
becomes your partner and best friend on the set.<br>
<br>
Carlo is clearly a real DP, and a generous collaborator. I leave the image in his hands.<br>
<br>
We work out the math: what speed the camera move needed to be, what kind
 of crane and track we would need, what focal lengths would be 
appropriate, and therefore how large the kitchen would have to be for 
the equipment and crew required to make the shot.<br>
<br>
The logical answer was “we had better build a set”, but instinctively I 
know Springsteen is going to feel and perform the song way better in a 
“real world” kitchen setting. We just had to find one large enough.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Scouting New Jersey</strong><br>
<br>
One of the best parts of the director’s job is that you get to visit all
 kinds of places and people that you would never see otherwise.<br>
<br>
Ben Dossett and I  scout locations all over New Jersey. A multi-day 
caravan of mansions, schools, and hospitals. Eventually we find a 
mansion with a large kitchen that could just about work. The woman who 
owned the house was a fan and happy to have Bruce come over.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the budget was hammered out. It costs a lot to look this 
cheap. To put it another way, once you start down the one shot path 
there is zero tolerance for error of any kind. You have to budget for 
perfection. Which brings me back to that dial tone.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">8 pm, the night before the shoot.</strong><br>
<br>
I am in a phone booth by the Jersey Turnpike, seriously considering suicide.<br>
<br>
The location has fallen through.  What do you do?  Ben calls everyone we
 can reach in production in NY to see if they know somewhere in the 
Tri-State that might work. Eventually, a cop car pulls in and we explain
 the problem.  The cop suggests calling the National Guard and gives us 
their number. Not a terrible idea, especially as by now they are about 
the only people still answering the phone. Of course they turn out to be
 fans and within two hours we were standing in an old kitchen in an 
empty officer’s house on a mothballed army base.<br>
<br>
It was perfect in every way.<br>
<br>
The huge kitchen opened directly into the even larger dining room. Total
 security, loads of parking for the trucks, no valuables to damage, no 
neighbors to annoy. A blizzard of phone calls follows. We fax out new 
call sheets from the base. Suicidal ideation slipped into the shadows to
 lurk for another day.<br>
<br>
That was by far the worst crisis I have ever had on a production.  Music
 video production is like running a circus, except each show is the 
first show. You are driving a fresh cast of clowns down the midway, 
while the clown car falls apart beneath you. It can get very scary, 
especially on location.<br>
<br>
You have to be a self-destructive, risk taking clown to survive it. That
 night I learned that almost anything can be fixed if you just don’t 
give up. Since then, when the wheels fall off,  I remember that night, 
and honk the clown car horn. Don’t ever give up.<br>
<br>
We get back to the motel at 2:30am to find the manager has barricaded 
himself into his office, with our room keys, and passed out.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The Shoot</strong><br>
<br>
The shoot was initially about solving the human and technical 
practicalities of the four and a half minute move. I wanted the camera 
to have no presence at all, the move so slow as to be unnoticed. It’s a 
crane move. Jibbing down as it dollies in with an imperceptible zoom 
nested in the move.<br>
<br>
Carlo lit the shot in a classic cinematic chiaroscuro style, a single 
key in the only possible place. There was no eye light, yet there is 
light in the eyes. There’s no crane or camera shadow, yet the camera is 
right in Bruce’s face at the end. Simple genius.<br>
<br>
The crew were all experienced feature people and enjoy the challenge of 
making difficult crane shots. This one was, and still is, unique.  To 
make the shot a dozen people would have to do everything right, in 
perfect sync with each other, for every moment of four and a half 
minutes.<br>
<br>
Bruce’s performances were almost all perfect.<br>
<br>
The rest of us struggled to do everything right. The first challenge is 
the stability and smoothness of the move.  The crane is a massive steel 
girder balanced on a pivot, the camera on one end heavily 
counterbalanced with lead weights on the other. Its a beast pushed by 
two, but its mass makes it surprisingly forgiving once on the move. Then
 this trebuchet has to be brought to an imperceptible stop on a dime, 
inches from the performer’s eyes.<br>
<br>
The camera meanwhile is gently descending and adjusting on two axes.  
Focus has to be corrected continually. Accurate focus is critical, 
especially on Bruce’s eyes at the end of the move. Consider that the 
f-stop is wide open for maximum Bokeh, the depth of field is less than 
an inch or two, and Bruce is inevitably moving back and forth as he 
sings.  Doing it in one shot, without cuts, had seemed like a good idea,
 but I now fully understood the risk we were taking. Up on the high wire
 without a net.<br>
<br>
The physical and psychological tension in the room was palpable. 
Everyone in the camera, grip, and lighting crews had something at stake 
in each take. The live vocals added a whole other electrifying dimension
 to the room . The crew let out a sigh of relief and applauded at the 
end of each good take.  Springsteen picked up on this energy 
immediately, a master in his element as a live performer, not a 
lip-syncing muppet.<br>
<br>
Toby Scott, Bruce’s sound engineer was beginning to relax. Landau was 
affably inscrutable, but I have learned that this is a good sign. Terry 
McGovern gave me a smile, and suddenly all was well in the world.<br>
<br>
We shot twenty four takes, with a just a few good for camera. Bruce nailed it on most.<br>
<br>
I like directing best when I can help the artist re-define the lyrics. 
Just a smile or a glance  in the right place can change the whole 
meaning of a verse. As we got into it, Springsteen re-interpreted the 
song in various ways, ranging from sadly humorous to bitter and angry.  
Like any good story it improved with the telling, even though the words 
remained the same.  Almost thirty years down the road if you watch 
Springsteen sing “Brilliant Disguise” live, with Patti Scailfa’s 
harmonies, the song reveals depths of human fragility. It’s no longer a 
breakup song, but has become a compassionate and very moving love song.<br>
<br>
As for the video, it stands the test of time. When I watch it,  its just
 me and Bruce face to face. The spell never breaks. There is no clue 
that there are thirty people in the room and a ton of metal inching its 
way down the track towards Bruce.  Film making.<br>
<br>
There is no feeling in the world quite like wrapping a shoot when its gone well.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Editorial</strong><br>
<br>
Editing the video was an unexpected challenge.  Nothing to cut,  just 
one choice to make. Of the four or five takes that were good for camera,
 each vocal was a unique interpretation, so selecting the best involved 
dropping others that would never be seen again. In the end I choose the 
take where Springsteen’s self-awareness was most present and the camera 
was least present.  It would be great to see it remastered in HD. There 
are performance details on the negative that have never been seen.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">MTV</strong><br>
<br>
Tom Freston and John Sykes dug it. MTV played the hell out of it. The 
video confounded public expectations, as planned, and yet still 
connected with the MTV audience. It opened up the genre to all kinds of 
more artful videos. I went on to shoot several videos more with Bruce.<br>
<br>
Flashing forward to 2013, this video could probably never happen now. 
Record companies like to keep artists and directors apart. Video 
concepts are filtered through commissioners and marketing departments, 
subject to commercial priorities.<br>
<br>
Risky ideas are safely disposed of before they get to the artist. As a 
result, directors now tend to write to target marketing objectives 
rather than serve the song itself. It’s also a bad time for rock music 
in general. Rock bands are expensive to maintain compared to rap or solo
 artists. Rock music is more expensive to record. To a large degree 
popular taste is molded by this kind of cost analysis.<br>
<br>
Today Springsteen might well have been dropped before Born in the USA was ever recorded.<br>

<br>
LA Times<br>
October 28, 2016<br>
<br>
Jeffrey Fleishman</span><br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">“These mills they built the tanks and bombs that won this country’s wars”</em> —&nbsp;Bruce Springsteen, “Youngstown” <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Bob Wilson was coming of age when sulfur stung the night sky and the 
valley glowed with molten steel. Scarfers hissed,&nbsp;slag cooled, 
unions marched like armies and train tracks knew no rust. Weeks were 
flush with paychecks and promises in a potent vision of America that 
would vanish before Wilson stepped too far into manhood<br>
<br>
You could watch it all from a bridge,” said Wilson, an auto mechanic 
with the deep gaze of a marksman. “Hot ladles and steel and men working.
 Then it was gone.”<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen immortalized the nobility of men who once stood before
 the furnaces and the betrayals of a collapsing steel industry. His 1995
 song “Youngstown,” a poetic elegy in a vast working-class canon, is 
still revered by the city that inspired it<br>
<br>
But many of the machinists,&nbsp; miners and laborers who embody 
Springsteen’s lyrics from the Rust Belt to the Appalachian coal fields 
have turned to the swagger of Donald Trump in a long-denied bid for 
redemption. Springsteen’s politics may have stayed liberal since he 
played Stambaugh Auditorium here two decades ago,&nbsp;but economic 
decline, foreign competition, crime and abandoned mills have turned many
 in Youngstown —&nbsp;notably blue-collar white men&nbsp; —&nbsp;toward 
the right-wing, isolationist politics of a billionaire reality-TV show 
star.<br>
<br>
“I call it the pissed-off steel workers party. A lot of people like 
someone who causes trouble. That’s why Trump is so popular,” said 
Wilson, sitting in the dim of his hillside shop in the slipping away 
hours of a warm afternoon. &nbsp;“Why am I voting for him? He’s not 
Hillary Clinton.”&nbsp;He smiled, turned the radio low. “You know, my 
entire adult life I’ve been voting for the lesser of two evils.”<br>
<br>
A little farther down the Mahoning River, where scrap metal shone dull 
in the thicket and broken pallets were scattered like bones, Bill 
Skinner climbed down from polishing the top of his truck and told the 
rag&nbsp;man he’d pay him something next week. He pulled off his gloves,
 lighted a cigarette and railed that Muslims want to impose Islamic law,
 political correctness imperils masculinity and jobs keep dying or 
getting sent to Mexico or China.<br>
<br>
Steel is wiped out and Obama is wiping out the coal and mining 
industries.&nbsp;Hillary wants to finish what he started. Our country is
 $20 trillion in debt.&nbsp;America has gone from the toilet to the 
sewer, ” he said. “Hillary and anyone connected to her should be in 
jail. If anyone’s going to stop this nonsense, it’s a guy from the 
outside.”<br>
Unlike President Reagan, who in the 1980s invoked the “Born in the 
U.S.A.”-era&nbsp;Springsteen&nbsp; as a symbol of hope, Trump, who is 
running a tight race with Clinton in Ohio, has not celebrated the 
singer. Springsteen is a progressive who campaigned relentlessly for 
President Obama. His vision of the country is a communion of ragged, 
defiant and giving souls who find shared meaning in sacrifice and 
restless glimmers of ungraspable dreams.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;In a recent interview with British television, he called Trump “a 
con man” and a “flagrant, toxic narcissist.” But he acknowledged that 
much of the nation —&nbsp; like characters in his songs “The River” and 
“Death to My Hometown” —&nbsp; feels battered by Wall Street and 
abandoned by the Democratic and Republican parties.<br>
“You have 30 to 40 years of de-industrialization and globalization of 
the economy, so there are a lot of people who were left out of that,” 
Springsteen said. “Voices have been fundamentally ignored and not heard.
 These are folks who feel Donald Trump has been listening to them and 
speaks for them on some level.”<br>
<br>
Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan, Marvin Gaye, Neil Young and other songwriters 
have articulated the upheavals and divisions that have shaken the land. 
Wars, poverty, civil rights, prescription drug abuse and police 
shootings of black men rouse and reveal the national conscience and 
alter the political landscape.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s words and voice —&nbsp; the rasp of a corner boy grown 
into a man —&nbsp; are rooted in a childhood shaped by factory myths, 
yearnings and disappointments, a tormented and bruising father and a New
 Jersey that would abide no weakness. Those themes and a desire to 
champion the ones who dwell in the “darkness at the edge of town” 
buttress his new memoir, “Born to Run.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
“There’s anger in a lot of his songs, that feeling of helplessness of 
being caught beneath the wheels of American commerce,” said&nbsp; Peter 
Ames Carlin, who wrote the 2012 Springsteen biography, “Bruce.” “A 
political consciousness runs through all his music.&nbsp; He speaks 
about a society that has gone off the rails. The lives of his parents, 
extended family and friends. These blue-collar people who got screwed at
 every turn.”<br>
<br>
The song “Youngstown” distills that sentiment with the echoes of working
 men forsaken by corporations and foreign competition that cost the city
 more than 40,000 manufacturing jobs beginning in 1977: “From the 
Monongahela Valley/To the Mesabi iron range/To the coal mines of 
Appalachia/The story’s always the same/Seven-hundred tons of metal a 
day/Now sir you tell me the world’s changed/Once I made you rich 
enough/Rich enough to forget my name.”<br>
<br>
Such indignities represent Trump’s wellspring among the bitter and 
bewildered sons and grandsons of European immigrants who prospered 
during America’s industrial age.&nbsp;Trump has fallen behind in the 
polls, but his protective trade policies, law-and-order promises and 
anti-immigration rhetoric of walls and deportations have resonated in 
Ohio. In Mahoning County, a traditional Democrat bastion the includes 
Youngstown, the number of Republican voters more&nbsp;than doubled to 
about 36,000 after the March primary.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
“Trump says stuff that is coarse and rough-and-tumble like we are.&nbsp;
 Closing the borders and stopping [Islamic State] is enough for some 
people,” said Dan Rivers, a conservative radio talk show host on WKBN-AM
 (570) in Youngstown. Rivers noted a number of Trump’s comments, 
especially about women, have been “indefensible … but even with all his 
faults, I believe he’s better than Hillary Clinton, and that’s the 
sentiment of the audience.”<br>
<br>
Of Springsteen, he said, “Bruce supports a lot of liberal causes, but 
conservatives give him a pass. He’s an icon.&nbsp;He's done so much 
good. They think he’s a true working-class guy.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">A broken town</strong><br>
<br>
Driving into Youngstown is a glimpse into&nbsp;the brokenness of a once 
better place. The Uptown Theater is boarded up;&nbsp;check cashing 
stores flash indifference;&nbsp;the word bankruptcy shines in law office
 windows; weeds tangle a gas station for sale; and beyond&nbsp;the 
Chapel of Friendly Bells, the river, full of sludge, runs beneath autumn
 leaves past&nbsp; Vindicator Square on its way to Campbell, where old 
men sit in the Valley Café, drinking beer and squinting up at a TV show 
featuring the bygone fashions of leisure suits and disco dresses.<br>
The town’s population has fallen from more than 166,000 in 1950 to about
 65,000 today. Unemployment is about 7.5%, much higher than the national
 average but&nbsp;down from 13% in 2011. Poverty is persistent, and the 
area relies on a prison, a French company that makes pipes for the 
fracking industry, metal industry jobs, a business incubator that 
supports software and &nbsp;3-D printing start-ups, and a General Motors
 plant in nearby Lordstown.&nbsp;<br>
All told,&nbsp;they provide nowhere near what steel did.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
“Springsteen sang about hardship and misery, and it hasn’t gotten any 
better,” said Bill Slanina, a retired city asbestos inspector who is one
 of more than 6,000 Democrats in the county expected to 
cross&nbsp;over&nbsp;and vote for Trump. “We haven’t had the uplift I 
would have hoped for. Trump wants to make America great again. I guess 
everyone gets on their milk crate and makes promises. He’s worth a try.”<br>
<br>
Wilson stood amid the tools, compressors and grime of his trade. He 
walked deeper into his auto repair shop and reached for the radio 
dial.&nbsp; “Let me turn Rush [Limbaugh]&nbsp; down,” he said. He sat in
 an old chair near a particle board pinned with the yellowed obituaries 
of his steelworker friends who died too early, including Robert Plater. 
60. Cancer. A paper target practice figure hung next to the obituaries. 
Its heart had been blown out.<br>
“A 9mm did that,” he said. “I like to keep this hanging here as a deterrent.”<br>
<br>
It was the nearing of the end of a work day. A few cars rolled past, 
down the hill toward the river. A big man with a mustache, Wilson has an
 easy, patient grace;&nbsp;his sentences slip between irony and humor. 
He said he was a Ted Cruz supporter. “Out of 17 Republican candidates we
 started with, I can’t believe it’s Trump.”<br>
<br>
Part of him thinks Trump’s candidacy is a conspiracy by the media to 
help Clinton win. He’s voting for him anyway. He’s tired of the 
Democrats, entitlement programs and the way things have drifted.<br>
“People are running out of money. They’re getting squeezed,” he said. 
“It’s more expensive to fix newer cars. The parts are technological. I’m
 working on a lot of older and older cars.” He paused. He talked about 
how things once were, the sky alight and humming with the making of 
steel. Big, steamy magic that rose along the shoals and, like a net, 
spread in all directions, giving a boy a sense of fear and wonder.<br>
“A good part of Youngstown is a welfare state now,” he said. He bought a
 house a while back but he’s noticed that other owners are renting their
 homes to people who see the world differently. “I’ve got houses full of
 idiots around me,” he said. “No one goes to work. But they never run 
out of money for dope or malt liquor. That kind of irks me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Much of that resentment has been imposed by&nbsp;larger forces. The song
 “Youngstown” is from the 1995 album “The Ghost of Tom Joad,” a sober 
meditation on how changing economies laid waste to America’s 
manufacturing regions. It also traces the parallel struggles faced by 
immigrants trying to find their ways in a new and suspicious land. They 
are the same issues Trump has ignited with his campaign, but 
Springsteen, unlike the candidate, praises&nbsp;diversity.<br>
<br>
“We are a nation of immigrants and no one knows who’s coming across our 
borders today, whose  story might add a significant page to our American
 story,” he writes in his autobiography. “ Here in the early years of 
our new century, as at the turn of the last, we are once again at war 
with our ‘new Americans.’ ”<br>
<br>
A mile or so from Wilson’s shop, the river road runs toward the edges of
 Youngstown, past the once towering Republic Steel plant, much of it 
taken apart and hauled away years ago. At a small tool-and-die factory, a
 few men sweat while aluminum spun in a machine and shavings filled a 
bin. One man was a Trump supporter, two were not. &nbsp;They spoke of 
healthcare and wages and Obama and anger and the need for some kind of 
shock to the system. Someone mentioned Springsteen.<br>
<br>
“You know, Bruce is a senior citizen now,” said Jim Ortenzio.<br>
<br>
“He tells good stories. He captured Youngstown,” said George Garrett. 
“The steel mills went down in the 1970s. I was coming out of high school
 and hoping I’d be going into steel or General Motors. There wasn’t much
 left. I went into the aluminum business. You can almost make a decent 
living.”<br>
The men thought for a moment and returned to work. Dusk was a couple 
hours off. A breeze lifted and clouds were gathering out near the state 
line to the east.</div>

OCTOBER 30, 2016<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen exists at that rarified level of fame where you get to
 move like a Dalek, without ever actually having to touch anything. When
 he is out in public, at least – when he is being the Springsteen who is
 Brooooooce, the Springsteen who is the Boss, rather than the one who’s 
been married for 25 years and has three kids – no obstacles stand in his
 way. No door is left unopened, no person steps out in front of him, and
 if you find yourself in his orbit, you can’t help but find the 
gravitational pull of stardom yanking you into your position.<br>
<br>
I’ve seen and experienced this a couple of times. In 2010, when he 
attended a screening of the documentary about him, The Promise, at BFI 
Southbank in London, a friend and I were walking down the red carpet 
towards the cinema when there was a stir around us; we felt it before we
 noticed the faces lining the barriers turning in one direction. Behind 
us, Springsteen had alighted from a people carrier. We panicked – We’re 
not meant to be here! Where do we go? – and made ourselves as small and 
invisible at the edge of the carpet as we could while he ambled past and
 the energy followed behind. I don’t remember how the doors opened, but 
I’m pretty sure he didn’t have to lift a finger.<br>
<br>
Then backstage at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry, this past June. 
Springsteen was just finishing his final number – an acoustic version of
 his wonderful 1975 redemption song Thunder Road. We were in the access 
tunnel at the side of the stage, where a fleet of black luxury cars 
lined up, windows tinted, engines ticking over, waiting for him and the 
band to leave the stage, to be whisked from the stadium before the house
 lights have flashed on, while tens of thousands are still finishing 
their drinks and working out where the nearest exit is. It is, 
doubtless, the same wherever he plays.<br>
<br>
The 67-year-old Bruce Springsteen who enters the room at his favoured 
London luxury hotel – door opened by someone else, naturally, and it 
took three people to wait with me for him to enter – has skin the colour
 of wealth and clothes so casual they could only be expensive: a 
close-fitting jacket, a slightly scoop-necked T-shirt, and jeans whose 
left leg is flecked with white paint, as if he’s just been touching up 
the cornicing in the corridors. You half wonder if someone splattered 
the paint on for him, just to keep things looking blue collar.<br>
<br>
He’s here promoting his autobiography, Born to Run. Before London, he’d 
been on a nine-date book tour of US cities, meeting his flock, opening –
 touchingly – with an appearance in his home town of Freehold, New 
Jersey (pop: 12,052), to which people travelled from across the east 
coast. Even that turned into a major operation: the Guardian reported 
that at least eight police officers were on duty around the branch of 
Barnes and Noble, with around twice that number of private security 
guards.<br>
<br>
Springsteen estimates he has scrawled his signature on 17,000 copies of 
the book. Perhaps surprisingly, he’s rather enjoyed the experience. “You
 meet the fans – only for 10 seconds, but you meet them one by one,” he 
says. “And they have an opportunity: what’s the one thing you always 
wanted to say over the 40 years of the relationship we’ve had? I 
actually found it quite moving. Always enjoyed that part. I used to love
 to drift around, bump into people, see what their lives were like, 
wander into their lives for a few moments then drift back out. It 
appealed to the transient nature of my personality. I liked the idea of 
being here and then being gone, this little spirit moving through the 
world.”<br>
<br>
A couple of days before we meet, he opens the European leg of his promo 
jaunt with an event in front of an invited audience of journalists at 
the ICA in London, where he notes that when the fans have met him, one 
of the commonest responses has been: “You’re shorter than I expected.” 
Here, too, the reverence is striking. When questions are opened to the 
floor, someone identifying himself as “Eddie from Ireland” tells 
Springsteen: “Such is the affection that the people of Ireland have for 
you, that if you ran for president of Ireland in the morning, you’d be 
elected.” When the event winds up, a throng of middle-aged men gathers 
at the front of the stage to get their copies of Born to Run signed.<br>
<br>
In Trump’s case, the facade is easy to see through, and what you see is a bundle of anxiety, fragility and insecurity<br>
<br>
It is a pretty decent book, in a genre – the rock autobiography – 
replete with stinkers. (But then, you’d hope it would be a pretty decent
 book given that Springsteen was reportedly paid $10m to write it.) It 
deserves to have topped the bestseller lists on both sides of the 
Atlantic, for its honesty about Springsteen’s difficult childhood, his 
troubled relationship with his father, his struggles with depression, 
and his unyielding faith in the redemptive power of rock’n’roll. He 
writes about the first time depression struck, in the early 1980s, in a 
way that resonates powerfully: he is on a road trip with a friend, 
stopping at a small-town fair, when, “From nowhere, a despair overcomes 
me; I feel an envy of these men and women and their late summer ritual, 
the small pleasures that bind them and this town together. Now, for all I
 know these folks may hate this one-dog dump and each other’s guts and 
be screwing one another’s husbands and wives like rabbits. Why wouldn’t 
they? But right now, all I can think of is that I want to be amongst 
them, of them, and I can’t. I can only watch.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That depression still haunts him, fended off by performing – in the book
 he talks of being “crushed between 60 and 62, good for a year, and out 
again from 63 to 64” – and I want to ask what his favoured 
antidepressant is, whether Sertraline (Zoloft in the States) performed 
the miracles for him it did for me. But there doesn’t really seem to be a
 good way to ask about a hero’s pill regimen.<br>
<br>
<br>
It’s less than a month, when we speak, before the US elections, and 
Springsteen is getting increasingly confident that Donald Trump won’t 
win. He’s no less scathing about the Republican candidate for that 
confidence, though. We talk about the contrast between the American 
ideal of masculinity – generous, confident, empathetic, determined; the 
one you think of when you imagine the “Greatest Generation” who fought 
in the second world war – and the one Trump presents. He laughs at the 
difference. “In Trump’s case, the facade is easy to see through, and 
what you see is a bundle of anxiety, fragility and insecurity,” he says.
 “It’s the thinnest possible mask of masculinity. And it wouldn’t fool 
anybody from the Greatest Generation.” There’s a faint hesitation around
 his use of those words, as if acknowledging that not everyone who 
fought in the war, including his father, was necessarily great. “It’s 
such a thin costume that for me it doesn’t hold for a moment. But there 
have been quite a few people he has attracted along the way, so I 
suppose the bluster works to a certain degree. He’s really quite an 
embarrassment if you’re from the USA. It’s simply the most rigid and 
thinnest veil of masculinity over a mess.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen notes that he’s been asked about Trump a lot as he’s 
promoted his book. And, despite a reputation for political engagement, 
he’s evidently a little tired of it. In fact, he’s been relatively quiet
 this election. Though he appeared at campaign events for both Barack 
Obama and John Kerry, he hasn’t stumped for Hillary Clinton. His most 
notable piece of activism this year came in April when he pulled out of a
 show in North Carolina in protest at the state’s “bathroom law”, 
dictating which public toilets transgender people could use: “To my 
mind, it’s an attempt by people who cannot stand the progress our 
country has made in recognising the human rights of all of our citizens 
to overturn that progress,” he wrote on his website at the time.<br>
<br>
His politics are simple, and basically non-partisan. When he’s used his 
voice it has tended to be to support specific causes – his tours have 
supported food banks in cities where he’s played; he went on Amnesty 
International’s Human Rights Now! tour in 1988; he donated £16,000 to 
Durham miners during the 1985 miners’ strike. In song, he has returned 
repeatedly – not just in Born in the USA – to the plight of America’s 
Vietnam veterans.<br>
<br>
He believes in fairness, people being treated decently, the right to a 
job, medical treatment, education, decent housing, childcare, and open 
government. He once surprised an interviewer by observing: “To me, these
 are all conservative ideas… Economic stability. Health. That’s not 
remotely radical.”<br>
<br>
Arguably the biggest influence on his politics was his manager, Jon 
Landau, the former music writer whom he met when he was studying a gig 
review pinned up outside a Boston club before his appearance in April 
1974. Landau, the review’s writer, sidled up and asked the young 
musician what he thought. Thus began a friendship that transformed into a
 professional relationship, and something more: in Born to Run, 
Springsteen speaks of him being “the Clark to my Lewis”. It’s not so 
much that Landau told Springsteen what to think, more that he guided him
 to the books and films that might provoke him to think.<br>
<br>
My mother was decent, compassionate, strong, wilful. The best part of me picked up a lot of those characteristics<br>
<br>
One of the binds of that, though, is the number of heartland American 
fans – the ones who are voting Trump – who believe Springsteen would 
think like them if only, as one contributor to the Backstreets fansite 
recently suggested, he hadn’t been “brainwashed” into liberalism by 
Landau and others in his inner circle. On the other hand, there are 
those who think it outrageous that someone whose songs display an 
extraordinary empathy for ordinary people should dare to have homes in 
New Jersey, Florida and Los Angeles, and charge £100 per ticket to see 
him (the guarantee he demands from promoters for live shows is reputed 
to be among the largest in music; certainly, I received no reply from 
Landau last year when I wrote offering a guaranteed £700 and a lift down
 from London in my Ford Focus if Springsteen fancied playing a solo set 
at Ramsgate Music Hall).<br>
<br>
For Springsteen, politics seems to be about the way you live your life 
as much as anything. It’s about being decent. About being fair to 
others. Being a good man. So what does being a good man entail?<br>
<br>
“That’s a big question,”<br>
<br>
It is.<br>
<br>
“I guess, really… I probably learned the best answers to that from my 
mother. My mother was basically decent, compassionate, strong, wilful. 
She insisted on creating a world where she could make her children feel 
as safe as possible, even though she certainly had her faults in that 
area. But she was consistent. You could count on her. Day after day 
after day. And she was very strong. The best part of me picked up a lot 
of those characteristics and I struggle to live up to them today. So I 
think dependability, strength, wilfulness… put in the service of 
something good – those are the things that matter to me.”<br>
<br>
His mother had to be the rock because his childhood in New Jersey was, 
to say the least, peculiar. He spent a chunk of it in the early 1950s 
living in Freehold with a paternal grandmother who loved him too much, 
compensating for the death of her daughter in 1927 (“It was very 
emotionally incestuous and a lot of parental roles got crossed,” he told
 the writer Peter Ames Carlin); school was cruel, his father Doug – 
consumed by an often silent rage against the world, and against the son 
who mystified him – crueller still, emotionally at least.<br>
<br>
Born to Run paints a picture of a childhood that is semi-feral, where 
Springsteen might refuse to go to school, and his grandmother would back
 him up. “I think I was a little unusual in that I went into rock’n’roll
 music to create order out of my life,” he says. “My younger life felt 
rather chaotic, so I was in search of some stability, actually, some 
order.”<br>
<br>
As a kid, he felt invisible. That stopped when he started playing 
guitar. “Suddenly I was able to make a very loud noise, and a noise that
 was not so easy to ignore,” he says. “I had my little rock’n’roll band 
and we were playing to a small gym full of dancers and their friends, 
and they immediately looked at you as a presence in their lives.”<br>
<br>
When he was 19 his parents moved to California, and he was free to 
pursue music, to become – as he would say on stage years later – a 
“prisoner… a prisoner of rock’n’roll”.<br>
<br>
Politics started entering Springsteen’s music, though far from 
explicitly, with his fourth album, Darkness on the Edge of Town, in 
1978. That was when his music ceased to be the myth-making epics of his 
first three albums, and he started writing instead about ordinary people
 and their struggles. He wasn’t informed by reading political tracts. “I
 just referred to my experiences growing up – my parents’ lives, my 
sister’s life.”<br>
<br>
His parents had struggled to make ends meet, his mother working as a 
legal secretary, his father in a succession of blue-collar jobs. His 
sister had married in her teens, and she and her husband’s travails 
inspired his masterly song The River, about a couple trying to face up 
to the wedge that joblessness drives into relationships. “I was 
surrounded by people who were youthful but living very complicated adult
 lives,” he says. “They were having kids at young ages and trying to 
build a work life and a home life that was very adult. It was very easy 
to draw upon. It wasn’t a stretch or a strain.”<br>
<br>
The songs about ordinary lives – combined with Springsteen’s revelatory,
 ecstatic live performances – built the bond with his audience that has 
lasted more than 40 years, and itself became the subject of an 
extraordinarily moving film in 2013, Springsteen &amp; I. I don’t think 
he takes that relationship for granted. He understands that people want a
 piece of him for themselves: at that BFI Southbank event in 2010, 
Springsteen came to the bar afterwards; while his entourage sat in the 
corner, talking to one another, he perched on the back of a sofa facing 
the room. A receiving line of people queueing for a photo and autograph 
formed, and he stayed until everyone had their moment (my photo was out 
of focus; I got the autograph for my sister).<br>
<br>
People think they know Springsteen. They have an image of Bob Dylan 
(inscrutable), Neil Young (irascible), Paul McCartney (wearingly 
cheerful; Springsteen laughs when I use the old Smash Hits name of Fab 
Wacky Macca Thumbs Aloft). But they can imagine watching sports in a bar
 with Springsteen, which perhaps accounts for why people get a bit 
overexcited – I do not excuse myself from this – at the prospect of 
meeting him (fan accounts of encounters almost always dwell, 
approvingly, on what an ordinary guy he is. Even if he is shorter than 
expected).<br>
<br>
They think they know Springsteen because, these days, he’s as much an idea, an ideal, as a person.<br>
<br>
“Sure, that’s true,” he says, of that notion. “You bring with you an 
entire philosophy, a certain code of living, I suppose. It’s something 
you pursue. My heroes were people like Frank Sinatra, Hank Williams, 
Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan. These were all people who brought their entire
 philosophy along with them, created a world that would engulf you and 
give you you, assist you in different ways of living, different ways of 
presenting yourself. Those were the artists that always interested me. 
They always seemed to carry a realisation of what being a musician might
 mean, could mean, the possibilities of what being a musician could be. 
That was something I was at least semiconscious of trying to create.”<br>
<br>
“I’m not sure. If you’re doing it right, it’s a byproduct of all your actions and all your choices and what you’ve created.”<br>
<br>
It should be noted at this point that Springsteen appears to know 
exactly what he thinks about every aspect of his life and art and how 
they interact. I guess that’s inevitable. First, he’s just written a 
500-page book about those subjects; second, he’s been in therapy for 
decades; third, he and Landau based their entire relationship on talking
 at exhaustive length about all this stuff. But, for an interviewer, 
it’s a bit odd. The most fascinating moments in interviews usually come 
when you catch a subject by surprise and you can see them deciding what 
they think about something. With Springsteen, it feels more like he’s 
searching through his mental hard drive for the relevant file.<br>
<br>
That’s not to say his answers are not fascinating (they are) or cursory 
(they very much are not). When asked what he means when he says his 
covenant with his audience depends on honesty, he replies without pause,
 without any errs or urrms, in a single perfect paragraph, that requires
 not one piece of tidying in the transcription: “I guess we come out and
 deliver the straight dope to our crowd as best we can. It’s coming on 
stage with the idea: OK, well the stakes that are involved this evening 
are quite high. I don’t know exactly who’s in the crowd. But I know that
 my life was changed in an instant by something that people thought was 
purely junk – pop music records. And you can change someone’s life in 
three minutes with the right song. I still believe that to this day. You
 can bend the course of their development, what they think is important,
 of how vital and alive they feel. You can contextualise very, very 
difficult experiences. Songs are pretty good at that. So all these are 
the stakes that are laid out on the table when you come out at night. 
And I still take those stakes seriously after all that time, if not more
 so now, as the light grows slightly dimmer. I come out believing 
there’s no tomorrow night, there wasn’t last night, there’s just 
tonight. And I have built up the skills to be able to provide, under the
 right conditions, a certain transcendent evening, hopefully an evening 
you’ll remember when you go home. Not that you’ll just remember it was a
 good concert, but you’ll remember the possibilities the evening laid 
out in front of you, as far as where you could take your life, or how 
you’re thinking about your friends, or your wife or your girlfriend, or 
your best pal, or your job, your work, what you want to do with your 
life. These are all things, I believe, that music can accommodate and 
can provide service in. That’s what we try to deliver.”<br>
<br>
I email that paragraph to a Springsteen obsessive friend, who blogs 
about both Springsteen and burgers. She writes back: “It sounds silly, 
and I try to explain to people, but going to Springsteen shows has 
shaped a lot of changes in my life. I went to South Africa for a week on
 my own for four concerts, felt revived, like I could achieve anything. 
So I left my job and tried to get into journalism, something I’d wanted 
to do since I was 10. And that’s why I feel like I have to go to 
Australia [to see Springsteen next year], too, because I need to find 
that direction again. It’s a funny way to live your life, seeking these 
highs, living the lows, but ultimately I think I’m better off for it. I 
really don’t know what I’d do without his music in my life.”<br>
<br>
“No.” (I bet he does. I really, really bet he does.)<br>
<br>
Then is he unaware of the section of his hardcore fanbase who complain 
that his sets are too predictable because he only changes half of a 
three-hour-plus set from night to night, instead of the whole thing? 
“I’ve seen that,” he says. “You have to indulge your hardcore fans. It’s
 really all right.”<br>
<br>
You’re more tolerant than I’d be. I’d tell them where to get off. No one
 else changes their sets like you! They should be grateful!<br>
<br>
He doesn’t reply. He just laughs long and hard, his head back, his eyes creasing.<br>

<br>
On 5 June this year, as the sun set over Wembley Stadium, Bruce 
Springsteen and the E Street Band struck up the sombre opening chords of
 Tougher Than the Rest, the 1987 single about the difficulties of adult 
love that marked his return after Born in the USA had made him the 
world’s biggest rock star. Stepping up to the front of the stage to duet
 with him was Patti Scialfa, a member of the E Street Band since 1984, 
and his second wife – his first marriage, to Julianne Phillips, ended 
quickly (in Born to Run, Springsteen admits he was wholly unready for 
it). Three days after performing what might as well be their theme song,
 Scialfa and Springsteen marked their 25th wedding anniversary.<br>
<br>
Her presence changed not just Springsteen’s life but his work, too. The E
 Street Band stopped being an all-male preserve, a gang, forcing a 
change in their behaviour and attitudes. “I think women are in general a
 good influence on growing up, on growing into your manhood,” he says, 
delicately.<br>
<br>
And then when they had children – two sons, Evan and Sam, born in 1990 
and 1994, and a daughter, Jessica, in 1991 – his life was altered even 
more profoundly. “If I was going to chop my life into sections,” he 
says, “it would be before the children and after the children, 
certainly. Just changed my entire worldview. Changed the way I looked at
 myself. Changed the way I looked at my job. Gave me an entirely 
separate identity away from my music, which I found to be very 
fulfilling.”<br>
<br>
Before he had children, Springsteen had assumed that whatever he was 
working on was what everyone around him should be concentrating on. He 
recalls his bafflement when Jon Landau had his first child, and would 
suddenly start leaving recording sessions at 6pm, to go and bathe his 
baby daughter. “I remember thinking…” he adopts a puzzled tone, “You 
gotta go home and bathe your daughter? We’re doing A, B, C or D, which I
 happen to think is the most important thing in the world right now. But
 of course it’s not.”<br>
<br>
Having children made Springsteen realise that his work wasn’t his life, 
it was a substitute for life. “I realised that previously I’d expanded 
my work life so that I’d have something to do during the day, and into 
the evening. Without it, what am I gonna do? Go home, sit in a chair and
 watch TV? So I’d expanded the time it took me to do my job. Once the 
kids came along, I realised, I could squeeze my previous 18 hours of 
work day into six or eight, without any problems whatsoever. I realised 
the song is always going to be there – there’s always going to be a song
 in your heart or in your head – but kids, they’re there and then 
they’re gone. And when they’re gone, they’re gone. Once I realised that,
 I found a tremendous freedom from the tyranny of my own mind.”<br>
<br>
You couldn’t say that Springsteen has slowed down, though, especially 
now the kids are gone. This summer’s tour of European and US stadiums 
saw him playing some of his longest ever shows, breaking the four-hour 
barrier – with no intermissions, unlike his late-70s marathons – on 
occasion. Springsteen says he has no problems finding the energy to play
 them, but it’s not so easy for some of his bandmates. Before 
Springsteen arrives, his co-manager Barbara Carr mentions that Max 
Weinberg, the 65-year-old drummer, spends all his time between shows 
sequestered in his hotel room, the windows blacked out, the gaps between
 door and frame filled to block out all noise, simply recuperating from 
the previous gig.<br>
<br>
That’s the price the band must pay in order to deliver what Springsteen 
wants: “I come out on stage to deliver to you the greatest band in the 
world,” he says. “I still have great pride in what I do. I still believe
 in its power. I believe in my ability to transfer its power to you. 
That’s never changed. One of the things our band was very good at 
communicating was that sense of joy, which I think makes us somewhat 
unique. Rock bands try to project a lot of different things: intensity, 
mystery, sexuality, cool. Not a lot of rock bands concentrate on joy, 
and I got that from my relatives on the Italian side – they lived it and
 they passed it down to me.”<br>
<br>
The ambition that drove him to chase perfection 40 years ago – when he 
would spend hours shouting “Stick!” at Weinberg in the studio, insisting
 he somehow find a way to play his snare without the sound of stick 
hitting the skin being audible – is still present.<br>
<br>
I ask if, for all his testimonies to the simple power of playing 
rock’n’roll, and how he says he’s happy pitching up for an impromptu set
 at a local bar with a pick-up band, whether he would have been content 
if he’d ended up precisely as popular as his friends and contemporaries 
Southside Johnny and Joe Grushecky, blue-collar rockers who never 
transcended the clubs. “I would probably be an old, disgruntled 
entertainer,” he says, then chuckles at the very notion that he might 
not have conquered the world. “I was shooting for the whole show. But I 
certainly would have made my peace with it. Any time you make your 
living as a musician, you’re way ahead of the game. You’re way ahead of 
the game. I always thought: Gee, I’m making a living scratching on a 
piece of wood. I can’t complain too much.”<br>
<br>
In 1975, when he was promoting the Born to Run album, there was a story 
Springsteen used to tell interviewers. While he was recording the album 
in New York, he was staying in a grotty outpost of Holiday Inn, in one 
of Manhattan’s less salubrious districts. In his room was a mirror, 
which hung crooked. Every morning he would dutifully straighten the 
mirror. And when he returned to his room, the mirror would be askew 
again. And so, once more, he’d correct it. And again it would slip off 
centre.<br>
<br>
It is, I suggest, a perfect metaphor for a man driven, even when the 
reasons for his drive, his desperation, might seem unclear to those 
around him. He smiles. And, rather unexpectedly, quotes Immanuel Kant 
back at me: “Out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing 
was ever made.”<br>
<br>
And then the door opens, and he glides away, no obstacles in his path.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)<br>
1973</strong><br>
<br>
A showstopping, Van Morrisonesque epic that’s still a highlight of 
Springsteen’s live shows, Rosalita sprawls and swerves and swings, 
irresistibly. It also has the couplet that most encapsulates the joy it 
must have been to be young and on the cusp of greatness: “Tell him this 
is his last chance to get his daughter in a fine romance / Cos the 
record company, Rosie, they just gave me a big advance.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Born to Run<br>
1975</strong><br>
<br>
It took until his third album for Springsteen to write the song that 
defined him, and of which he has still not tired. “Good songs collect 
the years, cumulative meaning,” he says. “They grow with you. Play Born 
to Run and it just allows more people in. I’ll see a 15-year-old kid 
singing every word, and I’ll see a grandma too! A good song keeps its 
arms open and welcomes those who come to it over the years.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Darkness on the Edge of Town<br>
1978</strong><br>
<br>
The album Darkness on the Edge of Town saw Springsteen ditching 
mythologising and writing about adult dilemmas. “I was very concerned 
about writing music that I felt an adult voice could sing,” he says. “I 
felt that was a trap some bands fell into. I never wanted to have to 
come out on stage and pretend. Of course, it’s all pretending, I 
suppose. But I wanted to feel comfortable in my own skin.”<br>
<br>
The River<br>
1980<br>
In growing up, Springsteen says, “you have to come face to face with a 
lot of your weaknesses and the things you do poorly, so that you’re able
 to assess the landscape and find out what are the righteous paths you 
can travel down, and what are the roads that are just going to lead you 
to a dead end. The River, of course, is the song I wrote about that 
specific idea.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Born in the USA<br>
1982</strong><br>
<br>
The acoustic version recorded at the time of the Nebraska album allows 
none of the ambiguity of the stadium-crushing version released two years
 later. Spare and haunted, a howl from the margins, and utterly unsuited
 to being co-opted by Ronald Reagan, it would remain unreleased until 
the 1998 Tracks box set.<br>
<br>
Brilliant Disguise<br>
1987<br>
Springsteen’s first marriage failed – but led to the brilliant, 
introspective album Tunnel of Love. This single seemed to be an 
autobiographical take on his relationship, with a devastating payoff: 
“God have mercy on the man / Who doubts what he’s sure of.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The Ghost of Tom Joad<br>
1995</strong><br>
<br>
The lives of the dispossessed were the theme of the largely acoustic 
album The Ghost of Tom Joad. The title track seems to echo Born to Run 
when it claims “the highway is alive tonight”. But this time “nobody’s 
kidding nobody about where it goes”. Desolate and beautiful.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Long Walk Home<br>
2007</strong><br>
<br>
An idealised small-town America turns out to be a ghost town as the Bush
 years come to a close – “the diner was shuttered and boarded, with a 
sign that just said ‘Gone’.” To get back to the America of the national 
dream will take a long walk – so long we shouldn’t wait up for Bruce.</div>
