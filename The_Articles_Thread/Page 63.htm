Editors<br>
of "Backstreets" Magazine:<br>
<br>
Suki Lahav</strong><br>
<br>
Interview by Steven Allan, December 1985<br>
<br>
Seeing the E Street Band today, playing to stadium-sized crowds, it's hard<br>
to imagine their sound as anything but the raucous, guitar-dominated 
playing that's best exhibited by songs like "Glory Days" and "Born in 
the USA." But long-time fans of the band know it hasn't always been like
 that --- in the early seventies the band had a dramatically different 
sound. Until *Born toRun*, the band was very much keyboard-dominated, 
due in part to David Sancious's jazz background. Springsteen's songs 
themselves tended more toward the theatrical and there was still strong 
evidence of Bruce's early fascination with Bob Dylan; in fact, the band 
was as likely to pull out a Dylan number for an encore as they were to 
break into "Twist and Shout."<br>
<br>
Part of the reason for that unique sound was the presence of Suki Lahav,
 the first female member of the E Street Band. Suki was the resident E 
Street violinist from September 1974 to March 1975. Though she recorded 
many songs in the studio, on record she can only be found as a vocalist 
on "Sandy" and "Incident on 57th Street," while her violin playing 
shines only on"Jungleland."<br>
<br>
But onstage, for her brief tenure with the band, Suki mad quite a lasting<br>
impact. Her violin playing gave a romantic and intellectual feel to<br>
Springsteen's shows and added another haunting element to many of the 
early songs. In particular, her playing on the E Street version of 
Dylan's "I<br>
Want You" was wonderful. Many of the shows at that time would open with 
Bruce aloneat the microphone, with Suki in the rear of the stage, 
spotlights on both; it was powerful visually as well as musically.<br>
<br>
Suki's original introduction into the band had been through her husband<br>
Louis Lahav, the engineer for the second album. Her career with the E 
Street Band ended when she and Louis decided to return to Israel. She 
now lives with her second husband and two children in Jerusalem, where 
*Backstreets* caught up with her.<br>
<br>
BACKSTREETS: *How did you meet Bruce Springsteen?*<br>
<br>
SUKI LAHAV: Louis was working with Mike Appel in the 914 Sound Studios 
as an engineer. Mike arrived with Bruce and I remember as soon as he 
came into the studio it was obvious, even then, that he was a giant, 
that one day he'd just explode into stardom.<br>
<br>
As soon as I heard those recordings, I became just as convinced. By the<br>
music, the lyrics, and, later on, after I got to know him, by Bruce as a person.<br>
<br>
*What year was that?*<br>
<br>
We arrived in the States in 1971 and everything seemed to happen with Bruce around 1973 and 1974.<br>
<br>
*Whose idea was it to use the violin in the band?*<br>
<br>
Bruce was the first to suggest it. At first everyone laughed. "What, a<br>
violin in a rock 'n' roll band!" seemed to be everyone's attitude. But, 
as always, if Bruce said so, then everyone went straight along with it. 
And I think he proved that he was right.<br>
<br>
*So he offered you the chance?*<br>
<br>
Well, not exactly straightaway. He had some auditions, but he couldn't find<br>
anyone to fit his demands. Even then he was the big perfectionist. I was<br>
only in the picture because I was Louis's wife. I remember once they 
invited a children's choir to record on the track "Sandy." They didn't 
turn up, so Bruce decided to record me over and over, track on track, 
and make it sound like a choir. That was hard work, trying to sound like
 a choir. That's the only official recording I appear on.<br>
<br>
*How do you feel about not being put on record?*<br>
<br>
I don't mind that at all. What was more important to me was the 
experience I gained from working together with such a great artist. I 
personally don't think I was good enough for him anyway.<br>
<br>
*Where did you first appear live with the band?*<br>
<br>
In Lincoln Center. After that --- since the response was so good --- we<br>
carried on with it. Bruce used the violin only for the romantic side of<br>
him. I played only on the slow songs.<br>
<br>
*How was it to work with him?*<br>
<br>
Bruce was in total control, the one and only "Boss." But still he worked<br>
always together with everyone as a team. He didn't have to impose<br>
himself --- he was willing to accept suggestions, but always, he had the
 last say. Even then he used to record loads of songs and only use a few
 of them. In my opinion, some of those songs that have never been 
released are his best. Especially the lyrics --- he wrote like a madman,
 a natural phenomenon.<br>
<br>
*What was the band like?*<br>
<br>
I became friendly with everyone. But especially with Max. We used to talk<br>
about Bruce a lot. And he was very loyal to him --- he seemed to play just<br>
for him. I remember Max telling me how hard it was for him, being the 
drummer. He was always in the background onstage and couldn't hear Bruce
 sing all the time. He wanted to be able to hear all the words to be 
able to get more into the music. Clarence is just a heap of warmth and 
tenderness. It's a pity, but he's less apparent on the *Born in the USA*
 album.<br>
<br>
*What do you think of *Born in the USA*?*<br>
<br>
I'm not all that much of a rock 'n' roller these days. So altogether I'm<br>
less interested in that type of music. I feel it was done very professionally<br>
and I can understand why people like it. But that type of music has less
 affect on me, than, say, *Nebraska*, which was, for me, his best album 
yet.<br>
<br>
There's a problem as one becomes a star, especially in the States. The<br>
American culture and entertainment industry have such big demands that 
one can easily be turned into a music factory. Even Bruce --- though I'm
 sure much less than others --- has become part of the great media 
controlled music, where other people decide what to do and what not to 
do. But I'm not worried about Bruce. As always, I'm sure he's under 
control of everything --- and still the same, down-to-earth, simple but 
great artist. Even when he sings "We Are the World, " he stands out more
 than anyone, with the feeling and power he puts into those simple 
words. He's more representative of America than the president. He's a 
true American figure and not a result of public relations.<br>
He doesn't act --- he really is himself.<br>
<br>
*How did your involvement with the E Street Band end?*<br>
<br>
I wanted to come back home. I believe my place is here in Israel. Louis<br>
and I decided to come back to Israel before the split with Mike.<br>
<br>
*Have you been in touch with Bruce since?*<br>
<br>
About six years back, a film producer friend of mine wanted to use three of<br>
Bruce's songs for an Israeli film of his. He had trouble getting the okay<br>
from CBS. So I called Bruce up on the phone. It took me a few days to 
find him at home, but in the end he answered. He was really pleased to 
hear from me and right away said that there's no problem in using those 
songs ["Jungleland," "Hungry Heart" and "Point Blank"]. He was really 
nice about it. CBS made a promotional disc of that film with those three
 songs on it. I heard it's become quite a collector's item, being that 
they only had thirty printed.<br>
<br>
*What do you do now?*<br>
<br>
Most of the time I'm at home with my children --- far away from the lights<br>
and excitement of those early days with Bruce.</div>

Bruce Springsteen's kibbutz violinist<br>
 By DAVID HOROVITZ<br>
10/22/2007 </strong><br>
<br>
<br>
For a few magical months Suki Lahav played with world's finest band. <br>
lahav e street 88 224 Listening to the new Bruce Springsteen album, 
Magic - which is topping the US charts and rightly being hailed as 
something of a return to form - I started thinking about the days when 
Bruce really did make magical music. Early Springsteen, and we're 
talking more than 30 years ago here, was sheer exuberance - 
unpredictable, romantic, adventurous and life-affirming. The songs on 
his first three albums were peopled by preachers and circus acts, 
bikers, bus-drivers and fortune-tellers, hesitant girlfriends and 
unattainable beauties, losers resigned to the working life and heroes 
busting to break free of poverty and convention. He'd polished those 
songs in small New Jersey clubs before fans who knew he was special, 
unveiling them with rambling, purportedly autobiographical 
introductions, the background rhythms throbbing louder as some 
improbable saga of frustrated romance or domestic rebellion culminated 
and the urgently whispered narrative gave way to musical liberation. His
 stage shows were rightly legendary - three hours and more of 
free-flowing, sweat-dripping rock'n'roll theater. And the music...the 
music drew on every influence - classical fragility and black soul 
passion and pounding rock discipline and much more besides, brought 
forth by a band of musicians who so plainly revelled, like no other band
 before or since, in the sheer joy of being up on stage together, their 
harmony exemplified by the partnership at their core: Working class 
white boy Bruce on guitar and vocals and big black Clarence Clemons 
alongside him on the saxophone. But for a few months, between late 1974 
and early 1975, there was also a violin, in the darkness on the edge, 
adding heartrending poignancy to ballads like the debut album's sparse 
"Lost in the Flood," the sprawling "Incident on 57th Street," the 
gangland drama "Jungleland," and the ever-mutating take-a-chance-on-me 
saga that became "Thunder Road." It was a violin played by Suki Lahav, a
 young girl in a flowing white dress from Kibbutz Ayelet Hashahar in the
 Upper Galilee, barely out of the army, barely married. "Yes, I went 
from kibbutz harvest music to rocking with Bruce," Suki Tzruya-Lahav 
reflects wryly now, from a 32-year distance, from the Germany Colony in 
Jerusalem, where she's since raised her two sons, written several 
acclaimed books, taught creative writing and penned lyrics for much of 
Israel's musical big league - Rita and Yehuda Poliker and Gidi Gov and 
Rami Kleinstein and Ricky Gal and Yehudit Ravitz. Though she's broken a 
tooth on the day we meet, and looks a little fragile, life after 
Springsteen has plainly been fulfilling for Lahav. She says it took her a
 long time to find out what she really wanted to do: the writing. And 
she loves it. Springsteen has recently brought a violinist back into his
 band but Lahav, the original, never touches the instrument anymore. 
Never. "It's not like a piano, which sounds fine even if you really 
can't play. The violin played badly sounds awful. They were doing a show
 of my songs three years ago in Tel Aviv, and I thought 'wouldn't it be 
great if I picked up the violin again and played on a couple of them.' 
So I took it out at home, and it was awful. My husband pretended he was 
asleep. My older son, who's a musician" - a jazz guitarist - said, 'Go 
for it.' My younger son said, 'Stop, it's painful.'" The Springsteen 
period was a brief, extraordinary interlude a long, long time ago. But 
she's happy to talk about it, feels incredibly fortunate to have been 
part of it, and is relieved, she says, to have been gone by the time 
Springsteen became "The Boss" and went global. Her first husband, Louis,
 she recalls, switching sunglasses for spectacles with pretty floral 
frames, was the sound engineer at 914 Sound Studios in Blauvelt, New 
York, favored by the likes of Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, Melanie, Janis 
Ian and Springsteen's early '70s manager Mike Appel. So Bruce and the 
band recorded their first album there and were working on the second. 
"They worked nights; they were the main event in our musical lives. We 
were all young. He wasn't the big star. Not yet. Just a unique artist." 
Springsteen had hired a church children's choir for a song called "4th 
of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)," but they didn't show. "And I was around. 
And I had this high, pure clear voice. So that was my first time," says 
Lahav - singing, uncredited, on the track that appears on the second 
album, The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle. Then 
Springsteen decided he wanted a violinist on stage with him, to 
complement the guitars, the sax and the keyboards. "Louis sent me along 
to audition. There were others. Surprisingly, he took me." Surprisingly 
because, she says disarmingly, "I didn't think I was very good... You 
have to practice for hours a day. I was never a big practicer. But 
maybe," she allows, "maybe I did have my own thing..." Others in the 
band were changing too. She auditioned with Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan,
 drummer and pianist with Springsteen to this day. And there then 
unfolded seven glorious months on the road and in the studio with "Bruce
 Springsteen and the E Street Band" as his career ascended from small 
clubs to stadia, en route to what would become, a few months after Lahav
 left, his grandiose heralding as "the future of rock and roll" with 
simultaneous cover stories in Time and Newsweek on October 27, 1975. 
Maybe because we're speaking English, perhaps because it was all so long
 ago, or most probably because she was the classical musician at the 
edge of the rocking rapture, Lahav is not notably articulate in 
describing the rush it must have been to play with Springsteen in that 
headiest of times. "The music was incredible," she sighs. "The lyrics 
were so rich; some of the most beautiful lyrics didn't ever make it onto
 record." She says "everybody knew that he was going to be this big 
artist. But we were all poor. Bruce was poor. We were all just 
completely into this thing" - the music. Then she asks me, "Did you see 
him live?" I tell her that yes, but much later, in 1981, when the 
concerts were still extravagant, exhausting epics, but the clubs had 
long since given way to the arenas and the new music was structured and 
disciplined, verse-verse-chorus; freewheeling no more. "But still," she 
says, "you saw him. So you understand how good he was." WHEN LAHAV, who 
speaks softly, somewhat hesitantly, and has a certain gentle grace, says
 she is glad she didn't stay with Springsteen into superstardom, it's 
easy to believe her. She remembers one of the bigger concerts - 
thousands in a stadium somewhere in New York (probably Westbury in 
February 1975) - and says the roar of the crowd as the band made its way
 to the stage was terrifying. "Of course I hid behind Clarence; held 
onto him; he was always big enough to hide behind." The stage at this 
auditorium actually revolved, she remembers in horror. "You know, the 
violin is this delicate instrument. I'm playing and all of a sudden, 
'Whoa, the floor's moving!'" The odyssey ended as the breakthrough 
album, Born to Run, was being recorded. Lahav played on "Jungleland," 
credited on the cover this time. But Springsteen and manager Appel were 
in the process of falling out, a new manager, Jon Landau, was taking 
over, and "we were really Mike's people," she says simply. She came back
 to Israel soon after, began the rest of her life, and is more polite 
than effusive about most of the music Springsteen's made in more recent 
years. "He is a lovely man," she says of the former band leader she 
hasn't seen since 1976, "and he wanted to become The Boss, to conquer 
the world." Matter of fact, rather than critical, she adds, "You can't 
conquer the world with the poetry of that early music." Well, Dylan did.
 "Dylan was a phenomenon. The time was right, and he wouldn't change." 
Springsteen simplified his music, she acknowledges. The songs became 
more formal, less adventurous, less vivid, less wild - and, lately, much
 more political. "Artists change," she says a touch wistfully. What does
 she listen to now? "I've gone back to my classical music," she begins. 
But does she ever listen to the early Springsteen albums she played on? 
"Of course," she says with real joy in her voice. "It's not the main 
thing in my life, but it's a part of me that will never fade."</div>

Morning Joe's Joe Scarborough: The Boss and Me <br>
JUNE 28, 2014 <br>
<br>
By JOE SCARBOROUGH </strong><br>
<br>
Thirty years ago this month, Bruce Springsteen released his seminal 
album “Born in the U.S.A.” Joe Scarbrough remembers the summer of ’84— 
and the song that pitted his political idol against his musical hero.<br>
<br>
On the 30th anniversary of the release of Bruce Springsteen’s Born in 
the U.S.A.., let’s kick off this appreciation of his seminal album by, 
well, trashing some of it. In June 1984, as my friends and I watched the
 Boss cavort in a cheesy video with a then unknown Courteney Cox on MTV,
 we were aghast. In the ’70s we’d fallen in love with Bruce’s gritty 
rock anthems. I was a songwriter, too, back then; Born to Run had blown 
me away. So “Dancing in the Dark,” the Boss’s slick new single, seemed 
like a sellout. We called it “Disco in the Dark.”<br>
<br>
But the best music demands time to get its hooks, and message, into you.
 I spent the first part of the summer of ’84 locked in my bedroom 
recording new songs, trying to bring the Boss’s influence into my music;
 then I drove across America with my friends on a seemingly endless road
 trip, listening to his new album. By the time we got my family’s 
station wagon from Florida to L.A., then wound our way up the California
 coast, it had worked its way into our hearts.<br>
<br>
The Boss was displaying a songwriting finesse few other rock musicians 
could match. Consider “No Surrender,” a last-minute addition to the 
album that showed Bruce at his joyous best. “I’m on Fire” still 
transports me to a sweltering July 4th fireworks show somewhere on the 
Gulf Coast. We spent many a late night that summer racing through sleepy
 coastal towns, shouting the words to “Darlington County.” Those were 
our glory days, and Born in the U.S.A. was our summer soundtrack.<br>
<br>
Seven Billboard Top 10 singles came out of that album, but it was more 
than a hit factory. Bruce’s seventh studio effort was also a requiem for
 the American dream, a working-class hero’s love song to folks busted 
and bruised by Vietnam, heartbreak, and the passage of time.<br>
<br>
Like the Eagles’ Hotel California in the ’70s and Nirvana’s Nevermind in
 the ’90s, Born in the U.S.A. defined and was defined by the decade of 
its release. In June 1984, the Reagan Revolution was in full force. 
Reagan was running for a second term using the campaign slogan “It’s 
Morning in America,” a promise to voters that good times lay ahead. That
 idyllic patriotism was probably disorienting for Bruce, who wrote music
 that chronicled the underside of the American experience. Still, 
whether he liked it or not, many of the young concertgoers who idolized 
him also voted for our conservative president.<br>
<br>
“Born in the U.S.A.” was the song of the summer in ’84, so it wasn’t a 
surprise when Reagan’s reelection team tried to trade on its popularity.
 In a stump speech in New Jersey, Reagan said Bruce’s lyrics held “a 
message of hope,” a reading that was embarrassingly off. “Born in the 
U.S.A.” was in fact an antiwar protest song. Reagan’s mistake didn’t 
hurt him—he went on to win in a historic landslide. But the flap made 
presidential history. <br>
<br>
Even if Springsteen rejected Reagan’s sunny patriotism, his album oozed 
Stars and Stripes, from the title track down to the iconic Annie 
Leibovitz photo on the cover. It was like tipping a hat to Reagan’s 
America with one hand and thumbing a nose at it with the other. And 
despite their dark themes, the songs were infectious. Tapping your foot 
to the thumping drumbeat in “Born in the U.S.A.,” singing along to the 
chorus, you felt good. Bruce’s heroes may have been beaten down, but you
 got the feeling the Boss wasn’t counting them out. They were proud, and
 above all, tough.<br>
<br>
Three decades later, as the rich keep getting richer, the poor keep 
getting poorer, and the middle class keep feeling the squeeze of changes
 that seem beyond their control, Bruce’s words feel as relevant as ever.
 My friends and I may have gagged over “Dancing in the Dark,” but we 
loved the rest of that album. It spoke to everyone, from postmen to 
presidents, in ways no other album could.<br>
<br>
And it still does.</div>

•	WASHINGTON POST<br>
By Alyssa Rosenberg July 8 <br>
<br>
Follow @AlyssaRosenberg</strong><br>
<br>
For the past three decades, Bruce Springsteen has been the go-to pop 
star for pundits who want to gauge the mood of young Americans, and 
sometimes even young Europeans. But this summer, the American flag 
backdrop is passing to a new set of artists. Beyoncé Knowles-Carter and 
her husband Jay Z stopped by Baltimore last night during their “On the 
Run” tour, bringing with them both a great party vibe and a complicated 
new set of American ideas.<br>
If Springsteen’s power has come from the consistency of narrative and 
ideas in his music, Beyoncé and Jay Z are somewhat more protean figures.<br>
Even as he amassed wealth and fame that took him far his Freehold 
Borough childhood, Springsteen found new ways to focus on class in the 
United States, whether he was touring with Pete Seeger classics or 
launching a macro critique of the economy with “Wrecking Ball.” Jay Z 
has made his rise from the margins of the U.S. economy to its pinnacle 
an explicit subject of his work, going “From standing on the corners 
boppin’ / To driving some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen” in
 1998, and 15 years later, dreaming of Picassos and Rothkos.<br>
Knowles-Carter’s evolution has less to do with class than with artistic 
independence. Her career began in girl groups, but she has stepped 
forward as a dynamic solo artist. In 2011, Knowles-Carter jettisoned her
 father as her manager. “4″ and “Beyoncé,” the two albums she released 
in the wake of that decision, are a rich exploration of marriage, 
sexuality, parenthood and the pleasures of professional accomplishment. 
The latter includes an explicit statement of feminist principles, 
something of a rarity in the contemporary entertainment industry.<br>
An overwhelmingly female crowd cheered that definition of feminist, 
articulated by Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Adiche as “a person who 
believes in the social, economic and political equality of the sexes,” 
when it was projected on screen at M&amp;T Bank Stadium in Baltimore 
last night.<br>
Knowles-Carter’s feminism broadens from that starting point in ways that
 might confound her predecessors. This is an audience that takes obvious
 pleasure in Knowles-Carter’s enjoyment of her own body and sexuality, 
and a group of listeners that can accommodate a reference to an ugly 
incident of violence between Ike and Tina Turner in a love song with the
 idea of Knowles-Carter as a liberated woman. (It was also a crowd that 
gleefully chanted along with choruses of “Tom Ford!” in Jay Z’s song of 
the same name from the cheap seats — Knowles-Carter’s class analysis 
doesn’t extend much beyond the idea of pay equality.)<br>
Jay Z is a sparer performer than his wife, which is not to diminish his 
ability to give a crowd an excellent, stadium-vibrating time.<br>
<br>
While Knowles-Carter ran the audience through a wide range of emotional 
experiences, alternating between poses as a dominant mogul, an abandoned
 woman and a joyful lover, Jay Z, dressed in the flag, posing in front 
of flag backdrops and bathed in red and blue light, evangelized for the 
idea of partying as an act of liberation. “Ni**as in Paris,” the song he
 recorded with Kanye West for their 2011 collaboration “Watch the 
Throne,” and which made a triumphant appearance last night, is a louche 
celebration of the idea that black access to wealth and certain cultural
 experiences carries an almost moral force to it.<br>
Springsteen’s characters had more modest dreams than partying in Paris 
or knocking a Warhol off its place in a foyer. But they never had to 
assert their rights to aspire to better things in the first place.<br>
The central conceit of the “On the Run” tour, a series of videos that 
feature Jay Z and Knowles-Carter on a crime spree together, does not 
really hang together. However many thongs Knowles-Carter dons on stage, 
there is a wholesome quality to her celebrations of marital sexuality 
and discipline in business that makes her an implausible outlaw. Jay Z’s
 acting talents don’t extend particularly far beyond looking impassive 
through a cloud of cigar smoke.<br>
Even though the video interludes mostly serve the functional purpose of 
building in time for costume changes, by the end of the evening, I 
wondered if they were building to something larger. Knowles-Carter ended
 the evening in a dress with a black-and-white American flag print, 
delivering a tender serenade to home videos of the couple’s daughter 
Blue Ivy, Jay Z standing by her side and urging the audience to sing 
along with his wife.<br>
This is what it means to be fully human, and to live out a complex 
vision of the American dream. You can play with outlaw tropes while 
retaining your essential respectability. You can remember your past 
without being weighted down by it. You can take pleasure in sex and love
 without being rendered unfit for professional success, and without 
being branded a slut.<br>
It is only a small slice of Americans who have access to that ability to
 defy easy categorizations, much less to the Tom Ford suits, bottles of 
Armand de Brignac and the high-end art acquisitions that accessorize it.
 If Bruce Springsteen set the standards for the minimum his fellow 
citizens might be able to achieve, Jay Z and Knowles-Carter are 
exploring audacious new territory. It is up to those of us filing out of
 the stadium to figure out how to achieve both Springsteen’s floor and 
Jay Z and Knowles-Carter’s limitless ceiling.<br>

AUTHORS' NOTE: Recently we decided to collaborate on an essay about 
Bruce Springsteen for this issue. What follows is our E-mail 
conversation about Bruce, 'recorded' over a period of about three weeks 
in October. In the great tradition of live rock and roll albums, we 
spent many hours in the studio, editing our comments to make them 
'right,' but we hope the spontaneity of our online performance survives 
the editing process, and we invite you to have 'bad conversations' of 
your own — and share them with Bad Subjects.<br>

The first and only Springsteen concert I attended was in 1978, during 
his tour in support of Darkness on the Edge of Town. I was fifteen and 
living in Houston, and while I was a frequent concert-goer, Springsteen 
was something 'special,' a big deal in the way that other concerts were 
not. Partly this was because Springsteen had not toured in several years
 due to the legal hassles that had delayed the release of Darkness, but 
it was also due to already well-established reputation as The Greatest 
Rock and Roll Performer Of Our Times. A Springsteen concert promised 
three or four hours of the main attraction, with no warm up band. I got 
what I wanted; it was one of the most memorable shows I ever attended, 
even though we had lousy seats to the side of the stage. In particular, I
 remember Springsteen's then-new version of 'Santa Claus is Coming to 
Town,' with thousands of Xmas lights adorning the stage facade, and the 
thrill of hearing a song that was available only in concert — a thrill 
experienced several times as Springsteen and the E-Street Band played 
two or three other new songs that turned up on The River two years 
later. I also remember the final encore, with all the lights on and 
everybody dancing like crazy in the aisles and on their seats.<br>
<br>
Indeed, when The River was released I had to have it so bad that, even 
though I was working for a record store, I went out and bought a copy 
from our competition, because our shipment hadn't arrived yet. I still 
have a polaroid of my 17 year-old self, looking very 1970s in long, 
feathered hair and a velour shirt, standing in Record Town checking out 
the new album's liner notes. But as much as I liked that album, 
Springsteen was by then just another rock star that I enjoyed listening 
to; I never became a die-hard Springsteen fan in any serious sense of 
the term. I've never even read Dave Marsh's classic biography, Born to 
Run. I have, however, continued to purchase and enjoy all of 
Springsteen's records up to the most recent, with the exception of the 
live album, which is where I drew the line at cash investment in his 
career.<br>
<br>
STEVEN<br>
<br>
The first time I saw Bruce Springsteen in concert was in October of 
1975. I was very sick the day of the show; as we parked our car in a lot
 next to the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, my wife handed me a bag and I
 began puking into it. She got out of the car, where she was immediately
 hit on by a guy asking if we had any extra tickets. Peering into the 
car where I was still barfing, she replied, 'I don't know, wait a 
second.' I wonder now why it was that, even before I had experienced 
Bruce live, I was already in obsessive fan mode: no way I was missing 
this concert! After the show, which was great, the greatest, the 
greatest of the greatest blah blah blah, I knew I would suffer through a
 lot more than a mere vomit attack to see Bruce in concert again.<br>
<br>
And see him again I did. Once in '76, three times in '78 (at one of 
which I touched Bruce on his boot, leading me to drive around for years 
with a bumpersticker on my car that read 'I Touched Bruce Springsteen'),
 five times in '80 (all in one week, in three cities: Portland, Oakland 
and Los Angeles), once at a Gary U.S. Bonds club date in the early 80s, 
once during the Born in the USA tour, twice at SuperStar benefit shows, 
once during the Tunnel of Love tour, and twice during the recent No More
 E Street Band Tour. And I'd go see him tomorrow if he was playing in 
the vicinity. For me, once was not enough.<br>
<br>
Why did I do this? Why do I continue to do this? It isn't just his 
music; I love it, but I can listen to his music at home. What is the 
concert experience offering me that keeps me coming back for more? And 
why Bruce, and not any of my many other faves? Are his concerts THAT 
good?<br>
<br>
My musical taste isn't exactly esoteric, and I don't shun the popular 
merely because it is popular. On the other hand, I think the Velvet 
Underground is the greatest rock and roll band of all time, which may 
not seem like much now, but they were most definitely esoteric in 1967 
when I was 14 years old and living in a white working-class Bay Area 
suburb and no one else was singing about Heroin. So I am not unduly 
impressed with the popular ... but ever since the first time I saw Bruce
 in concert, I wanted every single person I knew to experience him, as 
well. I wanted him to be the most popular musical artist in the world; I
 wanted to share him with everyone.<br>
<br>
And I still haven't explained what exactly it was about his concerts 
that made me such a fan/believer. Another anecdote: it's 1985, and Bruce
 is at the peak of his popularity, having finally won over virtually the
 entire music community (with the important exception of black fans ... 
Bruce was always very unfunky). I am sitting in rightfield at the 
Oakland Coliseum, part of a stadium-filling crowd of some 60,000. Bruce 
is on a stage in the centerfield bleachers. Most of the audience is 
watching him on one of the enormous video screens that have become de 
rigueur at such events. For some of his longtime fans, this concert tour
 of football stadiums is the ultimate expression of Bruce's downfall: 
too popular to play the small venues where he had shown so many of us so
 many good times, he was reduced to a tiny figure on a real stage, or a 
giant figure on a fake video.<br>
<br>
But when he played 'Glory Days,' the entire stadium was in heaven, 
dancing, singing along, rapturous smiles on our faces. Bruce Springsteen
 remains the only performer I have seen who could turn a football 
stadium into a corner bar. And it was the best damn corner bar in the 
world, because we had 60,000 of our closest friends with us.<br>
<br>
Rock and roll, especially as it has been interpreted by fans who grew up
 in the 1960s, is supposed to be about creating a massive community 
around 'our' music. The belief in a mass community is not a bad one; it 
has fueled more than a few prospective utopias. However, the reality of a
 mass utopia centered around a commodity like rock and roll music has 
become, over time, little more than a joke. Indeed, any remnants of a 
belief in such a possibility for music is often denigrated as the worst 
example of cheap 60s nostalgia. Lester Bangs understood what was 
happening to the mass rock and roll audience when he wrote, on the death
 of Elvis, 'We will never again agree on anything as we agreed on Elvis.
 So I won't bother saying good-bye to his corpse. I will say good-bye to
 you.'<br>
<br>
And then there was Bruce, about whom Greil Marcus wrote in a slightly 
different context, 'A concert by Bruce Springsteen offers many thrills, 
and one is that he performs as if none of the above is true.' In Bruce, 
we had community. Though Marcus later wrote, while musing over Bruce's 
megastardom, 'When Springsteen plays in a coliseum filled with sixty 
thousand people, what is at issue is not the size of the audience, but 
the intensity of its desire to be confirmed as an audience,' in fact I 
think Marcus' earlier quotation is still applicable, which is why I was 
so happy to share Bruce with all those 'Glory Days' fans at that 
coliseum. We did not want to be confirmed as an audience ... we wanted 
to be confirmed as a community.<br>
<br>
JOE<br>
<br>
I believe there's a certain amount of truth to the claim that 
Springsteen's concerts really are something special, that he is a 
charismatic showman and performer like no other that post-Elvis rock 
music has produced. There's no arguing with the way fans like yourself 
respond to Springsteen; I would just want to point out that he does not 
'work' in that way for everyone. For example, I am invested in Star Trek
 in much the same way that you are invested in Springsteen. However, I 
know that even though there are millions of Trek fans out there whose 
appreciation borders on a kind of worship (which is true on a lesser 
scale of the cult of Bruce, too), the idea that there is something 
intrinsic or essential to Star Trek that produces the investment falls 
apart when you consider the larger number of people for whom the show 
simply doesn't hold any special appeal. (As opposed to people who bash 
the show, or who like it but are ashamed to admit it — both of these 
groups clearly have some kind of investment going.)<br>
<br>
The desire to be recognized or confirmed as a 'community' and not just 
as an 'audience' is not peculiar to Springsteen fans; Trekkers gather 
together in mass at their conventions for similar reasons. However, as I
 argued in my essay 'As if We Were a Community' (Bad Subjects #1, 
September 1992), just because a mass gathering like a concert (or a Trek
 convention or a gay pride parade) makes us feel confirmed as a 
community doesn't mean that we in fact are a community. Rather, we are a
 market of consumers who have paid for a commodity (the live show), one 
of the pleasures of which is that it allows us, for a limited time, to 
feel like we're part of a big community. The feeling you describe is 
part of what we pay to consume, not a 'surplus pleasure' above and 
beyond the commodity of the performance itself. I note that Greil 
Marcus, in the quote you provide, does not go so far as to say that 
Springsteen actually overcomes the problem of a 'mass utopia centered 
around a commodity,' but only says that Springsteen 'performs as if none
 of the above is true.' Which, now that I think of it, is like saying 
that Springsteen is so compelling because, even if his performance is a 
kind of lie, at least he acts like he means it.<br>
<br>
And that suggests a way of understanding the connection between 
Springsteen and Ronald Reagan, which otherwise might be dismissed as 
merely historical: the fact that Springsteen reaches the peak of his 
popularity at exactly the same moment that Reagan reaches his, 1984-85, 
the moment of 'Morning in America' and 'Born in the USA.' Both 
performers are known for their capacity to convey the quality of 
'sincerity' in their performances of their 'authentic' selves; both 
achieved the greatest mass appeal by linking their personas to symbols 
of American patriotism. One might wish to protest that while Reagan was 
clearly a big manipulative fake, Springsteen is the genuine article, but
 I would point out that there are plenty of Reagan fans who would argue 
just the reverse. How you see the question of authenticity depends 
almost entirely on one's position as a consumer of either of these two 
public personalities: if you're inside the fan 'community,' he's 
sincere, but if you're outside, he's phony.<br>
<br>
I would also add that rock music fans, perhaps more so than any other 
popular culture audiences, are deeply invested in the distinction 
between the 'authentic' and the merely 'commercial,' despite the 
well-established fact that such distinctions are always breaking down. 
Thus we have the irritating but amusing case of 'alternative' music 
culture, which buys and sells its music just like any other market, 
while insisting in its routinely snotty way that because its music is 
more difficult and unpleasant to listen to, it is more 'authentic.' 
Hence the many pseudo-debates about a band like Nirvana, which has 
implicitly destroyed the whole mystique of 'alternative' music by 
becoming a mainstream phenomenon without sacrificing its dissonant sound
 and sneering attitude. Consider the ironies of a recent headline for a 
story in the entertainment section of the San Francisco Sunday paper: 
'Grunge Hits Pay Dirt: Anti-establishment postpunkers make big bucks in 
mainstream' (SF Chronicle 'Datebook,' October 24, 1993).<br>
<br>
The case of alternative music culture points up the basic problem in 
'communities' organized around taste preferences in popular culture: 
since it's all commercial culture, rooted in the buying and selling of 
commodities, there's not much more than attitude and self-assertion to 
distinguish one 'community' of fans from another in any absolute terms. I
 mean, what's the difference between the alternative music crowd versus 
the Springsteen crowd versus the country crowd versus the soul crowd 
(etc.) beyond the specifics of their taste preferences in music, 
fashion, and attitude? No wonder popular music has been the locus of so 
many theoretical and critical efforts to decode the 'meanings of style' 
and to emphasize what the music means to the fans themselves. Returning 
to a point made above: considered subjectively, all these various fan 
'communities' feel their own music and its culture is very, very 
different from the others; but considered objectively, they are all 
versions of the same thing, never sounding so much alike as when they 
are insisting upon their distinctiveness. From this perspective, the 
contempt for the mainstream which is so much a part of the alternative 
music scene is a measure of how hard it has to work to deny to itself 
how much it resembles what it claims to despise (in other words, no 
surprise here, what the alternative music fans really despise is 
themselves).<br>
<br>
And if this internal divisiveness is true of the audience for popular 
music generally, then it will also be true within specific fan 
audiences, such as the fifty thousand Springsteen fans who, according to
 you, Steven, all responded to 'Glory Days' just as you did... Or did 
they? That's the question I want to raise, using the case of 1984 and 
the popular reception of both the album and the single of 'Born in the 
USA.'<br>
<br>
It seems pretty clear that something happened to Springsteen with the 
release of that album and the explosion of his mass appeal that 
followed: the available meanings of his image and his music were altered
 forever (even for the fans who argue against such an idea). At the time
 the album came out, I still suffered from the knee-jerk 'popularity is 
always inauthentic' reflex common to the young, alienated and 
overeducated. Even though I really liked the music on the album, I 
became somewhat sniffy and disdainful as it turned Springsteen into that
 year's mega-star (or rather, the other one after Reagan himself). It 
didn't help that the song 'Born in the USA' (which I still think is one 
of the most powerful pieces he's ever done) was being received and 
appropriated by much of the public as a Reaganesque national anthem of 
born-again patriotism.<br>
<br>
But who's to say that people were wrong in doing so? While Springsteen 
fans might argue that a right-wing take on the song wasn't Springsteen's
 fault, since the song is 'really' a bitter reflection on how America 
has abused and neglected its Vietnam veterans, it's clear that the way 
in which the album and the artist were packaged tended to invite such 
'misreadings.' There's the American flag on the cover with Bruce in 
front (well, Bruce's butt, anyway): red, white, and blue-jeans. And then
 there's Springsteen himself, clean-shaven and newly experienced with 
Nautilus equipment. Gone is the scruffy and scrawny street poet, 
replaced by a wholesome, buff and all-American Bruce (OK, I admit it 
worked for me). The video for 'Dancing in the Dark' only reinforced the 
conservative implications of the packaging: Springsteen, who had 
hitherto made only 'artistic' videos in which he did not himself appear 
(for the 'artistically serious' and thus not much fun album Nebraska), 
was now being offered up as teen idol and fantasy heart-throb.<br>
<br>
Now, all I want to ask you, Steven, is the following: is this your 
Bruce? And if not, what do you do with the fans who got turned on to his
 music and performances because they responded to these 'misreadings' of
 Bruce's image? The very fact that Springsteen was trying so hard to be 
inclusive, to build a 'community' through his music that was as broad as
 possible, was in some sense the undoing of that 'community.' Because it
 isn't a community, but a market of consumers; the bond is that of the 
'cash nexus' (as Marx and Engels put it), not a shared history of common
 work and common goals. So why shouldn't the reception of 'Born in the 
USA' as fist-pumping celebration of vaguely fascistic American 
nationalism be just as legitimate a response as any other? Were the 
people who appropriated Springsteen's music in 'right-wing' ways also 
confirmed as part of the same community you felt yourself to be a part 
of?<br>
<br>
STEVEN<br>
<br>
First, I agree with Joe that my definition of 'my Bruce' is problematic,
 for precisely the reasons Joe mentions. There was a time when any one 
Bruce fan could somehow speak for ALL Bruce fans; we all had our 
personal experiences with Bruce, but part of being a Bruce fan was being
 a member of the shared history of the Bruce Fan Community. You knew you
 were safe letting another Bruce fan 'represent' all Bruce fans, and you
 knew any Bruce fan was a friend of any other Bruce fan. (Whether this 
was in actuality the case is irrelevant; the belief that it was the case
 is what matters.) With the mega-stardom of Born in the USA, though, the
 above assumptions could no longer be categorically true. Now, a Bruce 
fan could be, well, a 'non-Brucefan.' I can never remember, in any of 
the dozen Bruce concerts I saw in the pre-Born in the USA days, thinking
 about any of my fellow audience members that they were 'different' from
 me. But, beginning with the Born in the USA tour and continuing to this
 day, we 'Brucefans' regularly are confronted with fellow audience 
members who aren't 'really' Brucefans (they generally check out babes 
and wait for the opening chords of 'Born in the USA' before they get up 
in drunken glee to punch their fists in the air). And we are stuck with 
the problem endemic to all groups who wish to expand their horizons to 
include 'everyone': once confronted with 'everyone' we aren't so sure we
 want them in our group, after all.<br>
<br>
I also think Joe hits on something important in his references to 
authenticity and the Bruce Concert Experience. One surprise for many 
first-time Bruce concertgoers is how 'stagey' his show is; for some 
reason, the influence of West Side Story isn't as commonly stated in 
articles about Bruce as the influence of, say, Gary U.S. Bonds, and when
 people do mention West Side Story, it is primarily to note the 
similarity of early Bruce songs like 'Jungleland' to West Side Story in 
terms of subject matter and melodramatic musical appeal. But, as Dave 
Marsh once said, a Bruce concert is about as spontaneous as Pearl 
Harbor, and there is an almost Broadway feel to the manner in which 
Bruce uses lighting and music cues and his own considerable acting 
ability to, yes, 'manipulate' his audience. Why does such an obviously 
manipulative performer, then, inspire such a belief from his fans that 
Bruce is somehow more 'authentic' than other rockers?<br>
<br>
Partly, the audience seems to be celebrating the work ethic. No one 
works longer or harder in concert than Bruce, and he has regularly 
stated in interviews over his entire career that he feels he owes his 
fans every ounce of his energy and ability, every time he hits the 
stage. This might also explain why, even after Bruce made the Forbes 
list of highest-paid entertainers, his fans 'believed' in Bruce's 
solidarity with the working-class: he might be making $40 million a 
year, but he WORKED his butt off for that $40 million. In 1980, I saw 
Bruce five times in one week in three cities separated by a thousand 
miles; it was clear at the time that the best way to emulate my hero was
 to WORK hard at being the best fan I could possibly be.<br>
<br>
But, for those of us who have seen Bruce time and time again, there is 
also an appreciation of the familiarity of Bruce's routines that we 
respond to positively. Rarely, if ever, has Bruce Springsteen 
represented something new: Born To Run sounded like the history of music
 from 1954-1975 when it came out, and it still sounds like that history,
 but it most certainly does NOT sound like the 'future of rock and roll'
 circa 1975. There is nothing in Born To Run to suggest that the next 
two decades of popular music would include disco, punk, new wave, rap, 
hip hop, rave, and Garth Brooks. There is a built-in nostalgia factor in
 Born To Run; to give oneself to the world of Born to Run in 1975 was to
 feel a part, not only of the moment, but of history. We paradoxically 
remembered the music the very first time we heard it. Subsequent replays
 over the course of the past twenty years have added to that feeling of 
nostalgia. The familiarity we have with Bruce's music is part of what we
 like about it; again, it makes us feel like a community with a common 
history. Bruce becomes 'authentic' in this scenario, not because he is 
somehow more 'real' than other performers, but because ever since he 
first entered our consciousness, his 'inauthenticity' drew on the same 
'fake' cultural elements that we used in creating our own public and 
private personas. We share a fake culture. Bruce 'authentically' relies 
on this fake culture to inform his own art and, by extension, his own 
life. He uses the inauthentic in authentic ways. He 'believes in hope 
that can save.' His belief is authentic; when he performs for an 
audience, that belief (in the liberating possibilities of rock and roll)
 comes across in a very un-ironic way. In a cynical world, Bruce's 
belief in liberation is authentic.<br>
<br>
What remains is the question of how this un-ironic belief in himself and
 his art is any different from the similar belief of a Wayne Newton. 
Bruce fans believe that Bruce believes, but one imagines that the 
audience for Wayne Newton in Vegas believes the same about their hero.<br>
<br>
JOE<br>
<br>
Of course, this opens up the much more difficult problem of deciding 
which cultural texts and/or artists are 'really' authentic. Ultimately I
 think that the battles over cultural taste preferences — the need to 
feel that 'my pleasure is better than your pleasure' — are an enormous 
spectacle which serves to distract us from more fundamental political 
and social questions. Of course, popular culture is a great point of 
entry for engaging such questions, but what frustrates me about the way 
the debate is usually mounted, especially among fans themselves, is that
 the discussion seldom moves very far beyond the Beavis-and-Butthead 
paradigm of 'cool' versus 'sucks.' That is, most of what fans have to 
say, whether they are just ordinary folks or professional 'critics,' 
boils down to some version of the following: 'This is really great, 
authentic and meaningful because I get so much pleasure out of it; and 
since my pleasure seems authentic to me, the source of it must be, too. 
And if you don't feel the same way, then you have no right to criticize 
or judge.' Or people take the reverse position: 'I think this is stupid,
 boring, derivative crap, and anybody who likes it must be a moron.'<br>
<br>
The problem is that you can't dispute subjective feelings: if somebody 
tells me that something gives them pleasure, I don't have much grounds 
for an argument. So at the level of the individual and his or her taste 
preferences, all choices are indeed more or less equal; Springsteen, 
Wayne Newton, Star Trek and alternative rock all 'work' in pretty much 
the same way for their respective fan audiences. But at the level of the
 social and political, I think that some taste preferences are better 
than others, that a passionate investment in Springsteen or Star Trek is
 more morally defensible than a similar investment in Wayne Newton or 
alternative rock. I confess that there are limits to my liberal 
pluralism.<br>
<br>
However, I'm not going to take the time here and now to defend such a 
provocative statement; rather, I just want to use it to underscore the 
powerfully divisive consequences of identities formed through taste 
preferences and commodity consumption. We spend too much of our time as a
 society and culture fighting over objects and their consumption, trying
 to decide what are the 'right' sorts of objects and the 'right' ways to
 consume them. The steady increase in the amount of attention we devote 
to cultural consumption should be understood as a measure of the extent 
to which, individually and collectively, we are becoming more and more 
alienated from both the idea and the practice of political community. 
Many people search for an experience of real community through popular 
culture; but being a part of a particular target market cannot satisfy 
the desire for membership in a community. All we can get is a temporary 
feeling of community, which lasts not much longer than the act of 
consumption, and then fades away, which is why we must consume 
repeatedly; a substitute gratification always remains a substitute, 
distracting from the real needs and desires but not satisfying them.<br>
<br>
But — as you have always argued so well, Steven — even if popular 
culture is 'just' a set of symptoms, it still provides us with useful 
tools for social and political analysis; we can read the symptoms for 
the underlying conflicts. Which, to conclude, brings me back again to 
'Born in the USA.' The response to that song, and that particular moment
 in Springsteen's career, makes sense as a kind of logical end-point of 
the message that Springsteen had been communicating through his music. 
That message is both paradoxical and coherent; commenting on the song 
'Born to Run,' Dave Marsh explains it this way:<br>
<br>
'The lyrics are still remarkable, sketching a philosophy of determined 
outward rebellion, a desire to move, a sense of goals and purpose that 
skirt the edges of the larger-than-life. But this hopeful abandon is 
tempered by an equally powerful melancholy; the future seems so bright 
largely because the present's so dismal.' (The Heart of Rock and Soul: 
The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made.)<br>
<br>
With 'Born in the USA,' I think that Springsteen hit upon a kind of 
perfect distillation of his message: a bitter and angry song about how 
American society uses and betrays the ordinary man, but also how those 
same ordinary men affirm their American identity despite the bitterness,
 because the depth of their disappointment is the measure of their 
investment in its promise. Unlike alternative music, with its own 
paradoxical combination of self-loathing and arrogantly smug 
superiority, the sort of rock music that Springsteen represented at 
least offered the hope that there was a place for everyone, that we 
could use the music to work together to build something better. There 
was even a place for the assholes who punched the air with their fists 
to the chords of 'Born in the USA.' In looking at Springsteen's career 
since then, it's as though he saw quite clearly how hard it would be to 
sustain that hope in the face of the problems of inclusiveness, and he 
retired to a more personal and introspective stance. So what lesson 
might Springsteen be said to offer us, in his career and his music? 
Perhaps it's just the simple one that we shouldn't expect our 
commodities, no matter how much they 'work' for us, to provide us with 
the communities we desire; we can only do that ourselves, by working 
with each other.<br>

Joe's analysis is intelligent, and though I think he is too harsh on 
alternative music (when Joe Strummer sang that he wanted to walk down 
any street looking like a creep, he may have been arrogantly thumbing 
his nose at the 'popular,' but he was also including in his walk all of 
us who felt like creeps, a step nearly as inclusive as anything Bruce 
Springsteen has done), I think what he has written here works 
beautifully as a Bad Subjectian view of the flaws in the notion of a 
community based on the common consumption of commodities.<br>
<br>
I also thank Joe for coming up with the idea of this article in the 
first place. Much as I love Bruce Springsteen, I had never tried to 
write anything about him; this piece has given me a chance to think 
about Bruce, and has thus been a wonderful experience for me.<br>
<br>
And now, while wanting to avoid the anti-intellectualism implicit in a 
mere celebration of what we love, I feel the need to end this essay with
 such a celebration, for to write about Bruce without attempting to 
convey my feelings for him and his work would be a lie.<br>
<br>
Being popular has never been a problem for Bruce in the way it is for 
alternative bands like Nirvana. He has never been content with only an 
'alternative' audience, and so he is committed to a long run of being a 
popular artist. He wants to maintain his artistic vision and integrity, 
but reaching out to as many fans as possible is a part of that vision, 
and so he can't just turn his back on the popular. Instead, Bruce is a 
prime candidate for the Tony Bennett of the Boomer Generation, the one 
guy who will be most fondly honored in his later years.<br>
<br>
Bruce can't abandon his fans by destroying himself, like the Sex Pistols
 did, or even attempt to abandon them by upping the artistic ante, as 
Nirvana is trying to do, because his fans are a part of his art. We 
recognize this; it is a large part of what makes us love Bruce 
Springsteen more than other favorite performers. For me, 'Rosalita' is 
Bruce's loving call to his audience, as beautiful a metaphor for his 
relationship to us fans as 'Can't Help Falling In Love' was for Elvis. 
In 'Rosalita,' Bruce comes wailing into town to rescue Rosie from her 
mom and dad and her boring old town. He ain't there on business, baby, 
he's only there for fun. Reminding us that closets are for hangers, 
Bruce sneaks us out the bedroom window in the middle of the night and 
drives us down the road to a pretty little place in Southern California 
where they play guitars all night and all day, so hold on tight! The 
music is the most delirious of all of Bruce's songs, and the song served
 as a show-closer for Bruce for many years. Songs like 'Born to Run' 
promised us the world just around the corner, but 'Rosalita' drove us 
around that corner, burning rubber, and delivered us from evil.<br>
<br>
But because his fans are a part of his art, Bruce must move forward with
 tiny steps, if he is to move forward at all, because he can't lose the 
past that his longtime fans represent and still remain 'himself.' 
However, Bruce Springsteen is also a vital artist, one who continues to 
produce vibrant work, and also one who at times must feel constrained by
 the need to remain loyal to the fans who are loyal to him. And so, 
during the Tunnel of Love tour in 1988, he tried a different, more 
'adult' approach to his concerts. When I saw him, the first half of the 
show focused on his new album, with its mature love songs and relatively
 subdued musical presentation. It was wonderful music, played with 
heartfelt emotion, and it insisted on its difference from what Bruce had
 done before. As a fan, I appreciated this music, but then, I appreciate
 a lot of music; I LOVE Bruce, and so there was something disappointing 
about that first set.<br>
<br>
Then Bruce came back for the second half, and he and the E Street Band 
tore into one monster number after another with the glee of a teenager 
and the consummate professionalism that years of playing together had 
brought them. He sang his greatest oldies; he sang the great oldies of 
others that he had made his own; he rocked and rocked and rocked some 
more. It might have been the finest ninety minutes of Bruce Springsteen I
 had ever seen, and I had seen a lot of Bruce Springsteen.<br>
<br>
But, in its clear acceptance of the difference between the Bruce of 
'Tunnel of Love' and the Bruce of 'Little Latin Lupe Lu,' it was also a 
harbinger of the future. Bruce's art needed to move on, but he was too 
devoted to his audience to move forward too quickly. And so he took 'one
 step up and two steps back.'<br>
<br>
By his next tour, the E Street Band was gone, replaced by an assortment 
of lesser-knowns, though the Professor remained on keyboards. Bruce no 
longer sings other people's oldies; as he said many times during the 
tour, he's been around so long now he has his own oldies, and indeed, 
since 'Born to Run' sounded like an oldie the day it came out, he's 
probably right. (He also only sang 'Rosalita' once on the entire tour.) 
Clearly Bruce hopes that by detaching himself from his old band, he can 
accomplish the artistic move forward, even as he continues to work 
harder than anyone to provide his longtime fans with the best show he 
can give them. One thing hasn't changed; though the songs are different,
 the spirit is the same. In 'Born to Run' Bruce sang that someday we 
would get to that place where we really wanted to go; now he sings that 
the Light of Day is just around the corner. One day we'll get there ... 
until then, tramps like us ...<br>

<br>
FEBRUARY 15, 2014 <br>
THE AUSTRALIAN</strong><br>
<br>
THEY compare watching Springsteen to a religious experience, and 32,000 
Melburnians got seriously Brucified at AAMI Park on Saturday night.<br>
It started incredibly with Pearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder joining the 
Boss to open proceedings with a cover of AC/DC’s Highway to Hell, 
staying around to sing part of the Springsteen classic Darkness on the 
Edge of Town.<br>
<br>
Then mid set because he’d been here last year and didn’t want “to do the
 same thing again”, Springsteen casually announced the E Street Band 
would play the entire Born in the USA album from start to finish, a 
first for Australia.<br>
It was a moment the phrase “Like a Boss” was invented for.<br>
<br>
Playing his biggest album in its entirety, he added rarely aired hits 
including Cover Me, I’m on Fire, Glory Days and My Hometown.<br>
It was another example rewarding fans with a bespoke concert each night with wildly differing song selections.<br>
<br>
This tour also sees the guitar dream team of stalwart Stevie Van Zandt 
joined by newbie Tom Morello. The latter’s work on High Hopes was jaw 
dropping, while Van Zandt helps steer the cover of Australian band the 
Saints’ Just Like Fire Would.<br>
Most of all it’s Springsteen’s passion that’s infectious. Last night 
from a sea of signs requesting songs Springsteen played the “very 
obscure” cover Joel Blon, noting it was a “good call”. It was followed 
by the “not so obscure” Hungry Heart.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is in a league of his own and it is heartening to see how 
many kids are at these shows witnessing how it’s done properly.<br>
<br>
This was more than just a Springsteen show. Melbourne rocker Dan Sultan 
is poised to break into the mainstream with his new album and was 
perfectly at home in a stadium.<br>
The reformed Hunters &amp; Collectors were the perfect opening act and 
sounded seriously incredible, adapting Throw Your Arms Around Me into a 
plea for compassion towards asylum seekers.<br>
<br>
AAMI Park again proved what a great venue it is for the right act, with great outdoor sound.</div>

<br>
•	SAM KELTON MUSIC WRITER<br>
•	THE ADVERTISER<br>
•	FEBRUARY 12, 2014 </strong><br>
<br>
<br>
AFTER more than 40 years on the rock’n’roll road, Bruce Springsteen gave
 Adelaide the Boss we’ve all been waiting for and made up for lost time 
with a mammoth three-hour-plus, career-spanning set on Tuesday night.<br>
His sold-out show had fans packed into the Entertainment Centre and 
Springsteen and his legendary E Street Band played their first ever 
concert here without a backdrop, creating an almost intimate 
in-the-round show.<br>
Springsteen wasted no time screaming “Adelaide, why is it so f..... hot 
here” before he and his 17-piece band launched into a rocking version of
 Summertime Blues, then took us right back to the beginning of rock with
 his Detroit Medley.<br>
Then it was the Boss at what he does best with the anthemic Badlands ringing out to deafening screams.<br>
After 40 minutes he was barely breaking a sweat as the unofficial 
American anthems of 2012, We Take Care of our Own and Wrecking Ball, had
 Adelaide taking part in a fist pumping singalong.<br>
His energy was infectious, and his presence commanding — and you could 
close your eyes and imagine he was singing to just you but he inclusion 
of both Stevie Van Zandt and Tom Morello on this tour made sure that the
 distorted guitars filled every square inch of the arena.<br>
With so many musicians on stage, the boss’s style was by no means 
cramped and all eyes were on the 64-year-old, who is in the prime of his
 life.<br>
He relished in every scream of the fans and each sign paying tribute to 
the hits that have become the soundtrack to our lives, across five 
generations.<br>
But The Boss clearly wasn’t content with his bandmates filling the arena and took to racing around it himself.<br>
Giving fans an up close and personal experience, Springsteen traversed the auditorium throughout the night.<br>
Shaking hands with fans who thought they were unlucky enough to be at 
the back, skolling a beer provided by a fan and even kissing one lucky 
lady.<br>
As usual, even veteran fans who have seen the Boss many times were unsure where the set would go next.<br>
Adelaide got to hear the ’90s era Bruce of Human Touch for the first 
time and a roaring version of Darlington County — which was sung 
predominantly to the audience behind the stage.<br>
Springsteen shredded on the guitar, giving not only the fans but his 
fellow players goosebumps before launching into Prove it All Night and 
newbie This is Your Sword, which had all the charms of many songs its 
senior.<br>
Undoubtedly the highlight of the night was when Springsteen grabbed a 
young boy out of the audience to sing Waitin’ on a Sunny Day — which 
drew a raucous response and ear to ear smiles from all who watched on.<br>
The boy was triumphantly carried on Springsteen’s shoulders before the Boss announced: “There’s the future of rock”.<br>
But things would only heat up from there.<br>
The Ghost of Tom Joad became a highlight on the Wrecking Ball tour of 
last year and, one year on from the stirring rendition, which has just 
been released on his latest record, it hasn’t lost its charms.<br>
Former Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello was unleashed in a
 show-stopping moment that displayed the exact point of two glorious 
rock worlds colliding before your eyes.<br>
Finishing with a somewhat lukewarm cover of AC/DC’s Highway to Hell 
(sorry boys, but if Angus Young can make it tougher with just him and 
his brother on guitar — you should be able to nail it with three — or 
four) and a deafening singalong of the iconic Born to Run with the 
lights on.<br>
But wait ... there’s more.<br>
Dancing in the Dark followed as many tried their hand at being Courteney
 Cox down the front before Tenth Ave Freeze Out and a spine tingling 
acoustic of Thunder Road closed off more than three hours of pure 
showmanship.<br>
The best thing is — we get to do it all over again Adelaide on Wednesday
 night, letting us once again bare witness to America’s greatest 
songwriter presenting arguably the best, most personable and uplifting 
rock show on earth.</div>

WEEKEND AUSTRALIAN<br>
FEBRUARY 17, 2014 </strong><br>
<br>
BRUCE Springsteen spent nearly eight hours on stage in Melbourne in just two concerts.<br>
<br>
The rocker played for three hours and 24 minutes on Saturday, then three
 hours and 48 minutes on Sunday, missing an 11pm AAMI Park curfew on 
both nights.<br>
Springsteen’s long time manager Jon Landau said the band “loved the 
return” to Melbourne, where the rocker first played at the Showgrounds 
in 1985 on the Born in the USA world tour.<br>
<br>
“They loved AAMI Park. They loved the atmosphere. And most of all, they 
loved the audience. We all can’t wait for the next time,” Landau said.<br>
Melbourne saw Springsteen play two of his most-loved albums in full, a 
Boss first for Australia although he has done it in the US and Europe.<br>
Springsteen played 1984’s Born in the USA in full on Saturday and 1975’s Born to Run on Sundayy.<br>
<br>
The musician played the surprise ‘album show’ card to differentiate the Melbourne shows from the ones he played last year.<br>
The Perth and Adelaide shows, where Springsteen was touring for the first time, got a ‘regular’ show.<br>
<br>
<br>
Boss fans in Sydney and Brisbane are now bracing for their own ‘album’ 
shows, perhaps of other Springsteen classic albums, to differentiate 
their 2013 and 2014 tours.<br>
<br>
The Melbourne dates continued Springsteen’s increasingly varied setlists
 for this tour, with 47 different songs played over the two nights in 
Melbourne, including obscure cover Jole Blon requested by a fan holding a
 sign.<br>
<br>
Springsteen has played 107 different songs in the 11 shows (in Australia and South Africa) on the High Hopes tour so far.<br>
<br>
Guitarist Stevie Van Zandt told News Corp that was an E Street band record.<br>
“We’ve done entire world tours doing 140 (different) songs, which is 
more than most groups, but that’s after 60 shows. We’ve broken 100 
(different) songs and that’s impressive, even for us.”<br>
<br>
Fans can now download each concert as a permanent souvenir.<br>
<br>
“The audience knows we are creating a show just for them,” Van Zandt 
said. “People get a memento of their show which is always unique. No two
 shows are the same. You want the show you were at like an audio 
T-shirt. I think we’re still getting better. I know it sounds silly to 
say that after 40 years, but it’s better in many ways.”<br>
The guitarist also said the increasingly lengthy shows were no surprise.<br>
“We started off in the ‘70s doing four-hour shows, so this seems quite 
civilised. But you’ve got to be in shape to do this show. If you don’t 
respect the show you will be hurt!”<br>
Van Zandt said playing with extra guitarist Tom Morello was a bonus for 
fans; Van Zandt missed the last Australian tour to film his SBS TV show 
Lilyhammer.<br>
<br>
<br>
“Come one come all,” Van Zandt said. “There’s plenty of room up there. 
We’re having fun with it, makes it an even four guitars. Everyone does 
something different. I know it seems a bit of a redundancy going on but 
it’s actually not. I’m not there to express myself musically. My role is
 different. I’m the lifelong best friend. We’re coming up on 50 years. 
That’s its own thing. We work the audience, I’m out there with Bruce 
every now and then, helping him interact with the audience. Nils 
(Lofgren) and Tom split up big guitar solos. It seems we’ve added rather
 than replaced. We’re doing (Ghost of) Tom Joad pretty much every night 
which we wouldn’t probably do if Tom wasn’t there. Everyone gets their 
moment to do their thing. It’s more different ways of having fun.”<br>
<br>
Eddie Vedder joined Springsteen on Saturday to perform AC/DC’s Highway to Hell and The Boss’s Darkness on the Edge of Town.<br>
After his cameo, Vedder watched the show in the moshpit. The Pearl Jam 
singer said he was given an endless supply of free beer by fans who 
recognised him.<br>
“I didn’t want to appear ungrateful,” a hung-over Vedder told the crowd at his Palais show on Sunday night.<br>
Morello posted a photo of him with Springsteen and Vedder out on the town in Melbourne after Saturday’s show.<br>
During his own show, Vedder also pointed out the journey of his first 
concert being a back row seat to see Springsteen in Chicago in 1977 to 
singing on stage with him nearly 30 years later.<br>
He covered Springsteen’s Bobby Jean and Van Zandt’s I Am a Patriot at his first Melbourne show.<br>
Springsteen’s next Australian show is Allphones Arena on Wednesday, 
Hunter Valley shows on Saturday and Sunday and the Brisbane 
Entertainment Centre on February 26.<br>
He will then play to over 75,000 New Zealanders in Auckland.<br>
Over 200,000 tickets have been sold for his 11 Australian shows on this tour.</div>
