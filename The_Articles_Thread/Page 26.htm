<br>
Bruce Pollock, Gannett Westchester Newspapers, 1978<br>
<br>
WE ROCK PUNDITS, critics and reviewers, Rockwells of good taste, 
O'Neills of moral fervor, are in reality no better than the average slob
 on the street, nose pressed up against the windowpanes of status.<br>
<br>
We have our own highly-defined Continental League where we vie in the 
standings for points, key by-lines, new discoveries, lead quotes. Each 
of us reads the daily papers to keep tabs on the opposition. Each scans 
the monthlies nervously, afraid of missing a shift in the national 
musical mood. The competition is fierce and deadly. At times sly and 
subtle, it is often hid-	den in the guise of camaraderie.<br>
<br>
Let me take you back to the summer of '74, to the Bottom Line, New 
York's famed hot spot and hangout, where the group known as Kansas was 
being showcased before the press and trade over cocktails, convivial 
chatter, and free food.<br>
<br>
I arrived early, nodding and smiling at familiar faces as I moved toward
 the free food. Halfway there I spotted a face too familiar to ignore: 
Bruce Springsteen, then as yet a budding superstar, a year away from the
 hoopla and the simultaneous covers of Time and Newsweek which are now 
media legend.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and I went all the way back. I was, in fact, one of the 
prime contenders for the title of "The Man Who Discovered Bruce 
Springsteen", along with three or four other prominent journalists – 
each convinced his case was at least as good as mine.<br>
<br>
"Hey, Bruce!" we said to each other, almost in unison, as I slid into 
the last vacant seat at his table, next to him and across from his 
manager, a photographer and the photographer's girlfriend from Ohio. 
Taking this seat I was aware of my honored status. Not every pundit was 
invited to sit at the arm of a budding superstar – and I was at his arm,
 his mouth was less than a foot from my ear. I was in position, through 
judiciously disarming tactics, to elicit virtually a column's worth of 
spicy quotes, perhaps to scoop the entire music press on some unsavory 
scandal heretofore unknown to even avid Springsteenophiles.<br>
<br>
If I maneuvered it right, perhaps I could get the photog to snap one of 
me and Springsteen together, which I could paste into my scrapbook, 
alongside the one of myself and Martin Mull. I even saw the caption: 
Bruce and Bruce – Two Rising Stars!<br>
<br>
At which point, who should saunter	by but another contender for "The Man
 Who Discovered Bruce Springsteen" title. (In the tradition of 
post-Watergate morality and candor, I shall refer to him as Deep Craw.)<br>
<br>
Now the history of my rivalry with Deep Craw for the B.S. trophy (Bruce 
Springsteen, that is) was already probably legend in the industry. 
Although I was one of the first to view the Asbury kid when he opened 
for David Bromberg one dismal evening in Boston in January, 1973, Deep 
Craw ran a cover story in his magazine on the boy a full month before my
 ecstatic review hit the stands.<br>
<br>
During the long lull before Bruce's second album, Deep Craw could be 
heard on the street, claiming to have written the liner notes for it. 
But when the album appeared, no liner notes could be found. (God, was I 
relieved!) Instead it was I who came up with the plum, the Sunday Times 
review of that album, which offered written notice to the world that I 
(as well as, of course, Springsteen) had arrived.<br>
<br>
Then the capperoo. When Rolling Stone ran the Springsteen ad, there was 
my name under the huge lead blurb. Below it, definitely in second place,
 came Deep Craw's quote, no less ecstatic, no less huge, but obviously 
outgunned. Perhaps Deep Craw had been there first, but clearly I was the
 one to watch.<br>
<br>
At the Bottom Line, Deep Craw luckily could not fit next to Bruce and 
had to settle for a seat way at the far end of the table, squeezed in 
behind the photographer's girlfriend. I chuckled as I leaned over and 
whispered a joke for Springsteen's private benefit.<br>
<br>
At which point Don Kirshner ap-peared on the horizon. Kirshner was the 
man who had signed Kansas to his label. He and I went part of the way 
back, so I had to momentarily leave the table to score a point with 
Donnie. When I returned I found that Deep Craw had swiped my seat! 
Blinded by self-pity, I stumbled into his seat, from which obscure 
outpost I sat through Kansas' set – chagrined, dumbfounded, alone.<br>
<br>
When the set ended, suddenly the then-president of Columbia Records, the
 late Goddard Lieberson, spied Springsteen and joined the table in a 
hail of hearty greetings. Room was made for the prez to sit down across 
from Bruce – right next to Deep Craw – while I was edged out even 
fur-ther from the action, forced to mutely watch as the table rapidly 
became the focal point of the entire Bottom Line, with photogs circling,
 groupies gaping, Lieberson, Deep Craw and Springsteen sharing racy 
stories and secret handshakes. (It should have been me in that seat, 
getting my mug in the Trades, nuzzling up to the president and the 
superstar!)<br>
<br>
Ever since then a certain Deep Craw has been going around town thinking 
he had the last laugh on me. Well, I'd just like to mention something if
 he's reading this (and I know he is): I have recently been in touch 
with a very high source at Columbia, who has confirmed to me exclusively
 that Bruce Springsteen's latest album will be out shortly. Although I 
have yet to hear the LP, I would like to go on re-cord right now as 
having this to say about it: "I've seen Bruce Springsteen's future... 
and his middle name is rock 'n' roll!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN &amp; THE E STREET BAND at The Capitol Theater, Passaic, New Jersey, September 19, 1978<br>
By Arlen Schumer, March 12, 2009</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band (in its longest-running version)
 have never been better, on a pure musical level, then they were during 
their 1978 Darkness On The Edge of Town tour. Sure, there have been 
larger shows, “grander” shows, shows with more spectacle; but for 
maximum rock &amp; roll, those Darkness shows can’t be beat. And of 
those shows, the September 19th concert at the Capitol Theater in 
Passaic, in Bruce’s home state of New Jersey, is (un?)arguably Bruce 
Springsteen’s single greatest live performance.<br>
<br>
Why this particular show? Because first, it was Bruce’s single largest 
audience in his career up to that point: it was broadcast up and down 
the entire East Coast, Bruce’s original fan base. This show was 
therefore not only a concert thank-you to those loyal fans, but a de 
facto live album in the making (with Bruce’s engineer on Born To Run and
 Darkness—and future Interscope Records head—Jimmy Iovine himself, 
mixing live).<br>
<br>
Though the entire Darkness tour was brilliant, and the Band always 
played at an impossible level tighter for the radio, there was something
 about this show that puts it above and beyond even the legendary Bob 
Dylan Royal Albert Hall ’66 show as greatest single rock &amp; roll show
 ever.<br>
<br>
Perhaps it was the fact that Bruce Springsteen had something to prove 
that night, certainly not to his old fans, but to the larger rock world 
listening in that had been suspect of “The Boss” ever since the Born To 
Run hype of 1975, when he absurdly made it on the covers of both Time 
and Newsweek as an unknown rocker from (gasp!) New Jersey. And when 
Bruce seemed to fade from view during a subsequent lawsuit with his 
first manager, the hype seemed justified. But not to Bruce.<br>
<br>
When he emerged three years later with Darkness, he took to the stage in
 late spring, with a wild, yet deliberate abandon—the flip side of his 
frustration over being prejudged as a “hype,” a manufactured rock star, 
thanks to the Time/Newsweek double whammy and its attendant backlash 
(and having to live up to his own manager’s hyperbole as “The Future of 
Rock &amp; Roll”). These were the demons that, in a larger sense, drove 
Bruce to not only write the songs of Darkness, but perform them with a 
hell-bent-for-leather drive and enthusiasm. And this performance is the 
best.<br>
<br>
First off, it sounds tremendous: a booming, thunderous performance 
played to diamond-hard precision, with every instrument mixed and 
balanced perfectly. It sounds exactly like the show sounded: when 
Bruce’s guitar rips into the “Prove it All Night” intro, it sounds like a
 buzzsaw’s berserk drone; when Clarence blows the first note of any 
solo, the crowd roars like when a baseball player hits a home run in the
 bottom of the ninth. I should know—because I was there.<br>
<br>
How did I get there? Let me backtrack.<br>
<br>
On the day Darkness On The Edge of Town was released (May 28, 1978), the
 record manager of Korvette’s department store (Route 4, Paramus, New 
Jersey, no longer there) told me there was a fanzine about Bruce 
Springsteen called Thunder Road; and as if in a cartoon, a light bulb 
appeared over my head—I knew I had to become the art director of this 
fanzine (I was familiar with fanzines for years at that point, due to my
 love of comic books, which had fanzines published about them since the 
early ‘60s); he gave me the name and number of its editor and publisher,
 Ken Viola, whom I called him that night with the intention of at least 
contributing to the magazine. We met soon after—I did become the 
(sort-of) art director of Thunder Road (as much as I could do while 
attending Rhode Island School of Design full-time from ’76-’80)—and we 
became good friends.<br>
<br>
Ken also worked as head of security for John Scher, the concert promoter
 and owner of The Capitol Theater, an old rock &amp; roll theater (also 
no longer there), in run-down Passaic, in north Jersey. At the time, 
Scher was promoting Bruce’s upcoming August date in Rochester, New York,
 and through Ken’s recommendation, I illustrated the special shirts for 
the road crew (you can spot a roadie wearing one in The River tour book,
 and me wearing mine in the Capitol Theater video, when Bruce comes out 
to the audience during “Spirit in The Night”—you can see me from behind,
 on the left side of the screen, wearing the black shirt with the big 
white letters that read, “Bruce Live”); it was a great break, but 
nothing compared to the break to come. To celebrate Bruce’s “homecoming”
 after the triumphant summer of Darkness to a three-night stand (the 
first of which would be broadcast up-and-down the East Coast), Scher 
wanted a special marquee designed for the Capitol. Thanks again to Ken, I
 got the job! I worked that late summer on a design built around Bruce’s
 guitar—to me, his leads were the key sound (and feel) of both the album
 and (especially) the tour. (Two of my earlier magic marker sketches are
 shown here, along with my illustration for page one of the miniature 
program book, not the cover because it had already been done by another 
artist; my image, inspired by the marquee illustration itself, was 
bootlegged—as a poster—for years.)<br>
<br>
After completing the artwork (I also illustrated page one of the 
miniature program book, seen here too, not the cover because it was 
already done; it was bootlegged as a poster for years), I negotiated my 
“fee” with Scher: six sixth-row center seats for opening night, 
September 19th (it would be only the third time I would ever see Bruce 
live, my first being his headlining debut at Madison Square Garden on 
August 21, followed by Springfield, Mass. on 9/13, but would be the 
closest I would ever be, to this day).<br>
<br>
The day came, and five classmates at RISD and I climbed into my ’74 
Plymouth Duster and drove from Providence to Passaic. Increasing the 
anticipation from all of us was the last thing Ken Viola told me before I
 left: that if we hung out after the show for about an hour, there’d be a
 good chance we’d get to meet Bruce and The Band after the show!<br>
<br>
Four hours later we were rounding the corner of Jefferson and Monroe 
streets in Passaic (I grew up in Fair Lawn, about a ten minute drive 
away), and the first thing we saw, like a beacon in the night: the 
marquee I had illustrated, suspended in the crisp, chill autumn night 
like the monolith in 2001, emitting a powerful yellow neon aura: “We’ll 
meet ‘neath that giant Capitol sign that brings this fair city light.”<br>
<br>
We all saw the show of our lives.<br>
<br>
Anyone who heard the radio broadcast live, or bought the first bootleg 
of the show, the triple-LP Piece de Resistance, or the CD bootleg years 
later, Passaic Night, or the VHS bootleg tape of only(!) the first two 
hours of the show, knows what a simply awesome, incredible show it was. 
Though all of the Darkness shows shined, and, as noted, all their prior 
radio broadcast concerts, for years, have been de facto live albums, the
 9/19/78 Capitol Theater show still stands above the rest, not the least
 because at least seven songs stand out as definitive live versions of 
not only the Darkness tour, but of Bruce’s entire career: “Streets of 
Fire,” “Promised Land,” “Prove it All Night” (with its amazing, 
extended, never-played-anymore guitar solo intro), “Candy’s Room,” 
“Because the Night,” “She’s the One” (with the equally-definitive 
prelude/cover of Buddy Holly’s “Not Fade Away”), and the extended 
“Backstreets” (with its rare “Sad Eyes” interlude).<br>
<br>
The sound mix by Iovine is crystal-clear, distinguishing each instrument
 perfectly, yet still creating a live version of Spector’s dense Wall of
 Sound (Born To Run) with sacrificing clarity (Darkness)—a breakthrough 
in live rock &amp; roll recording, to this day never duplicated or 
bettered. Listen to how full the band sounds when it kicks into the main
 theme of “Promised Land” after Bruce’s harmonica intro, or how Garry’s 
bass parries Steve’s guitar and Clarence’s sax in their solos; Max’s 
machine gun drumming at the end of “Prove it...,” Roy’s jazzy piano at 
the beginning; the seamless transition from “Not Fade Away”--with Bruce 
singing like Elvis on alternate lines--to “She’s the One,” with Steve’s 
tasty rhythm guitar licks up front in the mix; Bruce’s screaming, 
wrenching guitar solos—the greatest guitar solos, in a single show, of 
his performing career—on the aforementioned “Prove it...,” “Streets of 
Fire,” “Candy’s Room,” “Because the Night” and “Backstreets.”<br>
<br>
Ah, “Backstreets.” The dark horse candidate for Born To Run’s best deep 
cut is known for having more than one “definitive” live version. Some 
say it’s the March 4, 1977 performance in Jacksonville, Florida, for 
Bruce’s soul-shattering scream of rage, “YOU LIED!!!” during 
“Backstreet”’s interlude. Some say it’s the stream-of-consciousness, 
improvised, extended performance of the song later that month at the 
Boston Music Hall (3/25), where, at 18 minutes, it’s certainly the 
longest “Backstreets,” if not the best.<br>
<br>
The best “Backstreets” live? The most definitive? For my money, it’s The
 Capitol Theater’s, again. In addition to all the aforementioned reasons
 why everything from The Capitol is pretty much definitive, its version 
of the song’s “Sad Eyes” interlude is classic, sounding the most like 
spoken-word poetry/performance art—you can actually hear Bruce’s 
measured breathing syncopating with Roy’s music-box piano. The buildup 
of “Little girl we’ve got to stop” to its crashing crescendo sounds as 
awesome as it was to behold: the stage going pitch black (Marc 
Brickman’s hyper-dramatic lighting) on Bruce’s final “Stop!”—the crowd 
hushed and then exploding a moment later, as the band begins to 
reassemble, individual spotlights fading in until the white light finale
 of the familiar “Backstreets” theme, leading to Bruce’s aching, 
wordless howls—some of his best ever—over a most orchestral grandeur.<br>
<br>
That’s the definitive “Backstreets” live.<br>
<br>
To this day, I have yet to hear any Darkness show that can hold a candle
 to this Capitol Theater show, song for song, note for note. It’s 
perfect. It is Bruce’s de facto live album.<br>
<br>
When the show ended, we met up with Ken, and sure enough, about 45 
minutes after, Bruce and most of the E Street Band emerged from 
backstage to mill around in the seats with the maybe-two dozen fans who 
had hung around. First I saw Max, who was telling a friend of his that 
he was leaving in a minute to visit his mom. And there was Bruce, still 
drenched in sweat, entertaining about a dozen fans in a semi-circle, 
telling old drinking stories, believe it or not. Then I spotted Jon 
Landau and approached him.<br>
<br>
I introduced myself, and told him I’d love to meet the man who changed 
my life; Landau smiled in agreement, “He changed my life, too.” To my 
surprise, he went right up to Bruce and interrupted his anecdote by 
telling him there was someone special he wanted him to meet. All eyes 
turned to me. In one hand I held the original marquee art, the other had
 the Capitol program book opened to my marquee-inspired illustration, 
and I was wearing my own Rochester roadie shirt, of course. Bruce, 
without saying a word, looked it all over, sort of nodded in approval, 
and signed the artwork for me (as everyone in The Band already had, 
except for Clarence, who wasn’t there).<br>
<br>
Then I said something to Bruce, something I had been wanting to tell him
 ever since I first heard “Born To Run” over the AM radio in my mom’s 
1966 Valiant the first time in the summer of ’75, the song that started 
it all for me. I had read what rock &amp; roll meant to Bruce himself, 
how it entered his life and changed it forever. I wanted to try to 
communicate, with equal sincerity, what he meant in my life. We were 
both, surprisingly, about the same height, so I could look straight in 
his eyes. Though I must’ve worn a smile from ear to ear, I didn’t want 
to come across as just another gushing fan, so my words came out very 
evenly and carefully: “Bruce, I just want to tell you that your music 
means more to me than anything else in the world.”<br>
<br>
In the split-second I finished, there was that flash of connection in 
his eyes, when you can tell the other person knows exactly what you 
mean, from the heart. Though I had alredy known of Bruce’s even-then 
legendary generosity and sensitivity towards his fans after a show, 
nothing prepared me for his reaction.<br>
<br>
He didn’t say “thanks;” in fact, he didn’t say a word. Didn’t shake my hand, or pat me on my shoulder.<br>
<br>
He hugged me like a brother!<br>
<br>
And all I can recall is hearing some kind of spontaneous, audible 
reaction from the dozen or so fans standing around us, a burst of 
exclamation, as if to say, “The Fan meets The Idol—and that’s the way it
 should be.” Thanks to Murphy’s Law, my friend David, who shot photos 
during the show (the images seen here are the only interior color 
photography of this landmark show ever published), ran out of film. Only
 the memory remains.<br>
<br>
True fans of any artist’s work get to a point in their lives when the 
desire to meet the artist, to receive some form of personal 
acknowledgment, overwhelms even their adulation of the work itself. Most
 such fans reach that point, lots move through it. Some, like me, are 
fortunate enough to have that desire fulfilled.</div>

<br>
Adam Sweeting, Uncut, September 2002<br>
<br>
IF ALL YOU'VE ever seen of New Jersey is Newark airport or the bits they
 show you in the opening sequence of The Sopranos, you will have assumed
 it's a grimy jungle of factories, warehouses and shopping malls 
interspersed with toxic waste dumps. It's the kind of place where 
they've given up trying to count the number of corpses stirred into the 
concrete buttresses holding up the freeways. <br>
<br>
But keep driving for a couple of hours away from Manhattan and, 
eventually, you discover why cars in Jersey have "The Garden State" 
stamped on their number-plates. Once the dismal miles of urban blight 
have receded into the rear-view mirror, it's startling to find the 
landscape opening out into undulating acres of woodland and lush green 
grassland, with the occasional picturesque lake thrown in for good 
measure.<br>
<br>
Whatever mythology may surround New Jersey, Bruce Springsteen has been a
 substantial contributor. He was born in Freehold, NJ on September 23, 
1949, a few miles inland from the seaside resort of Asbury Park which 
would become the laboratory for his songwriting and the birthplace of 
the E Street Band. One of his earliest songs was titled 'Garden State 
Parkway Blues'. The last song on his new album is called 'My City Of 
Ruins', and you'd imagine it was about New York in the aftermath of 
September 11. In fact, he wrote it a couple of years ago about Asbury 
Park, a bedraggled and down-at-heel town living in hope of investment 
and redevelopment. Asbury Park now has a street dubbed Boss Boulevard, 
and the New Jersey legislature was grateful enough to one of its 
best-known sons to anoint 'Born To Run' as the state's official rock 
anthem.<br>
<br>
In the early Nineties, Springsteen and his family – which now comprises 
wife Patti, two sons and a daughter – shuttled between homes in Jersey 
and California, where Springsteen's parents had gone to live in the late
 Sixties, but lately they've shifted their centre of gravity back east. 
Most of the time, home is a farm in Colts Neck, nestling in the midst of
 gymkhana country in rural Jersey but not far from either Asbury Park or
 Freehold. As he once put it, "Where you come from is like your family 
and your best friend." Most of the farm's acres of pasture are screened 
from the main road by trees and hedges, though locals can sometimes 
catch a glimpse of Mr and Mrs Springsteen out horseriding.<br>
<br>
As we turn in through the gate and scrunch up the gravel driveway 
towards the house, Springsteen saunters out across the front lawn to say
 hi. In a loose-fitting shirt, jeans and motorcycle boots, he looks more
 like the guy who's come to grease the gearbox on the tractor than the 
neighbourhood rock'n'roll superhero. The sun is searing down under a 
perfect blue sky, so he leads the way indoors where the climate is 
controlled and the fridge is packed with cold drinks.<br>
<br>
"My friend, you are experiencing a classic Jersey summer's day," he announces with proprietorial bonhomie.<br>
<br>
We settle back in a couple of chairs in the living room, with mineral 
water and an ice bucket on the table. The room is cool and comfortable, 
furnished in down-home Jersey Rustic rather than designer minimalism or 
arthouse chic.<br>
<br>
"This area has been quite a sanctuary for me over the years," 
Springsteen reflects. "I'd say we have as relatively normal a life as 
possible under the circumstances – where everybody knows your music and 
knows who you are – but you can go to the carnival, you can go to the 
circus and nobody really bothers you. You can go to the boardwalk on a 
jammed Saturday night where there's a thousand people there and it's 
fine. People will look and say 'Hello, how you doing?', it's all 
just...it's all very do-able without much hassle, y'know?"<br>
<br>
The upstanding citizen, he's happy to be on call for collecting the 
local kids from school and ferrying them home or to sports meetings. He 
plays coach to his eldest son Evan's baseball team. Sometimes on 
Halloween, he and Patti invite the Boy and Girl Scouts around to their 
house. "It's just regular stuff, y'know," he shrugs. "It's nothing 
unusual."<br>
<br>
Even when his fame reached hysterical dimensions during the Born In The 
USA period in the mid-Eighties, Springsteen always tried to keep at 
least one boot planted on the ground. In Los Angeles at the shrieking 
zenith of Bossmania, he once amazed Tom Petty by strolling down to Tower
 Records on Sunset Boulevard to load up with a few new waxings. He even 
paid for them himself.<br>
<br>
"I think you have to make a point of behaving like a human being," 
ponders the mature tunesmith. "I understand people who feel very 
uncomfortable at a certain point with the amount of notoriety and 
attention. On one hand, obviously, you go out and you ask for it, you 
shake your butt in front of 20,000 people and part of the artist thing 
is that artists are narcissistic and self-involved and ego-driven and 
bottomless to some degree in their needs and what they want. That comes 
with the turf, I believe."<br>
<br>
This prompts one of many outbursts of wheezy laughter. When 
Springsteen's funny bone gets tickled, he can sound incongruously like 
Dick Dastardly's dog, Muttley.<br>
<br>
"So the question is, 'OK, that's me, but how do I manage those things? 
Do I manage them well?' In the end it's the measure of your ability to 
deal with the whole thing. I've met people who are nervous about going 
out for one reason or another, but what we did was always kind of 'Hail 
brother!', you know? I think it transferred over to some of the people 
who listen to us and so they give you a reasonable amount of space. 
There's really nothing to it. You may have to insist on it slightly – 
I'm gonna do this no matter what' – but particularly in the past decade 
or so, when I've been less in the limelight, it's just very easy and 
very manageable."<br>
<br>
Does he worry about kidnapping or terrorism?<br>
<br>
"Well, it's one of those things. A little girl was kidnapped near here 
not long ago. It was some people who'd moved down from the city and she 
was on the lawn and luckily they got her back, and it had been done by 
somebody who was very...misguided, y'know? But it comes with the job a 
little bit. There's a certain level of security consciousness, and I do 
take extra precautions that a normal guy doesn't when it comes to my 
family and that sort of thing."<br>
<br>
The reason Springsteen has allowed Uncut to cross his perimeter is to 
put the word out about his new album, The Rising. While it would be an 
over-simplification to say the disc is exclusively 'about' the events of
 September 11, what happened that day and the aftershocks that continue 
to ripple out from it delivered a powerful jolt to Springsteen's 
creative processes. Among the album's themes you can pick out loss, 
faith, incomprehension, fear and hope, and even some all-join-hands 
celebration. As much as anything, the songs reflect the effort involved 
in trying to adjust to a world where the things you thought were stable 
and unchanging might suddenly split open to reveal a howling void 
beneath.<br>
<br>
"To me, it feels as rocky as any time since the Cuban missile crisis," 
Springsteen reckons. "I don't know if we've lived in as volatile a 
moment since that time, a moment where it feels like there's a lot of 
forces loose in the world that could go either way. There's a tremendous
 need right now for good leadership and I'm not sure that I see it out 
there, so it's a very, very volatile moment in world history without a 
doubt.<br>
<br>
"I'm certainly concerned, and I know my kids are frightened. They go 
'The terrorists! The terrorists!' They take it in, and it's become as 
much a part of their childhood language as the atom bomb was for us in 
the Fifties, and diving under the school desk, y'know? My son's always 
saying, 'What if there's a terrorist at the movies?' I'd have to go back
 there to remember a particular time in recent history when it's felt 
like this."<br>
<br>
The perilous and lopsided state of the planet had a galvanising effect 
on his working methods. The man who once ground his way through 5000 
interminable studio hours while dragging Born In The USA to completion, 
and who recorded 60 songs en route to whittling down to the final 20 
which made it onto 1980's The River, found himself galloping ahead at 
breakneck speed.<br>
<br>
"With the exception of two or three songs that I had already, the body 
of the record was probably written between September and...we finished 
up in May – about five or six months," he recalls. "The songwriting 
itself was not time-consuming. The songs formed themselves pretty 
quickly and I had a process where I'd demo them pretty fast because I 
have a studio set up – a room like this, a living room – and it enabled 
me to see if it was a good song. That really helped me weed through a 
lot of different ideas I had. But the songs were written quickly."<br>
<br>
For Boss-o-philes, the big news is that The Rising is the first studio 
album he has made with the E Street Band since Born In The USA in 1984, 
although combinations of E Streeters appeared on 1987's Tunnel Of Love. 
Aside from a couple of isolated episodes, band and Boss didn't perform 
together between the end of 1988 and spring 1999, with the reunion 
preserved on last year's Live In New York City. After such a protracted 
separation, Springsteen knew they had to take at least one step up from 
where they'd left off. Where the live album, The Ghost Of Tom Joad 
(1995) and 1998's archive-trawl Tracks were all credited to the 
co-production duo of Springsteen and long-serving studio sidekick Chuck 
Plotkin, this time he felt the need for fresh thinking and some 
different hands on the tiller.<br>
<br>
Enter Brendan O'Brien, whose production and mixing skills have made him 
studio guru du jour for a swarm of cutting-edge hard rock bands, from 
Pearl Jam and Soundgarden to Korn, Limp Bizkit, Rage Against The Machine
 and Stone Temple Pilots. Not to mention the more lived-in likes of Bob 
Dylan, Aerosmith and Mick Jagger.<br>
<br>
"I'd heard Brendan's records in the mid-Nineties," says Springsteen, 
"and they were just powerful rock records, y'know, like Pearl Jam. I 
just thought they sounded really good. I'd probably been thinking about 
working with somebody else for five or so years. After the tour, I'd 
recorded with the E Street Band for a couple of weekends in the studio. 
Everybody sounded great, but it wasn't quite what I felt was gonna be 
called for if I was gonna make a record with the band again. I felt it 
had to live up to the history of work we'd done, and I knew I didn't 
know how to do that."<br>
<br>
Bruce kicked it around with his manager and sometime co-producer Jon 
Landau, who also felt he wasn't sufficiently well versed in current 
studio techniques to climb back into the producer's chair.<br>
<br>
"We just got to a place where my abilities as a producer had reached 
their limits," Springsteen admits. "I was not in the studio regularly 
enough or recording enough different kinds of music. The sound of things
 changes every eight to 10 years, just the sound of records on the radio
 – the way the drums sound, the way the voice is treated – and those 
were the things I didn't know a lot about. I said I can't do justice to 
the band at this point by producing this thing myself or with Jon, so we
 said let's meet some other people. We knew we'd do a fine job on our 
own if we had to, but let's meet some other people and see what their 
ideas are."<br>
<br>
A meeting was duly set up with O'Brien, and Springsteen dug out some 
demos of a couple of unrecorded songs, including 'Nothing Man' and 
'Further On (Up The Road)', which would both eventually find their way 
onto The Rising. Both had been written prior to the unwelcome arrival of
 Al-Qaeda over lower Manhattan. O'Brien listened, liked what he heard, 
and began to form a mental picture of what a Springsteen/E Street album 
ought to sound like in 2002.<br>
<br>
"Really, it just came down to, 'We'd like to record some good songs if 
we can and we'd like it to be exciting'," says Springsteen, "and 
basically he said 'Yeah'. He said, 'I have a studio down south and I 
like to work there, but I can work anywhere,' so I said, 'Let's work 
where you work and where you're comfortable.' We made a date. He came 
back one other time and I'd demo'd 'Into The Fire', I had a funky little
 demo of it at the time, and I had 'You're Missing', and together we 
demo'd that and we worked together. It was something I hadn't done in a 
long time, to really collaborate over the structure and creation of one 
of my songs – I was used to doing all that myself. So we'd say, 'Oh, how
 about this in the bridge? How about this chord? How about we move this 
here? How about we wait this long?' Brendan is a musician himself, he's 
very musical and he had a lot of good ideas, so we went down south to 
Georgia and went into the studio."<br>
<br>
Before you could say "Rosalita", the sparks started flying on E Street. 
"We played 'Into The Fire' two or three times. We came out, sat down, 
and in about 20 seconds I realised this was my guy, y'know? The band 
sounded like the band, but not like I'd heard them before, and that was 
what I was looking for. I wanted it to be like 'this is the way we sound
 right now', something that my audience who have been following me for 
years will recognise and it will also be new for them. That was it, it 
was what I was looking for. I said, 'Well, as long as I can write some 
songs'...and I had two good ones there. I'd also written a couple of 
good ones on the last tour, 'American Skin' and 'Land Of Hope And 
Dreams', so l said, 'Well, y'know, I think I can find my rock voice.' 
For a while I wasn't sure if I could find that voice again, because I 
knew I didn't want it to be the voice from Born In The USA, which was 
really the last time I sang that way."<br>
<br>
As the sessions developed and they began to feel at home in Southern 
Tracks Recording in Atlanta, Springsteen found he didn't really need to 
worry. The songs he was writing arrived carrying then own sets of 
instructions about how they wanted to be performed and arranged. In the 
weird atmosphere of trauma and disorientation in the post-September 11 
fallout, he found himself acting virtually as a receiver of messages 
flashing in from his own subconscious or from out of the disturbances in
 the collective ether.<br>
<br>
"I think the second or third week in September I'd written 'Into The 
Fire' for a telethon [America: A Tribute To Heroes] they had here in the
 States after 9/11, and I was gonna sing it on the telethon, but instead
 I sang a song I already had called 'My City Of Ruins'. Then I wrote 
'You're Missing', then after that I woke up one night and I had this 
song, 'The Fuse', and so all of a sudden you have elements of the story 
you're compelled to tell at a certain moment. That you're kind of asked 
to tell. Then you look at it and listen to it and it begins to say, 
y'know, there's just a wide variety of emotional elements to make it 
thoughtful and complete, and the songs kind of present themselves as 
such and in that fashion.<br>
<br>
"It's not necessarily linear and it's not necessarily directly literal –
 in fact, hopefully it's not really literal. That was something I was 
trying not to do. I wanted to feel emotionally in that context but not 
directly literal, though on some songs I was gonna be a little more 
literal than on others. Those songs kind of anchored the theme of the 
record, so when you get to the other ones you start to look into it and 
check the verses and realise it's a piece of the whole thing. That was 
pretty much how it developed, very instinctively. It wasn't over 
thought-out."<br>
<br>
In other words, it was the polar opposite of the songs on The Ghost Of 
Tom Joad, which were long, evolving narratives painstakingly assembled 
from fine detail and closely-observed characterisation. The only one of 
the new songs vaguely in that vein is 'Nothing Man', apparently a 
vignette of a small-town character who becomes a local hero after some 
unspecified act of heroism.<br>
<br>
"Right, and that I wrote in 1994," Springsteen nods. "This album is the 
opposite end of the lyrical spectrum. There's detail, but it was a 
different type of writing than I've done in a while. It was just sort of
 pop song writing or rock song writing, y'know? I was trying to find a 
way to tell the story in that context. One of the things I learnt on 
some of my earlier records where I tried to record the band...for 
instance, on Nebraska, immediately the band played those songs they 
overruled the lyrics. It didn't work. Those two forms didn't fit. The 
band comes in and generally makes noise, and the lyrics wanted silence, 
y'know? They make arrangement, and the lyrics wanted less arrangement. 
The lyrics wanted to be at the centre and there was a minimal amount of 
music. The music was very necessary but it wanted to be minimal, and so 
with The Rising I was trying to make an exciting record with the E 
Street Band which I hadn't done in a long time, so that form was kind of
 driving me."<br>
<br>
With O'Brien a reassuring presence in the control booth, Springsteen 
felt able to focus on writing and performing. "Brendan had a particular,
 distinct aesthetic point of view where he said, 'Yeah, I think this is 
working on this, but this makes it sound like that,' y'know? So this was
 a situation where I trusted his viewpoint very intensely, and I had a 
lot of faith in where he thought the thing was going to go soundwise.<br>
<br>
"The guitars were brought way up front, the keyboards were put in a 
different spot, things sounded a little different. We used a variety of 
different tape loops, and we had a lot of different found sounds going 
on – everything to sort of not go to the normal thing that we'd done in 
the past. The essential thing was to get the band to feel sonically 
fresh. He knew exactly what to do there, so I got to kind of sit back 
and do the singing and the playing and the songwriting."<br>
<br>
Although on occasions Springsteen has seen his music being claimed by 
politicians from either end of the spectrum – Ronald Reagan and his 
Democratic rival Walter Mondale both tried to steal some of his Born In 
The USA thunder in 1984 – his focus has remained resolutely on the 
personal and the particular. On that occasion Springsteen was careful to
 distance himself and his work from both candidates. Eighteen years 
later, he feels no more inclined to take political sides, and earlier 
this year he rebuffed efforts by an activist group called Independence 
For New Jersey to put his name forward as a candidate for the US Senate.
 He quoted General William Tecumseh Sherman, who refused to seek the 
presidency in 1884. "If nominated, I will not run," declared The Boss, 
tongue presumably in cheek. "If elected, I will not serve."<br>
<br>
Hence, his new songs deal with individual emotions and spiritual 
concerns rather than American foreign policy or the disastrous 
incompetence of the FBI. Besides, he's well aware that nothing will go 
out of date more quickly than an album picking over the debris of 
yesterday's news. However, he has made an explicit gesture of looking 
beyond the US with 'Worlds Apart', a song with a pungent Eastern flavour
 thanks to a guest appearance by the Pakistani qawwali musician Asif Ali
 Khan and his band. Under Chuck Plotkin's supervision, they recorded 
their contribution in a Los Angeles studio hooked up to the sessions in 
Georgia via an ISDN link.<br>
<br>
"I came up with 'Worlds Apart' and I started to fool with some 
mid-Eastern scales in some of the background parts," Springsteen 
explains. "Asif Ali Khan happened to have a record coming on Def Jam, 
and they happened to be in LA. Via the ISDN line we were able to have a 
session across country, and they sang and played beautifully. It was 
very exciting to hear that sound in the middle of a rock song. I was 
trying to look outside the United States and move the boundaries of the 
record in some fashion. I think the song started when I saw a picture of
 the women in Afghanistan with the veils off a few days after they'd 
routed the Taliban out of Kabul, and their faces were so beautiful."<br>
<br>
Doesn't he fear that hawkish commentators might accuse him of giving comfort to the enemy?<br>
"Anybody can say anything," he says with a what-the-hell gesture. "I 
don't know, nothing surprises me at this point. People interpret things 
all different kinds of ways – it was just great Pakistani musicians and 
they sang beautifully. Who knows? Like you say, people come at things 
six ways from Sunday, but I think if someone listens to it, it just 
worked really well musically and they were great people and great 
musicians."<br>
<br>
The album opens with the stormy rumble of 'Lonesome Day', which 
Springsteen conceived as a curtain-raiser and scene-setter for what 
follows. Right away, you can hear what he means about O'Brien's effect 
on the band's sound. Where there could sometimes be an end-of-the-pier 
quality about the E Streeters in the old days, this time the guitars 
bite like chainsaws chewing through a stack of pine logs, while the bass
 and drum bottom end is built like St Paul's Cathedral. And no sign of 
that in-house favourite, the glockenspiel?<br>
<br>
"Actually, there is a glockenspiel on the album," says Springsteen, 
triumphantly. "Brendan played it on 'Into The Fire' and 'Waitin' On A 
Sunny Day'. He was going, 'I'm doing a Springsteen record! Damn right 
I'm gonna play the glockenspiel'."<br>
<br>
For 'Lonesome Day', however, the trusty glock was deemed surplus to 
requirements. "If you look at the first verse, it feels like it's a guy 
who's talking to his girl," the author points out. He sings the words 
quietly, fast-forwarding through them in his mind – "'Baby once I 
thought I knew everything I needed to know about you...it's gonna be 
okay if I can just get through this lonesome day.' Then bang, the second
 verse – 'Hell's brewin' dark sun's on the rise, this storm'll blow 
through by and by,' so I switched right out of this personal thing to 
this sort of overall emotional mood and the feelings that were in the 
air here in the States around that time. But it works, because one thing
 works with the other and the second verse can actually come in on what 
was said in the first verse. The secret of the songwriting was to get 
personal first, then you sort of shade in universal feelings. That's 
what balances the songs. All experience is personal so you have to start
 there, and then if you can connect in what's happening with everyone, 
the universality of an experience, then you're creating that alchemy 
where your audience is listening to it, they're hearing what they're 
feeling inside and they're also feeling 'I'm not alone', you know? And 
that's what you're trying to do."<br>
<br>
Despite the turbulent context in which most of the songs were written, 
it's only intermittently that Springsteen allows specific references to 
come looming out of the fog of battle. 'You're Missing' is a forlorn 
itemisation of loss, measured out in mundane household details ("Coffee 
cups on the counter, jackets on the chair/Papers on the doorstep, but 
you're not there"), while 'Into The Fire' sounds as though Springsteen 
might have had the New York Fire Department in mind when he wrote it ("I
 need your kiss, but love and duty called you some place 
higher/Somewhere up the stairs, into the fire"). 'Further On (Up The 
Road)' and 'The Fuse' are both steeped in dread and a sense of gathering
 threat, though there's no attempt to locate them in a particular time 
or place. "Got my dead man's suit, and my smilin' skull ring/My lucky 
graveyard boots, and a song to sing," runs the second verse of 'Further 
On', evoking an image of The Boss as a kind of spectral balladeer 
stalking the margins of consciousness. In 'The Fuse', as an ominous 
drumbeat tolls out the time, the singer restlessly shuffles images of 
death, religion and sex.<br>
<br>
Binding many of the songs together, over and above any details of their 
subject matter, is a powerful sense of religious faith, with religious 
imagery cropping up in any number of them. 'Paradise' deals with a 
life-after-death experience, and Allah even gets a name-check in 'Worlds
 Apart'. 'The Rising' itself, probably the most unabashed 
lump-in-the-throat rock anthem he's written since 'Born In The USA', 
amounts to Springsteen's own Easter hymn with its repetition of the 
phrase "a dream of life" and its closing invocation – "Come on up for 
the rising/Come on up, lay your hands in mine...Come on up for the 
rising tonight." I found an Italian translation of the lyrics on the 
Internet, and the Italians call it 'La Resurrezione'. Then there's 'My 
City Of Ruins', not so much a song as a prayer – "I pray for your love, 
Lord, with these hands..."<br>
<br>
"I've had 'My City Of Ruins' for a couple of years almost," Springsteen 
explains. "I was going to play it in Asbury Park for a Christmas show. 
Asbury, of course, has been struggling for a very long time, and the 
town's now on the verge of being redeveloped, so there was a moment when
 there was a lot of hope and excitement about it. It's a beautiful city,
 its basic design is really quite lovely, so there was excitement about 
it. I was playing in Convention Hall in Asbury or doing something for 
some different organisations in the town, so that was when I wrote it. 
Then when I played it on the 9/11 telethon people made a connection with
 that event, but it was written quite a bit before. It felt appropriate 
to sing it that night, but it was written quite a bit previously.<br>
<br>
"It's a gospel song. It's like a lot of my things, like 'The Promised 
Land', or I had a song on the live album called 'Land Of Hope And 
Dreams'...they're all fundamentally gospel-rooted, or blues-and 
gospel-rooted. It seemed like that element was going to be a significant
 element of the record in some fashion. I didn't sit down and set out to
 write this or that but just as it unfolded, as I say, the story you're 
telling asks for certain things, and it asks for help in discerning 
meaning from chaotic or cataclysmic events. I think people are asking 
themselves, 'Where do I fit into this? What happened? Where did my 
husband go? Where did my wife go? What's that about? What can I do about
 it? What do I do now? Where are they?' I think all those questions, if 
you go through any sort of real shattering loss, become a constant part 
of your life.<br>
<br>
"I'm sure, for the rest of your life, those are questions that you're 
answering every day, and that never completely goes away. So the 
songwriters and the storytellers in general are people who attempt to 
assist people in contextualising some of that experience. And not 
explaining, really, because I don't know of an explanation, but sorting 
through things emotionally and locating ties that people have that 
continue to bind even in the face of the events of that day. I think I 
went in search of those things on many of the songs."<br>
<br>
I wondered what it had been like in the Springsteen household on that 
Tuesday, as the news unfolded. "I'm sure it was the same every place, 
everybody tells the same story to some degree. Sitting around the 
television. We're about five minutes from a bridge that you cross over 
where these two rivers meet, and there's a bridge where the Twin Towers 
stand right in the centre of it, and it's only 10 or 15 miles by water 
from here so it's quite close. The whole horizon line goes red and hazy 
if the wind's blowing in this direction and the towers are always there,
 and on that particular day they were gone, y'know? I think what was 
unusual about living here at the time was...I think it was 150 people 
from Monmouth county [where he lives] or a little more who died. People 
knew people. In the surrounding communities there were quite a few 
people affected. You knew this woman and her husband, someone else's 
son, someone else's brother.<br>
<br>
"In the following weeks if you were driving towards the beach or 
something, if you drove by the Catholic church there was a funeral every
 day. Then people got together and there were some shows done and 
benefits and candlelight vigils and a wide variety of ways that people 
were trying to sort through what happened. I don't know what it was like
 in the middle of the country or on the West Coast, but here it was very
 real."<br>
<br>
If ever there was a rock star who embodied the values of community, 
dependability and a continuing dialogue with his audience, it's 
Springsteen, so he and the band were happy to get stuck into some 
morale-boosting projects.<br>
<br>
"Yeah, we did shows in Asbury and in Redbank near here, and a couple of 
places in the area. Garry Tallent [E Street bassist] put on a two-night 
show, it was fun – I played, Joan Jett, DJ Fontana came up with Sonny 
Burgess from Memphis and it was just a wide variety of people who came 
up and played and chipped in. It was a very interesting show. Then the 
last couple of years we've done Christmas concerts in Asbury where I 
front Max Weinberg's band [E Street drummer] and a lot of the E Street 
guys show up, and we get the horn section from Southside Johnny and some
 singers and we have a big 30-piece band onstage and we throw a big 
Christmas party basically. This year that was a part of it. Garland 
Jeffreys played, Elvis Costello came and sang a song, Bruce Hornsby – it
 was a lot of fun. I met many of the survivors and the wives, they'd 
come out and wanted to dance and have fun. They'd say, 'Thanks, we had a
 great time'."<br>
<br>
This instinct to band together and try to find something to be hopeful 
about was another dimension Springsteen wanted to build into the new 
album. Despite the sombre nature of much of the subject matter, he has 
managed to smuggle in a couple of tracks that are as poppy and 
commercial as anything he's ever written. 'Waitin' On A Sunny Day' is an
 easy-going stroll back to the classic pop Springsteen soaked up in his 
youth, with "a little Phil Spector and a little Rockpile" in the mix. 
'Let's Be Friends' he describes as "a combination of Sly Stone and 
Virginia beach music. Yeah, that's a nice groove, it's like a kids' 
singalong. What really makes it work is the Alliance Choir who are 
singing on it along with Patti [Scialfa, aka Mrs Springsteen] and Soozie
 Tyrell. When the chorus hits, it's just a very classic sound."<br>
<br>
Talking about music, he stresses, isn't the same as hearing it. "I think
 listening to me sort of propound my ideas of what went into the songs 
is not the same, may I mention, as the listening experience!" he argues,
 amid laughter. "The band is playing hard, loud and with intensity, and 
the music itself is very bright for the most part. For the first time I 
made a record with the E Street Band in 18 years I wanted a record that 
was gonna be fun for people to listen to, and exciting, that people used
 the way people use rock records, which is either to clean your house to
 or to change your life if you want to, y'know? That was an essential 
element. Without that, the lyrics as they stand would not work. They 
work because they're embedded in music that is very life-affirming. That
 balance has been something I think I've struck in all my best songs, 
like my verses are always the blues and my choruses are gospel. You go 
to 'The Promised Land' or 'Badlands', they're based on the idea that 
your feet are grounded in the everyday, in the real world, but your 
spirit is reaching high."<br>
<br>
The idea was the album wouldn't duck "all the hard questions", but it 
needed to stir listeners physically, too. "That's something the band and
 I do well and that had to be a part of it," he reasons. "The record 
needed to be filled with a certain sort of hopeful energy but the hope 
had to be earned, y'know? It couldn't just be platitudes or 
'Everything's gonna be all right' or 'Things are gonna be better'. So if
 you look at a song like 'Mary's Place' – 'We're gonna have a party'. 
Then you go back to the verses and see all the other stuff is in the 
verses, somebody trying to sort through what happened, and 'What's my 
place and where do I go tonight and how do I deal with this minute by 
minute and day by day?'"<br>
<br>
'Mary's Place' is where the bar-band spirit of the E Street squad 
emerges most vividly on the album, but it acknowledges that decades have
 passed since the rowdier, less self-examining days of 'Where The Bands 
Are' or 'Out In The Street'. It sounds like a celebration, but it isn't 
very far away from being a wake either.<br>
<br>
"I think that's what you saw at the time, people were making that effort
 to celebrate and it was helpful," says Springsteen. "The idea of the 
song was to capture that thing. I wanted it to really feel like home. 
It's a throwback to 'Rosalita' almost, and I wanted the band to feel the
 way people remembered that it felt at a certain time and I was singing a
 certain way. It comes up about three-quarters of the way through the 
record, right after 'The Fuse', which is really sonically different for 
us, and all of a sudden people would feel like, hey, that's your own 
pals putting their arms around you and you've got a place to go and 
somebody to talk to and be with. That's kind of what our band has been 
for people and what we've wanted to be for people over the years. The 
song comes up at a particular place on the record, it's that 
open-arms-of-home feeling."<br>
<br>
Forensically-minded listeners may find it interesting to consider the 
piece as another of Springsteen's "Mary" songs. Since 'Mary Queen Of 
Arkansas' on his debut album, Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J., Marys – 
or is it just Mary? – have cropped up consistently down the years. In 
'Thunder Road', it's Mary who "dances across the porch as the radio 
plays", while the narrator "got Mary pregnant" in 'The River'. She's 
back again in 'Straight Time' from The Ghost Of Tom Joad – "Mary's 
smiling but she's watching me out of the corner of her eye". Time for a 
doctoral thesis on "The Name Mary In The Works Of Bruce Springsteen", 
perhaps?<br>
<br>
So who is she this time, Bruce? Mary from 'Thunder Road'? The Virgin Mary?<br>
"Yeah, I've used that name a lot of times," he grins. "I'm sure it's the
 Catholic coming out in me, y'know? That was always the most beautiful 
name. I used it in 'Thunder Road', I used it on Tom Joad, and what 
happens is if you kind of set up a continuing...it's not necessarily the
 same person, and there's a little continuum that occurs for the people 
who are watching or listening. The name drifts through your body of work
 and leaves a trail of its own about where you've been and where you're 
going. It comes up in 'Mary's Place' and, really, you're right, it's 
like, 'Well, where's the party actually being held?' It could be here or
 there, and who is actually saying meet me at Mary's place? That was 
part of it, too. Whose voice is that?<br>
<br>
"It comes up again at the end of 'The Rising', 'I see you Mary in the 
garden of a thousand sighs'. Once again, that's like someone's wife, or 
it could be a religious vision. I think that the songs call for a 
blurring of those ideas. They had to meld in a certain way, the 
religious with the everyday, because that's one of the only emotional 
responses to that experience, I think. So it floats through the record 
in a lot of ways."<br>
<br>
These are daunting issues to address on a rock album, and Springsteen 
set himself his sternest examination on the title track. Above the 
roaring blowtorch blast of the new O'Brien-ised E Street Band sound, the
 lyrics are part mantra, part prayer, part mystical contemplation and 
part horrified onlooker.<br>
<br>
"I think it's a natural image of sacrifice," he reflects. "Once again 
moving towards religious imagery to explain some of the day's 
experiences. It's unavoidable to some degree because of the nature and 
the type of sacrifice that occurred. I got down towards the end of the 
record and I think I was searching for the voice of someone who died, 
and I wanted to have a voice that addresses the living. So I just sort 
of imagined the main character basically...I dunno, speaking to his 
wife. Who would you want to speak to? Your wife, and you'd think of your
 children. And then just those left at large, I think. The different 
verses move slowly towards that kind of crossing-over point. 'The 
Rising' – that was it, that was the moment when the souls rise."<br>
<br>
His voice has been growing steadily quieter as he takes the measure of 
his subject. The weight of it is starting to bear down on the entire 
room, even on this pristine summer afternoon. He pauses to drink some 
water. Sometimes he'll rephrase his sentences two or three times, as he 
searches for the exact nuance of meaning.<br>
<br>
"In the beginning, the first verse is kind of disorientation and 'Where 
am I?' It starts, 'Can't see nothing in front of me, can't see nothing 
coming up behind...All I can feel is the chain that binds me' – the 
links with whatever you might wanna call it – duty, love, comradeship, 
the fear – that keep people going. The song moves on. The second verse 
is just where the person came from, 'Left the house this 
morning...wearin' the cross of my calling.' Well, that's just 'this is 
your job', y'know? It's the same one you've worn every day and today 
these are its responsibilities and this is what it's asking. The bridge 
of the song is a moment when I think the singer realises that his 
mortality is at hand, and then in the last verse I imagine him speaking 
to his wife or a religious vision of some sort, 'See Mary in the 
garden...' It seemed to me that's one of the things you'd be thinking 
about, and the desire for a return to a physical intimacy – 'Feel your 
arms around me' – the physical self. The fear of losing that physical 
self, 'May I feel your blood mix with mine', the desire to sustain the 
physical intimacy.<br>
<br>
"Then, 'A dream of life comes to me like a catfish dancin' on the end of
 my line', That was a funny line – the catfish line popped out of my 
head, 'cos I fish out here once in a while and there's that moment when 
bing!, y'know, you're suspended between life and death, incredible life 
and a moment of death, and really I think the rest of the song turns 
into this mantra, 'Sky of blackness and sorrow, sky of love'. It's sort 
of the yin-yang of just what is. 'Sky of mercy, sky of fear, sky of 
memory, sky of emptiness, sky of fullness.' I think it's the awareness 
of what is about to be lost, 'A dream of life, dream of life, dream of 
life' – repeat that over and over again. Just the magnitude of what 
you're leaving behind, what you're giving up, and a last chance to speak
 to people that matter to you. So that came up towards the end of the 
record. It was kind of a curtain on the whole thing. I think a lot of 
the other songs were moving towards that direction."<br>
<br>
The bearded, frizzy-haired Springsteen who would hang around Madam Marie
 the fortune-teller's on the Asbury Park boardwalk probably never dreamt
 he'd end up writing his own version of the St Matthew Passion, but the 
roots of his new songs can be clearly discerned in his past songwriting.
 His willingness to engage with the spiritual and the metaphysical will 
probably be what strikes listeners most forcefully about The Rising, but
 it isn't a development which has sprung unexpectedly out of nowhere.<br>
<br>
Ten years ago, the Lucky Town album concluded with 'Souls Of The 
Departed' and 'My Beautiful Reward', two songs distinctly preoccupied 
with the afterlife. "Well this is a prayer for the souls of the 
departed/Those who've gone and left their babies brokenhearted", he sang
 in the former. The nuns who taught the young Bruce Frederick 
Springsteen at the St Rose Of Lima School in Freehold might consider 
they did a pretty good job of instilling Holy dread and the mysteries of
 Catholic ritual into the boy.<br>
<br>
You can also trace a clear line between 'My Beautiful Reward' and the 
new song, 'Paradise'. "Yeah, they share some of the same issues. That 
transition point between life and death. When I wrote 'Paradise', I was 
looking for something kind of really quiet, and I think it was the week 
there'd been the teenage girl suicide bombers. It was devastating, and 
so the first verse came out of thinking about that, the loss of life and
 the false paradise. Then I'd met a woman who had lost her husband at 
the Pentagon, and she came to Asbury one night, and they were just 
long-time fans I guess. I think I was thinking of that woman when I 
wrote the song, which is why it switches from Virginia, because I wanted
 something that was outside the United States, the larger feeling of the
 effect of what's going on in the world outside the States. Again I 
thought, 'What do you miss?' You miss the physicalness and the ability 
to touch somebody.<br>
<br>
"I've had people close to me who died. I remember when I was young, that
 aching to touch the person again was very, very strong and it was very 
painful to realise that it just couldn't happen. And the last verse is a
 survivor's verse, where I think your desire to join the people you've 
lost is very strong. You have the situation where the person goes to 
that river, it's the river of transition between life and death and they
 wade into it and they take themselves underneath.<br>
<br>
"Somewhere in that nether world they see the person and it kinda comes 
up with that last line – they're searching for the peacefulness that 
people feel comes with death and passing on, or with an imagined version
 of paradise that you'll attain, and they get close enough and they just
 see emptiness. There's a lot of different ways people could interpret 
it. I always felt it was, 'Hey, life is here. It's all you have and it's
 here and now'.<br>
<br>
"In the last couple of lines the person swims to the surface and feels the sun. That was my last song of the record."<br>
<br>
One of the trademarks of Springsteen's career has been the way it has 
advanced by careful, logical steps. If he's been through chaotic or 
depressive episodes in his life, he has made sure he did so away from 
microphones and beyond the reach of the paparazzi. His shrewdest 
creative device has been to use his own life as the raw material of his 
work, so as he gradually changes over the years, so do his songs. He has
 been evolutionary rather than revolutionary, and if he sometimes seems 
to have been hamstrung by excessive caution, his approach has ensured 
that he has avoided making a prancing buffoon of himself in the manner 
of a Rod Stewart, a Mick Jagger or even a George Michael.<br>
<br>
Hence, despite the immediate circumstances of their composition, 
Springsteen is well aware that the new songs are "outgrowths of stories 
that I've written all along", as he puts it. "I've written about the 
everyday for a long time, and a certain sort of...for lack of a better 
word, heroism or nobility that I've felt that I witnessed in my life as a
 child among people in my neighbourhood and in my house. That was 
something that I felt wasn't being sung about at the time when I started
 to sing about it, and also it was just what mattered to me. It felt 
real, and those were the things I was moved to sing about. We're living 
at a time in the United States of certain events, y'know, and as a 
writer you respond to the events of the day.<br>
<br>
"What happened last September was a very natural thing to write about, 
and there were a lot of obviously inspirational things happening at the 
time. You're trying to contextualise the event for yourself, I think 
that's where it starts. It starts with you trying to do it for yourself,
 and then in the process, because I learnt the language of songwriting 
and music, I try to communicate and hopefully do it for other people. 
I'm just doing something that's useful for me, and then hopefully in 
some fashion it's gonna be useful and will provide some service to my 
audience."<br>
<br>
It seems incongruous that Springsteen's huge career should have grown 
from such unassuming, almost humdrum, acorns. The way he puts it, he 
almost makes it sound as if he's a musical plumber who comes round, with
 a pen behind his ear and a clipboard, to make sure you're getting your 
regular supply with no leaks or air blockages. But it's been his 
achievement to take the routines and small details of regular 
non-rock-star lives and sieve through them until he can separate out a 
hint of the epic.<br>
<br>
Punk bands always used to drone on about removing the barriers between 
band and audience, but somehow Springsteen was able to persuade his 
audience, even after they'd been herded into a football stadium with 
people chucking firecrackers and mooing "Brooooooce!", that the bond 
they thought they felt to him and his music was real. Even after 
becoming the biggest white rock star on earth, he found ways to keep the
 relationship alive, whether it was through high-profile benevolent 
gestures or Amnesty International tours, or, perhaps more tellingly, by 
showing up unannounced at small clubs and thrashing out a few old 
rock'n'roll chestnuts, just because he wanted to.<br>
<br>
A natural conservative (by character, rather than politically) in a 
medium which was, at one time at least, associated with anarchy and 
insurrection, Springsteen was always in it for the long run. Not the 
burn-out-and-fade-away type of guy at all.<br>
<br>
"No, no!" he insists. "I wanted to live to be old, old as hell, y'know? 
I'm glad The Who can get onstage and still sing 'My Generation' now. I 
like seeing Marlon Brando alive and kicking. I understood the cult of 
death was always a very, very integral part of rock'n'roll myth, and 
possibly because there was the whole idea of the edge and the idea that 
music felt like life and death. It did feel like life and death, it 
still does feel like life and death to me, y'know, but it was something 
that for me and our band I interpreted differently. I didn't discount it
 and it's a part of a lot of my music, but I interpreted it differently 
and I think in an integrated fashion as a part of the work that I was 
doing, and fundamentally our story has always been, 'Hey, look, all we 
have is this, let's see what we can do with it.'"<br>
<br>
He attributes his work ethic and his penchant for self-denial to his 
mother, Adele. A staunch Catholic from a Neapolitan family, the 
Zerillis, Mrs Springsteen was a hard-working secretary who shouldered 
the burden of keeping the household running when her husband was 
enduring his frequent periods of unemployment. When Springsteen talks 
about her, his face is lit by an expression of child-like amazement.<br>
<br>
"I took after my mom in a certain sense. Her life had an incredible 
consistency, work work work every day, and I admired that greatly, I 
admired her ability to present herself. She would get up in the morning 
and the bathroom was near my bed, and I could hear the sound of her in 
the bathroom. The faucet would come on, the make-up kit come out, things
 clicking on the sink, and I just sat and listened to my mother in the 
act of getting ready to present herself to the world. And then her high 
heels, and the sound they made when they left the house. I had a little 
balcony I used to sleep out on sometimes, and I'd hear her heels going 
up the street towards the office.<br>
<br>
"The office was about two blocks into the centre of town and that was 
the sound of my mom walking to work, y'know, walking to work. I'd visit 
her at her job sometimes, and it was filled with men and women who 
seemed to have a purpose. They were presenting themselves in a certain 
fashion, and I found a lot of inspiration in those simple acts. It was 
part of what you gave to the town you lived in and your society and your
 family, and it was not necessarily easy to do. My mother had little 
babies. We needed breakfast, we needed dinner at the end of her 
eight-hour working day. We needed somebody to do our homework with us 
and the day was endless, y'know, and it was just simply performed daily,
 day in day out, without complaint. As I grew older I began to look at 
this as a noble thing, and I realised that there were many of these 
things going on constantly in my little town."<br>
<br>
You'd have to guess that this idealistic, stained-glass vision of Adele 
Springsteen provided at least one template for her son's various 
Mary-figures. It might surprise his mother to learn that she was also a 
role model for the E Street Band. "The work part of what we did was 
intensely modelled on what she did, and the way she conducted herself on
 a daily basis," Springsteen insists. "It was like, 'Hey! We can't be 
terrible one night and good the next night. We've got to be good every 
night.' When somebody buys your ticket, it's your handshake, it's the 
old story, and they only have this night. They don't care if you're 
great the next night. What about tonight, y'know? I thought those things
 were real, and we took our fun very seriously.<br>
<br>
"We went out there to throw a big party to make you laugh and dance and 
the band would act crazy onstage, but behind it was the idea also that 
you're providing an essential service of some sort. That unspoken 
promises are made between an audience and an artist, whether you say 
them or not, they're a part of the dialogue that comes with the turf. 
And it's a valuable dialogue, a valuable occupation, a valuable thing to
 do, and on top of that, hey, it's great fun and the pay is fabulous and
 we've had a lifetime of satisfying work. On our last tour, somebody 
came up to me and said, 'Hey, I saw you in '75, there was a show you did
 at this college.' I thought, why would somebody remember one night in 
1975? And I said, 'Yeah, that was the idea, I was trying to make that 
night memorable.'<br>
<br>
"That consistency, I felt, was a part of what we were about and what I 
wanted to be about. I wanted to be something you could depend upon, as 
best as I could. I was gonna have my screw-ups and make my mistakes and I
 was probably gonna do things you didn't want me to do, but 
fundamentally I was gonna be at least out there searching for that 
road." He pauses for another eruption of Brucian laughter. "And so it 
continues."<br>
<br>
But when he was, say, 25 and about to make Born To Run, did he have a 
clear idea of where he was heading and how he would develop? "Well, I'd 
had success locally and I liked that. You got the attention from the 
girls. I made a few bucks, not much but I didn't need much, and I beat 
the 9-to-5 thing which I was very interested in doing. I had no 
practical skills and I wasn't book-smart at school, so I'd managed to 
learn this craft that was keeping me afloat. That excited me, and I knew
 I wanted to be a musician.<br>
<br>
"Then, as time passed, we played to a lot of people and people 
applauded. We were pretty good. As we travelled around I said, 'Yeah, 
we're not only pretty good, we're better than a lot of these other guys 
I'm seeing,' and I'd put the radio on and I'd say, 'And I'm as good as a
 lot of these guys that are on the radio, too, so why shouldn't I be on 
the radio'? Anyway, I got to New York and I met Mike Appel [first 
manager], and it set the next series of things in motion where I was 
going to be a recording musician now. After my first album came out, I 
remember Mike called me and I said, 'How did we do?' He said, 'We didn't
 do very well, we sold about 20,000 records.' I said, '20,000 records! 
That's fabulous! I don't know 20,000 people. Who would buy a record by 
someone they have no idea about?'"<br>
<br>
Gradually, it dawned on him that whatever success he was going to 
achieve would be determined by his own efforts. He was gripped by a 
single-minded will to succeed.<br>
<br>
"I think I just wanted to be I great, y'know, I wanted to be really as 
good as I could be, and I wanted to live up to the people who had been 
my heroes. It's like when Reggie Jackson got put into the Baseball Hall 
Of Fame, he says: 'It was great to be there that day, you don't care if 
your name's called first or second or tenth, but it's nice that 
somewhere on that long day when the list gets read off, somewhere in 
there they come to yours.' I think that was kinda my feeling – 'Gee, I'd
 like to be a part of this somehow'.<br>
<br>
"When I think back on it, I thought I just wanted to play rhythm guitar,
 I didn't want to play lead guitar. You just want to be in the band and 
be part of that thing moving along, but then somewhere along the way 
that becomes intertwined with, of course, raving ambition, and you're 
trying to make the best, greatest rock record that could ever be made. 
You're trying to be the best and your ego pushes you, which is okay, 
that's how things roll. I think as long as all those things are managed 
in a fashion that allows you to survive and continue, and keeps you on a
 reasonable path, you know?"<br>
<br>
It was the arrival of Jon Landau as his manager that guaranteed that 
Springsteen's potential would be converted into copper-bottomed, 
platinum-plated results. Landau declared that he had seen "rock'n'roll's
 future", but when he saw Springsteen he knew he'd seen his own future 
too. Left to his own devices, it's very possible that Springsteen might 
have allowed his heart to rule his head. In Landau's case, the equation 
is emphatically reversed. Doing business deals with Landau is reportedly
 like sticking your head in a bucket of piranhas, but there's no doubt 
he has played a pivotal role in sustaining Springsteen's credibility and
 creativity.<br>
<br>
"The main thing about Jon was he was somebody I could trust," 
Springsteen reports. "There were a lot of things I hated doing, business
 things, which I had proven terrible at before I met Jon. I wasn't even 
terrible at it, I just couldn't have cared less. I just wanted to be 
able to do what I wanted to do. Particularly when I was younger, I was 
really alienated by that part of it and I felt that any involvement in 
it was somehow not being true to my original ideals. So when Jon came 
along that whole thing was taken care of. I had a long period of time 
when I was pretty estranged from it, probably until well into my 
thirties, and he kept the boat afloat. He was a writer himself, and he 
managed because I needed a manager.<br>
<br>
"We had a lot of discussions over the years about these issues, and 
where people went right and where people went wrong, and it was always 
based around, 'How do we do the best job this time out with the record?'
 It was so simple. He would say, 'Well, you can do this and play a hall 
this size and it can still be great.' He was constantly pushing the 
boundaries out for me a little bit, which I needed to do because I was 
fearful, I was very self-protective, and not unwisely so because you 
need to be. You need to protect your work, your music and the identity 
that you've worked hard to present."<br>
<br>
It was this belief that drove Springsteen to go to court in London in 
1998 to prevent Masquerade Music from releasing a collection of his old 
demos and outtakes – "I'm not losing sleep at night over it, but I'm 
protective of it where I can be," as he puts it – and it also informs 
his attitude to seeing his work traded for free across the Internet.<br>
<br>
"My take on that as a musician is I know what it takes to write a song, 
and it's hard and you don't write that many and you pour your blood and 
sweat into it. I do think it's theft, y'know, I do feel like that about 
it. Where it's going I don't know. The music business is in a big state 
of transition at the moment. I don't know anyone who does know where 
it's going to go. Wherever it goes, I'll be working somewhere."<br>
<br>
Perhaps some of his inclination to look back and take stock has been 
prompted by the death of his father, Doug, in 1998. In between stints as
 a factory worker, prison guard and bus driver, Springsteen Snr 
frequently found himself out of work. Bitterness and disillusion caused 
him to clash frequently with the bohemian-inclined Bruce during his 
adolescence, and Doug's Irish-Dutch background was probably the worst 
possible combination when it came to defusing overheated emotions. Their
 fractious relationship was charted in several songs, notably 
'Independence Day', 'My Father's House' and 'Adam Raised A Cain'. There 
was a period during which Springsteen would often talk about his father 
during his lengthy onstage raps.<br>
<br>
Passing time had improved father-son relations considerably, to the 
point where they were rubbing along pretty well by the end. "I probably 
went through a few changes when he died," Springsteen ponders. "It's a 
big moment, I think. It's like 'OK, you're the daddy now'. When your 
father's gone, I think your own adultness and your sense of 
responsibility and the role you play in your family at large increases. 
But he had a pretty peaceful passing and we knew it was coming for a 
good while, so I had time to go and spend some time and just sit. Big 
thing, of course, for my mother. They were married for 50-some years. It
 changes the way you see yourself."<br>
<br>
Does he see Doug in himself now? "Oh yeah, all the time," he says 
slowly. "All the time. It's funny, as I've gotten older, I've started to
 look more like him. I used to look more like my mom, but if I...I'm a 
little down in weight now, but if I go up another 10 or 15 pounds he'll 
be looking right back at me in the mirror. I go 'There you are!', 
y'know? Your features change. When I was young I looked Irish, when I 
was a little kid I had the little Irish features, as my children have 
had, up until around 12 or 13 and then zoom! Your face lengthens out and
 you see the Italian features. I had that for most of my life, it's 
kinda how I got used to looking at myself. Then as you get a little 
older, for some reason I see a little bit of the Irish creeping back in.
 Your face gets a little rounder, your forehead gets a little higher and
 occasionally I'll look in the mirror and he'll just be looking back at 
me."<br>
<br>
Generations keep changing inexorably, and Springsteen can feel gravity's
 pull. "Of course, there's the behaviour you inherit from your parents. 
Over the years I've done a lot to sort through a lot of that. Obviously 
all your initial responses to things, you respond the way they 
responded, y'know? Some of those are okay, and some you want to leave 
behind. My attitude was the way we honour our parents is we hold on to 
the good things that they taught us and we lose the things that were 
their mistakes. That's the way we honour them after they're gone, and 
when we become parents ourselves. That's your life job. That's what 
people are supposed to be out there doing in some fashion."<br>
<br>
Apart from making albums and touring, of course. "I'm coming up on being
 a 53-year-old guy, and the music business tends to be a little hostile 
at this time," he says, with a chuckle. "That's OK, because my take is I
 believe this is one of my very best records. I feel down in my soul 
that it's as good as any record I've made with the band. I feel like I 
did my job, and I don't know the way that radio responds, and I'm not 
comfortable with a lot of the ways that music is disseminated at the 
moment. I've got a working band, we're gonna go out and we're gonna work
 very hard playing, and we're gonna play this record every night. I'll 
do my best to help it find a home and a place in the world, and then let
 the chips fall where they may. So!"</div>

<br>
Sylvie Simmons, MOJO, September 2002<br>
<br>
"BLOOD", "FIRE", "dust", "dark", "empty" – the same words keep 
recurring. Lights shutting out, black hole in the sun, buildings 
burning, that lonely desperation that can drive an atheist to prayer.<br>
<br>
This is not the first time Springsteen has written about darkness in the
 USA; though his songs have always reflected America's glorious myths, 
he's equally mindful of its grim realities. And reality doesn't come 
much grimmer than planes ramming skyscrapers, incinerated firefighters, 
people leaving answering-machine messages then leaping to their deaths.<br>
<br>
In the aftermath of September 11, numerous novelists and poets published
 their writings on the horror, but musicians, largely, stayed silent. 
Some spoke out, or played fundraisers, but few wrote songs about it. Or 
if they did, most didn't release them.<br>
<br>
Can't say I blame them – there's a fine line between empathy and 
exploitation, no end of pitfalls in the matter of language, tone and 
timing. But Springsteen – champion of the common man; nearest damn thing
 to an East Coast poet laureate – had to do something.<br>
<br>
As is his way, he says his piece through adopted characters and their 
stories: the bitter man in opener 'Lonesome Day' who thought he knew 
everything about his wife, but now "the joke's on me"; the desperate 
optimist in 'Mary's Place' who throws a party for his gal, playing all 
her favourite records, hoping she'll show up ("I drop the needle and 
pray"); the emergency worker the papers call a hero, broken, propping up
 a bar in 'Nothing Man'; the widower in dark, menacing rocker 'The 
Fuse', where anger fuses with sexual need and terror. Hmm, terror – a 
hazardous area for any American with sympathy for the underdog/ability 
to see all sides of an argument to venture post-9/11. But Springsteen 
goes there, singing about bridge-building in 'Let's Be Friends' and 
'Worlds Apart', an odd, Middle-Eastern song, like Peter Gabriel backed 
by The E Street Band.<br>
<br>
Yes, the band the Boss let go in 1990 are with him here; wife Patti 
Scialfa too. Maybe the musical equivalent of the post-disaster desire to
 be with friends and family; maybe the realisation that a stark, solo 
Nebraska-style treatment might have been too desolate. The E Streeters 
sound much as ever – lots of rousing build-ups, soaring sax, big 
backbeats, bombast. There are more retro-sounding pop-R&amp;B numbers 
with "sha la la" backing vocals than the subject matter might indicate, a
 stadium-rocker, some soulful ballads recalling early Van Morrison, and 
stirring gospel. Closer 'My City Of Ruins', urging us to "rise up", is 
particularly rousing. In the end The Rising's message – as the other 
frequently-recurring words "hope", "strength", "faith" and "love" 
indicate – is one of indomitability.</div>

<br>
Rod Tootell, Rock's Backpages, July 2008<br>
<br>
Rod Tootell asks how well-served the Boss has been by his official live recordings – and nominates his Top 20 tracks.<br>
<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN ON TOUR (Bloomsbury) is the third book Dave Marsh has 
written about Bruce Springsteen, and its tone varies little from its 
predecessors.<br>
<br>
As usual Marsh is at pains to point out how Springsteen has delighted 
fans all around the world delivering shows – sometimes up to four hours 
long – that seldom if ever disappoint. Springsteen, we learn again, is a
 performer with a conscience, making sure he gives value for money, 
trading in humour, romance, energy, and political commitment. At the 
same time, Marsh wants us to get The Message that Springsteen is 
spreading. When one cuts to the chase, the message seems to boil down to
 this: that given a certain amount of belief in ourselves, we can all 
live up to our true potential and not be dragged down by the pressures 
that life that slowly tangle around us as we start to leave behind those
 carefree days of youth. At least I think that's what it is.<br>
<br>
It's here that the befuddled fan may start to feel a little 
short-changed. Bruce Springsteen on Tour is meant to describe 
Springsteen's life on tour and yet the insights normally reserved for a 
book of this nature are mostly missing. So who always gets to sit at the
 back of the tour bus? What do they play at the sound checks? Does 
Springsteen really go home after delivering an explosion of rock and 
roll and start writing songs for his new Nebraska album?<br>
<br>
Strangely there are no interviews with the members of the E Street Band.
 There is one occasion where we learn that Roy Bittan and Nils Lofgren 
find themselves heavily involved in a game of table tennis, only to hear
 the opening chords of 'Born in the U.S.A.' thundering above their 
heads. Marsh appears to treat this as a worrying episode, as if some of 
the class have misbehaved, which may upset Teacher. In fact, Marsh comes
 across very much as Teacher's Pet, still intent on converting the rest 
of the class to how great Teacher is. Even after 23 years he feels he 
must once again recount the moment on Springsteen's birthday when a fan 
gave him a cake on stage. Springsteen duly kicked it back into the crowd
 shouting "Send me the cleaning bill!" Marsh is still deeply shocked by 
this but needs to get it out of the way so as to show his impartiality. 
Most of us would I think be pleased to know that the Boss is human. So 
he gets a little grumpy once in a while. Thank God for that.<br>
<br>
A less reverential book about Springsteen would surely be welcome. There
 is no doubt that he is a phenomenal writer, able to switch from pure 
pop to complex vignettes of American life. These various sides to his 
craft are showcased in his live performances, but many cannot see him as
 anything more than the stadium singer of the '80s. Whether this book 
does anything to change this attitude is debatable.<br>
<br>
There's another way in which fans are short-changed by Bruce Springsteen
 on Tour. Marsh's book suggests that you had to be there. Well, some of 
us were there, but many have only become fans within the last ten or 
fifteen years and the live material that CBS/Sony has made available 
over the years has been oddly wrong-footed. It's hard to know whether 
this is due to the lack of thought on behalf of Springsteen and manager 
John Landau or possibly too much of it. In the light of the simultaneous
 release of Human Touch and Lucky Town, there seems to be a strange 
combination of inertia and spontaneity when it comes to releasing 
Springsteen's albums.<br>
<br>
In 1975 we awaited a great live album to show that all the media hype 
about his live performances was true. It never came, one assumes because
 the lawsuit between Springsteen and his ex-manager excluded any 
releases. A steady stream of bootlegs kept us going, but these were of 
varying quality. No one was complaining though. The Darkness on the Edge
 of Town tour was well-bootlegged, the only CBS live material showing up
 on the No Nukes album. When Live 1975-85 appeared it simply wasn't good
 enough. This was no live concert but more a catalogue of live material,
 not a representation of what a live Springsteen gig was all about. At 
the same time, it was heavily weighted towards material from the 1984/85
 tour. There were odd choices. 'Darlington County' and 'Seeds' but no 
'Jungleland'. Highlights included 'Racing in the Street', 'Independence 
Day' and three songs from Nebraska.<br>
<br>
The next offering was In Concert/MTV Plugged, again not a real show and 
not even with the E St Band. Versions of 'Wish I Were Blind' and 'If I 
Should Fall Behind' are great but it ain't the real deal. Then we have 
Live in New York City, which seemed to be patched together from two 
concerts. Added to this are six bonus tracks (this on its first official
 release). Quite where they came from is anybody's guess. Since 
Springsteen had no new album to promote it's likely that this was simply
 a showcase for two songs, 'Land of Hope and Dreams' and 'American 
Skin.'<br>
<br>
In 2007 came Live in Dublin from the Seeger Sessions tour. This is a 
patch of three nights and is way overlong. One CD would have been enough
 to get the real juice from what was a great tour. Which brings us to 
Hammersmith Odeon '75, the album that should have been released in 1976,
 the one that could have done the job in the first place. Springsteen 
believed that this concert was the worst he had ever played. When many 
of us who were there heard about this, we struggled to work out how 
blinded we must have been. But then we weren't and when Springsteen 
listened to the tapes on the 30th anniversary of Born to Run he realised
 he'd been wrong all along.<br>
<br>
This is a real concert, showing, as Springsteen notes "an E St Band.... 
armed with a set list that I still dare any young band to match... with 
the keys to the kingdom dangling in front of us and a knife at our neck,
 we'd gone for broke." Listening to 'Tenth Avenue Freeze-out', 'She's 
the One' and 'It's Hard to be a Saint in the City' you can hear that how
 right he is. This was released with no fanfare at all and I know few 
Springsteen fans who ever discuss it. But it is at least released and it
 is representative of what we were looking for all along.<br>
<br>
So what of the other material that could have been released instead of 
the dodgy official ones? Some of those early bootlegs bearing titles 
such as You Can Trust Your Car To The Man Who Wears The Star and Paid 
the Cost to be The Boss were mostly from radio broadcasts that arrived 
in England on scratchy vinyl or over recorded cassettes. Listening to 
some of this material on the internet in their original form you wonder 
that some of it has remained hidden for so long.<br>
<br>
A concert from The Main Point, Philadelphia in 1975 was recently 
released in a series called Transmissions, not I think from the Sony 
camp but in any case with only selected tracks. Unfortunately it leaves 
out the glorious version of 'Incident on 57th Street' with Suki Lahav on
 violin. Then there's the concert from Dave Marsh's rightfully-heralded 
1975 nights at the Bottom Line featuring a great version of Jackie de 
Shannon's 'When You Walk in the Room'. A memorable gig from New York in 
1976 has a lengthy version of the Animals' 'It's My Life', during which 
Springsteen describes the stormy relationship he had with his father.<br>
<br>
One show that you feel could easily have made it onto an official 
release is the 1978 concert from Winterland, San Francisco. This is a 
real Springsteen concert, similar to what we were to experience in 1981 
but darker and heavier. The guitar work from Springsteen and Miami Steve
 is outstanding. Live versions of 'The Fever', 'Because the Night' and 
'Point Blank' have never been played better, the latter knocking spots 
off the version that ended up on The River.<br>
<br>
From then on the live material seems to lose its edge. The bootlegs fail
 to capture the stadium sound as well as at the smaller venues. The 
vocals sound brasher and the guitars don't come through as well. This 
situation doesn't resolve itself until around 2002 when the venues get 
smaller again and the recording techniques improve.<br>
<br>
However, running parallel to these stadium tours are Springsteen's solo 
shows, and here sound quality is no problem. Springsteen had never 
played a solo tour before 1996 when he went out to promote The Ghost of 
Tom Joad. The results as seen at the Albert Hall were compelling but 
rather awkward. The concert he played in Paris that year is a different 
story. Here he approached the material in a relaxed mood. If the album 
itself was initially hard to connect to, this concert is a revelation. 
Springsteen talks each song in with a detailed introduction and they all
 start to make sense. He offers up a selection of stories showing 
various characters victimised by their environment. He plays 
exquisitely, comfortable in a new skin. This is a concert that deserves 
to be heard.<br>
<br>
Lastly there is the Devils and Dust tour of 2005 when he went solo 
again. This time he didn't just keep to the album with a few chosen 
oldies to bolster up the set. It has been said that this was the tour 
when Bruce Springsteen discovered Bruce Springsteen. It is definitely 
the tour when no song was off limits. He aired songs that he hadn't 
played for 30 years, mostly done with real care. 'Two Hearts' is a 
different song, a better song, 'Reason to Believe' sounds like the cry 
of the hobo with a bottle of whisky inside him and a hellhound on his 
trail. 'My Beautiful Reward' is played on a pump organ. 'Cautious Man' 
and 'Valentine's Day' are both stunning. It's not just the songs but 
also the easy rapport with the audience that was missing from the 1996 
tour. When he played 'The Wish' in London, Springsteen said he wasn't 
sure about singing a song about his mother because we were such 'a bunch
 of cynical bastards' over here. Very true. Springsteen cynics would 
find it hard to keep it up after watching any of these shows. He 
finished most nights with a haunting version of Suicide's 'Dream Baby 
Dream'.<br>
<br>
Maybe live albums have to be released near to the albums that they 
represent but the trend seems to suggest otherwise. Older material, such
 as Springsteen's Tracks, Dylan's' Bootleg Series and Van Morrison's 
Philosopher's Stone, has been warmly welcomed. Springsteen has said that
 he has another Tracks up his sleeve. Why not include some live 
material?<br>
<br>
To any Springsteen fan it is the music that thrills, not the knowledge 
that he is a good person, spreading the message of rock'n'roll 
salvation. So let's redress the balance. Perhaps Dave Marsh could hand 
over the baton to someone else, and some of this great music could see 
the light of day.<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle (Columbia)<br>
<br>
Bruce Pollock, New York Times, 16 December 1973<br>
<br>
WHEN BRUCE Springsteen's first Columbia album, Greetings From Asbury 
Park, came out almost a year ago, it was met with the most extravagant 
and outrageous praise I've ever encountered in the Rock Press. Reviewers
 compared him to Bob Dylan, The Band, Van Morrison, Allen Ginsberg, Jack
 Kerouac, El Topo, Webster's New World Dictionary. If superlatives were a
 dime a dozen, Springsteen could have retired then and there.<br>
<br>
Because of the amazing way he broke from the gate, even his most avid 
fans wondered how he could possibly sustain the pace. He'd never be able
 to follow his own act! Meanwhile, the cynical suspected a paper legend 
that would come apart at the first drop of split milk. Springsteen would
 have to do it again before they would believe.<br>
<br>
Now, after five solid months of dedicated labor, that second piece of 
work is here – The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle 
(Columbia KC 32432) – and in an era of diminishing returns, false 
prophets and false bottoms, where the best of our instant pop-up 
superstars are either choked-off, laid-back, lame or laid out flat, it 
is with a great sense of relief that I announce to the disbelievers that
 Bruce Springsteen has delivered another stone, howling, joyous monster 
of a record. Of course the fanatics knew the issue was never really in 
doubt.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is a word virtuoso, who uses language the way his band-mate 
Clarence Clemons plays the sax: tough, fast and funky, sometimes 
frivolous, often devastating. His lyrics are intuitive, emotional, a 
mass of flung images that spin toward you from all directions and 
somehow hang on a canvas – great swatches of local color that blend into
 a landscape of remembered adolescent scenes and dreams in the swamps 
and seasides of Jersey, in the slums of New York.<br>
<br>
In a time when everyone else is leaving the city for greener pastures, 
Springsteen celebrates street life, rendering it completely imagined, 
with places and names – Crazy Janey, Wild Billy, Rosalita. His vision is
 absolutely authentic; there's no doubting that he lives in that world 
of hoods and hitters, sinners, studs and saints. He is Jersey's Hubert 
Selby only younger and less defeated by life.<br>
<br>
But the true gift of the album is the music. The Springsteen Six – 
Clarence Clemons on sax, Danny Federici on organ and accordion, Gary 
Tallent on bass and tuba, Vinnie Lopez on drums and David Sancious on 
piano and Bruce on guitar – can play anything from a circus march to a 
classical dirge, often within the borders of the same piece. The album 
is a mad excursion from rhythm and blues edged in jazz to rock and roll 
touched with folk and funk; it swings like crazy, it drives home the 
torrent of his words to perfection. Each piece (you can't really call 
them "songs") is a world in itself, any one alone worth the price of the
 album.<br>
<br>
In The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle we start out by 
doing 'The E Street Shuffle', which takes place on the updated West Side
 of the Jets and the Sharks, in a speedy r&amp;b tempo. From there it's 
over to Asbury Park to visit Sandy and to experience the carnival 
summertime, penny arcade life on and below the boardwalk. 'Kitty's 
Back', is a street scene reminiscent of Kerouac's be-bop prosody, the 
endless sad jazz night of America, done in miniature by Springsteen's 
crew of romantic loners and losers. 'Wild Billy's Circus Story' is an 
incredible work which ends the side – a contemporary vision of a 
traveling tent show... "God save the human cannon-ball..."<br>
<br>
'Incident on 57th Street' and 'New York City Serenade' again take place 
in the bowels of Manhattan, and both sizzle like Eighth Avenue in 
August. Here are images of hustlers in leather jackets, huddled against 
the wind, cigarettes flickering in the violent night, and their dungaree
 molls, Crazy Janey, Diamond Jackie. 'Rosalita', which occurs between 
those two creations, is a wild, brawling bash, a precise and exuberant 
picture of teenage romance in the seventies. Springsteen's cast of 
characters, including himself, are easy to know and to like. They are 
determined to win you over and they will, and so will the album.<br>
<br>
The selections are neither too long nor too loud, have none of the 
excesses Springsteen has been known to sometimes display live. In fact, 
the album leaves you wishing it would go on forever. Every time 
Springsteen comes to town, all his friends flock to see him. This album 
should increase their number immeasurably.<br>
<br>
Can you imagine what his third album will be like?<br>

<strong class="text-strong">REVIEW- Bruce Springsteen- Landover August 15, 1978<br>
Washington Post , <br>
By Harry Sumrall<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
At the heart of every great Rocker is an animal whose presence 
electrifies the air, whose unblinking eyes pierce the blackness of a 
darkened theater, whose growl sends the crowd to its feet in frenzied 
delight. The rock 'n' roll animal is living, breathing and seething in 
the person of Bruce Springsteen. Springsteen's appearance before a 
capacity crowd at the Capital Centre, Tuesday night was less a concert 
than an assault, Prowling across the stage like a tense, wiry, manic 
cat, he lurked for a moment in the shadows, hesitated, then pounced on 
the audience. <br>
<br>
The thunderous chords of the classic "Summertime Blues" blasted across 
the hall and for the next three hours (not counting a 15-minute 
intermission) the Capital Centre rocked as it has never rocked before - 
and the crowd sprang to its feet for nearly every number. Springsteen 
and his six-piece group featured many of his most popular songs, such as
 "Jungleland," "Thunder Road" and "The Promised Land," as well as 
standards like "Sweet Little Sixteen" and a primal version of "Gloria" 
and "Not Fade Away." The old met the new in a rousing celebration. Some 
writers have said Bruce Springsteen is the Future of rock 'n' roll. 
Forget it. If rock 'n' roll can be timeless, then this guy is.</div>

Beazle many thanks for these - theyre great.  I've converted them all to
 have on my Kindle and I currently have 370 Articles in my Springsteen 
collection  which has helped me through some rush hour bus journeys over
 the past few weeks.<br>
<br>
BTW, if anyone wants these in Kindle format, let me know by PM.  They're
 currently in .PRC format, but I believe they can be easily converted to
 .MOBI which can be read by a number of other e-readers as well.</div>

				<div class="content">Confessions Of A Springsteen Fanatic<br>
By Steve Pond<br>
<br>
I remember when it started: May 31, 1974, the day I first heard Bruce 
Springsteen.  But I don’t remember precisely when I lost control.  Maybe
 it was the following spring, when I left a party at midnight and drove 
across town to get my Springsteen records because nobody would believe 
me about him.<br>
<br>
	Maybe it was August 1975, when I went to the record stores every day 
for a month because I heard Bruce’s “Born To Run” album was about to 
come out and I had to have it the day it hit the stores.<br>
<br>
	Maybe it was 1976, when I spent the night on the sidewalk in front of 
the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium waiting for tickets to go on sale; or 
1978, when I flew to San Francisco to see a single Springsteen show.<br>
<br>
	Maybe it was 1980, when I went to San Francisco for two shows, drove 
all night to get back home immediately after the second show, saw four 
consecutive shows in Los Angeles – and then, already having seen six 
shows in two weeks, got behind the wheel and drove 600 miles to Phoenix 
to see him one more time.<br>
<br>
	Or maybe it was 1984 and ’85, when I saw 18 shows: all 11 shows he did 
in Los Angeles, all four in Oakland and the first three of the tour in 
Minnesota.  To get to those, I arranged a business trip to the East 
Coast so that I’d be heading west at the time Bruce was beginning his 
tour, and then convinced a newspaper to pick up the extra expenses in 
exchange for an opening-night review.<br>
<br>
	Whenever it happened, I’m a Springsteen fanatic.  I’m writing this the 
morning after my 42nd Bruce show, the last performance of his 15-month, 
worldwide “Born In The USA” tour.  I’m exhausted, my ears are still 
ringing, and my wife just called in sick because rearranging her life 
for late-night, open-air concerts has taken its toll.  But if Bruce 
Springsteen decided to do another show tonight in, say, San Diego, I’d 
hop in the car and hit the road.<br>
--<br>
	It’s a rough life.  When tickets go on sale, I wait in line overnight 
to buy them, just in case my music industry contacts don’t work out.  I 
buy his records as soon as they come out, even though I’ll be getting 
copies in the mail.  I buy import copies of his singles because the 
lettering on the sleeve is a different color or the photos are 
different.<br>
<br>
	Once a year, I throw a mock birthday party for Springsteen.  I take 
everything off the walls and put up four dozen Bruce posters and photos;
 I turn on my Springsteen neon sign; I stick my 35 backstage passes to 
the kitchen walls; and I play Bruce videos and Bruce records and Bruce 
tapes.  Then I watch people who’ve never been over before nervously 
mutter “Nice place” when they clearly think I’m a wacko who lives in a 
perpetual Springsteen shrine.<br>
<br>
	I have one friend who has her own Springsteen birthday party.  I have 
other friends I’d never have met without a mutual interest in Bruce.  
And if my wife hadn’t liked Springsteen…well, sometimes I wonder.<br>
<br>
	In the middle of Springsteen’s seven consecutive LA shows last fall, I 
got a call from writer Mikal Gilmore, who’d been convinced partly by my 
enthusiasm to try the seeing-Bruce-every-night regimen.  “I woke up this
 afternoon and realized I only had a few hours before I had to be down 
at the Sports Arena again” Mikal groaned.  “I thought, ‘My God, I’ve got
 the Steve Pond Disease!’ “<br>
<br>
	Mikal still goes to every Springsteen show.  This year he also went to 
the Washington and Oakland shows.  He doesn’t call it the Steve Pond 
Disease anymore.  He’s hooked, and we get along very nicely.<br>
--<br>
	Bruce Springsteen makes great rock’n’roll records and he’s been a heck 
of a nice guy the handful of times we’ve talked.  But is that any reason
 to drop everything whenever his tour enters the Pacific time zone?<br>
<br>
	I don’t know.  It’s not like Bruce saved my life or kept me from going 
crazy or anything like that.  Sure, he restored my passion for 
rock’n’roll at a time when it was hard to sustain and in that way was 
probably responsible for the start of my writing career.  But that was 
when I was still in my teens.  Now I’m 30, and it’s getting harder to 
explain why a passion for one rock-and-roller can reorder my life at 
regular intervals.<br>
<br>
	I know that when I first put on a Springsteen record – which I bought 
for myself on my birthday in 1974, because I’d heard good things about 
the guy and figured it was worth a shot – the wildly romantic menagerie 
of characters and the unrestrained wash of musical influences left me 
open-mouthed by the middle of the second song.  I know that when I first
 saw him two months later, even at that early stage, he was the greatest
 live performer I’d ever seen.<br>
<br>
	And I know that I’m still as impressed, though the freewheeling 
romantic of those early records has grown into a writer more focused, 
realistic and sober-minded, and a showman who has by now perfected the 
rock concert.<br>
<br>
	But that’s not why I act like such a maniac.  For that, you’ll have to 
start with the standard reasons: Because every night is different.  
Because you never know what he’s going to do.  Because in a single 
Springsteen show is a range as all-encompassing as the work of half a 
dozen other artists, from monumental silliness to heart-breaking 
compassion to raging determination.  Because on any given night when 
Springsteen is playing, there is nothing I would rather do.  And because
 Bruce has never done a show that’s made me think that attitude was a 
mistake.<br>
<br>
	(In case my last shreds of critical credibility haven’t all flown out 
the window, I ought to add that this doesn’t mean I love every show the 
guy does: Lately I think his second set has been too short and the 
concerts were a little too pat and he should’ve done “Backstreets” or 
“Point Blank” or “Racing In The Street” occasionally, and it worries me 
when I can lip-synch his raps as well as his songs…But then, I do the 
same thing every night he’s in town; why shouldn’t he?  Besides, the 
show I saw last night was completely wonderful and I’m not in a critical
 mood.)<br>
<br>
	On a Springsteen tour, every night’s song list is different – but 
what’s more important is that seeing a string of shows gives you a 
ringside seat at a process that’s unique in rock and roll.  Night to 
night, you can see changes made, limits tested, experiments tried and 
adopted or discarded, themes explored.<br>
<br>
	It came into focus last year when he did seven shows at the LA Sports 
Arena.  Midway through the engagement he decided to drop “Rosalita,” the
 raucous rocker that had been his closing number for a decade.  Instead 
of substituting another rave-up song, he chose “Racing In The Street,” a
 chilling ballad about lost opportunities.  Every night, the song got 
better; every night, he rearranged both the set and the song and 
darkened the complexion of what was once a flat-out party-time set.  He 
started talking over the song’s instrumental introduction, slipping into
 the character of a weary hot rodder whose wife hides the keys to keep 
him from heading down to the drag.<br>
<br>
	“It got hard to make her understand,” he’d say softly, “that when I 
took the car out, and when I won, it was the only time I got to feelin’ 
good about myself.”  The lines could as easily apply to a kid with a 
guitar.  “And that to have just one thing in your whole life that makes 
you proud of yourself – that’s not too much for anybody to ask.  Not too
 much at all.”  Then he’d ease into the song, stretching out its ending 
until you thought the slow, mournful music said all there was to say - 
and then capping his tale of one last shot at redemption with a whisper:
 “That was the night that we left.  We still don’t know where we’re 
going, but I guess that’ll come in time.  As for this place, we’ll 
always remember it.”  Then, with the crowd quietly expecting 
“Rosalita,”, he’d walk offstage.<br>
<br>
	Every night, it was worth the trip downtown and the $15 tickets just to see what he’d do with that song.<br>
--<br>
	There are plenty of others like me out there, and a good many of them 
make my fanaticism look mild.  Springsteen maniacs surround you, and 
unless you know the warning signs we’re a deceptive lot.  We don’t wear 
Bruce T-shirts to work.  We can carry on adult conversations about 
politics or books or movies or the weather.  If someone says, “Nice 
day,” we don’t automatically retort, “Yeah, like when I saw Bruce at the
 Roxy in ’75.”<br>
<br>
	But when Bruce gets ready to put out a record, we start acting antsy.  
When tickets go on sale we’re on the phone a lot, exchanging details 
about the least-trafficked ticket outlets and planning our strategies.  
When Bruce comes to town we’re exhausted the morning after every show.<br>
<br>
	And we can also be possessive, especially now that Bruce is the 
favorite of people whose older brothers and sisters never believed us 
when 10 years ago we sang the praises of “The Wild, the Innocent and the
 E Street Shuffle.”  On a recent Op-Ed page of the Los Angeles Times, 
for example, writer Bob Baker spoke for lots of longtime Springsteen 
fans: “Thousands of you people jamming those concerts discovered 
Springsteen sometime last week,” he snapped, “and have proclaimed 
yourself rock-ribbed fans.  You’re not…Are you listening, Miss Woodland 
Hills High School Sophomore With the Daddy’s-Money-Fourth-Row Tickets, 
who thinks ‘Jungleland’ is a Disneyland ride?...You think ‘Kitty’s Back 
in Town’ is a song from ‘Cats’.”<br>
<br>
	The guy’s got a point, but he blew it.  The name of the song isn’t “Kitty’s Back in Town.”  It’s “Kitty’s Back.”<br>
<br>
	See, we’re a demanding lot, and we find it hard to share Bruce 
Springsteen when he’s changed from our private secret to some sort of 
national icon.  It’s hard to share him with the teen-age girls in front 
of me Monday, who danced themselves silly during “I’m Goin’ Down” and 
“Glory Days” but sat during “Thunder Road.”  It’s hard to share him with
 the guy next to me last Sunday who yelled “Yo, dude!” every time Bruce 
started talking.  It’s hard to share him with the pickup truck full of 
rowdies who barreled past me last weekend blaring “Dancing in the Dark” 
and shouting “SPRINGSTEEEEEEN!” (Don’t they know the appropriate yell is
 “BROOOOCE!”?<br>
<br>
	But elitism like this is dumb.  Bruce Springsteen has welcomed his 
other fans and so should we.  He’s marvelously reassuring and convenient
  as a private obsession – an easy way to prove to yourself you’ve got 
good taste – but he’s far more important as a national treasure.  Sure, 
some fans misinterpret “Born in the USA” and come to the shows to hear 
the singles from the latest album, but they’d have to be pretty dense 
not to come away with more than that.  And even if that’s all they get, 
it’s still the best party in town, and who am I to deny anybody an 
invitation when Bruce Springsteen’s given them one?<br>
<br>
	So I go to all the shows, not with the stunned euphoria that hits most 
people the first time they see him, but with an eye for the changes, the
 tunes that hit home each particular night, the special moments.  After 
11 years, 42 concerts and untold people questioning my sanity, I’ve got 
plenty of those moments to treasure.<br>
--<br>
	I remember the first time, when a 24-year-old in a white tank top and 
gray slacks came onstage in front of a handful of people who’d come to 
the Santa Monica Civic to see Dr. John (and some of us who’d come for 
“Bruce Springstein,” as some ads put it).  His 40-minute show opened the
 eyes of everyone in the place; when it was over and he simply had to do
 an encore, he pulled out a 20-minute version of his meandering, 
atmospheric ballad “New York City Serenade.”<br>
<br>
	I remember seeing him two weeks after his 1975 Time and Newsweek cover 
stories in the gym of a university two hours north of LA, hitting his 
stride with a show far more explosive than the heralded ones he’d done 
in town.  After two encores the crowd simply refused to leave; Bruce 
came out alone, sat down at the piano and turned “For You” from an 
up-tempo rock song into a surpassingly poignant ballad.<br>
<br>
	I remember spending the night on the sidewalk in front of the Roxy in 
1978 because Springsteen, who’d just played the 18,000-seat Forum, 
wanted to do a smaller show.  That show ended with Bruce and his band 
dragged out of the showers because, once again, nobody would go home.  
He did “Twist and Shout” and I nearly fell off my chair.<br>
<br>
	I remember driving from LA to Phoenix in 1980, good-naturedly 
complaining to a CBS staffer about my seats and ending up with the 
front-row center seats Springsteen saves for every performance.  The day
 before, Ronald Reagan had been elected president; that night, 
Springsteen stopped near the end of the first set and said, “I don’t 
know what you guys think about what happened last night, but I think 
it’s pretty frightening.”  Then he tore into “Badlands” – his rock-hard 
tale of grim determination to survive – with a fury almost too much for 
even that masterful song to contain.<br>
<br>
	I remember a week ago, when in front of 85,000 fans at the LA Coliseum 
he told “the young people” in the audience that “blind faith in your 
leaders, in 1985, will get you killed.”  Then he blasted into Edwin 
Starr’s antiwar song “War” (“War! What is it good for? Absolutely 
nuthin’!”), in one of his most surprising and exhilarating covers ever.<br>
<br>
	And I remember the last night of his 1985 tour.  He told the crowd it 
had been the best year of his life, asked us not to let him down and 
finished with a giddy version of, appropriately enough, “Glory Days.”  A
 few songs earlier, though, he’d given the crowd one of the sweetest 
benedictions imaginable with a soaring version of his “Bobby Jean.”  The
 song ends with the image of a traveler hearing Bruce’s song while out 
on the road: “If you do, you’ll know I’m thinking of you and all the 
miles in between/And I’m just calling one last time, not to change your 
mind/But just to say I miss you baby/Good luck, goodbye, Booby Jean.”<br>
<br>
	There have been lots of other moments: songs that hit their peak one 
night, sets that made me wonder if rock and roll could ever get any 
better, nights that fulfilled every promise the music ever made.  And as
 someone who, for better or worse, has gotten some of his greatest joys 
and most profound emotional experiences through popular music, I can say
 that every time I’ve listened to Bruce he’s shown me that my enthusiasm
 isn’t misplaced.<br>
<br>
	“Enthusiasm,” I guess, is the key word.  It may be a little late for 
this kind of disclaimer, but I’m writing about enthusiasm – ridiculous, 
over-the-edge, wide-eyed enthusiasm – rather than hero worship.  I had a
 great time during the last Springsteen tour, but I’m not going into 
mourning now that it’s over.  After all, blind faith in your rockers 
isn’t a very good idea, either.<br>
<br>
	Springsteen himself says it every night during “Thunder Road.”  “I 
ain’t no hero, that’s understood,” he sings, “And all the redemption I 
can offer is beneath this dirty hood.”<br>
<br>
	Hey, Bruce, I understand.  But thanks for some of that redemption, and I’ll see you next time around.</div>

 <br>
Sarfraz Manzoor<br>
The Observer,  January  6 2013</strong><br>
<br>
What makes a bromance?<br>
<br>
In the winter of 1993 I wrote a letter to my closest friend informing 
him that our friendship had come to an end. I was 22 and had known 
Amolak since we were both 16; as teenagers we had bonded over music, 
marriage and money.<br>
<br>
We were passionate about music and its capacity to inspire; we were both
 raised in traditional Asian families and dreaded the prospect of an 
arranged marriage; and as the children of working-class immigrant 
parents we hankered after the liberating potential of money. So when 
Amolak revealed he had landed a plum job at an investment bank within 
months of graduating I was crushed. I was languishing in low-paid admin 
work and the news that my friend had leapfrogged over me with his new 
job was not only depressing on a financial level, but I was also 
convinced his impending wealth would drive a wedge between us. And so I 
sat down and wrote a letter detailing why our friendship was ending, how
 I wished it did not have to be this way and how I wished him well in 
his cash-drenched future. I sent the letter and assumed it was the end. 
It was never discussed or even referred to again, and our friendship 
continued as if nothing had ever changed. We were guys, after all.<br>
<br>
I met Amolak in the first week of term at Luton Sixth Form College. It 
was 1987. I was British Pakistani Muslim and he was a British Indian 
Sikh; he wore a turban and I was clean shaven; he liked a drink and I 
was teetotal; he held a postgraduate degree in bullshitting – impressing
 girls with descriptions of countries he had only visited in the pages 
of National Geographic – while I was stupidly shy around them. Neither 
of us was good looking, but only I was burdened by self-awareness. 
Somehow we got on. He introduced me to the music of Bruce Springsteen, 
and the Boss was ever-present in our conversations. One thing I found 
very appealing about Springsteen's songs was that he was as likely to 
sing about male friendship, about which I knew something, as he was to 
sing about love, of which I knew nothing at all. "Bobby Jean", 
Springsteen's song about his friendship with guitarist Steve Van Zandt, 
summed up Amolak and my friendship, too: "Now we went walking in the 
rain talking about the pain from the world we hid, now there ain't 
nobody nowhere no how gonna ever understand me the way you did."<br>
<br>
Amolak and I would meet every Saturday afternoon in a cheap restaurant 
on the second floor of Luton's Arndale Centre and over a shared pot of 
tea we would talk. There was intense verbal communication between us, 
but it was largely devoted to finding new and imaginative ways to insult
 each other. Our conversations would be strewn with random profanity and
 gratuitous personal insults which often drew in close family members. 
This was not how I would talk to female friends, but male friendship 
appears to necessitate couching raw emotions in a cocoon of benign 
abuse.<br>
<br>
In the community where I grew up, male friendship was encouraged but 
friendship between males and females was not. I could not admit to my 
parents that I even had female friends, and the idea of openly meeting 
up with a girl was out of the question. Male friendship was 
non-threatening and celebrated in both the Indian films which I watched 
with my family and in the films, television and books which I consumed 
alone.<br>
<br>
The American novelist and essayist Michael Chabon has written about male
 friendship in his Pulitzer prize-winning The Amazing Adventures of 
Kavalier and Clay and his latest book Telegraph Avenue, which is set 
inside an Oakland record store. "For men to really become best friends 
there has to be an element of adventure," he tells me. "You have to set 
out to accomplish something and in the course of failing or succeeding 
you become friends." The mission Amolak and I had agreed on was to make 
more of our lives than could reasonably be expected of two working-class
 Asian kids growing up in Luton.<br>
<br>
In time we left to study at different universities and I became a writer
 and Amolak a banker. There was competition but it was not, as I had 
feared, fatal to our friendship, because it was in different realms. His
 success was in accumulation – air miles, an American Express black 
card, personalised number plates – while mine was in experiences: 
meeting interesting people and going to interesting places. Our lives 
changed but our friendship remained reassuringly the same. Amolak was, 
to use a term coined by Geoffrey Greif, author of Buddy System: 
Understanding Male Friendships, a "must friend". A must friend is 
someone who is part of the inner circle whom you can confide in and rely
 on. Greif identifies three further varieties of male friendship: "trust
 friends" whom you can confide in but aren't part of the inner circle, 
"rust friends" with whom you are friendly largely because of the length 
of the friendship, and finally "just friends", who are guys whose 
company you enjoy but who you have not known long enough or well enough 
to qualify for the other categories.<br>
<br>
Amolak was definitely a must friend, and though I had moved to London 
and he remained in Luton with his parents we would still meet upstairs 
at the Arndale Centre, share a pot of tea and conduct conversations 
laced with good-natured abuse and arcane quotes from spaghetti westerns 
and the inevitable discussions of the Springsteen concerts we now had 
the money to attend. Male friendships, according to Greif, tend to be 
"side by side" – meaning that they involve doing something – rather than
 the "face to face" friendships women tend to prefer. In my and Amolak's
 case the activity was seeing Springsteen concerts – we spent our late 
20s dodging our families' pleas that we get married by darting around 
the world seeing concerts. That was where our friendship felt most 
alive, and that was where it died.<br>
<br>
The change came without warning. It was 2003 and we were in New York 
City; the final night of Springsteen's world tour. The idea of flying to
 another country to see a concert had lost its novelty – by then it was 
something we did almost without thinking. My friend and I were now 32; 
our friendship had, without us realising it, become as ritualised as our
 Springsteen obsession. Amolak had become a rust friend: all we did was 
worry about the future and pine for the past. The concert ended and we 
gave each other a hug. And that was the last time I saw him for six 
years.<br>
<br>
When we returned home something had changed. Phone calls were not 
returned, emails not read, and I had no idea why. The years floated past
 and I hardly saw him: I experienced the weird sensation of attending a 
Springsteen concert alone. When friends asked if we had fallen out I 
could honestly say no, but when they asked how he was I had to admit I 
had no idea. Perhaps the friendship had run aground; maybe we had run 
out of road. The years passed and I grew accustomed to the new reality. 
It would have been a simple thing to just ask him directly – but that 
wasn't really our style.<br>
<br>
It's sometimes suggested that women get in the way of male friendships, 
but it was a woman who rescued my friendship with Amolak. During our 
time apart I had met a woman and fallen in love with her, and she had 
agreed to marry me. Bridget wanted me to make more of an effort to 
contact this friend I had told her so much about, and at her nudging I 
did. I said I had met "the one" and I wanted him to meet her. Amolak 
said he, too, had met the love of his life. We arranged a meal: me, 
Bridget, Amolak and Amanda-Jane.<br>
<br>
It should have been uncomfortable, but it was delightful; the previous 
six years were never mentioned. One of the glories of male friendship is
 that it is relatively low maintenance: no birthday cards, no Christmas 
cards, no get well soon cards; no apologies, no explanations and no 
formalities. But it meant we never talked it out, we never sought 
"closure" – we just pretended it had never happened. We met a few more 
times and what I realised was that the separation had been because our 
friendship had been holding us both back. Amolak and I had spent so much
 time complaining about our lives there was little time to do anything 
about it; the time we could have spent looking for love was spent in 
each other's company. It wasn't an accident that both of us found love 
during the hiatus of our friendship. It was only possible without the 
crutch of friendship.<br>
<br>
I got married in August 2010. Amolak did a reading during the ceremony –
 the lyrics of "If I Should Fall Behind", a Springsteen song – and he 
made a speech at the dinner. He had married the previous month and by 
the following year both our wives had given birth: a girl, Laila, for us
 and a boy, Arjun, for them. The age gap between my daughter and 
Amolak's son is one month and five days – the precise same age gap which
 exists between Amolak and me.<br>
<br>
We were lucky that we became fathers at around the same time. I happen 
to know David Baddiel, and I have talked to him about this: he and Frank
 Skinner have been friends for more than 20 years and the success of 
Fantasy Football League was partly due to the affection that exists 
between them. "It can get complicated when only one friend has kids," 
Baddiel tells me. "For a long time I was the one with children, but 
Frank recently became a father and it rebooted our friendship – when his
 partner was about to give birth I took Frank out and gave him, for what
 it was worth, the benefit of all my wisdom about children, and he later
 told me that it was a very important moment for him and our 
friendship." Children drag an old friendship into the vivid present: 
when Amolak and I used to meet we would sit around and talk about the 
old days, but now we talk about life right now.<br>
<br>
If I met Amolak for the first time today I suspect we would not be 
friends: I would judge him harshly for being a banker and he would 
distrust me for working in the media. Our lives are very different: he 
still lives in Luton and I am in London, he surrounds himself mostly 
with male friends and most of my friends are female and, of course, he 
earns yachtloads more money than I could even hope to make. Having a 
wife who is also my best friend has made me less reliant on friends for 
emotional support, and yet there is something deeply precious about our 
friendship. "The older you get the more you appreciate the value of 
close emotional ties," says Baddiel, who covered this subject in his 
film The Infidel. "Because your awareness of mortality increases, and so
 you realise: I need to see this person because I don't know how much 
longer I've got left."<br>
<br>
It is not only an awareness of the finiteness of the road ahead that 
makes me grateful for my friendship; it is also the knowledge of the 
miles we travelled together over the past 25 years. These days it is 
hard for us to meet without our families, but this summer we managed it.
 It was 14 July, Amolak's birthday and the day Springsteen was playing 
at Hyde Park. Amolak booked a room at a fancy hotel, and while our wives
 and babies made use of the pool my friend and I headed to the park. As 
the music played the years fell away: the writer and the banker became 
the wide-eyed teenage boys they once were. I remembered our endless 
conversations about the future: how we weren't going to be like the 
rest, how we would make more of our lives and do our parents proud, and I
 remembered how ridiculous it all sounded at the time. In the circles 
both of us now mingle in it is hard to explain just what it was like 
back then and that, I realised, is why I cherish my friendship. When we 
were teenagers our conversations were about our hopes. Today those boys 
are fathers, but when Amolak and I are together we get very briefly to 
return to being the people we were in those days before published books 
and BMWs with personalised plates, before wives and children, when all 
we had was hope in our hearts and dreams in our heads.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen &amp; Wall Street’s Wrecking Ball: A Contract With America<br>
Monika Mitchell</strong><br>
<br>
CEO, Good Business International Inc.<br>
<br>
A rather caustic editorial from Bloomberg News‘ nameless “editors” 
mocked Goldman Sachs defector, Greg Smith, in fake 
bully-on-the-playground bravura. Just like blogging commentators, it’s 
easy to be brave when your identity is hidden. It is even easier to be a
 bully when you can take a few swings and slink back under your rock in 
the refuge of a giant media powerhouse. The anonymous jabs aimed at 
Smith’s hope that integrity be part of Wall Street profit-making reveal 
the wide disparity between common financial models and the 21st century 
ethos of “Doing Well by Doing Good.” The editors retort: “Yes, Mr. 
Smith, Goldman Sachs Is All About Making Money,” Nowhere in that 
statement or any other defense of Goldman is there anything about 
creating value for dollars, simply a tacit endorsement of profit at any 
cost.<br>
What Greg Smith’s op-ed confirms is that four years after Bear Stearns 
collapsed under the weight of risky bets, the destructive and toxic 
for-profit model that created the crisis has not changed: the model that
 Bruce Springsteen lyrically calls “the Wrecking Ball.”<br>
Since when does the biggest baddest investment bank of them all, one 
that transformed from the most admired financial institution in the 
world to the poster-child of Wall Street evil, need to be defended from a
 single “mid-level” rogue employee? Since the accusation of greed and 
corruption struck a resonant chord of truth so deep between Wall 
Street’s wrecking ball and the rest of the modern world, it could not be
 ignored.<br>
In a powerful Rolling Stone interview with national heroes, Bruce 
Springsteen and comedian Jon Stewart, “the Boss” outlines “the street 
criminalization of the big-money Wall Street hustle” echoed in Smith’s 
op-ed that has lit the fire of outrage in millions of Americans. 
Explains Bruce: “That hustle has been legitimized over the past four 
years, when you have that level of risk and greed at the top of the 
financial industry, and people basically walking away scot-free, 
completely unaccountable. That lack of accountability is the poison shot
 straight into the heart of the country.”<br>
And so it has. The poison has created a dual society in our nation that 
Springsteen warns, slices “the country down the middle” — one where the 
powerful and well-placed follow a different set of rules from the rest 
of the nation. Main Street is supposed to obey the law and pay the price
 for its actions if it doesn’t, while Wall Street’s most powerful 
institutions are handed the get-out-of-jail card free by those who make 
and enforce the laws.<br>
To America’s citizens, the hustle of the 2008-2010 crisis and unilateral
 banking bailouts go far beyond government failure and move to political
 corruption of the highest degree. Springsteen compares the lack of 
accountability in the post-crisis handling of both the Bush and Obama 
years to the Watergate scandal, one of the darkest periods in our 
national history. “Watergate legitimized the hustle at the top of the 
game … It legitimized every street-corner thug.”<br>
Watergate made a mockery of American justice revealing a corruption so 
deep and pervasive that it “almost had the country brought down by it.” 
For Springsteen and America, the financial crisis has exposed the same. 
Financial historian Professor Robert Wright calls the flaws in the 
current Wall Street-Federal model: the socialization of risk and the 
privatization of profits that has “planted the seeds of future crisis.” 
Everyone in America knows, with the possible exception of a few still in
 denial, that the “risk takers” were rewarded by transferring Wall 
Street losses onto the backs of an overburdened Main Street.<br>
Every day in grade school, children put their hands over their hearts 
and pledge allegiance to a nation that stands for “liberty and justice 
for all.” Springsteen asks, “What happened to that social contract?” 
Where is the promise that our children pray for?<br>
What made this country great were not the bullies in the playground who 
laugh at the “naïve” integrity of fellow citizens. It is the shared 
sacrifice of our parents and grandparents who fought against injustice 
both on foreign and home shores to right the wrongs of an unequal dream.
 Those that saved every penny of their hard earned cash only to watch it
 evaporate during the Great Depression — a time so tough that a new 
president came to the aid of the powerless and demanded that America’s 
promise of equality be fulfilled.<br>
So here we are again: one more time. As Occupy Wall Street began the 
conversation last fall with a call for a fair deal for everyone, Greg 
Smith’s op-ed reveals that good conscience may be dead for a soul-sick 
Wall Street, but Main Street is still holding out hope to reinstate 
America’s broken social contract.<br>
The antidote for the poison shot into the heart of America is justice. 
Springsteen sings the struggle of many Americans who lost their jobs and
 homes in these post-crisis years:<br>
I’ve been lookin’ for the map that leads me home; I’ve been stumblin’ on
 good hearts turned to stone…We yelled “help” but the cavalry stayed 
home; There ain’t no one hearing the bugle blown…<br>
Springsteen’s ballad asks the questions the nation asks of its leaders:<br>
Where the eyes, the eyes with the will to see Where the hearts, that run
 over with mercy Where’s the love that has not forsaken me Where’s the 
work that set my hands, my soul free<br>
The social contract implicit in America’s promise and defended by 
country men and women on the beaches of Normandy, the streets of 
Birmingham and the squatter city of Zuccotti Park is woven into every 
aspect of American culture from Washington, to Wall Street, to Main 
Street.<br>
The contract is not “All About Making Money” as some would have us 
believe. Rather it represents a common commitment to abolish tyranny and
 injustice that continues to surface in legal battles of foreclosure 
fraud and class actions suits against an out-of-control banking industry
 that became an enemy to its own people.<br>
The social contract that our culture is based on is something far 
greater than the myopic self-serving greed we have witnessed. It 
emanates from deeply embedded values established centuries ago like 
integrity, democratic ideals and fair play that improve with each 
generation.<br>
Echoed in Springsteen’s poetry is the historic promise of America to its
 citizens:  “From sea to shining sea…Wherever this flag’s flown, we take
 care of our own.”<br>
Monika Mitchell is the co-author of “Conversations with Wall Street” — a
 collection of candid discussions with Wall Street market makers on 
ethics in the mortgage securities industry. CWWS outlines a social 
contract between America and the Financial Industry.</div>
