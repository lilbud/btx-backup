				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen on Outlaw Pete<br>
Washington Post<br>
November 3,  2014<br>
<br>
Nora King<br>
<br>
With the publication of his not-quite-for-children children’s book, 
“Outlaw Pete,” Bruce Springsteen has surprised even himself. Writing 
such a book “was the last thing I saw coming,” he says, never mind the 
many other rock stars who have delved into the children’s section lately
 — including, most recently, Keith Richards with “Gus &amp; Me.”<br>
<br>
The Boss says “there’s no grand plan behind this.” Still, he admits 
publishing the book, inspired by his song of the same name, is a kick, 
and in a phone interview joked, “maybe I’ll have a whole series now.”<br>
<br>
Despite the many Springsteen songs that might make a good children’s 
story — he admits that “Blinded by the Light,” with its antic rhymes, 
“would be fun to read” — this book is not the first of a series. “Outlaw
 Pete,” which comes out Tuesday, was a bit of a lark, and, he writes in 
the afterword, “I’m not sure this is a children’s book.”<br>
<br>
Indeed, the book deals with some heavy themes — death, violence and 
abandonment among them — and does not sugarcoat them. The book’s 
illustrations, by cartoonist Frank Caruso, include vivid scenes of a 
knife fight and a man lying dead in a pool of blood.<br>
<br>
Essentially an illustrated version of the song from his 2009 album 
“Working on a Dream,” the 50-page picture book begins with Pete, as a 
6-month-old, robbing a bank and follows him through the course of a life
 as “an outlaw killer and a thief.” Wherever he goes, “women wept and 
men died.” About midway through the story, Pete seeks redemption, 
marrying a Navajo girl and having a child.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Springsteen collaborated with illustrator Frank Caruso on “Outlaw Pete.<br>
<br>
But for him there is no escape from who he is — “I’m Outlaw Pete” is the
 refrain he repeats more fervently as the book moves into its dark 
second half. A bounty hunter comes to remind him, “you think you’ve 
changed but you have not.” And to prove the point, Pete kills him. “We 
cannot undo these things we’ve done” are the man’s final words. Pete 
rides off into the proverbial sunset — in this case an icy ledge — into 
legend, a bereft young girl calling out after him: “Outlaw Pete! Outlaw 
Pete! Can you hear me? Can you hear me?”<br>
<br>
The story, Springsteen writes in the afterword, “is not easy.” But, he 
adds “I believe children instinctively understand passion and tragedy. 
And a 6-month-old, bank-robbing baby is a pretty good protagonist.”<br>
<br>
On the phone, he describes the book as a cross between the spaghetti 
westerns of Sergio Leone and “Goodnight Moon,” a favorite book of his 
three children, Evan, Jessica and Sam, who are in their 20s.<br>
<br>
“The characters are outlandish. They’re not real. They’re mythical. The 
tale is a fable,” he says. And while it has an admittedly a challenging 
lesson “about the difficulty of redemption,” this shouldn’t scare off 
kids — or their parents.<br>
<br>
“If ‘Bambi’ is for kids, this is fine,” he says. “If ‘Lion King’ is for kids, this will be fine also.”<br>
<br>
“The act of growing up is filled with so much raw passion and tragedy 
that they can’t escape it,” he says. “Children’s lives revolve around 
these things, and as parents we do our best to guide them through these 
things, but we can’t protect them from occurring.”<br>
<br>
As a friend once told him, he recalls, “Parents give their kids the best
 they have to offer, and the world takes care of the rest. There’s no 
escaping from the blues or whatever you want to call it.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen had no plans to make a book — children’s or otherwise — out 
of the song until he heard from Caruso. The cartoonist was immediately 
drawn to the dark tale when he first heard the song version in 2009.<br>
<br>
“I stopped what I was doing and thought it was like a story being read to me,” Caruso says. “Everyone’s got to be seeing this.”<br>
<br>
He made some pencil sketches and presented them to Springsteen and 
Caruso’s mutual friend, music critic Dave Marsh. About a year and a half
 later, Caruso got a call out of the blue one Sunday morning from 
Springsteen, who was excited about the project. “This was the first time
 anyone has approached me to do a book of this kind,” Springsteen says.<br>
<br>
The collaboration went smoothly, according to both the writer and the 
illustrator, with about three or four dummy copies of the book passing 
back and forth between them. “He dug the pencil drawings,” Caruso says 
of Springsteen. “It was just a matter of tweaking a color to get the 
right emotion.”<br>
<br>
On the eve of the book’s publication, Springsteen says he feels the work has a universal appeal.<br>
<br>
“It’s a very human story,” he says. “We start carrying some of the 
baggage of our past as small children. And then at some point we either 
try to sort it out or outrun it. You can’t outrun it, which is what this
 character tries to do. And it’s very difficult to sort it out. But it’s
 the only way to go.”</div>

ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE<br>
OCTOBER 31  2014</strong><br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
What's the best concert you ever saw?</strong><br>
<br>
Springsteen. I went to see him at the Ice Arena in Lewiston, Maine, in 
1977. He played for about four hours. It was fantastic. There's so much 
energy, so much generosity in the show, and so much real life in the 
music. He was totally athletic, and he'd jump into the crowd, lay on his
 back and spin around. He was a great showman.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
Do you respect him as a storyteller?</strong><br>
<br>
I respect him as a songwriter and the insight in his songs. My favorite 
album of his is Nebraska. I knew from the beginning of "Atlantic City" 
that it was amazing. He had really grown as a songwriter. He's done 
stuff in music that nobody else has done. That line in "The River," "Now
 I just act like I don't remember, and Mary acts like she don't care." 
Let's put it this way, it's a long way from "Palisades Park" by Freddy 
Cannon.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">I feel like you and Bruce would both be doing what you're doing, even if you weren't paid for it.</strong><br>
<br>
Yeah, I think it's fair. And it'd be fair to say that we were both 
self-taught with a lot of ambition, a lot of drive to succeed, because I
 have that in me too. I have this one thing that I can do, and that's 
something Bruce expresses in a lot of his music.</div>

IFB Presents: 7 Classic Springsteen Stories That Are Well Worth Mass Retelling<br>
September 10, 2013 </strong><br>
<br>
<br>
1. The ‘Rosalita’ Story (as related by Springsteen during a 1975 “lost” 
interview with a European journalist. This interview was subsequently 
recovered, and then published via Backstreets): “[Rosalita]‘s just about
 a guy. Like when I was a kid, I had this one girl, and her mother – 
it’s the same old thing, it happens every day: the hassles with the 
parents and stuff. And I had a court injunction put against me when I 
was 16 or 17 or something. That I couldn’t go near this girl because I 
was – I don’t know what the hell I was. But they did that. It was a 
thing where her mother disliked me a lot and went to the trouble of 
calling the cops on me if I came around. Had a court thing go down where
 I couldn’t see her. So I guess that’s what ‘Rosie’ is about. At night 
you walk by the house but you wouldn’t go up to it, or you’d run up the 
driveway and stand under the window and say, ‘Hey!’”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Night At The Movies (as related by Springsteen during a 1981 Musician
 interview with Dave Marsh): “The other night I went out, I went 
driving, we were in St. Louis. Got a car and went out, drove all around.
 Went to the movies by myself, walked in, got my popcorn. This guy comes
 up to me, real nice guy. He says, ‘Listen. You want to sit with me and 
my sister?’ I said, ‘Alright.’ <br>
<br>
So we watch the movie. It was great, too, because it was that Woody 
Allen movie [Stardust Memories] the guy’s slammin’ to his fans. I’m 
sittin’ there and this poor kid says, ‘Jesus, I don’t know what to say 
to ya. Is this the way it is? Is this how you feel?’ I said, ‘No, I 
don’t feel like that so much.’ And he had the amazing courage to come up
 to me at the end of the movie and ask if I’d go to his home and meet 
his mother and father. I said, ‘What time is it?’ It was 11 o’clock, so I
 said, ‘Well, OK.’<br>
<br>
So I go home with him, he lives out in some suburb. So we get over to 
the house and here’s his mother and father, laying out on the couch, 
watching TV and reading the paper. He brings me in and says, ‘Hey, I got
 Bruce Springsteen here.’ And they don’t believe him. So he pulls me 
over and he says, ‘This is Bruce Springsteen.’ ‘Aw, g’wan,’ they say. So
 he runs in his room and brings out an album and he holds it up to my 
face. And his mother says, ‘Ohhh yeah!’ She starts yelling ‘Yeah!’ She 
starts screaming. <br>
<br>
And for two hours I was in this kid’s house, talking with these people, 
they were really nice. They cooked me up all this food, watermelon, and 
the guy gave me a ride home a few<br>
hours later. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I felt so good that night. Because here are these strange people I 
didn’t know, they take you in their house, treat you fantastic, and this
 kid was real nice. They were real nice. That’s something that can 
happen to me that can’t happen to most people. And when it does happen 
it’s fantastic. You get somebody’s whole life in three hours. You get 
their parents, you get their sister, you get their family life, in three
 hours. And I went back to that hotel and felt really good, because I 
thought, Wow, what a thing to be able to do. What an experience to be 
able to have, to be able to step into some stranger’s life.’” <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. The Harry Chapin Story (As related by Springsteen during a 
Congressional Medal of Honor Ceremony at Carnegie Hall on December 7, 
1987): “I remember when Sandy [Chapin] sent me this tape [of Harry's 
'Remember When the Music']. I listened to it and I said, ‘Gee. This is a
 little on the corny side. And I sat down and I tried to think of what 
the song was about. And I guess there was a time when people felt that 
music provided you with a greater sense of unity, a greater sense of 
shared vision and purpose than it does today. And my generation, we were
 the generation that was gonna change the world. Somehow we were gonna 
make it a little less lonely, a little less hungry … a little more just 
place. But it seems that when that promise slipped through our hands, we
 didn’t replace it with nothing but lost faith. Now we live in times 
that are pretty shattered. I got my music. You got yours. The guy down 
the street, he’s got his. And you could kind of sit back and say – not 
cynically but truthfully – ‘Well, maybe, maybe all men are not brothers.
 Maybe we won’t ever know who or what we are to each other.’ But I think
 Harry instinctively knew that it was gonna take a lot more than just 
love to survive. That it was gonna take a strong sense of purpose, a 
duty, and a good, clean eye on the dirty ways of the world. So in 
keepin’ his promise to himself, he reminds us of our promise to 
ourselves. Tonight, alongside Harry, it’s that promise that his spirit 
would have us remember, and honor, and recommit to. So … do something. 
And may his song be sung.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
4. The ‘My Father’s House’ Story (As related by Springsteen during a 
solo acoustic performance at the Christic Benefit Concert, Los Angeles, 
November, 1990): “I used to, uh, I had this habit for a long time. I 
would get in my car and I would drive back through my old neighborhood, 
back to the town that I grew up in. And, uh, I’d always drive past the 
old houses that I used to live in. Sometimes late at night … when I used
 to be up at night (laughs). And, uh, I got so I would do it really 
regularly … two, three, four times a week, for years. And I eventually 
got to wonderin’, What the hell am I doin’? And so, I went to see this 
psychiatrist, and, uh – this is true – and, uh, I sat down and I said, 
‘Doc, uh, for years I’ve been getting in my car and I drive back to my 
town and I pass my houses late at night and, y’know, what am I doing?’ 
And he said, ‘I want you to tell me what you think that you’re doing.’ 
So I go, ‘That’s what I’m paying you for.’ So he says, ‘Well, what 
you’re doing is that something bad happened, and you’re goin’ back 
there, thinkin’ you can make it right again. Something went wrong, and 
you keep going back to see if you can fix it, or somehow make it right.’
 And I sat there and I said, ‘That is what I’m doing.’ And he said, 
‘Well, you can’t.’”<br>
<br>
5. The Childhood Buddy Story (As related by New Jersey native Steve 
Eitelberg and reported via Philadelphia Inquirer Staff Writer Daniel 
Rubin on September 9, 1999): “The tale that most shows Springsteen’s 
soul resides with Steve Eitelberg, who owns a clothing store in Deal and
 who has known [Bruce] since he was a shy teenager who couldn’t even 
make eye contact.<br>
<br>
Two and half years ago, Steve Eitelberg’s wife, Lynn, was dying of lung 
cancer. One morning at the Monmouth County Medical Center, a nurse told 
him ‘Someone on the phone says he’s Bruce Springsteen.’ Springsteen 
asked if he could visit. He stayed the whole afternoon, telling stories,
 singing ‘Secret Garden’ – her favorite song – just stroking her arm.<br>
<br>
The next afternoon ‘There he was again in the doorway,’ says Eitelberg, 
53, over an extra-large cheese pizza in Neptune. Springsteen settled in 
and started doodling a stick-figure portrait of his family. ‘This is 
Bruce, this is me. Let’s put notes here, because I’m Bruce. Let’s put 
the kids here.’<br>
<br>
Lynn motioned. ‘Oh, you want me to sign it. You want it to be worth 50 cents.’<br>
<br>
He returned on a third day, with his guitar, but by then she had sunk 
into a coma. ‘He showed up at her funeral and sang ‘Secret Garden’ over 
her casket for me and my kids,’ Eitelberg says.<br>
<br>
Since then, on the same day each year, Springsteen has walked into 
Eitelberg’s shop, and they’ve polished off a few bottles. Last year, 
Springsteen noticed a set of congas that Eitelberg’s therapist 
encouraged him to take up after his wife’s death.<br>
<br>
‘You’re gonna play drums in my band,’ Springsteen told him. When he came
 to pick up clothes for the European leg of the tour in April, he walked
 into Eitelberg’s office and asked, ‘You been practicing?’<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Eitelberg made his musical debut on August 9th before 20,000 people at 
the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford. Calling ‘my 
haberdasher’ to the stage, Springsteen had him join the band for ‘Spirit
 in the Night,’ a song nearly as old as their friendship.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
6. The OTHER Bomb Scare Story (As related by me, shortly after a 
Clarence Clemons concert at The Stone Pony on Sunday of Labor Day 
Weekend, 2001):“Clemons was nearly 90 minutes into his set when he first
 stepped to the fore, insisting there was a ‘situation,’ and it would 
require every fan in attendance to exit through the back fence area, 
where they would await further instruction. Within minutes, word spread 
that someone had called in a bomb threat, and when officials arrived on 
the scene with an array of bomb-sniffing K-9s, those rumors were all but
 confirmed.<br>
<br>
And so we waited, for 15 grueling minutes a capacity crowd of 300+ fans 
just stood there and waited, stalwart die-hards leaning up against wood 
barriers as if they meant to storm the kingdom. When at last the gates 
were lifted, there was a blitzkrieg the likes of which you only see in 
rugby matches. Fans went surging for the bottleneck, arms flailing, 
elbows lifting, grown women checking men into the sides of idling 
vehicles. And for what? The opportunity to pack themselves like lemmings
 near the stage?<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the shame of it was that none of this – or, at the very best,
 a very negligible percentage – had anything to do with Clarence 
Clemons. It had everything to do with the fact that Springsteen was now 
rumored to be waiting in the wings, much like he had been the previous 
evening. Early on during the concert, a nearby fan spotted Springsteen’s
 guitar tech hanging out back by the sound board. A half-hour later, 
another fan confirmed the on-stage set list included a sprawling 10-song
 encore, leaning heavily toward more E Street Band material. At the same
 time, on the far right-hand side of the stage, all eyes were on a tiny 
opening between the backstage curtains. Someone claimed that Bruce was 
back there, pacing to and fro in denim jeans.<br>
<br>
In the end there would not be any Bruce Springsteen on that evening, at 
least not near the limelight. The prevailing wisdom was that Springsteen
 was, in fact, on-hand during the show. And what’s more, he had every 
intention of taking the stage during the encores. Only when the bomb 
scare got called in, Springsteen almost immediately made for the exit.<br>
<br>
Later on, as Clemons’ encore drew fast to a close – countless holdouts 
surging forward in immense anticipation – the general mood began to 
sour. People were drunk, after all, and miserable, several of them 
claiming it was a “real sell-out maneuver” for Bruce to rush out of the 
venue like he did. I overheard all this while drinking whiskey at the 
tiki bar, all the while wondering what a situation like that must feel 
like for Bruce Springsteen. The dilemma of agreeing to show up and 
support a friend near your hometown, this despite the fact you know your
 very presence might eclipse that friend’s performance. The unspoken 
fear you might be the reason why his shows sold out so quickly. And what
 of that whole bomb threat? Could that have been some jilted fan? A 
small rival promoter? Some underage rapscallion who couldn’t get into 
the venue? Could it have been some ne’er-do-well who might have seen 
Bruce in the building? Someone toward the rear who got piss drunk before
 assuming he might divert his way up front? <br>
<br>
I mean, what does a situation like that do to a guy like Springsteen’s 
psyche, knowing there’s no real way that he can win? That heading over 
to a local bar to jam with his good friend might also mean he’s stealing
 that good buddy’s spotlight? How heavy must it weigh on Springsteen’s 
head, the split-second decision to skip out rather than stay? I mean, 
Springsteen’s played his way through larger bomb scares, yes? So it 
might be kind of inconsistent to assume that he’d go running for the 
hills, what with Clarence up against it. <br>
<br>
Anyway, the point being, there have got to be a thousand different 
angles to consider once you achieve a certain status. And last Sunday 
night in Asbury, I kind of found myself at odds with the entire bullshit
 vibe. Then again, the only reason I’d originally agreed to drive all 
the way up there was that I thought I might have an opportunity to see 
someone whose name wasn’t even on the ticket. My hypocrisy, it would 
seem, ran just as murky as the others’.”<br>
<br>
<br>
(Editor’s Note: Following the publication of this post, Stan Goldstein 
of The Star Ledger wrote to clarify, “Springsteen was not at the Stone 
Pony on Sept. 2, 2001. He was never there, he never ran out on Clarence 
when the bomb scare happened. I worked security that night and was in 
the backstage area. People were all in anticipation that Bruce would be 
there. Yes, [Springsteen guitar tech] Kevin Buell was there. 
[Springsteen bodyguard] Terry Magovern was there too. But Bruce was not 
there. The rumors were going strong, yes, there were some songs on the 
set list (I saw it). But despite all the ‘sightings,’  [Bruce] was not 
there.”)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
7. The ‘Ain’t Got You’ Story (As related by Steven Van Zandt and 
reported by the New Yorker‘s David Remnick on July 30, 2012): “In the 
late eighties, Springsteen played ‘Ain’t Got You,’ which appeared on his
 album Tunnel of Love, for Steven Van Zandt. The lyrics tell of a fellow
 who gets ‘paid a king’s ransom for doin’ what comes naturally’  – who’s
 got ‘the fortunes of heaven’ and a ‘house full of Rembrandt and 
priceless art’ – but lacks the affections of his beloved. Van Zandt 
recognized the self-mockery but didn’t care. He was aghast.<br>
<br>
‘We had one of our biggest fights of our lives,’ Van Zandt recalled. 
‘I’m, like, ‘What the fuck is this?’ And he’s, like, ‘Well, what do you 
mean, it’s the truth. It’s just who I am, it’s my life.’ And I’m, like, 
‘This is bullshit. People don’t need you talking about your life. Nobody
 gives a shit about yourlife. They need you for their lives. That’s your
 thing. Giving some logic and reason and sympathy and passion to this 
cold, fragmented, confusing world – that’s your gift. Explaining their 
lives to them. Their lives, not yours.’ And we fought and fought and 
fought and fought. He says ‘Fuck you,’ I say ‘Fuck you.’ I think 
something in what I said probably resonated.’”</div>

  Max Weinberg Has Best of Both Worlds .<br>
January 28, 1999<br>
The Associated Press By DAVID BAUDER NEW YORK (AP) -- </strong><br>
<br>
The sound cut through one wall, across a hallway and through another 
wall to the backstage dressing room where Max Weinberg talked. There 
were horns, guitars and -- making him a little nervous -- the drums. 
``My replacement is sitting in this week,'' the leader of the Max 
Weinberg 7 explained, after pausing to listen. ``No,'' he said, catching
 himself. ``He's not my replacement. He's my sub. He's very well aware 
of that.'' This leave of absence idea takes some getting used to. The 
bandleader for ``Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' will be absent for 
about six months starting in March. He's becoming ``Mighty Max'' again, 
the drummer for Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band and will travel the 
world with the year's most anticipated rock concert tour before 
returning to TV at the end of summer. Let's see: one person, two dream 
jobs. Weinberg is grateful he wasn't forced to make a choice. When 
Springsteen announced in January that he would tour with the E Street 
Band for the first time in 11 years, Weinberg approached O'Brien and 
producer Jeff Ross. Was there any way he could do this? He wasn't about 
to quit. No way. O'Brien's show had given the 48-year-old what few faded
 rock 'n' rollers ever get -- a second act in life. He'd never missed a 
Conan show -- 1,048 in a row -- even arranging to appear by satellite 
from Los Angeles when Springsteen asked him to drum on the Academy 
Awards. After a shaky start, ``Late Night'' has hit its stride with the 
audience and critics. It's a great gig. If NBC had said no, Springsteen 
would be looking for another drummer. ``I love Bruce, the guys in the 
band,'' Weinberg said. ``I love the history and the music. But the last 5
 1/2 years have really proved to me that I moved on.'' O'Brien and Ross 
gave him the chance to move back. They recognized the importance of this
 reunion to Weinberg and to rock history and felt the show was on solid 
footing to weather the change. Guitarist Jimmy Vivino will fill in as 
bandleader. Weinberg is in rehearsals with Springsteen. Weinberg said 
he's returning to the road as much for his 11-year-old daughter and 
8-year-old son as for himself. Dad spent 15 years with the E Street 
Band, but his children have never seen them perform. So they'll take 
time off from school to follow their parents on tour. ``I really want my
 children to see me in this sort of mythical situation that I was in 
that was pretty much over by the time they came around,'' he said. 
Weinberg has a keen memory for dates, and here's one he'll never forget:
 Oct. 18, 1988. That was the day Springsteen called to say he wanted to 
try some new things and didn't need the band anymore. There were 
inklings. Weinberg was convinced at the end of the ``Born in the USA'' 
tour in 1985 that the band had played its last show; they had worked 
hard for more than a decade and conquered the world. What more was there
 to do? Springsteen called the band back for two more, shorter runs but 
when Weinberg saw the billing, ``Bruce Springsteen's Tunnel of Love 
Express featuring the E Street Band,'' he knew the end was near. 
Featuring? But even if you're in a bad marriage, it's still a shock to 
be handed divorce papers.<br>
`It was at the same time the most horrifying experience I've ever been 
through and the most liberating,'' he said. ``It was a tremendous period
 of personal growth. It was the first time in my life that I had been 
out of a band. It was the first time that I had been given walking 
papers. Plus, I had a family to support.'' Weinberg went to Seton Hall, 
the New Jersey college, earned a degree in communications. He briefly 
tried law school. He even turned to a buddy, ex- Beatle Ringo Starr, for
 advice on how to cope when the band you've made your life has broken 
up. Springsteen urged him to keep drumming, but Weinberg had given it up
 by the day four years later when he spotted Conan O'Brien on a 
Manhattan street corner and introduced himself. It was a fluke, just 
like when he answered an ad in the Village Voice and wound up in the E 
Street Band. O'Brien had just been selected to replace David Letterman 
when he left for CBS. He wanted something musically that no one else was
 doing and liked Weinberg's idea for a neo-swing band. The drummer 
auditioned and got the job. About three-quarters of the mail Weinberg 
gets these days is about O'Brien's show, not the E Street Band. He 
suspects many young fans don't know his past life. A year ago, a 
14-year-old aspiring drummer sent a letter about how he loved to watch 
Weinberg drum. He wasn't getting along with his father and found it odd 
that he could relate to someone his father's age on TV. One night his 
father confronted him about staying up late. The boy talked about how he
 liked to watch O'Brien's drummer, Max Weinberg. That's funny, the dad 
said, Bruce Springsteen used to have a drummer with that name. He looked
 at the screen and recognized Weinberg behind the kit. So on a Friday 
night, father and son stayed up to watch Weinberg, Dad talking about all
 the Springsteen concerts he saw in the 1970s. Some of the ice was 
broken. ``My first thought when I realized that I would be doing this 
tour with the E Street Band was that I hope this guy takes his son to 
this concert,'' Weinberg said. ``I think a lot of that's going to 
happen.'</div>

By JOE QUEENAN<br>
Published: June 20, 2004<br>
THE NEW YORK TIMES</strong><br>
<br>
ON his dyspeptic 1983 album, ''Trouble in Paradise,'' Randy Newman 
recorded a song in which Bruce Springsteen confesses that he is tired of
 being ''the Boss.'' So he asks Mr. Newman, that sardonic 
singer-songwriter, if he would briefly fill in as America's most beloved
 working-class hero. This is one of the few instances in pop-cultural 
history where anyone dared to poke fun at the sanctified Mr. 
Springsteen, where anyone had the nerve to take the mickey out of the 
Boss and his studiously manicured image as the poet of the proles.<br>
<br>
Recording ''My Life Is Good'' was the kind of jaundiced, disrespectful 
gesture that has long made Mr. Newman an outcast at life's rich feast. 
Making fun of the Boss was like snickering during a Holy Communion 
service, like plopping down on a whoopee cushion during a State of the 
Union address. Was Mr. Newman not aware that ridiculing Bruce Almighty, 
at least in the minds of white baby boomers, was like sneering at Mom, 
apple pie and the American flag? Was Mr. Newman not aware that lines 
like ''At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines'' 
rivaled T.S. Eliot and William Carlos Williams for symbolic nuance and 
verbal ingenuity? Was Mr. Newman not aware that yea, verily, Mr. 
Springsteen sat at the right hand of the Father? What was wrong with 
this guy?<br>
<br>
These thoughts are occasioned by ''Springsteen: Troubadour of the 
Highway,'' a very serious, very portentous, generally yuck-free 
exhibition that pays homage to New Jersey's beloved poet laureate. The 
traveling exhibit is now at the Newark Museum through Aug. 29, and 
includes videos, memorabilia and more than 70 photographs by artists as 
varied as Annie Leibovitz, Frank Stefanko and David Rose; 41 of the 
photos are by Mr. Springsteen's kid sister Pamela.<br>
<br>
Promotional materials on the museum's Web site (<a href="http://www.newarkmuseum.org/" class="postlink">www.newarkmuseum.org</a>)
 say the show ''explores Springsteen's use of cars and highways as 
motifs in his music and in related visual imagery'' in much the same way
 that Raphael once used religious iconography in his work. The publicity
 materials continue: ''From his songs 'Thunder Road' to 'The Ghost of 
Tom Joad,' and at every point along the way, Bruce Springsteen has 
employed images of cars and the highway as central features of his 
music. His restless characters are on the move, sometimes on the hustle 
and often on the run. Speeding off the edge of town, down the Jersey 
Turnpike, or across the desert, their physical movement matches their 
psychic and spiritual searches. His images work as metaphors for 
Springsteen's meditations on both the promise and disappointments of 
America.''<br>
<br>
Oddly, the museum does not mention that Mr. Springsteen's father was a 
bus driver, which may explain the singer's metaphorical obsession with 
vehicles that can attain prodigious speeds without the encumbrance of 
making frequent stops, as this would impede his characters' psychic and 
spiritual searches. Nor does it mention that you kind of need a car to 
get around in suburban New Jersey, as public transportation is at a 
premium, further illuminating the Boss's fixation on automobiles. But 
that is the subject for another show, perhaps one with even more photos 
by his sister.<br>
<br>
Many of the exhibit's photographs are widely known, like ''Asbury Park''
 by Ms. Leibovitz and ''Corvette, Winter'' by Mr. Stefanko. But Ms. 
Springsteen's lesser-known images are a byproduct of the 1995 release of
 ''The Ghost of Tom Joad.'' This was the lugubrious, commercially 
unsuccessful record inspired by Steinbeck's ''Grapes of Wrath''; when 
Mr. Springsteen sings material from this album in concert, the audience 
generally nods off or takes a bathroom break.<br>
<br>
This is where it might be advisable to bring Randy Newman back into the 
conversation. As a super-hunky (check out those forearms) Mr. 
Springsteen vogues down the ribbon of highway in his sister's photos, it
 is difficult for those of a Newmanian frame of mind to suppress a 
chuckle. Thirty years after he attained immense fame and fortune and 
bade farewell to down-at-the-heels Freehold forever, Mr. Springsteen is 
still working his Everydude act for all it is worth. The working-class 
hero who dumped the band that helped make him famous, moved to the West 
Coast and married a model, and then took up residence in tony Rumson, 
where he became bosom buddies with the late risk arbitrageur John A. 
Mulheren, who was once arrested on suspicion of plotting to kill Ivan 
Boesky, is still getting gussied up as a forlorn migrant worker who 
dreams of one day living on that mansion on the hill. This is 
inadvisable. As John Steinbeck might put it: ''Bruce: I knew Tom Joad. I
 created Tom Joad. And, Bruce, you are no Tom Joad. Tom Joad didn't pump
 iron with risk arbitrageurs.''<br>
<br>
Inadvertently, ''Troubadour of the Highway'' captures the cognitive 
dissonance that characterizes the Springsteen experience. ''Born in the 
U.S.A.,'' one of the Boss's catchiest anthems, is actually an 
anti-American diatribe deploring this nation's ill-starred endeavor in 
Southeast Asia. But nobody pays attention to the lyrics; even 
Republicans love it. ''My Hometown'' laments the closing of factories, 
even though risk arbitrageurs like John Mulheren are precisely the kinds
 of people who help get factories closed. A typical Springsteen concert 
contains several paeans to working stiffs, but the audience for these 
songs is largely affluent baby boomers and party-animal frat boys. 
Unlike Pete Seeger and Billy Bragg, who sing left-wing songs for a 
left-wing audience, Mr. Springsteen sings quasi-left-wing songs for an 
audience that really only came to hear ''Rosalita.'' This is not an 
indictment; it is a fact.<br>
<br>
This is not to accuse Mr. Springsteen of being a fake, but merely to 
indicate that popular culture thrives on some sort of healthy hypocrisy.
 It is a safety valve of sorts that lets the prosperous middle class 
walk on the wild side. How many people shelling out $57 to see Mr. 
Springsteen at the Meadowlands last year have ever been anywhere near 
the Badlands? How many teenagers from Totowa have ever been within 15 
miles of the darkness at the edge of town? At a certain point, most 
adults -- and all suburbanites -- realize that they cannot live rock 'n'
 roll lives, so they accept the nearest substitute: a rock 'n' roll 
attitude. They live tough, edgy lives, vicariously, through singers who 
live tough, edgy lives, vicariously. Let's face it: Who would listen to a
 bunch of songs about people torn between buying a Lexus and a Saab?<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen's music, strangely, has spawned precious few imitators 
and almost no progeny. It's the musical equivalent of a Ronald Reagan 
stump speech: peppy, assertive, highly anecdotal, occasionally 
censorious, fiercely obvious. Whatever he started out to accomplish as a
 youth, when he first emerged as a poor man's Bob Dylan, Mr. Springsteen
 has perfected a thoroughly American sound that is as wholesome and 
reassuring as Lawrence Welk's.<br>
<br>
But in the end, the genius of Bruce Springsteen is that he not only gets
 to sing songs like ''Mansion on the Hill,'' but actually gets to live 
in the Mansion on the Hill. In fact, he gets to live in the Mansion on 
the Hill precisely because he sings about people who do not live in the 
Mansion on the Hill, but who like to buy records about people who would 
like to live in the Mansion in the Hill, but cannot afford it, so they 
live in Secaucus.<br>
<br>
Here, we come to the central dilemma of pop music: How do you write 
about the plight of life's victims when you yourself have been in the 
highest tax bracket since the Ford administration? How do you deplore 
the false promise of the American dream when you are the very 
incarnation of it? Do you take a cue from the Rolling Stones and David 
Bowie and just leave the class warfare stuff alone? Or do you write from
 memory? Springsteen, for whatever the reason, has chosen the latter 
course. He lives in Rumson, but his heart is still in Asbury Park.<br>
<br>
Gazing at Sis's cornball photos of big brother Bruce, one cannot help 
thinking that America probably needs some rigorous guidelines governing 
the donning of the proletarian alter ego. Faux proles should be forced 
to spend a month doing community service in a housing project where they
 could meet some real working-class people. Ex-proles like Mr. 
Springsteen should accept that there is a statute of limitations on the 
migrant-worker shtick.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is a great star, and New Jersey (and the nation) is 
lucky to have him. But exhibitions like ''Troubadour of the Highway'' 
belong in the lobby of the record company (Columbia Records/Sony Music) 
that helped underwrite this exhibit, not in an art museum. Art museums, 
like it or not, are for serious people, not rock stars who like to get 
dolled up as migrant workers, the way Marie Antoinette and her frivolous
 entourage use to frolic as shepherdesses.<br>
<br>
It is probably true that the highways are jammed with broken heroes on a
 last chance power drive. But there's no reason museums should be jammed
 with them.</div>

COUNTER PUNCH<br>
Into the Archives, Back From the Abyss<br>
Springsteen’s "Promise" and the Price You Pay<br>
by HARRY BROWNE</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
"Remember," says Bruce Springsteen to a bandmate, "there’s always room to throw out.”<br>
<br>
The black-and-white footage shows an astonishingly beautiful young 
Springsteen in the studio,  some time late in 1977 or early in 1978. He 
is, it appears, slowly driving his fellow musicians crazy with his 
capacity to write new songs, record them, then toss them away. The album
 that will finally be born in June 1978 is Darkness on the Edge of Town,
 and its gestation appears to be a process of elimination as much as of 
creation.<br>
<br>
Even when it comes to the songs that he plans to keep, Springsteen — 
whose three previous albums swelled with lyrical and musical excess — 
seems intent on stripping them of anything resembling ornamentation.<br>
<br>
"Roy, you playin’ any fills?" he asks his piano player, Roy Bittan. 
Before Bittan can reply, Springtsteen adds: "If so, they’re out." His 
tone is mock-Bossy, with a hint of mincing, and he gets a laugh — but he
 is clearly serious.<br>
<br>
These unusual images of a musician at work with his band were filmed by a
 friend of Springsteen’s, Barry Rebo, who was allowed to bring a camera 
into rehearsals and recording sessions. They appear in Thom Zimny’s new 
film, The Promise: The Making of Darkness on the Edge of Town — which 
along with other home-movie clips and live-concert footage fills no 
fewer than three DVDs in the extraordinary new box-set (three CDs! three
 DVDs!) of similar name. Extraordinary and pricy: here in Dublin it set 
me back €100 ($137) when it went on sale last Friday.<br>
<br>
For the fans who can afford it, this set evokes a lyric from Darkness: 
"… if dreams came true, oh, wouldn’t that be nice." The album holds a 
special place in our affections, partly because of the troubled process 
that produced it, but also precisely because of what it lacks: the hype 
of Born to Run, the mega-popularity of Born in the USA or the scattergun
 electicism of The River; Darkness is the pure stuff, unadulterated 
Springsteen arguably at his creative peak. In my own New Jersey 
adolescence it was the first record, by anyone, that I fully inhabited, 
and I’ve heard of a few adolescences, from Detroit to Roscommon to Pisa,
 in which it played a similar role.<br>
<br>
As Springsteen describes it in the recent interview that anchors Zimny’s
 film, Darkness was a "tone poem", with "power, directness and 
austerity" as its goals. The documentary relates Springsteen’s crazed 
pursuit of a relentless drum sound — "Stick!" he would shout, as he 
claimed he was hearing the drum-stick rather than the primal crack-boom 
of Max Weinberg’s drums. He got what he wanted to a great extent, which 
is just as well when so many songs on the album are so stripped down 
that the "melody" consists of little more than whatever note Gary 
Tallent’s bass intones whenever the bass drum sounds.<br>
<br>
CD copies of Darkness have never, to my ear, captured those scarifying 
drums the way my original 1978 vinyl copy still does, and so over the 
years I’ve tended to revisit Darkness only on a turntable. Happily 
there’s a remastered CD included in the box-set that will remedy that 
situation: it has, at last, the big bang of the vinyl. Now I can 
preserve what’s left of the crackling LP, which I played endless that 
summer of 1978, and get back to something resembling the purity of 
Springsteen’s dark essence.<br>
<br>
But with all that stripping clean and throwing away he was doing in 
1977-78, what was left out? And anyway, why in God’s name was Bruce 
Springsteen only just getting into the studio two years after being the 
magazine-cover face of record-industry hype with the release of Born to 
Run in 1975? The answers to these questions go to the heart not only of 
the significance of this autumn’s "new" release, but also of the special
 place that Springsteen holds in the history of the business, as opposed
 (?) to the art, of rock ‘n’ roll.<br>
<br>
For most of the gap between Born to Run and Darkness, Springsteen was 
hamstrung by a lawsuit with his former manager that kept him out of the 
studio. Although the suit was over quicker than, say, Muhammad Ali’s ban
 from boxing eight years earlier, and had none of its political meaning,
 it has taken on some of the same weighty significance for some 
Springsteen fans. We revel in his comeback from adversity, his defiance 
of The Man — but we still wonder what might have been, if he hadn’t been
 kept out of the ring in his absolute mid-to-late-20s prime.<br>
<br>
The Promise, tantalisingly, purports to give an answer, in the form of a
 double-CD of 21 songs, also available separate from the big box-set — 
Springsteen’s "lost album", the one he says "could have/should have been
 released" in those gap years.  Just to cement the confusion, the 
separate release is also called The Promise, with a different mouthful 
for a subtitle.<br>
<br>
Now, Springsteen is hardly the only big old star to root through the 
archives/rejects for stocking-fillers. But The Promise is both more 
ambitious and more phony than the competition: Bob Dylan’s Bootleg 
Series continues this year with wonderful, sometimes messy early-Sixties
 demos; Neil Young’s obsessive-compulsive Archives has made the most of 
the vast multimedia storage, online connectivity and high-resolution of 
Blu-Ray;  God and Sony know what Michael Jackson’s "new" album will be 
like. But it’s only Springsteen and his PR machine who are playing "Back
 to the Future", magically trying to re-create the missing 1977 
Springsteen release: the vaults were full of unfinished works, so on the
 two-disc Promise about half the songs (the credits are maddeningly 
imprecise) are substantially revised, with vocals, instruments, even 
lyrics that weren’t there at the time.<br>
<br>
In the liner notes he writes, absurdly: "I did what I would’ve done to 
them at the time and no more." Not even "what I think I would’ve done". 
No, 61-year-old Bruce knows 27-year-old Bruce so well he can reproduce 
exactly what his younger self "would’ve done".<br>
<br>
There is perhaps something endearing about Springsteen’s insistence that
 mere archives aren’t good enough, that he needed to tamper with, or 
even completely remake, his old recordings to make them worth releasing 
as a real 2010 album. The die-hard fans have, after all, heard many of 
the unaltered outtakes on various bootlegs down through the years. And 
maybe the blue-collar troubadour doesn’t want his shelf to look as 
preciously library-like as those of Dylan and Young.<br>
<br>
Whatever the reason, the absurd claim that is this is somehow the "lost 
album" is demolished utterly when we recall that a handful of the best 
"rejects" from this period turned up on The River (1980) and several 
more appeared in 1998, on the four-CD Tracks box — those songs are not 
repeated here.<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, the two discs of The Promise comprise a good old/new 
Springsteen album. From the opening piano and harmonica of "Racing in 
the Streets (78)" –  much like the song on Darkness itself, but in a 
slightly less monotonic voice and less fatalistic key, with beautiful 
fiddle — to the lament of the title track, it sounds at times like a 
more deliberate successor/response to Born to Run, and especially to its
 great romantic epic "Thunder Road", than Darkness itself does. <br>
<br>
But it sounds like a lot of other things too. Its songs are more 
conventional than most of those on Darkness, but like Darkness it is 
shot through with anxiety; this time it’s mostly romantic, but often 
material too. These are the songs of a man who was worried about money —
 which surely makes them an especially apt 2010 release, if a rather 
ironic one given their price. These days Bruce isn’t so worried: in 
concerts, when he gets to the climax of "Darkness on the Edge of Town", 
Springsteen changes a lyric, "I lost my money and I lost my wife", to "I
 lost my faith and I lost my wife."<br>
<br>
However, in 1976-78 he had every reason to be worried: his manager, Mike
 Appel, had held back on a half-millilon dollar check from the record 
company, with the apparent intention of  bringing Bruce around to his 
contractual way of thinking, and legal battle was joined early in 1976, 
with Springsteen essentially seeking to void his professional 
relationship with Appel. In the documentary (which, by the way, gives 
the charming Appel a fair if uncontentious hearing) 21st-century Bruce 
insists: "It wasn’t" — the word barely gets to an unconvincing final t, 
even by the low standards of New Jersey diction — "a lawsuit about 
money. It was a lawsuit about control." But ten minutes later in the 
film he’s acknowledging his precarious financial position by the time 
the suit was resolved — to his long-term but not short-term financial 
benefit: "If I’d a had that one success [Born to Run] I’d a went back to
 Asbury Park millions of dollars in debt rather than the other way 
around." The unusually fractured, arseways syntax from the 
carefully-spoken Springsteen may indicate just how painful the thought 
remains.<br>
<br>
Later again, talking through the words of "The Promised Land", he 
explains the lyric "Sometimes I feel so weak I just want to explode" in 
terms of his inability at the time to "look after" the E Street Band, by
 which he clearly means, well, money. As recording engineer Jimmy Iovine
 puts it bluntly: "We were all broke."<br>
<br>
This sense of the real meaning of money, and the danger of lacking it, 
though it may have be the consequence of a rather high-class legal 
dispute, is no small matter in the progress of his career. Darkness 
underlined more powerfully than any of its predecessors the class 
orientation of Springsteen’s art, even if its unmistakable mood of 
individualism and moralism raise questions about his class politics that
 have never been completely answered. His key characters here are not 
merely working-class; they are precariously proletarian. The bitter 
distinction between have-nots and have-even-lesses has rarely been 
captured better than in the line from the title song: "Now I hear she’s 
got a house up in Fairview/ And a style she’s trying to maintain."<br>
<br>
The two "new" CDs of The Promise, seen together with Darkness, seem to 
contain more references to money, price, cost and status than anything 
in the rock-era canon outside Marvin Gaye’s What’s Going On. And that’s 
far from the only thing it has in common with the best of soul music. 
Springsteen, who has never had much of a black audience, had nonetheless
 already been pursuing black idioms, and for a time in 1974 the E Street
 Band had three African-American members. But the soulful music on his 
first three albums seemed somehow to have been filtered through the 
sensibilities of Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and Phil Spector, respectively.
 On The Promise there’s a more direct line to the likes of Otis Redding 
and the Drifters; the white mediators, such as they are, are the 
somewhat less self-consciously artful sort: Buddy Holly, say, or the 
Righteous Brothers. "Ain’t Good Enough for You" is stuck catchily in my 
head like something from Martha and the Vandellas, and it could be Ray 
Charles rather than Springsteen who sings smuttily in "City of Night": 
“i got a cute little baby down at 12th and Vine/And she opens for 
business ’round about closin’ time." The extent to which he eventually 
decided to steer Darkness away from black musical roots is evident in 
the film, when he discusses his desire to minimise Clarence Clemon’s 
saxophone on the album, because he thought of it as "an urban 
instrument". One could be forgiven for hearing the word "urban" as a 
euphemism.<br>
<br>
Guitarist "Miami" Steve Van Zandt suggests in the film that Springsteen 
could have been known as one of the great pop songwriters if he hadn’t 
kept throwing out the catchy tracks. The thesis will no doubt get an 
airing in the response to The Promise, but it needs to be assessed with 
some scepticism. It’s true there is some lovely pop here, but it’s not 
the pop of its time: a few tracks sound like they could have been in the
 pop and/or R&amp;B charts in the mid-Sixties – but probably not in the 
late Seventies. In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal 
Springsteen himself refers to some of his tendencies in this period as 
being a sort of genre revivalism, "neo-soul".<br>
<br>
History gives us something better than a thought experiment when it 
comes to Springsteen’s pop capacities. While he was paring down Darkness
 to a tone poem, he was in fact letting some of his "pop" songs leak out
 to other performers. Several of them went to his Jersey-shore pals, 
Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes. The Jukes were  wonderful  — 
their live shows provide some of my warmest memories of the late 1970s —
 but the highlight of their set was a Sam Cooke medley, i.e. 15-year-old
 songs with a 15-year-old sound. Even with songs like Springsteen’s 
“Talk to Me” (itself one of the highlights of The Promise, the singer 
crying repeatedly to his lost love “I got a full week’s pay!” over a 
Stax-like horn section) they made little impact on the charts.<br>
<br>
The two Seventies "hits" that feature in Springsteen’s own versions on 
The Promise don’t do much for Van Zandt’s thesis either. Patti Smith 
reached the top 20 with Springsteen’s "Because the Night" after he 
couldn’t finish it, but that was a straight-ahead rocker. And, you know,
 he couldn’t finish it. The Pointer Sisters’ version of "Fire" did get 
to number 2; but the Sisters were in part something of a novelty act, 
with clothes and harmonies drawn from mid-century pop. They suited the 
(terrific) song perfectly, but it scarcely provides evidence of 
Springsteen’s contemporary pop sensibility. <br>
<br>
This is no crime: Bob Dylan, among other artists, spent much of the 
Sixties writing great, partly derivative blues songs, when the blues 
were far from the charts. And anyway, in 2010 we’re catholic enough in 
our tastes that we don’t complain about the vintage of our pop stylings:
 this album should do well commercially. But if a lurking part of The 
Promise’s premise is that in the late 1970s Bruce eschewed the 
temptations of first-order commercial success to pursue a line of 
maximum integrity, it’s dubious – not simply because of his rough-edged 
voice, but because his melodic and rhythmic sensibility drew too heavily
 on an earlier period. It is true, however, that no one forced him to 
produce an album quite as dark and unhooky as Darkness. And it’s also 
true that when he relaxed into the Eighties he did show himself capable 
of making some inroads into the singles charts — without ever 
approaching the inventive transcendence of the period’s sublime pop 
artists, Michael Jackson and Prince.<br>
<br>
The years 1977-78, when most of The Promise and indeed Darkness were 
recorded, were about disco, early stirrings of hip-hop, punk and the 
death of Elvis. And of these only Elvis figures prominently on The 
Promise, both as a source of inspiration and with a mention in a lyric. 
(A few years later, disco-diva Donna Summer recorded his searing 
"Protection", but it left barely a trace on radio playlists or the 
charts.)  Springsteen was impressed with the explosion of punk, and 
studio bootlegs from the autumn of 1977 contain New Jersey’s answer to 
the Clash’s “Janie Jones”, a stormer called “Break Out”, but it’s left 
off The Promise.  (So, sadly, are the rockingly Presleyan "Preacher’s 
Daughter" and "Crazy Rocker/It’s All Right".) Punk is more relevant to 
the humourless austerity and power of Darkness than to anything on The 
Promise,which in 21 songs offers an incomplete portrait of the artist as
 he came of age.<br>
<br>
So we’ve got an unproven thesis about Bruce the lost pop genius; a 
rather questionable archive exercise; and a highly listenable 
Springsteen album that melds a part (mainly the black part) of his 
late-Seventies sensibility with the overproduced poppy-nostalgia that 
dominated his weak 2009 album, Working on a Dream. His current Promise 
single, "Save My Love", is a heavily reworked Seventies-Noughties 
concoction that would have fit on that album.<br>
<br>
But the video for that single reminds fans why we care. Shots, old and 
new, of Bruce and his band mix with images of his fans and even of some 
of the bootleg LPs that helped us fill in those old gaps between albums.
 In this era of industry paranoia about piracy, the video reminds us how
 the pirates of yore gave us Springsteen’s music when the industry 
couldn’t oblige. Bruce gets it. (Even while I was writing about the new 
release last week for an Irish newspaper, the pirates were more 
efficient than Sony at giving me a sneak peak.)<br>
<br>
Then there’s the “Notebook” that comes in the box-set, a spiral-bound 
facsimile containing many pages of Springsteen’s own scribblings from 
the time. (If you’re about my age and provenance, you will honest-to-god
 keep mistaking it for something that has somehow surfaced from a 
long-forgotten box in the basement.)  Sure, it’s probably almost as 
“inauthentic” as many of the songs on the album, but who cares? Look 
here, where it says the album was at one point called The Story of 
Frankie and Sonny and the Darkness on the Edge of Town! And here, where 
he makes a note to himself to give two songs to the Jukes! And look at 
these lyrics that didn’t turn up on record until the Eighties! How many 
verses did he write for "Badlands" anyway?!<br>
<br>
The box-set has other contents that are valuable if something short of 
treasurable. There’s a full 2009 performance of the ten Darkness 
songs,live without an audience, with only the late lamented organist 
Danny Federici missing from the original line-up.  It’s only mildly 
revisionist, with Roy allowed a few fills and Bruce sparing his larynx 
the scraping he gave it three decades earlier; the few tiny lyric 
changes jump off the screen with their rarity.<br>
<br>
The box’s full-concert video from 1978, in Houston, is a bit 
disappointing: it’s shot dully on video — with occasional quickfire 
outbursts of horrible Seventies TV-style direction — meaning that it 
compares unfavourably to the film of the E Street Band’s 1975  London 
performance that featured in the Born to Run box-set five years ago, and
 to the marvelously shot and edited footage of five songs in Phoenix in 
1978 that has circulated for years on bootlegs and is also tucked 
elsewhere in this box. Moreover, this Houston show came late in the 1978
 tour and it feels roughly as routine as Springsteen gets: still a great
 rock ‘n’ roll gig, but without the sense of occasion and spontaneity 
that makes those other films so revisit-able.<br>
<br>
Still, to my mind an imperfect document and a merely good album are both
 better than none at all, especially since all the material will quickly
 be available online for fans who can’t or won’t take this as another 
opportunity to contribute generously to the corporate coffers. With this
 release we can see, through the marketing fog and in sudden poignant 
clarity, a crucial, painful moment of transition in one of rock ‘n 
roll’s greatest, most emblematic careers. On the song “The Promise”, 
recorded in 1977, the nearest thing to a song “about” his lawsuit, 
Springsteen manages to configure what he had lost and what he feared 
losing as a sort of heroic sacrifice he had always intended to make: “we
 were gonna take it all and throw it all away.” Well, he didn’t. We 
didn’t. And (to hell with sacrifice!) 33 years later we’re glad he and 
his work – the great, the good, the indifferent — were carried back to 
us from the edge of the business’s abyss.</div>

World Aids Day Concert<br>
Times Square<br>
Dec 1, 2014<br>
Kanye, Springsteen, and Bono-less U2 Were Awesome<br>
By Lindsay Zoladz</strong><br>
<br>
Yesterday afternoon, U2 announced their second big surprise of 2014: In 
honor of World AIDS Day, they would be playing a free show in Times 
Square that very night, Bono-less, with Bruce Springsteen and Chris 
Martin filling in for the injured front man, along with performances 
from special guests Carrie Underwood and Kanye West. I canceled my plans
 instantly. When a few concerned friends asked me why — it was supposed 
to rain, they said, and anyway, the whole thing was going to be 
broadcast live on YouTube — my go-to joke was, “Maybe Kanye will demand 
to do a U2 song, too!” But this was not entirely a joke. The reason you 
go to something at which Kanye West is scheduled to appear is that you 
have no way of actually knowing what the fuck Kanye West is going to do,
 and because you sometimes get cynical about following a supposedly 
impolite and revolutionary art form in which there are fewer and fewer 
artists about whom you can honestly, genuinely say that. Would Kanye 
debut new material? Would he do some sort of rapturously Auto-Tuned 
cover of “One”? Would he be the sole artist brave enough to acknowledge,
 at this well-meaning but sort of whitewashed charity event raising 
money for a disease that disproportionately affects the black community,
 the Michael Brown protests that had been happening earlier that day 
down the street? There was no way of actually knowing the answer to any 
of these questions, which is why a little before 6 p.m. I grabbed my 
umbrella and put on my boots and prepared to stand in cold rain for a 
couple of hours.<br>
I arrived awkwardly early to that section of the city once known as 
Times Square, which I now like to refer to as “Flavortown.” Under the 
shelter of strangers’ umbrellas, I killed time by eavesdropping on 
conversations and attempting to read the text messages people were 
sending around me. I tuned into an adjacent conversation just as a guy 
was saying to a female companion, “I wonder what Terence Trent D’Arby is
 up to these days.” The show was supposed to start promptly at 7:30, and
 it was still somehow only 7:12, which means I was bored enough for this
 to become an existential question I lingered on for a good five 
minutes. What is Terence Trent D’Arby up to these days?<br>
Then, at 7:30 on the dot, the umbrellas kindly disappeared, hoods went 
up, and a woman from Bank of America took the stage. Because she had a 
cropped blonde haircut and an assertively hued, expensive-looking 
peacoat, some smartass in the front row screamed, “HILLARY CLINTON,” 
which became delightfully awkward only seconds later, when the woman 
welcomed the night’s secret guest-speaker, Bill Clinton.<br>
Bubba introduced us to night’s first iteration of what the guys were 
cheekily calling “U2 Minus 1,” though in retrospect, the Chris 
Martin–fronted performance felt more like the opening act for Bruce2. 
The Coldplay front man sang “Beautiful Day,” which makes all kinds of 
cosmic sense — this is basically already a Coldplay song. Although 
Martin sang it ably and at times even borderline passionately, the whole
 thing had the unmistakable whiff of karaoke, playing it so studiously 
close to Bono’s rendition that it left little room for Martin’s own 
personality. Not that this is surprising; you don’t really take Chris 
Martin to be the kind of artist who’s going to kill his idols so much as
 invite them over for tea. But some kind of risk or two would have been 
appreciated, especially when he moved onto “With or Without You,” a song
 he failed to fully emotionally inhabit. It didn’t come anywhere close 
to the gut-punch of the original, and anyway, the Edge’s backing vocals 
were doing most of the heavy lifting during the famously wrenching 
“WHOA-OH-OH-OHHH” bridge. All in all, Martin’s ten minutes fronting U2 
were neither disastrous nor particularly memorable.<br>
Kanye’s set, though, I’ll remember. After Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen 
Jr. introduced him as “the most groundbreaking artist in music today,” 
he strode out, grim-faced, and jolted the place awake with a truncated 
but exhilarating performance of “Power.” I have seen Kanye onstage a 
couple of times now, and every single time, my response is involuntary 
and visceral: My heart starts to beat a little faster and I have trouble
 standing completely still, and I am overwhelmed by this very rare 
feeling that I am genuinely excited to be alive and sort of young while 
this person is hitting an uncompromising creative peak with the entire 
world watching him. One pivotal factor here is that Kanye knows how high
 the stakes are, and he brings an almost menacing awareness of that to 
every performance. Last night, as he hurtled through a career-spanning 
medley of songs like “Jesus Walks,” “Stronger,” and “Black Skinhead,” he
 expressed dissatisfaction mid-performance at how the thing was flowing.
 “That song was supposed to cut,” he said to someone onstage after 
“Stronger.” “Next song, it’s supposed to cut, we on TV.” I know there 
are people out there who will hold this kind of supposed “diva behavior”
 against him, who will cite this as a reason why the performance was a 
failure. I will never understand those people. West’s 
meta-dissatisfaction with the sound gave the performance an urgency and 
even a candidness that heightened the whole experience — it fueled him 
to go that much harder, careening and stumbling around the stage as he 
performed “Black Skinhead” to a mostly white audience. When Kanye goes 
off-script — when he says things like “We on TV” on TV — it’s in the 
service of peeling back the layers of artifice that artists more content
 with the whole celebrity machine are content not to acknowledge. And as
 a viewer hungry for something, anything, I always appreciate it. It’s 
his Truman Show boat hitting the wall. It all might be a little messy, 
sure, but isn’t music supposed to be?<br>
Here is another complicated truth about rock ’n’ roll, or maybe just 
life: Sometimes there is a silver lining of serendipity to a gruesome 
injury. Legend has it that if Brian Eno had not spent a couple months of
 1975 bedridden in a hospital recovering from a car crash, he might 
never have dreamed up ambient music; now we can say that the unexpected 
upside of Bono’s nasty bike accident in Central Park a few weeks ago is 
that we got to hear what it would sound like if Bruce Springsteen 
fronted U2. The answer: like church.<br>
He came out growling, laboring muscularly over every word of “Where the 
Streets Have No Name” like he was chiseling it into stone. It had the 
feeling of a sermon; there was a strange power in the way the coarseness
 of his voice was backlit by the Edge’s glimmering guitar. No, it was 
not the most faithfully melodic version (I would barely call the 
performance “melodic” at all), but thank God. It was one of those 
renditions that makes you think a little differently about a very 
familiar song — cracks it open and forces you to reinspect what’s 
actually inside. I have never really given much thought to the lyric “I 
wanna feel sunlight on my face” until hearing the Boss’s utterly 
menacing line reading, demanding it like a human right. Though a little 
more exuberant, his take on “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For”
 was more of the same: rough, impassioned, half-crazy, never quite 
choosing the safety of the obvious. Messy as a compliment. Lasting just 
two songs, this was perhaps the shortest set Bruce Springsteen has 
played or will ever play in his life, but he brought a controlled, 
hyperfocused intensity to the proceedings. Watching him, I felt that 
same trembling, possessed feeling I experienced during Kanye’s set — and
 I realized for the first time the similarities between all the other 
times I’ve seen Kanye and Bruce live, respectively. There’s bravery in 
their bravado. I left feeling that I’d been in the presence of genius 
not once but twice that night — not bad for a show that lasted under an 
hour.<br>
“That was all great,” an older white man loudly declared as the crowd 
milled out, “But I didn’t care for Kanye at all. That was rough.” 
Everyone is entitled to his opinion (and sometimes in our society, 
everyone is even entitled heropinion!), but something about this man’s 
tone made me bristle so much that I still heard it ringing in my head 
the whole way home. It wasn’t what he said so much as the way he said it
 to his companion, who was also white. That conspiratorial tone of, “I’m
 so certain you agree with me that I won’t even bother asking if you 
agree with me.” The bravest artists are the ones who spit in the face of
 this kind of certainty. The ones who rattle assumptions and turn 
periods into question marks. The ones who give you a soundtrack to those
 rushing, swelling feelings that you can’t quite describe. While I was 
on my way to Times Square, animated by a curiosity about what this weird
 night would even entail, my headphone soundtrack was Born to Run. On 
the ride home, electrified and brooding, I listened to Yeezus.</div>

<br>
ROLLING STONE<br>
BY ANDY GREENE |<br>
 December 1, 2014<br>
</strong><br>
For the thousands of people crammed into the center of Times Square on a
 rainy Monday evening, it must have seemed like a surreal dream inspired
 by a night gorging on junk food, Born to Run and The Joshua Tree. U2's 
the Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. played the familiar opening 
notes of "Where the Streets Have No Name," but Bono was nowhere in 
sight. Instead, out walked Bruce Springsteen in a leather jacket. 
Needless to say, the crowd – which didn't pay a dime for the show or 
have any clue it was even happening until about 2:30 that afternoon – 
went into complete hysterics. <br>
<br>
"I want to run!" he sang with incredible force and confidence. "I want 
to hide. I want to tear down these walls. . ." It was an amazing moment 
at a World AIDS Day (RED) benefit that came together in complete secrecy
 over the past couple of weeks. Originally scheduled as a regular U2 
show meant to follow their planned week-long Jimmy Fallon residency, the
 band had to start working the phones after Bono's devastating Central 
Park bike injury left him unable to perform. Nobody says no to Bono, 
especially an injured Bono, so Chris Martin and Bruce Springsteen agreed
 to front U2 for the evening, joining Kanye West and Carrie Underwood on
 the bill. Despite everything that goes into assembling a free outdoor 
concert in the heart of New York City, word of the gig didn't reach the 
public until U2 announced it on their website about five hours before 
showtime.<br>
<br>
Surprise guest Bill Clinton came out before the music began to give a 
brief speech. "You only have a minute and a half of halfway-serious talk
 and then it's all fun," he said, then read from an e-mail that Bono had
 sent him earlier in the day, drawing cheers with the closing line, 
"We're going to win this fight."<br>
<br>
With that, out walked a group billing themselves as "U2 Minus 1" and 
Martin, who was wearing a black shirt that simply read "Substitute." 
They kicked things off with "Beautiful Day" and the Coldplay frontman 
poured himself into the task, clearly thrilled to be filling the shoes 
of one of his biggest influences. "Dreams come true," he said, "for 
young and old people alike." They wrapped up with a powerful "With or 
Without You," and anyone who closed their eyes could have easily 
believed it was Bono there in Times Square.<br>
<br>
Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. walked offstage as Carrie Underwood's 
crew began bringing out her gear, but the Edge stayed put and strapped 
on a new guitar. He introduced her as the "the reigning queen of 
country" and accompanied the singer and her band on a tender rendition 
of "Change," a song about sending money to needy children overseas. She 
then closed the short set with her anthemic new hit "Something in the 
Water."<br>
<br>
Kanye West followed with an electric medley of "Power," "Jesus Walks," 
"Black Skinhead," "Stronger" and "Touch the Sky." The whole thing took 
just eight minutes and the speakers blasted out stupefyingly loud bass 
that occasionally distorted his vocals, but it hardly mattered. He was 
on fire and easily won over many fans that came out simply to see 
Springsteen and U2.<br>
<br>
Unlike other all-star charity shows that run for hours and hours, this 
one clocked in at a mere 48 minutes. The stage crew was remarkably 
efficient, and the only drawback was the distracting Times Square video 
screens. It was a little incongruous to watch Bill Clinton speak about 
the AIDS crisis while a 100-foot-tall Kate Upton advertised Express 
clothing on a screen that looped through the entire show.<br>
<br>
U2 and Bruce Springsteen could have easily entertained the crowd for an 
hour or two, but their headlining set lasted a mere two songs. "Where 
the Streets Have No Name," which will hopefully enter Springsteen's 
repertoire, was followed by "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking 
For." They'd played this together at two Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 
events, and once again they "took it to church," as Springsteen 
commanded towards the end of the tune. By this point the cold rain was 
pouring down, but hardly anyone started walking towards the subway until
 all the performers came out for a group bow. Now let's all hope that 
Bono heals up quickly so we can see "U2 Minus None" on the road next 
year. ​</div>

An Open Letter to Bruce Springsteen<br>
Huffington Post<br>
12/08/2014 </strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Dear Boss,<br>
<br>
You were magnificent the other night -- performing with U2 for World 
AIDS Day -- and further establishing yourself as the ultimate "guest" 
lead singer/band leader. And congratulations on another productive and 
fulfilling year. You turned 65 and kept your foot on the gas. After 
wrapping up another worldwide tour with the E Street Band in May, you 
released -- an illustrated book (Outlaw Pete), a short film in which you
 directed and acted (Hunter of Invisible Game), a re-mastered box set 
spanning your first 7 albums, more official live downloads, and made 
your acting debut in a TV series (Lilyhammer). You also continued your 
unwavering support for Veterans with honorable performances at Stand-Up 
for Heroes and The Concert for Valor. And to close out last month, you 
lent your hand to another worthwhile cause -- the New Jersey Hall of 
Fame. Thanks for inducting fellow Jersey boy Brian Williams and 
reminding everyone down the shore, everything's all right.<br>
<br>
So, what's next for you my friend? What spark will light the Freehold 
Fireball's fire? With no publicly confirmed plans for 2015, all that's 
out in the street amongst us tramps is abundant speculation. The latest 
report reveals Brad Pitt wants to play you in a biopic. Personally, I 
could use a reason to believe that one. However, if there is some truth 
to that story, give me a call -- I've already written the script. More 
plausible rumors that continue to swirl in the land of hope of dreams 
center on an upcoming River box set, a new solo album and a possible 
spring/summer tour. With regard to the tour, the word from Radio Nowhere
 revolves around a non-E Street incarnation -- be it a trio, or 
something entirely different.<br>
<br>
Seeing you perform live is one of the greatest joys in my life -- well, 
that's not really true. It is the single greatest thing in my life -- 
and I'm pretty sure I'm not alone when I say that. Acclaim for your 
spirited performance on a cold, rainy night in Times Square confirm the 
streets do indeed have a name -- its name is B-R-U-C-E. Whatever you 
decide your next stage adventure shall be, I'll be there. That was not 
always the case.<br>
<br>
My first realistic chance to see you play came in 1992 when you toured 
with the "other band." No offense, but I did not think my introductory 
experience should be Without You and the E Street Band. To me, it was 
sacred- - E Street Band or Nothing At All. It wasn't until the Reunion 
Tour that I caught you for the first time. And I'm honestly glad I 
waited. Like Little Steven stated at the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame 
Induction, "The legend is the band."<br>
<br>
Sure, I've seen you solo (at Stand-up for Heroes and to open some E 
Street shows); I've seen you lead "other" bands (The Seeger Sessions, 
Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers); I've seen you jam with musicians at
 various benefits and guest at many other shows -- I can even recall 
your epic 1993 appearance on Late Night with David Letterman where you 
rocked a rousing "Glory Days" alongside Paul Schaffer and the Late Night
 Orchestra -- all of these performance were awesome. Every time you take
 the stage, it's magical. When you're at the mic, one and one, do 
indeed, make three.<br>
<br>
I also know you're great friend's with Sting -- and maybe his penchant 
for the solo outing rubs off on you more than you care to admit. And 
that's OK. I get it. Artists need the freedom to present themselves, 
however they wish - and if your forthcoming presentation is solo, or 
otherwise, I respect your decision. If you need to play small clubs or 
theaters or in a completely new genre of music -- I'm with you. You can 
do country, folk, jazz, rap, even sing nursery rhymes -- I'll be there. 
I'll follow your dream to the promised land and beyond. But, let me tell
 you my dream.<br>
<br>
My dream begins and ends with the heart-stopping, pants-dropping, 
house-rocking, earth-quaking, booty-shaking, Viagra taking, love-making,
 le-gend-ary E Street Band!<br>
<br>
Be your own opening act. Be a stripped down E Street Band. Be acoustic. 
Be electric. Be in a small, intimate venue, on a street corner or in a 
massive stadium. Just whatever you do, please do it with the E Street 
Band. These guys are your blood brothers, your souls of the departed and
 tougher than the rest. You know "the mighty power of the E Street 
Band." Fuck! -- You coined the phrase! You admitted the band makes you 
"dream in CinemaScope."<br>
<br>
So, Bruce, for us, for the greatest fans in rock and roll, do your hair 
up pretty, and meet us tonight, and night after night, with the band 
that wasn't just born to run; but was built to last. Remember, it was 
your original consigliere, Mr. Van Zandt, and not Sting, who said, "Rock
 and roll, it's a band thing."<br>
<br>
If you're here, and we're here, then they're here.<br>
<br>
With infinite love and loyalty,<br>
Steve Matoren</div>
