ROCK:BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN IN CONCERT<br>
By JOHN ROCKWELL<br>
Published: August 7, 1984<br>
The New York Times</strong><br>
<br>
WITH all the excitement swirling about the Jacksons, let us not forget 
Bruce Springsteen. He did have a No. 1 album this summer, after all, 
with ''Born in the U.S.A.'' And he is playing to more ticket- buyers in 
the New York area than the Jacksons or anyone else has ever done in a 
single engagement - 202,000 of them, to be exact, in 10 long- 
since-sold-out concerts in the Brendan Byrne Arena in the Meadowlands of
 his native New Jersey. The first of those concerts was Sunday night, 
and they continue in pairs, with rest days in between, through Aug. 20.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen and his E Street Band will need the rest. Without an 
opening act, they offer a prodigious four-hour performance, an almost 
unstinting (there is one intermission) outpouring of music, dancing 
energy and heartwarming communal feeling. Mr. Springsteen is, not to put
 too fine a point on it, the best rock-and- roll performer this writer 
has ever seen. At one point Sunday, Mr. Springsteen pulled a teen-age 
girl on stage with him. Through binoculars, one could read her lips: ''I
 love you so much,'' she said, and in that she spoke for the entire 
audience.<br>
<br>
To say Mr. Springsteen is the best rock performer ever is not to say he 
is the best composer, the best singer, the best guitarist or the best 
top-10 singles artist. He has his limitations - of musical invention, of
 audience (there was hardly a black face to be seen Sunday), of social 
impact in a time that distrusts the redemptive power of popular art.<br>
<br>
But for his very perseverance, his proud assertion of the values that 
have made rock music so beloved, Mr. Springsteen deserves our 
admiration. But if that were all there was to it, he would have to rest 
content as a wax dummy in a rock-and-roll museum. What makes him so 
appealing is how he carries on, alive and literally kicking, 
entertaining and instructing us in a way that we can't tell the 
difference between the two.<br>
<br>
The entertainment part is obvious: not just in his ebullient uptempo 
songs, but in his set as a whole Mr. Springsteen gives his people what 
they want. And yet he's made them want more, and better, than they 
usually do today. Unlike so much of the best rock, which evoked a 
rebellious negativism, and so much latter-day rock, which panders to 
what the Soviets call ''hooliganism,'' Mr. Springsteen's projects an 
almost unfailing positive vision. It is a remarkable feat: passion 
without enduring pain; positivism without sacrifice of power.<br>
<br>
The instruction also comes because Mr. Springsteen is such a deep and 
all-encompassing encyclopedia of rock idioms. His historicism can be 
heard most clearly in his encores, when he sings the songs of others - 
Sunday, Tom Waits's ''Jersey Girl,'' his Mitch Ryder medley and ''Twist 
and Shout,'' based on the Beatles' version. But such a love for the past
 suffuses his own composition, as well. Mr. Springsteen's detractors 
complain about his lack of musical invention, but the charge seems 
misplaced. He works within a set of idioms; together they constitute a 
tradition. But he uses those idioms as if it never once occurred to him 
that they might be stale, and in his hands they aren't.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, he was in fine voice Sunday, and the E Street Band (despite
 a sound system that seemed a little overblown and muddy from this 
writer's seat) was in solid form, with Nils Lofgren filling in adeptly 
for the departed Steve Van Zandt. There is also a new backup singer, 
Patti Scialfa, but she had little to do.<br>
<br>
For all his traditionalism, however, there is also a discernible 
evolution in Mr. Springtseen's work. He hardly does anything now from 
his period of the early 1970's, apart from ''Growin' Up'' and 
''Rosalita.'' The self-conscious myth-making and inflated verbosity live
 on in some of his best-loved songs of the mid-70's, however. Those 
songs perhaps overdominated the set selection Sunday, bumping out some 
of his more sombre recent work. But the crowd - his crowd - loved it. To
 hear 20,000 people singing whole songs a cappella, loud and clear, was 
extraordinary.<br>
<br>
Since the mid-70's, Mr. Springsteen has moved into an austere phase, 
telling grim heartfelt stories about people struggling to survive in a 
society indifferent to them. What was interesting about Sunday's show, 
in part, was how all this work sounded of a piece. The acoustic songs on
 his ''Nebraska'' album were fleshed out (sometimes too sweetly, as with
 the overuse of a noxious chime effect from one of the electronic 
keyboards); the synthesized dance-rock textures of ''Born in the 
U.S.A.'' were revealed as superficial overlays of his standard rock 
arrangements.<br>
<br>
For sheer excitement, this writer still prizes Mr. Springsteen's club 
shows of the mid-70's: arenas inevitably rob music of some of its 
impact. But their large scale also becomes a fitting setting for an 
artist of such genuinely popular aspirations.<br>
<br>
This is not ''pop''; not commercial calculation. What makes Mr. 
Springsteen such a satisfying harbinger of the ''rock-and-roll future'' 
is not his anticipation of today's trends - they have grown almost 
foreign to him - but his role as a musician working lovingly within the 
rock tradition to make serious adult art. That's worth cheering about, 
just as much as the spellbinding fervor of his actual performances.</div>

By SARA RIMER, Special to the New York Times<br>
Published: August 19, 1985</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Aug. 18— After 13 months on the road - after 
playing to sellout crowds in Australia, Europe, Japan and cities all 
across America - Bruce Springsteen came home tonight.<br>
<br>
The New Jersey boy who grew up to be the current king of rock-and-roll 
was welcomed back by more than 65,000 of his fans, on their feet in 
Giants Stadium, fists in the air, screaming every word of his first song
 of the evening, ''Born in the U.S.A.''<br>
<br>
''All my people out there!'' he shouted before one number. ''How have things been here in New Jersey?''<br>
<br>
Judging from the crowd's response, things couldn't have been better. 
They belonged to him from the moment he and his E Street band took the 
stage, shortly after 8 P.M., for the first of six concerts here. Until 
about midnight, Giants Stadium was transformed into an enormous outdoor 
dancehall as his fans danced in the aisles, embracing one another every 
time Mr. Springsteen went into an old favorite.<br>
<br>
''Brrruuucccce! Brrruuucccce! Brrrruuucccce!'' they kept screaming. 
Their enthusiasm was shared by the performer. the Garden of Eden, he 
said, had been moved, and now was in New Jersey.<br>
<br>
During the raucous ''Thunder Road,'' Neil Jiorle, 29, of Long Branch, 
N.J, grabbed his wife, Lisa, 25, and spun her up and down the aisle. 
They had gone to hear Bruce Springsteen at honky-tonk bars more than 10 
years ago, long before anyone dreamed he would play Giants Stadium.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen returned to New Jersey an international rock star, an 
American symbol, a favorite of politicians (Governor Kean and Mayor Koch
 both attended tonight's concert) and a married man.<br>
<br>
''But he's still the same old Bruce,'' said 26-year-old Beverly Snow.<br>
<br>
And he still wore the same old bandana headband, blue jeans and T-shirt -
 a uniform repeated on thousands of young men in the crowd - as he 
filled the stadium with his tales of disillusioned factory workers, 
out-of-work Vietnam veterans and madly-in-love young men and women 
driving Jersey roads on hot summer nights.<br>
<br>
Glory Days Were There<br>
<br>
''This is a song about getting old,'' Mr. Springsteen said before 
singing ''Glory Days.'' ''And I'm old. I'm 35. Yeah.'' He was all over 
the stage tonight, dancing up and down the steps, mugging with the 
saxophonist Clarence Clemons and, at one point, falling on his back in 
mock exhaustion. Mr. Springsteen was not old tonight.<br>
<br>
''Glory Days'' is a tale of good times long gone for a former high 
school baseball star. Tonight the glory days were in Giants Stadium.<br>
<br>
At the end of the first set, Mr. Springsteen gave a brief sermon on 
caring for the less fortunate. ''If you say you're from New Jersey,'' he
 said, ''you have a responsibility to your state.''<br>
<br>
He went on to say that the Community Food Bank of New Jersey and the 
Food and Hunger hot line of New York both had representatives in the 
audience and needed support. ''In every state people are going to be 
hungry,'' he said. ''A lot of people are falling though the bottom. They
 ain't getting caught in no safety net. They're hurting and they need 
some help.<br>
<br>
''Remember New York and New Jersey,'' he continued, ''this is your hometown.'' The crowd cheered.<br>
<br>
While there was a smattering of celebrities in the audience - Raquel 
Welch could be seen furiously eating an apple during the first set - 
this was a kind of ''just folks'' crowd, caught up in a spirit that was 
more like a rock-and-roll revival than a 1980's rock concert. Limousines
 and fancy cars were far outnumbered by Chevrolets, vans and pickup 
trucks.<br>
<br>
No Punk or Glitter<br>
<br>
This was blue jeans and cowboy boots, not glitter and punk haircuts. And
 while no one could doubt their enthusiasm, officials praised the fans 
as particularly well behaved.<br>
<br>
Tommy Bartley, a 24-year-old ironworker from Nutley, N.J., was here. So 
was his friend Jimmy Frotton, a 23-year-old bartender from the same 
town. So was John O'Neill, a 21-year-old heating and air-conditioner 
installer from Kearny, N.J. So was his friend, 22-year-old Jim Keim, an 
electrician from Kearny. So was Paul Cardenas, a 21-year-old handyman 
from Queens. And so was Ron Kovic, a paralyzed Vietnam War veteran who 
wrote about his war experiences in the book ''Born on the Fourth of 
July.''<br>
<br>
''I've been sitting in this wheelchair for the past 18 years,'' said Mr.
 Kovic, a friend of the singer. ''And I can only thank Bruce Springsteen
 for all he's done for Vietnam veterans. 'Born in the U.S.A.' is a 
beautiful song that has helped me personally to heal.''<br>
<br>
Among those paying homage to the singer was Jeff McCutchen, 20, who 
drove from Albany with three friends, 15 Springsteen tapes and a map of 
New Jersey. Before the concert they made a pilgrimage through their 
idol's working-class hometown of Freehold, his new town of Rumson as 
well as Asbury Park that Mr. Springsteen immortalized in his first 
album.<br>

				<div class="content">Springsteen's Live/1975-1985' Is Loaded With History<br>
By STEPHEN HOLDEN<br>
Published: November 9, 1986<br>
The New York Times<br>
<br>
<br>
'Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band Live/1975-85'' (Columbia 
40559; LP, cassette, compact disk), a massive five-record retrospective 
album that arrives in stores tomorrow, represents an unprecedented event
 in popular recording. A three-and-a-half-hour, 40-song career summary, 
recorded over a 10-year period in clubs, concert halls and stadiums 
across the United States, it is the sort of anthology one expects to be 
released late in a performer's career, or posthumously.<br>
<br>
Instead, this monumental album, which comes with a 31-page booklet of 
lyrics and photographs, arrives just when the 37-year-old singer and 
composer is at the peak of his popularity and creative powers. Mr. 
Springsteen's last album, ''Born in the U.S.A.,'' has sold more than 11 
million copies in this country. And ''Live/1975-85,'' which costs about 
$25 ($39 for the set of three compact disks), with the price differing 
from store to store, has received advance orders of more than 1.5 
million copies. No other record album has done such a large dollar 
volume of business before its release.<br>
<br>
It has long been said of Mr. Springsteen that he must be seen in concert
 for his music to be fully appreciated. And while ''Live/1975-85'' 
doesn't let us literally ''see'' Mr. Springsteen perform, it offers by 
far the broadest perspective yet of an artist whose music connects many 
of the major strands of American rock tradition, most notably Chuck 
Berry's twangy country-blues, Bob Dylan's oracular folk-rock poetry, 
Otis Redding's southern soul and the producer Phil Spector's surging 
teen anthems.<br>
<br>
''Live/1975-85'' is loaded with history. At the very least, it is a 
record of how one singer and his band have helped to sustain and put 
their personal stamp on a rock tradition that electronic keyboard 
technology has steadily eroded over the last decade. More important, the
 album is the pop-record equivalent of an epic American novel, its story
 told in the ungrammatical, rough-hewn vocabulary of rock.<br>
<br>
Because Mr. Springsteen is so popular he is almost worshipped by some, 
and because his songs are profoundly concerned with American ideals of 
community - family, hometown, and nation - the album has a historical 
resonance that goes beyond pop culture. The driving spirit behind most 
rock-and-roll has traditionally involved fantasies of personal 
transcendence and escape from everyday responsibilities. Mr. 
Springsteen, like no other rock and roller before him, has given this 
romantic vision a tragic dimension by putting it in a starkly realistic 
context. Mr. Springsteen's mature songs are set against a bleak backdrop
 of dingy factories, shabby wood frame houses and deserted railroad 
tracks.<br>
<br>
Instead of being presented chronologically, the songs are arranged in 
thematic sequences structured to draw conclusions about the past and 
speculate about the future. As an autobiographical portrait of Mr. 
Springsteen, ''Live/1975-85'' overflows with antic humor, romantic drama
 and, above all, restless, peripatetic, motor-driven action. The vivid 
small-town settings of his early songs are framed against a mysterious, 
inviting American landscape that the singer, borrowing from Chuck Berry,
 names ''the promised land.''<br>
<br>
''Live/1975-85'' describes Mr. Springsteen's search for salvation as he 
grows up and away from suburban small-town life and sets out to explore 
that territory. But instead of leading to a blissfully happy ending, his
 odyssey takes him to hell and back. Although he achieves a kind of 
redemption, it is a bitter knowledge of life's essential unfairness, 
leavened with compassion and a determined self-reliance. The core of the
 album is an extraordinary sequence of songs in which Mr. Springsteen 
confronts the irrational social and economic forces that shape - and 
sometimes violently destroy - American life. Although barely mentioned, 
the cataclysm at the center of the album is the Vietnam War, an event 
that in Mr. Springsteen's view casts an ominous shadow into the future.<br>
<br>
For the first two records, ''Live/ 1975-85'' offers a colorful 
rock-and-roll phantasmagoria of youthful passion in songs that are 
alternately thrillingly energetic, poignant and funny. ''Ohoh come take 
my hand/ We're riding out tonight to case the promised land,'' Mr. 
Springsteen pleads to a sweetheart in the opening cut, a beautiful 
acoustic version of ''Thunder Road,'' recorded 11 years ago at the Roxy 
in Los Angeles. The songs go on to describe the rambunctious, wildly 
romantic teen-age life that is ultimately left behind. Father-son strife
 (''Adam Raised a Cain''), adolescent hanging out (''Spirit in the 
Night''), the tawdry glamour of the Jersey shore (''4th of July, Asbury 
Park''), Romeo and Juliet love games (''Fire,'' ''Rosalita''), Marlon 
Brando stud-rebel fantasies (''Growin' Up'' and ''It's Hard to Be a 
Saint in the City''), and acute small-town claustrophobia 
(''Backstreets'') are remembered in the vivid, gawky rock-and-roll 
street poetry of Mr. Springsteen's early and mid-70's voice, and in 
music by the E Street Band that suggests a restless tear around the 
American highway.<br>
<br>
The swinging, loose-jointed bar-band rock of the band - its centerpiece 
the majestically gregarious honk of the saxophonist Clarence Clemons - 
musically epitomizes the joyous, freewheeling sense of camaraderie that 
runs to the heart much of Mr. Springsteen's music. ''Hungry Heart'' (an 
arena audience singalong), ''Two Hearts,'' a roaringly exuberant 
''Cadillac Ranch'' and a playfully sexy ''You Can Look (But You Better 
Not Touch)'' show off Mr. Springsteen and the band at their most 
raucously playful.<br>
<br>
But beginning with ''Independence Day,'' a brooding song about a young 
man leaving home, the mood of the album begins to shift. With just a 
slight alteration in tone, Mr. Springsteen's charging anthems can turn 
desperate. And ''Badlands'' reeks with cold sweat as it contemplates a 
deep animal fear not often admitted to in mainstream rock songs. This 
fear, which Mr. Springsteen perceives as an ominous, growing 
undercurrent of American working-class life, haunts much of the rest of 
the album. The other side of the coin is a fierce, nagging desire: 
''Poor man wanna be rich/ Rich man wanna be king/ And a king ain't 
satisfied/ Til he rules everything.''<br>
<br>
In an urbanized upwardly mobile society, Mr. Springsteen asks, is it 
possible for ordinary working people to build and sustain a stable, 
responsible sense of community? For the next one and a half records, the
 songs address the economic plight of America's working class with 
increasing despair and rage. ''Darkness on the Edge of Town'' and 
''Racing In the Street'' look sorrowfully at the energy and dreams 
squandered on small-town drag racing Later, Mr. Springsteen introduces a
 slow, measured rendition of Woody Guthrie's ''This Land Is Your Land'' 
with a monologue about how the song was written as an angry response to 
Irving Berlin's ''God Bless America.''<br>
<br>
It is followed by three songs from ''Nebraska,'' the 1982 acoustic album
 of cowboy-folk songs in which Mr. Springsteen began writing 
first-person monologues in the voices of characters totally outside 
himself. Sung in a sullen twang, this trilogy about senseless murder, 
injustice and betrayals so harsh they render life meaningless casts an 
even deeper chill. It hurts to hear Mr. Springsteen mumble in a tone of 
ornery deadpan despair: ''Struck me kinda funny, seem kinda funny sir to
 me/ At the end of every hard earned day/ people find some reason to 
believe.''<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen makes the ''Nebraska'' songs pay dividends by placing 
them in the album just before the concert version of ''Born in the 
U.S.A.'' Simply because its title is so catchy, some have mistaken the 
song for an aggressively jingoistic anthem. In fact, the song is an 
unemployed Vietnam veteran's scream of anguish when he finds himself 
unwanted and uncared for in the homeland he defended.<br>
<br>
In the next number, ''Seeds,'' America all but disappears into a black 
hole. This previously unrecorded song, the relentless cry of an 
out-of-work, homeless oil worker in Houston, weaves together images of 
blind industrial power and brutal social indifference with visions of 
suicide and social disintegration. ''You ain't gonna find nothin' down 
here friend/ Except the seeds blowin' up the highway in the south 
wind,'' the narrator warns, howling a tune that is essentially one 
repeated note stretched along an unresolved blues chord.<br>
<br>
The album turns poignantly reflective for a moment with a spoken 
monologue in which Mr. Springsteen recalls battling with his father in 
the late 60's. The tale, which has the understatement of a Raymond 
Carver story, segues into ''The River,'' the bleak folk ballad about a 
shotgun marriage and prematurely withered lives set in an ugly 
industrial town. Then, in another spoken monologue, Mr. Springsteen 
remembers watching the Vietnam War on television and tells his audience:
 ''If you're in your teens in 1985, blind faith in your leaders or in 
anything will get you killed.'' The singer and band immediately launch 
into a jackhammer-charged rendition of Barrett Strong and Norman 
Whitfield's 1970 anti-war chant, ''War.''<br>
<br>
With their relentless power-drilling rhythms and steely chainsaw 
textures, ''Born in the U.S.A.,'' ''Seeds,'' ''War,'' and two other 
songs, ''Darlington County'' and ''Working on the Highway,'' all compare
 hard labor with warmaking. Without actually preaching, Mr. Springsteen 
repeatedly makes the point that the same will and energy that drives 
productive physical labor can just as easily power destructive violence.
 All it takes for one to be perverted into the other is an absence of 
meaningful work.<br>
<br>
After contemplating the void so intently, ''Live/1975-85'' gradually 
lifts its gaze upward in a final sequence of songs that tentatively 
affirm love and community. The optimistic spirit of these songs comes 
more from the solidity of the music and from Mr. Springsteen's rugged 
singing than from what the songs actually say. The love demanded in 
''Cover Me'' is more protective than romantic, as the narrator pleads, 
''The whole world out there/ Just trying to score/ I've seen enough/ I 
don't want any more.'' ''Bobby Jean,'' ''No Surrender, and ''My 
Hometown'' all say goodbye to youth and to a vanishing small-town way of
 life.<br>
<br>
Musically, the high point of the album is a roaring, three-dimensionally
 rich concert version of Mr. Springteen's most famous mid-70's anthem, 
''Born to Run,'' that builds to such an exalted peak the music seems to 
take off into the air. But even here, the most memorable lines offer a 
painful observation on the futility of fuel-injected dreams: ''The 
highway's jammed with broken heroes/ On a last chance power drive/ 
Everybody's out on the run tonight/ But there's no place left to hide.''<br>
<br>
''Live/1975-85'' brings to a magnificent synthesis just about all the 
impulses that have fuelled rock music since it surfaced in the mid-50's 
as a mass cultural movement. You can get get caught up in the visceral 
charge of its engines, sing along with its chunky tunes and dream its 
romantic dreams and still feel the cold wind of the history blowing 
through its pages.</div>

By JON PARELES<br>
Published: October 4, 1987<br>
The New York Times</strong><br>
<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN doesn't trust myths. For a decade, his songs have been
 whittling away at the notion that the American birthright is unlimited 
opportunity and rising expectations. Now, with the new ''Tunnel of 
Love'' (Columbia 40999 LP, cassette and CD, scheduled for release 
tomorrow), he's confronting another illusion: the myth of love as 
perfect bliss and panacea.<br>
<br>
On ''Tunnel of Love,'' Mr. Springsteen turns from populist, arena-rock 
anthems to psychological reflections. It's a smart, good-hearted way to 
deal with the rising expectations directed at Mr. Springsteen himself - 
not a sequel to the 1984 blockbuster ''Born in the U.S.A.,'' which sold 
18 million copies worldwide, but a deliberate shift of direction and a 
scaling down. Where ''Born in the U.S.A.'' shouted its messages, 
''Tunnel of Love'' is conversational, even intimate - yet no less 
resonant. It makes Mr. Springsteen approachable again.<br>
<br>
Through the 1970's and 1980's, Mr. Springsteen came to embody one 
American myth: the self-made man, rock-and-roll division. Working his 
way from clubs to stadiums, avoiding flashy pop-star behavior, still 
showing up in clubs on the Jersey Shore, he's the working-class kid who 
hit the big time yet never forgot where he came from. ''Born in the 
U.S.A.'' put him over the top: hit singles, the stadium circuit and the 
commercial momentum to release a five-LP live set that zoomed to No. 1.<br>
<br>
Yet since the mid-1970's, he has been saying things the rock audience 
supposedly doesn't want to hear in its quest for escapist fun. His early
 songs swaggered with lusty self-confidence, ready to ''burst like a 
supernova,'' as he sang on the 1972 album ''Greetings From Asbury Park, 
N.J.'' When his popularity did explode, though, it weighed on Mr. 
Springsteen and made him think twice about everything he wrote, trying 
to be a force for good..<br>
<br>
From 1975's ''Born to Run'' and 1978's ''Darkness at the Edge of Town'' 
onward, his songs have insisted that most people are at the mercy of a 
brutal fate and an arbitrary economy - that dreams get crushed and 
upward mobility is a mirage. One by one, he examined adolescent 
exuberance, male buddying and honest work and found them wanting. His 
songs, as ''Live/1975-85'' shows, grew more deliberate; Mr. 
Springsteen's singing changed from an onrush of words to carefully 
placed phrases, in a voice edged with despair.<br>
<br>
In a way, Mr. Springsteen's tidings could be comforting. They suggest 
that failure isn't a ''sin'' (a word he has probably used more often 
than any other rock songwriter) or a character flaw, rebutting America's
 unexamined social Darwinism. Yet as a songwriter steeped in popular 
music - he recently said that when he made ''Born in the U.S.A.,'' he 
wanted to combine Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan and Phil Spector, - Mr. 
Springsteen did allow one utopian possibility: love.<br>
<br>
In most pop songs, true love means happiness ever after. Come-on songs 
promise it'll last a lifetime; breakup songs look back to a state of 
Edenic bliss. Love conquers all, fills every need, provides satisfaction
 and certainty, even in Mr. Springsteen's crumbling factory towns: 
''Hold me in your arms/ Let's let our love blind us,'' Mr. Springsteen 
sang in ''Cover Me'' in 1984. Of course it's never that simple (not on 
this planet), but the conventions of everything from classical comedies,
 which end with marriages, to dance records present love as an ecstatic 
refuge.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen, who married Julianne Phillips, a model, in 1985, wants 
pop to reconsider. Love, he's decided, doesn't drive away uncertainty - 
it raises new questions and new fears. Amid gleaming keyboards and 
screams recorded at a Jersey Shore roller coaster, the album's title 
song spells it out (with prepositions to spare): ''You've got to learn 
to live with what you can't rise above if you want to ride on down, down
 in through this tunnel of love.''<br>
<br>
On his 1980 album, ''The River,'' Mr. Springsteen wrote from a different
 angle about love growing cold. The music on ''Tunnel of Love'' echoes 
songs from that album, especially ''Fade Away'' (in the new ''All That 
Heaven Will Allow'') and ''The River'' (''Walk Like a Man'' and ''When 
You're Alone''). This time, though, Mr. Springsteen is doing most of the
 playing himself: dispensing early-1960's-style fuzz-tone guitar and a 
perfect organ line in ''Two Faces,'' playing a bluesy guitar solo in 
''Spare Parts,'' creating a spacious country waltz (reminiscent of 
Rickie Lee Jones's ''Last Chance Texaco'') in ''Valentine's Day.'' 
Members of his E Street Band appear as occasional sidemen; Clarence 
Clemons's saxophone, an E Street trademark, never shows up.<br>
<br>
Back in 1980, Mr. Springsteen wrote about beginnings and endings of 
romances, not ongoing ones, and he was thinking about how hard times put
 pressure on couples. With ''Tunnel of Love,'' economic woes recede. The
 album opens with ''Ain't Got You,'' a stripped-down, Bo Diddley-style 
bit of hyperbole (with autobiographical overtones, perhaps: ''Been paid a
 king's ransom for doin' what comes naturally'') about a rich man who 
can't get the woman he wants. Other songs use more typical, 
working-class Springsteen characters, but the pressures on them usually 
come from the heart, not the wallet.<br>
<br>
''Tunnel of Love'' has a loose story line: boy meets girl, marries girl,
 loses girl, misses girl. At a time when popular culture - not just 
songs but movies and television -relentlessly proselytizes for monogamy 
and marriage, ''Tunnel of Love'' seems to fit right in. But Mr. 
Springsteen doesn't treat standard situations in standard ways; in his 
new songs, monogamy means struggle as well as sanctuary.<br>
<br>
Commitment takes guts. Meeting a girl on a Saturday night in ''Tougher 
Than the Rest,'' he says that ''if you're rough enough for love/ Honey 
I'm tougher than the rest,'' while a hymnlike synthesizer melody 
underlines his earnestness. ''Brilliant Disguise,'' with its 
Drifters-style Latin undercurrents, and the bare-bones, Woody 
Guthrie-ish ''Cautious Man'' are about glimmerings of jealousy and 
infidelity in both partners. And in ''Two Faces'' and ''One Step Up,'' 
the narrator battles his own worst instincts: ''When I look at myself I 
don't see/ The man I wanted to be,'' Mr. Springsteen sings in ''One Step
 Up.''<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen's characters don't cling to partners unconditionally; 
he's didactic but not dictatorial. ''Spare Parts,'' an exuberant 
country-blues stomp, is about an abandoned, unwed mother who considers 
desperate measures, then decides to pawn her engagement ring and get on 
with life instead. And in ''When You're Alone,'' a jilted lover rejects 
his ex-girlfriend when she eventually returns. ''Lucky Man,'' the 
flipside of the ''Brilliant Disguise'' single (not included on the 
album), explicitly reverses most of the album's messages, saying, ''I 
don't miss no girl I don't miss no home/ He travels fastest who travels 
alone'' - although Mr. Springsteen's muttered vocals and the raw, 
galloping tune make him sound desperate rather than footloose.<br>
<br>
''Tunnel of Love'' isn't an intellectual breakthrough; Mr. Springsteen 
is hardly the first songwriter to address the limits of love. But with 
its dozen terse, careful, memorable songs, ''Tunnel of Love'' extends 
Mr. Springsteen's fatalism even further, dousing the last glimmer of 
unexamined hope and blocking the last escapist fantasies. ''God have 
mercy on the man/ Who doubts what he's sure of,'' Mr. Springsteen sings 
in ''Brilliant Disguise.'' Now, with ''Tunnel of Love,'' he's no longer 
sure of anything. But he's facing his fears head-on.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Reviews/Music; Springsteen at the Garden<br>
By STEPHEN HOLDEN<br>
Published: May 17, 1988<br>
The New York Times</strong><br>
<br>
''There comes a time when you've got to take the past and put it behind 
you,'' Bruce Springsteen said at Madison Square Garden last night during
 the opening show of his ''Tunnel of Love Express Tour.'' Mr. 
Springsteen's reflection was part of a monologue that introduced a 
powerful, hard-edged new rock song, ''Spare Parts,'' about young love, 
pregnancy and abandonment, but his words also evoked the transitional 
position in which America's quintessential rock hero finds himself.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen is no longer a romantic rock-and-roll cutup striking 
rebel poses and evoking a world of youthful fuel-injected passion. Now 
38 and married, and having left the New Jersey shore for a home in New 
York City, he is an adult who maintains a kid's enthusiasm for rock 
while trying to make grown-up sense out of relationships and the social 
order.<br>
<br>
As the wonderful new songs in the ''Tunnel of Love'' album demonstrate, 
Mr. Springsteen has entered a new phase. These songs are the first in 
which he takes a hard look at the reality of personal relationships, 
sorting through all the ambiguities of love - commitment and fear, 
security and boredom, sexual selfishness and emotional generosity. He 
finds the terrain perilous and unpredictable, yet manages to remain 
affirmative, in much the same way that ''Born in the U.S.A.'' 
scrutinized ordinary lives caught in the vise of social upheaval, yet 
managed to sound optimistic. Mr. Springsteen is, as he once wrote, a 
believer in ''The Promised Land.''<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen's gift is his ability to translate all of these 
ambiguities into basic, non-analytical argot that speaks as much to the 
body and the emotions as to the mind. In concert, he has also figured 
out how to string songs into extended journeys that take on a cumulative
 power as the evening proceeds. His ''Tunnel of Love Express Tour,'' 
which is to play four more Garden shows, all of them sold out, might be 
described as a serious carnival ride from confusion into jubilation.<br>
<br>
Last night's first set, which opened with the new album's title song, 
tunneled into the heart of darkness and reached depths of anguished 
frustration in ''Seeds'' and ''Roulette,'' the howling laments of 
working men victimized by social change. The second set, which included 
such Springsteen classics as ''I'm On Fire,'' ''Born to Run,'' ''Dancing
 in the Dark'' and ''Hungry Heart,'' was more upbeat, with Mr. 
Springsteen poking fun at television evangelists and delivering 
rollicking renditions of ''Glory Days'' and ''Rosalita'' - raucous, 
punchy songs with a nostalgic clout.<br>
<br>
The locomotive-driven arrangements by Mr. Springsteen and members of the
 E Street Band, augmented by a roaring five-man horn section, skillfully
 underscored the songs' deeper themes without ever seeming fussy. The 
keyboard textures on ''Tunnel of Love'' and other songs walk a perfect 
tightrope between churchy seriousness and carnival sleaze, and the 
jackhammer rhythms of ''Roulette'' evoke both patriotic zeal and 
murderous fantasy.<br>
<br>
Drawing just the right shadings was Mr. Springsteen's magnificent 
performance, almost operatic in its oratorical power and at the same 
time a ferociously joyful roar of exuberant freedom. While he's onstage,
 Mr. Springsteen reconciles seemingly unreconcilable concepts: a sober 
awareness of social and erotic realities and a boundless faith in life.</div>

By JON PARELES, Special to the New York Times<br>
Published: February 27, 1988</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
WORCESTER, Mass., Feb. 26— Bruce Springsteen wants to grow up, settle 
down and remind his huge audience that there's no escape from 
responsibility. ''One of the hardest things for me over the past 10 
years,'' he said Thursday as he introduced and partly disavowed a song 
from 1975, ''Born to Run,'' ''has been trying to understand what growing
 up and being a man is all about - trying to make some kind of home for 
myself and then trying to hold on to it.''<br>
<br>
But he also wants to rock out, and for Mr. Springsteen, the two goals 
are almost always at odds. In the opening show of his first United 
States tour since 1986, which immediately sold out the 13,000-seat 
Centrum here, he did his duty by the somber, fatalistic ballads about 
uncertain love and diminishing prospects that have filled his albums 
since the 1978 ''Darkness on the Edge of Town.'' And a supercharged rock
 and soul finale turned the last half-hour of the nearly three-hour show
 into a rip-roaring, cinderblock-shaking jubilee.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen's past tours have earned him a reputation for 
indefatigable showmanship and anthemic sing-alongs. The current tour 
still includes dramatic monologues, songs not available on his albums, 
sing-alongs, oldies, occasional band shtick and a re-enactment of the 
''Dancing in the Dark'' video clip. Once he had documented his concerts 
on the five-LP set ''Live: 1975-1985,'' however, Mr. Springsteen scaled 
down the arrangements and changed subjects for his 1987 album, ''Tunnel 
of Love.'' His early albums were about boyish dreams; his next ones were
 about men's work; ''Tunnel of Love'' is about men and women who are in 
love or married but not living happily ever after. Most of the songs are
 midtempo ballads or pop-rock hymns: ruminations on love, not anthems.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen performed eight songs from ''Tunnel of Love,'' and from 
the rest of his catalogue, with a few exceptions (including a searing 
version of ''Seeds,'' about migrant workers stranded by the Texas oil 
bust), he's chosen songs about relationships rather than economic 
troubles. Where he used to end his concerts with, ''I'm a prisoner of 
rock-and-roll,'' he now shouts, ''I'm a prisoner of love!''<br>
<br>
Most of the songs have an earnest, troubled tone, and it's not easy to 
build a rock-and-roll show around them. The music is solid and assured. 
Mr. Springsteen plays cutting lead-guitar lines, and his E Street Band 
and a five-man horn section recruited from the Asbury Jukes fill out the
 arrangements with warm keyboard sounds and horn-section chords.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen has taken to heart his responsibilities as a 
mass-audience performer. Unfortunately, his good intentions can make him
 didactic. Where his older songs were kaleidoscopic in everything from 
vocal delivery to arrangements to wordplay, his newer songs are 
virtually monochromatic; Mr. Springsteen stands still, sings in one tone
 - a moan or a rasp or a choked-back croon - and links images to deliver
 a parable. The songs are well made, with memorable keyboard mottoes and
 telling images, but their earnestness undermines them.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen hasn't entirely misplaced his sense of humor. In the 
second half of the concert he came up with ''Part Man, Part Monkey,'' a 
reggae-style defense of Darwin, and ''I'm a Coward When It Comes to 
Love,'' which crossbreeds ''Rockin' Pneumonia'' and Gino Washington's 
''Gino Is a Coward'' and states his latest themes with comic hyperbole. 
He also reclaimed his own ''Light of Day'' from the Paul Schrader film, 
and for his encores he revived the wild, woolly ''Rosalita'' and a 
soul-oldie medley including ''Devil With a Blue Dress On,'' ''Shake'' 
and more. By then he was racing around the stage and even dancing on Roy
 Bittan's piano.<br>
<br>
Clearly, Mr. Springsteen is grappling with the demands of maturity. 
Songs like ''Part Man, Part Monkey'' suggest that, at least part of the 
time, he knows he doesn't have to be solemn to be serious.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen Has a Grown-Up Way With a Song<br>
By John Rockwell<br>
Published: June 12, 1988<br>
The New York Times</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
AS SOMEONE WHO HAS FOLlowed the career of Bruce Springsteen with 
interest and ambition - oh, to heck with sober critical moderation: with
 loving enthusiasm - for some 15 years, I took great satisfaction in his
 ''Tunnel of Love'' indoor-arena tour that ended recently with five 
shows at Madison Square Garden. For me, it amounted to a fascinating 
deepening of his concerns, from anthemic rocker to angry social 
commentator to, now, a grown-up if troubled composer whose songs can 
stand comparison with the finest art songs of the past.<br>
<br>
I attest to my enthusiasm because a number of people, clinging to their 
memories or pumped up with delirious expectations, pronounced themselves
 disappointed with the show. The reasons for their disappointment seem 
to be at least two, apart from the fact that a hot ticket like this 
tends to find its way into the pockets of older, more settled people who
 themselves can't muster the rock-and-roll delirium of their youth.<br>
<br>
One reason is technical. Despite the huge size of unroofed, outdoor 
stadiums, their open-to-the-sky configuration poses fewer acoustical 
problems than an echo-ridden barn like the Garden. And because of the 
vast distances involved, artists like Mr. Springsteen use giant 
television monitors that provide a closer sense of involvement than the 
monitor-free - and still vast - spaces of a basketball arena.<br>
<br>
The second and more important reason for any disappointment, I think, 
was the very nature of the show Mr. Springsteen set about to provide 
(which in turn probably determined his choice of the more ''intimate'' 
arena circuit). Like the ''Tunnel of Love'' album, these four-hour shows
 stressed sober, introspective material.<br>
<br>
The theme was grown-up love and its vicissitudes. Many of the songs were
 overtly gloomy, ponderous dirges in the best Springsteen manner. Many 
of the ebullient rockers his fans have come to love and expect - the 
kind that provoked stadium-full sing-alongs on the last tour - were 
missing. And those rockers that were included tended to double back and 
comment on the underlying theme. There were uptempo numbers for the 
encores, of course, but some people felt they clashed with the body of 
the show, so sharply focused had it been. In any case, they came too 
late to alter the tenor of the evening.<br>
<br>
Two songs epitomized the evening. Well into the proceedings, Mr. 
Springsteen offered a starkly revisionist version of his youthful anthem
 (and title of his breakthrough album of 1975), ''Born to Run.'' He 
prefaced it with remarks to the effect that maybe what his youthful 
protagonists were really running toward was a mature, responsible 
self-awareness. The song itself was delivered as a ruminative lament, 
slow and serious, each word enunciated with solemn precision.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen had performed this song with solo piano accompaniment in
 his youth, as an alternative to its more familiar, full-band, 
hell-for-leather version. But this was so sharp a rethinking that it 
recalled Bob Dylan's snarled, monochromatic reductions of his own big 
hits. There was an enormous difference - Mr. Dylan seemed to be scorning
 his past, while Mr. Springsteen was earnestly trying to accommodate it,
 to make it one with his present.<br>
<br>
Both versions were failures - the phrase ''strap your hands across my 
engines,'' intoned as if part of the Pledge of Allegiance, seemed 
particularly silly. But at least Mr. Springsteen's revision was 
conscientiously considered, and it had a kind of sad poetic power in his
 very failure to make his pained adulthood seem like an extension from, 
or improvement on, his rebellious youth. It made one realize what a 
difficult time he himself seems to be having, growing into the full 
responsibilities and satisfactions of adult love. The other key song in 
the show was ''Brilliant Disguise,'' the first single on the ''Tunnel of
 Love'' album and the quintessential moment of that album and this show.
 It came like the still, quiet but deeply troubled center of the whole 
evening, and it has lingered in my own mind for weeks.<br>
<br>
The song is brilliant in more than its title. It's a slowish song (pop 
hits are generally uptempo) with animation provided by the 
accompaniment. It's a simple strophic song, yet it has an out-of-phase, 
shifting underpinning that enlivens the simplicity - indeed it 
constitutes the ''hook'' that makes the music memorable.<br>
<br>
But it's the words that lift the song into the realm of the truly 
distinctive, a bluntly pained reflection on the perhaps inevitable 
duplicity of love. The singer wonders if what he perceives in his 
beloved is real, and yet by the end he's turned things around and 
questions his own reality - or simple honesty - in the eyes of the 
beloved. The song is a case study in the ability of artists to address 
adult themes in the musical and formal language of youth-oriented pop. 
But it also reaffirms the capacity of popular music itself - vernacular 
spirit commodified to the max by the full muscle of American capitalism -
 to achieve traditional artistic stature.<br>
<br>
I once ruffled several sets of feathers by suggesting that Joni 
Mitchell's ''Hejira'' album represented a legitimate extension of Franz 
Schubert, Hugo Wolf and the entire line of the European art song. I 
still believe that to be true, and that Mr. Springsteen's songs can join
 the canon, as well.<br>
<br>
That is not to say that pop is only serious when it is classical, or 
that classical music is only vital if it is based on vernacular idioms, 
or that central European classical criteria for all things technical and
 spiritual should be employed in discussing the best modern 
Anglo-American pop songs.<br>
<br>
The point is that the song form - serious words set to music that is 
deeply felt yet accessible, at least to some - has been and remains one 
of the most profound of all Western musical statements. The ''Tunnel of 
Love'' tour was, among many other things, a telling forum for Mr. 
Springsteen at his most searching and serious. It deprecates no one, 
past or present, to recognize his contribution to the art-song 
tradition.</div>

The New York Times<br>
Springsteen: An Old-Fashioned Rocker in a New Era<br>
By JON PARELES<br>
Published: March 29, 1992</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen isn't budging. It has been five years between albums 
for rock's symbol of the hard-working, soft-hearted regular guy, five 
years of other bands' splotchy guitar din, digital samples, booming 
dance beats and chameleonic images, a time of rage and rhythm and 
nihilistic fun. Little of that has rubbed off on Springsteen's two new 
albums, "Human Touch" (designated his 10th album, largely recorded in 
1989-1990) and "Lucky Town" (his 11th album, recorded in 1991).<br>
<br>
Springsteen deliberately -- everything he does seems deliberate -- 
stands clear of the noise and ambiguity of 1990's rock. He has something
 to protect: his likability as the last sincere superstar. Springsteen 
has sold millions of albums and posed for his share of magazine covers 
and video clips; he takes his shirt off and strokes a woman in an 
artfully shadowed bedroom in the clip for "Human Touch." Yet he can 
still come across as someone outside show business, a rare rock musician
 who sees his profession not as media manipulation but as writing basic,
 four-minute, four-chord songs.<br>
<br>
He doesn't sell his music for commercials and hasn't accepted corporate 
sponsorship for his tours; his most recent public performances have been
 at benefit concerts, for Amnesty International and the Christic 
Institute, a liberal public-interest law firm. Although he has spawned 
at least a dozen imitators on major labels, from John Cafferty to Jon 
Bon Jovi to Marc Cohn, he hasn't tried to outmaneuver them by shifting 
musical direction. His long public silences and slow-changing style seem
 to be generated by something distinct from the desire to serve a 
novelty-seeking pop market. Which doesn't mean that "Human Touch" or 
"Lucky Town" won't be No. 1 on the charts next week.<br>
<br>
With and without his collusion, Springsteen has come to stand for rock 
traditionalism, and the trappings of 1990's rock seem too futuristic, 
too trendy for someone seeking the rock-and-roll fundamentals. In the 
"Human Touch" video, posses of young people with wild haircuts are seen 
in strobe flashes, a glimpse of outsiders who are recognized but not 
addressed. Meanwhile, Springsteen holds on to the timing of the LP era; 
"Lucky Town" (Columbia 53001;, all three formats) is only 40 minutes 
long, while "Human Touch" (Columbia 53000;, all three formats) clocks in
 at 58 minutes.<br>
<br>
From his first album in 1973, Springsteen sought to reclaim and 
personalize all the sounds he loved, whether they were from the 
artificial world of pop or the purportedly more authentic areas of rock,
 country and blues. He brought together the pop sheen of Phil Spector's 
Wall of Sound with the imagistic barrage of Bob Dylan's lyrics and the 
down-home punch of rockabilly guitars and gospel keyboards. Later, he 
moved away from theatrical suites (like "Jungleland" or "Rosalita") and 
simplified his songwriting to invoke older sources: the homely 
narratives of Woody Guthrie, the spartan heartbreak of Hank Williams.<br>
<br>
Even in the 1970's, Springsteen was a stylistic conservative, a sonic 
archivist. He would question the assumptions behind the oldies' lyrics 
-- love, growing up and finding a moral purpose were never as easy in 
Springsteen songs as they sounded in rock's earlier years -- but the 
musical verities were secure.<br>
<br>
They still are; Springsteen and his co-producers (Chuck Plotkin, Jon 
Landau and Roy Bittan) know how to make drums kick, keyboards gleam and 
guitars peal. The strutting rockabilly riffs of "Gloria's Eyes," the 
frat-party drumbeat of "All or Nothing at All," the jubilant choruses of
 "Leap of Faith," the minor-key twang and cracked singing of "Lucky 
Town" and the serene keyboards of "Human Touch" may not be new gambits, 
but they do the job.<br>
<br>
Springsteen still pays tributes on the new albums. "Man's Job" uses the 
chugging rhythms, rising melody lines and vulnerable tone of Roy 
Orbison, while the introduction to "Real World" refers to the cowbell 
and opening phrase of Free's "All Right Now." Springsteen's backup 
singers include Sam Moore, of Sam and Dave, and Bobby Hatfield, of the 
Righteous Brothers.<br>
<br>
The paradox is that the rock Springsteen cherishes and preserves once 
meant rebellion and change; it was the sound of outcasts and lowlifes 
breaking into the public sphere. For Springsteen now, the twang of 
hand-picked guitars and the kick of real drums represent a fortress for a
 family man, a defense against a post-modern world of rootlessness and 
moral ambiguity, of synthesized sounds and video games. The five-year 
wait for "Lucky Town" and "Human Touch" has only heightened the sense of
 isolation.<br>
<br>
Despite his musical preferences, Springsteen lives in the post-modern 
present. He may not sample other people's music, but on the new albums 
he quotes lyrics ("love in vain," "tumbling dice"), titles ("The Long 
Goodbye," "The Big Muddy") and guitar lines; like the hip-hop he never 
acknowledges, his songs are pastiches, using their allusions to show how
 times have changed. Youthful exuberance only carried him into the 
mid-1970's; since then, he has been self-conscious, pondering just how 
he can maintain a kind of truthfulness.<br>
<br>
During the 1980's, he spun stories about working-class despair and the 
crumbling of families, cities, hopes, making arena anthems out of bleak 
tales like "Born in the U.S.A." Now, he's separated from the last 
glimmers of populism. While politicians are making 1992 the year of the 
middle class, wherever that is, for Springsteen the only community 
that's left is his family.<br>
<br>
Even his backup musicians have changed; the E Street Band is gone, 
except for Bittan, its keyboardist. For "Human Touch," he worked with a 
basic group of Bittan, Randy Jackson on bass and Jeff Porcaro on drums. 
On "Lucky Town," Springsteen recorded nearly every instrument himself at
 his home studio, adding Gary Mallaber on drums (who often sounds like 
he is repeating drum-machine patterns). The two albums are distinct: 
most of "Lucky Town" is harder and denser, with tightly packed layers of
 guitars, while "Human Touch" is more open, more varied and, over all, 
more triumphal. Yet both albums immediately sound familiar, bringing 
together the introspection of "Tunnel of Love" with the punch of the 
1980 "The River" and 1984's "Born in the U.S.A."<br>
<br>
As it has been since "Darkness on the Edge of Town" in 1978, 
Springsteen's voice is weary, grizzled, diligently clinging to its 
narrow melody lines; now and then, it breaks free to single-mindedly 
shout a whole song, but either way, it's a voice that hasn't heard a 
good joke in a decade. The singing has its usual backdrops: midtempo 
ballads with ticking drums and sustained keyboards, recalling "The 
River," and rockers that use twangy guitar riffs (as in "Cadillac 
Ranch"), tootling keyboards (as in "Glory Days") or bell tones chiming 
away (as in "Born to Run").<br>
<br>
The messages are familiar, too. On "Human Touch," the singer agonizes 
over love, suffers bouts of jealousy and eventually decides that love is
 no panacea, but it's better than nothing. "If love is hopeless hopeless
 at best/ Come on put on your party dress," he whoops in "Real World." 
"Lucky Town" mulls questions of integrity and purpose, as the singer 
looks hard at himself -- "a life of leisure and a pirate's treasure/ 
Don't make much for tragedy" -- and wonders, in "The Big Muddy," whether
 moral purity or redemption are possible where "you start on higher 
ground but end up crawlin'."<br>
<br>
The ideas on the two albums overlap; they are Springsteen's long-term 
obsessions. "Lucky Town" includes "If I Should Fall Behind," a vow of 
honest if not everlasting affection that sounds like something from Bob 
Dylan's "Blood on the Tracks," and "Leap of Faith," a gospelly rocker 
about sex as sacrament. Meanwhile, "Human Touch" includes "Cross My 
Heart," which broods about the "spaces in between" wrong and right.<br>
<br>
On both albums, the singer finds a haven, temporary but precious, as a 
family man, cherishing his wife and children. "Human Touch" ends with 
"Pony Boy," which must be a lullaby for Springsteen's two sons; it's a 
finger-picked ballad that recalls Woody Guthrie's songs for children. 
And in "Souls of the Departed," on "Lucky Town," the singer thinks about
 death in the Persian Gulf and the Los Angeles ghetto, and worries about
 his own child: "I want to build me a wall so high nothing can burn it 
down."<br>
<br>
He knows that wall is already in place. The Springsteen who used to 
write working-class narratives has withdrawn, recognizing that after a 
decade as a rock superstar and millionaire, he wouldn't sound credible 
if he sang about punching a clock. "It's a sad funny ending to find 
yourself pretending/ A rich man in a poor man's shirt," he sings in 
"Better Days," which opens "Lucky Town."<br>
<br>
Instead, however, Springsteen is starting to sound like a man wrapped up
 in private preoccupations, running in circles. As the two albums recall
 previous arrangements and melodies, they also revive images from old 
songs; Springsteen mentions rivers more often on the new albums than he 
did on two LP's of "The River."<br>
<br>
Three songs on "Human Touch" bring something new to Springsteen's 
collected works. In "With Every Wish," Springsteen adds muted trumpet, 
fretless bass and dumbek (hand drum) to a ballad arrangement, giving a 
methodical song a jazzy undertow; "Soul Driver," an apocalyptic love 
song, allows itself a few eerie computer sounds.<br>
<br>
And in "57 Channels," Springsteen applies the stripped-down narrative 
style he perfected on "Nebraska" to a funny, ominous, deadpan encounter 
with modern media. The narrator hooks up cable television and then a 
satellite dish because "home entertainment was my baby's wish"; when all
 he gets is "57 channels and nothin' on," he loses his lover, shoots out
 his picture tube ("in the blessed name of Elvis") and ends up charged 
with disturbing the peace, facing a judge who recognizes he's "just 
about gone." Yet immediately after "57 Channels," it's back to the old 
steady-chugging didacticism of "Cross My Heart." By the end of the 
album, in "Real Man," he's singing about a "picture show," a locution 
few people living in 1992 actually use.<br>
<br>
It's easy to like and respect Springsteen. His songs invariably sound 
hard-won and homemade, every drumbeat and guitar solo making its point. 
(Springsteen definitely used part of the five-year gap to practice 
guitar.) Any performer who has spent more than two decades shaping his 
own style shouldn't have to jettison it to stay current; better a 
diehard than a fashion plate. But where Springsteen used to aim for 
synthesis, he now prefers stasis. In both words and music, Springsteen 
suggests there's nothing between trend-hopping and bunkered purity, that
 he and his nuclear family are better off alone, that the outside world 
is just "57 channels and nothin' on" -- a gloomier message than anything
 in the songs themselves. In the end, "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town" 
offer the twanging, stomping, pensive, troubled, well-crafted sound of 
retreat.</div>

By STEPHEN HOLDEN<br>
Published: August 9, 1992<br>
The New York Times</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Last year, shortly before marrying his former backup singer Patti 
Scialfa, Bruce Springsteen was seized with an intense creative fever.<br>
<br>
"It was nine months after my son was born," he recalled recently. "I was
 a father, and I had a real relationship with Patti, which was something
 that had evaded me for a long time. I'd just finished the album 'Human 
Touch,' but it felt unfinished."<br>
<br>
Working with an acoustic guitar and a drum machine, Mr. Springsteen 
wrote "Living Proof," a majestic rock ballad. A centerpiece of both his 
live show and new album "Lucky Town," it portrays fatherhood as a 
transcendent deliverance from a prolonged period of self-doubt and 
unhappiness.<br>
<br>
"I crawled deep into some kind of darkness/ Lookin' to burn out every 
trace of who I'd been," sings the narrator, who remembers his 
predomestic life as a prison with "no keys no guards/ Just one 
frightened man and some old shadows for bars." With the birth of his 
son, he finds salvation.<br>
<br>
" 'Living Proof' was the key unlocking the door into the next room, 
where a lot of songs were waiting," Mr. Springsteen continued. "I wrote 
one a night over the next three weeks, and they became 'Lucky Town.' The
 songs deal with a lot of the same spiritual issues that were in 'Born 
to Run.' "<br>
<br>
Lounging on a couch in his spacious dressing room at the Brendan Byrne 
Arena in New Jersey, before a concert in his sold-out 11-show 
engagement, which ends tomorrow, Mr. Springsteen reflected on what he 
said was "the single biggest transition of my life." A painful journey 
from what he called "the mythic world into the real world," it drove him
 to seek therapy 10 years ago. He has been in and out ever since.<br>
<br>
During the conversation, Mr. Springsteen shrugged off what some have 
perceived as an impending career crisis. After the albums "Human Touch" 
and "Lucky Town" were released by Columbia Records in April, the singer,
 whom critics had once treated as sacrosanct, received a few rare 
snipes. The reviews for both albums, though mostly favorable, were not 
as glowing as those for previous Springsteen records. There were also 
suggestions that the Boss, now a family man, 42 years old and wealthy to
 boot (with a $13 million house in Beverly Hills and another home in 
Rumson, N.J.), had gotten too comfortable and fallen out of touch with 
his Jersey Shore roots.<br>
<br>
The records, which respectively entered Billboard's pop album chart at 
No. 2 and No. 3, were beaten out by Def Leppard's "Adrenalize." When 
they quickly fell to the lower reaches of the chart, Entertainment 
Weekly ran a cover story that asked, "What Ever Happened to Bruce?"<br>
<br>
"In the mythic world, real things get in the way," Mr. Springsteen said,
 speaking in a quiet, husky voice while sipping tea and mineral water. 
"Real people get in the way. Or a real woman. Some people will just be 
upset by your real life and by the real choices you make because they 
get in the way of the dream."<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen has countered his critics with doses of humor. In the 
opening concert in New Jersey, he invited his audience to boo his move 
to Beverly Hills. "I can take it," he joked. The notion that Mr. 
Springsteen has in some way sold out is contradicted by his longtime 
friend and former E Street bandmate, (Miami) Steve Van Zandt (now known 
as Little Steven), who helped him remix his current single, "57 Channels
 (and Nothin' On)," from the "Human Touch" album.<br>
<br>
"Bruce is an adult with a wife and kids," he said, "and I think he'd 
have the same life style whatever town he chose to live in. I don't 
think living in California or in New Jersey has much to do with 
anything."<br>
<br>
Trim, with no trace of gray in his hair and a face full of stubble that 
thickens into a beard, Mr. Springsteen looks considerably younger than 
his years. If he is now a father of two children (his son, Evan James, 
born in July 1990, was followed last December by a daughter, Jessica 
Rae), the aura of a rock-and-roll gypsy still clings to him. Triple-loop
 silver earrings adorn both ears. He wears a large silver cross around 
his neck, a loose-fitting open shirt, cuffed blue jeans and 
weather-beaten black motorcycle boots with metal tips.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen, who gives few interviews, takes answering questions 
seriously. He speaks slowly and deliberately, often pausing to gather 
his thoughts and making only fleeting eye contact. There is a brooding 
quality in his deep-set eyes, but it is offset by a generous grin and 
frequent eruptions of slightly nervous laughter, which carries a note of
 self-deprecation. He seems intent on projecting the conviction that, 
despite his fame, he is an ordinary person who has done well because he 
happens to be good at one thing.<br>
<br>
During the interview, he always referred to his musical career as "my 
job"; to him, that job comes down to communication. "I've always 
believed that people listen to your music not to find out about you," he
 said, "but to find out about themselves."<br>
<br>
In describing his own personal odyssey, Mr. Springsteen unabashedly 
compared it with sea changes in the national consciousness. The myth 
that fueled his early music, and that ultimately became a burden, can be
 traced to American pop culture itself.<br>
<br>
"As a child, I felt the myth coming from everywhere, especially from 
television westerns with those big landscapes," he said. "In rock music 
it was Chuck Berry, the cars, the guitars, the girls, the sense of 
endless highway and endless night and sexual power. I believe it was 
something that everybody felt, and, of course, it was a romanticized 
view. It lasted until the 60's. Then in the 70's people really began to 
feel that there wasn't going to be enough for everybody."<br>
<br>
For Bruce Springsteen, maturing has involved "sorting out the images of 
manhood that are thrown at you in a little town in New Jersey," he said.
 "There was the car thing. I wasn't what you would call a car freak, as 
far as building them goes, but I was taken with the image."<br>
<br>
"Born to Run," the 1975 album that made him a star, codifies the myth of
 a rebellious young dreamer charging down the American highway in a 
quest for adventure. But barely seven years after its release, the 
singer took a cross-country trip during which his fantasies of leading 
an eternal rock-and-roll caravan came to an end.<br>
<br>
"I was 32, and I wasn't a kid anymore," he said. "At the same time I 
wasn't attached and didn't have a home life. For a couple of thousand 
dollars I bought a car and drove it across the country with a friend 
from North Jersey who ran a motorcycle shop. One day in the South we 
stopped by a river bank where some band whose name I forget was playing.
 I walked around the crowd and felt vey detached and far away. I had 
that sinking feeling that something had gone fundamentally wrong."<br>
<br>
Throughout the rest of the trip, he said, "I experienced a lot of bad 
feelings. It was an empty, floating feeling, like I had gotten lost. We 
finally got to California where I had a small house. And when we walked 
in, I couldn't sit down. I realized that the only thing I wanted to do 
was to get back in the car and go back the other way. And when I got 
home toNew Jersey, I knew I wouldn't want to stay there either."<br>
<br>
That fall of 1982, Mr. Springsteen said, was when "I found a doctor and started to talk to him."<br>
<br>
Since then, his life has been something of an emotional roller coaster, 
"finding some stuff out," as he puts it, "and then running away."<br>
<br>
One exhilarating compensation was the Brucemania that accompanied the 
overwhelming success of his 1984 album "Born in the U.S.A." The record 
sold 21 million copies worldwide, 11 million of them in the United 
States, and made him a pop megastar surpassed by only Michael Jackson.<br>
<br>
The album's cover image of Mr. Springsteen as a working-class hero with 
bulging biceps and tight jeans made him such an appealing icon of 
American machismo that both political parties angled for an endorsement 
in that year's Presidential election. He did not back anyone.<br>
<br>
When asked whom he would support this year, he hedged. "I don't come out
 and promote politicians," he said. "But I'm not voting for Bush. The 
last time I voted was in '72, for McGovern. This year I am going to 
vote."<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen played the role of the working-class hero for a while, 
but "it's not the way I grew up," he admitted. "I wasn't one of the guys
 or anything like that. I was a quiet, keep-to-myself kind of kid, and 
in a certain sense I was fragile. But during the 'Born in the U.S.A.' 
period I was doing a lot of physical things and exercising. I still do 
it, but in a more balanced sort of way."<br>
<br>
In 1987, he released "Tunnel of Love," a compelling chronicle of the ups
 and downs of a troubled relationship not unlike his with Julianne 
Phillips, an actress and model whom he married in 1985. He insists, 
however, that the songs were not strictly autobiographical.<br>
<br>
After the couple divorced in 1989, Mr. Springsteen married Ms. Scialfa, a
 willowy, redheaded singer and guitarist who had sung backup on his 1988
 "Tunnel of Love" tour with the E Street Band. Mr. Springsteen also 
separated from his longtime musical cohorts; only one member of the 
original E Street Band, the keyboardist Roy Bittan, plays with his 
current band. Although some fans saw the breakup as Mr. Springsteen's 
rejection of his roots, Mr. Van Zandt, who left the E Street Band in 
1983, was supportive.<br>
<br>
"He had been doing one thing for a long time, and he wanted to try 
something new," he said. "I don't think it's anything more dramatic than
 that."<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen has shown a deep streak of caution when it comes to 
tampering with his music or drawing on other art forms. Talking about 
literature that has impressed him, he cites the Canadian poet Leonard 
Cohen's album "I'm Your Man," but he is unfamiliar with Robert Bly's 
"Iron John."<br>
<br>
"I like to read, but I don't do it, and it's one of the worst things I don't do," he lamented.<br>
<br>
Although he is more in touch with movies than with books, he has no 
plans to be in one. With his New Jersey accent and the aura he wears of 
the rebel hood with the heart of gold -- Mr. Springsteen would seem an 
ideal choice to play one of Martin Scorsese's urban street characters or
 one of Sam Shepard's loners. In fact, his videos have revealed a 
telegenic star quality that is unconnected to music. But he claims that 
that kind of stardom holds little allure. "My experience with video has 
been that film is complicated and you have less control," he said. "It 
would be a very new form for me, when I feel I haven't gotten near to 
exhausting the one I'm in."<br>
<br>
The contemporary film that has left the deepest impression on him is Wim
 Wenders's "Wings of Desire," whose story he feels parallels many of his
 own concerns.<br>
<br>
"It's about an angel who gives up his wings to experience mortality," he
 explained. "To experience love and beauty, he has to accept 
temporalness. These are some of same issues I've tried to get at on my 
new records. I think one of the issues that is facing not only 
individuals but the whole country is that things are finite."<br>
<br>
The creative dry spell that coincided with Mr. Springsteen's personal 
tumult ended when he began writing the songs for "Human Touch," a 
turbulent album that took more than a year to record, beginning in 
January 1990. But when it was completed, he decided to delay its release
 until the second album, "Lucky Town," was complete.<br>
<br>
"I still felt I was dancing all around things I really wanted to say but
 didn't quite know how," he said. "For me, 'Lucky Town' was more 
emotionally realized."<br>
<br>
Both of his new albums almost totally ignore the electronic innovations 
that have colored much of 90's pop, though he is a fan of some new pop 
music. "For me, rap is the stuff that gets closest to the vitality of 
50's rock-and-roll. It's the rawest, most direct kind of in-your-face, 
bursting-off-the-street sound." He remembers watching Public Enemy on 
television recently. "When they came on, they felt like what I imagined 
Dylan must have felt like in the 60's, real timely and comedic and 
darkly funny, with a tremendous sense of energy."<br>
<br>
He's only vaguely familiar with Billy Ray Cyrus, the country star whose 
voice reminds some of Mr. Springsteen's. "It's real healthy right now 
out there," he said, adding that Guns 'n' Roses, Metallica and Nirvana 
are "really good bands who have something to say and who really mean 
something in their fans' lives."<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen sees his own albums as soul-and-blues-influenced ("Human
 Touch") and part of the folk-rock tradition ("Lucky Town"). Said Jon 
Landau, Mr. Springsteen's manager and co-producer: "Bruce's 
preoccupation is, above all, his writing. If the song is right, that's 
80 percent of it for him. In our approach to production you won't find 
much that gets in the way of the song." In fact, "Lucky Town," on which 
Mr. Springsteen played most of the instruments, sounds like the homemade
 album that it is. Though one of Mr. Springsteen's most brilliant 
collections of songs, it lacks the commercial sheen that might have made
 its catchiest songs radio-ready hits.<br>
<br>
With the onset of the tour, which is expected to continue through North 
America into 1993, sales of Mr. Springsteen's two albums have begun to 
pick up. In the New York market, after only two concerts, both albums 
saw an increase of more than 80 percent in sales from the previous week.
 In the United States, "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town" have sold, 
respectively, 1.7 million and 1.6 million copies. Together, that is more
 than "Tunnel of Love." Overseas sales for the two new albums are well 
over four million.<br>
<br>
The New Jersey concerts, which draw heavily on material from the two 
albums, open with three songs from "Lucky Town" and close with 
back-to-back renditions of "Born to Run" and "My Beautiful Reward," the 
tender, searching ballad that closes "Lucky Town." Mr. Springsteen said 
he sees the two songs, and their albums, as bookends.<br>
<br>
"In 1974, I was a 24-year-old sitting on my bed in Long Branch, N.J., 
saying, 'Hey, I want to know if love is real,' " he said. "If you listen
 to 'Born to Run,' that's the question the song asks. If you've followed
 my characters over the years, you could see them struggling and failing
 and losing each other and finding each other again, and losing 
themselves and finding themselves i pursuit of some sort of answer to 
that question. I felt that if you had followed my characters all the way
 back to 'Born to Run,' 'Lucky Town' was the place where they were 
going."</div>

By NEIL STRAUSS<br>
Published: May 7, 1995<br>
The New York Times</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
"BROOOOOOOCE!" So went the cries of nearly a dozen police officers as 
Bruce Springsteen walked past the 18th Precinct station house on West 
54th Street. As he strolled through midtown Manhattan on a sunny weekday
 afternoon, no other pedestrians stopped him or yodeled his first name. 
They just looked at him as he passed by, trying to quietly absorb his 
presence with their gaze in the jaded way that New Yorkers respond to 
fame. It was only the police officers who reacted, pulling out their 
summons pads for Mr. Springsteen to sign and yelling, "You're the best!"
 as he complied.<br>
<br>
"I have a healthy fan base in law enforcement," Mr. Springsteen, 45, 
said with a staccato laugh as he turned on to Eighth Avenue, beginning 
one of the few interviews he has granted during his two-decade career, 
which has recently taken yet another upswing.<br>
<br>
Rock musicians and police officers aren't supposed to mix. It's a 
tradition that goes back to the day the blues musician Robert Johnson 
went to the crossroads and supposedly made a deal with the Devil. But 
since Mr. Springsteen emerged from Asbury Park, N. J., in the early 
1970's, firing off hit songs like "Born to Run," "Hungry Heart" and, 
more recently, "Streets of Philadelphia," he has changed the rules of 
rebellion.<br>
<br>
He imbued the daily struggles of those in the working class with a 
quotidian heroism, telling them that they mattered and assuring them 
that there was nothing wrong with trying to realize a dream, even if 
their attempt failed. "Spend your life waiting for a moment that just 
don't come," he sings in "Badlands," a 1978 song on his newly released 
"Greatest Hits" album on Columbia. "Well, don't waste your time 
waiting."<br>
<br>
"A lot of rock-and-roll music was concerned with the outlaw," Mr. 
Springsteen said. "But I liked the idea of 'High Noon' and the 
ambivalent sheriff. My characters were people who had something to be 
gained and lost by stepping in either direction. They were misfits more 
than outlaws."<br>
<br>
Since Mr. Springsteen's heyday in the early and mid-1980's, times have 
changed -- and so has Mr. Springsteen. In 1989, he divorced his first 
wife, the model Julianne Phillips, and started dating the woman who 
would become his second, Patti Scialfa, a member of his backup group, 
the E Street Band. That same year, he dismissed the band and, in 1990, 
bought his third home, a $14 million estate in Beverly Hills (he also 
has a farm near his hometown, Freehold, N. J., and a house in nearby 
Rumson).<br>
<br>
For fans who saw Mr. Springsteen as one of the few rock stars who hadn't
 forgotten what it was like to be a regular human being, these actions 
were confusing. The relative lack of enthusiasm with which fans and 
critics greeted his 1992 albums, "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town," led 
some to wonder how relevant Mr. Springsteen was in the 90's.<br>
<br>
But in the past year, the pendulum has started to swing in Mr. 
Springsteen's direction again. He received four Grammys and an Oscar for
 his title song to the movie "Philadelphia," reunited with the E Street 
Band to record six additional songs for "Greatest Hits" (three of which 
ended up on the record) and watched the album shoot to No. 1 on the pop 
charts the week it was released. Its first new hit, a previously 
unreleased 1982 song called "Murder Incorporated," about the 
proliferation of guns and the devaluation of human life, sounds even 
more appropriate today than it did when it was written.<br>
<br>
"I BELIEVE THAT THE BASIC IDEAS and the values that I wrote into all 
those songs on the album are still relevant," Mr. Springsteen said. 
"When I wrote them, I wanted to write about things that people always 
have to go through at some point in their lives. My music wasn't going 
to be about fashion or style. It was going to be about family and 
struggle and identity questions, spiritual questions: Who am I? Where am
 I going? How do you live an honest life, and is it possible? How do you
 make the kinds of connections that keep you from the worst of yourself 
and bring out the best of yourself? And then there's fun and good times 
-- how do you find them?"<br>
<br>
During that afternoon walk, Mr. Springsteen had his choice of good 
times: he could find them in Central Park or he could find them in 
Hannah's Cocktail Lounge, a few blocks from the police station. It took 
two seconds for Mr. Springsteen to choose the latter. He settled into a 
table near the window in the front of the small, empty bar, then changed
 his mind. He wanted a table in the back corner, where no sunlight 
penetrated. His age didn't show in his ruddy cheeks, tousled dark hair, 
husky frame and cross-shaped earring. "If anybody could make you dream, 
it's Bruce Springsteen," says Melissa Etheridge, who models her 
impassioned performances after Mr. Springsteen's. But on that day, he 
seemed more ready to shatter dreams than inspire them.<br>
<br>
He downed a shot of tequila, took a sip from his beer chaser and talked 
about his recent metamorphosis. Having children -- Evan James, 4, 
Jessica Rae, 3, and Sam Ryan, 1 -- pulled him out of his solipsistic 
world, he said, and not just because he now has to wake up every morning
 at 8:30 and drive the two oldest to school in his black Ford Explorer.<br>
<br>
"I think that before I had kids I was waiting for my life to begin," he 
said. "It was always, 'When this happens, when that happens.' And all of
 a sudden one morning I woke up and that feeling was just gone. It felt 
to me like the beginning of some life that I had worked really hard and 
waited very long to get to. I was 40 years old when I had kids, and so I
 was already at the point where the interesting things for me felt like 
they were going to be over there -- away from bars and running around --
 and closer to children and relationships and deeper satisfactions."<br>
<br>
On "Greatest Hits," one can hear these changes taking place. It begins 
with visions of freedom and the open road in "Born to Run," matures with
 the 35-year-old father in "My Hometown" who knows he's lying to himself
 when he talks of packing his bags and escaping, and ends with the 
fatalistic wisdom of "Blood Brothers," a song about the E Street Band. 
In his slightly hoarse voice he sings, "The hardness of this world 
slowly grinds your dreams away, making a fool's joke out of the promises
 we make."<br>
<br>
"The songs are not literally autobiographical," he said. "But in some 
way they're emotionally autobiographical. As they go by, you see your 
own take on the world and how it's changed since you were a kid. You 
create a variety of different characters, and the thing they have in 
common is some emotional thread you've tried to use to make your own way
 through what can feel like a particularly imponderable existence."<br>
<br>
Songs have not always been enough for Mr. Springsteen to help him weave 
his way through life. One of the biggest steps he ever had to take, he 
said, was 13 years ago, when he decided to undergo therapy, which he 
continues sporadically. "I grew up in a working-class family, where that
 was frowned upon," he said. "It was very, very difficult for me to ever
 get to a place where I said I needed some help. I stumbled into some 
different, very dark times where I simply had no other idea of what to 
do. It's not necessarily for everybody, but all I can say is, I've 
accomplished things personally that felt simply impossible previously. 
The leap of consciousness that it takes to go from playing in your 
garage to playing in front of 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 people or when you 
experience any kind of success at all can be very, very demanding."<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen has made the transition from garage-rocker to 
arena-rocker better than most rock singers. He doesn't have to try to be
 sincere; it comes naturally. In the 1970's, at the height of rock-star 
decadence, Mr. Springsteen set himself apart from his contemporaries by 
rarely indulging in anything but a sweaty, energetic three- or four-hour
 show. In the 1990's, it's now in vogue for rockers to resent their 
large following, but Mr. Springsteen continues to embrace his 
wholeheartedly. His vision from the beginning was that the band should 
be a fan's rock group. In fact, "Murder Incorporated" was included on 
"Greatest Hits" solely because of one fan's persistence.<br>
<br>
"For years, there's this guy that's been following me around with a 
'Murder Incorporated' sign," Mr. Springsteen said. "I see him in the 
audience like every five shows. I have never played the song, ever, in 
concert and would have no intent to do so, and yet this guy follows me 
around with this sign and flashes it during the entire show. So it was 
he who I had in mind when we put the song on the album. We said, 'Let's 
put this on for that guy, whoever he is.' "<br>
<br>
In the introduction to a book about Mr. Springsteen, one fan describes 
his idol in bold capital letters as "real." Mr. Springsteen prefers the 
word "grounded," but real is what comes to mind when one meets him. 
Sitting at Hannah's Cocktail Lounge, he came on like a good-natured 
lumberjack ready to chop down the trees that separate him from his 
audience. He urged on the conversation with lines like "Let's not stop 
now" and ordered new beers every time one started to get warm. He seemed
 ready to talk about each subject for an hour or two -- if only to avoid
 an awkward silence.<br>
<br>
The topic Mr. Springsteen constantly returned to was the E Street Band, 
which has been with him through his best years. A poet in auto 
mechanic's clothing, he was first signed to a record label during the 
tail end of the Nixon years; he and the band were one of the few groups 
in a politically cynical time that still thought rock could change the 
world. Mr. Springsteen and the band's fame peaked during the Reagan 
1980's, when they gave voice to those grasping for a meaningful life in a
 system that did not seem to value them. Now that Congressional 
Republicans are trying to undo 60 years of social reform, perhaps 
there's no better time for Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band to 
return and let those blue-collar voices be heard from again.<br>
<br>
"It's very strange that the Republicans are coming back now," Mr. 
Springsteen said. "Because my idea in the early and mid-1980's was to 
put forth an alternate vision of the America that was being put forth by
 the Reagan-era Republicans. They basically tried to co-opt every image 
that was American, including me. I wanted to stake my own claim to those
 images, and put forth my own ideas about them. The band drew me in that
 direction, and that's the direction that I want to work in in the 
future with them."<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen's reunion with the E Street Band, whom he hasn't 
recorded with in 10 years, is not just symbolic. In his view, people 
perceived his solo work, on albums like "Nebraska," "Tunnel of Love" and
 "Lucky Town," as very personal and psychological. The E Street Band, he
 said, is like a bridge connecting him with his fans, broadening the 
scope of his writing. Equally important, he said the band's easy 
camaraderie keeps him from slipping into what he called "the abyss of 
self-destructiveness."<br>
<br>
A prolific songwriter but notoriously slow when it comes to releasing 
records, Mr. Springsteen, nonetheless, wants to finish recording a solo 
album in the next few weeks and record an album with the band this 
summer. He hopes to change his relationship with the band. "I simply 
want to do both things, like what Neil Young does with Crazy Horse," he 
explained. "He'll go and do a project with different musicians, and then
 he'll come back and play with Crazy Horse when he has something that 
feels right for them."<br>
<br>
Steve Van Zandt, the guitarist who left the E Street Band in 1984 but 
has now rejoined it, said that Mr. Springsteen's plan seemed like a good
 idea. "We talked about it years ago," he said. "I really felt that was 
the way to go."<br>
<br>
In addition to the new songs on the "Greatest Hits" album, Mr. 
Springsteen also recently completed a song for the Sean Penn film "The 
Crossing Guard" and wrote for and helped produce a forthcoming album by 
Joe Grushecky, a Pittsburgh rock musician. The thrill of playing blues 
guitar with the roots-rock band Blasters at a recent concert of theirs, 
he said, has led him to start "toying around with the idea of making a 
record that's centered around loud guitars." He has also been listening 
to the punk band Social Distortion and Wayne Kramer, the former 
guitarist with the proto-punk group MC5.<br>
<br>
MR. SPRINGSTEEN IS LESS enthusiastic about the Grammy and Academy Awards
 he recently won for "Streets of Philadelphia." "I didn't win any awards
 for so long, so I devalued them because it was necessary," he said, 
guffawing so hard that his shoulders shook. "Those are pretty 
conservative organizations, and all the actual rock records I've made 
over the years have been ignored. But I had a nice night at the Oscars, 
and I was really sort of appreciative, and my mother came and got to see
 me win instead of lose. In the early 1980's, we did a benefit for the 
Vietnam Veterans Association, and all the guys gave me a helmet that 
they had signed. So I think that was the nicest award I've ever 
received."<br>
<br>
Growing older has enabled Mr. Springsteen to look back at his past with 
perspective and, at times, curiosity. In "Thunder Road," recorded in 
1975, the protagonist tries to explain to the woman he is speaking to 
that she is not too old to escape her dead-end life. "So you're scared 
and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore," he tells 
her.<br>
<br>
"I was 24 when I wrote that," Mr. Springsteen said, pausing to laugh at 
himself. "I listen to that now and think, 'Hey, wait a minute.' It's 
really strange, that line, and the one in 'Rosalita' -- 'Someday we'll 
look back on this, and it will all seem funny.' Those were two good 
ones, you know. I have no idea where I was conceivably coming from at 
that time."<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen can make fun of his songs and ambition now. But the 
truth is, he tried to make music and plan his career so that he would 
regret nothing: "I didn't want to be rocking on my porch when I was 70 
years old going, 'Oh, man, I should have taken a shot at this.' "<br>
<br>
When it was pointed out to him that in an interview he did three years 
ago, he used the same image about sitting on his porch, but that the age
 he mentioned was 60 instead of 70, he laughed again. "There you go," he
 said. "The older you get, the younger you are. At 60, I plan to be 
still doing it. We're moving it up as we go. It will be 80 in another 
five years."</div>

By JESSE FOX MAYSHARK<br>
Published: January 13, 2006<br>
The New York Times</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Murders, broken families, lost jobs, last chances and long, late-night 
drives down dark, lonely Interstates -- Bruce Springsteen's album 
''Nebraska'' has something for everyone to feel bad about.<br>
<br>
While Mr. Springsteen and his fans have spent the last few months 
celebrating the 30th-anniversary rerelease of his anthemic 1975 
breakthrough, ''Born to Run,'' the New York Guitar Festival has chosen 
to open its three-week calendar with a tribute to his 1982 cycle of 
spare, existential folk songs.<br>
<br>
In a free concert tomorrow night at the World Financial Center Winter 
Garden, musicians including Michelle Shocked, the National, Meshell 
Ndegeocello and Mark Eitzel will perform the entire album, in sequence.<br>
<br>
''The first Springsteen record I ever bought was 'Nebraska,' '' said 
David Spelman, the director of the festival, which he founded in 1999. 
''I was in one part flummoxed by it and in another part fascinated, and 
really attracted to it.''<br>
<br>
The New York Guitar Festival includes more than two dozen concerts, 
seminars and other events at sites around the city. Most will spotlight 
guitar titans past and present. But while the show tomorrow night will 
include accompaniment and instrumental interludes from six-string 
luminaries like Marc Ribot, Vernon Reid and Gary Lucas, the focus will 
be on Mr. Springsteen's unvarnished album.<br>
<br>
''It's probably better for a night like this that it isn't one of the 
more famous records,'' said the singer-songwriter Jesse Harris, who will
 perform the song ''Atlantic City.'' ''Because of the nature of the 
record, it lends itself to interpretation.''<br>
<br>
The songs on ''Nebraska,'' recorded as four-track demos, feature just 
Mr. Springsteen's guitar, harmonica and voice. The title track crawls 
inside the head of an unrepentant killer (inspired by Charles 
Starkweather, who murdered 11 people in the late 1950's), and the album 
rarely strikes a sunnier note. It limns one troubled life after another 
before concluding with a song that observes dryly, ''At the end of every
 hard-earned day, people find some reason to believe.'' In the wake of 
what precedes it, the line sounds more ironic than hopeful.<br>
<br>
In interviews, some of the participants promised a range of musical 
settings. Mr. Harris is bringing a band. Ms. Shocked will add horns to 
''Nebraska.'' Mr. Lucas promises a ''psychedelic electronic'' recasting 
of ''State Trooper,'' inspired by what he called the song's ''stark, 
doom-laden riff.'' The country-folk singer Laura Cantrell will sing 
''Used Cars,'' backed only by guitar and mandolin.<br>
<br>
''I'm very curious who will find what and draw what out of these 
songs,'' Ms. Cantrell said. ''By spreading the songs across very 
disparate performers, the songs might still retain the dark quality, but
 it's not going to be unrelentingly bleak.''<br>
<br>
As a prelude, the Winter Garden is presenting a free miniconcert of 
songs from the album at 12:30 this afternoon, featuring six local acts 
chosen from a ''Nebraska'' battle of the bands at the Bitter End last 
month.<br>
<br>
Mr. Spelman, 39, who organizes and produces music and arts events around
 the country, said he started the festival to reconnect with the 
instrument he had played and studied for years -- he is a graduate of 
the New England Conservatory -- but then put aside. Inspired by the 
eclecticism of John Schaefer's radio show ''New Sounds'' (heard on WNYC,
 93.9 FM, nightly at 11), he said, he wanted to showcase the full range 
of guitar music. With Mr. Schaefer's encouragement and support from 
sponsors including D'Addario, which manufactures instrument strings, he 
put together a jubilee that this year has grown to include 65 
guitarists.<br>
<br>
''It's kind of ballooned into quite an extravaganza,'' Mr. Spelman said.
 Proceeds from the festival, which is nonprofit, go to musical outreach 
programs in New York City schools.<br>
<br>
Besides the ''Nebraska'' tribute, the opening weekend features an 
eight-hour ''Guitar Marathon'' on Sunday at the 92nd Street Y, 
celebrating 450 years of Spanish guitar. Other highlights include 
tributes to Delta blues legends, live film soundtrack performances and 
concerts by Bill Frisell, Daniel Lanois and the classical guitarist 
Stephen Aron.<br>
<br>
''Nebraska'' is the second album to get the tribute treatment at the 
festival, following a 2004 salute to Bob Dylan's ''Blood on the 
Tracks.'' Over the years it has become an entry point into Mr. 
Springsteen's catalog for people -- from folk purists to indie-rockers 
-- who otherwise might consider Mr. Springsteen ''too popular to be 
worth listening to,'' as Mr. Spelman put it. He allows that he was one 
of them, until he moved to New Jersey seven years ago, and a friend 
urged him to give the state bard a chance.<br>
<br>
At a rehearsal Monday in the Winter Garden's backstage area, Mr. Spelman
 and about half the performers in the concert felt their way through a 
handful of Woody Guthrie verses that will serve as a group finale. Mr. 
Lucas and Mr. Reid traded licks, while Ms. Cantrell shared lines with 
Jen Chapin, Dan Zanes and Kevn Kinney. Mr. Spelman told the assembled 
group that he had contacted Mr. Springsteen's management but did not 
know if Mr. Springsteen would attend the concert. (A spokeswoman for Mr.
 Springsteen said he was not available for comment.) By closing with a 
Guthrie song, Mr. Spelman said, the evening will connect ''Nebraska'' 
with the Dust Bowl songs that are its most obvious antecedent.<br>
<br>
Mr. Reid, the guitarist for Living Colour, said he thought ''Nebraska'' 
was Mr. Springsteen's attempt ''to look at another side of the American 
dream.''<br>
<br>
''The thing about that record is that it's the America we all try to 
deny,'' Mr. Reid said. ''I wish other artists of his stature took on 
what he laid down -- a solid, unmitigatable statement.''</div>

The Boss Lets Freedom Ring, With Banjo<br>
By DAN BARRY<br>

<br>
 <br>
THIS is what you would do. Close the bedroom door to the quiet 
indignities of childhood. Unclasp a small but hefty box to reveal a now 
forgotten device called a portable record player. Plug it in.<br>
<br>
Make a selection from the albums your parents bought when they used to 
listen to music. No, not Mitch Miller and his Gang. No, not Herb Alpert 
and the Tijuana Brass. Where's the skinny guy with the reedy voice, 
always singing about freedom? Here. Pete Seeger.<br>
<br>
Place the needle down on a disc now spinning in promise, catch the 
groove, and allow old words and ancient melodies to seep in until they 
could never be removed. The skips and hisses on the scratched records 
are as ingrained as the choruses in memory.<br>
<br>
You did not listen to be cool; in this age of the Rolling Stones and the
 Beatles, you were unlikely to impress a girl by singing the opening 
lines to "Erie Canal" ("I've got a mule and her name is Sal ..."). Not 
that you ever summoned the nerve to speak to girls, much less sing to 
them.<br>
<br>
No, you listened because you found something affirming in songs that 
honored hard work, struggle and standing up for what you believe. You 
felt connected to your immigrant roots, to your African-American 
neighbors and to your country, of which you sang with innocent pride. 
You felt connected to your father, to your mother.<br>
<br>
In the era of King and Kennedys shot, you would sit beside the record 
player and sing, "Oh Mary don't you weep don't you moan, oh Mary don't 
you weep don't you moan. Pharaoh's army got drowneded, oh Mary don't you
 weep." And feel the consolation.<br>
<br>
In the era of Vietnam and civil rights battles, you would sing, "We 
shall overcome, we shall overcome, we shall overcome someday." And 
believe it.<br>
<br>
Then you grew up. Vietnam ended like an unfinished sentence, and King 
and the Kennedys settled into the abstraction of history. Your mother 
died and your father stopped singing. The albums went to storage.<br>
<br>
Nearly 2,800 people died a couple of miles from where you worked; for 
weeks the smell of the pyre wafted through your Midtown office window. 
Your country went to war. Hurricane Katrina crushed one part of the 
South, and Hurricane Rita crushed another.<br>
<br>
You sensed the unimpeded march of Pharaoh's army.<br>
<br>
The other night you went to a Bruce Springsteen concert at Madison 
Square Garden. Some celebrities sat a few rows behind you, and a group 
of older women, including the singer's mother, sat beside you. You 
feared your own presence constituted a security breach, but the lights 
dimmed, no one tapped you on the shoulder, and so you stayed.<br>
<br>
In the stage shadows you could see the silhouette of Mr. Springsteen 
shaking hands and slapping the backs of musicians, 17 or so, as they 
stepped up and took their places in what is being called the Seeger 
Sessions. One held a banjo, another an accordion, another a tuba. This 
was not the E Street Band.<br>
<br>
Then music exploded from the stage: rock and bluegrass, jig and reel, 
spiritual and swing, honky-tonk and acoustic blues, working separately 
and in concert to coax from dormancy all those old songs that once meant
 something to you.<br>
<br>
Think of it. In this era of post-post-post irony, there sounded in 
Midtown Manhattan the lyrics to "Erie Canal," with that mule named Sal. 
In this era of Operation What-Was-It-Again, there rang out a song nearly
 200 years old, "Mrs. McGrath," whose soldier son's legs were swept away
 by a cannonball on the fifth of May.<br>
<br>
In this era of Paris Hilton idealization, of pleasure found in a tycoon 
snarling "You're fired," tens of thousands of people sang of climbing 
Jacob's ladder; of keeping your eyes on the prize; of overcoming.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen occasionally slowed the celebration to a contemplative 
pace. His "My City of Ruins," written for Asbury Park, then applied to 
post-9/11 New York, now ached for New Orleans. His version of "When the 
Saints Go Marching In" became a prayer.<br>
<br>
More often, though, he raised his audience up with old songs and 
spirituals that he had infused with rocking urgency, then toyed with so 
that brass and guitar could harmonize, an accordionist could jam with 
the Boss, and a tuba player could know rock-concert adulation.<br>
<br>
People danced, those celebrities swayed, the mother beside you raised her hands in joy. And you sang again:<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters don't you cry<br>
<br>
There'll be good times by and by<br>
<br>
Pharaoh's army got drowneded<br>
<br>
Oh Mary don't you weep.</div>

The New York Times<br>
<br>
Springsteen Promises ‘12-Minute Party’ at Halftime (January 30, 2009)</strong><br>
<br>
A Super Bowl week that has been largely devoid of excitement and news 
got a shot of New Jersey adrenalin — reminiscent of last year — when 
Bruce Springsteen stepped onto a stage Thursday and announced, “If there
 are going to be a lot of questions about football, this is going to be 
the shortest press conference, because I don’t know anything about it.”<br>
<br>
That’s quite all right; neither do many of those who produce, cover or 
watch it. But Super Bowl Sunday and all the trimmings is an 
institutional custom you eventually can’t avoid, or resist, even when 
you have held yourself to a higher standard than the crass commercialism
 occasionally mixed with patriotic pandering that has long been the 
nation’s most-watched sporting event.<br>
<br>
So after long dismissing a gig he described as “playing where the 
cheerleaders usually go,” Bruce Springsteen and his E Street Band will 
finally do the 12-minute halftime show of Super Bowl XLIII on Sunday, 
almost two weeks after the politicized rocker reveled in the departure 
of the 43rd president of the United States.<br>
<br>
Springsteen celebrated Barack Obama’s ascension to the White House by 
singing at the inauguration concert, and that was pressure, he said, 
with “Lincoln staring over your shoulder.”<br>
<br>
The Super Bowl is just a phalanx of pseudo fans running onto the field 
and waving on cue. It’s an unabashed hard sell, as Springsteen was at 
least decent enough to note.<br>
<br>
“We have a new album coming out,” he said. “We have our mercenary reasons, of course.”<br>
<br>
What the heck, Mick Jagger and Paul McCartney — icons of the band’s 
youth, according to Steven Van Zandt — have already done the halftime 
show, in back-to-back years. And while I’d like to think that John 
Lennon would have been a holdout for life, I’m probably kidding myself. 
Everyone wants to hawk their work before the granddaddy of television 
audiences, stay relevant in the new media world.<br>
<br>
As Springsteen, 59, said: “One of the nice things about the Super Bowl 
is that it’s a place where you go. ...” He didn’t finish that thought, 
just connected it to another. “We’ve been on the road awhile; we’re some
 old soldiers.”<br>
<br>
During a news conference that was billed as the band’s first since 1987 
and was nothing short of hilarious, the Boss reminded the guitarist Nils
 Lofgren (I can admit to owning one of his distant solo albums, the 
vinyl kind) that he was not supposed to say that as a resident of 
Scottsdale, Ariz., he will be rooting for the Cardinals to beat the 
Steelers.<br>
<br>
Not in the contract, Springsteen said with deft comic timing. But who 
knows, maybe we’ll get lucky and there will be at least one bold moment 
Sunday night when Springsteen goes rogue and rails against — oh, I don’t
 know — offensive Wall Street bonuses, $18.4 billion worth.<br>
<br>
Go ahead, Bruce, make those corporate fat cats squirm on their sofas. 
It’s a one-time forum — make a lasting impression. One thing is certain:
 whatever he may say, he is capable of something far more disquieting 
than the disrobing of the woman in his band, even if Patti Scialfa 
happens to be his wife.<br>
<br>
I’ve always thought the Super Bowl and especially its halftime show was,
 with rare exceptions, a waste of the country’s rapt attention. But 
politics and paychecks aside, give the N.F.L. some credit for getting 
the right band for a moment in America when everyone could use some 
impassioned and lyrical reminding of what Springsteen writes beautifully
 of — daily life struggles.<br>
<br>
When the Boss got a reluctant Van Zandt to take the microphone, Silvio 
of “The Sopranos” said, “I think one of the things that we’re kind of 
proud of is that there’s a certain inspirational quality to what we do, 
and that’s because of when we grew up, we had the high standards of the 
’60s.”<br>
<br>
Say what you will about the flaws of that decade, at least it generated 
longstanding ideals more resonant than ever as of two weeks ago. And 
after a news conference in which normally skeptical reporters sat at the
 edge of their seats and took cellphone photos of Springsteen and the 
other seven members of the band, it occurred to me that this was a 
pretty good match after all.<br>
<br>
While the saxophonist Clarence Clemons played football in school (which,
 according to Springsteen, explained his cane), the Boss last recalled 
having a fling in his backyard “around the summer of 1958.” Not a 
problem; his band has been a long-running dynasty in its own right, 
together almost 40 years, with its most junior members, Lofgren and 
Scialfa, in for the last 25.<br>
<br>
“Imagine you’re working alongside the same people you were with in high 
school, for 40 years or so and keeping that together,” Springsteen said.
 “It’s the long, long ride — that’s what it’s all about.”<br>
<br>
Sounds like a speech a Super Bowl coach would want to deliver Sunday 
evening in the pregame locker room after months of surviving the brutal 
N.F.L. season. Mercenaries, deliver your messages!<br>
<br>

<strong class="text-strong">The Boss Takes Over Halftime, With a Few Edits but Little Imagination<br>
The New York Times<br>
 <br>
By JON CARAMANICA<br>
Published: February 1, 2009</strong><br>
<br>
To Bruce Springsteen’s credit, he made it clear from the start that his 
performance with the E Street Band at the halftime show of Super Bowl 
XLIII on Sunday night was business, not personal.<br>
“We have a new album coming out,” he said in a news conference Thursday.
 “We have our mercenary reasons, of course.” That album, “Working on a 
Dream” (Columbia), was released Tuesday. Presales for Springsteen’s 
coming tour with the E Street Band begin Monday.<br>
<br>
Springsteen, now 59 and for many years the Boss, has had a good deal of 
face time lately, headlining a pre-inauguration concert last month for 
President Obama in front of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall. 
But in his news conference, Springsteen seemed far more ambivalent about
 this performance, an opportunity he said he had passed up in previous 
years. In part, that’s because accepting the gig comes with built-in 
boundaries.<br>
<br>
Five years have passed since the fateful day in Houston when, with the 
help of Justin Timberlake, Janet Jackson’s wardrobe malfunctioned, 
revealing, in part, her nipple and, in whole, a puritan streak that has 
clouded subsequent Super Bowl halftime affairs.<br>
<br>
And so while shilling does not carry the sting it once did, perhaps 
Springsteen let the weight of responsibility limit his imagination in 
his 12-minute set.<br>
<br>
The Rolling Stones, in 2006, and Prince, in 2007, managed to inject 
spice and surprise into their performances. But Springsteen’s tweaks 
were far gentler and safer, poking fun at the event itself, and possibly
 at himself for participating in it.<br>
<br>
He rose to the occasion, but never above it. And Springsteen, a reliable
 left-winger — when he described his band’s sound as “righteous,” it had
 a splash of double-meaning grit — didn’t use his platform to advocate 
for anything more pressing than louder volume.<br>
<br>
“I want you to step back from the guacamole dip, I want you to put the 
chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” he said, 
pointing into a camera. “And what I want to know is, is there anybody 
alive out there?”<br>
<br>
Or maybe more specifically, is there anyone paying close enough 
attention to notice that in each of the band’s four songs — “Tenth 
Avenue Freeze-Out,” “Born to Run,” “Working on a Dream” and “Glory Days”
 — verses were dropped altogether?<br>
<br>
The edits didn’t prove to be a liability. Springsteen appeared in good 
cheer throughout, sliding across the stage on his knees (and into a 
camera) at the end of “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,” and singing a collegial
 duet with the guitarist Steven Van Zandt on an ecstatic “Glory Days.”<br>
<br>
“Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” was warm and bluesy, with Springsteen building
 up energy for “Born to Run,” which concluded with a spectacular burst 
of fireworks. For the measured “Working on a Dream,” Springsteen was 
backed, in triangle formation, by Van Zandt and Patti Scialfa (also 
Springsteen’s wife), all of them flanked by a gospel choir, the set’s 
most heavy-handed moment. (Springsteen’s performance was as notable for 
what he didn’t play — the reliable party anthem “Dancing in the Dark,” 
the cynical but hugely popular “Born in the U.S.A.”)<br>
<br>
Lyrically, Springsteen made a couple of concessions to the event. In 
“Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” he sang, “I’m going to sit back right easy and
 laugh, when Scooter and the Big Man” — that’s Springsteen and the 
saxophonist Clarence Clemons — “bust the Super Bowl in half.” (In the 
original, “this city” is cleaved.)<br>
<br>
And on “Glory Days,” Springsteen changed the antihero of his opening 
verse from a baseball pitcher to a football quarterback. The “speedball”
 that could “make you look like a fool, boy,” became a “Hail Mary.”<br>
<br>
It turns out the early protestations were overstated; this show wasn’t 
even close to the worst collision of art and commerce to occur between 
bursts of pigskin. That would be the Pepsi ad featuring Bob Dylan and 
the rapper-producer Will.i.am performing Dylan’s “Forever Young” (or the
 country music star Faith Hill singing, during the show’s introduction, 
“Super Bowl Sunday on NBC/Al and John” — Michaels and Madden, that is — 
“are the best on TV”).<br>
<br>
But the final discomforts were all Springsteen’s. At the end of the 
show, he shouted inexplicably, “I’m going to Disneyland!” A moment 
earlier, a man dressed as a referee appeared on stage, threw a yellow 
flag and crossed his arms in front of Springsteen, the signal for delay 
of game. Springsteen mock fretted about the ticking clock, and Van Zandt
 protested, screaming, “It’s Boss time!” Except that it wasn’t, and 
everyone knew it.</div>
