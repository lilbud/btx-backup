BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN'S CONCERT SHOWED WHY THE RIVER IS AS RELEVANT AS EVER<br>
<br>
BY JASON KEILFRIDAY, <br>
MARCH 11, 2016 </strong><br>
<br>
Why would Bruce Springsteen want to revisit the more-than 35-year-old album The River?<br>
<br>
I asked myself the above question as the New Jersey-based 
singer-songwriter, accompanied by his incomparable E Street Band, played
 the 20 songs on the breakthrough double album in chronological order to
 a sold-out crowd at Talking Stick Resort Arena. Springsteen, who was 
once heralded as the future of rock ’n’ roll, asked the audience if they
 were ready to be transformed. Yet when the band launched into “The Ties
 The Bind,” I feared we would only be reliving the past.<br>
<br>
The themes Springsteen tackled with The River in 1980 haven’t gone away.
 Things aren’t any easier now than they were three-and-a-half decades 
ago.<br>
The River isn’t considered a concept album, but it spoke to a generation
 who saw the American Dream slipping away from them. There are songs 
that tackle the subjects of middle-class life, sex, and responsibilities
 that come with growing up. Springsteen explained to the audience that 
he considers The River, with its weighty themes and dark undertones, his
 “coming-of-age album.” He said he wrote the song “Independence Day” 
about parents who had their own hopes and ambitions, only to feel 
frustration when their aspirations didn’t come true.<br>
<br>
It felt like the E Street Band members were playing onstage roles in the
 stories Springsteen was strumming. Occasionally, guitarist Steven Van 
Zandt would sneak up behind Springsteen to join him on vocals for 
“Hungry Heart.” Springsteen dedicated "I Wanna Marry You" to his wife, 
Patti Scialfa, who wasn't in attendance. Jake Clemons, taking over on 
saxophone for his legendary late uncle Clarence Clemons, showed off some
 amazing footwork during “Ramrod.” They displayed an amazing chemistry 
that comes after more than 45 years working together.<br>
<br>
Soozie Tyrell's fiddle and Van Zandt's restrained acoustic guitar gave 
the title track’s story of a couple rushing into the world of adulthood 
more poignance. Springsteen didn't sing “The River” with any twinges of 
irony or nostalgia, but with a strong sense of urgency. When Springsteen
 resurrected the album, he must have been aware that history was 
repeating itself. Americans are slowly climbing out of a recession. 
Working families feel like they’ve been lied to by the government and 
the corporations that employ them. "The River" would not feel out of 
place in the present day.<br>
<br>
As he crooned “The Price You Pay,” it became clear why Springsteen 
wanted to revisit the album that made him a superstar. The themes he 
tackled in 1980 haven’t gone away. Things aren’t any easier now than 
they were three-and-a-half decades ago. There were even moments when I 
thought he was speaking directly to me, knowing I was someone who was 
facing burdens of my own. I’ve been an adult for many years now, and I 
want to try to do something meaningful with my life. Springsteen’s 
lyrics inspire us to make the attempt.<br>
<br>
The Boss’ voice sounded weary as he ended the The River portion of the 
show with “Wreck On The Highway,” but his second wind blew in quick. (He
 thanked a doctor for helping him with some voice problems he was 
having.) The E Street Band wasted no time tearing into old classics like
 “Badlands” and “She’s The One,” but it was hometown hero Nils Lofgren 
who stole the show with his jaw-dropping guitar solo on “Because The 
Night.” The Valley resident showed off his chops as he spun around the 
stage like Superman, attempting to go back in time to take the song back
 from Patti Smith.<br>
<br>
The three hour-plus show wrapped up with Springsteen pulling some tweens
 from the audience at the end of “Dancing In The Dark.” He dedicated 
“Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)” to those who were there back in the 1970s 
and “Tenth Avenue Freezeout” to Clarence Clemons, who passed away in 
2011. Just when the crowd thought the show was over, the band played a 
cover of The Isley Brothers’ “Shout!”<br>
<br>
As Springsteen had promised, I had left transformed.</div>

Bruce Springsteen</strong> <br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen brought the E Street Band to Phoenix Thursday night to
 re-explore “The River,” the chart-topping two-record triumph the singer
 recorded in the aftermath of “Darkness on the Edge of Town” as he was 
entering his 30s.<br>
<br>
After setting the tone with “Meet Me in the City,” a rousing outtake 
featured on “The Ties That Bind: The River Collection,” an older, wiser 
Springsteen talked about “The River” as “a record where I was trying to 
figure out where I fit in” while making time for dancing, laughter, joy 
and sex.<br>
<br>
“I want you to join us 35 summers later,” Springsteen told the crowd at 
Talking Stick Resort Arena. “Let’s go down to ‘The River’ and see what 
we find.”<br>
<br>
And with that, they dove into an album Nils Lofgren told me he remembers
 hearing at the time, before he’d joined the band, and thinking it felt 
like the first time they’d finally gotten “the sizzle and the 
electricity” of their live performance into the grooves of the record.<br>
<br>
<br>
There was plenty of sizzle and electricity in Thursday’s live 
performance of the album, in some cases more than they managed to 
capture in those grooves as young men — thanks in large part to the 
criminally underrated drumming of the great Max Weinberg and in part to 
the enthusiasm Springsteen has invested in the process of establishing a
 re-connection with this music.<br>
<br>
The E Street Band was in fine form, a three-guitar army with three 
completely different types of lead guitarists (Springsteen, Lofgren and,
 of course, Little Steven Van Zandt), two great keyboard players (Roy 
Bittan and touring member Charles Giordano) and 26-year-old Jake Clemons
 still doing an excellent job of honoring his uncle, Clarence Clemons. 
But it goes beyond the playing to the ties that bind these guys 
together. There's a chemistry that can't be faked when Bruce and Little 
Steven share a microphone. Even when it couldn't be more obvious that 
those moments are staged, it feels sincere. Because it's Springsteen.<br>
<br>
“The River” has some of the rowdiest songs in Springsteen’s catalog. And
 the pacing of the album allowed them to follow a rollicking “Out in the
 Street” with the punkish abandon of “Crush On You” and an even more 
electrifying “You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch).”<br>
<br>
It wouldn’t be a stretch to hear those moments — and “Cadillac Ranch” 
and “I’m a Rocker” and several others — as Springsteen filtering his 
fondness for the early days of rock and roll through the aesthetic of 
the punk and New Wave era in which those songs were born. He did write 
“Hungry Heart” for the Ramones (although, ironically, that isn't one of 
those moments).<br>
<br>
But “The River” wouldn’t hold up as a framework for a proper Springsteen
 concert if it didn’t offer more that, if it didn’t allow for the drama 
of the title track and “Point Blank” or the tenderness of a soulful 
“Fade Away,” the romantic longing of “I Wanna Marry You,” a song about 
the kind of love you dream about before you really know what love is all
 about.<br>
<br>
As Springsteen told the crowd, “You always dream of the kind of love 
that comes without consequences, without struggle and without 
responsibility. It’s the kind that doesn’t exist.”<br>
<br>
A Springsteen concert thrives on opportunities for sharing, which he did
 in setting up the song that provided the concert’s emotional highlight,
 a melancholy “Independence Day,” as the kind of song you write when 
you’re young and all you can see when you look at your parents are the 
compromises they had to make to get there.<br>
<br>
“You’re too young to see the blessings that come with that compromise,” 
Springsteen continued. “And the whole idea of the world closing in just 
frightens you and all you want to do is get out, get out, get out from 
under. So I had a simple setting for this song. It was just a late-night
 conversation around the kitchen table between two people that loved 
each other but were struggling to understand one another.”<br>
<br>
Of course, he followed that touching performance of “Independence Day” 
by crowd-surfing to “Hungry Heart.” But Springsteen concerts need those 
moments, too.<br>
<br>
It felt like he was pouring everything he ever loved about the history 
of soul into that vocal on “The Price You Pay” as “The River” pulled 
into the final stretch, where an epic “Drive All Night” was followed by a
 suitably haunted rendition of “Wreck on the Highway,” the existential 
meditation that brings the album to a powerful conclusion. Springsteen 
ended the song by sharing his thoughts on what “The River” was really 
all about and maybe why he’s chosen to revisit that particular album.<br>
<br>
“The River,” he said is about “how you learn the adult life and you 
choose your partner and you choose your work and that clock starts 
ticking and you walk alongside not only the people you’ve chosen to live
 your life with but you walk alongside of your own mortality and you 
realize you have a limited amount of time to raise your family, to do 
your job, to try and do something good. That’s ‘The River.’”<br>
<br>
It's also a really long album. But in the course of a 
three-and-a-half-hour concert, that still left plenty of time for 
Springsteen and the E Street Band to look beyond “The River,” bringing 
the show to a rousing finale while making their way through some of 
Springsteen’s finest work, including a triumphant “Badlands,” “No 
Surrender,” “Candy’s Room,” “Because the Night,” “She’s the One” and 
“Thunder Road.” And then you had the six-song encore that started with a
 fan request for “Glory Days” and featured such crowd-pleasing 
highlights as “Born to Run,” “Dancing in the Dark,”  “Rosalita (Come Out
 Tonight) and “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” (which featured a tribute to the
 late great Big Man, Clarence Clemons, ending the night on a spirited 
high note with a playful version of the Isley Brothers’ “Shout.”<br>
<br>
At 66, the singer's voice has clearly aged a bit since the recording of 
"The River." He can't hit the high notes like he used to, which explains
 the altered melody on "Born to Run." But he made up for it with his 
delivery. The phrasing on "The Price You Pay" was brilliant, a soulful, 
conversational approach that brought out every nuance of the lyrics. And
 he belted out the rockers with reckless abandon and total conviction 
while squeezing every last drop of emotion out of "Independence Day.</div>

By Roman Gokhman<br>
San Jose Mercury<br>
March 14, 2016</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen’s 20-song opus The River means many things to people, 
but The Boss himself gave two explanations for the meaning of his fifth 
album — originally released in 1980 and revisited in-full on his current
 trek — during a stop at the sold-out Oracle Arena Sunday night.<br>
<br>
The first explanation, which he talked about prior to tearing into 
opening track “The Ties That Bind,” came from the perspective of a young
 Springsteen. He talked about how he wanted the record to be big, like 
his band’s live shows, and to be about many things: dancing, faith, 
love, sex, and so much more. “The River was my coming of age record,” 
The Boss said. “I was trying to find my way inside.” The second 
viewpoint came from an older, wiser songwriter as the final notes 
sounded on album closer “Wreck on the Highway.”<br>
<br>
“The River was about time...slipping away,” he said. “You choose your 
partner and your own worth....You have limited time to raise your family
 and do something good.” Both explanations true, all that was left was 
to play the songs, which Springsteen and his famed E Street Band did to 
perfection.<br>
<br>
Walking out to fully on house lights and a steady chorus of 
“Bruuuuuuuuuuce” chants, Springsteen and his eight-member band 
(guitarist and Springsteen’s wife, Patti Scialfa, not among them on this
 night) jumped straight into “Meet Me In The City Tonight,” an 
unreleased track originally written between 1979 and 1980, and 
unsurprisingly, just as good as classic Springsteen of that era.<br>
<br>
The River followed, in order. From “Sherry Darling,” the second album 
track, Springsteen worked the crowd from the front of the stage (there 
was no barricade, allowing him to be right on top of fans), as well as a
 walkway toward the middle of the floor. Whenever he needed to get from 
the stage to the walkway, he would climb down onto the floor, alongside 
the thousand-plus there. The stage itself was three-tiered, allowing 
fans in the wings of the arena, as well as the back, to get closer to 
The Boss.<br>
<br>
Even at 66, Springsteen was willing to crowdsurf over hundreds of heads 
during “Hungry Heart,” proving the trust in his fans in ways other 
artists, especially those closer to his age, don’t anymore. Not to be 
outdone, The E Street Band was everything they should have been, shining
 in every opportunity.<br>
<br>
During the River tracks, the band mostly worked from one song to the 
next without much dialogue. Hearing the inspirations for some of the 
songs would have been nice, and would have broken up a bit of monotony 
of the last five songs of the main set, which dragged a little. The 
slight lag made sense because the second half of the album consists 
mostly of ballads. But the intensity with which Springsteen approached 
each song, like a young artist with something to prove, more than made 
up for it.<br>
<br>
The one song that got an aside was “I Want To Marry You,” which 
Springsteen described as “more of a daydream of love...the kind that 
doesn’t exist (but) you gotta start someplace.”<br>
<br>
Because this was a Springsteen show, the length of the encore alone was 
longer than many bands’ entire performances. Without even heading 
backstage for the customary break, the E Street Band tore into 14 more 
songs: hits like “Born To Run,” “Badlands,” and “Dancing in the Dark”; 
lesser-known gems like “Lonesome Day”; and a fan request, 1973’s 
“Growing Up.” The Boss invited two young fans onto the stage during this
 time, one to conduct the crowd and the other to dance. With a show 
topper, a 10-minute rendition of the Isley Brothers’ “Shout” — during 
which Springsteen demonstrated dancing chops of his own — the concert 
clocked in at just under 3.5 hours.</div>

Live Review: A Springsteen Virgin Goes To His First Boss Show<br>
Posted By Willie Clark <br>
SF Weekly Notebook<br>
Mon, Mar 14, 2016 </strong><br>
<br>
* Oh down to the river we'd ride...<br>
<br>
* It was cold, wet, and rainy as I made it down to the Oracle Area in 
Oakland on Sunday night to see Bruce Springsteen’s The River Tour, a 
celebration of The Boss's titular 1980 album of the same name.<br>
<br>
* In the grand scheme of things, I’m a casual Springsteen fan — and a 
new one at that. Sure, I finally added "Born to Run" and "Born in the 
U.S.A." to my collection a few years back, but if Springsteenism is a 
religion, I'm a new convert that shows up to services just for Easter 
and Christmas. <br>
<br>
* Before the show, I had actually never listened to The River (although I
 did yesterday to prep for the concert), and this was my first time 
seeing The Boss live. I wasn't sure what to expect — perhaps a quiz show
 testing my fandom before I was allowed to take my seat? I know of the 
Stony Pony at least...that has to count for something. I also knew 
Springsteen has a reputation for marathon-length sets. Even my car 
breaking down earlier this week (ironic, given Springsteen's many odes 
to wheels) wasn't going to stop me from making it. <br>
<br>
Arena shows in general, though, are also a tad out of my normal 
show-going element. Even the idea of seeing a show in a seat seemed 
little weird to me — I'm more used to being in the front row getting hit
 in the back of the head by a rouge crowd surfer. <br>
<br>
But, seeing a violin and accordion on stage was a good sign. Those are 
instruments I can get behind, and I'm pretty sure I'm more of a fan of 
Springsteen's folksier stuff, though I probably haven't listened to 
enough of his stuff to definitively say that. And sadly, the accordion 
never made an appearance during the set. Sad face.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I was a bit surprised too, as I took my seat shortly after the doors 
opened, with how thin the crowd looked. Springsteen fans (and there was a
 lottery just to get into the pit, which is crazy to me) are diehards, 
or so I thought, and I expected more of a preshow commotion. <br>
<br>
Sure enough the arena filled up, and the first big scream happened about
 five minutes before the planned 8 p.m. showtime. I was still surprised 
with just how casual the atmosphere felt; it wasn't the anxious 
fan-fueled energy I was expecting. Sure, most of the people in the crowd
 were probably well past their throwing-panties-on-stage days, but the 
concert felt more like a casual gathering of people coming to hang out 
at an old friend's house than the rabid Springsteen fans I had heard 
about. (It didn't help that everybody seemed to keep running into people
 that they knew, but that could have been the area I was sitting in). <br>
<br>
At 8:30 p.m. on the dot (a half hour late, though, I should add), 
Springsteen and the rest of the E Street Band took the stage. Nobody 
opens for The Boss, apparently. I thought the cheering was loud for the 
individual band members...until Springsteen came out.<br>
<br>
"Are you ready to be entertained?" the 66-year-old New Jersey native 
asked the crowd. He opened the show with "Meet Me In The City," and 
talked about how The River was his coming of age record, and how it was 
about the things that binds people to their lives. <br>
<br>
Initially, Springsteen's vocals were a little too echoey in the large 
space of the arena, but that little problem seemed to improve as the 
night went on. The crowd began to sway and bob, and I must say, people 
dancing to Springsteen makes for some great people watching. It's an 
awkward and unique dance combined with some weird gyrations and people 
attempting to play air drums and keyboard. It's something else. But I 
digress...<br>
<br>
Before "Independence Day," Springsteen talked about how it was the first
 song he wrote about fathers and sons, and the type of song you write 
when you are young and shocked by your parents' humanity and the idea 
that they had dreams that maybe didn't turn out or compromises they had 
to make. It's about, he said, being too young to see the blessings that 
come with compromise.<br>
<br>
The violin was hard to hear on that track — as it was in the mix for 
most of the songs — and, as that's one of my pet peeves in particular, 
I'm going to be a stickler on that point. Let that fiddle sing!<br>
<br>
After "Independence Day," the crowd seemingly woke up for "Hungry 
Heart." Springsteen handed the song off to the crowd, who probably ended
 up singing more of it than he did. And then Springsteen actually crowd 
surfed. It was one of the most careful and slow-motion crowd surfs ever 
(after all, nobody wants to be the asshole who accidentally drops The 
Boss). But younger bands take note: If Springsteen can still get out 
there and crowd surf, you have no excuse. <br>
<br>
Springsteen had everything crowd interaction-wise figured out, actually.
 The pit was carefully constructed to give him areas to get close to 
fans and walk in the middle of the two floor standing areas, where he 
would shake hands. (He even pulled up two different people to join him 
on stage over the course of the night.)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Things slowed down again for "I Wanna Marry You," which Springsteen 
explained was about the easiest kind of love: the type without the 
consequences and responsibilities (in other words, the kind that doesn't
 exist). He then quipped about it being an old crowd and said that he 
could tell that by how loud people laughed at that.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
One hour in, we hit the title track, "The River," as Springsteen and the
 E Street Band continued their quest to take an 80-minute album and 
stretch it out over the course of a two hour of set time. <br>
<br>
As the concert approached Lord of the Rings-length territory (the total 
concert came in just around three and a half hours), I realized that all
 of Springsteen's songs fall into one of two patterns: Really slow 
songs, and medium tempo 4/4 rock songs. And, given that every song 
pretty much dragged on as long as possible, the concert became more like
 the gradual lapping of the river than it should have been, and probably
 not the type of comparison Springsteen was hoping to get from the 
tour's namesake. <br>
<br>
In other words, I can only hear —yes, even from the Boss — a 1,2,3,4 
count off and then a jangly key intro heading into another similar tempo
 and similar sounding song before things run together and lose their 
effectiveness. I mean, even the girl next to me nodded off during the 
show. <br>
<br>
To wrap The River portion of the evening (before going into another 
hour-plus of other tracks) Springsteen talked about how the album was 
about adult life, choosing a partner and career, seeing the clock tick 
away as you walk alongside your own mortality, and the limited amount of
 time to do work and raise a family and try to do something good. It's 
deep stuff to ponder and I commend The Boss for getting philosophical 
with the crowd. He then went into more familiar territory, including 
"Thunder Road," "Born to Run," and "10th Avenue Freeze Out," before 
closing the night with a cover of The Isley Brothers' "Shout."<br>
<br>
But for me? I was disappointed, and after everything I've heard over the
 years, I was expecting one of the best shows I've ever seen — and I'm 
honestly not even sure if this would crack my top five. <br>
<br>
I wanted more of that live energy that separates the performance from 
album recordings. More stuff like the drum fill during "Badlands." 
&nbsp;It wasn't that everything felt over-rehearsed, it was just perhaps
 a bit safe and similar, even if playing The River front to back was 
probably a risk in and of itself. <br>
<br>
Even "Thunder Road" was a slower and more subdued version than the 
recording, and what I really wanted was those live, raw, and explosive 
moments that make a show, you know, a live performance, and not just 
subtle changes to your repertoire that only fans who have seen you 50 
times before will notice. I like Springsteen's music, but that live 
reputation that preceded him just wasn't there for me tonight.<br>
<br>
Maybe The River Tour wasn't a good first time introduction to The Boss 
live. Maybe I haven't spent enough time in New Jersey. Maybe I don't 
like Springsteen as much as I thought, and certainty not enough for the 
hundreds of dollars it can cost to see him live. Maybe three and a half 
hours of Springsteen is just too much for casual listeners, and now that
 I can cross him off my musical bucket list, maybe I've gotten my 
Springsteen fill for some time to come. <br>
<br>
But, sadly, I wasn't blown away like I thought I would be. The River Tour left me, well...dry. <br>

<strong class="text-strong">Critic’s Notebook</strong><br>
<br>
-There were so many people who were talking about just having gone to 
the Phoenix show, and also were heading to the L.A. one next. That’s 
dedication, folks. <br>
<br>
-I overheard someone else mention that Springsteen didn’t run around as much as he used to, so it wasn’t just me. <br>
<br>
-I also overheard someone say how awesome it was that Springsteen and 
company played “hard and heavy metal” and I’m just so flabbergasted by 
that comment I can’t even start to respond. Eye roll. <br>
<br>
-Saw two Stone Pony tee-shirts, and a lot of Springsteen ones, but not as many as I was expecting, actually. <br>
<br>
-Man, this was one of the whitest concerts ever.<br>
<br>
-I'm already way over word count, but watching Springsteen super fans is
 hilarious. Two Bruce bros bonded in front of me, and even the girls 
next to me were laughing at the super fan in front of us who kept 
looking around trying to find someone else who was on his level and 
could shout songs back at him.<br>
<br>
-Every member of the E Street Band found a way to contribute to every 
song, it seemed, which is another big concert pet peeve of mine that I 
was glad to see them address. <br>
<br>
-Seriously though, I swear most Springsteen songs are the same tempo. <br>

-My mom told me she had heard good things about Springsteen's show back 
home in Rochester, but that she didn’t think he was my type of music. 
Should have listened. Moms are always right.</div>

Review: Bruce Springsteen dives into 'The River'<br>
By Jim Harrington<br>
The Daily Democrat<br>
Marc 14, 2016<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen draws a line between "The River" and everything that came before it.<br>
<br>
"`The River' was my coming-of-age record," the Rock and Roll Hall of 
Famer told the capacity crowd of some 18,000 fans on Sunday at the 
Oracle Arena in Oakland. "Tonight, come with us back down to 'The River'
 and let's see what we find."<br>
<br>
With that introduction, the man known to millions as "The Boss" and his 
mighty E Street Band embarked on an amazing musical journey -- 
performing 1980's two-disc "The River" from start to finish. It took 
them roughly two hours to swim all the way through "The River," before 
turning their attention to other material.<br>
<br>
It was a dream show for the big Boss fans in the house, the ones who 
might've been waiting decades to finally witness such "River" rarities 
as "Stolen Car" and "Crush on You" performed in concert. I guess when 
you've heard "Born to Run" and "Dancing in the Dark" played a thousand 
times before, you just plain want something different -- even if the 
song doesn't rank among Bruce's best.<br>
<br>
However, it was probably a very perplexing, perhaps even infuriating, 
concert for the rookie fans, who want to hear Springsteen play the hits 
and nothing but the hits. Instead, they got the twisting, turbulent 
"River," which isn't exactly the singer-songwriter-guitarist's most 
easily accessible record.<br>
<br>
As the house lights dimmed, Springsteen dove right into "The River" with
 a strong version of "The Ties That Bind" and then kept moving through 
decent takes on "Sherry Darling" and "Jackson Cage." Springsteen had 
completely locked into the material by end of Side One, delivering a 
slow, somber and altogether mesmerizing take on "Independence Day," 
which the singer-songwriter introduced as "the kind of song you write 
when you are young."<br>
<br>
The album "The River," while not without a small handful of flaws, 
certainly has a lot going for it. It's well-paced in many different 
ways, offering up a nice balance of slow and fast, light and dark, bold 
and beautiful -- and all of those things translated on the live stage.<br>
<br>
The 66-year-old New Jersey native, who looked and sounded great, did 
take the time to occasionally play tour guide, telling intriguing 
stories between songs and shedding much light on the music. It slowed 
down the evening a bit, but the insight was worth it. Indeed, I wish 
Springsteen had been in an even more talkative mood.<br>
<br>
"The River" peaked with its title track, which closes out Side 2 and 
still stands among Springsteen's crowning achievements. Other highlights
 included the fun singalong "Hungry Heart," the intense "Point Blank" 
and the troubled closer "Wreck on the Highway."<br>
<br>
Having finished "The River," Springsteen and his band stuck around for 
another 1 hours (approximately) and 14 songs. Yes, that's right - 14 
songs. That's more than some bands play in an entire concert.<br>
<br>
This segment was payback for all the listeners who could've cared less 
about hearing some "River" obscurity like "The Price You Pay." The Boss 
stuck to the A-list material, igniting the crowd with such longtime 
favorites as "Badlands," "Thunder Road" and "Prove It All Night."<br>
<br>
The band was playing with a freedom -- a kind of refreshing, reckless 
abandon -- as it continued through "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" and other 
cuts. The guitar also grew more noticeable in the mix, with E Streeter 
Nils Lofgren providing the single most electrifying moment of the night 
with his lead on "Because the Night."</div>

<br>
Randy Lewis<br>
The LA Times<br>
March 16, 2016</strong><br>
<br>
	<br>
In the pursuit of the things that matter most in life, “half measures 
avail us nothing,” states an adage that Bruce Springsteen seems to have 
had in mind when he made “The River,” the 1980 double album he’s 
revisiting on his new tour, three dozen years down the line.<br>
<br>
It’s perhaps his most ambitious album, certainly his most sprawling -- a
 musically and thematically varied work he described as “my coming of 
age” album shortly taking the stage Tuesday in the first of his three 
sold-out nights in Los Angeles.<br>
<br>
As many Springsteen aficionados know, to follow 1978’s “Darkness on the 
Edge of Town,” The Boss originally delivered a single album that was to 
be called “The Ties That Bind.” After having second thoughts about what 
he was really after, he withdrew it and returned to the studio to 
continue working.<br>
<br>
“[Why] put out something that you don’t feel is what it should be,” he 
told an interviewer in 1981, “or that you feel -- and I don’t believe in
 tomorrows -- that ‘Oh, I’ll put the other half out six months from 
now.’<br>
<br>
“You don’t know what’s gonna be happening six months from now. You may 
be dead, you just don’t know. It’s like from the very beginning, I just 
never believed in doing things that way. You make your record like it’s 
the last record you’ll ever make.”<br>
<br>
Those comments are cited in Mikal Gilmore’s opening essay for the book 
accompanying the recent CD/DVD box set exploring that period in 
Springsteen’s life, “The Ties That Bind: The River Collection.”<br>
<br>
He and the venerable E Street Band are performing “The River” in its 
entirety during the first part of the new round of shows. That’s 
something they didn’t do when it was released and became Springsteen’s 
first album to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, holding 
that slot for four weeks and also giving him his first top-10 hit 
single, “Hungry Heart.”<br>
<br>
Far from mere nostalgia, the show was a richly illuminated traversal 
exploring what happens when the dreams and idealism of youth run 
headlong up against the realities of adulthood and the compromises that 
come with it.<br>
<br>
The youthful ideal of love, for instance, as Springsteen said early in 
the set, “is the easiest kind of love. The kind without consequences. 
The kind without responsibility,” and then, adding with a laugh, “the 
kind that doesn’t exist.”<br>
<br>
There’s a through-the-looking-glass facet to these shows, both for 
Springsteen and the many fans who came of age with him through these 
songs 36 years ago.<br>
<br>
He was just entering his 30s, and most of his fans were in their 20s and
 30s at that time. Now 66, Springsteen often finds himself on the other 
side of the table of the songs he wrote about coming to terms with what 
he called “the realization that we have a limited time to do our jobs, 
to raise our families and to try to do some good along the way.”<br>
<br>
“Independence Day,” for example, takes on a very different tone being 
sung by the 66-year-old father of three, than when he sang it as a 
30-year-old single rock star on the rise:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Now I don’t know what it always was with us<br>
We chose the words, and yeah, we drew the lines<br>
There was just no way this house could hold the two of us<br>
I guess that we were just too much of the same kind</em><br>
<br>
The album’s title track became an even more haunted reflection of a 
dream derailed -- ”Then I got Mary pregnant, and man that was all she 
wrote,” which Springsteen capped with a mournful falsetto coda that 
communicated all the pain one human soul could endure.<br>
<br>
The master stroke of “The River” is the way Springsteen juxtaposed such 
anguish with the joy that life also can contain. He and the band also 
took the crowd along to pinnacles of ecstatic celebration in the likes 
of “Sherry Darling,” which gave saxophonist Jake Clemons a great 
opportunity to salute his late uncle, Clarence Clemons, and “I Wanna 
Marry You,” “I’m a Rocker,” “Cadillac Ranch” and “Out in the Street.”<br>
<br>
Following the two hours it took to traverse “The River” from beginning 
to end, Springsteen and the band then shifted into overdrive for a 
second half that ran almost an additional 90 minutes.<br>
<br>
It began with “Badlands,” and continued across his catalog to touch on 
“The Rising,” “Human Touch” (in a sweet duet with his wife, 
singer-guitarist Patti Scialfa, during which they went nose to nose on a
 single microphone), “Because the Night,” “She’s the One,” “No 
Surrender,” “Thunder Road,” “Born to Run,” “Dancing in the Dark” and, 
yes, “Rosalita” “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and even a show-capping, 
rafter-rattling rendition of the Isley Brothers’ “Shout.”<br>
<br>
His shows at the Sports Arena hold an extra measure of emotion as they 
constitute the swan song for the 59-year-old facility he’s played 
repeatedly since his first performances there in 1980 on the original 
tour for “The River.”<br>
<br>
It’s a venue he’s fondly dubbed “The Dump That Jumps,” a nickname 
enshrined on banners posted outside and inside the arena for these 
shows, and “The Joint That Don’t Disappoint,” among others.<br>
<br>
In recognition of its impending destruction, Springsteen dedicated a 
song to the venue: the title track from his 2012 album “Wrecking Ball.”<br>
<br>
He plays two more performances at the Sports Arena on Thursday and Saturday.</div>

<br>
Mikael Wood<br>
Los Angeles Times<br>
March 15, 2016<br>
</strong><br>
On Tuesday night, Bruce Springsteen will begin a sold-out three-night 
stand at the L.A. Sports Arena. The shows will be the last concerts at 
the half-century-old venue in Exposition Park before it's razed to make 
room for a new soccer stadium.<br>
<br>
It's a familiar situation for the veteran rocker. In 2009, Springsteen 
played a string of five concerts at New Jersey's Giants Stadium before 
the place was demolished. He even wrote a song for the occasion, 
"Wrecking Ball," sung from the perspective of a building "raised out of 
steel here in the swamps of Jersey some misty years ago."<br>
<br>
But at a moment when new rock music is the least visible it's ever been —
 thoroughly overshadowed in the mainstream by pop, country, hip-hop and 
dance music — is nostalgia the only viable path forward?<br>
<br>
As one of rock's most historically attuned performers, Springsteen is a 
natural choice to close down the Sports Arena, having first played there
 in 1980 in support of that year's "The River" album. Since then, he's 
revisited the venue or the neighboring Memorial Coliseum dozens of times
 — enough to give the dilapidated arena his own nickname, "the Dump That
 Jumps."<br>
<br>
Still, you have to wonder whether it says something about the imperiled 
state of arena rock that Springsteen, 66, keeps closing these joints 
down. That goes double when you consider that his current tour isn't 
connected to a new record but to a revival of "The River," which was 
reissued last year in a lavish 35th-anniversary box set. (On the road, 
Springsteen and the E Street Band are playing "The River" in its 
entirety, then following that up with a set of hits.)<br>
<br>
Arena rock isn't a dead language yet. Last year, U2 toured the world 
playing most of the tunes on its latest album, "Songs of Innocence"; it 
even refashioned some vintage songs to more fully touch on current world
 events.<br>
<br>
For the band's stop in L.A., U2 played five nights at the Forum in 
Inglewood, that old-school arena-rock staple that's back in business 
these days after a vaunted $75-million renovation.<br>
<br>
And since it reopened in 2014, the Forum has shown night after night 
that guys with guitars can still fill a room with space for more than 
17,000. (Up next: a nearly sold-out show by Pink Floyd's David Gilmour 
on March 27.)<br>
<br>
That said, it wasn't hard to miss the anxiety among some fans on social 
media when a rumor circulated this month that the Foo Fighters were 
preparing to announce their breakup. The band, whose frontman, Dave 
Grohl, sparked speculation with a solo performance on the Academy 
Awards, posted a video online insisting that the Foos are staying 
together.<br>
<br>
But the feeling was palpable: As one of the very few young(ish) groups 
keeping the arena-rock tradition alive, the Foo Fighters simply have to 
stick around, people seemed to be saying. If they call it quits, who 
will pass the torch?<br>
<br>
As one of the very few young(ish) groups keeping the arena-rock 
tradition alive, the Foo Fighters simply have to stick around ... If 
they call it quits, who will pass the torch?<br>
<br>
You can tell that many veterans are worrying about their legacies 
because they keep trying out potential successors. That's what Queen did
 several years ago when it drafted Adam Lambert, the former "American 
Idol" runner-up, to fill in for the late Freddie Mercury. Members of the
 Grateful Dead got in on the act too, teaming with singer-songwriter 
John Mayer to form Dead &amp; Company, which brought its reanimated 
oldies to the Forum last year and will tour again this summer.<br>
<br>
If this kind of vampirism provides a bit of fresh blood, though, it's 
not really solving the bigger problem at hand, which is that so much of 
this music, even when it's raking in money, appears to have run out of 
new things to say.<br>
<br>
Nostalgia certainly wasn't on Springsteen's mind when he began making 
"The River." If anything, the singer, then about to turn 30, was looking
 ahead to the realities of middle age, as described in songs like "I 
Wanna Marry You," with its conviction that "true love can't be some 
fairy tale," and "Out in the Street," about anticipating the end of a 
grinding work week.<br>
<br>
In Rolling Stone, Springsteen recently called "The River" his "first 
insider record," saying that unlike his earlier albums, which reflected a
 "marginal community" on the Jersey Shore, this one consciously took up 
"those elements — marriage, work, love, faith, death — that you have in 
common with everyone else."<br>
<br>
Yet Springsteen's road show — along with plenty of others on which 
veteran acts are performing classic records from start to finish — seem 
designed for a smaller, self-selecting audience composed of folks with 
specific memories to stir. Along with that comes a kind of implicit 
surrender, as though the artists have given up trying to express 
something that might grab listeners more concerned with right now.<br>
<br>
Will Springsteen get fists pumping if he revs up "Wrecking Ball" this 
week at the Sports Arena? Of course — that's what the man does, even 
when he's not saying goodbye. But even the hardest-core Boss fan will 
have to wonder whether something more is under threat.</div>

<br>
Bruce Springsteen's four-hour finale at the L.A. Sports Arena: A fitting ending to 'The Dump That Jumps'<br>
Springsteen Sports Arena<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen looked out on Saturday's sold-out crowd at the Los 
Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. They were all witnesses for the last show
 to be performed there. "This is it!" he shouted. "They're expecting us 
to tear it down tonight."<br>
<br>
The 56-year-old arena will indeed be torn down to make way for a soccer 
stadium in Exposition Park. But for one last night, the place that 
Springsteen nicknamed "The Dump That Jumps" lived up to its unofficial 
title.<br>
<br>
As the four-hour concert neared its end, Springsteen dedicated his song 
"Wrecking Ball" to the facility. It was more than a rousing rock song. 
It marked the end of an era when the Sports Arena was the populist, 
egalitarian space for major events in L.A.<br>
<br>
"We've got to play this one for the old building," Springsteen 
announced. "We're gonna miss this place. It's a great place to play rock
 'n' roll."<br>
<br>
The aging structure wasn't the most storied place to see arena rock in 
L.A. — that would be the Fabulous Forum in Inglewood. For modern pop 
shows, it's Staples Center at L.A. Live, though some electronic acts and
 the DJs at the bustling FYF Fest regularly played the arena.<br>
<br>
But the Sports Arena, which could hold up more than 16,000 fans for a 
concert, always drew a certain kind of rock act that valued intimacy.<br>
<br>
It was the place where you could see the sweat on the guitarist's face 
and feel squalls of feedback from the cheap seats. No matter how much 
you paid for a ticket, you were always in the heaving mass of the crowd.<br>
<br>
"It was underused, but it was a great, great venue," said Paul Tollett, 
head of L.A.-based concert promoter Goldenvoice, which stages the annual
 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, Calif.<br>
<br>
Pink Floyd performed some of its first sets for "The Wall" there in 
1980. U2 played there in the '80s as it ascended to global-titan status 
with "The Joshua Tree," and Michael Jackson sold out six nights during 
his Bad tour in 1988-89. Fresh off its groundbreaking 2006 Coachella 
set, the Grammy-winning duo Daft Punk played there in 2007, helping 
spark the city's craze for electronic dance music.<br>
<br>
Springsteen made it a second home, playing there — as he estimated — 34 
times before Saturday's set. After headlining the opening engagement at 
Staples Center in 1999, Springsteen never played the newer downtown 
venue again, preferring the Sports Arena's scruffier, luxury box-free 
confines.<br>
<br>
For three shows last week, Springsteen and his stalwart E Street Band 
enlisted the Sports Arena as a stop on his tour revisiting his 1980 
album, "The River." That double LP vaulted him from a promising young 
singer-songwriter into both a commercial juggernaut and a definitive 
voice of American rock music.<br>
<br>
Springsteen played the Sports Arena when the record was first released, 
and he played the album in its entirety this time, along with a set of 
his greatest hits, such as "Dancing in the Dark" and "Born to Run." The 
coming-full-circle quality to the shows was intentional.<br>
<br>
"'The River' is about time," Springsteen said onstage. "And when you 
choose the people you're going to walk beside, you realize you're also 
walking alongside your own mortality."<br>
<br>
As Springsteen and his band raged onstage, it was evident in the crowd 
that more than three decades had indeed passed since he first performed 
songs from "The River." Two gray-haired, middle-aged men swapped 
marijuana-laced candy, just as they might have done with a weak joint in
 1980. A mom and her teenage daughter sneaked down to the loggia balcony
 and jumped up and down to every word of "Badlands" before security 
guards hustled them back upstairs.<br>
<br>
The prospect of one last blowout with Bruce quelled any melancholy about the Sports Arena's demise.<br>
<br>
"Oh, it's all excitement," said Marlayna Slaughterbeck of Whittier. "This is my first time seeing Bruce and my first time here."<br>
<br>
Brian Murphy, West Coast president for promoter AEG Live/Goldenvoice, 
felt a bit teary before the show. "It's going to be an emotional night,"
 he said. "[Springsteen] parked himself at the Sports Arena and made 
that his home."<br>
<br>
The curtain eventually had to fall on this era of Springsteen in L.A. 
When it did, "I don't think he's going to want to walk off that stage," 
Murphy said.<br>
<br>
The Sports Arena was built in 1959 for around $7.4 million, in 
anticipation of the city's growing need for major sports and 
entertainment facilities.<br>
<br>
It was designed by Welton Becket, who also dreamed up local landmarks 
such as the Capitol Records Tower, the Beverly Hilton hotel and 
Hollywood's Cinerama Dome. When it was built, the venue was then the 
largest arena in Los Angeles.<br>
<br>
Then-Vice President Richard M. Nixon attended the opening, and the arena
 played host to the 1960 Democratic National Convention that nominated 
John F. Kennedy for the presidency.<br>
<br>
The L.A. Lakers moved there in 1960 (Doris Day was a courtside regular),
 and it housed the Clippers from 1984 to '99. USC's basketball team 
played in the arena from 1959 to 2006, and the 1984 Olympics boxing 
matches were held there too. Perhaps befitting the venue's populist 
image, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders held a rally 
there in August.<br>
<br>
But over the decades, the city moved on. The Lakers left for the Forum 
in 1967, and the Clippers followed them to Staples in 1999. The venue 
still had great sight lines for concerts, but its lack of luxury-box 
accommodations and other contemporary amenities left it, for better or 
worse, behind the times.<br>
<br>
Over the next two years, the arena will be demolished to make way for a 
22,000-capacity, $250-million open-air soccer stadium. The site will be 
the home for a Major League Soccer franchise expected to debut in 2018, 
with backing from Magic Johnson, Dodgers co-owner Peter Guber and 
others.<br>
<br>
The shift in venue might reflect L.A.'s changing demographics and 
cultural tastes — more room for soccer, less room for classic rockers.<br>
<br>
Years after its heyday, some fans may barely notice that it's gone. 
"It's the end of an era, but whether it will be missed is harder to 
say," said Gary Bongiovanni, chief executive of the concert-industry 
publication Pollstar.<br>
<br>
But for Springsteen fans on Saturday, the Sports Arena was the rowdiest 
joint in town. For "Dancing in the Dark," when Springsteen typically 
pulls fans onstage to dance, one ecstatic woman got her wish when the 
performer noticed her sign: "300 Shows in the Pit and No Dance" and 
lifted her up. Springsteen crowd-surfed and high-fived every fan he 
could get his hands on.<br>
<br>
For the two hours Saturday that the band played "River" cuts such as the
 rollicking "Cadillac Ranch" or the album's harrowing title track a 
sense of loss pierced the jubilation at times — and not just for the 
building.<br>
<br>
Video clips of Springsteen's late saxophonist, Clarence "The Big Man" 
Clemons, drove that home during "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out," with Clemons'
 nephew Jake manning the tenor sax in his stead.<br>
<br>
After almost four hours, as the E Street Band bashed through the Isley 
Brothers' "Shout" and brought every last Springsteen fan to their feet, 
the crowd could sense the night was almost over.<br>
<br>
The 66-year-old Springsteen hollered and dug into his Telecaster, 
knowing that his 3 1/2 -decades in the Sports Arena were winding down 
for good. But still, he couldn't quite bear to leave yet.<br>
<br>
"One more time!" he shouted.</div>

Bruce Springsteen in Los Angeles: Dancing on the Grave of Arena Rock<br>
CULTURE | By	Steve Pond on March 16, 2016 </strong><br>
<br>
<br>
On the occasion of his 100th Springsteen show, a fan finds immediacy instead of nostalgia in a night of 36-year-old songs<br>
The fact that Bruce Springsteen is currently in Los Angeles playing 
three shows devoted to a 36-year-old album in an arena slated for 
demolition could be considered a sign of a lot of things.<br>
<br>
For instance, a sign that Springsteen has jumped on the nostalgia gravy 
train. Or that his presence at the soon-to-be-demolished Los Angeles 
Memorial Sports Arena is the last gasp for the dying beast that is arena
 rock, which has been thoroughly supplanted by pop, hip-hop and country 
at the center of the pop-culture menu.<br>
<br>
Or, if you believe an astonishingly mean-spirited recent article in the 
National Review, that Springsteen’s appearance in a near-defunct arena 
is even politically appropriate. Criticizing Donald Trump by savaging 
the depressed working-class communities that support him, conservative 
columnist Kevin Williamson wrote, “The truth about these dysfunctional, 
downscale communities is that they deserve to die. Economically, they 
are negative assets. Morally, they are indefensible. Forget all your 
cheap theatrical Bruce Springsteen crap.”<br>
<br>
So what are these shows? The last hurrah for a dying genre, a trip down memory lane, a soundtrack for losers?<br>
Or, maybe, one hell of a rock show that blows away thoughts of nostalgia
 and says things about how we live now even as it celebrates a work from
 three decades ago?<br>
Me, I’d opt for that last one. But then, I’m biased.<br>
<br>
Confession time: Tuesday night’s Sports Arena show was my 99th 
Springsteen concert. Thursday’s will be my 100th. I first saw a 
24-year-old Bruce opening for Dr. John in front of a sparse crowd at the
 Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in the summer of 1974, two months after I
 became an instant, passionate fan the first time I heard his album “The
 Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle.”<br>
<br>
I saw him once in 1974, twice in ’75, three times in ’76, four times in 
’78, 14 times on the original tour that followed the release of “The 
River” in 1980 and ’81 …<br>
<br>
I’m even visible in the front row of the DVD that accompanies the recent
 “River” box set, which was filmed at a November 1980 show in Tempe, AZ.
 (I’m the guy with the beard by Bruce’s left boot, below.)<br>
<br>
In 1985, I wrote a story called “Confessions of a Springsteen Fanatic” 
that ran on the front page of the Washington Post’s Style section; that 
was back when my fanaticism was a mixture of pride at spotting him early
 on and dismay at having to share him with all the Brucie-come-latelies 
who’d been snapping up “Born in the U.S.A.”<br>
<br>
And through 42 years of concerts in 10 states, through 18 albums and a 
good number of conversations with the man, Springsteen has provided me 
with many of the most exhilarating, profound moments I’ve experienced 
from popular music; if I go to one of his concerts and I don’t have 
goosebumps much of the time, one of us isn’t doing it right.<br>
But that rarely happens: When my wife, who’s seen a paltry 68 Bruce 
shows, asked me how many of my 99 I didn’t think were great, I could 
only come up with five.<br>
<br>
The current tour, though, worried me, with its promise that he and the E
 Street Band would play “The River” album in sequence every night. I’ve 
never before walked into a Bruce show knowing the first 22 songs he’ll 
perform, and the order in which he’ll perform them: the curtain-raising 
outtake “Meet Me in the City,” then the 20-song “River” album, then 
“Badlands” to begin another 90 minutes of hits and favorites. The 
prospect made me uneasy.<br>
<br>
After all, when Springsteen first toured behind “The River,” the kind of
 music he played was considered mainstream rock; now, pop and hip-hop is
 the mainstream and Springsteen is off to the edge somewhere. In this 
less hospitable cultural environment, wouldn’t it make it even harder 
for him to feel as if he’s still got something to say when he’s trotting
 out an old warhorse every night?<br>
<br>
But it’s hard to stay uneasy when Bruce Springsteen is on a concert 
stage — and if arena rock is dying, then the man is dancing on its grave
 with enough inexhaustible abandon to bring it back to life in front of 
15,000 people a night.<br>
Back in 1975, one of the keys to Springsteen’s music was that at a time 
when popular music was starting to fragment, he acted as if rock was a 
unifying cultural force to be reckoned with, a way to find and build 
community and chronicle the journey of his and other lives. And 40 years
 burning down that road, he still does that.<br>
<br>
It turns out that even at the age of 25 (“Born to Run”) or 30 (“The 
River”), Springsteen was making music that could absorb the passage of 
time. “Thunder Road,” from the “Born to Run” album, is my favorite song 
by anybody ever, and long ago I figured out that its key isn’t the 
bravado of “it’s a town full of losers and I’m pulling out of here to 
win,” but the uncertainty of “so you’re scared and you’re thinking that 
maybe we ain’t that young anymore.”<br>
<br>
No, we ain’t that young anymore — at least, I ain’t, and Bruce ain’t, 
and most of the crowd at the Sports Arena this week ain’t. And even as 
“Thunder Road” grows richer and more rueful with the passage of time, so
 do the songs from “The River” count the years and measure the space 
between youthful exuberance and weary reflection.<br>
<br>
The album, said Springsteen near the end of its closing song, is about 
the ticking clock that accompanies all our lives — so hearing it 36 
years later, particularly for those of us who were there the first time 
around, only emphasizes how many ticks have already gone by. That’s not 
nostalgia, that’s immediacy.<br>
<br>
And no, it has nothing to do with celebrating or romanticizing the 
environment that led to Donald Trump. Springsteen does not make any 
political statements on this tour, but the world of “The River” — an 
inclusive community of love and fear and faith and tears and humor and 
death and friendship and generosity and rock ‘n’ roll — is an unspoken 
rebuke to today’s politics of division. So is the plea he makes every 
night from the stage on behalf of a local food bank set up to feed the 
poorest citizens.<br>
<br>
After 99 shows, this is still where I want to be when he’s in town — and
 if that means I’m also dancing on the grave of arena rock, so be it. As
 I write this, Springsteen has two more shows at the Sports Arena, 
Thursday and Saturday nights. I’ll be there, for Nos. 100 and 101.<br>
<br>
To borrow a phrase that Springsteen’s manager Jon Landau used for the 
title of a book of his reviews in 1972 (he borrowed the phrase from Van 
Morrison), it’s too late to stop now.<br>
<br>
Too late for Bruce, for me and for rock ‘n’ roll</div>

National Review<br>
March 18, 2016<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
Michael Brendan Dougherty is bitter. I think that I can write that in 
both truth and charity. (I think you might even say that he and I are 
friends.) Dougherty is a conservative of the sort sometimes advertised 
as “paleo” and served as national correspondent for The American 
Conservative. Like many conservative writers with those associations, 
Dougherty spends a great deal of time lambasting the conservative 
movement and its organs, from which he feels, for whatever reason, 
estranged — an alienation that carries with it more than a little to 
suggest that it is somewhat personal. <br>
<br>
In 2013, he announced that he planned to set aside political writing to 
concentrate on the relatively sane world of professional baseball, 
saying: “National politics has most of the vices of ‘bread and 
circuses.’ And if that’s the case, pro sports is a better circus.” But 
it is difficult for a politics man to give up politics — look at all the
 political crap that ESPN viewers and Sports Illustrated readers have to
 endure — and he has taken it upon himself in this election cycle to 
serve as Apostle to the Cathedral, “the Cathedral” being a favorite 
metaphor of the so-called alt-right for the “distributed conspiracy” (in
 the words of Curtis Yarvin, a.k.a. Mencius Moldbug) that might in less 
riled-up times be described as “polite society,” the conventional wisdom
 among people who live in places such as Washington, D.C., and New York 
City and work in fields such as politics and media.<br>
<br>
It is immoral because it perpetuates a lie: that the white working class
 that finds itself attracted to Trump has been victimized by outside 
forces. It hasn’t. The white middle class may like the idea of Trump as a
 giant pulsing humanoid middle finger held up in the face of the 
Cathedral, they may sing hymns to Trump the destroyer and whisper darkly
 about “globalists” and — odious, stupid term — “the Establishment,” but
 nobody did this to them. They failed themselves. If you spend time in 
hardscrabble, white upstate New York, or eastern Kentucky, or my own 
native West Texas, and you take an honest look at the welfare 
dependency, the drug and alcohol addiction, the family anarchy — which 
is to say, the whelping of human children with all the respect and 
wisdom of a stray dog — you will come to an awful realization. It wasn’t
 Beijing. It wasn’t even Washington, as bad as Washington can be. It 
wasn’t immigrants from Mexico, excessive and problematic as our current 
immigration levels are. It wasn’t any of that. Nothing happened to them.
 There wasn’t some awful disaster. There wasn’t a war or a famine or a 
plague or a foreign occupation. Even the economic changes of the past 
few decades do very little to explain the dysfunction and negligence — 
and the incomprehensible malice — of poor white America. So the gypsum 
business in Garbutt ain’t what it used to be. There is more to life in 
the 21st century than wallboard and cheap sentimentality about how the 
Man closed the factories down. The truth about these dysfunctional, 
downscale communities is that they deserve to die. Economically, they 
are negative assets. Morally, they are indefensible. <strong class="text-strong">Forget all your cheap theatrical Bruce Springsteen crap.</strong>
 Forget your sanctimony about struggling Rust Belt factory towns and 
your conspiracy theories about the wily Orientals stealing our jobs. 
Forget your goddamned gypsum, and, if he has a problem with that, forget
 Ed Burke, too. The white American underclass is in thrall to a vicious,
 selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles.
 Donald Trump’s speeches make them feel good. So does OxyContin. What 
they need isn’t analgesics, literal or political. They need real 
opportunity, which means that they need real change, which means that 
they need U-Haul.</div>

				<div class="content">"<strong class="text-strong">Are you ready to be transformed ?"- Springsteen in Portland<br>
The Oregon<br>
March 23, 2016</strong><br>
<br>
"Bruuuce!" a man shouted in the Moda Center parking lot on Tuesday 
night, a mating call or a battle-cry. "Bruuuce!" another man called 
back, his family exiting a minivan. The yellow sunset kissed the West 
Hills.<br>
<br>
Some musicians are a kind of religion. Their fans follow them from show 
to show, city to city, decade to decade. Springsteen is one, and on 
Tuesday, he and the E Street Band promised pleasure and transcendence: 
"Are you ready to be entertained?" he cried to the packed arena. He 
shouted it again, and then: "Are you ready to be transformed?"<br>
<br>
The incredible thing—one of the many incredible things that happened at 
this Springsteen concert, and presumably does at all of them—was that he
 was shouting to a fully lit arena. The Boss required no shadowy 
entrance, no pyrotechnic explosions, no divide between himself and his 
audience when he stepped on stage for "The River" outtake and set opener
 "Meet Me in the City."<br>
<br>
The lights went down eventually, but it was a fearless, honest greeting,
 the start of a show without a hint of spectacle beyond the musicians on
 stage.<br>
<br>
The band's current tour is a celebration of 1980's "The River," an album
 Springsteen called his "coming of age" record. It's shocking in 
classic-rock retrospect, but it was his first No. 1 album, and "Hungry 
Heart" his first single to reach the top 10. At 20 tracks, it was also 
his longest effort.<br>
<br>
Not every song on "The River" is a classic, but over the course of the 
show's first two hours, Springsteen made their intentions clear. Among 
the highlights: the propulsive "Two Hearts," a song a dozen or so 
scruffy indie bands are still trying to improve on right now; "Out on 
the Street," which winked toward Elvis Costello's "Armed Forces" and its
 bright keyboards; and "I Wanna Marry You," which Springsteen approached
 with two handfuls of maracas and Sam Cooke soulfulness.<br>
<br>
"It's a song about the kind of love you have before... ooh... the real 
love," he said, in a moment of banter-wisdom so convincing you could 
practically see him cradling a couple of newly etched stone tablets. "No
 responsibilities. The kind that doesn't exist! That kind. But it points
 the way, sometimes it points the way to the other kind." Every time 
Springsteen paused to talk, I wanted him to start an advice podcast. 
What doesn't he know? What hasn't he felt?<br>
<br>
He knows about love: wife Patti Scialfa remains an E Street stalwart, 
and he rubbed her shoulder in a tender moment during "Sherry Darling." 
The band's camaraderie all these decades later was better than any blast
 of confetti: to see players so devoted to their music and their 
friendships was genuinely inspiring. As was their 66-year-old frontman's
 successful crowd-surfing trip through half the floor section. <br>
<br>
"Bruuuce" was the name the crowd kept chanting in uncoordinated slow 
motion, like the roar of a far-off dinosaur, but there were plenty of 
heroes on stage: One thing you never have to worry about at an E Street 
Band show is if drummer Max Weinberg is going to smash through the next 
pre-chorus fill like a monster truck. And in the shoes of his late 
uncle, Clarence Clemons, saxophonist Jake Clemons stepped into his parts
 with joy.<br>
<br>
There wasn't an encore—we were lucky to catch our breath between 
songs—but after "The River," the band gave us another hour-plus, ripping
 through "The Promised Land," "Because the Night," "Brilliant Disguise" 
and others. After "Lonesome Day," Springsteen said a sentence that very 
much sounded like "That's for our friends in Sleater-Kinney," which was 
the best Sleater-Kinney moment at the Moda Center since the band teased 
their reunion with a surprise Pearl Jam appearance.<br>
<br>
"Do you have anything left, Portland?!" Springsteen wailed after a 
mind-melting run of "Born to Run," a fast version of "Dancing in the 
Dark" and the deeply underrated "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)." I wasn't 
sure I did: then the band played "Tenth Avenue Freeze Out." Were we 
entertained? We were beyond that.<br>
<br>
There are a few people whose reviews of this show I would like to read: 
The giddy young boy in the checkered shirt and blue earplugs dancing 
next to his (presumable) grandmother and trying not to fall asleep as 
the set crept past the two-hour mark; the khakis dad in the baseball cap
 with his phone in his shirt pocket, clapping on the first and third 
beats of "Because the Night." Springsteen has millions of true 
believers, but that doesn't matter: on Tuesday, he took us to the river 
one by one.<br>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen - Magic Talk<br>
The Rolling Stone Review<br>
November 1, 2007<br>
By Joe Levy<br>
<br>
<br>
The</strong> ten years Springsteen mentions roughly line up with the 
period during which the E Street Band was idle, from 1988 to 1999. 
During that time, Springsteen redefined his career and his music more 
radically than any major artist save Bob Dylan, the eternal trickster. 
Having reached the level of mass success that his music and ambition 
always demanded, Springsteen pulled back. His subject matter went first 
inward and then outward. The most personal albums he ever made – Lucky 
Town and Human Touch – were, as he's pointed out, his happiest and least
 successful. In 1995, The Ghost of Tom Joad, a literary album with a 
political bent – Raymond Carver meets Woody Guthrie – followed the birth
 of his youngest child. He had gone, in seven years, from stadiums to 
arenas to theaters, a man alone with an acoustic guitar.<br>
<br>
In 1999, a few months shy of his fiftieth birthday, Springsteen went on 
tour with the E Street Band for the first time in more than a decade. As
 it always had, the band put flesh and muscle behind the words, 
reconnecting Springsteen to the rock and soul that had first been the 
wellspring of his music. This is clear when I watch the band rehearse 
for its current tour at Convention Hall in Asbury Park, New Jersey – an 
arena band gathering in a room the size of a high school gymnasium to 
stretch out before a long run. In that familiar voice full of gravel, 
Springsteen traces Sam Cooke-style melodic runs in the air.<br>
<br>
Magic returns to the spirit of Asbury Park with a big sound Springsteen 
hasn't pursued since Born to Run. "Lately, I've had a little romance 
with my oldest stuff," he says. "There was a lot of freeness in it. When
 you start and when you finish – that's when the pressure is off. In the
 beginning, you're too unknown, you're not really competing with people.
 And at this point, I'm not competing with 50 Cent or trying to get on 
MTV. I'm playing for myself and my band and my audience."<br>
<br>
As he explains when we sit down to talk backstage at Convention Hall, 
Magic uses the boardwalk sounds of the past to put across the feeling of
 the present: "the uneasiness of these very uneasy times." Often when he
 speaks, Springsteen laughs midsentence, as if he's embarrassed to be 
taking himself this seriously. But not when he talks about the course 
the country has taken under George W. Bush or the war in Iraq. Then the 
laughter stops.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The record starts with "Radio Nowhere," a song about a guy out on the road looking for a connection.</strong><br>
<br>
It's an end-of-the-world scenario – he's seeing the apocalypse. All 
communications are down: "Trying to find my way home/All I heard was a 
drone bouncing  – trying to connect to you. It comes down to trying to 
make people happy, feel less lonely, but also being a conduit for a 
dialogue about the events of the day, the issues that impact people's 
lives, personal and social and political and religious. That's how I 
always saw the job of our band. That was my service. At this point, I'm 
in the middle of a very long conversation with my audience.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">And what are you hearing from their side of the conversation?</strong><br>
<br>
A lot of different things. "I like the old Bruce better.…" [Laughs] It's
 an ongoing dialogue about what living means. It's not like a one-on-one
 dialogue. It's more what you feel back from them. You create a space 
together. You are involved in an act of the imagination together, 
imagining the life you want to live, the kind of country you want to 
live in, the kind of place you want to leave to your children. What are 
the things that bring you ecstasy and bliss, what are the things that 
bring on the darkness, and what can we do together to combat those 
things? That's the dialogue I have in my imagination when I'm writing. I
 have it in front of me when I'm performing.<br>
<br>
It's an organic, living thing. There's something subtly different being 
said on a nightly basis. But you're attempting to define and have impact
 upon the world and the life you're living. I can't do it by myself. I 
need my audience. It'll be a lifelong journey by the time that I'm done.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">This kind of dialogue requires a heavy commitment. What do you get out of it?</strong><br>
<br>
I enjoy it, but more than that, I need it. It's the fundamental thing 
that moves me out on the stage, that keeps me writing throughout my 
entire career. I've felt the absence of that dialogue in the past in my 
life, and it was a terrible emptiness. When I latched onto it, I latched
 onto it like a life raft. You're in that room together, that dark room 
together. The lights go down, and you are free to imagine the person, 
the place, that you want to be. I suppose you take some of that with you
 when you go. It stays with you.<br>
<br>
I remember the birth of my children. It was so overwhelming, one of the 
few moments where I've experienced total love without fear. I was afraid
 of losing it afterward, except you never lose it. The memory of that 
moment and the possibilities inherent in that moment are everlasting. So
 on a good night, when the band's playing real well, there's a moment 
when you've been a part of a collective event of imagination, and when 
you leave, you take some of it with you. And you put it in action 
however befits your needs.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">That collective act of the imagination comes up on "Magic." What kind of country we want to live in is a recurring theme.</strong><br>
<br>
The song "Magic" is about living in a time when anything that is true 
can be made to seem like a lie, and anything that is a lie can be made 
to seem true. There are people that have taken that as their credo. The 
classic quote was from one of the Bushies in The New York Times: "We 
make our own reality. You guys report it, we make it." I may loathe that
 statement – the unbelievable stupidity and arrogance of it – more than I
 loathe "Bring it on" and "Mission accomplished."<br>
<br>
That song, it's all about illusion: "Trust none of what you hear/And 
less of what you'll see/This is what will be" – we make it. Until you 
get to the last verse: "There's a fire down below/It's coming up here.… 
There's bodies hanging in the trees/This is what will be." That's the 
heart of my record right there.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">There's a line at the end of that song about carrying "only what you fear." You're addressing the politics of fear, aren't you?</strong><br>
<br>
Yeah. You can't kill your way to security, and you can't lead through 
scaring people. Maybe you can get people to vote for you sometimes, but 
it's not a tactic that's going to provide the kind of moral authority 
and leadership that it's going to take to communicate in the world. It's
 the coward's way out.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">So you're saying you can win elections that way, but you can't govern that way</strong>.<br>
<br>
That's right. That's the only card that they've played, pretty much from
 Day One. If the 2004 election had been held six months later, they 
would have lost. People were still under the spell of 9/11 and the magic
 [laughs] and the Swift Boating. One of the most satisfying moments of 
the election was Ted Koppel ripping the Swift Boaters a new asshole on 
Nightline about a week or so before the election, when they went to the 
village in Vietnam where the incident occurred and talked to the 
Vietnamese witnesses. It was right there, but it wasn't enough, and it 
was too late.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is if you're a member of the press and you believe that 
part of your responsibility is to give people the information they need 
to protect their freedoms, there's an editorial responsibility. But that
 ball's been dropped terribly. When somebody's saying you're going to 
lead with Anna Nicole Smith, you've got to be wondering if you're in the
 right job. It's become a business, and on what's supposed to be the 
most credible channels, there's an endless parade of nonsense on a daily
 basis.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Right. Because during the election to get 
the truth behind the Swift Boat ads, you had to skip the mainstream 
media and go straight to The Daily Show.</strong><br>
<br>
Jon Stewart is such an important and lonely force on television. He's in
 the business of assisting people to interpret the modern media world. 
There's so much sheer noise. Every night he comes on and pulls the veil 
down, and you get a shot at what things really look like. That's why 
people have gravitated to him and have faith in him.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">There's a line from "Long Walk Home" on the 
new album that has tremendous power. A father tells his son that the 
flag flying above the courthouse means "certain things are set in stone .
 . . what we'll do and what we won't." But we live in a moment where 
those things aren't set in stone.</strong><br>
<br>
No, because those things have been chipped away at horrendously. Who 
would have ever thought we'd live in a country with no right to habeas 
corpus? That's Orwellian. That's what political hysteria is about and 
how effective it is. I felt it in myself. You get frightened for your 
family, for your home. And you realize how countries can move way off 
course, very far from democratic ideals. Add another terrorist attack or
 two, and the country can turn into a pretty scary place. Philip Roth 
caught it in The Plot Against America: It happens in a very American way
 – the flag is flying over civil liberties as they crumble. It was a 
fascinating insight.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">You mentioned Philip Roth. Are there other things you were reading that had an impact on the record?</strong><br>
<br>
Not really. I'd been influenced a lot in the past through books and 
films, but I would say on this record I got re-infatuated with pop 
music. Pete Seeger says, "I want to know, 'What's the song for? What's 
the job it's supposed to do?' " I carry a little bit of that with me, 
but I'm a pop kid. I grew up on Top Forty. Sometimes what the song is 
for is just the way it makes you feel. On this record, I wanted a lot of
 that. There's some classic Sixties pop forms. California-rock 
influences – Pet Sounds and a lot of Byrds. I wanted to take the 
productions that create the perfect pop universes and then subvert them 
with the lyrics – fill them with the hollowness and the fear, the 
uneasiness of these very uneasy times.<br>
<br>
"Girls in Their Summer Clothes" is a crooning Sixties ballad, but it 
creates an ideal picture that stands in juxtaposition to what's running 
through the inside of this record. There's a diner on two songs, and 
they're very different. There's the one in "Girls in Their Summer 
Clothes" – Frankie's Diner, on the edge of town, with neon signs – and 
then there's the diner with the sign that just says gone [on "Long Walk 
Home"]. I believe in them both. Those are the parameters of what I'm 
talking about, right there.<br>
<br>
"<strong class="text-strong">Girls in Their Summer Clothes" is one </strong>of <strong class="text-strong">several songs that seem to call back to your earlier wo</strong>rk.<br>
<br>
It's straight-out big. I don't think I've written as romantically as I 
allowed myself to do on that song maybe since Born to Run. This record, I
 felt free to go back to the romanticism of my earliest records. I 
doubled my voice, I sang in a bigger voice. I'm actually looking forward
 to writing a little bit more in that style, to picking up some of those
 elements that I discarded because I wanted to make sure that the music 
was tough enough for the subjects I was interested in dealing with. 
That's what I did with Darkness on the Edge of Town and Nebraska and 
parts of The River. But now, I feel free enough to go back and reclaim 
those lovely elements of pop simplicity and the well-crafted 
three-and-a-half-minute song, which I love to do.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Did working on the thirtieth-anniversary edition of "Born to Run" open that up?</strong><br>
<br>
I forgot how good that record was. I hadn't listened to it in many, many
 years. Born to Run was criticized as being too romantic. I was in that 
part of my career where I was reacting. Once you gain some attention, 
you're reacting to . . . maybe it's success, or something you overheard 
passing down the street. And so I moved toward darkness. But part of the
 things I was frightened of were the reasons why it lasted: because it 
was romantic.<br>
<br>
But even then, I filled the romanticism with darkness. It was a 
post-Vietnam record, and you can hear, once again, the uneasiness and 
the fear and the concern about the future. The classic line of "Thunder 
Road," which I wrote at twenty-four, was "We're not that young anymore."
 That came right out of the last years of the war. Nobody felt that 
young anymore. All that's in there. It has some of my greatest songs on 
it. I set out the parameters of the world I was going to be 
investigating.<br>
<br>
It's interesting – I didn't think about that, but I really wanted that. 
All the little different effects we had. I always loved those little pop
 symphonies, so on this record, I had a chance to play around with some 
of that. "Your Own Worst Enemy" was one of my big pop productions. The 
lyrics are "we're always teetering on the edge," and it's all about 
self-subversion. You can take it personally or politically. That's what 
gives the record its tension, those two things - the perfect pop 
universe and then what's at its center. "Living in the Future" has a 
very boardwalk sound, but it's about how terribly fucked up things have 
gotten. It's a song about apathy, and how what you never thought could 
happen has happened already. I tried to combine personal and political, 
so you can read into the songs either way. You can read the record as a 
comment on what's been going on, or you can read it just as relationship
 songs.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">It's effective. It has an allegorical power.</strong><br>
<br>
Yeah. Despite the interview here, I didn't want a big Bush-bashing 
record. It's been done, and that's not really what people needed, or 
maybe it's just not what I needed right now. Your writing has to be 
multidimensional to remain interesting, to have life. You're not 
headline-writing. I've found ways to express my political concerns and 
personal concerns, and I always found them best combined, because that's
 how people live.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">I want to go back for a moment to "Radio 
Nowhere." There's an invocation of Elvis when the narrator is "searching
 for a mystery train." What's he looking for?</strong><br>
<br>
What everybody's looking for. The ever-unattainable but absolutely there
 part of life that's slightly out of your fingertips, slightly shaded in
 the dark somewhere. But within, it contains all the essences and raw 
physical vitality and blood and bone and sweat of living. It's the thing
 that makes it all worth it at the end of the day, even if you just get 
the tip of your tongue on it. It's our history. It's that train that's 
been running since they friggin' landed over here on the boat, and it's 
roaring with all of us right now, that thing. That's what I like to look

<strong class="text-strong">Your sense of American identity and American possibility - where does that come from?</strong><br>
<br>
The people I liked did that. They were searchers – Hank Williams, Frank 
Sinatra, Elvis, James Brown. The people I loved – Woody Guthrie, Dylan –
 they were out on the frontier of the American imagination, and they 
were changing the course of history and our own ideas about who we were.
 And you can throw in Martin Luther King and Malcolm X.<br>
<br>
It was a part of what I was imagining from the very beginning, just 
because I got tremendous inspiration and a sense of place from the 
performers who had imagined it before me. It was something I wanted to 
take a swing at, what thrilled and excited me. For me, I started with 
what I had. I walked down to the boardwalk about a hundred yards from 
here, and I looked into a little knickknack shop. There was a rack of 
postcards, and I pulled one out that said GREETINGS FROM ASBURY PARK. I 
said, "That's my album cover. This is my place."<br>
<br>
My songs, they're all about the American identity and your own identity 
and the masks behind the masks behind the masks, both for the country 
and for yourself. And trying to hold onto what's worthwhile, what makes 
it a place that's special, because I still believe that it is.<br>
<br>
The American idea still has enormous power in its best manifestation. 
And ten George Bushes cannot bring that idea down – a hundred cannot 
bring that idea down. What we're going through now, we're going to be 
out the other side at some point. But that idea remains, and it's 
something that has compelled me my whole life. Part of it was to make 
sense of who I was – where I came from and what I saw and what I saw 
happen to some people around me.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What does that mean?</strong><br>
<br>
My family was troubled in a lot of ways. I came from . . . it was an 
interesting family. My mother is only second generation Italian. My 
grandmother lived to be 102 and never spoke any English. When I went 
into her room, I went to Italy. Everything: the Madonnas, the shawls. 
She lived in the country since she was in her twenties and never learned
 any English. So there was Italian culture, and then the Irish folks 
were just very old-school people.<br>
<br>
I had to sort some of that out. So identity became a big part of the 
music I was writing. And then because of the times when I grew up, the 
Sixties, our national identity was in tremendous flux. I got interested 
in "what's the social side of that equation?" That's really what all my 
stuff is ultimately about: "Is there anybody alive out there?" asked 
over and over again. "Long Walk Home" could have come off Darkness on 
the Edge of Town.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">You performed "Long Walk Home" during the 
Seeger Sessions tour. What's the difference between playing it with the 
Sessions band and the E Street Band?</strong><br>
<br>
It was our opening night in London. You're very conscious of your 
American-ness when you're in Europe, particularly during these horrible 
times. I had the song, and we worked up a loose arrangement. That band 
was very easy to improvise with. Work something out at soundcheck and 
play it that night – we did that a lot. They were a great, great band. I
 felt like I've got two of the best bands in the world.<br>
<br>
I wrote most of this album on tour with the Sessions band. I wrote some 
of it the minute I came off The Rising. My idea was to pick up with the 
political and social results of what came out of the tragedy of 9/11. 
"Livin' in the Future" I've had since then, and I might have had "Radio 
Nowhere." I had a few things, but I didn't have enough. So I set it 
aside.<br>
<br>
When I toured with the Sessions band – you play and go home, you sit in a
 hotel room, and I'd pick up my guitar. That's where I do a lot of 
writing now. And then I write in my spare time when I'm at home. It 
doesn't take much time now. It's a very fluid process compared to what 
it used to be when I was young, when I insisted on beating the hell out 
of myself for as long and as hard as I could because I didn't have 
anything else better to do. Now that I've got three teenagers, my time 
is all called upon, so I write pretty much in my spare time.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">When you say you beat yourself up when you were younger, in what way?</strong><br>
<br>
You think there's a right way, which is a fallacy when it comes to 
creating something. So you're in trouble there. And also, you have no 
life. So rather than going through the unpleasantness of your actual 
daily experience, you'd rather live in the unpleasantness of your 
creative experience. The hours I spent on . . . It was the only way I 
knew how to work. It was fun, but it was exhausting. I think 
intentionally exhausting. I made a lot of good music, but it all came 
out on Tracks. There's probably another Tracks sitting in the vault that
 I'll get to at some point.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The creative roll you're on now is 
relatively recent, given the scope of your career. There was a period 
eight to ten years ago where you were still making records and putting 
them away.</strong><br>
<br>
Yeah, I made one for "Streets of Philadelphia" that I didn't put out, 
which I'd like to. It was interesting, it had a lot of little loops and 
things. A good record, written pretty well. It wasn't a complete record 
in the end, which is why I would sit down and feel great for four or 
five songs and in the end get up with some sense of dissatisfaction.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What were those songs about?</strong><br>
<br>
Mostly personal relationships. I'd come off Tunnel of Love, and it would
 have been my fourth record about those things, and I thought that was 
one too many. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I had to break the 
narrative that I was in, break the context and move to L.A. for three or
 four years, get away from all things connected to myself.<br>
<br>
We went to Los Angeles, and the change of scenery was good. I love that 
city, actually. I love the mountains and the desert, and up there I can 
have my cars and my motorcycles. I tried to live in New York for a 
while, but I couldn't deal with a place where you had to catch a car. 
It's too late for me for that.<br>
<br>
So I moved out West, where I had a little house in the Hollywood Hills 
from the middle of the Eighties, and I felt real comfortable there. My 
sister lives there, my younger sister, my parents lived up north in San 
Francisco, and it was a fascinating time to be there, because it's what 
the East Coast looks like now. If you go to my hometown, in Freehold, 
there's tremendous Hispanic influence, and that was California fifteen 
years ago. So when I wrote The Ghost of Tom Joad and wrote a lot about 
what was going on, it felt like "This is what the country's going to 
look like in another ten or fifteen years." All those immigration issues
 that people are trying to ride right now to wherever they think they're
 going were all in the news and in your face in the early Nineties in 
California.<br>
<br>
I wrote things that I wouldn't have if I stayed back East. Two or three 
albums of Western songs. Ghost of Tom Joad, Devils &amp; Dust and 
another record of Western songs that I've been working on. So it was 
really a great geographical change, a place to find new stories.<br>
<br>
But I also took ten years and I learned how to live, which I didn't know
 how to do. Thirty-five years old, and I didn't have a clue about it. I 
learned how to live, and I found the joy in those things.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What did you learn?</strong><br>
<br>
I guess life outside of work. This is a very satisfying work life, but 
it's a part of your overall life. How do you have relationships? How do 
you commit to things that are forever? How do you break all your old 
habits, or some of them?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">If you can share some secrets, you can save me a lot of money in therapy.</strong><br>
<br>
I spent a lot of money there myself, and I learned a lot. I had to work 
on it the way that I had to work on playing the guitar when I first 
started – many, many hours and a lot of intense devotion. I realized 
that some people may come to that naturally, but I was somebody that was
 going to have to learn it, because all my instincts were wrong. All my 
instincts drove me away from things.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Sometimes you're running in a different 
direction because you don't know how to do things differently than what 
you've seen growing up.</strong><br>
<br>
Yeah, that's it. So you realize you've got to make your own map, and in 
so doing, you honor your parents by taking the good things they gave you
 and carrying them forth, and taking burdens and weights and putting 
them down so your children don't have to run with them.<br>
<br>
But that break was really extreme for me, and Patti was, and has been, 
patient beyond patient. I couldn't get up in the morning, I couldn't go 
to bed at night. The basic things that set the clock. The kids were 
young – it was "It's six-thirty now." That took about four or five years
 to figure out.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Was that from having to unlearn the rhythm on the road?</strong><br>
<br>
It goes back to my childhood. I had a weird upbringing where I was up 
for all hours at night when I was, like, six years old. We had a very 
eccentric household. My clock got thrown off when I was really young. 
Five and six, I was up until 3 A.M. I'm sure it's no coincidence I ended
 up a musician, so I could be up to 3 A.M., just like I was.<br>
<br>
When your own kids come along, I said, "Good, you've got to change 
that." So many basic things. So I spent a lot of that time learning how 
to live. I suppose Patti would say I've reached a tolerable level of 
competency.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What brought you back to New Jersey?</strong><br>
<br>
I grew up around a very big extended family. I think Patti and I have 
maybe seventy family members, just in this area, and there's a lot of 
Italians and also an Irish side. At some point, when the children got to
 school age, we decided we wanted that for the kids. We were always here
 half the year anyway, even then. So when we came back, my kids grew up 
around my uncle that hunts, the one that owns the dry-cleaning business –
 people who do all different kinds of work and bring all kinds of things
 to them. It took away the weirdness of my job, and it allowed them to 
look other places for all different kinds of role models. That was 
important.<br>
<br>
Then we came back, and I re-found the freedom in some of my early 
narrative, and that includes here in this building and this town and in 
my band. I feel the freest I've ever felt in my life creatively. I feel 
like I've picked up a thread that I never let go of but just let sit for
 a while.<br>
<br>
And I feel like we're very on it right now. This is going to be the best
 E Street Band somebody's ever seen. You may have a favorite part of my 
work, you may have a favorite show, but if you're a young kid and your 
brother or your dad saw us, and you come and see us now, you can say, "I
 saw them when they were at their best." I like that. I like the fact 
that all my guys are out there and that they're all alive. I like that a
 lot. It could have gone many other ways. There were struggles, the same
 type of troubles that many other bands have, but people took care of 
one another, and everybody's there. I can't tell you the joy of standing
 next to those same people.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Some of whom have been with you for more than three decades.</strong><br>
<br>
I met Steve [Van Zandt] when I was sixteen. Now I'm fifty-eight. So 
that's more than forty years. It's an amazing thing to be up there with 
your best friends and your wife. Your whole world's up there. I think 
for a lot of our fans, part of the thing is when the world's falling 
apart, we're not. That's why people come to us. There was always a sense
 of stability and continuity and connection.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">It sounds like something you've been able to provide for both your families – your family onstage and your kids.</strong><br>
<br>
You've got to have the whole picture at this point. You need the 
fullness of life. Without that, it's an exercise. You don't want the 
things that you're writing and singing about to remain an abstraction to
 yourself. I always liked the scene at the end of The Searchers: John 
Wayne brings the girl back home, but he can't enter the house himself. 
Very tragic. That was always really resonant for me. I grew up with a 
lot of that, people not being able to get in, and that was always my 
natural state.<br>
<br>
I think that because I had a bit of a chaotic heart myself, I always was
 in search of that stability. It's in "Leah," on Devils &amp; Dust: "I 
walk this road with a hammer and a fiery lantern/With this hand I've 
built, and with this I've burned." I think everybody feels those two 
things. It's just how you balance them. There's a lot of fire in the 
burning, but it don't do you any good if you ain't got the hammer for 
the building.</div>
