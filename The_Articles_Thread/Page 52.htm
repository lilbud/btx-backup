10 of the best: Bruce Springsteen</strong><br>
<br>
It’s deep cuts only for our survey of the Boss’s catalogue: no hit 
singles, nothing with ‘Born’ in the title. You get the picture …<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">1. Thundercrack<br>
</strong><br>
Back in the early days of Bruce Springsteen’s career, when he played to 
audiences who didn’t know him or his music, his plan of attack involved 
hitting the audience with a large, loud, long showstopper at the end of 
the set, one that would make them pay attention and remember the band 
after they had finished. Thundercrack is the grandaddy of Springsteen’s 
epic journeys and would only be replaced when he wrote Rosalita (Come 
Out Tonight). The vocals are loose and playful, while behind Springsteen
 the band are absolutely airtight, a glorious swirl of organ, piano and 
vocals, plenty of sha-las and whoa-ohs, backed by the unmistakable feel 
of Vini Lopez on the drums. By the time you get to the guitar solo and 
Clarence Clemons’s sax interlude, you’re sure the song is ending any 
minute now … only for it to start up again. By the end of Thundercrack’s
 almost nine minutes you feel like you’ve been a private guest at a 
raucous and unpredictable house party, somewhere on the Jersey Shore, 
standing there barefoot with a cold beer in your hand, all night (as the
 song says).<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">2. So Young and in Love</strong><br>
<br>
Springsteen’s core sound is based on the music he loved when growing up,
 but on this track he wears his heart visibly and proudly on his sleeve.
 He makes no bones about channelling his idols here: he is Wilson 
Pickett, Sam Moore and Jackie Wilson, strutting his stuff along the edge
 of a stage in a dark nightclub, jacket slung over his shoulder as he 
works the adoring crowd. This song swings, pure and simple, thanks to 
the rhythm section, all solid bass and hi-hat; it’s a delightful melange
 of sax and keyboards and hearty backing vocals, from when all the 
members of the E Street Band had microphones. (It’s believed this track 
was recorded just after Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan joined the band in 
August 1974, answering a Village Voice ad for musicians that specified: 
“All must sing.”) There are rat traps and soul crusaders (predating the 
ones we’d meet later on Night, from Born to Run), and more than anything
 else, the performance captures the emotions implied by the song’s 
title.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">3. Roulette</strong><br>
<br>
Springsteen was in the studio for over a year across 1979 and 1980 while
 recording The River, and as a result there were piles of outtakes left 
over, some of which might have been better than the songs that made it 
on to the album. Inspired by the Three Mile Island nuclear power-plant 
incident (it was recorded three days afterwards and was the first song 
cut during the River sessions), this absolute piledriver of a song is 
Springsteen at his most dramatic. The full-speed-ahead drum roll at the 
start of the track is accompanied by an excited, driving voc<br>
<br>
3al; the lyrics and phrasing parachute the listener directly into heart 
of the action; you aren’t allowed to be a casual observer. “We left the 
toys out in the yard,” he begins, setting a vivid, intense scene that 
never diminishes. At the end of the last verse, Max Weinberg rides the 
hi-hat, cueing an almost-breathless Springsteen to lead you through the 
maze of action to the song’s close. And then that drum roll, reprised 
from the beginning, slows down like a pulse and fades out at the end. If
 it sounds insane, that’s because it is. “It would have been one of the 
best things on the record,” Springsteen told Mojo in 1998.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">4. Be True</strong><br>
<br>
Another River-era outtake, this track would surface on the B-side of the
 1980 single Fade Away, a perfect antidote to that song’s plaintive 
sadness. On the surface it’s a delightful little love song – the 
narrator telling his girl he’s just as good as the stars she daydreams 
about – but there’s a deeper theme of not selling yourself short and of 
getting what you deserve, all tied together with movie metaphors. 
Musically it’s got the E Street Band at their best in that era, bouncing
 along with organ and piano at the forefront and Clarence Clemons on the
 tambourine, before he comes in with a crisp, perfect sax solo at the 
end. This is another track Springsteen would later say should have been 
on the album: “I’m sure they [Be True and Roulette] would’ve been better
 than a couple other things that we threw on there,” he told Rolling 
Stone in 1988. Like many of Springsteen’s love songs, live – as in the 
version on our Spotify playlist – he often turns the sentiment around on
 the audience, exhorting “Is it a deal?” at the end of the last chorus.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">5. This Hard Land</strong><br>
<br>
The country influence that began to appear in Springsteen’s songs as he 
moved into the 80s should not have been surprising, as his interests, 
tastes and influences expanded. This Hard Land is a Western movie in 
five minutes, a story of friendship and brotherhood told through the 
life of a brother and a sister in the south-west of the US; you can see 
the dust, feel the saddle, hear the floorboards creaking underfoot. It 
was written for Born in the USA, wouldn’t have been out of place on 
Nebraska, and finally emerged live onstage in 1993. It’s almost country 
but not quite; it’s almost rock but not quite that either. No matter how
 you want to label it, it’s an absolutely beautiful, rollicking, 
wide-open song with a gorgeously narrated story. It’s become a special 
moment in the live show, whether performed with the band or as a solo 
acoustic encore. When Springsteen closed his 2013 European tour in 
Kilkenny, Ireland, he was visibly emotional as he sang the last verse: 
“If you can’t make it — stay hard! Stay hungry! Stay alive! If you can /
 And meet me in a dream of this hard land.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">6. My Love Will Not Let You Down</strong><br>
<br>
If you’re ever at a Springsteen concert and this is the first number, 
you’re in for a barnburner of a night. On its face this is a love song, a
 pledge of passion and dedication, but it’s also become a symbol of 
Springsteen’s promise to the fans, and a thank you for their devotion 
and commitment. “I got me a promise that I ain’t afraid to make,” he 
pledges, holding the guitar up against his heart, strumming extra hard 
for emphasis, underscoring his words. It’s a rhythmic, powerful anthem 
that’s all guitars, except for Roy Bitttan’s elegant underpinning, and 
it should be the theme song for the latter-day E Street Band. Manager 
Jon Landau originally favoured it to open side two of Born in the USA, 
for which it was originally recorded, before the album took another 
direction entirely.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">7. Seeds</strong><br>
<br>
As Springsteen’s cultural frame of reference expanded, so did his 
political and social consciousness, and this was his first attempt to 
catalyse the latter in his songwriting. Seeds came out of the Born in 
the USA sessions and is a specific exploration of a specific poverty: 
another tale of trying to follow the American dream, this time chasing 
after the oil boom just as it went bust. You feel the anger in the 
delivery of the lyrics and the rock-solid rhythm, underscored by crunchy
 and highly satisfying guitar chords courtesy of Nils Lofgren. When it’s
 in the setlist, it’s for a reason, especially during the Reagan years, 
where it would feature in a run including Johnny 99, Atlantic City and 
The River, or in the aftermath of the first Bush presidency where it 
would stand alongside Youngstown and The Ghost of Tom Joad. It sadly 
remains as relevant today as it was when he wrote it, but at least that 
means we’ll get to hear it live for years to come.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">8. The Wish</strong><br>
<br>
After years of Springsteen writing about his stormy relationship with 
his father, this track about his mother, Adele, emerged during the 
Tunnel of Love sessions. While the melody is simple, the song’s strength
 is in its lyrics — the images are bright, beautiful and vivid. You can 
picture the Christmas tree and the scene during the holidays at the 
Springsteen household, and that stays with you as the story brings you 
to the later days of success, wealth and Springsteen’s own start to 
building a family. It’s the bright flipside to the story told in The 
Promise, and one he has admitted was about as directly autobiographical 
as he’s ever been.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">9. Seven Angels</strong><br>
<br>
Even though Springsteen moved into the 90s without the E Street Band, 
his predilection for a great soul shouter didn’t diminish, despite all 
the synthesisers. This exploration of the dilemma of a man in love — is 
this true love? What if I’m wrong? What if I’m right? — is a 
straight-ahead stomper with a good old-fashioned rock’n’roll rhythm 
section. Springsteen screams, he sings, he growls, he hollers, he 
whispers, and makes you feel the various flavours of inner turmoil being
 voiced in the lyrics. It’s absolutely glorious from beginning to end 
and a shame it’s never come out in the live show.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">10. Back in Your Arms</strong><br>
<br>
This is the quintessential Springsteen soul ballad, which made its first
 appearance in the Blood Brothers documentary in 1996. When Back in Your
 Arms appears in performance it makes the women scream, but it also 
makes the men in the house turn just a little misty. It’s a 
heartbreaker, plain and simple, and it’s all about Springsteen’s vocal 
performance: if it doesn’t make your bottom lip tremble just a little 
bit, I’m not sure you’re human. There’s some lovely keyboard work from 
Roy Bittan, which adds the right mood and colour, and Clarence Clemons’s
 soul sax is the cherry on top.</div>

LA Times<br>
By Kari Howard<br>
March 29, 2014,</strong><br>
<br>
IWhile editing my current story, I listened to my Spotify playlist of 
the bleaker songs on Bruce Springsteen’s “The River.” (Yes, I created a 
playlist of grim Springsteen. Is that odd?)<br>
It’s always seemed like a schizophrenic record, perhaps because it’s a 
slightly bloated two-album release. Half of the songs are your classic E
 Street rockers like “Sherry Darling” and “Crush on You,” the kind of 
songs Springsteen fills with “little darlins.”<br>
I prefer the other half, some of the darkest of his career: “Point 
Blank,” “Fade Away,” “Stolen Car,” “The Price You Pay,” “Drive All 
Night,” “Wreck on the Highway” and, finally, one of his best songs, “The
 River.” (Is a dream a lie if it don’t come true/Or is it something 
worse?)</div>

March 29, 1992|<br>
By Greg Kot.<br>
CHICAGO TRIBUNE</strong><br>
	 <br>
Human Touch (Columbia) 3.5 stars<br>
Lucky Town (Columbia) 4 stars<br>
<br>
With his first albums in 4 1/2 years, Bruce Springsteen doesn`t 
re-invent himself or his art, but tries to cut to their essence. With 
``Human Touch,``he approaches the level of his best work, and on ``Lucky
 Town`` he equals it. ``Human Touch`` was recorded with numerous outside
 musicians at several Los Angeles studios, and it is the more overtly 
``commercial`` of the two albums.<br>
<br>
After it was completed, Springsteen continued to write songs, playing 
most of the instruments and recording at his home studio in L.A. The 
resulting album, ``Lucky Town,`` is one of his greatest.<br>
<br>
On the 14 songs of ``Human Touch,`` Springsteen reasserts his knowledge 
and mastery of the tradition he works in, a synthesis of `60s rock and 
soul seasoned with a jazzy mood piece (``With Every Wish``) and an 
acoustic reworking of a traditional ballad (``Pony Boy``).<br>
<br>
Like his 1984 blockbuster ``Born in the U.S.A.,`` many of its songs sound tailor-made for a stadium tour.<br>
<br>
Much was made of Springsteen`s decision to part ways with his longtime E
 Street Band, but on ``Human Touch`` drummer Jeff Porcaro and bassist 
Randy Jackson (abetted by E Street pianist Roy Bittan) sound like an E 
Street replica. Porcaro in particular could pass for longtime 
Springsteen drummer Max Weinberg, with his terse style andrifle-shot 
snare.<br>
<br>
The album`s deepest impression, however, is made by the singers. In the 
past, Springsteen tended to mumble on the ballads and rush through the 
rockers. But here he sings with clarity and force, even as he is pushed 
to the emotional brink by guest vocalists such as soul veteran Bobby 
King, Sam Moore (of Sam and Dave) and Bobby Hatfield (of the Righteous 
Brothers).<br>
<br>
Lyrically, ``Human Touch`` picks up where Springsteen`s last studio 
album, ``Tunnel of Love,`` left off in 1987, exploring the ambiguity and
 doubt that erode the ideal of ever-lasting love.<br>
<br>
With the 6 1/2-minute title track, a soul-fired rocker, Springsteen 
establishes the album`s premise-that all we can ask of love is temporary
 shelter-then explores it from many stylistic and emotional angles 
through the album`s first half.<br>
<br>
With the rockabilly-flavored ``57 Channels (And Nothin` On),`` the 
churning ``Gloria`s Eyes`` and the jazzy ``With Every Wish,`` 
Springsteen suggests that love can never outlast our restlessness, that 
security and permanence are illusions. The sexually charged ``Cross My 
Heart,`` ``Soul Driver`` and ``Roll of the Dice`` imply that even in 
this imperfect and impermanent state, love is worth it all anyway.<br>
<br>
But with ``Man`s Job`` and ``Real Man,`` Springsteen`s writing falters<br>
<br>
(``. . . <em class="text-italics">takin` care of you darlin`/Ain`t for one of the boys,</em>`` he sings on<br>
``Man`s Job``), and these cliches make the last half of the album a bumpier ride.<br>
<br>
If ``Human Touch`` could stand a little pruning, ``Lucky Town`` is a 
model of concision and coherence. Its 10 songs are sparse lyrically and 
instrumentally, and-like all great albums, from ``The Band`` to ``Blood 
on the Tracks``-they are almost unimaginable without one another. Each 
song resonates more deeply because of those that immediately precede and
 follow it.<br>
<br>
Ironically, the big-rock songs on ``Human Touch`` are introspective, 
preoccupied with small victories and momentary respite from a world 
spinning out of the singer`s reach.<br>
<br>
On ``Lucky Town,`` however, the singer plunges outward, even as the 
music becomes more intimate. The album is soaked in blues and country 
influences, and made even earthier by the twangy affectations in 
Springsteen`s voice.<br>
<br>
``But it`s a sad man, my friend, who`s livin` in his own skin/And can`t 
stand the company,`` Springsteen sings on the first track, ``Better 
Days.``<br>
<br>
One listener who had heard the album months ago compared its theme to 
that of the recent movie ``Grand Canyon,`` and drew a parallel between 
Springsteen`s ``sad man`` and the character played by Kevin Kline.<br>
In the movie, Kline`s life has sunken into mid-life malaise, only to be 
transformed by a stranger`s act of courage. Springsteen`s script isn`t 
nearly as unbelievable or maudlin as much of the film`s, but the 
comparison is apt.<br>
<br>
The search for redemption begins at the bottom of ``The Big Muddy,``<br>
which conjures up the doom-ridden blues of Robert Johnson. One can 
practically hear the flies buzzing around a carcass in the Delta swamp.<br>
<br>
``<em class="text-italics">Waist deep in the big muddy,</em>`` Springsteen moans, ``<em class="text-italics">you start on higher ground but end up somehow crawlin`.``</em><br>
<br>
He is pulled from the muck in ``Living Proof,`` in which the love of a 
woman is compared to godliness. Two beautiful ballads, ``Book of 
Dreams`` and the hymn-like ``If I Should Fall Behind,`` are like prayers
 of thanks.<br>
<em class="text-italics"><br>
``Tonight I`m drinkin` in the forgiveness/This life provides,``</em><br>
<br>
Springsteen sings on the former.<br>
<br>
The album concludes with two songs that are emotional book-ends. ``Souls
 of the Departed`` is a blistering indictment of a world too corrupt to 
save itself, and not even the singer is spared: ``Now I ply my trade in 
the land of king dollar/Where you get paid and your silence passes as 
honor,`` he wails, before an abrasive guitar solo.<br>
<br>
Then, in ``My Beautiful Reward,`` the spare elegance of Springsteen`s 
verse takes on the healing power of poetry, bringing the album full 
circle:<br>
<em class="text-italics"><br>
Tonight I can feel the cold wind at my back<br>
I`m flyin` high over gray fields, my feathers long and black<br>
Down along the river`s silent edge I soar<br>
Searching for my beautiful reward<br>
</em><br>
-``<strong class="text-strong">My Beautiful Reward,``</strong> <br>
<br>
It suggests that there may never be a solution to life`s anguish, but that the search itself is salvation enough.</div>

<br>
May 14, 2009|<br>
By Greg Kot, <br>
CHICAGO TRIBUNE </strong><br>
<br>
All hail Jay Weinberg.<br>
Familiar name, new face. He's the teenage son of longtime E Street Band 
drummer Max Weinberg, and he and Dad have been sharing timekeeping 
duties on the current Bruce Springsteen tour, which played to a sold-out
 house Tuesday at the United Center.<br>
<br>
With the younger Weinberg in the drum chair for the final two-thirds of 
the three-hour show, the band's chemistry was slightly unsettled for the
 better. Jay Weinberg hits just as hard as his father and is a touch 
looser, less predictable. Reports suggest that he is working with the 
band as a future substitute for his father when Max Weinberg must 
fulfill his duties as band leader for "The Tonight Show with Conan 
O'Brien," which debuts in June. Jay Weinberg's fills during "Radio 
Nowhere" kicked the song, and the concert, into a higher gear and 
galvanized a band that was starting to pace itself.<br>
Springsteen smiled in approval. He had to love the kid's energy.<br>
Springsteen is about as consistent as a performer gets. You pay, he 
plays until he drops. You may not love all the songs -- you may wish 
he'd play "Glory Days" or that obscure B side no one else knows except 
you, but Springsteen always works his tail off.<br>
All of that was still true Tuesday, but his longtime E Street Band is in
 transition. It is a band of pros, and they do their jobs well, but they
 lack the physicality, the sustained urgency of their prime. Slowly, the
 band is being retooled. Stellar organist Danny Federici died last year 
and has been replaced by Charles Giordano. Patti Scialfa, Springsteen's 
wife and backing vocalist, was home in New Jersey with their three 
children. Violinist Soozie Tyrell, a relative newcomer, has assumed a 
larger role, and longtime saxophonist Clarence Clemons a smaller one, in
 part because he has been hobbled by ailing hips.<br>
Springsteen has always played his band like a small orchestra, and its 
versatility allowed him to explore the widest contours of his catalog. 
He ranged from the stark blues of "Seeds" to the Celtic celebration of 
"American Land." The E Streeters expertly negotiated the ebb and surge 
of Jimmy Cliff's "Trapped" and the gospel drama of "The Rising." And 
they figured out the chord changes for Tommy James and the Shondells' 
1968 garage-rock classic "Mony, Mony" during the audience-request 
portion.<br>
"Doesn't it have some weird bridge?" Springsteen asked guitarist Steve 
Van Zandt. It did, and they crossed it unscathed, in one of those 
smile-inducing moments that echoed the band's early days, when 
Springsteen used to shout out impromptu covers with mischievous 
regularity.<br>
If there was a disappointment, it was that Springsteen didn't make a 
stronger case for his latest album, "Working on a Dream." I'm not a fan 
of the album, but I always look forward to how the singer reinvents his 
studio work on the stage. In this case, however, he barely touched the 
new material, which was a shame because he did a marvelous job of 
turning "Outlaw Pete" into a theatrical, Old West showpiece after 
donning a black cowboy hat, with spaghetti western guitars, Tyrell's 
campfire fiddle and Grand Canyon reverb on the vocals.<br>
<br>
As usual, Springsteen divvied up the show into thematic sections. Among 
the strongest was the topical trinity of "Seeds," "Johnny 99" and "The 
Ghost of Tom Joad," a seething commentary on blue-collar citizens 
brought to the brink of desperation by hard times. Each was punctuated 
by a nasty guitar solo: Springsteen channeling the mantra of "It's gone,
 gone, it's all gone" on "Seeds" with a vengeance through his 
instrument, then Van Zandt riding hard with "Johnny 99" and Nils Lofgren
 spinning out from Max Weinberg's surging drums on "Joad."<br>
The show started to settle a bit after the midway point, but Jay 
Weinberg took care of that problem. During "Waitin' on a Sunny Day," one
 of his more enthusiastic fills brought an arched eyebrow and a smile 
from bassist Garry Tallent. The newcomer wanted to run, and the band had
 no choice but to rise to the challenge.<br>
- - -<br>
Springsteen's show: A 6-part epic<br>
At nearly three hours and covering 26 songs, Bruce Springsteen packed 
several subplots into a typically generous concert Tuesday at the 
sold-out United Center.<br>
He's a master at reconfiguring his songs and sequencing them in concert 
to create thematic statements. Here's how he divvied up Tuesday's show:<br>
Part 1: Is anybody alive out there?<br>
"Badlands," "Spirit in the Night" and "Outlaw Pete" open the show, as if
 to get the lay of the land, the sprawl of what is to come. They are all
 songs about restlessness, and Springsteen wanders into the audience 
several times during "Spirit" to exchange handshakes, hugs, a kiss. 
"Outlaw Pete" is among his most mythical creations in a songwriting 
career founded on mythical characters. He's so marginalized he 
disappears into Big Sky Country. "Can you hear me?" Springsteen wails 
after donning a black cowboy hat.<br>
Part 2: Romance<br>
<br>
She's the One" and "Working on a Dream": Lust set to a Bo Diddley beat, then love nestles inside a big, spacious ballad.<br>
Part 3: Reality<br>
"Seeds," "Johnny 99" and "The Ghost of Tom Joad" plunge the audience 
back into the now. Songs for citizens running short on hope and 
possibility in tough times, the poignancy is crowded by anger, funneled 
through three nasty guitar solos capping each song by Springsteen, Steve
 Van Zandt and Nils Lofgren.<br>
<br>
<br>
Part 4: Making it up as we go along<br>
The darkness lifts for "Raise Your Hand." Then the audience-request 
portion of the show: A cover of Jimmy Cliff's "Trapped" and "Candy's 
Room" are longtime Springsteen concert staples. But next comes Tommy 
James and the Shondells' 1968 frat-party classic "Mony, Mony," which 
Springsteen says the band has never played before. They figure out the 
chord changes and the bridge on the fly, and make it through like a 
grinning garage band.<br>
Part 5: Give the drummer some<br>
Teenager Jay Weinberg replaces his father, Max, on drums, and instantly 
kicks things into a higher gear. He finds his footing on "Waitin' on a 
Sunny Day" and "The Promised Land," then slams out "Radio Nowhere" with 
such force that the whole arena feels as if its battery has been 
recharged. "Lonesome Day" packs unusual punch, "The Rising" is stoked 
with drama, and "Born to Run" is one of those obligations that never 
feels like one.<br>
Part 5 1/2: Almost forgot the new album<br>
Springsteen usually makes the case for his latest album on tour. Not so 
on this night. He performs only four songs from his recent studio 
release, "Working on a Dream," including "The Wrestler" and "Kingdom of 
Days," sandwiched inconspicuously between "The Promised Land" and 
"Lonesome Day."<br>
Part 6: Encore<br>
Stephen Foster's 1855 plea, "Hard Times Come Again No More," receives a 
stark but powerful treatment with voices rising above acoustic 
instruments. The crowd-pleasing "Jungleland" allows Clarence Clemons to 
reprise his carefully composed saxophone "solo" and receive a pat on the
 back from the Boss. "Land of Hope and Dreams" gives way to the 
Celtic-flavored "American Land," inspired by Springsteen's recent 
exploration of the Pete Seeger songbook. "Dancing in the Dark" and the 
always welcome "Rosalita" close the show in high-energy style.<br>

<br>
September 22, 2009|<br>
By Greg Kot, <br>
CHICAGO TRIBUNE </strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band came to the United Center on 
Sunday promising to give only the second public performance of the "Born
 to Run" album. They delivered and then some in a concert that had twice
 the energy of their performance at the same venue in May.<br>
The 1975 album has held up well -- six of its eight songs are in regular
 rotation at Springsteen concerts, and I've yet to see one of his shows 
where the title track hasn't been a highlight. But there was an 
undeniable, cumulative power in seeing the album performed in sequence, 
its arch of youthful possibility traced from the promise of "Thunder 
Road" to the desperate rituals of "Jungleland."<br>
<br>
Springsteen, who turns 60 on Wednesday, was not pacing himself. He had 
no stories to tell, no shtick to indulge, no time to waste. He slammed 
songs together like bumper cars, barely pausing for breath and changing 
guitars on the fly as he played it hard and fast for nearly three hours.
 He made sure the E Streeters followed suit.<br>
They looked tired the last time they were in town, with a cameo 
appearance by Max Weinberg's son Jay making much of an impression. But 
this time, Springsteen put the band, which expanded to as many as 11 
pieces for some songs, through its paces with James Brown-like rigor. He
 laughingly chided the band for messing up "Working on a Dream," then 
later acknowledged that he missed a verse. He urged on solos and 
orchestrated the interplay, part cheerleader, part taskmaster.<br>
The band responded with an inspired performance, in particular Clarence 
Clemons, who appeared to be sinking into the shadows in May. This time, 
he was engaged from the get-go, even discarding his fedora to beam a few
 smiles in between sax solos. The rhythm section had a great night. 
Garry Tallent's bass boomed out a clarion call to dance, and Max 
Weinberg channeled '60s session great Hal Blaine on a powerhouse cover 
of The Ronettes' "Da Do Ron Ron."<br>
Though the "Born to Run" songs are part of any Springsteen fan's DNA by 
now, the familiarity hardly diminished the impact -- particularly when 
the band swung into the album's formidable midsection: "Backstreets," 
"Born to Run" and "She's the One," complete with Yardbirds-style 
rave-up.<br>
With its dramatic introductions and ebb-and-flow arrangements, the album
 served as a fine showcase for the orchestral possibilities of the band,
 notably Weinberg's timpani-style drumming and the keyboard interplay of
 Roy Bittan and Charles Giordano. Particularly effective was "Meeting 
Across the River," one of the few mood pieces of the night, with Curt 
Ramm's lonely trumpet and Richard Davis' upright bass spearheading a 
smoky, cabaret quartet treatment.<br>
There was a danger that everything after "Born to Run" would be 
anticlimactic, and, frankly, some of it was. But Springsteen wouldn't 
allow any letup. He closed the main set with a roaring "Badlands," and 
the seven-song encore was performed with house lights up. There have 
been times when "Rosalita" closed shows out of obligation. On this 
night, it was a deserved celebration.</div>

<br>
September 27, 2002|<br>
By Greg Kot,<br>
<br>
CHICAGO Tribune </strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen was working it but not yet blowing the doors down 
Wednesday at the United Center. Perhaps that's the best we could expect 
at this stage of his career--solemn work, earnest music, 
well-intentioned sentiments. But not transcendence, not a moment when 
the hairs on the back of the neck stand at attention. It's not 1978 
anymore, and every tour since has pulled a little further away from that
 peak.<br>
Then Springsteen and the E Street Band locked into "Worlds Apart," the 
most adventurous song on "The Rising," his new album of post-Sept. 11 
songs, and something clicked. Fiddle and accordion, finger-cymbals and 
mournful voices conjured a world of sound, East meeting West on the 
stage. "We've got this moment now to live, then it's all just dust and 
dark," Springsteen sang, clinging to hope. Then the singer and Steve Van
 Zandt faced off, the mourning compressed into their storming guitars, 
blood trickling from one of Springsteen's fingertips as he slashed the 
strings.<br>
<br>
<br>
Feedback lingered and the E Streeters crashed into "Badlands," Max 
Weinberg's wrists pouncing cobralike at the cymbals, a defiant sound in 
the face of heartbreak, then with the final chord fading they plunged 
into "She's the One," with its monolithic Bo Diddley beat. Grief turned 
to rage, then release. It was one of those moments when a concert finds 
its feet and lodges in the memory, a keeper--even by Springsteen's high 
standards.<br>
His concerts lately have been more about comfort than confrontation, 
ritual rather than surprise. Fans cheer Clarence Clemons before he plays
 his saxophone, because they already know what notes they're going to 
hear, and the "Big Man" inevitably delivers. There will be Van Zandt 
mugging in his gypsy finery and sharing a microphone with "The Boss." 
And there will be Springsteen climbing atop Roy Bittan's grand piano to 
lead the crowd in a sing-along, this time during "Mary's Place."<br>
But Springsteen's tours are never static, and in the seven weeks since 
the current road trip opened in New Jersey, the set is still a work in 
progress, as though Springsteen were still trying to figure out what 
tone to strike. It was disappointing that one of his most pointed and 
controversial recent songs, "American Skin (41 Shots)," has been dropped
 from the set list, and he's once again performing "Born in the USA" as 
an arena anthem rather than a caustic blues about duty and reward.<br>
But Springsteen has discovered the heart of several new songs: "Empty 
Sky" was performed as a sparse, mountain-soul duet with his wife, Patti 
Scialfa, their high harmonies evoking the eerie tone of a musical saw; 
"My City of Ruins" as a solo piano piece transformed into a gospel 
chant; and "Into the Fire" winding down as an a cappella hymn.<br>
The singer--graying but still vital in blue-collar black--also worked 
the back pages of his catalog, resurrecting "Jackson Cage" from "The 
River" (1980) and "For You" from his 1973 debut album. The latter was 
performed alone at the piano, transforming a song of youthful desire 
into a plea for community.<br>
For that's ultimately what Springsteen's music tries to achieve. Though 
"The Rising" is being chastised in some quarters for not being indignant
 enough, Springsteen's musical politics have always been tempered by a 
fundamental compassion, an inclusiveness that throws its arms wide 
around an audience, with the house lights illuminating their joint 
efforts. When Pearl Jam singer and Evanston native Eddie Vedder joined 
Springsteen to take the lead vocal on "My Hometown," it was only 
fitting. At its best, Springsteen's music expands to meet the moment. 
It's big enough for everyone to climb into its embrace.</div>

<br>
Springsteen Adopts Preacher's Role, Delivers The Goods<br>
<br>
September 29, 1999|<br>
By Greg Kot, <br>
CHICAGO TRIBUNE</strong><br>
<br>
He came out spoiling not for a fight but for renewal, securing "The Ties
 That Bind" with loud guitars, thundering drums and a few trusted 
friends he met in Jersey more than 25 years ago when he was a much 
younger, skinnier and brasher man. And he left on the last ride, bound 
for the "Land of Hope and Dreams" on the tracks of a gospel hymn so 
sweet that it didn't so much end the concert as send it floating out 
into the night, bound by our collective memories of this moment, this 
singular performer.<br>
In between those twin peaks, which came three bountiful hours apart 
Monday at the United Center, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band 
played with not just verve and passion, but with a joy that couldn't be 
feigned and a kinship that went beyond professional obligation. It was 
all a little corny at times, like the improbable script for a Neil Simon
 play about a coed, biracial rock 'n' roll band that rises from the East
 Coast boardwalks into the hearts and minds of millions: the Boss and 
the Big Man (Clarence Clemons), the Professor (Roy Bittan) and Miami 
Steve (Van Zandt), Mighty Max (Weinberg) and his silent bass-playing 
sidekick, Garry Tallent, accordion-playing Danny Federici, willowy Patti
 Scialfa, diminutive Nils Lofgren. Who are these people? Cartoon 
characters?<br>
<br>
<br>
In a way they are, flesh-and- blood caricatures who remind us of a more 
innocent time, even as they confront what it means to be alive in the 
waning hours of the 20th Century. Springsteen's epic "Tenth Avenue 
Freeze Out" played like a tribute to his comrades, so devoid of cynicism
 and irony it couldn't possibly be a product of contemporary culture. 
And yet, it stakes its claim almost defiantly. On this tour, his first 
with the E Streeters in more than a decade, Springsteen is reclaiming 
something far deeper than a rock 'n' roll band. He's trying to remind 
himself of what matters under the guise of a reunion show that trots out
 most of the hits (and plenty of the obscurities too).<br>
"I can't promise you life everlasting, but I can promise you life right now!"<br>
It was Springsteen adopting the preacher's role the only way he knows 
how: redemption by way of the devil's music. All sinners welcome.<br>
He played it for laughs, a big guffaw with a streak of darkness straight
 out of a Frank Capra movie, full of the knowledge that bad things 
happen to good people all the time, and there isn't much we can do about
 it.<br>
Except: "I will wait for you/Should I fall behind/Wait for me."<br>
The penultimate song for virtually every concert on this tour has been 
"If I Should Fall Behind," with Springsteen and his bandmates taking 
solo turns, one by one offering assurance, until the five vocalists are 
massed around a single microphone, a doo-wop group on a dimly lit street
 corner lifting a prayer wrapped in harmony.<br>
The entire show seems designed to lead up to that moment-- a slow dance,
 understated and poignant. In the past, Springsteen's concerts 
inevitably concluded with exhausting rock 'n' roll medleys and were 
punctuated by fist-pumping anthems such as "Born in the USA"--a notable 
absentee on this tour. Instead, the E Streeters are pushing the outer 
edges of their vocabulary: more reflective than ever on the twangy 
ballad "The Mansion on the Hill," a moodier and even more somber "The 
River," an acoustic "The Ghost of Tom Joad," and yet sounding almost 
unhinged on a fevered reinvention of the once-placid "Youngstown" and a 
bone-crushing "Murder Incorporated," before pulling out of the tailspin 
with a defiant "Badlands."<br>
Springsteen has had better nights as a singer. Even though he pulled off
 some eerie falsetto cries, his once chesty baritone sometimes lacked 
character; he enunciated poorly and settled for a sub-Dylanish rasp on 
"Meeting Across the River."<br>
But his authority as a performer and the depth and enthusiasm of his 
belief were awe-inspiring. His once scrawny frame is beefier, the hair 
thinner, and his kids are growing up. The songs reflected that reality, 
and the band played them with such zest that the only special effect 
required was the "On" switch for the house lights. Throughout the show, 
the concertgoers became not just Springsteen's audience, but his 
companions, his foils, an extension of his band.<br>
It was, above all, a gesture of trust. It's why Springsteen still 
delivers the goods in concert; talented enough to lead, humble enough to
 know he can't do it alone. "Should I fall behind, wait for me."</div>

Springsteen, E Street Band Reunite After A Decade For World Tour<br>
April 12, 1999|<br>
By Steve Knopper. <br>
<br>
CHICAGO Tribune.</strong><br>
<br>
BARCELONA, Spain — Though Bruce Springsteen had to read his Spanish 
remarks from a prepared speech and didn't do the song about Spanish 
Johnny, the language barrier made no difference. His first show with the
 E Street Band in a decade Friday night made sense in almost any 
dialect.<br>
Every time Springsteen paused for breath, and that was rare in an almost
 three-hour show that left the singer's shirt drenched with sweat, 
19,000 fans chanted the "Ole" soccer anthem. One Spanish-speaking fan 
draped himself in an American flag; another wore a New Jersey sweat 
shirt.<br>
<br>
<br>
Americans showed up too. Brennan Hughes, 19, a student from Whitefish, 
Mont., living in Barcelona, said he received tickets from "my dad's 
secretary, who's married to somebody who knows Bruce Springsteen."<br>
Low on experimentation and high on renewing old friendships, the Palau 
Sant Jordi arena concert proved the E Street Band's thunderous 
bar-and-stadium rock is as tight as ever, especially on straightforward 
anthems like "Badlands," "Out in the Street" and "She's the One."<br>
In a night of big moments--like a four-guitar "Born to Run" and a 
version of "Light of Day" that began as punk rock and downshifted into 
gospel testifying--the little moments distinguished Springsteen's 
reunion with the E Street Band. Guitarist Nils Lofgren stood on his 
tiptoes to reach the microphone. During "Out in the Street," Clarence 
"The Big Man" Clemons playfully lifted Lofgren out of his way.<br>
"We're not here for a vacation to your lovely seaside community," 
Springsteen declared, fast-talking like a preacher running an auction. 
"We're here for a purpose . . . to rededicate you to the power, the 
magic, the mystery, the monastery of rock 'n' roll."<br>
The E Street Band, which began with Springsteen in scruffy New Jersey 
nightclubs in the early '70s, hasn't performed with its old boss since 
1989. For the past decade, the singer-songwriter has played acoustic 
solo tours, collaborated with a makeshift rock and soul revue and 
experimented with guitar-and-synthesizer music like "Streets of 
Philadelphia."<br>
Springsteen spent equal time on hard-rock anthems, especially a 
screaming-guitar version of "Murder Incorporated," and bitter 
country-folk songs like the rejiggered "Youngstown" and "Mansion on the 
Hill." His experiments failed a couple of times, such as an unfocused 
attempt to make 1981's "The River" more soulful with jazzy saxophone 
solos.<br>
All eight members of the mid-'80s E Street Band have returned, including
 Springsteen's wife, singer Patti Scialfa; drummer Max Weinberg, on 
hiatus from "Late Night With Conan O'Brien"; guitarist Steve Van Zandt, 
who stars in HBO's New Jersey mobster drama "The Sopranos"; organist 
Danny Federici, who recorded a solo album; and bassist Garry Tallent and
 pianist Roy Bittan, who have produced artists from Dave Alvin to 
Lucinda Williams.<br>
Springsteen emphasized songs of friendship and loyalty, opening with "My
 Love Will Not Let You Down" and closing with a hymnlike "If I Should 
Fall Behind," in which Van Zandt, Scialfa, Clemons and Lofgren split the
 "wait for me" choruses while Springsteen strummed his guitar nearby.</div>

His music more alive without E Street Band<br>
August 14, 2005|<br>
By Greg Kot, <br>
CHICAGO Tribune music critic</strong><br>
<br>
This month, Bruce Springsteen is quietly wrapping up a solo tour of 
North America. In the wake of an acoustic album, "Devils and Dust," that
 has already drifted off the charts, he is playing to audiences 
one-fifth the size that would normally see one of his arena tours with 
the E Street Band.<br>
<br>
But Springsteen is making some of the best music of his career this 
summer, and he hasn't been this engrossing and unpredictable on a 
concert stage since the '70s. There are none of the rituals, jokes and 
choreography that have dusted recent E Street tours with shtick and 
nostalgia. As he sweated buckets leading Clarence Clemons, Steve Van 
Zandt and the rest of his loyal clan in another chorus line on the last E
 Street tour, at least some longtime Springsteen watchers had to feel a 
little sad. Most of the fans loved it, and the band members stuffed away
 their retirement money, but Springsteen the artist had settled into 
routine. Here was one of the greatest rock performers living out one of 
his best-known lyrics: "Glory days, they'll pass you by . . . in the 
wink of a young girl's eye."<br>
<br>
Last weekend in a solo concert at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee, where
 he gave a performance that eclipsed even his fine show three months 
earlier at the Rosemont Theatre, it was Springsteen doing the winking. 
The singer walked the line between loose-limbed self-confidence and 
iron-willed purpose; he was smiling and laughing like a man completely 
at ease with himself and his audience. He was clearly having a ball 
rummaging around in the back alleys of his extraordinary songbook.<br>
<br>
Better off<br>
<br>
It prompts a heretical conclusion: At this point in his career, the 
singer is better off without the E Street Band. He may not sell as many 
concert tickets or albums. But he's a more daring artist: darker, 
stranger, more at liberty to challenge himself and surprise his 
audience.<br>
<br>
He opened with a rarely performed B-side from the early '80s, "Shut Out 
the Light." The arrangement was little more than a droning handful of 
chords on a pump organ, and it foreshadowed the adventure to follow. 
"Reason to Believe" arrived next, a swamp blues with Springsteen howling
 into his harmonica microphone while stomping the floorboards with a 
boot heel. He would build on these musical ideas for the remainder of 
the two-hour-plus concert, using trancelike patterns to evoke dreams, 
reveries, hallucinations.<br>
<br>
Throughout, he tinkered with arrangements, tempo and melody, as if to 
slap the songs out of their comfort zones. On electric guitar, he used a
 modified "Theme from Peter Gunn" rhythm to evoke the feverish paranoia 
of "State Trooper." On acoustic guitar, he barely touched the strings as
 he knocked out a syncopated backdrop for a desolate "Promised Land." 
His electric keyboards drifted woozily as he shivered through the 
betrayals of "Point Blank."<br>
<br>
What's startling to realize is that Springsteen is still growing as a 
musician and a singer. His piano playing has improved markedly in the 
last few months, as he built undulating patterns beneath the sparse 
chords of "Racing in the Street." The richness also resonated on the 
electric keyboards for the lovely "All That Heaven Will Allow," which he
 connected to the pocket symphonies of '70s power-pop group the 
Raspberries. And he surrounded "Darkness on the Edge of Town" with 
ringing, rapidly strummed overtones on an acoustic 12-string.<br>
<br>
As a vocalist, he's using his voice not just to convey lyrics, but to 
shade them in new colors. His high, eerie, feminine cry sounded like a 
cross between Roy Orbison and a wind-whipped musical saw on the ghostly 
"Leah." Dropping to a whisper, or pulling away from the microphone and 
letting his voice fade, Springsteen used his voice to orchestrate mood 
as skillfully as he did with guitars and keyboards.<br>
<br>
Family and religion<br>
<br>
As resonant as individual moments were, they accumulated power in the 
way they played off one another. This was a show built around twin 
themes: family and religion, and, as Springsteen said, "The poetry, the 
mystery, the terror . . . " inherent in both. He said he was moved by 
the "images of transcendence and belief" in his Catholic upbringing yet 
constantly at war with what the church's unwavering authority 
represented in his life.<br>
<br>
This conflict underscored many of the songs, from "My Father's House" to
 "Jesus Was an Only Son," in which Springsteen ruminated on what might 
have been had the world's most renowned martyr lived long enough to have
 a family. It went unspoken, but Springsteen has been cast in the role 
of a rock 'n' roll savior a few times in his career. With the American 
flag as a backdrop and the E Street Band at his side, he has played the 
superhero who could rock any stadium to its knees. It was with him in 
this role that Springsteen's songs became miscast as arena anthems, the 
anxiety and turmoil coursing through them flattened by the need to 
entertain 20,000 fans a night.<br>
<br>
But Springsteen the solo performer doesn't have to play to the back row 
of the arena. He can shrink the songs back to a more human dimension, 
and they can breathe again. Their finely tuned details change shape on 
any given night, depending on how Springsteen wants to perform them. His
 songs haven't sounded this adaptable, mutable and alive in decades.<br>
It's why the singer's interpretation of "Dream Baby Dream," the eerie 
hymn by New York electro-punk duo Suicide, has closed many of the 
concerts on this tour. It allows Springsteen to end the show as he began
 it: singing over the undulating drone of the pump organ. The words are 
almost childlike: "Dream, baby, dream . . . we gotta keep the light 
burnin' ... C'mon, baby, dry your eyes . . . I just wanna see you 
smile." But as Springsteen sang them with gradually escalating fervor, 
they took on a hypnotic power.<br>
<br>
With eyes closed, he was as riveting as drag queen Dean Stockwell 
serenading Dennis Hopper with a Roy Orbison song in the David Lynch 
movie "Blue Velvet." It was a type of intimacy rarely seen from 
Springsteen before. The words were reassuring, but the music was not, 
and the effect was electrifying.</div>

<br>
Bruce Springsteen's work was done for the moment. The first set had 
ended Sunday at the sold-out United Center, the chords of "Badlands" 
still ringing, and he was waving his appreciation to the audience. But 
he didn't let go of his guitar, hoisting it above his head as the E 
Street Band gathered around him.<br>
It was a fitting image for an evening in which Springsteen chopped away 
at his guitar like he was going to war, driving his band through 135 
no-nonsense minutes. It was a terse concert by Springsteen's epic, 
three-hour-plus standards, but that relative brevity kept the energy 
high and the momentum-sapping shtick low.<br>
<br>
<br>
"Is there anybody alive out there?" Springsteen shouted at the outset, 
and turned the show's first 45 minutes into a rousing wake-up call. He 
buzzed through eight songs non-stop, one feeding into the next with a 
verve that recalled the band's ferocious heyday, circa 1978. There has 
been a lot of shucking, jiving and mugging on recent E Street tours, but
 this time, sidekick Steve Van Zandt was all business and Clarence 
Clemons hung in the shadows in between sax solos. Van Zandt was back in 
his element as Springsteen's foil as a guitarist and vocalist, and the 
show revolved around their fevered interplay.<br>
The duo set the tone by slamming down the chords of "Radio Nowhere," 
then traded piercing leads on "Gypsy Biker." Van Zandt channeled John 
Lee Hooker's "Boogie Chillen" on a blues-drenched "Reason to Believe," 
Springsteen matching him with an appropriately swampy, fuzzed-out tone 
on harmonica. "Adam Raised a Cain" raised a few goose bumps, Springsteen
 conjuring a wall of drone with his guitar overtones.<br>
Max Weinberg was robo-drummer all night, his steely precision matched by
 the cobralike snap of his wrists on the Bo Diddley syncopation of 
"She's the One." A few party rockers helped keep the mood buoyant; the 
best was "Cadillac Ranch," with bassist Garry Tallent pumping the rhythm
 oil. The worst was "Thundercrack," a rambling frat-rocker that should 
have stayed in the New Jersey bars where Springsteen first played it in 
the early '70s.<br>
Mostly, the set list emphasized the band's most aggressive side, with 
three tracks from the 1978 "Darkness on the Edge of Town" album and a 
rousing "Backstreets" from the 1975 "Born to Run."<br>
The intensity matched the subject matter. Nine of the 23 songs were 
drawn from Springsteen's latest album, "Magic," a series of bleak, 
state-of-the-union snapshots from a dissenter's scrapbook. The only 
awkward moment came in the show's first hour, when Springsteen paused to
 address the fans at length for the only time. The rushed, mumbled 
monologue about citizens' rights and the Constitution briefly broke the 
momentum and came off as sheepish next to his music.<br>
Springsteen was better off when he channeled that anger through the 
instrument in his hands. And for most of the night, it gave one heck of a
 speech.</div>
