<br>
The Washington Post<br>
<br>
By Richard Harrington,<br>
<br>
This article was originally published Aug. 6, 1985.<br>
<br>
At 7:42 last night an ebullient Bruce Springsteen sprinted on to the 
huge stage at RFK Stadium, positioned himself in front of a huge 
American flag and counted off the opening measures of “Born in the 
U.S.A.,” the centerpiece song and title of the album that catapulted him
 to rock messiahdom over the last year.<br>
<br>
Springsteen delivered his edgy saga of a returning Vietnam veteran, 
complete with its catalogue of shattered promises, in a rough-hewn 
performance redeemed at each verse’s end by the catch phrase that has 
come to be his credo:<br>
<br>
“Born in the U.S.A. . . . I’m a cool rockin’ daddy . . . born in the U.S.A.”<br>
<br>
Exactly the sentiments of the 54,000 fans who greeted the song and the 
singer with a cascade of “Bruuuuuuuuces,” a sea of raised fists (which 
would punctuate just about every song for the rest of the night), and a 
full-throated massed choir that defined the instant community that is at
 the heart of every Bruce Springsteen concert.<br>
<br>
As he has done time and again in the decade between Newsweek covers, 
Springsteen immediately renewed the emotional contract that exists 
between him and the only audience that matters, the one he is playing to
 that particular night. For more than three hours, that impassioned 
performance connected his own faith in rock ‘n’ roll with that of his 
fans, a spirit that salvaged even his bleakest material.<br>
<br>
Trafficking in ecstatic rock ‘n’ roll, Springsteen drained spirits only 
to reinfuse them through that instant communion central to his 
performance. “Glory Days,” a wry remembrance of better times than these,
 provoked its own glorious daze of calls and responses, and sometimes 
the Boss let his fans sing introductory verses.<br>
<br>
And when he closed the show with his now-ancient anthem of possibility, 
“Born to Run,” Springsteen seemed as spent as his audience. Which didn’t
 stop him from a lengthy encore of rock ‘n’ roll oldies or a revival of 
an old favorite, “Rosalita.”<br>
<br>
As Springsteen moved through 15 songs in the first half, and an equal 
number in the second, upping the emotional ante on one tune, the 
good-time spirit on the next, the night became a celebration of hope 
anchored in harsh realities, a position poles apart from the 
self-centered escapist esthetic of most modern pop.<br>
<br>
Looking almost awkwardly athletic — as muscular in fact as the music 
itself — Springsteen personified the importance of being earnest. He may
 be reluctant and uncomfortable in his new role as America’s rocks 
populi, but his emotional commitment to and deep identification with 
America’s working class seems both genuine and deeply felt.<br>
<br>
That made songs like “Johnny 99” and “Atlantic City,” both about workers
 laid off and driven to crimes by debts “no honest man can pay,” not 
only believable but instructive. Yet if Springsteen’s “Badlands” are 
even harsher eight years down the road, that song’s key line reflects 
the singer’s resilience: “I believe in the faith that can save me.”<br>
<br>
By the time Springsteen got to Jimmy Cliff’s “Trapped,” another anthem 
of defiance, enough night had fallen for the two giant video screens on 
either side of the stage to kick into action, which immediately made him
 larger than life. That’s apparently what his fans wanted, because the 
show picked up an extra fraction of energy from that point and never 
flagged again.<br>
<br>
In song after song, New Jersey’s favorite son pitted expectations 
against reality, mapped out the distance between dream and daylight, 
examined the shattering impact when those dreams are not just deferred 
but ended.<br>
<br>
Still, whether it was the angry frustration of a new song like “Seeds,” a
 hard rocker verging on metal, or the litany of loss informing tunes 
like “The River,” “Johnny 99” or “My Hometown,” Springsteen always came 
back with a song of hope like “Dancing in the Dark,” “Out in the 
Streets” or “Born to Run,” each offering the distinct promise of 
release.<br>
<br>
Sometimes the songs’ energies were release enough, like the raw 
rockabilly fervor of “Working on a Highway,” the jaunty raunch of 
“Darlington County,” or inspirational reminders like “Hungry Heart,” 
“The Promised Land” and “Thunder Road.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen has become rock’s version of the Great Communicator, even if
 his patriotic positioning is tinged in irony and rooted in an entirely 
different consciousness than the president’s.<br>
<br>
Like Reagan, Springsteen relies on anecdotes (his introduction to the 
wrenching “My Hometown” and a delightful cover of “I Can’t Help Falling 
in Love With You,” no doubt inspired by his recent marriage). He also 
relishes vignettes that celebrate the everyday heroisms of ordinary 
citizens. Springsteen invests home, family and work with their 
traditional importance and lives out those implications, most obviously 
and most publicly in his own work.<br>
<br>
And again like Reagan, Springsteen seems nostalgic for a more innocent 
time, though he suspects it will never return. In “My Hometown” he notes
 the decimation and decay that have changed his old working-class 
neighborhood to the point that he can recognize neither it nor himself.<br>
<br>
Yet even when those key concerns are addressed in desultory 
observations, Springsteen seems to be saying the hope must never die.<br>
<br>
In “Dancing in the Dark,” where Springsteen picked a partner out of the 
audience (just like the video) he points out that “you can’t start a 
fire without a spark” and that seems to be the most enduring message in 
his music.<br>
<br>
A Springsteen concert is a study in orchestrated climaxes centered 
around guitar player Nils Lofgren and saxophonist Clarence Clemons and 
punctuated by Max Weinberg’s Odin-like percussion. No one is better at 
juxtaposing the defiant optimism and boisterous energies of rock ‘n’ 
roll with the gritty realism of the social observer -- Woody Guthrie via
 Phil Spector. Springsteen’s grim news bulletins often travel on raucous
 rails, but they seem to be delivering not only a new audience, but an 
expanded awareness about blue collar issues, much as Live Aid did for 
hunger.<br>
<br>
Springsteen still celebrates the good-time romanticism that once 
centered on cars and girls (in that order), but his tendency is to 
chilly observations about the hard times that have driven the darkness 
from the edge of town to its very heart.<br>
<br>
His work, like his myths, has always been shaped by his live 
performance. Sweating, straining, he gives everything to his audience, 
and they respond in equal measure. The 12,000 people on RFK’s infield 
spent the entire night standing and dancing on their chairs; had anyone 
pulled those chairs away there’s a good chance they wouldn’t have come 
down to earth till show’s end.<br>
<br>
Despite Tina Turner’s protestation, rock does need another hero and 
Springsteen seems to fit the bill. He may not ride a white horse — more 
likely he’ll be driving a pink Cadillac and sitting on a cushion of 
conviction -- but for now he is living up to his own expectations, no 
one else’s.<br>
<br>
On stage, dressed in funky jeans and a vest that revealed a shape 
America would be proud to be in, Springsteen humanized his own myth, 
coming across as a regular Everyguy. He is the common man, singing about
 the common man, to the comman man. The only adjustment he has made at 
this point is accommodation to size, certainly not to spirit or 
integrity. That subtlety may be lost on the new fans, but it’s 
reassuring to his older, loyal constituency.<br>
<br>
The Bruce Springsteen who rocked RFK stadium last night was the same 
sincere, directed performer who has maintained both a hungry heart and a
 faith in the power of rock ‘n’ roll. As he sang at one point, “We made a
 promise, we swore we’d always remember, no retreat, no surrender.” For 
Bruce Springsteen, that is not just a promise; it is a premise for a 
better future.</div>

Tunnel of Love<br>
Columbia<br>
<br>
By<br>
 STEVE POND<br>
October 3, 1987</strong><br>
<br>
So Bruce Springsteen met a girl, fell in love, got married and made an 
album of songs about meeting a girl, falling in love and getting 
married. And if you think it's that cut and dried, you don't know 
Springsteen. Far from being a series of hymns to cozy domesticity, 
Tunnel of Love is an unsettled and unsettling collection of hard looks 
at the perils of commitment. A decade or so ago, Springsteen acquired a 
reputation for romanticizing his subject matter; on this album he 
doesn't even romanticize romance.<br>
Tunnel of Love is precisely the right move for an artist whose enormous 
success gloriously affirmed the potential of arena rock &amp; roll but 
exacted a toll on the singer. Born in the U.S.A. sold 12 million copies 
mostly because it was the best kind of thoughtful, tough, mainstream 
rock &amp; roll record — but also because it was misinterpreted and 
oversimplified by listeners looking for slogans rather than ideas. When 
Springsteen hit the road to support that album, his sound got bigger, 
his gestures larger, his audience huger. The five-record live set that 
followed that tour was a suitably oversize way to sum up Bruce 
Springsteen, the Boss, American Rock Icon.<br>
But where do you go from there? Trying to top Born in the U.S.A. with 
another collection of rock anthems would have been foolhardy 
artistically; on the other hand, to react the way Springsteen did after 
the breakthrough 1980 success of The River — with a homemade record as 
stark and forbidding as Nebraska — would have turned an inspired gesture
 into a formula. So Tunnel of Love walks a middle ground. The most 
intelligently arranged album Springsteen has made, it consists mostly of
 his own tracks, sparingly overdubbed; he uses the members of the E 
Street Band when they fit. It's not, as was rumored, a country album, 
though Springsteen sings it in the colloquial, folkish voice he used on 
Nebraska, and it's not a rock &amp; roll album, though "Spare Parts" and
 "Brilliant Disguise" come close to the full-bodied E Street Band sound.<br>
Instead, this is a varied, modestly scaled, modern-sounding pop album; 
it is a less ambitious work than Born in the U.S.A., but its simpler 
sound is perfectly suited to the more intimate stories Springsteen is 
telling. Although you could often hear the sweat on his previous 
records, this LP came surprisingly quickly and feels effortless and 
elegant rather than belabored. Crucially, it demystifies Springsteen's 
often arduous album-making process.<br>
But energy rather than elegance is what sold Born in the U.S.A.; the 
scaled-down Tunnel of Love is thus a chancier commercial proposition. 
The songs are the kind that many of the fans at the last tour's stadium 
shows talked through. Listeners who turn to Springsteen for outsize 
gestures and roaring radio rock may well be confused or even irritated 
by these more somber miniatures and may insist on reading a first-rate 
song collection as an aberration.<br>
Initially, in fact, Tunnel of Love sounds not only modest but also 
playful, giddy and lightweight. "Ain't Got You" is a funny, partially a 
cappella Bo Diddley-style rocker that jokes about Springsteen's wealth 
("I got a pound of caviar sitting home on ice/I got a fancy foreign car 
that rides like paradise") but expresses yearning for the one thing 
money can't buy (i.e., "you"). In the next two songs, "Tougher Than the 
Rest" and "All That Heaven Will Allow," Springsteen is head over heels 
in love, convinced that the sun will shine as long as he's got the right
 woman by his side. <br>
From that point on, times are tough. In "Cautious Man," the main 
character has "love" tattooed on one hand, "fear" on the other 
(Springsteen's lift from the film The Night of the Hunter, in which 
Robert Mitchum played a preacher with "love" and "hate" tattooed on his 
knuckles). The relationships in "Two Faces," "Brilliant Disguise" and 
"One Step Up" ("and two steps back") are crumbling as trust gives way to
 betrayal and recrimination: "Another fight and I slam the door 
on/Another battle in our dirty little war." In the title song, 
Springsteen voices a fear that underlies the entire album: "It's easy 
for two people to lose each other in/This tunnel of love."<br>
But these are not "Baby, you done me wrong" songs. They're not about the
 outside forces that threaten relationships but about the internal 
demons that keep people uncertain of love, skeptical that they can ever 
truly touch another human being. It is an album about loneliness and 
solitude in the midst of what promised to be bliss. A pivotal moment 
comes halfway through "Brilliant Disguise," when the singer stops 
questioning his lover and turns upon himself: "I wanna know if it's you I
 don't trust/'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself." More than any 
record since his first, it is an album in which you can hear 
Springsteen's Catholic upbringing: again and again lovers pray for 
deliverance, romance is depicted as a manifestation of God's grace, and 
love brings with it doubt and guilt.<br>
Of course, the religious images and the frequent references to weddings 
will tempt those who want to think these songs tell us about 
Springsteen's own recent marriage. But to read Tunnel of Love as a 
report from the marital front is far too facile and ignores the fact 
that Springsteen was telling similar stories as far back as Darkness on 
the Edge of Town, in 1978. Since then, he has written about the promises
 our country makes to its people and the way it reneges on those 
promises, about the dreams our land inspires and the things that stifle 
those dreams and about the glory in simply persevering. On Tunnel of 
Love, Springsteen is writing about the promises people make to each 
other and the way they renege on those promises, about the romantic 
dreams we're brought up with and the internal demons that stifle those 
dreams. The battleground has moved from the streets to the sheets, but 
the battle hasn't changed significantly.<br>
And in "Valentine's Day," the last song on the record, Springsteen 
quietly reaffirms the glory of persevering. In the song, the singer 
drives a long, lonely highway and thinks about his girl, terrified of 
losing her and grappling with all the uncertainty that's surfaced 
throughout the album. Finally, he shrugs aside the doubts and makes a 
final plea: "So hold me close honey say you're forever mine/And tell me 
you'll be my lonely valentine." It's a partial return to the touching 
naiveté of the album's first three songs, but at this point it sounds 
like deliberate, hard-earned naiveté.<br>
More than any other song, however, it is "Walk Like a Man" — the track 
that ends side one — that has the feel of outright autobiography. Yet 
another song about his father — sung from the vantage point of the son's
 wedding day — it moves to as lovely an arrangement as Springsteen has 
ever crafted: a steady drumbeat with distant echoes of "Racing in the 
Street," a gentle wash of synthesizer, a lulling melody. Every incident 
rings true, and every line seems open, genuine and artless ("So much has
 happened to me/That I don't understand"). It is perhaps the most 
compassionate and affecting song Springsteen has written to his father, 
but at its center is a devastating question that reverberates through 
the entire album:<br>
I remember ma draggin' me and my sister up the street to the 
church Whenever she heard those wedding bells Well would they ever look 
so happy again The handsome groom and his bride As they stepped into 
that long black limousine For their mystery ride?<br>
There's the heart of the album: an uncertain journey down a dangerous, 
dark highway. The album doesn't make it sound like an easy trip — but 
then, it's been a long time since Bruce Springsteen has written about 
free rides of any sort. One of the wonders of Tunnel of Love is that in 
the end, he convinces us that the mystery ride just might be worth the 
toll.<br>

Live 1975-1985<br>
<br>
By<br>
 DAVID FRICKE<br>
November 10, 1986</strong><br>
<br>
It's not enough. By anyone else's standards, of course, Bruce 
Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band Live/1975-85 is an embarrassment of 
riches — five albums and ten years' worth of barroom, hockey-arena and 
baseball-stadium dynamite; greatest hits, ace covers, love songs, work 
songs, out-of-work songs — the ultimate rock-concert experience of the 
past decade finally packaged for living-room consumption, a special gift
 of thanks to the fans who shared those 1001 nights of stomp &amp; sweat
 and the best possible consolation prize for the poor bastards who could
 never get tickets.<br>
Still, Bruce Springsteen could have filled another five-record set with 
what's missing from this one. Particularly conspicuous in their absence 
are still-unreleased gems like "The Fever" and "Rendezvous," as well as 
vintage show stoppers like "Jungleland" and "Kitty's Back," a song that 
used to inspire lengthy E Street flights of hot jazz fancy in its 
mid-Seventies heyday. It is also a little disappointing that Springsteen
 has not included any recordings from the blazing five-alarm shows of 
1973 and '74 that led the critic Jon Landau, later his manager, to write
 the infamous, ultimately prophetic line: "I saw rock &amp; roll's 
future and its name is Bruce Springsteen." Instead, this boxed set 
starts in 1975 with the Born to Run tour, when the "future" had already 
arrived on wings of rueful media hype.<br>
Regrettably, Live/1975-85 has been dropped in our laps with the same 
attendant hysteria. But minor caveats about content aside, it's going to
 take more than cheap overkill, like all-Bruce radio and USA Today's 
ludicrous Elvisversus-Bruce readers poll, to eclipse the sheer physical 
wallop of Live/1975-85 and the spectral wonder of its forty songs, not 
to mention the incomparable charisma of the singer. If nothing else, 
this set is an extraordinary demonstration of how Springsteen's 
telepathic command of a concert audience has increased in direct 
proportion to the size of his stage. In his rousing cover of Eddie 
Floyd's 1967 Stax hit "Raise Your Hand," an encore recorded at the Roxy,
 in Los Angeles, in 1978, Springsteen doesn't just ask for a show of 
hands — he demands it. "You think this is a free ride?" he bellows 
before giving the crowd one last blast. "You want to play, you got to 
pay!" Six years later, in a big New Jersey arena, he strips "No 
Surrender" to its naked, valiant core, backed by just guitar, harmonica 
and the massed hush of twenty thousand people holding their breath.<br>
Loosely chronological in structure, this set also charts the evolution 
of Springsteen's lyric themes from early Great Escape anthems ("Growin' 
Up," "Thunder Road") to the macrocosmic resonance of Born in the U.S.A.,
 with its gritty telegraphic novellas of average Joes and Josephines up 
against a wall of irrevocable economic change and eroding social values.
 At the same time, this Bruceograph-style overview plots his 
corresponding progression from fanciful, often mischievous overarranging
 — the revved-up boardwalk baroque of "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" — to
 the knuckle-sandwich sound of "Cover Me" and the previously unreleased 
"Seeds." By the time he took the big leap into outdoor stadiums in 1985,
 documented with heady 3-D frenzy on sides seven through ten, 
Springsteen was having no trouble zapping fans half a mile away with his
 short-story rock &amp; soul.<br>
To be sure, the '78 Roxy version of "Spirit in the Night," the most 
enduring of Springsteen's florid love-and-wheels narratives, is 
certainly a cracker, distinguished by Max Weinberg's dropkick drumming 
and Clarence Clemons's lusty foghorn sax. Yet "Racing in the Street," 
Springsteen's grim Darkness portrait of a generation racing to a dead 
end, draws its power from a deeper well, palpably accelerating with 
pensive desperation as Danny Federici's sorrowful organ clouds over Roy 
Bittan's ballerina piano figure. And any idiot who still believes "Born 
in the U.S.A." is all stars and stripes will definitely get baked by the
 fiery rage and sense of utter betrayal at its core, vividly illustrated
 by Springsteen's rockets'-red-glare guitar solo and the atomic E Street
 crescendo that detonates the theme's climactic reprise.<br>
In some instances, it's the little details and subtle flourishes on 
Live/1975-85 that bring Springsteen's vision to life. He practically 
scrapes the pit of his desire with a gravelly, almost laryngitic vocal 
on the '75 Roxy version of "Thunder Road" ("Roy Orbison singing for the 
lonely/Hey that's me and I want you only"), accompanied only by piano 
and the delicate tingle of Federici's glockenspiel. His solo rendition 
of Woody Guthrie's "This Land Is Your Land," taken at a slower, more 
thoughtful pace, amplifies not only Guthrie's fierce democratic pride 
but also the song's unspoken promise of a brighter future ("And a voice 
was sounding/As the fog was lifting/Saying this land was made for you 
and me"). And although it doesn't have any words, the quickie 
instrumental "Paradise by the 'C,'" with its R&amp;B bluster and 
frat-rock sass, speaks volumes about Springsteen's pre-glory days in 
North Jersey seaside clubs. It doesn't take much to imagine the crowd at
 the old Upstage in Asbury Park tanking up to this one.<br>
Two of the album's finest moments aren't even musical. Springsteen's 
opening rap to "The River," delivered over a twelve-string guitar 
reverie by Nils Lofgren, is a poignant ramble about his father — the 
tensions, the petty disagreements and, ultimately, the reconciliation. 
With "War," however, Springsteen gets right to the point, dedicating it 
to the post-Vietnam kids in the crowd ("The next time they're gonna be 
lookin' at you") before leading the E Street Band into an explosive 
reading of the 1970 Edwin Starr hit with his best tonsil-ripping yell 
and plenty of spitfire guitar.<br>
All this and — finally! — "Because the Night" and "Fire," too. 
Live/1975-85 could have done with a few less Born in the U.S.A. numbers —
 eight of the album's twelve songs are reprised here — and maybe a few 
more covers, particularly Springsteen's highly personalized renditions 
of the Animals' "We Gotta Get Out of This Place" and Bob Dylan's "I Want
 You." But it seems churlish to carp about titles when there is so much 
raw power, lyric honesty and spiritual determination packed into this 
box. For best results, just pretend you're at the foot of the stage. 
Then, as Springsteen instructs in "Spirit in the Night," "stand up and 
let it shoot right through you."<br>

Bruce Springsteen<br>
Born in the U.S.A.<br>
Columbia<br>
By<br>
 DEBBY MILLER<br>
July 19, 1984</strong><br>
<br>
Though it looks at hard times, at little people in little towns choosing
 between going away and getting left behind, Born in the U.S.A, Bruce 
Springsteen's seventh album, has a rowdy, indomitable spirit. Two guys 
pull into a hick town begging for work in "Darlington County," but 
Springsteen is whooping with sha-la-las in the chorus. He may shove his 
broody characters out the door and send them cruising down the turnpike,
 but he gives them music they can pound on the dashboard to.<br>
He's set songs as well drawn as those on his bleak acoustic album, 
Nebraska, to music that incorporates new electronic textures while 
keeping as its heart all of the American rock &amp; roll from the early 
Sixties. Like the guys in the songs, the music was born in the U.S.A.: 
Springsteen ignored the British Invasion and embraced instead the legacy
 of Phil Spector's releases, the sort of soul that was coming from 
Atlantic Records and especially the garage bands that had anomalous 
radio hits. He's always chased the utopian feeling of that music, and 
here he catches it with a sophisticated production and a subtle change 
in surroundings — the E Street Band cools it with the saxophone solos 
and piano arpeggios — from song to song.<br>
The people who hang out in the new songs dread getting stuck in the 
small towns they grew up in almost as much as they worry that the big 
world outside holds no possibilities — a familiar theme in Springsteen's
 work. But they wind up back at home, where you can practically see the 
roaches scurrying around the empty Twinkie packages in the linoleum 
kitchen. In the first line of the first song, Springsteen croaks, "Born 
down in a dead man's town, the first kick I took was when I hit the 
ground." His characters are born with their broken hearts, and the only 
thing that keeps them going is imagining that, as another line in 
another song goes, "There's something happening somewhere."<br>
Though the characters are dying of longing for some sort of payoff from 
the American dream, Springsteen's exuberant voice and the swell of the 
music clues you that they haven't given up. In "No Surrender," a song 
that has the uplifting sweep of his early anthem "Thunder Road," he 
sings, "We made a promise we swore we'd always remember" no retreat, no 
surrender." His music usually carries a motto like that. He writes a 
heartbreaking message called "Bobby Jean," apparently to his longtime 
guitarist Miami Steve Van Zandt, who's just left his band — "Maybe 
you'll be out there on that road somewhere . . . in some motel room 
there'll be a radio playing and you'll hear me sing this son/Well, if 
you do, you'll know I'm thinking of you and all the miles in between" — 
but he gives the song a wall of sound with a soaring saxophone solo. 
That's classic Springsteen: the lyrics may put a lump in your throat, 
but the music says, Walk tall or don't walk at all.<br>
A great dancer himself, Springsteen puts an infectious beat under his songs.<br>
The album finds its center in those cheering rock songs, but four tracks
 - the last two on either side — give the album an extraordinary depth. 
Springsteen has always been able to tell a story better than he can 
write a hook, and these lyrics are way beyond anything anybody else is 
writing. They're sung in such an unaffected way that the starkness stabs
 you. In "My Hometown," the singer, remembers sitting on his father's 
lap and steering the family Buick as they drove proudly through town; 
but the boy grows up, and the final scene has him putting his own son on
 his lap for a last drive down a street that's become a row of vacant 
buildings. "Take a good look around," he tells his boy, repeating what 
his father told him, "this is your hometown."<br>
The tight-lipped character who sings "I'm On Fire" practically whispers 
about the desire that's eating him up. "Sometimes it's like someone took
 a knife, baby, edgy and dull, and cut a six-inch valley through the 
middle of my skull," he rasps. The way the band's turned down to just a 
light rattle of drums, faint organ and quiet, staccato guitar notes 
makes his lust seem ominous: you picture some pock-marked Harry Dean 
Stanton type, lying, too wired to sleep, in a motel room.<br>
That you get such a vivid sense of these characters is because 
Springsteen gives them voices a playwright would be proud of. In 
"Working on the Highway,: all he says is "One day I looked straight at 
her and she looked straight back" to let us know the guy's in love. And 
in the saddest song he's ever written, "Downbound Train," a man who's 
lost everything pours his story, while, behind him, long, sorry notes on
 a synthesizer sound just like heartache. "I had a job, I had a girl," 
he begins, then explains how everything's changed: "Now I work down at 
the car wash, where all it ever does its rain." It's a line Sam Shepard 
could've written: so pathetic and so funny, you don't know how to react.<br>
The biggest departure from any familiar Springsteen sound is the 
breathtaking first single, "Dancing in the Dark," with its modern 
synths, played by E Street keyboardist Roy Bittan, and thundering bass 
and drums. The kid who dances in the darkness here is practically 
choking on the self-consciousness of being sixteen. "I check my look in 
the mirror/I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face," he sings. "Man,
 I ain't getting nowhere just living in a dump like this." He turns out 
the lights not to set some drippy romantic mood but to escape in the 
fantasy of the music on the radio. In the dark, he finds a release from 
all the limitations he was born into. In the dark, like all the guys 
trapped in Springsteen's songs, he's just a spirit in the night.<br>

Nebraska<br>
Columbia<br>
<br>
By<br>
 STEVE POND<br>
October 28, 1982</strong><br>
<br>
After ten years of forging his own brand of fiery, expansive rock &amp; 
roll, Bruce Springsteen has decided that some stories are best told by 
one man, one guitar. Flying in the face of a sagging record industry 
with an intensely personal project that could easily alienate radio, 
rock's gutsiest mainstream performer has dramatically reclaimed his 
right to make the records he wants to make, and damn the consequences. 
This is the bravest of Springsteen's six records; it's also his most 
startling, direct and chilling. And if it's a risky move commercially, 
Nebraska is also a tactical masterstroke, an inspired way out of the 
high-stakes rock &amp; roll game that requires each new record to be 
bigger and grander than the last.<br>
Until now, it looked as if 1973's dizzying The Wild, the Innocent &amp; 
the E Street Shuffle would be the last Springsteen album to surprise 
people. Ensuing records simply refined, expanded and deepened his 
artistry. But Nebraska comes as a shock, a violent, acid-etched portrait
 of a wounded America that fuels its machinery by consuming its people's
 dreams. It is a portrait painted with old tools: a few acoustic 
guitars, a four-track cassette deck, a vocabulary derived from the 
plain-spoken folk music of Woody Guthrie and the dark hillbilly laments 
of Hank Williams. The style is steadfastly, defiantly out-of-date, the 
singing flat and honest, the music stark, deliberate and unadorned.<br>
Nebraska is an acoustic triumph, a basic folk album on which Springsteen
 has stripped his art down to the core. It's as harrowing as Darkness on
 the Edge of Town, but more measured. Every small touch speaks volumes: 
the delicacy of the acoustic guitars, the blurred sting of the electric 
guitars, the spare, grim images. He's now telling simple stories in the 
language of a deferential common man, peppering his sentences with 
"sir's." "My name is Joe Roberts," he sings. "I work for the state."<br>
As The River closed, Springsteen found himself haunted by a highway 
death. On Nebraska, violent death is his starting point. The title track
 is an audacious, scary beginning. Singing in a voice borrowed from 
Guthrie and early Bob Dylan, he takes the part of mass murderer Charlie 
Starkweather to quietly sing, "I can't say that I'm sorry for the things
 that we done/At least for a little while, sir, me and her we had us 
some fun." The music is gentle and soothing, but this is no romanticized
 outlaw tale à la Guthrie's "Pretty Boy Floyd." The casual 
coldbloodedness, the singer's willingness to undertake the role and the 
music's pastoral calm make Starkweather all the more horrific.<br>
Springsteen follows with another tale of real-life murder, this one 
involving mob wars in Atlantic City. With "Nebraska" and "Atlantic 
City," his landscape has taken on new, broader boundaries, and when he 
begins "Mansion on the Hill" with a reference to "the edge of town," 
it's clear that his usual New Jersey turf has opened its borders to 
include Nebraska and Wyoming and forty-seven other states. Crowds on the
 final leg of his last tour saw hints that Springsteen was heading 
toward this territory when he talked of Allan Nevins and Henry Steele 
Commager's history of the United States and Joe Klein's Woody Guthrie: a
 Life, and when he sang the songs of Guthrie, John Fogerty and Elvis 
Presley, all uniquely American stories.<br>
The keynote lines on Nebraska — "Deliver me from nowhere" and "I got 
debts that no honest man can pay" — each surface in two songs. The 
former ends both "State Trooper" and "Open All Night," while the latter 
turns up in "Atlantic City" and "Johnny 99." The album's honest men — 
and they outnumber its criminals, though side one's string of 
bloodletters suggests otherwise — are all paying debts and looking for 
deliverance that never comes. The compassion with which Springsteen 
sings every line can't hide the fact that there's no peace to be found 
in the darkness, no cleansing river running through town.<br>
As on The River, the most outwardly optimistic songs on the new album 
are sung by a man who knows full well that his dreams of easy 
deliverance are empty. In "Used Cars," the singer watches his father buy
 another clunker and makes a vow as heartfelt as it is heartbreakingly 
hollow: "Mister, the day the lottery I win/I ain't ever gonna ride in no
 used car again." And the LP's one seeming refuge turns out to be 
illusion: in "My Father's House," a devastating capper to Springsteen's 
cycle of "father" songs, the house is a sanctuary only in the singer's 
dreams. When he awakens, he finds that his father is gone, that the 
house sits at the end of a highway "where our sins lie unatoned." By 
this point, the convicted murderer of "Johnny 99" is one of the few 
characters who's seemingly figured out how to retain his dignity. He 
asks to be executed.<br>
If this record is as deep and unsettling as anything Springsteen has 
recorded, it is also his narrowest and most single-minded work. He is 
not extending or advancing his own style so much as he is temporarily 
adopting a style codified by others. But in that decision are multiple 
strengths: Springsteen's clear, sharp focus, his insistence on painting 
small details so clearly and his determination to make a folk album 
firmly in the tradition. "My Father's House" may be the only cut on side
 two that can stand up to the string of songs that open the record, but 
inconsistency is perhaps inevitable after that astonishing initial 
stretch: the title track; "Altantic City"; and "Highway Patrolman," an 
indelible tale of the ties that bind and the toll familial love exacts, 
with one of Springsteen's most delicious, delirious reveries — "Me and 
Frankie laughin' and drinkin'/Nothing feels better than blood on 
blood/Takin' turns dancin' with Maria/As the band played 'Night of the 
Johnstown Flood.'"<br>
By the end of the record, paradoxically, the choking dust that hangs 
over Springsteen's landscape makes its occasional rays of sunlight shine
 brighter. In "Atlantic City," for example, a rueful chorus makes the 
song sound nearly as triumphant as "Promised Land": "Everything dies, 
baby that's a fact/But maybe everything that dies some day comes 
back/Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty/And meet me tonight in 
Atlantic City."<br>
Finally, it comes down to that: an old dress and a meeting across from 
the casino is sometimes all it takes. "Reason to Believe" adds the final
 brush strokes, by turns blackly humorous and haunting. One man stands 
alongside a highway, poking a dead dog as if to revive it; another heads
 down to the river to wed. The bride never shows, the groom stands 
waiting, the river flows on, and people, Bruce sings with faintly 
befuddled respect, still find their reasons to believe. Naive, simple 
and telling, it is the caption beneath Bruce Springsteen's abrasive, 
clouded and ultimately glorious portrait of America.<br>

The River<br>
<br>
By<br>
 PAUL NELSON<br>
December 11, 1980</strong><br>
<br>
There's something wrong with beauty — don't you know that? If it could 
stay inside, if it didn't touch the world, why then it would be fine. 
But it makes its way into your heart and then you burn. Can you take a 
live coal into your heart and not burn.<br>
— Jonathan Valin, Final Notice<br>
Bruce Springsteen's The River is a contemporary, New Jersey version of 
The Grapes of Wrath, with the Tom Joad/Henry Fonda figure – nowadays no 
longer able to draw upon the solidarity of family – driving a stolen car
 through a neon Dust Bowl "in fear/That in this darkness I will 
disappear." Quite often, he does.<br>
Since The River is the culmination of a trilogy that began in high gear 
with Born to Run (1975) before shifting down for Darkness on the Edge of
 Town (1978), you might expect it to stand and deliver weighty 
conclusions, words to live by. Well, they're there, if you want or need 
them, and they're filled with an uncommon common sense and intelligence 
that could only have come from an exceptionally warmhearted but wary 
graduate of the street of hard knocks. Here's one example: "Now you 
can't break the ties that bind/You can't forsake the ties that bind." 
Or: "Two hearts are better than one/Two hearts girl get the job done." 
Or: "Everybody needs a place to rest/Everybody wants to have a home . . .
 /Ain't nobody like to be alone." Quoted out of context, without the 
evocative musical accompaniment of the E Street Band and Springsteen's 
unsparingly emotional singing, these lines seem incredibly simple yet 
sturdy. Not very cosmic but they'll do, I suppose, if you feel the 
necessity to nail some sort of slogan to the wall. Then you can sit back
 and stare at it and miss the whole point – not to mention the scope – 
of the album.<br>
Scope, context, sequencing and mood are everything here. Bruce 
Springsteen didn't title his summational record The River for nothing, 
so getting hit with a quick sprinkle of lyrics is no solution when 
complete immersion is called for. Each song is just a drop in the 
bucket, and the water in the bucket is drawn from a river that can take 
you on a fast but invigorating ride ("Sherry Darling," "Out in the 
Street," "Crush on You," "I'm a Rocker"), smash you in the rapids 
("Hungry Heart"), let you float dreamily downstream ("I Wanna Marry 
You") or carry you relentlessly across some unknown county line 
("Jackson Cage," "Point Blank," "Fade Away," "Stolen Car," "Ramrod," 
"The River," "Independence Day"). When the surface looks smooth, watch 
out for dangerous undercurrents. You may believe you're splashing about 
in a shallow stream and suddenly find yourself in over your head.<br>
Keeping the trilogy in mind, if Springsteen's archetypal journey from 
innocence (Born to Run) to experience (Darkness on the Edge of Town) 
taught him anything, it was that he wasn't even halfway home – that, 
contrary to what F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote, most American lives do have 
second acts. And that these postexperiential acts are usually the ones 
in which we either crack up or learn to live with our limitations and 
betrayals. In a way, Bruce Springsteen's journey started in 1973 with 
Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.'s "Growin' Up" (in which the singer 
"found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car") and 
gathered momentum that same year with his "for me, this boardwalk life's
 through" declaration in The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street 
Shuffle's "4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" before he saw himself 
finally "pulling out of here to win" in Born to Run's "Thunder Road." 
Throughout much of Darkness on the Edge of Town, Springsteen discovered 
the meaning of despair.<br>
What makes The River really special is Bruce Springsteen's epic 
exploration of the second acts of American lives. Because he realizes 
that most of our todays are the tragicomic sum of a scattered series of 
yesterdays that had once hoped to become better tomorrows, he can fuse 
past and present, desire and destiny, laughter and longing, and have 
death or glory emerge as more than just another story. By utilizing the 
vast cast of characters he's already established on the earlier LPs – 
and by putting a spin on the time span – Springsteen forces his heroes 
and heroines into seeing themselves at different and crucial periods in 
their lives. The connections are infinite (and, some would say, 
repetitious).<br>
When an artist ties these kinds of knots around several compositions, 
it's impressive. But when he also uses jump-cut juxtapositions of mood 
(the one between "I Wanna Marry You" and "The River" is particularly 
stunning) and more than a few characters in completely contrasting 
situations, it's downright brilliant. One labyrinthine example: the 
randy rocker of "Ramrod," who sings<br>
Hey, little dolly won't you say that you will<br>
Meet me tonight up on top of the hill<br>
Well just a few miles cross the county line<br>
There's a cute little chapel nestled down in the pines<br>
like he no longer believes a word of it but has to keep pushing anyway 
or he'll die, is probably the same guy who went racing in the street 
with his buddy, Sonny, and later sang, in "Darkness on the Edge of 
Town": "I lost my money and I lost my wife/Them things don't seem to 
matter much to me now/Tonight I'll be on that hill 'cause I can't 
stop...." He could easily be the reformed husband in "Drive All Night," 
too (there's an "on the edge of town" reference).<br>
Though they're separated by eight songs, "Drive All Night" is linked 
with "I Wanna Marry You" by a set of "my girl" refrains that don't 
appear on the lyric sheet. Yet the shy, naive narrator of "I Wanna Marry
 You" (who sweetly and secretly yearns for someone's estranged wife, 
whom he watches on the street every day) clearly isn't the fortunate 
protagonist of "Drive All Night." That man wins his wife back. As the 
reunited couple get ready for bed, they hear a crowd of kids partying in
 the street. "Fallen angels" and "calling strangers," the husband says. 
"Let them go... do their dances of the dead/ ... There's machines and 
there's fire waiting on the edge of town/They're out there for hire but 
baby they can't hurt us now." What he's saying, I'm sure, is that those 
kids are who we were, but we've survived and this is who we are. (Check 
Darkness on the Edge of Town's "Racing in the Street" and "Streets of 
Fire" for the "angels" - "strangers" - "fire" imagery, and Born to Run's
 title track for "suicide machines.")<br>
Immediately following the fantasy of "I Wanna Marry You" (whose main 
character gently debunks the "fairytale" of "true love" while, in fact, 
daydreaming about achieving it with a total stranger) is the grim 
reality of "The River," one of the record's two Dreiserian American 
tragedies and the second chapter of "Racing in the Street." In "The 
River," there are no idle thoughts about how nice true love might be. 
Instead, fate and the new Depression shoot the working-class hero and 
his high-school sweetheart (Mary from "Thunder Road"?) straight between 
the eyes:<br>
Then I got Mary pregnant<br>
And, man, that was all she wrote<br>
And for my 19th birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat...<br>
I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company<br>
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy<br>
Now all them things that seemed so important<br>
Well, mister they vanished right into the air<br>
Now I just act like I don't remember<br>
Mary acts like she don't care.<br>
But, of course, he does remember the good times, and it's killing him: 
"Now those memories come back to haunt me/ They haunt me like a curse/Is
 a dream a lie if it don't come true/ Or is it something worse...."<br>
After "Drive All Night," the singer witnesses – or imagines he witnesses
 ("there was nobody there but me") – the results of a bloody car crash 
in which a young man has been either badly hurt or killed. Since he 
feels personally involved, it frightens him. "Wreck on the Highway" is 
The River's last song, and this is the album's hard-won, semi-happy 
ending:<br>
Sometimes I sit up in the darkness<br>
And I watch my baby as she sleeps<br>
Then I climb in bed and I hold her tight<br>
I just lay there awake in the middle of the night<br>
Thinking 'bout the wreck on the highway.<br>
Obviously, there are other ways to ford The River and its twenty tunes 
(e.g., picking out the imagery picked up in John Ford movies would 
help), but any approach you take is liable to lead in circles. Cars, 
work and love need the gasoline of the heart to avoid smashing. 
"Independence Day " – more Dreiser – is both a beginning and an end: one
 of the greatest ever. As is a scary little noir named "Stolen Car" 
that's wound so tight it practically twitches ("I'm driving a stolen 
car/Down on Elridge Avenue/Each night I wait to get caught/But I never 
do").<br>
Musically, The River floats more influences than I'd have thought 
possible: folk balladry, soul singing and R&amp;B, rockabilly, country 
music, goofy – or not-so-goofy – teen anthems about cars and death (the 
terrific "Cadillac Ranch"), Gary "U.S." Bonds, Byrds-like folk-rock with
 ringing twelve-string guitars, party numbers, lots of rock &amp; roll, 
David Johansen and the New York Dolls ("Crush on You"), Jackson Browne 
(lyrically, the first half of "The Price You Pay" sounds like a downbeat
 rewrite of "Before the Deluge"), Elvis Costello (the vocal in "Fade 
Away") – the list could go on and on.<br>
Throughout much of the LP, producers Bruce Springsteen, Jon Landau and 
Steve Van Zandt lean toward a live sound, meeting the songs head-on, 
like the aural equivalent of, say, action-movie director Howard Hawks' 
camera placement. As a result, though it can't be compared with a 
Springsteen concert, The River seems livelier and more loose than 
Darkness on the Edge of Town. Of the trilogy, I still prefer the 
innocent zest and relative openness of Born to Run, however.<br>
While most of The River runs wide and deep, there are a few problems. 
Ever since he started conceptualizing and thinking in terms of 
trilogies, Springsteen has lost some of his naturalness and seemed more 
than a bit self-conscious about being an artist. At times, you think 
he's closed off his casualness altogether, that he can't bear the idea 
of playing around with a phrase when he could be underlining it instead.
 Will we never hear the spring and summer of "Wild Billy's Circus 
Story," "4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)," "Thunder Road" and "Born to 
Run" again? Must even the brightest days now be touched by autumnal 
tones and winter light? Bruce Springsteen isn't an old man yet. Isn't it
 odd that he's trying so hard to adopt the visions of one?<br>
From the stark, homemade look of their predominantly black-and-white 
packaging to their gritty, straightforward, 
to-hell-with-the-state-of-the-art sound, the Clash's London Calling and 
Bruce Springsteen's The River are passionately political: i.e., deeply, 
often desperately concerned with how working-class men and women are 
getting along in times as troubled as ours. Both Springsteen and the 
Clash are morally and historically committed to the directness and 
honesty of rock &amp; roll – and to what this music can mean to those 
whose hearts are smoldering with anger or shame. In their Apocalypse Now
 manner, the Clash come right out with it, though they're not incapable 
of dreaming about "Spanish songs in Andalucia/The shooting sites in the 
days of '39" or recording a tune called "Brand New Cadillac." Next to 
Bruce Springsteen, however, they sometimes seem very innocent: they 
still believe in total victory.<br>
Springsteen doesn't. His protagonists – all veterans of their own 
foreign wars – may hope for the big win, but they've been through the 
mill (or factory) enough times to realize that even the smallest success
 can be tremendously shaky. While lines like<br>
Once I spent my time playing tough guy scenes<br>
But I was living in a world of childish dreams<br>
Someday these childish dreams must end<br>
To become a man and grow up to dream again<br>
Now I believe in the end<br>
ring true, such sentiments are usually surrounded by an aura of 
omnipotent dread that makes them sound more like reveries from the past 
or wishful thinking than statements about the future. There's nothing 
apocalyptic or innocent about The River. Try listening to it right after
 Born to Run and you'll understand what I mean.<br>
Though I consider The River a rock &amp; roll milestone, in a way I hope it's also Independence Day.<br>

Darkness On The Edge of Town<br>
Columbia<br>
<br>
By<br>
 DAVE MARSH<br>
July 27, 1978<br>
</strong><br>
Occasionally, a record appears that changes fundamentally the way we 
hear rock &amp; roll, the way it's recorded, the way it's played. Such 
records — Jimi Hendrix' Are You Experienced, Bob Dylan's "Like a Rolling
 Stone," Van Morrison's Astral Weeks, Who's Next, The Band — force 
response, both from the musical community and the audience. To me, these
 are the records justifiably called classics, and I have no doubt that 
Bruce Springsteen's Darkness on the Edge of Town will someday fit as 
naturally within that list as the Rolling Stones' "(I Can't Get No) 
Satisfaction" or Sly and the Family Stone's "Dance to the Music."<br>
One ought to be wary of making such claims, but in this case, they're 
justified at every level. In the area of production, Darkness on the 
Edge of Town is nothing less than a breakthrough. Springsteen — with 
coproducer Jon Landau, engineer Jimmy Iovine and Charles Plotkin, who 
helped Iovine mix the LP — is the first artist to fuse the spacious 
clarity of Los Angeles record making and the raw density of English 
productions. That's the major reason why the result is so different from
 Born to Run's Phil Spector wall of sound. On the earlier album, for 
instance, the individual instruments were deliberately obscured to 
create the sense of one huge instrument. Here, the same power is 
achieved more naturally. Most obviously, Max Weinberg's drumming has 
enormous size, a heartbeat with the same kind of space it occupies 
onstage (the only other place I've heard a bass drum sound this big).<br>
Now that it can be heard, the E Street Band is clearly one of the finest
 rock &amp; roll groups ever assembled. Weinberg, bassist Garry Tallent 
and guitarist Steve Van Zandt are a perfect rhythm section, capable of 
both power and groove. Pianist Roy Bittan is as virtuosic as on Born to 
Run, and saxophonist Clarence Clemons, though he has fewer solos, evokes
 more than ever the spirit of King Curtis. But the revelation is 
organist Danny Federici, who barely appeared on the last L.P. Federici's
 style is utterly singular, focusing on wailing, trebly chords that sing
 (and in the marvelous solo at the end of "Racing in the Street," truly 
cry).<br>
Yet the dominant instrumental focus of Darkness on the Edge of Town is 
Bruce Springsteen's guitar. Like his songwriting and singing, 
Springsteen's guitar playing gains much of its distinctiveness through 
pastiche. There are echoes of a dozen influences — Duane Eddy, Jimmy 
Page, Jeff Beck, Jimi Hendrix, Roy Buchanan, even Ennio Morricone's 
Sergio Leone soundtracks — but the synthesis is completely Springsteen's
 own. Sometimes Springsteen quotes a famous solo — Robbie Robertson's 
from the live version of "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues" at the end of 
"Something in the Night," Jeff Beck's from "Heart Full of Soul" in the 
bridge of "Candy's Room" — and then shatters it into another dimension. 
In the end the most impressive guitar work of all is just his own: "Adam
 Raised a Cain" and "Streets of Fire" are things no one's ever heard 
before.<br>
Much the same can be said about Springsteen's singing. Certainly, Van 
Morrison and Bob Dylan are the inspirations for taking such extreme 
chances: bending and twisting syllables; making two key lines on 
"Streets of Fire" a wordless, throttled scream; the wailing and humming 
that precede and follow some of the record's most important lyrics. But 
more than ever, Springsteen's voice is personal, intimate and revealing,
 bigger and less elusive. It's the possibility hinted at on Born to 
Run's "Backstreets" and in the postverbal wail at the end of 
"Jungleland," In fact, Springsteen picks up that moan at the beginning 
of "Something in the Night," on which he turns in the new album's most 
adventurous vocal.<br>
<br>
Springsteen also realizes the terrible price one pays for living at 
half-speed. In "Racing in the Street," the album's most beautiful 
ballad, Springsteen separates humanity into two classes: "Some guys they
 just give up living/And start dying little by little, piece by 
piece/Some guys come home from work and wash up/And go racin' in the 
street." But there's nothing smug about it, because Springsteen knows 
that the line separating the living dead from the walking wounded is a 
fine and bitter one. In the song's final verse, he describes with 
genuine love a person of the first sort, someone whose eyes "hate for 
just being born." In "Factory," he depicts the most numbing sort of life
 with a compassion that's nearly religious. And in "Adam Raised a Cain,"
 the son who rejected his father's world comes to understand their 
relationship as "the dark heart of a dream" — a dream become 
nightmarish, but a vision of something better nonetheless.<br>
There are those who will say that "Adam Raised a Cain" is full of hate, 
but I don't believe it. The only hate I hear on this LP is embodied in a
 single song, "Streets of Fire," where Springsteen describes how it 
feels to be trapped by lies. And even here, he has the maturity to hate 
the lie, not the liar.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen has a tendency to inspire messianic regard in his fans — including this one. <br>
.<br>
But Born to Run was not that music. It sounded instead like the end of 
an era, the climax of the first twenty years of this grand tradition, 
the apex of our collective adolescence. Darkness on the Edge of Town 
does not. It feels like the threshold of a new period in which we'll 
again have "lives on the line where dreams are found and lost." It poses
 once more the question that rock &amp; roll's epiphanic moments always 
raise: Do you believe in magic?<br>
And once again, the answer is yes. Absolutely.<br>

 GREIL MARCUS<br>
October 9, 1975</strong><br>
<br>
As a determinedly permanent resident of the West Coast, the furor Bruce 
Springsteen's live performances have kicked up in the East over the last
 couple of years left me feeling somewhat culturally deprived, not to 
mention a little suspicious. The legendary three-hour sets Springsteen 
and his E Street Band apparently rip out night after night in New York, 
Province-town, Boston and even Austin have generated a great tumult and 
shouting; but, short of flying 3000 miles to catch a show, there was no 
way for an outlander to discover what the fuss was all about.<br>
Certainly, I couldn't find the reasons on Springsteen's first two 
albums, despite Columbia's "New Dylan" promotional campaign for the 
debut disc and the equally thoughtful "Street Poet" cover of the second.
 Both radiated self-consciousness, whereas the ballyhoo led one to hope 
for the grand egotism of historic rock &amp; roll stars; both seemed at 
once flat and more than a little hysterical, full of sound and fury, and
 signifying, if not nothing, not much.<br>
A bit guiltily, I found anything by Roxy Music far more satisfying. They
 could at least hit what they aimed for; while it was clear Springsteen 
was after bigger game, the records made me wonder if he knew what it 
was. Whether he did or not, with two "you gotta see him live" albums 
behind him, the question of whether Springsteen would ever make his mark
 on rock &amp; roll — or hang onto the chance to do so — rested on that 
third LP, which was somehow "long awaited" before the ink was dry on the
 second. Very soon, he would have to come across, put up or shut up. It 
is the rock &amp; roller's great shoot-out with himself: The kid with 
promise hits the dirt and the hero turns slowly, blows the smoke from 
his pistol, and goes on his way.<br>
Or else, the kid and the hero go down together, twitching in the dust 
while the onlookers turn their heads and talk safely of what might have 
been. The end. Fade-out.<br>
Springsteen's answer is Born to Run. It is a magnificent album that pays
 off on every bet ever placed on him — a '57 Chevy running on melted 
down Crystals records that shuts down every claim that has been made. 
And it should crack his future wide open.<br>
The song titles by themselves — "Thunder Road," "Night," "Backstreets," 
"Born to Run," "Jungleland" — suggest the extraordinary dramatic 
authority that is at the heart of Springsteen's new music. It is the 
drama that counts; the stories Springsteen is telling are nothing new, 
though no one has ever told them better or made them matter more. <br>
"Born to Run" is the motto that speaks for the album's tales, just as 
the guitar figure that runs through the title song — the finest 
compression of the rock &amp; roll thrill since the opening riffs of 
"Layla" — speaks for its music. But "Born to Run" is uncomfortably close
 to another talisman of the lost kids that careen across this record, a 
slogan Springsteen's motto inevitably suggests. It is an old tattoo: 
"Born to Lose." Springsteen's songs — filled with recurring images of 
people stranded, huddled, scared, crying, dying — take place in the 
space between "Born to Run" and "Born to Lose," as if to say, the only 
run worth making is the one that forces you to risk losing everything 
you have. Only by taking that risk can you hold on to the faith that you
 have something left to lose. Springsteen's heroes and heroines face 
terror and survive it, face delight and die by its hand, and then watch 
as the process is reversed, understanding finally that they are paying 
the price of romanticizing their own fear.<br>
One soft infested summer/Me and Terry became friends/Trying in vain to 
breathe/The fire we was born in.../Remember all the movies, Terry/We'd 
go see/Trying to learn to walk like the heroes/We thought we had to 
be/Well after all this time/To find we're just like all the 
rest/Stranded in the park/And forced to confess/To/Hiding on the 
backstreets/Hiding on the backstreets/Where we swore forever friends....<br>
Those are a few lines from "Backstreets," a song that begins with music 
so stately, so heartbreaking, that it might be the prelude to a rock 
&amp; roll version of The Iliad. Once the piano and organ have 
established the theme the entire band comes and plays the theme again. 
There is an overwhelming sense of recognition: No, you've never heard 
anything like this before, but you understand it instantly, because this
 music — or Springsteen crying, singing wordlessly, moaning over the 
last guitar lines of "Born to Run," or the astonishing chords that 
follow each verse of "Jungleland," or the opening of "Thunder Road" — is
 what rock &amp; roll is supposed to sound like.<br>
The songs, the best of them, are adventures in the dark, incidents of 
wasted fury. Tales of kids born to run who lose anyway, the songs can, 
as with "Backstreets," hit so hard and fast that it is almost impossible
 to sit through them without weeping. And yet the music is exhilarating.
 You may find yourself shaking your head in wonder, smiling through 
tears at the beauty of it all. I'm not talking about lyrics; they're 
buried, as they should be, hard to hear for the first dozen playings or 
so, coming out in bits and pieces. To hear Springsteen sing the line 
"Hiding on the backstreets" is to be captured by an image; the details 
can come later. Who needed to figure out all the words to "Like a 
Rolling Stone" to understand it?<br>
It is a measure of Springsteen's ability to make his music bleed that 
"Backstreets," which is about friendship and betrayal between a boy and a
 girl, is far more deathly than "Jungleland," which is about a gang war.
 The music isn't "better," nor is the singing — but it is more 
passionate, more deathly and, necessarily, more alive. That, if 
anything, might be the key to this music: As a ride through terror, it 
resolves itself finally as a ride into delight.<br>
"Oh-o, come on, take my hand," Springsteen sings, "Riding out to case 
the promised land." And there, in a line, is Born to Run. You take what 
you find, but you never give up your demand for something better because
 you know, in your heart, that you deserve it. That contradiction is 
what keeps Springsteen's story, and the promised land's, alive. 
Springsteen took what he found and made something better himself. This 
album is it.<br>

<br>
Greetings From Asbury Park, Bruce Springsteen's uproarious debut album, 
sounded like "Subterranean Homesick Blues" played at 78, a typical 
five-minute track bursting with more words than this review. Most of it 
didn't make much sense, but that was the point. Springsteen was rhyming 
and wailing for the sheer fun of it, and his manic exuberance more than 
canceled out his debts to Dylan, Van Morrison and the Band. The Wild, 
the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle takes itself more seriously. The 
songs are longer, more ambitious and more romantic; and yet, 
wonderfully, they lose little of Greetings' rollicking rush. Having 
released two fine albums in less than a year, Springsteen is obviously a
 considerable new talent.<br>
Like Greetings, the new album is about the streets of New York and the 
tacky Jersey Shore, but the lyrics are no longer merely zany cut-ups. 
They're striking amalgams of romance and gritty realism: "And the boys 
from the casino dance with their shirts open like Latin lovers on the 
shore,/Chasin' all those silly New York virgins by the score." The 
loveliness of the first line, the punk savvy of the second, and the 
humor of the ensemble add up to Springsteen's characteristic ambivalence
 and a complex appeal reminiscent of the Shangri-Las. In the midst of a 
raucous celebration of desire, "Rosalita," he can suddenly turn around 
and sing, "Some day we'll look back on this and think we all seem 
funny."<br>
But none of this would matter if the music were humdrum — it isn't. The 
band, especially David L. Sancious on keyboards and Clarence Clemmons on
 saxes, cook with power and precision, particularly on "Rosalita" and 
"Kitty's Back," the album's outstanding rockers. They're essentially an 
R&amp;B outfit — funkybutt is Springsteen's musical pied-a-terre — but 
they can play anything thrown at them, be it jazz or Highway 61 
Revisited. Springsteen himself is an undistinguished but extremely 
versatile guitarist, which he needs to be to follow his own changes.<br>
Springsteen is growing as a writer of music as well as of words. The 
best of his new songs dart and swoop from tempo to tempo and from genre 
to genre, from hell-bent-for-leather rock to luscious schmaltz to what 
is almost recitative. There is an occasional weak spot or an awkward 
transition, but for the most part it works spectacularly, and nowhere to
 more dramatic effect than on "Incident on 57th Street," the album's 
most stunning track, a virtual mini-opera about Johnny, a "romantic 
young boy" torn between Jane and the bright knives out on the street. 
Springsteen never resolves the conflict (if he ever does his music will 
probably become less interesting). Instead he milks it for all it's 
worth, wrapping up all the song's movements and juxtapositions with his 
unabashedly melodramatic and loonily sotted Sloppy Joe voice.<br>

Remember P.F. Sloan? Sure you do. It was back when every folk rocker 
worth his harmonica holder was flushed with Dylan fever and seeing how 
many syllables he could cram into every involuted couplet. There was 
Tandyn Almer, of "Along Comes Mary" fame ("The psychodramas and the 
traumas hung on the scars of the stars in the bars and cars — something 
like that), and David Blue had his own Highway 61 too, but absolutely 
none of 'em could beat ol' P.F. He started out writing surf songs, but 
shook the world by the throat with his masterpieces "Eve Of Destruction"
 and "Sins of a Family," and all his best material was just brimming 
with hate.<br>
Boy howdy, the first thing the world needs is a P.F. Sloan for 1973, and
 you can start revving up yer adrenaline, kids, because he's here in the
 person of Bruce Springsteen. Old Bruce makes a point of letting us know
 that he's from one of the scuzziest, most useless and plain 
uninteresting sections of Jersey. He's been influenced a lot by the 
Band, his arrangements tend to take on a Van Morrison tinge every now 
and then, and he sort of catarrh-mumbles his ditties in a disgruntled 
mushmouth sorta like Robbie Robertson on Quaaludes with Dylan barfing 
down the back of his neck. It's a tuff combination, but it's only the 
beginning.<br>
Because what makes Bruce totally unique and cosmically surfeiting is his
 words. Hot damn, what a passel o' verbiage! He's got more of them 
crammed into this album than any other record released this year, but 
it's all right because they all fit snug, it ain't like Harry Chapin 
tearing rightangle malapropisms out of his larynx. What's more, each and
 every one of 'em has at least one other one here that it rhymes with. 
Some of 'em can mean something socially or otherwise, but there's plenty
 of 'em that don't even pretend to, reveling in the joy of utter crass 
showoff talent run amuck and totally out of control:<br>
"Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage 
diplomat/In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way 
into his hat" begins the very first song, and after that things just 
keep getting more breathtakingly complicated. You might think it's some 
kinda throwback, but it's really bracing as hell because it's obvious 
that B.S. don't give a shit. He slingshoots his random rivets at you and
 you can catch as many as you want or let 'em all clatter right off the 
wall which maybe's where they belong anyway. Bruce Springsteen is a bold
 new talent with more than a mouthful to say, and one look at the pic on
 the back will tell you he's got the glam to go places in this 
Gollywoodlawn world to boot. Watch for him; he's not the new John Prine.</div>

The spiritual center of Freehold, New Jersey, might be the rug factory, 
on the edge of town. The rug company is long gone, but the factory is 
still there, a brick reminder, partly filled with small businesses. 
Freehold is really too small to have neighborhoods, but this part of 
town is called Texas, perhaps because, to Jersey ears, everyone who 
moved out of Appalachia to work in the rug factory sounded like John 
Wayne. There are two Freeholds, actually; out in Freehold township, 
where the nice suburban homes of commuters into New York butt up against
 manicured horse farms, they call Freehold borough the hole in the 
doughnut. That's not really fair; this isn't the Bronx, or East St. 
Louis. The streets around the rug factory are lined with two-family 
houses, with neat yards kept by working people who worry that their 
blue-collar jobs will head south, like the rug company, or to South 
Korea, or just evaporate. Bruce Springsteen grew up here, in a gray 
two-family house next door to a Sinclair gas station; this is his 
hometown.<br>
Not a bad place to grow up, now or twenty years ago, but not a breeding 
ground for great expectations either. In Freehold, you're expected to go
 to work instead of college, to make Scotch tape for 3M or instant 
coffee for Nescafé, and you weren't expected to make a lot of noise 
about it. Which is what Douglas Springsteen did, coming home from jobs 
as a factory worker or prison guard or bus driver to sit in his kitchen 
and think about the world. There was a living room back beyond, but it 
was for special occasions, and for company; the kitchen, the biggest 
room in the house and stolen from the set of The Honeymooners, was where
 it all happened. So you walked in, and your dad was sitting there at 
the kitchen table, reading the newspaper, growing old in a job designed 
for it. Maybe he said something, like, get a job — or at least a 
haircut. And you thought, uh-huh: the rug factory. No thanks.<br>
Suddenly it was 1964, and the Beatles hit, and everybody had a guitar. 
"Suddenly, there was a band on every street corner," says Vinnie Roslin,
 who played bass with the first hot local band, the Motifs, and later 
with Springsteen in a band called Steel Mill.<br>
The Rolling Stone Interview: Bruce Springsteen on ‘Born in the U.S.A.’<br>
"I remember the first time I saw the Beatles, on The Ed Sullivan Show," 
says George Theiss. "I got this feeling in my chest, this tightness, 
almost like I was crying." There was nothing left to do but get a guitar
 and form a band, play out your gunfighter fantasies, wear Long Rider 
coats and meet girls. So Theiss did, and that band became the Castiles, 
after the shampoo he was using. They practiced over on Center Street in 
Texas, in the half of a two-family house that their drummer, Bart 
Haynes, lived in.<br>
The Appalachian families had moved on, replaced by Italians, who were 
being replaced by blacks. It was the era of the transistor radio: 
outside of town, country &amp; western reigned, but on the streets of 
Texas you got Top Forty from the New York stations and, increasingly, 
soul — Temps, Tops, Otis and Aretha. Jangle it all together, and you've 
got rock &amp; roll, and on Center Street, the longest street in America
 because it ran from Texas to Main, it jangled. The Castiles tried to 
jangle, but. "We were awful," says George Theiss, laughing. The other 
half of the two-family house was occupied by Gordon "Tex" Vinyard, and 
he finally came over one night and asked them to knock it off. Theiss 
came by Vinyard's a couple days later to apologize; they hit it off, and
 in the end, Vinyard said, hey, if you're going to do this, let's do it 
right. And they did.<br>
Tex was in his late thirties then, a factory worker who loved kids and 
had none of his own. He became a legend to Jersey bands; eventually, he 
would manage more than twenty of them. But the first and possibly the 
best was the Castiles, and in no time he had cleared out his living room
 and turned it into a practice hall. The Castiles were going through 
personnel, and looking for a guitar player. George Theiss was going out 
with Ginny Springsteen, and somebody else mentioned that her brother, 
Bruce, played the guitar, so Theiss took him over to meet Tex. 
Springsteen came in with a borrowed guitar, played a few snatches of 
songs and wondered if he was in the band. Tex suggested he come back 
when he'd learned a few songs. Springsteen showed up the next night, 
played five songs he'd learned off the radio and asked again. An 
astounded Tex said yeah. Sure.<br>
Bruce Springsteen Album-By-Album<br>
Vinyard didn't know anything about music, but he knew what he liked, and
 he liked his opinions. "Tex liked country &amp; western," says George 
Theiss, laughing. "He couldn't tell you how you were playing the guitar 
part wrong, but he made us do it again and again until it was right." He
 sobers up and nods. "An authority figure," he says respectfully.<br>
Tex was a large man, and sometimes he would become impatient and start 
yelling, say they were acting like kids. His wife, Marion, would come in
 then, with sodas from Foodtown — they went through cases and cases of 
Foodtown soda — and say, "Tex, they are kids." The Castiles would tease 
him when he was in a good mood, and call him Flash. The black kids on 
the block were a little more raffish. They called him Bwana.<br>
There were two sides to him, and on the one side he leaned a little 
toward George Theiss — a charmer, a lady's man having a time. Theiss 
would show up ten minutes late for practice, and Tex would yell, 
"Theiss, that girl better walk herself home tomorrow." But on the other,
 he leaned toward Bruce Springsteen — shy but very, very serious, a 
believer in the power of rock &amp; roll, at least in its power to get 
you out of a two-family house in Freehold. Tex maybe didn't understand 
rock &amp; roll, but he believed in it too, and that's why he was 
replacing the shock absorbers on his old Mercury every couple of months 
after hauling a load of kids and equipment to gigs all over Jersey, or 
going into debt on a factory worker's salary to buy equipment across the
 street at Caiazzo's Music Store, getting old man Caiazzo to write out 
the music to the original songs the band wrote so they could be 
copyrighted, even paying Ray Cichone, the Motifs' guitar player, to 
teach Springsteen how to play leads. One observer's estimate is that Tex
 eventually put $10,000 into the band, in 1965 dollars, for kids who 
could never have put it together themselves, and he found somebody whose
 obsession matched his own. When you think of Springsteen as the Boss, 
remember those black kids on Center Street who called Tex Vinyard Bwana.<br>

Outside the band, at Freehold Regional High School, Bruce didn't make 
much of an impression. "No, he made no impression at all," says one 
high-school classmate. "He was very shy — no activities, no sports, 
nothing like that. If he hadn't turned out to be Bruce Springsteen, 
would I remember him? I can't think why I would." He stops, then says, 
"You have to remember, without a guitar in his hands, he had absolutely 
nothing to say." George Theiss went out with Ginny Springsteen for a 
year and didn't even know Bruce played guitar until someone else told 
him. "We were trying to be cool," Theiss says, "trying to get by without
 carrying any books at all, or carrying one, almost like a prop. You 
would see Bruce, coming down the hall with an armful of books, carrying 
them up around his chest, like a girl. I thought he was real studious."<br>
He wasn't, but he was an outsider. Freehold High divided into Greasers 
and Rah-rahs. Rah-rahs wore madras shirts and white pants, were going 
out with cheerleaders and on to college. Liked the Beatles, the Beach 
Boys, Jan and Dean. Greasers wore black jeans and white T-shirts, black 
leather jackets. They were going to work, or to Vietnam; liked the 
Stones, Motown, the Who. It was a compliment to say of a fellow greaser,
 "He wears black socks, even in gym class."<br>
The Castiles rode it down the middle, some band members leaning one way,
 some the other. Bart Haynes, the drummer, Vince Manniello, who replaced
 him, Bob Alfano, the organist, and Springsteen were the Greasers. 
George Theiss, who had moved over to rhythm guitar and handled vocals; 
Curt Fluhr, the bassist; and Paul Popkin, who played tambourines and did
 some vocals, were the Rah-rahs. But these are arbitrary groupings; the 
lines shifted all the time, and the band could shift too, depending on 
where they were playing. Still, there was a time at one Rah-rah 
stronghold in Sea Bright when the band had to go out the back door and 
toss the equipment over a barbed-wire fence, with Ray Cichone and Tex 
standing guard — too much "My Generation."<br>
100 Greatest Artists: Bruce Springsteen<br>
But there were places to play all over, school dances and CYO dances and
 YMCA dances. "I saw that 'Dancing in the Dark' video, and I started 
laughing," says Curt Fluhr. "When he did that dance in high school, he 
used to call it the boogaloo." There were clubs up and down the Jersey 
coast, in Red Bank and Long Branch and Asbury Park. There were battles 
of the bands at the Keyport - Matawan Rollerdrome — the kind of contest 
where you could hear two bands play "Satisfaction" four times each.<br>
They could play now, although nobody played his own instrument. Curt 
Fluhr was playing a Silvertone bass Tex owned. Popkin's Stratocaster was
 played by George Theiss. Springsteen played Theiss' blue solid-body 
Epiphone. They were in Tex' house five nights a week until eleven or so,
 joined by as many as twenty other kids, and out a couple times a week 
at a gig somewhere, then back to Tex' for Foodtown sodas and some of 
Marion's tuna-fish sandwiches. There was a teen club in Freehold called 
the Left Foot, started by a Catholic priest named Father Coleman, with 
help from Tex — a juice bar, a place for kids to hang out — and the 
Castiles ruled it. Occasionally, the band went up to New York to play 
Cafe Wha? in the Village for ten dollars a man. Fluhr laughs, thinking 
about it. He remembers the night his Hofner bass was stolen offstage, 
mainly because a waitress took pity on him, gave him his first joint and
 took him upstairs to meet the Fugs. Glory days.<br>
On the haul up to the city, they would take back roads to avoid the 
tolls, Springsteen sitting quietly, thinking out songs, and then, in the
 Village, standing around with his mouth open like the rest of them. 
There was a gay man named Josie, a West Village legend, who took a 
liking to Springsteen and would sneak up on him to kiss him. The band 
would be standing around with slices of pizza in some joint on Bleecker 
Street, and they'd see Josie coming, and nobody would say a word until 
Josie had done his work and had run away, giggling. "Even then, I'd have
 to say Bruce is the most heterosexual person I ever met," says Fluhr, 
"and he'd get this look on his face that was just . . . incredible." 
Despite the loner mystique, there was always a girl, lots of them, but 
Springsteen didn't talk about that either. Back in Freehold for soda and
 tuna fish, he just quietly slipped away.<br>
Glory days. They were famous. Their hair was down in their eyes, which 
irritated the Rah-rahs, and everybody else, too. "We were the only five 
freaks in Monmouth County," says George Theiss, laughing. "And at that 
time, you had short hair, and were an American, or you didn't, and 
weren't." It made ordering a cup of coffee interesting, but when the 
principal of Freehold High called the band in and told them to get 
haircuts, a petition sprang up — you can't do this, these guys are the 
Castiles — and the order was rescinded. Glory days.<br>

They hung out in Federici's Pizza (no relation to E Street Band 
keyboardist Danny Federici), acclaimed by Freehold residents as the best
 pizza anywhere — very thin-crusted pizza, very greasy, the only pizza 
anywhere that came in a paper bag instead of a box. In the back seat of 
everyone's car was a circular slick that told you just how highly 
Federici's pizza was esteemed.<br>
The big acquisition in Freehold was a driver's license, but long after 
everybody in the band had his, Springsteen was still hitchhiking, 
incapable of learning to drive. Tex once spent an afternoon with him in 
the six-acre parking lot at Freehold Raceway, trying to teach him, and 
came back shaking his head. Every day between May and September, Bruce 
would take his guitar and hitchhike to the beach. He would get picked up
 three or four times a year by the cops for hitchhiking, but who cares 
when you're hearing songs? In September, he always had the best tan.<br>
"You could tell there was something special about him," says Curt Fluhr,
 a bit abashed. "You had this kid, terribly shy, not terribly 
attractive, but put a guitar in his hands . . ." And what? "You ever see
 Bill Bixby turn into the Incredible Hulk?" Fluhr asks. "Put him onstage
 with a guitar and he lit it up. It was like somebody had plugged him 
in."<br>
The Castiles made a demo record, paid for by Tex, in a cheap recording 
studio, but you can hear the power — the slashing leads of a hot 
seventeen-year-old guitar player and his gritty, high-in-the-throat 
voice. There was some tension in the band, and that shows up, too. "We 
weren't the Everly Brothers," says George Theiss, only a bit ruefully. 
Springsteen wanted to do fewer covers and more of his own songs, and 
when he did covers, he wanted to do harder music — the Stones and the 
Who — and he wanted to sing, too. The Castiles' vocalist was Theiss, who
 has a great voice — a Mrs. Butterworth rock &amp; roll voice, thick and
 rich — and Tex wanted George to sing.<br>
The end was coming. They had all graduated from high school, except 
Fluhr, and Springsteen's parents had moved to California. He had stayed 
behind to attend Ocean County Community College in Toms River (known as 
Hooper High because it's on Hooper Avenue) and was worried, as they all 
were, about the draft. Somewhere from those last shows, Theiss says, is a
 picture of Springsteen giving him the finger onstage. The Castiles 
played their last gig in August 1968 at the Off Broad Street Coffeehouse
 in Red Bank.<br>
They went off to do other things. Springsteen became Bruce. The 
Castiles' first drummer, Bart Haynes, joined the Marine Corps, and was 
killed in action in Vietnam. Vince Manniello knocked around for a while 
and now lives at home with his parents in Freehold, helping them run 
their antique store. Bob Alfano played in local bands, including one 
with Springsteen called Earth, and is now a milkman living in Asbury 
Park. Curt Fluhr went up to Boston University, then came back to help 
his father run the family's fuel-oil business, continuing to play. The 
fuel-oil business was sold, and Fluhr made a little money and married a 
former Miss Nashville who is also a former first soprano with the 
Atlanta Symphony. They're running a country band and thinking about 
moving south. Paul Popkin and George Theiss enrolled in RCA's 
electronics school to get deferments, and a year later Popkin was dead, 
mysteriously, from hepatitis. Theiss got married at nineteen and has 
stayed married; they have two kids and a nice house in Freehold township
 with a pool in the back yard. He works as a carpenter, but he keeps on 
playing rock &amp; roll, and this month he went into the studio to make 
his first album, with the guys who put Bonnie Tyler on track. He's still
 a believer in the power of rock &amp; roll. "You can't talk about 
things," Theiss says. "You have to do them. I just want to do the 
music."<br>
T<br>
he Friday before the Born in the U.S.A. Tour started last summer, 
Springsteen wanted to rehearse before a live audience, and so the E 
Street Band went on at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park sometime just after
 midnight on a hot night. This is Bruce country, a fading shore town 
where they know their rock &amp; roll, and four hours later, they knew 
it better. The band was sweating, exhausted, and dragging out the door 
when Springsteen began yelling at them to come back. They did, and he 
launched into "Born to Run," and when it was over, they had to carry him
 outside and drape him over the hood of a car so they could throw 
buckets of ice water over him.<br>
The Stone Pony is just about the last vestige of the once exploding 
Asbury Park music scene. The Pandemonium, the Student Prince, the 
Sunshine Inn — clubs where you heard Top Forty cover bands all summer 
long, and whatever was happening all winter — they're all gone, victims 
of Asbury Park's downslide after the riots in 1971. It was always a town
 for music — Lester Lanin's big band in the Forties, jazz and rhythm 
&amp; blues clubs on the edge of Asbury's black sections through the 
middle Sixties, rock &amp; roll after that. The list of people who 
played standing gigs in Asbury Park includes names as diverse as James 
Brown, George Benson and Eddie Arnold.<br>
But they're cleaning up the boardwalk now; at one end, the once elegant 
Berkeley Carteret hotel is being made that way again by a consortium of 
partners that includes Johnny Cash. Coming down the boardwalk, past 
Madame Marie's (palms read, fortunes told, see "Sandy," on The Wild, the
 Innocent), you wonder how long the arcades and miniature-golf courses 
can hold up in the face of gentrification. There may no longer be any 
room on Ocean Avenue for a mere rock &amp; roll club like the Stone 
Pony, and although it can resettle inland, it just wouldn't be the same.<br>
But who knows? They probably said the same thing when the Upstage 
closed. The Upstage was another teen club, a juice bar without a liquor 
license, open till five on the weekends, started by Margaret Potter and 
her then-husband, Tom, in 1968. Before that, the Potters ran a 
hairdressing salon on Cookman Avenue, Studio Six, and spent weekends in 
clubs, and when the clubs closed, musicians came back to the Potters' 
apartment for breakfast and to teach Margaret how to play guitar. It 
evolved into a hangout for musicians and might have gone on like that 
indefinitely, except that Tom Potter became allergic to hair dye. Two 
doors down on Cookman Avenue, the Potters found a lease, the second 
floor over a Thom McAn shoe store, and opened the Upstage. It turned 
into a folkie coffeehouse, and when the third floor came open, they took
 that, too. On the third floor, the back wall was covered with tiny 
speakers — the largest was fifteen inches — and it was there the 
prototypical Asbury band was born, blaring out of the wall — a big, 
flathead rhythm section, drums and bass. A saxophone, to blow response 
to the singer. Keyboards, or an electric piano, or better yet, an organ 
player on a big B-3, like Booker T. And finally, a funky chunky guitar 
player for Steve Cropper leads on Strat. After that it was what you 
could carry — harmonica, another guitar, a horn section. The Upstage 
became a drop-in, hang-out club for musicians up and down the shore. You
 paid twenty-five dollars for the year in order to duck the two-dollar 
cover, and because there was a wall full of speakers, all you had to 
bring was your guitar.<br>
Margaret Potter remembers the first night Springsteen walked in: "He 
came up very politely and said, 'Excuse me, but would you mind very much
 if I borrowed your guitar? The gentleman downstairs said it would 
probably be okay.' I said sure and stuck around awhile while he plugged 
in, to make sure he understood the system. He played some blues thing, 
and I said, 'Oh, Lord,' and went back down to the second floor. Vini 
Lopez, the first drummer in the E Street Band, was sitting down there, 
and Miami Steve, and Southside Johnny, all playing Monopoly, which is 
what you did while you waited to get up, and I told them they had better
 get upstairs. They were involved in the game, and asked why. I said, 
'Hey guys, there's some kid up there who can really play.' " Then, as 
she turned to leave: "They said, 'Where are you going?' I said, 'Where 
do you think? Upstairs.' "<br>
At the time, Springsteen was doing his power-trio thing in a band called
 Earth to get the hard edges out of his system. But that was over soon 
enough, and his first real band in Asbury Park was something called 
Child, a band that grew out of the Upstage and the hot players there. 
Soon enough, they found out there was another band called Child, and 
they were sitting around the Ink Well coffeehouse in Long Branch, 
depressed, trying to come up with another name, when an acquaintance 
came in and asked who died. They stole our name, and we're trying to 
come up with another one, was the reply. What's the band like? he asked.
 It's sort of hard, and fast, and . . . heavy. Call it Steel Mill, the 
friend said. Why? they asked. Well, they're sort of heavy, aren't they? 
So Steel Mill got a winter rental in Bradley Beach for $125 a month, 
including a snooker table, which they wore out, since nobody had any 
money to do anything else, and when they weren't playing snooker, they 
practiced.<br>
These were serious working musicians, not high-school kids, and 
Springsteen exhausted them practicing. "He just had this enormous 
appetite to play," says Vinnie Roslin, the bass player and former member
 of the Motifs. "He'd play anytime, anywhere, for anybody. He was like a
 television set with one channel, and on the set was 'practice music.'"<br>
Their manager was a man named Carl West, who ran Challenger Eastern 
Surfboards. They would surf all summer and then play all winter in the 
office of West's deserted surfboard factory. But nothing really came of 
Steel Mill either. West took the band to California to see his old 
haunts and get rich, but it didn't happen. They got incredible reviews, 
including a gig at the Fillmore West that caused a San Francisco 
Examiner writer to gush, "I have never been so overwhelmed by totally 
unknown talent." They tried to get something going with Bill Graham's 
Fillmore Records, but couldn't, and came home in March, wondering. There
 were other missteps along the way — they had a chance to play 
Woodstock, but West blew it off, believing too many people would show up
 and their equipment would be stolen or damaged. Instead, they played to
 a handful of people in the Student Prince in Asbury Park. Soon enough, 
they split up. Some of Steel Mill ended up in the E Street Band — Vini 
Lopez, the first drummer, and keyboardist Danny Federici. "I've never 
played in a band so tight," says Roslin. "You could tell when the next 
guy was going to breathe." Springsteen, he remembers, was completely 
calm, through all the money troubles and missed opportunities, and one 
night Roslin asked why. "He just turned to me and said, 'Well. It's like
 looking up at a light at the end of the tunnel, and what can you do? 
You just keep walking. And you get there.' " Roslin shakes his head. 
He's playing bass, here and there, working a day job to keep together 
and play music at night.<br>
"You just keep walking, and that's what he did," Roslin says. "Remember, one channel."</div>

<br>
As he releases 'Human Touch' and 'Lucky Town,' Springsteen opens up on his divorce and breaking up the E Street Band<br>
<br>
by: James Henke</strong><br>
<br>
"In the crystal ball, I see romance, I see adventure, I see financial 
reward. I see those albums, man, I see them going back up the charts. I 
see them rising past that old Def Leppard, past that Kris Kross. I see 
them all the way up past 'Weird Al' Yankovic, even . . . Wait a minute. 
We're slipping. We're slipping down them charts. We're going down, down,
 out of sight, into the darkness . . ."<br>
<br>
It was June 5th, and as Bruce Springsteen was performing "Glory Days" 
near the end of a live radio broadcast from a Los Angeles sound stage, 
he finally offered his commentary on the much-publicized failure of his 
latest albums – Human Touch and Lucky Town – to dominate the charts in 
the same way that some of their predecessors had. Thankfully, 
Springsteen demonstrated that while he may have lost a little of his 
commercial clout, he hasn't lost his sense of humor.<br>
<br>
The show, in front of about 250 invited guests and radio-contest 
winners, was a "dress rehearsal" meant to introduce his new band – 
keyboardist Roy Bittan, guitarist Shane Fontayne, bassist Tommy Sims, 
drummer Zachary Alford, singer-guitarist Crystal Taliefero and vocalists
 Bobby King, Gia Ciambotti, Carol Dennis, Cleo Kennedy and Angel Rogers –
 and to stir up excitement for his summer tour of the States. He 
succeeded on both counts. The concert proved that even without the E 
Street Band, Springsteen is still a masterful performer; in fact, his 
new band rocks harder, and musically it challenges him more than his 
previous group. And he still has more than a few loyal fans: The day 
after the radio broadcast, he sold out eleven shows at New Jersey's 
Brendan Byrne Arena (more than 200,000 tickets) in just two and a half 
hours.<br>
<br>
Even so, it has been an unusually trying season for Springsteen. Though 
Human Touch and Lucky Town entered the charts at Numbers Two and Three, 
respectively, they quickly slipped and eventually dropped out of the Top
 Forty. On top of that, some segments of the media seemed to be reaping 
pleasure from Springsteen's relative lack of success (and indeed, it is 
relative: Each of the albums has sold more than 1.5 million copies). One
 magazine, Entertainment Weekly, even put Springsteen on its cover with 
the headline What Ever Happened to Bruce?<br>
<br>
But things could be worse, as Springsteen well knows. For the past 
several years, he has been waging a far tougher battle – trying to 
repair what had become a badly damaged personal life. "I was real good 
at music," he says, "and real bad at everything else."<br>
<br>
Onstage, of course, Springsteen could do it all; offstage, it was a 
different story. Something of a loner by nature, he had difficulty 
maintaining any kind of long-term relationship. Even as he was preaching
 about "community" during his Born in the U.S.A. tour, he himself was 
keeping his distance from just about everyone. And when he wasn't 
working, he wasn't happy.<br>
<br>
When he hit the road in 1988 to support his Tunnel of Love album, the 
cracks in Springsteen's personal life were beginning to show. His 
marriage to actress Julianne Phillips had begun to deteriorate, and 
thanks to the tabloids, it soon became public knowledge that he was 
seeing E Street Band singer Patti Scialfa. When he got off the road in 
late 1988 after playing a series of shows for Amnesty International, 
Springsteen hit rock bottom.<br>
<br>
Gradually, he began to regain control of his life. He went into therapy.
 He got divorced from Phillips and eventually married Scialfa. He parted
 ways with the E Street Band. He left New Jersey and moved to Los 
Angeles. And with Scialfa, he fathered two children: Evan James, who's 
almost two, and Jessica Rae, who was born last New Year's Eve.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's personal trials are documented on Human Touch; his victory
 over those trials is the subject of Lucky Town. The jury is still out 
on whether his U.S. tour, which kicks off on July 23rd in New Jersey, 
will resuscitate those albums. But there's no question that Springsteen 
himself is the happiest he's been in a long time. Over the course of 
three lengthy interviews in Los Angeles and New York – the first 
in-depth interviews he's done since 1986 – he outlined in great detail 
what he calls "the biggest struggle of my life," and he addressed a 
variety of other subjects, ranging from rap music to the presidential 
race.<br>
<br>
The music scene has changed a lot since you last released an album. Where do you see yourself fitting in these days?<br>
I never kind of fit in, in a funny kind of way. In the Seventies the 
music I wrote was sort of romantic, and there was lots of innocence in 
it, and it certainly didn't feel like it was a part of that particular 
time. And in the Eighties, I was writing and singing about what I felt 
was happening to the people I was seeing around me or what direction I 
saw the country going in. And that really wasn't in step with the times,
 either.<br>
<br>
Well, given the response to your music then, I think you fit in pretty well during the Eighties.<br>
Well, we were popular, but that's not the same thing. All I try to do is
 to write music that feels meaningful to me, that has commitment and 
passion behind it. And I guess I feel that if what I'm writing about is 
real, and if there's emotion, then hey, there'll be somebody who wants 
to hear it. I don't know if it's a big audience or a smaller audience 
than I've had. But that's never been my primary interest. I've had a 
kind of story I've been telling, and I'm really only in the middle of 
it.<br>
<br>
At the same time, your new albums haven't fared as well on the charts as
 most people expected, and you've had to endure some sniping from the 
media. How do you feel about that?<br>
I try not to get involved in it. It does seem to be out there in the 
air, for everybody and anybody, but I don't take it that personally. I 
mean, if you spend any time in Los Angeles, you see that a lot: "Great, 
you're a tremendous success – now fail!"<br>
<br>
There's a media game that's played out there, and I guess it sells 
newspapers and magazines. But it's not central to who I am or what I do.
 You make your music, then you try to find whatever audience is out 
there for it.<br>
<br>
Do you think that a teenager who's into rap or heavy metal would be interested in your new albums?<br>
I don't know. And I don't know if you can generalize like that. I think 
some yes and some no. All I can do is put my music out there. I can't 
contrive something that doesn't feel honest. I don't write 
demographically. I don't write a song to reach these people or those 
people.<br>
<br>
Of course, I'm interested in having a young audience. I'm interested in 
whoever's interested in what I'm doing. And what I have to say is "This 
is how I've grown up. Maybe this will have some value. These are the 
places I've been, and these are the things I've learned."<br>
<br>
But I want to sing about who I am now. I want to get up onstage and sing
 with all of the forty-two years that are in me. When I was young, I 
always said I didn't want to end up being forty-five or fifty and 
pretending I was fifteen or sixteen or twenty. That just didn't interest
 me. I'm a lifetime musician; I'm going to be playing music forever. I 
don't foresee a time when I would not be onstage somewhere, playing a 
guitar and playing it loud, with power and passion. I look forward to 
being sixty or sixty-five and doing that.<br>
For the first time in about twenty years you're embarking on a tour 
without the E Street Band. What led to your decision to get rid of them?<br>
At the end of the Born in the U.S.A. tour and after we made the live 
album, I felt like it was the end of the first part of my journey. And 
then, for the Tunnel of Love tour, I switched the band around quite a 
bit. I switched where people had stood for fifteen years, just trying to
 give it a different twist.<br>
<br>
But you can get to a place where you start to replay the ritual, and 
nostalgia creeps in. And I decided it was time to mix it up. I just had 
to cut it loose a little bit so I could have something new to bring to 
the table. I wanted to get rid of some of the old expectations. People 
were coming to my shows expecting to hear "Born to Run" or stuff that I 
wrote fifteen or twenty years ago. And I wanted to get to a spot where 
if people came to the show, there'd be a feeling of like, well, it's not
 going to be this, it's going to be something else.<br>
<br>
Did you call each of the guys to give them the news?<br>
Oh, sure, yeah. Initially, some people were surprised, some people were 
not so surprised. I'm sure some people were angry, and other people 
weren't angry. But as time passed, everything came around to a really 
nice place. I mean, I wasn't the guy writing the check every month. 
Suddenly, I was just Bruce, and some of the friendships started coming 
forward a little bit. And it was interesting, because we hadn't had that
 kind of relationship. We had all been working together for so long that
 we didn't really have a relationship outside of the work environment.<br>
<br>
You mentioned the Born in the U.S.A. tour as marking the end of one 
phase of your career. How did the enormousness of that album and tour 
affect your life?<br>
I really enjoyed the success of Born in the U.S.A., but by the end of 
that whole thing, I just kind of felt "Bruced" out. I was like "Whoa, 
enough of that." You end up creating this sort of icon, and eventually 
it oppresses you.<br>
<br>
What specifically are you referring to?<br>
Well, for example, the whole image that had been created – and that I'm 
sure I promoted – it really always felt like "Hey, that's not me." I 
mean, the macho thing, that was just never me. It might be a little more
 of me than I think, but when I was a kid, I was a real gentle child, 
and I was more in touch with those sorts of things.<br>
<br>
It's funny, you know, what you create, but in the end, I think, the only
 thing you can do is destroy it. So when I wrote Tunnel of Love, I 
thought I had to reintroduce myself as a songwriter, in a very noniconic
 role. And it was a relief. And then I got to a place where I had to sit
 some more of that stuff down, and part of it was coming out here to 
L.A. and making some music with some different people and seeing what 
that's about and living in a different place for a while.<br>
<br>
How's it been out here, compared with New Jersey?<br>
Los Angeles provides a lot of anonymity. You're not like the big fish in
 the small pond. People wave to you and say hi, but you're pretty much 
left to go your own way. Me in New Jersey, on the other hand, was like 
Santa Claus at the North Pole [laughs].<br>
<br>
What do you mean?<br>
Hmm, how can I put it? It's like you're a bit of a figment of a lot of 
other people's imaginations. And that always takes some sorting out. But
 it's even worse when you see yourself as a figment of your own 
imagination. And in the last three or four years, that's something I've 
really freed myself from.<br>
<br>
I think what happened was that when I was young, I had this idea of 
playing out my life like it was some movie, writing the script and 
making all the pieces fit. And I really did that for a long time. But 
you can get enslaved by your own myth or your own image, for the lack of
 a better word. And it's bad enough having other people seeing you that 
way, but seeing yourself that way is really bad. It's pathetic. And I 
got to a place, when Patti and I hooked up, where I said I got to stop 
writing this story. It doesn't work.<br>
<br>
And that's when I realized I needed a change, and I like the West. I 
like the geography. Los Angeles is a funny city. Thirty minutes and 
you're in the mountains, where for 100 miles there's one store. Or 
you're in the desert, where for 500 miles there's five towns.<br>
<br>
So Patti and I came out here and put the house together and had the 
babies and . . . the thing is, I'd really missed a big part of my life. 
The only way I could describe it is that being successful in one area is
 illusory. People think because you're so good at one particular thing, 
you're good at many things. And that's almost always not the case. 
You're good at that particular thing, and the danger is that that 
particular thing allows you the indulgence to remove yourself from the 
rest of your life. And as time passed, I realized that I was using my 
job well in many ways, but there was a fashion in which I was also 
abusing it. And – this began in my early thirties – I really knew that 
something was wrong.<br>
<br>
That was about ten years ago?<br>
Yeah, it started after I got back from the River tour. I'd had more 
success than I'd ever thought I'd have. We'd played around the world. 
And I thought, like, "Wow, this is it." And I decided, "Okay, I want to 
have a house." And I started to look for a house.<br>
<br>
I looked for two years. Couldn't find one. I've probably been in every 
house in the state of New Jersey – twice. Never bought a house. Figured I
 just couldn't find one I liked. And then I realized that it ain't that I
 can't find one, I couldn't buy one. I can find one, but I can't buy 
one. Damn! Why is that?<br>
<br>
And I started to pursue why that was. Why did I only feel good on the 
road? Why were all my characters in my songs in cars? I mean, when I was
 in my early twenties, I was always sort of like "Hey, what I can put in
 this suitcase, that guitar case, that bus – that's all I need, now and 
forever." And I really believed it. And really lived it. Lived it for a 
long time.<br>
<br>
In a Rolling Stone cover story from 1978, Dave Marsh wrote that you were
 so devoted to music that it was impossible to imagine you being married
 or having kids or a house . . .<br>
A lot of people have said the same thing. But then something started 
ticking. It didn't feel right. It was depressing. It was like "This is a
 joke. I've come a long way, and there's some dark joke here at the 
end."<br>
<br>
I didn't want to be one of those guys who can write music and tell 
stories and have an effect on people's lives, and maybe on society in 
some fashion, but not be able to get into his own self. But that was 
pretty much my story.<br>
<br>
I tend to be an isolationist by nature. And it's not about money or 
where you live or how you live. It's about psychology. My dad was 
certainly the same way. You don't need a ton of dough and walls around 
your house to be isolated. I know plenty of people who are isolated with
 a six-pack of beer and a television set. But that was a big part of my 
nature.<br>
<br>
Then music came along, and I latched onto it as a way to combat that 
part of myself. It was a way that I could talk to people. It provided me
 with a means of communication, a means of placing myself in a social 
context – which I had a tendency not to want to do.<br>
<br>
And music did those things but in an abstract fashion, ultimately. It 
did them for the guy with the guitar, but the guy without the guitar was
 pretty much the same as he had been.<br>
<br>
Now I see that two of the best days of my life were the day I picked up 
the guitar and the day that I learned how to put it down. Somebody said,
 "Man, how did you play for so long?" I said: "That's the easy part. 
It's stopping that's hard."<br>
<br>
When did you learn to put the guitar down?<br>
Pretty recently. I had locked into what was pretty much a hectic 
obsession, which gave me enormous focus and energy and fire to burn, 
because it was coming out of pure fear and self-loathing and 
self-hatred. I'd get onstage and it was hard for me to stop. That's why 
my shows were so long. They weren't long because I had an idea or a plan
 that they should be that long. I couldn't stop until I felt burnt, 
period. Thoroughly burnt.<br>
<br>
It's funny, because the results of the show or the music might have been
 positive for other people, but there was an element of it that was 
abusive for me. Basically, it was my drug. And so I started to follow 
the thread of weaning myself.<br>
<br>
For a long time, I had been able to ignore it. When you're nineteen and 
you're in a truck and you're crossing the country back and forth, and 
then you're twenty-five and you're on tour with the band – that just fit
 my personality completely. That's why I was able to be good at it. But 
then I reached an age where I began to miss my real life – or to even 
know that there was another life to be lived. I mean, it was almost a 
surprise. First you think you are living it. You got a variety of 
different girlfriends, and then, "Gee, sorry, gotta go now." It was like
 the Groucho Marx routine – it's funny, 'cause it runs in my family a 
little bit, and we get into this: "Hello, I came to say I'd like to 
stay, but I really must be going." And that was me.<br>
What was it that woke you up to the fact that you were missing something or had a problem?<br>
Unhappiness. And other things, like my relationships. They always ended 
poorly; I didn't really know how to have a relationship with a woman. 
Also, I wondered how can I have this much money and not spend it? Up 
until the Eighties, I really didn't have any money. When we started the 
River tour, I had about twenty grand, I think. So, really, around 1983 
was the first time I had some money in the bank. But I couldn't spend 
it, I couldn't have any fun. So a lot of things started to not feel 
logical. I realized there was some aberrational behavior going on here. 
And I didn't feel that good. Once out of the touring context, and out of
 the context of my work, I felt lost.<br>
<br>
Did you ever go to a therapist or seek help like that?<br>
Oh, yeah. I mean, I got really down. Really bad off for a while. And 
what happened was, all my rock &amp; roll answers had fizzled out. I 
realized that my central idea – which, at a young age, was attacking 
music with a really religious type of intensity – was okay to a point. 
But there was a point where it turns in on itself. And you start to go 
down that dark path, and there is a distortion of even the best of 
things. And I reached a point where I felt my life was distorted. I love
 my music, and I wanted to just take it for what it was. I didn't want 
to try to distort it into being my entire life. Because that's a lie. 
It's not true. It's not your entire life. It never can be.<br>
<br>
And I realized my real life is waiting to be lived. All the love and the
 hope and the sorrow and sadness – that's all over there, waiting to be 
lived. And I could ignore it and push it aside or I could say yes to it.
 But to say yes to part of it is to say yes to all of it. That's why 
people say no to all of it. Whether it's drugs or whatever. That's why 
people say no: I'll skip the happiness as long as I don't have to feel 
the pain.<br>
<br>
So I decided to work on it. I worked hard on it. And basically, you have
 to start to open up to who you are. I certainly wasn't the person I 
thought I was. This was around the time of Born in the U.S.A. And I 
bought this big house in New Jersey, which was really quite a thing for 
me to do. It was a place I used to run by all the time. It was a big 
house, and I said, "Hey, this is a rich man's house." And I think the 
toughest thing was that it was in a town where I'd been spit on when I 
was a kid.<br>
<br>
This was in Rumson?<br>
Yeah. When I was sixteen or seventeen my band, from Freehold, was booked
 in a beach club. And we engendered some real hostile reaction. I guess 
we looked kind of – we had on phony snakeskin vests and had long hair. 
There's a picture of me in the Castiles, that's what it was. And I can 
remember being onstage, with guys literally spitting on it. This was 
before it was fashionable, when it kind of meant what it really meant.<br>
<br>
So it was a funny decision, but I bought this house, and at first I 
really began to enjoy it, but then along came the Born in the U.S.A. 
tour, and I was off down the road again. I had a good time, and I began 
to try to figure out things. I was trying to find out how to make some 
of these connections, but once again it was sort of abstract, like how 
to integrate the band into some idea of community in the places we 
passed through.<br>
<br>
<br>
It was during this time that you met Julianne?<br>
Yeah, we met about halfway through that tour. And we got married. And it
 was tough. I didn't really know how to be a husband. She was a terrific
 person, but I just didn't know how to do it.<br>
<br>
Was the marriage part of your whole effort to make connections, to deal with that part of your life?<br>
Yeah, yeah. I really needed something, and I was giving it a shot. 
Anybody who's been through a divorce can tell you what that's about. 
It's difficult, hard and painful for everybody involved. But I sort of 
went on.<br>
<br>
Then Patti and I got together, on the Tunnel of Love tour, and I began 
to find my way around again. But after we came off the road in 1988, I 
had a bad year right away. I got home, and I wasn't very helpful to 
anyone.<br>
<br>
You were still living in Rumson?<br>
Yeah, and then we lived in New York for a while. That wasn't for me, on 
account of growing up in a small town and being used to having cars and 
all that stuff.<br>
<br>
I'd made a lot of plans, but when we got home, I just kind of spun off 
for a while. I just got lost. That lasted for about a year.<br>
<br>
What kinds of things did you do?<br>
The best way I can say it is that I wasn't doing what I said I was going
 to do. Somewhere between realization and actualization, I slipped in 
between the cracks. I was in a lot of fear. And I was just holding out. I
 made life generally unpleasant. And so at some point Patti and I just 
said, "Hell, let's go out to L.A."<br>
<br>
I've always felt a little lighter out here. I've had a house in the 
Hollywood Hills since the early Eighties, and I'd come out here three, 
four months out of the year. I always remember feeling just a little 
lighter, like I was carrying less. So Patti and I came out here, and 
things started to get better. And then the baby came along, and that was
 fantastic. That was just the greatest thing.<br>
<br>
Had you wanted to have a baby in the past?<br>
I know there were a lot of things in the paper about Juli and me and 
that the issue of having a baby was what caused us to break up. Well, 
that just wasn't true. That's a lie.<br>
<br>
But was it something you wanted to do – have a family – or was it something you were afraid of?<br>
Well, yeah [pause], I was afraid. But I was afraid of this whole thing. 
That's what this was about. I had made my music everything. I was real 
good at music and real bad at everything else.<br>
<br>
Was Patti the person who really helped you get through all of this?<br>
Yeah. She had a very sure eye for all of my bullshit. She recognized it.
 She was able to call me on it. I had become a master manipulator. You 
know, "Oh, I'm going out of the house for a little while, and I'm going 
down . . ." I always had a way of moving off, moving away, moving back 
and creating distance. I avoided closeness, and I wouldn't lay my cards 
on the table. I had many ways of doing that particular dance, and I 
thought they were pretty sophisticated. But maybe they weren't. I was 
just doing what came naturally. And then when I hit the stage, it was 
just the opposite. I would throw myself forward, but it was okay because
 it was brief. Hey, that's why they call them one-night stands. It's 
like you're there, then bang! You're gone. I went out in '85 and talked a
 lot about community, but I wasn't a part of any community.<br>
<br>
So when I got back to New York after the Amnesty tour in '88, I was kind
 of wandering and lost, and it was Patti's patience and her 
understanding that got me through. She's a real friend, and we have a 
real great friendship. And finally I said I've got to start dealing with
 this, I've got to take some baby steps.<br>
<br>
What were some of those baby steps?<br>
The best thing I did was I got into therapy. That was really valuable. I
 crashed into myself and saw a lot of myself as I really was. And I 
questioned all my motivations. Why am I writing what I'm writing? Why am
 I saying what I'm saying? Do I mean it? Am I bullshitting? Am I just 
trying to be the most popular guy in town? Do I need to be liked that 
much? I questioned everything I'd ever done, and it was good. You should
 do that. And then you realize there is no single motivation to 
anything. You're doing it for all of those reasons.<br>
<br>
So I went through a real intense period of self-examination. I knew that
 I had to sit in my room for eight hours a day with a guitar to learn 
how to play it, and now I had to put in that kind of time just to find 
my place again.<br>
<br>
Were you writing any songs during this period?<br>
At first, I had nothing to say. Throughout '88 and '89, every time I sat
 down to write, I was just sort of rehashing. I didn't have a new song 
to sing. I just ended up rehashing Tunnel of Love, except not as good. 
And it was all just down and nihilistic. It's funny, because I think 
people probably associate my music with a lot of positives. But it's 
like I really drift into that other thing – I think there's been a lot 
of desperate fun in my songs.<br>
<br>
Then I remembered that Roy [Bittan] had some tracks that he'd play to me
 on occasion. So I called him and said, "Come on over, maybe I'll try to
 write to some of your tracks." So he had the music to "Roll of the 
Dice," and I came up with the idea for that, and I went home and wrote 
the song. It was really about what I was trying to do: I was trying to 
get up the nerve to take a chance.<br>
<br>
And then Roy and I started working together pretty steadily. I had a 
little studio in my garage, and I came up with "Real World." What I 
started to do were little writing exercises. I tried to write something 
that was soul oriented. Or I'd play around with existing pop structures.
 And that's kind of how I did the Human Touch record. A lot of it is 
generic, in a certain sense.<br>
<br>
We worked for about a year, and at the end I tried to put it together. 
Some albums come out full-blown: Tunnel of Love, Nebraska, Lucky Town – 
they just came out all at once. Human Touch was definitely something 
that I struggled to put together. It was like a job. I'd work at it 
every day. But at the end, I felt like it was good, but it was about me 
trying to get to a place. It sort of chronicled the post-Tunnel of Love 
period. So when we finished it, I just sat on it for a couple of months.<br>
<br>
Then I wrote the song "Living Proof," and when I wrote that, I said: 
"Yeah, that's what I'm trying to say. That's how I feel." And that was a
 big moment, because I landed hard in the present, and that was where I 
wanted to be. I'd spent a lot of my life writing about my past, real and
 imagined, in some fashion. But with Lucky Town, I felt like that's 
where I am. This is who I am. This is what I have to say. These are the 
stories I have to tell. This is what's important in my life right now. 
And I wrote and recorded that whole record in three weeks in my house.<br>
Did you ever think about not releasing Human Touch?<br>
Yeah, except that every time I listened to it, I liked it. Also, I 
wanted to put out a lot of music, because I didn't want to be dependent 
on my old songs when I went out to tour. I wanted to have a good body of
 work to draw from when I hit the stage.<br>
<br>
And then I realized that the two albums together kind of tell one story.
 There's Tunnel of Love, then there's what happened in between, which is
 Human Touch, then there's Lucky Town. And basically I said: "Well, hey –
 Guns n' Roses! They put out two albums, maybe I'll try it!"<br>
<br>
There's a perception out there – and a couple of the reviews of the 
albums mentioned it – that you've sealed yourself off from reality, 
living in a big house in L.A. and so forth. Yet based on what you're 
saying, I assume you'd say the truth is quite the opposite.<br>
Those are the clichés, and people have come to buy the clichés in rock 
music. You know, like it's somehow much more acceptable to be addicted 
to heroin than to, say, hang out with jet-setters. But you know, it's 
the old story. People don't know what you're doing unless they're 
walking in your shoes a bit.<br>
<br>
Some of your fans seem to think along the same lines, that by moving to 
L.A. and buying a $14 million house, you've let them down or betrayed 
them.<br>
I kept my promises. I didn't get burned out. I didn't waste myself. I 
didn't die. I didn't throw away my musical values. Hey, I've dug in my 
heels on all those things. And my music has been, for the most part, a 
positive, liberating, living, uplifting thing. And along the way I've 
made a lot of money, and I bought a big house. And I love it. Love it. 
It's great. It's beautiful, really beautiful. And in some ways, it's my 
first real home. I have pictures of my family there. And there's a place
 where I make music, and a place for babies, and it's like a dream.<br>
<br>
I still love New Jersey. We go back all the time. I've been looking at a
 farm there that I might buy. I'd like my kids to have that, too. But I 
came out here, and I just felt like the guy who was born in the U.S.A. 
had left the bandanna behind, you know?<br>
<br>
I've struggled with a lot of things over the past two, three years, and 
it's been real rewarding. I've been very, very happy, truly the happiest
 I've ever been in my whole life. And it's not that one-dimensional idea
 of "happy." It's accepting a lot of death and sorrow and mortality. 
It's putting the script down and letting the chips fall where they may.<br>
<br>
What's been the toughest thing about being a father?<br>
Engagement. Engagement. Engagement. You're afraid to love something so 
much, you're afraid to be that in love. Because a world of fear leaps 
upon you, particularly in the world that we live in. But then you 
realize: "Oh, I see, to love something so much, as much as I love Patti 
and my kids, you've got to be able to accept and live with that world of
 fear, that world of doubt, of the future. And you've got to give it all
 today and not hold back." And that was my specialty; my specialty was 
keeping my distance so that if I lost something, it wouldn't hurt that 
much. And you can do that, but you're never going to have anything.<br>
<br>
It's funny, because the night my little boy was born, it was amazing. 
I've played onstage for hundreds of thousands of people, and I've felt 
my own spirit really rise some nights. But when he came out, I had this 
feeling of a kind of love that I hadn't experienced before. And the 
minute I felt it, it was terrifying. It was like "Wow, I see. This love 
is here to be had and to be felt and experienced? To everybody, on a 
daily basis?" And I knew why you run, because it's very frightening. But
 it's also a window into another world. And it's the world that I want 
to live in right now.<br>
<br>
Has having kids changed the way you look at your own parents?<br>
It was amazing, actually, how much it did change. I'm closer to my folks
 now, and I think they feel closer to me. My pa, particularly. There 
must have been something about my own impending fatherhood that made him
 feel moved to address our relationship. I was kind of surprised; it 
came out of the blue.<br>
<br>
He was never a big verbalizer, and I kind of talked to him through my 
songs. Not the best way to do that, you know. But I knew he heard them. 
And then, before Evan was born, we ended up talking about a lot of 
things I wasn't sure that we'd ever actually address. It was probably 
one of the nicest gifts of my life. And it made my own impending 
fatherhood very rich and more resonant. It's funny, because children are
 very powerful, they affect everything. And the baby wasn't even born 
yet, but he was affecting the way people felt and the way they spoke to 
each other, the way they treated each other.<br>
<br>
You said the song "Pony Boy" was one that your mother used to sing to you.<br>
My grandmother sang it to me when I was young. I made up a lot of the 
words for the verses; I'm sure there are real words, but I'm not sure 
they're the ones I used. It was the song that I used to sing to my 
little boy when he was still inside of Patti. And when he came out, he 
knew it. It's funny. And it used to work like magic. He'd be crying, and
 I'd sing it, and he'd stop on a dime. Amazing.<br>
<br>
You and Patti had a big wedding, didn't you?<br>
It wasn't that big, about eighty or ninety people. It was at the house, 
and it was a great day. You get to say out loud all the things that 
bring you to that place. I'm now a believer in all the rituals and 
things. I think they're really valuable. And I know that getting married
 deepened our relationship. For a long time, I didn't put a lot of faith
 in those things, but I've come to feel that they are important. Like, I
 miss going to church. I'd like to, but I don't know where to go. I 
don't buy into all the dogmatic aspects, but I like the idea of people 
coming together for some sort of spiritual enrichment or enlightenment 
or even just to say hi once a week.<br>
<br>
The fact that the country is spiritually bankrupt is something you've mentioned in connection with the riots in Los Angeles.<br>
We're kind of reaping what's been sown, in a very sad fashion. I mean, 
the legacy we're leaving our kids right now is a legacy of dread. That's
 a big part of what growing up in America is about right now: dread, 
fear, mistrust, blind hatred. We're being worn down to the point where 
who you are, what you think, what you believe, where you stand, what you
 feel in your soul means nothing on a given day. Instead, it's "What do 
you look like? Where are you from?" That's frightening.<br>
<br>
I remember in the early Eighties, I went back to the neighborhood where I
 put together my first band. It was always a mixed neighborhood, and I 
was with a friend of mine, and we got out of the car and were just 
walking around for about twenty minutes. And when I got back to the car,
 there were a bunch of older black men and younger guys, and they got 
all around the car and said, "What are you doing?" I said, "Well, I 
lived here for about four or five years," and I just basically said what
 we were doing there. And they said: "No, what are you doing in our 
neighborhood? When we go to your neighborhood, we get stopped for just 
walking down the streets. People want to know what we're doing in your 
neighborhood. So what are you doing in our neighborhood?" And it was 
pretty tense.<br>
<br>
The riots broke out right after our second interview session. It was pretty frightening being in L.A. then.<br>
<br>
It really felt like the wall was coming down. On Thursday [the day after
 the riots began], we were down in Hollywood rehearsing, and people were
 scared. People were really scared. And then you were just, like, sad or
 angry.<br>
<br>
At the end of the Sixties, there was a famous commission that Lyndon 
Johnson put together, and they said it would take a massive, sustained 
effort by the government and by the people to make life better in the 
inner cities. And all the things they started back then were dismantled 
in the last decade. And a lot of brutal signals were sent, which created
 a real climate for intolerance. And people picked up on it and ran with
 the ball. The rise of the right and of the radical right-wing groups is
 not accidental. David Duke – it's embarrassing.<br>
<br>
So we've been going backward. And we didn't just come up short in our efforts to do anything about this, we came up bankrupt.<br>
<br>
We're selling our future away, and I don't think anybody really believes
 that whoever is elected in the coming election is going to seriously 
address the issues in some meaningful fashion.<br>
On the one hand there seems to be a tremendous sense of disillusionment 
in this country. Yet on the other hand, it seems like George Bush could 
be reelected.<br>
I think so, too – but not on my vote. People have been flirting with the
 outside candidates, but that's all I think it is. When they go put 
their money down, though, it always winds up being with someone in the 
mainstream. And the frustrating thing is, you know it's not going to 
work.<br>
<br>
Do any of the candidates appeal to you?<br>
What Jerry Brown is saying is true – all that stuff is true. And I liked
 Jesse Jackson when he ran last time around. But I guess there hasn't 
really been anyone who can bring these ideas to life, who can make 
people believe that there's some other way.<br>
<br>
America is a conservative country, it really is. I think that's one 
thing the past ten years have shown. But I don't know if people are 
really organized, and I don't think there's a figure out there who's 
been able to embody the things that are eating away at the soul of the 
nation at large.<br>
<br>
I mean, the political system has really broken down. We've abandoned a 
gigantic part of the population – we've just left them for dead. But 
we're gonna have to pay the piper some day. But you worry about the life
 of your own children, and people live in such a state of dread that it 
affects the overall spiritual life of the nation as a whole. I mean, I 
live great, and plenty of people do, but it affects you internally in 
some fashion, and it just eats away at whatever sort of spirituality you
 pursue.<br>
<br>
Do you see any cause for optimism?<br>
Well, somebody's going to have to address these issues. I don't think 
they can go unaddressed forever. I believe that the people won't stand 
for it, ultimately. Maybe we're not at that point yet. But at some 
point, the cost of not addressing these things is just going to be too 
high.<br>
<br>
A lot of people have pointed out that rappers have addressed a lot of these issues. What kind of music do you listen to?<br>
I like Sir Mix-a-Lot. I like Queen Latifah; I like her a lot. I also 
like Social Distortion. I think Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell is a 
great record, a great rock &amp; roll album. "Born to Lose" is great 
stuff. I like Faith No More. I like Live; I think that guy [Edward 
Kowalczyk] is a really good singer. I like a song on the Peter Case 
record, "Beyond the Blues." Really good song.<br>
<br>
How do you keep up with what's happening musically?<br>
Every three or four months I'll just wander through Tower Records and 
buy, like, fifty things, and I get in my car and just pop things in and 
out. I'm a big curiosity buyer. Sometimes I get something just because 
of the cover. And then I also watch TV. On Sundays, I'll flick on 120 
Minutes and just see who's doing what.<br>
<br>
Mike Appel, your former manager, has contributed to a new book (Down 
Thunder Road: The Making of Bruce Springsteen) that essentially claims 
that your current manager, Jon Landau, stole you out from under him.<br>
Well, that's a shame, you know, because what happened was Mike and I had
 kind of reached a place where our relationship had kind of bumped up 
against its limitations. We were a dead-end street. And Jon came in, and
 he had a pretty sophisticated point of view, and he had an idea how to 
solve some very fundamental problems, like how to record and where to 
record.<br>
<br>
But Mike kind of turned Jon into his monster, maybe as a way of not 
turning me into one. It's a classic thing: Who wants to blame themselves
 for something that went wrong? Nobody does. It's tough to say, "Maybe I
 fucked it up." But the truth is, if it hadn't been Jon, it would have 
been somebody else – or nobody else, but I would have gone my own way. 
Jon didn't say, "Hey, let's do what I want to do." He said, "I'm here to
 help you do what you're going to do." And that's what he's done since 
the day we met.<br>
<br>
Two other people who used to work with you, ex-roadies, sued a few years
 ago, charging that you hadn't paid them overtime, among other things. 
What was your reaction to that?<br>
It was disappointing. I worked with these two people for a long time, 
and I thought I'd really done the right thing. And when they left, it 
was handshakes and hugs all around, you know. And then about a year 
later, bang!<br>
<br>
I think that if you asked the majority of people who had worked with me 
how they felt about the experience, they'd say they'd been treated 
really well. But it only takes one disgruntled or unhappy person, and 
that's what everyone wants to hear; the drum starts getting beat. But 
outside of all that – the bullshit aspect of it – if you spend a long 
time with someone and there's a very fundamental misunderstanding, well,
 you feel bad about it.<br>
<br>
You recently appeared on Saturday Night Live. It was the first time you ever performed on TV. How did you like it?<br>
<br>
It felt very intense. You rehearse two or three times before you go on, 
but when we actually did it, it was like "Okay, you've got three songs, 
you got to give it up." It was different, but I really enjoyed it. I 
mean, I must not have been on TV for all this time for some reason, but 
now that I've done it, it's like "Gee, why didn't I do this before?" 
There must have been some reason. And I certainly think that I'm going 
to begin using television more in some fashion. I think it's in the 
cards for me at this point, to find a way to reach people who might be 
interested in what I'm saying, what I'm singing about.<br>
<br>
I believe in this music as much as anything I've ever written. I think 
it's the real deal. I feel like I'm at the peak of my creative powers 
right now. I think that in my work I'm presenting a complexity of ideas 
that I've been struggling to get to in the past. And it took me ten 
years of hard work outside of the music to get to this place. Real hard 
work. But when I got here, I didn't find bitterness and disillusionment.
 I found friendship and hope and faith in myself and a sense of purpose 
and passion. And it feels good. I feel like that great Sam and Dave song
 "Born Again." I feel like a new man.<br>

The members of the E Street Band look back at the fifteen-month tour that made Bruce Springsteen a national hero<br>
<br>
by: David Fricke</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
The show would be well into its fourth hour, the musicians visibly 
wilting under the hot lights and the damp weight of their own sweat as 
they summoned up the energy for that last blast of "Born to Run." But 
Bruce Springsteen would never say, "Enough," until the last member of 
the audience keeled over in joyous exhaustion. After each encore, every 
night for nearly a year and a half during his 1984-85 world tour, 
Springsteen called his E Street Band into a brief huddle backstage.<br>
<br>
"We had a saying," explains saxman Clarence Clemons. "'Are they still on
 their feet? Yeah, let's go back and get 'em. Can they still raise their
 hands? If they can, we haven't done our job.' When we finally saw the 
guys in the front row falling down, lying over each other, then we said,
 'Okay, they've had enough. Let's go home."'<br>
<br>
Having started the Born in the U.S.A. tour in St. Paul, Minnesota, on 
June 29th, 1984. Springsteen and the E Street Band didn't go home until 
October 2nd, 1985–after their last four shows drew more than 330,000 
people to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Their labors, of course, 
did not go unrewarded. Born in the U.S.A. sold more than 10 million 
copies in the United States alone, becoming the biggest-selling album in
 the history of Columbia Records. The tour grossed $80 to $90 million 
from ticket sales ($34 million of that came from Springsteen's stadium 
shows in only fourteen cities). Bruce was the people's choice in Rolling
 Stone's 1985 Readers Poll, sweeping the Artist, Male Vocalist, 
Songwriter and Best Live Performance of the Year categories. And in the 
Critics Poll, he shared Artist of the Year honors with miracle worker 
Bob Geldof, while the E Street Band – Clemons, drummer Max Weinberg, 
keyboardists Roy Bittan and Danny Federici, bassist Garry Tallent, 
guitarist Nils Lofgren and vocalist Patti Scialfa – tied for Band of the
 Year with Irish pals U2. In short, Bruce Springsteen was indisputably 
the Boss in 1985.<br>
<br>
100 Greatest Artists: Bruce Springsteen<br>
<br>
The sales figures and tour grosses tell, however, only the accountants' 
side of the story. Whether it was the June '84 warm-up date at the Stone
 Pony in Asbury Park, New Jersey, or the outdoor concert in Göteborg, 
Sweden, where Springsteen performed under the burnt-orange rays of the 
midnight sun, his shows were do-it-till-you-drop spectaculars, parties 
already way out of bounds by the time he trotted out the old bar-band 
standbys ("Twist and Shout," "Devil with a Blue Dress On"). One night in
 Japan, Springsteen brought a young girl up onstage, as he did 
everywhere, to do the twist with him on "Dancing in the Dark." "She was 
good, too," Clemons recalls, "but as soon as she got offstage, she 
collapsed. She fell right over."<br>
<br>
The fun of falling over never obscured Springsteen's unmistakable 
message – you've got to stand tall in spite of it all – in songs like 
"Born in the U.S.A.," the bouncy "Working on the Highway" and his 
electrified Nebraska meditation "Mansion on the Hill." Springsteen took 
it upon himself to set the example, giving his usual 110 percent during 
an '84 show in Tacoma, Washington, even though he was suffering from a 
debilitating virus. In the face of Rambo-mania and the misrepresentation
 of his Born in the U.S.A. message by nearsighted conservatives, he 
plugged Vietnam-veterans organizations, local food banks and 
community-action groups while quietly pledging his own money to many of 
these causes. And in a year when Live Aid proved what a world community 
of rock fans could accomplish, Springsteen demonstrated night after 
night what just one die-hard rock fan could do.<br>
<br>
"I don't really think I could live with myself if I did it any other 
way," Springsteen told Rolling Stone early in the tour, describing his 
faith in the power of music and how that faith manifests itself in his 
performances. "A lot of what I do up there I do for myself, because you 
go out there and your pride is on the line, your sense of self-respect, 
and you feel like 'Hey, there's something important happening here.' You
 have a chance to do something. And you wanna make the best of it."<br>
<br>
"It takes a lot of courage to believe as strongly as he does," remarks 
Patti Scialfa, whom Springsteen hired after hearing her sing at a Stone 
Pony jam session one Sunday night in 1983. "It made every show special 
to me because you carried that belief with you. It was great to be going
 around making music that had such a strong center of faith. It made 
every show seem to have so much more depth. It wasn't just a musical 
expression; you were working your heart muscles, too."<br>
<br>
Springsteen didn't waste too much energy on rehearsals for his massive 
tour. In May of '84, he convened the E Street Band at Big Man's West, 
Clarence Clemons' club in Red Bank, New Jersey. The purpose was a 
combination jam session and audition for Nils Lofgren. It was the first 
time Springsteen and the band had played together in a live setting 
since the River tour in 1981. Yet as soon as Springsteen counted off 
"Prove It All Night," "It was like we'd never stopped," says Max 
Weinberg. "We looked around at each other like 'Wow, that's what we've 
been missing."'<br>
<br>
Weinberg had undergone five hand operations for tendinitis prior to the 
Born in the U.S.A. tour, but he was ready to play. (During the last nine
 months of the tour, however, he had to tape the ring finger of his left
 hand around the drumstick because he couldn't bend the finger at all.) 
After that Red Bank jam session, he says, the band rehearsed for four or
 five days in New Jersey before heading to central Pennsylvania for 
three days of dress rehearsals with full sound and lights.<br>
<br>
"It was maybe eight or nine rehearsals altogether," Weinberg recalls. 
"And that's a lot. On the River tour, we rehearsed four days. On the 
Born to Run tour, we didn't rehearse at all. We went right from the last
 recording session to a rehearsal room at eight in the morning, we ran 
through the set and played that night."<br>
<br>
"We know each other so well," says organist Danny Federici, who has 
played with Springsteen for eighteen years, "that we can tell what song 
we're going to play just by the way Bruce counts it off or the way he 
wants it by the intensity with which he counts it off. Bruce would go, 
'One, two, three, four,' and we'd all play the same song. We didn't 
discuss what it would be."<br>
<br>
The secret, according to Clarence Clemons, a member of Springsteen's 
band for fourteen years, is simple: "When you learn a Bruce Springsteen 
song, it's like learning to ride a bike. You don't forget it."<br>
<br>
But newcomers Scialfa and Nils Lofgren – the first new E Street members 
in ten years – didn't have a lot of time to learn. Lofgren had met 
Springsteen in 1969 at the Fillmore West in San Francisco, where Bruce's
 band Steel Mill was playing an audition. They kept bumping into each 
other on the Northeast college circuit in the early Seventies, so when 
Lofgren got a call from Springsteen, right before the rehearsals, asking
 him to replace the departing Miami Steve Van Zandt, "I was familiar 
with a lot of the famous songs. But I wasn't exactly ready to step into 
the guitar parts." Lofgren paid a visit to a Springsteen tape collector 
he knew in Washington D.C. and borrowed bootleg recordings of a 1981 
River show and Born in the U.S.A., which hadn't even been released yet. 
He worked up chord charts for about fifteen songs, then went to New 
Jersey the next day.<br>
<br>
"People ask me to compare playing with Neil Young and Bruce," notes 
Lofgren, who has recorded and toured extensively with Young. "To me, if 
you gotta label it, Bruce plays melodic rock &amp; roll – melodies with 
tough rhythms. His songs are more structured. So it was easy for me to 
know when to step in and step out. Originally, all I did was cop some of
 the important guitar parts that Bruce and Steve had done on the 
records. At least it was something they wrote, and it wouldn't throw 
anybody. It seemed to be a safe place to start."<br>
<br>
Scialfa, a graduate of Asbury Park High School, had in fact auditioned 
for Springsteen twice previously – before Born to Run was released and 
earlier, when he was leading a big band called Dr. Zoom and the Sonic 
Boom. But she was thrown straight into the deep end when she joined the 
tour on five days' notice. She spent the first three weeks singing from 
"cheat sheets," with the lyrics printed in bold letters and specific 
cues written in the margins. Her biggest problem onstage, though, was 
concentrating on her parts with all of that E Street energy whipping 
around her.<br>
<br>
"There was one time where I forgot to sing because I was so absorbed in 
watching and listening," Scialfa remembers. "But I felt confident inside
 because Bruce was so confident. I'd try to lock in with him. I'd watch 
his back, watch him breathe."<br>

The first American leg of the tour totaled ninety-four shows in 
forty-five cities. It climaxed on January 26th and 27th, 1985, with two 
concerts at the cavernous Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York. The crowds
 there – 39,000 people each night – were the largest of Springsteen's 
career up to that time. They were also a sign of things to come.<br>
<br>
For Federici, the first leg was the hardest part of the tour, "because 
we were doing a lot more one-night stands in real close cities, flying 
out and playing the next day." But there was little rock &amp; roll 
backstage monkey business; the entire Springsteen organization, from 
Bruce on down, was a model of efficiency.<br>
<br>
"When you go backstage at a Bruce Springsteen show, you don't see a 
circus," declares Clarence Clemons. "Everybody has a job to do, and 
everybody goes about it seriously. Bruce instills the moral fiber that 
runs through the whole organization."<br>
<br>
Each of the members of the E Street Band prepared for the evening's work
 in his or her own quiet way. Clemons, a recent convert to the Indian 
guru Sri Chinmoy, meditated for about a half hour and received a massage
 before every show. A few band members warmed up with a game of 
ping-pong. Backstage guests were usually escorted to a hospitality 
suite, well stocked with food and drink, where they awaited visits from 
Springsteen and the band.<br>
<br>
It was often an all-star crunch. Elizabeth Taylor, Don Rickles, John 
McEnroe and Jack Nicholson, with Meryl Streep on his arm, were among the
 nonrock stars who attended. Royalty included Princess Stephanie and 
Prince Albert of Monaco, who attended the Paris show, and purple 
potentate Prince of Minneapolis, who showed up in Clarence Clemons' 
dressing room there and complimented Clemons' Swedish wife, Christina, 
on her dress.<br>
<br>
Clemons says one of the high points of the tour for him was when Sean 
Connery, "the James Bond, came back and said he really admired me." But 
did it ever get crazy backstage with all those luminaries jockeying for 
position? "No," he says serenely, "we were the luminaries. They came to 
our gig."<br>
<br>
No one enjoyed those gigs more than the musicians themselves. "Nils said
 it in a fantastic quote," notes Weinberg. "He said it's like you get up
 there with Bruce and they've given you four hours to live. And this is 
your four hours. Now what are you going to do with your time?"<br>
<br>
To a man – and woman – the E Streeters agree that out of the 
approximately 150 shows they performed in 1984 and 1985, they didn't 
have a single bum night. Led by Springsteen, with a calm assurance born 
of nearly twenty years at center stage, they displayed a consistency 
each night that was equal parts technique and telepathy. The "stump the 
band" aspect of the group's mid-Seventies concerts – when Springsteen 
would suddenly alter the set in midshow, calling out an old cover or a 
forgotten LP track – tapered off as the band went into stadiums. "For 
the sake of projecting to 50,000 people, you needed more structure," 
claims Weinberg. Yet, while ninety percent of every show ran like 
clockwork, Springsteen always left an extra ten percent, Lofgren says, 
"to goof with."<br>
<br>
For example, there was the night at Giants Stadium in New Jersey when 
the band was set to play "I'm on Fire," from Born in the U.S.A., and 
Springsteen abruptly called out "Fire" instead. At one of the last shows
 on the tour, Springsteen had finished the last encore when someone in 
the crowd threw an artificial leg onstage. "A whole leg," recalls 
Weinberg, marveling. "Bruce picks it up and says, 'We've got to play one
 more for this guy.' So we all run back to our instruments, but what the
 hell are we gonna play? Bruce looks at the leg and says, 'Fellas, 
"Stand on It." ' "<br>
<br>
After completing the U.S. arena tour in syracuse, the band took a 
six-week breather during February and March before taking on the rest of
 the world. Springsteen's international itinerary included spring and 
summer swings through Britain, Europe and countries like Australia and 
Japan where the group had never performed before.<br>
<br>
But Bruce's rock &amp; roll gospel of self-respect and emotional 
liberation needed no translation. Japanese, Australian and European 
audiences easily grasped the universality of his frank, lyric portrayal 
of the tarnished American dream – the dashed hopes and defiant 
aspirations. Clarence Clemons was astonished to see young Japanese fans 
waving American and Japanese flags sewn together during shows there. In 
Milan, Italy, 60,000 people sang "My Hometown" with Springsteen while, 
ironically, an American serviceman near the foot of the stage stood at 
attention, holding the Stars and Stripes for the entire show.<br>
<br>
"You could hear the whole audience singing," Max Weinberg remembers. 
"The idea of community in rock &amp; roll is never more apparent than 
when something like that happens. The things we've seen from our vantage
 point onstage are irreplaceable memories."<br>
<br>
"I wish some of the politicians had seen these things," declares 
Clemons. "Those kids didn't understand the words to 'Born in the 
U.S.A.,' but they understood what we were singing about. Those things 
Bruce sings about, attention to self and country, pertain not only to 
America. They pertain to everybody."<br>
<br>
Clemons remembers swooping down in a helicopter over Slane Castle, near 
Dublin, Ireland, awed by the sight of over 70,000 people gathered there 
for the band's show. "It's wasn't only the sheer volume of numbers, but 
the sheer volume of harmony and peace. The next day I was in a cab going
 to the airport, and the driver turned to me and said: 'You were better 
than the pope. You brought the North and the South together, and there 
were no fights.' And that's what it's all about. That's why we knock 
ourselves out."<br>
<br>
Audiences responded everywhere. At a race track in Brisbane, Australia, 
Springsteen asked the crowd to raise their hands in the air during 
"Twist and Shout." "They were so tightly packed together," says 
Weinberg, "they couldn't get their hands down. They were standing there 
in front of us, waving their hands. I felt, 'Wow, this must have been 
what Beatlemania was like.' They were completely freaking out." The 
normally reserved Japanese, he adds, "were the best dancers I've ever 
seen. And they knew all the words."<br>
<br>
The decision by Springsteen and his manager, Jon Landau, to play large, 
outdoor venues, first in Europe and then in the States, was not made 
lightly. Springsteen worried about the loss of intimacy and the often 
inferior sound quality at stadium rock shows. "But there was a time when
 Bruce didn't want to go into arenas because of the same argument," 
Garry Tallent points out. "We had to take the shot. Some intimacy was 
lost." he admits, "but something was there to replace it – the event 
itself. We pulled it off."<br>
<br>
To compensate for the increased distance between band and audience, 
Springsteen doubled the size of his sound system and added giant video 
screens to broadcast the action onstage to the back rows. Danny Federici
 says some of the band members also made slight adjustments in their 
stage wear. "We'd wear more vivid colors so we could be seen. I remember
 telling Garry, 'That shirt's a little too busy; they won't see you in 
the back.' We tried to get our clothing together a little bit better, 
wear more outrageous shirts."<br>
<br>
"When you play big places like that, there's a tendency to think that if
 you jump around a lot, people are going to notice you more," explains 
Nils Lofgren, a veteran of stadium shows with Neil Young. "But in those 
places, it doesn't matter, because twenty or thirty rows out you still 
look like a dot. The best thing for us to do, with the video cameras 
there, was to do exactly what we normally did – be ourselves and let the
 cameras pick it up."<br>
<br>
Max Weinberg dubbed the U.S. outdoor stadium shows that wound up the 
tour in September and October the Pestilence Tour. At the Cotton Bowl in
 Dallas, the band was attacked by a horde of crickets that got in the 
musicians' hair, on Weinberg's drum kit and even down the back of 
Springsteen's shirt while he was getting sentimental in "My Hometown." 
In Philadelphia, the temperature onstage registered 106 degrees. In 
Denver, the mercury plummeted to 35 degrees, with snow to boot. The 
weather was fine in Miami; unfortunately, the Orange Bowl there did not 
have an electrical system adequate for high-volume rock &amp; roll. 
Diesel generators were brought in to take up the slack and set up behind
 the stage. Says Weinberg, groaning, "Those fumes were killing us."<br>
<br>
Throughout the tour, the Springsteen road crew numbered between thirty 
and forty members. (By comparison, the Who traveled with a crew of 
ninety on their 1982 farewell U.S. tour.) The sound, lights and band 
gear filled nine tractor-trailers; the three separate outdoor stages 
used for the stadium shows took up another fifteen trucks. Often, while a
 crew was dismantling a stage in one stadium, Springsteen was performing
 on a second one in another city and a crew member was overseeing 
construction of a third stage in the next scheduled venue. Although the 
crew usually had two days to set up the entire production, they set a 
record at Giants Stadium when, because of a conflict with a football 
game there, they put up the stage, sound, lights and instruments in only
 seventeen hours.<br>
<br>
Springsteen probably set a record, quite unintentionally, for breaking 
female hearts when he married actress and model Julianne Phillips last 
spring. But the betrothal didn't come as a real surprise to the E Street
 Band. "Seeing the look in their eyes before they were married reminded 
me very much of me and my wife, Becky," says Max Weinberg. Clarence 
Clemons knew it was coming after Springsteen played godfather at the 
christening of Clemons' third son, Christopher, in Hawaii early last 
year.<br>
<br>
"When he was holding the kid," Clemons recalls, smiling, "I looked into 
his eyes and thought, 'Well, he's gone.' Two weeks later he called me up
 and said, 'Big Man, I'm gettin' married.' I said, 'I know."'<br>
<br>
When the tour finally ended in Los Angeles last October, Springsteen and
 the E Street Band felt, in Max Weinberg's words, "incredibly drained 
but incredibly buzzed." The length of the tour and of the shows 
themselves had a kind of reverse effect on the band. Charged by the 
unflagging energy of their leader and their audiences, they actually 
thrived on the physical and psychological demands made on them.<br>
<br>
"Of course, you get exhausted," admits Clemons. "You want to pass out. I
 came close a couple of times. But you're filled with something, that 
feedback that comes from the audience. You feel so strong that if 
somebody shot you with a gun you could keep going."<br>
<br>
Everybody has settled down in recent months, at least for the time 
being. While Springsteen enjoys married life at his home in Rumson, New 
Jersey, the members of the E Street Band are using their extended 
vacation to indulge their own interests. Both Clemons and Nils Lofgren 
managed to squeeze recording sessions into tour breaks last year that 
resulted in solo albums – Lofgren's lively rock-out Flip and Clemons' 
ebullient pop outing Hero. Spurred by the Top Twenty success of his duet
 with Jackson Browne, "You're a Friend of Mine," Clemons will be taking 
most of his Hero studio band on the road for a summer tour. The Big Man 
may also take up a large chunk of your television screen; he's in the 
running for future guest-star roles in Hill Street Blues and Miami Vice.
 But in keeping with his spiritual rebirth, he insists, "I'll never do a
 role I wouldn't want my guru to see. I won't be a coke dealer, I won't 
be a pimp."<br>
<br>
Lofgren recently spent a working holiday at Neil Young's ranch in 
northern California, writing material for a solo album to be recorded by
 spring. He is a permanent member of the E Street Band, though. "I 
didn't want to be a gun for hire for eighteen months. I'll be there 
whenever they play."<br>
<br>
Patti Scialfa is shopping a demo tape of original material. She wants to
 release an album this summer. Danny Federici bought a house in his old 
home town of Flemington, New Jersey; an electronics enthusiast, he 
installed a recording studio where he composes instrumental music – for 
television soundtracks, he hopes. Garry Tallent has ambitions in record 
producing. He just finished production on a charity-rock single by 
Jersey Artists for Mankind (JAM), featuring Southside Johnny, assorted 
Jukes, jazz guitarist Tal Farlow and Nils Lofgren.<br>
<br>
Roy Bittan continues to do sessions, and Max Weinberg worked as both 
drummer and mixing assistant of the debut album of highly touted Philly 
rocker John Eddie. Weinberg, who published a book called The Big Beat, a
 collection of interviews he conducted with great rock drummers, is also
 touring as a solo act – on the college lecture circuit, talking about 
both his drumming and life with you-know-who.<br>
<br>
But Bruce only has to nod his head and everyone will jump back to E 
Street again. At a New Year's Eve party for the band at his home, 
Springsteen suggested getting together periodically for jam sessions, 
hinting that he already had some new material ready. "There isn't 
anybody in the E Street Band who wouldn't immediately drop what they're 
doing," declares Weinberg. In fact, they were all very sorry to see the 
tour end.<br>
<br>
"On the last night, I cried," Weinberg admits. "There's a video clip 
that I saw on Entertainment Tonight. We were all lined up, and I can see
 tears in my eyes. I can see tears in everybody's eyes. When Bruce was 
singing 'Glory Days' and he turned around and said the line, 'Boys, 
we're going home now,' it really struck home."<br>

<br>
After the mammoth success of 'Born in the U.S.A.,' the rocker took a 
hard look at his career and decided to bring his music back down to 
human proportions<br>
<br>
by: Steve Pond<br>
</strong><br>
The audience consists of his sound crew, his sax player's wife and son 
and a couple dozen ushers and security guards. But that doesn't stop 
Bruce Springsteen, who's turning in an extraordinary performance at the 
Omni, in Atlanta. He's in the middle of a late-afternoon sound check – 
not one of the marathon sound checks for which Springsteen used to be 
known but an hour-long chance to refresh his music by playing oldies or 
current favorites or whatever pops into his head.<br>
<br>
Springsteen stands in the middle of the huge white stage in jeans and a 
long-sleeved white shirt, laughing as he tries to piece together 
half-remembered lyrics, joking when a band member tosses out the rif 
from a familiar oldie and muttering, "Okay, what next?" when he finishes
 a tune. It's a country and folk set: the Everly Brothers, Hank Williams
 and some lesser-known choices. Some songs fizzle out after a verse or 
two; every so often, though, Springsteen and the band instinctively 
craft a full-bodied arrangement, grab a song and claim it as their own.<br>
<br>
That happens during "Across the Borderline," a six-year-old song by Ry 
Cooder, John Hiatt and Jim Dickinson from the movie The Border. A 
plaintive lament about Mexicans in search of an American paradise, the 
song is one of Bruce's current passions: one person in Springsteen's 
entourage says he's driven everyone crazy playing it in the van.<br>
<br>
So when Springsteen sings its opening lines, the members of the band 
quickly latch on to the slow groove; they've heard this one before. 
Guitarist Nils Lofgren picks up a slide and adds an aching counterpoint 
to Springsteen's vocals. By the first chorus, this has become a 
performance to break hearts: "When you reach the broken promised 
land/Every dream slips through your hand/And you'll know that it's too 
late to change your mind/Cause you've paid the price to come so far/Just
 to wind up where you are/And you're still just across the borderline."*<br>
<br>
Like the best of Springsteen's own music, this is a song with a deep 
sense of consequences. Not only do its lines about shattered dreams and 
broken promises recall his songs, but the song seems to speak directly 
to the experience of a man who dreamed of becoming a rock star, then 
became the biggest; who found himself feeling isolated and empty and 
fought that by reassessing his work, then by turning to his marriage; 
who at age thirty-eight has set aside his fervent belief that rock &amp;
 roll can save you in favor of the more sober idea that love might save 
you – if you work at it hard and long enough.<br>
<br>
"I guess I used to think that rock could save you," he says later. "I 
don't believe it can anymore. It can do a lot. It's certainly done a lot
 for me – gave me focus and direction and energy and purpose. I suppose,
 when I was a kid, it was your best friend: your new 45, man, that was 
your best buddy.<br>
<br>
"But as you get older, you realize that it is not enough. Music alone – 
you can take some shelter there, and you can find some comfort and 
happiness, you can dance, you can slow-dance with your girl, but you 
can't hide in it. And it is so seductive that you want to hide in it. 
And then if you get in the position of somebody like me, where you can 
if you want to, you really can."<br>
<br>
He stops himself. "Well, you think you can, anyway. In the end you 
really can't, because no matter who you are, whether it's me or Elvis or
 Michael Jackson, in the end you really can't. You can use all your 
powers to isolate yourself, to surround yourself with luxury, to 
intoxicate yourself in any particular fashion that you so desire. But it
 just starts eating you away inside, because there is something you get 
from engagement with people, from a connection with a person, that you 
just cannot get anyplace else. I suppose I had a moment where I kinda 
crashed into that idea, before I was married....<br>
<br>
"It's just confusing. Even the type of connection you can make in your 
show, which is enormous, you can't live there. You have three hours 
onstage, and then you got the other twenty-one. You may know exactly 
what you're doing in those three hours, but you better figure out what 
you're gonna do in them other twenty-one, because you can't book 
yourself around the clock."<br>
<br>
"The first thing I did," Springsteen says, "was make everyone stand in a
 different place." It was the first day of rehearsals for the Tunnel of 
Love Express, and he knew it was time for a show that would be 
drastically different from the stadium-rock blowouts that had followed 
his album Bom in the U.S.A. – especially since those shows had 
themselves been similar to the acclaimed concerts he'd been doing ever 
since he started playing large arenas in 1978.<br>
<br>
So he moved the members of the E Street Band out of the places most of 
them had occupied onstage for the past thirteen years: drummer Max 
Weinberg moved to the side; pianist Roy Bittan and keyboardist Dan 
Federici traded places; so did guitarist Nils Lofgren and bassist Garry 
Tallent; sax man Clarence Clemons shifted from Bruce's right to his 
left; and singer Patti Scialfa picked up a guitar, moved into Clarence's
 old position and became Springsteen's new onstage foil. A horn section 
recruited from the New Jersey bar band La Bamba and the Hubcaps took up 
the rear. Springsteen had tried this once before – at the beginning of 
the rehearsals for the Born in the U.S.A. tour-but back then, he says, 
the band "flipped."<br>
<br>
This time the musicians, who knew that their boss had considered a solo 
acoustic tour, quickly adjusted to the change. Springsteen knew what he 
didn't want – "I made a little list of stuff I couldn't imagine 
playing," he says – but when manager Jon Landau said it was time to 
start booking the tour, he didn't know what he wanted. "I said, 'I don't
 know if I have a set,' " says Springsteen with a laugh. "Jon said, 
'Well, you know, that's your job, you've been doing it a long time, you 
do it good, so it'll happen.' So I took his word for it."<br>
<br>
Two and a half months later, when he takes the stage of the Omni, 
Springsteen has a show. It rocks almost as much as his past concerts, 
but it's also far more intimate: where his last tour, which played some 
huge outdoor stadiums, explored the ideas of community and society, this
 tour, which is limited to indoor arenas, focuses on desire, commitment 
and family. The first set is part relationship songs from the Tunnel of 
Love album. It's part B sides and outtakes: "Be True" and "Roulette" 
were both recorded for The River. (Springsteen now says, "Both of those 
songs should have been on The River, and I'm sure they would have been 
better than a couple other things that we threw on there.") And at the 
end of the set are a couple of barn burners from the Born in the U.S.A. 
tour. Songs that have served as longtime Springsteen staples are 
missing, for the most part replaced by music that is hard, dark and 
almost claustrophobic: each gentle, nostalgic moment is shattered by 
colder, more fearful songs.<br>
<br>
Near the end of the set, pianist Roy Bittan plays a pastoral melody, and
 Springsteen steps to the mike. The monologue he delivers, ostensibly 
about the unmarried mother who's the central character in "Spare Parts,"
 could just as easily deal with a rock &amp; roll star who's determined 
to do something different.<br>
<br>
"The past is a funny thing," he says, as the crowd quiets down and 
Bittan plays softly. "The past is something that seems to bind us all 
together with memory and experience. And it's also something, I guess, 
that can drag you down and hold you back as you get stuck in old dreams 
that just break your heart over and over again when they don't come 
true."<br>
<br>
A brutal version of "Spare Parts" follows, then an angry "War" – no 
introduction needed, what with Ronald Reagan's troops sitting in 
Honduras – and finally, just before intermission, "Born in the U.S.A." 
Three years ago, this song was the hard-fought call to arms that began 
virtually all of Springsteen's shows; now, coming at the end of a set 
that dwells on devastating personal and social struggles, it lacks any 
suggestion of the patriotism that some people insisted on reading into 
it on the last tour. Musically as exultant as ever, "Born in the U.S.A."
 suddenly hits home as an agonized, brutal modern-day blues.<br>
<br>
"When we played that first set in rehearsal," Springsteen says, "I said,
 'Yeah, that's good.' " Sitting in the semidarkness of his backstage 
dressing room in Atlanta, he drops his voice to a gravelly whisper. "It 
felt real new, real modern to me. I figure some people will wrestle with
 it a little bit" He breaks the spell with a loud, hoarse laugh. "But 
that's okay."<br>
<br>
It's shortly after 1:00 a.m., and the rest of the E Street Band is gone.
 There's nobody around in the Omni dressing rooms marked Horns, Patti, 
Band and Mokshagun (the name given to Clarence Clemons by his guru, Sri 
Chinmoy, whose framed picture sits next to a lighted candle in Clemons's
 dressing room). The Springsteen tour is low-key, calm and precisely 
organized; if there weren't a show tomorrow, they'd already be flying to
 the next city or flying home to Jersey for a day or two.<br>
<br>
Now Springsteen sits back in an overstuffed chair, clad in black slacks,
 a black dress shirt, a black leather blazer and the silver-tipped black
 cowboy boots he wears onstage; he has a gold wedding band on his left 
hand and a single diamond stud in his left ear. He drinks a Heineken 
very slowly and occasionally takes a pretzel from the small bowl on his 
coffee table. Behind him, a portable heater glows red. The room is 
austere: a curtain in front of the door, a folding rubdown table, a 
buffet table lightly stocked with food and drink.<br>
<br>
Though he doesn't look tired, Springsteen speaks slowly, fighting his 
impulse to ramble. Most of the time he's serious and philosophical, 
though the nervous, wheezing belly laugh with which he constantly 
interrupts both his jokes and his most thoughtful and revealing comments
 suggests he can't take himself too seriously.<br>
<br>
"The idea on this tour," he says, "is that you wouldn't know what song 
was gonna come next. And the way you do that is you just throw out all 
your cornerstones, the stuff that had not become overly ritualized on 
the Born in the U.S.A. tour but would have been if we did it now. It 
would have been pushin' the buttons a little bit, you know?" Springsteen
 and the band had more rehearsals for this tour than for all their 
previous tours combined. In the process, songs were dropped as 
Springsteen found his themes, and certain tunes "stopped making 
emotional sense." The last song to go was "Darlington County," which 
he'd added to lighten a set he finally decided he didn't want to 
lighten.<br>
<br>
"That sense of dread – man, it's everywhere," he says, staring at the 
wall of his dressing room. "It's outside, it's inside, it's in the 
bedroom, its on the street. The main thing was to show people striving 
for that idea of home: people forced out of their homes, people looking 
for their homes, people trying to build their homes, people looking for 
shelter, for comfort, for tenderness, a little bit of kindness 
somewhere."<br>
<br>
Springsteen doesn't vary the show much from night to night, because he 
feels it is "focused and specific." At its heart are echoes of the 
struggle that he went through when he began to live out the rock &amp; 
roll dream that had driven him since he was a high schooler growing up 
near the Jersey shore. "I guess you get to a place where your old 
answers and your old dreams don't really work anymore," he says, "so you
 have to step into something new. For me, there was that particular 
moment when I had to put my old dreams down, because I had grown beyond 
them. I suppose I had a particular time when I felt pretty empty."<br>
<br>
For Springsteen, that time came after the break-through success of the 
two-record set The River, when he recorded the stark, haunted folk songs
 that made up his 1982 album Nebraska. "I suppose that's where some of 
that record came from," he says. "I took a little trip across the 
country, 'cause I felt very isolated." He pauses. "So you start taking 
those steps outward. That's where you gotta go. And you reach a point 
where there's a person who says, 'I can show you these other things, but
 you have to trust me.' "<br>
<br>
That person was Julianne Phillips, an actress-model he met in 1984 in 
Los Angeles and married the following May. The songs that followed, the 
songs that make up Tunnel of Love, focus on the perils of adult romance 
and commitment. "I wanted to write a different kind of romantic song, 
one that took in the different types of emotional experiences of any 
relationship where you are really engaging with that other person and 
not involved in a narcissistic romantic fantasy or intoxication or 
whatever.<br>
<br>
"In my life previously, I hadn't allowed myself to get into a situation 
where I would even have cause to reflect on these things. When I was in 
my twenties, I was specifically avoiding it." He laughs. "It was like 'I
 got enough on my hands, I ain't ready for that, I don't write no 
marryin' songs.' But when this particular record came around, I wanted 
to make a record about what I felt, about really letting another person 
in your life and trying to be a part of someone else's life. That's a 
frightening thing, something that's always filled with shadows and 
doubts and also wonderful things and beautiful things."<br>
<br>
He laughs again. "It's difficult, because there's a part of you that 
wants the stability and the home thing, and there's a part of you that 
isn't so sure. That was the idea of the record, and I had to change 
quite a bit to just get to the point to write about that stuff. I 
couldn't have written any of those songs at any other point in my 
career. I wouldn't have had the knowledge or the insight or the 
experience to do it."<br>
<br>
And does he think he's found the home he sings about onstage? "Sometimes
 I really do," he says quietly. "I don't believe that you find something
 and there it is and that's the end of the story. You have to find the 
strength to sustain it and build on it and work for it and constantly 
pour energy into it. I mean, there's days when you're real close and 
days when you're real far away. I guess I feel like I know a lot more 
about it than I ever did, but it's like anything else: you gotta write 
that new song every day."<br>
<br>
He grins. "I guess, gee, I've been married for three years, just about. And I feel like we just met."<br>
<br>
Right off the bat, the second set at the omni violates a given of any 
Bruce Springsteen concert: it starts not with a flat-out rocker but with
 a measured, emphatic version of the Tunnel of Love ballad "Tougher Than
 the Rest." It's followed by a thundering rendition of the 
thirteen-year-old "She's the One"; the original neo-rockabilly 
arrangement of "You Can Look (but You Better Not Touch)"; a rollicking 
overhaul of "I'm a Coward," an old Gino Washington number; a sinuous new
 reggae original, "Part Man, Part Monkey"; and the rockers "Dancing in 
the Dark" and "Light of Day." But it's "Walk Like a Man," full of 
telling autobiographical detail and plaintive yearning – "I pray for the
 strength to walk like a man," sings Springsteen, who worried about 
being too direct and personal when he wrote the song – that brings the 
set's tales of desire to a head.<br>
<br>
For an encore, Springsteen walks out with an acoustic guitar. "When I 
was sittin' at home, thinkin' about comin' out on tour and trying to 
decide what I was gonna do," he says, "I thought, 'Well, I gotta sing a 
new song.' That's my job. But this is an old song. I wrote this song 
when I was twenty-four years old, sitting on the end of my bed in Long 
Branch, New Jersey, and thinking, 'Here I come, world.' " A giggle. 
"When I wrote it, I guess I figured it was a song about a guy and a girl
 who wanted to run and keep on running."<br>
<br>
A huge cheer; the crowd knows what's coming. "But as I got older, and as
 I sang it over the years, it sort of opened up, and I guess I realized 
that it was about two people out searching for something better. 
Searching for a place they could stand and try and make a life for 
themselves. And I guess in the end they were searchin' for home, 
something that I guess everybody looks for all their lives. I've spent 
my life looking for it, I guess. Anyway, this song has kept me good 
company on my search. I hope it's kept you good company on your search."<br>
<br>
The acoustic version of "Born to Run" that follows is elegiac and 
antiromantic, the kind of haunting moment that wins Springsteen and his 
audience the right to celebrate. And they do – with "Hungry Heart" and 
"Glory Days" and finally with "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" and the 
"Detroit medley," Springsteen's customary encore of rock and R&amp;B 
standards, including "Devil with a Blue Dress."<br>
<br>
And as Springsteen gives this determinedly new show a very old ending, 
in the middle of a rock &amp; roll maelstrom in which he almost seems to
 turn his back on the hard lessons that preceded the celebration, he 
shouts out just how this stuff fits in. He introduces "Rosalita" as "the
 best love song I ever wrote!" And before the "Detroit medley," he 
shouts, "But that's not the end of the story. They got in their car, 
they drove down the road, they went into a little bar, there was a band 
there, the bandleader shouted, 'One, two, three, four! Devil with a blue
 dress ...' " Every love story, it seems, deserves a happy ending – and 
as a coda to this dark, dark ride, Bruce Springsteen is grinning like a 
fool and doing the boogaloo and writing his happy ending.<br>
<br>
There's a steinway baby grand in the living room and a guitar case by 
the couch, but the music in Bruce Springsteen's posh hotel suite comes 
from a small boom box blaring out a tape of Chicago blues. It's almost 
time for another sound check, and the remnants of Springsteen's most 
recent meal sit on his dining-room table: a box of Shredded Wheat, a 
cereal bowl in which uneaten strawberries sit in a small pool of milk. 
Twenty-five floors, one private elevator and a couple of receptionists 
and security guards away from the fens outside Atlanta's Ritz-Carlton, 
Springsteen sits in an armchair in blue jeans, a pin-striped white shirt
 and his silver-tipped cowboy boots, nursing a chocolate milkshake and 
talking about his career.<br>
<br>
To some, Tunnel of Love is a foolish move: an album of intimate ballads 
from a guy who broke things wide open with an album of rockers. The tour
 isn't the juggernaut its predecessor was, and the album has sold 
considerably less than Born in the U.S.A. – although Springsteen clearly
 prefers it to the earlier record, which he shrugs off as "a rock 
record." He says, "I never really felt like I quite got it, though 'Born
 in the U.S.A.' and 'My Hometown' made it feel more thematic than it 
probably was." Is the quintessential mainstream American rock hero now 
just another guy with an album in the Top Twenty and a tour in the local
 arenas?<br>
<br>
"I don't really have a desire to have some super big-selling record," he
 says. "I mean, I enjoyed Born in the U.S.A., and it did bring a new 
audience to me, some who will fall away and some who will stick around 
for the rest of the show. I don't consider Tunnel of Love a small 
record, but I suppose it doesn't reach out and grab you by the throat 
and thrash you around like Born in the U.S.A.<br>
<br>
"I wouldn't mind having another big record like that. But my main 
concern is writing that new song that has that new idea, that new 
perspective. To me, that is the essence of my job." He chuckles. "Also, 
you want to rock people. That's my job, too. So that makes you want to 
write a fast song."<br>
<br>
But for now, the most moving moment of his show may well be the fast 
song slowed down, the song about running that's become a song about 
home. "I wanted to separate 'Born to Run' from any way we've ever done 
the song before," Springsteen says. "I didn't want to crash into it like
 some old anthem or something, and I wanted to give people a chance to 
reexperience the song. And myself, too." He grins. "I guess in that song
 I asked every question I've been trying to answer since I was 
twenty-four. I was young, and those were the things I wanted to know. 
And fifteen years down the line, you understand much clearer what those 
things are, and what they cost, and their importance. And I suppose, 
when I play the song now, I would imagine that you get some sense of 
that.<br>
<br>
"I asked myself those questions at that age, and I really did 
faithfully, I feel, do everything I could to find some answers. The way 
you keep faith with your audience is not by signing autographs; it's by 
keeping faith with that initial search you set out on. I suppose this 
show is a – it's not a resolution by any means, but it is what I've 
learned and what I know."<br>
<br>
But can Bruce Springsteen, a multimillionaire rock star in his penthouse
 suite, remain close to his audience while his images have been 
appropriated by politicians and television commercials? After all, 
Springsteen may have added "Backstreets" to his set after a fan sent him
 a letter explaining how much the song meant to him and his friends – 
but when he tells that story, even Bruce is amazed that the fan managed 
to penetrate security and get the letter to his hotel room.<br>
<br>
"In some ways," he stammers, "there's not a lot of difference. I still 
go out, meet people. With the size of the thing, the way that you 
counteract that is by becoming more intimate in your work. I suppose 
that's why after I did Born in the U.S.A., I made this intimate record. I
 made a record that was really sort of addressed to my core audience, my
 longtime fans."<br>
<br>
He frowns. "The size is tricky, it's dangerous. You can become purely 
iconic, or you can become just a Rorschach test that people throw up 
their own impressions upon, which you always are to some degree any-way.
 With size, and the co-option of your images and attitudes – you know, 
you wake up and you're a car commercial or whatever. And the way I mink 
the artist deals with that is just reinvention. You've got to constantly
 reinvent, and it's a long trip, it's a long drive."<br>
<br>
If there was ever a point when his relationship with the audience would 
have changed, he adds, it would have been during the Born to Run furor 
of 1975 – the covers of Time and Newsweek, the move from clubs to 
theaters, the charges that he was a record-company hype – rather than 
the Born in the U.S.A. explosion of a decade later.<br>
<br>
"Obviously, the Born in the U.S.A. experience had its frightening 
moments," he says. "But I had a real solid sense of myself by the time I
 was thirty-five. When I was twenty-five, I thought that I would slip 
away.... Also, when I was twenty-five, I just worked all the time, 
because I had nothing else going. I think at this point in my life I've 
gotten to the place where I want a real life, which is something you've 
got to cut out for yourself. And I've been lucky: most of my fans, most 
of the people I meet wish you the best. Then you meet people that – your
 real life is an intrusion upon their fantasy, and they don't like 
that."<br>
<br>
He laughs uproariously. "But, hey, that's not my problem. So anyway, 
along the road I probably come in contact with fans a little less than I
 used to, but outside of the details of the thing, I think my basic 
feelings and attitudes toward my audience haven't really changed. I 
guess I still feel like one of them, basically."<br>
<br>
And this, it seems, is why the new Bruce Springsteen still pulls out 
those warhorses at the end of the night, the reason the guy who refuses 
to do "Badlands" and "Thunder Road" and "Jungleland" winds up every show
 with "Rosalita" and half an hour of the "Detroit medley."<br>
<br>
"That's the trick of the show," he says. "The most important song, 
really, is 'Devil with a Blue Dress.' " He laughs heartily, savoring the
 seeming silliness of that idea. "Because the show really builds up to 
the moment when the houselights come up. The lights come up, and the 
stage slips back into the crowd, and the audience comes forth, and that 
is the event. You would think the end of the show is about excitement, 
but it's really not. It's about emotion. Because that's when people are 
the most visible, when they're the most vulnerable, the freest.<br>
<br>
"That's when things sit in a certain perspective. You can look up, way 
up, and you see some guy, and he waves to you, and you wave back – and 
in a funny kind of way, you know, that's the idea of the whole night And
 the thing that keeps it from being just an aerobic exercise is the rest
 of the show, which resonates underneath that and gives those songs, 
which appear to be kind of thrown off, emotional meaning and emotional 
life.<br>
<br>
"And in a funny way, with all the stuff I sing about for the whole rest 
of the night, I'm not sure I say anything that's more important than 
that particular moment."<br>

<strong class="text-strong">Looking for the light in the darkness of September 11th, Springsteen takes to the rock &amp; roll pulpit on 'The Rising'<br>
<br>
by: Mark Binelli</strong><br>
<br>
There's a sign on the road leading to Bruce Springsteen's place that 
reads DISCHARGE OF FIREARMS PROHIBITED. Springsteen lives on a 400-acre 
farm in Monmouth County, New Jersey, about an hour outside Manhattan, 
with his wife, Patti Scialfa, who sings backup in the E Street Band, and
 their three children, Evan, 13, Jessica, 11, and Sam, 8. The farm's 
previous owner, a painter, cherished the lush landscape and kept 
developers at bay. Then, for a time, there was talk of turning the 
property into a golf course, before Springsteen purchased it, eight 
years ago. "We got lucky," he says, standing in a field and surveying 
his land. "I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be."<br>
<br>
Springsteen walks with a slight limp — years of jumping around arena 
stages having taken their toll — but he wears it well, or at least his 
persona does, the cowboyish swagger bringing to mind a character out of 
one of the John Ford westerns he loves. Otherwise, at fifty-two, he 
looks remarkably fit. His arms, especially, bring a formidable heft. 
Today, he's sporting clothes that nudge slightly closer to the trendy — 
or at least trendy for someone normally photographed in denim and 
flannel. There are gray pants and a jacket, both by G-Star, scuffed 
black boots and an orange mesh tank top. He wears a silver wedding band 
and thin hoop earrings in both ears — three on the left — and a generous
 amount of stubble, slightly more mustache than beard. His face is 
tanned and ruddy; his hair is thinning, but only his sideburns hint at 
gray. A large cross hangs from a silver chain around his neck, three 
tiny silver hearts dangling from the cross's arms and base. Springsteen 
isn't sure about the tank top, only because he's going to be 
photographed later in the afternoon. "I've never been photographed in 
orange before," he says. "I'm so boring. I don't want to blow the 
sartorial boringness I've cultivated over the years."<br>
<br>
It's a beautiful day and Springsteen is in high spirits. Would we like 
to hear a joke? Of course. ("Why do most men name their private parts? 
Because they don't want a stranger making ninety percent of their 
decisions.") His favorite new rapper is Ludacris. He enjoys watching E 
Street Band guitarist Steve Van Zandt mug as wiseguy Silvio Dante on The
 Sopranos, though he misses Big Pussy (who, incidentally, once joined 
Springsteen onstage. Springsteen says he had a pretty good voice).<br>
<br>
A loud, unpleasant mewling erupts nearby. "We've got peacocks," 
Springsteen says, nodding at a nearby hutch. "They're great watch 
animals. They'll sit on top of the house, and if anyone comes within 
fifty feet, they'll squawk." Springsteen also keeps horses; he recalls 
one of his first, which his family named He Who Is Afraid of Small 
Things because the horse would throw Springsteen whenever a squirrel or 
rabbit crossed his path.<br>
<br>
In recent months, Springsteen's most time-consuming pastoral endeavor 
has involved making his farm organic. As he explains, it's a five-year 
process, during which inspectors regularly test the soil for chemicals. 
For now, Springsteen is growing nothing but a ground cover of reedy 
wildflowers, which will eventually be plowed back into the earth as part
 of the nonorganic purging.<br>
<br>
And so goes the life of Bruce Springsteen, five decades on. He keeps an 
eye on the homestead. Takes his kids down to the Jersey shore. Goes for 
rides in his vintage blue Corvette. Gets pissed off reading the paper — 
most recently over the stories of corporate malfeasance and the current 
administration's laissez-faire attitude.<br>
<br>
Most important, Springsteen is making rock music again — and it has been
 a while. His last studio album, 1995's The Ghost of Tom Joad, won a 
Grammy for best contemporary folk album. The new album, The Rising, is 
not Springsteen as lone troubadour, but Springsteen reunited, finally 
and completely, with the E Street Band. The group had reformed pre-Tom 
Joad to record three new tracks for a 1995 greatest-hits album, and it 
embarked on a triumphant comeback tour four years later, but The Rising 
is its first full album since 1984's Born in the U.S.A.<br>
Equally significant, The Rising is the first Springsteen album ever to 
be produced by an outsider. Springsteen's camp over the years has been 
one of the most tightly knit in the rock world. Beginning with his first
 album, 1973's Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J., Springsteen has had a 
hand in producing every one of his albums. His only production 
collaborators have been people very close to him, such as his manager, 
Jon Landau, Van Zandt and Chuck Plotkin. They are notorious 
perfectionists. The time it takes them to make an album can be epic, up 
to three years; just as epic are the conversations between Springsteen 
and Landau about the nuances of a single take. But for The Rising, 
Springsteen handed the reins to Atlanta producer Brendan O'Brien, whose 
credits include albums by Pearl Jam and Rage Against the Machine. The 
new record was finished in seven and a half weeks.<br>
<br>
The Rising is largely Springsteen's response to the tragedy of September
 11th. And though it has its stark moments — the most devastating song 
on the album is, in fact, the solo Springsteen track "Paradise" — The 
Rising is as expansive and uplifting as Springsteen's best work with the
 E Street Band, accentuating in particular the band's gospel roots. 
Rather than whisper over an acoustic guitar, Springsteen takes us to the
 river and wonders if somebody can say amen. The title song, and first 
single, sums up the feel of many of the album's fourteen other tracks. 
It ostensibly unfolds from the point of view of a New York firefighter 
entering one of the burning towers. Yet, as on many songs on The Rising,
 Springsteen takes an unexpected turn, lyrically and musically, moving 
from a dark opening verse — "Can't see nothin' in front of me/Can't see 
nothin' coming up behind" — into a hand-clapping, sanctified chorus, as 
the literal image of a man rising up a smoke-filled stairwell merges 
into a religious image of ascension.<br>
<br>
Like the album as a whole, the song uses the events of September 11th as
 a metaphorical springboard. Images of rising — rising smoke, rising 
spirits, rising waters, even (yes) rising of a sexual sort — recur in 
several songs, serving as a formidable counterpoint to that other image,
 etched into our collective consciousness, replayed endlessly on every 
network, of falling, of collapse.<br>
<br>
Springsteen acknowledges the album's gospel element, and as further 
evidence points to "Into the Fire," which happens to be the first song 
he wrote after September 11th — he began working on it a few days after 
the attack. It covers ground similar to the title track, and also 
features a chorus that doubles as a prayer: "May your strength give us 
strength/May your hope give us hope. . . ."<br>
<br>
"When we got that song down," Springsteen says, "it brought the whole 
thing home immediately, because what you get on that song, the first 
verse is the blues." He begins to sing. His voice is soft and husky, 
with the same country twang he has on the recorded version: "The sky was
 falling and streaked with blood/I heard you calling me." He explains, 
"That's country blues. I'm doubling my voice around a twelve-string 
guitar, so when you hear the beginning of that thing, you hear a spirit 
out of the past. Mandolins. Appalachian fiddles." He sings again: "Then 
you disappeared into the dust, up the stairs. . . .<br>
<br>
"Then," Springsteen continues, "when the chorus hits, that's the gospel.
 The pump organ comes in. That's where the thing lifts and makes sense 
of the first verse and, hopefully, tries to make sense of the experience
 itself. And my best songs have done both of those things, blues and 
gospel. That's what my band, and my writing with the band, has always 
been about. On an album like Nebraska, you can hear the blues thing, but
 the band is more like Sunday church. We're gonna shout that thing to 
you, right into your face, and try to get you to stand up. And there 
were the essential elements of what I do with the band, in the first 
thirty seconds or so of recording this album. When the drums hit on 
'Into the Fire,' it comes down, and the whole thing just grounds itself 
into the earth and starts fightin', you know? The gospel and the blues."
 Springsteen looses one of his hoarse, full-body laughs. "That's where 
the fight starts. And that's all we do, as a band. That's all that we're
 built for. That's the service we provide."<br>
<br>
In 1982, in a house about ten minutes from his farm, Springsteen 
recorded his album Nebraska, an acoustic collection of murder ballads 
and conjured ghosts that, to this day, sounds haunted and somehow 
timeless — an album-length equivalent of Elvis' version of "Blue Moon" 
or Hank Williams' "I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive." Springsteen,
 of course, followed up Nebraska with Born in the U.S.A., which changed 
everything. As anthemic and arena-friendly as its predecessor had been 
spooky and insular, the album sold more than 10 million copies, spawning
 seven hit singles and placing Springsteen atop the pantheon of Eighties
 pop stars, representing for the blue-collar rock fan alongside the 
likes of Michael Jackson and Madonna. "I was always unsatisfied with 
that album," Springsteen says today. "That was one I really struggled 
with and never felt like I got the whole thing right. But your own 
wrestling in that department doesn't really have anything to do with the
 way something is received, or the way your fans hear it."<br>
Despite, or perhaps because of, the Born in the U.S.A. juggernaut, 
Springsteen had come to seem less and less mass-culturally relevant. 
With the ascendance of alternative rock and hip-hop, something about 
Springsteen felt decidedly Reagan-era. And he himself began to pull away
 from the spotlight. He broke up the E Street Band in 1990. The rock 
albums that followed (Lucky Town and Human Touch, released in 1992) 
didn't garner the notice, critical or commercial, of previous efforts. 
By 1995, Springsteen had grown a mustache and released Tom Joad, a solo 
album in the key of Nebraska that took up the causes of migrant workers 
and other dispossessed characters. It was as if, to atone for 
inadvertently providing the soundtrack to the Reagan revolution, 
Springsteen turned his back on rock radio and pulled a sort of reverse 
Dylan, unplugging his guitar and morphing into a 
folk-singer-slash-activist.<br>
<br>
It was around this time, Springsteen admits, that he wasn't sure if he'd lost what he calls his "rock voice."<br>
<br>
We're sitting in the living room of a rambling colonial house, where he 
writes and occasionally records. (Some people have a workroom, but if 
you are Bruce Springsteen, you have a whole house to work in. The family
 living quarters are elsewhere on the farm.) On the coffee table between
 us, there are a stack of books (Dorothea Lange's Ireland, a book of 
rock photos by Danny Clinch), a vase of freshly cut sunflowers and a 
ceramic grinning cowboy. Otherwise, the room is decorated with tasteful 
antique Americana. Springsteen sits in an uncomfortable-looking wooden 
chair — legs spread, heels together, arms in throne position. He laughs 
loudly and often, though when speaking he rarely makes eye contact, 
instead gazing off into near-distant space as his words form.<br>
<br>
Springsteen felt that he began to recover his rock voice during band 
rehearsals in Asbury Park, when he wrote a new song, "Land of Hope and 
Dreams." "It was our last few days there," he recalls, "and having the 
band around just felt right. I think differently when I'm with them; I 
write differently. We're a social unit that worked, you know? Imagine 
seven, eight, nine people you went to high school with; imagine, you 
know, you're fifty-two and that's the exact same group of people you're 
working with. That's very, very unusual. I never would have written a 
song like 'Land of Hope and Dreams' for the Tom Joad record. I never 
would have used that title. I would've thought it was too broad, that it
 was a cliché. But with the band, it — it is a big title, but what we're
 gonna do with that, I think we can fill that song up, with this group 
of people, in this circumstance."<br>
<br>
"Land of Hope and Dreams" and another song, "American Skin (41 Shots)" —
 the latter inspired by the shooting of unarmed African immigrant Amadou
 Diallo by New York police officers — made it into the tour and the live
 album that followed. At that point, Springsteen knew he wanted to make 
an album with the band. But the context of the project changed again 
after September 11th. In the hours and days that followed the attacks, 
Springsteen, like many Americans, was glued to his television set. That 
first day, he took a drive over a nearby bridge where, dead center, 
there had been a perfect view of the Twin Towers. His kids wanted to 
know if a plane could crash into their school. He took his family to 
church, which he otherwise rarely attends. "We were in there with the 
rest of the wanna-be's, and it was jammed," he says. "But I found that 
to be very valuable. People just wanted to be with other people who were
 addressing issues of faith and hope and love."<br>
<br>
Springsteen can't recall listening to much music in the aftermath — 
though, as is often the case in his life, he took refuge in his own. 
"Yeah, I picked up a guitar," he says. "That's my life preserver. I 
mean, when I go into a strange hotel room, to this day, I'll take the 
guitar out of the case first thing and I'll play for five or ten 
minutes. Then the place feels like mine. So, yeah. Right to the guitar."<br>
<br>
The task at hand became more focused when Springsteen was asked to open a
 telethon held ten days later to raise money for the September 11th 
Fund. He quickly wrote two songs, "Into the Fire" and "You're Missing," 
but neither felt finished enough to perform — so instead, Jon Landau, 
Springsteen's longtime manager and one of his closest friends, suggested
 he do "My City of Ruins," a song he'd written a year earlier and 
performed at a Christmas concert. Springsteen calls it "a sort of 
prayer" for his adopted hometown of Asbury Park, which has gone through a
 long period of economic hardship. The opening lines go like this: 
"There's a blood-red circle on the cold, dark ground/And the rain is 
falling down/The church door's thrown open, I can hear the organ's 
song/But the congregation's gone."<br>
<br>
"After that performance," Springsteen says, "when I sat down to write a 
song, whatever I wrote was in that emotional context. The music has to 
be physical, and there has to be a good deal of light to it. And I have 
to find that light truthfully. Which is through the darkness, you know?"<br>
<br>
It came as a surprise, then, that one of Springsteen's guides through 
the darkness turned out to be an outsider, Brendan O'Brien. A few years 
earlier, he had expressed interest in working with Springsteen. By the 
time of The Rising, Springsteen felt restless and knew he needed a 
change. "The sounds of records change every five years or so," he says, 
"the technology, the amps they use. And my production ability, it just 
wasn't current enough."<br>
<br>
O'Brien came to New Jersey, where Springsteen played him a dozen or so 
new songs. They spent the rest of the afternoon crafting a demo of 
"You're Missing," a ballad built around a melody Springsteen worked up 
one night while messing around on the piano with Patti and the kids.<br>
<br>
"At one point," Springsteen recalls, "Brendan said, 'Well, I think we 
should find another chord for this spot.' I said, 'Find another chord?! 
Wait a minute, now! Hold on, hold on!' " He laughs. " 'Those are the 
chords!' But then I'm thinking that my job now as the producee, is to 
say yes. So I said OK, we changed it, and it sounded good. Once I got 
comfortable with that, it was like, 'Go, man, go.' By the end of the 
day, we had a real nice demo."<br>
<br>
"The biggest difference with making this record," Steve Van Zandt says, 
"is that it's the first time that Bruce wrote a collection of songs, we 
went in and recorded them, and he put them out."<br>
<br>
Normally, Van Zandt says, Springsteen would "write a bunch of songs, 
we'd record them, then, you know, hang out for a bit. He'd write another
 bunch of songs, we'd record them. What would happen is, we'd always do 
two or three or four records before one finally came out. I produced 
fifteen songs or so for Born in the U.S.A. during the first three weeks.
 Then I left, and they kept working for two years! Then they ended up 
using twelve of the original fifteen, I think. So I don't ever remember a
 case where everything was done so quickly, and I think that's why this 
record, conceptually, thematically, is so coherent."<br>
<br>
"I remember when we first went down to Georgia to record, the first song
 we did was 'Into the Fire,' " Springsteen says. "We practiced it maybe 
three times, and then Brendan said, 'OK, come on in, let's do it.' And 
when he played us back that song, I heard something I hadn't heard 
before: I heard the way we sound right now. Today. And I said, 'Well, 
that's what we need to do.' If somebody has all our other records, I 
want to make sure they don't have this one. You can't replace this one 
with some of the other ones. And I think for guys that have made records
 for a long time, that's important."<br>
<br>
Although springsteen lived in Los Angeles for several years in the late 
Eighties and early Nineties, he has always seemed most comfortable on 
his native soil. Aside from farming, his ongoing local project has been 
the resurgence of Asbury Park, the coastal town where he lived in the 
early 1970s. He played some of his first shows at the now-legendary 
Stone Pony, and he's been involved in the slow economic revival of the 
city, playing benefit concerts and remaining an active presence on the 
scene. "He is the Number One cheerleader and supporter of Asbury Park," 
says Domenic Santana, who resurrected the Stone Pony. Springsteen to 
this day plays unannounced shows at the club: Santana says Bruce has the
 combination to the backyard lock and a standing invitation to walk in 
off the street and take the stage whenever he wants. "He's always been 
this city's insurance," Santana says. "That's how I persuaded my parents
 and grandparents to cash in all their 401(k)s, when the banks wouldn't 
touch Asbury Park. I'll never forget, my dad said to me, 'What the hell 
are you smoking?' when I first brought him here to Beirut-by-the-Shore. I
 said, 'You don't understand, there are so many rock &amp; roll memories
 here.' As we were speaking, a bus of Japanese tourists pulled up and 
started taking pictures of the Stone Pony. This abandoned building. My 
father turned to me and said, 'How much did you pay them?' "<br>
Still, on a recent tuesday afternoon, it's clear that Asbury Park needs 
considerable tending to. A half-mile swath of beach hosts — and this is a
 generous estimate — about thirty sunbathers. The closest, a homeless 
woman, absently fills the back of her shorts with sand. Shuttered motels
 line the main drag, along with a shuttered club called Moving 
Violations, and there's a billboard on the edge of town proclaiming 
GOD'S LIGHT OF LOVE IS STILL DESTROYING THE DARKNESS. Below, a smaller 
italic addendum reads, EVEN IN ASBURY PARK!<br>
<br>
And yet, there's a sort of magical feel to the place, thanks, perhaps, 
to the sheer amount of abandoned history. The boardwalk — its wood 
weathered gray — is bookended by grand old art-deco palaces. To the 
south, the long-empty casino sits like a dried-out bee's nest, with its 
shattered window facade and gutted interior. On the opposite end, the 
gorgeous Asbury Park Convention Hall remains dilapidated but functional.
 One of its functions in recent years has been as a rehearsal space for 
Springsteen and the E Street Band. This afternoon, the parking area 
houses the E Street fleet: a half-dozen SUVs, a couple of BMWs and 
Springsteen's Corvette.<br>
<br>
"I saw my first big concert here," notes Springsteen, who shows up for 
practice in jeans and a black T-shirt. A backpack stuffed with sheet 
music is slung over his shoulder. "It was the Who, Herman's Hermits and 
the Blues Magoos. The Blues Magoos opened, then it was the Who, and 
Herman's Hermits headlined! This was before people here really knew 
about the Who. Nobody knew they were going to smash their instruments. I
 must've been fifteen. I saw Janis Joplin here, and the Doors, too, 
their first time around. I sat right over there." He nods at a bank of 
empty seats, house left, before joining the band onstage. As he chats 
with Van Zandt, Patti Scialfa strolls up the ramp and tickles the back 
of his neck, then grabs her guitar.<br>
<br>
And then one of the tightest, most tireless bands of the past 
twenty-five years begins to work through a set. They start with "The 
Rising." Live, the new songs sound huge and untethered. You immediately 
notice the amount of control on the record, and also, as the songs begin
 to accumulate, the number of recurring images. There is, of course, 
smoke, fire, darkness, all of which possess certain mythic qualities. 
But other words recur as well. Touch. Skin. Hugs. Kisses. The best 
gospel songs are often only a word or two away from being great love 
songs — many times quite dirty love songs — all you have to do is 
replace the word Lord with my baby. Likewise, Springsteen's songs on The
 Rising are suggestive. The opening track, "Lonesome Day," works 
perfectly well, for instance, as a breakup song.<br>
<br>
The setting couldn't be more unfrilled: The house lights are up, with 
the rope ladders and ribbed underbelly of the stage clearly visible. The
 house itself remains empty except for a handful of techs, a camera crew
 and someone's Dalmatian, which has been padding around the main floor. 
Still, the band tears into the songs with a thrilled abandon. During the
 audience-participation section of "Waitin' on a Sunny Day," Springsteen
 stops singing and holds his microphone out to the empty house, while 
saxophonist Clarence Clemons coaxes invisible audience members to stand.
 "How ya doin' out there?" Springsteen asks with a smirk, then points 
his mike again. Later, during "Tenth Avenue Freeze Out," a classic song 
about an overweening desire to make it, he grins broadly and shimmies 
across the stage.<br>
<br>
After two hours, the band retires to a backroom for dinner. Drummer Max 
Weinberg, on hiatus from his day job as Conan O'Brien's bandleader, is 
sitting at the end of a long table with a red-and-white checkered cloth,
 talking up a tension-relieving pillow he's just ordered from the 
Sharper Image catalog. Springsteen ambles over with a bowl of salad and 
grilled fish, shaking his head as he overhears this last bit. "These are
 the topics of conversation backstage now," he says with a sigh. 
"Swedish pillows."<br>
<br>
"They're great pillows," Weinberg insists. "I'll turn you on to them."<br>
<br>
Scialfa, a willowy redhead who is wearing a black tank top and pants and
 is working on a bowl of mussels, mentions that she, too, saw the Doors 
in this very building, at the same show as her husband, though they 
didn't know each other then. "I just wanted to be Jim Morrison," she 
says.<br>
<br>
"I saw Jefferson Airplane here," Weinberg says. "Procul Harum."<br>
<br>
"I saw that show!" Springsteen exclaims happily.<br>
<br>
"I was there, too," Scialfa says.<br>
<br>
"I remember a Hullabaloo Club concert here," Springsteen says. "It was 
the first black light I'd ever seen. I walked in and couldn't figure out
 what happened to my shirt!" A few minutes later, he continues, without 
much of a segue, "You know, my kids used to burst into tears when they 
saw Steve Van Zandt."<br>
<br>
Scialfa snorts out a laugh. "You couldn't wait to introduce that!" she 
says. "They were babies." She shrugs. "And he looked like a pirate." 
Springsteen and Scialfa have never been on the road without their kids. 
"This tour," she says, "they begged, wept, 'Please don't make us go!' It
 is isolating. Plus, who wants to watch their parents?"<br>
<br>
Soon, it is time to return to the stage. The most powerful moment comes a
 few songs in, when Springsteen sits at the piano to perform "My City of
 Ruins," while the band looks on silently. He sings, "Now there's tears 
on the pillow, darlin', where we slept/And you took my heart when you 
left/Without your sweet kiss, my soul is lost, my friend/Tell me, how do
 I begin again?"<br>
<br>
Springsteen still remembers the moment he realized that he needed to 
make this album. It was a few days after September 11th, and he was 
leaving the beach. A man drove by, rolled his window down and yelled, 
"We need ya!" Then he rolled his window up and kept going. "And I 
thought, 'Well, I've probably been a part of this guy's life for a 
while,' " Springsteen says. "And people wanna see other people they 
know, they wanna be around things they're familiar with. So he may need 
to see me right about now. That made me sense, like, 'Oh, I have a job 
to do.' Our band, hopefully, we were built to be there when the chips 
are down. That was part of the idea of the band, to provide support. The
 most fundamental thing I hear from fans, constantly, is, 'Man, you got 
me through' — whatever it might be. 'My divorce. My graduation. My high 
school. This part of my life, that part.' " Bruce Springsteen chuckles 
once more. "And I usually wanna say back, 'Well, you know, you guys got 
me through quite a bit yourselves!' " Then he laughs again, this time 
much louder.<br>

<br>
The iconic songwriter on making his most romantic record since 'Born to 
Run' - and why a hundred George Bushes can't destroy the American spirit<br>
<br>
by: Joe Levy</strong><br>
<br>
This afternoon, Bruce Springsteeen has a lot on his mind. There is the 
matter of band rehearsals and the thirty-seven-date world tour that he 
will soon start. There is the new album he has made, Magic, his third 
release in the past eighteen months. There is also the subject matter of
 that album, weighty stuff like the direction of our democracy and party
 stuff that recalls the days when sparks first flew on E Street more 
than three decades ago. And there is something else as well: His oldest 
son's soccer game starts at 4:30.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's life at fifty-eight revolves around family and music. It 
was not always tin is way. For a long time, there was only the music. 
And then, for a while, only the family. The balance he's achieved – and 
the creative roll he's been on, four albums in the past five years – is 
relatively, recent. "I spent about ten years where I had no destination,
 exactly," he says, referring to the time during which he moved to Los 
Angeles, settled into his second marriage and began a family. He and 
wife Patti Scialfa have three children, Evan, 17, Jessica, 16, and Sam, 
13.<br>
<br>
The ten years Springsteen mentions roughly line up with the period 
during which the E Street Band was idle, from 1988 to 1999. During that 
time, Springsteen redefined his career and his music more radically than
 any major artist save Bob Dylan, the eternal trickster. Having reached 
the level of mass success that his music and ambition always demanded, 
Springsteen pulled back. His subject matter went first inward and then 
outward. The most personal albums he ever made – Lucky Town and Human 
Touch – were, as he's pointed out, his happiest and least successful. In
 1995, The Ghost of Tom Joad, a literary album with a political bent – 
Raymond Carver meets Woody Guthrie – followed the birth of his youngest 
child. He had gone, in seven years, from stadiums to arenas to theaters,
 a man alone with an acoustic guitar.<br>
<br>
In 1999, a few months shy of his fiftieth birthday, Springsteen went on 
tour with the E Street Band for the first time in more than a decade. As
 it always had, the band put flesh and muscle behind the words, 
reconnecting Springsteen to the rock and soul that had first been the 
wellspring of his music. This is clear when I watch the band rehearse 
for its current tour at Convention Hall in Asbury Park, New Jersey – an 
arena band gathering in a room the size of a high school gymnasium to 
stretch out before a long run. In that familiar voice full of gravel, 
Springsteen traces Sam Cooke-style melodic runs in the air.<br>
<br>
Magic returns to the spirit of Asbury Park with a big sound Springsteen 
hasn't pursued since Born to Run. "Lately, I've had a little romance 
with my oldest stuff," he says. "There was a lot of freeness in it. When
 you start and when you finish – that's when the pressure is off. In the
 beginning, you're too unknown, you're not really competing with people.
 And at this point, I'm not competing with 50 Cent or trying to get on 
MTV. I'm playing for myself and my band and my audience."<br>
<br>
As he explains when we sit down to talk backstage at Convention Hall, 
Magic uses the boardwalk sounds of the past to put across the feeling of
 the present: "the uneasiness of these very uneasy times." Often when he
 speaks, Springsteen laughs midsentence, as if he's embarrassed to be 
taking himself this seriously. But not when he talks about the course 
the country has taken under George W. Bush or the war in Iraq. Then the 
laughter stops.<br>
<br>
The record starts with "Radio Nowhere," a song about a guy out on the road looking for a connection.<br>
It's an end-of-the-world scenario – he's seeing the apocalypse. All 
communications are down: "Trying to find my way home/All I heard was a 
drone bouncing  – trying to connect to you. It comes down to trying to 
make people happy, feel less lonely, but also being a conduit for a 
dialogue about the events of the day, the issues that impact people's 
lives, personal and social and political and religious. That's how I 
always saw the job of our band. That was my service. At this point, I'm 
in the middle of a very long conversation with my audience.<br>
<br>
And what are you hearing from their side of the conversation?<br>
A lot of different things. "I like the old Bruce better.…" [Laughs] It's
 an ongoing dialogue about what living means. It's not like a one-on-one
 dialogue. It's more what you feel back from them. You create a space 
together. You are involved in an act of the imagination together, 
imagining the life you want to live, the kind of country you want to 
live in, the kind of place you want to leave to your children. What are 
the things that bring you ecstasy and bliss, what are the things that 
bring on the darkness, and what can we do together to combat those 
things? That's the dialogue I have in my imagination when I'm writing. I
 have it in front of me when I'm performing.<br>
<br>
It's an organic, living thing. There's something subtly different being 
said on a nightly basis. But you're attempting to define and have impact
 upon the world and the life you're living. I can't do it by myself. I 
need my audience. It'll be a lifelong journey by the time that I'm done.<br>
This kind of dialogue requires a heavy commitment. What do you get out of it?<br>
I enjoy it, but more than that, I need it. It's the fundamental thing 
that moves me out on the stage, that keeps me writing throughout my 
entire career. I've felt the absence of that dialogue in the past in my 
life, and it was a terrible emptiness. When I latched onto it, I latched
 onto it like a life raft. You're in that room together, that dark room 
together. The lights go down, and you are free to imagine the person, 
the place, that you want to be. I suppose you take some of that with you
 when you go. It stays with you.<br>
<br>
I remember the birth of my children. It was so overwhelming, one of the 
few moments where I've experienced total love without fear. I was afraid
 of losing it afterward, except you never lose it. The memory of that 
moment and the possibilities inherent in that moment are everlasting. So
 on a good night, when the band's playing real well, there's a moment 
when you've been a part of a collective event of imagination, and when 
you leave, you take some of it with you. And you put it in action 
however befits your needs.<br>
<br>
That collective act of the imagination comes up on "Magic." What kind of country we want to live in is a recurring theme.<br>
The song "Magic" is about living in a time when anything that is true 
can be made to seem like a lie, and anything that is a lie can be made 
to seem true. There are people that have taken that as their credo. The 
classic quote was from one of the Bushies in The New York Times: "We 
make our own reality. You guys report it, we make it." I may loathe that
 statement – the unbelievable stupidity and arrogance of it – more than I
 loathe "Bring it on" and "Mission accomplished."<br>
<br>
That song, it's all about illusion: "Trust none of what you hear/And 
less of what you'll see/This is what will be" – we make it. Until you 
get to the last verse: "There's a fire down below/It's coming up here.… 
There's bodies hanging in the trees/This is what will be." That's the 
heart of my record right there.<br>
<br>
There's a line at the end of that song about carrying "only what you fear." You're addressing the politics of fear, aren't you?<br>
Yeah. You can't kill your way to security, and you can't lead through 
scaring people. Maybe you can get people to vote for you sometimes, but 
it's not a tactic that's going to provide the kind of moral authority 
and leadership that it's going to take to communicate in the world. It's
 the coward's way out.<br>
<br>
So you're saying you can win elections that way, but you can't govern that way.<br>
That's right. That's the only card that they've played, pretty much from
 Day One. If the 2004 election had been held six months later, they 
would have lost. People were still under the spell of 9/11 and the magic
 [laughs] and the Swift Boating. One of the most satisfying moments of 
the election was Ted Koppel ripping the Swift Boaters a new asshole on 
Nightline about a week or so before the election, when they went to the 
village in Vietnam where the incident occurred and talked to the 
Vietnamese witnesses. It was right there, but it wasn't enough, and it 
was too late.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is if you're a member of the press and you believe that 
part of your responsibility is to give people the information they need 
to protect their freedoms, there's an editorial responsibility. But that
 ball's been dropped terribly. When somebody's saying you're going to 
lead with Anna Nicole Smith, you've got to be wondering if you're in the
 right job. It's become a business, and on what's supposed to be the 
most credible channels, there's an endless parade of nonsense on a daily
 basis.<br>
<br>
Right. Because during the election to get the truth behind the Swift 
Boat ads, you had to skip the mainstream media and go straight to The 
Daily Show.<br>
Jon Stewart is such an important and lonely force on television. He's in
 the business of assisting people to interpret the modern media world. 
There's so much sheer noise. Every night he comes on and pulls the veil 
down, and you get a shot at what things really look like. That's why 
people have gravitated to him and have faith in him.<br>
There's a line from "Long Walk Home" on the new album that has 
tremendous power. A father tells his son that the flag flying above the 
courthouse means "certain things are set in stone . . . what we'll do 
and what we won't." But we live in a moment where those things aren't 
set in stone.<br>
No, because those things have been chipped away at horrendously. Who 
would have ever thought we'd live in a country with no right to habeas 
corpus? That's Orwellian. That's what political hysteria is about and 
how effective it is. I felt it in myself. You get frightened for your 
family, for your home. And you realize how countries can move way off 
course, very far from democratic ideals. Add another terrorist attack or
 two, and the country can turn into a pretty scary place. Philip Roth 
caught it in The Plot Against America: It happens in a very American way
 – the flag is flying over civil liberties as they crumble. It was a 
fascinating insight.<br>
<br>
You mentioned Philip Roth. Are there other things you were reading that had an impact on the record?<br>
Not really. I'd been influenced a lot in the past through books and 
films, but I would say on this record I got re-infatuated with pop 
music. Pete Seeger says, "I want to know, 'What's the song for? What's 
the job it's supposed to do?' " I carry a little bit of that with me, 
but I'm a pop kid. I grew up on Top Forty. Sometimes what the song is 
for is just the way it makes you feel. On this record, I wanted a lot of
 that. There's some classic Sixties pop forms. California-rock 
influences – Pet Sounds and a lot of Byrds. I wanted to take the 
productions that create the perfect pop universes and then subvert them 
with the lyrics – fill them with the hollowness and the fear, the 
uneasiness of these very uneasy times.<br>
<br>
"Girls in Their Summer Clothes" is a crooning Sixties ballad, but it 
creates an ideal picture that stands in juxtaposition to what's running 
through the inside of this record. There's a diner on two songs, and 
they're very different. There's the one in "Girls in Their Summer 
Clothes" – Frankie's Diner, on the edge of town, with neon signs – and 
then there's the diner with the sign that just says gone [on "Long Walk 
Home"]. I believe in them both. Those are the parameters of what I'm 
talking about, right there.<br>
<br>
"Girls in Their Summer Clothes" is one of several songs that seem to call back to your earlier work.<br>
It's straight-out big. I don't think I've written as romantically as I 
allowed myself to do on that song maybe since Born to Run. This record, I
 felt free to go back to the romanticism of my earliest records. I 
doubled my voice, I sang in a bigger voice. I'm actually looking forward
 to writing a little bit more in that style, to picking up some of those
 elements that I discarded because I wanted to make sure that the music 
was tough enough for the subjects I was interested in dealing with. 
That's what I did with Darkness on the Edge of Town and Nebraska and 
parts of The River. But now, I feel free enough to go back and reclaim 
those lovely elements of pop simplicity and the well-crafted 
three-and-a-half-minute song, which I love to do.<br>
<br>
Did working on the thirtieth-anniversary edition of "Born to Run" open that up?<br>
I forgot how good that record was. I hadn't listened to it in many, many
 years. Born to Run was criticized as being too romantic. I was in that 
part of my career where I was reacting. Once you gain some attention, 
you're reacting to . . . maybe it's success, or something you overheard 
passing down the street. And so I moved toward darkness. But part of the
 things I was frightened of were the reasons why it lasted: because it 
was romantic.<br>
<br>
But even then, I filled the romanticism with darkness. It was a 
post-Vietnam record, and you can hear, once again, the uneasiness and 
the fear and the concern about the future. The classic line of "Thunder 
Road," which I wrote at twenty-four, was "We're not that young anymore."
 That came right out of the last years of the war. Nobody felt that 
young anymore. All that's in there. It has some of my greatest songs on 
it. I set out the parameters of the world I was going to be 
investigating.<br>
<br>
It's interesting – I didn't think about that, but I really wanted that. 
All the little different effects we had. I always loved those little pop
 symphonies, so on this record, I had a chance to play around with some 
of that. "Your Own Worst Enemy" was one of my big pop productions. The 
lyrics are "we're always teetering on the edge," and it's all about 
self-subversion. You can take it personally or politically. That's what 
gives the record its tension, those two things - the perfect pop 
universe and then what's at its center. "Living in the Future" has a 
very boardwalk sound, but it's about how terribly fucked up things have 
gotten. It's a song about apathy, and how what you never thought could 
happen has happened already. I tried to combine personal and political, 
so you can read into the songs either way. You can read the record as a 
comment on what's been going on, or you can read it just as relationship
 songs.<br>
<br>
It's effective. It has an allegorical power.<br>
Yeah. Despite the interview here, I didn't want a big Bush-bashing 
record. It's been done, and that's not really what people needed, or 
maybe it's just not what I needed right now. Your writing has to be 
multidimensional to remain interesting, to have life. You're not 
headline-writing. I've found ways to express my political concerns and 
personal concerns, and I always found them best combined, because that's
 how people live.<br>
I want to go back for a moment to "Radio Nowhere." There's an invocation
 of Elvis when the narrator is "searching for a mystery train." What's 
he looking for?<br>
What everybody's looking for. The ever-unattainable but absolutely there
 part of life that's slightly out of your fingertips, slightly shaded in
 the dark somewhere. But within, it contains all the essences and raw 
physical vitality and blood and bone and sweat of living. It's the thing
 that makes it all worth it at the end of the day, even if you just get 
the tip of your tongue on it. It's our history. It's that train that's 
been running since they friggin' landed over here on the boat, and it's 
roaring with all of us right now, that thing. That's what I like to look
 for.<br>
<br>
Your sense of American identity and American possibility - where does that come from?<br>
The people I liked did that. They were searchers – Hank Williams, Frank 
Sinatra, Elvis, James Brown. The people I loved – Woody Guthrie, Dylan –
 they were out on the frontier of the American imagination, and they 
were changing the course of history and our own ideas about who we were.
 And you can throw in Martin Luther King and Malcolm X.<br>
<br>
It was a part of what I was imagining from the very beginning, just 
because I got tremendous inspiration and a sense of place from the 
performers who had imagined it before me. It was something I wanted to 
take a swing at, what thrilled and excited me. For me, I started with 
what I had. I walked down to the boardwalk about a hundred yards from 
here, and I looked into a little knickknack shop. There was a rack of 
postcards, and I pulled one out that said GREETINGS FROM ASBURY PARK. I 
said, "That's my album cover. This is my place."<br>
<br>
My songs, they're all about the American identity and your own identity 
and the masks behind the masks behind the masks, both for the country 
and for yourself. And trying to hold onto what's worthwhile, what makes 
it a place that's special, because I still believe that it is.<br>
<br>
The American idea still has enormous power in its best manifestation. 
And ten George Bushes cannot bring that idea down – a hundred cannot 
bring that idea down. What we're going through now, we're going to be 
out the other side at some point. But that idea remains, and it's 
something that has compelled me my whole life. Part of it was to make 
sense of who I was – where I came from and what I saw and what I saw 
happen to some people around me.<br>
<br>
What does that mean?<br>
My family was troubled in a lot of ways. I came from . . . it was an 
interesting family. My mother is only second generation Italian. My 
grandmother lived to be 102 and never spoke any English. When I went 
into her room, I went to Italy. Everything: the Madonnas, the shawls. 
She lived in the country since she was in her twenties and never learned
 any English. So there was Italian culture, and then the Irish folks 
were just very old-school people.<br>
<br>
I had to sort some of that out. So identity became a big part of the 
music I was writing. And then because of the times when I grew up, the 
Sixties, our national identity was in tremendous flux. I got interested 
in "what's the social side of that equation?" That's really what all my 
stuff is ultimately about: "Is there anybody alive out there?" asked 
over and over again. "Long Walk Home" could have come off Darkness on 
the Edge of Town.<br>
<br>
You performed "Long Walk Home" during the Seeger Sessions tour. What's 
the difference between playing it with the Sessions band and the E 
Street Band?<br>
It was our opening night in London. You're very conscious of your 
American-ness when you're in Europe, particularly during these horrible 
times. I had the song, and we worked up a loose arrangement. That band 
was very easy to improvise with. Work something out at soundcheck and 
play it that night – we did that a lot. They were a great, great band. I
 felt like I've got two of the best bands in the world.<br>
<br>
I wrote most of this album on tour with the Sessions band. I wrote some 
of it the minute I came off The Rising. My idea was to pick up with the 
political and social results of what came out of the tragedy of 9/11. 
"Livin' in the Future" I've had since then, and I might have had "Radio 
Nowhere." I had a few things, but I didn't have enough. So I set it 
aside.<br>
<br>
When I toured with the Sessions band – you play and go home, you sit in a
 hotel room, and I'd pick up my guitar. That's where I do a lot of 
writing now. And then I write in my spare time when I'm at home. It 
doesn't take much time now. It's a very fluid process compared to what 
it used to be when I was young, when I insisted on beating the hell out 
of myself for as long and as hard as I could because I didn't have 
anything else better to do. Now that I've got three teenagers, my time 
is all called upon, so I write pretty much in my spare time.<br>
<br>
When you say you beat yourself up when you were younger, in what way?<br>
You think there's a right way, which is a fallacy when it comes to 
creating something. So you're in trouble there. And also, you have no 
life. So rather than going through the unpleasantness of your actual 
daily experience, you'd rather live in the unpleasantness of your 
creative experience. The hours I spent on . . . It was the only way I 
knew how to work. It was fun, but it was exhausting. I think 
intentionally exhausting. I made a lot of good music, but it all came 
out on Tracks. There's probably another Tracks sitting in the vault that
 I'll get to at some point.<br>
The creative roll you're on now is relatively recent, given the scope of
 your career. There was a period eight to ten years ago where you were 
still making records and putting them away.<br>
Yeah, I made one for "Streets of Philadelphia" that I didn't put out, 
which I'd like to. It was interesting, it had a lot of little loops and 
things. A good record, written pretty well. It wasn't a complete record 
in the end, which is why I would sit down and feel great for four or 
five songs and in the end get up with some sense of dissatisfaction.<br>
<br>
What were those songs about?<br>
Mostly personal relationships. I'd come off Tunnel of Love, and it would
 have been my fourth record about those things, and I thought that was 
one too many. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I had to break the 
narrative that I was in, break the context and move to L.A. for three or
 four years, get away from all things connected to myself.<br>
<br>
We went to Los Angeles, and the change of scenery was good. I love that 
city, actually. I love the mountains and the desert, and up there I can 
have my cars and my motorcycles. I tried to live in New York for a 
while, but I couldn't deal with a place where you had to catch a car. 
It's too late for me for that.<br>
<br>
So I moved out West, where I had a little house in the Hollywood Hills 
from the middle of the Eighties, and I felt real comfortable there. My 
sister lives there, my younger sister, my parents lived up north in San 
Francisco, and it was a fascinating time to be there, because it's what 
the East Coast looks like now. If you go to my hometown, in Freehold, 
there's tremendous Hispanic influence, and that was California fifteen 
years ago. So when I wrote The Ghost of Tom Joad and wrote a lot about 
what was going on, it felt like "This is what the country's going to 
look like in another ten or fifteen years." All those immigration issues
 that people are trying to ride right now to wherever they think they're
 going were all in the news and in your face in the early Nineties in 
California.<br>
<br>
I wrote things that I wouldn't have if I stayed back East. Two or three 
albums of Western songs. Ghost of Tom Joad, Devils &amp; Dust and 
another record of Western songs that I've been working on. So it was 
really a great geographical change, a place to find new stories.<br>
<br>
But I also took ten years and I learned how to live, which I didn't know
 how to do. Thirty-five years old, and I didn't have a clue about it. I 
learned how to live, and I found the joy in those things.<br>
<br>
What did you learn?<br>
I guess life outside of work. This is a very satisfying work life, but 
it's a part of your overall life. How do you have relationships? How do 
you commit to things that are forever? How do you break all your old 
habits, or some of them?<br>
<br>
If you can share some secrets, you can save me a lot of money in therapy.<br>
I spent a lot of money there myself, and I learned a lot. I had to work 
on it the way that I had to work on playing the guitar when I first 
started – many, many hours and a lot of intense devotion. I realized 
that some people may come to that naturally, but I was somebody that was
 going to have to learn it, because all my instincts were wrong. All my 
instincts drove me away from things.<br>
<br>
Sometimes you're running in a different direction because you don't know
 how to do things differently than what you've seen growing up.<br>
Yeah, that's it. So you realize you've got to make your own map, and in 
so doing, you honor your parents by taking the good things they gave you
 and carrying them forth, and taking burdens and weights and putting 
them down so your children don't have to run with them.<br>
<br>
But that break was really extreme for me, and Patti was, and has been, 
patient beyond patient. I couldn't get up in the morning, I couldn't go 
to bed at night. The basic things that set the clock. The kids were 
young – it was "It's six-thirty now." That took about four or five years
 to figure out.<br>
<br>
Was that from having to unlearn the rhythm on the road?<br>
It goes back to my childhood. I had a weird upbringing where I was up 
for all hours at night when I was, like, six years old. We had a very 
eccentric household. My clock got thrown off when I was really young. 
Five and six, I was up until 3 A.M. I'm sure it's no coincidence I ended
 up a musician, so I could be up to 3 A.M., just like I was.<br>
<br>
When your own kids come along, I said, "Good, you've got to change 
that." So many basic things. So I spent a lot of that time learning how 
to live. I suppose Patti would say I've reached a tolerable level of 
competency.<br>
What brought you back to New Jersey?<br>
I grew up around a very big extended family. I think Patti and I have 
maybe seventy family members, just in this area, and there's a lot of 
Italians and also an Irish side. At some point, when the children got to
 school age, we decided we wanted that for the kids. We were always here
 half the year anyway, even then. So when we came back, my kids grew up 
around my uncle that hunts, the one that owns the dry-cleaning business –
 people who do all different kinds of work and bring all kinds of things
 to them. It took away the weirdness of my job, and it allowed them to 
look other places for all different kinds of role models. That was 
important.<br>
<br>
Then we came back, and I re-found the freedom in some of my early 
narrative, and that includes here in this building and this town and in 
my band. I feel the freest I've ever felt in my life creatively. I feel 
like I've picked up a thread that I never let go of but just let sit for
 a while.<br>
<br>
And I feel like we're very on it right now. This is going to be the best
 E Street Band somebody's ever seen. You may have a favorite part of my 
work, you may have a favorite show, but if you're a young kid and your 
brother or your dad saw us, and you come and see us now, you can say, "I
 saw them when they were at their best." I like that. I like the fact 
that all my guys are out there and that they're all alive. I like that a
 lot. It could have gone many other ways. There were struggles, the same
 type of troubles that many other bands have, but people took care of 
one another, and everybody's there. I can't tell you the joy of standing
 next to those same people.<br>
<br>
Some of whom have been with you for more than three decades.<br>
I met Steve [Van Zandt] when I was sixteen. Now I'm fifty-eight. So 
that's more than forty years. It's an amazing thing to be up there with 
your best friends and your wife. Your whole world's up there. I think 
for a lot of our fans, part of the thing is when the world's falling 
apart, we're not. That's why people come to us. There was always a sense
 of stability and continuity and connection.<br>
<br>
It sounds like something you've been able to provide for both your families – your family onstage and your kids.<br>
You've got to have the whole picture at this point. You need the 
fullness of life. Without that, it's an exercise. You don't want the 
things that you're writing and singing about to remain an abstraction to
 yourself. I always liked the scene at the end of The Searchers: John 
Wayne brings the girl back home, but he can't enter the house himself. 
Very tragic. That was always really resonant for me. I grew up with a 
lot of that, people not being able to get in, and that was always my 
natural state.<br>
<br>
I think that because I had a bit of a chaotic heart myself, I always was
 in search of that stability. It's in "Leah," on Devils &amp; Dust: "I 
walk this road with a hammer and a fiery lantern/With this hand I've 
built, and with this I've burned." I think everybody feels those two 
things. It's just how you balance them. There's a lot of fire in the 
burning, but it don't do you any good if you ain't got the hammer for 
the building.<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: Bringing It All Back Home<br>
<br>
With his third great album this decade, he tackles love, loyalty -- and the ultimate deadline<br>
<br>
by: David Fricke<br>
<br>
The sound is classic amateur 1966 — chaotic, jangling guitars, impatient
 drumming and crude raging-hormone vocal harmonies — and Bruce 
Springsteen knows every note by heart. Hypnotized by joy in front of a 
small tabletop stereo cranked to top volume, he dances on the balls of 
his feet, vigorously strums an imaginary guitar with his right fist and 
howls along during the chorus — "Baby I-I-I-I!" — in a deeper wild-bear 
version of his old plaintive teenage tenor. Springsteen, 59, is happily 
singing and playing air guitar with himself- to "Baby I," a single he 
made at 16, when he was a guitarist and singer in a New Jersey garage 
band, the Castiles. Earlier that afternoon, Springsteen is sitting in 
the wood-paneled living room of Thrill Hill, a 19th-century farmhouse in
 central New Jersey that he has converted into a studio. He talks about 
some of the Sixties echoes — including the Walker Brothers, Jimmy Webb, 
the Beach Boys on "Heroes and Villains" and the Byrds' Fifth Dimension —
 ringing throughout his new album with the E Street Band, Working on a 
Dream. That gets him reminiscing about the Castiles, his first serious 
band. Suddenly, Springsteen bolts upright in his chair. "I have to dig 
it out before you go," he says excitedly. "I found the actual two-track 
tape of our record. I had it put on a CD. It's back at the house. I'll 
bring it over."<br>
<br>
And he does, rushing home — Springsteen, his wife and E Street singer 
Patti Scialfa and their three teenage children live in an 18th-century 
house just down the road — and back. Springsteen doesn't even bother 
taking off his bulky winter coat. He strides into the glassed-in porch 
where he demos new songs and made his 2005 solo album, Devils &amp; 
Dust, hits "play" and flies back to May 18th, 1966, when the Castiles 
recorded "Baby I" and the flip side, "That's What You Get," at Mr. Music
 Inc., a studio in nearby Bricktown.<br>
<br>
"Well, what could have been a studio back then," Springsteen cracks 
after he plays both tracks. He and singer-guitarist George Theiss wrote 
the songs, according to legend, while driving to the session. The band 
cut them in an hour. "I talk to George once in a while," Springsteen 
says. "He got married very, very young. Had a lovely family. Made music.
 I used to see him at the Stone Pony all the time. He had a great 
voice."<br>
<br>
But the Castiles' big moment passed that day in '66 — their single was 
never released — while Springsteen, nearly 43 years later, is at a new 
peak in his career. Working on a Dream is Springsteen's third great 
album with the E Street Band in a decade and arguably the best of the 
three in its classic-pop songwriting and intimate lyric force. They made
 most of it on days off from their 2007-08 shows — Danny Federici played
 keyboards on some tracks before his death at 58 last April 17th from 
melanoma — with Springsteen and producer Brendan O'Brien enriching the E
 Street Band's natural stampede in "My Lucky Day," "What Love Can Do" 
and the opening eight-minute horse opera, "Outlaw Pete," with an 
abundance of strings, guitars, choral vocals and saxophonist Clarence 
Clemons' leonine blowing. The result is Springsteen's most ornate album 
since 1975's Born to Run.<br>
<br>
He has already started the new year with a Golden Globe for his theme 
song to The Wrestler and is assured an Academy Award nomination as well.
 After his January 18th performance in Washington, D.C., at "We Are 
One," the free Barack Obama inauguration concert, Springsteen will play a
 hotly anticipated halftime set with the E Street Band at the Super Bowl
 on February 1st — itself a kick off for another E Street tour, in the 
spring in the U.S. and Europe. The last time Springsteen wrote, recorded
 and hit the road at this velocity was when he was a new Columbia 
artist. His first two albums, Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J. and The 
Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle, were both released in 
1973.<br>
<br>
"At that time, you signed old-fashioned contracts where you were 
supposed to make an album every six months," Springsteen says. "But 
after that, I said, 'Nah.' Without going into the whole story" — he 
grins — "obviously there was the perfectionism, the self-consciousness 
and the pursuit of very specific ideas, while you're forming who you 
are, what you want to write about."<br>
<br>
Drummer Max Weinberg remembers Springsteen leading endless E Street 
rehearsals for 1978's Darkness on the Edge of Town and the 1980 double 
album, The River. "Then, generally, everything we rehearsed would not 
get recorded — we would start rehearsing again in the studio," Weinberg 
recalls, relaxing on a floppy sofa in a small dressing room at his other
 job, the Rockefeller Center studios of NBC's Late Night With Conan 
O'Brien, where he has ' been the show's bandleader since 1993. "A lot of
 the tracks on those records were recorded rehearsals. 'Streets of Fire'
 [on Darkness] — it wouldn't even be legitimate to call it a demo. None 
of us had any idea where it was going."<br>
<br>
"It was not exciting — it was the opposite of exciting," guitarist 
Steven Van Zandt says of those sessions with a guttural chuckle. One of 
Springsteen's oldest friends (Weinberg calls him Springsteen's 
"consigliere"), Van Zandt co-produced those two albums and 1984's Born 
in the U.S.A. with Springsteen and the singer's manager, Jon Landau. 
"I'm not that disciplined," Van Zandt admits. "If it's 10 percent less 
good if we did it in a day instead of a month, I'm cool with that. It's 
still 110 percent better than what anybody else is doing. Bruce 
understood that. But he said, We're going for 100 percent all the time. 
We're not compromising one iota.'"<br>
<br>
"Yes, there was fear of failure," Springsteen concedes, surrounded in 
the Thrill Hill living room by vintage mounted photographs of what he 
calls "my saints," including the elder Bob Dylan, the young Elvis 
Presley and the folk-blues singers Elizabeth Cotten and Mississippi John
 Hurt. "This is all repair work, in one way or another. The guys I was 
interested in Dylan, Hank Williams, Frank Sinatra, Bob Marley, John 
Lydon, Joe Strummer — all had something eating at them. Those are the 
forces you're playing with. And you're in the studio trying to figure 
out, 'How do I live with myself?'<br>
<br>
"I'm not worried now about who I am," he says. "My identity, what people
 are connecting with — those things are set pretty firmly. I have an 
audience, of some kind. I also have a world of characters and ideas I 
have addressed for a long time. By now, at my age, those things aren't 
supposed to inhibit you. They are supposed to free you."<br>
<br>
Springsteen goes quiet for a minute when asked if, even at 16, he had 
bigger dreams and a stronger will than the other guys in the Castiles. 
"We were kids, you know," he says. There is another pause. "A lot of it 
has to do with raw need, motivation. I was very isolated. That's a 
common story with rock musicians. We all feel like that. And it makes 
you mad." He smiles, then explodes with laughter. "I mean, really mad! 
But if you learn to organize your desires and demands and shoot them 
into something that is more than just being about you, you start to 
communicate. I wanted to be a part of the world around me."<br>
<br>
Springsteen had a long-term advantage: the E Street Band, started in 
1972, formally named in 1974, reunited in 1999 after a 10-year split and
 now numbering eight, including bassist Garry Tallent, an original 
member with Clemons and Federici; pianist Roy Bittan, who joined with 
Weinberg in mid-'74; guitarist Nils Lofgren, first recruited for the 
Born in-the U.S.A. tour; and violinist-singer Soozie Tyrell, who first 
played on The Rising. (Charlie Giordano played keyboards after 
Federici's illness forced him to leave the Magic tour in November 2007.)<br>
<br>
"They are my greatest friendships, my deepest friendships — 
irreplaceable things," Springsteen says. "I'll put The Rising, Magic and
 the new one against any other three records we've made in a row, as far
 as sound, depth and purpose, of what they're saying and conveying. It's
 very satisfying to be able to do that at this point in the road."<br>
<br>
"It makes you proud to be his friend," Van Zandt declares with another 
rusty chuckle, "when so many others are, you know, cruisin'."<br>
<br>
When Springsteen was a young boy, his mother, Adele, sent him off to 
sleep every night with a story — a rhyme about the ranch hand Cowboy 
Bill. "She would say it to me before I went to bed," Springsteen says. 
"It was like our good night to each other." He starts the first verse 
from memory — "Of all the hands on the Bar-H Ranch, the bravest was 
brave Cowboy Bill" — but can't remember the rest. "There were other good
 lines. I gotta find out what they are."<br>
<br>
Three weeks later, Springsteen sends them in a handwritten fax after his
 mom recited them again to him over the phone: "He wore tight boots with
 heels so high, a 10-gallon hat that hid one eye and sheepskin chaps 
with flaps/He named his pony Golden Arrow, and every day with a clip and
 a clop he rode into the highest mountaintop." Later in the tale, 
published in 1950 as "Brave Cowboy Bill" in a Little Golden Book for 
children, the hero foils a gang of cattle thieves. "At some point, I 
told Patti my mother would recite this stanza about Cowboy Bill," 
Springsteen says. "Patti said, 'Outlaw Pete — I think that's Cowboy 
Bill.' I thought, 'Gee, maybe you're right.'"<br>
<br>
The longest song Springsteen has recorded since "Drive All Night," on 
The River, "Outlaw Pete" is the life story of a bandit and killer 
written in campfire-ballad cadence and swamped in spaghetti-Western 
ambience — Springsteen's return to the cinematic-parable scope of his 
mid-Seventies songs "Jungleland" and "Incident on 57th Street." "Outlaw 
Pete" was also, at first, his deliberate turn away from the struggle 
through 9/11 grief on The Rising and his Bush-years outrage on Magic. "I
 thought, 'I should write a little opera' something fantastic with a 
cartoon character, like 'Rocky Raccoon,' by the Beatles." Springsteen 
cracks himself up quoting one of the opening lines : "At six months old,
 he'd done three months in jail."<br>
<br>
The ending is not so cute. Pete tries to run from his crimes, vanishing 
into thin air — maybe dead, maybe not. "I decided to follow the 
character, see what happens to him," Springsteen explains. What he found
 was terribly familiar. "We all have to reckon with our own history, 
because history catches up with you. That's what was not happening over 
the past eight years in the United States — that not knowing, the 
arrogance that led to thousands of people dying and the country having a
 complete financial nervous breakdown. If you do not reckon with your 
own history, it eats you. And if you have that level of authority, then 
it eats us."<br>
<br>
Most of Working on a Dream takes place far from newspaper headlines, in 
darkened bedrooms, under starlight. There is ecstasy and pleading, 
promises made and broken, underneath the bright, clanging guitars and 
spiking harmonies in "This Life," "Surprise, Surprise" and the erotic 
fantasy "Queen of the Supermarket." A man and a woman count their time 
together and their time left in wrinkles and gray hairs in "Kingdom of 
Days."<br>
<br>
Springsteen contends he is not the man, and that is not his marriage, in
 those songs — not all the time: "Patti and I have been together for 20 
years. 'Kingdom of Days' is something you write after having a long, 
long life with somebody, where you see how much you've built together. 
You also see its finiteness, the passing of the day's light on your 
partner's face." The song "is about taking the fear and terror out of 
those things."<br>
<br>
One line in there — "And I count my blessings that you're mine for 
always" could also be interpreted as Springsteen's thank-you to the E 
Street Band, one of rock's greatest enduring road shows. It is a group 
that labored relentlessly for him in the Seventies and Eighties, then 
was forced to accept his decision in 1989 to be a full-time solo artist 
for the next decade, Clemons was in Japan, playing with Ringo Starr, 
when he got Springsteen's call. "He says, 'Big Man, it's over,'" Clemons
 recalls. "I thought he was talking about the Ringo tour, that I had to 
come back and go to work. He says, 'No, no, it's over. I'm gonna break 
the band up.'<br>
<br>
"Although I heard him say it, I knew it wouldn't last," Clemons swears. "Anything this great, that natural, cannot go away."<br>
<br>
Springsteen acknowledges the Nineties as "a lost period. I didn't do a 
lot of work. Some people would say I didn't do my best work." He split 
the E Street Band because "I lost sight. I didn't know what to do next 
with them." But after the 1999-2000 reunion tour, he says, "the 
beautiful realization was "This isn't a phase. This is it.' The trick in
 keeping bands together," he adds, "is always the same: 'Hey, asshole, 
the guy standing next to you is more important than you think he is.'"<br>
<br>
But Springsteen cautions about reading too much into his first-person 
voice in "Kingdom of Days" and other new songs: "I will steal directly 
from life." But that life is "things everyone goes through. I'm not 
interested in the solipsistic approach to songwriting. I don't want to 
tell you all about me. I want to tell you about you."<br>
<br>
Weinberg got that lesson the day he auditioned for the E Street Band. 
His previous band had covered "4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)," from 
Springsteen's second album. "I asked him, Who's Sandy?'" Weinberg says. 
"I thought it was a letter. He said, 'Who do you think it is?' Ever 
since I got that answer, I never ask what the lyrics mean."<br>
<br>
"This record is a little different," Springsteen says of Working on a 
Dream. "Its text is not on top, as in The Rising or Magic, where you can
 immediately connect to the events of the day." In fact, Springsteen did
 not appreciate the real politics in the new album's title song until 
the night of November 4th as he watched the election coverage on 
television. He wrote "Working on a Dream" over the summer, a couple of 
months after he publicly endorsed Barack Obama for the presidency, but 
the lyrics are strictly nonpartisan, like a Pete Seeger work song 
sweetened with the mid-Sixties Roy Orbison.<br>
<br>
"That was just the simple idea of effort — the ongoing daily effort to 
build something," Springsteen explains, "and that you can't give up. I 
write my songs. I go around the world to sing 'em, about a particular 
place that I have imagined, that I have hopes is real. I don't see that 
often. A lot of what I see is the opposite — less economic justice, 
democracy eroded.<br>
<br>
"Then, suddenly, election night," he says with genuine wonder. "Suddenly
 the place you've been singing about all these years it shows its face. 
You looked in the crowds, you saw people crying, people who lived and 
worked in the civil rights era, and you completely understood — it's 
real. It's not just something I dreamed up. It can exist.<br>
<br>
"I don't have any delusions about whatever power rock musicians have — I
 tend to believe it's relatively little," Springsteen declares flatly. 
But, he quickly adds, "though it may be little, it is important in its 
particularness. The first time I recognized the country I lived in, the 
truest version I ever heard, was when I put on Bob Dylan's Highway 61 
Revisited. I went, "That's it. That's what it feels like.'<br>
<br>
"All you want," he insists, "is for your voice to be part of the record,
 at a particular time and place. You try to be on the right side of 
history. And maybe some other kid will hear that and go, 'Oh, yeah, that
 sounds like the place I live.'"<br>
<br>
Danny Federici first played with Springsteen 40 years ago. Actually, it 
was Federici — a classical-trained accordionist from Flemington, New 
Jersey — who hired Springsteen when they initially worked together, in 
1969 in the hippie-rock band Child, later renamed Steel Mill. "This 
skinny guy with long hair and a ratty T-shirt was an incredible guitar 
player and singer," Federici once said, "so we asked him to join." 
Federici stayed with Springsteen after the latter started running things
 and forming his own bands. The organist did not play on Greetings From 
Asbury Park, N.J. but was back with Springsteen by late 1972, in the 
earliest, not-yet-named E Street Band with Clemons and Tallent.<br>
<br>
"Those were real frontier days, some of the most reckless times," 
Springsteen says fondly. "And Danny was one of the most reckless members
 of the band. In lieu of any other authority figure, I was trying to 
manage everything." Springsteen smiles. "Danny didn't like to be 
managed.<br>
<br>
"All of those things become part of your relationship," he continues. 
"Those are the people you make your miracle with. And the love that 
comes out of it is greater than your animosities, greater than time. 
It's strange, the way the dead remain among us."<br>
<br>
The E Street old-timers have plenty of Federici stories, and they love 
telling them. "He was one of the wildest individuals I ever met, a real 
crazy guy," says Clemons, who roomed with Federici in the early days. 
Clemons describes crashing one night with Federici and Springsteen in an
 attic at the Boston home of the mother of one of their ex-managers. 
"Bruce and I were talking, on our beds. Suddenly, Danny sat up in his 
bed, wide awake, said, 'Semicomasomadoma,' and went back to sleep. Bruce
 and I looked at each other and went, What the hell was that?'" When 
Clemons visited Federici shortly before his death, "I said, 'Danny, tell
 me, before you go, what was that 'Semicomasomadoma' thing?'" Clemons 
laughs. "He didn't tell me. It remains a mystery."<br>
<br>
Federici was "like Dennis the Menace, a kid with no respect for 
authority, going to do what he wants, no matter what," says Van Zandt, 
who played in Steel Mill. "Bruce came out of his hotel room once, and 
Danny was there, dismantling the elevator lights to stick on his organ. 
Another time, in a bar, we saw him dismantle the speakers in a jukebox —
 he was stealing them for his organ." But Van Zandt says Federici was 
"an extraordinarily instinctive musician. He couldn't have told you the 
chords in 'Born to Run.' And he never hit the wrong note. Always did the
 job." Van Zandt laughs. "He got into trouble on his own time."<br>
<br>
"Danny was a very curious guy — incredibly scientific, extremely clued 
into technology and astronomy," Weinberg says. He too laughs, noting 
that Federici was also "very honest. Danny didn't want me to join the 
band. He told me years later, 'I voted against you.'"<br>
<br>
Weakened by his illness and treatments, Federici made his final 
appearance with the E Street Band last year, on March 20th in 
Indianapolis, playing five songs, including his signature organ feature,
 "Kitty's Back." On April 22nd, five nights after Federici died, 
Springsteen opened his show in Tampa, Florida, with a film tribute to 
his old friend and a version of "Backstreets" without organ — and a 
spotlight shining where Federici should have been. "That was Bruce's way
 of saying, 'OK, everyone is wondering about our loss,'" says Lofgren. 
"'Well, let me show you how bad it is.'"<br>
<br>
In the living room at Thrill Hill, as the late-afternoon winter sunlight
 fades outside the windows, Springsteen quotes from the last verse of 
"The Last Carnival," his tribute to Federici at the end of Working on a 
Dream: "We'll be riding the train without you tonight/The train that 
keeps on movin'."<br>
<br>
"That's just life, and it all goes on without you," he says. "The 
acknowledgment of time, its effects — on a good day, it's a sweetener. 
It makes every element of the day come to life a little more than it 
normally would. Because you realize it's finite — everything around you,
 the band, the family. In a not very long period of time, someone else 
will be living in this house, driving these roads. Somebody may go, 
'Hey, Bruce Springsteen used to live there.' And in a little bit longer 
than that, they ain't gonna be saying that anymore. They're just going 
to be driving by.<br>
<br>
"That's the way the cards is played. But in the meanwhile …" Springsteen
 raises his voice to the preacher-fever pitch with which he promises 
rock &amp; roll salvation each night onstage. "Oh, there is fun to be 
had and work to do. The band, in truth, is at its very best. I don't 
believe there has been any other time in our career when we have played 
better than we did on the second half of that last tour. If you came to 
see us with your sign with your favorite song on it, something we hadn't
 played in 30 years, that night we might play it. The band was on fire. 
Just the acknowledgment of that finiteness made everybody double down on
 their commitment."<br>
<br>
The physical cost of three-hour shows and year-long tours over four 
decades is high. "We were a MASH unit, with heating pads, ice packs, 
exercise equipment and masseuses all we needed to physically do it," 
Lofgren says of the 2008 shows, only part-kidding. The guitarist, 57, 
recently had both of his hips replaced. Clemons, at 67 the oldest E 
Street member, has had three hip replacements (one hip was done twice) 
and underwent knee-replacement surgery on both legs last year.<br>
<br>
Another complication comes on June 1st, when Conan O'Brien and the Max 
Weinberg 7 take over The Tonight Show, which is produced in Los Angeles.
 Springsteen shrugs when asked if he is worried about booking E Street 
gigs around Weinberg's new cross-country commute and shooting schedule. 
"All I know is this — it's all gonna work out, one way or another," 
Springsteen says. "If people wanna come out and see the E Street Band, 
they'll be able to come out and see the E Street Band."<br>
<br>
"It's a hell of a problem to have in this economy," Weinberg says 
cheerfully, then tells a story that illustrates how well his two bosses 
get along: About 10 years ago, a well-known actress on an NBC sitcom 
(Weinberg doesn't reveal her name) requested a sabbatical from the 
series to make a movie. NBC said no. Her agent pointed out that Weinberg
 was allowed to go off for six months at a time to play with 
Springsteen. "The NBC lawyer thought for a second, then said, 'The next 
time Bruce Springsteen asks your client to play drums with him, she can 
do that.'" Weinberg grins, noting that in the NBC legal department, "it 
is known as the Weinberg-Springsteen Rule."<br>
<br>
Van Zandt takes credit for coining Springsteen's famous nickname. "In 
our neighborhood, I was the Boss," says Van Zandt, who played with 
Springsteen in many pre-E Street Jersey Shore bands and shared an 
apartment with him for a time. "But when I started calling him the Boss,
 people paid attention." From the start, Van Zandt says, Springsteen 
"had his eye on history. He was like, 'This ship is sailing. Are you on 
board or not?'"<br>
<br>
Springsteen is not the same bandleader he was in clubs like the Student 
Prince in Asbury Park or even after he graduated to stadiums in the 
mid-Eighties. "He's become more masterful, if anything," Bittan claims. 
"Let's not forget he is singing, playing guitar, jumping around, working
 the audience, playing to the video cameras, conducting the band. That 
is a lot of balls in the air at one time — and to look natural doing 
it."<br>
<br>
Based on the way E Street members describe his method of command, 
Springsteen is the least verbal no-nonsense bandleader in rock. "He 
doesn't sit down and say what he expects," clemons says. "He knows, as a
 musician, what he's gonna get from everybody. Then we live up to his 
expectations."<br>
<br>
The most explicit direction Weinberg ever got was right when he joined 
the E Street Band. "Drummers have a thing — we call 'em high-hat barks,"
 Weinberg explains, "that psst, psst sound. Bruce said, 'I like those.' 
So I threw them in a lot." But there was no instruction from Springsteen
 in the studio when Weinberg hit that titanic roll at the end of "Born 
in the U.S.A." "That was completely visceral. That's what I try to do — 
hook up with whatever Bruce is feeling and give him what he wants, the 
way I do it."<br>
<br>
As a band boss, Springsteen is a lot like Neil Young, according to 
Lofgren, who has performed and recorded with Young periodically since 
the early Seventies. "They are very hands-off in terms of what you do, 
as long as it feels right," Lofgren says. "Neil likes to get loose, more
 reckless. But in general, the theme is, get lost in the music. Stay 
lost in it until you come up for air at the end of the show. But prepare
 enough so your instincts are true to the bandleader's vision."<br>
<br>
For Springsteen, that now includes an urgency — do more faster — which, 
he admits, is very different from the tenacious perfectionism of his 
youth: "Patti said it — You are in a manic state, running like crazy 
from, let me think, death itself?'" Springsteen howls with glee. "It's a
 funny thing to say. But I've got a deadline! And that fire I feel in 
myself and the band — it's a very enjoyable thing. It carries an element
 of desperateness. It also carries an element of thankfulness.<br>
<br>
"We are perched at a place where we want to continue on — with 
excellence," Springsteen says proudly. "That's our goal. All the rest of
 the stuff- we're gonna figure it out."<br>
<br>
A few minutes later, he gets up and races home to get that Castiles tape.<br>

<br>
Ahead of his Vote for Change concerts, Springsteen talks about his conscience, and the nature of an artist and his audience<br>
<br>
by: Jann S. Wenner<br>
<br>
Do you see these Vote for Change concerts reaching undecided voters, or 
are they more to rally the energy of people who have made up their 
minds?<br>
<br>
I always felt that the musician's job, as I experienced it growing up, 
was to provide an alternative source of information, a spiritual and 
social rallying place, somewhere you went to have a communal experience.<br>
<br>
I don't know if someone is going to run to the front of the stage and 
shout, "I'm saved" or "I'm switching," but I'm going to try. I will be 
calling anyone in a bow tie to come to the front of the stage, and I'll 
see what I can do.<br>
<br>
In a practical sense, what are you accomplishing?<br>
<br>
First of all, we have a large group of musicians – Dave Matthews, the 
Dixie Chicks, Pearl Jam, R.E.M., John Fogerty, James Taylor and many 
others – who are coming together as a rallying point for change, I think
 the concerts are going to be an energizing experience for all who come.
 Of course, I've met a few people who, in a very friendly way, said they
 are not coming.<br>
<br>
Basically, the concerts are raising money specifically for America 
Coming Together to do very practical things: voter education, to go out 
and mobilize voters, to go door-to-door, to assist voters getting to the
 polls. They're the real foot soldiers who are going to get out the 
progressive vote. That's probably the concerts' most important result.<br>
<br>
Why did you stay away from being actively involved in partisan politics for so long?<br>
<br>
I didn't grow up in a very political household. The only politics I 
heard was from my mother. I came home from grade school, where someone 
asked me if I was Republican or Democrat, and I asked my mom, "Well, 
what are we?" She said, "We're Democrats, cause Democrats are for the 
working people." I was politicized by the Sixties, like most of the 
other people of that generation at that time. I can remember doing a 
concert when I was probably in my very late teens, helping to bus people
 down to Washington for an anti-war demonstration.<br>
<br>
But still, basically, I wanted to remain an independent voice for the 
audience that came to my shows. We've tried to build up a lot of 
credibility over the years, so that if we took a stand on something, 
people would receive it with an open mind. Part of not being 
particularly partisan was just an effort to remain a very thoughtful 
voice in my fans' lives.<br>
<br>
I always liked being involved actively more at a grassroots level, to 
act as a partisan for a set of ideals: civil rights, economic justice, a
 sane foreign policy, democracy. That was the position I felt 
comfortable coming from.<br>
<br>
Did it make you more credible if you avoided endorsing an individual?<br>
<br>
It makes people less likely to marginalize you or pigeonhole you. Taking
 a definite stand on this election has probably provided some extra 
definition to the work I've been doing over the years. Our band is in 
pretty much what I think of as the center. So if I wrote, say, "American
 Skin," which was controversial, it couldn't easily be dismissed, 
because people had faith that I was a measured voice. That's been worth 
something, and it's something I don't want to lose. But we have drifted 
far from that center, and this is a time to be very specific about where
 I stand.<br>
<br>
Because you scrupulously avoided commercial use of your music, you built
 a reputation for integrity and conscience. You must be aware of the 
potency of that.<br>
<br>
I tried to build a reputation for thoughtfulness -- that was the main 
thing I was aiming for. I took the songs, the issues and the people I 
was writing about seriously. I wanted it to be an entertaining but 
thoughtful presentation. If there was a goal, it was as simple as that.<br>
<br>
Now you're asking your audience to think even more about and explore what else you're saying in your songs.<br>
<br>
There are a portion of your fans who do quite a bit of selective 
listening. That's the way that people use pop music, and that's part of 
the way it rolls. The upside is that there has been an increased 
definition about the things I've written about and where I stand on 
certain issues. That's been a good thing.<br>
<br>
I think that a more complicated picture of who you are as an artist and 
who they are as an audience emerges. The example I've been giving is 
that I've been an enormous fan of John Wayne all my life, although not a
 fan of his politics. I've made a place for all those different parts of
 who he was. I find deep inspiration and soulfulness in his work.<br>
<br>
Your audience invests a lot in you, a very personal investment. There is
 nothing more personal, in some ways, than the music people listen to. I
 know from my own experience how you identify and relate to the person 
singing. You have put your fingerprints on their imagination. That is 
very, very intimate. When something cracks the mirror, it can be hard 
for the fan who you have asked to identify with you.<br>
<br>
Pop musicians live in the world of symbology. You live and die by the 
symbol in many ways. You serve at the behest of your audience's 
imagination. It's a complicated relationship. So you're asking people to
 welcome the complexity in the interest of fuller and more honest 
communication.<br>
<br>
The audience and the artist are valuable to one another as long as you 
can look out there and see yourself, and they look back and see 
themselves. That's asking quite a bit, but that is what happens. When 
that bond is broken, by your own individual beliefs, personal thoughts 
or personal actions, it can make people angry. As simple as that. You're
 asking for a broader, more complicated relationship with the members of
 your audience than possibly you've had in the past.<br>
<br>
What do you stand to lose or gain from this as an artist?<br>
<br>
As an artist and a citizen, you're gaining a chance to take part in 
moving the country in the direction of its deepest ideals. Artists are 
always speaking to people's freedoms. The shout for freedom and its 
implications was implicit in rock &amp; roll from its inception. Freedom
 can only find its deepest meaning within a community of purpose. So as 
an individual I'm getting to take a small part in that process.<br>
<br>
As an artist, I'd like to have a broader understanding with all the 
different segments of my audience and have a deeper experience when we 
come out and play for people. I think that's something that could be 
gained, and that's something worth doing. I tend to think a relatively 
small amount of people might get turned off by it, 'cause I've tried to 
do this as thoughtfully as possible, and because any relationship worth 
something can take some rough-and-tumble. We'll see.<br>
<br>
This has obviously been on your mind for a while. How did you come to this decision?<br>
<br>
I knew after we invaded Iraq that I was going to be involved in the 
election. It made me angry. We started to talk about it onstage. I take 
my three minutes a night for what I call my public-service announcement.
 We talked about it almost every night on our summer tour.<br>
<br>
I felt we had been misled. I felt they had been fundamentally dishonest 
and had frightened and manipulated the American people into war. And as 
the saying goes, "The first casualty of war is truth." I felt that the 
Bush doctrine of pre-emption was dangerous foreign policy. I don't think
 it has made America safer.<br>
<br>
Look at what is going on now: We are quickly closing in on what looks an
 awful lot like the Vietnamization of the Iraq war. John McCain is 
saying we could be there for ten or twenty years, and John Kerry says 
four years. How many of our best young people are going to die between 
now and that time, and what exactly for?<br>
<br>
Initially I thought I was going to take my acoustic guitar and play in 
some theaters, find some organizations to work for and do what I could. I
 was going to lend my voice for a change in the administration and a 
change in the direction of the country.<br>
<br>
Sitting on the sidelines would be a betrayal of the ideas I'd written 
about for a long time. Not getting involved, just sort of maintaining my
 silence or being coy about it in some way, just wasn't going to work 
this time out. I felt that it was a very clear historical moment.<br>
<br>
So there wasn't a moment of doubt in your mind about what the right thing to do was?<br>
<br>
It was something that gestated over a period of time, and as events 
unfolded and the election got closer, it became clearer. I don't want to
 watch the country devolve into an oligarchy, watch the division of 
wealth increase and see another million people beneath the poverty line 
this year. These are all things that have been the subtext of so much of
 my music, and to see the country move so quickly to the right, so much 
further to the right than what the president campaigned on -- these are 
the things that removed whatever doubt I may have had about getting 
involved.<br>
<br>
Are you expecting to have your motives severely criticized?<br>
<br>
That's just a part of what happens. You understand you're going to be 
attacked in different ways. That just comes with it. That wasn't any 
concern.<br>
<br>
Do you think there is a climate of trying to intimidate artists and creative people?<br>
<br>
People are always trying to shut up the people they don't agree with -- 
through any means necessary, usually. There certainly was an attempt to 
intimidate the Dixie Chicks. What happened to them was a result of war 
fever -- simple as that, war fever. They've handled it in-credibly. They
 are very smart, tough women, and they did not back down. But it's one 
of those sad paradoxes that in theory we're fighting for freedom, and 
the first thing people are willing to throw out is freedom of speech at 
home and castigate anybody who is coming from a different point of view.<br>
<br>
A lot of people think that you have no right as an artist to comment on this or play a role in politics.<br>
<br>
I don't know if a lot of people think that. It is something that is 
said. It's sort of part of the "Punch and Judy" show that goes on when 
people disagree with what you're saying.<br>
<br>
How much do you follow this election?<br>
<br>
I think that Senator Kerry has long played it close to the vest, and 
that's his style. However, the presidency is like the heavyweight 
championship: They don't give it to you, you have to take it. He has a 
slow, deliberate style that may not make for an electrifying campaigner,
 but it may make for a very good president. But, of course, you have to 
get there.<br>
<br>
One of the most disturbing aspects of this election is that the 
machinery for taking something that is a lie and making it feel true, or
 taking something that is true and making it feel like a lie -- the 
selling machinery has become very powerful. Senator Kerry has to make 
people pay attention to the man behind the curtain. He has to take the 
risk and rip the veil off the administration's deceptions. They are a 
hall of mirrors and a house of cards.<br>
<br>
For Senator Kerry, the good news is he has the facts on his side. The 
bad news is that often in the current climate it can feel like that 
doesn't matter, and he has to make it matter.<br>
<br>
What do you think of how the election is being covered and conducted through the press?<br>
<br>
The press has let the country down. It's taken a very amoral stand, in 
that essential issues are often portrayed as simply one side says this 
and the other side says that. I think that Fox News and the Republican 
right have intimidated the press into an incredible self-consciousness 
about appearing objective and backed them into a corner of sorts where 
they have ceded some of their responsibility and righteous power.<br>
<br>
The Washington Post and New York Times apologies about their initial 
reporting about Iraq not being critical enough were very revealing. I am
 a dedicated Times reader, and I've found enormous sustenance from Paul 
Krugman and Maureen Dowd on the op-ed page. There has been great 
reporting, but there has also been some self-consciousness in some of 
the reporting about the policy differences in this election.<br>
<br>
This is going to be an issue after the election. I don't know if it 
began with the Iraq War, but shortly thereafter there was an enormous 
amount of Fox impersonators among what you previously thought were 
relatively sane media outlets across the cable channels. It was very 
disheartening. The job of the press is to tell the truth without fear or
 favor. We have to get back to that standard.<br>
<br>
The free press is supposed to be the lifeline and the blood of 
democracy. That is the position of responsibility that those 
institutions have. Those things are distorted by ratings and by money to
 where you're getting one hour of the political conventions. No matter 
how staged they are, I think they're a little more important than people
 eating bugs. I think that for those few nights, the political life of 
the nation should take priority, and the fact that it so casually does 
not means something is wrong. If you want to watch people eating bugs, 
that's fine, I can understand that, too, but let's do it on another 
night.<br>
<br>
Real news is the news we need to protect our freedoms. You get tabloid 
news, you get blood-and-guts news, you get news shot through with a 
self-glorifying facade of patriotism, but people have to sift too much 
for the news that we need to protect our freedoms. It should be 
gloriously presented to the people on a nightly basis. The loss of some 
of the soberness and seriousness of those institutions has had a 
devastating effect upon people's ability to respond to the events of the
 day.<br>
<br>
Do you think the press is leading us away from a fair and objective reading of this election?<br>
<br>
It's gotten very complicated, and I think it's blurred the truth. 
Whether you like the Michael Moore film or not, a big part of its value 
was that it showed how sanitized the war that we received on television 
at night is. The fact that the administration refused to allow 
photographs of the flag-draped coffins of returning dead, that the 
president hasn't shown up at a single military funeral for the young 
people who gave their lives for his policies, is disgraceful.<br>
<br>
You have the Swift-boat guys who have been pretty much discredited, but 
there is an atmosphere that is created by so much willing media exposure
 that it imparts them credibility.<br>
<br>
What do you think the responsibility of the artist is in society?<br>
<br>
There is a long tradition of the artist being involved in the life of 
the nation. For me, it goes back to Woody Guthrie, James Brown, Curtis 
Mayfield and Bob Dylan. These were all people who were alternative 
sources of information. When Dylan hit in the mid-Sixties, he brought 
with him as true a reading of what was going on as was out there.<br>
<br>
People have the choice to not listen, but you have these business 
lobbyists who affect the direction of public policy. For example, what 
is going on with the assault-rifle ban is disgusting. The labor unions 
try to affect policy in their fashion. Artists do it by talking and 
singing and addressing the life of the mind.<br>
<br>
I don't think the audience are lemmings. They get their various points 
of view from a lot of places. I try to come in and be that alternative 
source of information. I try to speak my case as directly as I can. If 
that makes you angry, that's fine. The artist is there to open up 
discourse, to get people thinking about American identity: Who are we? 
What do we fight for? What do we stand for? I view these things as a 
fundamental part of my job, and they have been for the past thirty 
years.<br>
<br>
You've tried to think long and hard about what it means to be an 
American and about our distinctive identity and position in the world. 
What is that great thing about America that appeals to you that you are 
fighting for?<br>
<br>
I felt I lived the prototypical American life -- the way I grew up, the 
town I grew up in, my family life. Things that I cared about, things 
that I aspired to, they were just something that naturally came to me 
when I wrote. I think that this particular election is, at the core, a 
debate about the soul of the nation. I think we can move toward greater 
economic justice for all of our citizens, or we cannot. I think we can 
move toward a sane, responsible foreign policy, or we cannot. For me, 
these are issues that go right to the heart of the spiritual life of the
 nation. That is something I have written about. It cannot be abandoned 
and is worth fighting and fighting and fighting for.<br>
<br>
When you embark on a creative life, it has a dynamic of its own. You are
 partially directing it, and you are partially riding the wave. If your 
work is threaded into people's lives and into the life of your town, 
your family, your country, then you're like everybody else -- you're at 
the mercy of events, you're borne along on the currents of time and 
history.<br>
<br>
It's sort of "Gee, I came from this place, I wrote songs about these 
things that mattered to me." I was serious about them. I was serious 
about taking what I had written and having some practical impact, which 
we started to do in the early Eighties. Nothing fancy. I can play my 
guitar, I can make a few bucks, I can bring some attention to some folks
 doing the real work and have some small impact in the towns we visit. 
You move down the road and it just sort of… happens.<br>
<br>
Did you feel the call of your nation or the call of your community?<br>
<br>
I don't know. Personally, I wouldn't view myself as that kind of valuable.<br>
<br>
So you feel the call from your heart?<br>
<br>
Yeah, I can hear the bells chiming. I've had a long life with my 
audience. I always tell the story about the guy with The Rising: "Hey, 
Bruce, we need you!" he yelled at me through the car window. That's 
about the size of it: You get a few letters that say, "Hey, man, we need
 you." You bump into some people at a club and you say, "Hey, man, 
what's going on?" And they go, "Hey, we need you." Yeah, they don't 
really need me, but I'm proud if they need what I do. That's what my 
band is. That's what we were built for.<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen's State of the Union<br>
<br>
Jon Stewart sits down with his home-state hero for a conversation about 
'Wrecking Ball,' the death of Clarence Clemons, and the gap between the 
'American reality and the American dream'<br>
<br>
by: Jon Stewart<br>
<br>
They have a lot to talk about this evening, these two guys from New 
Jersey, these serious men with silly jobs. "When he's talking to his 
audience," says Jon Stewart, "he's put time and effort into that 
conversation. He wants his music to be about something." The host of The
 Daily Show is talking about Bruce Springsteen, and about himself, too: 
Stewart and Springsteen have each found ways to instill a steeliness of 
purpose into the acts of singing songs and telling jokes. But there's 
another way to look at it, Stewart suggests with a laugh: "You're in 
businesses where you should be having a good time, you dour pricks! What
 is wrong with you?"<br>
<br>
Springsteen arrives at The Daily Show's Manhattan studios on foot one 
icy day in late January, fresh from Jersey – he fought the wind for the 
dozen blocks from the Lincoln Tunnel along 11th Avenue, wearing only a 
thin leather jacket. "There was traffic," says Springsteen, "so Patti 
dropped me off." ("The Freehold is strong in that one," Stewart says, 
picturing this journey.) Back from taping that night's Daily Show, 
Stewart joins Springsteen in his cluttered office – where there's 
already a photo of the two men together pinned to the wall – after 
exchanging his suit and tie for khakis and a long-sleeved T-shirt.<br>
<br>
In recent years, Stewart has seen his decades-long Springsteen fandom 
turn into a friendship. "It's in no way surreal," Stewart says with 
heavy sarcasm. "It's the most natural thing in the world. It's very hard
 to reconcile sitting and fishing in a little pond in New Jersey with a 
guy you spent many years hitchhiking the 1-95 corridor to see in 
Philadelphia back in the day. The only band I think I've seen more than 
Bruce Springsteen is the Springsteen tribute band Backstreets. I try not
 to let him know how pathetic I truly am."<br>
<br>
Stewart grew up in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, 30 miles northwest of 
Springsteen's Monmouth County hometown. "Every car he sang about you 
were like, 'I've seen that up on blocks in the backyard right near where
 I live.'" He saw his first Springsteen show on 1978's Darkness on the 
Edge of Town tour, when he was about 15. "The first time you hear 
Darkness, you begin to plan how to move out of New Jersey," says 
Stewart. (Like Springsteen, Stewart eventually returned, and has a home 
in the Garden State: "You realize, hey, New Jersey's all right, 
actually!")<br>
<br>
On Springsteen's new album, Wrecking Ball, his characters aren't looking
 for escape – they just want a job. With fiercely populist tunes like 
"Death to My Hometown" and "Jack of All Trades," Springsteen paints a 
picture of an America where "the banker man grows fat/Working man grows 
thin." Springsteen wanted the new songs to address "what happened to the
 social fabric of the world that we're living in."<br>
<br>
The two men spoke for nearly two hours, with Springsteen sharing details
 of his creative process, his grief over the loss of Clarence Clemons 
last year and the angry patriotism that fuels Wrecking Ball. When it was
 over, Stewart handed the recorder to a Rolling Stone staffer: "Here you
 go – we got most of it."<br>
<br>
"There's a lot of drunken singing," adds Springsteen.<br>
<br>
"A lot of it's in Hebrew," says Stewart.<br>
<br>
How have you been, man?<br>
Good! We've been starting rehearsals with the whole band – on the abandoned military base at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey.<br>
<br>
I know that place. Every time I drive by there, I think about The 
Andromeda Strain. I always think that it's one of those horror movies 
where all the structures still stand, still somewhat manicured, but the 
shit is just empty.<br>
That's what it's like. There's a rehearsal studio, and we are the sole 
citizens. We're the only game in town on that thing. And the funny thing
 was, I played there at the teen club and the officers' club when I was 
16 – it was a regular gig. It's funny to be back there now when it's 
completely empty.<br>
<br>
This was more of a solo album than an E Street Band album – what was the process behind it?<br>
It basically all started out as folk music – it was me and my guitar 
singing these songs. But while I was doing that, I was hearing maybe 50 
percent of the arrangement in my head. So the minute I stopped playing, I
 would run around on all the instruments, and in about an hour or more, I
 would rough out the sound I was hearing in my head while I was singing.
 A lot of it was cut with acoustic guitar, singing and a sample, like 
maybe a hip-hop loop or country-blues-stomp loop. And the actual drums 
came later – there was no preconceived set of instruments that needed to
 be used. I could go anywhere, do anything, use anything. It was very 
wide-open.<br>
<br>
There are songs on here that feel like you and the Chieftains went out for a beer, and you decided to go kick it.<br>
I called on a lot of roots and Celtic elements because I use the music 
to give the story a historical context. "Death to My Hometown" sounds 
like an Irish rebel song, but it's all about what happened four years 
ago. I want to give people a sense that this is something that's 
happened over and over and over again; what happened in 2008 happened 
before the turn of the century, and just after the turn of the century –
 it's a repetitive, historical cycle that has basically landed on the 
heads of the same people.<br>
<br>
They could have been singing in 1840, 1860. . . .<br>
Or yesterday. "Shackled and Drawn" is the same thing, it's like a slave song, a field chant.<br>
<br>
Near the end of the record, hearing Clarence's sax on "Land of Hope and Dreams" hits you in the gut. It's powerful.<br>
He played beautifully. That's a loss we haven't gauged, or will be able to gauge.<br>
<br>
Did it make you reticent to tour?<br>
No, I knew we were going to play, and I knew the band was going to 
continue. I knew that, I guess, it's two things: One, people need to 
know that the band is going to continue and be OK and carry on its 
service and its entertainment. And the other part of the show will be 
that people need to miss Clarence – and they will, and so will I.<br>
<br>
But all it says is that the currents of life hold their sway even over 
the dream world of pop music, and that's the way it goes. We're like 
everybody else. We're just trying to figure it out. I don't know what's 
going to happen the first night we walk out onstage or the 10th night or
 . . . you don't really know. It's an experience we're going to have 
with our audience on this tour.<br>
<br>
How did his death affect this album?<br>
The record was pretty much done, except that I wanted to get Clarence on
 it. The week before he died I called him to come in and record on his 
way back from Los Angeles, where he'd worked with Lady Gaga. He was 
having problems with the feeling in his hand. He was worried and asked 
if he could go home to Florida first and have it checked out. It was the
 only time Clarence passed on a recording session, so I said sure, we'd 
catch it later down the road.<br>
<br>
A week later, he was in the hospital from the stroke. I flew to Florida 
and spent the week with his family at his bedside. He never really 
regained consciousness, but in the first few days he'd squeeze my hand 
when he heard my voice. Then things got worse. After the funeral, I 
returned home to my studio to finish the record. [Wrecking Ball 
producer] Ron Aniello greeted me, and as we sat at the control board he 
said, "I'm so sorry about Clarence. I didn't know what to do when I 
heard, so I went home to Los Angeles and put this together from one of 
the live takes of the song." He played me "Land of Hope and Dreams," and
 when the solo section hit, Clarence's sax filled the room. I cried. So 
he's there, through a little technical magic . . . but he's there.<br>
<br>
"Hope and Dreams" and other songs on the album's second half seem to 
move from the personal and political to a sense of the spiritual.<br>
Well, on the first half of the record, you're just pissed off. The first
 cut, "We Take Care of Our Own," is where I set out the questions that 
I'm going to try to answer. The song's chorus is posed as a challenge 
and a question. Do we take care of our own? What happened to that social
 contract? Where did that go over the past 30 years? How has it been 
eroded so terribly? And how is it that the outrage about that erosion is
 just beginning to be voiced right now? I've written about this stuff 
for those 30 years, from Darkness on the Edge of Town to The Ghost of 
Tom Joad through to today. It all came out of the Carter recession of 
the late Seventies, and when I was writing about that, my brother-in-law
 lost his construction job and went to work as a janitor in the local 
high school. It changed his life.<br>
<br>
So these are issues and things that occur over and over again in history
 and land on the backs of the same people. In my music – if it has a 
purpose beyond dancing and fun and vacuuming your floor to it – I always
 try to gauge the distance between American reality and the American 
dream. The mantra that I go into in the last verse of "We Take Care of 
Our Own" – "Where are the eyes, where are the hearts?" – it's really: 
"Where are those things now, what happened to those things over the past
 30 years? What happened to the social fabric of the world that we're 
living in? What's the price that people pay for it on a daily basis?" 
Which is something that I lived with intensely as a child, and is 
probably the prime motivation for the subjects I've written about since I
 was very, very young.<br>
<br>
Someone wrote in The New York Times that "We Take Care of Our Own" was "jingoistic."<br>
Whoever said that, they need a smarter pop writer.<br>
<br>
[Laughs] It takes you back to the days of "Born in the U.S.A.," which was so widely misunderstood.<br>
Yeah. I didn't feel that so much from this particular instance, but you 
write the best piece of music you can, and you put it out there, and 
then you see what comes back at you. Lately, it seems as if the 
polarization of the country has gotten so extreme that people want to 
force you into being either a phony "patriot" or an "apologist." Nuanced
 political dialogue or creative expression seems like it's been 
hamstrung by the decay of political speech and it's infantilized our 
national discourse. I can't go for that and I won't write that way.<br>
<br>
What's the thinking behind "Easy Money"?<br>
That's the street criminalization of the big-money Wall Street hustle. 
That's the guy that's saying, "Everybody else is getting theirs, and not
 paying for it, I'm going out to get mine." That hustle has been 
legitimized over the past four years, when you have the level of risk 
and greed at the top of the financial industry, and people basically 
walking away, relatively scot-free, completely unaccountable. That lack 
of accountability is the poison shot straight into the heart of the 
country. It goes back to Watergate. Watergate legitimized the hustle at 
the top of the game – it legitimized every street-corner thug. You 
almost had the country brought down by it, basically. All the radical 
hippies, longhairs – no one ever came as close to sinking the USA as the
 guys in the pinstriped suits.<br>
<br>
You cannot have a social contract with the enormous income disparity – 
you're going to slice the country down the middle. Without jobs, without
 helping folks with foreclosures, without regulating the banks, without 
some sort of tax reform . . . Mitt Romney paid 15 percent tax? Without 
addressing those issues in some way, I don't think the country is going 
to hold together. I understand the effects of globalization, I 
understand all that, but at the end of the day, you can't have a society
 and you can't have a civilization without a reasonable amount of 
economic fairness, full employment, purpose and civic responsibility.<br>
<br>
You've been writing about poor men wanting to be rich, rich men wanting 
to be king since the Seventies. That's what I like about what you were 
saying earlier – there's a certain universality to it that's ageless. 
The motivations don't seem to change.<br>
For the majority of my lifetime, you saw an increase in inequality. It 
has only been in the news since Occupy Wall Street, but it was something
 that was a long, long time coming, and I think that, for better or for 
worse, I experienced the dynamic as a child, and it was something that I
 never forgot. I experienced what happens when, say, the male figure in 
your house struggles to work, can't find work, and the woman in the 
house becomes the primary breadwinner. That was my house.<br>
<br>
That's happening in homes all across America right now: guys that worked
 outside, guys that worked construction, guys that worked manufacturing,
 particularly those kinds of guys, suddenly those jobs disappeared. 
Their attitude, their education may not be suited immediately for the 
service economy – the economy now. It's been devastating on middle-class
 and blue-collar men, particularly. That was my story, that was the 
story I've written about. I've written about that story for 30 years, 
because I lived that story as a child, and I witnessed it day after day 
after day, and I saw its effects. I saw the crisis that it creates. I 
saw the loss of your sense of masculinity. It was a wrenching thing to 
watch for a child, a young child, on a daily basis, and it never, ever 
let up.<br>
I think people would look at it and go, "Jeez, you have all the creature
 comforts, how do you understand that?"But it's clearly something that 
was imprinted on you genetically in your soul. It just doesn't matter.<br>
We talk, we write, we think, and even as late in the day as I am, we 
experience so much through the veil of the formative years of our life. 
That never goes away.<br>
<br>
I have a metaphor. I say, "Look, you're in a car, your new selves can 
get in, but your old selves can't get out." You can bring new vision and
 guidance into your life, but you can't lose or forget who you've been 
or what you've seen. New people can get in, but nobody ever gets out: 
The child from 1950, he doesn't get out. The teenager, the adolescent 
boy, no one can get out. They are with you until the end of the ride, 
and you're going to pass a certain amount of them on.<br>
<br>
And they exert an amazing amount of influence.<br>
The key is, of course, who's driving. On any given day, you're hoping 
that one of your better angels is at the wheel. That's not necessarily 
always the case, but that's what you work toward. Why do you always hear
 of the tycoon hoarding Kleenex, like they are the last he's ever going 
to see? Why is my mother-in-law switching out all the lights in her 
house? She came up through the Depression, when those fucking lights had
 to go out, and you used the one that you needed. These enormous 
economic shifts imprint people at an incredibly deep level. People who 
are going through the pain of this one, it's a life-changer – it will 
change the way you grow up and the way you think for the rest of your 
life for the people who are suffering through this one.<br>
<br>
You lose trust.<br>
And that stays with you even if the economy gets better, even if you get
 a better break. The cumulative effect of these kinds of recessions and 
this kind of punishment of people is so deep, and so those things are 
always there.<br>
<br>
So how does that shape your work?<br>
For me, it's the thing that pisses you off the most, the thing you want 
to fix the most, right? They're the things you want to heal the most, 
they're the things you want to repair the most. They're what obsess you,
 and what makes your art interesting to other people: "What's that thing
 eating at that guy?" Hank Williams, all the people I love the most, had
 something eating at them that they just couldn't shake off. That makes 
for interesting work and an interesting life, if you shape it correctly.
 That, for me, has been lifelong. Occasionally, you come upon a moment 
in time when you're really able to push up against it, where there's 
something out there for you to really push up against. And this last 
decade, there's been a lot of that. That was the case with The Rising 
and with Magic, which was a record about the Bush presidency. And this 
record, in a funny way, is an opportunity – an opportunity to bring the 
questions that have obsessed me for a large part of my life to the 
forefront. The problem we're having right now is that those questions 
aren't being pushed to the forefront on a national level – they're just 
beginning to really be voiced. I think Occupy Wall Street has given the 
president some elbow room where he can talk about income equality, talk 
about programs that would help the folks that have been hit the hardest,
 but it's just the very, very beginning. I think that is a moment that's
 here, and you have to give credit to the folks at Occupy Wall Street 
for changing the national discussion, which I really believe that they 
did.<br>
<br>
As dark as this record gets, there's a sense of hope by the end.<br>
All of these issues aren't going to be solved immediately, obviously. I 
have faith that through pressing on and through paying attention and 
listening and being vigilant and voicing your concerns and insisting 
that the right thing be done, you can move your world inches closer to 
where you want it to be for your children. You have to have faith in 
that. You have to have a clear eye, but you still have to have an open 
heart and mind. Because you have to have spirit, you have to have the 
soul.<br>
<br>
If you look at the character in "Jack of All Trades" or when you move to
 "Rocky Ground" and those voices, they're resilient voices, and voices 
that go on through the next generation. When you get to the end of the 
record, the voices are really coming from the other world, they're 
coming from beyond the grave. In "We Are Alive," those are voices of 
people who have died, and even "Land of Hope and Dreams" – something 
that I wrote 10 years ago – gives voice to those spirits.<br>
<br>
I love that song. How did you come to include it?<br>
This was funny, because I wrote everything else on the album, and I did 
not have an end. I stopped somewhere around "Rocky Ground" and I said, 
"Where do you take this? How do you turn this into something that 
provides both clarity and inspiration?" Because that, along with fun and
 entertainment, is what I think my job is. So I sat around and I had 
"Land of Hope and Dreams," and that was a song I wrote when the E Street
 Band got back together again in 1998. I wrote it before the tour as the
 band's current manifesto. In other words, we have stood for these 
things in the past. This is our current statement of how we will try to 
stand for these things in the future. That's what our band is about.<br>
<br>
But it was a funny song because the voices in it sort of do come from 
beyond the current moment, they're talking about that other world: 
"People, get ready, there's a train coming" – everybody knows what that 
refers to. It refers to both something that's present, whether it's a 
train of equality, justice, fairness, whatever, good times, joy, 
struggle – that train is coming into your life every single day of your 
life. And then there's the train that you hop on maybe when that train 
has passed. It's the train that you're riding, your children are going 
to ride long after you're gone, and there was a deep sense of that in 
the gospel church, and in the black community, that forged an enormous 
character and toughness. So for me, you're talking about that, too. It's
 the train that keeps going when I'm gone, and when your music and these
 times are just a memory. . . . These ideas are something that I wanted 
at the end of this record. We had a difficult time recording it, because
 we had a very good live version of it, so I had to find a way to 
reinvent it, rhythmically, and once again, I have to give credit to the 
fella that produced it with me, Ron Aniello, and Jon Landau, who also 
contributed an enormous amount to this record.<br>
<br>
After that, the record ends with "We Are Alive." How did that one come together?<br>
When I got there, I needed one more song – I needed a strange kind of 
party. And "We Are Alive" provides that. It's a party filled with 
ghosts. It's a party filled with the dead, but whose voices and spirit 
and ideas remain with us and go on and on. That's why I talk about the 
girls in Birmingham, the workers in Maryland and the new immigrants 
crossing the southern border. It's just the recurrence and how the blood
 and spirit of all those people regenerate the country and what America 
is, generation after generation, so I end the record with a party of 
ghosts. Ghosts who are speaking to the living.<br>
<br>
Throughout this album, you get a taste of many different Springsteen 
flavors. You have so many different constituencies that want so many 
different things from you. How do you deal with that?<br>
Generally I do what I like at any given moment and let the people find 
out where they fit in. The only thing I do keep in mind is that I'm in 
the midst of a lifetime conversation with my audience, and I'm trying to
 keep track of that conversation. Martin Scorsese once said that "your 
job is to make your audience care about your obsessions." So if the 
artist loses track of the conversation he's having with his audience, he
 may lose us forever. So I try to keep track of that conversation, while
 giving myself the musical freedom I need.<br>
<br>
You don't want to shut people out.<br>
No. I see the cops, the firefighters, the construction workers, the 
conservative guys, the Republicans, the Democrats. My family is filled 
with Republicans and Democrats, every Sunday night at the table, and so 
it's not hung there on anybody's political hat. I want people to just 
experience it as their own, and see where their ideas and their feelings
 fit inside of it. Its independence means a lot, because I respect the 
audience that comes to see me. I want them to be able to hear it as 
clearly as they can. I don't want the horse to follow the cart.<br>
<br>
Has that gotten harder as the times have gotten more divided? As you 
find that the partisan voices are getting more shrill, is it harder to 
put something out and feel like it lives beyond that conversation, and 
it can be the conversation you want to have?<br>
The conversation I want to have with the audience is just the one that I
 want to have. There's also the one they're having with themselves, the 
one they're having with their buddy, the one they're having with their 
wife. It's a wide-open playing field. We've been onstage and we've been 
booed by our own crowd.<br>
<br>
I've been there.<br>
I mentioned Bush being impeached at the Meadowlands in 2000-something, and some people booed, and that's fine.<br>
<br>
A conversation can be an argument. That's the thing I don't understand. 
That's what Thanksgiving is for – you sit and you and your family argue 
out all different points of view, but you still love each other.<br>
Yeah. I'm proud of our band in that we've maintained an audience who 
want to listen to us, in the sense that they're interested in not just 
what you were saying in '85 or '80, but interested in what we're saying 
right now – what's the next step we're going to take together, what are 
we going to argue about, what are we going to debate the meaning of?<br>
How consciously did you translate some of your political ideas into songs?<br>
It's not something you can do when you push a button. You sit down, and 
if you're lucky, the planets have aligned to the point where that anger 
and the craft you've learned combines with whatever that mysterious X 
factor is that allows you to scoop some of it up – and it turns into a 
piece of music. Before this record, I recorded almost 40 songs for 
another record I was working on that had nothing to do with any of this,
 and at one point, I threw it out. I said, "This is the wrong voice for 
me right now."<br>
<br>
[Deliberately meek] Can I hear that one too, sometime?<br>
[Laughs] I hope so. I hope I wasn't wasting my time. I spent a good 
amount of time doing it. I spent almost a year writing and recording it.
 But the songs had nothing to do with what was going on out there at 
all. They were more like, for lack of a better word, solo, a little 
quieter, and at the end of the day I sat back and looked at it and 
couldn't get an album out of it. So I put that aside and cut this 
record, basically 10 songs in 10 days. You hit something, it's like a 
visitation, you are up at night, the guitar sits at the foot of the bed,
 you're up at 4 a.m., you have the book nearby, you have the tape 
recorder, and this goes on for maybe a week and a half or two weeks, and
 then it stops, it's done. Once in a great while, that happens. So this 
record, I went in every day and recorded a different one of these songs,
 10 days in a row. It was because I felt I really had something, once I 
asked the right questions, the questions of "We Take Care of Our Own." 
Once I asked those questions, it helped me lock into the rest of the 
record. You know it when you catch a wave.<br>
<br>
I used to love that feeling, nothing better than waking up to a joke. You wake up and go, "Shit, it's right there." It's great.<br>
And then if you take that joke and you've been able to integrate it with
 your deepest set of beliefs, it doesn't get any better than that.<br>
<br>
I always wondered, it' s funny, as much as other people get out of it, 
it's still such an oddly selfish pursuit. It's scratching that itch deep
 inside you.<br>
That's why we're narcissistic, self-serving bastards – our wives will guarantee. But sometimes it works.<br>
<br>
When you're revisited by that muse, is it a welcome friend? Do you ever 
worry, "That was my last visitation – Scrooge, you had three ghosts come
 see you, and that's it"?<br>
Here's the thing, I finally talked myself out of that. I remember when I
 wrote The River, I was 30 years old, and I said, "I'm never going to 
write another good song again – that was it, I've peaked, I'm not going 
to write a good song ever again." Then my kids came along, and at some 
point, Patti was assisting me in the fact that I was not as attentive a 
father as I should be, and my argument was, "Don't you understand, I'm 
thinking of a song!"<br>
<br>
You're an artist, you can't be bothered with raising children!<br>
"I'm writing a song right now, I have to lay another golden egg or we're
 all going down, and this whole place, this is all sinking!" One day I 
realized, "Wait, I've got it, I've got more music in my head than I'm 
going to live to put out." But your son or your daughter, they're going 
to be gone tomorrow, or the day after. I realized, "This is what's going
 to be gone, and this is what's going to always be here, not the other 
way around." Music and art are always flowing through the ether – 
they'll always be there – but life, life moves on and is gone. Life is 
locked in an eternal dance with time, and unlike art and time, the two 
can't be separated.<br>
<br>
After I realized that, I relaxed. Now if I'm humming something and I 
don't have a recorder, maybe I'll hum it again a little differently 
later. If I have an idea, it will come back. What's happened is it's 
percolated up in you and become concrete. Once it's grown, it's there. 
But it took me a long time to realize that, just because the fear of not
 telling another funny joke or writing another song is based in simple 
self-loathing. Which can come in handy.<br>
<br>
Everybody's first song, first joke, is "This is who I am, this is where I
 was raised, this is who my parents are." Then you exhaust that, and are
 faced with "What do I write about now?" And you begin to look out. But 
that transition is a very tough one to make.<br>
It really depends on where it takes you. It depends on how hard you're 
paying attention. When I see performers who feel like they've lost their
 mojo, sometimes it's that they're just not paying hard enough 
attention. Your willingness to think hard about things and to remain 
interested in the world around you is really essential as you go on.<br>
<br>
Personally, how are you dealing with the loss of Clarence?<br>
Losing Clarence was like losing the rain. You're losing something that 
has been so elemental in your life for such a long time. It was like 
losing some huge part of your own psychic construction – suddenly it's 
just gone, everything feels less. Our relationship was just this 
immediate chemical connection that happened that first night in Asbury, 
as he was walking toward the stage: "Here comes my guy."<br>
<br>
Love at first sight.<br>
Yeah, for me, anyway. Actually, the first time I asked him to join the band, he said he already had a job.<br>
<br>
"Sounds great, but, no, man, I don't think I can swing that."<br>
Yeah, he was playing with Norman Seldin and the Joyful Noyze, and I 
didn't have a record deal or any immediate prospects. My recollection – 
and Clarence's might have been different over the years – was he said, 
"I don't know, I have a steady gig, I'm enjoying that," then he 
disappeared.<br>
<br>
I turned the record in to Columbia Records, and Clive Davis gave it back
 to me and said that there was nothing that could get played on the 
radio. My recollection is I went to the beach and I wrote "Spirit in the
 Night" and "Blinded by the Light," and then we found Clarence somehow. 
Garry Tallent had played with him in a band called Little Melvin and the
 Invaders, which was an all-black band that played in the black clubs 
around Asbury Park – Clarence was the saxophonist and Garry was the only
 white member and bassist.<br>
<br>
We were always trying to track Clarence down – he was this mysterious 
figure that you couldn't quite get your hands on. We found him for the 
last two songs on Greetings From Asbury Park. He came in and laid down 
the magic, and I said, "Yeah, that's my sound." I said, "I'm going to go
 on tour," and he said, "I'm ready," and that was when we connected.<br>
<br>
So even though we got up and played together that first night and it 
felt like magic, he was a little hesitant at first, because he had a 
steady job, and that was not to be undervalued at the time, because no 
one else did. Also, he had a very different life already – he had two 
children. He might have been divorced, so he had payments. He was in the
 adult world in the sense that he was a social worker at the Jamesburg 
youth reformatory. He worked as a counselor with the boys there.<br>
I played at the boys' facility there around that time! I was in a band, 
and I played for the fellas at the academy. We played big-band music – I
 was nine or 10. I played trumpet. I can't believe I haven't laid down 
tracks for you yet. We played all those songs like "In the Mood" and 
"Take the 'A' Train" and "Golden Earrings."<br>
Can you still play that thing?<br>
<br>
The embouchure is slightly out of shape thanks to the years of smoking, 
but I imagine I could do a few lip-ups and have myself back in shape in 
no time.<br>
We have a horn section. We're ready for you.<br>
<br>
It must be a strange thing – to lose something that can t be replaced, 
and to find yourself in this position of other people saying, "So how 
are you going to replace that?"<br>
Yeah. We're not the first band that's had to deal with that issue. 
That's just the way that it is. In Clarence and my case, we were not 
just in a band together – we were a real duo, a team that existed not 
only within the structure of the E Street Band, but also apart from it 
as something powerful in and of itself. That's something and someone you
 don't replace, not 40 years of it. You just have to give thanks that it
 was a part of your life, that he was a part of my life, and honor what 
we did together.<br>
<br>
You make that part of the conversation you're having with your audience.<br>
You have no other choice. And that's what we're going to do when we go 
out this time. It's just a question of how you address it. We wanted 
people who were close to home, people who understood the band, not 
necessarily somebody who could play rings around the moon – all our guys
 are great players, but it's not what we're about. It was about how well
 you understand who we are and what we do and what we're trying to do. 
We were very, very lucky, and we had Eddie Mani on, who worked with 
Southside Johnny over the years. He's worked with me in the Seeger 
Sessions Band, he played with the E Street Band back in 1988, and we had
 Jake Clemons, Clarence's nephew. Jake traveled with us on the last tour
 for quite a while with "C" – he'd picked up the saxophone as a 
youngster after he came to a show in 1988 and saw his uncle.<br>
<br>
That's how he got into it?<br>
Yeah. He's been a musician most of his life and has worked really hard. 
Between those two guys – and we have an excellent horn section we're 
going to bring out this time – I feel really comfortable with how it's 
going.<br>
<br>
I imagine musicians having that mentality of "Go on without me – I'm down, I can't keep going, but go on without me!"<br>
I've seen some funny moments onstage. I've seen Max [Weinberg] 
stretchered into his dressing room, neck bolted down, and two hours 
later, in the middle of "Badlands," playing like a banshee. I know what 
it took for him. I've seen the guys do some strange and funny things. At
 the end of the day, a show is just a show. It's an act of theater, it's
 pretend, it's as deeply rooted in reality and real feelings as you can 
make it, but it's a performance, and life and the things we've 
experienced the past couple of years, they're bigger and broader than 
that. They're real friendships you have with all these folks that were 
not part of what people saw – that were part of some mystical, strange 
chemical alchemy that you had with this person. I was my son Evan's age 
when I met Clarence, 22. And I'm 62, right? So there was a huge 
relationship that occurred beyond our audience's imaginations and 
dreams.<br>
<br>
So I'm looking forward to the shows being a happy thing, a sad and happy
 thing. Like I said, people need to miss Clarence. I need to miss him, 
too. That's what's going to happen.<br>
<br>
Do you have an idea for yourself of where this conversation is going? 
Are there conversations you've wanted to wrap up with the audience that 
you haven't had a chance to?<br>
It's never going to be wrapped up. You're never going to hear anything 
called an E Street Band farewell tour – that's never going to exist. It 
just goes until it stops, and then it keeps going.<br>
<br>
It doesn't even stop then.<br>
No.<br>
<br>
You can still get stimulated by things artistically. Do those things 
have to be greater and greater to break through to you, or is the muse 
still tuned as finely as it was?<br>
You just have to be living and listening. I don't have a wide knowledge 
of hip-hop – I listen to some, I have a glancing knowledge of it – but 
it found its way into this record. You have to let it impact you. You 
have to be open and see the value, hear what magic it holds, and 
somewhere down the line, maybe years later, suddenly there's a little 
spot in your song where you go, "I know what this needs," and it's there
 for you. Listening, paying attention, being open – that's supposed to 
be the natural development of adulthood.<br>
<br>
What's the development of adulthood? I knew it was something.<br>
It's supposed to be how we broaden and move into adulthood. We're 
supposed to be picking up as we go – a larger experience of our world. 
It's something I've tried to facilitate through what I've done – broaden
 people's perspective, broaden people's vision and assist people in 
seeing through to, for lack of a better word, the inner reality of 
things. Your show is basically an interpretive media class.<br>
<br>
That may be the nicest thing anyone's ever said about our show.<br>
That's one of the things it is. That did not exist, in that form, until 
you did it. You have to go back to some of the early stand-up, Mort Sahl
 . . .<br>
<br>
It's funny – what you were saying about how that song could have been 
sung in the 1800s, I feel that way about "The Daily Show." There have 
always been people who do this, we're just using the form and technology
 that exist now to express it.<br>
This is what the guys at Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers forgot. They 
forgot that they are a part of a continuum of history, and it's not 
about the fucking buck that you make today at whoever's fucking expense.
 If there's not a sense of continuity, a sense of some sort of communal 
obligation and responsibility, a sense of a future involved in what 
you're doing, and a sense of being beholden to the past, you end up 
being one shallow, greedy motherfucker, just trying to get all you can 
get.<br>
<br>
Now that's a name for a song, "Shallow Greedy Motherfuckers."<br>
I had that one, but I left it off.<br>
<br>
I love that you've never let the tail wag the dog, which is pretty 
surprising for a guy in rock &amp; roll. I never saw you in a Ziggy 
Stardust suit – you were never that guy.<br>
I would have looked completely ridiculous in it. Any time I tried to put
 anything on other than the boring things that I still wear, I just, for
 some reason, looked ridiculous. I wish I could have carried a little 
more flash.<br>
<br>
Whatever you were wearing during those times, I can remember me and my 
friends hearing you and thinking, "Oh, we're not alone. It feels like 
this guy knows us." Maybe that's the magic of the conversation.<br>
At the end of the day, that's what it's all about. When I did your show,
 that's the experience I'm having. It's like, "Oh, my God, an island of 
sanity."<br>
<br>
[Pause]<br>
I think this is when we should kiss and hug [laughs].<br>

<br>
What does it mean, Springsteen asked, to be an American?<br>
<br>
by: Mikal Gilmore<br>
<br>
On the night of November 5th, 1980, Bruce Springsteen stood onstage in 
Tempe, Arizona, and began a fierce fight for the meaning of America. The
 previous day, the nation had turned a fateful corner: With a stunning 
majority, Ronald Reagan — who campaigned to end the progressive dream in
 America — was elected president of the United States. It was hardly an 
unexpected victory. In the aftermath of Vietnam, Watergate, the hostage 
crisis in Iran and an economic recession, America developed serious 
doubts about its purpose and its future, and to many voters, Reagan 
seemed an inspiring solution. But when all was said and done, the 
election felt stunning and brutal, a harbinger of the years of 
mean–spiritedness to come.<br>
<br>
The singer was up late the night before, watching the election returns, 
and stayed in his hotel room the whole day, brooding over whether he 
should make a comment on the turn of events. Finally, onstage that night
 at Arizona State University, Springsteen stood silently for a moment, 
fingering his guitar nervously, and then told his audience: "I don't 
know what you guys think about what happened last night, but I think 
it's pretty frightening." Then he vaulted into an enraged version of his
 most defiant song, "Badlands."<br>
<br>
On that occasion, "Badlands" stood for everything it had always stood 
for — a refusal to accept life's meanest fates or most painful 
limitations — but it also became something more: a warning about the 
spitefulness that was about to visit our land as the social and 
political horizon turned dark and frightening. "I wanna spit in the face
 of these badlands," Springsteen sang with an unprecedented fury on that
 night, and it was perhaps in that instant that he reconceived his role 
in rock &amp; roll.<br>
<br>
In a way, his action foreshadowed the political activism that would 
transform rock &amp; roll during the 1980s. As the decade wore on, 
Springsteen would become one of the most outspoken figures in pop music,
 though that future probably wasn't what he had in mind that night. 
Instead, Springsteen was simply focusing on a question that, in one form
 or another, his music had been asking all along: What does it mean to 
be born an American?<br>
<br>
Well, what does it mean to be born in America? Does it mean being born 
to birthrights of freedom, opportunity, equity and bounty? If so, then 
what does it mean that many of the country's citizens never truly 
receive those blessings? And what does it mean that in a land of such 
matchless vision and hope, the acrid realities of fear, repression, 
hatred, deprivation, racism and sexism also hold sway? Does it mean, 
indeed, that we are living in badlands?<br>
<br>
Questions of this sort — about America's nature and purpose, about the 
distance between its ideals and its truths — are, of course, as old as 
the nation itself, and finding revealing or liberating answers to those 
questions is a venture that has obsessed (and eluded) many of the 
country's worthiest artists, from Nathaniel Hawthorne to Norman Mailer, 
from John Ford to Francis Coppola. Rock &amp; roll — an art form born of
 a provocative mix of American myths, impulses and guilts — has also 
aimed, from time to time, to pursue those questions, to mixed effect. In
 the 1960s, in a period of intense generational division and political 
rancor, Bob Dylan and the Band, working separately and together, 
explored the idea of America as a wounded family in albums like The 
Basement Tapes, John Wesley Harding and The Band; in the end, though, 
artists shied from the subject, as if something about the American 
family's complex, troubled blood ties proved too formidable. Years 
later, Neil Young (like the Band's Robbie Robertson, a Canadian obsessed
 by American myths) confronted the specter of forsworn history in works 
like American Stars 'n' Bars, Hawks and Doves and Freedom. Yet, like too
 many other artists or politicians who have come face to face with how 
America has recanted its own best promises, Young finally didn't seem to
 know what to say about such losses. In some ways, Elvis Presley, a 
seminal figure for Springsteen, came closest to embodying the meaning of
 America in his music. That's because he tried to seize the nation's 
dream of fortune and make himself a symbol of it. It's also because once
 Presley had that dream, the dream found a way of undoing him — leading 
him to heartbreak, decline, death. American callings, American fates.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen followed his own version of the fleeting American 
dream. He grew up in the suburban town of Freehold, New Jersey, feeling 
estranged from his family and community, and his refusal to accept the 
limits of that life fueled the songwriting in his early, largely 
autobiographical LPs. Indeed, records like Greetings From Asbury Park, 
N.J., The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle and Born to Run 
were works about flight from dead-end small-town life and thankless 
familial obligations, and they accomplished for Springsteen the very 
dream that he was writing about: That is, those records lifted him from a
 life of mundane reality and delivered him to a place of bracing 
purpose. From the outset, Springsteen was heralded by critics as one of 
the brightest hopes in rock &amp; roll — a songwriter and live performer
 who was as alluring and provoking as Presley and as imaginative and 
expressive as Dylan. And Springsteen lived up to the hoopla: With his 
1975 album, Born to Run, Springsteen fashioned pop's most 
form-stretching and eventful major work since the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's
 Lonely Hearts Club Band. But for all the praise and fame the album won 
him, it couldn't rid Springsteen of his fears of solitude, and it 
couldn't erase his memory of the lives of his family and friends. 
Consequently, his next LP, Darkness on the Edge of Town, was a stark and
 often bitter reflection on how a person could win his dreams and yet 
still find himself dwelling in a dark and lonely place — a story of 
ambition and loss as ill-starred and deeply American as Citizen Kane.<br>
<br>
With The River, released in 1980, Springsteen was still writing about 
characters straining against the restrictions of their world, but he was
 also starting to look at the social conditions that bred lives split 
between the dilemmas of flight and ruin. In Springsteen's emerging 
mythos, people still had big hopes, but they often settled for 
delusional loves and fated family lives. In the album's haunting title 
song, the youthful narrator gets his girlfriend pregnant and then enters
 a joyless marriage and a toilsome job in order to meet his obligations.
 Eventually, all the emotional and economic realities close in, and the 
singer's marriage turns into a living, grievous metaphor for lost 
idealism. "Now, all them things that seemed so important," sings 
Springsteen. "Well, mister, they vanished right into the air/Now I just 
act like I don't remember/Mary acts like she don't care." In The River's
 murky and desultory world, people long for fulfillment and connections,
 but as often as not they end up driving empty mean streets in 
after–midnight funks, fleeing from a painful nothingness into a more 
deadening nothingness.<br>
<br>
The River was Springsteen's pivotal statement. Up to that point, he had 
told his tales in florid language, in musical settings that were 
occasionally operatic and showy. Now he was streamlining both the lyrics
 and the music into simpler, more colloquial structures, as if the 
realities he was trying to dissect were too bleak to support his earlier
 expansiveness. The River was also the record with which Springsteen 
began wielding rock &amp; roll less as a tool of personal mythology than
 as a means of looking at history, as a way of understanding how the 
lives of the people in his songs were shaped by the conditions 
surrounding them and by historical forces beyond their control.<br>
<br>
This drive to comprehend history came to the fore during the singer's 
remarkable 1980-1981 tour in support of The River. Springsteen had never
 viewed himself as a political-minded performer, but a series of events 
and influences — the near–disaster at the Three Mile Island nuclear 
reactor and his subsequent participation in the No Nukes benefit, at New
 York City's Madison Square Garden in September 1979 — began to alter 
that perception. Springsteen read Joe Klein's biography of folk singer 
Woody Guthrie and was impressed with the way popular songs could work as
 a powerful and binding force for political action. In addition, he read
 Ron Kovic's harrowing personal account of the Vietnam War, Born on the 
Fourth of July. Inspired by the candor of Kovic's anguish — and by the 
bravery and dignity of numerous other Vietnam veterans he had met — 
Springsteen staged a benefit at the LA. Sports Arena in August 1981 to 
raise funds and attention for the Vietnam Veterans of America. On one 
night of the Los Angeles engagement, Springsteen told his audience that 
he had recently read Henry Steele Commager and Allan Nevins's Short 
History of the United States and that he was profoundly affected by the 
book. A month earlier, speaking of the same book, he had told a New 
Jersey audience: "The idea [of America] was that there'd be a place for 
everybody, no matter where you came from . . . you could help make a 
life that had some decency and dignity to it. But like all ideals, that 
idea got real corrupted . . . I didn't know what the government I lived 
under was doing. It's important to know . . . about the things around 
you." Now, onstage in Los Angeles, getting ready to sing Woody Guthrie's
 "This Land Is Your Land," Springsteen spoke in a soft, almost bashful 
voice as he told his audience: "There's a lot in [the history of the 
United States . . . that you're proud of, and then there's a lot of 
things in it that you're ashamed of. And that burden, that burden of 
shame, falls down. Falls down on everybody."<br>
<br>
<br>
In 1982, after the tour ended, Springsteen was poised for the sort of 
massive breakthrough that people had been predicting for nearly a 
decade. The River had gone to the top of Billboard's albums chart, and 
"Hungry Heart" was a Top Ten single; it seemed that Springsteen was 
finally overcoming much of the popular backlash that had set in several 
years earlier, after numerous critics hailed him as rock &amp; roll's 
imminent crown prince. But after the tour, the singer was unsure about 
what direction he wanted to take in his songwriting. He spent some time 
driving around the country, brooding, reading, thinking about the 
realities of his own emotional life and the social conditions around 
him, and then he settled down and wrote a body of songs about his 
ruminations. On January 3rd, 1982, Springsteen sat in his home and 
recorded a four-track demo cassette of the new songs, accompanied for 
the most part only by his ghostly sounding acoustic guitar. He later 
presented the songs to Jon Landau and the E Street Band, but neither 
Landau nor the musicians could find the right way to flesh out the 
doleful, spare-sounding new material. Finally, at Landau's behest, 
Springsteen released the original demo versions of the songs as a solo 
effort, entitled Nebraska. It was unlike any other work in pop-music 
history: a politically piercing statement that was utterly free of a 
single instance of didactic sloganeering or ideological proclamation. 
Rather than preach to or berate his listeners, Springsteen created a 
vivid cast of characters — people who had been shattered by bad fortune,
 by limitations, by mounting debts and losses — and then he let those 
characters tell the stories of how their pain spilled over into despair 
and, sometimes, violence.<br>
<br>
There was a timeless, folkish feel to Nebraska's music, but the themes 
and events it related were as dangerous and timely as the daily 
headlines. It was a record about what can occur when normal people are 
forced to endure what cannot be endured. Springsteen's point was that 
until we understood how these people arrived at their places of ruin, 
until we accepted our connection to those who had been hurt or excluded 
beyond repair, America could not be free of such fates or such crimes. 
"The idea of America as a family is naive, maybe sentimental or 
simplistic," he said in a 1987 interview, "but it's a good idea. And if 
people are sick and hurting and lost, I guess it falls on everybody to 
address those problems in some fashion. Because injustice, and the price
 of that injustice, falls on everyone's heads. The economic injustice 
falls on everybody's head and steals everyone's freedom. Your wife can't
 walk down the street at night. People keep guns in their homes. They 
live with a greater sense of apprehension, anxiety and fear than they 
would in a more just and open society. It's not an accident, and it's 
not simply that there are 'bad' people out there. It's an inbred part of
 the way that we are all living: It's a product of what we have 
accepted, what we have acceded to. And whether we mean it or not, our 
silence has spoken for us in some fashion."<br>
'Nebraska' attempted to make a substantial statement about the modern 
American sensibility in an austere style that demanded close 
involvement. That is, the songs required that you settle into their 
doleful textures and racking tales and then apply the hard facts of 
their meaning to the social reality around you. In contrast to 
Springsteen's earlier bravado, there was nothing eager or indomitable 
about Nebraska. Instead, it was a record about people walking the rim of
 desolation who sometimes transform their despair into the irrevocable 
action of murder. It was not exulting or uplifting, and for that reason,
 it was a record that many listeners respected more than they "enjoyed."
 Certainly, it was not a record by which an artist might expand his 
audience in the fun-minded world of pop.<br>
<br>
But with his next record, Born in the U.S.A., in 1984, Springsteen set 
out to find what it might mean to bring his message to the largest 
possible audience. Like Nebraska, Born in the U.S.A. was about people 
who come to realize that life turns out harder, more hurtful, more 
closefisted than they might have expected. But in contrast to Nebraska's
 killers and losers, Born in the USA's characters hold back the night as
 best they can, whether it's by singing, laughing, dancing, yearning, 
reminiscing or entering into desperate love affairs. There was something
 celebratory about how these people face their hardships. It's as if 
Springsteen were saying that life is made to endure and that we all make
 peace with private suffering and shared sorrow as best we can.<br>
<br>
At the same time, a listener didn't have to dwell on these truths to 
appreciate the record. Indeed, Springsteen and Landau designed the album
 with contemporary pop styles in mind — which is to say, it was designed
 with as much meticulous attention to its captivating and lively 
surfaces as to its deeper and darker meanings. Consequently, a track 
like "Dancing in the Dark" — perhaps the most pointed and personal song 
Springsteen has ever written about isolation — came off as a rousing 
dance tune that worked against isolation by pulling an audience together
 in a physical celebration. Similarly, "Cover Me," "Downbound Train" and
 "I'm on Fire" — songs about erotic fear and paralyzing loneliness — 
came off as sexy, intimate and irresistible.<br>
<br>
But it was the terrifying and commanding title song — about a Vietnam 
veteran who has lost his brother, his hope and his faith in his country —
 that did the most to secure Springsteen's new image as pop hero and 
that also turned his fame into something complex and troubling. Scan the
 song for its lyrics alone, and you find a tale of outright devastation:
 a tale of an American whose birthrights have been paid off with 
indelible memories of violence and ruin. But listen to the song merely 
for its fusillade of drums and firestorm of guitar, and in a political 
climate in which simple–minded patriotic fervor had attained a startling
 credibility, it's possible to hear the singer's roaring proclamation — 
"I was born in the U.S.A." — as a fierce, patriotic assertion. Indeed, 
watching Springsteen unfurl the song in concert — slamming it across 
with palpable rage as his audience waved flags of all sizes — it was 
possible to read the song in both directions. "Clearly the key to the 
enormous explosion of Bruce's popularity is the misunderstanding [of the
 song "Born in the U.S.A."]," wrote critic Greil Marcus during the peak 
of Springsteen's popularity. "He is a tribute to the fact that people 
hear what they want."<br>
<br>
One listener who was quite happy to hear only what he wanted to was the 
syndicated conservative columnist George Will, who, in the middle of the
 1984 campaign that pitted Walter Mondale against Ronald Reagan, 
attended a Springsteen show and liked what he saw. In a September 14th, 
1984, column, Will commended Springsteen for his "elemental American 
values" and, predictably, heard the cry of "Born in the U.S.A." as an 
exultation rather than as pained fury. "I have not got a clue about 
Springsteen's politics, if any," Will wrote, "but flags get waved at his
 concerts while he sings about hard times. He is no whiner, and the 
recitation of closed factories and other problems always seem punctuated
 by a grand, cheerful affirmation: 'Born in the U.S.A.!' "<br>
<br>
Apparently, Reagan's advisors gave a cursory listening to Springsteen's 
music and agreed with Will. A few days later, in a campaign stop in New 
Jersey, President Ronald Reagan declared: "America's future rests in a 
thousand dreams inside your hearts. It rests in the message of hope in 
songs of a man so many young Americans admire: New Jersey's Bruce 
Springsteen. And helping you make those dreams come true is what this 
job of mine is all about."<br>
<br>
It was an amazing assertion. Clearly, to anybody paying attention, the 
hard–bitten vision of America that Springsteen sang of in "Born in the 
U.S.A." was a far cry from the much-touted "new patriotism" of Reagan 
and many of his fellow conservatives. And yet there was also something 
damnably brilliant in the way the president sought to attach his purpose
 to Springsteen's views. It was the art of political syllogism, taken to
 its most arrogant extreme. Reagan saw himself as a definitional emblem 
of America; Bruce Springsteen was a singer who, apparently, extolled 
America in his work; therefore, Springsteen must be exalting Reagan — 
which would imply that if one valued the music of Springsteen, then one 
should value (and support) Reagan as well. Reagan was manipulating 
Springsteen's fame as an affirmation of his own ends.<br>
<br>
A few nights later, Springsteen stood before a predominantly blue-collar
 audience in Pittsburgh and, following a rousing performance of 
"Atlantic City," decided to respond to the president's statement. "The 
president was mentioning my name the other day," he said with a bemused 
laugh, "and I kinda got to wondering what his favorite album might have 
been. I don't think it was the Nebraska album. I don't think it was this
 one." Springsteen then played a passionate version of "Johnny 99," a 
song about a man who commits impulsive murder as a way of striking back 
at the meanness of the society around him — a song he wrote, along with 
other Nebraska tunes, in response to the malignant political atmosphere 
that had been fostered by Reagan's social policies.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's comments were apt: Was this the America Ronald Reagan 
heard clearly when he claimed to listen to Springsteen's music? An 
America where dreams of well-being had increasingly become the province 
of the privileged and where jingoistic partisans had determined the 
nation's health by a standard of self–advantage? When Reagan heard a 
song like "My Hometown,'' did he understand his own role in promoting 
the disenfranchisement the song described?<br>
<br>
But Reagan's attempt to co-opt Springsteen's message also had some 
positive side effects. For one thing, it made plain that Springsteen now
 commanded a large and vital audience of young Americans who cared 
deeply about their families, their futures and their country and that 
Springsteen spoke to — and perhaps for — that audience's values in ways 
that could not be ignored. The imbroglio also forced Springsteen to 
become more politically explicit and resourceful at his performances. 
After Pittsburgh, he began meeting with labor and civil-rights activists
 in most of the cities he played, and he made statements at his shows, 
asking his audience to lend their support to the work of such activists.
 He also spoke out more and more plainly about where he saw America 
headed and how he thought rock &amp; roll could play a part in effecting
 that destiny. One evening in Oakland, when introducing "This Land Is 
Your Land," he said: "If you talk to the steelworkers out there who have
 lost their jobs, I don't know if they'd believe this song is what we're
 about anymore. And maybe we're not. As we sit here, [this song's 
promise] is eroding every day. And with countries, as with people, it's 
easy to let the best of yourself slip away. Too many people today feel 
as if America has slipped away and left them standing behind." Then he 
sang the best song written about America, in as passionate a voice as it
 had ever been sung.<br>
<br>
But none of this was enough. In November 1984, Ronald Reagan was 
reelected president by an even more stunning mandate than the first 
time. It seemed plausible that many (if not most) of the millions of 
fans of voting age who made Born in the U.S.A. such a huge success cast 
their votes for the man to whom Springsteen so obviously stood in 
opposition. Perhaps it nettled him, but Springsteen was finally facing 
the answer to the question he had been asking during the length of the 
decade: To be born in America, to be passionate about the nation's best 
ideals, meant being part of a nation that would only believe about 
itself what it wanted to believe. It also meant that one still had to 
find a way to keep faith with the dream of that nation, despite the 
awful realities that take shape when that dream is denied.<br>
In 1984, America had not had enough of Ronald Reagan, or it would not 
have reelected him. It had also not had enough of Bruce Springsteen: 
After an international tour, he returned to the States a bigger, more 
popular artist than ever. It may seem like a contradiction that a nation
 can embrace two icons that differed so dramatically, but the truth is, 
Reagan and Springsteen shared an unusual bond: Each seemed to stand for 
America, and yet each was largely misunderstood by his constituency. 
Reagan seemed to stand for the values of family and improved opportunity
 at the same time that he enacted policies that undermined those values.
 Springsteen seemed to stand for brazen patriotism when he believed in 
holding the government responsible for how it had corrupted the nation's
 best ideals and promises.<br>
<br>
To his credit, Springsteen did his best to make his true values known. 
In the autumn of 1985, he embarked on the final leg of his Born in the 
USA. tour, this time playing stadium-size venues that held up to 100,000
 spectators. Playing such vast settings was simply a way of keeping 
faith with the ambition he had settled on a year or two earlier: to see 
what it could mean to reach the biggest audience he could reach. It was 
also an attempt to speak seriously to as many of his fans as possible, 
to see if something like a genuine consensus could be forged from the 
ideals of a rock &amp; roll community. And of course, the gesture also 
entailed a certain risk: If Springsteen's audience could not — or would 
not — accept him for what he truly stood for, then in the end he could 
be reduced by that audience.<br>
<br>
In some surprising respects, Springsteen's ambition succeeded. At the 
beginning of the stadium swing, many fans and critics worried that he 
would lose much of his force — and his gifts for intimacy and daring — 
by moving his music to such large stages. But if anything, Springsteen 
used the enlarged settings as an opportunity to re-think many of his 
musical arrangements, transforming the harder songs into something more 
fervid, more moving, more aggressive than before and yet still putting 
across the more rueful songs from The River and Nebraska with an 
uncompromised sensitivity. If anything, he made the new shows count for 
more than the election-year shows, if only because he recognized that 
addressing a larger audience necessarily entailed some greater 
responsibilities. In Washington, D.C., on the opening night of the 
stadium shows, Springsteen told a story about a musician friend from his
 youth who was drafted and who, because he did not enjoy the privilege 
of a deferment, was sent to Vietnam and wound up missing in action. "If 
the time comes when there's another war, in some place like Central 
America," Springsteen told his audience of 56,000, "then you're going to
 be the ones called on to fight it, and you're going to have to decide 
for yourselves what that means . . . But if you want to know where we're
 headed for [as a country], then someday take that long walk from the 
Lincoln Memorial to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, where the names of 
all those dead men are written on the walls, and you'll see what the 
stakes are when you're born in the U.S.A. in 1985." For the last dates 
of the tour, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, he added Edwin 
Starr's 1970 hit "War" to the show, coming down hard on the lines 
"Induction, destruction/Who wants to die."<br>
<br>
Later, at the end of the last show in L.A., Springsteen stood before his
 band, his friends and his audience and said: "This has been the 
greatest year of my life. I want to thank you for making me feel like 
the luckiest man in the world." Indeed, Springsteen had begun the tour 
as a masscult figure; he was leaving it as a full-fledged pop hero — a 
voice of egalitarian conscience unlike any that rock had yielded before,
 with a remarkable capacity for growth and endurance.<br>
<br>
In short, Springsteen seemed to emerge from the tour occupying the 
center of rock &amp; roll, in the way that Presley or the Beatles had 
once commanded the center. And yet the truth was, in the pop world of 
the 1980s, there was no center left to occupy. Rock was a field of 
mutually exclusive options, divided along racial, stylistic and 
ideological lines. In fact, by the decade's end, even the American and 
British fields of rock — which had dominated the pop world thoroughly 
for a quarter-century — were gradually losing their purism and dominance
 as more-adventurous musicians began bringing African, Jamaican, 
Brazilian, Asian and other musical forms into interaction with pop's 
various vernaculars. In modern pop, America no longer overwhelmed the 
international sensibility.<br>
<br>
In any event, Springsteen seemed to step back from rock &amp; roll's 
center at the same moment that he won it. In 1986, he assembled a 
multidisc package of some of his best performances from the previous ten
 years of live shows — a box set intended to be a summation of his 
artistic growth and his range as a showman. It was the most ambitious 
effort of his career but also the least consequential. It didn't play 
with the sort of revelatory effect of his best shows or his earlier 
albums, and it didn't captivate a mass audience in the same way, either.
 Then, the following year, Springsteen released the album Tunnel of 
Love. Like Nebraska, Tunnel of Love was a more intimate, less epic 
statement than its predecessor — a heartbreaking but affirming suite of 
songs about the hard realities of romantic love. Maybe the record was 
intended to remind both Springsteen and his audience that what 
ultimately mattered was how one applied one's ideals to one's own world —
 or maybe the songs were simply about the concerns that obsessed 
Springsteen most at that time.<br>
<br>
At the end of the decade, Springsteen was on tour again. Reluctant to 
continue playing oversize venues, he returned to the arena halls where 
he had done some of his most satisfying work in the years before and 
restored a more human scale to his production. It was another election 
year, and while he still spoke out about issues from time to time, 
Springsteen seemed wary of being cast as merely a rock politician or 
statesman. Perhaps he realized that America's political choices just 
couldn't be affected very tellingly from a rock &amp; roll stage, or 
maybe he was simply discouraged by what he saw around him. To be sure, 
there was plenty to be disheartened about: It was a season when Oliver 
North enjoyed status as a cultural hero and when George Bush turned 
patriotism and flag-waving into viciously effective campaign issues.<br>
<br>
At the same time, Springsteen remained committed to the idea of turning 
the rock &amp; roll audience into an enlightened and active community. 
After the Tunnel of Love tour, he headlined Amnesty International's 
Human Rights Now! world tour in the fall of 1988. Along with Live Aid, 
the Amnesty tour was one of the most ambitious political campaigns in 
rock's history. And the fact that it could occur at all and could reach 
an audience that was both massive and ready was in some ways a testament
 to the sort of idealism that Springsteen had fought for throughout the 
1980s.<br>
<br>
Which is to say, despite the currents of history, Springsteen kept faith
 with a difficult quest. In the midst of a confusing and complex decade,
 he wrote more honestly, more intelligently and more compassionately 
about America than any other writer of the decade. And after he did so, 
he set about the business of tending to his own life. An act like that 
is neither a retreat nor a failure. Instead, it is a way of refusing to 
be broken by the dissolution of the world around you. It is a way of 
saying that, sooner or later, you have to bring your dreams of a better 
world into your own home and your own heart, and you have to see if you 
can live up to them. All in all, that isn't such a bad way to finish off
 one decade. Or to begin another.<br>

<br>
To celebrate our twentieth anniversary, 'Rolling Stone' talked with some
 of the people who have helped to shape rock &amp; roll, as well as 
American culture and politics, during the last two decades.<br>
<br>
by: Mikal Gilmore<br>
<br>
The 1960s are often idealized as times of great innocence and wonder. 
Although your own work has been recorded in the Seventies and Eighties, 
some of your best songs seem haunted by the strife of that era. Looking 
back, do you see the Sixties as a period in which a great deal was at 
stake in American culture?<br>
I think that in the Sixties there was a rebellion against what people 
felt was the dehumanization of society, where people were counted as 
less than people, less than human. It was almost as if there were a 
temper tantrum against that particular threat. In the Sixties moral 
lines were drawn relatively easily. "Hey, this is wrong, this is right –
 I'm standing here!" That idea busted up nearly every house in the 
nation. And people expected revolution. I think some people thought it 
was going to happen in an explosive burst of some sort of radical, 
joyous energy, and that all the bullshit and all the Nixons were going 
to be swept away, and, man, we were going to start all over again and do
 it right this time. Okay, that was a childlike fantasy. But a lot of 
those ideas were good ideas.<br>
<br>
It's funny, but because of the naiveness of the era, it's easily 
trivialized and laughed at. But underneath it, I think, people were 
trying in some sense to redefine their own lives and the country that 
they lived in, in some more open and free and just fashion. And that was
 real – that desire was real. But I think that as people grew older, 
they found that the process of changing things actually tends to be 
unromantic and not very dramatic. In fact, it's very slow and very 
small, and if anything, it's done in inches.<br>
<br>
The values from that time are things that I still believe in. I think 
that all my music – certainly the music I've done in the past five or 
six years – is a result of that time and those values. I don't know, it 
seems almost like a lost generation. How do the ideals of that time 
connect in some pragmatic fashion to the real world today? I don't know 
if anybody's answered that particular question.<br>
<br>
One of the central events that inspired the idealism of that era – the 
war in Vietnam – was also the most horrific thing to happen to this 
society in the last twenty years. It tore us apart along political and 
generational lines, but it also drew a hard line across the nation and 
forced many of us to take a clear stand.<br>
That's true: that was the last time things ever felt that morally clear.
 Since then – from Watergate on down – who or what the enemy is has 
grown more obfuscated. It's just too confusing. But you can't wait for 
events like Vietnam, because if you do, then maybe 55,000 men end up 
dying and the country is left changed forever. I mean, that experience 
is still not over. And without those particular memories, without the 
people who were there reminding everybody, it would've happened again 
already, I'm sure. Certainly, it would have happened in the past eight 
years if they thought they could have gotten away with it.<br>
<br>
So what went wrong? Why is it that so few of the brave ideals of those 
times carried over to the social and political realities of today?<br>
I think the problem is that people yearn for simple answers. The reason 
the image of the Reagan presidency is so effective is that it appeared 
to be very simple. I think that's also the whole reason for the 
canonization of Oliver North: he said all the right words and pushed all
 the right buttons. And people yearn for those sorts of simple answers. 
But the world will never ever be simple again, if it ever was. The world
 is nothing but complex, and if you do not learn to interpret its 
complexities, you're going to be on the river without a paddle.<br>
<br>
The classic thing for me is the misinterpretation of "Born in the 
U.S.A." I opened the paper one day and saw where they had quizzed kids 
on what different songs meant, and they asked them what "Born in the 
U.S.A." meant. "Well, it's about my country," they answered. Well, that 
is what it's about – that's certainly one of the things it's about – but
 if that's as far in as you go, you're going to miss it, you know? I 
don't think people are being taught to think hard enough about things in
 general – whether it's about their own lives, politics, the situation 
in Nicaragua or whatever. Consequently, if you do not learn to do that –
 if you do not develop the skills to interpret that information – you're
 going to be easily manipulated, or you're going to walk around simply 
confused and ineffectual and powerless.<br>
<br>
People are being dumped into this incredibly unintelligible society, and
 they are swimming, barely staying afloat, and then trying to catch on 
to whatever is going to give them a little safe ground.<br>
<br>
I guess when I started in music I thought, "My job is pretty simple. My 
job is I search for the human things in myself, and I turn them into 
notes and words, and then in some fashion, I help people hold on to 
their own humanity – if I'm doing my job right."<br>
<br>
You can change things – except maybe you can affect only one person, or 
maybe only a few people. Certainly nothing as dramatic as we expected in
 the Sixties. When I go onstage, my approach is "I'm going to reach just
 one person" – even if there's 80,000 people there. Maybe those odds 
aren't so great, but if that's what they are, that's okay.<br>
<br>
Was that what you had in mind at the end of the last tour, when before 
performing Edwin Starr's "War" you told your audience to think twice 
about committing itself to any of America's future military 
involvements?<br>
With that, I guess we were playing the percentages, you know? [Laughs,] I
 mean, I've met people on the street who I could tell misunderstood my 
work, and I've also met people who have understood it. It was the same 
thing when we'd play in a club – it was just fewer numbers. But when we 
started to do "War," which we only did the last four nights of the whole
 tour, I was looking for some way to reshape that part of the show to 
make it as explicit as I could, without sloganeering. But "War" . . . a 
lot of people heard it, and some people didn't hear it. I'm sure that 
when we're on tour, I'll be singing that song again. And maybe people 
that didn't hear it will hear it differently this time. My job is to try
 to make sure that they do. I never thought, "Well, I'll do this because
 this feels like the right thing to do." I did it because it was the 
only thing that I felt I could do. I think that people get tired and 
frustrated. I learned that again during the week when Oliver North was 
testifying. It was a frustrating time. I was walking around arguing with
 everybody [laughs]. It was like "I don't believe this is happening." It
 reminded me that you've got to wake up in the morning and go to work 
again.<br>
<br>
You keep talking about your involvement in rock &amp; roll as a job. 
That's a far cry from the view that many of us had in the Sixties, when 
we looked upon artists - such as Bob Dylan - not so much as people 
performing a job but as cultural revolutionaries.<br>
Dylan was a revolutionary. So was Elvis. I'm not that. I don't see 
myself as having been that. I felt that what I would be able to do, 
maybe, was redefine what I did in more human terms than it had been 
defined before, and in more everyday terms. I always saw myself as a 
nuts-and-bolts kind of person. I felt what I was going to accomplish I 
would accomplish over a long period of time, not in an enormous burst of
 energy or genius. To keep an even perspective on it all, I looked at it
 like a job – something that you do every day and over a long period of 
time.<br>
<br>
To me, Dylan and Elvis – what they did was genius. I never really saw 
myself in that fashion. I'm sure there was a part of me that was afraid 
of having that kind of ambition or taking on those kinds of 
responsibilities.<br>
Born to Run was certainly an ambitious record. Maybe it wasn't 
revolutionary, but it was certainly innovative: it redefined what an 
album could do in the Seventies.<br>
Well, I was shooting for the moon, you know? I always wanted to do that 
too, on top of it. When I did Born to Run, I thought, "I'm going to make
 the greatest rock &amp; roll record ever made." I guess what I'm saying
 is, later on my perspective changed a bit so that I felt like I could 
maybe redefine what doing the particular job was about. So that it does 
not have to drive you crazy or drive you to drugs or drinking, or you do
 not have to lose yourself in it and lose perspective of your place in 
the scheme of things. I guess I wanted to try and put a little more 
human scale on the thing. I felt that was necessary for my own sanity, 
for one thing.<br>
<br>
I was always afraid of those things, of the forces that you set loose in
 people. In this job, part of what you do is excite people. And you 
don't know what people are going to do when they get excited. My idea 
was that when I went on a stage, I wanted to deliver my best to pull out
 the best in you, whatever that may be. But sometimes you don't do that.
 Sometimes you just pull out someone's insanity – you don't know what 
you're going to pull out or what will come to the surface.<br>
<br>
Your next record, Darkness on the Edge of Town, sounded far less hopeful
 than Born to Run. Several critics attributed the sullen mood to the 
long stall between the records – that ten-month period in which a 
lawsuit prevented you from recording. What really was happening on 
'Darkness'?<br>
That was a record where I spent a lot of time focusing. And what I 
focused on was this one idea: What do you do if your dream comes true? 
Where does that leave you? What do you do if that happens? And I 
realized part of what you have to face is the problem of isolation. You 
can get isolated if you've got a lot of dough or if you don't have much 
dough, whether you're Elvis Presley or whether you're sitting in front 
of the TV with a six-pack of beer. It's easy to get there. On that 
record it was like "Well, what I've done, does it have any greater 
meaning than that I've made a good album and had some luck with it?" I 
was trying to figure out that question, which is really one I'm still 
trying to figure out.<br>
<br>
<br>
James M. Cain once wrote of "the wish that comes true, for some reason a
 terrifying concept." He said that readers realized that "the characters
 cannot have this particular wish and survive." Yet you seem to have 
achieved your wishes without losing your way.<br>
I guess I consider myself one of those people that that happened to. And
 you have to decide: Does that leave you with a certain responsibility? I
 know that before Darkness, I was writing songs where people were trying
 to escape all the time and were also searching. But once that happens, 
once you break those ties to whatever it is – your past – and you get a 
shot out of that community that you came up in, what are you going to do
 then? There is a certain frightening aspect to having things you 
dreamed were going to happen happen, because it's always more – and in 
some ways always less – than what you expected. I think when people 
dream of things, they dream of them without the complications. The real 
dream is not the dream, it's life without complications. And that 
doesn't exist.<br>
<br>
For me, the Seventies were a time I spent dealing with what had happened
 to me and trying to figure out where that fit in with everybody else. 
Because the irony of the entire situation is that the thing you did in 
order to be with people, and to be of use to people, is that same thing 
that – if you do it well enough – ends up making you forever different 
in some fashion. And it isolates you in that way. That was something 
that I was fighting against when I was young, and the way I fought 
against it was with my guitar. I was saying, "Hey, let me in – I got 
something to say, I wanna say it, I wanna talk to somebody."<br>
<br>
I used to think that fame, on its best day, is kind of like a friendly 
wave from a stranger standing by the side of the road. And when it's not
 so good, it's like a long walk home all alone, with nobody there when 
you get there. And I guess what I wanted to figure out is, what happens 
if you dream that dream? What happens if you dream of having some real 
effect on people's lives and then you meet people who say that's what 
you have had?<br>
<br>
I remember the night that I got married. I was standing at the altar by 
myself, and I was waiting for my wife, and I can remember standing there
 thinking, "Man, I have everything. I got it all." And you have those 
moments. But you end up with a lot more than you expected. I guess I 
wouldn't trade it for anything, but it's a strange job, you know?<br>
<br>
On each of your records since Darkness – The River, Nebraska and Born in
 the U.S.A. - you managed to write about hard working-class realities in
 ways that sounded surprisingly immediate, coming from a rich, 
well-known pop star. Was there something about moving into fame and 
wealth that caused you to identify more closely with the world you were 
leaving behind?<br>
I think it's probably a normal reaction. I mean, the circumstances of 
your life are changing, and what they are changing to is unknown to you,
 and you have never known closely anyone else who has had the same 
experience. On one hand you cannot hide in the past. You can't say, 
"Well, I'm the same old guy I used to be." You have to go ahead and meet
 that person who you're becoming and accept whatever that's about. I 
always wanted to live solidly in the present, always remember the past 
and always be planning for the future. So from Darkness to The River, I 
was attempting to pull myself into what I felt was going to be the adult
 world, so that when things became disorienting, I would be strong 
enough to hold my ground. Those were the records where I was trying to 
forge that foundation and maintain my connections and try to say, "Well,
 what is this going to mean? Maybe what this is all going to mean is up 
to me."<br>
With the later records, that resolve seemed to have more and more 
political resonance. In 1979 you took part in the No Nukes benefit 
concert, and in November 1980 you made some scathing remarks onstage in 
Arizona on the evening following Ronald Reagan's election. How did 
events of recent years inspire your new-found political concern and 
awareness?<br>
I think my response was based on an accumulation of things. I never 
considered myself a particularly political person. I wasn't when I was 
younger, and I don't think I really am now. But if you live in a 
situation where you have seen people's lives wasted . . . I think the 
thing that frightened me most was seeing all that waste. There wasn't 
any one specific thing that made me go in that particular direction, but
 it seemed like if you're a citizen, and if you're living here, then 
it's your turn to take out the garbage. Your tour of duty should come 
around.<br>
<br>
It just seemed that people's lives are being shaped by forces they do 
not understand, and if you are going to begin to take a stand and fight 
against those things, you got to know the enemy – and that's getting 
harder to do. People are so easily affected by buzzwords; they're 
getting their button pushed with God, mother, country, apple pie – even 
in soda commercials. And so it's like "Where is the real thing? Where is
 the real America?"<br>
<br>
What's also disturbing is the casualness with which people are getting 
used to being lied to. To me, Watergate felt like this big hustle was 
going down. And in the end it seemed to legitimize the dope dealer down 
on the street. "Hey, the president's doing it, so why can't I?" I guess 
we're pretty much left to find our way on our own these days. That sense
 of community that there was in the Sixties made you feel like there 
were a lot of people along for the ride with you. It felt like the whole
 country was trying to find its way. You do not have a sense that the 
country is trying to find its way today. And that's a shame. As a 
result, I think you feel more on your own in the world today. Certainly,
 I feel more isolated in it.<br>
<br>
Maybe everybody's just got to grab hold of each other. The idea of 
America as a family is naive, maybe sentimental or simplistic, but it's a
 good idea. And if people are sick and hurting and lost, I guess that it
 falls on everybody to address those problems in some fashion. Because 
injustice, and the price of that injustice, falls on everyone's heads. 
The economic injustice falls on everybody's head and steals everyone's 
freedom. Your wife can't walk down the street at night. People keep guns
 in their homes. They live with a greater sense of apprehension, anxiety
 and fear than they would in a more just and open society. It's not an 
accident, and it's not simply that there are "bad" people out there. 
It's an inbred part of the way that we are all living: it's a product of
 what we have accepted, what we have acceded to. And whether we mean it 
or not, our silence has spoken for us in some fashion. But the challenge
 is still there: eight years of Reagan is not going to change that.<br>
<br>
That seemed part of what Nebraska was about: a reaction to the Reagan 
years. Was that how you intended people to see that record?<br>
In a funny way, I always considered it my most personal record, because 
it felt to me, in its tone, the most what my childhood felt like. Later 
on, a bunch of people wrote about it as a response to the Reagan era, 
and it obviously had that connection.<br>
<br>
I think people live from the inside out. Your initial connection is to 
your friends and your wife and your family. From there your connection 
may be to your immediate community. And then if you have the energy and 
the strength, then you say, "Well, how do I connect up to the guy in the
 next state or, ultimately, to people in the world?" I think that 
whatever the political implications of my work have been, they've just 
come out of personal insight. I don't really have a particular political
 theory or ideology. It came from observations, like, okay, this man is 
being wasted. Why is this man being wasted? This person has lost 
himself. Why is that? And just trying to take it from there. How does my
 life interconnect and intertwine with my friends and everybody else? I 
don't know the answers yet. I'm a guitar player – that's what I do.<br>
<br>
But millions of people see you as more than a guitar player. In fact, 
many see you as nothing less than an inspiring moral leader. But there's
 a certain irony to being a modern-day hero for the masses. Back in the 
Sixties nobody ever spoke of the Beatles or the Rolling Stones or Dylan 
as being overexposed. Yet these days, any pop artist who has a major, 
sustained impact on a mass audience runs the risk of seeming either 
overly promoted by the media or too familiar to his audience. In recent 
years, performers like you, Michael Jackson, Prince and Madonna have all
 faced this dilemma. Do you ever feel that you're running the danger of 
overexposure?<br>
Well, what does that mean? What is "overexposed"? It really has no 
meaning, you know? It's kind of a newspaper thing. I just ignore it, to 
be honest with you. I make the best records I can make. I try to work on
 them and put them out when it feels right and they feel like they're 
ready. That's what it is – not whether I'm overexposed or underexposed 
or not exposed. It's like "Hey, put the record on. Is it good? Do you 
like it? Is it rockin' ya? Is it speaking to you? Am I talking to you?" 
And the rest is what society does to sell newspapers or magazines. You 
gotta fill 'em up every month. You have an entire counterlife that is 
attached to your own real life by the slimmest of threads. In the past 
year, if you believe what was in the newspapers about me, I'd be living 
in two houses that I've never seen, been riding in cars that I've never 
had [laughs]. This is just what happens. It's, like, uncontrollable: the
 media monster has to be fed.<br>
<br>
So all that sort of stuff, if you believe that it has anything really to
 do with you, you know, you're gonna go nuts. In the end, people will 
like my records and feel they were true or feel they weren't. They'll 
look at the body of work I've done and pull out whatever meaning it has 
for them. And that's what stands. The rest is transient. It's here today
 and gone tomorrow. It's meaningless. Whether Michael Jackson is 
sleeping in a tank or not, what does it mean to you? It's just a laugh 
for some people; that's all it really is. And I feel like, hey, if it's a
 laugh for you, then have one on me. Because when you reach for and 
achieve fame, one of the byproducts of fame is you will be trivialized, 
and you will be embarrassed. You will be, I guarantee it. I look at that
 as a part of my job. And I ain't seen nothing compared to, you know, if
 you look at Elvis's life or even Michael J.'s. I've had it pretty easy,
 but I know a little bit of what it's about. These things are gonna 
happen, and if you don't have a strong enough sense of who you are and 
what you're doing, they'll kick you in the ass and knock you down and 
have a good time doing it. That's the nature of our society, and it's 
one of the roles that people like me play in society. Okay, that's fine,
 but my feeling is simple: my work is my defense. Simple as that I've 
done things I never thought I'd be able to do, I've been places I never 
thought I'd be. I've written music that is better than I thought I could
 write. I did stuff that I didn't think I had in me.<br>
<br>
You've also come to mean a lot to an awful lot of people.<br>
That's a good thing, but you can take it too far. I do not believe that 
the essence of the rock &amp; roll idea was to exalt the cult of 
personality. That is a sidetrack, a dead-end street. That is not the 
thing to do. And I've been as guilty of it as anybody in my own life. 
When I jumped over that wall to meet Elvis that night [at Graceland], I 
didn't know who I was gonna meet. And the guard who stopped me at the 
door did me the biggest favor of my life. I had misunderstood. It was 
innocent, and I was having a ball, but it wasn't right. In the end, you 
cannot live inside that dream. You cannot live within the dream of Elvis
 Presley or within the dream of the Beatles. It's like John Lennon said:
 "The dream is over." You can live with that dream in your heart, but 
you cannot live inside that dream, because it's a perversion, you know? 
What the best of art says is, it says, "Take this" - this movie or 
painting or photograph or record – "take what you see in this, and then 
go find your place in the world. This is a tool: go out and find your 
place in the world."<br>
<br>
I think I made the mistake earlier on of trying to live within that 
dream, within that rock &amp; roll dream. It's a seductive choice, it's a
 seductive opportunity. The real world, after all, is frightening. In 
the end, I realized that rock &amp; roll wasn't just about finding fame 
and wealth. Instead, for me, it was about finding your place in the 
world, figuring out where you belong.<br>
<br>
It's a tricky balance to do it correctly. You got to be able to hold a 
lot of contradictory ideas in your mind at one time without letting them
 drive you nuts. I feel like to do my job right, when I walk out onstage
 I've got to feel like it's the most important thing in the world. Also I
 got to feel like, well, it's only rock &amp; roll. Somehow you got to 
believe both of those things.<br>

Bruce Springsteen: The Boss Is Back<br>
<br>
He hits the road for his first tour in two years and overcomes the stigma of being an East Coast phenomenon<br>
<br>
by: Fred Schruers<br>
<br>
There are only a couple of small-hall dates on Bruce Springsteen and the
 E Street Band's 1980 tour. In most cities, the only way to meet ticket 
demand is for Springsteen and the gang to play the kinds of huge arenas 
usually reserved for supergroups and pro sports teams. Tonight, 
backstage after an epic four-hour show in the Milwaukee Arena, it smells
 like the latter group has just been through.<br>
<br>
"That's me," says Springsteen of the liniment smell. "I've got that 
stuff all over me. To provide some heat on my back. 'Cause otherwise, in
 three or four hours, I become very similar to this table." His back 
seems pretty tight right now as he leans forward to knock on the wood 
table. He says the stiffness is not from his trademark flying leaps onto
 the speakers. "I think it's just all that breathin'. The whole top of 
your body goes like that," says Bruce, flexing like an already-taut 
bowstring. "It's mental," an admiring insider says later. "It's 
intensity."<br>
<br>
For the past three shows – in Chicago, St. Paul and Milwaukee-the 
intensity has been apparent. (Springsteen, in fact, was having so much 
trouble getting to sleep after the Midwest gigs that he proposed an 
all-night drive to Milwaukee from St. Paul – "The only car for that 
would be a Corvette station wagon," said road manager Bob Chirmside – 
but ended up making the one-hour trip by air on a 4:20 a.m. commercial 
flight.) Springsteen has lent ample life to his performing legend – and 
with thirty-five or so dates to go, is doing a good job of laying to 
rest the stigma of being "an East Coast phenomenon" – playing sold-out 
shows that last a minimum of three and a half hours and are divided into
 two sets by a break that lets both performer and audience rest. The 
group does thirty songs in all, and tonight exactly half of them were 
from Springsteen's new double album, The River.<br>
<br>
During its two years off the road, the band's only public exposure has 
been a segment in the No Nukes concert movie and a couple of songs on 
the album. The absence seems only to have built Springsteen's following,
 for in every "market" in the country, the figures for ticket sales and 
the album – which shipped gold-are flickering faster than the digit 
counters on one of the Boss' beloved pinball machines.<br>
<br>
Cal Levy, from Electric Factory Productions, brought Bruce to 
Cincinnati's Riverfront Coliseum in October; he's been promoting 
concerts in that city since 1975. "In September 1977, Bruce sold 4000 
seats here," The recalls. "In September 1978, he sold 6630. This past 
October 4th, he sold 16.300 seats in two hours and forty minutes. We 
absolutely could have sold out two more shows. I was as surprised as 
anybody. I told [Springsteen's manager] Jon Landau he should treat this 
building like the Roxy [a 500-seat club in L.A. where Bruce did a 
four-night show in 1975] and come in for a week." Similarly, the office 
of Madison Square Garden promoter Ron Delsner was deluged with enough 
ticket requests to fill the 18,000-seat arena for sixteen nights. But 
for Levy, promoter of the December 3rd, 1979, Who concert at which 
eleven kids were trampled to death in a rush for the door, the 
Springsteen show was more than Riverfront Coliseum's first sell-out show
 since that date. "As one local paper put it," Levy explains, "for the 
first time since December 3rd, people didn't have to look over their 
shoulders to enjoy themselves. It was so happy yet so controlled. Bruce 
had those people standing on their seats for the entire show - unless he
 asked them to sit down. It was almost a feeling of being in a 3000-seat
 hall." And as Cincinnati Mayor Jerry Springer said in a radio 
broadcast, "Rock &amp; roll should never be a defendant in the Who case.
 Bruce Springsteen showed us that, and we should be grateful to him."<br>
<br>
Milwaukee had its own concert problems. The bad memory of a riot last 
April, when such "special guests" as Bob Dylan and Mick Jagger failed to
 show up for a New Barbarians concert, had been freshened by a 
concertgoers rampage on Thursday, October 9th, six days before 
Springsteen's date. It seems Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler was 
clocked on the head with a flung beer bottle, and when the rest of the 
band retreated from the stage after him, the crowd trashed the arena. 
Just about every cop in the city was called to what local officials 
called a "miniriot," and some politicians were spoiling to ban rock from
 the 12,000-seat arena.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's representatives thus made a deal to get the band offstage 
no later than 11:15 p.m. (the concert started a half-hour earlier than 
usual), but when the time came, Bruce was cranking out an impromptu, 
rollicking version of "Midnight Hour," and arena president Robert O. 
Ertl was screaming at tour manager George Travis. "Do you want me to 
wave him off now?", Travis asked tranquilly, as one wide swath of kids 
in seats behind the stage swayed back and forth, flinging their hands up
 in unison on every beat. "He'll come off."<br>
<br>
"Oh no, "Ertl remembers saying. "He's got the audience up high, he'll 
have to bring 'em back down." That, admits Ertl, is just what 
Springsteen did – "beautifully." In fact, some Milwaukee officials felt 
that Springsteen's concert took the ammunition away from the city's 
antirock factions.<br>
<br>
Dawn Colla, 27, is a mayoral assistant in Milwaukee who came to the 
arena that night, but she wanted to talk as a fan. She seems to 
represent the large chunk of Springsteen's growing constituency, which 
is described by Cal Levy as "salesmen, lawyers – a very clean crowd." 
Said Colla: "I didn't especially like having this guy at the door say.<br>
<br>
'Sorry, babe, gotta look in your purse,' but they were frisking 
everybody. I don't think there's anybody else who could get me and 
twelve of my friends out. We're all in our late twenties. I'm past going
 to rock &amp; roll concerts-the last show we all went to was his 1978 
show. But you know the guy's trying to knock himself out in every city. 
He comes out with a double album that costs ten bucks [in fact, 
Springsteen's $15.98-list, twenty-song LP was selling for less than ten 
dollars in many stores] after Fleetwood Mac came out with one for 
fifteen dollars. He doesn't have that phoniness so many acts have. 
There's a lot of good rock &amp; roll, but the guy's also a poet.<br>
<br>
"A lot of the people here are real fans. They're tuned into when the sax
 is gonna come in, they know all the words – it's like a reunion. There 
were two kids behind me, eighteen, nineteen, yelling for 'Thunder Road,'
 and they just went crazy when 'Rosalita' began. But I guess I just look
 for the poetry. He's saying to people, 'Open your eyes, you have some 
choices, don't get caught in that group that's gonna be street people 
all their lives.'"<br>
<br>
Springsteen may indeed be one of the few authentic rockers still 
celebrated by the aging gentry who fueled the Sixties rock &amp; roll 
explosion. But neither has he lost touch with the kinds of fans who were
 more than a little put out by the Milwaukee Arena's brand-new ban on 
beer sales. He seemed to please everybody. He opened his show with 
"Prove It All Night," did a ferocious rendition of "Badlands" – 
clutching his guitar across his chest like a priceless talisman as he 
sang the hushed line, "It ain't no sin to be glad you're alive" – and 
ended up in the middle of a happy mob in the arena's fifth row of seats 
to holler "I'm all alone" during "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out."<br>
<br>
"Are ya loose?" Springsteen demanded before going into more somber 
territory with "Darkness on the Edge of Town" and "Factory." "When I 
grew up, I used to watch my father go to work every day to a job he 
hated," he said before "Independence Day." "You're lucky if you got some
 choices." He played the new "Jackson Cage" to the "excitable bunch" in 
the cheaper seats just behind the stage, then moved rapidly through 
"Promised Land" and "Out in the Street" (he had introduced the former 
song to Chicago by asking, "How many of you guys are living away from 
home right now?") and played another new song, "Two Hearts." "Racing in 
the Street" was linked to "The River" by an invocatory few notes from 
Roy [Bruce calls him "Mr. E=MC Squared"] Bittan's piano. Springsteen 
then closed the first half of the show with a flurry of leaps, 
scurryings and knee drops as he and saxman Clarence Clemons played off 
each other on "Thunder Road" and "Jungleland." During the latter song, 
the crowd spilled over far enough to block the view of a kid in a 
wheelchair in the aisle at stage left. Grinning and flinging his hands 
in the air, he didn't seem to mind.<br>
<br>
After the break in Chicago, Bruce had started a dancing frenzy with 
Elvis Presley's "Good Rockin' Tonight," but in Milwaukee, he chose the 
new "Cadillac Ranch." Cupping his hands suggestively to sing "Hey little
 girlie with the blue jeans so tight," he made sure his diction was 
perfect on the next line:<br>
<br>
"Drivin' alone through the ... Wisconsin night...." Milwaukee roared. 
When Clarence interrupted "Fire" to finish "But your heart stays cool" 
in a mellifluous bass voice, Bruce staggered away from the mike, and the
 crowd screamed with abandon during the long, silent tease before both 
men made it back to the mike to sing the song's "Romeo and Juliet" 
verse.<br>
<br>
The moment ushered in six songs from the new LP: "Sherry Darling," "I 
Wanna Marry You" (with a funny spoken intro turning into a beautiful 
vocal round by Bruce, Clarence and "Miami" Steve Van Zandt), "The Ties 
That Bind," "Wreck on the Highway," "Point Blank" and "Crush on You." 
Springsteen flung his guitar to Clarence early in the latter song, the 
better to launch into some sidestepping so rapid it was more an athletic
 feat than a dance. His tight black shirt was soaking wet as he called 
for "Midnight Hour," then stormed through "Ramrod" and "You Can Look 
(but You Better Not Touch)." "All those songs – with the exception of 
'Midnight Hour' – are new songs," he announced proudly. The lights 
lowered for a brooding version of "Stolen Car," Garry Tallent's bass 
rumbling like distant, ominous thunder, and then came the spate of crowd
 pleasers: "Backstreets," "Rosalita," "Born to Run" and the Mitch Ryder 
medley. The crowd, seated and attentive for much of the show, then 
pressed against the stage. "I knew you were out there," said Bruce. 
"You're great. Thanks a lot!"<br>
<br>
"It was a real warm crowd," Springsteen said backstage as the medicinal 
rub heated up under a thermal-underwear shirt. "A lot of them have seen 
us before. I don't think they come to the show at this point with an 
attitude of 'You have to win me over.' Course, a lot of people bring 
friends who have never seen us. They must, 'cause a lot of these places 
we didn't sell out before. So they must be bringing some body from some 
place."<br>
<br>
His album had been in the stores for only a day, but "Hungry Heart" had 
already declared itself a single because of radio airplay, and ticket 
sales were still going through the roof. Where were all those new faces 
coming from?<br>
<br>
"The last tour,"he explained, "we played 122 shows, and the band played 
real hard every single night, you know. Every single night in every 
town, the band played very hard. And people, I think they just 
remembered. They remembered, and this time everybody told their friends,
 'You just gotta come down to the show.'"<br>
<br>
"Where do you reach for the energy to do it?" I asked him. "You're 
playing nearly four hours, sometimes three nights in a row. 
Occasionally, you have to be tired."<br>
<br>
"The audience brings a lot, even when you think you have nothing left 
within you. You know, tonight is tonight, and what you do tonight, you 
don't make up for tomorrow, and you don't ride on what you did last 
night. I always keep in my mind that you only have one chance. Some guy 
bought his ticket, and there's a promise made between the musician and 
the audience. When they support each other, that's a special thing. It 
goes real deep, and most people take it too lightly. If you break the 
pact or take it too lightly, nothing else makes sense. It's at the heart
 of everything; I'm not sure how.<br>
<br>
"I've got a lot of energy just naturally. But when I get onstage and I'm
 running on empty. I just think of the promise to the guy or girl who's 
down there, a promise that's made from hundreds or thousands of miles 
away. It's no different than if you stood with this person and shook his
 hand."<br>

As he reissues his stark 1978 masterpiece, Bruce opens up on family, fame and the road not taken<br>
   <br>
By BRIAN HIATT<br>
November 25, 2010</strong><br>
<br>
The titles came to him first. They were evocative, bold, full of B-movie
 swagger: "Racing in the Street," "Badlands," "Streets of Fire." The 
hard part was writing songs that could live up to their promise – but 
Bruce Springsteen was 27 years old, and he had plenty of time. Even as a
 legal clash with his former manager barred him from the studio for 
months, Springsteen stayed up all night in his rented farmhouse just off
 a Jersey highway, writing song after song, draft after draft: Should 
the guy in "Racing in the Street" drive a '32 Ford or a '69 Chevy? 
Should the girl in "Candy's Room" have "pictures of her heroes" on her 
wall or "pictures of her saviors"? "I didn't have any problem spending 
hours and hours in pursuit of what I was after," he says now.<br>
<br>
The ultimate result, to be reissued this month in a lavish six-disc box 
set, was Darkness on the Edge of Town – a lean, stark album that 
produced some of his most enduring live tunes, and established the 
themes that would shape much of his subsequent work.<br>
<br>
Springsteen had just gone from cult hero to anointed rock savior with 
Born to Run's tales of romance, redemption and getting the hell out of 
New Jersey – but when he got off tour in 1976, he took the Garden State 
Parkway back to the only home he knew. Thirty-four years later, he's 
still there. "I was looking for a haven," Springsteen says, perched on a
 wooden stool by a crackling fireplace in a modest guesthouse on the 
edge of his vast, verdant property in Colts Neck – five miles south of 
his Darkness-era farmhouse in Holmdel. "It was something I knew – I was 
provincial by nature. When we came back, we sort of hunkered back down, 
which, in retrospect, was not such a bad thing."<br>
<br>
In Jersey, Springsteen couldn't get away from his past – a theme that 
spilled over to his lyrics: If Born to Run offered fantasies of escape, 
Springsteen's characters on Darkness sought the strength to stand their 
ground. "I was looking toward the connection with where I'd grown up and
 where I'd come from," he says. "I was frightened of losing that because
 of my circumstances." A lyric from "The Promise," one of the best songs
 Springsteen wrote for Darkness, hints at his thoughts: The narrator 
wins a big race, "but… inside I felt like I was carryin' the broken 
spirits/Of all the other ones who lost."<br>
<br>
He began to confront hard truths in his lyrics – from America's class 
system to the bitterness that can pass for love between fathers and 
sons. His relationship with his dad – a bus driver and factory worker 
who didn't support his son's early musical ambitions – had already 
fueled years of tragicomic stage raps ("There were two things that were 
unpopular in my house: one was me, and the other was my guitar"). It 
became the core of two of Darkness' most personal songs, "Factory" and 
"Adam Raised a Cain."<br>
<br>
Springsteen cut "The Promise" from the album – feeling it was too 
"self-referential" – but the studio version is finally coming out in the
 new box set, along with 20 other lost songs and alternate versions, 
from the hand-clapping frat rock of "Ain't Good Enough for You" to the 
sweeping Sixties pop of "Someday (We'll Be Together)." As detailed in 
the documentary The Promise: The Making of "Darkness on the Edge of 
Town," Springsteen wrote dozens of songs in an endless procession of 
styles before he found the core of the album. "I hadn't formulated the 
record conceptually," he says. "I found that out as I went along and 
began to choose and shape. To see what I didn't want to do, I had to do 
it. I had to make the albums I didn't want to put out."<br>
<br>
<br>
You say in the documentary that, more than rich, more than famous, more 
than happy, you wanted to be great. But were you anywhere near happy 
while you were working on Darkness?<br>
No [laughs]. So I didn't have to worry about that part.<br>
<br>
You were on a vampire schedule while you were writing the record, 
sleeping until 4 p.m. – that kind of isolated state doesn't sound 
healthy.<br>
I'm an alienated person by nature, always have been, still am to this 
day. It continues to be an issue in my life, in that I'm always coming 
from the outside, I'm always operating in distance, and I'm always 
trying to overcome my own internal reticence and alienation – which is 
funny, because I throw myself the opposite way onstage. But the reason I
 do that is because while the stage and all those people are out there, 
the abyss is under my heels, and I always feel it back there. I've 
accepted that as just my nature, and it's given me the ability to write a
 "Rosalita" or "The Rising" or "Waitin' on a Sunny Day" or "Nebraska" or
 "Straight Time" or "The Ghost of Tom Joad." You can't write those 
without having had at least a taste of the abyss. It's allowed me to 
have an emotional breadth and subject matter in my work that is very 
wide, but then you also have to live with it [laughs].<br>
<br>
Was it music 24/7 for you at that point in your life?<br>
I was extremely intellectually curious and constantly exposing myself to
 books and new things. I started to do a lot of reading. I did study a 
lot, just for pleasure. But at that age, my life was 100 percent music, 
and I had a very distorted relationship with it. It was my one shot at 
redemption – redemption from what? I couldn't tell you. A thousand 
things. But it was my life preserver. At the time, working and playing 
made me happy, but the thing that was the most difficult was that I was 
very drifty. I didn't have a place, I never felt at home, even when I 
was home. I had no inner sense of home. The closest I could get to it 
was the band and playing. Whenever I wasn't doing those things, I was 
spiritually and emotionally wandering, really adrift. I couldn't get my 
feet on anything solid.<br>
<br>
You were 26 years old – you'd escaped school, 9-to-5 jobs, all of that. 
And here you were facing guys in suits and ties, having to give 
depositions in a lawsuit against your manager. How did that affect you 
emotionally?<br>
It was so bad, emotionally. You were totally caught in the system of all
 those things, and as a musician, particularly when you're young, you're
 off the grid, you're out of sight, out of mind. I didn't pay a penny of
 income tax until I was on the cover of Time and Newsweek. Some guy must
 have seen me and said, "Who is that? Whoever that guy is, he hasn't 
paid any income tax," and neither had anybody else in the band, so we 
all got stuck. The collision of our world with "the real world," the 
business world, is a big, big, defining moment. You realize, "I'm going 
to have to negotiate these places, and all of my tools are useless. 
Everything I've learned, everything I know, everything I'm good at is 
useless in this world. And this world scares me a lot." I'm 22 when I'm 
signing all my agreements, and I'm 26 when I'm going through this thing,
 and I'm by myself. My parents had moved to California. They were 3,000 
miles away, and they're living their own life. I had friends, but it was
 very, very frustrating. It was quite frightening at the time.<br>
<br>
The outtakes from Darkness are soul- and Sixties-pop-influenced. How did
 you get from there all the way to the sound of Darkness?<br>
I didn't want to be pegged as a revivalist, so I was hesitant to wear my
 influences too clearly on my sleeve at the moment. If you listen to the
 two CDs we put out, the influences are all over, there's soul, there's 
Brill Building, there's all kinds of things, and it's extremely melodic,
 the arrangements are changing keys and moving. In that way, it really 
slid out of Born to Run. But on Born to Run, I had a theme that tied it 
together, and this material slips more into something like we did on The
 River. "OK, that would be a great song to play in a bar, this is a 
great neo-soul song." But I wasn't trying to be a neo-soul singer, or 
neo-anything. I said, "No, I'm trying to find a voice, a voice that's 
singular and feels of this moment," and when I began to move toward the 
Darkness material, which is not super-melodic, it really begins our 
folk-based rock, going back to blues and folk structures. I was not 
trying to be really melodic, because that immediately pulls you into the
 pop world. I was trying to create this mixture, this sort of rock-folk 
music that stretches back all the way to Woody Guthrie and country music
 and up through the Animals. It was thematically influenced by punk 
music and the times. It was 1977, so there were tough times. . . . <br>
<br>
Like now. It was another time that people felt their kids weren't going to have it as good as they did.<br>
Absolutely. The lights were going out on the Christmas tree at the White
 House [by '79], right? "No Christmas lights this year!" [Laughs] So you
 were living in a time where there was going to be no Christmas.<br>
<br>
"No Christmas" – that's the alternate title for the record.<br>
That should have been it [laughs].<br>
<br>
How did you start writing about your father on "Factory" and "Adam Raised a Cain"?<br>
I don't know if kids care as much about their parents as people as they 
should until they're in their late 20s, at best. They're furniture until
 then, and as a parent, you want to be a sturdy piece of furniture if 
you can. I was beginning to realize a part of me was going to keep a leg
 in my history, and that my history was tied to my parents' experience, 
and my experience growing up. That was a mystery to me, and I was very 
interested in beginning to investigate that mystery. Suddenly I 
recognized there was a life lived here when I was a child – there were 
several lives lived here. Those lives impacted my life tremendously, and
 yet I've also had the unusual experience of escaping the tethers of the
 hardest of their circumstances. That gave me a position to reflect and 
observe from. All artists are psychologically and emotionally driven to 
tell their stories. I'm not so sure we choose the stories – they choose 
you. We don't ever completely understand the things that drive us, but I
 do believe that a good deal of the thrust of the direction of the 
choices I made, when I had a choice about where my life was going to go,
 was back in deep pursuit of the mysteries of the past in order to find 
out "Who am I, who am I going to be, where's my future?"<br>
<br>
You were still very young – how much distance did you have from that adolescent conflict with your dad?<br>
I had a good distance from it at the time, but I'd also say I 
generalized that relationship. Our actual relationship was probably more
 complicated than how I presented it. Those songs were ways that I spoke
 to my father at the time, because he didn't speak and we didn't talk 
very much. I think if you weren't really close with someone, 
particularly children, the way they become close with that person is you
 take on their personality, you take on an imitation. The subjects I was
 drawn to, the issues I was moved to investigate, the clothes I wore, 
wear . . . when I went to work, I really went to work in my dad's 
clothes, and it became a way, I suppose, that I honored him and my 
parents' lives, and a part of my own young life. And then it just became
 who I was.<br>
<br>
As you moved into the Darkness material, your lead guitar stepped 
forward in a way that I'm not sure it has before or since. What was it 
about your second voice through that lead guitar that resonated for you 
at that point?<br>
I originally made my living as a guitarist for many, many years. I 
wasn't known as a singer, I wasn't known as a songwriter, I was 
basically known as a frontman, and primarily a guitar player, the first 
eight or nine years of my life here on the Jersey Shore. I was the Man 
[laughs]. I got very, very good at it, and it was where I thought that 
my fortunes would lie at one point. But then when I hit my early 20s, I 
started to say, "Really, I want to summon up a world," and songwriters 
do that. There was a select group of guitarists that do it, and those 
are the very, very, very, very rare exceptions – Hendrix or the Edge, 
you can pick them out – that manifest a world with their guitar.<br>
<br>
So I knew I was very good, but I didn't know if I was that good: "Do I 
have a vision with my guitar?" That's what I was interested in, and I 
said, in the end, "Well, I don't think so." I said, "Man, I can play the
 shit out of this thing, but I don't know if I have that." I got signed 
in the pack of new Dylans – Elliott Murphy, Loudon Wainwright, John 
Prine. Billy Joel a year later. But I could turn around, kick-start my 
Telecaster and burn the house down. It was my ace in the hole.<br>
<br>
But if I want to call up a world, that's songwriting, for me. If you're 
Frank Sinatra or Elvis, you can call it up with your voice. If you're 
not, you'd better think of something else. I felt I'd been gifted with a
 very, very high-octane journeyman's capabilities. I felt if I put those
 things together really thoughtfully and with enormous will and 
vitality, I can turn all of that into something that transcends what I 
felt were my modest abilities. The center of it was songwriting, so I 
delved into that with everything I had.<br>
<br>
The guitar on Darkness came around because the music had moved to a 
somewhat less urban area, and I said, "There will probably be less 
saxophone, that makes room for a little more guitar-playing." The sax is
 warm and melodic, the way we've used it, and we use it very 
orchestrally. If I wanted something that was just going to be nasty and 
burn, that's the guitar. For that group of material, I wanted the 
aggression, I wanted the harshness of the guitar, and I got a chance to 
play.<br>

Until Brendan O'Brien came along on "The Rising," the rhythm guitars never got that loud on your records.<br>
This would be Steve's [Van Zandt] ax to grind if he was here. It was 
just a choice. We had a huge keyboard presence. When Roy [Bittan] 
entered on Born to Run, I wrote all those Born to Run songs on the 
piano, but Roy, in the end, his attack and formulations of what I showed
 him really created a very, very unique sound, and if people hear that 
today, they go, "That sounds like the E Street Band." So that became 
very, very powerful. Usually, when something like that happens, the 
first thing I do is I move away from it, because then you're just 
sounding like yourself [laughs].<br>
<br>
But in the film in the box set of you guys playing Darkness at the 
Paramount Theater in Asbury Park last year, the guitars are louder than 
ever.<br>
The band is a more aggressive band today than it was when we were in our
 20s. We were still little boys, you know, in truth. If you go back and 
you watch old footage of us – and we're playing the stuff great on the 
DVD, stuff from Phoenix – then you move up to the performance from last 
year, it's better, it's just better. We're a band that has never lost 
their focus from when we hit the stage, so now you have this collection 
of years, which we gather instead of try to deny, you have the power of 
the oncoming train that's chasing you now, right at your back, you can 
hear that whistle blowing, my friend [laughs], so it's now or never. 
We've doubled down on now or never, which we did in the beginning 
anyway. Bob Clearmountain mixed the new performance and did a great job.
 I said, "You've got to turn the guitars up," and he mixed it once. I 
went back and said, "Mix it again and turn all the guitars up," and 
that's what he did.<br>
<br>
You get a great sense of your friendship with Steve Van Zandt in that 
documentary. We've heard you sing about it on "Bobby Jean" – "We liked 
the same music, we liked the same bands, we liked the same clothes" – 
but what was the nature of your bond?<br>
Just music, it was just about music. We're each other's best audience – 
everything he did I thought was funny. Steve';s incredibly smart. He was
 the other guy who came out of this area, as far as I know – with very 
little education – who's simply very, very smart in many ways. Your 
friendships, often, you're driven toward that intelligence, and your 
minds are going [buzzing noise] together. He felt about music the way I 
felt about it: "This is actually the only shit that matters, and don't 
let anybody tell you different." There's a moment in your life when you 
say, "There's this, or we die, my friend." And so there was another guy 
in the area who understood that, it's not this, or seeing my girlfriend 
on Friday night – no, it's this or nothing. That extremism was very 
valuable at its time, and continues to be invaluable today, as long as 
it's tempered so you can have a life. But we've corralled that energy in
 a way, and we used it well, and we still use it well. We do no half 
measures. When it's on, it's all on. That hasn't changed – these guys 
are hitting 60, and that hasn't changed. Steve and I, I walked in and 
looked at him for the first time and he looked at me, and it was one of 
those moments of "I know you."<br>
<br>
There's a lot of romantic calamity going on in the unreleased songs. Was it a genre exercise or autobiographical?<br>
It was a genre exercise. A lot of it was just trying to write a clever 
lyric, because I liked how the idea of the Brill Building was "OK, we're
 going to write a breakup song, or the girl, she won't talk to the guy. 
You can't satisfy her. Go!" I was having an enormous amount of fun with 
the toolbox of rock &amp; roll, all the things that were already sort of
 in there. I'd write something to hear Clarence [Clemons] play the sax, 
and if you write well enough, what you end up with has nothing to do 
with whatever its initial spark was.<br>
<br>
There's a reproduction of your song notebooks included in the box. When 
you look in the notebooks and you see the title "Badlands" and a bunch 
of not-so-great lyrics that don't end up in the final song – did you 
know that all these lousy drafts would eventually lead to a classic 
song?<br>
I never said, "Maybe I'm going to write a classic." I said, "Maybe I'm 
going to write something I can stand to sing and have other human beings
 hear." I wanted to write something that just doesn't embarrass me. I 
was sort of praying for that. Of course, at the same time, there's some 
part of you where you want to be great and you want to make records that
 have the same impact as the records that enriched your life so deeply: 
"Oh, man, if I could only deliver that, I could live with myself for 
another day or two." They sort of went ahead and put a semblance of the 
notebook out with this package. I didn't realize that's what they were 
doing, and in the past, I would never have allowed it, because I would 
have been too embarrassed, because there's a lot of bad writing and bad 
verses of purple prose. But it was what I was drawing from … B movies … 
there was a certain kind of teenage poetry, I guess.<br>
<br>
Brian Wilson.<br>
Yeah, and films, those were my influences, and I would just write down 
anything, and then I would come back later and I would edit. "OK, I 
can't sing that, but maybe I could sing a version of that here, I could 
sing the first half of that.'' When you pick a song title like "Racing 
in the Street," that's a hard song to write. But that was sort of the 
local culture of Asbury in the Seventies, which was still deeply 
enmeshed in car culture. If you went to the Stone Pony, it was a 
constant circle of souped-up muscle cars on Saturday and Sunday. Once 
again, I sort of stood outside of it, I was hitchhiking, I didn't have a
 car! But I wanted one real bad.<br>
<br>
So I came up with titles, and I went in search of songs that would 
deserve the title. "Badlands," that's a great title, but it would be 
easy to blow it. But I kept writing and I kept writing and I kept 
writing and writing until I had a song that I felt deserved that title. 
Same with "Darkness on the Edge of Town," I had that title and said, 
"Well, I'd better come up with something that deserves that title." 
That's what I was always very, very good at – I didn't have any problem 
thinking really hard about what I was doing. Any other pressing 
questions?<br>
<br>
Was Candy a hooker, or what?<br>
Does it matter, does it really matter? [Laughs] I'll never tell.<br>
