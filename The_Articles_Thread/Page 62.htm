Born to Run<br>
By Josh Tyrangiel <br>
Jan. 25, 20100<br>
<br>
Artist: Bruce Springsteen</strong><br>
Year Released: 1975<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s first two albums were commercial duds. He had no money, 
and the sound he wanted for his third record—The Boss later described it
 as ‘Roy Orbison singing Bob Dylan produced by Phil Spector’—required 
months of studio tinkering to perfect. So Jimmy Iovine (then a recording
 engineer, now the head of Interscope Records) took care of hiding 
stacks of overdue bills from the record label while Springsteen obsessed
 over things like just how many guitar overdubs the title track needed. 
If it seems trivial to note that the final tally was 12, listen again, 
because, it’s the accumulation of details, both musical (the warm wind 
of the saxophone on “Tenth Avenue Freeze Out,” the violin that comes out
 of nowhere on “Jungleland”) and lyrical (‘The screen door slams/ Mary’s
 dress waves…’) that makes Springsteen’s grandiosity both operatic and 
personal. No one before or since has tried to pack as much of the 
American experience into 39 minutes, and no one has come as close to 
succeeding.<br>

BORN TO RUN<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN (1975)</strong><br>
<br>
Review by William Ruhlmann  <br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen's make-or-break third album represented a sonic leap 
from his first two, which had been made for modest sums at a suburban 
studio; Born to Run was cut on a superstar budget, mostly at the Record 
Plant in New York. Springsteen's backup band had changed, with his two 
virtuoso players, keyboardist David Sancious and drummer Vini Lopez, 
replaced by the professional but less flashy Roy Bittan and Max 
Weinberg. The result was a full, highly produced sound that contained 
elements of Phil Spector's melodramatic work of the 1960s. Layers of 
guitar, layers of echo on the vocals, lots of keyboards, thunderous 
drums -- Born to Run had a big sound, and Springsteen wrote big songs to
 match it. The overall theme of the album was similar to that of The E 
Street Shuffle; Springsteen was describing, and saying farewell to, a 
romanticized teenage street life. But where he had been affectionate, 
even humorous before, he was becoming increasingly bitter. If 
Springsteen had celebrated his dead-end kids on his first album and 
viewed them nostalgically on his second, on his third he seemed to 
despise their failure, perhaps because he was beginning to fear he was 
trapped himself. Nevertheless, he now felt removed, composing an updated
 West Side Story with spectacular music that owed more to Bernstein than
 to Berry. To call Born to Run overblown is to miss the point; 
Springsteen's precise intention is to blow things up, both in the sense 
of expanding them to gargantuan size and of exploding them. If The Wild,
 the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle was an accidental miracle, Born
 to Run was an intentional masterpiece. It declared its own greatness 
with songs and a sound that lived up to Springsteen's promise, and 
though some thought it took itself too seriously, many found that 
exalting.<br>

Bruce Springsteen<br>
<br>
By GREIL MARCUS<br>
October 9, 1975</strong><br>
<br>
As a determinedly permanent resident of the West Coast, the furor Bruce 
Springsteen's live performances have kicked up in the East over the last
 couple of years left me feeling somewhat culturally deprived, not to 
mention a little suspicious. The legendary three-hour sets Springsteen 
and his E Street Band apparently rip out night after night in New York, 
Province-town, Boston and even Austin have generated a great tumult and 
shouting; but, short of flying 3000 miles to catch a show, there was no 
way for an outlander to discover what the fuss was all about.<br>
<br>
Certainly, I couldn't find the reasons on Springsteen's first two 
albums, despite Columbia's "New Dylan" promotional campaign for the 
debut disc and the equally thoughtful "Street Poet" cover of the second.
 Both radiated self-consciousness, whereas the ballyhoo led one to hope 
for the grand egotism of historic rock &amp; roll stars; both seemed at 
once flat and more than a little hysterical, full of sound and fury, and
 signifying, if not nothing, not much.<br>
<br>
A bit guiltily, I found anything by Roxy Music far more satisfying. They
 could at least hit what they aimed for; while it was clear Springsteen 
was after bigger game, the records made me wonder if he knew what it 
was. Whether he did or not, with two "you gotta see him live" albums 
behind him, the question of whether Springsteen would ever make his mark
 on rock &amp; roll — or hang onto the chance to do so — rested on that 
third LP, which was somehow "long awaited" before the ink was dry on the
 second. Very soon, he would have to come across, put up or shut up. It 
is the rock &amp; roller's great shoot-out with himself: The kid with 
promise hits the dirt and the hero turns slowly, blows the smoke from 
his pistol, and goes on his way.<br>
<br>
Or else, the kid and the hero go down together, twitching in the dust 
while the onlookers turn their heads and talk safely of what might have 
been. The end. Fade-out.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's answer is Born to Run. It is a magnificent album that pays
 off on every bet ever placed on him — a '57 Chevy running on melted 
down Crystals records that shuts down every claim that has been made. 
And it should crack his future wide open.<br>
<br>
The song titles by themselves — "Thunder Road," "Night," "Backstreets," 
"Born to Run," "Jungleland" — suggest the extraordinary dramatic 
authority that is at the heart of Springsteen's new music. It is the 
drama that counts; the stories Springsteen is telling are nothing new, 
though no one has ever told them better or made them matter more. Their 
familiar romance is half their power: The promise and the threat of the 
night; the lure of the road; the quest for a chance worth taking and the
 lust to pay its price; girls glimpsed once at 80 miles an hour and 
never forgotten; the city streets as the last, permanent American 
frontier. We know the story: one thousand and one American nights, one 
long night of fear and love.<br>
<br>
What is new is the majesty Springsteen and his band have brought to this
 story. Springsteen's singing, his words and the band's music have 
turned the dreams and failures two generations have dropped along the 
road into an epic — an epic that began when that car went over the cliff
 in Rebel Without a Cause. One feels that all it ever meant, all it ever
 had to say, is on this album, brought forth with a determination one 
would have thought was burnt out years ago. One feels that the music 
Springsteen has made from this long story has outstripped the story; 
that it is, in all its fire, a demand for something new.<br>
<br>
In one sense, all this talk of epic comes down to sound. Rolling Stone 
contributing editor Jon Landau, Mike Appel and Springsteen produced Born
 to Run in a style as close to mono as anyone can get these days; the 
result is a sound full of grandeur. For all it owes to Phil Spector, it 
can be compared only to the music of Bob Dylan &amp; the Hawks made 
onstage in 1965 and '66. With that sound, Springsteen has achieved 
something very special. He has touched his world with glory, without 
glorifying anything: not the romance of escape, not the unbearable 
pathos of the street fight in "Jungleland," not the scared young lovers 
of "Backstreets" and not himself.<br>
<br>
"Born to Run" is the motto that speaks for the album's tales, just as 
the guitar figure that runs through the title song — the finest 
compression of the rock &amp; roll thrill since the opening riffs of 
"Layla" — speaks for its music. But "Born to Run" is uncomfortably close
 to another talisman of the lost kids that careen across this record, a 
slogan Springsteen's motto inevitably suggests. It is an old tattoo: 
"Born to Lose." Springsteen's songs — filled with recurring images of 
people stranded, huddled, scared, crying, dying — take place in the 
space between "Born to Run" and "Born to Lose," as if to say, the only 
run worth making is the one that forces you to risk losing everything 
you have. Only by taking that risk can you hold on to the faith that you
 have something left to lose. Springsteen's heroes and heroines face 
terror and survive it, face delight and die by its hand, and then watch 
as the process is reversed, understanding finally that they are paying 
the price of romanticizing their own fear.<br>
<br>
One soft infested summer/Me and Terry became friends/Trying in vain to 
breathe/The fire we was born in.../Remember all the movies, Terry/We'd 
go see/Trying to learn to walk like the heroes/We thought we had to 
be/Well after all this time/To find we're just like all the 
rest/Stranded in the park/And forced to confess/To/Hiding on the 
backstreets/Hiding on the backstreets/Where we swore forever friends....<br>
<br>
Those are a few lines from "Backstreets," a song that begins with music 
so stately, so heartbreaking, that it might be the prelude to a rock 
&amp; roll version of The Iliad. Once the piano and organ have 
established the theme the entire band comes and plays the theme again. 
There is an overwhelming sense of recognition: No, you've never heard 
anything like this before, but you understand it instantly, because this
 music — or Springsteen crying, singing wordlessly, moaning over the 
last guitar lines of "Born to Run," or the astonishing chords that 
follow each verse of "Jungleland," or the opening of "Thunder Road" — is
 what rock &amp; roll is supposed to sound like.<br>
<br>
The songs, the best of them, are adventures in the dark, incidents of 
wasted fury. Tales of kids born to run who lose anyway, the songs can, 
as with "Backstreets," hit so hard and fast that it is almost impossible
 to sit through them without weeping. And yet the music is exhilarating.
 You may find yourself shaking your head in wonder, smiling through 
tears at the beauty of it all. I'm not talking about lyrics; they're 
buried, as they should be, hard to hear for the first dozen playings or 
so, coming out in bits and pieces. To hear Springsteen sing the line 
"Hiding on the backstreets" is to be captured by an image; the details 
can come later. Who needed to figure out all the words to "Like a 
Rolling Stone" to understand it?<br>
<br>
It is a measure of Springsteen's ability to make his music bleed that 
"Backstreets," which is about friendship and betrayal between a boy and a
 girl, is far more deathly than "Jungleland," which is about a gang war.
 The music isn't "better," nor is the singing — but it is more 
passionate, more deathly and, necessarily, more alive. That, if 
anything, might be the key to this music: As a ride through terror, it 
resolves itself finally as a ride into delight.<br>
<br>
"Oh-o, come on, take my hand," Springsteen sings, "Riding out to case 
the promised land." And there, in a line, is Born to Run. You take what 
you find, but you never give up your demand for something better because
 you know, in your heart, that you deserve it. That contradiction is 
what keeps Springsteen's story, and the promised land's, alive. 
Springsteen took what he found and made something better himself. This 
album is it.<br>

<br>
Bruce Springsteen: Born to Run [Columbia, 1975</strong><br>
]<br>
Just how much American myth can be crammed into one song, or a dozen, 
about asking your girl to come take a ride? A lot, but not as much as 
romanticists of the doomed outsider believe. Springsteen needs to learn 
that operettic pomposity insults the Ronettes and that pseudotragic 
beautiful-loser fatalism insults us all. And around now I'd better add 
that the man avoids these quibbles at his best and simply runs them over
 the rest of the time. If "She's the One" fails the memory of Phil 
Spector's innocent grandeur, well, the title cut is the fulfillment of 
everything "Be My Baby" was about and lots more. Springsteen may well 
turn out to be one of those rare self-conscious primitives who gets away
 with it. In closing, two comments from my friends the Marcuses. Jenny: 
"Who does he think he is, Howard Keel?" (That's a put-down.) Greil: 
"That is as good as `I Think We're Alone Now.'" (That's not.) <strong class="text-strong">RATED  A</strong><br>

Review by Channing Freeman <br>
June 22nd, 2011 <br>
<br>
Release Date: 1975<br>
<br>
<br>
We can compare modern “working-class” bands with Bruce Springsteen all 
we want, but the simple fact is that no one has ever done it better. 
Maybe no one besides him has ever done it, period. Today's bands of that
 ilk are really just the heartbroken songwriters of indie's milieu 
dressed in blue collars. They give the impression that somehow they are 
easier to relate to because their lyrical wheelhouse consists of small 
towns, of nondescript cars, and of bills to be paid. They take wrong 
turns when they presumptuously attempt to be the right band for a 
certain age. What they don't understand is that the age from which 
Springsteen sprung was the right age for him. It is not less noble for a
 band to take a look around them and hope to comment on or even combat 
events with their music. But it is better when music is written as a 
product of a microcosm (say, growing up in Asbury Park) and then 
naturally comes to embody a macrocosm (America in general). The idea is 
that listeners will see their own story in the songs instead of just 
hearing something with clever lyrics that they'd like to sing along to 
or remember to quote later on in conversation, which can create an 
illusion of familiarity.<br>
<br>
It is this essential quality that sets him apart from everyone else even
 after all these years. His fictional characters are easier to relate to
 than any modern indie song sung in the first person. It has been 
interesting to watch this particular musical shift. How is it that a 
song rife with such nameless characters as the Magic Rat and the 
Barefoot Girl, with imagery of Exxon signs and ambulance lights and 
death in those lonely corridors of the city seems more homely than any 
song about the end of a relationship which, presumably, any listener 
would be able to relate to much more? It is as if the old rules have 
been transferred from stone tablets to pieces of notebook paper, 
frequently scratched out and rewritten to fit the latest trends. That 
storytelling trait has, with a few exceptions, long been absent from 
music and perhaps that is telling. What makes Springsteen's music so 
great is that his stories and characters made it all the more affecting 
when he did write something personal. When he personally wondered if 
love was real it sounded more genuine because of similar, prior 
sentiments from the lonesome, wandering denizens of Asbury Park. Story 
echoed real-life and vice versa, each lending weight to one another.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's America seen through today's lens seems more modern than 
the vision being presented currently. It is a marvelous thing that none 
of Springsteen's songs seem quaint or outdated but it is not surprising 
in the least. He was able to both hearken to an earlier time by 
harnessing the power of music's golden age and to make an audience look 
to the future, to attempt to keep alive a sense of America's commoner 
nobility – the notion that there is nothing purer than trying to survive
 through means universal and familiar, through foot before foot and hand
 over hand. The notion that we could succeed or fail to walk like heroes
 but either way America, although perhaps dull-eyed and empty-faced, was
 nevertheless bound for a greater glory somewhere down the road.<br>

Bruce Springsteen, Born to Run - 30th Anniversary Edition</strong><br>
(Columbia Records)<br>
 Friday 18 November 2005<br>
RATING *****<br>
<br>
In 1974, Bruce Springsteen hoped Born to Run would make him a star. 
Instead, he became a legend. Now celebrating its 30th anniversary with 
this deluxe boxset, which includes not just the remastered album but a 
DVD of the documentary Wings for Steel: The Making of Born to Run and a 
second dvd of a gig at Hammersmith Odeon in 1975, the escapism and 
mythology that fuelled Springsteen's vision remains startling.<br>
<br>
His mean streets of New Jersey teem with characters that he was to 
re-imagine for the rest of his career; the desperate would-be gangster 
of Meeting Across the River, the blue-collar worker living for the end 
of the day in Night. Wrapped in Spector-esque waves of sound that build 
from poignant piano intros and Springsteen's raw, itchy passion into 
thunderous, theatrical rock'n'roll, this is a love letter to freedom.</div>

NEIL McCORMICK<br>
DAILY TELEGRAPH (LONDON)<br>
JUNE 4, 2014</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Thirty years after Born In The USA was first released, Neil McCormick counts down The Boss's albums<br>
Bruce Springsteen photographed in the mid-Seventies<br>
<br>
<br>
The cover may be the most famous posterior shot in the history of pop, 
defining Bruce Springsteen’s image as a red, white and blue American 
icon, a buff working-class hero. Released on June 4 1984, Born In The 
USA confirmed Springsteen’s status as a stadium rock superstar. His 
seventh album, its mix of anthemic socio-political rock and songs of 
personal struggle, bolstered with snappy pop melodies and dynamic 
production, helped to make it the biggest selling album in the world in 
the year of its release. With more than 30 million satisfied customers 
to date, it remains the biggest selling of his long career. But is it 
really his best ever? Springsteen has made 18 studio albums over a 
41-year recording career. Here, Neil McCormick rates them all.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">18. Human Touch (1992)</strong><br>
<br>
Springsteen is the rarest of popular music artists, always committed to 
searching for something magical. But all things are relative and Human 
Touch is relatively weak, almost like someone impersonating Springsteen,
 with all the right moves but no shadows, little substance and no 
surprises. Following two decades of incredible success, Springsteen 
broke up the long-serving E Street Band and produced this slick, plastic
 album investigating straightforward ideas of love and commitment. But 
the title track is a belter and there are lost gems in 57 Channels, With
 Every Wish and Pony Boy.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">17. High Hopes (2014)</strong><br>
<br>
Springsteen’s latest album sounds fantastic with Rage Against the 
Machine’s Tom Morello bringing a contemporary art-rock edge to the E 
Street roots. A collection of re-recorded odds and ends, it doesn’t 
really have a central narrative thrust and is only ever as good as 
individual songs like American Skin, Down In The Hole and Hunter of 
Invisible Game (all rejected from earlier albums). It's no classic but 
I’ve never heard a Springsteen album I didn’t like and, despite its lack
 of focus, High Hopes is no exception.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">16. Lucky Town (1992)</strong><br>
<br>
Springsteen seemed uncharacteristically uncertain of his direction in 
the Nineties. After spending a long time in the studio crafting the 
below-par Human Touch, he dashed off this raw companion piece in just 
two weeks, then released them both together. Lucky Town is the more 
ragged and lively of the two, with some great songs including the 
inspirational If I Should Fall Behind and the rocking title track. 
Perhaps if Springsteen hadn't been distracted by divorce, remarriage and
 children, he might have taken the best of the two albums, recorded it 
all properly with his band, and created another classic.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">15. Working On A Dream (2009)</strong><br>
<br>
This is Springsteen’s most romantic and least political album, where he 
whoops it up with the E Street Band to a degree that verges on parody, 
especially on biker anthem Outlaw Pete. I suspect this is what people 
who don’t listen to Springsteen think he sounds like all the time, a 
gruff Roy Orbison delivering operatic rock 'n' roll about the glory of 
the American dream. All that said, what’s wrong with celebrating the 
good things in life? The band are in fine fettle and the dark shadows of
 underlying desperation that occasionally loom on a track like Life 
Itself add weight to the uplifting pleasures of giddier songs like Queen
 Of The Supermarket, where The Boss drives a shopping cart rather than a
 Cadillac.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">14. Greetings From Asbury Park NJ (1973)</strong><br>
<br>
I suppose there are those who would consider it sacrilege to suggest 
Springsteen’s charming but wayward debut is not a classic but, compared 
to later offerings, it’s an enthusiastic, wordy, over-written mess from 
an artist still looking for an identity somewhere between Van Morrison 
and Bob Dylan. The prescient producer and critic Jon Landau saw enough 
to declare him rock 'n' roll’s future and it remains a colourful, poetic
 calling card.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">13. Devils &amp; Dust (2005)</strong><br>
<br>
Even this comparatively minor semi-acoustic album of character vignettes
 has a seriousness and focus that Springsteen’s ebullient debut lacks. 
Most of these songs are leftovers from his unproductive Nineties, so it 
represents where his muse was taking him before 9/11 changed his course.
 There is a dour, melancholic quality to his tales from a lost America, 
evoking a hard nostalgia for less complicated yet apparently no happier 
times. Far from the urban automotive heartland of his early work, 
Springsteen sings of horses and old cowboys, workers and drifters, men 
who can’t escape the tough choices of their pasts. The songs are 
structurally simple, lyrically and melodically direct, yet every now and
 then he still pulls out something like Reno, the forensic tale of a 
lonely man’s encounter with a prostitute, to remind you that he is 
working at a level way beyond most of his contemporaries.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">12. Magic (2007)</strong><br>
<br>
Recorded with the E Street Band, Magic is a record grappling with a 
nation at war on two fronts – Afghanistan and Iraq – and beset by 
self-doubt on the home front. The sombre title track, depicting a 
devilish magician pulling the wool over his audience’s eyes, remains one
 of the sharpest commentaries on the George W Bush presidency (“Trust 
none of what you hear / Less of what you see”). It’s a punchy, dramatic 
collection, with aggressive rock like Radio Nowhere and Last To Die 
leavened by the shimmery pop of Girls In Their Summer Clothes and Livin’
 In The Future. It falls some way short of classic Bruce status, 
however. A few too many songs are content to state the obvious, and the 
digital 21st-century production robs the E Street Band of its character,
 making the players sound like generic rockers.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">11. We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions (2006)</strong><br>
<br>
It starts with laughter, and this may the most purely joyous album 
Springsteen has ever made. Recorded in a barn on his New Jersey farm 
with a huge ensemble of traditional musicians, mainly uncelebrated 
locals and friends of friends, it’s a journey of musical exploration for
 Springsteen himself, the rock 'n' roll hero diving deep into American 
roots (and its Irish and English folk antecedents) by investigating the 
catalogue of the great folk activist and archivist Pete Seeger. With 
fiddles, horns, gospelly chorus vocals and jazzy New Orleans-style 
drumming, it is loose and rousing stuff, a freewheeling celebration of 
great music with a fantastically unhinged spirit. Springsteen’s only 
album of covers, the connection to his own oeuvre is evident, and it 
hints at the overtly political and religious spirit of his greatest late
 works.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">10. The Ghost Of Tom Joad (1995)</strong><br>
<br>
In an unproductive recording decade, during which Springsteen focused on
 family matters, this remains a quiet and minimalistic classic, 
featuring subdued, semi-acoustic deliveries of resonant songs about 
harsh lives in a version of America that has no time for dreams. 
Springsteen's lifelong interest in John Steinbeck was triggered by his 
childhood viewing of John Ford’s Grapes Of Wrath, and Springsteen uses 
the novel's central character, Tom Joad, as a symbol of social justice 
in difficult times. The whole album has an underlying strength and deep 
humanist vision. It is a pivotal work in the second half of his stellar 
career.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
9. The Wild, The Innocent &amp; The E Street Shuffle (1973)</strong><br>
<br>
Just a few months had passed since his flamboyant debut, but on his next
 album Springsteen’s vision is coming into focus and the E Street Band 
is taking shape. Jazzier, funkier and wilder than anything that was to 
follow – although still overly indebted to Van Morrison and Bob Dylan – 
this is Springsteen’s freshest, freest album, ebulliently mythologising 
the cultural and musical landscape of his youth. It may lack the 
authority and gravitas of the man they came to call The Boss, but it’s a
 delightful introduction to one of the most charismatic characters in 
rock.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">8. Tunnel Of Love (1987)</strong><br>
<br>
The comedown after the stadium excesses of the first phase of 
Springsteen’s superstardom, Tunnel Of Love is the introverted, 
self-doubting mirror image of the fist-waving Born In The USA. Beginning
 the process of breaking up the E Street Band, Springsteen plays most of
 the instruments himself, utilising drum machines and synths, which 
perhaps adds to the sense of psychological claustrophobia. Springsteen’s
 divorce album, written as his marriage to actress Julianne Phillips 
fell apart, every song is a carefully turned gem, taking us on a journey
 from giddy romantic dreams to careworn domestic disarray, adding up to a
 brooding contemplation of the essential unknowability of others. Songs 
like the title track and the devastating Brilliant Disguise offer a 
compelling depiction of vulnerability from a man often considered a 
tower of strength.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">7. The River (1980)</strong><br>
<br>
The title track is my personal favourite Springsteen ballad, a deep, 
bruised, epic depiction of how life kills romance that makes me gasp and
 swoon every time I hear it. This double album was an ambitious attempt 
to mix the sweet and sour, to set the jubilant pop music Springsteen had
 grown up with against the economic harshness of working-class life, a 
kind of musical answer to the paradox of the American dream. The results
 (like most double albums) are a bit baggy and for every moment of pure 
pop joy (Hungry Heart), hypnotic drama (Point Blank) and brooding 
contemplation (Wreck On The Highway) there’s a neat throwaway rocker 
like Sherry Darling or Crush On You.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">6. Nebraska (1982)<br>
</strong><br>
A sparse, unforgiving masterpiece recorded solo on a fuzzy four-track 
cassette machine, this may be the greatest and is almost certainly the 
most celebrated low fidelity album ever made. Working on a follow-up to 
epic double set The River, Springsteen was unsatisfied with the 
full-blooded band arrangements of his songs of loss and desolation, and 
boldly decided to release the minimalist demos instead. His 
socio-political vision growing darker with each release, here he gives 
us Reagan’s America in road songs that are running out of road. There is
 a haunting quality to Springsteen's vocals and the echoing guitar on 
these uncluttered songs. They burn with the deep truth of folk music. In
 1982, it sounded shocking in its simplicity. Three decades later, it 
sounds eternal.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">5. The Rising (2002)</strong><br>
<br>
Springsteen’s astonishing, emotive response to 9/11 ushered in the most 
productive era of his career. Before The Rising, he hadn’t released an 
album in seven years, or made one with the E Street Band in 18. He wrote
 and recorded this incredibly moving song cycle of loss, hope and 
redemption in just six months in the immediate aftermath of the greatest
 tragedy of modern America. He has told a story of how, a few days after
 the attack, a stranger in a car stopped next to him, rolled down his 
window and said, “We need you now.” It is hard to imagine any other 
musician being called on in this way and Springsteen responded with a 
compassionate epic to match his greatest works, spanning intimacy and 
exultation, from the quiet heroism of Nothing Man to the gospel charge 
of My City Of Ruins.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">4. Born In The USA (1984)</strong><br>
<br>
Thirty years on, it still rocks. Born In The USA remains the most 
tightly honed of Springsteen’s albums, the songs taut and economical, 
glistening with pop hooks and burnished with a dynamic Eighties sound. 
It successfully synthesises the two disparate strands of The River and 
comes up with something that manages to be both angry and celebratory, 
often in the same song. It is an album of glittering paradoxes, not 
least in the rage underpinning a sing-along title anthem that was 
wilfully misinterpreted by many on the American Right. Romance (Cover 
Me), defeat (Downbound Train), stoicism (Working On The Highway), lust 
(I’m On Fire), bittersweet nostalgia (Bobby Jean), frustration and 
longing (Dancing in The Dark) and a heart-swelling acceptance of 
personal identity (My Hometown), all wrapped up with slick pop 
production.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">3. Wrecking Ball (2012)</strong><br>
<br>
Springsteen’s most overtly political album, a rousing protest against 
bankers, unemployment, economic blight, the global financial crisis and 
the failure of the political classes to protect the working class. On 
the title track, Springsteen twice exhorts listeners to “hold tight to 
your anger”, replacing some of the poetic ambiguity of earlier accounts 
of harsh times with a direct, plain-speaking approach. Some may argue 
that this is a retrograde step but it adds up to a collection of real 
power. Taking on board the musical influences of the Seeger sessions, 
the E Street Band has swelled to effortlessly encompass shades of 
Latino, Tex-Mex, Country &amp; Western, Celtic folk and gospel. It may 
well be the defining album of an ageing American icon who simultaneously
 embodies stirring frontier patriotism and brooding liberal doubt.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">2. Born To Run (1975)</strong><br>
<br>
For Springsteen’s early fans, this will always be the one, the album 
where he became The Boss. The sound of the E Street Band really takes 
flight with long, flowing piano passages and that rasping, heroic 
saxophone, while Springsteen finally finds his own original voice, a 
gruff street poet who can find a melody in a growl and a howl, facing 
down a wall of sound. Perhaps his most uplifting and idealistic set of 
songs, this is where Springsteen hones in on the romance of escape from 
grim fate, a young man who still wants to believe in American dreams and
 all the possibilities of another life somewhere down the Thunder road, 
because “tramps like us, baby we were born to run.” And run.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">1. Darkness On The Edge Of Town (1978)</strong><br>
<br>
This is the one for me. As a young 17-year-old punk, it hit me at the 
right moment with the right hard edge, opening up streams of American 
music that have enriched my life ever since. It is grittier than his 
more aspirational early recordings, connecting to the harder economic 
mood of the times, reflecting his growing politicisation, and 
compressing the sound of the E Street Band into something richer, 
sleeker and tougher. Candy’s Room demonstrates what a dazzling outfit 
they have become: a dark tale of a young man’s love for a prostitute, 
driven by a racing hi-hat that contrasts with a low, almost spoken, 
half-speed vocal, until it explodes into full band roar as Springsteen 
declares “what she wants is me.” It’s a kind of concept album of 
American failure, life in the Badlands, where Adam Raised A Cain, where 
wasted youth are Racing In The Streets, staging failed escapes in search
 of Something In The Night, crashing and burning on those spooky Streets
 Of Fire, all fodder for the Factory, still desperate to believe in The 
Promised Land. “Mister, I ain’t a boy, no, I’m a man,” declares 
Springsteen. It is his first great work of maturity. Everything that 
Springsteen has achieved since is signposted on this masterful 
collection.</div>

Rolling Stone<br>
Oct 1, 1981<br>
Steve Pond</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
'Bruce has taken us out of the shadows' says Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic. <br>
Big bussinessmen and political leaders failed to rally behind us," said 
Vietnam veteran Bobby Muller, speaking to about 15,000 remarkably 
attentive rock fans on August 20th at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. "And
 now it ultimately turns out to be the symbol of our generation – rock 
&amp; roll – that brings us together. . . . This is the first step in 
ending the silence that has surrounded Vietnam."<br>
<br>
To deafening applause, Muller, sitting center stage in a wheelchair, 
turned over the spotlight to Bruce Springsteen, the first of several 
rockers to play benefits for the veterans. Minutes earlier, Springsteen 
had introduced Muller with his own, terse, eloquent speech; now, he led 
the E Street Band into a dark, swelling melody and stepped to the mike 
to sing, "Long as I remember, the rain's been falling down. . . ." 
Creedence Clearwater Revival's eleven-year-old "Who'll Stop the Rain" 
was transformed into a majestic call to arms, and the next two songs 
deepended the mood: "Prove It All Night" was stripped of its usual joy, 
and Springsteen came down hard on the lines "If dreams came true, oh 
wouldn't it be nice/But this ain't no dream we're living through 
tonight." Then, without pause, he turned toward the two stage-side 
platforms full of veterans in wheelchairs and no crutches and ripped 
into "The Ties That Bind": "You been hurt and you're all cried out you 
say/You walk down the street pushing people out of your way."<br>
<br>
All proceeds from the show – the first in a six-night stand for 
Springsteen at the Sports Arena – will be split between the Vietnam 
Veterans of America (VVA) – the organization Muller heads – and the Los 
Angeles Mental Health Clinic (the VVA will receive seventy-five percent 
of the estimated $100,000 take). Shortly after Springsteen announced his
 benefit, other musicians came to the aid of the veterans: Pat Benatar's
 September 20th Detroit performance will benefit the VVA, and Charlie 
Daniels will give the organization proceeds from a Warner Amex cable TV 
concert filmed in Saratoga Springs, New York, on September 4th. "I feel 
that the Vietnam veterans have been the most mistreated and most ignored
 people I can remember in my lifetime," said Daniels, "and this is the 
third war I've been through. It's time they were looked after and 
respected in the way they deserve."<br>
<br>
Springsteen became interested in the veteran's plight through his 
friendship with disable vet Ron Kovic; he asked his manager, Jon Landau,
 to research the various veterans organization to determine which is the
 most effective, and he decided to do the show after meeting with Muller
 and VVA vice-president Michael Harbert earlier this summer.<br>
<br>
"These are people of our generation – Bruce's, mine," said Landau. "I 
think Bruce saw a lot of his high-school friends go to Vietnam. It 
sounds corny, but these people we're trying to help could have been us 
if the circumstances had been a little different." Landau said he 
expects Springsteen to continue working for the veterans in different 
ways; an official Springsteen poster is already for sale, with all 
proceeds going to the VVA.<br>
<br>
Backstage after the Springsteen show, Muller was ecstatic about the 
support his group is suddenly getting. "We tried everything," said 
Muller of his three-year-old organization. "Corporations, foundations, 
direct mail. We got thirty-five editorials in the Washington Post in 
1978, but we didn't realize a single legislative objective. You can't 
push costly benefit programs through Congress with good arguments. You 
need political strength, and that means numbers."<br>
<br>
With only 8000 members, the VVA does not have that strength. But after 
years of maneuvering, the group finally obtained a list of 1 million 
Vietnam veterans, and money from the concerts will go towards a 
direct-mailing operation aimed at those vets. Muller said that a goal of
 50,000 members by spring and another 100,000 by the end of 1982 is 
realistic.<br>
<br>
"People don't like to think about the Vietnam vets, because everything 
about the war was negative," he said. "We shouldn't have been fighting, 
we lost. . . . But Bruce has publicly aligned himself with the lepers of
 our society and taken us out of the shadows."<br>
<br>
Springsteen made his commitment clear in his speech introducing Muller 
in Los Angeles. "It's like when you're walking down a dark street at 
night, and out of the corner of your eye you see somebody getting hurt 
in a dark alley," he said slowly. "But you keep walking on because you 
think it don't have nothing to do with you and you just want to get 
home. Vietnam turned this whole country into that dark street, and 
unless we can walk down those alleys and look into the eyes of those men
 and women, we're never gonna get home."</div>

<strong class="text-strong">Christopher Borick and David Rosenwasser<br>
Muhlenberg College<br>
 <br>
 Paper presented at the Bruce Springsteen Symposium, West Long Branch, New Jersey, September 26, 2009.<br>
 </strong><br>
 <br>
​In the mid-nineteenth century Walt Whitman advised a generation of 
fellow writers to “be radical, be radical, be not too damn radical.”  In
 offering this advice the Good Gray Poet recognized the tenuous position
 of the artist as social critic.  To affect societal change an artist 
must often challenge conventional ways of thinking and living.  Yet in 
these challenges artists risk alienating their audience and thus 
jeopardize their ability to stimulate social change.  Given these 
constraints artists must perennially struggle to reach a fragile balance
 between becoming so radical that their work is ignored or so conformist
 that they change nothing.<br>
 <br>
​Throughout much of his career Bruce Springsteen has used his art to 
directly challenge many aspects of contemporary American life.  While 
these critiques are multi faceted, it is generally accepted that 
Springsteen’s challenges are oriented towards the left wing of American 
politics. From his war of words with the Reagan White House to his 
direct assaults on the actions of the Bush Administration, Springsteen 
has been a persistent critic of conservative leaders and their policies.
 Most recently, Springsteen’s prominent role in the 2008 presidential 
campaign, capped by his pre-inaugural performance at the Lincoln 
Memorial, helped cement his prominent place on the left wing of American
 politics<br>
 <br>
​Yet even through his long time antagonism of the right, Springsteen has
 remained a popular mainstream artist whose audience includes many of 
the same older white males that are the bedrock of the contemporary GOP 
in America.  How is it that a liberal icon such as Springsteen has 
managed to preserve his appeal across ideological divides in the United 
States?  In this paper we argue that Springsteen has consistently 
utilized both symbols and language that are widely embraced by American 
conservatives, thus mitigating much of the polarizing effects that his 
art might otherwise produce.  From his focus on the honor of hard work 
to his utilization of the average man as a working class hero, 
Springsteen employees messages that are rife with conservative 
overtones. ​So what are Springsteen’s politics? Perhaps we will see him 
and his politics more accurately and understand his broad appeal more 
resonantly once we collapse the conventional binary of liberal or 
conservative and situate him in the more complex tangle of left and 
right, coast and heartland.<br>
 <br>
​In this article we focus most of our attention on the albums of the 
Bush years.  In many ways the 8 years that George Bush served in the 
White House were Bruce Springsteen’s most politically engaged period.  
From 2001 to 2009 Springsteen’s creative efforts turned more to 
political matters as he simultaneously became more intimately involved 
in political campaigns. Over the course of his career Springsteen shied 
away from endorsing candidates for public office.  While often critical 
of policies emanating from Republican administrations, the New Jersey 
artist did not engage directly in American electoral politics.<br>
<br>
This all changed in 2004 when Springsteen threw himself directly into 
the highly competitive presidential campaign between George Bush and 
John Kerry. During the campaign Springsteen leant his talents to the 
Vote for Change Tour that was seeking to raise both financial and voter 
support for Democratic nominee and his efforts to unseat Bush.  
Springsteen stated that the concerts were an effort “to put forward a 
group of ideals and change the administration in the White House. That's
 the success or failure (of this concert series), very clear cut and 
very simple."  <br>
<br>
As the 2004 race came to a close Springsteen made numerous appearances 
with Kerry at campaign rallies, often performing a number of songs at 
the events. During these events Springsteen discussed the reasons he had
 decided to jump into the electoral fray.  He noted that he had “been 
writing about America for 30 years, about who we are, what we stand for,
 what we fight for. I believe that these essential ideals of American 
identity are what’s at stake on November 2.” He called on the nation to 
face “America’ hard truths, both the good and the bad. "That's where we 
find a deeper patriotism, that's where we find a more complete view of 
who we are. That's where we find a more authentic experience as 
citizens, and that's where we find the power to make our world a better 
and a safer place. (Nichols 1)" While Springsteen’s efforts to get Kerry
 elected were ultimately unsuccessful, the failure did not result in a 
retreat from involvement in presidential campaigns.<br>
<br>
During the 2008 presidential race Springsteen once again emerged as a 
presence on the campaign trail, this time offering support for 
Democratic nominee Barack Obama.  This time the popular artist held 
concerts by himself to rally support for Obama’s presidential bid.  
Springsteen performed at three large free events in key swing states 
(Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan).   In a concert before 50,000 
individuals on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia, 
Springsteen told the audience “I don’t know about you, but I want my 
house back, I want my America back, and I want my country back."  He 
also stated that he had spent his life “ measuring the distance between 
the American Dream and the American Reality,” and that "Barack Obama has
 taken that measure as well. Never has the gap between the Dream and 
Reality been greater.  In the end Springsteen called for an “American 
Reclamation Project” that would clean up the mess left behind by the 
Bush Administration (Panaritis et al. 1).<br>
<br>
While the Bush years would prove to be the period of Springsteen’s most 
direct political involvement, they also marked an era where his artistry
 became more focused on political subject matter.  During the time that 
George W. Bush resided in the White House Springsteen would release four
 albums of new material; The Rising (2002); Devils and Dust (2005); 
Magic (2007); and Working on A Dream (2009). With the exception of 
Working on a Dream, these albums regularly dealt with the politics of 
the times and the policies that Bush was enacting as Chief Executive.  
In The Rising Springsteen concentrates on the loss and emptiness that 
followed the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, generally 
refraining from critiques on the policy questions that surrounded the 
event and its aftermath.  One notable exception was the album’s first 
song, Lonesome Day, in which Springsteen offers a prophetic warning 
about the type of military response that would be enacted as a result of
 the terrorist strikes.  In the song Springsteen advises those in power 
to “ask questions before you shoot/deceit and betrayal’s bitter fruit.” 
as the nation steadily moved towards war in Iraq. The eventual war that 
came would serve as the catalyst for much of Springsteen’s work in his 
next two albums, Devils and Dust and Magic.  In these albums, and in 
particular Magic, Springsteen would delve deeper into political matters 
than he had done at anytime during his long career.  We will explore 
these albums in more detail later in the article.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s actions on the campaign trails and his art clearly 
established him as one of George W. Bush’s most notable critics and 
positioned the artist on the left of American politics.  But even as 
Springsteen became a more visible presence in the polarizing world of 
American politics, he remained a very popular figure in the 
entertainment world.  His iconic status was verified in 2009 when he was
 invited to perform at the consummately mainstream Super Bowl halftime 
show.  And despite modest attendance at his Seeger’s Sessions concerts 
in 2006, Springsteen’s tour stops with the E Street band continued to 
draw crowds similar to those throughout his career.  His Magic album and
 its criticism of Bush administration policies sold over a million 
copies in the United States alone.  By most measures Springsteen remains
 a popular figure who maintains a broad audience even as he has become 
more explicitly partisan in his politics.  <br>
<br>
In the remainder of the paper we explore the ways that Bruce Springsteen
 has been able to remain a popular mainstream artist while taking 
political stances that are often at odds with portions of his audience. 
 Walt Whitman believed that an artist could lose his ability to connect 
with a larger audience by becoming too radical, thus reducing their 
cultural impact.  Bruce Springsteen has held that he wants to “find an 
audience that would be a reflection of some imagined community that I 
had in my head, that lived according to the values in my music and a 
shared set of ideals” (Dawidoff  252). Notably he sees this audience not
 only made up of liberals but conservatives.  Springtseen said that 
“people come to my shows with many different kinds of political beliefs;
 I like that, we welcome all.”  But while Springsteen may welcome all, 
how do his politically charged art and personal statements avoid 
alienating his more conservative fans?<br>
<br>
To answer this question we look at Springsteen’s artistic efforts in 
Devils and Dust and Magic through an examination of the language and 
writing techniques that he employs in his artistry.  It is in these 
tools that Springsteen’s political engagement pushes beyond the partisan
 and reaches to a broader audience that includes both liberal and 
conservatives, Republicans and Democrats.  His choice of words and 
styles allows him to do the cultural work that he believes necessary.  
Springsteen is concerned about the direction that his country took under
 the leadership of the Bush Administration and is working to win support
 among fellow Americans who may or may not share his political leanings,
 but who he feels may share his broader values and ideals. He does not 
attempt to hide his politics as a means of avoiding the radicalism that 
Whitman warned about.  Instead his selection of lyrics, use of 
individual relationships and dramatic monologues allows him to delve 
into political subject matter without assaulting conservatives. In fact 
Springsteen makes artistic choices that may resonate with conservatives 
as well as liberals.<br>
<br>
While Springsteen’s words on the campaign trail may be overtly partisan,
 his art remains devoid of direct frontal assaults on both Republicans 
and conservatives.  Springsteen never mentions the words George Bush, 
Dick Cheney, Republican, Iraq, Abu Ghraib, or torture in any of the Bush
 Albums.  Instead the albums of the Bush years are filled with words 
such as home, drift, flag, work and blood.  These lyrical choices by no 
means engender immediate anger from conservative leaning listeners.  In 
fact many of Springsteen’s word choices may resonate with Republican 
political narratives that have emerged in the United States. For 
conservatives there is a longing for an America from the past.  The 
sense that the nation has been taken off course by bad leadership 
permeates much of the contemporary conservative discourse and Republican
 narratives. The current backlash against President Barack Obama’s 
policy agenda provides a perfect example of this longing for a return to
 some vision of a past America.  Without knowing Springsteen’s political
 leanings it would be hard to identify anything in the Bush Year albums 
that would peg him as a liberal.  Instead his focus on veterans, work 
and home make his messages easily accessible to the conservatives in his
 audience.  In addition, Springtseen’s regular use of heterosexual 
relationships as part of the political storylines of his songs provides 
an accessible entry point to his art for conservatives.<br>
<br>
Perhaps no song better captures Springsteen’s Bush Era interests and 
stylistic choices than “Long Walk Home” off the Magic album. In this 
piece Springsteen deals in great measure with the concepts of home and 
drift within the realm of contemporary American life.  The song is set 
in a typical American town, with common features such as grocery stores,
 a veterans’ hall, barbershop and courthouse. While the setting is 
familiar, the narrator of the song is not at home.  The people of these 
familiar places are “rank strangers” to the narrator as he passes 
through town.<br>
<br>
The lyrics in “Long Walk Home” could come as easily from a country music
 song as easily as they may eminent from a progressive rock artist. In 
the following stanza Springsteen calls on a vocabulary that would strike
 a chord with any conservative.  A father and son, neighbors, flags and 
values set in stone all take central places in the song.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<em class="text-italics">Here everybody has a neighbor<br>
Everybody has a friend<br>
Everybody has a reason to begin again<br>
<br>
My father said "Son, we're lucky in this town,<br>
It's a beautiful place to be born.<br>
It just wraps its arms around you,<br>
Nobody crowds you and nobody goes it alone"<br>
<br>
"Your flag flyin' over the courthouse<br>
Means certain things are set in stone.<br>
Who we are, what we'll do and what we won't"</em><br>
 <br>
While Springsteen’s answers to “who we are, what we'll do and what we 
won't" are likely quite different than those of a conservative member of
 his audience, there is nothing in the song that would act to alienate a
 fan with right leaning politics.  In particular Springsteen’s reference
 to “what we won’t” do seems to be referencing policies such as<br>
torture of prisoners in Iraq, but leaves considerable room for 
interpretation on the part of his desired audience of liberals and 
conservatives.<br>
*   *   *<br>
So let’s briefly rehearse the story we are trying to tell about 
Springsteen’s artistry as it intersects with his politics. He is an 
artist who believes that his songs do cultural work. As Bryan Garman has
 demonstrated abundantly in his book A Race of Singers, Springsteen not 
only belongs in the tradition of Whitman and Guthrie but is keenly aware
 of himself as carrying on that tradition of—choose your term: populist 
singer of songs?  visionary American idealist? Working class white guy 
on a social mission inseparable from his sense of sacred vocation? 
Springsteen says as much to Jon Stewart in his Daily Show interview last
 March: “you try to find a show that [. . .] contains some way to 
capture the moment that’s occurring out in the world right now.”<br>
<br>
This notion of popular art as capturing the moment implies that 
Springsteen’s art is less interested in moralizing about what America 
should be doing than in allowing us to see ourselves. As Garman has put,
 “Springsteen does not issue a manifesto for change as much as he 
delivers a state of the union address” (211). In the Bush albums, we 
wish to suggest, the state of the union is one of existential 
homelessness and national anomie—a condition that leads Springsteen to 
press for the reconstitution of community as a first step in regaining 
some sense of individual and collective destiny.  <br>
<br>
​As the Bush presidency continued to erode the faith of an increasing 
number of Americans in the integrity of our representative democracy, 
Springsteen’s sense of mission seems to intensify, issuing forth in the 
four albums we are calling the Bush albums. Like any artist, Springsteen
 has evolved, perhaps unconsciously, a vocabulary for this task, and as 
we have constructed our lexicon of Springsteen key terms, we’ve been 
struck by their homology with those that Thomas Frank, in What’s the 
Problem with Kansas?, identifies with the Republican narrative of 
individualism and victimization of the white working class, a narrative 
Frank argues has seduced this block of voters away from their 
traditional allegiance to the Democratic Party.<br>
Home, faith, flag, love, work . . . these are the terms, as Chris has 
suggested in his discussion of “Long Walk Home,” that dominate the Bush 
albums.<br>
<br>
​The opposite of home in the Bush albums is a place called Nowhere. Home
 and Nowhere comprise an essential ideological geography in 
Springsteen’s imagination. It is significant that in song after song the
 speaker does not actually get there. “Long Walk Home” is a signal 
instance, but we hear it as well in  “This Life” from Working on a 
Dream: “This emptiness I’ve roamed/ Searching for a home.” This site is 
of course not just literal but a figure for nation. “I want my house 
back, I want my country back. I want my America back,” Springsteen has 
said; and we hear in these words the desire to enter some halcyon 
version of the past. And when that attempt inevitably fails, the singer 
is stranded in Nowhere.<br>
<br>
​As listeners to Nebraska know, his speakers have been there before. 
“State Trooper” ends with the haunting plea, “Hey, somebody out there, 
listen to my last prayer/Hiho silver-o, deliver me from nowhere.” And 
this refrain is repeated two songs later, in “Open All Night”: “Radio’s 
jammed up with gospel stations lost souls callin’ long distance 
salvation/Hey, mister deejay, woncha hear my last prayer hey, ho, 
rock’n’roll, deliver me from nowhere.”<br>
​We have cited these songs to make clear that the song with which 
Springsteen opens Magic, “Radio Nowhere,” is a return to this earlier 
trope of rock’n’roll on the radio as the medium of deliverance.<br>
<br>
​It is of course a rousing tune—a rock anthem—but in the repeated chant 
that ends the song, “I just want to feel your rhythm,” we can also hear 
the tones of lament. A Utopian desire to constitute a community has not 
(yet) been fulfilled.<br>
​The opening line of the song makes clear the singer’s intent: he is 
“trying to find [his] way home” and can only hear the “drone” that is 
“crushin’ the last lone American night.” He is also “searchin’ for a 
world with some soul” and asking, “Is there anybody alive out there?”; 
this query gets repeated throughout the song. As these lines suggest, 
rather apocalyptically, the cultural default setting here is death and 
soullessness. The speaker is crying out for community on a last American
 night, and there is no evidence that anyone out there is alive.<br>
<br>
​Given the song’s placement as the first tune on Magic, it is difficult 
not, finally, to interpret it as an upbeat quest to transform Nowhere 
into a kind of home. It is an opening incantation, the beginning of the 
Magic Springsteen believes his songs, in league with the radio, can 
inspire. The album itself, like the singer in this first song, is 
“trying to make a connection to you.” This is the home Springsteen sees 
now, embodied in the bodilessness of the airwaves. An aural rather than a
 physical home is the only one his singer can inhabit as he attempts to 
create a community through his music.<br>
​It is tempting to see Magic as a response to the legacy of the Bush 
presidency—a desperate sense of dislocation, dispossession of our own 
land, alienation from our own idealism.<br>
<br>
“Radio Nowhere” seeks to constitute an audience in Nowhere that wishes 
to have its old home back but realizes it cannot, and so must build a 
new one. One thinks of a line from a Springsteen interview: “What we 
need now is an American Reclamation Project.”<br>
<br>
​ We are suggesting in short that “Radio Nowhere” is a kind of ars 
poetica for Springsteen, a declaration of his artistic project. And for 
this project, the radio is an apt and complex symbol of his attempt to 
maintain his patriotic hope in the face of displacement and change. Is 
the radio an emblem of invisible connection, cementing us together by 
the magic of a voice across the airwaves, as the tone of this rock 
anthem suggests? Or is it an increasingly anachronistic candle 
flickering as rock and roll expires, leaving the voice on the radio, 
plaintively, to repeat again and again. “I just want to hear some 
rhythm,” because, alas, he does not hear any?<br>
<br>
​In any case, it’s clear that the appeal to an audience by way of the 
radio is a standard and essential element of the way Springsteen thinks 
about the reception of his art. In one interview he speaks of listening 
to the radio as a boy and thinking, “It was music that gave me a sense 
that life could be and should be about more than I had in front of me” 
(Dawidoff 251). And later in the interview he comments, “I set out to 
find an audience that would be a reflection of some imagined community 
that I had in my head, that lived according to the values in my music 
and shared a similar set of ideals” (Dawidoff 252). It is this imagined 
community that is the locus of hope in the Bush albums.<br>
<br>
​Speaking to an audience on his European tour in 1981, Springsteen 
addresses what we might call his politics of radio, linking it, as 
delivery system, to the political message he wishes to communicate. He 
says, “It wasn’t until I started listening to the radio and I heard 
something in those singer’s voices that said there was more to life than
 what my old man was doing and the life that I was living. And they held
 out a promise, and it was a promise that every man had the right to 
live his life with some decency and some dignity. And it’s a promise 
that gets broken every day in the most violent way. But it’s a promise 
that never, ever dies, and it’s always inside of you.” (qtd in Jim 
Cullen, Born in the U.S.A.: Bruce Springsteen and the American 
Tradition, Wesleyan University Press)<br>
<br>
These words, which give voice to what we might call Springsteen’s 
sentimental faith in democracy, provide a useful gloss of “Radio 
Nowhere.” They suggest how powerfully his patriotism is situated in his 
working class roots, how strongly it is allied to his work ethic, and 
how inextricably it is woven into his sense of a communitarian voice 
uniting us across the airwaves. This is the conservative Springsteen, 
spreading the word for the American dream of unlimited possibility for 
the individual. But although Springsteen says this “promise never dies,”
 he also calls it “a promise that gets broken every day in the most 
violent way.”<br>
 <br>
We want to move now to what we find most interesting and most 
overlooked—at least in the Springsteen literature that I have 
sampled—about his politics and how he conveys this politics in his art.<br>
In his interview with Jon Stewart, Springsteen jokes that when members 
of his audience who are conservative and blue-collared reject his 
political statements, they boo, but he pretends they are saying Bruce.<br>
<br>
It seems clear that he wishes to reach an audience beyond the already 
converted, including those who may be skeptical of his apparently 
liberal positions. This faction of his audience, We believe, is a 
constituency that Springsteen does not see as alien to his political 
vision. They are genuine citizens of Nowhere; they just don’t know it 
yet, and this is what Springsteen’s art wishes to awaken them to.<br>
We have seen already that the political content of Springsteen’s 
vision—particularly its vocabulary—blurs the line between conventionally
 liberal, Democratic politics and conventionally conservative, 
Republican politics. This is most evident in the recurrent reference to 
individualism, home, country, faith, etc.<br>
<br>
But a second source of ambiguity lies in the mode of presentation of 
many of Springsteen’s songs. We are speaking of what in literary study 
is known as dramatic monologue: the creation of characters who are not 
Springsteen, or put another way, his fondness for ventriloquizing the 
voices of others in the first-person songs he sings. This is also a 
common feature of the ballad tradition of popular song. In any case, 
thinking of Springsteen’s method in these terms—and one would be hard 
pressed to find a popular artist who uses it more frequently than he 
does—provides a useful entry point into his politics, especially as we 
wish to suggest that his method implies a politics at the level of form.<br>
<br>
M.H. Abrams, in his famous Glossary of Literary Terms, attributes three 
defining characteristics to the dramatic monologue: (1) a speaker who is
 not the poet uttering a speech that occupies the entire poem at a 
critical moment; (2) an auditor whom we know of, but only from clues in 
the speaker’s speech; and (3) the use of the speech primarily to reveal 
the character of the speaker. The emphasis, in other words, lies less on
 what the speech says about the world than on what it says about the 
speaker (M. H. Abrams &amp; Geoffrey Galt Harpham, A Glossary of 
Literary Terms, 8th ed., Boston: Wadsworth, 2005, p70).<br>
<br>
​As our exemplary instance, we’ve chosen “Devils &amp; Dust,” the first 
song on the album of that name.  Here’s the first stanzaz:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">I got my finger on the trigger<br>
But I don't know who to trust<br>
When I look into your eyes<br>
There's just devils and dust<br>
We're a long, long way from home, Bobbie<br>
Home's a long, long way from us<br>
I feel a dirty wind blowing<br>
Devils and dust</em><br>
<br>
You can see how completely the song meets Abrams’ criteria. The singer 
is not Bruce Springsteen but an invented character, an American soldier 
“a long, long way from home,” and amidst the dust, probably therefore in
 Iraq. He is addressing an invisible auditor, Bobbie, and with his 
“finger on the trigger,” presumably in a moment of some crisis.<br>
In the next stanza the speaker begins to confess his own fear-caused soul sickness.<br>
<em class="text-italics"><br>
I got God on my side<br>
And I'm just trying to survive<br>
What if what you do to survive<br>
Kills the things you love?<br>
Fear's a powerful thing, Bobbie<br>
It can turn your heart black you can trust<br>
It'll take your God filled soul<br>
And fill it with devils and dust</em><br>
<br>
We wish we had the time to dwell closely with the lyrics and the 
analysis they offer of the corrosive effects of fear, and the price that
 exacts on our sense of who we as Americans are in the world. It’s at 
that level, the level of sweat on the skin, that Springsteen 
politicizes. His is the embodied politics of the human voice. And in 
song after song, Springsteen gives us glimpses of American life less in 
his own voice than in the ventriloquized voice of one or another blue 
collared, working class characters—the same kinds of characters who 
speak the language that Thomas Frank claims the Republican Party 
captured from the Democrats 40 years ago.<br>
<br>
​Obviously, to present a song in this way is a lot different from 
telling it in the third person—“The soldier’s finger’s on the 
trigger/And he don’t know who to trust.”  It’s also a lot different from
 lecturing his audience in declamatory fashion: “Our boys in Iraq are 
victims of an unthinking foreign policy that cynically conflates all 
Arabs with all terrorists, etc.”<br>
​The decision to rely on dramatic monologue is itself political, and so 
it’s worth pondering what the implicit politics are of this 
presentational mode.<br>
<br>
​Dramatic monologue is at least indirect if not actually evasive. 
Consider what is unsaid in Springsteen‘s song, the political terms one 
never finds: no policies, no liberals, no conservatives, no Democrats, 
no Republicans, no Bush, no Obama either.<br>
​Moreover, the way the form has speaking characters who are not the 
author reveal themselves creates interpretative challenges for the 
audience. For example, the speaker in “Devils &amp; Dust” believes that 
he has God on his side, but does the song think so? Probably not, 
especially because the speaker comes to see that his fear has polluted 
his “God filled soul.” Dramatic monologue is always asking the listener 
to answer the question, what is the song’s (or Springsteen’s) point of 
view of the character’s (the speaker’s) point of view?  <br>
<br>
​But as Springsteen has made clear in interviews, the use of dramatic 
monologue is not a canny and perhaps cynical political move to mask his 
real, radical political agenda.  Rather, it seems to be less a strategic
 choice than a creative imperative. “I’m just trying to find a story,” 
he says; “I didn’t start out with a specific political point of view. I 
don’t sit down and write with political intentions. It’s much more 
internal” (Dawidoff 260, 264).<br>
<br>
And again, describing his process: “I was creating intimate portraits of
 individuals that you can draw back from and look at them in the context
 of the country they live in. You have to find circumstances where those
 characters resonate with psychological, emotional and, by implication, 
political issues” (Dawidoff 259).<br>
<br>
​“I’m just trying to find a story.” Springsteen’s art begins with the 
voices he hears. “The things I’ve written about best [. . .],” he says, 
“are things I know about. The idea of the wasted life. The idea of the 
pure unkindness of the world’ (Dawidoff 24). It’s tempting, then, to see
 at the heart of his work the stories and sentiments he shares with a 
largely Republican and conservative constituency. “Devils &amp; Dust” is
 the story of a boy like Springsteen who encounters the unkindness of 
the world and who, perhaps, is wasting his life:<br>
<em class="text-italics"><br>
Now every woman and every man<br>
They wanna take a righteous stand<br>
Find the love that God wills<br>
And the faith that He commands<br>
I've got my finger on the trigger<br>
And tonight faith just ain't enough<br>
When I look inside my heart<br>
There's just devils and dust</em><br>
<br>
To understand the tragedy of American involvement in Iraq, this song 
seems to be saying, simple and clear positions such as “pro-war” or 
“anti-war” won’t cut it. We need to step into the shoes of the soldier, 
sing along with “fear’s a dangerous thing.” If this song does not have a
 vision, it is at least doing the hard work of preparing us for a 
vision.<br>
​In “Devils &amp; Dust” and the other dramatic monologues of the Bush 
albums, Springsteen invokes the “imagined community” of Radio Nowhere to
 listen. He does not tell them what to believe. Instead, he lets them 
hear what one invented person believes, one story. He asks them to 
sympathize with and evaluate this one person’s plight.  <br>
​Which may bring us to the heart not only of the implicit politics of 
dramatic monologue but of Springsteen’s essential political vision.<br>
<br>
​Dramatic monologue gives its audience interpretive work to do—a kind of
 spiritual exercise worthy of Springsteen’s Catholic upbringing. His 
working class speakers may value plain speaking, but Springsteen clearly
 does not: we must psychologize and wrestle with the speaker’s 
chauvinistic appropriation of God in “Devils &amp; Dust,” for instance.<br>
Dramatic monologue exacts listening, requiring us to understand before 
we judge. It teaches tolerance and charity, for the voices Springsteen 
inhabits are never condescended to, probably because they are embodied 
rather than objectified. Dramatic monologue ventriloquizes the voices of
 others—it is a medium through which America can view itself.<br>
<br>
​The art of Springsteen, we am coming to see, is an art that straddles 
binaries, that protests the reductive and violent contrasts they 
require. Pro-war and anti-war, liberal and conservative—these are 
oppositions that the Bush albums belie. For all his storied brashness, 
the Springsteen of the last decade has been a humbler and more 
reflective voice among us.<br>
​Here is how he sees the Bush years, in that Daily Show interview: 
“We’ve had an enormous moral, spiritual, economic collapse. People go to
 storytellers when those times are like that.  And our band is built 
from the beginning for hard times; that was the music we wrote, that was
 the way that we played.  And so we think that trying to sort of, I 
think people out there right now, they’re looking for, the country’s 
lost its moral center.”<br>
​Springsteen knows too much to think he can supply that moral center. 
But he is storyteller enough to show us where and how to start looking 
for it.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Coda</strong><br>
​We have argued that dramatic monologue gives the reader or listener a 
lot of interpretive work to do, and I have perhaps shirked mine in not 
carrying to completion what the implicit politics of “Devils &amp; Dust”
 are.<br>
<br>
Speaking to an audience on his European tour in 1981, Springsteen 
addresses what we might call his politics of radio, linking it, as 
delivery system, to the political message he wishes to communicate. He 
says, “It wasn’t until I started listening to the radio and I heard 
something in those singer’s voices that said there was more to life than
 what my old man was doing and the life that I was living. And they held
 out a promise, and it was a promise that every man had the right to 
live his life with some decency and some dignity. And it’s a promise 
that gets broken every day in the most violent way. But it’s a promise 
that never, ever dies, and it’s always inside of you.” (qtd in Jim 
Cullen, Born in the U.S.A.: Bruce Springsteen and the American 
Tradition, Wesleyan University Press)<br>
<br>
​“Devils &amp; Dust” tells a story of the speaker’s loss of faith and 
change of heart. By the end of the song, although he reasserts that 
“I’ve got God on my side,” he is also aware that what he has had to do 
to survive and the fear he has experienced have killed the things he 
loved, blackened his heart, and filled his soul with devils and dust.<br>
<br>
​So what? It suggests that the human cost of our presence in Iraq is 
impossibly high, and that is just considering the effect on our own 
people, not those whose country we have occupied. It suggests that the 
working class men and women who have believed in the promise of 
America—that every person had the right to live his or her life with 
some decency and some dignity—have become casualties.<br>
<br>
​On NPR recently a commentator was claiming that a new trend in the 
right has been to make strong claims for how the constitution and 
existing laws were passed down directly from God. “Devils &amp; Dust” is
 a demonstration, an expose even, of the terrible toll exacted by the 
Right’s appeals to God and faith.<br>
<br>
If the country is to find—to use Springsteen’s phrase to Jon Stewart—its
 moral center, “Devils &amp; Dust” suggests it will not do so by 
cynically appealing to religious faith, nor will it do so as long as we 
keep our fingers on the trigger.<br>
How finally then do we understand the politics of Springsteen? He’s got a
 Democratic ideology, a Republican vocabulary, and a Populist delivery 
system.</div></blockquote></div>

<strong class="text-strong">There’s Something Happening Somewhere: 30 Years Of Born In The U.S.A.<br>
<br>
June 4th 2014 by Ryan Leas<br>
<br>
Stereogum.</strong><br>
</span><br>
<br>
For you to remember the first time you heard Born In The U.S.A., you 
have to be above a certain age. It’s just one of those albums. Once it 
was out there, it was ubiquitous. That tends to happen when you produce 
seven top ten singles from one album, or when a record goes platinum, 
let alone fifteen times over. The latter distinction means that Born In 
The U.S.A. sold about 15 million copies in America, a number that seems 
like total and complete fantasy compared to the anemic record industry 
of today, and one that ranks it within the top twenty or so highest 
selling albums, ever, in this country. This is not the kind of situation
 where you are still able to hear a record entirely on its own original 
terms, with remotely fresh ears. Even if you somehow all your life 
avoided hearing its title track, or “Dancing In The Dark,” or “Glory 
Days,” Born In The U.S.A. is the sort of work that, by virtue of its 
sheer magnitude and inevitable overexposure, comes with a whole lot of 
years of baggage down the line.<br>
<br>
As of today, that would be thirty years of baggage, to be exact. Three 
decades on, Born In The U.S.A. has a shifting and at times conflicted 
legacy. In pop history, it’s simple enough — it’s one of the defining 
records of the ’80s, the one that jettisoned Springsteen to true 
superstar status. It’s one of those albums that’s never hard to find on a
 rack at Target or whatever, next to Thriller or Dark Side Of The Moon 
or Metallica. Those albums that I guess somebody somewhere will always 
feel like buying, the sort of stuff that’s never really out of style 
because it’s at such a level as to be beyond trends altogether. In 
Springsteen terms, it gets a little more complicated. Born In The U.S.A.
 is the Springsteen album for a certain generation of fans, and 
something else for those who came before or after. Every now and then 
I’ll talk to an older fan who still grimaces at memories of Born In The 
U.S.A. as the album where Bruce got too big, too pop, perhaps even sold 
out — if that’s still a thing you can really do when you were already on
 the covers of Newsweek and Time in the same week a decade prior. 
They’ll value the preceding six albums in a different way, maybe 
considering them more authentic. With a career as long and varied as 
Springsteen’s you’re bound to get those sorts of divides in a fanbase. 
Even something as widely beloved as “Backstreets” has been played 
frequently enough at Springsteen’s shows that it’s someone’s holy moment
 and someone else’s cue to go buy another beer. The dividing line always
 struck me as a bit more severe with Born In The U.S.A. tracks, though. 
Maybe you’re enraptured when “Dancing In The Dark” inevitably pops up in
 the encore, maybe you head to the parking lot early. (But if you’re the
 latter, I’m not sure we can be friends.)<br>
<br>
Before we get too far down this rabbithole, it might be necessary to 
issue a disclaimer. I’m already on record, in a few places, about the 
extent of my Springsteen fandom, and the resulting amount of thought I 
put into his music. It’s only in the last year or two, however, where 
I’ve begun to listen to Born In The U.S.A. more than any of this other 
work. I don’t know what would be in second place, but it isn’t close. 
There are days when it’s my favorite Springsteen album. There are days 
when I think it’s a perfect album, and other days when I’m a bit more 
sensible and realize that if “My Love Will Not Let You Down” had taken 
the place of “Cover Me,” and if “Janey Don’t You Lose Heart” had 
replaced “Glory Days,” then it would’ve been perfect. (And, still, there
 are other days where I realize those maybe still wouldn’t fit, even if 
they’re brilliant.) And then, just about everyday, “Dancing In The Dark”
 is pretty much my favorite song ever. What I’m getting at here is that 
we’re dealing with a bias on my part.<br>
<br>
But, more importantly, I’m also getting at the fact that I’m one of 
those Springsteen fans who grew up with Born In The U.S.A. as something 
that was just in the air, the most ever-present material from an 
ever-present artist, and it’s only in recent years where I’ve started to
 get truly obsessed with the thing, where I’ve learned to find personal 
resonance in an album that’s too easy to take for granted due to its 
inherent ubiquity. The weird thing about an album so readily ranked in 
the “Classic” category by every other rock retrospective of one form or 
another, is that people can just start to think of it as This Thing That
 Happened, a piece of work from some distant time and place that has 
little meaning to them. This is the territory in which an album like 
Born In The U.S.A., against most logical expectations, could become 
underrated.<br>
<br>
Back around the time Springsteen released Magic in 2007, he was well 
into a career resurgence following a mixed bag of a decade in the ’90s. 
There were many factors to this, but one of them was that he’d attained a
 certain hipness in the ’00s; as Stephen M. Deusner put it in his review
 of Magic, Springsteen had replaced Brian Wilson as the “indie ideal.”<br>
<br>
Bands like the Gaslight Anthem, the Hold Steady, and the Killers bore 
the influence sonically, where others like the National and the Arcade 
Fire were perhaps more so thematic descendants. Without fail, when 
people talk about Springsteen’s influence on pockets of this century’s 
generation of indie-rock, it’s easiest to draw the line back to Darkness
 On The Edge Of Town or Nebraska (especially in the case of Dirty 
Beaches).<br>
<br>
Born In The U.S.A. gets a little less credit, but at times it feels like
 perhaps the most important Springsteen record when it comes to newer 
artists being influenced by his work. Given the age of some of these 
musicians, this is the one that would’ve been new when they were kids, 
just getting into music; chances are, it was the formative one. They 
would’ve been the young fans for whom this was their Springsteen album. 
Before they went all Sandinista! on Reflektor, Arcade Fire’s anthemic 
qualities seemed more in the lineage of Born In The U.S.A.-era Bruce, 
the themes of The Suburbs a mash-up of stuff like “My Hometown” and 
“Downbound Train” with Darkness and The River. Tellingly, when Win 
Butler chose his fourteen favorite Springsteen songs for Rolling Stone 
in 2010, most of them were from the ’80s. Butler might’ve gone onstage 
to play Nebraska’s “State Trooper” with the man himself, but when it 
came time for Arcade Fire to cover the Boss, they chose “Born In The 
U.S.A..” At this point, “I’m On Fire” seems destined to live on as a 
standard of sorts. You’ve got everyone from Mumford &amp; Sons to 
Chromatics covering it. Gaslight Anthem frontman Brian Fallon, long the 
Springsteen acolyte, has been known to perform it solo, while his band’s
 own “High Lonesome” quotes/references the song.<br>
<br>
As of late, the War On Drugs might be leading the pack in terms of 
indie-rock’s debt to Springsteen. Any cursory listen to stuff like “Baby
 Missiles,” or material from this year’s Lost In The Dream — 
particularly “Burning” — most evokes the synth-y roots rock of Born In 
The U.S.A. (Sometimes I wonder whether Adam Granduciel has actually been
 listening to Born In The U.S.A. outtake demos like these.) On his So 
Outta Reach EP, Granduciel’s former bandmate Kurt Vile did a stellar 
version of “Downbound Train” that approximates what might’ve happened if
 Dinosaur Jr. were big fans of the Boss.<br>
<br>
There are plenty examples of contemporary musicians looking elsewhere in
 Springsteen’s catalog (the National covering “Mansion On The Hill,” the
 Hold Steady doing “Atlantic City”), but I’m not trying to say Darkness 
or Nebraska don’t loom large, because they do. The point here is that 
Born In The U.S.A. is somewhat sidelined in the conversation even though
 it has a fundamental presence in the music of these artists. It’s not 
exactly hard to understand why. That same ubiquity I had to work my way 
into is simply prohibitive to other would-be Springsteen fans. Where 
Nebraska’s bleak, lo-fi quality is a logical entry point for a younger, 
more indie-oriented listener, Born In The U.S.A. is saddled with a few 
potential deal-breakers. The production is exceedingly ’80s, and not 
necessarily in a way of “this synthesizer sound is really cool and would
 become very popular in Brooklyn in 2008-2010,” but more like “This just
 sounds old.” Or, perhaps even worse, some of the synths have a 
surprisingly cheap sound to them that could hinder songs like “Bobby 
Jean” or “Dancing In The Dark” if a listener is prone to find these 
kinds of tones cheesy. Maybe the most damning quality is that this is 
the album with famous songs like “Glory Days,” which isn’t too many 
steps removed from artists like John Mellencamp, which makes it easy to 
lump Springsteen in with those lame heartland rockers of the time, even 
this many years down the road.<br>
<br>
Actually, the most damning quality is probably the song “Born In The 
U.S.A.” itself. It seems to represent some unlikeable quality about 
Springsteen to people. I had a friend in college who loved Nebraska, was
 totally unaware that Springsteen had also written “Born In The U.S.A.,”
 and was totally disgusted at this revelation and demanded to not know 
anymore, lest I ruin Nebraska for her. Its bombastic qualities can be 
hard to get past, I suppose; it’s only recently that it’s become one of 
my favorite tracks on the album. But, amazingly, there still seem to be 
people who interpret this as some sort of jingoistic anthem, or at the 
very least some hollow triumphant rave-up, when it of course has a lot 
more going on. The same qualities that might turn off someone who just 
hears it as an obnoxious patriotic song from Reagan’s America are the 
same that keep it around as the sort of song that can cranked out in a 
baseball stadium. It can be played over and over to large gatherings of 
people who may not really care about music, because it’s so famous and 
overexposed that nobody will get overly mad or happy about it, which 
doesn’t necessarily make it the sort of thing a new listener would be 
eager to engage with. And as the meaning of the song subsides into 
historical footnotes (though it’s not hard to transpose its lyrics to 
our own wars in Afghanistan and Iraq), these qualities are only made 
worse.<br>

Which, I suppose, fair enough: I’m a firm believer than once you put a 
piece of art out into the world, it ceases being totally yours, and how 
it’s received and interpreted becomes as much a part of its story as the
 original intent. But, I mean, still — the lyrics of “Born In The 
U.S.A.” are very, very direct and it’s hard to imagine people in a time 
as media-savvy as ours still hearing that big chorus and missing the 
ironic undercut of the whole thing. It’s there musically, too. “Born In 
The U.S.A.” exists in a Nebraska-esque demo from before Springsteen 
decided to pursue a new rock record instead. It’s every bit as haunting 
as you’d expect from the preceding album’s tone, and it sounds very 
little like the finished product. (For a much more in-depth breakdown of
 the song’s complicated origins, check out Mark Richardson’s post from 
the collaborative Bruce Springsteen One Week//One Band we both 
participated in last year.) Even with Springsteen’s style generally 
falling squarely in the “earnestness” column, I can’t help but hear the 
over-the-top anthemic qualities of “Born In The U.S.A.” as a mechanism 
to pull out the song’s dark roots and make them that much worse. He was 
fully aware of what he was doing at this point. When Springsteen sings a
 lyric like “I’m a cool rocking daddy in the U.S.A.” over this backbeat,
 but surrounded by these lyrics, it’s difficult to see how the phrase 
“Born In The U.S.A.” could be misinterpreted as anything but the disgust
 it represented. The synths sound queasy themselves, especially in the 
song’s ride-out, striking a dissonance that sums up the distance between
 the pride supposedly evoked in the song’s title and the story it tells.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of other places on Born In The U.S.A. that also don’t 
immediately reveal their darkness. To return briefly to the argument I 
made last year in the Springsteen Counting Down, one of the reasons Born
 In The U.S.A. is so great, one of the reasons it remains one of his 
most important albums, is that it’s the one where he mingles realism and
 romanticism the most deftly. “Dancing In The Dark” is an infectious pop
 song, but most of its lyrics relate desperation: “There’s something 
happening somewhere/Baby, I just know that there is,” one of those 
perfectly Springsteen-esque sentiments. The story in “Dancing In The 
Dark” is based in the same kind of realities as “Downbound Train” or 
“Working On The Highway,” or of songs before any of them on The River 
and Darkness, but the tone is one of yearning. There’s just that much 
more amount of gloss, just that little bit of measured romanticism let 
in.<br>
<br>
That combination is why there’s a strong case to be made for Born In The
 U.S.A. being the quintessential Springsteen album, the one that 
everything beforehand was leading to. In hindsight, it’s also come to be
 seen as the end of Springsteen’s peak era, with all of his first seven 
albums being more or less critically adored in the subsequent decades, 
and everything post Born In The U.S.A. subject to more debate. It’s the 
pivot point: everything after it exists in relation to it. This is the 
case not only because of its commercial stature amongst Springsteen’s 
catalog and pop music in general, but also because this is the album 
most representative of everything Springsteen was and is as an artist. 
With the benefit of thirty years to situate itself, Born In The U.S.A. 
feels like a centerpiece around which the rest of Springsteen’s career 
revolves, the one perfect distillation of all the stories he wanted to 
tell and all the voices he wanted to tell them in.<br>
<br>
Having grown up in a depressed nowhere-ish town in Pennsylvania forever 
occupied with dreams and visions of taking off, of moving to the city, a
 lot of Springsteen’s early music is made specifically for people like 
me. Born To Run sounded like it lead to another world, not just because 
it was so intricate, so intent upon crafting escape through imbuing 
music with legend so thoroughly, but also because its own visions of 
escape felt like they belonged so thoroughly to a bygone time. They were
 unretrievable; if anybody ever really got in their car and just drove 
away to a new start, they didn’t do it now. Of course, most of the 
people in his songs never quite make it out of that town they start out 
in, anyway. The bar scenes of “Glory Days” or the father-son cycle of 
“My Hometown” might fly in the face of this notion, but in recent years 
I’ve begun to think of Born In The U.S.A. as the Bruce album for those 
of us who came from such places, actually did make it to the destination
 at the other end, and didn’t know exactly what was supposed to have 
changed once we got there.<br>
<br>
Springsteen has two albums that begin with the word “born”: Born To Run 
and Born In The U.S.A. People will argue about where these fall in the 
canon (in my mind, there’s no way both of them aren’t in the top 3), but
 there’s no getting around that these are his most iconic albums. The 
first was the last gasp of his romantic period, as operatic and 
grandiose as he’d ever let himself be ever again. Born To Run is the one
 that minted him as a star, Born In The U.S.A. of course the one that 
took it much further. They feel like bookends, his first two albums a 
prologue to Born To Run’s Point A, the subsequent three albums the 
middle chapters on the way to Born In The U.S.A.’s Point B. With those 
seven albums, you get the whole arc of Springsteen’s first story. 
There’s a reason he followed Born In The U.S.A. with Tunnel Of Love, a 
departure stylistically and conceptually, and there’s a reason he never 
quite got his muse back after that until he had post-9/11 America to 
grapple with. Those first seven albums should rank as one of the Great 
American Novels. They flit between grand dreams of escapism and classic 
Americana iconography and far more grim, sparse portraits of real, 
non-archetypal characters struggling in a spiritual and economic 
wasteland in a post-Vietnam America. Born In The U.S.A. holds all that 
within it, and seeks some sort of resolution, offers some hope. It’s the
 one you carry with you on the other end of trip.<br>
<br>
One would imagine it’s no coincidence — and if it is, it’s still 
illustrative — that the word “run” also appears in the lyrics to “Born 
In The U.S.A.” In “Born To Run,” the famous line had been “Tramps like 
us, baby we were born to run.” It was a desperate, last-bet kind of 
romanticism that ran through Born To Run, but it was still one final 
shot at throwing your arms around the highway and all the promises you 
wish you still totally believed it offered. On Born In The U.S.A., any 
sense of romanticism comes in yearning and nostalgia, simple pop forms 
rather than intricately crafted catharses. When he sings of running in 
“Born In The U.S.A.,” there’s no more glimpse of pulling out of town — 
it’s “Nowhere to run, ain’t got nowhere to go.” It’s the lack of 
options, the lack of a perceived future, that drives this song’s 
protagonist to Vietnam; it’s his return from Vietnam that presents him 
with a heightened sense of that same lack. It’s preceded by the line 
“Ten years burning down the road.” Born In The U.S.A. came out just shy 
of ten years after Born To Run. This is the album where Born To Run 
ends, finally, all that came in between steps along that journey. While 
“Born In The U.S.A.” may start it off despairingly, by “My Hometown” 
we’re making peace with where we came from and who we are. There’s an 
arc to this album specifically that puts to rest so many of the issues 
of the preceding six albums.<br>
<br>
Despite all I’ve said here about the circumstances of this album and how
 it’s been perceived, lately Born In The U.S.A. has transcended context 
for me. When I leave my apartment in New York on a rainy day, it seems 
like the right album to put on. When I visit home, in Pennsylvania, and 
I’m driving under grey skies on a five degree day in January, it seems 
like the right album to put on. When I’m walking home late at night on a
 balmy summer night, there’s no way that I’m not putting on “Dancing In 
The Dark” before I’m done. Usually, when a piece of art becomes 
voluminous or malleable enough to mean everything, it winds up not 
meaning much at all. Born In The U.S.A. is an exception, a record whose 
myth just feels more massive and inviting even now. Or, maybe, that’s 
just what this kind of pop music is supposed to be: a different version 
of everything to anybody who listens to it.<br>
<br>
Even when you live in a place like New York, that urge can develop, that
 unquenchable recurring American thing of wanting to escape where you 
are. No matter where it is, the answers are elsewhere. Of course, that’s
 the kind of thinking Springsteen already tried, and he knew it didn’t 
hold up. But he still wanted to believe it, even on Born In The U.S.A., 
where he’s pretty much deconstructing the notion. It’s in our DNA, that 
desire — something about the expanse of America, the big abstract 
promises of this country, instills a hunger. There’s always that 
possibility to blow everything up and start again in a new town. And in 
the 21st century, that’s only gotten stronger, even if it seems like a 
particularly American Century notion that should be outmoded. We might 
be savvy enough to know that our existence won’t look like the dreams 
earlier Springsteen songs sketched out, the dreams so many of his later 
protagonists suffered having lost. But the flipside of that savviness, 
I’d argue, is that we also live with a perpetual sense of “Is that all?”
 We have, in a sense, everything at our fingertips, but it’s never 
enough. It begins to feel like nothing.<br>
<br>
So every now and then, it helps to put on Born In The U.S.A., because of
 that fact that it’s the one that represents the end of the road of all 
he’d written up until that point: a mature reckoning with all the 
mythology he’d been raised on, a grounding of it in the daily realities 
of people’s lives, and a glimmer of wistfulness and belief that it’s 
still possible to grasp at it all. There are days recently where I find 
it to be the most rewarding, most essential, most immortal Bruce 
Springsteen record. Anytime I put it on, for 47 minutes there’s that 
intangible sense rising again — not the hunger, but the response to it. 
The point where you had the belief, lost it for a time, and are old 
enough to come back around to it tentatively, just taking little doses 
of it amongst your daily, physical realities. It might ring out in 
desperation sometimes, but thirty years on it feels more like a tinge of
 something new, and a promise to carry on: “There’s something happening 
somewhere.” Sometimes, I just know that there is.</div>
