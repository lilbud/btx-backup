The Atlanta Journal Constitution<br>
Feb 15, 2016<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
“Are you ready to be entertained?”<br>
<br>
It wasn’t so much a question as it was a proclamation coming from Bruce 
Springsteen – and he was so emphatic that he repeated the rhetorical 
query three times at the start of his triumphant three-hour-plus 
mega-show at Philips Arena Thursday night.<br>
<br>
It hasn’t been quite two years since Springsteen played Atlanta, but 
that last appearance was at Lakewood Amphitheatre and, just like Jimmy 
Buffett doesn’t belong in an arena, Springsteen feels right inside its 
confines, where the sweat and lights and crowd noise congeal in a 
musical explosion.<br>
<br>
This tour, of course, is to celebrate the anniversary of Springsteen’s 
seminal 1980 album, “The River,” and the box set, “The Ties That Bind: 
The River Collection,” that arrived in its honor in December.<br>
<br>
After launching the concert with “Meet Me in the City,” a frisky 
leftover included in the anniversary set, Springsteen and his treasured E
 Street Band alternately barreled and tiptoed through the 20 songs on 
“The River,” in running order, for two hours and 10 minutes.<br>
<br>
“ ‘The River’ was a coming of age record. They are songs about a small 
community in the streets of Asbury Park,” Springsteen said, adding that 
the cornerstones of the album are work, community and family.<br>
<br>
Sauntering the length of the stage during “Sherry Darling,” guitar slung
 low across his back, Springsteen worked every curve of the arena, 
making sure not to neglect those behind the open-backed stage.<br>
<br>
The E Street Band – Nils Lofgren and Steven Van Zandt on guitars, Roy 
Bittan on piano, Garry Tallent on bass, Max Weinberg on drums, Patti 
Scialfa on acoustic guitar and tambourine, Soozie Tyrell on violin and 
acoustic guitar, Charles Giordano on organ and accordion and Jake 
Clemons on saxophone – were, as always, pinpoint perfect.<br>
<br>
And really, only in Springsteen’s world would a nine-piece band be considered a “pared-down” version.<br>
<br>
Weinberg rat-a-tat-tatted on his snare like the world’s best marching 
band drummer, while Clemons earned a mighty cheer every time he stepped 
forward for a solo, not into Uncle Clarence’s looming shadow, but into 
his own spotlight.<br>
<br>
There is no doubt that the Springsteen flock is a loyal one, and for 
most in the sold-out venue, hearing “The River” live in its entirety was
 its own religion.<br>
<br>
But as muscular and poignant and meaningful as those songs are on record
 – who would argue the emotional tug-of-war in “Independence Day” or the
 smile-inducing melody that propels “Hungry Heart”? – having to adhere 
to their running order created some awkward pacing.<br>

The seamless blitz of “Out in the Street,” “Crush on You” and “You Can 
Look (But You Better Not Touch)” ignited the crowd. But even Springsteen
 would probably admit that “I Wanna Marry You” (during which he 
endearingly chuckled at himself after badly missing a high note), the 
evocative title track and “Point Blank” inserts a tad too much 
introspection into one chunk of a show.<br>
<br>
He effortlessly snapped the crowd into a newly adrenalized state on the 
exuberant “I’m a Rocker” and with the grimy guitar riffs of “Ramrod,” 
and as much as Springsteen respects his landmark creation, telling the 
crowd after the haunting closer “Wreck on the Highway” that the album 
was about time and mortality, he visibly perked up and hollered, “Then 
all right, let’s go!” when it was time to start the second set of random
 favorites.<br>
<br>
From the purposeful march of “Badlands” – accompanied by much 
fist-punching the air – to the simply lovely combination of rustic 
violin and creamy synthesizers of “Lonesome Day” to the frantically 
escalating “Wrecking Ball” (complete with a hearty cheer from many in 
the crowd at references to the Meadowlands and the New York Giants) – 
Springsteen and the band were firmly in the pocket.<br>
<br>
At 66, he somehow manages to make everything still look effortless, 
whether putting his full trust in his devotees to safely pass his body 
over the crowd or strolling around the arena floor to greet 
well-wishers.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s growl of a voice sounded robust throughout the show, and 
he was perfectly content to occasionally cede the spotlight – as he did 
to the phenomenal Lofgren, who attacked his fretboard and spun like a 
wind-up toy during his “Because the Night” solo – and share it, most 
notably with his wife, Scialfa, on the confessional “<br>
<br>
Few artists utilize the house lights as adroitly as Springsteen 
(“Elevation” tour-era U2 is a close second), and they were frequently 
lifted during the concert to create that electrifying atmosphere that 
comes from a shared live music experience.<br>
<br>
Before blasting into his signature singalong, “Born to Run,” Springsteen
 paused for a moment to recognize the late, great Alex Cooley, the 
legendary Atlanta concert promoter who died in December and was an 
integral part of Springsteen’s early career, and dedicated the anthem to
 him.<br>
<br>
By this so-called encore (Springsteen and Co. don’t even bother leaving 
the stage – because why waste time when you can play another song?), 
fans were primed to hip-shake and shout through “Dancing in the Dark” 
and the epic “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight).”<br>
<br>
Springsteen still had some sweat to shake off, and whenever he looked 
into the crowd, a smile spread across his face, indicating that he’s 
truly enjoying this latest run – for however much longer it lasts.</div>

The London Times<br>
February 12, 2016<br>
<br>
By Erin McCafferty<br>
</strong><br>
Irish fans working on the dream of seeing Bruce Springsteen play live in
 Croke Park this year have been quick to snap up tickets to his two 
summer concerts.<br>
<br>
A total of 82,000 tickets available for the initial gig were gone within
 half an hour of going on sale yesterday at 9am. A second date was then 
announced and it too sold out, leaving some fans disappointed.<br>
The River Tour 2016, in which Springsteen plays his 1980 double album in
 its entirety, has already proved a hit in the US and Canada.<br>
<br>
Catriona O’Malley, 22, a English and History graduate from Maynooth, was
 one of the lucky ones. She waited in line outside Eason in Maynooth 
yesterday morning and secured a ticket within three quarters of an hour.<br>
“I wanted to get a standing ticket for the Friday concert, but they were
 sold out,” she said. “I got a seating ticket for Sunday, in the lower 
tier of the Hogan stand at Croke Park instead. I felt pretty happy about
 it — I’m a big fan.”<br>
Margaret Leonard, 46, an Amnesty International worker from Tullyallen, 
near Drogheda, said she was Springsteen’s No 1 fan and was determined to
 get a ticket online.<br>
<br>
“The countdown began the night before when I logged into my account,” 
she said. “I was up and at the computer at 9am the next morning and the 
tension was palpable — it was a case of ticking all the boxes and 
watching the status change from ‘Not on Sale’ to ‘On Sale’ and then 
‘Processing’. I was aware of the virtual queue and afraid to touch 
anything on the computer until finally the sale was confirmed — the 
second time round.<br>
<br>
“I’m looking forward to catching up with friends from all over the world
 and enjoying this thing we have in common,” she said. “The butterflies 
are terrible though. I have been having nightmares where I lose my 
tickets and I can’t find the venue.”<br>
<br>
Prices for both gigs started at €65.45 for seats, €98.50 for standing 
and up to €131 for other areas of the concert venue, in addition to a 
charge for booking.<br>
<br>
A spokesman for Aiken Promotions said yesterday there were no plans to add another Irish date to the tour.<br>
Nick McDonnell, 31, a youth worker from Kells, Co Meath, was one of those who missed out.<br>
“I was online on my laptop and also trying through the mobile app at 9am
 this morning,” he said yesterday. “The app didn’t work and I had a wait
 of 32 minutes online. My attempt eventually timed out and I got the ‘No
 tickets are available’ message.”<br>
Leaving for work, he arrived to find that another date had been added. 
“But the tickets were all gone for that too,” he said. “On the way there
 I’d passed a Ticketmaster store in Navan and the queue was at least 50 
plus, stretching past a few of the local shops.”<br>
<br>
Another disappointed fan was Niamh O’Brien, a 33-year-old marketing 
executive from Galway. She has seen Springsteen live on four occasions 
already and tried to get tickets online for two hours before giving up.<br>
“At first, it seemed to be working, and I was delighted when two tickets
 for the lower Cusack stand came up,” she said. “However, after going 
through the whole thing of booking and paying, I got a message saying, 
‘Sorry — we’re unable to process your request’, and they just 
disappeared from my basket.”<br>
Her second and subsequent attempts also failed.<br>
<br>
“Buying concert tickets in Ireland is an absolute nightmare,” she added.
 “Not only do music fans here have to pay through the nose for tickets, 
we have to jump through virtual hoops to get them too.”<br>

A look back in fear and anger<br>
The London Times<br>
July 25, 2014</strong><br>
<br>
The tale of Bruce Springsteen’s ‘lost album’ The Promise is full of 
heartache and legal drama. There is lovely pop here, but it’s not the 
pop of its time<br>
<br>
"Remember,” says Bruce Springsteen to a bandmate, “there’s always room 
to throw out.” The black-and-white footage shows an astonishingly 
beautiful young Springsteen in the studio. He is slowly driving his 
fellow musicians crazy with his capacity to write new songs, record them
 and then toss them away. The album to be born in June 1978 is Darkness 
on the Edge of Town, and its gestation appears to be a process of 
elimination as much as of creation.<br>
<br>
Even when it comes to the songs he plans to keep, Springsteen — whose 
three previous albums had swelled with lyrical and musical excess — is 
intent on stripping them down. “Roy, you playin’ any fills?” he asks his
 piano player Roy Bittan. “If so, they’re out.” The tone is mock-Bossy, 
with a hint of mincing, but he’s clearly serious.<br>
<br>
These moments appear in Thom Zimny’s recent documentary, The Promise: 
The Making of Darkness on the Edge of Town, which — along with other 
home-movie clips and live footage — fills no fewer than three DVDs in an
 extraordinary (and pricy) new box set with an annoyingly similar name.<br>
<br>
For many fans, this set evokes a lyric from Darkness: “. . . if dreams 
came true, oh, wouldn’t that be nice”. The album holds a special place 
in our hearts; without the hype of Born to Run, the mega-popularity of 
Born in the USA or the scattergun eclecticism of The River, Darkness is 
the pure stuff, unadulterated Springsteen at his creative peak. In my 
own New Jersey adolescence, it was the first record, by anyone, that I 
fully inhabited, and I’ve heard of a fair few Irish adolescences in 
which it played a similar role.<br>
<br>
As Springsteen describes it in the recent interview that anchors Zimny’s
 film, Darkness was a “tone poem” of “power, directness and austerity”. 
The documentary relates Springsteen’s obsessive pursuit of a relentless 
drum sound. “Stick!” he would scream, annoyed at hearing the drumstick 
rather than the primal crack-boom of Max Weinberg’s drums. Many songs on
 the album are so austere that the “melody” consists of little more than
 whatever note Garry Tallent’s bass intones whenever the bass drum 
sounds.<br>
<br>
With all that stripping clean and throwing away, what was left out? And 
why was Springsteen only just getting into the studio nearly two years 
after being the magazine-cover face of record-industry hype with the 
release of Born to Run in 1975? The answers to these questions go to the
 heart, not only of this autumn’s “new” release, but also of the special
 place Springsteen holds in the history of the business — as opposed to 
the art — of rock’n’roll.<br>
<br>
For most of the gap between Born to Run and Darkness, Springsteen was 
hamstrung by a lawsuit with his former manager that kept him out of the 
studio. Although it was settled quicker than, say, Muhammad Ali’s ban 
from boxing eight years earlier, it has taken on some of the same weight
 for fans. We revel in his defiance of “the Man” — but we still wonder 
what might have been, if he hadn’t been kept out of the ring in his 
late-twenties prime.<br>
<br>
The Promise, tantalisingly, purports to give an answer, in the form of a
 double CD of 21 songs — Springsteen’s “lost album”, the one he says 
“could have/should have been released” in those gap years. (Just to 
cement the confusion, this album is also called The Promise, with a 
different ­mouthful of a ­subtitle.)<br>
<br>
Springsteen is hardly the only big old star to root through the archives
 or rejects for Christmas stocking-fillers. Yet he and his PR machine 
are uniquely playing “back to the future”, magically trying to recreate 
the “missing” Springsteen album. The vaults were full of unfinished 
works, so on this album about half the songs are substantially revised, 
with vocals, instruments and even lyrics that weren’t there at the time.
 In the liner notes, he writes absurdly: “I did what I would’ve done to 
them at the time and no more.” Not even “what I think I would’ve done”. 
No, the 61-year-old Bruce knows the 27-year-old Bruce so well he can 
reproduce exactly what his younger self “would’ve done”.<br>
<br>
Tampering aside, the claim that is this is the “lost album” is 
demolished when we recall a handful of the best outtakes from this 
period appeared in 1998 on the four-CD album Tracks and are not repeated
 here.<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, the two discs of The Promise comprise a good old/new 
Springsteen album. From the opening piano and ­harmonica of Racing in 
the Street (78) — like the version on Darkness itself but in a less 
monotonic voice and fatalistic key — to the moving lament of the title 
track, it often seems a more deliberate successor, or response, to Born 
to Run than ­Darkness itself does.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Review: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band at the KFC Yum Centre<br>
LEXINGTON HERALD<br>
BY WALTER TUNIS<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
At about the halfway point of a three hour-plus marathon concert Sunday 
night at the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville, Bruce Springsteen stated the
 obvious. At age 66, he was grinning, wailing and leaping in place on a 
platform that took him deep into the arena floor crowd. The exhibition, 
perhaps typical of Springsteen’s tireless performance stance, was a 
blast of pure rock ‘n’ roll exaltation. The tune fanning the performance
 flames: I’m a Rocker.<br>
<br>
Never mind that everything that came before this moment would have 
likely winded artists one-third his age. Springsteen was on a mission. 
The impetus for his current tour is to resurrect, in its entirety, the 
masterful 1980 double album The River, a record he introduced early into
 the program as a “coming of age” work. But as the often volcanic 
performance underscored, The River encapsulated everything that makes 
Springsteen a rock pioneer of such epic stature.<br>
<br>
The album’s 20 songs, played in sequence, rode a trail of complex and 
severe disparity. Some of the tunes are among Springsteen’s most 
outwardly loose and joyous creations, including the frat rock anthem 
Sherry Darling, the piledriving party ode You Can Look (But You Better 
Not Touch) and the wildly elative Out in the Street, arguably the 
happiest composition in The Boss’ canon. All were delivered with a drive
 and abandon by Springsteen’s long-running E Street Band (whittled down 
to 10 members last night from the orchestra-sized troupes convened on 
previous tours) that sounded earnestly youthful.<br>
<br>
But The River is also an album of dreams broken and unrealized, veering 
eventually into views of mortality. Several of those songs have been 
absent from Springsteen’s concerts for decades, including the plaintive 
Independence Day and it’s quiet portrayal of a troubled father-son 
relationship, and the album’s disquieting finale, Wreck on the Highway, 
which prizes love mightily after a glimpse of death. Both were 
unassumingly dramatic highpoints of the concert.<br>
<br>
Together with the show opening Meet Me in the City (an outtake featured 
on The Ties That Bind, the recent box set chronicling the album’s 
recording sessions and subsequent tour), The River’s contrasts were 
regularly underscored during the performance. No sooner did the 
unsettling, neo-tango rhythm of Point Black fade than the full E Street 
alliance erupted with the celebratory Cadillac Ranch. Similarly, the 
calliope boardwalk bliss of I Wanna Marry You (introduced as a song of 
“love in all its imagined glory”) faded into the title tune from The 
River, a tale of lost innocence and its stark, sobering aftermath.<br>
<br>
Taken as a whole, it was a remarkable performance piece colored by the E
 Streeters’ inexhaustible drive and invention as well as Springsteen’s 
own performance daring. The latter even included a bit of body surfing 
during Hungry Heart, not recommended for your everyday rock ‘n’ roll 
elder.<br>
<br>
But the performance roared on for over an hour without an intermission 
after The River suite concluded with a freight train of favorites (a 
suitably anthemic Badlands and a Bo Diddley-friendly She’s the One), 
comparatively newer pieces (Lonesome Day and The Rising, both delivered 
as crisp affirmations) and a still-venomous Born in the U.S.A. as an 
encore, complete with drummer Max Weinberg’s implosive coda. The latter 
nicely enforced the fact that raging waters within Springsteen’s most 
potent tunes extend far beyond the River-bank.</div>

 Jeffrey Lee Puckett,  <br>
February 22, 2016<br>
</strong><br>
Springsteen and The E Street Band are performing the 1980 album in its 
entirety on this tour, and when introducing it Sunday night at the KFC 
Yum! Center, Springsteen talked about his intent when writing the album.
 He had been making what he called "outsider records" and wanted to 
write one that explored what it meant to be an insider, to make 
meaningful connections.<br>
<br>
He also, and this was an impossible task, wanted to make a record as big
 as life, one that contained fun, dancing, laughter, sex, comradeship, 
love, faith, lonely nights and teardrops.<br>
<br>
"I figured if I could make a record that contained all of those things, 
I'd get a little bit closer to realizing them in my own life," he said.<br>
<br>
He said this surrounded by his wife of 25 years, Patti Scialfa, and 
friends that go back as far as 1971: Garry Tallent, Steve Van Zandt, Roy
 Bittan, Max Weinberg. In other words, all of the things that he was 
looking for when writing "The River" are now his in abundance. The tour 
itself answers all of the questions he had as a 29-year-old.<br>
<br>
Springsteen already had some of what he was looking for in 1980, but 
it's sometimes hard to see what's right in front of you, or maybe you 
can see it but not quite get your hands around it. That happens a lot to
 the characters who populate "The River," and Springsteen brought them 
to riveting life Sunday night with a set that balanced unhinged joy with
 a few of those teardrops.<br>
<br>
Playing "The River" in its entirety is a bold move. Like nearly all 
double albums it has awkward moments, and there are stretches that work 
better in the quiet of a darkened living room than on stage, but 
Springsteen and the E Street Band are bold performers, capable of 
willing a show into extraordinary existence. For the most part, they did
 just that.<br>
<br>
The opening salvo of "The Ties That Bind," "Sherry Darling," Jackson 
Cage," Two Hearts," "Independence Day," "Hungry Heart" and "Out in the 
Street" was sheer perfection - 25 minutes that encapsulated most of the 
album's primary themes.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and the band, which also includes Nils Lofgren, Soozie 
Tyrell, Jake Clemons and Charles Giordano, were dead solid and lighter 
than air. They captured the joy that makes "Sherry Darling" and "Out in 
the Street" vital, and the tight-lipped desperation crucial to "Jackson 
Cage" and "The Ties That Bind." Most impressive, however, may have been 
the fine line between those extremes central to "Two Hearts"; they 
nailed it perfectly.<br>
<br>
Some of the throwaway rockers on "The River" are still throwaways, but 
they did what they were meant to do: provide a respite from the album's 
harsher realities. Still, the album's middle section has always had its 
problems, mostly with uneven pacing. That surfaced Sunday night, 
although it wasn't a dealbreaker unless you were a drunk 25-year-old 
with the attention span of a gnat  -  looking at you section 116, row D,
 seats 12 and 13.<br>
<br>
The only real surprises during "The River" were how "Point Blank" felt 
oddly neutered compared to its usual, and intended, claustrophobia, and 
how a long, slow build-up to "I Wanna Marry You" elevated a good song to
 an outright great one. The set ended on a note of hopeful sadness with 
"Wreck on the Highway," followed by a brief statement and then a 
cheerful, "That's 'The River'!"<br>
<br>
And then there was an entirely different concert. The second act.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and band tore through "Badlands," "Lonesome Day," "Because 
the Night," "She's the One," "Human Touch," "The Rising," "Thunder 
Road," "Born in the U.S.A.," "Born to Run," "Dancing in the Dark," 
"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)," The Isley Brothers' "Shout" and "Bobby 
Jean."<br>
<br>
"Rosalita," a nightly highlight on the original "The River" tour, lived 
up to its legend. It was a celebration of everything grand about rock 
'n' roll: young love, young lust, hostile parents and an open door that 
leads to the open road. Salvation waits at the end of it, of course, 
because that's what rock 'n' roll promises the young.<br>
<br>
But even people forced to deal in real life with the emotional traumas 
littered throughout "The River" can still believe in the open road, if 
only for a few minutes, especially when Springsteen's behind the wheel 
and Miami Steve is riding shotgun, bandana whipping in the breeze while 
the E Street Band plays like a jungle fire.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen review – a full immersion in The River<br>
THE GUARDIAN<br>
Mark Guarino in Chicago<br>
Wednesday January  20 2016 </strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band take a full two hours to lead a 
Chicago audience through The River, the double album they released in 
1980 and are commemorating on this anniversary tour, which started last 
weekend and continues through March.<br>
<br>
The effort itself is a feat: containing a Top 10 single (Hungry Heart) 
and the title song that has endured as one of his signatures, The River 
is a true testament to album-oriented listening, especially for an album
 that contains a whopping 20 songs. Detailing a coming of age, The River
 touches on themes that Springsteen had written about before and has 
done since. But what makes the album unique is that it takes its time to
 explore the highs and lows of growing pains, as adolescence wrestles 
its way into adulthood.<br>
<br>
The themes, Springsteen said on stage, included fidelity and family. “I 
wanted to imagine and write about those things. I figured if I wrote 
about them, then I’d get a step closer to getting them in my life.”<br>
<br>
For a stadium act to luxuriate on all these different moods and tempos 
and topics could be seen in the Spotify era as downright archaic. With 
fewer new artists approaching their music to make grand gestures in 
favour of making records involving a battalion of songwriters and 
producers and intended to push the live brand, the River tour is a 
testament to an era when artists felt emboldened to go deep, pushing 
their audience beyond the scope of the three-minute single. Enabling 
these efforts were audiences who were less distracted and mobile in 
their listening compared to today, which gave albums like The River 
patient ears more willing to sit awhile and soak in all of the nuances.<br>

At the United Center, Springsteen notes that he was a much different 
person when he wrote The River. In his introduction of I Wanna Marry 
You, he describes its earnest pledge of fidelity as “a song of youth – 
love in all its glory and all of its early tentativeness before reality 
sets in … not real but I had to start someplace.”<br>
<br>
This is not necessarily a rose-tinted retrospective. There are throwaway
 songs on The River that still sound hard to justify bringing back to 
life. A recent boxed set reveals songs that didn’t make the cut but 
maybe should have earned the places taken by raucous bar rockers like 
Ramrod. And with its name-checks of Burt Reynolds and his black Trans 
Am, Cadillac Ranch may have exceeded its sell-by date. Nevertheless, the
 E Street Band still prove formidable, able to break even its weakest 
material down to a rowdy good time.<br>
<br>
The greatest revelation of the revisiting of this album is that, at its 
core, The River sees the band do something rare: get quiet. With the 
songs played in order, the album begins slowly to stretch out and soon, 
the slower songs begin to edge out the quick and fast. These songs – 
Point Blank, Fade Away, Stolen Car – grow into cinematic set pieces and 
since they are not often featured on the band’s setlist, there is a 
sense the band was energized, skillfully filtering all their strengths 
for big gestures into smaller pockets. This is especially true for The 
Price You Pay, the sweet spot of the night, which sounds most unlike 
other Springsteen songs. Four other voices harmonize with Springsteen 
for most of the vocals, which become lush and haunting.<br>
<br>
<br>
Clocking in at three hours and 20 minutes, the show is the usual 
marathon length for Springsteen and, at 66, he may have been sweating 
but didn’t show it. Sure, his sprints through the audience now are 
leisurely strolls. Hungry Heart turns into the equivalent of a meet and 
greet as he clowns with audience members and then, without prompting, 
turns his back and falls backwards, allowing himself to be crowd surfed 
back to the foot of the stage.<br>
<br>
Despite the deaths of core members keyboardist Danny Federici and 
saxophonist Clarence Clemons, the E Street Band still plays like they 
met up last week. This band doesn’t know slick, exemplified on Crush on 
You, which sounds fresh out of the garage. Guitarist Steven Van Zandt is
 the comic foil as he and Springsteen improvise lyrics, exchanged at a 
single microphone. Following Two Hearts, they attached a coda: It Takes 
Two, the 1965 Motown hit for Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston. On 
Springsteen’s other side is guitarist Nils Lofgren who plays with a 
sense of harmonics that gives songs bounce and color. But his spotlight 
comes when Springsteen hands Cover Me over to him and he plays a rousing
 solo heavy with distortion, but never noise.<br>
<br>
Once The River is complete, the band continue for 80 minutes, performing
 12 songs, including Take it Easy, a tribute to Glenn Frey, the Eagles 
co-founder who died on Monday. Springsteen sang the song while 
accompanying himself with an acoustic guitar, with fiddler Soozie 
Tyrell. With so much death in the headlines since the beginning of the 
year, especially involving musical icons, here is a night that doesn’t 
forget life comes first.</div>

NEW YORK TIMES<br>
By JON PARELES<br>
JAN. 28, 2016</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
“The subtext to ‘The River’ was time,” Bruce Springsteen said as the E 
Street Band played a slow, shimmering vamp. “Time slipping away. And 
once you enter that adult world, the clock starts ticking and you’ve got
 a limited amount of time to do your work, to raise your family, to try 
and do something good.”<br>
<br>
That was Mr. Springsteen’s postscript to the opening two-hour stretch of
 his concert at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night: a complete 
performance of his 1980 double album, “The River,” prefaced by “Meet Me 
in the City,” one of the many outtakes from the album issued last year 
in the boxed set “The Ties That Bind: The River Collection.” He’s 
performing the whole album throughout his current tour.<br>
<br>
Time means even more now, 36 years after “The River” was released. The 
time Mr. Springsteen spent onstage: an intermissionless three hours as 
he followed “The River” with one can-you-top-this song after another. 
The time that Mr. Springsteen has led the E Street Band, which got its 
start in 1972, still includes its original bass player (Garry Tallent) 
and has now gone through generational changes, with Jake Clemons taking 
over on saxophone after the death of his uncle Clarence Clemons in 2011.
 (At the end of the show, Mr. Springsteen invariably praises the band 
with a carnival-barker string of adjectives that now includes 
“death-defying.”) The time that Mr. Springsteen’s loyal fans have had to
 absorb his albums, revisiting their joys and lessons as their own lives
 play out, perhaps marveling that Mr. Springsteen is still filling 
arenas.<br>
<br>
“The River” has held up. For Mr. Springsteen, “The River” was a pivotal 
album — the distillation of a lengthy recording process and long 
deliberation. Released when he was 31, the album opens, pointedly, with 
“The Ties That Bind.” As Mr. Springsteen explained onstage, “The River” 
strove to address the connections, responsibilities and compromises of 
adult life, from the fleeting pleasures of a night out dancing to the 
commitments of marriage and parenthood. The album also changed Mr. 
Springsteen’s approach to songwriting; it newly compressed and 
streamlined his storytelling style. And the album’s 20-song sequence 
carefully juxtaposed its ups and downs, with pensive ballads like “The 
River” itself and boisterous, cowbell-thumping rockers like “Crush on 
You.”<br>
<br>
On the album, and now live, each song responds to the one before it — 
sometimes by extension, sometimes by contrast — in a flux of resilience 
and resignation, impulses and consequences. The songs themselves hold 
dualities; “Cadillac Ranch,” the album’s most irresistibly twangy stomp 
and holler, praises cars yet contemplates death. Time is also folded 
into the music of “The River,” which was made in the 1970s with a 
history of rock and roots — the Byrds, Chuck Berry, Phil Spector, 
doo-wop, Bob Dylan, Otis Redding, the Rolling Stones, Roy Orbison, Woody
 Guthrie — threaded through its songs.<br>
<br>
Onstage, Mr. Springsteen was committed as always to connecting with the 
audience and the band, clowning with the guitarist Steve Van Zandt and 
sometimes sharing a single microphone with up to four band members, 
leaning in and out for call-and-response vocals. He often stepped onto a
 platform where people up front could reach his legs, and he walked onto
 and around the arena floor for handshakes, high-fives and selfies. 
During “Hungry Heart,” the hit single from “The River,” he not only led 
the joyful singalong but also fell back on upstretched arms to 
crowd-surf up to the stage.<br>
<br>
Mr. Springsteen spoke in depth about a few songs, introducing “I Wanna 
Marry You” as “a song of imagining love in all its excitement and its 
tentativeness,” then sharing an eerie, extended vocal introduction to 
the song, his voice overlapping with Mr. Van Zandt’s.<br>
<br>
“The River” ends in mourning and persistence, with “Wreck on the 
Highway,” a song narrated by an onlooker who wonders about the dead 
man’s girlfriend or family and those who will have to bring the bad 
news: time ended for the man in the wreck, time stretches ahead for 
those connected to him.<br>
<br>
But Mr. Springsteen wouldn’t leave a concert on that doleful note. 
Moments later, the band was barreling through a string of songs about 
lust, love and romance: the pealing arpeggios and Bo Diddley beat of 
“She’s the One”; the galloping momentum of “Candy’s Room”; the anthemic 
surge of “Because the Night” with a leaping, swooping guitar solo played
 by Nils Lofgren as he hopped and twirled on one foot; and the updated 
girl-group pop, with troubled thoughts, of “Brilliant Disguise,” which 
ended with Mr. Springsteen embracing his wife (and backup singer), Patti
 Scialfa.<br>
<br>
The concert’s only 21st-century songs were “Wrecking Ball” from 2009 — 
Mr. Springsteen’s funny, far-reaching personification of a soon-to-be 
demolished Giants Stadium — and “The Rising,” a post-Sept. 11 song that 
plays out as a ritual of redemption. Then came the final, full-throttle,
 standing-ovation, shout-along final sprint: “Thunder Road,” “Born to 
Run,” “Dancing in the Dark,” “Rosalita” and — signaling show’s end — 
“Shout.” They were, besides being unstoppable, songs that have what the 
succinct verse-chorus-verse songs of “The River” had set aside: 
elaborate structures, virtuoso instrumental passages, key changes. But 
they are also songs that have connected Mr. Springsteen and his fans 
through the decades, defying time once again.</div>

Cleveland.com<br>
February 23, 2016. (Lisa DeJong/The Plain Dealer)</strong><br>
 <br>
<br>
CLEVELAND, Ohio – Bruce Springsteen and the guys (and gal) in the E 
Street Band must mainline energy drinks. There's no other way they could
 maintain the level of enthusiasm that rocked Quicken Loans Arena for 
more than three hours Tuesday night.<br>
<br>
You gotta figure Joe Kearney and Paul Lamb got their money's worth. Of 
course, so did the other 19,000-plus who sold out The Q. But they didn't
 come from Belfast, Northern Ireland.<br>
<br>
That's right, Lamb laid out the euros for the airfare and tickets as a 
60th birthday gift for his Uncle Joe to see the Boss &amp; Co.<br>
<br>
Again.<br>
<br>
Kearney has seen Springsteen and his band seven or eight times, and his 
nephew 12 or 13, all in Ireland. The show in America gave them a bit of a
 different look.<br>
<br>
"We flew in from Belfast on Saturday and fly back Friday,'' Kearney said
 in the lilting Irish accent so different from the Hollywood brogue 
stereotype.<br>
<br>
Now to be fair, they made their first trip to Cleveland because 
Springsteen's New York City show at Madison Square Garden was sold out, 
but neither man was complaining.<br>
<br>
"It's been great,'' Kearney said, in a brogue so thick that it sounded 
like "grit.'' "Everyone's been so friendly and the food is really 
good.''<br>
<br>
So are the bars, said the two, who admitted sampling a Cleveland version
 of a pub or two during their stay. Hey, some stereotypes have their 
basis in fact.<br>
<br>
For the Irish kinsmen, a Springsteen show is old hat, even if it was in a
 different setting. For 8-year-old Willow Aubry, it was a first. The 
Falls-Lenox second grader was at The Q with mom and dad, Tom and Terri.<br>
<br>
Shy and sweet, with blue eyes the color of a Caribbean sea, she 
nonetheless knew her Boss. Maybe that's because her Canadian-born dad 
has seen Springsteen as many as 15 times, and plays the albums all the 
time. How else would a sprite like that – clutching her first-ever 
concert T-shirt – say that her favorite Bruce song was a somewhat 
obscure recording of "The Erie Canal'' and explain to her classmates 
just WHO she was going to see Tuesday night?<br>
<br>
She might want to hold onto that T-shirt for posterity, too. With prices
 that ranged from $40 for a regular T-shirt to $65 for a hoodie and even
 $15 for a simple coffee cup, it can only go up in value.<br>
<br>
Because of deadlines, I wasn't able to see the entire show, much to my 
chagrin, even if Springsteen did have a bit of a mind-slip, referring to
 Cleveland as Pittsburgh before catching his error.<br>
<br>
Anyone else, that would've been justification for the Spanish 
Inquisition. Not Springsteen. He has owned this city since his first 
show here in 1974, and if Tuesday's show is any indicator, there's not a
 chance in the world of him losing the deed.<br>
<br>
The tour celebrates the 1980 release of his first "grown-up'' album, 
"The River,'' with tunes like the rollicking "Sherry Darling'' and 
"Hungry Heart'' (you haven't lived till you've seen a 66-year-old 
Springsteen crowd-surfing the pit during the latter song) and the 
wrenching "Independence Day.''<br>
<br>
The last, written about a conversation with his father, was one of the 
first works in Springsteen's vast, poetic catalog that examines 
mortality and reality. While it's a realization that parents didn't come
 into the world devoid of dreams, it also is a desperate vow that we 
won't be like them, even knowing that vow is an exercise in futility.<br>
<br>
And that's the beauty of Springsteen's work. Yeah, he can rock all night
 long, belting that trademark rasp, accompanied by Little Steven Van 
Zandt, Nils Lofgren, Soozie Tyrell, Max Weinberg, Roy Bittan, Gary 
Tallent and an almost frighteningly good Jake Clemons, nephew of the 
late Clarence Clemons.<br>
<br>
But in the end, he's a mashup of Faulkner, Shakespeare and Freud with a Telecaster.</div>

The Ties That Bind: A review of Bruce Springsteen’s “The River” tour<br>
FEB 23, 2016<br>
<br>
BY SCOTT RECKER</strong><br>
<br>
Right before he launched into “The Ties That Bind,” the opening track 
off of “The River,” which he played in its entirety on Sunday night at 
the Yum! Center, Bruce Springsteen referred to the 1980 classic as his 
“coming-to-age record.” I never noticed that shift catalyzed by “The 
River” — a focal pivot of how he viewed the world in a way that can only
 be created by age — but it makes perfect sense: The records he made in 
the ’70s were about living on the outskirts of a normal, mundane, 
beaten-down daily grind and this was the start of a series that aimed to
 understand it — how people ended up that way, and the toll it takes on 
them. I could always hear it in “Nebraska,” my favorite Springteen 
record, the stripped-down, dark and straight-forward record released two
 years after “The River” that is particularly blunt with its characters 
and their hard-luck developments. But, “The River” was a record that I 
seemingly always overlooked — one that I would listen to every year or 
so in its entirety, never really revisiting songs individually and then 
put it back on the shelf, neither disappointed by it or newly addicted 
to it. It always fell right in the middle. Solid, but never in perpetual
 rotation. But, after Sunday night’s show, I’ve probably listened to it 
more times than I have in the last five years, and not just because I’m 
writing this review, but because I can’t get it out of my head. More 
times than I remember, I’ve been late to the game on an album. Some 
albums just don’t resonate with me on the first, second, third or 
fifteenth listen, and then, a week, month or a decade later, it just 
clicks. But, I’ve never had it happen during a concert, as it did with 
“The River.”<br>
<br>
There are obviously a few concerns about someone playing a record from 
35 years ago in its entirety. 1) How well does that artist still connect
 to every one of those songs? Sometimes you hear of musicians who feel 
distanced from a time and place to where they once were. Not that 
they’re embarrassed by the material or anything like that — although I 
have talked to people who won’t play some songs for that exact reason — 
but is there still enough raw emotion to carry something on in a way 
that doesn’t feel forced or just purely nostalgic? 2) How do the vocals 
translate to the stage three and a half decades later? 3) And, in this 
case, with “The River” being an extremely long double album, are there 
gaps in terms of quality that will lose the audience?<br>
<br>
I never doubted that Springsteen would put on a great show. The guy’s a 
performer’s performer to the bone, and one of the most talented 
songwriters who has ever lived, with a nine-piece band that captures an 
unhinged, “Exile On Main Street”-esque kind of intensity, pairing the 
heart of a bar band with the magic of the tightest studio albums. But, 
there are always questions with something like this, even with somebody 
that seems as legendarily  unsinkable as The Boss. And, in my mind, the 
answers to the ones that I had were: 1) It was obvious that he was still
 extremely connected to the songs off of “The River.” Before he played 
“Independence Day,” he delivered one of the few elongated interludes, 
saying it was about how, for a long time, he didn’t really understand 
why people compromised their dreams and became complacent, but, as he 
was writing that album, his perspective gained the depth to realize some
 of those people didn’t give up, but instead they were making 
sacrifices. They were courageous not cowards. It was just another form 
of being bold. And, all these years later, he still openly seems to 
connect with that on some level. Where some musicians create a sort of 
discography that tracks the landmarks of their own emotional landscape, 
Springsteen has spent a career in trying to figure out the sunken class.
 And, because in the time that he was writing “The River” his thought 
process took a hard turn, it seemed to create a particularly strong bond
 with him, one that is certainly still evident. 2) In terms of his 
voice, as anyone who has seen him live or can work YouTube knows, his 
gravel-y wail has aged remarkably well. Playing three-plus hours a show 
has probably more than kept him in shape to play a 1 hour 23 minute 
record that has a lot of big chorus’ and dense verses. At 66, his voice 
is still remarkably intact and fit to carry an extremely ambitious 
record like “The River” in its entirety. 3) There are very few albums in
 existence that are perfect all of the way through, and “The River” 
isn’t one of those — although I may be hard-pressed to find three double
 albums that are — so, yes, there were songs, especially when he got to 
the songs from the second disc, that slowed things down a bit. But 
Springsteen has the charisma and crowd control to remain captivating. 
The audience would sit and focus during ballads, but he could get people
 to bounce back up within seconds of one of the many big, lush rockers 
on that record. When he played the first disc, from “The Ties That Bind”
 to the title track, it was as good of a run as when, last year, Prince 
rhetorically asked the crowd if we wanted to hear nine hits in a row and
 then delivered. And, for someone who plays for more than three hours, 
he wastes very little time. A quick count in was the only thing that 
separated many of the songs from “The River,” and when he rarely stopped
 to talk, it provided interesting context. He kept the record moving — 
although there was plenty of time for the E Street Band to deliver their
 trademark solos — and the show was all the better for it. Veterans to 
the core, they made the record sound different and expansive live, 
without being wasteful. And, most importantly in terms of being able to 
execute the sort of big ideas that he has, even though it sounds cliché 
and something that might be lazy for a music journalist to write, he 
still seems happy to be there, delivering the songs night after night.<br>
<br>
A couple songs after my favorite track from the second disc, “Cadillac 
Ranch” — which I actually heard Warren Zevon cover before I found out it
 originated on “The River” — I left my seat to wander around, to do some
 people watching, and pop in and out of different sections to watch from
 the railing. Even in the soft spots of that second disc, people were 
attentive — dancing and mesmerized and sporadically screaming … although
 at a much different pitch than the one present at the Taylor Swift 
concert, which still causes sonic flashbacks. As “The River” came to a 
close and Bruce was preparing to run through a large chunk of hits and a
 few deeper cuts, I had to take off, which made me feel a little guilty 
when I woke up Monday morning, but I don’t anymore. Sure, I missed some 
of my favorite songs by Springsteen, but being drawn deeper into “The 
River” completely changed how I perceive that record, which seems like a
 victory, even if it was a delayed one.</div>

Rochester Democrat and Examiner<br>
Springsteen rocks Rochester, examines life on 'The River'<br>
 Jeff Spevak, <br>
February 28, 2016</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Buddy Holly, Hank Williams, Ike Turner, Big Mama Thornton, Bob Dylan, 
The Beatles, Johnny Cash, The Rolling Stones, David Bowie. We can argue 
all night about who built rock and roll.<br>
<br>
I don’t think Bruce Springsteen rises to that level of innovator.<br>
<br>
But I will say this: I don’t believe I’ve ever seen a performer move so 
comfortably within that framework, over such a long career, making such 
graceful adjustments as he grows older, than Springsteen. He is a 
craftsman of rock and roll, using all of the correct tools. And the 
evidence for that, presented Saturday night for a sold-out Blue Cross 
Arena by Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band, was overwhelming.<br>
<br>
The tour’s premise is a front-to-back presentation of The River, his 
1980 double album, to use the vintage terminology of those vinyl days. 
Followed by a set drawn from four decades of the 66-year-old 
Springsteen. Three hours and 11 minutes. Thirty-four songs. One concert,
 two different moods. Let’s start with the second half of the show.<br>
<br>
Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band had already been playing for 1½ 
hours, the last echoes of The River hadn’t left the building, and they 
still had enough energy to turn the dial up to 11. From “Night” to 
“Badlands,” it leaped to 15. “Badlands” has become almost the arena 
anthem rocker that is “Born to Run” and “Because the Night,” with 
guitarist Nils Lofgren’s spinning, stumbling, manic dancing solo. “The 
Rising” gave way to an a cappella opening – Springsteen and the entire 
audience – for “Thunder Road.” Throw in the exuberance of “Rosalita 
(Come Out Tonight),” with Springsteen singing a duet with a Muppet, 
tossed up from the audience, that guitarist Steven Van Zandt dangled in 
front off his face.<br>
<br>
There were also the now-familiar Springsteen tropes, including taking 
requests from signs held up by the crowd. He went with “I Wanna Be With 
You” and “I’m Goin’ Down,” then later scooped up a sign calling for 
“Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,” which brings out the video images of the two E
 Streeters who have passed away, Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici.<br>
<br>
And the signs held by women pleading for Springsteen to pick them as 
dance partners during “Dancing in the Dark.” An unusual number of men 
also displayed signs offering their wives to Springsteen. He opted for a
 65-year-old woman who not only danced with The Boss, but when he handed
 her an acoustic guitar she jammed away on it.<br>
<br>
“Do you have anything left, Rochester?” Springsteen demanded, and the 
answer was yes, so he responded with The Isley Brothers’ “Shout.” The 
house lights were on through most of this last hour, revealing a sea of 
pumping fists, the arena looking like a giant frat party.<br>
<br>
As the crowd streamed out of the arena, stepping over flattened beer 
cans, it’s too easy to say that the all-out rockers of the second half 
stole the show. But no, that was only the easy way to look at the 
evening.<br>
<br>
The River is an ambitious album, but from the opening “The Ties That 
Bind” it has the rocking accessibility of a bar band at work. This 
despite the fact that The E Street Band, nine members on this tour, is a
 complex machine.<br>
<br>
And that complexity is evident in The River: The Ties That Bind. 
Released on Dec. 4, it demonstrates the work that went into the album. 
The box set is four CDs of 54 songs, with outtakes, including “Meet Me 
in the City,” which opened Saturday’s show before the band proceeded to 
The River proper. Plus three DVDs that include a documentary and a 
concert, celebrating the 35th anniversary of The River. Springsteen 
wrote and rewrote that thing, discarding pieces as a novelist would with
 otherwise well-written chapters that didn’t fit the book.<br>
<br>
There are plenty of wild-at-heart rockers on The River. The exuberant 
“Sherry Darling,” with Springsteen bring in with shouts of “Make some 
party noises, Rochester!” Plus “Two Hearts,” “Cadillac Ranch” and 
“Ramrod,” equating young women to a hot-rod engine, an accurate-enough 
analogy for many 21-year-old guys. And Springsteen crowd surfing through
 the end of “Hungry Heart.”<br>
<br>
But those songs aren’t the true heart of the collection. “I wanted to 
make a big album that felt like life,” Springsteen told the audience. 
The River, he said, was his “coming of age” album.<br>
<br>
Life is sometimes a sadness. Springsteen explained how “Independence 
Day” is about a family's “dreams and hopes that maybe didn’t work out so
 perfectly,” and how they end up “working out compromises they had to 
make.” An extended Roy Bittan piano solo opening really escalated the 
drama of the epic, brilliantly desperate “Point Blank,” with Van Zandt’s
 ragged backing vocal shadowing Springsteen like a cautionary ghost.<br>
<br>
Then album-closing “Wreck on the Highway” and its sense of mortality. The final lines still take the breath away:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics"><br>
Sometimes I sit up in the darkness<br>
<br>
And watch my baby as she sleeps.<br>
<br>
Then I climb in bed and hold her tight<br>
<br>
I just lay there awake in the middle of the night<br>
<br>
Thinking about the wreck on the highway.</em><br>
<br>
“The River is about time,” Springsteen said as he brought the set to a 
close. “You realize you have a limited amount of time to do your work, 
raise your family, do something good.”<br>
<br>
The River is Springsteen’s rock opera of life.<br>
<br>
A sequential presentation of an album is not simply a gimmick. It is a 
real reminder of the beauty of musicians curating a collection of songs 
that play off each other. “Wreck on the Highway” works better with 
“Ramrod” still echoing in the head.<br>
<br>
The best of these songs are driven not by gasoline engines of “Ramrod,” 
but by the fragility of the characters. Some audience members elevated 
the communal feeling of the title track by holding up their phones with 
the flashlight app shining.<br>
<br>
When The River was first released, if you really wanted to show that 
kind of appreciation for a song, you burned your fingers. But those days
 are gone, aren’t they? I remember reading years ago about how 
Springsteen thinking about producer Phil Spector’s idea of an album’s 
“four corners.” The first and last songs on the first side, flip it 
over, the first and last songs on the second side.<br>
<br>
It’s an appreciation for a cohesive set of themes and images and sounds 
and album-cover art that’s been discarded in this digital age of fans 
downloading hit singles and ignoring the rest of the music. Such 
selective listening of a musician’s work is like skipping most of that 
ponderous Moby-Dick and reading only the section where Ahab harpoons the
 whale. Yes, you would think, Ahab’s perseverance paid off.<br>
<br>
But the whale sunk the ship!<br>
<br>
I apologize for not issuing a spoiler alert there for anyone who’s not 
read Moby-Dick. But the point being, an album heard in its entirety is a
 statement of where the artist was at that point in time. And perhaps 
where you were as well.</div>

If you know any of the 19,000 Bruce Springsteen fans who caught his 
sold-out show Monday night at St. Paul’s Xcel Energy Center, be warned. 
They’re never going to shut up about it.<br>
<br>
Springsteen built his career on the back of his live show and, at 66, 
he’s not only not slowing down, he’s actually getting better. As crazy 
as it sounds, Monday’s show might just be his most memorable yet at the 
X.<br>
<br>
Late last year, Springsteen’s label released an expanded deluxe version 
of his 1980 double album “The River” and the Boss decided that was the 
perfect opportunity to perform it live, in its entirety. Not only did it
 turn out to be an exciting, emotional two hours, Springsteen followed 
it up with more than an hour of some of his most rousing classics, each 
played as if it were the last song of his last concert ever.<br>
<br>
<br>
It started simply enough, just after 8 p.m., with Springsteen and the E 
Street Band walking onstage with the house lights still blazing. They 
didn’t dim until after the band wrapped the first song, “Meet Me in the 
City,” a “River”-era outtake that sounded like it could have been a No. 1
 hit. “The River,” Springsteen told us, was a “coming of age record” 
about, among other things: dancing, laughter, jokes, sex, love, faith 
and lonely nights. “I wanted to make a big record that felt like life,” 
he said, “that felt like an E Street Band show.”<br>
<br>
From there, Springsteen dived deep into “The River,” which happens to 
open with four consecutive barn burners in “The Ties That Bind,” “Sherry
 Darling,” “Jackson Cage” and “Two Hearts.” The mood then shifted for 
“Independence Day,” a stirring song about a son realizing his parents 
are human, too, and that it’s time for him to move out of the house and 
get on with his life.<br>
<br>
For “Hungry Heart,” Springsteen jumped off the stage and into the 
general-admission floor, which featured a small catwalk that allowed him
 to get close enough to sweat on the fans. And midway through the song, 
Springsteen crowd surfed his way back to the main stage with the vigor 
of an 18-year-old at his first Warped Tour.<br>
<br>
But this wasn’t a show just about antics and gimmicks. Springsteen gave 
the slow songs every bit as much attention and turned in some truly 
gorgeous, touching vocal performances that made “I Wanna Marry You” and 
“Point Blank” every bit as entertaining as “Cadillac Ranch” and 
“Ramrod.”<br>
<br>
After “Wreck on the Highway,” Springsteen chirped “That’s ‘The River!’” 
And had that been the end of the show, few would have left disappointed.
 Instead, Springsteen then launched into an “encore,” which turned out 
to be another dozen songs (plus a cover of the Isley Brothers’ “Shout”).
 <br>
<br>
This is where Springsteen fans started crying and hugging each other: 
“Badlands,” “No Surrender,” “Prove it All Night,” “Backstreets,” 
“Because the Night,” “The Rising,” “Thunder Road,” “Born to Run,” “Bobby
 Jean” (St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman was apparently singing every word),
 “Dancing in the Dark,” “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)” and “Tenth Avenue 
Freeze-Out.”</div>

<br>
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel <br>
music writer Piet Levy <br>
 March 4, 2016</strong><br>
<br>
How can one summarize "The River," Bruce Springsteen's ambitious double album from 1980?<br>
<br>
The Boss took a crack at it Thursday night at a packed BMO Harris 
Bradley Center, dubbing it his "coming-of-age record." He wanted it to 
be as big as life itself, so he made it about "fun, dancing, jokes, good
 comradeship, love, sex, faith, lonely nights and of course teardrops."<br>
<br>
But played in its entirety in Milwaukee as part of Springsteen and the E
 Street Band's "The River Tour," the music from the album took on even 
greater meaning.<br>
<br>
On Thursday, Springsteen tapped into the passion first put to tape 36 
years ago, sprinting from song to song, often with barely a second's 
rest.<br>
<br>
During "Hungry Heart," he strolled through the arena floor for 
handshakes and selfies, tucked a fan's sunflower behind his left ear, 
and lowered himself back first from an elevated catwalk, letting 
outstretched hands carry him back to the stage. He clustered close to 
his band mates around mic stands, like he was still that kid playing in 
those New Jersey bars, and engaged in some playful call and response 
with Steven Van Zandt at the end of the flirty "You Can Look (But You 
Better Not Touch)." And near the end of roadhouse rocker "Ramrod," most 
of the band gathered at the lip of the stage for a bit of butt shaking.<br>
<br>
But Springsteen, at 66, has lived a lot of life since "The River" was 
released. He's made a lot of good music and performed countless shows in
 the subsequent decades. This is not an artist who coasts on nostalgia.<br>
<br>
So on Thursday Springsteen didn't just bring youthful energy — brought 
experience and wisdom. And he made many songs from "The River" even 
richer.<br>
<br>
For "Point Blank," he did so before even speaking a word. The song began
 with Roy Bittan's piano — ornate yet aching — as Max Weinberg gently 
tapped the drums with mallets. Springsteen meanwhile had his back to the
 crowd in the dim light, eyes closed, his head gently nodding, his body 
swaying. His face was grim as he slowly brushed the inside of his right 
cheek with his tongue, and he seemed to struggle as he said the words, 
"You wake up and you're dying/You don't even know what from."<br>
<br>
Springsteen brought similar gravitas to the title track, complementing 
his weathered rasp with beautiful, borderline falsetto coos. And for 
"Drive All Night," his vocals and the band dropped down to a whisper; at
 his greatest moment of vulnerability, Weinberg's drums and Charlie 
Giordano's keyboards lifted him up, symbolically giving him the courage 
to sing, "You've got my love, you've got my love."<br>
<br>
After the "River" material (including a spirited outtake, "Meet Me in 
the City," released with a deluxe "River" box set last December), 
Springsteen and the E Street Band played another 13 songs. And as the 
night went on, they became more energized.<br>
<br>
Guitarist Nils Lofgren launched into a stormy guitar solo during 
"Because the Night" (first released by Patti Smith), while spinning in 
circles on one foot. Saxophonist Jake Clemons captured the soul of his 
towering late uncle Clarence during an epic rendition of "Born to Run" 
finale "Jungleland." Thousands danced under the bright white house 
lights for "Dancing in the Dark," including one fan who danced with 
Springsteen on stage.<br>
<br>
From start to finish, the concert spanned 33 songs across three-and-a-half hours.<br>
<br>
Before wrapping up "The River" set, Springsteen spoke a few seconds more
 about what the album was about, offering a thesis that likely resonated
 with him more today than it did as a young man.<br>
<br>
"The River," he said, was about "time slipping away.... You realize you 
have a limited amount of time to do your work, to raise your family, to 
try and do something good."<br>
<br>
Thursday in Milwaukee, he did something great.</div>

Bruce Springsteen Is Full of Shit (But He's Still the Greatest) <br>
By Jaime Lees</strong><br>
<br>
Forget Marlon Brando or Daniel Day-Lewis. Bruce Springsteen is the best actor of all time.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is one of America's finest exports. He's the 
embodiment of the blue-collar dream: a man who worked hard and didn't 
give up until he built something massively successful out of nothing. He
 is talented. He is attractive. He is charisma personified. He is also, 
however, full of shit.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is the most impressive actor that you've ever seen. His 
whole persona is based off of being a rock &amp; roll everyman. The 
story is simple: He came from meager beginnings in Nowheresville, New 
Jersey. His parents sacrificed and saved to buy his first electric 
guitar. Young Bruce learned to play, stayed invisible in school, 
narrowly escaped a stint in the army and then took every shitty gig 
possible until he was finally saved by musical superstardom.<br>
<br>
That's some fine myth-making right there. Because while the whole story might be true, it leaves out some important parts.<br>
<br>
Springsteen, after all, was fairly successful pretty early into his 
career. He built a cult following in his region just a few years after 
he started playing under his own name — and talent scouts and managers 
took notice. In fact, one of the few hardships he's faced professionally
 came about because he found management almost immediately. That 
management wasn't the best, and for a while Springsteen didn't own the 
rights to his own music. But this was remedied with a legal battle 
almost 40 years ago.<br>
<br>
He still sings many of the songs that he wrote back in the beginning. 
And he still sings about union cards and hungry hearts and glory days 
and the demise of the Chicken Man. He still sings about being lonesome 
and driving in cars late at night and the feeling of suffocating 
small-town doom. His heartbreak still sounds fresh and real — not 
contrived or inauthentic at all.<br>
<br>
But he hasn't been a scruffy little underdog for decades; that is just a
 pose. Consider this: He's touring now to promote a box set version of 
The River, an album that he released in 1980. Many of the songs from The
 River were leftovers from a previous album. Meaning this: The man is so
 successful that his re-released leftovers still get fanfare almost 
three and a half decades later. Springsteen is not a tramp like us and 
he hasn't been for a long, long time.<br>
<br>
He might remember what it feels like to be a working-class bumpkin, but 
he couldn't possibly relate to it anymore. It's difficult to reconcile 
Springsteen's finely crafted down-on-their-luck characters with his 
undisputed international success. He used to sing longingly about the 
unattainable mansion on the hill, but now he can buy many mansions on 
many hills. He might have gotten his start playing gritty seaside 
hellholes, but now he buys houses in Beverly Hills and earns $100 
million record deals and $10 million book advances.<br>
<br>
You'd have to be shockingly uninformed to believe that Springsteen still
 lives the life that he sings about or that he's anything like the 
personalities in his classic songs. But does any of this weird 
dissonance matter when you watch him on stage? Nope. Not one bit.<br>
<br>
It doesn't matter if you know his history. It doesn't matter if you 
don't know all of his songs. It doesn't even matter if you like his 
music. When he stands behind a microphone, Springsteen will own you. You
 will believe him and his stories. You'll think that his concert only 
ended so that he could get to work on time for the graveyard shift at 
his factory job.<br>
<br>
At this point, Springsteen could totally phone it in. He's been at it 
for so long that he could just set his stage to cruise control and still
 sell out every show. At age 66, with nearly 50 years of performing 
publicly under his belt, he wouldn't even be faulted for not producing a
 multi-hour extravaganza. He could just show up in a pair of khaki 
shorts and still get paid royally — but that slacker blood, it never 
burned in his veins.<br>
<br>
When Springsteen commits to playing a concert, he commits to bringing 
his all while dropping both sweat and panties. He has a reputation to 
uphold. His shows are athletic, energetic and appear to be exhausting. 
Some of his records may be earnest and restrained, but in a live setting
 his focus and energy can't be beat. No single man has worked so hard 
onstage since James Brown. Others in his age group still do stadium 
shows and do them well, but it takes four whole Rolling Stones to pull 
off the prowess of just one Bruce Springsteen.<br>
<br>
With Springsteen, you know what you're going to get. He'll take the 
stage in painted-on jeans. He'll be all rippling tendons, like a panther
 on the hunt. He'll tell stories between songs that sound like he's 
reading poetry. His leathery face will fluctuate between beaming and 
grimace. He'll grunt and growl and howl and then whisper like he's 
telling you a secret. He'll take charge of your emotions and crush you, 
but then he'll lift you up so high that you'll feel like you're flying. 
He'll skip taking an encore break and just continue to breeze across the
 stage like it ain't no thing. He will finally exit in a graceful blaze 
of glory.<br>
<br>
His marathon show will clock in at around three and a half hours. You 
will leave completely spent and feeling extra tired for him. More 
importantly, you will leave thinking that somehow, some way, he still 
fully believes every damn word that he sang.<br>
<br>
So when you're having a debate over who is the best actor ever, forget 
Marlon Brando or Meryl Streep or Daniel Day-Lewis. The only real answer 
is also the greatest living performer of our time: Bruce Frederick 
Joseph Springsteen. Catch his live show if you can; it's unbeatable. 
He's a man with nothing to prove who still goes out and proves it every 
night of his tour. Springsteen will take you and make you his bitch. 
They don't call him "The Boss" for nothing.</div>

Bruce Springsteen Brought the House Down at Chaifetz Arena<br>
Posted By Ben Westhoff on Mon, Mar 7, 2016 </strong><br>
<br>
<br>
In the aughts it became trendy for artists to play, in concert, their 
most beloved album in its entirety. Bruce Springsteen has about ten most
 beloved albums, but for its 35th anniversary late last year he decided 
to revisit 1980’s The River, first with a box set and now a tour. The 
River isn’t Bruce’s sexiest album. In fact, it’s a little bloated, and 
performing it at Chaifetz Arena last night took him and the E Street 
Band about two hours. Of course, for them that represented only a little
 more than half the concert. <br>
<br>
But, as he explained while introducing it, the work’s sprawling 
messiness is the whole point. It’s intended to encapsulate work and love
 and joy and family and faith and sex and struggle. Life itself. He 
wrote it in hopes, he added, that he might figure out how to get all of 
that for himself. He was 31 at the time, and this was before his 
short-lived marriage to model Julianne Phillips, and his current one to 
bandmate Patti Scialfa. He and Patti, by the way – and he swore this was
 true – first got together in St. Louis (which he kept calling “St. 
Lou”). They took a walk under the Arch, felt its “magnetic rays,” and 
“that was it.”<br>
<br>
The subject of family is an odd thing for an arena rock star to sing 
about, then and now. Again, discussing your parents, children and the 
struggles of family is just not hot. But Bruce has always been able to 
put a sheen on difficult, unglamorous ideas, and the two fifty-something
 women next to me (made up for the occasion) were incredibly excited to 
be there. “You have to write something about ‘Hungry Heart,’” one of 
them said, grabbing my wrist, as the opening chords of album’s biggest 
hit came on. OK then — “Hungry Heart” is an incredibly depressing tune 
about the pain we bring upon others while trying to make ourselves less 
lonely, but one which sounds like a happy love song. <br>
<br>
And much of the rest of The River touches on similar themes. It’s not 
about how love conquers all; it’s about how love is just the beginning. 
It sets you in motion, and then you have to live with the consequences.<br>
<br>
I teared up twice during the show, if by “teared up” you mean reduced to
 a sobbing, blubbering mess. The first was before “Independence Day,” 
about a conversation between father and son, with the disenchanted 
latter set to leave the nest in the morning. “They ain't gonna do to me,
 what I watched them do to you,” he says. Springsteen said the song is 
about that moment when you realize your parents had their own hopes and 
dreams, but they had to make compromises. When you’re a kid, all you can
 see are the compromises, and you feel boxed in and want out. <br>
<br>
Like most people at the show, I’m old enough to have kids and young 
enough to have parents still alive. People at that age see the human 
life cycle with particular, disturbing clarity, near its beginning and 
near its end. Everything feels so damn consequential. You’re in charge 
now. You’ve taken over for your parents. You once swore you’d never make
 the same mistakes they did. And maybe you didn’t. You just make 
different ones. <br>
<br>
The second time I cried was during “The River” because, well, “The 
River” is the saddest song ever written. "Now all them things that 
seemed so important / Well they vanished right into the air / I just act
 like I don't remember / Mary acts like she don't care." Bruce wrote it 
based on his sister’s real-life experiences. She’s Mary. Although, that 
actually makes the whole thing a little less depressing. Even if her 
husband was laid off from his construction job, you’d imagine Bruce 
would be willing to make them a low-interest loan. “The River” is a 
little less explicit than album opener, “The Ties That Bind,” which is 
about accepting what you can’t change — even if that thing is a shitty 
husband.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the concert also saw Springsteen crowd surfing (he’s 66) as well
 as calling up a guy from the audience who wanted to play with the band 
on “Working on the Highway.” (The guy, whose name was Tom and looked to 
be about 25, showboated and killed it.) E Street band shows always have a
 lot of mic-sharing, where, say Bruce and Steven Van Zandt lean way in 
and sing in time together. Bad for sonics, but great for team building. 
As always, the loudest applause went to saxophonist Jake Clemons, the 
nephew of beloved late E Street Band sax player Clarence Clemons, 
although Nils Lofgren got major cheers for his solo during “Because the 
Night,” which he performed while spinning around in circles.<br>
<br>
Truth be told, most people in the audience didn’t cry, as far as I could
 tell, and everybody was elated by the show’s final twenty minutes, 
which included “Dancing in the Dark,” “Rosalita” and “Tenth Avenue 
Freeze Out.” Oh, and finally, “Shout,” the Isley Brothers’ song that is 
only one step away from “Y.M.C.A.” in terms of its crowdspoloitation 
gimmickiness. But who cares. Getting roused up after a long night of 
beer drinking with your fellow middle-aged comrades is part of the life 
cycle too. That’s the sheen. That’s the joy.</div>
