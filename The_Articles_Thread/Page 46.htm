Forty years on, why the Boss was born to run and run</strong><br>
<br>
As Bruce Springsteen releases his 18th album and hits the road yet 
again, what is it that drives this tireless troubadour? No lesser 
ambition than putting the world to rights …<br>
<br>
During his keynote speech at the South by Southwest music festival in 
Austin, Texas two years ago, Bruce Springsteen reminded his audience of a
 famous remark made by rock critic Lester Bangs at the time of Elvis 
Presley's death in 1977: "Lester said that Elvis was probably the last 
thing we [the worldwide audience for pop music] were going to agree on."<br>
<br>
Springsteen was making a point about the diversity of the music being 
played today, and the consequent splintering of the audience into 
factions. "There is no key note," he said. "There is no unified theory 
of everything." He was too modest to point out that the figure closest 
to undermining Bangs's prophecy is himself, a New Jersey singer, 
guitarist, songwriter, bandleader and campaigner who turned 64 in 
September, the week after concluding his latest world tour.<br>
<br>
No one else, not even Bob Dylan, combines the role of entertainer with 
that of social conscience as diligently and effectively as Springsteen, 
or with such generosity of spirit. During the six months of the Wrecking
 Ball tour – named after his 2012 album, in which he raged against 
bankers and their political accomplices – he had played to 3.5 million 
people at 133 concerts across 26 countries. Fans in Helsinki were 
regaled with the longest of the many marathon shows he has given over 
the past 40 years, lasting four hours and six minutes – not including 
the 30-minute acoustic set he had performed two hours before the 
scheduled start, for the benefit of early arrivals.<br>
<br>
His energy was not spent when the tour finished in Rio de Janeiro. Two 
weeks later, presumably having got his laundry done, he was turning up 
with an acoustic guitar at Madison Square Garden in New York to perform 
at a benefit for Stand Up for Heroes, a charity set up to help injured 
veterans of the Iraq war. A frequent performer at events held to promote
 or raise funds for causes he supports, he retains an air of unaffected 
naturalness and seldom attracts the snide disapproval aimed at some of 
his contemporaries who are seen as seeking personal publicity for their 
good works.<br>
<br>
His public activism began in 1979 with the No Nukes concert in New York.
 In 1985 he and Willie Nelson campaigned against the closure of 3M's 
audio/video tape factory in Freehold, New Jersey. Twenty concerts for 
Amnesty International in 1988, in cities from Buenos Aires to New Delhi,
 were followed by a benefit for Sting's Rainforest charity in 1995. He 
campaigned for John Kerry on the Vote for Change tour during the 2004 US
 presidential election, appeared at Barack Obama's rallies four years 
later, and performed at an Autism Speaks fundraiser at Carnegie Hall in 
2009. The following year he could be seen on telethons raising money for
 victims of the Haitian disaster – more than $60m – and Hurricane Sandy.
 In 2012 he joined the Obama re-election bandwagon. After last year's 
bomb explosion during the Boston marathon he helped a local punk band, 
the Dropkick Murphys, to raise funds for the victims.<br>
<br>
Two weeks from today, he and the E Street Band will be in Cape Town for 
the first of 17 dates taking them from South Africa to Australia and New
 Zealand. This is called the High Hopes tour, named after his new album,
 to be released tomorrow. As usual, great anticipation surrounds its 
appearance. His 18th studio album since his debut in 1973 comes at a 
time when he is expected to produce something that politicians are 
reluctant or too embarrassed to provide: an honest assessment of the 
state of things.<br>
<br>
"I don't have some big idea," he said in 1996. "I don't feel like I have
 some enormous political message I'm trying to deliver. I think my work 
has to come from the inside. I don't start from the outside – 'I have a 
statement to make, ladies and gentlemen!' – I don't like the soapbox 
thing, so I begin internally with things that matter to me personally 
and maybe were a part of me in some fashion."<br>
<br>
Nevertheless Wrecking Ball faced that challenge head on, dripping with 
anger and irony in songs such as We Take Care of Our Own ("From Chicago 
to New Orleans/ From the muscle to the bone/ From the shotgun shack to 
the Superdome/ There ain't no help, the cavalry stayed home"); Jack of 
All Trades ("The banker man grows fat/ The working man grows thin/ It's 
all happened before/ And it'll happen again"); and American Land ("They 
tried to get here 100 years ago/ They're still dyin' now/ The hands that
 built the country/ We're always tryin' to keep out").<br>
<br>
His moral compass first came into view on Darkness on the Edge of Town, 
the 1978 album in which he transformed himself from a celebrant of a 
semi-mythical neon-lit America of stripped-down hot rods and high-school
 sweethearts into a kind of pathologist of the American dream, 
investigating its corroded hulk and examining the lives of the dead and 
injured. In 1982 a harsh, bare-bones solo album called Nebraska took its
 tone from Terrence Malick's film Badlands, the story of teenage killers
 inspired by the Charlie Starkweather murder spree of the 1950s. Two 
years later he was outraged when the title track of Born in the USA, 
written in the voice of an embittered Vietnam veteran, was appropriated 
by the Republican party, who mistook its deceptively exultant chorus and
 tried to use it as a flag-waving campaign anthem for Ronald Reagan. 
That sort of misunderstanding, he vowed, would never happen again.<br>
<br>
In 1995 he won a Grammy for Streets of Philadelphia, a subdued song 
written for Jonathan Demme's Philadelphia, the first mainstream 
Hollywood film to confront the Aids epidemic. In 1996 he gave an 
interview to the Advocate, an LGBT magazine, in which he endorsed gay 
marriage, comparing it to his own second wedding, to the singer Patti 
Scialfa: "It's very different than just living together. First of all, 
stepping up publicly – which is what you do; you get your licence, you 
do all the social rituals – is part of your place in society, and in 
some way part of society's acceptance of you. Those are the threads of 
society; that's how we all live together in some fashion. There is no 
reason I can see why gays and lesbians shouldn't get married."<br>
<br>
The shooting of the unarmed Amadou Diallo, an immigrant from Guinea, by 
four NYPD officers inspired his 1999 song American Skin (41 Shots), 
costing him support among those who had misconstrued his music and taken
 him for a symbol of beer-drinking, gun-owning all-American manhood. In 
The Rising, which came a year after 9/11, he made the significant 
gesture of adding a group of qawwali singers from Pakistan to one song, 
Worlds Apart. In 2006 he renewed his creative spark and paid homage to 
the folk hero Pete Seeger by assembling a new band to play traditional 
folk and protest songs on an album called We Shall Overcome: The Seeger 
Sessions, a move so successful that the raucous spontaneity and 
home-made texture of the music was allowed to influence all his 
subsequent efforts.<br>
<br>
High Hopes, assembled from cover versions, songs left off recent albums 
and new versions of old favourites, appears on the surface to have no 
central message to impart. But its individual songs, although drawn from
 a variety of sources, nevertheless convey an impression of a confused 
America licking its wounds and looking for salvation. Several songs, 
including a storming remake of The Ghost of Tom Joad, feature Tom 
Morello, the 49-year-old singer and guitarist formerly with Rage Against
 the Machine, a political activist whose presence seems to have provided
 his temporary employer with a burst of fresh energy.<br>
<br>
Springsteen loves his job, which is one of the reasons his concerts are 
such delirious fun, but he is well aware that his chosen milieu, the 
entertainment business, is "a world of illusions, a world of symbols". 
Nevertheless his new album finishes with a stirring cover of a great 
song, Dream Baby Dream, written and recorded 35 years ago by the New 
York electro-punk band Suicide. Your finest dreams, he is saying, don't 
have to be illusions. They really can change the world.</div>

				<div class="content">A Long Road To 'High Hopes': An Interview With Bruce Springsteen<br>
by ANN POWERS<br>
January 15, 2014 <br>
<br>
NPR<br>
<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen walked into SIR Studios in Manhattan with the 
shearling collar on his chocolate-brown bomber jacket popped up. He 
cracked a joke about the traffic he encountered on the way from New 
Jersey, tacitly hinting at the Chris Christie-eviscerating skit he and 
Jimmy Fallon would perform the next night on the comic's late-night 
show. In the flesh, he looked exactly The Boss, ready for action in an 
impeccable grey sweatshirt, black jeans and brown boots, his athletic 
body moving efficiently into the chair opposite his interviewer. He'd 
made time for a chat before a rehearsal with the E Street Band, to let 
people know about the new album, High Hopes, out this week.<br>
<br>
Springsteen had some things he wanted to say, about his producers and 
his bandmates, including new member Tom Morello, and the decade or so of
 recalibrating his own creative style that has resulted in this 
collection of re-imagined older material and no-longer-lost tracks 
(listen to the complete interview, with selections from the album, at 
the audio link on this page). But he was also quick to laugh and ready 
to listen. He warmed up while talking about other artists — peers like 
U2, elders like Dylan, and relative newcomers like Jason Isbell and 
Savages (at one point he got so excited talking about the musicians he's
 listening to lately that asked for his laptop so he could read names 
off his playlists) and gave careful consideration to big issues like 
mortality and more day-to-day matters, like figuring out which new songs
 work within his legendary live sets.<br>
<br>
Careful while discussing the biographical and musical touchstones of his
 persona, Springsteen didn't show much interest in shoring up the myth 
of Bruuuuuce. When this overly enthusiastic lifetime fan compared him to
 Picasso, he raised his eyebrows and mentioned Abbott and Costello 
instead; when he mentioned that many of his neighbors were affected by 
the destruction of the twin towers, I interjected, "First responders," 
but he reminded me that in his wealthy New Jersey township most people 
work in high finance. Springsteen is aware that he lives among the 
elite. Yet as a musician, he's still a skilled worker — maybe more so 
than ever. Our conversation ended with talk of plans, plans, plans: to 
maintain a steady stream of new releases; to use the Internet for 
archival and other purposes, and and to keep the E Street Band on the 
road, if not forever, for a good long time. Until he drops, Springsteen 
will pay his audience in sweat equity. Though again, he'd deflate any 
praise for that. When it comes to music, he reminded me, "musicians 
don't call it working; they call it playing."<br>
<br>
Let's start by talking about the title track and how the title track 
frames the album in a way. It's a cover; it's a song you've done several
 times in your career. And the album as a whole, it's a new album 
through which you reflect on a period of your career which I would sort 
of mark starting around The Rising, maybe.<br>
<br>
Yeah, it's a bit of a mixture of things, you know, where it's just music
 I had that I liked. And I've always got many, many songs running around
 looking for homes at all times. And I'm always trying to figure out how
 to give them one, you know. And you know the process: You make a 
record, and like I said, over the past decade, we've recorded quite a 
bit but not quite in the style that we had in the '70s and '80s where 
there were enormous bodies of work that never saw the light of day or 
songs that never came out. I mean, there's just so much stuff still in 
the vault, you know. <br>
<br>
I think The Rising was 15 songs and there may have been a few outtakes, 
you know, not many. The same thing with Magic and Working On a [Dream]. 
Those were all records that we just simply didn't have a large body of 
outtakes. So these groups of songs were songs that sort of, you know, 
this one would have got on except ... "Down In the Hole" would have got 
on but "Empty Sky" got on or "Harry's Place" would have got on but — I'm
 not sure, I think we were considering that for Magic — but you know so 
these were songs that just sort of, just slightly slipped out.<br>
<br>
It's like a parallel universe of Bruce Springsteen music.<br>
<br>
Slightly, you know, a little bit. So these were all things that I liked a
 lot that we were planning to have on records and just missed, you know,
 for whatever the reason might be.<br>
<br>
Some of them you recorded in the past, though, yes?<br>
<br>
Yeah and there were a lot of unusual things where like I said we have "American Skin" which I cut live.<br>
<br>
"[The Ghost of] Tom Joad," obviously.<br>
<br>
The past couple of records I tried — well, on Wrecking Ball, we got 
"Land of Hope and Dreams" out. If I have a song that I feel is really 
one of my best songs, I like it to have a formal studio recording 
because I believe that something being officially released on a studio 
record gives it a certain authority that it doesn't quite have if it 
comes out on a live album or is just a part of your show, you know.<br>
<br>
Right.<br>
<br>
"The Ghost of Tom Joad," the version that I do with Tom [Morello], was 
sort of my original realization of it. I originally wrote it as a rock 
song for the E Street Band and we didn't quite pull it off and that led 
to The Ghost of Tom Joad acoustic album, but I always had in my mind 
that, you know, that was its inception. That was how it was originally 
conceived, so we started to fool around with it onstage. I came up with a
 version of it and then Tom walked in one night and just exploded the 
boundaries of the thing and turned it into just something else. So, OK, 
we need — I want — that on a formal studio recording and I want 
"American Skin" on a formal studio recording because I think it may be 
one of my best songs ever, you know, but it's certainly, it needed to be
 represented outside of the sort of context it was originally presented 
in and I just, I just still feel deeply, deeply connected to the song.<br>
<br>
<br>
Then you have to get very good studio recordings of it because the 
problem you have then is you probably have very good live versions of 
those things and so you have to come up with something that equals or 
betters that in some way and that can be very difficult. We spent a lot 
of time on "The Land of Hope and Dreams" on the Wrecking Ball album 
because it was difficult to match or beat the live version. We played 
with it rhythmically, we played with it arrangementally; didn't know if 
we were gonna get it; didn't know if we had it. And then Bob 
Clearmountain came up with a mix of it that suddenly presented it to us 
and we said, "OK, that's great."  Although the version of "American 
Skin" is pretty close to our live version but then Tom enters the 
picture and he just does something slightly different with it, you know,
 he just creates a certain ambiance. And then also Ron Aniello, who's 
been my current producer, goes in and there's subtle things in the 
rhythm and little loops we may use and it just suddenly it begins to 
breathe a life of its own and I go, "OK, this is going to sound really 
good on record."<br>
<br>
<br>
Do you have to let go at some point? I mean do you have to step back? 
Your own ego has to retreat and allow for these collaborations ...<br>
<br>
I never let that happen. [Laughs] But what I have gotten used to doing 
is I do delegate a lot more in the studio than I used to, which is nice 
because I don't think I could work the way I did in my 20s when I, we 
had a little bit of the half-blind leading the blind in that we all went
 in and just recorded until a record happened.<br>
<br>
I remember reading you would be sleeping in the studio in your coat.<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah. It was terrible, you know. In truth, it was awful, an awful 
way to make records but it was the only way we knew how. Everybody 
simply suffered through it and the endless, endless, endless hours I 
can't begin to explain.<br>
<br>
We thank you for those hours.<br>
<br>
But it was just what it took at the time, you know, I was just very, 
very much more controlling at the time so I was always there and I 
always had my hand in everything. Where today, now, you know it's very 
similar even with the live show, where I, over the years, have gathered a
 team of people, where you find people who, when you leave, will advance
 your thought processes and then come up with things you would not have 
thought of and you can come back then and you can edit what you feel is 
great and what you feel might not work. <br>
<br>
And you could be open to that? You felt ready?<br>
<br>
Well, yeah, because I had no idea where to go next. I had gone in and 
attempted to record the band in 1998 and it just wasn't very good. The 
only nice thing that came out of it was the version of "The Wall" that 
is on this record, you know, that was cut at that time. But everything 
else just sort of laid there, you know. It just wasn't exciting, you 
know. And so Brendan was the guy who, he kind of reignited our recording
 process through a very different sonic landscape, you know. And he 
brought us back to our roots in that we recorded on 24-track tape with 
the bass and the drums and he just had a way of recording things that 
made things sound exciting. And he made you excited then, you know. So 
then I excitedly went home and wrote more songs to bring back.<br>
<br>
Your producer is always your first audience. So, you know, Mr. [Jon] 
Landau [Springsteen's longtime manager] has been my first and primary 
audience for many, many, many, many years — he still is — but your 
producer is also your first audience. He's the first guy you play the 
song for, he's the first guy you are seducing with the music that you've
 written — you're trying to get him excited about what he thinks he can 
do with it — and then it just, you know, it just starts to become 
cumulatively explosive, you know. So Brendan was a new audience. He was 
very different than Mr. Landau in the sense that he would rarely, he 
never asked about any of the lyrics — that wasn't his primary concern. 
The entire time we cut The Rising, we never mentioned what the album 
might be about at all.<br>
<br>
Really?<br>
<br>
No. All we did was go in and make the music, you know. He was just, if 
it was exciting coming out of the speakers ... and he had an instinct 
for lyric in that he'd say, "No, we need another line here. We need 
another chorus here. We need something that rhymes with 'orange,' " or 
whatever, you know. And so he had an internal instinct for what felt 
right, you know. We made those records in about three weeks.<br>
<br>
Wow.<br>
<br>
And you know mixed them in a week. So all of those ...<br>
<br>
Like The Beatles or something.<br>
<br>
Yeah, most of my early, most of my records of this past decade return to the way that we cut Greetings From Asbury Park. <br>
<br>
Well, just on the subject of The Rising [and Sept. 11], the song "Down 
in the Hole" on this new album, which to me is one of the centerpieces, 
I've wondered if that event, I don't know, when you think about artists,
 there are some times with their careers — Picasso with Guernica, Aretha
 Franklin with the death of Martin Luther King — their lives are changed
 by a moment in history, their artistic vision is changed. And I'm 
projecting onto you that perhaps ...<br>
<br>
More like Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, that might be, I think we better take it down a notch.<br>
<br>
Fair enough. But do you think the world is different now? I mean, 
obviously the world is different but how is the change in America after 
Sept. 11, how has that impacted your writing and the period that this 
album High Hopes reflects?<br>
<br>
I live here, so I was interested. When I was very, very young, I decided
 that I was gonna catalogue my times because that's what other people 
who I admired did. That's what Bob Dylan did, that's what Frank Sinatra 
did, Hank Williams did, in very different ways. You know, The Beatles 
did, The Rolling Stones did. So I enjoyed artists that engaged in their 
worlds and then created some reflection of it that people could meditate
 upon and think upon. So that was just, to me, I was just continuing 
along doing what I was doing. But I also happen to come from an area 
that was very hard hit in 9/11. Monmouth County lost a lot of ...<br>
<br>
First responders?<br>
<br>
A lot of good folks that worked up there and so it was very, very 
present. And you know, you knew women who lost their husbands and these 
were people who I'd known quite regularly and so it was very, very much a
 part of our area, you know, it being an area where so many people 
commuted. And so that had, I'm sure that had something to do with it 
also. And I mean, you know the day the twin towers were burning, I 
drove, you know, 10 minutes from my home and I stood on the Sea Bright 
Bridge and they sit right in the middle of that bridge when you stand in
 the middle of that bridge and there it was and you know the entire 
skyline turned yellow and gray and you know it was a very ... it was 
just something, you were there.<br>
<br>
I was there. I was in Brooklyn so I totally remember. On "Down in the 
Hole," your kids are credited as singing backup on the song.<br>
<br>
This is hilarious. My daughter, the other day — she had to sign a 
release. Of course, I doubt she remembers even [singing]. I think she 
was 8 years old when she did it, she's like 20 now. But she said, "What 
is this?" I said, "You're a recording artist. You have to like sign 
this." "Really?" "Yeah." "Oh, cool." Patti [Scialfa] sings fabulously on
 that track, first of all, she just did amazing things with her voice on
 it. And the kids did some sort of very ghosty part behind her or with 
her and they were very young and I, at the time, I recorded them on 
several things, some of which haven't been released but were just, they 
had a beautiful sound the three of them when they sang together at that 
time. And occasionally they still do and so I just brought them in and 
said, "OK, try this," and they put the big headsets on and they took a 
swing at it and they're on the record.<br>
<br>
I mean, to me it worked so well because it's a song about, I mean, is 
that person searching for a family member? It brings your own family 
into it, I think. It's very powerful.<br>
<br>
Yeah. It was just, it was a nice thing for them. And she was excited. She said, "Oh, boy." I'm not sure she gets paid.<br>
<br>
In this day and age, who knows. Let's talk about your other family, the 
band, and I mean the band has grown to many, many members now. And one 
of the interesting things about this project is it is in a way a 
conversation with yourself about past material, a conversation with Tom,
 but also across all the members of your band. And I'm just wondering 
about that dynamic right now and thinking about how it has evolved over 
the past decade.<br>
<br>
It's the best it's ever been, you know. And we're very lucky. You know, 
most bands don't work out. A small unit democracy is very, very 
difficult. Very, very difficult. And as you can see, there's very, very 
few exceptions. I think U2 are perhaps the other version where it works,
 I've seen it work. And they're all exceptional people, you know.<br>
<br>
I think of The Everly Brothers, you know, fighting, feuding.<br>
<br>
Well everybody. The Everly Brothers, Sam &amp; Dave, Simon &amp; 
Garfunkel. I mean, it's the rule, not the exception. You're not really 
family, but you're kind of, it's almost worse, you know, because not 
only do you live together, you have to work together. The only way I can
 explain it is imagine if the people you went to high school with, you 
have worked with those same five people that were in your math class and
 you're 60 and those are the same exact people that you've worked with 
every single day of your life.<br>
<br>
And sleep with them on a bus.<br>
<br>
Yeah. Or in the same bunks or same beds for many, many years. So the 
opportunity for overfamiliarity is very great. But it's kind of 
wonderful the way that different groups work it out, you know. And it's 
difficult but it's just, that's what a band is; a band is that thing. 
Whether it's Creedence Clearwater [Revival], whether it's The Rolling 
Stones, whether it's The Who, or the two young guys, the guys from 
Oasis. You know, it's like, it makes for very — The Kinks — there was 
something that each guy did that was not replaceable, it was not 
replaceable.<br>
<br>
Is that why you definitely included Danny [Federici] and Clarence [Clemons] on this recording, too? The voices had to be there?<br>
<br>
No, they just happened to play on those records, you know. And our band 
was pretty lucky in that, you know, we, I signed as a solo act. We 
weren't a democracy. We were kind of a relatively benevolent 
dictatorship where you could hear other voices and take them into 
account but at the end of the day it was kind of, it was OK with 
everybody that sort of, that the decision always came down to what I 
felt was right. And even then, you know, we had our own difficulties. 
And we stopped playing together for 10 years, partially because I had 
run out of ideas as to exactly where to take the band next but also, I 
think people were a little tired of one another. Which was just a normal
 thing to have occurred. And we were still in our late 30s and there's 
so many small things that enter into it. So when we took the decade off,
 when people came back, people realized, oh, this was like one of the 
best things of my life and this guy over there — you had new respect for
 everyone. I had new respect for the band. I had experienced playing 
without them and I said, "Well, these guys are elemental to something 
that I do." And I think it went all around. Everybody looked at the 
other guy and said, "Oh, I think we need that guy." People gave each 
other more room and at the same time, a lot of the smallness disappeared
 because everybody realized it was just unnecessary. And we had the 
greatest, we've had the greatest 10 or 12 years, in my opinion, you 
know, as far as just a living, working band that we've ever had. That's 
why the band is as good as it is onstage.<br>
<br>
And you know, when Clarence passed away, it was obviously very sad but I
 know that he was very, very happy the last decade that we played. He 
loved playing, he loved performing. And that we were able to get back to
 do it and do it for the 10 years that we did it was, it was a wonderful
 thing for the two of us. And I know that he was always just 
concentrating on the next gig and how he could make it. So we've been 
very, very fortunate. Part of it was by design in that we were not a 
democracy, but we were not a solo act either. We were something in 
between, you know, and that in-between thing has been what's made us 
special and it's been very exciting.<br>
<br>
The thought of an in-between space makes me want to talk about gospel 
music. And I know that you had an idea of doing a whole gospel project. 
We heard some of it on Wrecking Ball and we hear some of it on this 
album with "Heaven's Wall." I'm a great student of gospel music and I 
can see where that kind of call-response thing [is] really like the 
preacher leading a choir.<br>
<br>
Well, sure. That was where James Brown came from. The preacher, he's the
 original frontman. It's the shaman. If you go back, that was the 
original unit that functioned like that, whether it was in church or 
whether it was tribal. So the frontman kind of grew out of that thing 
and so it all gets thrown back to roots in blues and gospel music in 
church.<br>
<br>
But what was your idea for a gospel project? Because I know you've 
talked in the past about getting this religious impulse to work in a way
 that it's not restrictive or judgmental, you know. We talked about U2. 
They do a similar thing. And I hear that in songs like "Heaven's Wall" 
and even in some of your protest music, the version of "41 Shots" that's
 on the album, there's a lament quality to it, you know, and a 
trying-to-transcend quality.<br>
<br>
Without overusing the word, you know, there's a Christian element that 
runs through it because I grew up Catholic and so I was indoctrinated in
 religious language between eight o'clock and nine o'clock every single 
morning for the first eight years of my schooling. Five days a week, 
every single morning, the first thing you did was religion. And so you 
grew up with that language and it was, of course, distorted, and screwed
 me up terribly, but at the same time, it made for good writing. And it 
was a wonderful source of metaphor when you went to write about the 
world and about your inner life and it served me. I suppose looking back
 on it, I would like to change some things but I wouldn't have had that 
any other way in that it's served me very, very well and continues to do
 so. I have a very deep connection to gospel music. I understand the 
language — I feel I understand the essence of the music itself.<br>
<br>
Jay Z and I performed together for President Obama in Ohio and we were 
both on the same bill. I was playing acoustic and he had his group, you 
know. And the audience was filled with some of his fans and some of my 
fans. And his was a big arena — it was like 20,000 people. There were 
actually some people who'd probably come to see the president, right? So
 I'm coming out first and I'm gonna play acoustically and it was, you 
know, I thought "Promised Land" and I thought maybe "Land of Hopes and 
Dreams." And it was fascinating as I watched the crowd who — I knew a 
lot of them had not heard my music before — but who understood the 
language I was speaking in because it was very gospel-based — you know, 
"Promised Land" — and the issues that were involved. So that was a 
fascinating afternoon. It was a great afternoon for me because I got to 
stand onstage and there were young black kids and there were some older 
black folks. It was very, you know, multiracial and it was just a great 
afternoon. And I got to watch people sort of experience some of this, my
 songs in their bare bones for the first time.<br>
<br>
Well, you were talking earlier about how you and Brendan have worked 
with beats or I know on some of the songs [the credits read] "loops by 
Bruce Springsteen." This shows an influence perhaps of hip-hop or at 
least of the technology of hip-hop and I wonder if at some point in your
 listening, because I know that you listen to everything and one of the 
things I treasured about your South By Southwest talk that you gave was 
how you erase genre and you said, "We should embrace everything that 
sounds right to our ears," and I wondered if hip-hop was something at 
some point that kind of, the light went on for you and you got it or how
 does that work in relationship to you?<br>
<br>
Well it was so present, you know. At one moment particularly you had 
"White Lines" and this was stuff that was talking about what was going 
on in the streets and in the inner cities with people who were 
struggling. And that was something that, I mean, I had my own context 
for that, you know, that I wrote about it in my own way. But it was the 
music that came along and gave voice to those things outside of what was
 then considered a protest music context, you know, and did so really 
beautifully. And so, you know, I'm not well-versed in it but I have 
listened over the years. You know, Public Enemy, Notorious B.I.G., I 
listened to Tupac, I listen to Kanye West. Kanye West is incredible, you
 know. I mean, the record-making facility, you know, there's a lot of 
hours in those records and they're ...<br>
<br>
He's a perfectionist like you.<br>
<br>
I mean some of these, there's like, just the production. And I saw him 
on television, he did the song called "Blood on the Leaves" on the 
Later...With Jools Holland — it was fantastic, you know. He's a very, I 
still find him very interesting. I'm not necessarily driving [to] it in 
my car, you know. I probably fall back on the stuff that I listened to 
as a kid or something if I'm driving around. But I do listen. I listen 
to a lot because there's a lot of information in it and it's just 
fascinating record-making.<br>
<br>
Well the dual side or the flip coin of hip-hop might be country. And you
 know "Hunter of Invisible Game" for some reason, that song gives me a 
Hank feeling, a Hank Williams feeling.<br>
<br>
Oh, maybe.<br>
<br>
The loneliness, you know, I don't know but I know you love that kind of 
roots country and I wondered if there was a way you were still feeling 
that. There was a particular period in your history too, I know, when 
you turned to that music.<br>
<br>
Well, country music is kind of where rock music has gone really at this 
point, you know. It's basically kind of pop-rock music, you know. It's 
where rock music continues to have a certain currency.<br>
<br>
It's true.<br>
<br>
So it's kind of fascinating to hear country music now because, with the 
exception of the twang occasionally in the guitar and the voice, it's 
really, it's very much sort of '80s rock music or something. And it's an
 interesting genre because bad country music is some of the worst in the
 world, you know, but great country music is some of the best. My 
daughter got into a lot of new country music and she would kind of play 
it on the way to school on occasion and I got into a lot of some of the 
new guys. I like some of the Toby Keith records, Kenny Chesney.<br>
<br>
Toby's got that workingman's thing.<br>
<br>
Yeah and when he gets the song, when he's at his A game, it's really 
good, you know. When it's done, you know, I'm still back with George 
Jones and Conway Twitty and Lefty Frizzell. That's sort of my go-to, but
 there's a lot of good young country guys out there. Let me get my 
computer because I have all my stuff and I don't remember everybody's 
name. I have a lot of different playlists and things.<br>
<br>
I would love to know what you're listening to now. But I'm wondering, 
[in the meantime about] that sort of sense of loneliness in that song 
particularly, "Hunter of Invisible Game." I wonder how you cultivate 
that mood of like solitariness that's always been such an essential part
 of your music for me.<br>
<br>
That's not hard to do, you know, that's my fallback position in life in general.<br>
<br>
Is it really? I would have thought you were kind of a team player in some ways.<br>
<br>
That took me a long time. The team wasn't so interested in me.<br>
<br>
[He pulls laptop out of his bag and sets it on the table next to his chair. It drops on the floor.]<br>
<br>
Whoops. I'm crashing my computer now. So it took a long time to sort of 
go there. I had to get used to being good company for myself for a long 
time, which is good because every artist begins as an angry, isolated 
outsider in one way or another. I don't know anybody who's started some 
other way that I can think of. I mean, maybe there is.<br>
<br>
I'm thinking about R&amp;B and soul. Sometimes that, the people who come out of ...<br>
<br>
You're right. I think that might be, those roots might be different 
because they come up out of community and church. So I think that's a 
very different context. But I think for a lot of young — certainly blue 
collar — but young rock musicians ...<br>
<br>
And male musicians. Let's just point out, I mean, that's a very, the 
solitary male, you know, that's definitely an icon in rock music.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I've worked that one as hard as I can, you know.<br>
<br>
I'm really curious about the song "Harry's Place." Can I just ask a 
specific question about that? It's about the production. To me, it 
strikes me as almost psychedelic. It's a fantasy song to me.<br>
<br>
It is.<br>
<br>
And people always talk about Bruce Springsteen as a naturalist, you know, telling the real stories.<br>
<br>
Maybe they should check out Greetings From Asbury Park.<br>
<br>
I love the dream aspect of what you do. And I'm wondering if you can 
talk about the role of what dream and fantasy play in what you do.<br>
<br>
It's everything, of course. I mean, that's all we're doing, really, 
we're living in the world but it's all sort of dreams and it's all 
illusion. It's theater; it's not real. We're making up stories, you 
know, and people tend to run into you and believe you are your 
characters. And I suppose the funny thing is the longer you go, you do 
become sort of some version of them. You both diverge from them, you 
know, you live, but you also permanently inhabit that geography and that
 mental space and so you do morph a little bit. We do become what we 
imagine. And certainly this was the place, America was the place where 
you go and do that. And I mean really, my thing was very, very new. The 
characters in my songs were really my father's life. I mean, it's not my
 life. My life was, it was Inside Llewyn Davis with a happy ending, you 
know. I was, you know, I was that guy. I was the guy sleeping on the 
couch in midtown and taking the subway to Greenwich Village and I kind 
of caught the last tiny bit of the folk boom and you know I auditioned 
for John Hammond at The Gaslight [Cafe] and met David Blue. David Blue 
took me to meet Jackson Browne at The Bitter End when he was promoting 
his first record. And then he took me out and I met Odetta and I opened 
for Dave Van Ronk at Max's Kansas City. So I caught the very tail end of
 that thing you know with John Hammond.<br>
<br>
But what about the punk side?<br>
<br>
And I caught the beginning of that because I would open for Dave Van 
Ronk and if I missed my bus back to New Jersey, I had to go back to 
Max's. And when I went back to Max's, at 1 or 2 a,m., the New York Dolls
 were playing upstairs.<br>
<br>
Wow.<br>
<br>
And I'd never seen anything like it. They were great, you know. And so 
it was, I sat in this strange fulcrum between both something that was at
 its very end and something that was really just beginning. And so I saw
 the Dolls, this was 1973 I think. It had to be because I was playing 
solo acoustically. I mean, it was very, very early, you know. Or [1974] 
or somewhere in there, you know.<br>
<br>
That's the right period, I think.<br>
<br>
And so that was all going on downstairs. I never became a part of the 
downstairs scene at Max's. I just sort of took my bus in and went and 
did my gig and then I would run to get on the last bus back to New 
Jersey.<br>
<br>
What about Suicide and covering "Dream Baby Dream" in a way that I think
 Alan Vega never would have done. I mean, let's be honest.<br>
<br>
Well, I just loved them when I first heard them and I loved him, you 
know. I still think, he was a cross between sort of, it was futuristic 
and visionary and yet it was completely authentically rockabilly. And he
 was like Elvis if Elvis had been, you know, been sort of born in the 
mid-'70s or something. So they were always very, and he was incredibly, 
really, I don't know. He just manifested something that was always very 
mystifying and raw.<br>
<br>
Scary.<br>
<br>
And very sexy and very, very rebellious and they were very brave 
because, you know, they were very provocative in their day and the 
audiences I'm sure you know took it out on them from time to time. So 
they were just gutsy. It was just the real thing for me. And I wasn't 
gonna, you know, that wasn't where I was making my day but it was 
something that when I heard it, it really moved me a lot. And like I 
said, I think they should be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.<br>
<br>
Hopefully it will happen.<br>
<br>
And I think they're very, I think they're becoming more influential as 
time passes. I think this group Savages just did a cover of "Dream Baby 
Dream" also.<br>
<br>
You know, you were talking about how artists become their own fictions. 
But then, thinking about "The Ghost of Tom Joad" and especially "41 
Shots," and thinking about the Trayvon Martin story of this past year, 
you were also talking about people who don't have a chance to transcend 
their fictions. And I wonder if that, those kinds of stories interested 
you more in these recent years? It seems to.<br>
<br>
I just think that when you kind of grow up, I believe everything that 
I've written about kind of comes from the psychology of my childhood in 
the sense that I lived in an interesting house, you know, and I've said 
this many times. I lived in a house where somebody was very fulfilled by
 their work and a house where somebody was very lost in the workplace 
and struggled very hard to keep their head above water. And it was a 
house that, you know, it was the finance company that kept us floating 
month to month just barely, you know.<br>
<br>
So I saw that happen and it was a bit of, you know, sons and fathers. 
It's the old thing. Somebody asked T-Bone Burnett once what was rock 'n'
 roll: "Daddy," you know, somebody crying, "Daddy!" The whole sons and 
fathers thing — it'll never stop. I suppose it's somewhat boring at this
 point in time but the bottom line is it just is. Funny, when I went to 
work, you know I've said in the past, what did I do? I put on my 
father's clothes, really. I didn't put on my clothes. You know, when I 
began to craft a larger image than the one I started with in the early 
'70s, I very much crafted it. I used to have a funny dream, you know, 
where I would be in the audience while I was playing and I would somehow
 end up wandering down the aisle and I would come to my father's seat. 
And he would be sitting there with my mother alongside of him and this 
would be in the middle of the arena while the show was going on and I 
remember kneeling down and I would say, "Dad," I would point and say, 
"That's you. That's you." I said, "That's how I see you."<br>
<br>
That's a very classic American literary [thing] — I've been reading John
 Updike lately and I feel like it's in that kind of midcentury novel as 
well. Trying to figure out your place in the lineage. But the songs on 
this record, the political songs, especially working with Tom, who's so 
political, I wonder if you've changed to think about broader identities 
beyond this one focus on your own.<br>
<br>
You know, Tom's very active — much more than I am. And he's just a 
fascinating character. But Steve [Van Zandt], Steve had a whole stretch 
of where he made nothing but political records.<br>
<br>
It's true.<br>
<br>
Now the funny thing is, Steve and I have gone full circle. Steve in the 
'70s, on the Southside records, says, "No politics in music. That's a 
mistake," he says. And then, the guys have often credited our first trip
 to Europe and Steve is often credited as turning him around politically
 because together we went to East Berlin, you know, and this was in 1980
 and it was pretty grim. And Steve has always said that that trip, going
 through Europe in the 1980s, affected him and he then made political 
music for a decade and continues to be very, very active — more than 
myself.<br>
<br>
Recently the death of Nelson Mandela reminded us of what he did, you know.<br>
<br>
And "Sun City." So I've had that around me for a long time, really. I 
had Steve and then of course Tom so it just means we fit well together 
and we find a place where we, you know, have a lot of commonality and we
 draw from that. And I mean Tom suggested "High Hopes" which really kind
 of sits in with a lot of that music. I think he dug out "Hunter of 
Invisible Game," too. I think Brendan had played that for him at some 
point when I wasn't in the studio. You know, Brendan produced Tom also. 
And then, just, those are places where he and I naturally gathered, you 
know.<br>
<br>
And I gather in different places with different members of the band, 
which is why the band is so nice at this point. It's lovely, I have so 
many places to go to. Everybody is underutilized. I have to apologize to
 the guys. I mean, we have four great guitar players. Everybody — really
 with the exception of me — subsumes their ego to the greater whole.<br>
<br>
Soozie [Tyrell] has some great moments on this record.<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah. And Patti, you know Patti's records have been completely, in 
my opinion, completely underrated. If people go back and listen to the 
last record she made, Jesus, I thought that the writing was like Dusty 
in Memphis. You know it was just a lovely, lovely record and great 
singing. And so everybody sort of is, and I have to thank them for it 
because everybody comes out and they work as an ensemble at my service 
and it's a gift that they give me and it's very nice.<br>
<br>
I wanted to ask you also about "Frankie Fell in Love" as a potential 
live highlight, you know, because it's just such a fun song. It's that 
classic, I can just see the crowd rocking to it and everything.<br>
<br>
I'm hoping so, yes.<br>
<br>
Are there songs like that that you know you're gonna bring them into the room and it's gonna become a moment?<br>
<br>
Yeah. And sometimes that doesn't happen.<br>
<br>
Have you been disappointed by [the reaction to] your own songs?<br>
<br>
"This one, people are gonna love this one!" And you go out and you play 
it and it's like, "Eh, OK, that was all right." You're not always right.
 I had some songs that I thought were gonna become part of the body of 
the set and sometimes they did and sometimes they didn't. It didn't mean
 that they weren't great songs. Maybe I didn't present [them correctly].
 And then also songs have lives where they don't truly reveal themselves
 [until] 10 years later.<br>
<br>
Like what? What's one?<br>
<br>
"The Ghost of Tom Joad," [which] suddenly became a really large song on 
our last couple of tours. So the songs reveal themselves at different 
moments and when you maybe have a chance to interpret them better. But 
sometimes you go in and you go, "Oh this one's gonna kill live! I can't 
wait 'til we get out and play this thing live!" And sometimes that 
happens; it doesn't happen all time. Sometimes you get out there and 
you're playing, playing and it's just, you go, "Well."<br>
<br>
You see a dull look in the eyes of the audience?<br>
<br>
Well, it's just, you don't see sort of the explosion you thought was 
gonna occur. But we'll see, you know, so, we'll see what happens.<br>
<br>
The Saints' song that you covered — you were in Australia when you made 
this. So, the Saints. I loved it because I have a friend that has a son 
named Bailey after Chris Bailey. No one ever knows who he's named after.
 I was like, "Yes, you're covering the Saints!" But I also wondered — 
that's a band that's very influenced by Bruce Springsteen. When you 
cover a band who's influenced by you, are you in dialogue with yourself?<br>
<br>
I don't think they were, you know. I mean, they started out as a pretty 
hardcore punk band with "(I'm) Stranded." And then later, they made 
lovely record that "Just Like Fire Would" was on. That never reminded me
 of me, I just thought it was great and I loved that song, you know. So 
but you know, everyone steals from everyone else.<br>
<br>
That's the business.<br>
<br>
And stealing well is, there's a genius to it. And you know, when it's 
done well, I mean, I can hear groups that have been influenced by us but
 they're themselves, you know, who do beautiful work.<br>
<br>
Arcade Fire.<br>
<br>
And Brian, I know Brian Fallon from The Gaslight Anthem, he was a fan 
but he does something, he just manifests something that's completely 
his. I've played with his band onstage a few times and I love doing it. 
It's just wonderful. We played in Asbury Park at Convention Hall one 
night and we did "American Slang" and it was just great. You hear little
 bits of [your music in other songs] but then they take it to another 
place. They take it to a place where you wouldn't have taken it, you 
know. And that's what you hope for. When you're playing, you hope that 
somebody hears your voice, is interested in what you're doing and then 
gathers whatever they think might be of value in it and then moves it 
down the line. And we're all part of sort of that, being a musician is, 
as Patti and I often discuss, it's a wonderful thing. You're a part of a
 long, long line of the continuity and of wonderful things and people 
who've made magic and enlightened people and excited people and changed 
the way people thought, looked, dressed, acted, behaved, thought about 
themselves, thought about their country, thought about their town, 
thought about how they wanna be who they wanna be.<br>
<br>
You know, Against Me! I just heard a song they did, "Black Me Out," it's
 a fantastic song, you know. And so, any time where you feel you may 
have dropped a seed or two that someone picked up in any way is, it's 
just a pleasure. I mean it's like, "Oh yeah, I did that little part of 
my work well," in that this was an assistance and someone went and made 
something beautiful of their own or crazy of their own about it or 
whatever, however it comes out.<br>
<br>
It's that gospel impulse that we were talking about, that connecting, making a line through history.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I mean, you go down, I'm sure you know, the Seeger Sessions Band, I
 could see doing a gospel record with that group of musicians. You know,
 with "O Mary, Don't You Weep," and "Jacob's Ladder."<br>
<br>
I'd love it.<br>
<br>
I'd love to do a project like that at some point. And you know so it, 
you never know where something's gonna go and it comes up in places 
where you least expect it and that's where it's always the most fun. You
 know, it's always quite wonderful.<br>
<br>
[Looks down at his laptop]<br>
<br>
My computer's still working after I crashed it. OK, "Traveling Alone," 
by Jason Isbell. I believe he was a part of the Drive-By Truckers. He's 
got a lovely solo record out himself. There's a gal called, hold on, let
 me see here. I'm gonna plug some people here because I love their 
records.<br>
<br>
I love that Jason Isbell, it's one of my favorite records of the year.<br>
<br>
Slim Dunlap, Slim Dunlap is fantastic. He was a part of The Replacements
 and he made two fabulous rock records that were just really, deeply 
soulful and beautiful.<br>
<br>
I think he had a stroke not long ago.<br>
<br>
Yeah I don't know what his health condition is at the moment but I know 
some folks were cutting some things of his. I hope I get a chance to cut
 one of his songs because he's, it's just, this stuff, check out the two
 Slim Dunlap records because they're just so beautiful, they're just 
beautiful rock 'n' roll records. I found them to be deeply touching and 
emotional. Kristina Train: very Dusty Springfield. There's a song called
 "Dark Black" that's fantastic. I love that. And let me see who else I 
can plug here while I'm rolling.<br>
<br>
Do you like Eric Church? Have you heard his song "Springsteen?"<br>
<br>
Yeah, yeah! My kids thought it was hilarious. "Dad! There's like a song,
 like your name is in it!" And it was a good song, too, so it was nice. 
And I wrote him a letter, I said we all got a kick out of it, you know. 
It was a lovely song. It was fun.<br>
<br>
What's cool about that song is it did use your name but it wasn't like a
 tribute to you. It was just about how they listened to you while they 
made out, you know.<br>
<br>
That's as good as it gets, you know. I mean the verses were really 
lovely, wonderfully done. So you're thinking of a guy in the '80s and 
you're making that music and you know that's what you want, to be the 
music someone's making out to, you know, at least, that's what you hope 
to be.<br>
<br>
Yo La Tengo, "Tears Are In Your Eyes." I just recently discovered that 
and I just kind of recently got into them and they're fantastic.<br>
<br>
They've been indie mainstays. Jersey! They're from Jersey!<br>
<br>
Yeah, I know. Phosphorescent, I like what he does. Bonnie "Prince" Billy, "Gulf Shores." I've got tons of stuff. But anyway.<br>
<br>
How about if you wanna give us any like classic, soul, R&amp;B stuff 
you've been listening to that you love. I mean, I know that we could 
name the expected but can we go off the beaten track?<br>
<br>
Yeah, I'll find something that's a little different. Alright, 8th Day. 
Check out 8th Day. "She's Not Just Another Woman." "You've Got To Crawl 
Before You Walk." I like, of course, I've got, I have a thing here 
somewhere that is ...<br>
<br>
When you listen to blues, do you tend to like like Bobby Bland style 
urban blues? Are you into the country blues? Or is there a mix?<br>
<br>
I like both. Yeah, I like both of those things a lot. It depends on the mood you're in, you know.<br>
<br>
Gene Chandler, "Gonna Be Good Times." "Do I Love You" by Frank Wilson. A great, not-that-well-known soul song.<br>
<br>
What else have I got here?<br>
<br>
I feel that you've become a more soulful singer as you've gotten older.<br>
<br>
I'm still a pretender but I'm getting better at it and my voice has 
actually gotten better. I can sing a little more in tune as I've gotten 
older. I think the older you get, the deeper you slip into some of those
 roots but perhaps you just with age, you gain more in common with 
actually the people who made some of those records. Because 
occasionally, if I get the right song, I can do OK with it. We do this 
song called "Back In Your Arms" — there's a nice version we did on the 
last tour where I'm like, I'm getting pretty close, that sounds pretty 
close.<br>
<br>
I feel like "Girls in Their Summer Clothes" was a song like that too. It had such a classic sound.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, that's just a fun you know, my Spector, pop [song]. That's a 
song I thought people were gonna love, you know. And a lot of people did
 I guess, but it didn't become a very big part of our show. It was one 
of my favorites of recently, you know.<br>
<br>
Yeah, what else you got there, kid? Anything else? Or am I gonna go rehearse?<br>
<br>
Anybody, shout out questions. That's why we're here.<br>
<br>
We talked about gospel, we talked about the band, we talked about the 
religious stuff I wanted to ask you about. You know, I have serious 
questions and I have fun questions, you know. I like the fun questions a
 little better.<br>
<br>
Let's do those.<br>
<br>
"Ride Your Pony," The Fleshtones. A great garage version of "Ride Your Pony." I love that.<br>
<br>
I love The Fleshtones. They're awesome. I mean I guess one thing I'd ask
 you, you've talked about you and Tom having this thing, it's like he's 
inspired you, but I mean a lot of it just seems like you're having fun 
with him and, like, he's an unpredictable performer. What's been the 
most surprising thing, or was there a moment onstage where you were 
like, "Where are we going with this?"<br>
<br>
Yeah. Well, you know, musicians don't call it working; they call it 
playing. There's a reason. You haven't actually worked an honest day in 
your life, you know, or you may play very hard and perform very hard, 
but don't kid yourself. And so it's, and Tom just comes on and yeah 
he'll start and sometimes I don't know where he's going. Jackson Browne 
came backstage and said, "Hey, Tom Morello, that's funny," he says. 
"Well the E Street Band builds a pretty big house when we get out there 
at night." And he says, "Yeah when Tom Morello comes out, he builds 
another room on it." And I think, yeah, that's what he does; he builds 
another room. In other words he just brings things sonically in that we 
haven't had and don't have and those things are surprising. And you know
 he's a visionary guitarist, you know.<br>
<br>
You also let him sing on the record.<br>
<br>
Well, he sings real good. He's got a nice baritone. He's not a tenor, 
he's a baritone voice and when you catch the right thing, he's a 
powerful vocalist. He really, you know, makes it work, you know. So he 
kind of takes the band sonically some place [new]. Really the reason the
 record exists is I had that material. He came along and he kind of 
brought something to it that moved it to another level and made it feel 
like, "Oh yeah, this is current and this is something I'd like my fans 
to hear." It just brought it into a tighter focus and made it very 
exciting.<br>
<br>
Is there something on this record that's sparking the next project for you or are you not in that head space yet?<br>
<br>
Everything is always doing, I have, you know, five or six different 
projects I'm working on. Some of it's archival, some of it's new, some 
of it's kind of in the vein of songs, like on this record, that I've had
 that I'm trying to find a home for. And it depends on what I'm able to 
realize next, you know. Sort of like what we do next depends on what is 
bringing itself to conclusion or fruition. [For] some things I need to 
write some songs. It depends on what comes up as you go. You know, 
things'll happen on this tour. I don't know what's gonna happen yet but 
we may at one point have the entirety of the E Street Band onstage, 
possibly in Africa, which would be fun because that's a mighty unit at 
this point. Now we have an open-door policy where people have other 
lives and do some things.<br>
<br>
Television stars, things like that.<br>
<br>
And that's worked well but we may, we're gonna, we'll see. You never 
know what's really, where it's all gonna go until you get out there.<br>
<br>
And Jake [Clemons] is working out well on the horn?<br>
<br>
Yeah, he came in very gracefully. Took an impossible position and it was
 partly, because he understood what Clarence was, what he meant, what 
those solos meant. And you know, he's who people felt who he was the 
minute he stepped out. He's a very smart but also very soulful young guy
 who makes lovely music of his own but deeply understands the band and 
the stakes that we try to play for. And that was very important because I
 got DVDs by a lot of guys that could play circles around the moon and I
 sat there one morning and Patti was sitting there and I was going, she 
was going, "Nope, nope, nope, nope." It had nothing to do with the 
playing. The guys were playing their asses off, you know. And I knew 
what she was saying. She was saying it somehow has to remain family in 
some way, you know? And particularly I think Clarence would have — he 
mentioned Jake to me a few times and he said, "I have a nephew. He plays
 very well." And he brought Jake with him on tour. [He] didn't play; he 
just kind of hung with Clarence and I think he might have, looking back 
on it now I think he might have had him there — I think it was when 
Clarence wasn't feeling that well. So it was just, we were ... somebody 
up there likes me, that's all I can say.<br>
<br>
Well it's that lineage thing. And I guess this is sort of how I'd like 
to wrap it up, asking sort of a hard question, which is that you have 
said, I think in that Rolling Stone interview you did, in certain recent
 interviews you've given, you keep mentioning this image of the light at
 the end of the tunnel.<br>
<br>
Why would you not.<br>
<br>
Now I have to say, you are one of the more fit performers that I have seen.<br>
<br>
It's like the guys that keel over during the marathon. They're fit, too,
 I'm sure. It's like, hey man, no one knows what tomorrow brings. That 
is the only thing I know. And once you're my age, there's quite a few 
folks missing already, alright? And from 50 on out it only increases as 
time passes by. I lost my two great-aunts this year — my mother lost her
 two sisters — they were our living, breathing connection to the old 
world in Italy and they were a core, you know, it's, I can't explain it.
 It was an enormous loss; they were amazing people. Not to mention 
friends, not to mention people who are struck with really serious and 
often debilitating illness. It's just like you reach a certain part of 
your life and it becomes a part of your life. I lived with Clarence for 
the last decade and he struggled to get along. And Danny also. It's just
 a part of the day and so I always, I use that image as motivation for 
sort of, I'm a bit more interested in working.<br>
<br>
I believe the band's gonna be playing for a great deal longer, all 
right, but not forever anymore, as you felt when you were 32 years old. 
You realize, OK, there's a finiteness. There's a moment now when we go 
to Europe and there's a new group of 16-year-old kids who I know are 
seeing the band for the first time, or people in their mid-30s and 40s 
never saw the band until 2000, who, you know, I've seen at 50 shows 
already. So now when I go and we get these really young kids and we get a
 lot of them overseas, you know, I realize, these kids will have never 
seen the band with Clarence or will have never seen the band with Danny 
and they will outlive us by many, many years, you know, and so tonight 
is our night with them. And so you're playing for an audience who will 
significantly outlive you now which is kind of both wonderful and 
bittersweet and I look forward to doing that a lot longer.<br>
<br>
Leonard Cohen is still going.<br>
<br>
Yeah and he's fantastic.<br>
<br>
Oh my god. He's better than he was. I mean, I count three-hour shows! He might top you in terms of length!<br>
<br>
Yeah, you know. I played with The Stones last year and I had a wonderful
 night and they played great and it was just lovely having them onstage 
and seeing them there. It meant a great deal to me. It's just, it's part
 of the landscape, you know. And it's nice, it gives you a little extra 
motivation. And also my kids have kind of all slightly moved out of the 
house now so you know you have a little bit more time.<br>
<br>
So the rehearsals could go all night long now? You're not keeping the kids up.<br>
<br>
It could if we wanted to. I don't think anybody wants to anymore. And we
 don't need to. But I think that it's like, "Wow, I have all of these 
things I'm interested in." I would like to put something out every year 
at this point. There's no reason [not to]. The first contract I signed, I
 was supposed to put an album out every six months. Those were the days.<br>
<br>
That's how it was, right? I mean, The Beatles.<br>
<br>
An album out every six months. And that's what you were supposed to do! I
 signed, I agreed. And you know the first year I did! And so I would 
certainly like to put a project out a year.<br>
<br>
Do you look at Pearl Jam, bands like that that do a lot of things on the
 Internet. I know you talked to someone about that, bootleg series type 
stuff.<br>
<br>
Yeah, we're looking into doing more of that also. I think I'd like to 
get an archival series going in some way. I'd like to make things more 
available through the Internet. The Internet has become our friend, you 
know. We went to South America — hadn't been to South America in 25 
years — we played for a lot of people. And I guarantee you very few of 
them had ever seen us before but I was shocked by how knowledgeable they
 were about the band. The first night we went into Santiago, Chile, and I
 realized after a few songs: "I got it. The Internet." In other words, 
if you're anywhere today, you're everywhere. There's no such thing as 
having not gone someplace anymore. We sold 40,000 seats like the first 
day in Johannesburg. We've never been there. But you've been there 
somehow, because someone wants to come and see you. So the Internet now 
is something that I'm becoming very interested in and trying to find 
ways of just, you know, getting more music out there. I mean, I'm not 
gonna be, you know I'm not gonna be tweeting. Somebody tweeted — I think
 I have someone that tweets for me, you know — "Real men don't tweet" or
 something. I don't know, something. But someone has tweeted in my name.<br>
<br>
Do you have concerns? Some musicians are concerned about piracy or 
issues around that with the Internet but you seem to be very eager.<br>
<br>
I knew that when the smartest man in the music business that I knew was 
selling headsets, I knew that you were going to have to stop worrying 
about that completely. It's like my buddy, "Jimmy [Iovine], what are you
 gonna do about music?" "I'm gonna sell headsets." You're always 
concerned about it. And look, I think for somebody like me, it's a lot 
less of an issue. I have a friend who didn't have their own label, put 
their records out and if they sold 50,000 of those records it kept them 
in breakfast cereal for a couple of years. And so I think, you know, 
those were the guys that got hurt by the decrease in record sales from 
Internet piracy. And I remain being one of those guys that believes you 
should get paid for your work so I'm old-fashioned in that. And but at 
the same time, it's there and it has many benefits and the idea of, I 
think we live more in a Grateful Dead touring idea that everything you 
do is recorded now. And that's OK with me, you know. As a matter of 
fact, I believe on this tour, we're starting to do something like you 
can come in, you can buy a [wrist]band, you can get a copy of the 
night's show. So hopefully we're gonna do that at a really nice-quality 
level.<br>
<br>
We came from the polar opposite. We started out as being very, very 
controlling. Now it's just a different playing field and so it's 
exciting: We have our little website and we've been throwing some things
 from the last tour. If there was a great performance that night, 
somebody can mix it quickly. We got a guy who directs the show great. 
And suddenly, we caught a version of "New York City Serenade" from Rome 
that I was just so glad we had, you know? It was one of those things 
like it was just a perfect night; we had a string section and the guys 
played it beautifully. And when I saw it, I said, "I'm so glad this 
exists." And it wouldn't exist if we weren't thinking about getting it 
out that way and doing those things. So I'm looking forward to expanding
 and using more of that in the future and hopefully our fans will enjoy 
it and it'll give us another canvas to paint on.<br>
<br>
But there's still nothing like being in the room with you, Bruce Springsteen.<br>
<br>
Well, you know, the nice thing about that is that is something that you 
know any film performance and a recorded performance, there's something 
about a live performance that like when I asked someone, I wanted to go 
see Bob Dylan at Monmouth College in Long Branch, my old neighborhood, I
 just was enjoying being in the room with him. You know, it was just 
fun. I just enjoyed being there. And that's something that's not 
replicable. It's recordable, but not replicable.<br>
<br>
I agree. I feel that way about Aretha. If I can be in the room with Aretha, I'm happy.<br>
<br>
It's nice. I saw Elvis in his very last days when he wasn't doing so 
well. I saw Elvis twice. Once when he was doing great at Madison Square 
Garden, the first time he played in New York and very close, a few weeks
 from the end when he played in Philly. And there were moments of 
brilliance and moments where he wasn't doing that well but occasionally 
something would happen where you'd go, "That's Elvis Presley," you know,
 "and I'm sitting here." And I still remember it, so.<br>
<br>
You've got a rehearsal. Thank you so much, I really appreciate it.<br>
<br>
Thanks, everybody out there. Enjoy the record and we'll see you on the road.</div>

THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD<br>
<br>
<br>
January 21, 2014 <br>
<br>
Bernard Zuel<br>
Senior music writer<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
Not every Bruce Springsteen fan has greeted news of an official concert 
download program with cheers. There have been questions raised about 
price, accessibility and sound quality, particularly when compared with 
other acts doing something similar.<br>
The announcement that Springsteen, one of the most popular artists for 
bootlegs since his early days in the 1970s, would offer official 
downloads of concerts within 48 hours of their performance looked like a
 boon for fans. The process would involve an upfront payment for a USB 
wristband and later downloads of a particular concert, whether or not 
you attended the show.<br>
As someone whose shows regularly change setlists dramatically, not just 
before the concert but mid-show, Springsteen's concerts are the kind of 
experiences fans swap tales and often enough rough recordings of, for 
weeks or months afterwards.<br>
It is this innate appeal, however, which has caused some problems as 
articulated on his blog Stay Hard, Stay Hungry, Stay Alive, by Glenn 
Radecki; a self-described Springsteen researcher, writer and 
statistician and contributing writer for long running fan sites 
Backstreets Magazine and Brucespringsteen.net.<br>
In a strongly worded article that called the plan a “massive blunder”, 
Radecki unfavourably compares the suggested price for the Springsteen 
wristband ($US40 or $A45, with tax and postage on top) with prices for 
acts already offering this service such as Pearl Jam ($10 for MP3 files;
 $15 for the higher quality FLAC format) and Metallica (from $10). He 
argues the cost and availability on as somewhat compromised MP3 files, 
completely misunderstands Springsteen fans.<br>
“Official recordings of live shows is something that Bruce's fanbase has
 been clamouring for years and years,” he wrote. “There are tens of 
thousands of fans who want high-quality recordings of live shows who 
would be buying two or three or five or ten shows each if the price was 
fair and the format useful.<br>
"There are hundreds of fans (and possibly more) who would buy every single show of the tour if he was doing this properly.”<br>
Another Springsteen blogger, Gene Oberto, went further, arguing: “He 
should be offering his shows as a momento to the audience attending and 
as a teaser for audiences to come on FLAC and YouTube gladly.”<br>
And that opinion was echoed by others who described the cost and MP3 delivery as “greedy”.<br>
Not surprisingly the view is not universally shared, with one fan, Shawn Poole, arguing the alternatives don't compare.<br>
“$40 flat (or even $40 + shipping) for a professionally recorded/mixed 
version of one of Springsteen's legendary shows, even in mp3 format, 
remains a major bargain when compared to what many folks have been 
willing to pay over the years for often-crappy bootlegs,” he wrote.<br>
A fan only identified as Johhny B-Good reversed the accusations of 
greediness and suggested those complaining recognise the thought behind 
the initiative.<br>
“Instead you want everything according to 'what the mighty fan base 
wants and think is fair,” he wrote. “Wake up people! This is business 
and it has been way too long since this music was only for the 
working-class people. You think the wristband is too expensive? Then 
just don't buy it.<br>
"Oh, but you really, really want it? Then download it from any pirate site. Believe me, it doesn't make you any less of a fan.”</div>

January 27, 2014, 4:11 am<br>
/Mike Hutchings<br>
CAPE TOWN (Reuters) -</strong><br>
<br>
Rising income inequality in the United States and South Africa threatens
 to tear their societies apart, rocker Bruce Springsteen said on Sunday 
before his first performance in Africa for almost three decades.<br>
<br>
Riding high on the global charts with his latest album "High Hopes", the
 musician stayed true to his New Jersey working class roots and socially
 conscious lyrics when answering media questions.<br>
<br>
"There is a tremendous problem with income inequality in the States 
right now and it's been increasing and increasing," Springsteen said a 
few hours before his opening night performance in South Africa's tourist
 capital Cape Town.<br>
<br>
"Initially it tears society apart and I don't think society can make 
good when economic differences and economic inequalities are so 
widespread. It is a real problem in the United States and a big problem 
here too," he said.<br>
<br>
A journalist had asked him whether things had got worse since 1988 when 
Springsteen famously compared "the systematic apartheid of South Africa"
 to "the economic apartheid of my own country," during an appearance in 
neighbouring Zimbabwe.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and the E Street Band will play three concerts in Cape Town 
and another one in Johannesburg, before flying on to Australia and New 
Zealand on February 2.<br>
<br>
It is their first concerts in South Africa since his guitarist Steven 
van Zandt led a campaign by rock musicians in protest against apartheid 
nearly thirty years ago.<br>
<br>
Springsteen played in neighbouring Zimbabwe and the Ivory Coast in 1988 
as part of the Amnesty International human rights concert series, and he
 said it was "special" to eventually be in South Africa.<br>
<br>
"It is really incredible and special to be here," he said.<br>
<br>
One of his fans, waiting since 10 a.m. outside the concert venue about 
30 km (20 miles) north of Cape Town, said they had been waiting for 
years for this performance.<br>
<br>
"I love his music, he is left of the government," Nico Blignaut said of 
the gravelly-voiced singer, known to a legion of fans as "The Boss".<br>
<br>
His latest album debuted on top of the Billboard 200 album chart in the United States and also took top spot in Britain.<br>
<br>
The album "High Hopes" is a follow-up to his 2012 album "Wrecking Ball",
 which also debuted at number one, and sees his regular band joined by 
Rage Against The Machine guitarist Tom Morello.<br>
<br>
"I don't want to spend years sitting around trying to come up with the 
perfect ten songs ... We want to play, we want to get out there and play
 for people," said Springsteen.</div>
