Sunday July 14, 2013<br>
BY ERIK KIRSCHBAUM<br>
The  Bergen Record</strong><br>
<br>
Erik Kirschbaum, a native of New York City and long-time Springsteen 
fan, has lived in Germany for 25 years as a Reuters correspondent. 
“Rocking the Wall, Bruce Springsteen: The Berlin Concert That Changed 
The World” is his third book.<br>
Bruce Springsteen and Patty Scialfa in performance before 150,000 fans at East Berlin's Weissensee cycling track, July 19, 1988.<br>
AP<br>
<br>
TWENTY-FIVE years ago, Bruce Springsteen was on a stage in Communist 
East Berlin, playing a concert in front of 300,000 East Germans, when he
 pulled a crumpled note out of his pocket and delivered one of the most 
powerful – and most underrated – appeals for freedom made during the 
Cold War.<br>
<br>
On that warm summer evening of July 19, 1988, Springsteen had already 
been playing for more than an hour to an audience fed up with the 
Stalinist government and its aversion to reforms. He was upset that the 
local East Berlin organizers tried to put a Communist spin on his 
concert by labeling it as a benefit for Nicaragua.<br>
<br>
He stepped up to the microphone and told the crowd why he came to East 
Berlin: “I’m not here for or against any government,” Springsteen said, 
speaking in German. “I’ve come to play rock-and-roll for you in the hope
 that one day all the barriers will be torn down.”<br>
<br>
The crowd roared its approval. They had never heard anyone say anything 
like that before – an American rock star coming into their isolated 
country and telling them he was playing this concert, the biggest in 
their country’s history, for them in the hope the loathed Berlin Wall 
could be torn down. To ensure that message got to those on the fringes 
of the grounds, spread out over a meadow the size of 50 football fields,
 Springsteen rammed the point home by following his stirring anti-Wall 
speech with “Chimes of Freedom.”<br>
<br>
It was an unforgettable moment in East German history. Almost everyone 
between the ages of 18 to 45 saw the concert live, watched it on a 
delayed TV broadcast, heard about it or read about it. That generation 
still raves about it today.<br>
<br>
Yet was Springsteen’s appearance in East Berlin and his call for freedom possibly more than just another rock concert?<br>
<br>
Was Springsteen a catalyst for the tremendous change that swept East 
Germany over the ensuing 16 months that led to the fall of the Berlin 
Wall in November 1989? Did that magical four-hour concert do more to 
shake the Communist country than anyone has until now realized or 
understood? Looking at the end of the Cold War from today’s perspective,
 does Springsteen deserve some recognition?<br>
<br>
I’ve spent two years talking to people who were at that concert as well 
as experts on East Germany for my book about that concert. It is about 
that extraordinary day when ordinary life in East Germany came to a 
standstill. Those who witnessed the concert still have a glow in their 
eye about it and scholars agree that Communist East Germany was a 
different place after Springsteen unwittingly helped fuel a rebellion.<br>
<br>
“It sent a strong message to people all over East Germany,” said Jochen 
Staadt, an expert on East German history at Berlin’s Free University who
 was astonished at the size and enthusiasm of the crowd. “It was amazing
 that the East German regime had let all that happen.”<br>
<br>
Changed the course of history<br>
<br>
Craig Werner, a professor of music and cultural history at the 
University of Wisconsin, believes the concert helped change the course 
of history. “Music can play a significant role in supporting a movement 
that is already there. And East Berlin in 1988 was exactly the kind of 
place where music could support and inspire people who are active or 
potentially active. Springsteen’s concert by itself didn’t cause the 
Berlin Wall to fall. But it was a significant piece of the mix.”<br>
<br>
East Germany and its FDJ youth organization were worried they were 
losing an entire generation and took a gamble by allowing Springsteen in
 with the hope that could improve sentiment.<br>
<br>
That strategy of “one step backwards, two steps forwards” backfired and 
the concert only made East Germans hungrier for more of the freedoms 
that Springsteen epitomized. That he also had the moxie to speak out 
against the Berlin Wall while standing in the middle of East Berlin – 
arguably a more courageous act than what John F. Kennedy or Ronald 
Reagan did with their famous speeches from the safety of West Berlin — 
added to the euphoria.<br>
<br>
‘Hope for a change’<br>
<br>
“You couldn’t be at that show and not feel that hope for a change,” said
 Jon Landau, Springsteen’s manager. “The effect that the speech and then
 the song ‘Chimes of Freedom’ had on the audience was spectacular. It 
was a moment none of us will ever forget. Bruce walked off the stage 
after the concert, and we said — you know, just personally to each other
 — that we had a feeling a big change was coming in East Germany. We 
both sort of felt the system, these people in the crowd, our audience, 
they were just busting out. They were just ready for change.”<br>
<br>
Whether Springsteen deserves belated credit for helping end the Cold War
 depends to a certain extent on whether you believe in the power of 
rock-and-roll. But what is beyond doubt is that Springsteen’s 1988 
concert is a glorious example of the influence that rock can have on 
people who are hungry and ready for change.</div>

The Hot Press<br>
July 17, 2013<br>
Stuart Clark </strong><br>
<br>
 Pink and Bob Dylan have both passed through recently – the effervescent
 former giving decidedly more bang for buck than the cantankerous latter
 – but Bruce &amp; The E Street Band’s maiden voyage to Limerick is by 
far and away the biggest night in the city’s rock ‘n’ roll history.<br>
To help celebrate having a star of Springsteen’s magnitude in their 
midst Judge Eugene O’Kelly has very kindly agreed to a 2am bar 
exemption, which along with the landscaped garden and yoga centre that’s
 been built for Bruce on the Thomond Park training-pitch is front-page 
Limerick Leader news.<br>
<br>
The atmosphere walking up to the stadium is even more electric than it 
is on Munster Heineken Cup matchdays – and just as sporting with Mick 
Galway, Peadar ‘The Claw’ Clohessy and the Keiths, Earl and Woods, among
 those gleefully skipping towards the turnstiles.<br>
<br>
I’m still savouring the delights of Limerick Junction when it happens – 
no offence, but it has to be the most godforsaken non-place in the world
 – but at 6.20pm Bruce saunters on unannounced for a three song acoustic
 pre-show comprising Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.’s ‘Does This Bus 
Stop At 82nd Street’ and ‘For You’ and a first solo outing for his take 
on Southside Johnny’s ‘Hearts Of Stone’.<br>
<br>
Memo to self: next time mitch off work earlier!<br>
<br>
When he returns to the stage an hour and seven minutes later its with 
the E Street Band in tow and the declaration that, “We are here to fill 
you with the everlasting power of rock ‘n’ roll!”<br>
<br>
And so it proves over the course of a set, which, like in the RDS last 
year, is as much spiritual revival meeting as it is conventional rock 
gig.<br>
<br>
‘This Little Light Of Mine’, Pete Seeger’s ‘American Land’, ‘Badlands’, 
‘Death To My Hometown’ and ‘Hungry Heart’, during which Bruce downs a 
proferred pint from the pit in one, all make an early appearance.<br>
<br>
“I think I earned my Irish passport!” Mr. S shouts, referring to both 
his drinking prowess and the giant mock passport bearing a photo of him 
in his hirsute Darkness On The Edge Of Town days that’s been presented 
to him by another front-of-stage admirer.<br>
<br>
It’s back into Baptist preacher mode for a super soulful ‘Spirit In The 
Night’, which features the first junior Boss fan singalong of the night.<br>
<br>
Bruce’s examination of the sea of signs bearing song suggestions yields a
 down ‘n’ dirty cover of The Temptations’ ‘Ain’t Too Proud To Beg’ and 
an emotionally-charged ‘American Skin (41 Shots)’ which he prefaces by 
saying: “I want to send this one out as a letter back home. For justice 
for Trayvon Martin.” Let’s hope the message got to Florida.<br>
<br>
It’s followed by a deliciously plaintive ‘The Promised Land’, the new 
album triple-whammy of ‘Wrecking Ball’, ‘We Take Care Of Our Own’ and 
‘Jack Of All Trades’ and a version of ‘The River’ notable for 1). The 
bonkers crowd reaction and 2). The purity of its author’s age-defying 
falsetto.<br>
<br>
Springsteen has taken on this tour to playing one of his classic albums 
in its entirety, with the nod tonight going to Born To Run, which 
includes the obligatory – and still moving – ‘Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out’ 
tribute to The Big Man who’d be proud of the storm his nephew Jake blows
 up during it.<br>
<br>
His ‘70s masterpiece dispatched with due pomp and ceremony, Bruce 
touchingly dedicates ‘My Hometown’ to the Limerick jockey, JT McNamara, 
paralysed in March by a fall and makes sure there will forever be a seat
 for him in the Gaelic Grounds VIP box by congratulating the county’s 
hurlers on last weekend’s Munster Final smiting of Cork.<br>
<br>
“We don’t know what the fuck that is, but congratulations!” Bruce wisecracks to rapturous cheers.<br>
<br>
The sprint to the finish includes the reclaimed from the right ‘Born In 
The USA’, ‘Glory Days’, ‘Bobby Jean’, ‘Drive All Night’, ‘Dancing In The
 Dark’ and a set-closing ‘Shout’, which is the cue for mass E Street 
Band ass-wiggling.<br>
<br>
“That was the greatest night of my life!” bellows the owner of a 
seriously impressive beer belly to my right. I imagine he speaks for 
pretty much all of the 40,000 people jammed into Thomond who've 
witnessed another Broooooce humdinger.</div>

<br>
 LIMERICK<br>
It was an auspicious and glorious night for Bruce and the band’s first 
return to Ireland since two shows at RDS Stadium in Dublin a year ago, 
and their first ever show in Limerick. Prior to taking the stage with 
the mighty men and women of the E Street Band, Horns, and Choir, Bruce 
delighted the early arrivals to the show this evening with a three song 
acoustic pre-show consisting of “Does This Bus Stop on 82nd Street?”, 
followed by “For You” on the piano, and then a stunning, rarely played 
“Hearts of Stone.” The crowd went wild, and he was clearly in fine form 
and ready to rock the house.<br>
To say that the audience’s excitement was at a fever pitch would be 
putting it mildly. And the show was stellar tonight – exuberant and 
joyful in part, somber and reflective in part, deeply emotional on all 
counts. Early on, Bruce acknowledged to the capacity crowd of over 
40,000 under the blue sunny skies that it was their very first time in 
the city of Limerick. Also, for what I believe to be the first time in 
Springsteen’s entire career, he opened and closed with the same number, 
the portentous and venerable Civil Rights anthem popularized by Fannie 
Lou Hamer in the 1950’s, “This Little Light of Mine.” Cindy Mizelle 
soared on this, taking the whole audience up to a higher power, 
connecting us all to whatever essence you believe to be that which the 
universe turns on. It set the tone right away for an unforgettable 
evening, as much a rock and roll concert as a gospel tent revival.<br>
“LIMERICK! LIMERICK! LIMERICK!” Bruce greeted the crowd. “We’re so glad 
to be here with you tonight. We are here to fill you with the 
everlasting power of rock and roll!” The band roared into the entirely 
appropriate neo-Irish classic “American Land” from the Seeger Sessions 
album, which was anthemic to this audience. As far as the eye could see,
 there was dancing, stomping, jumping and singing along. Soozie Tyrell’s
 fiddle on this was perfection.<br>
A passionate “Badlands” followed, taking the show into the stratosphere 
early in the set. This was bookended by “Death To My Hometown,” which 
also sounded particularly passionate this evening. Clearly the band was 
on fire, feeding off the crowd’s Irish energy. This song always 
simultaneously chills and thrills me in its power, especially the ending
 with the front line framed by Jake and Everett drumming.<br>
“Hungry Heart” was next, as Bruce urged, “Come on Limerick!” and ran 
back and forth across the stage, gladhanding those in the front. At the 
end of the song he accepted a beer and was shown on the big screen 
chugging the entire thing down in one swallow. “I drank that beer and I 
think I earned my Irish passport!” he exclaimed, delighted, showing the 
audience a beautifully made sign he had been handed that had been 
fashioned to look like  a real Irish passport with his name, birthdate, 
and photo. This took up residence at the drum stand so all could see it.
 “That was a nice cold Irish beer. I’m fully loose now!”<br>
Preceding the magnificent spooky love story of “Spirit in the Night,” 
Bruce went into full-on gospel preacher mode: “We are here tonight 
because WE NEED YOU! WE NEED YOU! WE NEED YOU! We need the Irish on our 
side tonight. We can’t do it alone!” At the close of “Spirit” he 
canvassed the crowd for signs, of which there were many. This yielded a 
large number of comments on his behalf, from “we don’t know that one” to
 “we just did that one” to “we could probably do that one” and so on. 
One sign read “Bruce O’Hagan,” prompting Bruce to explore his Irish 
roots. “That’s right, I come from the O’Hagans. We were McNicholas and 
O’Hagans.”<br>
The sign collection prompted a rarely played cover nugget from club 
days, the Temptations’ classic “Ain’t Too Proud to Beg,” which could not
 have been anticipated let alone rehearsed yet was smokin’ hot and spot 
on, showing yet again the elasticity and brilliance of this band.<br>
During the sign collecting Bruce had noticed another sign on the side of
 the stage and asked for it to be passed up to him, then displayed it 
for the crowd. It was “American Skin (41 Shots).” An immediate hush 
settled as we all recognized the significance of this request on the 
heels of the Travyon Martin trial verdict just days before. “We’ll send 
this as a letter back home for justice for Trayvon Martin,” Bruce said 
before launching into what was surely the emotional centerpiece of the 
show.  The audience and the band both appeared to be choked with tears 
at points in the song; rarely had the lyric “You can get killed just for
 living in your American skin” sounded more tragic or true. As it wound 
to its end and Bruce stood alone at the mike staring straight ahead with
 as much tension and anger as I’ve ever seen him display during a song, 
just chanting “you can get killed just for living in…” over and over, it
 was a moment never to be forgotten and a beautiful tribute to a young 
life sadly wasted for no good reason.<br>
As we were still wiping our tears, the mood took an upswing next with 
“Promised Land,” followed by “Wrecking Ball” and “We Take Care of Our 
Own.” This trifecta was followed by the soulful ballad “Jack of All 
Trades” which always strikes deep especially with the ending 
spotlighting Nils on guitar, Curt on trumpet, and Bruce solemnly hitting
 the bass drum. The crowd went ecstatic when the next song was “The 
River.”<br>
Many concerts would have been over now, but clearly this one was only 
just getting started. A masterful live reading of the entire “Born to 
Run” record in album sequence order followed. One of the highlights here
 was the rarely played long Sam Cooke-flavored soul wrenching outro to 
“Backstreets,” a true treat for the Irish fans: “Just me and you 
darling…Just you and those sad eyes…You and the lonely sad eyes…I get 
lost in your lonely sad eyes…” Other highlights: being magically 
transported to the inner city streets of “Meeting Across the River” by 
Curt’s trumpet solo; Soozie’s graceful violin intro to the anthemic 
“Jungleland” greeted with pure rapture by the audience; 40,000 plus 
Irish voices raised in the chorus “Down in Jungleland” during that 
mythic tale of the wounded, not even dead.<br>
“Waiting on a Sunny Day” this night featured young Ross, aged 12, as a 
sign pointed out it was his birthday and what a way to celebrate – a 
birthday Ross will never forget! This was followed by “The Rising,” 
seamlessly continuing the gospel feel of the entire show, rousing us all
 to come on up. “Land of Hope and Dreams” closed out the main set and 
the band took their bows. But Bruce, of course, was nowhere near 
finished breaking our hearts and making us dance.<br>
The encores kicked off with “My Hometown,” which Bruce dedicated to 
local jockey JT McNamara, who had been seriously injured in a fall 
earlier this year. Only Bruce Springsteen can make a sold out stadium 
feel like a small room of people singing and swaying as he did with this
 number.<br>
The epic “Born in the USA” was next, its power shaking the skies. Time 
then for some major silliness as Bruce and Steven went to the center 
front platform and sang “Glory Days” posing in crazy hats, which Steven 
kept on for the whole song and later tried to hand off to Garry. 
Acknowledging the recent historic win by the Limerick hurling team, the 
song was dedicated to them.<br>
The mood was up, up, up as “Bobby Jean” came next, and then Bruce 
smiled. “I got a promise I gotta keep,” he said, before going into a 
riveting version of “Drive All Night,” a ballad perhaps all the more 
loved for how rarely it is seen. In a word, it was sublime.<br>
Ratcheting up the energy again Bruce blasted into “Dancing in the Dark,”
 choosing as his dance partner a beautiful young brunette girl who was 
celebrating her sweet sixteen that night. But finished? Surely you jest!
 The rousing barn burner “Shout” was played in an absolutely James 
Brownian frenzy, with the crowd following Bruce’s stage directions to 
bring it louder now, then softer now. At one point he slid all the way 
down to the floor, rolled over and wiggled his legs in the air. “I’m 
just a prisoner,” he screamed at song’s end, “of rock and roll!” To 
which I can only say show us the cell keys, jailer, and lock us all in.<br>
This extraordinary night roared to its conclusion with a reprise of 
“This Little Light of Mine,” complete with Steven doing the James Brown 
cape routine on Bruce, and gorgeous gospel churchiness, raising a joyful
 and beautiful noise unto the Lord. The reprise framed this very special
 and emotional show perfectly as a marriage of gospel, rock and soul.  
Exhausted? Hell no. We all headed out into the night thrilled to think 
what awaits us down the road as the merry E Street caravan rolls through
 the Emerald Isle.<br>

NOTES FROM THE ROAD:WERCHTER</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce and the E Street Band traveled to Werchter in Belgium to play at 
the TW Classic in front of a festival crowd of 60,000, their first 
concert in the country since 2008. The atmosphere was lively due to the 
beautiful weather and build-up of live bands throughout the afternoon 
and evening. So by the time Bruce and the band took the stage at quarter
 to ten, fans were in particularly high spirits. The set kicked off with
 “Spirit in the Night”: Bruce delayed his entrance and allowed the band 
to go on first while he preached to the crowd from backstage. Naturally,
 fans went crazy when he finally emerged. Next we had “Badlands,” 
getting spirits even higher.<br>
When it came time for requests, Bruce chose two signs that were mounted 
on large stuffed animals: one (on a teddy bear) for a cover of Elvis’ 
“Jailhouse Rock,” and another (on a duck) for Bruce’s own “Man’s Job.” 
The first allowed for the horn section to show their stuff, and for Roy 
to get a rocking solo on the keys, while the second brought vocalist 
Curtis King downstage for a rare turn in the spotlight. The real 
highlight of the concert came after these first two requests, when Bruce
 was joined by Ben Harper (who played earlier in the festival) for 
“Atlantic City.” Some might have expected this, as the blues-rock singer
 had covered the Nebraska song recently himself. Harper’s involvement 
prompted a slower version of the track, on which he and Bruce shared 
vocals — very powerful.<br>
  The remainder of the main set of this somewhat abbreviated festival 
show featured a number of tracks from Wrecking Ball mixed with fan 
favorites such as “The River,” “Hungry Heart,” and “Waitin’ on a Sunny 
Day.” Steve and Nils offered some guitar masterclasses with solos in 
“Youngstown” and “Murder Incorporated.<br>
  ”  The second major highlight of the show was at the beginning of the 
encore when Bruce granted a third request, another Elvis Presley cover. 
This time there was no sign; Bruce explained that a woman had written to
 him asking for “Follow That Dream,” the Elvis song Bruce had changed a 
bit and adopted to make his own. She said it was a song she heard when 
she first saw him perform 25 years ago; incidentally, the song was the 
first that Bruce had ever played in Belgium, in Brussels on The River 
tour in 1981, making this moment even more special.<br>
  The remainder of the encore included songs from the Born to Run and 
Born in the U.S.A albums before completing the E Street segment with 
covers of “Twist and Shout” and “Shout” without a break. The fans 
couldn’t stop dancing until Bruce returned for a final acoustic “Thunder
 Road.” The mood amongst the Belgian fans as they left was ecstatic; 
many were clearly blown away by the experience.<br>

NOTES FROM THE ROAD: ROME</strong><br>
<br>
“Can you feel the spirit?” Bruce sings in falsetto, still hiding himself
 behind the stage while the organ notes of “Spirit in the Night” 
suddenly turn the vast Roman hippodrome into the Main Point, Max’s 
Kansas City, or one of those other clubs where the E Street Band used to
 stir the crowd into rapture back in 1973. That July, Springsteen was a 
promising singer-songwriter wrestling with the recording of his second 
album, The Wild, The Innocent &amp; The E Street Shuffle. 40 years have 
passed, but he’s still that visionary artist, always in search of 
perfection: in fact, he rehearsed for two days in a small club in Rome 
to prepare the biggest surprise of the tour so far. But I’m getting 
ahead of myself…<br>
After “Spirit in the Night,” the one-two punch of “My Love Will Not Let 
You Down” and “Badlands” was just the warm-up for an energetic first 
part of the show, with “Roulette,” “Lucky Town,” and a trio of rock ’n’ 
rollers, “Summertime Blues,” “Stand on It,” and “Working on the 
Highway,” all played by request. Then Bruce let the crowd choose between
 two signs, “Candy’s Room” and “Brilliant Disguise,” but he ended up 
playing both of them, with a stunning “She’s the One” in the middle.<br>
Already a great, great show. But then… “Kitty’s Back,” the first one of 
2013, and for 15 minutes we were all back to 1973 again. And, wait a 
minute… What’s next? Is it really “Incident on 57th Street?” Yes it is, 
and when Bruce’s own West Side Story is about to end with Roy’s 
carillon-like outro on the piano, almost everybody in the field starts 
to dream about “Rosalita,” as it is next in sequence on The Wild, the 
Innocent &amp; The E Street Shuffle. Boom! Delivered! This show is 
becoming a real event. Now, don’t tell me that the sequence will go on 
with “New York City Serenade”…<br>
It did. The fourth performance of “New York City Serenade” of the 21st 
Century, obviously a tour premiere, broke the hearts of all 35,000 
gathered in the Eternal City. I’ve never heard this song played so well:
 for the piano intro Roy followed the score, coloring the jazzy original
 of David Sancious with his romantic touch, and a string section from 
the Roma Sinfonietta (Morricone’s orchestra) helped the band wrap up 
this unforgettable present that Bruce wanted to give to his Italian 
fans. Some magic happened when he was singing “hook up to the night 
train” and a night train actually crossed the railway at the right-hand 
side of the hippodrome—a real surprise!<br>
The rest of the setlist was standard, with “Land of Hope and Dreams” 
closing the main set and “Born in the U.S.A.” and “Born to Run” opening 
the encores. For “Dancing in the Dark” Bruce invited on stage a girl 
holding a big sign: “If you dance with me, he will marry me,” Bruce 
hauled her boyfriend up, too, forcing him to kneel down and make the 
promise. “Twist and Shout” and “Shout” followed “Tenth Avenue 
Freeze-out,” and a moving “Thunder Road” played acoustic by Bruce ended 
the best show of the Wrecking Ball Tour.<br>
Did we feel the spirit? You bet your life.<br>

NOTES FROM THE ROAD: LEIPZIG</strong><br>
<br>
On this bright and clear sunny Sunday afternoon, we wondered how the 
band might be able to top Friday’s fun and loose performance in 
Mönchengladbach. But this Leipzig show in a “mighty arena,” as Bruce put
 it, turned out to be even stronger. Two tour premieres offered a 
powerful start, with a top-notch, energetic “Roulette” to open (a River 
outtake once released as the flip-side of “One Step Up” that later found
 its way to the Tracks collection) followed by a rousing E Street 
version of “Lucky Town.” Strong guitar work from Bruce and Steve on this
 underplayed 1992 track, Bruce’s driving solo way up front and shining 
with passion and sheer energy.<br>
After “Badlands” and “Death to My Hometown,” it was time for requests. 
Getting back to party mode, “Sherry Darling” got the crowd dancing and 
singing, with Jake Clemons and Ed Manion sharing sax parts and bringing 
the song to a new level. This could only be topped by an unexpected 
request, the Chuck Berry classic “You Never Can Tell.” It was a 
fascinating moment, with Bruce and the band actually arranging the song 
in front of thousands of people. Bruce sought the right key by 
increasing pitch step-by-step, Steve shaking his head in disapproval 
each time until they were satisfied that it felt right. Then the brass 
section had to be taught how to play the song, and Bruce sang them their
 line, encouraging the crowd to join in and repeat it a few times so 
that the horns could get accommodated to a song that they had never 
played before. In the end, they nailed it — an exuberant performance 
creating an enormous response from the crowd.<br>
Yet another request brought us “Back in Your Arms,” introduced with a 
great story about pleading for a second chance, Bruce down on his knees,
 before the band’s subtle accompaniment supported the most passionate 
and skillful vocal I’ve ever heard on this song. Bruce clearly enjoyed 
the freedom to vary the phrasing of the words to make this rendition a 
true masterpiece.<br>
During “Hungry Heart,” Bruce downed a “good German beer” as Jake 
continued his sax part until the cup was fully emptied. Later in the 
set, an unusual (particularly without Patti Scialfa present) but clearly
 convincing “Human Touch” provided Soozie Tyrell the chance to shine, 
taking Patti’s part and proving her vocal and guitar skills. On a strong
 “Open All Night,” the camera guys located a woman in the far back of 
the arena who was dancing passionately to Bruce’s amusement; she never 
realized that she was on the enormous screen until the very last note of
 the song, even though Bruce repeatedly greeted her and referred to her 
as his “baby.”<br>
A mighty “Born in the U.S.A.” was dedicated to those “old enough to have
 seen one of the most memorable concerts ever,” referring to the 
legendary concert in East Berlin in 1988 that, according to recently 
published literature, could have been one of the events that helped the 
Berlin Wall to come down. Bruce recalled that the E Street Band most 
probably has never played to more people than in Berlin Weissensee, and 
that the memory would stay in their hearts forever.<br>
“Rockin’ All Over the World” closed the dancing part of this great 
night, but Bruce did lot leave the Red Bull Arena without a beautiful 
acoustic performance of “Thunder Road,” with the crowd taking the part 
of the sax solo. Another night that will stay in our memory for a long 
time. And taking Bruce at his word, the E Street Band isn’t nearly done 
making memories. Introducing to “Spirit in the Night,” Bruce told the 
crowd that they’ve been on the road for two years now, but there is no 
end in sight: “We are just startin’ to get good!”<br>

Notes From The Road: Rome</strong><br>
				 <br>
“Can you feel the spirit?” Bruce sings in falsetto, still hiding himself
 behind the stage while the organ notes of “Spirit in the Night” 
suddenly turn the vast Roman hippodrome into the Main Point, Max’s 
Kansas City, or one of those other clubs where the E Street Band used to
 stir the crowd into rapture back in 1973. That July, Springsteen was a 
promising singer-songwriter wrestling with the recording of his second 
album, The Wild, The Innocent &amp; The E Street Shuffle. 40 years have 
passed, but he’s still that visionary artist, always in search of 
perfection: in fact, he rehearsed for two days in a small club in Rome 
to prepare the biggest surprise of the tour so far. But I’m getting 
ahead of myself…<br>
After “Spirit in the Night,” the one-two punch of “My Love Will Not Let 
You Down” and “Badlands” was just the warm-up for an energetic first 
part of the show, with “Roulette,” “Lucky Town,” and a trio of rock ’n’ 
rollers, “Summertime Blues,” “Stand on It,” and “Working on the 
Highway,” all played by request. Then Bruce let the crowd choose between
 two signs, “Candy’s Room” and “Brilliant Disguise,” but he ended up 
playing both of them, with a stunning “She’s the One” in the middle.<br>
Already a great, great show. But then… “Kitty’s Back,” the first one of 
2013, and for 15 minutes we were all back to 1973 again. And, wait a 
minute… What’s next? Is it really “Incident on 57th Street?” Yes it is, 
and when Bruce’s own West Side Story is about to end with Roy’s 
carillon-like outro on the piano, almost everybody in the field starts 
to dream about “Rosalita,” as it is next in sequence on The Wild, the 
Innocent &amp; The E Street Shuffle. Boom! Delivered! This show is 
becoming a real event. Now, don’t tell me that the sequence will go on 
with “New York City Serenade”…<br>
It did. The fourth performance of “New York City Serenade” of the 21st 
Century, obviously a tour premiere, broke the hearts of all 35,000 
gathered in the Eternal City. I’ve never heard this song played so well:
 for the piano intro Roy followed the score, coloring the jazzy original
 of David Sancious with his romantic touch, and a string section from 
the Roma Sinfonietta (Morricone’s orchestra) helped the band wrap up 
this unforgettable present that Bruce wanted to give to his Italian 
fans. Some magic happened when he was singing “hook up to the night 
train” and a night train actually crossed the railway at the right-hand 
side of the hippodrome—a real surprise!<br>
The rest of the setlist was standard, with “Land of Hope and Dreams” 
closing the main set and “Born in the U.S.A.” and “Born to Run” opening 
the encores. For “Dancing in the Dark” Bruce invited on stage a girl 
holding a big sign: “If you dance with me, he will marry me,” Bruce 
hauled her boyfriend up, too, forcing him to kneel down and make the 
promise. “Twist and Shout” and “Shout” followed “Tenth Avenue 
Freeze-out,” and a moving “Thunder Road” played acoustic by Bruce ended 
the best show of the Wrecking Ball Tour.<br>
Did we feel the spirit? You bet your life.<br>

Notes From The Road: Mönchengladbach</strong><br>
		<br>
		 <br>
Fighting through traffic for hours in the rural countryside surrounding 
Borussia Park in Mönchengladbach, Germany and bursting through the doors
 just in time to hear the closing chords of “Jackson Cage” is one way to
 begin a show with a pounding heart.  Bruce did his part to maintain the
 energy of the show’s start with rousing versions of “My Love Will Not 
Let You down” and “Better Days.”<br>
It would become a night of requests. After jokingly accusing the fans of
 trying to stump the E Street Band, Bruce and company delivered the 
rocking tour premieres of “Shake, Rattle, and Roll” and  “One Way 
Street,” the latter a special request from Little Steven.  Bruce was 
ready to collect on a wager after putting “ten Euros on the E Street 
Band” before “Mary’s Place.” He thanked the crowd for the help with song
 selection, saying he “didn’t know what we were going to play tonight” 
before settling into a familiar trio of “Wrecking Ball,” “Badlands,” and
 “Death to My Hometown.”<br>
Roy showed off his skills during a heartbreaking intro to “Point Blank” 
while Bruce was fishing for a sign for later use.  After Little Steven’s
 haunting guitar solo to close out the song, Bruce flipped the sign for 
“Trapped” that he had stashed away. The crowd joined in, sending echoes 
through the stadium. Jake’s solo brought back memories of Clarence up on
 stage, mesmerizing the crowd. A long guitar intro led into “The 
Promised Land,” after which Bruce spotted a fan with a sign indicating 
that it was his 35th show and left him with a hug and a harmonica.<br>
Bruce started desperately asking, “Where’s that German beer?” He let the
 crowd have the first verse of “Hungry Heart,” finishing his beer and 
carrying on, saying he was “high as a kite.”  Curtis King was called to 
the spotlight for “Man’s Job,” another premiere, during which he was 
cornered by Cindy Mizelle and Michelle Moore in a battle of vocals.  
After the E Street Choir had its fun, the guitars came out to play for 
“Because the Night” and “Candy’s Room.”  Nils’ signature solo during 
“Because the Night” impressed as always, sending the crowd into an 
uproar as he started dancing and spinning.  After hopping on the piano 
for “She’s the One,” Bruce urged the band to “follow me” as he took a 
“Leap of Faith,” punctuated by an extended outro.<br>
“Come on Silvio,” Bruce called before blasting into “Rosie” and forcing 
the German crowd onto their feet and into dance.  The band was joined by
 “Germany’s own, incredible Little Stevens!”: three women in bandanas 
who danced with Steve and wiped Bruce’s sweaty brow with sponges.  The 
real Little Steven even showed subtle signs of joining the band’s 
two-step to close “Shackled and Drawn.”<br>
Crowd favorite “Waitin’ on a Sunny Day” featured an impressive young 
volunteer who never missed a beat in leading the crowd in a sing-along 
and cueing Jake’s solo.  “Sitting in for his dad” on “Radio Nowhere” was
 Jay Weinberg, who brought all of the energy and hair-flailing that we 
remember from the Working on a Dream Tour.  A full-band “Thunder Road” 
featuring accentuated piano and violin for the opening verse, closed out
 the main set.<br>
The sun was finally setting when “Rocky Ground” opened the six-song 
encore, after a long absence from the set.  Following “Born in the 
U.S.A.” and “Born to Run,” Bruce began breaking cultural and 
interspecies stereotypes, pulling a self-proclaimed “chubby girl” and 
what can only be perceived as a person-sized rabbit on stage along with 
two others to go “Dancing in the Dark” and try their hands at the 
guitar.  Bruce offered a unique show of his own during “Tenth Avenue,” 
shedding his shirt in favor of a sweat- and water-soaked white tee.  The
 show concluded with an energetic “Rockin’ all Over the World” that had 
the crowd singing and dancing all the way out the door.<br>

Notes From The Road: Geneva</strong><br>
		<br>
		<br>
		 <br>
Appearing on stage in Suisse romande for the first time in their 40-year
 career, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band instantly set the 
famously neutral Swiss crowd alight. Belting out the opening vocals to 
“Shackled and Drawn,” the 30,000-strong audience sang with the intensity
 of a group twice their size. From the moment the E Street Band kicked 
in, allowing Bruce to do his favorite power march, people danced and — 
in a country of enormous wealth — sang the lyrics of the “poor boy” in a
 “world gone wrong” with conviction.<br>
Feeding off this energy, as request signs were taken — including The 
River favorite “Out in the Street,” which had Bruce running the whole 
length of the stage multiple times — and following a ferocious intro to 
“Because the Night” by the great Nils Lofgren, the stage went dark, and a
 surprise followed.<br>
“We have some folks who follow us and follow us throughout Europe. They 
move from fans to… almost stalkers,” Bruce laughed. “Not quite! This is 
for one of our great fans.” As he revealed the sign for an “obscure” 
song “originally cut for The River,” those fans screamed as the delicate
 intro to “Frankie” began. With Bruce playing his guitar as softly as he
 did in 1980, singing with an air of mature reflection, not even the 
falling rain could detract from Geneva Stadium’s warm glow.<br>
“Frankie” ended with Bruce handing his harmonica to the father-daughter 
duo who requested it, and the words “lately I’ve been standing out in 
the freezing rain” rang true. With that rain intensifying, Bruce pulled 
out another harmonica and converged with Stevie at center stage to begin
 “The River.” Elated applause greeted the song before the crowd fell 
quiet. How anyone can make such a heartbreaking song sound so beautiful 
is a mystery only answered while 30,000 people stand in silence as 
Bruce’s falsetto takes the song to ethereal levels.<br>
With the main set powering towards its climax, “Land of Hope and Dreams”
 was very poignantly dedicated to Nelson Mandela. The encores opened 
with a rare, intimate performance of “The Promise” by request, played by
 Bruce alone on the piano, in a pool of blue light on an otherwise dark 
stage. When Roy Bittan returned following Bruce’s performance, he 
gestured to the crowd, smiling, in recognition of how far Bruce’s 
talents extend.<br>
Following “Tenth Avenue Freeze-out,” the E Street Band leapt into 
“American Land.” Creating a real party atmosphere, the crowd and the 
band all sang along here in the heart of the continent from which so 
many of America’s first immigrants came. With key changes, and Bruce 
leading the band down to center stage, the song gathered pace and 
escalated wildly.<br>
E Street said one final farewell before Bruce returned himself in now 
familiar but much loved fashion, with an acoustic guitar and harmonica. 
Closing the night with “Thunder Road,” he shouted “Merci!” before ending
 a 26-song set. While not a long performance (by the E Street Band’s 
recent standards), the energetic and emotionally intense three-hour show
 left everyone in a joyous — and damp! — daze.<br>

Notes From The Road: Hard Rock Calling</strong><br>
	<br>
Unlike 2012, Bruce Springsteen’s performance at Hard Rock Calling (this 
time held in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park) was held on a warm, bright 
and sunny day — with full sound and power from start to finish. 
Following opening acts including local talent as well as the Zac Brown 
Band, the Alabama Shakes and the Black Crowes, the E Street Band greeted
 the crowd with “Shackled and Drawn.”<br>
The stage was a standard large festival stage, with no side runways or 
front platforms as is common to the usual Springsteen stage, but the 
crew had constructed one lone narrow runway from center stage down to 
the main barrier. Bruce would use the runway as much as he could, making
 forays out to collect signs for “Johnny 99″ and “Reason to Believe.”<br>
Following “Death to My Hometown,” Bruce noted that the band had played 
several shows in the country recently, and that at two of them — Wembley
 Stadium and Coventry — they had performed two albums in their entirety:
 Darkness on the Edge of Town and Born to Run, respectively. And that 
this evening they would be adding Born in the U.S.A. — also played the 
previous evening in Paris — to that list. As the title track boomed out 
of the speakers, the audience cheered their loud approval of this 
announcement.<br>
Tonight’s performance was notable for some fun Springsteen and Van Zandt
 hijinks during “Glory Days,” resulting in the exhortation, “C’mon, 
girls, we want to hear you —that’s the sound we’re working for!” before 
moving back to the top of the stage for the exaggerated butt-shaking 
routine normally a highlight (depending on your point of view) of that 
particular number.<br>
For “Dancing in the Dark,” there were two notable guests: Bruce’s mother
 Adele, brought out to be the lucky lady who got to dance with Bruce, 
and his sister Pam, who was given an acoustic guitar to strum for the 
last bridge before the final “Hey, baby!” refrain.<br>
At the end of the main set, Springsteen would make one final journey 
down to the crowd to retrieve a last sign. Holding it up, he said, “I 
tried to write everything I knew about life up until now in this song; I
 still find things in it. It is my great story about rock ‘n’ roll and 
the hand life deals to us in general,” and he displayed the sign to the 
crowd: “Jungleland.”<br>
During the encore, Zac Brown joined the E Street Band for “Tenth Avenue 
Freeze-out.” At the very end, after Bruce had escorted each member off 
stage and had returned with an acoustic guitar and a microphone, he 
commented on how a tattoo he had seen in the audience was “Worth a 
spontaneous number… I run into people with tattoos all over the place. 
That’s just lovely. I’m of the pre-tattoo generation, but I greatly 
enjoy them on others.” With that explanation, he began a solo acoustic 
performance of “My Lucky Day” (from 2009′s Working on a Dream album) to 
close the show.<br>

<strong class="text-strong">Notes From The Road: Paris</strong><br>
		<br>
Twenty-eight years ago this day, Bruce Springsteen brought his wildly 
successful Born in the U.S.A. tour to Paris and played at the Parc de la
 Cournevue. On a 2013 Saturday night at the Stade de France, he revived 
the spirit and content of that show over three hours and ten minutes — a
 flashback for those there in 1985, and a treat for those too young to 
have attended.<br>
Speaking in French, Bruce told the Parisian crowd that that to do 
something special for the show, the band would be performing the Born in
 the U.S.A. album from top to bottom; judging by the roar of approval, 
the crowd was quite happy with Bruce’s choice. They sang along loudly to
 “Born in the U.S.A.,” waved their arms for “Bobby Jean,” bounced to “No
 Surrender,” swooned to  “I’m on Fire” and, well, danced to “Dancing in 
the Dark.”<br>
The spirit of 1985 was present in many of the other choices in the 
setlist, with an energetic one-two punch of “Badlands” and “Out in the 
Street” starting the show, as well as a granted sign request for 
“Cadillac Ranch,” featuring an extended guitar from solo from Steve Van 
Zandt.  Each time he would try to end his solo, Bruce yelled out, “One 
more time, Steve! One more time!” as he kept going.<br>
Also by request was Little Richard’s “Lucille,” via a sign that Bruce 
grabbed on one of his early forays out into the crowd. Displaying it on 
the giant video screen, Bruce acknowledged that “Someone is trying to 
stump the E Street Band!” and spotting the requestor, told him to “Wave 
your hand, son!” After only a very brief consultation with Garry and 
Steve, the band crashed right into the performance, complete with Bruce 
bringing the horn section down front to play the main riff.  To no one’s
 surprise, the band remains un-stumpable.<br>
Despite playing hit after hit in the main set, Bruce still had something
 left for the encore, which he started with a rare performance of one of
 his newest songs, the last track on Wrecking Ball.  Serving as a worthy
 summation of the show, he introduced it by saying that “The E Street 
Band is here because of the thousands of musicians who came before us, 
who we studied and learned from… who we can never repay, except by 
playing our best for you. This is a song about how the voices of the 
dead inform the lives of the living, how they are never truly gone — 
their voices remain there, and their spirits are there in the air — this
 is “We Are Alive.”<br>
—Glenn Radecki, Backstreets.com<br>

<strong class="text-strong">Notes From The Road: Gijon</strong><br>
		<br>
		 <br>
Although it was well after 9pm, the sky was still bright when the E 
Street Band took the stage at Estadio El Molinon in Gijon, Spain. Bruce 
spent an extended few moments at the edge of the stage examining the 
crowd, nodding and smiling, before bringing the band into a high-energy 
version of “My Love Will Not Let You Down.” The video screens were full 
of bouncing Spaniards singing along immediately. With the opening notes 
of “Out in the Street,” the crowd responded by singing the opening 
refrain loudly and enthusiastically, generating big smiles in response 
from Bruce; he jumped up and down along with the crowd as he brought the
 song to a close.<br>
A few signs were gathered from the front of the runway, and “Better 
Days” was held up to the camera before being propped up at the mic. 
“Ain’t Good Enough For You” made a rare appearance, Bruce challenging 
the band by holding up the sign and asking, “Do they know it?!” 
Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Travelin’ Band” would be the third 
request in a row, highlighted by a strong solo from Jake Clemons and 
some solid boogie-woogie piano from the Professor.<br>
While sign requests and covers are always great, the highlight of the 
show tonight was the next three-song arc:  ”Jack of All Trades,” “The 
River,” and “Atlantic City,” sharing stories of hard times and difficult
 choices. “The River” almost always elicits a powerful, vocal response 
from the crowds in Europe, and tonight in Gijon was no different. 
“Atlantic City” was one of the night’s standouts, performed with 
precision, power and depth from all the musicians, but particularly in 
the vocals: after murmuring “Shhh” a few times, Springsteen began the 
last verse with careful, deliberate phrasing which emphasized the 
message of the song.<br>
At the end of the song, Bruce realizes Steve is still finishing 
“Atlantic City”: “C’mon Steve, get a guitar!” Once equipped, it was time
 for a vintage “You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch),” with the Bruce
 and Stevie comedy team front and center, playing off each other and 
hamming it up, to their obvious delight and the delight of other band 
members as well, judging by the smiles visible on Garry and Roy’s faces.<br>
Another sign-gathering interlude took place at the center platform, and 
Bruce returned to the microphone with not one but two signs for 
“Rosalita,” one shaped like a Fender Esquire, which clearly took some 
care to produce. It was a raucous, exuberant version of “Rosie,” and the
 song ended out at the center platform with Bruce, Steve, and Jake front
 and center. At some point during the up-front hijinks, Steve donned 
someone’s hat and then a pair of American flag sunglasses for good 
measure.<br>
There was a large quantity of signs brought to the show tonight, but 
some of the largest were for “Drive All Night” (including two large 
banners hung from the upper level of the stadium). The request granted, 
Jake Clemons had another standout solo, reminiscent of his uncle’s work 
on the track but sharper, with a clearer tone. Steve’s harmonies were 
spot-on, and Bruce’s voice was solid and rich, with a smoky timbre.<br>
Following “Badlands,” Steve walked over to Bruce and pointed at 
something in the crowd. “Steve has made a request!” Bruce announced, 
before beginning the opening riff of “Light of Day.” Then, Springsteen 
himself made an additional sortie out stage left to pick up another sign
 and prop it at the mic, this time for “Radio Nowhere”.<br>
The usual parade of hits closed out the show, ending with a lively 
“Twist and Shout,” at the end of which Bruce declared: “No mas, no mas, 
Gijon, no mas!” And then: “Uno mas!” Yelling a few chords at the band to
 bring them back together, Springsteen took them into the Isley 
Brothers’ “Shout!” to end the show.<br>
After the band had waved goodbye and had been waved off the stage by 
Bruce, he turned to the crowd one more time; grabbing an acoustic 
guitar, he came back to the center mic. He explained that he had been in
 town previously with Patti and his daughter at a horse event, and that 
the mayor of Gijon had sent a letter asking him to come play. “I know 
times are hard in Spain, so I appreciate you coming to see us. I do this
 for you, wishing for better times,” Bruce told the crowd before the 
now-familiar acoustic “Thunder Road” to end the set, bringing a lovely 
end to a night of diehard favorites and greatest hits, performed for 
fans from all over Spain.<br>

Notes From The Road: Nijmegen</strong><br>
		<br>
The last two times Bruce visited Holland, he played at the southern tip 
of the country at the Pinkpop festival. Headlining the festival in 2009 
and 2012, Bruce stated multiple times that he greatly enjoys playing at 
these events. Maybe that’s why the show in Nijmegen marked a difference 
from other European shows, as a rare one with opening acts: Jamie N 
Commons and The Black Crowes.<br>
Jamie N Commons took the stage around 4:30 pm. Few had heard of him, but
 the 24-year-old played like a seasoned rocker. With a remarkable, raw 
voice he blew away the audience. The Black Crowes were next and put 
together a fun show. The entire band looked, danced and sang as if they 
came straight from Woodstock.<br>
After these amazing support acts, everybody was waiting anxiously for 
the Boss. At 7:30, the crowd was welcomed with the sound of a lone 
guitar, as Springsteen walked on stage for a powerful solo version of 
“The Ghost of Tom Joad.” With the greeting “Hallo Nijmegen, hallo 
Holland, hoe gaat het?” — Hello Nijmegen, hello Holland, how are you? — 
he officially opened the show, and the rest of the band took their 
places for “Land of Hope and Dreams.”<br>
The requests came early this evening, as they have lately. Bruce grabbed
 some signs from the audience right away and played very fun versions of
 “Sherry Darling” and “Growin’ Up.” The third request was an unusual 
one. “We’re going to test the E Street Band,” Bruce stated, laughing, 
“Only the 100 people right up here in the front know what this actually 
is. It’s got a tricky bridge…” But the greatly talented band played “So 
Young and in Love,” from 1998′s Tracks, flawlessly.<br>
After a grandiose version of “The River” — 60,000 people were singing 
along — it was time for something particularly special. With Bruce in 
full-album mode, he announced that they would be playing the Darkness of
 the Edge of Town album in its entirety.<br>
The band started in full swing with an energized “Badlands” and “Adam 
Raised a Cain”. Guitars were rocking, drums were pounding, and the 
audience was screaming their lungs out. “Racing in the Street” was 
simply breathtaking. During Roy Bittan’s masterful conclusion, the 
clouds, which had been hovering all day, suddenly parted. A beautiful 
moment. “Prove It All Night” was the highlight of Nils’ evening. The 
guitar virtuoso played a mind-blowing solo, twirling around stage and 
even playing guitar with his teeth.<br>
After the album was finished, those clouds had amassed again and rain 
came drizzling down. Bruce hollered, “Here comes the rain!” before 
setting off into “Pay Me My Money Down,” the party song of the evening. 
He brought all of the E Street Horns to the very front platform, where 
they all sang, played, and danced around. Cindy Mizelle, Michelle Moore 
and Curtis King joined them on the platform, carrying decorated 
umbrellas.<br>
With a beautiful version of “Thunder Road,” Bruce closed the main set. 
He kicked off the encores with an overwhelmingly powerful “Born in the 
U.S.A.” After “Tenth Avenue Freeze-out” the drizzling rain turned into a
 downpour. But Bruce could not care less: “I would go home, but it’s not
 raining hard enough!” He actually seemed energized by the downpour. At 
the end of “Twist and Shout,” he made the whole band come out to the 
front stage, ushering them all into the heavy shower — except for Steve,
 who hung back and watched with great delight.<br>
“Twist and Shout” marked the 33rd song of the evening’s marathon, but 
the legendary E Street Band was not done yet. “It still isn’t raining 
hard enough!” Bruce shouted toward the sea of rain ponchos. The band 
finally played the mother of all party songs, the Isley Brothers’ 
“Shout.” Everybody was soaking wet, but nobody cared; 60,000 people were
 dancing and singing until their knees hurt and their throats were sore.<br>
With the words “Ik hou van jullie” — I love you — and “we’ll be seeing 
you,” the band left the stage. What a show. We are once again reminded 
why this man is called The Boss. He may be 63, but he’s still rocking 
like a 20-year-old.<br>

Notes From The Road: Coventry</strong><br>
		<br>
Everyone knows what a great guitar player Bruce is, but when he took the
 stage alone at the top of the night for a solo version of “The Ghost of
 Tom Joad,” he reminded us that he also plays a mean harmonica. This set
 the stage for the evening’s showcase of instrumental wonders to come as
 the multi-talented E Street band took their places for “Long Walk 
Home.” Without a break or a breath they dove into “My Love Will Not Let 
You Down,” during which Bruce collected up a bevy of audience signs 
requests. He held up the first one and said “I like this,” revealing a 
sign that said “Play Anything.” Knowing his friend needed a boost, Bruce
 shouted, “Come on Steve,” and they were off into “Two Hearts.” If this 
week’s death of Steve’s “other Boss,” James Gandolfini, surely weighed 
heavy, it was good to see some rock ‘n’ roll catharsis work its magic.<br>
The requests continued with “Seeds,” “Trapped,” and a particularly 
special one, the E Street premiere of “Long Time Comin’.” The sign read 
“For my new born baby Ruben,” prompting Bruce to give some practical 
parenting advice: “Don’t fuck it up, now, don’t fuck it up,” he said 
with a chuckle. Before playing the song, he told a funny story about how
 people create two-sided signs, hoping at least half of it will get his 
attention — the “Play Anything” sign, for instance, had “I’d look good 
playing your guitar” on the other side. “Sometimes they are just trying 
to cheer you up,” he said, showing a sign proclaiming, “Miami, still 
looking good!” which prompted a Stevie! Stevie! chant from the 
audience. During the “Hungry Heart” sing-along, a fan in crowd caught 
Bruce’s attention with a sign asking, “Bruce, can I have a man hug?” 
Yes, you can… he was rewarded with not one but four hugs, and a little 
dance too. Bruce was working hard to keep his fans happy, including the 
little boy who was called up on stage next. Whle the lad was retrieving 
his sign, Bruce said he was practicing for hosting a Saturday morning 
television show — “for when this all goes to hell!” No chance of that 
happening any time soon based on the reaction to “The River,” the song 
on nine-year-old Joseph’s request.<br>
After all these signs, Bruce said it was time to change things up a bit 
and announced that Born to Run would be played in its entirety, 
dedicated to “Our great friend James Gandolfini.” “Thunder Road,” of 
course, kicked it off, and with horns wailing left no doubt that this 
wasn’t the lullaby version of the song. “Backstreets” with “Sad Eyes” 
worked into the middle… remember how you would listen to this album over
 and over to cure a broken heart? With this version of “Backstreets,” an
 audience of enraptured Brits learned that it still works for that.<br>
A blistering “Born to Run” and high-energy “She’s the One” made “Meeting
 Across the River” — played with only Bruce, Curt Ramm, Roy Bittan, and 
Garry Tallent on stage — seem all the more hauntingly mesmerizing. Jake 
Clemons captivated the audience with a note-perfect solo on 
“Jungleland,” and Bruce proved that he still has the best howl in rock 
‘n’ roll.<br>
Thirty seconds later everyone was listening to what their butts were 
telling them, up and shaking it to “Pay Me My Money Down.” There was a 
lot of fancy dancing by the horns and colorful New Orleans-style 
umbrellas hoisted by the choir. It was an absolute visual and aural 
delight that reset the stage and got everyone ready for the dance party 
to follow.<br>
Cindy Mizelle, featured on “Shackled and Drawn,” just gets better and 
better, her honey-sweet voice blending perfectly with Bruce’s gruffness 
and then soaring to encourage us all to rise up. “Lonesome Day” returned
 to the setlist, the “It’s alright” refrain like a comforting pat on the
 back to a troubled friend. “We are Alive” seemed to do the same. The 
encores brought us out the other side, pure rock ‘n’ roll bliss from the
 heart-thumping, chest-pounding “Born in the U.S.A.” through “Raise Your
 Hand” and “American Land.”<br>

Notes From The Road: Glasgow</strong><br>
		<br>
		 <br>
The E Street Band took the stage under a bright summer sun matched only 
by the bright shiny Scottish faces. This was only the third time Bruce 
has played a show in Glasgow, but with as much fun as he was having on 
stage, he ought to come here more often. The show opened strongly with 
“We Take Care of Our Own,” followed by “The Ties That Bind.” Scotland 
was loving it, and Bruce seemed to pick up on the energy — he dove into 
the crowd and started pulling out signs before the second song was even 
over.<br>
So the requests began early. Bruce granted “Jole Blon” first, the Cajun 
traditional he reworked for Gary U.S. Bonds back in ’81. Next, a sign 
request for “It’s Hard to Be a Saint in the City,” played with 
vein-popping intensity. Roy’s piano playing was stunning, but when Bruce
 and Stevie traded guitar licks it was truly jaw-dropping. The intense 
pace kept up with “Radio Nowhere,” and “Bobby Jean” rounded out the sign
 requests —it might have been the prettiest version of “Bobby Jean” 
heard in recent memory.<br>
On this anniversary of Clarence Clemons’s passing, it was especially 
poignant to have “My City of Ruins” back in the set. The horn section 
shone on this one, with Ed Manion digging deep to hit that last note. As
 Jake came in, the camera panned over several signs in the audience 
acknowledging The Big Man. But it wasn’t sad. It wasn’t sad at all, even
 though tears were shed. There was a lot of love bouncing off the stage 
and through the audience and back as we all shared in the joy of his 
memory.<br>
“My City of Ruins” seemed to wring out the fevered intensity of first 
part of the show; after that it got very loose and playful with “Spirit 
in the Night” and the second jaw-dropping moment of the night, “E Street
 Shuffle.” Reverend Everett Bradley really showed his stuff, his 
percussion instruments making this 40-year-old song sound like something
 brand new.<br>
Then it was back for more song request signs. One, politely asking for a
 pick, received a positive reply, which made the young man asking very 
happy. “I’m on Fire” played next made us all happy. Bruce kept it slow 
with “Tougher than the Rest,” by request of a young woman in memory of 
her father.<br>
Next was a trio of gangster songs, “Atlantic City,” “Murder 
Incorporated,” right into “Johnny 99.” It was during the last of these 
that vocalist Curtis King revealed the most unusual instrument ever seen
 on the E-Street Stage: a bell affixed by a strap to his butt that rang 
with the right dance move. It was so unusual that when Bruce saw it, he 
actually stopped singing. As the camera zoomed in on Curtis’s butt-bell 
contraption Bruce said, “They like to surprise me!” He was laughing so 
hard he had trouble getting the next line out.<br>
“Open All Night” got everyone’s butts our of their seats, just as Bruce 
predicted, and the audience stayed there for Darlington County, which 
had some great audience interaction; Bruce took the phone away from a 
young woman in the audience and told the person on the other end, “She’s
 busy right now — really busy!” Now that the audience was up, they 
danced and sang through the rest of the set, culminating in “Badlands” 
into “Land of Hope and Dreams.”<br>
After a fun series of encores, “Tenth Avenue Freeze-out” might well have
 been the end of a really great show… but this party was going to fast 
to stop now. “We ain’t goin’ home yet!” Bruce hollered, and he launched 
into “Twist and Shout” followed by a big hit for Scottish singer Lulu, 
the Isley Brothers’ “Shout.”<br>
A visibly tired Bruce — this was a three-and-a-half-hour show, after all
 — ushered the band off stage, and then he came back for what he called 
“a rock ‘n’ roll lullaby,” a closing “Thunder Road,” solo acoustic and 
simply beautiful.<br>
With so many song requests played in Glasgow, you have to wonder if 
there will be a show in the future that is sign requests start to 
finish. If anybody could pull that off, it’d be Bruce and the E Street 
Band.<br>

Notes From The Road: London</strong><br>
		<br>
		 <br>
On November 18, 1975, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band played 
their first ever concert outside of America. The Hammersmith Odeon 
London ’75 show marked the beginning of a near 40-year love affair 
between Bruce and the United Kingdom. From the moment he stepped onto 
stage as a young 26-year-old and played to London, for the first time, 
the introduction to “Thunder Road,” Springsteen captivated the British 
audience.<br>
Thirty-eight years later, they emerged onto the stage of Wembley 
Stadium, for the first time since 1988. As the E Street Band walked out,
 the crowd erupted with a roar. Tonight, Bruce would create light out of
 Darkness.<br>
“Land of Hope and Dreams” opened the show, setting the widescreen tone 
of the evening. A rarity followed: “Jackson Cage,” which had the crowd 
rocking nearly as hard as the band. “Radio Nowhere” maintained the 
energy before a gorgeous rendition of “Save My Love” from The Promise. 
Taking more request signs, Springsteen pulled up “Cadillac Ranch” but 
quipped that it was “too easy” and swapped it for “Rosalita.” The 
physical energy then transferred to emotional energy as Springsteen and 
the band played “This Hard Land.”<br>
Requests continued with “Lost in the Flood.” The now-40-year-old song is
 a rare and emotionally captivating performance. Bruce sang with 
conviction, and as the tale of the “ragamuffin drummer” unfolded on 
stage, this concert already felt like one for the history books. After 
Bruce returned to a “Hungry Heart” sign, and Wembley swayed to another 
River classic, Springsteen offered the crowd a choice: he could either 
“continue playing requests,” or he could play the whole of Darkness on 
the Edge of Town.<br>
Bruce thanked London for many years of love and support, to rapturous 
applause, before jumping straight into the heart of what many fans would
 call his greatest album. Indeed, Springsteen himself acknowledged that 
Darkness defines the work of the E Street Band before rocking the 
stadium to the beat of “Badlands.” Since the three Swedish album shows 
of last month, Bruce has treated audiences across Europe to full-album 
performances. Many fans anticipated Born in the U.S.A. at Wembley, but 
as Bruce tore into “Adam Raised a Cain” before then singing his 
hauntingly beautiful vocal intro to “Something in the Night,” it was 
hard to imagine a fan wishing for anything else.<br>
One of his most moving songs of all, “Racing in the Street” was a 
highlight of Wembley’s show. Picking up where Bruce’s words stopped, Roy
 Bittan’s piano was staggeringly beautiful and masterfully constructed. 
As Roy played his own “‘Jungleland’ sax solo,” always slightly 
different, Bruce stood back in the darkness of his stage with the E 
Street Band, looking out into an entranced crowd.<br>
Concluding Darkness on the Edge of Town with its title track, Bruce 
brought some fun to Wembley with “Shackled and Drawn,” followed by 
“Waitin’ on a Sunny Day.” The main set ended with “Light of Day” before 
the encore began with a dance-til-you-drop “Pay Me My Money Down.” “Born
 to Run” led into “Bobby Jean” while the crowd swayed and sang together.
 “Dancing in the Dark” saw two lucky fans on stage, one to dance with 
Stevie, and the other a Mum whose children “paid” Bruce $1 for the 
dance.<br>
As the E Street Band left the stage following “Twist and Shout,” which 
Bruce remarked might have them cut off à la London 2012, he paused with 
his back to the audience. Now alone on stage, Bruce took an acoustic 
guitar and harmonica, returned to his microphone, and — breaking his 
curfew — told London “we love ya” before ending the night with the song 
that he opened with, 38 years before.<br>
“Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road…”<br>

Notes From The Road: Milan</strong><br>
				 <br>
Who do you love more, your mom or your dad? What is the best Bruce 
concert you’ve seen? Unanswerable questions. But chances are that if 
you’ve seen Springsteen play Milan’s San Siro Stadium, it’s a show that 
has to be in the running. 1985, 2003, 2008, 2012… every single show here
 has been special in its own way. And this year’s is no exception.<br>
“Since I was a kid, I’ve played quite a few places… but this one is 
special,” says an emotional Springsteen at the end of San Siro 2013. 
“You are special. I keep you in my heart every time.” This is not rock 
cliché — he really means it. You can tell just from the facts: a mammoth
 set at 34 songs, three-and-a-quarter hours, with rarities, premieres, 
hits, and even a full album. And you can tell it from his face.<br>
The first Italian concert of the year with no acoustic pre-show starts 
early, at 8:15. As Bruce takes the stage, the sight is breathtaking: The
 historical stadium, home of soccer teams Milan and Inter, is packed 
with 60,000 people. The second and third rings of the venue have white, 
red and green signs that form a gigantic dedication: “Our love is real.”
 Bruce remains speechless for a full minute.<br>
When the show begins, it already feels like an encore: not only because 
the opening song (“Land of Hope and Dreams”) is one that usually comes 
near the end, but because of the energy and the audience participation. 
Going into “My Love Will Not Let You Down” and “Out in the Street,” the 
whole thing already feels like a party, with the entire stadium 
chanting.<br>
As request time comes, the real surprises begin. The choices are party 
songs: “American Land” and “Long Tall Sally,” played for the first time 
by the E Street Band. After a welcome “Loose Ends” (“This is Stevie’s 
favorite!”) the standard sequence is cut to just two songs, “Wrecking 
Ball” and “Death to My Hometown.” No “We Take Care of Our Own” and no 
“Spirit in the Night.” Bruce doesn’t need them tonight. His voice is in 
perfect shape, and his face appears continuously astonished by audience.
 A couple more songs — a wonderful “Atlantic City” and an intense “The 
River,” with Bruce leading the audience back into a reprise — and then 
comes what almost every die-hard fan had been talking about and hoping 
for, if they didn’t exactly know it was coming. Remembering his history 
at San Siro, Bruce announces that in honor of that historical 1985 
concert — his first time in Italy, back on the Born in the U.S.A. World 
Tour — he’s going to play Born in the U.S.A. start to finish.<br>
Playing a full album is a choice sometimes debated among fans. But the 
fact is that Born in the U.S.A. fits the evening perfectly, from the 
bombastic beginning of the title track to the emotional closing of “My 
Hometown,” with so many fast songs in between. A fun “Working on the 
Highway” and a wonderful “I’m Goin’ Down” (with a fantastic electric 
guitar intro) are the highlights of the sequence, along with Jake’s 
perfect renditions of the solos in “Bobby Jean” and “Dancing in the 
Dark.” Bruce and the band cut a rug with many different ladies as 
“Dancing” stretches out.<br>
The rest of the main set is like a greatest hits collection, ending with
 “Hungry Heart.” And then the encore takes the energy and intensity to a
 higher level, if possible. The acoustic segment many fans had hoped for
 in the afternoon comes as an encore intro, with a bit of “This Land is 
Your Land” that segues into Wrecking Ball’s “We Are Alive,” (played very
 rarely this year) as the band joins in. After the trifecta of “Born to 
Run,”<br>
“Tenth Avenue Freeze-out” and “Twist and Shout” that often closes the 
show, Bruce just wants to keep going. So does the audience, dancing on 
the soccer field. The screens show him calling out some chords changes, 
and the E Street Band goes into the Isley Brothers’ “Shout” — a perfect 
companion to “Twist and Shout,” as Springsteen directs the moves of the 
audience. It’s a perfect way to end the evening as well. Only, we still 
aren’t quite finished. As in Naples, Bruce ushers the band off and, by 
himself, sings “Thunder Road” with just his acoustic guitar, a moving 
ending to a wonderful night.<br>
I’ve seen Springsteen in San Siro all five times. 1985 was the first 
rock concert of my life. All were memorable, especially the rain-soaked 
2003 show. What I saw tonight rivaled any of them for emotion, 
intensity, energy, passion and fun. This was one of the best concerts of
 my life: pure rock music, Bruce at his best.<br>

Notes From The Road: Padua</strong><br>
		<br>
You could tell it would be an epic night right from the beginning. Not 
from the acoustic pre-show—an early one, almost three hours before the 
actual concert, Bruce surprising us with a nice pair of “The Promised 
Land” and “Growin’ Up.” You could tell from the “real” opening of the 
sold-out show, which picked up exactly where the last Italian date 
ended. In Naples, Bruce had closed the show with a wonderful acoustic 
version of “Thunder Road,” all by himself in the Plebiscito Square. Here
 in Padua, in a packed stadium of 40,000, he came out all by himself. No
 E Street Band, just an acoustic guitar, and “The Ghost of Tom Joad” 
played in a raucous version, with full chords strummed hard rather than 
the delicate arpeggios of the original version.<br>
At that point you could already feel the energy, which erupted fully 
with the arrival of the band: “Long Walk Home,” once again in the 
opening spot, followed by a “My Love Will Not Let You Down” that got the
 stadium jumping. Bruce’s voice was in much better shape than in Naples,
 and he felt good — you could tell that from his face, too.<br>
After “Two Hearts,” it was already request time. And what choices: John 
Lee Hooker’s “Boom Boom,” a wonderful “The Ties That Bind,” and 
“Something in the Night” played as the sky turned dark. The next 
surprise: Bruce announced that this would be a full album show, Born to 
Run — just as some drops of rain started to fall. But the rain was 
easily forgotten with this classic sequence, “Backstreets” including 
some of the moving “Sad Eyes” interlude, a lights-on “Born to Run,” a 
powerful “She’s the One,” and the touching finale of “Jungleland.”<br>
After that, the show didn’t have any more setlist surprises — just pure 
energy. And some very fun moments, too: “Pay Me My Money Down” saw a new
 member joining the E Street Band, a first-row Italian fan that 
introduced himself as a member of a cover band (The Fireplaces), who 
played his spoons nicely thorough the song, giving it a new rhythmic 
touch. On “Dancing in the Dark,” Bruce saw a sign reading “Please dance 
with my mother-in-law” — which he actually did, bringing up the woman up
 on stage. The show closed near the three-hour mark with a celebratory 
version of “Twist and Shout,” fans happily dancing all over the lawn and
 tribunes of the stadium.<br>
Bruce and the E Street Band played in the northeast of Italy last year 
as well, in Trieste. Clearly, with the in-sequence Born to Run, he felt 
Padua had to be a different show. One can only wonder what to expect 
next, Monday at Milan’s San Siro, one of Bruce’s favorite venues and 
home of four wild shows in 1985, 2003, 2008 and last year, which 
stretched out to three hours and 40 minutes. One thing is sure: it will 
be as fun as Padua — Italian audiences kickstart Bruce like few others.<br>

Notes From The Road: Hannover</strong><br>
		<br>
		 <br>
“Who’ll Stop the Rain” didn’t need to be played in Hannover. The warm 
and sunny weather in the Northern part of Germany made a huge contrast 
to the pouring rain of the previous two shows, in Munich in particular, 
and Bruce and the band clearly appreciated it. He told the Hannover 
crowd, “It was cold in Munich, it was rainy in Munich, it was windy in 
Munich!” The crowd of 40,000 people went wild when the show started with
 “Land of Hope and Dreams”; “No Surrender” and “My Love Will Not Let You
 Down” followed through on that energetic start.<br>
During “Hungry Heart” a fan handed Springsteen a beer; he saluted the 
beer-loving Germans and chugged it, with great delight from the crowd. 
As the first notes of “Spirit in the Night” reached the audience, Bruce 
asked for another beer — which, of course, he got. In the middle of the 
song he lay face-down on the stage, joking, “It must be the beers.”<br>
Bruce took not only beers but a lot of signs from the audience as well, 
throughout the night. The most extraordinary one was an emphatic 
request: “I would give my right testicle to hear ‘Drift Away.’” Bruce 
stared at it for a moment and said, “Now, we don’t really know this 
song…” and though he decided to give it a shot, “I do want the man to go
 home with both testicles.” He played a beautiful version of Dobie 
Gray’s 1973 hit single, starting the song alone on acoustic guitar with 
the band joining in later for a powerful finish.<br>
The E Street Band was in perfect shape. There was a blistering, whirling
 dervish solo from Nils Lofgren during “Because the Night” — he took 
over the stage and completely owned the song. And Max, more powerful 
than a locomotive, played as if his life was depending on it. He even 
duelled with percussionist Everett Bradley a couple of times.<br>
During the intro to “Open All Night,” Bruce told the audience: “I see 
some of my Germans sitting down!” He promised that everybody would be 
out of their seats within 30 seconds, and he kept his promise. Everybody
 danced like crazy throughout the song from the Nebraska album that got 
its party makeover on the Seeger Sessions tour.<br>
The night rocked on. Not only was the setlist full of rocking songs like
 “Johnny 99,” “Murder Incorporated,” and “Radio Nowhere,” but the 
audience was also extremely lively. The crowd jumped and sang until 
their knees hurt and their throats were sore, and the close of the main 
set took things even higher with “Light of Day.”<br>
Bruce kicked off the encores with a tour premiere. Two signs asked for 
“Roll of the Dice,” from 1992′s Human Touch, and Bruce decided to give 
it a shot: “We just did some really good ones, so if I fuck this one up 
it won’t be so bad!” He didn’t — it was a beautiful, solo-acoustic 
version of the song.<br>
Following this quiet and humble performance, it was again time to rock. 
After a rollercoaster ride that consisted of “Born to Run,” “Born in the
 U.S.A.,” “Seven Nights to Rock” and “Dancing in the Dark,” Bruce looked
 exhausted. But he wasn’t done yet. He took a boxing stance and jumped 
around the stage while challenging the audience to keep on dancing.<br>
After almost three-and-a-half hours, the show ended with an energetic 
“American Land” where Bruce thanked everyone for being a great audience.
 With the words “Wir lieben euch!” — We love you! — the Boss and the E 
Street Band left the stage. Fifteen minutes after the show, rain was 
suddenly pouring down. But people didn’t care and kept on singing Bruce 
songs in the streets of Hannover, while walking home.<br>

Notes From The Road: Munich</strong><br>
		<br>
		 <br>
On this unseasonably cold evening, after eight straight hours of rain 
leading up to the outdoor concert at Munich’s Olympiastadion, there was 
really no choice but for Bruce to start with “Who’ll Stop the Rain” — 
and he did, solo acoustic. Unfortunately, the rain did not stop. But 
neither did the show. While the band took their places on stage, Bruce 
strolled out onto the center riser, held out his hands and asked, “What 
rain?” to the delight of his plastic poncho-clad audience.<br>
A few songs in, a delightful carnival face sign hoisted by a kid sitting
 on his dad’s shoulders caught Bruce’s eye, and he brought up the sign —
 and the kid! The request was for “Seaside Bar Song,” and it set the 
Dance Party stage for the rest of the night. No one would have blamed 
Bruce on such a blustery night to make it a quick show, but he was 
having none of Mother Nature’s nonsense. He flipped the sign around and 
gave us a double-shot: on the other side was a request for “Rosalita.”<br>
During “Spirit in the Night,” Springsteen laid down a challenge to the 
weather: “We don’t care about the rain,” he said, “let it rain, sleet, 
snow, we deliver!” And deliver he did, announcing the next surprise of 
the evening — that tonight, he and the band would play Born in the 
U.S.A. in its entirety from start to finish. “Born in the U.S.A.,” a 
rocking “Cover Me,” “Darlington County”… it was a perfect choice for a 
crowd that needed to keep moving. “I’m on Fire” was so hot that the rain
 close to the stage turned into steam (though that could have been the 
onstage heaters). “Bobby Jean” is clearly a fan favorite in Germany, as 
the whole crowd went wild and sang along. On “Glory Days,” Bruce 
implored Steve to come out into the rain with him. “He’s never been in 
the rain before,” Bruce said. Steve replied, “We can’t feel our 
fingers!” The album performance finished with the Munich audience 
singing the resounding chorus of “My Hometown.” The Born in the U.S.A. 
tour in 1984 was when Nils Lofgren joined the band, and he truly owned 
this portion of the show. We didn’t see any spinning — he might well 
have slid off the wet stage — but the playing was masterful, and he was a
 star who reminded this audience why Bruce keeps two guitar players.<br>
Ending the main set with “Badlands,” Bruce kept the crowd singing and 
dancing through the rest of the show despite the ceaseless rain. “Pay Me
 My Money Down,” a go-to song for the job ever since it reliably 
separated arses from seats in Australia, kicked off the encore. After 
“Tenth Avenue Freeze-out,” Bruce incredulously asked the cheering 
audience, “It’s cold and wet… you can’t really want any more?” But of 
course everyone did, and we were rewarded with another surprise request,
 a classic cover of John Fogerty’s “Rockin’ All Over the World,” 
followed by “Twist and Shout” to end the night. It wasn’t the longest 
show, and the cold and rain wreaked havoc on the instruments and 
players; there was no throwing of guitars, as it was just too wet for 
even an accomplished guitar-catcher like Kevin Buell. But despite the 
forces Mother Nature threw at them that might have made lesser bands 
call it off, Bruce and the E Street Band delivered a performance that 
will leave Munich talking for years.<br>

Notes From The Road: Naples, Italy</strong><br>
		<br>
		 <br>
Ninety-two years ago, the coffin of Enrico Caruso was carried inside the
 Church of San Francesco di Paola, while twenty thousand Neapolitans 
gathered together in the opposite Piazza del Plebiscito were singing “‘O
 Sole Mio”, the song that ensured to the tenor a number one hit on 
Billboard Charts in 1916.<br>
Last night, in that same square in the very heart of Naples, Bruce 
Springsteen emerged from the backstage and conducted the accordions of 
Roy, Charlie and Nils, and the big chorus of the crowd singing: “‘O sole
 mio sta ‘nfronte a te!” Then he picked up a big foam-rubber sign shaped
 as a sun (prepared by a proud fan whose name is Chiara Matteucci) and 
said, in the language of his ancestors, “This is the sun of my family. I
 am Italian… a Southern-Italian,” before starting an appropriate “Long 
Walk Home.”<br>
It was the beginning of a unique concert because of the venue’s 
neoclassical square, with the stage set under the big dome of the 
Basilica and between two ancient equestrian statues and the strong link 
that connects Bruce with this land: Antonio Zerilli, Bruce’s 
grandfather, owned a restaurant in Vico Equense, a small town 30 miles 
away from Naples. “I could have been serving pasta if my grandfather 
hadn’t moved to America,” Bruce said as he picked up a sign picturing 
the entrance to the Gran Caffè Zerilli.<br>
Southern Italy is beautiful, but this land is also terribly afflicted by
 social and economic problems. When two hours before the show Bruce 
entered the stage playing an acoustic version of “This Hard Land,” his 
homage sounded particularly true and meaningful. “Growin’ Up” followed, 
closing this unexpected moment.<br>
During “My Love Will Not Let You Down,” “Out in the Street,” and “Hungry
 Heart,” the square echoed with enthusiasm the energy of the band, while
 the sunset dyed the sea red on the gulf behind the old King’s Palace. 
“Buona notte,” Bruce shouted at the moon when, after the triple shot of 
Wrecking Ball songs, the sky finally went black and Charlie Giordano 
played the first notes of “Spirit in the Night,” one of the highlights 
of the concert.<br>
What happened next was a real surprise. “We never ever, ever, ever 
played this one in the middle of the show,” Bruce said picking up a sign
 from the crowd and showing it to the cameras, so we all could read: “My
 love Rosie he’s here.” The loose and joyful “Rosalita” got the square 
singing and dancing, before the harmonica intro of “The River” turned 
the atmosphere into a quite intensity. By the end of the song, it 
started to rain: not that much during “Prove It All Night” (with the ’78
 intro and a smoking, acrobatic solo by Nils), but by the middle of “The
 Promised Land” it was pouring. Any other artist would have panicked. 
Not Bruce: he seemed excited and challenged, as he exposed himself to 
downpour. The result was a complete empathy with the crowd, which hadn’t
 moved an inch from their places. “Pay Me My Money Down,” with the horn 
section marching on the platforms under silly Tropicana umbrellas, 
brought the show to an even more galvanized level; and twenty minutes 
later, when Bruce left off running back and forth along the crowd and 
called “Who’ll Stop the Rain”… magically the rain stopped, showing his 
unknown shaman powers.<br>
“The Rising,” “Badlands,” and “Land of Hope and Dreams” closed the main 
set. “My Hometown” opened the encores, with Bruce dedicating the song to
 “Vico Equense, my Italian town” and unrolling a long banner which said 
“This land is your land.”<br>
“Born in the U.S.A.” and “Born to Run” followed; the Courteney Cox of 
the night was pulled on stage for “Dancing in the Dark”, along with a 
female extra-guitarist; and with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and “Twist 
and Shout” the show seemed to have reached his conclusion.<br>
But Bruce had a last surprise to offer to Naples and, alone on the 
stage, he played a beautiful version of “Thunder Road” as he had done 
sixteen years before at the end of his acoustic show from the balcony of
 Teatro Augusteo, a stone’s throw from here.<br>
It was the perfect conclusion of a magical night, that we could entitle: Back to the Roots.<br>

Notes From The Road: Herning</strong><br>
		<br>
		 <br>
A city doesn’t have to be called London or Barcelona to inspire Bruce 
Springsteen to deliver what could be a show that will be remembered long
 after the tour is over. Most people outside of Denmark probably never 
heard of a place named Herning. Even among Danes it’s best known for 
being in the middle of nowhere. Still, it was central enough to host the
 second Danish show in three days, the first time Bruce has played more 
than once in Denmark on the same tour leg.<br>
It was also one of the smallest venues of the tour, holding only around 
15,000 attendees. As a result the atmosphere inside was intense and the 
temperature hot from the get-go.<br>
Although the two Danish shows were at two different venues, the Herning 
show got the Night Two treatment with a setlist almost unrecognizable 
compared to Copenhagen.<br>
“Long Walk Home” was a rare and welcome opener, “My Love Will Not Let 
You Down” got the arena singing and clapping from the first note, while 
“The Ties that Bind” gave credit to the rumor that had floated 
beforehand that Bruce was going to do the entire River album. That 
possibility, however, was quickly quenched, as the show moved into more 
familiar territory with a triple shot of Wrecking Ball songs. “Death to 
My Hometown” in particular got the crowd moving with its hard punching 
folk riff and the band standing shoulder to shoulder at the edge of the 
stage like a Revolutionary War line of battle.<br>
The small venue allowed the stage setup that’s usually reserved for 
indoor shows in the United States, with an aisle surrounding the entire 
pit section, allowing Bruce to do a rare crowd surf at a European show. A
 perfect landing back on the stage meant that the trust between artist 
and crowd had been sealed, and from then on the show loosened up and 
became full of those moments that make diehards keep coming back for 
more.<br>
While fans climbing up on stage uninvited are not encouraged, even Bruce
 had to smile when one fan somehow managed to get up there and do a cool
 dance. Bruce sent him back to the pit kindly but firmly, but that 
didn’t put a damper on things. The sign request section that followed 
prompted a logistical problem when a “sign” on a woman’s bare and very 
pregnant stomach was held up on the shoulders of what was probably her 
husband. Rather than collecting her along with all the other signs, 
Bruce had a spotlight pointed at her before granting her wish of 
“Tougher Than the Rest”.<br>
The request section continued with two songs from Greetings From Asbury 
Park, including a full-band performance of “For You” and the funky 
version of “Does This Bus Stop” complete with a drum kit vs. bongos duel
 between Max Weinberg and Everett Bradley.<br>
A note to guys who bring a sign request for “I Wish I Were Blind”, as 
someone in the Herning crowd did: be prepared to explain yourself to 
Bruce as to why you ruined your relationship and got dumped. The guy at 
the Herning show willingly complied and got his wish played in a 
stunningly beautiful solo acoustic version with Bruce hitting the high 
notes perfectly in his best crooner voice.<br>
Back on track with the setlisted “Prove It All Night” with the ‘78 
intro, the show went into guitar overdrive. You almost forgot that 
between Bruce’s piercing intro and Nils Lofgren’s supersonic six-string 
coda, there is a killer song that would work just fine on its own, but 
with the guitar work, it becomes something extraordinary.<br>
The guitar attack continued during “Murder Incorporated”, allowing Steve
 to channel his best Sylvio Dante gangster attitude into his axe. Then 
it was time for some slightly more danceable music in the shape of a 
rollicking “Johnny 99” and the swing version of “Open All Night”. At 
this point the temperature in the arena was at the boiling point, with 
both Bruce and crowd absolutely drenched in sweat.<br>
That didn’t mean either side let up. The energy remained extraordinarily
 high during both “Badlands” and “Land of Hope and Dreams”, which 
concluded the main set.<br>
The first song of the encores is often used for a little breather for 
both Bruce and audience, but not in Herning. Bruce went straight into a 
powerful “Born in the USA”, the loud bass notes literally making it feel
 like your clothes were being blown off.<br>
The heat and the noise were starting to take their toll on the front 
rows in the pit. During the second verse of “Born to Run”, the crowd had
 to step in and do the lead vocals while Bruce, with a concerned 
expression, fetched water for someone in the pit who was on the verge of
 dehydration.<br>
Most of the fans in the arena, however, were still able and willing to 
continue. But not Bruce quite yet. The end note of “Born to Run” was 
dragged out for what seemed like minutes while he frantically combed the
 stage for a sign he had picked out earlier. That is, until Steve 
pointed out that the sign was again not the cardboard kind, but was 
drawn on the forehead of a man in the front row. This time the “sign” 
was invited up on the stage for display, and while the band shifted into
 the slow, heavy beat of the requested “Ramrod”, the human sign toured 
the stage and gave each front line member of the E Street Band a kiss on
 their cheeks, finally turning to Bruce, who overbearingly offered his 
own cheek as well. The fan clung on to him a little too long, but not 
for need of attention, but because at this point tears of joy were 
streaming down his face.<br>
More fans, this time of the female kind, were pulled on stage for 
“Dancing in the Dark”, including the now mandatory extra guitarist, and 
the show concluded with “Tenth Avenue” that once again allowed Bruce to 
go deep into the crowd and do the final verse from the podium between 
the pit and the main floor section.<br>
The show didn’t quite hit the three-hour mark, but the crowd was 
exhausted and Bruce was exhausted, and it was a perfectly fulfilling 
ending to a 2½ week run of Scandinavian shows. Those who had been to all
 of them said Herning rivaled the best of them, and many veterans in the
 crowd were ready to put it in the top three of Springsteen shows on 
Danish soil.<br>
At the very least, it proved a Springsteen show in an obscure town in a 
small country can be as good as any show in a world-renowned metropolis.<br>

Notes From The Road: Copenhagen</strong><br>
		<br>
When the E Street Band touched down in Copenhagen a couple of nights 
ago, following arguably their most successful tour of Norway, Sweden, 
and Finland to date, speculation was massive as to how they could 
possibly follow up concerts of the scale and power of the three “album 
shows” in Stockholm.<br>
Walking out on stage, Springsteen greeted the 40,000-strong Copenhagen 
crowd in their native tongue with a smile indicative of a man raring to 
go as the E Street Band launched into an especially fresh-sounding “We 
Take Care of Our Own.” Smiles were rampant in both the band and the 
audience, who were treated to “Two Hearts,” a reminder that Steve Van 
Zandt and Springsteen are happily reunited. Sign requests came early: 
“Loose Ends” elated fans and, somewhat surprisingly, the crowd sang this
 rarity from Tracks right back to Bruce. A fun “Cadillac Ranch” set the 
tone for the rocking theme of the evening, evoking singing from the 
first row to the last, and dancing to match even the best of Nils. 
“Trapped” was especially strong vocally, as Springsteen worked the crowd
 from hushed quiet to screams of musical ecstasy.<br>
At the close of “Spirit in the Night,” Bruce took the opportunity to 
thank Copenhagen and its fans for years of love and support. With that 
came a big surprise: a smile on his face and a flick of his finger 
later, Springsteen announced that the E Street Band would play the whole
 of Born to Run from start to finish. From the signature opening of 
“Thunder Road” to the E Street-defining sax solo of “Jungleland,” Born 
to Run was received gratefully and emotionally. As “Jungleland” closed, 
to the teared-up eyes of thousands, Jake Clemons and Bruce shared a 
magical moment together.<br>
How to maintain the energy from there? “Pay Me My Money Down” made sure 
that any concert-goers still in their seats would be up and dancing, as 
Springsteen led a conga-line around the front of the pit — including two
 additional members from the audience, adorned with carnival-style 
decorations. “Badlands” closed the main set, with Springsteen tearing 
into his guitar and the 40,000 people before him chanting the ’78 
classic’s chorus, synonymous with a crowd lusting for more.<br>
The encore began with a passionate arrangement of “Brilliant Disguise,” 
Bruce singing with conviction. With encore staples like “Born to Run” 
and “Tenth Avenue Freeze-out” already played mid-set, the band reached 
deeper into their bag of tricks, pulling out a rollicking “Light of Day”
 and shaking Parken Stadium with a powerful, four-song stretch of Born 
in the U.S.A. favorites.<br>
Finally, Springsteen invited birthday boy Jon Landau out onto the stage.
 To rapturous applause and an especially giddy Bruce, guitar-adorned 
Landau took the spotlight next to Steve, providing both guitar and 
backing vocals on “Twist And Shout” as a double-shot of classic covers 
closed the show, culminating in “Raise Your Hand.”<br>
Before exiting the stage, Bruce took to the microphone one more time: 
“We’ll be seein’ ya!” As he descended into the darkness with his band 
and manager, the words of the late, great Clarence Clemons rang true: 
“This could be the start of something big”.<br>

Notes From The Road: Stockholm Night #3</strong><br>
		<br>
		 <br>
The E Street Band turned in a picture-perfect, Saturday night big 
stadium show for their third and final appearance at Friends Arena in 
Stockholm.<br>
At the conclusion of “Spirit in the Night,” Bruce once again extended 
his thanks: “This is our last night in Sweden. Sweden’s a very special 
place to us… thanks for making us a part of your lives, and your 
culture… we’re very proud to be part of it.” He then announced that 
tonight the band would be performing the Born in the U.S.A. album in its
 entirety, completing the set started last week with the full album 
performances of Born to Run and Darkness on the Edge of Town.<br>
“Cover Me” was highlighted by sharp, incisive soloing from Springsteen 
and Nils Lofgren as well as a tasteful horn arrangement on the choruses,
 while “Working on the Highway” featured Bruce dancing Elvis-style on 
the center platform. Friends Arena was once again aglow with cell phones
 lighting up from top to bottom during “I’m on Fire.” The entire crowd 
began waving their hands back and forth in unison at the start to “Bobby
 Jean,” prompting Bruce and Nils to raise and lower their guitar necks 
in unison, in rhythm with the crowd.<br>
But perhaps the most classic Born in the U.S.A. moment occurred during 
an amped-up “Glory Days,” which had an enthusiastic Steve Van Zandt 
eagerly making his way down to the center platform to join Bruce for the
 final verse and chorus. “Is the band ready? Are the Swedes ready?” 
Springsteen asked, before launching into the last chorus with Van Zandt 
at his side, mugging for the crowd in a picture right out of the video. 
It was glorious, full-on ’80s-era cheese, live and in person.<br>
After a full-arena sing-along to the end of “My Hometown,” Bruce brought
 out Max Weinberg, Garry Tallent, Roy Bittan, Steve and Nils to the 
front of the stage for bows. He then changed guitars and brought the 
band into a rocking version of “Cadillac Ranch,” which showcased both an
 energetic guitar solo from Mr. Van Zandt as well as some classic Born 
in the U.S.A. tour dance moves from Nils and Bruce at the end of the 
song.<br>
A full “Raise Your Hand” opened the encore, complete with a 
now-drenched-with-sweat Springsteen on the piano, exhorting the crowd. 
As the band ended “Born to Run,” Bruce gestured at Steve to join him at 
the mic. Pointing off into the distance, they said, “Is it? Could it 
be?” before launching into “Rosalita,” house lights on and the audience 
jumping up and down from the floor to the upper levels.<br>
The dance party continued through “Tenth Avenue Freeze-out” until the 
audience refused to let the band go, singing the “Badlands” refrain as 
everyone took their bows. “One more!” Bruce announced to the crowd and 
to the band. “Twist and Shout” brought as many members of the E Street 
Band as Bruce could fit onto the center platform (which was more than 
you think!) before bringing another memorable set of shows to a close 
here in Sweden.<br>

More Notes From The Road: Turku, Night #2</strong><br>
		<br>
If you weren’t in Turku last night, you missed your opportunity. Not 
only did you miss a spectacle of a show from the E Street Band, you 
missed your opportunity to play with them. That’s right, by the end of 
the first show in Turku Bruce had pulled a young Joan-Jett lookalike 
onstage to dance, shred and sing on “Dancing in the Dark.” By the time 
the second night’s show approached the audience and Bruce alike had 
built up a huge head of steam.<br>
Opening the set on the 8th at Turku’s HK Areena found Bruce onstage 
delivering a solo “I’ll Work For Your Love” from the Magic album. The E 
Street Band joined for an opening sequence (which included “Ties that 
Bind” and a crowd-surfing “Hungry Heart”) that led up to “Blinded by the
 Light,” which Bruce simply introduced as the “first song of the first 
album.” In less than an hour’s time Turku was straddling all of E Street
 History.<br>
Bruce snatched up a sign for “Ain’t Good Enough for You” off of The 
Promise, and another one for “Wages of Sin.” Before the show, Bruce 
explained that a fan had been following the tour for years, and wanted 
to hear “Wages of Sin,” “…so that’s what we’re going to play.” He found 
the fan, grabbed his sign, told the audience that “…this is for Nikolas”
 and away we go.<br>
Coming off of a hard rocking sequence, including a Nils Lofgren 
supercharged “Youngstown,” “ Johnny 99,” and “Open All Night,” the band 
launched into “Lonesome Day.” Not to be outdone by the previous night’s 
crowd, Turku’s HK Areena put forward their own show stealer. Rather than
 singing the chorus when Bruce walked him onstage, the young man 
launched into a rap verse! Pausing briefly to yell “Max, give me a 
beat!” the boy delivered an entire, self-composed verse and finished it 
off with a whooping “come on E Street Band!” Later on I managed to trade
 the young man’s notes to his rap for a set list and a promise to bring 
it to Bruce. He got it, by the way.<br>

Notes From The Road: Turku Night #2</strong><br>
		<br>
		 <br>
The second night in Turku, Finland featured an insanely eclectic 
setlist, with material from the entire span of Bruce Springsteen’s 
catalog: mega hits and mega rarities, top ten singles and diehard fan 
favorites. The evening began with Bruce walking out onstage alone in a 
darkened arena, carrying an acoustic guitar and, after a brief greeting,
 launching into “I’ll Work For Your Love” from 2007′s Magic.  The E 
Street Band joined him onstage quickly and went into “Long Walk Home,” 
also from the same record. They went through “The Ties That Bind,” “Out 
in the Street,” and a quick sign request for “Atlantic City” before 
getting to some of the usual Wrecking Ball material.<br>
“Hungry Heart” sent Springsteen back to the mid-floor platform for the 
traditional arena crowdsurf, the audience having taken direction from 
Nils Lofgren’s tweet earlier in the day: “Pit People, when you body surf
 Bruce to stage, suggest depositing him feet first! Head first not in 
our collective, best interest!” Bruce was delivered in the correct 
orientation and appeared pleased with the Finns’ newly acquired skills, 
nodding approval and saluting various sections of the crowd.<br>
A sign collection interval followed as Bruce made his way around the 
stage, gesturing for certain signs and plucking others out of the crowd.
 The first request he grabbed out of the pile was “Blinded by the 
Light,” noting, “This is the first song from my first album. I’m always 
reminded that Clarence was only on two songs because we couldn’t find 
him — but he was on this one.” The Greetings theme continued with a 
lively rendition of “Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?” Next was a song
 that Bruce said had been requested a couple of times: a rare appearance
 of “Ain’t Good Enough For You” from The Promise. For a song that has 
only been performed once in concert (three times total, if you count the
 filming of the 2010 Carousel House performance in Asbury Park, where 
Bruce ran through the song twice), the audience responded as though it 
were a familiar and dearly loved favorite. Fans in the pit were dancing 
and singing every word, and all the way to the back of the venue, arms 
waved in approval.<br>
Not satisfied with the pile already onstage, Bruce went back out onto 
the center platform to grab another sign — a very particular one. He 
noted that the song in question had been requested “over many years, 
every place we go,” before leading the band into the first performance 
ever of “Wages of Sin,” the legendary Born in the U.S.A. outtake finally
 released on the Tracks box set in 1998. ”Wages of Sin” is a dark, 
complex composition that showcases the E Street Band at their best: 
careful phrasing and tone on Bruce’s vocals, suiting the lyrics 
perfectly; delicate piano work from Roy Bittan; precise, muted 
percussion from Max Weinberg, breaking out the mallets on the cymbals; a
 haunting horn refrain in the background. Steve and Garry moved closer 
and faced in toward Bruce. Well rehearsed, the band’s performance of 
this song absolutely did its live debut justice.<br>
The trio of “The River,”"Youngstown,” and “Murder Incorporated” brought a
 little bit of the Reunion tour to Finland, threatening to melt the ice 
underneath the floorboards with the different levels of intensity 
present in all three. “The River” brought the arena to rapt attention, 
while “Youngstown” turned up the temperature with Lofgren’s blistering 
guitar work. Bruce kept encouraging Nils to continue, urging him on 
further as he changed guitars and then, as Nils hit the last few notes, 
rhythmically hitting the body of his own guitar to take the band 
straight into “Murder Inc.” The ensuing guitar battle between Steve and 
Bruce was the two of them at their very best, facing off, nodding and 
shouting approval and encouragement as they each took their turn in a 
shredding, incendiary pile of glorious guitar noise.<br>
Still, many in the crowd remained seated; Bruce looked around the arena 
and recalled a friend informing him the night before that Finns were shy
 people — “you’ve got to encourage them,” he said, they don’t want to 
get up and move their asses around. Once again, Bruce predicted that 
within 90 seconds exactly that would be happening, as Roy’s swinging 
piano led into the jump blues version of “Open All Night.” Clearly, the 
Finnish members of the audience were very, very encouraged, judging by 
the dancing figures all over every level of the HK Areena.<br>
The second night in a city is often notable for its intensity, or its 
energy, or its different setlist; tonight managed to be notable for all 
of these. Although Bruce didn’t make it to Finland until 2003, and 
though this venue was one of the smallest on the tour, the dedication 
and enthusiasm of the Finnish fans is demonstrably comparable to any 
group of fans anywhere else in the world, and tonight’s show definitely 
paid tribute to that.<br>

Notes From The Road: Turku, Finland #1</strong><br>
				 <br>
The sun was shining when the E Street Band took the stage at HK Areena 
in Turku, and the sun was still shining when everyone emerged three 
hours later. Here in this oldest city in Finland, Bruce dedicated a rare
 performance of “This Hard Land” to the local fan group of the same 
name: “We have a fan club in Finland!”  He thanked them for a book 
authored by the community, featuring stories, pictures, and reflections 
about how they came to his music. When Bruce asked who in the crowd was 
part of This Hard Land and received a loud and vocal response, he 
laughed, “I guess we’ll never go hungry in Turku!”<br>
A sign collection interlude took place a few songs later, unusual these 
days, with Bruce spending a fair amount of time reading and musing over 
the requests, continuing to grab more signs out of the crowd. All that 
consideration paid off. The first selection was “From Small Things (Big 
Things One Day Come),” which he introduced as a song that he originally 
gave to Dave Edmunds. The next sign featured a drawing of an old car — 
on a pink piece of paper. Bruce held it up to the camera on Max’s drum 
riser, and he was projected on the large screen behind the stage where 
the audience could see him pointing to the paper, and to the car… and 
then to the paper, and then to the car again… mugging at the camera and 
mouthing “Pink! Cadillac!” several times before turning around and 
launching into the Born in the U.S.A.-era favorite. The song featured a 
robust horn performance from the E Street Horns. Finally, “Brilliant 
Disguise” by request was a tour premiere, powered by strong keyboard 
work from Roy Bittan.<br>
“Pay Me My Money Down” had Bruce bringing the horn section down front, 
and tonight they began to copy his dance moves, much to his obvious 
delight: first Clark Gayton, and then Curt Ramm, began stepping from 
side to side and up and down with aplomb. This might have been what 
inspired Bruce to assemble the entire E Street Band in a line at the 
front step of the stage (with the exceptions of Max and Roy, but even 
Charlie was there on accordion); he grabbed some fans for good measure 
before marching and dancing the entire throng along the stage, down the 
stairs, along the floor, through the mid-floor barrier, across the 
platform, and then back down the other side to the stage again.<br>
The last sign request of the night would be held until the start of the 
encore, as Bruce stepped to the mic with an acoustic guitar. He observed
 that no one ever asks for this song; “Do you work in a supermarket?” he
 asked the requestor, before playing a solo acoustic version of “Queen 
in the Supermarket” from the Working on a Dream album to top off the 
night’s bevy of rarities. At the end of the encores, as he waved goodbye
 to the audience, Bruce announced, “We’ll be back tomorrow night with 
another spectacular!”<br>

Notes From The Road: Stockholm, Night #2</strong><br>
		<br>
The second show at Friends Arena in Stockholm opened with a surprising 
run of rarities: “My Love Will Not Let You Down,” a doubleshot of Lucky 
Town songs in “Better Days” and “Leap of Faith,” along with a 
spontaneous sign request for “I’m a Rocker” from The River. A few songs 
later, Bruce surprised the audience yet again by making a rare excursion
 into a stadium crowd. He climbed up to the edge of the first level 
seating bowl during “Hungry Heart,” where he encouraged fans to share 
his microphone on the chorus; he reciprocated by grabbing an almost-full
 beer in return, running back to the stage with it and exclaiming 
“Swedish beer! I owe you one!” before downing the beverage. (Bruce soon 
pointed in the direction from whence he came, sending security over to 
recompense the thirsty fan.)<br>
Even after the first night’s surprise that was the Born to Run album 
played in its entirety, it was still unexpected to hear from Bruce that 
tonight, the band would be performing all of Darkness on the Edge of 
Town. He again spoke of his love for the city, noting that he was always
 “excited to be back in Stockholm” and that the album would be a 
“special gift from us to you.”<br>
The Darkness portion of the show was executed with an exceptional 
strength and exacting performance. Especially notable: Bruce’s 
overwhelmingly powerful solo in “Adam Raised a Cain”; Roy Bittan’s 
complex and masterful conclusion to “Racing in the Street”; Nils Lofgren
 soloing, twirling and playing the guitar with his teeth on “Prove It 
All Night”; and Max Weinberg’s driving precision behind “Candy’s Room.” 
The audience responded during “Racing in the Street” by holding up their
 cellphones all around the darkened arena — a beautiful effect 
appreciated by all in attendance, including the band, as Bruce saluted 
the crowd at song’s end. At the conclusion of the album, as the entire 
band was brought to the front of the stage for a bow, many in the 
audience began singing the “Badlands” refrain, thinking that the show 
was over because it had already been quite an evening.<br>
However, Bruce was just getting started. In the continued effort to keep
 everyone out of their seats, the band launched into an impressive and 
energetic rendition of the swing-jump blues version of “Open All Night.”
 Bruce brought all of the E Street Horns to the very front platform, 
where they all sang, played, and danced around for an extended 
interlude. “Radio Nowhere” from Magic also kept latter part of the set 
rocking.<br>
The encore began with Bruce explaining how on night one, he’s just 
getting going, night two, he’s starting to get warm… moving similarly 
through night three and onward to night seven, “Because I need Seven 
Nights To Rock!” Tonight, this was the song that featured a brisk but 
respectable band introduction (after missing it the previous evening). 
With all the houselights blazing, the new, shorter “Tenth Avenue 
Freeze-out” was followed by another bonus track, as “American Land” 
brought another amazing Swedish evening to an end.<br>

Notes From The Road: Stockholm, Night #1</strong><br>
		<br>
Tonight’s show at Friends Arena in Stockholm, Sweden started off in 
familiar fashion: “We Take Care of Our Own,” “Out in the Street” for a 
Friday night, and “Wrecking Ball,” along with several other songs that 
one might expect to see in a Wrecking Ball tour show, immediately 
receiving a loud and energetic response from the capacity crowd. 
Business as usual? Not for long.<br>
After “Spirit in the Night,” Bruce strode to the mic, harmonica in hand,
 and began to speak about his great appreciation for the warm welcome he
 had always been afforded in Sweden, dating back to 1975: “Stockholm was
 one of the first cities we came to when we first left the United 
States…it was miraculous to us to be greeted as we are when we come 
here, year after year after year. We want to thank you and all of your 
relatives for making us a part of your life, your country, your 
culture.” He admitted that he had been sitting in his hotel room earlier
 that week, thinking about how to surprise the crowd, and because of the
 country’s long history of supporting his music, he wanted to play Born 
to Run, the album that started it all, from beginning to end.<br>
Responding with shouts and gasps and excited utterances, the audience 
then met Bruce with a stadium-wide sing-along to “Thunder Road” as the 
band began the album performance. Tonight, “Tenth Avenue Freeze-out” was
 brought back to album length, while still featuring the tribute to 
Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici playing on the large video screens 
in the background. A powerful “Backstreets” included the diehard fan 
favorite “Sad Eyes” coda, performed to an almost-silent arena. The 
houselights came on full strength during “Born to Run” and just as 
quickly shut off for the start of “She’s the One.” The infrequent 
“Meeting Across the River” featured a beautiful trumpet performance from
 E Street Horns member Curt Ramm and took us into the finale: 
“Jungleland” had the audience both shouting the lyrics along with Bruce 
as well as coming to complete and total silence for the final verse of 
the song.<br>
Bruce collected several sign requests from the audience in the course of
 the evening, but only one would make an appearance later in the encore:
 the rare early cover “Mountain of Love.” As Springsteen said, “This is a
 song the band used to play, going back to the early ’70s — Michelle 
Moore was not even born yet!” However, instead of bringing on the full 
band, Bruce elected to perform the song solo on acoustic guitar, 
substituting a whistling solo in place of the song’s usual piano one.<br>
A hit parade of Born in the U.S.A. favorites brought the show toward its
 close, including special guest Elliott Murphy on “Glory Days.” After 
capping the night with a rambunctious and energetic “Twist and Shout” 
just as the concert reached the three-hour mark, Bruce stepped to the 
microphone and thanked the audience for coming, reminding everyone: 
“We’ll be back tomorrow night!”<br>

Notes From The Road: Oslo Night #2</strong><br>
	<br>
On night one in Oslo, we had the utterly unexpected in the shape of 
Little Steven crooning “My Kind of Town” to us to open the concert (that
 is, if you don’t count the four song warm up by Bruce himself, which 
was as amazing as it was surprising). But for whatever reason — a Monday
 night, a workday to follow, the second concert of the two to go on 
sale, crappy arena, or a taciturn crowed — that first night, while 
spectacular, never reached the absolutely epic heights that we all know 
Bruce and the band are capable of reaching. So on to night two, when the
 alchemy, the chemistry, the sheer transference of energy between Bruce 
at his peak and crowd at their peak happened.<br>
Of the first 15 songs, we had 11 changes from the night before, the only
 recurring songs being “We Take Care of Our Own,” “Wrecking Ball,” 
“Spirit in the Night,” and “Death to My Hometown.” As a statement of 
intent it could hardly be bettered. From the opener, 1992′s “Leap of 
Faith,” through “The Promised Land” and on to “Downbound Train,” the 
omens of a great evening were right there at the beginning. “Leap of 
Faith” was a particularly welcome airing, a song heard rarely if ever 
these days, given a real shot in the arm by the 2013 E Street Band. 
“Spirit” was notable for the outstanding vocal contribution from a young
 lady in the crowd that seemed to take even Bruce aback. I suppose it 
had to happen: after all these years, he finally found a crowd member 
who could sing!<br>
Fittingly, the real magic happened during “Savin’ Up,” as if Bruce, the 
band and the crowd discovered that they had been… well, saving up. An 
absolutely fantastic version of this soulful song that Bruce originally 
wrote for Clarence, complete with a rap encouraging everyone to check 
the balance in their “love account.” From there we moved in to a darker 
section of the night, with “Atlantic City,” “Murder Incorporated,” and 
“Johnny 99,” all powerful and all delivered with an intent and a menace 
that characterizes the very best shows. Nils Lofgren in particular was 
outstanding on “Murder Inc.,” and the band really shone a light on hard 
times and desperation on “Atlantic City.”<br>
Even the more “standard” part of the set — “Shackled,” “Sunny Day,” “The
 Rising” — all did their part to keep the momentum at a high level… and 
then, “Badlands.” Wow. As an opener or earl number, it’s great. It 
always will be. But late in the show, when the energy is already high, 
well, that’s a different story. It had the crowd not just out of their 
seats but jumping. Several seat-holders were even seen scaling the 
barriers to get on to the GA floor and no one seemed to care. It was 
that good. By the time we made it through the high-energy encore 
(beginning with Bruce alone at the piano for a moving “The Promise”) to 
“Tenth Avenue Freeze-out,” it was clear that we weren’t going to be let 
off lightly here. Not that we wanted to get off lightly! So to cap it 
all, a surprise performance of “Shout” took it all over the top. The 
lights had been on since “Born to Run,” and the crowd responded 
brilliantly. We were dismissed into the night knowing that this was one 
for the ages. You better start savin’ up indeed… we were spent!<br>

Notes From The Road: Oslo, Night #1</strong><br>
	<br>
If Norway had “kidnapped” Steven Van Zandt, as Springsteen told the 
first crowd of the 2013 European tour, then this opening night was a 
return to the scene of the crime. Steve had missed ten concerts running,
 filming season two of his show Lilyhammer while the rest of the E 
Street Band plundered Down Under in March. As he rejoined the 
Springsteen tour here in Oslo for the start of the European leg, it was 
with a hilarious nod to Norway as Steven’s home-away-from home, where 
his popularity might even give Bruce’s a run for its money. After all, 
where else would Steve take the mic — or as Bruce introduced him, “The 
song stylings of Frankie ‘The Fixer’ Tagliano!” — to kick off a show 
with “My Kind of Town” customized for nearby Lillehammer? In character, 
decked out in a snazzy black hat, drink in hand, Steve sang of “majestic
 mountain views all around” as the E Street horn section yet again 
showed its versatility with a propulsive, big band swing. The warm 
welcome-back continued as we moved into more familiar musical terrain 
with “Two Hearts” in the second slot, Bruce and Stevie renewing those 
vows: “It takes two, baby!”<br>
Anticipation and excitement had been high all around, and not just for 
Stevie’s return: dedicated Springsteen fans in Oslo began camping out 
for the show six nights in advance, despite the fact that the E Street 
Band had just played there last summer. And those early arrivals got a 
special treat: before the evening’s main event, Bruce took the stage for
 an impromptu acoustic set, strumming rarities including “All That 
Heaven Will Allow,” “The Fever,” and “Growin’ Up.”<br>
That’s the only part of the show that was a warm-up. With the E Street 
Band literally in full-swing as of the first number, they showed no rust
 whatsoever despite a month off post-Australia; as soon as slots three 
and four, they were blitzing through “No Surrender” and “Badlands.” And 
as in Oz, Bruce brought some rarities to the set that truly wowed. 
“Better Days” was one, a rare Lucky Town song to get the E Street Band 
treatment, and it showed just how much power the 2013 touring unit can 
bring to that underplayed and often underrated ’92/’93 material. The E 
Street Choir, in particular, put a real shine on “Better Days,” and 
you’ve got to hope that other Human Touch and Lucky Town songs are in 
line to bubble up for similar treatment.<br>
An even greater surprise was the tour debut of “Follow That Dream,” an 
Elvis Presley song from 1962 that Bruce originally reworked for the 1981
 River tour; he hadn’t played the song at all in ten years when it came 
out last night in Oslo. The long-lost, inspirational anthem continues to
 resonate and finds a fitting home in the Wrecking Ball set; could it 
also be that Bruce was aware of the occasion, 37 years to the day since 
he hopped the wall at Graceland?<br>
Of course, Bruce and the band mixed in Wrecking Ball standards and 
catalog classics throughout, from the power trio of “We Take Care of Our
 Own”/”Wrecking Ball”/”Death to My Hometown” to the majestic “Thunder 
Road” that closed the main set and the encore openers that followed, 
“For You” (featuring Bruce alone on the piano) and the blistering, 
full-band “Born in the U.S.A.” that often comes out overseas. And so 
begins a massive three-month run, Springsteen and the E Street Band 
having one more night in Oslo before barnstorming across Scandinavia and
 throughout Europe, moving from arenas to stadiums as they follow that 
dream into the summer.<br>

Notes From The Road: Hanging Rock, Night #2</strong><br>
		<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band returned to Hanging Rock for one
 final showdown. Over two and a half weeks the band have performed ten 
exhilarating concerts along the east coast of Australia. Tonight wasn’t 
going to be an exception.<br>
With the sun just hanging on, the band hit the stage and tore into an 
intense reading of Adam Raised A Cain. Candy’s Room was next with 
Bruce’s guitar, and vocals, positively searing. She’s The One Was a sign
 request and the re-appearance of Something In The Night capped of a 
fantastic opening gambit.<br>
While Bruce’s own vocals have been stellar through the entire tour: it’s
 worth mentioning the superb singing troupe of Curtis King, Cindy 
Mizelle and Michelle Moore who bring much to the proceedings. Their work
 on the Wrecking Ball triumvirate of We Take Care Of Own, the Celtic 
swagger of Death To My Hometown and the title track are particularly 
strong.<br>
Looking for another sign, Bruce reached for Hungry Heart. There was no 
crowd surfing tonight: but Bruce did do a lap of the GA area before 
collapsing at Jake Clemons’ feet as he blasted the final few bars of the
 tune on sax. Spirit In The Night has become a perfect slice of 
minor-key gospel. Charlie should take a bow for his organ work, as 
should Bruce who managed to consume everything from “beer to hard 
liquor” as he manoeuvred the crowd.<br>
Grabbing another sign, or three, Bruce gave us a “double shot of The 
Wild And The Innocent” with a sublime E Street Shuffle and the sheer 
poetry of Incident On 57th Street. Supporting artist Jimmy Barnes, who’d
 been joined on stage earlier by Cold Chisel guitarist Ian Moss, 
returned for a duet with Bruce on Tougher Than The Rest. [Jimmy, if 
you’re reading this, you should record it].<br>
Sister Soozie continues to impress on violin, guitar and vocals, while 
Nils tore the proverbial roof off with his solo on Because The Night. 
Next came another request: “This guy’s been following us around for 
weeks, so I’ve gotta play this song”… it was Jackson Cage. Swapping to 
an acoustic guitar, Open All Night was next. As Bruce said earlier in 
the tour, “it’ll take a village of men to replace the Big Man” and the 
five-piece horn section has swung like a gate all through the Wrecking 
Ball dates.<br>
Darlington County boasted a tip of the hat to Honky Tonk Women as the 
band kicked off the opening riff. The song again saw Bruce barnstorming 
the crowd. Shackled And Drawn is a show stopper and the perfect lead in 
to the bright and breezy Waiting On a Sunny Day: which was highlighted 
tonight by a young girl with a lot of pizzazz and the wayward hurling of
 an acoustic guitar which almost took out Max’s cymbal.<br>
Bruce then juxtaposed the light of Sunny Day with a scorched earth take 
on Promised Land followed by Lonesome Day, The Rising, The Ghost Of Tom 
Joad and Badlands.<br>
Bruce took a moment to thank his Australian fans, alongside those of you
 who have travelled far and wide to see him. The first part of the 
encore took the night into interstellar overdrive with Born In The USA, 
Born To Run, Dancing In The Dark and the usual closer, 10th Avenue 
Freezeout.<br>
Of course, we couldn’t let Bruce leave that easily. Reading the sold 
crowd just right, Bruce and the band pulled out a sublime Rosalita (Come
 Out Tonight). Pure magic, it was a testament to the, now augmented, 
spirit of the foundation of the E Street nation, Messrs Bittan, 
Weinberg, Tallent and Lofgren.<br>
So, what can a poor boy do except sing for a rock and roll band? The 
full house didn’t want to leave and neither did Bruce. Up next came a 
Tex-Mex style sing-a-long version of Twist And Shout. The house was duly
 brought down.<br>
It’s been a privilege to see these shows as a member of the audience, and an honour to report on them for BruceSpringsteen.net<br>
With ten stunning gigs behind him: Bruce, you came, you saw and you 
rocked. Australia, we bore witness to the heart stopping, pants 
dropping, hard rocking, booty shaking, love making, Viagra taking, 
history making, legendary E Street Band. Wow, they really were that 
good.<br>

Notes From The Road: Hanging Rock, Night #1</strong><br>
	<br>
Folklore, myth and urban legend surround the Hanging Rock region: it’s 
burnt into the psyche of many Australians. Parked cars have been known 
to roll backwards up the surrounding hills. It’s the kind of place, 
where, an eerie, other worldliness, hangs in the air. Tonight the Rock 
received a visitation from the Jersey Devil himself.<br>
A rural location, the actual rock served as the perfect backdrop as the 
day began with a fine set from relative newcomers, The Ruebens, followed
 by a top notch selection from much loved local hero, Jimmy Barnes.<br>
The 17, 000 people in attendance made this the largest audience of Bruce
 Springsteen’s, Australian, Wrecking Ball tour. It’s also the biggest 
number of paying customers the site has ever hosted. With the sun still a
 good half an hour away from dipping, Bruce opened up with the call to 
arms of Badlands. With Max’s cymbals still splashing, Bruce tore into 
Prove It All Night. There was no ’78 Intro’ this time around: the band 
dove straight into the tune allowing Nils to pull out an absolute 
blinder of a solo that was capped off not only with a pirouette, but 
with the Hendrixian move of playing the final notes with his teeth. The E
 Street Band was taking no prisoners.<br>
High Hopes hit a funky groove courtesy of Tom Morello’s guitar lines, 
while the band hit a Wrecking Ball sweet spot with three tunes from the 
album; the superb We Take Care Of Our Own, the title track and Death To 
My Hometown. Hearing those lines ‘tonight all your dead are here’, in 
the shadow of the rock, carried a particular gravitas.<br>
After a hair-raising crowd surf, Bruce finished Hungry Heart and moved 
into the jazz infused Spirit In The Night. Looking for a sign, Bruce 
admitted that you’ve “been hard at work on your crafts at home – I’m 
impressed!”<br>
The sun had dropped like a dollar coin in a parking meter. The hills 
were now pitch black as Bruce led the band into The River. His 
elongated, pitch perfect, falsetto, as the song faded, was goose bump 
material. Jimmy Barnes re-appeared for a duet on Tougher Than The Rest. 
It was quite a moment to see two iconic figures singing harmony.<br>
Asking to see more signs, Bruce was now using the prepared set list as 
mud map, while adding a double shot from the Nebraska album, Atlantic 
City and Johnny 99. As bootleggers still ponder what the electric 
Nebraska may, or may not, sound like: there’s a fair chance, if it 
exists, it won’t be better than this.<br>
Pay Me My Money Down is always a concert highlight. It was followed by 
another venture by Bruce out into the audience, with Nils in tow, for 
Darlington County, then Shackled And Drawn and Waiting On A Sunny Day.<br>
“I’m Waiting To Sing With The Boss,” read the sign, and one lucky boy, 
who nailed the ‘C’mon E Street Band line’, earned himself a spot-playing
 guitar as well.<br>
The mood changed as the band began a no holds barred Promised Land 
followed by, possibly, the most intense reading of The Rising that 
they’ve played, on this Australian tour to date. A show-stopping 
reinvention of The Ghost Of Tom Joad came next.<br>
Thunder Road kept up the momentum and featured the charismatic Jake 
Clemons, on sax, playing his Uncle’s glorious solo. With the main set 
over, Bruce took delight in reading some of the more interesting signs. 
“It’s good practise for my future as a game show host – when the music 
thing goes sour.”<br>
In the hopes of inspiring a pregnancy, one woman asked for her belly to 
be rubbed for good luck. Mr Springsteen complied and we hope if the 
couple in question do fall pregnant they return the favour by dubbing 
their offspring, “Bruce.” If I Should Fall Behind was gifted to her, 
while Because The Night was played for another sign holder who intended 
to propose to his partner while the band played it.<br>
If there had been a roof on this venue, Born To Run would have torn it 
off. The encore was a knockout. Another sign read “Play Glory Days For 
My Family In The Cheap Seats” and Bruce did just that. Dancing In The 
Dark saw a young woman mimic Ms. Cox’s trademarked moves, while Tenth 
Avenue Freezeout remains an inspiring tribute to the band’s fallen 
comrades: Clarence and Danny.<br>
A fantastic show, we look forward to bringing you the final in this 
series of Notes From The Road as Bruce and the band deliver ‘another 
spectacular’ tomorrow night.<br>
Is there anybody alive out there tonight?<br>

Notes From The Road: Melbourne, Night #3</strong><br>
		<br>
		<br>
		 <br>
“Good evening Melbourne, are you ready for the finale?” And so began the
 last round of Bruce Springsteen’s three night stand at the Rod Laver 
Arena. First song in was the Australian tour debut of Long Walk Home, 
followed by the greatest rock single ever written by a man over 50, 
Radio Nowhere.<br>
The American critic Robert Hilburn once described Bruce’s live take of 
My Love Will Not Let You Down, a song from the relative margins of his 
catalogue, as being as rousing as the national anthem in concert. He was
 right. Plucked from the crowd as a request, the E Street rhythm axis of
 Mighty Max Weinberg and Garry W. Tallent nailed the track to the floor:
 while Bruce, Nils and Tom traded high-octane guitar lines.<br>
Better Days had its’ first airing, with a band, since 2003 [thanks 
uber-fan Bernie], and was quickly followed by a mighty triumvirate from 
the Wrecking Ball album; We Take Care Of Our Own, the title track and 
Death To My Hometown.<br>
After another mighty crowd surf during Out In The Street, Bruce returned
 to the stage to inform us that his socks were stolen, but his boots 
were still on. “It’s miraculous!”<br>
Lost In The Flood saw Charlie shine on keys as Bruce turned up the heat 
with some searing guitar work. It followed a stark reading of Factory, 
which was another debut for Australians. Does This Bus Stop At 82nd 
Street had the E Street Band reverting to sassy, big band, swagger. One 
member of the audience came with a multiple-choice placard: Candy’s Room
 or Incident On 57th Street? Melbournians voted and Candy’s Room took 
off like a Lear jet.<br>
What happened next was worth the price of admission alone. If Bruce had 
taken a bow and left the stage right here, no one would’ve felt 
short-changed. The band leaned into a muscular version of Youngstown and
 followed it with a ‘knock-down-drag-em-out’ reading of Murder Inc. 
Stunning, Springsteen himself was slack jawed afterwards and said what 
we all thought, “ Whoa, what was that?” Inexplicable, if you were in the
 room you witnessed that “third” kind of heat that only great bands know
 how to conjure up.<br>
Pay Me My Money Down became a big-room sing-a-long as Bruce took the 
horns and singers for a virtual line dance through the room. Twins in 
the front row got a special shout out for their dedication and were 
rewarded with I’m Going Down. Born In The USA was a massive album in 
Australia, as it was around the world, and anything Bruce plays from the
 record goes down a storm.<br>
Waiting On A Sunny Day appeared and guitar tech Kevin Buell treated us 
to a master class in how to catch an airborne acoustic guitar, which was
 followed by Bruce’s epic knee slide.<br>
The principle set was played out in fine fashion with powerhouse 
renditions of The Rising, The Ghost Of Tom Joad [possibly the best 
version of the Australian tour so far] and Badlands.<br>
After a beautiful/hard rocking take on Jungleland Bruce thanked the 
audience and assured us that now that his kids are older, and out of the
 house, he’ll be down here a lot sooner than we’ve come to expect. Born 
To Run, Dancing In The Dark [replete with Bruce in sunglasses] and Tenth
 Avenue Freezeout rounded out the finale before Bruce gave us ‘one more’
 with a firebrand American Land.<br>
An absolute stunner of a gig, the next stop on the tour is Hanging Rock.<br>
The highway is alive tonight …<br>

Notes From The Road: Melbourne, Night #2</strong><br>
		<br>
Tonight, with the house lights up, Bruce Springsteen and The E Street 
Band hit the stage and tore into Badlands. As the band were attempting 
to merge into We Take Care Of Our Own, the audience wouldn’t allow it. 
The capacity house was still chanting the Badlands’ refrain, making a 
move onto the next song impossible. And, this was only the opener.<br>
Bruce’s first words were “Melbourne, bums out of seats.” They got the 
message and Bruce kept the energy up by grabbing a sign from the front 
rows, two songs in, and he shook the dust of a rollicking Cadillac 
Ranch.<br>
Wrecking Ball seems to have struck a chord with Australian audiences. 
Veering off the set list Bruce spotted another sign, which marked the 
Australian tour debut of Downbound Train. Great art is about holding an 
audience in a moment. It might be an audience of one, or it might be a 
stadium full of people. Downbound Train, replete with its compelling 
narrative, does just that.<br>
Hungry Heart saw Bruce head out to the ramp that runs through the middle
 of the venue. He was offered a floppy flat cap and he took it. “I used 
to have one like this, but I lost it,” he mused, “I may as well do the 
song that goes with it.” Enter, Spirit In The Night.<br>
The jazzy swagger vibe of Bruce, pre-Born To Run, stuck around as Bruce 
called for E Street Shuffle. It’s a sublime groove made more remarkable 
when played by this sixteen-piece band that can turn on a dime. Major 
Lance would be proud.<br>
Bruce started to prowl the front rows looking for more signs. “Tommy’s 
trembling!” Bruce plucked two signs for Red Headed Woman. “We don’t know
 it,” offered Bruce, “Tommy doesn’t know it at all.” After playing 
around with various keys – Bruce settled for the “people’s key of C”. 
Springsteen began the song, and the band finished it: with both Soozie 
and Nils taking fine solos.<br>
Next came the stunning triumvirate of Because The Night, She’s The One 
and Open All Night. Standing next to an uber-fan with a stop-watch, 
Bruce has over delivered on his promise to get the crowd out of their 
seats in 90 seconds, tonight he did it in less that thirty.<br>
As Open All Night morphed between rockabilly and Dixieland, Bruce kept 
the momentum up with Working On The Highway, Darlington County and 
Shackled And Drawn. A darker mood descended as Bruce and Morello traded 
vocals on a song that has become a cornerstone of the tour, The Ghost Of
 Tom Joad.<br>
Thunder Road, where the Melbourne audience sang every word back to 
Springsteen, closed the main set. Then there was the sheer rush of Born 
To Run: with the house lights up again it was possibly the most dynamic 
reading of the song on the tour so far.<br>
Dancing In The Dark saw the customary dance on stage, but first Tom 
Morello got to shake his money-maker with one sign maker. “Tommy’s got 
moves,” admitted Bruce before cutting the rug himself. Next came a 
stunning Rosalita [Come Out Tonight]. Exhausted Bruce collapsed and 
signaled to the audience he had zero in the tank, he had nothing, he was
 rung out. Enter Nils with water and sponges and, like Lazarus, Bruce 
rises again for the show’s closer Tenth Avenue Freezeout.<br>
Melbourne. Seriously. Did we expect that? To say it was a special gig would be understating it.<br>
Hey ho rock and roll deliver me from nowhere.<br>

Notes From The Road: Melbourne, Night #1</strong><br>
	<br>
Ever since the E Street Band hit the opening strains of We Take Care Of 
Our Own in Brisbane ten days ago, the jungle drums have been beating all
 down the east coast of Australia Finally, after ten years, Bruce is 
back in Melbourne for three nights at the Rod Laver Arena. The word of 
mouth regarding the Wrecking Ball shows has created a buzz across the 
continent. Already, Bruce and the band, in two towns, over five nights, 
have played over sixty different songs. Tonight they kick off with a 
killer take of Out In The Street: five minutes into the show Bruce is 
already on the floor of the arena. If ever a joint was jammed, it’s this
 one. Next up Bruce calls out Promised Land, which is followed by the 
Australian tour debut of a stunning Something In The Night.<br>
Tonight the band arrive on stage with a head full of steam: Wrecking 
Ball is terrific and so is Death To My Hometown, then Bruce’s spots the 
largest sign you’ve ever seen for Hungry Heart. Soon he’s in the stands 
turning down a marriage proposal, for obvious reasons, and leading the 
audience in a massive sing a long.<br>
So “after crossing continent after continent, island archipelagos and 
shark infested waters”, Bruce soon finds himself on stage holding a, 
wait for it, … a rubber shark. The next big question was “can you feel 
the spirit?” The room certainly did.<br>
The band is now so simpatico with Australian audiences that a relative 
obscurity like High Hopes is going down like a back catalogue classic.  
Signs on this trip are grabbing Bruce’s attention: especially when 
they’re battery powered like the one for The River or the multiple 
option sign that saw Prove It All Night, with the ’78 Intro’, the winner
 over Incident On 57th Street.<br>
Here it’s impossible not to recognise the mighty axis of the original E 
Street Band. Roy Bittan is without peer, Garry W Tallent is melodic and 
rock solid and Max Weinberg is simply… the great Max Weinberg! Nils 
Lofgren’s contribution to Prove It All Night deserves its’ own fan site:
 he began by playing acoustic guitar in the introduction and finished 
with a blinding solo on the electric guitar replete with pirouette.<br>
As the house lights pulsed to Max’s bass drum the band dug deep on 
Seeds, the ending of which was performed twice! Johnny 99 now sounds 
like a lost rockabilly classic that Sam Philips missed. By the time Pay 
Me My Money Down was in full swing, Bruce had seven girls up on stage to
 dance. Next came Darlington County, a superb Shackled And Drawn and the
 night’s other big showstopper Waiting On A Sunny Day.<br>
This time around the main set was rounded off by the soulful Land Of 
Hope And Dreams: a song which highlights the divine vocal contributions 
of Curtis King Jnr [who plays a mean cowbell to boot], Cindy Mizelle 
[who co-stars with Bruce on Shackled And Drawn] and Michelle Moore. The 
Rising, Badlands and The Ghost Of Tom Joad all impressed before the 
encore.<br>
Then came a four-part last stand that few artists could match, let alone
 top. Born In The USA tore the roof off the place, Born To Run remains 
as magnificent now as it did the day Bruce and producer Jon Landau 
signed off on the record, Dancing In The Dark made a girl’s 16th 
birthday one she’ll always remember and 10th Avenue Freeze Out, in this 
show’s context, is uplifting and profoundly moving.<br>
Melbourne: Bruce Springsteen is in town. As he said as the lights 
finally faded, he’ll be “back on Tuesday for another spectacular”.<br>
Can you feel the spirit?<br>

Notes From The Road: Sydney, Night #3</strong><br>
	<br>
As Big Boss Man was being piped through the arena’s PA system a familiar
 voice interrupted the tune. “Good evening Sydney, are you ready to 
rumble?” And so it began: the final night of Bruce Springsteen’s Sydney 
run. Being a Friday, it was a party night. The overwhelming feeling in 
the room was unbridled joy.<br>
Somewhere earlier down the road Bruce had promised that at the end of 
any given show he wanted his audience to leave the venue with ‘your back
 sore, your voice hurting and your sexual organs stimulated’. It’s a 
fair bet that tonight he had the trifecta.<br>
The opening gambit saw the re-introduction of We Take Care Of Our Own, 
Wrecking Ball and the jaw-dropping tour debut of Night. The latter 
highlighted Jake Clemon’s fine sax playing and, from my seat in the 
stands, the terrific bass of the Tennessee Tiger, Garry W Tallent.<br>
By the time Hungry Heart rolled around, the people of Sydney were in 
fine voice. Bruce took to the ramp that runs through the middle of the 
arena and was offered a beer. In the tradition of our former Prime 
Minister Bob Hawke he ‘skulled’ it like a champion and forever sealed 
his place in the hearts of Australians.<br>
The energy in the room was something else; one fan requested an arm to 
be signed for tattooing. Bruce obliged. My City Of Ruins was an early 
standout: it’s an emotional moment in the show, but this evening Bruce 
took the song to another dimension.<br>
Australian fans have now fully embraced the idea of bringing placards 
with requests and Bruce is happy to oblige. This time around he reached 
for Growing Up, which was followed up with E Street Shuffle. God bless 
the good men and women of Sydney that brought the next three signs. 
Prove It All Night was performed with the ’78 intro’, then came Bruce’s 
cover of Jimmy Cliff’s Trapped and finally a beautiful reading of The 
River which was capped off by Springsteen’s falsetto.<br>
Tonight it was as if Bruce arrived on stage already in fifth gear, but 
he kept raising the stakes. Pay Me My Money Down had the audience on 
their feet; Working On The Highway and Darlington County kept them 
there.<br>
Waiting On A Sunny Day remains a stand out and set the scene for the 
final four songs of the main show: Backstreets, The Ghost of Tom Joad, 
Badlands and a gorgeous reading of Thunder Road.<br>
After thanking Sydney for supporting his music for all of these years, 
and promising to return sooner, next time, Bruce delivered an encore 
that will be forever etched in the memory banks. Instructing the mixing 
desk to turn up Roy’s keyboard “loud”, the band crashed into a titanium 
tough take on Born In The USA, a killer Born To Run, Dancing In The Dark
 and Tenth Avenue Freeze Out. But … that wasn’t enough. Prowling the 
foot of the stage Bruce grabbed a sign calling for Rosalita (Come Out 
Tonight) and he hit it out of the park.<br>
An incredible night, an incredible set list and three hours of power 
from the hardest workingman in show business… nobody does it better. 
Look out Melbourne …<br>

Notes From The Road: Sydney #2</strong><br>
	<br>
		 <br>
At the start of the Australian tour Bruce Springsteen crouched at the 
apron of the stage at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre and shared his 
philosophy on the magic of rock and roll. “In love, art and music,” he 
said, “one and one has to make … three”. It’s that intangible element 
that lurks somewhere in the ether that makes the human heart leap up and
 pay attention. Tonight, that rock and roll magic arrived like a 
visitation.<br>
Always prepared to ring the changes, Bruce opened the set with a stark 
solo acoustic reading of Devils And Dust. Next came the Australian debut
 of Last To Die from Magic: the latter is an album track that, tonight, 
was performed with the zeal of a hit single. The Ties That Bind kept the
 momentum up and then Bruce rolled out a stunning Darkness On The Edge 
Of Town.<br>
Out In The Street was tonight’s first big sing-a-long. Bruce hit the 
B-Stage and then decided he preferred to sing on the guardrail as fans 
steadied the great man’s legs as he belted out the choruses. Bruce dug 
deep for Does This Bus Stop At 82nd . He was now using the ‘set list’ as
 a provisional guide. Looking out over the ever-growing sea of signs, 
Promised Land was next.<br>
“Don’t tempt me…” he said, before finally heading out into the audience 
to bring back a few more placards to share with the band: then came a 
trio of classics from the Born In The USA album: Cover Me, No Surrender 
and a sublime I’m On Fire.<br>
The signs took on various shapes and sizes and are put together with 
varying degrees of effort. Still, why bring a sign when you can bring a 
large book and write on multiple pages instead? It was smart thinking 
from “Karen”: the lady in question had various pages of her book read 
out by Bruce and earned herself that coveted spot shimmying on stage 
with the man of the hour during Dancing In The Dark. It was a perfect 
fan moment.<br>
It’s good to see High Hopes get another airing. Everett shone out front 
with Bruce as he banged the drum and Tom Morello channeled Hendrix as he
 played the solo with his teeth!<br>
Australians, in large seated arenas, do generally sit down. This is an 
anomaly that Bruce is determined to change. His ace in the sleeve is 
that magnificent slice of road tripping rockabilly, Open All Night. As 
he predicted, 90 seconds later the room was grooving and every one, who 
could, stood up and shook their money-maker.<br>
The final furlong, before the encore, saw the tour debut of Lonesome 
Day, followed by a searing Ghost Of Tom Joad and a full throttle 
Badlands. The encore took the audience into another zone altogether. 
Jungleland is a masterpiece and was received as such. Bobby Jean was a 
knock out and then came that beautiful curve ball that had every diehard
 fan delirious, the Detroit Medley. Right in front our eyes Bruce 
brought to life, in that one song, the history of 50’s rock and roll. As
 the man himself said “one and one has to make three”. Well, tonight it 
did.<br>

Notes From The Road: Sydney, Night #1</strong><br>
	<br>
The E Street tour bus has hit Sydney and Bruce kicked off the first of 
his three gigs in the city with a sold out show at Allphones Arena. 
Packed to the rafters, Bruce picked up on the spirit of St. Patrick’s 
Day and began with a full-blooded American Land, which was followed by 
an absolutely searing Prove It All Night. More signs are starting to 
appear at the Australian shows and three songs in Bruce reached into the
 audience: Adam Raised A Cain was the result.<br>
With the twin guitar attack of Nils and Tom, the opening gambit had the 
house rocking, but it was Bruce’s own scorched earth lead guitar parts 
that impressed the most.<br>
Early on Bruce let the audience know what had been on his mind ever 
since he took that plane to ‘fly thousands of miles over shark infested 
waters’. His last Sydney gig went down in infamy as the night the power 
went out and then went out again… and again. Tonight Bruce welcomed the 
audience to the ‘scene of the great power failure’ before adding ‘it 
took nine years for my penis to grow back!’ Thankfully, the electricity 
was cranking tonight and Bruce turned the venue into one giant 
sing-a-long for Hungry Heart.<br>
Back on stage it was time for the stunning one-two-punch of Candy’s Room
 [yes, it’s worth mentioning Bruce’s guitar parts again] and She’s The 
One. It’s gets better: next up was Youngstown.<br>
It’s great to see that Bruce, even with new man Morello on board, is 
still ringing the changes with the set list. High Hopes got its second 
airing and Pay Me My Money Down had its’ Australian debut. The Ghost Of 
Tom Joad, with Tom sharing verses, is becoming one of the corner stones 
of the show. It’s worth tipping the hat to Charlie on organ who is 
pulling stunning organ sounds, particularly on Spirit In The Night.<br>
Badlands, like everything off Darkness that featured tonight, was 
fantastic. So much so, that, when the lights dimmed for the encore, the 
audience kept singing … and singing. As the show hit the final furlong 
and the house lights were up for Born To Run, Bruce pulled out another 
jewel: a fantastic cover of Moon Mullican’s rockabilly classic, 7 
Night’s To Rock. Giving it his all, Bruce headed over to Roy’s piano, 
crouched down alongside the pianist, and started banging his head on the
 keys. So the gig is now in that zone where day-to-day life is 
forgotten. We’re all here on Planet Bruce.<br>

Notes From The Road: Brisbane Night #2</strong><br>
<br>
48 hours after playing a stunning opening night gig on his Australian 
tour, Bruce Springsteen has already topped it. Opening the show with his
 interpretation of the Havalinas’ High Hopes, Bruce kicked off the night
 in high gear. If the song was unfamiliar to marginal fans, the energy 
generated on stage wasn’t. Tom Morello lent the song some scorching 
guitar, while Jake Clemons had his time to shine next on the follow up, 
The Promised Land.<br>
It was a Saturday night, and there was a buzz in the room. Bruce made it
 his mission to get the capacity room on their feet and he did … 
numerous times. After Wrecking Ball and Death To My Hometown, Bruce 
headed into the crowd for a terrific sing-a-long rendition of Out In The
 Streets. Australian audiences haven’t quite mastered their part in 
Bruce’s crowd-surfing display, but we’re working on it and the great man
 was finally delivered back to the stage intact.<br>
After a cool preamble to Spirit In The Night, the band were off and 
running on a fantastic streak of songs that took the mood of the night 
into interstellar overdrive.<br>
Nils Lofgren shone on the introduction to Incident On 57th Street but it
 was Bruce that drove it home with an absolutely jaw-dropping guitar 
attack. The River was nothing short of mesmerizing and it’s worth noting
 Bruce’s falsetto is still in full working order. Atlantic City was 
re-invented with a chorus that belongs to gospel while another Nebraska 
cut, Open All Night, was Bruce’s ace in the sleeve for the getting the 
entire venue ‘off your asses in 90 seconds … wait, make that 120 
seconds’. It worked.<br>
Over the course of his career, Bruce has only played Brisbane seven 
times. The first time, in 1985, was part of the Born In The USA tour. It
 was one of his first stadium shows, and, judging by number of vintage 
Born In The USA t-shirts in the audience, it obviously had a big impact 
on the city. One lucky boy, around eight or nine, mimicked Bruce’s look 
from the cover of the album – with a red cap in his back pocket. It 
earned him a spot on the microphone during Waiting On A Sunny Day, which
 was only bettered by Bruce suggesting the pair embark on a knee slide 
in the song’s final bars. Super cool: it’s up there with the great knee 
slide from the Superbowl.<br>
Alongside the core material from Wrecking Ball, which features heavily 
on the tour, Bruce kept ringing the changes in the set list. Taking a 
sign request he began his encore, sitting alone at the foot of the stage
 for an acoustic reading of Blinded By The Light.<br>
Sparks certainly flew on E Street. Only two shows into the tour, Bruce 
is digging deep into his back catalog. An incredible evening, the next 
stop is Sydney. Buckle Up!<br>

Bruce Returns To Australia<br>
Brisbane Entertainment Centre, March 14</strong><br>
<br>
After a ten-year hiatus Bruce Springsteen has returned to Australia to 
deliver the latest instalment in what really is the greatest rock and 
roll show on earth.<br>
There’s no pyrotechnics or sleight of hand, the show is built on the 
intensity of one man’s physical presence and a songbook written over his
 entire adult life.<br>
Playing Australia as part of his ongoing Wrecking Ball tour, Springsteen
 now fronts a 16-piece band that has the unique ability to turn on his 
proverbial dime. Additional singers, percussion and a five-piece horn 
section augment the core E Street Band. The musicians bring to life 
Springsteen’s vision of fusing rock, folk, and gospel, with a large dose
 of soul, into a revue that clocks in at over three-hours.<br>
Springsteen, playing to a capacity house, opened the night with the 
first single from Wrecking Ball, We Take Care Of Our Own. Then, tipping 
his hat to Brisbane, he delivered a terrific take on The Saints, Just 
Like Fire Would. Inhabiting the song as if he had written it himself the
 tune was delivered with the zeal of a man playing an encore.<br>
Sadly, the E Street Band is now without the late saxophonist Clarence 
Clemons and organist Danny Federici. Springsteen acknowledges their 
presence throughout the night.<br>
Like all great art, Springsteen’s show has the ability to be not only 
rousing, but also moving. Early on he acknowledges the “walking with 
ghosts” that we endure in adult life, none more so than in the soulful 
lament My City Of Ruins. Pointed lyrics from Wrecking Ball, and beyond, 
which deal with injustice, hardship, or, in the aftermath of the GFC, 
financial and moral bankruptcy, are often underpinned with an uplifting 
melody or a little gospel in the choruses. Witness Johnny 99, which 
displays Springsteen’s gift for portraiture and is re-invented as a fire
 and brimstone slice of rockabilly.<br>
Still, above all else, Springsteen in concert reinforces a shared 
communal sense of sheer joy. A showman par excellence, Springsteen plays
 everything from the rock and roll star to the outsider, showman to 
ringmaster. Highlights are numerous: there’s the Celtic punk of Death To
 My Home Town, the sing-a-long Hungry Heart, Nils Lofgren’s guitar 
excellence on Because The Night and the Bo Diddley-esque beat on She’s 
The One that’s tougher than a Detroit muscle car.<br>
The big question for fans is how would guitarist Tom Morello fit as a 
substitute for Steve Van Zandt? You needn’t worry. Van Zandt has his own
 special place on E-Street and Morello’s guitar playing is freakishly 
good, while his singing on The Ghost Of Tom Joad was a standout.<br>
Springsteen has the ability to make a large venue feel small. If you’re 
in the front pit, be prepared: you might be expected to catch the great 
man if he decides to crowd surf. By the time the encore rolled around, 
Springsteen had delivered a glorious three hours of power. An important 
artist of his or any generation, Springsteen remains possibly the most 
vital front man of the modern era. Long may he run.<br>

The Guardian<br>
<br>
Springsteen's fans: 'You believe in Bruce; Bruce believes in you'<br>
As new documentary Springsteen &amp; I is released, Laura Barton explores the extraordinary devotion of The Boss's fans<br>
<br>
The stall is jumbled high with T-shirts: short-sleeved grey marl, and 
white and black, all printed with album covers, with live photographs, 
tour dates set out against red, white and blue. It is one of many stalls
 that line Via San Carlo tonight, and the proprietor is a short, dark 
mollusc of a man, sharp eyes watching the steady stream of people 
rolling down the street.<br>
<br>
"How much?" asks the loud, slow voice of the tourist to my right. 
"Quanto costa?" he says, louder, and points towards a Wrecking Ball 
shirt. His head is large and square and buzz-cut at the sides, and he 
wears the loose, nondescript clothes of the American abroad. "Ten," says
 the vendor, and splays both his palms. The American unfolds a crisp 
pink note from his wallet.<br>
<br>
By the fountain in the square, a crowd has gathered. Police officers 
lean against their vehicles and look on, unruffled. Spectators – young, 
old, the fervent and the merely curious, press their faces to the 
barrier; a middle-aged woman stands on tip-toes and strains to see, 
chattering to her friend in excitable German. The night is warm. People 
lean out of windows and spill on to balconies; they dance and chant and 
whistle, and it feels as if the whole of the Piazza del Plebiscito is 
bathed in a peculiar golden euphoria, a giddiness that stretches from 
the Royal Palace to the church of San Francesco di Paola. Because 
tonight, Bruce Springsteen plays Naples.<br>
<br>
To attend a Springsteen concert (and I have attended many) is quite 
unlike attending any other show. There is the music itself, of course – 
over three hours of hits and rarities and crowd-pleasers from a 40-year 
career played quite impeccably. And then the tireless spectacle of a 
stadium performance that is honed and polished, yet still somehow feels 
effortless and intimate. But then, there is also the fans.<br>
<br>
Springsteen fans are an unusual breed, marked by their unwavering 
dedication, by their bright-eyed belief. You see them on the tube to his
 London shows, with their matching bandanas, their blue jeans and white 
T-shirts, grown men with their bald heads painted in stars and stripes, 
fervently discussing setlists and encores. You catch them down the front
 of his shows, in the legendary "golden circle" – the space before the 
stage, reserved for the most devoted. You find them on messageboards, 
debating the minutiae of Bruce footage from Phoenix in 1978. It is a 
level of fandom that goes far beyond record collections and band 
T-shirts, beyond concerts attended or even the long, low chorus of 
"Bruuuuuuuce" that precedes every live show. This isn't the giddy, 
squealing obsession of the teenage girl, but a kind of slow-cooked, 
long-steeped love for an artist. And it is rooted not just in his music,
 in his lyrics, but in the idea of Bruce Springsteen himself, in what he
 has come to represent.<br>
<br>
This remarkable kind of musical faith is now the subject of a new 
documentary, Springsteen &amp; I, a film made up of self-recorded 
fan-footage – from the Danish guy with Glory Days tattooed on his arm, 
to Kitty, the young American trucker, finding dignity in the lyrics of 
Nebraska, and the couple together for 28 years, dancing around their 
kitchen to Radio Nowhere. Not to mention the long-suffering husband, 
forced to attend countless shows by his Boss-loving wife ("What would 
you say to Bruce if you met him?" she asks. "Shorten your concerts," he 
replies.) It captures all the pure, absolute, wonderful devotion of the 
Springsteen fan, and offers some inkling as to why this artist means so 
much to so many. "You trust Bruce," says one contributor. "Bruce isn't 
going to let you down. You believe in Bruce; Bruce believes in you."<br>
<br>
I find the T-shirt-stall tourist near the beer stand. Mike is here from 
Pennsylvania. He is 52 and tells me he works in an office job – "white 
collar, shuffling papers," he sighs. He has come to Italy with his 
brother, and the pair will attend two Springsteen shows – Naples tonight
 and Padua in a week's time. It is not the first time Mike has travelled
 overseas to see The Boss – in 2006 he followed the Seeger Sessions tour
 to Ireland. And, of course, he has seen him play countless times back 
home in the States.<br>
<br>
"I found Bruce right around the time I got divorced," he says. "I mean, I
 knew him before then, but that was when I first heard Tunnel of Love. I
 put it on and it was immediate. I thought: this guy knows what I'm 
going through." For a while, he says, his Springsteen infatuation took 
over: every conversation in every bar he ever drank in seemed to drift 
back to Bruce; he tried to tell co-workers, friends, family about the 
transformative power of this music; he remembers once bursting into 
tears on a date as he tried to describe the importance of the song 
Tougher Than the Rest. "I was like a missionary, preaching Bruce to 
anybody I found," he laughs.<br>
<br>
Nowadays, the fever has abated somewhat. Though he is still a massive 
Springsteen fan, he no longer tries to convert strangers, and he keeps 
his old tickets and programmes and memorabilia in the garage. Mike's 
second wife is understanding. "It's like I got this old war buddy or 
something, and she's good with me spending time with my buddy. She knows
 we've been through something together."<br>
<br>
This is a common feature in many Bruce fans' testimonies – the idea that
 his music somehow helped them through a difficult time in their own 
lives, through breakups, unemployment, health problems, or simply coming
 of age. In the documentary, Kitty, the college graduate who was unable 
to find work in her field and so became a truck driver, explains how 
listening to Bruce makes her feel that "the more physically demanding my
 job is, the more important I am". One fan who wrote to me recently 
explained how the song Born to Run had got him through high school. 
"That song was so exciting and invigorating, it gave me a new lease of 
life – rather, a new purpose in life."<br>
<br>
Part of this appeal lies in the intimacy of Springsteen's songs, and his
 willingness to paint the lives of ordinary people, blue-collar workers 
in small-town New Jersey, struggling to make ends meet, to shoulder 
their responsibilities, yearning for the simple escape of youth and 
rock'n'roll and a fast car. There are nicknames, recurring characters, 
streets, venues, specific screen-doors, specific porches, specific 
moments in a life rendered so real you could touch them. As one fan puts
 it in the film, listening to Springsteen's lyrics "is like looking 
through someone's family photo album and looking at their life and 
smelling their coffee … and feeling their sadness … and they're 
triumphing." And then he cries.<br>
<br>
In 2012, the New York Times writer David Brooks headed to Europe on a 
Bruce pilgrimage of his own, following the Boss to Spain and France. 
"The passion among American devotees is frenzied, bordering on cultish,"
 he wrote in a subsequent article. "The intensity of the European 
audiences is two standard deviations higher." He noted, in particular, 
the peculiarity of seeing 56,000 Spaniards singing along to Born in the 
USA, of the bafflement at seeing so many people in thrall to 
Springsteen's tales of small lives in New Jersey. "How is it they can be
 so enraptured at the mere mention of the Meadowlands, or the Stone 
Pony, an Asbury Park, NJ nightclub?" he wondered.<br>
<br>
Craig Finn is the lead singer of the Hold Steady, a Minneapolis-born 
band that wears its Springsteen influence on its sleeve. Their sets will
 occasionally incorporate a Bruce cover – Atlantic City, say, or Girls 
in Their Summer Clothes, and on one occasion they had the honour of 
performing Rosalita with the man himself at a tribute concert in New 
York.<br>
<br>
But Bruce's influence upon Finn has run deeper than a few cover versions
 and an echo of the E Street Band sound. "Springsteen's lyrics have 
influenced me a lot, especially his use of characters," he explains. 
"When I heard about the Magic Rat or Weak-Kneed Willy, I wanted to know 
more about them. When I started writing songs myself, I used characters 
and tried to go back to them, satiating my wish for more info on those 
guys."<br>
<br>
Finn also pins part of Springsteen's appeal on his evolution as a 
songwriter, with the fact that, unlike many of his peers, he has "grown 
with his age … he writes songs for adults. Adults today have been 
listening to rock'n'roll their whole lives. They often turn to it for 
comfort and guidance. Bruce is still there for them, not all nostalgic, 
but current too."<br>
<br>
<br>
Perhaps this extraordinary canon of work, this range of experience, this
 willingness to grow as a songwriter, is what has allowed such a range 
of fans to connect with his songs. There are tales of being hard-up as 
well as of victory, songs that are politically charged or heartbroken, 
longing for the past or hoping for the future – these can capture the 
imagination of the factory worker and the mechanic as well as the 
high-paid executive and the housewife. I was struck, while researching 
this piece, by the breadth of his appeal – the tearful little boy hauled
 from the crowd in Naples to sit in his arms and sing Waiting on a Sunny
 Day, the twentysomethings who emailed me to share their Damascene Bruce
 moment, the lifelong fans, the recent converts, the Poles, the Brits, 
the Jersey girls.<br>
<br>
For Natasha Khan, who records as Bat for Lashes and produced a memorable
 cover of I'm on Fire, part of Springsteen's appeal has always been a 
certain mutability, and his songs' ability to apply to both men and 
women. "Dancing in the Dark and I'm on Fire were always my favourites 
because they are at once really sexy and melancholic," she explains. "I 
chose to cover I'm on Fire because I love to tell a man's story from a 
girl's perspective. I wanted to pull out the darkness of the lyrics, the
 yearning."<br>
<br>
Even since the early days, Springsteen has inspired a striking level of 
infatuation. Long before he was The Boss, long before he launched the E 
Street Band, Bruce fronted a group named the Castiles. Last year, in an 
extensive profile in the New Yorker, David Remnick recounted how the 
band would play everywhere from sweet-16 birthday parties to 
rollerdomes. One day, they were booked to perform at a psychiatric 
hospital in Marlboro, New Jersey. "A gentleman dressed in a suit came to
 the stage," Remnick wrote, "and, in an introductory speech that ran 
some 20 minutes, declared the Castiles 'greater than the Beatles'. At 
which point a doctor intervened and escorted him back to his room."<br>
<br>
Peruse the talk threads of Backstreets.com, a website dedicated to all 
things Bruce, and you will have a taste of the depth of his fans' 
devotion. Backstreets began in 1980 as a magazine for fans of The Boss 
and the music of the Jersey Shore, but today its website allows devotees
 to discuss not only setlists and favourite songs, but also the size 
jeans Bruce might wear, shared MP3s and video footage from 35 years ago.<br>
<br>
Tim Hiley describes himself as "a prominent member of the Bruce 
Springsteen forum". He posts under the name Part Man Part Monkey – a 
reference to a track on Springsteen's 1998 archive release Tracks. "I've
 posted 7,182 times on the forum," he says, "and have set up various 
game threads like the Guess the Setlist Competition and the Song Cup 
(Where I draw all of Bruce's songs against each other in an FA Cup style
 format)."<br>
<br>
Hiley, who is British, devotes a lot of time to the thread and the 
competitions, but by far the biggest draw on his time is the Setlist 
Threads, where he works out the setlist from Twitter and posts it onto 
the forum in a live play-by-play update. "For the US tour last autumn 
and spring, I did pretty much every show and it often meant staying up 
until 5am UK time in order to post the setlist on the forum," he says. 
"While this may seem sad to some – probably many! – to me, it's simply 
following something that has touched my life on such a profound level. I
 find comfort and joy in his music. By posting on [the forum] with 
similar minded and dedicated people is a pleasure and if I give up 
several hours a day to post about The Boss and his legendary shows with 
the E Street Band, then I consider that a very enjoyable few hours."<br>
<br>
Another Backstreets forum contributor, Nothing But Road, recounts how 
his love for Bruce fell into obsession in 2008, when he began to collect
 bootleg recordings. "I began to connect the tours and albums with that 
particular time in Bruce's life and drew new connections between my life
 and his," he explains. "When I was in my first relationship and it all 
turned sour, Tunnel of Love was the album I turned to. When things got 
better and I found a new girl it was Lucky Town. When I couldn't find a 
job and get out of [working] nights it was Dancing in the Dark: 'I get 
up in the evening and I ain't got nothing to say/ I come home in the 
morning feeling the same way.' Or Open all Night: 'The boss don't dig me
 so he put me on the night shift.'" He first saw Bruce live at Hyde Park
 in 2009 and was moved to tears. "It felt so overwhelming," he recalls, 
"because this was the guy whose music I allowed into my life … to become
 my life."<br>
<br>
The blurring of the man and the music is something that is often found 
among Springsteen fans. Although he has weathered his own personal 
struggles, Springsteen has come to represent something upstanding and 
wholesome to many. He is politically engaged, left-leaning, with a 
passion for the underdog (this week he dedicated a song to Trayvon 
Martin, for instance) and seems to set out an example of what can be 
achieved by kindness, consideration and pure hard graft. He tours often 
and long, his shows frequently last past three hours; on stage he works 
hard as an entertainer: covering all areas of the stage, playing 
sometimes obscure requests, and frequently channelling the role of a 
kind of southern Baptist preacher. "Where we wanna go, we can't get 
there by ourselves," he tells the crowd. "We need YOU! Can you feel the 
spirit?" he asks, and hands are lifted aloft and waved in this new kind 
of church.<br>
<br>
"I think Bruce is a special rock star because he is indeed a huge 
celebrity but seems human and modest, even," says Craig Finn. "He has a 
commitment to honesty that resonates. He seems to understand the average
 person's life even if he is anything but average. I think his belief in
 himself and the redemptive power of rock'n'roll inspires (almost) 
everyone who comes across it."<br>
<br>
"Bruce can seem warm, open, friendly – an ordinary guy, someone you can 
imagine being friends with – because he is genuinely interested in other
 people," says the legendary rock critic Greil Marcus. "And because he 
acts consciously to set himself apart from the arrogant, entitled, 
dismissive rock star, both because he doesn't want to be like that and 
because he is aware of how damaging to the – let's not say image but the
 sense-of-self – his fans hold of him and hold him to."<br>
<br>
Marcus cites as his favourite example a day in 2000, when Springsteen 
visited a seminar he was teaching at Princeton on Prophecy and the 
American Voice. "My older daughter had run into him at a party in New 
York … and told him about the class," he explains. "He said he'd like to
 take it – she said, I'd tell him he'd have to do the reading."<br>
<br>
The reading that week was no mean feat – Allen Ginsberg's Wichita Vortex
 Sutra from 1966, accompanied by a recording of Ginsberg performing the 
entire, very long poem with an orchestra of downtown New York musicians.
 But characteristically, Springsteen put in the hours.<br>
<br>
"Bruce arrived early, and we went in together," Marcus recalls. "I 
introduced him – everyone knew who he was – and he sat down around the 
seminar table and for the next three hours carefully, subtly, took part 
in the conversation. He had, he told me later, been very affected by the
 poem, and had an argument he wanted to make about it, but he did this 
by speaking only in terms of something a student said, responding, and 
eliding his statements into questions. People then took up things he'd 
said, so that he was able to turn the discussion without ever appearing 
to.<br>
<br>
"That's a very specific situation, but I think many fans glimpse that 
sense of self in Bruce's music, songs, self-presentation – and can 
imagine, and even do imagine, themselves and him interacting in their 
own lives. Certainly for some people that crosses over into the kind of 
identification and obsession that some people outgrow and some people 
don't."<br>
<br>
In 2007, the writer Sarfraz Manzoor published Greetings from Bury Park, 
an account of the impact of Bruce Springsteen's music on his own life, 
and its role in helping him leave his home town of Luton. Today, he has 
not outgrown his obsession (he is currently writing a screenplay of his 
book) but it has shifted somewhat. "In my 20s and 30s, I believed being a
 Springsteen fan meant travelling the world and clocking up as many 
concerts as I could manage," he explains. "I was wrong – the point of 
loving his music is not to become obsessed by him but to make the best 
of your own life so you don't let the best of yourself slip away."<br>
<br>
But for others, the enthusiasm has yet to mellow. And perhaps it is even
 Bruce's own dedication and work ethic that makes his fans put in their 
own hours. Jeff Paterson has attended more than 40 Springsteen shows 
over the past 33 years. This week, Paterson wrote to tell me about a 
time he showed particular dedication to his musical hero: having bought 
tickets for two successive shows in St Paul, he flew to Minnesota from 
his home in California, with the intention of meeting up with his 
daughter Shannon, who would be flying in from Bismarck. When Shannon's 
flight (and the next one) were cancelled, Paterson told his tearful 
daughter: "I've got a rental car and I'm coming to get you." The trip 
was 440 miles one-way and took in a blizzard and a highway closure. 
Making it back to St Paul for the first show, the following day Paterson
 was hit by a nasty bout of food poisoning, but still he made it to the 
second show and spent much of it in a wheelchair in the first aid zone. 
But it was worth it, he says, since it was at this show that Shannon was
 pulled up on stage to dance with Bruce to Hungry Heart. "My adrenaline 
must have kicked in [then], I rush back to the floor to see my baby 
crying, tears of joy and tears of worry! Then she sees me and everything
 is alright!"<br>
<br>
Back in Naples, I am crushed down the front of the crowd, pressed right 
up against the barrier in the golden circle. It is raining now, the warm
 night turned to drizzle and then to torrential downpour, the moon 
near-full, obscured by clouds and umbrellas. Still they hold their signs
 aloft – American flags, a detailed depiction of the Springsteen family 
restaurant not far from the city, and song requests for Rosalita and I'm
 Goin Down and the polite query "Can I dance with Stevie?"<br>
<br>
The mood, even rain-soaked, even drenched, is rapturous. Faces upturned,
 hands aloft, a complete stranger wraps his arm around me and together 
we sing Prove It All Night in an Italian lilt. At the end, Bruce comes 
to the stage alone to play an acoustic encore of Thunder Road, a song he
 remembers playing here on his very first visit to Naples.<br>
<br>
The crowd spills out up the Via San Carlo, past the T-shirt stalls and 
the ice cream shops, still floating, still on fire, still singing those 
final notes of their song of devotion. And as I walk back to my hotel in
 my head I hear Bruce's voice addressing the rain-sodden crowd: "We're 
here tonight because what we need to do we can't do by ourselves," he'd 
bellowed, as he always did. "We need you. We need you. We need you," he 
cried. "Can you feel the spirit? Can you feel the spirit now?"</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Preview- Bruce Springsteen at Leeds 2013<br>
The Yorkshire Post<br>
July 24, 2013</strong><br>
<br>
The Wait is finally Over<br>
After years of false dawns, rumour and speculation and hopes being 
raised only to be dashed once again, Leeds can now boast a venue which 
has the potential to attract the very biggest names in the entertainment
 business.<br>
<br>
And if last night’s opening showcase was anything to go by, the future 
looks bright for the city’s First Direct Arena. Bruce Springsteen, the 
legendary American singer-songwriter who is so aptly known as The Boss, 
performed with the E Street Band in the most anticipated gig of the year
 in Yorkshire.<br>
<br>
While last night was publicised as a pre-launch show before Sir Elton 
John officially opens the 13,500-capacity arena in September, 
Springsteen’s appearance will always be the one with which the £60m 
venue’s opening night is associated.<br>
<br>
Famed for the length of his sets – the longest of which lasted for a 
staggering four hours and six minutes in Helsinki in August last year – 
Springsteen welcomed the crowd with a blistering opening salvo of tracks
 including Roulette, The Promised Land and Hungry Heart during which the
 63-year-old veteran performer crowdsurfed.<br>
<br>
<br>
He welcomed the audience with a simple “Hello Leeds!”<br>
<br>
As a measure of his popularity around the world, the gig in Leeds is one
 of the most intimate shows that Springsteen will play on his global 
Wrecking Ball tour. He performed to a 71,000-strong crowd at London’s 
Wembley Stadium in June and the remainder of the UK and Ireland leg of 
the tour has taken in well-established – and far bigger – venues.<br>
<br>
Tickets for the show in Leeds sold out within minutes when they went on 
sale in February, and fans have been arriving since last week to ensure 
that they were able to secure a prime spot. A “golden circle” for just 
600 fans was set up in front of the stage, and among those who managed 
to get a coveted place was Laura Stellin, 29, from Milan in Italy, who 
was the first in the queue after arriving at the arena on Friday 
afternoon. She had been staying at the Premier Inn opposite the arena 
each night before checking in every four hours during the day to ensure 
she kept her place.<br>
<br>
Miss Stellin, a radio assistant who has seen Springsteen more than 30 
times as far afield as New York, Paris and Stockholm, said: “It was so 
important for me to be here. The gig was the highlight, but what I love 
is meeting so many new friends at each show – I have made so many 
friendships.”<br>
<br>
<br>
Much had been made of the First Direct Arena’s sophisticated sound 
system, and the actual design of the venue which ensures a clear view of
 the stage for the whole audience. The proximity to the stage ensured 
something approaching an intimate feel to last night’s concert – which 
is some achievement for an arena gig.<br>
<br>
Julian Soden, 55, from London, travelled overnight from Springsteen’s 
previous show at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff to be at the 
performance in Leeds.<br>
<br>
He said: “This is such a huge deal for Springsteen fans and also such a 
huge deal for Leeds, it is an amazing arena. Elvis and Sinatra are no 
longer with us, so Springsteen really is the biggest artist around.”<br>
<br>
The run-up to the show has not been without controversy, however, as 
Springsteen fans who missed out voiced their anger that the £65 tickets 
were being re-sold for as much as £1,400.<br>
<br>
Debbie Skinner, 51, and Reed Hillen, 60, both travelled from America to 
be at last night’s gig, with their transatlantic trip also taking in 
Springsteen’s shows in Cork last Thursday and his forthcoming 
performance in Kilkenny on Saturday.<br>
<br>
Miss Skinner, a special needs teacher from Denver in North Carolina, has
 seen Springsteen as many as 120 times – although she admitted she has 
lost count. The couple paid £180 for each of their tickets from a resale
 internet site.<br>
<br>
Mr Hillen, an attorney from Tupelo in Mississippi, said: “I first saw 
Springsteen only three years ago, but within 10 minutes I was hooked. It
 is a long way to come, but boy, was it worth it.”<br>
<br>
Terry and Yvonne Fossen, from Yeadon in Leeds, also managed to secure a 
spot at the front. Mr Fossen said: “I have been so excited, and the gig 
lived up to all our expectations.”<br>
<br>

</strong><br>
LEEDS ARENA: It is rare that a gig truly deserves a five star review.<br>
<br>
But for the 13,500 fans who left the inaugural show at the First Direct Arena in Leeds, there can only have been one verdict.<br>
<br>
How often do you see a man approaching pensionable age crowd-surfing, 
downing beers handed to him from the audience and bringing a whole 
family from the front of the crowd on stage with him to dance to one of 
his best known tracks?<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is the consummate performer who undeniably lives up to
 his nickname of The Boss. He is famed for his live shows, but his gig 
in Leeds was something very special.<br>
<br>
Whether it was the first occasion that you had been to a Springsteen 
gig, or the 100th time like many of the die-hard fans who had travelled 
from across the globe for the concert, this had something for everyone.<br>
<br>
There were the rarities, hand-picked by Springsteen with his tradition 
of plucking sign requests from the crowd. There was Local Hero, Gotta 
Get That Feeling and an unexpected - but nonetheless hugely enjoyable - 
performance of the Creedence Clearwater Revival classic, Bad Moon 
Rising.<br>
<br>
But the biggest cheers were always going to be reserved for the tracks 
which have become synonymous with Springsteen’s live shows.<br>
<br>
The Promised Land was followed by Hungry Heart, during which Springsteen
 made his way along a walkway that split the standing section of the 
crowd, before crowd-surfing back to the stage.<br>
<br>
A single spotlight was cast on Springsteen as he struck up the chords to
 the title track of his latest album, Wrecking Ball, which gave one of 
the many spine-tingling moments throughout the show.<br>
<br>
His forays into the crowd saw him grab two beers and then down them, a 
huge cheer erupting when he drained the last drop from each.<br>
<br>
And that really is the essence of a Springsteen show. His lyrics are 
renowned for their deep sentiment, the battle of the underdog to do what
 is right when facing adversity.<br>
<br>
But taken in the context of a live show, it is equally about celebrating
 all that is good about life - a joyous interlude to forget about the 
trials and tribulations of what is thrown your way.<br>
<br>
Springsteen himself recognised the efforts that fans display to travel 
huge distances for his shows. He dedicated a rare performance of Secret 
Garden, best known from the soundtrack of the 1996 film, Jerry Maguire, 
to those fans who had followed him on the European leg of his tour.<br>
<br>
The encore included the ever-present Born To Run and Dancing in the 
Dark, during which Springsteen brought the family from the front of the 
audience on stage with him - a heartwarming twist on his usual habit of 
helping women up from out of the crowd during the song.<br>
<br>
There was a touching tribute to the E Street Band’s saxophonist Clarence
 Clemons, who died in 2011, and accordion and keyboard player Danny 
Federici, who passed away five years ago, when their images were 
projected on to the big screens either side of the stage during Tenth 
Avenue Freeze-Out.<br>
<br>
A second encore saw Springsteen take to the stage on his own, armed only
 with an acoustic guitar and harmonica to bring the show to an 
emotionally-charged climax with performances of If I Should Fall Behind 
and Thunder Road.<br>
<br>
After 29 songs and a set which stretched for three hours and four 
minutes, Springsteen left the stage and paid tribute to the newest venue
 in Yorkshire, saying: “This is a great building, and a great place to 
play.”<br>
<br>
Other performers already booked to appear at the First Direct Arena 
include Elton John, Rod Steward and Leeds’s own Kaiser Chiefs.<br>
<br>
But the simple fact is Springsteen is going to be an impossible act to follow.</div>

Rousing Bruce Springsteen puts new Leeds Arena to the test</strong><br>
The Boss played the first-ever gig at the £60m, state-of-the-art concert venue. It looks fantastic, but can it deliver?<br>
<br>
<br>
Driving toward the new Leeds Arena yesterday, I found myself thinking 
about what big indoor concerts in the city used to be like. The only 
reasonably sized venue was the old 5,000-capacity Queens Hall, a bleak 
former tramshed thathosted the likes of Thin Lizzy and Duran Duran, and 
sounded like an echo chamber. The eerie sound certainly suited Joy 
Division, who gave an astonishing performance there at the 1979 Futurama
 festival, but my abiding memory of the place (now a car park) is that 
the grey floor came off on your clothes when you sat down.<br>
<br>
How times have changed. The new purpose-built Leeds Arena is the venue 
the nation's third-largest city has wanted for decades, and it may 
revolutionise live music in the north. The arena houses 13,500 people, 
cost £60m to build, looks like a giant space pod and was apparently 
modelled on an insect's eyeball. But does it deliver as a live venue?<br>
<br>
I'm here to see Bruce Springsteen, who last played Leeds (at the 
open-air Roundhay Park) in 1985. Now he is playing his first arena show 
in six years with the E Street Band after personally asking to "road 
test" the new venue before its official opening in September. The buzz 
in the area has been at fever pitch all week, but by 6pm, the car park 
machines are malfunctioning, and there are still long queues outside at 
7.20pm – 20 minutes after the Boss was due onstage. But inside, jaws are
 dropping. The lady next to me surveys the building's sleek, minimalist 
interior of concrete and lush red seats and exclaims: "It's beautiful."<br>
<br>
Springsteen finally hits the stage and the first 20 seconds are drenched
 in Queens Hall-like echo. But the problem is instantly fixed and the 
crowd seems to levitate. I may as well tell you now what I was texting 
friends during and after the gig: Bruce Springsteen at Leeds Arena is as
 great a rock'n'roll concert as I've ever seen.<br>
<br>
The thing is, I've never been a fan of his. Someone once lent me a badly
 recorded tape of the album Born in the USA and I only cared for Dancing
 in the Dark. I've spent years with my eyes glazing over while 
misty-eyed devotees told me, "But to get Bruce, you've got to see him 
live." It's true.<br>
<br>
The venue helps. Although it has almost the capacity of the rival 
Manchester Arena, it doesn't feel like a shed. Where most arenas are 
designed for basketball, this one was purpose-built for the pop 
experience. The tiered seating was cleverly designed to face the stage 
(rather than surround it) and it raises quickly, so the capacity is far 
greater than it appears and the arena experience feels surprisingly 
intimate. A wander around confirms crystal clear sound throughout, 
backing up the venue's claim that there are no bad seats.<br>
<br>
I am lucky enough to get in the standing area in front of the stage, and
 a walkway through the floor means that every time Springsteen takes a 
stroll, a good number of the audience are close enough to touch him. But
 right to the back, the crowd are on their feet and dancing. People are 
hugging each other and spittle lands on my arms as people shout 
requests. It's like going to a giant church: I've never known a crowd 
atmosphere quite like this, even at football.<br>
<br>
Some moments will stay with me – and surely everyone else here – 
forever: Bruce downing two fans' pints, one after the other, during 
Darlington County; Bruce crowd-surfing; Bruce getting an entire family 
up to dance with him during Dancing in the Dark. Then there's the moment
 the video screen behind him fails and a Boss-led chant of "Leeeeeds" 
brings it flickering back to life, which may be an astonishing example 
of what Springsteen says is the "eternal redemptive power of 
rock'n'roll". I don't know more than a quarter of these songs about 
factories and working men and cars and girls, but I find myself punching
 the air and singing every word of Because the Night; writing 
"life-affirming" and "I feel like I could cry" in my notebook; reeling 
backwards with the sheer velocity of Born to Run. Springsteen makes what
 should be crass rock postures look sincere and primal. He ventures 
toward self-parody (a 63-year-old man displaying rippling muscles 
through a wet T-shirt?) but, crucially, never crosses the line.<br>
<br>
Somewhere in this three-hour road-to-Damascus moment, I observe that the
 toilets are lovely (if misleadingly signposted, so yours truly pays a 
visit to the ladies), that corporate sponsorship is only visible outside
 the concert hall and that drinks are typically canned and overpriced 
(although, very untypically, hand-pulled local ale is available in the 
upper-tier bars). The friendly security people kindly place our drinks 
in a tray so I can attempt the impossible feat of carrying liquid 
through a Springsteen crowd that is undergoing some form of spontaneous 
self-combustion during Land of Hope and Dreams.<br>
<br>
The lighting can't be faulted, but the Boss plays the entire last hour 
with the house lights up, making every person and the building itself 
part of the show. When I drive past the arena later, the space pod is 
glowing red, white and blue in tribute to its American performer.<br>
<br>
In the next few weeks, the arena will host Elton John, Rod Stewart and 
Leonard Cohen. This first night may prove impossible to follow, but 
thank you Bruce and Leeds Arena for one of the best parties the city has
 ever had.<br>
<br>
And the Boss's verdict on the venue? "A beautiful building, and a great place to play."</div>

<br>
JULY 21, 2013<br>
Belfast<br>
<br>
Belfast was treated to a pre-show five-pack of stunners by Bruce on solo
 acoustic guitar: “Surprise, Surprise”, “Maria’s Bed” (sign request), 
and “Growin’ Up” opened the set, followed by another sign request, a 
gorgeous partial rendition of Roy Orbison’s “In Dreams,” and “This Hard 
Land.” “See you in a little while!” he told the ecstatic crowd before 
heading backstage.<br>
<br>
The main event tonight stayed close to the set list, though not entirely
 of course. Belfast was treated to an unusual show studded by several 
classics from the Nebraska album as well as The River. The festivities 
began with Marvin Gaye’s “Can I Get A Witness” playing as the band took 
the stage, seguing smoothly into “This Little Light of Mine.” “Good 
evening everybody! We’re so glad to be here tonight!” Bruce shouted to 
the capacity crowd which stretched as far as the eye could see.<br>
<br>
“The Ties That Bind” next featured Jake, warmly cheered on the sax. On 
the heels of this was an intense “Jackson Cage” with a blistering Little
 Steven guitar break. The intensity of the show was assured as the 
percussive “She’s The One” was next, Bruce punctuating the song with 
yips and yelps, a man possessed. This song, early on in the night, 
clearly established the showmanship of this extraordinary band.<br>
<br>
Bruce went out into the crowd to collect song request signs and stacked 
them up on the stage, grabbing one and placing it in front of his mike 
stand: “Reason to Believe.” Steven’s guitar shored up the Bo 
Diddley-esque melody as Bruce growled “make it dirty” before launching 
into his harmonica solo. It was a strong, slamming version of this 
classic, further upping the ante and assuring us all we were in for 
quite a night.<br>
<br>
Another ‘Nebraska’ song followed, “Johnny 99,” featuring Soozie on 
violin, Clark on trombone, Curt on trumpet, and Jake on sax. The horns 
joined Bruce on the small front stage roaring as the song reached its 
impassioned climax. The ‘Nebraska’ mini-set continued with “Atlantic 
City,” the audience lustily singing along.<br>
<br>
At this point Bruce grabbed another sign and showed it to the audience: 
“Nebraska” at which a collective appreciative sigh went up. There was 
near complete respectful quiet during this solo acoustic version of the 
velvety voiced tale of Charlie Starkweather’s murder spree.<br>
<br>
Another sign request thrilled the crowd, “Prove It All Night (78 
version).” This song almost more than any other really exhibits 
perfectly the resplendence and transition of the 1978 E Street Band to 
the 1984 E Street Band to the current E Street Band. Making the leap 
from 1978 to the current tour, “We Take Care Of Our Own” was next, 
followed by “Wrecking Ball.” “So raise your glasses Belfast! Let me hear
 your voices call.” This was succeeded by the fierce rallying cry of 
“Death To My Hometown.”<br>
<br>
“The River” came next, chillingly beautiful on this weather-perfect 
summer night as many thousands of Northern Irish voices sang along with 
the lyric. Steven’s acoustic guitar strummed as Bruce exquisitely keened
 the melody at the end, followed by a harp solo that could break your 
heart.<br>
<br>
The genius of this artist, this band, and this show is that each 
succeeding song almost wipes away what came before in pure awesomeness. 
Explaining that many fans follow the tour from city to city, Bruce said,
 “we try to do something we haven’t done or that we haven’t done in a 
long time. This is Steve’s favorite song!” At that they went into a 
stone-cold perfect version of the rarely played (even during ‘The River’
 Tour) “Fade Away.” You would have thought it was 33 years ago, so 
closely was this nailed. Charlie shone on organ, a fitting tribute to 
the much-loved and missed Danny Federici.<br>
<br>
As we all caught our breaths, “Open All Night” provided a dramatic 
change of pace with its psycho swing by way of Kansas City arrangement. 
Roy’s piano and the horns were true standouts on this one, which also 
featured a call and response with the audience. “Hey Ho Rock and Roll 
deliver me from nowhere!” Bruce chanted and one could only think truer 
words were never spoken.<br>
<br>
Next we rolled into a “Born in the USA” trifecta: the ultimate road trip
 song “Cadillac Ranch,” the rollicking “Darlington County,” and the 
beloved “Bobby Jean.” On the heels of these classics was “Shackled and 
Drawn” from ‘Wrecking Ball’ and, but for the fact that the show was 
outside in a huge open field, the house was effectively brought down.<br>
<br>
“Come on Belfast – help me out!” Bruce called as they next swung into 
“Waiting on A Sunny Day,” tonight’s guest vocalist being a tiny girl in a
 pink and white hat with a marvelous lack of stage fright. “The Rising” 
exhorted us all to come on up and “Badlands” ferociously ended the main 
set. As the band took their bows, the “Badlands” chant was ferociously 
continued by the crowd.<br>
<br>
Stating, “this goes out for Belfast,” the band eased into the 
neo-spiritual “Rocky Ground,” showcasing the incredible Michelle Moore 
on vocals, the crowd swaying and singing along to this beautiful song 
that has more than earned its true and rightful place as a prodigious 
Bruce Springsteen anthem.<br>
<br>
The encores went full throttle with “Born In The USA”, “Born to Run,” 
and “Dancing in the Dark.” As the familiar notes of “Tenth Avenue 
Freeze-Out” started Bruce jumped around the stage like a boxer ready to 
hit the ring, his energy at a fever pitch, feeding off the crowd. 
“Belfast! Belfast! Belfast!” he screamed before a frenzied reading of 
“Shout!” containing band introductions.<br>
<br>
“Belfast!” he called and the crowd yelled back “Bruce!” to which he 
responded, “You’ve just seen the heart-stopping, pants-dropping, 
house-rocking, earth-quaking, booty-shaking, Viagra-taking, love-making,
 legendary E STREET BAND!” As “Shout!” roared to its conclusion Bruce 
roared, “I’m just a prisoner – of rock and roll!” Thousands of Northern 
Irish hands were raised in the air, testifying.<br>
<br>
“This Little Light of Mine” reprised the beginning of the show, after 
which the revved-up crowd returned to the “Badlands” chant. One more 
treat for Belfast: Bruce on solo acoustic guitar performing “Thunder 
Road” sent them into the night, fortified with the magnificent power of 
rock and soul music.<br>

Cardiff<br>
July 23, 2013<br>
<br>
“There are good Bruce shows, there are great Bruce shows, and then 
there’s Cardiff!” – to quote my friend Helen Jones who had queued up for
 three days and was lucky enough to see tonight’s show from the front of
 the pit. But you didn’t need an up close vantage point to know you were
 witnessing something extraordinary tonight. As in past tours, as the 
clock ticks down to the inevitable end, Bruce pulls out all the stops 
and incites the band to go full out crazy with him. Tonight was such a 
night.<br>
<br>
“Good evening Cardiff!” Bruce called to the cheering crowd as the band 
took the stage and plunged into “This Little Light of Mine,” taking no 
prisoners from the get go. Another difference at this show was that, in 
contrast to the recent outdoor shows in Ireland, this one took place 
inside a stadium with a closed roof, therefore capping in the energy and
 letting it ricochet around inside into every single human body onstage 
and off. Since it wasn’t outside we also got to see once again the full 
magnitude of the amazing lighting design on this tour.<br>
<br>
Grinding his guitar manically against the mikestand, Bruce next plunged 
into that brutal anthem of teenage angst, “Adam Raised A Cain.” The horn
 section and the choir added a new and powerful dimension to the song 
aided by Max’s furious drumming. The audience chanted along with the 
melody, fully in the zone already by the second song.<br>
<br>
After collecting signs from the audience for song requests, Bruce chose 
“Prove It All Night” to follow next. “We’re gonna do an easy one first.”
 As the song roared to its conclusion, Nils spun around with his 
trademark guitar solo, a man possessed.<br>
<br>
Flashing a sign for “TV Movie” to the audience Bruce proclaimed, “This 
has never been played partly because it’s completely ridiculous. I kinda
 remember how it goes…Key of D!” After teaching the band the chords on 
the spot he called, “Professor, are you ready? The Professor is very 
important on this.” They gamely launched into the song and Bruce sang it
 with a broad grin. “You heard it first! You heard it last!” he called 
afterwards as we all savored the magical moment of hearing something 
that had never been performed live before.<br>
<br>
Another sign next, this one for “Cynthia.” “These are odd songs! Rarely 
played!” Bruce commented on the signs he’d gathered. “This is Steve’s 
favorite of all time!” he told the delighted crowd. “This is for the 
girls. Let me hear you scream!” Thousands of Welsh females were happy to
 oblige. “That’s the sound we’re working for!” he grinned as they 
launched into this rollicking love song which was included on the 
‘Tracks’ box set as an outtake from ‘Born in the USA.’<br>
<br>
Diverting from the playful mood he’d exhibited for most of the show so 
far, Bruce plunged into a ruthless version of the classic “Roulette” he 
had written to perform at the 1979 No Nukes Concerts. Max’s drumming 
pulsed like a frantic heartbeat for this torrid number which was 
followed by a ‘Wrecking Ball’ trifecta of “Death to My Hometown,” “We 
Take Care of Our Own,” and “Wrecking Ball.” And then things got wild, or
 wilder, I should say.<br>
<br>
As the opening chords to “Spirit in the Night” sounded behind him, Bruce
 slid down and sat on the stage and went into a long reverie before the 
astounded audience. It could have been 1977 all over again. “It was a 
summer just like this…it felt like it was hot all the time…and I was 
fourteen.” The crowd was almost completely silent as he mused about 
eyeing an 18 dollar guitar in the window of the Western Auto Parts Store
 in Freehold, and how he managed to get a job painting a neighbor’s 
house (“in 95 degree heat”) to earn the money to buy it.<br>
<br>
Once he bought the guitar he couldn’t figure out how to tune it or play 
it, so “I just looked at it in my room and it made me happy….it was like
 this totem of possibilities. It had this big sign on it that said 
MAYBE…” The strings, he remembered, were like telephone wires, and his 
fingers bled when he tried to play. He recalled how he then got an 
electric guitar soon after, and “got in a little band.” “I guess the 
point I’m trying to make is that next year – next July – is gonna be 50 
years since that summer.” The crowd loudly cheered this statement. “I 
learned that my job – you cannot do by yourself. At the end of the day, 
it’s a job you can’t do by yourself.” He exhorted the crowd, 
“WE…NEED…YOU!!…We need for you to make sense of all this shit! So what I
 wanna know is…can you feel the spirit?!” For this song as well as many 
subsequent ones this night, he threw himself into the crowd at the front
 of the stage over and over, as if to physically prove he needed them to
 lean on.<br>
<br>
“Hungry Heart” followed, then “My City of Ruins.” Bruce explained that 
he had originally written the song about Asbury Park, but since that 
time it had become about a lot of other things too. It was a thrill to 
see this back in the set, and it was a wrenching version. “Are we 
missing anybody?” As the lights went way down and the band played oh so 
quietly behind him, Bruce stood in the spotlight and sang, his voice 
full of heartbreak, “Oh they made that change uptown…they made that 
change uptown now…” over and over before bringing the song to its 
conclusion.<br>
<br>
Next, a real surprise: for the first time on this tour, Eric Burdon came
 out onstage as a special guest star and Bruce acknowledged that one of 
the songs he’d learned on that guitar as a kid was “We Gotta Get Out Of 
This Place.” Eric sang that growling lead as if the record had just come
 out and the E Street Band more than ably provided the sinuous backing. 
The entire audience as well as Bruce and the band shouted the chorus. It
 was not to be believed.<br>
<br>
As if things couldn’t get any more intense, Bruce swung into the John 
Lee Hooker classic “Boom Boom” (a hit in 1965 for Eric Burdon’s Animals)
 next and truly did us in proper. He had worked himself into a frenzied 
fever pitch by this point in the show, which is why Helen Jones was so 
right – there are good shows, great shows, and then there was Cardiff.<br>
<br>
“Cadillac Ranch” picked us up off the floor and then a sign request was 
fulfilled for “Summertime Blues” (always a personal favorite of mine, 
being the first song I ever saw Bruce and the band perform back in 
1978). A truly demented “You Can Look” was next, with Steven playing 
straight man advising Bruce he could look but not touch as the song 
burned to its finish. The NOLA/Kansas City stomp “Pay Me My Money Down” 
upped the ante even further as Charlie on accordion along with the horns
 joined Bruce on the small stage and went crazy, with the choir’s jazz 
parasols twirling away upstage.<br>
<br>
“Shackled and Drawn” further ratcheted the energy up, always a 
showstopper with Cindy’s amazing vocals. A small Welsh boy wearing a 
“Born in the USA” t-shirt was the featured vocalist on “Waiting on A 
Sunny Day.” “The Rising” invited us to come on up and “Badlands” 
reminded us it was no sin to be glad we were alive. The crowd chanted 
the “Badlands” refrain beautifully and melodically as the main set 
finished and the band took their bows.<br>
<br>
“This goes out to Emily,” Bruce said as the encores began with an 
unexpected and welcome version of “Tougher than the Rest,” to which 
Soozie contributed beautiful backing vocals. A maniacal “Born to Run” 
brought up the house lights and Bruce invited almost the entire front 
row to strum his guitar strings as the song roared to a finish.<br>
<br>
“Steve I think I wanna roadhouse!” he screamed into the mike, signaling 
for the rarely played and much enjoyed “Ramrod.” Steven reiterated that 
yes, it was Boss Time, and the horns and choir joined the front line 
downstage dancing and shaking their butts. Wait, are you kidding me? 
Yes, it could get hotter and crazier: “I’m A Rocker” followed this, 
during which Bruce kept throwing himself into the crowd.<br>
<br>
“Dancing in the Dark” and “10th Avenue Freeze Out” rounded out the 
encores, which have grown almost to a second full set at this point. 
“Cardiff!” Bruce chanted over and over as the crowd screamed back, 
“BRUCE!” and then they went into possibly the most frenetic version of 
“Shout!” I’ve seen yet, the horns and choir getting down to the ground 
with Bruce, band introductions, and endless codas.<br>
<br>
“This Little Light of Mine” joyous reprise followed and the crowd roared
 its approval, singing along to this soul stomper popularized by Fannie 
Lou Hamer. But was he finished with us? No, no, and no. As the band left
 the stage to rousing cheers, Bruce treated the Welsh crowd to a 
stunning solo acoustic version of “Janey Don’t You Lose Heart” followed 
by “Thunder Road.” Diolch yn fawr Gymru – Thank you Wales!\<br>

Leeds<br>
July 24, 2013<br>
<br>
As an enchanted full moon week in the British Isles and end of tour 
madness continues to thoroughly infuse Bruce Springsteen and the E 
Street Band, tonight they opened the brand new, cozily intimate (13,500)
 Leeds Arena – their first time in Leeds since the 1985 show at Roundhay
 Park. Personally I haven’t seen them in a venue this small for a very 
long time. With the audience incredibly close up after many nights in 
stadiums and fields, this Yorkshire night was extra special. “Hello 
Leeds!” Bruce shouted as he took the stage and opened the show with the 
relentless “Roulette.”<br>
<br>
“My Love Will Not Let You Down” was next, hitting us in the solar plexus
 like a high-energy one-two punch. The crowd took up the refrain of the 
song and chanted it along with the band. Nils, Steven, and Bruce formed a
 three-pronged fearsome guitar attack as the song roared to its finish.<br>
<br>
The energy continued to mount as “No Surrender” followed, again warmly 
welcomed by the ecstatic audience. Then proceedings then slowed down for
 a surprise, magnificent “Something in the Night.” This was followed by 
the haunting “American Skin (41 Shots)” unfortunately sadly still very 
relevant back at home.<br>
<br>
For “Hungry Heart” Bruce went to the back of the pit and greeted those 
in the theater-style seats, who were standing and cheering 
enthusiastically. He took the opportunity of being in such a small, 
intimate setting to crowd surf to the stage, delighting people even 
further. “Alright! Let me see what we got,” he announced as he set about
 collecting signs for song requests and also asked that people not hold 
them up during the show so people behind them could see.<br>
<br>
He chose a sign for “Local Hero” and the band kicked into a Stones-y, 
bluesy new arrangement of this song, which had not been played onstage 
for almost ten years and only once before with the E Street Band. It was
 absolutely terrific, the horns and choir adding an extra glorifying 
blast to this number from 1992’s ‘Lucky Town.’<br>
<br>
Bruce talked about what a great hall the venue was, especially noting 
how the quality of the sound. It was such a treat actually to see a 
small indoor show like this both for the band’s obvious thrill at 
playing a place this size, but also to experience the phenomenal 
lighting and enjoy the perfect sound mix. Next, Bruce announced they 
were going to do a Darkness outtake “for Steve Van Zandt!” and launched 
into the British Invasion-flavored “Gotta Get That Feeling.” This was a 
sign request which had also been rehearsed at that day’s soundcheck. It 
has only been performed once before, at the Asbury Park Carousel taping 
in 2010 before a very small audience, and never before at an official 
show.<br>
<br>
“These guys have been carrying this sign for a long time!” Bruce 
commented as he chose the next song request. “Where are you from? 
Spain?!” It was the Creedence Clearwater hit “Bad Moon Rising,” which 
obviously was unexpected and unrehearsed, but for all that, perfectly 
nailed as only this extraordinary musical ensemble can do. This one had 
last been played on the ‘Vote for Change’ Tour in 2004, backing up John 
Fogerty.<br>
<br>
“We’re gonna try one more crazy request here,” Bruce said and showed the
 audience a sign for “Thundercrack.” The crowd went wild. “This was 
written to be our first showstopper,” he commented. “We used to open for
 Black Oak Arkansas, Sha Na Na, Mountain, The Who…Cheech &amp; Chong! 
This was our show closer.” For an early Springsteen classic that clearly
 hadn’t been anticipated, they executed it brilliantly. Jake and Soozie 
framed Bruce on the stage to bring it to its raucous close.<br>
<br>
A three-pack from ‘Wrecking Ball’ was next:  the title song, “Death to 
My Hometown,” and a truly gorgeous rendition of the rarely played, 
achingly soulful “This Depression” with a glorious solo by Nils. 
“Because The Night” and “Darlington County” came up next, Bruce once 
again skipping to the back of the pit and inciting the crowd further 
into ecstasy back there, Nils joining him to sing their duet verse.<br>
<br>
“Shackled and Drawn” further whipped up the crowd, with Cindy stunning 
as always with her answer vocals and the front line soul shuffle at the 
end looking incredibly amazing in such a small venue. For “Waiting for a
 Sunny Day” Bruce chose a small blond boy to be the guest vocalist. “The
 Rising” and “Land of Hope and Dreams” finished out the main set and the
 band took their bows. The frenzied audience responded with the 
“Badlands” chant.<br>
<br>
The encores began with not only a tour premiere, but a song so rare it 
had only been played live once before in concert (13 years ago at New 
York’s Madison Square Garden), “Secret Garden.” Bruce dedicated it to 
those fans who had been following the three month long European tour. 
Lush, gorgeous, sensual, it was absolutely perfect. Soozie shone on 
backing vocals.<br>
<br>
Another treat, “Atlantic City,” was next, followed by “Badlands,” “Born 
to Run,” and “Dancing in the Dark.” This time, Bruce pulled an entire 
family of seven onstage to dance with him from different places in the 
pit. It totally brought the house down. “10th Avenue Freezeout” and 
“Shout” superseded this, and the band left the stage to a multitude of 
screams.<br>
<br>
A rare solo acoustic treat from Bruce left Leeds with a night to 
remember for the ages: “If I Should Fall Behind” and then the beautiful 
aching promise of “Thunder Road.”  “We’ll be seeing you!” he said as he 
left the stage.</div>
