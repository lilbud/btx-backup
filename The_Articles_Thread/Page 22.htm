Milwaukee Journal Sentinel , <br>
August 7, 2005<br>

<br>
It's a tall order to make the cavernous Bradley Center feel intimate. <br>
<br>
But despite the questionable venue, Bruce Springsteen's solo, 
not-quite-acoustic concert Sunday night was a showcase for the icon's 
formidable musical talents and charm. <br>
<br>
Black curtains draped ceiling to floor behind the stage made the 
20,000-seat venue seem roughly a third of its size, and a crystalline 
mix assured excellent sound for the near-capacity crowd, but the venue 
still felt too large and impersonal for two hours of Springsteen's most 
riveting musical character studies. <br>
<br>
Tales of sin, the struggle to survive and, occasionally, redemption, 
flowed out from the stage throughout the set, beginning with opening 
tune "Shut Out the Light" and carrying through to the encores, which 
included "Does This Bus Stop at 82nd St.?" and "The Promised Land." <br>
<br>
While some may prefer Springsteen's other incarnation, as the 
rabble-rousing ringleader of the E Street Circus, Sunday's performance 
was an arguably stronger testament to his skills as both musician and 
storyteller of a thousand nuances. <br>
<br>
Moving without pause among guitar, harmonica, organ and piano, 
Springsteen re-imagined several of the songs on the set list, such as 
"The Rising," which he performed with raw urgency. <br>
<br>
"Jesus Was an Only Son," from this year's spare and brilliant "Devils 
&amp; Dust," evoked far more emotion and humanity than all the cinematic
 blood-splatter of "The Passion of the Christ." <br>
<br>
The parent-child relationship was a common theme throughout the evening.
 Describing his teenage son bringing home his first girlfriend, 
Springsteen revealed he wasn't a hovering kind of dad. Well, sorta. <br>
<br>
Quipped the singer: "You can't stand around and watch 'em, it's not a zoo. So I hid behind a bush."</div>

<br>
St. Louis Post Dispatch <br>
August 8, 2005<br>
By Vahe Gregorian<br>
<br>
More than 30 years since the release of his debut album, "Greetings From
 Asbury Park," Bruce Springsteen continues to reinvent his work, 
replenish his vast inventory and reassert his command of an audience. <br>
<br>
His latest incarnation was on crackling display Saturday night at the 
Fox Theatre, where Springsteen's solo acoustic performance was at once 
animated but intimate, vigorous but restrained, and ventured into new 
terrain while reaffirming his essential roots. <br>
<br>
If the show was notable for eight songs from Springsteen's newest album,
 "Devils and Dust," it also was distinguished by 16 other songs spanning
 much of Springsteen's career. That included a piercing version of 
"Backstreets," believed to be the first time on this tour Springsteen 
has dipped into the landmark "Born to Run" album, which still is a 
highlight of his tours with the E Street Band. <br>
<br>
Adding to the luster of "Back- streets" and, in fact, the entire night, 
was Springsteen's banter with the audience, which for the most part was 
remarkably silent in accordance with his wishes. <br>
<br>
"I'm going to take a swing at this thing," he said as he sat down at the
 piano without naming the song and noted, "I've never played this before
 by myself ... and I'll never play it again." <br>
<br>
Then he said, "All right, all right, let me prepare," then briefly went 
"ommmm," laughed and struck the notes that immediately resonated with 
longtime fans. <br>
<br>
The sense of unscripted storytelling and spontaneity with the crowd was 
part of the marrow of Springsteen's early career that made him a 
mesmerizing force. <br>
<br>
Some of that sheer whimsical component had given way to rehearsed 
exchanges during Springsteen and the E Street Band's reunion and "The 
Rising" tours - perhaps understandably enough given the sophistication 
and scale of those rousing productions. <br>
<br>
The ornate and warm Fox, which Springsteen noted that St. Louis is lucky
 to have, provided an apt setting for him to resume his traditional 
stance with the crowd. He has been revisiting that since this tour began
 in April - and doing so with more vibrancy than he did on the 1996 solo
 acoustic tour underscored by his grim release, "The Ghost of Tom Joad."
 <br>
<br>
His renewed accessibility created the perception of shared experience 
that enhanced the night - even when Springsteen botched the lyrics as 
during "County Fair." Staring at the music sheet and chortling to 
himself as the crowd laughed along, Springsteen said he may just have to
 "skip over that line" and simply moved on. <br>
<br>
Some of Springsteen's ease was slightly jarring. He used expletives a 
half-dozen times or more, and from the new album he played the sexually 
explicit song "Reno" with no forewarning for those with children in the 
audience, as he had given in Chicago in May. <br>
<br>
Part of the enduring magic of Springsteen is the mystery, the way the 
show changes from night to night. The performance at the Fox featured 
nine song changes from his last show Wednesday in Grand Rapids, Mich., 
which came after his two shows in Ohio featured 38 different songs. <br>
<br>
Other highlights of the night included an unsettling but riveting 
version of "Reason to Believe," marked by his rhythmic stomp and use of a
 harmonica with a distorting microphone. "The River" seemed to evoke 
nearly as much response as "Back- streets." Also particularly 
well-received were "Highway Patrolman" and "The Rising." The encore 
featured "Cynthia," "Wild Billy's Circus Story" and a scaled-down but 
stirring "Promised Land." <br>
<br>
He ended the night as he has many shows on the tour with "Dream Baby 
Dream," a repetitive, previously obscure tune that left some grumbling 
and others feeling it was an uptempo message to absorb and take to 
heart.</div>

Bruce Springsteen is a storyteller as well as a rocker. But it was his 
storytelling side that played the dominant role Thursday night at 
KeyArena.<br>
Seattle Post-Intelligencer , <br>
August 12, 2005<br>
By Gene Stout<br>
<br>
Currently on his first solo tour since the late '90s -- in support of 
his current "Devils &amp; Dust" album -- Springsteen played many of the 
lesser-known songs in his prolific catalog, trotting out such gems as 
"Highway 29" and "Racing in the Street" with gripping new arrangements 
and a renewed passion for their lyrical content. <br>
<br>
To assure a quiet environment for a solo acoustic show in a large arena,
 concertgoers were given small instruction cards with do's and don'ts as
 they came through the doors. Turning off cell phones and refraining 
from unnecessary chatter were at the top of the list. <br>
<br>
Springsteen was almost 45 minutes late in taking the stage, allowing the
 crowd that filled the main floor and mid-level seats plenty of time to 
talk themselves out before services at the church of Bruce Springsteen 
commenced. <br>
<br>
"The Boss" arrived on stage in black trousers and a black shirt with 
sleeves rolled up. Against a backdrop of theater curtains and 
chandeliers, he greeted fans with a cheerful "Hello Seattleites" and 
again reminded them of the need for attentive silence. Happy to oblige, 
the audience was rewarded with more than two hours of powerful, soulful 
songs that brought out the best in the 55-year-old troubadour, as well 
as bits of crusty humor, including hilarious remarks about the ambiguous
 relationship between Fred Flintstone and his friend Barney. <br>
<br>
Opening with a stripped-down "Living Proof," he followed with a gritty, 
distorted version of "Reason to Believe," from his 1980s solo album, 
"Nebraska," featuring harmonica. <br>
<br>
"Devils &amp; Dust" told the desperate tale of a U.S. soldier in Iraq 
who doesn't know "who to trust." The audience erupted in laughter when 
Springsteen took a dig at the Bush administration before singing "Part 
Man, Part Monkey." <br>
<br>
When Springsteen's oldest son, Evan, brought his father a fresh guitar, 
the singer-songwriter wisecracked that it would cost him $100 every time
 Evan delivered a guitar -- $200 if the audience offered too much 
encouragement. <br>
<br>
"The Rising," his post-9/11 song, was among the most stirring in the 
main set, and "Racing in the Street" related a captivating tale of men 
who love fast cars but live desperate lives. <br>
<br>
The Grammy-winning Rock and Roll Hall of Famer introduced "Jesus Was an 
Only Son" with a wonderful story about growing up with his extended 
family in a Catholic neighborhood whose hub was the church. <br>
<br>
Springsteen closed his main set with "Matamoros Banks," the final song 
on "Devils &amp; Dust." He returned for two encores, making a pitch for 
the West Seattle Food Bank and ending with such songs as "Promised Land"
 and an amazing "Dream Baby Dream." <br>
<br>
Springsteen's long night in Seattle ended just before 10:40 p.m.</div>

SOLO SET: Tardiness for last show of tour only builds crowd anticipation<br>
Vancouver Province , <br>
August 14, 2005<br>
By Tom Harrison<br>
<br>
He's just banging his guitar with his hand but it sounds like a heartbeat. <br>
<br>
He's singing off the microphone about the dream of life, but it's the message that rings loud and clear throughout his show. <br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen was at GM Place last night for the last show of his 
summer tour to promote Devils &amp; Dust, his latest album. It was 
called the Pontiac Theatre, which is another term for having a hockey 
rink. So 7,000 people witnessed a two-hour, 20-minute solo performance. <br>
<br>
True to the warning of the ads and on the tickets, latecomers were not seated once the show began. <br>
<br>
This was a formality as fans of Bruce Springsteen are dedicated and therefore were seated. <br>
<br>
But the solemnity of this highlighted the fact that he has only toured solo twice in a career of more than 30 years. <br>
<br>
He nonetheless was late by about 45 minutes, which gave some time to 
scan the stage. which was a backdrop of drapery and an assortment of 
guitars and keyboards. <br>
<br>
It was a deceptively simple set-up, designed to put all the attention on
 him, as the nature of the show was described as intimate. It's hard to 
be intimate in a hockey rink, but the strategy worked. His lateness was 
also a chance to hear a few Springsteen testimonials. His songs changed 
lives. They touch people on a personal level, so there was anticipation 
building when he finally did show. <br>
<br>
He started with the unexpected. A performance of "Living Proof" at a pump organ. <br>
<br>
He continued with the unorthodox by performing "Reason to Believe" as a Sonny Boy Williamson blues. <br>
<br>
There were unexpected songs, too, such as "Because the Night," "Blinded 
by the Light," and "Sandy," songs he rarely, if ever, performs anymore. <br>
<br>
A lot of the songs were about characters who felt alone and struggled. 
They were underlined by Springsteen's adaptation of a lonesome, keening 
wail, first heard effectively during the "The River." <br>
<br>
His characters are solitary. Fighting the odds. Driving them is the heartbeat, the dream of life.</div>

<br>
When the E Street Band reunited in 1999 for the run-up to The Rising, 
Bruce Springsteen seemed to shed 25 years. He was funky and clownish?not
 the stiff and, frankly, dull creature captured forever in the ?Dancing 
in the Dark? video. The Boss was harking back to the funny, jive, 
beat-infused hustler persona of his early career. It was great?a sop to 
his real fans, but something of a lateral move for the artist. <br>
<br>
For this tour, Springsteen is still and deliberate. He?s all alone up 
there, and the stage mirrors the musical austerity: a single table, a 
lamp, a cup of water, and two video screens that offer lingering images 
of his heavy-set, midlife face and his plump fingers. With all the 
bombast removed, Springsteen can tackle ?Because the Night? as a soft 
piano ballad. For ?Reason to Believe?, he stomped on the floor and sang 
through a vintage bullet microphone, making for what sounded like a 
field recording by Alan Lomax. ?State Trooper? became a metallic, 
nightmarish rocker, and ?The Line? was so intense and fully formed that 
it seemed like an orchestra had been smuggled in. Springsteen found 
endless latitude in all this simplicity. In ?Cynthia?, he pounded the 
body of his acoustic guitar, and finished with a lascivious growl 
straight out of ?Pretty Woman?. <br>
<br>
However, the two-and-a-half-hour performance was slyly programmed to be 
more than an extravaganza of revisionism. Having introduced his son Evan
 early on?he?s his proud dad?s guitar tech?Springsteen made several 
references to parenthood, adding weight to the final verse of ?Long Time
 Coming?, with its already heart-rending lines ?I reach ?neath your 
skirt, lay my hands across your belly, and feel another one kickin? 
inside. I ain?t gonna fuck it up this time?. He deliberately pulled back
 from the mike in places, and as a result it felt like we were 
eavesdropping on a conversation with his boy. <br>
<br>
Tellingly, Springsteen ignored both Born in the USA and Born to Run?the 
two career landmarks that have bedevilled this shape-shifting artist. 
Perhaps he couldn?t find the possibility for reinvention inside those 
ossified structures. A reading of ?The River?, on the other hand, was as
 sad as anything you?ve ever heard. It made the original seem callow, 
while ?Two Hearts? had a gravity that the younger artist lacked. 
Springsteen?s early, fruitier musicality has been replaced with 
directness and wisdom. The emotional fulcrum of the night came midway, 
with ?The Rising?. It inspired a short ovation from the crowd, in answer
 to Springsteen?s repeated phrase, ?Dream of life?, which he imbued with
 grim, intractable belief. With GM Place seeming impossibly intimate, 
the now overtly politicized Springsteen invited us to appraise him as a 
father, and a man apparently concerned about the regretful state of the 
Union. <br>
<br>
Not that the show was all heaviness; the Boss is also a cutup. 
Introducing ?Blinded by the Light?, he admitted that he intends to start
 using drugs when he?s old. ?It?ll give me something to do,? he said. 
During ?Jesus Was an Only Son?, he vamped a section about Jesus and Mary
 Magdalene opening a bar in Galilee, ?on the beachfront?. Christ knows 
how that routine is going over in the red states. He also confided, 
?When people ask me what it?s like to be the Boss, I feed ?em a line of 
humble bullshit. I tell ?em, you know, it?s just like anything else?? <br>
<br>
He ended with a cover of ?Dream Baby Dream?, originally recorded by the 
ultra-nihilistic New York synth duo Suicide. If that?s not remarkable 
enough, Springsteen turned it into a sort of celestial anthem of hope, 
played on a pump organ. It was breathtaking?but not as breathtaking as 
the overall impression of an artist who might, incredibly, be coming 
into his prime. Again.</div>

<br>
The Republican ,<br>
October 10, 2005<br>
By Ray Kelly<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen has made a career out of creating magical moments, but
 transforming a hockey arena into an intimate theater is quite a feat. <br>
<br>
Performing solo at the Hartford Civic Center Friday, Springsteen used 
subdued lighting, chandeliers above the stage and drapes blocking out 
the upper sections to convince the crowd that they were not in a 
cavernous arena, but rather one of the small halls where he launched 
this tour six months ago. <br>
<br>
Despite the inherent acoustical drawbacks, The Boss pulled off an illusion worthy of David Copperfield. <br>
<br>
Breaking from long-standing tradition, Springsteen did not threaten the 
crowd with bodily harm at the start of the show if they called out 
requests or failed to turn off their cell phones. Still, leaflets on 
acceptable behavior and etiquette were handed out to Hartford 
concertgoers as they entered the arena. <br>
<br>
As advertised, the 27-song concert was built around Springsteen's lesser-known works. He proved to be a man of his word. <br>
<br>
Springsteen opened with three numbers that left casual fans baffled - 
"Back In Your Arms," a mid 1990s outtake; the seldom-performed "Wreck on
 the Highway" from "The River" album; and "Idiot's Delight," a tune he 
co-wrote seven years ago for Pittsburgh rocker Joe Grushecky and 
performed here through a purposely-distorted microphone. <br>
<br>
When Springsteen launched into the title track from his recent album, 
"Devils &amp; Dust," the audience roared with approval - partly because 
it was the first song of the night that many of them recognized. <br>
<br>
The concert found Springsteen relaxed, reflective and in fine voice as 
he switched from falsetto to gravely growl. The solo outing showcased 
his musical skills as he moved effortlessly from grand piano to acoustic
 guitar to pump organ throughout the night. <br>
<br>
He took a step back 25 years and delivered a spirited reworking of "The 
Ties That Bind" before offering a pair of recent recordings, "Long Time 
Coming" and "Silver Palomino." <br>
<br>
Making reference to the Boston Red Sox division loss an hour before the 
start of the show, Springsteen told baseball fans he would "try to 
assuage your pain." "Hey little heroes, summer's long but I guess it 
ain't very sweet around here anymore" he sang out during "Incident on 
57th Street." <br>
<br>
Throughout the night Springsteen mixed old chestnuts like "Lost in the Flood" with more recent recordings such as "The Rising." <br>
<br>
His songs have often dealt with the friction between fathers and sons, 
but two newer songs, "Jesus Was An Only Son" and "The Hitter," 
beautifully captured the bond between mothers and sons. Both were 
well-received. <br>
<br>
Springsteen weighed in on the creationism-evolution debate with the 
playful "Part Man, Part Monkey" and on a more serious note called for a 
"more humane immigration policy" before closing his set with "Matamoros 
Banks," which chronicled the drowning of a Mexican immigrant. <br>
<br>
Springsteen returned to the stage for a five-song encore beginning with 
the charming "I Wanna Marry You" on ukulele. He captured the energy of 
Jerry Lee Lewis on piano with the rockabilly-tinged "You Can Look (But 
You Better Not Touch)." <br>
<br>
Strapping on an acoustic guitar, he reinterpreted two E Street Band concert staples, "Bobby Jean" and "The Promised Land." <br>
<br>
As he has at almost every stop on the tour, Springsteen ended the night 
on pump organ performing a cover of Suicide's moody, but repetitive, 
"Dream Baby Dream.</div>

<br>
The Tampa Tribune ,<br>
November 5, 2005<br>
By Curtis Ross<br>
<br>
When Bruce Springsteen performed "Blinded by the Light" during his 
encore Friday night, it was more than a welcome rendition of an old 
favorite. It was pure joy, a celebratory rush and a release after a set 
that focused on reality and the high price of dreams. <br>
<br>
There was humor in Springsteen's between-song banter. He joked that all 
pop songs, of love or protest, had the same aim: "To get somebody to 
pull their pants down." <br>
<br>
That's true probably 98 percent of the time, but Springsteen writes love
 songs that go way beyond the usual pop constraints. To him, love is the
 ultimate act of courage. <br>
<br>
Springsteen kicked off with "Fade Away" before a St. Pete Times Forum crowd of 10,113. <br>
<br>
The solo show saw Springsteen taking musical risks, perhaps none greater
 than the second number, "Reason to Believe." The jaunty, 
acoustic-guitar-driven track from 1982's "Nebraska" was almost 
unrecognizable. Springsteen accompanied himself with harmonica and foot 
stomps, turning the song into a distorted, demonic blues wail. <br>
<br>
"Atlantic City" was performed on piano, which brought a lovely, 
circular, melodic figure to the fore. For "State Trooper," Springsteen 
drummed an electric guitar for a rendition that sounded like the 
rockabilly of the damned. <br>
<br>
"Wreck on the Highway" and "My Hometown" were incredibly moving, as was 
"The Rising," in which the repeated line "dream of life" sounded like a 
prayer. <br>
<br>
Springsteen closed with "Dream Baby Dream," by the '70s duo Suicide. 
Playing the three-chord riff on the organ, Springsteen turned the song 
into a strange, beautiful hymn to hope.</div>

<br>
Virginian Pilot , <br>
November 12, 2005<br>
By April Phillips<br>
<br>
It?s been more than 20 years since Bruce Springsteen performed in 
Hampton Roads during the height of his fame following the release of 
1984?s ?Born in the USA.? Fans who flocked to the Constant Center on 
Friday night to see the 56-year-old Rock and Roll Hall of Famer on one 
of the last dates of his solo acoustic tour were in for a much different
 show than the rollicking E Street Band performances of earlier years. 
One fact, however, was crystal clear: Bruce is still The Boss. <br>
<br>
If that were ever in doubt, fans only needed to check out the rules 
Springsteen insisted on posting in and around the venue. No talking. No 
standing. No concessions during the show. No cell phones, etc. For the 
casual fan, these restrictions probably dampened the fun of seeing one 
of rock music?s most legendary performers. There was no fist pumping, no
 jumping around on stage, no dancing arm in arm with the Big Man, 
saxophonist Clarence Clemmons. <br>
<br>
Without his E Street Band cohorts, the evening was quiet, and at times 
almost somber. The show opened with the sparsest possible version of 
?Born in the USA,? which Springsteen played only on harmonica. He sang 
through a vocal effect rendering his voice into something that resembled
 a scratchy old record album. This version of one of his biggest hits 
really underscored the often-misunderstood lyrics, which lament the poor
 treatment of Vietnam veterans. <br>
<br>
Perhaps in honor of Veterans Day, Springsteen performed ?The Wall,? 
which he said was written about a former musical influence from his 
hometown of Freehold, N.J., who died in Vietnam. Bruce spent time 
between songs talking to the audience in his whispery voice, still 
flecked with the blue-collar rhythms of his New Jersey upbringing. The 
low-key atmosphere was perfectly natural and even necessary for the mood
 of Springsteen?s latest CD, ?Devils and Dust.? <br>
<br>
Released in May, it is an introspective album chronicling the underside 
of life. The CD?s title track and ?Long Time Coming? were definite 
highlights of the Constant Center show. These songs featured Springsteen
 with nothing but a 12-string guitar and a harmonica. Although they were
 performed quietly, passion was clearly written on The Boss?s face and 
in the intensity of his playing. <br>
<br>
There were a number of gems throughout the evening. One of the night?s 
lighter moments occurred when Springsteen got behind a grand piano and 
announced that Williamsburg native Bruce Hornsby was in the house. He 
then proceeded to pound out a boogie-woogie number. <br>
<br>
?That?s right, Hornsby,? Springsteen said. ?This town just ain?t big enough for two Bruces.? <br>
<br>
At that moment Hornsby walked out on stage reading a newspaper. 
Eventually, he replaced Springsteen at the piano, and the result was a 
high-energy reworking of ?You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch).? At 
its conclusion, Hornsby received a standing ovation from his hometown 
crowd. <br>
<br>
Springsteen reworked many of the biggest hits of his 30-plus-year career
 to adapt them for an acoustic performance. Some of these 
interpretations worked better than others. ?Johnny 99? showed off 
Springsteen?s considerable talent as a slide guitarist, and the vocal 
style worked hand in hand with the desperation inherent in the song?s 
lyrics. However, his version of ?Darkness on the Edge of Town,? with the
 chord structure changed significantly, made the song all but 
unrecognizable. <br>
<br>
The Boss moved from piano, to guitar, to pump organ throughout the 
evening, and his striking musicianship was especially clear without a 
backing band. However, when he picked up an autoharp to play ?The New 
Timer,? from his Grammy award-winning ?Ghost of Tom Joad? album, it was a
 little over the top. <br>
<br>
In a moment that might have been ridiculous but actually came across as 
very sweet, Springsteen grabbed another unorthodox instrument and began 
to play one of his earliest songs. <br>
<br>
?I woke up at Old Dominion with a couple of co-eds and a ukulele,? he 
said as he launched into ?Growin? Up? from his first album. As he 
attempted to play the song?s guitar solo on the uke, he said, ?See? Size
 don?t matter.? <br>
<br>
Toward the end of the evening Springsteen had lightened up considerably.
 He thanked the Norfolk audience for following the rules. A small crowd 
of fans was allowed to rush the stage, and during ?Blinded By the 
Light,? a Springsteen-penned song that was a No. 1 hit for Manfred Mann,
 he even encouraged the crowd to sing along. After putting in plugs for 
the Food Bank of Southeastern Virginia and the Foodbank of the Virginia 
Peninsula, Springsteen shook hands with as many of the crowd gathered in
 front of the stage as he could. He seemed genuinely thrilled to still 
be performing great music for appreciative fans after so many years. His
 enthusiasm made him appear as youthful as he did 30 years ago when 
?Born to Run? was released. <br>
<br>
Even when Bruce Springsteen seems to take himself a little too 
seriously, as he did Friday night, his honest passion for the music and 
for performing makes attending one of his concerts an unforgettable 
event.</div>

<br>
OnMilwaukee.com , <br>
November 16, 2005<br>
By Bill Zaferos<br>
<br>
Three decades ago, a down-and-out Bruce Springsteen, his career at a 
dead-end after his first two critically acclaimed albums failed to sell,
 sat down and decided to create a blockbuster, hoping to create maybe 
the greatest rock and roll album ever made. The result was "Born to 
Run." <br>
<br>
Thirty years later, it is more apparent than ever that he succeeded. <br>
<br>
"Born to Run" is indeed the greatest rock and roll album ever made. <br>
<br>
Forget "Sgt. Pepper" or "Who's Next" or "Blonde on Blonde" or any number
 of other landmark, but lesser, albums. It was "Born to Run" that saved a
 generation from the likes of disco and progressive rock and the 
cynicism of punk. <br>
<br>
It was "Born to Run" that gave an entire generation meaning, a soundtrack to their lives. And still does. <br>
<br>
It was desperately romantic. It was cinematic. It was epic. In other words, everything Springsteen set out to make it. <br>
<br>
It had anger and frustration and confusion. Drama. Passion. Pathos. Noirish themes. <br>
<br>
And it was big. Really big. As in big sound. Big ideas. Big aspirations for the "runaway American dream." Wall of Sound big. <br>
<br>
OK, it was the definitive Baby Boomer album. But even today, Gens X and Y
 and Millennium should easily be able to appreciate its magnificent and,
 well, its bigness, if they give it a chance. It is the very definition 
of rock and roll, or what it should be. <br>
<br>
The newly reissued three-disc "Born to Run" box set, a re-mastered "30th
 Anniversary Edition," only re-establishes the album's pre-eminence as a
 cornerstone of American music, a masterpiece unsurpassed by anything 
released in prior or ensuing years. <br>
<br>
The re-released album itself, re-mastered with Springsteen's blessing 
and direction, is exactly the one many of us grew up with. There are no 
studio out-takes, no "bonus" tracks or alternative takes that so often 
provide filler for other re-issues. It's "Born to Run" as we remember 
it, complete with the notion that we will die with someone named Wendy 
in the street tonight in an ever-lasting kiss, and that we will wind up 
loving someone with all the madness in our soul. <br>
<br>
Did we mention there was some romanticism here? <br>
<br>
The re-master sounds a little crisper, a little deeper, but in the end 
sounds much like the same album we've come to know and love. The sound 
really isn't the issue, though. It's the music. And the lyrics. <br>
<br>
To this day, who can't relate to the idea expressed in "Backstreets" 
that recalls that "after all those movies ... we'd go see, trying to 
learn to walk like the heroes we thought we had to be ... after all this
 time we'd find we're just like all the rest..." <br>
<br>
A cup of shattered dreams, anyone? <br>
<br>
In an accompanying one-disc documentary called "Wings for Wheels: The 
Making of Born to Run," which really is fascinating for Bruce fanatics 
only, Springsteen said the album "changed my life and the lives of my 
friends and my band mates." Not to mention millions of people who would 
eventually become "Bruceheads," people who played Springsteen songs at 
both weddings and funerals. <br>
<br>
In the documentary, Springsteen says that the album "had that feeling of
 that endless summer night." Indeed, the re-issue bears him out, right 
down to the "barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge drinking warm 
beer in the summer rain." <br>
<br>
It's poetry set to music. Really good, Motown meets James Brown meets 
Dylan meets Elvis meets Phil Spector music. There has been nothing like 
it before or since. <br>
<br>
Fortunately, with the new re-master no one allowed Springsteen to play 
with the mix, as he might have been wont to do. From Clarence Clemons' 
sax solo ripping into a warm, muggy night on "Jungleland" to the 
glorious frenzy of "She's the One," the album is touched up, but largely
 untouched. And that's good. Why fool with something that has endured so
 well, that will continue to continue to serve as a model for rock and 
roll should be? <br>
<br>
In the end, why pick up a three-disc set at about $35? <br>
<br>
Well, in addition to the newly re-mastered "Born to Run," the 
Hammersmith Odeon London '75 disc is really exceptional, showing 
Springsteen before his show became spectacle, before people "Bruuuuuce"d
 between every song. The Hammersmith Odeon show puts a skinny kid on 
display who's learning his stagecraft, who hasn't learned to tell long 
stories between numbers, who's just there to put on a good show and play
 some incredible music. <br>
<br>
And it's a great show. Just like the ones we've all become accustomed to after 30 years. <br>
<br>
But if you're ever going to discover Springsteen, or celebrate what he's done, this re-issue is the place to start. <br>
<br>
It's proof that if Springsteen isn't an American icon (and he is), "Born
 to Run" should be part of America's musical iconography.</div>

<br>
The Plain Dealer , <br>
December 2, 2005<br>
By Michael Heaton<br>
<br>
"Why do we suffer? Because we must." <br>
<br>
This is not a quote from Nietzsche, Freud or Kierkegaard. It's from 
Bruce Springsteen in his 90-minute documentary "Wings for Wheels: The 
Making of Born to Run." <br>
<br>
It comes with the 30th anniversary package of "Born to Run." BTR was 
Springsteen's third album and the one that made Bruce Springsteen an 
icon of American music and culture. It also put him on the cover of Time
 and Newsweek, in the same week. <br>
<br>
Those words on the subject of "suffering," real suffering, dark night of
 the soul stuff, come from Springsteen's present-day lips as he 
describes the longing and ambition that drove him to record his 
watershed album. <br>
<br>
Unlike the exhausting 225-minute Bob Dylan special "No Direction Home" 
that just aired on PBS over two nights, "Wings for Wheels" is a riveting
 look at the artist as a young man behind the 8-ball. <br>
<br>
It has the tension of a fictional drama. Springsteen had two cult hit 
albums under his belt. This third one would determine his fate with the 
record company and with the world as well. He talks about how determined
 he was to create an album that would land on the charts and put him on 
the rock 'n' roll map. <br>
<br>
What makes the docu-story compelling is that Springsteen knew this was a
 career-defining moment. At 24, Springsteen had world domination on his 
"to do" list. And he bore down to create a record that changed his life.
 There was no one more ready. <br>
<br>
The film is a portrait of the artist as an emerging superstar. It's a 
cool glimpse of Bruce looking back on himself during that trying time. 
But he was more trying on the band and others in the studio. They played
 songs over and over, adding and subtracting instruments, including a 
glockenspiel and a whole string section. Band members David Sancious and
 Boom Carter quit when it took six grueling months to record the title 
track, "Born to Run." <br>
<br>
Producer Jimmy Iovine recalls The Boss plugging guitars into an entire 
wall of different amps looking for just the right sound, saying "Can we 
do it again? Can we do it again? Again? Again?" For six months. And that
 nickname, The Boss? That was no idle moniker. You get the distinct 
impression this guy was like Capt. Bly when it came to working the band.
 Springsteen is fairly honest about himself. When "Little" Steven Van 
Zandt brought in the famous copies of Time and Newsweek, Springsteen 
says he was awed and embarrassed and retreated to his room. Then he 
adds, "But I wouldn't have had it any other way." <br>
<br>
There's a bit of disingenuousness when Springsteen and his manager Jon 
Landau go out of their way to explain that the album is about 
friendship, and that's why Bruce is on the "cover" with saxophonist 
Clarence Clemons. <br>
<br>
The fact of the matter is that when the vinyl album came out, Bruce was 
on the cover alone and Clemons was on the back of the album. And when 
you hear that The Boss dictated every note of the sax solo on 
"Jungleland" and that it took 16 hours to complete, you wonder if the 
"Big", Man Clemons was wishing Springsteen wouldn't be such a good 
friend to him. <br>
<br>
Toward the end of the documentary, Springsteen is asked if the band had 
any fun during the death marchlike recording sessions that became "Born 
To Run." <br>
<br>
He laughs at the suggestion and says, "Yeah, we had some fun . . . when we weren't suffering."</div>

<br>
Los Angeles Times , <br>
April 30, 2006<br>
By Randy Lewis<br>
<br>
Sometime, somewhere, a more dramatic and exhilarating confluence of 
music with moment may have existed than Bruce Springsteen's appearance 
tonight at the 37th annual Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival here. But in 
nearly 40 years of concert-going, I haven't <br>
witnessed one. <br>
<br>
The first public presentation of material from his new album of 
folk-rooted songs, "We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions" had the 
feeling of no less than the turning of a tide, for the people of New 
Orleans and Louisiana, and perhaps well beyond. <br>
<br>
It was serendipity that Springsteen happened to finish the album just 
enough ahead of Jazz Fest to accept an invitation to premiere his new 
Seeger Sessions band and the material for the occasion. But the way this
 project uses American folk music tradition to express and transform 
people's pain, loss and anger dovetailed perfectly with the festival's 
role eight months after Hurricane Katrina as a salve on the wounds of 
the region's residents. <br>
<br>
The album had been out just nine days before today's show with this 
remarkably spirited 18-piece ensemble consisting of banjo, acoustic 
guitars, accordion, fiddles, mandolin, Dobro, steel guitar, bass, drums 
and a freewheeling horn section that fit right in here in the brass band
 capital of the nation. The massed forces, which included several backup
 singers, exuded an enlarged sense of the communal spirit that's long 
typified Springsteen shows. <br>
<br>
The audience at the closing set of the 10-day event's first weekend 
empathetically jumped in without so much as a cue on sing-along choruses
 that it cemented the feeling of a community coming together and rising 
above tragedy. <br>
<br>
This, however, was above and beyond even Springsteen's high performance 
standards. Moving from the rock context of the E Street Band to the 
shout-out jubilation of an unfettered hootenanny, the New Jersey rocker 
was transformed into a troubadour evangelist. One concert cannot even 
start to undo such monumental destruction as Katrina left, but 
Springsteen seemed to understand that even a moment of renewal can be a 
powerful thing. <br>
<br>
Springsteen began with the spiritual "O Mary Don't You Weep," so infused
 with religious fervor it would have worked beautifully in the 
festival's gospel tent as he sang, "Brothers and sisters don't you 
cry/There'll be good times by and by." <br>
<br>
Except for a few fittingly reworked numbers from his catalog, including 
"Johnny 99" redone as a New Orleans street parade workout, and a spare, 
deeply felt version of "My City of Ruins," the show stuck with the 
"Seeger Sessions" songs, supplemented by a couple that didn't make the 
final cut for the album. <br>
<br>
One of those was "How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live?" - a 
song written in 1929 at the start of the Depression, to which 
Springsteen added three of his own verses with Katrina in mind. <br>
<br>
He spoke at one point of driving through mile upon mile of 
storm-devastated New Orleans neighborhoods, and sharing citizens' 
outrage at political incompetence and/or corruption that has compromised
 rebuilding efforts. But rather than giving in to despair, the songs he 
chose almost invariably sought - and found - redemption through faith 
and the resilience of the human spirit. <br>
<br>
Such was the restorative power Springsteen and the band channeled that 
midway through their treatment of Bill and Sis Cunningham's Dust Bowl 
chronicle "My Oklahoma Home," it didn't seem the least bit coincidental 
that the gray storm clouds above parted to reveal the blue sky and 
shining sun behind them. <br>
<br>
After Springsteen and his plentiful cohorts left the stage, an announcer
 said, "This concludes the first weekend of the resurrection of New 
Orleans." And for once such a comment didn't sound the least like hype.</div>

May 7, 2006<br>
</strong><br>
Manchester Evening News , <br>
By Kevin Bourke<br>
<br>
ANYONE who was expecting to see the full-on rock'n'soul celebration that
 is Bruce Springsteen with the E Street Band, or alternatively the more 
sombre soul-searching of Bruce's solo tours, could have been surprised 
by the joyful noise that filled the M.E.N. Arena. <br>
<br>
This was Bruce with the Seeger Sessions Band, largely the band who 
played with him on his exuberant new album We Shall Overcome: The Seeger
 Sessions, on which he explores what might yet be called the Great 
American Folksong Book with a wild, innocent abandon that has more in 
common with The Pogues than it does with anything in the post-Born To 
Run Springsteen catalogue. <br>
<br>
Advertisement your story continues below <br>
We're talking an eighteen-strong band featuring fiddles, banjo, stand-up
 bass, accordion and a barnstorming brass section here, playing folk 
songs that are, as often as not, centuries old, all fronted with a 
testifying fervour by Bruce. <br>
<br>
Jumping Jehosophat, was it great, though! <br>
<br>
Relevance <br>
<br>
You'd have had to be sleeping in the ground not to be testifying 
yourself as, playing for well over two hours, Bruce and the band found 
both the fun and relevance in tunes like John Henry and Old Dan Tucker, 
while making the anti-war ballad Mrs McGrath speak as eloquently by 
implication about the American misadventure in Iraq as it ever did about
 the Irish Easter Rising. <br>
<br>
We Shall Overcome itself was reclaimed from well-meaning tedium to 
regain its place as "the most important protest song of all time", as 
Springsteen proclaimed, while Pay Me My Money Down boasted the 
improbable achievement of making - for a brief time at least - the tuba 
the most rock'n'roll instrument imaginable! <br>
<br>
Marvellously, the band sometimes seemed to even surprise themselves, 
while the few Springsteen originals in the set were radically recast - 
Johnny 99 bristled with New Orleans funkification, while both Cadillac 
Ranch and You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch) were re-born on the 
bayou as zydeco-flavoured jaunts.</div>

The London Times ,<br>
By Pete Paphides<br>
<br>
With Norris McWhirter no longer around to measure these things, it may 
never be a matter of public record. Nonetheless, you would struggle to 
recall a crowd that took less time to warm up than Bruce Springsteen's 
audience in Dublin. <br>
<br>
Twelve seconds I made it -just long enough for a bleary fiddle and an 
unsteady brass section to clamber aboard for the opening boom-thump of 
O, Mary, Don't You Weep. <br>
<br>
As a country where the singing storyteller has long enjoyed privileged 
status, Ireland has always had a soft spot for Springsteen -and that was
 before he went and released a folk album. The adoration by his 
audience, then, was no surprise. <br>
<br>
Whether he would manage to reproduce the tipsy conviviality of The 
Seeger Sessions in an 8,500-capacity hangar was another matter. <br>
<br>
Perhaps it was the liberation of singing lyrics that originated in a 
place other than his own head, but at times he brought a physicality to 
historical ballads such as Jesse James that was almost comical: cocking 
his leg up like an over-watered labrador when his excitement could no 
longer be contained; and accidentally thumping his wife Patti Scialfa 
with the neck of his guitar on Open All Night. <br>
<br>
Not for Springsteen, then, the folk-singer's default tendency to present
 these tales as if they were sonic museum pieces. The voice he found for
 Old Dan Tucker and John Henry sounded like a lifetime of cold showers 
-hoary, magnificent and alive. And, while his spoken introductions 
revealed a keenness to convey the history of these songs, he also wasted
 no opportunities to highlight their contemporary relevance. <br>
<br>
The mass displacement of Americans that is described in the Dust Bowl 
ballad My Oklahoma Home threw up parallels with scenes in New Orleans 
that, in the words of Springsteen, "none of us thought we would ever 
see". When his 18-piece band finally came to play the song, they did so 
like a phantom Mardi Gras, triggering a dip in the emotional temperature
 that rose only with a riotous Pay Me My Money Down. <br>
<br>
So Bruce Springsteen can now add the title of folk-singer to his long 
list of achievements. In fact, the writer of Born in the USA and 
Nebraska (from which he performed two numbers) was a already a 
folk-singer in every sense that mattered. <br>
<br>
It was a point gracefully underscored when he returned to encore with a 
Celtic soul reading of his own My City of Ruins from his post-9/11 song 
cycle The Rising. <br>
<br>
As Springsteen drove the song home to its affirmative gospel coda, the 
line between the Telecaster-wielding rock star of yore and his new 
downhome incarnation finally evaporated.</div>

<br>
San Francisco Chronicle , <br>
June 8, 2006<br>
By Joel Selvin<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen couldn't stop grinning. No fewer than 17 musicians 
were raising a fat, gleeful noise behind him, and he clearly relished 
every moment onstage Tuesday at the Sleep Train Pavilion in Concord with
 the mighty Seeger Sessions Band, the sprawling assemblage of folk and 
bluegrass musicians he used to record his latest album, "We Shall 
Overcome: The Seeger Sessions." <br>
<br>
A year after the acoustic noir of "Devils &amp; Dust," Springsteen is 
back with a tribute to America's great folksinger, Pete Seeger, who is 
still alive at age 87 to enjoy it. With the world in an uproar and the 
country going to hell, the time couldn't be better to resurrect some of 
Seeger's fiercely left-wing sentiments, his anti-war songs, his union 
songs. He is a man who fought to save the environment before they even 
called it that. And, unfortunately, his songs never have been more 
relevant. <br>
<br>
Springsteen has rescued from elementary school songbooks the American 
folk ballads that lie at the core of Seeger's repertoire and, indeed, of
 all American folklore -- "John Henry," "Oh Mary Don't You Weep," "Erie 
Canal," "Jesse James." Like Seeger, Springsteen understands the power of
 the American myth and, in a day and age when right-wing evangelicals 
routinely appropriate the country's most time-honored, fundamental 
emblems as their own, he seeks to reclaim and refresh some of the values
 these songs represent. <br>
<br>
With three or four guitars, an entire Dixieland-jazz horn section, 
banjo, accordion, steel guitar, keyboards, drums, bass, various other 
percussion and as many as seven or eight people singing, the Seeger 
Sessions Band didn't so much play the songs as overwhelm them. In a 
short black jacket and vest he borrowed from Johnny Cash, Springsteen 
gave the music his trademark full-throttle treatment, rasping and 
exhorting his way through all but one of the 13 songs from the new 
album, along with a few retooled songs from his back catalog. <br>
<br>
He repeated final choruses endlessly. He shamelessly dangled false 
endings at the crowd. He had the four-piece marching band section -- 
complete with sousaphone -- braying and blasting over almost every 
chorus. He used every trick in the trade to make these 100-year-old 
songs sound bigger than life. <br>
<br>
Springsteen gave his song "Atlantic City" an arrangement with banjo and 
fiddles. He turned "You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)" into 
zydeco. He tried out the Band's "Rag Mama Rag" and he matched the lyrics
 from his song "Ramrod" to the irresistible bounce of Nick Lowe's "Half a
 Boy and Half a Man." He put a Mardi Gras parade beat and furious 
acoustic guitar strumming under the remade "Johnny 99" -- "funk-folk" he
 called it. He turned his "Open All Night" from "Nebraska" into 
rollicking big-band swing. <br>
<br>
But the stamp of this cumbersome, wonderful band was so overpowering 
that even when he reached for the heartbreak in "How Can a Poor Man 
Stand Such Times," an old blues he rewrote into a piece about New 
Orleans after Katrina, the horns ended up giving the song a churchy 
Salvation Army Band sound. <br>
<br>
"We Shall Overcome," the song that sparked the project in the first 
place, Springsteen justly called "the most important political protest 
song in history." He also said, before he sang the soaring arrangement, 
that familiarity has made this song sink into the background. "People 
don't hear it so well," he said. Elementary school children all over 
America have no idea what the song is about. But it is utterly crucial 
to this country. And, again, it is a song whose relevance just won't go 
away. <br>
<br>
Joan Baez, who actually put the song on the charts in 1963, joined 
Springsteen for the flag-waver "Pay Me My Money Down." Her presence 
onstage was another important symbol. When she walks onstage, the 
anti-war movement and the history of non-violent protest comes with her.
 <br>
<br>
But when Springsteen gets the entire audience to scream "blown away" in 
"My Oklahoma Home" or sings the timeless lament of war, "Mrs. McGrath," 
he is not-so-subtly introducing subversive material. He went downright 
flagrant when he returned for his encore and, without further comment, 
sang a modified version of Seeger's own Vietnam rally cry, "Bring Them 
Home." <br>
<br>
Another song, alas, still relevant</div>

<br>
Albany Times Union , <br>
June 20, 2006<br>
By Greg Haymes<br>
<br>
It's counterintuitive to the basic premise of most arena rock shows, but
 the charm of Bruce Springsteen and his Seeger Sessions Band was not how
 tightly they played in concert, but rather how loosey-goosey they 
sounded. <br>
<br>
They were, as the saying goes, ragged but right. <br>
<br>
Backed by a sprawling, 16-piece orchestra that sounded like an odd but 
exceptionally endearing gumbo of ramblin' jug band, glorious gospel 
group and dizzying Dixieland jazz combo, Rock and Roll Hall of Famer 
Springsteen served up a heaping helping of folk-song war horses that 
many of us first learned back when we were in elementary school or 
summer camp. <br>
<br>
Of course, there were at least a few rock fans among the 10,000 or so at
 Saratoga Performing Arts Center on Monday night who were disappointed 
that no members of the E Street Band showed up to jam. Or that 
Springsteen didn't pull a fast one by slipping an acoustic, funkified 
rendition of "Rosalita" into the set list. And likewise, a few diehard 
folk purists might have hoped that Pete Seeger might make a trip from 
his Beacon home for a guest appearance, or that Springsteen would pay 
more than lip service to Seeger by pulling out "Turn, Turn, Turn" or 
"Waist Deep in the Big Muddy." <br>
<br>
But if Springsteen wants to spend his summer on the road playing such 
folk song chestnuts as "The Erie Canal," "John Henry" and "Old Dan 
Tucker," who's gonna tell him that he can't? After all, he is the Boss, 
isn't he? <br>
<br>
The fact is that the 56-year-old Springsteen sounded every bit the rock 
superstar that he was back when he recorded such blistering rock 
classics as "Born to Run" and "Thunder Road" more than 30 years ago. And
 that's certainly not a bad thing, no matter which side of the fence 
you're sittin' on. <br>
<br>
His singing was brimming over with intensity, passion and urgency, and 
the band put a multitude of stylistic spins on the basic folk songs. 
"Old Dan Tucker" and "Pay Me My Money Down" both went Cajun, while the 
Dust Bowl ballad "My Oklahoma Home" turned into a Western swing thing. 
"How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live" was peppered with 
mariachi horns, while "Open All Night" -- one of only a handful of 
Springsteen originals scattered throughout the show -- was transformed 
into an unbridled jump 'n' jive boogie-woogie. <br>
<br>
He returned "We Shall Overcome" -- the title track of the Seeger 
Sessions Band album -- to its gospel roots, delivering it more as a 
prayer of hope than an anthem of defiance. <br>
<br>
It didn't always work. There were times when the performance felt too 
slickly choreographed, like nothing more than a summer camp sing-along 
produced by Phil Spector. But Springsteen's passion always pulled it 
back up. <br>
<br>
The show had little -- or perhaps nothing -- to do with Pete Seeger, but
 if Springsteen wants to use his name as inspiration, let's hope he's 
got another tribute or two in him in the coming years.</div>
