“Bruce Springsteen’s longest season”<br>
By Robert Duncan<br>
<br>
The big news the week of October 20, 1975 was a rock star and a kid who ran into President Ford's limo in Hartford.<br>
Quick. What were their names? "Everyone will be famous for 15 minutes," 
Andy Warhol once said. I don't think James Falamites would argue with 
that.<br>
Through a misjudgment on the part of Hartford police and the Secret 
Service, Falamites was cleared to pass through a Hartford intersection 
and when he struck the President's passing limo, he gained his 15 
minutes of fame. Newspapers, magazines and news shows across the country
 ran this teenager's story and later in the month, he was introduced on 
Howard Cosell's ill-fated Saturday Night Live show (not to be confused 
with NBC's Saturday Night).<br>
I don't think the rock star would argue, either. The week of October 20,
 1975 he was out on a moderately successful tour of the Midwest when, in
 a quirk almost unprecedented in periodical publishing, he appeared as 
the cover subject on the nation's two biggest weekly news magazines, 
Time and Newsweek, simultaneously. It was a similar misjudgment to that 
of the Hartford police and the Secret Service. The news weeklies were 
tossing around words like "superstar" and "hit single" and "regeneration
 of rock" in relation to this virtual unknown. Naturally, the rock press
 had preceded them with even more lavish praise. When the ink settled, 
however, it may have also been just Bruce Springsteen's 15 minutes. <br>
In the 18 months since the press' premature ejaculation, Springsteen's 
career has followed a strangely familiar script. Actually, there are two
 or three plots progressing here.<br>
Most visible of the plots, and maybe most familiar to the show biz fans,
 has been his legal battle with what some may term his "rapacious" 
manager. The gist of it is, or so the reports go: he is not making very 
much money (relatively speaking) and his manager is. While at the same 
time, his manager is trying to tell him exactly what to do—up to 
forbidding him to enter a studio with friend/producer Jon Landau to 
record. Of course, this means that the follow-up to the much-vaunted 
Born To Run is way overdue, and Columbia Records (who is also involved 
in litigation) is extremely anxious. Worse, the public presumably is 
forgetting— cover stories of a year and a half ago or no, just like they
 did with what's-his-name who smashed up Ford's limo.<br>
The second of the plots here is that Springsteen is, even at this 
moment, out touring the country—specifically, the Midwest again—just as 
he has been on and off since all the hoopla hit the fan. In other words,
 he is leading the typical life of any upper mediumly successful rock 
'n' roller.<br>
But the punchline, what all rock soap opera fans are dying to know is: 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO BRUCE Springsteen? Is a quarter of an hour in the 
spotlight long enough—or perhaps too long—for the kid from Asbury Park?<br>
I can only argue as an unrepentant fan of Springsteen and tell what I've seen and heard over the past 18 months.<br>
To backtrack: I interviewed Springsteen in Detroit where I was working 
for CREEM back in October of '75. The Time/ Newsweek covers had yet 
happened. I had seen him only the week before in Ann Arbor and thought, 
while he talked too much onstage, shuffled about a lot like some sort of
 Jersey citybilly, the show was ultimately too slick. I'd expected true 
grit from the hype, and had never stopped to think that Born To Run was 
about as far from true grit as a symphony orchestra. I also never 
thought about the fact that the last thing an honest-to-goodness true 
grit person wanted to appear as onstage was an honest-to-goodness true 
grit person. When you come from a background as mundane as Springsteen 
does, you don't celebrate it—you celebrate release from it. You go for 
the larger than life. He wasn't going to be the bus driver's son, he 
would be James Dean or Marlon Brando. While Springsteen often wore a 
T-shirt and leather jacket, they were Brando's and Dean's wardrobe, 
strictly a Hollywood version of true grit.<br>
Something like that.<br>
Anyway, the point is, I went to see Springsteen a week later in Detroit 
proper to give him a second chance. He had shaken the cold by then that 
made him sniff like a junkie throughout his set in Ann Arbor, and he and
 his powerhouse band gave a great rock 'n' roll show. Afterwards, I was 
supposed to meet him, and over the protestations of an overprotective 
publicist (you know who you are), Springsteen invited me along to dinner
 with him and Miami Steve and one or two other of the band members. We 
seemed to be getting along great: loosened up (I'd like to think) by two
 beers (Remember? He doesn't drink or take drugs, Time told us), 
Springsteen spun some terrific stories about the agony of recording Born
 To Run, real tearjerkers about not being able to finish the damn thing 
and every night going back to his girlfriend at the hotel and almost 
crying. Great stuff.<br>
I fell in love.<br>
When Springsteen jumps on the roof of his publicist's car, I later 
report in my article about the romance ("Bruce Springsteen Is Not God 
And Doesn't Want to Be," CREEM, January '76—get it now!), I laugh. It's 
the kind of wanton nonsense I expect from Rock 'n' Roll Kings. And 
furthermore, I climbed aboard the Springsteen publicity bandwagon. (Next
 stop: backlash.) About the same time as the interview, Bom To Run made 
it to number one on the charts, even—despite what Time and Newsweek 
might have you believe about the title cut—without a hit single. Which 
is a big step towards fulfilling all the media's proclamations of 
"superstar" (Newsweek). Though, as it has become readily apparent to me 
from talking to him, Springsteen could care less. He'd like to make 
money, sure, and be comfortable, but this hype and this superstar 
nonsense is too much. (In the spring of last year, before his first 
performance in London, he is caught tearing down some "Future of Rock 
'n' Roll" posters in the lobby of the hall.)<br>
But my conversion is further confirmed when, a month and a half after 
our talk in Detroit, I'm walking down New York's fabled Eighth Street 
one evening and I'm accosted—in a friendly sort of way—by this 
collegiate-looking beard in a pinstriped shirt and pea coat who 
initially I take to be some long-forgotten asshole from high school. 
Only when I catch the glint of a little gold post in his ear do I put 
together the sinuous sleaze and the face.<br>
"Springsteen!" I shout, in surprise and embarrassment. And he keeps 
going on, friendly as ever, shuffling back and forth in the cold, one 
hand in his pocket, the other arm around Karen Darvin, his slender, shy,
 redheaded girlfriend. I presumed that he was pleased with me for one 
reason.<br>
"So you read the article?" I say.<br>
"No," he responded quizzically. "What? Where?" I tell him and we depart.
 He heads for the nearby newsstand. Did I say humble? Friendly? No 
pretentions whatsoever? I mean, this guy has been on the covers of Time 
and Newsweek.<br>
My love grows.<br>
Back in Detroit, three or four months later, I'm elated to find that 
Springsteen will be playing Lansing, about an hour and a half away. But,
 as it turns out, I'm unable to go to the concert because I have to work
 that night. I send along a note with friends that reads: "Go back to 
Jersey." The next day the phone message on my desk reads "B.S. called, 
wouldn't leave his name," and included a Cleveland phone number. I 
called. I didn't recognize the voice that answered, maybe because I 
don't believe that you call phone numbers and get rock stars instead of 
an endless stream of rock Nubians.<br>
Indeed, the "regeneration of rock" himself has answered his phone, and 
is trying to convince me to catch the show there the next night.<br>
The next day Springsteen and I and Peter Laughner are cruising Cleveland
 in Laughner's marginal automobile (B.S. has foregone the CBS rental 
car), with the oldies station on per Springsteen's request. In the 
meantime, Bruce elaborates on that great and largely unexamined group of
 musicians in rock 'n' roll known as Frat Bands, who include, among 
others, Hot Nuts and the Kingsmen ("Louie, Louie"), with special notice 
to the Swinging Medallions. Man, that was a band! (They did "Double Shot
 of My Baby's Love.")<br>
The concert, as expected, creased the roof—I mean, what do you expect 
from a Swinging Medallions fan—and Springsteen added a new unfinished 
ballad called "Frankie." There's a brief postconcert party—brief, 
because these guys do it all onstage—then Bruce Springsteen and the E<br>
Street Band are off in their bus, about which—well, the bus is one notch
 above the worst leaky Trailways you've ever been on, not something your
 average "Superstar" travels in (Johnny Rodriguez moves around in a 
five-bedroom, TV, stereo, bar, motel-on-wheels), more along the lines of
 a bus the Swinging Medallions might have used. <br>
In Wallingford, Connecticut, one of those adorable New England towns 
outside of New Haven, they have an institution called the Choate School.
 It's a fine prep school that boasts among its alumni John Kennedy and 
Robert Frost, but basically, like all prep schools, it's a 24-hour 
live-in day care center for the teenage children of the wealthy. It's 
May now, and I have just moved to New York from Detroit, when the phone 
rings one Friday, and a publicist friend at Columbia asks if I want to 
see Springsteen in Connecticut.<br>
"Where?" I inquired.<br>
"Choate," comes the unusual answer. Which takes me somewhat aback. The 
adorably quaint New Englandy Choate is just not my idea of a booking for
 Asbury Park's first cover boy. As it turns out, there are extraordinary
 motives at work.<br>
John Hammond has asked Bruce to do the show.<br>
John Hammond is retiring from Columbia after some 30 years as an A8R man
 (aka talent scout). John Hammond is the man who got recording contracts
 for Billie Holliday, Benny Goodman, Aretha Franklin, and Bob Dylan. In 
other words, this paper is too light to hold the reputation of Hammond 
and the respect accorded him in the music business. To top it off, John 
Hammond is an incredibly amiable polite person.<br>
And to top all that off, John also signed Bruce Springsteen to Columbia.
 (He told Newsweek for the cover story: "The kid absolutely knocked me 
out. I only hear somebody good every 10 years, and not only is Bruce the
 best, he was a lot better than Dylan when I first heard him.") In other
 words, were Bruce Springsteen the coldest-hearted bastard on the face 
of the earth, if John Hammond asked him for a favor for his (Hammond's) 
old school, he would do it, no questions asked.<br>
In the past 18 months I've seen Springsteen perform about 18 times, in 
all imaginable circumstances. I've seen him perform in New York, Detroit
 and Cleveland in halls for the money. I saw him do a few numbers at the
 Crawdaddy’s 10th anniversary party, and absolutely rivet the crowd. But
 I have never seen him, before or since, play like he did at Choate. And
 it certainly wasn't the audience—they loved him but expressed their 
love primarily by sitting in their seats, clapping their hands and 
wiping ketchup off their ties. Granted the Asbury gig with Southside was
 for love and fun, but it was Johnny's show, so Bruce laid off. When, 
after two and a half hours a totally exhausted, sweat-drenched 
Springsteen crashed into "Rosalita," it was clear that he wasn't getting
 paid. "This one's for John Hammond," he said. That's all. The fact that
 this may have been one of the greatest rock 'n' roll shows of all time 
ever is the purest tribute one could pay to Springsteen. He did it for 
love.<br>
STOP.<br>
The attitude was I can do rock 'n' roll like a motherfucker and this is 
how I do it. Thank-you-John Hammond-for-knowing-that. He never let up. 
At the end, if you knew him, you'd realize that here was a man capable 
of a chilling generosity to an audience and an art form. The man is 
fucking rock 'n' roll.<br>
Which is why he's not the rock 'n' roll savior. Because more than 
anything these days, rock 'n' roll is run like a sausage factory. Give 
us the three-minute sausage and smile, you bastards. While no one mourns
 the stinking hippies, and their 45-minute jumbled jams or the 
psychedelic posters, the three-minute sausage is not what it's about, 
either. It's about diabolical abandonment and humor. It's about wanting 
to rip your shoes in half, it's so good. Listen to "Born To Run." It's 
about that. It's about crazy.<br>
It's about not writing stories about guys like Bruce Springsteen. Which is why the motherfucker took me so long.<br>
I'll tell you what I think about Bruce. He's a road musician now, like 
he should be. Like he essentially wants to be. He's a working stiff in 
rock 'n' roll. Nothing highfalutin. No analysis. No cover stories. No 
tell-me-what-you-meant.<br>
I'll tell you what will happen to him. No matter the outcome of all this
 bullshit litigation, he will continue on the road. He will continue to 
write songs and he will be pretty fucking healthy and happy— because he 
doesn't take drugs or crap, he takes rock 'n' roll. And someday all the 
legal crap will be over (if it isn't by the time you read this). And 
someday he'll make the best rock 'n' roll album of all time. It may not 
be the next one or the one after, but someday. He can wait. I can wait. 
We have no choice. This man is the first rock 'n' roll musician I've 
ever met or read about or heard about or anything that could be a rock 
'n' roll musician the rest of his life and still come up with something 
great when he's 70. This guy is a student (OK, I know), but most of all 
he's a lover. With a giant rock 'n' roll dick.—</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Interview - The Expressen newspaper- Sweden<br>
November 6, 1980</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
“Springsteen has burned the tapes!” “Springsteen is crazy!”<br>
But the Bruce Springsteen I meet is healthy and strong. Bruce told the Expressen:<br>
“When there’s a long time between records a lot of stupid rumors get 
around. One paper prints them and suddenly they are the truth and I’m 
supposed to be crazy.”<br>
Springsteen is of course not crazy, and he hasn’t burned the tapes. What about the new LP, “The River”?<br>
“I had 45 songs to choose between and made a double album out of them. 
The title track is the best I’ve done! It’s in the “No Nukes” movie.”<br>
This is no proper interview with Bruce Springsteen, rather the result of
 an informal series of talks during three weeks in L.A. Bruce and 
producer Jon Landau were there to mix “The River.”<br>
“I’ve been on the West Coast for so long, but it’s been like a holiday. Look – my first sunburn for five years!”<br>
When the album is released a gigantic Springsteen tour starts, and it’s 
planned to finish in Europe in spring. 1975 saw him doing four European 
concerts, two in London and one each in Amsterdam and Sweden. That’s the
 only gigs he’s done outside North America!<br>
“I regret that we haven’t returned to Europe before, but we’re 
home-loving guys and we prefer the USA. But it was a kick to come to 
Europe and discover that everybody knew about us and knew our songs.”<br>
What about the manager and contract problems he had? Springsteen put out no records for three years.<br>
“I was in a trap. The classic story about the guy who signs an idiotic 
contract. I said No to any records, but I played like a maniac, because 
that’s what I like, playing in front of an audience.”<br>
“Everything went so fast. I was on the cover of Time and Newsweek and on
 the way to becoming something I wasn’t and I didn’t want to be. I was 
on the way to being sucked up in the music biz and exploited.”<br>
Many people say that it’s impossible to keep your own personality and at the same time be a superstar in the music industry.<br>
“Bullshit! It’s just to say No – in time. If you’re young and suddenly 
turn famous, everything is lying in front of you – girls, booze, drugs 
and stuff like that. If you start taking drugs you’re an easy victim for
 the record company.”<br>
“I said No to everything! No, I bought a house and a car. I’m living the
 same way I’ve always done. Still with the same friends and nearly the 
same band as in my teens.”<br>
“Up to the “Darkness” LP we were constantly broke. I could have been 
rich by now, but I feel a great satisfaction that I never sold myself to
 drugs or the record company.”<br>
“Rich or poor, however you see it, I’m in a very enviable situation. I 
can sleep in the mornings and do what I like best in the evenings – 
play!”<br>
It’s more than two years since “Darkness on the Edge of Town” came out. Making a record is a long process for Springsteen:<br>
“Of course I could have done an album a year, but would they have been 
good? I have responsibility to myself and the fans. I won’t release 
anything I’m not satisfied with, what I don’t have my heart and soul in.
 When I release the new album both I and the fans know that it’s good. 
If people aren’t ready to wait, then they weren’t interested in the 
first place.”<br>
As a passionate record collector and rock lover he also feels a big 
responsibility towards older rock music. All his concerts feature old 
rock classics:<br>
“I’ve got the same musical background as most 31-year-olds: Stones, 
Beatles, Kinks. When the guitar solos went on too long at the end of the
 60s I lost interest. Luckily my elder cousin had a goldmine of singles.
 All rock, R&amp;B and soul from the 40s and 50s. There I found my 
roots. I play these old songs on stage because I want to show young fans
 that it wasn’t Van Halen or some other idiot who discovered rock 
music.”<br>
Bruce is satisfied with his records so far, but says about the “Darkness” album:<br>
“Today I think it’s too dark. I’m really a happy person – that will show on the new album.”<br>
Any favorite records you listen to now?<br>
“When I work on an album I don’t listen to any other music. I’m very 
easily influenced, and if there’s a lot of good music I’ll pick up riffs
 and sounds from so many records that in the end I won’t know what’s 
mine. But I can give you one name I’ll always stand for: Graham Parker. 
Why he isn’t bigger in the States is remarkable and a shame.”<br>
When we were talking about old records I mentioned that the Sir Douglas Quintet had reformed. Bruce exclaimed:<br>
“What?! My God, that’s one of the legendary groups. In the beginning of 
the 70s I played a lot with Augie Meyers in Texas and I felt like a fan,
 I loved that music.”<br>
Today Jon Landau, prominent rock critic, is producer and manager of 
Bruce Springsteen. It was Landau who made the famous quote “I have seen 
rock future, and its name is Bruce Springsteen,” and he and Bruce have 
become good friends:<br>
“I produced some records when I was at college, so I wasn’t worried when
 Bruce asked me to help him in the studio. I had no experience as a 
manager, but when Bruce asked me I agreed.”<br>
He stopped writing (“After ten years as a rock writer I had said all I wanted to say”) and devoted his time wholly to Bruce…<br>
“As you have seen, Bruce is a very special artist. He is his own boss 
and tells everyone what to do. But that’s good, it makes him unique and 
exciting. Now he’ll come to Europe. I think it’ll be in March, because 
it’s really cold in January and February.”</div>

“Is this your car, Sir?”	by Mark Blake</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
They always said he should get out more and now he has. With a lush 
photo-book, a cherry-plucking anthology LP, a tour with the E Street 
Band: it’s all go chez Bruce Springsteen, soon to be 50 years young. “I 
was in the mood,” he tells Mark Blake.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is remembering the stresses of youth: “Back then, 
you’re all like…er,” he trails off, struggling to find the words to 
express himself, “you’re all, like, caught up in this pressure to look a
 certain way, to act a certain way, to be something.” The huskily 
familiar New Jerseyite voice scrambles around trying to make a point. 
Briefly, this 49-year-old multi-millionaire – arguably one of 
rock’n’roll’s most iconic performers – sounds every inch the shy, 
inarticulate, causeless rebel of one of his early songs. Finding his 
feet again, Springsteen chuckles warmly and finishes up: “When you get 
older, though, it’s like…aaah, what the hell…”<br>
This shoulder-shrugging statement partly explains the publication of 
Songs, the book of his 25-year career, comprising original lyrics, 
previously unseen photographs and comments by the man himself. Closely 
following the Tracks box set, which scoured the vaults for previously 
unheard material, and which reappears in April in scaled-down form as 18
 Tracks, Songs is yet another revealing project that contradicts the 
popular notion of Springsteen as rock’n’roll’s most private artist.<br>
In an equally unexpected move, he’s just announced the re-formation of 
the E Street Band and an accompanying world tour, including British 
dates in May. Flitting between the folk noir of his last solo record, 
The Ghost of Tom Joad, and the crowd-thrilling nostalgia trail in the 
blink of an eye, the supposedly stolid Springsteen is suddenly pulling a
 string of surprises.<br>
<br>
Why have you chosen to work with the E Street Band again after all this time?<br>
<br>
It’s been twenty-five years since we started and it felt right. After 
The Ghost of Tom Joad I was in the mood to do some loud music again 
(laughs). I had a couple of new records I was working on that were a mix
 of acoustic and electric tracks and as soon as I began on the electric 
tracks I realized that I wanted to play in a band again and that I 
wanted it to be that particular band.<br>
<br>
Some of the group seemed aggrieved that you’d dropped them in the first place. Did it end as badly as it looked?<br>
<br>
I admit it was a funny sort of ending. It was reported at the time as 
being a break-up. All that happened was that I made a decision to work 
with other musicians. We were all in our late-thirties and we’d spent 
all of our adult lives as part of this gang. We were all so deeply, 
deeply connected with one another and each other’s lives and it was time
 for a change. I made some phone calls and said, Look, I want to take a 
break from this, but a few years down the line, who knows? That’s all 
that happened.<br>
<br>
Are you older and wiser now?<br>
<br>
Older, sure. I don’t know…I think the break had a different effect on 
everybody. I spoke to the guys over the years and they all admitted that
 it gave them a chance to discover new things – Steve [Van Zandt, 
guitar] got into acting, Garry [Tallent, bass] went to Nashville to 
produce records, Max [Weinberg, drums] became a bandleader and went into
 TV.<br>
<br>
Are you tired of playing Born to Run yet?<br>
<br>
That’s the nice thing about not having played it in a while (laughs). 
We’ve been rehearsing for almost a month now and it’s actually quite 
enjoyable to be playing some of those old songs again. We haven’t even 
settled on a set list yet, but we’ve been running through stuff off the 
very first record right up to Tom Joad. We just have to find a way to 
make everything work with the band.<br>
<br>
Last year’s Tracks boxed set, now the Songs book: why the sudden urge to bare all?<br>
<br>
After Tom Joad I just wanted to spend some time re-presenting a large 
body of my work. Tracks was a big part of that, reappraising things I’d 
done as far back as when I started out – making some of this lost music 
available. The Songs book is a part of that and so, I guess, is the 
tour. Twenty-five years on I want to re-connect with the audience that 
has sustained me since I was very young. Back then you’re very concerned
 with presenting yourself a certain way. Years later, the pressure’s not
 there and it doesn’t need to be so private any more.<br>
<br>
Are there photographs in the Songs book that you wish you could have kept private?<br>
<br>
Yeah (laughs). I was embarrassed by some of them. I was going through 
the pictures at the same time as I was choosing material for Tracks and 
it was a very strange feeling – it was a summer of nostalgia and 
retrospection.<br>
<br>
How easy was it for you to write about yourself in the book?<br>
<br>
I now have total respect for anybody who writes without a guitar in 
their hands. I was used to doing interviews so I figured it would be 
easy. It wasn’t. I wrote a whole bunch of stuff that I thought was great
 and then I went back and read it again. In the end I had Bob Santelli 
(the book’s editor) give me a little guidance and I sat down, wrote 
about what was happening in my life at the time and what shifted my 
songwriting into a certain direction and kept it short, real short.<br>
<br>
Did you make a conscious decision to keep all those original song lyrics?<br>
<br>
Two things I’ve always held on to is my original guitar and my 
notebooks. Everything else can go burn. These things I keep close. I 
don’t have some of my very, very early ones, but I have almost 
everything since Darkness on the Edge of Town. It’s strange. In the old 
days I’d write my verses and if I thought one of them was a stinker I’d 
be like, Throw it in the trash, don’t let anyone see it. Now it’s 
interesting how those songs ended up how they did and how they got here.<br>
<br>
There’s an interesting note to Jon Landau (Springsteen’s manager) circa 
Nebraska, where you mention that one new song, Born in the U.S.A, “might
 have potential”…<br>
<br>
I remember. At the time that version wasn’t working out, but I figured 
that if I could connect a good song to this line “I was born in the 
U.S.A” I could be onto something (laughs). Sometimes you do know when 
something’s going to happen – Dancing in the Dark I knew was a hit, the 
same with Hungry Heart. That stuff was pure pop, but you don’t always 
know, sometimes you just have an inkling.<br>
<br>
How important is it for you to have hit singles?<br>
<br>
Lately I haven’t seen myself as being in the hit singles business, but 
it’s never primarily been what I do. I make albums. I get a kick out of 
having hit records, but I want to stick with my audience for a long 
time, I want to move with them and somehow that’s always seemed more 
important than chasing hits. When you settle into that way of working 
you become a horse in a horse race.<br>
<br>
Why did you slow down your work rate over the last 10 years?<br>
<br>
How made records have I made in ‘90s…(Pauses, mumbles) Tunnel…Human 
Touch…Lucky… Tom Joad. Y’know, before I used to be a five albums a 
decade man. I guess I’ve been busy these last ten years putting my 
family together. I did make a whole album in the middle of the ‘90s that
 I chose not to put out. So that took up a year…<br>
<br>
Why didn’t you release it?<br>
<br>
It was very internal, very relationship-based and after Tunnel of Love, 
Lucky Town and Human Touch, I didn’t feel like another one. But as soon 
as I find another window – something like Tracks – I will put it out. I 
think it was a pretty good record.<br>
<br>
What’s the best thing you’ve heard in the last 12 months?<br>
<br>
Beth Orton’s Trailer Park is my favorite record of the past ten years 
(excitedly). She has a new album out? Great. I’ll buy that. Lauryn Hill,
 Wyclef Jean, they’re good records too. I also listen to a lot of what 
they’re now calling alternative country – Wilco, Whiskeytown, bands like
 that…<br>
<br>
Do you think some of those bands sound like you?<br>
<br>
It’s just a country thing. I became a big fan of that music in my 
mid-twenties, when I was looking for a way to address more adult topics 
and that started to come across in my music. Like I’m on Fire – that was
 me trying to sound like Johnny Cash’s Tennessee Three. It’s country 
music and you’re hearing that in me and in those bands.<br>
<br>
There’s some great pictures of you and your cars in this book…<br>
<br>
There’s so many pictures of me and my cars I’ve lost count (laughs). But
 I’ve never bought collector’s items, they’ve always been what I call 
“drivers.” What am I running these days? A Ford Explorer for getting 
from A to B…a ’48 Chevy truck, a ’63 Impala – that’s a Californian 
gangster car that Gary US Bonds gave me years ago. A Cadillac, of 
course. A Triumph motorcycle, an Indian…er (starts to sound embarrassed 
by number of cars owned) a, er, Harley Davidson…But like I said, they’re
 all drivers.<br>
<br>
You came to London for the court case earlier this year (Springsteen 
sued UK label Masquerade for releasing “inferior” early-70s material). 
Do you come here often?<br>
<br>
To be honest, I’m not a big traveler. I do so much when I’m touring that
 I stay home when I’m not on the road. I was only there for a couple of 
days. Where did I stay? (Pauses, then laughs) The hotel where Frank 
Sinatra used to stay…y’know, that’s all they told me.<br>
<br>
Do you get hassled in the street much?<br>
Not too much. I’m lucky like that. I can go about my business. If I go 
check out a big show you’ll hear “Brooce, Brooce” and people want 
autographs but most of the time it’s OK.<br>
<br>
What motivates you now?<br>
<br>
The same things that did before. I’m still excited when I sit down with a
 guitar and I want to get a story across. It’s as natural to me as the 
need to eat or the pursuit of love (laughs). I’ve got songs written now 
and I’m frustrated that I can’t put them out tomorrow. The feeling 
doesn’t go away.<br>
<br>
Did you ever think you’d spend your 50th birthday on the road with the E Street Band?<br>
<br>
Nope. It sounds good, though. I’m lucky in that I feel happy with my 
life and I’ve managed to sustain all the relationships that ever meant 
anything to me. I still feel very young, except now I have what I didn’t
 have twenty, maybe even fifteen, years ago, which is a bit of 
perspective. I’m looking forward to spending my birthday surrounded by 
the people with whom I’ve had my most adventures with. There isn’t 
anybody else I’d rather be with.</div>

“Tunnel tour takes him on career detour”<br>
By Edna Gundersen</strong><br>
<br>
PHILADELPHIA – It’s 1:30 a.m and Bruce Springsteen sits on a couch in 
his dressing room, an untouched slice of cake on the coffee table. He 
unwinds in this makeshift sanctum while the hall outside buzzes with 
friends, band members, program-clutching fans.<br>
Though a forbidding vision in black, from linen shirt to silver-tipped 
boots, Springsteen is vibrant. Surprisingly so for someone who’s labored
 four hours blowing the roof off the Spectrum, sixth stop on a new trail
 he’s blazing: the Tunnel of Love Express tour.<br>
“We’re really happy because we’re doing quite a bit of stuff that people
 completely haven’t heard at all or have only heard very little,” he 
says during a rare interview that reveals what motivated this course. 
The show draws heavily from the sober Tunnel of Love LP and favors 
obscure slices like I’m a Coward, a revamped Geno Washington tune.<br>
He says, “If you get a good band and play that stuff real well and 
present it in a clear and concise fashion – and the audience is 
receptive, which the audiences have been – then you can do whatever you 
want to do.<br>
Clearly, Springsteen is doing exactly what he wants to. Enough of the 
38-year-old’s still brash and indefatigable spirit remains (in fire and 
brimstone like Rosalita) so that the audience is not disoriented. But he
 has consciously crafted a show that confounds expectations and veers 
wildly from the blistering battle hymns and stadium hysteria of his 
triumphant Born in the U.S.A tour.<br>
“I knew if I was going to go out, I was going to do something 
thematically different,” he says. “I felt like the time to break with 
the past a little bit.”<br>
Springsteen first envisioned a total departure: an acoustic show. He then considered a half-acoustic, half-Tunnel mix.<br>
“I thought about doing every conceivable combination,” he says. “And I 
realized that basically the integration of everything I do is always the
 most exciting thing – it’s the most physical and the most fun for me. I
 thought if I did an acoustic tour it would end up being too cerebral. 
It didn’t make any sense to limit myself.”<br>
The result: a pastiche of songs that underscores the dashed notions of 
utopian romance faced in Tunnel of Love, his ninth and most cohesive LP.<br>
“The idea was to find stuff that fit in the Tunnel of Love idea,” he 
says. “I figured I would put down the things that have been the 
cornerstones of the show for 10 years – put those away, give them a rest
 till it feels right to play them again. You put down all the things 
that become clichés.”<br>
Thus discarded staples like Badlands and Thunder Road are supplanted by 
fresh gambles: a reggae-fueled Part Man, Part Monkey, blustery 
decade-old Roulette (the B-side of One Step Up) and Tunnel’s harrowing 
parables.<br>
“If you keep doing what you’ve been doing, you’re just an oldies act,” 
Springsteen says with a laugh. “We didn’t want to do that.”<br>
Signposts throughout the concert mark a detour from tradition: He 
introduces Spare Parts as a song “about the struggle to let the past 
go…The past is something that binds us together and at the same time it 
holds us back.”<br>
What may surprise longtime fans most is the Express tour’s unvarying 
script, a reversal of the dizzying improvisations of the past. A few 
surprises have cropped up – 10th Avenue Freezeout, Raise Your Hand, Love
 Me Tender – but Springsteen is clinging to an agenda.<br>
“I planned it very specifically, because we were doing what for us would
 be a relatively short tour,” he says. The Express “is a show. It is 
specific. The songs all integrate and resonate off each other. We’re 
only playing a couple of nights in each city. Changing the show a lot 
came from playing so many multiple nights in different cities. This show
 is not as loose. It has much more focus.” <br>
The uncompromising restraint of Tunnel of Love, which Springsteen 
considers one of his best, in no way squelches the singer’s ferocity. 
Nor does its intimate tone suffer in full-band treatments.<br>
“It was basically stripped-down soul music, so I just fleshed it out, 
put the horns in there and got into the mood of it. And it translates 
real easily in a very relaxed fashion to a big stage. It’s very funny, 
because a lot of the audience is still unfamiliar with a lot of the 
Tunnel of Love material, which means they probably haven’t bought the 
record.”<br>
He grins and shrugs. “That’s good. I get a chance to present it. I get a
 chance to reintroduce myself as a songwriter and as just a guy in a 
band.”<br>
The Tunnel material “invites them in and you get your ideas across. The 
stuff tends to be very musical and people can hear the ideas, the 
words.”<br>
“As I got older…it felt like that guy and that girl were out there 
searching for something better, looking outward into the world, trying 
to find a place where they can stand and grow up a little bit. So, I 
guess as I’ve gotten older that’s what I’ve tried to do, find some sort 
of home for myself”<br>
He spent six months composing Born to Run. Today, the words come easier.<br>
“My writing tends to get easier as I get older, because I tend to be 
more open to it and less afraid of it, less afraid of what’s going to 
come out,” he says.<br>
“I have less of a desire to control my output, to control what’s coming 
out. Writing a good song is never easy, but it’s not as pained and I 
don’t put myself through a lot of extraneous bull like I used to 10 
years ago. Some of the Tunnel of Love songs I wrote real quickly. The 
only trick to writing a new song is you have to have a new idea. And to 
have a new idea you gotta be a little bit of a new person, so that’s 
where the challenge is.”<br>
Springsteen felt no pressure to match the profits of Born in the U.S.A, 
18 million copies sold worldwide. Tunnel has sold 5 million. “I’m living
 to do something new, not necessarily to top myself,“ he says. “If you 
get into that, you’re just into a game, and it’s not very interesting. 
Plus, it’s a losing game. I’m just trying to grow and learn some things 
and find some new things in my job and in my music and present to my 
audience.”<br>
It’s no accident Springsteen’s Tunnel departure arrives on the heels of 
Live/1975-85, a rollicking retrospective that seemed to close the door 
on youthful abandon. Springsteen recalls listening to all five records 
with his band:<br>
“We played it in my room,” he says. “We all sat there and listened to 
it. And I said, ‘Well, 10 years, there it is. When you have those little
 babies and they want to know what you did these past 10 years, you play
 them this record.’ I think it’s something to be proud of.”</div>

“Return of the Native”<br>
By Mike Greenblatt<br>
The interview took place on September 23, 1978, Bruce’s 29th birthday.</strong><br>
<br>
We've been sitting on a bench facing the ocean near the Casino Arena in 
Asbury Park. It's 45 minutes past our appointed meeting time with Bruce 
Springsteen and we're trying to light matches in the wind. It's past 
1:30 now and we're wondering if he's going to show up. Hell, it's a 
beautiful sunny fall day, one of his very few days off from a grueling 
whirlwind tour of the country. And it's his birthday to boot. Maybe he 
just ain't gonna show.<br>
But we're determined. We're prepared to wait for two more hours. Then, 
if he's still not here, we'll split. We've already tired of scrutinizing
 all the faces for something that will tell us it's him in disguise. We 
forgot our quest and go back to the matches.<br>
"Hi", he says as he walks right up at us. "Sorry I'm late, I just got 
up." He's dressed in a blueish work-shirt and jeans. He has ever-present
 sunglasses on. We decide to break the ice over lunch.<br>
Settling into a booth at the Convention Hall Coffee Shop, I order a BLT,
 photographer Sorce a cheeseburger, and Bruce a hamburger, french fries 
and coke.<br>
!Yeah, we had a real rep", Bruce starts to say. "We could draw two, 
maybe three thousand people on any given night. We played our own 
concerts here and also down south. It's weird. Nobody would ever book us
 because we never did any Top-40. Never. We used to play all old soul 
stuff. Chuck Berry, just the thing we liked. That's why we couldn't get 
booked. We made enough to eat though."<br>
The waitresses are starting to mill about the table so Bruce puts his 
shades back on and hushes up his tone. "The other night was amazing", he
 whispers. "I went to see Animal House, and when I came out of the 
theater there was a whole bunch of people that started following me to 
the parking lot. I wound up signing autographs for over an hour."<br>
"Anyway, after a while the kicks started to wear off and a lot of the 
time we didn't make enough to eat. That's why I signed with Mike 
(Appel). Anything was better than what was happening at the time."<br>
Little did the local rocker know that this early signing with Mike Appel
 would result in the latter claiming rights to the early material 
Springsteen had written. The rest of the courtroom drama is famous. 
Perhaps generously, Bruce had nothing bad to say about his former 
manager.<br>
"He did a lot of good for me at that time", he says, dipping one 
particularly long french fry into a mound of ketchup. "He introduced me 
to John Hammond (CBS bigwig responsible for signing Dylan, Aretha 
Franklin, Billie Holiday, Bessie Smith and others). He helped me on that
 first album". He pauses as if he were ruminating on something. "I 
haven't seen him since that day."<br>
"Actually, I was pretty shielded from the whole thing", he continues. 
"Mike put the onus on Jon (Landau), claiming he was the culprit."<br>
I ask: You mean he charged Landau with stealing you away from him?<br>
"Yeah, sort of. I was never good at the business end of things."<br>
Asked about the famous line Landau wrote for his Real Paper review ("I 
saw rock and roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen"), Bruce 
says, "That line is misrepresentative of the whole review. It's funny. 
The review was nothing like that one line. It got taken out of context" -
 another myth shattered.<br>
"I remember playing in a club where an earlier review that Jon wrote was
 splashed all over the outside wall. I was leaning against the wall, 
smoking a cigarette, when Jon practically bumped right into me. I had 
never met him. We hit it off right away."<br>
"When asked if he ever gave up during the long months of inactivity, 
Bruce still remains bright, completely devoid of bitterness." I knew 
that it was just a matter of time. We were playing almost throughout 
that whole episode even though we weren't supposed to. I mean, what kind
 of law is it that is written specifically to stop a man from doing what
 he does to make his money?"<br>
"The only real frustrating thing which did cause me grief was the fact 
that my songs weren't my own. I didn't own my own songs. That hurt."<br>
But that makes it all the more satisfying now. At Nassau Coliseum, 
thousands of kids screaming their guts out for him before he even played
 a song. They didn't let up until he finished, drained and exhausted. At
 the Capitol Theatre, two nights before, he was surprised onstage by a 
giant birthday cake out of which a scantily clad girl bounced. He swears
 he didn't know a thing about it ("I even told John Scher no cakes"). At
 Madison square Garden, 18,000 fans leand on every note as if it were 
the last they would ever hear. A gala party was held for him in the 
plush Penn Plaza Club located deep inside the bowels of the Garden. 
Security was the tightest I'd ever witnessed.<br>
We paid for the food and split for the beach. The conversation continued
 amid the sea, the wind and the hovering presence of the Casino Arena.<br>
"I'm into a little photography myself", Bruce says as Sorce adjusts his 
light meter. "I took some pictures of Lynnie (Lynn Goldsmith, 
photographer) that were published somewhere."<br>
When asked about his other interests, Bruce talks of softball. "Yeah, we
 used to play hard. we had to stop, though, when Clarence and myself 
used to get too battered up. We'd go on stage all wracked up and it 
would hurt. After a while, it got too important and too many people were
 into it. There's no softball on this tour. What else do I like? Hmmm, 
I'll tell ya...not too much besides music. Right now, music is it. I 
don't care about anything else."<br>
We get back to talking of copy bands and the difference between making 
it with your own material and making good money playing copies. I tell 
Bruce I had to play "Shake Your Booty" to get booked anywhere.<br>
"Shake Your Booty?" laughs Bruce, falling into the sand. "That's a great
 song. KC, man, he's great! He always comes out with those repetitive 
things. Over and over and over, that kind of stuff is great! It's like 
the 'Louie, Louie' of today."<br>
Later on, in talking about what is written about him, he says, "I have 
Glen (Glen Brunman, CBS publicist) mail me everything that's written 
about me. Hundreds of things, man. I read them all at once. That way I 
can get a pretty good perspective on what my press is like, rather than 
reading one thing at a time."<br>
"Near the end of Darkness, I wasn't doing any interviews", Bruce 
continues. "Then I did them until I noticed myself saying the same 
things to different people. There's only one answer to each question; 
you don't want to lie to these people. I really had myself in a spin. 
And each interview was a multiple interview situation with two or three 
people at once. I guess the problem was that I did too many of 'em." <br>
Walking off the beach, we talk of the Garden shows and his stretcher 
routine, whereby he sings himself silly until he has to be taken off the
 stage in a stretcher, only to break free and grab the microphone again 
until he's forcibly restrained from the stage.<br>
That's a great routine. Where'd you get that from? I ask. I know that 
professional wrestling has a stretcher routine where the good guy gets 
beat so bad they have to carry him off in a stretcher and the bad guy 
always kicks him off of it as it passes by. It's classic.<br>
"No", answers Bruce, "I didn't even know about that. We got it from 
James Brown. He used to get himself so worked up that the bassist led 
him offstage wrapped in a cape. He'd throw the cape off his shoulders 
and come running back to the mikestand some two or three times. It drove
 'em wild. So that's where we got the idea for the stretcher routine."<br>
Sliding into the front seat of a borrowed '78 burnt yellow Camaro, Bruce
 at the wheel, we're on our way to the neighborhood where he grew up in 
Freehold. Shoving a cassette into the receptacle, he says, "A fan gave 
this to me outside a concert once. It's real good tape."<br>
He turns up the volume, guns the motor and shifts into second. We take 
off. He turns up the volume a little more and starts looking for "Hello 
Mary Lou" by Rick Nelson. "This song has one of the greatest guitar 
parts ever on it."<br>
He can't find the tune and settles for oldies like "If You Wanna Be 
Happy For the Rest of Your Life (Never Make a Pretty Woman your Wife)" 
and "Blue Suede Shoes". He shifts into third.<br>
Now for the first time, we do not talk. The music is loud and damn 
appealing. The windows are down so the wind is whipping furiously into 
the car. He shifts into fourth and takes off.<br>
We're rolling now. We settle uncomfortably behind a slow driver. He 
checks his rear-view mirror and roars past the driver. Seeing another 
slow-mover right ahead, he stays in the opposite lane and passes two in 
one fell swoop before settling comfortably back on the right. From the 
back, Sorce lets out a soft "Whew!"<br>
It's great moment. Chuck Berry is wailing out with "Maybelline". Bruce 
is going faster. It's such a fuckin' beautiful day. The wind is rushing 
in and Bruce is feeling good, snapping his fingers, clapping his hands 
and letting out with a hoarse vocal or two on the last line of each 
verse. "Hello Mary Lou" finally comes on and suddenly everything is 
crystallized in one magic moment - the speed, the music, the sun, the 
wind, the company. Jeezez Christ! We're rolling down the highway with 
fuckin' Bruce Springsteen at the wheel! And he's driving the way you 
would think Bruce Springsteen would drive.<br>
Later, when we reach a light, Bruce impatiently waits on it before 
saying, "This is what we used to call a 'quarterback sneak'"", and with 
that he takes off surreptitiously past the red light.<br>
We're in the old neighborhood now. Bruce drives slowly down Institute 
Street until he reaches the right number. It's been painted now. "I 
lived here all through grammar school. There's a Nestle's factory near 
here. Man, when it rained we smelled that stuff all day long."<br>
The elder Springsteen would go to work in the morning, come home, go to 
sleep and wake up and go back to work at the factory. "I guess there was
 other things he wanted," Bruce reflects.<br>
We get back into the car and drive over to the factory. "Both my 
grandfather and my father worked here. It used to be a rug mill in the 
old days, but for some reason it ran out of business fairly quick. I was
 pretty young at the time."<br>
When I ask about high school, Bruce clams up. "It wasn't exactly the 
best time of my life because I didn't graduate with any of the others. 
It was a rough period." I could see he really doesn't pursue this avenue
 too long so I drop it. But I wonder what mystery is veiled beneath this
 wall of secrecy.<br>
We get back into the car and tear out of there. Ironically enough, the 
tape Bruce shoves into the machine this time is an old Animals cassette.
 The first song could be a forerunner to much of the music Bruce writes.
 As the opening line comes out of the speakers, the dusty factory is 
just fading from view..."In this dirty old part of the city/Where the 
sun refuses to shine/People say that there ain't no use in trying/My 
little girl you're so young and pretty/And one thing I know is 
true/You'll be dead before your time is due, yes you will/See my daddy 
in bed ad night/See his hair a' turnin' grey/He's been working and 
slaving his life away, yes he has. The song is, of cours, "We Gotta Get 
Out of This Place", and it was a fitting omen as we drove off.<br>
As we drove, Bruce starts reminiscing. "Yeah, I lived in practically 
every single town around here, from Atlantic Highlands to Bradley Beach.
 We used to move quite often.<br>
"That's where I had my very first gig," he laughs as we pass a mobile 
setup. Looking out of the window, the 10 or 20 mobile homes facing us 
look worn and old. "The gig wasn't bad...for our first job."<br>
Hey Bruce, are you gonna show up at the Capitol again like you did last 
year on New Year's Eve? I ask him. It was announced earlier in the week 
that Southside Johnny &amp; the Asbury Jukes would again party away the 
year in such grand fashion. Bruce turns around and answers, "I don't 
know where I'm gonna be on New Year's Eve.<br>
"C'mon, I'll show you where my surfin' buddies used to live," he says, 
changing the subject. We swerve sharply off the highway onto an exit. 
"This used to be a surfboard factory," he says. We step out of the car 
near a small white building.<br>
"Yeah, me and a fella named Tinker lived here for a year and a half, in 
one room. All the rest of this area used to be nothin' but sand dunes." 
He points to a huge expanse of stores, houses and construction. "None of
 this was here."<br>
"They used to make the surfboards downstairs. Tinker and I, we had a 
ball. Just one room! Two beds, a fridge and a TV - the rest of the room 
was filled with surfboards."<br>
"Since I was from Freehold, I was considered inland. All these guys used
 to surf every day. I was friends with 'em all but never went. Finally, 
they got to me. One afternoon they were merciless. They just kept 
taunting me and kidding me about not surfing that it just sorta got me 
riled. I grabbed a board and we all headed out to the beach.<br>
"I must have been some sight surfing for the first time, but I'll tell 
you something - I got the hang of it pretty quick. Hell, it ain't harder
 than anything else. It's like riding a bike. I haven't surfed in 
awhile. Now that's something I'd love to do. As a matter of fact, I 
think I will."<br>
He seems resolute.<br>
He continues: "This guy Jesse taught me the finer points of surfing. We 
used to stay in North End Beach in Long Branch all the time. Some guy 
owned the beach so we had the use of it for almost two whole years. We'd
 be there every day. We'd stay on the beach, go in the water. It was 
great.<br>
"This area is really amazing. There's really poor neighborhoods and then
 there's real nice neighborhoods all in a five-mile radius.<br>
"I used to go to New York a lot back then. I played at the Cafe Wha? a 
lot in '68. I used to play there with Jerry Walker's old group, Circus 
Maximus. Let's see, I played the Night Owl (all these places were in the
 West Village). They had a lot of good bands there at the time - the 
Raves, Robin &amp; the Hoods. Let's see, the Mothers of Invention were 
playing all the time in that area and so were the Fugs.<br>
"I didn't go to too many concerts then. I much preferred playing and 
jamming with these people. There was a whole 'nother scene taking place 
over in the East Village that I wasn't part of at all - the Fillmore, 
the Electric Circus. I think my first experience seeing a rock star was 
going to Steve Paul's Scene and seeing Johnny Winter. That was really 
something. I remember between sets, he came out and sat at the very next
 table from me and my friends."<br>
Let's go back to Asbury, I suggest.<br>
Asking Bruce if he'd take me back to the old Upstage site where he held 
court almost every night, he gladly obliges and we get out of the car 
again in what could be termed downtown Asbury.<br>
"I gotta be cool," Bruce chuckles. "I ran out of here without paying the rent."<br>
We walk over to the site, which is upstairs from a shoe store.<br>
"I lived here while Greetings From Asbury Park was being made. I slept 
in my sleeping bag on my friend's floor for a good portion of that 
album."<br>
Bruce poses for pics while people pass by right and left. Surprisingly 
enough, nobody recognizes him (or if they do, they keep on walking).<br>
"I'm lucky in that respect. What happened in the movies the other night 
is a rarity. Usually, I don't get recognized. I don't have that 
instantly recognizable feature that a lot of other people have."<br>
Yeah, like Frampton's hair, I reply.<br>
"My folks had already moved to California," Bruce remembers, "and I was out of high school by the time I got to Asbury.<br>
"Upstage was a great place for us to play. We played here an awful lot."<br>
In answering questions about his immediate future, Bruce says, "I have 
one more day off before we finish the tour. Then I have a whole month 
off before we start up again. In February we go back into the studio for
 work on the next album. I'm hoping it will be out by next summer."<br>
Just for the record, the tour ended officially in Atlanta on Oct. 1. It 
started in Buffalo on May 23. The new tour starts (possibly in New 
Jersey) on Nov. 1 and finishes by Dec. 20. If the time it took to cut 
Darkness is any indicator, then number five will be lucky to hit the 
stands by the summer after next.<br>
The just-finished tour took in 70 cities and 86 shows in four months and
 eight days. That's why Bruce has to be listed as a "great guy" to do up
 an afternoon on one of his rare days off. Another highly impressive 
thing is that he spent the whole day without the protective cradle of a 
publicist's presence. Rarely have I done an interview without the 
artist's publicist in tow.<br>
In talking about the current LP, Bruce says, "The guy who took the cover
 shot for that album is a friend of mine from south Jersey who works 
fulltime in a meat market. The shots were taken at his house. He's a 
great photographer."<br>
Bruce's only comment about the self-destructive syndrome 
(dope-money-power) affecting so many rock stars is that "they let all 
the other things become more important than playing. Playing is the 
important thing. Once you forget that, you've had it."<br>
Bruce, obviously, hasn't forgotten that. He's been having fun with music
 since the start. Bruce Springsteen is the perfect assimilator of many 
styles - Chuck Berry/Stones/Elvis/Buddy Holly/ Dylan/Little 
Richard/Animals. His image on stage is also an amalgamation of many 
images - Elvis/young Brando/James Dean. Somehow he melds all of these 
influences into one cohesive framework for his own strikingly original 
material. The man is all that he has devoured musically from the time he
 started listening to music, and it all pours out of him every time he 
steps on stage. "That Elvis, man," Bruce says, "he is all there is. 
There ain't no more. Everything starts and ends with him. He wrote the 
book. He is everything to do and not to do in the business."<br>
If Elvis Presley is Bruce's prototype then Bruce, himself, is the focus 
for a lot of envy and speculation. We all have fantasies - Bruce 
included - of making it big and living as stars. Well, Bruce is living 
the ultimate realization of that fantasy right now. He's made it through
 all the bullshit inherent in such a proposition. He's doing it. And 
doing it in style.<br>
Yet if you talk to him, he's quite humble. Ask him what part he played 
in the writing of "Because the Night" and he'll tell you that he only 
wrote the title line (although he admits he will probably put it on his 
next album.)<br>
Seeing him so close up and listening to him speak makes one realize 
that, although not articulate, there is a certain aura about him. A 
certain intangible. His charisma is the well-worn persona of the working
 man. His handsome/beautiful face could even make the transition to the 
silver screen as a prophet of the proletariat. His facial features are 
tough, yet there's a certain hardness to him. You'd swear he's Italian 
before you're told of his Dutch descent.<br>
His enthusiasm is real. The moment when Gary U.S. Bonds came over the 
car speakers with "Quarter to Three" - that's when Bruce really started 
to groove. The song is in his encores in most of his performances. He 
still loves the original and still sings along with it when it comes on.<br>
The essence of rock and roll can be distilled into a performance that a 
fella by the name of Bobby Lewis did on American Bandstand many years 
ago. Lewis performed "Tossin' and Turnin'" on the show, lip-synched it, 
and drove the small television studio crazy with his slips and slides. 
Host Dick Clark did a never-before-done-thing - he, in his madness of 
the moment, screamed for Lewis to perform the same song again. The sound
 man cued it up and Lewis went back out onto the stage and really tore 
into it this time, twisting, turning, giving it all he had. By now his 
lip motions were completely out-of-synch with the record being played, 
but it didn't matter. It was a piece of rock and roll heaven. And one, 
I'm sure, Bruce Springsteen would have enjoyed.</div>

MARK BINELLI<br>
Bruce Springsteen's American Gospel </strong><br>
<br>
There's a sign on the road leading to Bruce Springsteen's place that 
reads discharge of firearms prohibited. Springsteen lives on a 400-acre 
farm in Monmouth County, New Jersey, about an hour outside Manhattan, 
with his wife, Patti Scialfa, who sings backup in the E Street Band, and
 their three children, Evan, 13, Jessica, 11, and Sam, 8. The farm's 
previous owner, a painter, cherished the lush landscape and kept 
developers at bay. Then, for a time, there was talk of turning the 
property into a golf course, before Springsteen purchased it, eight 
years ago. "We got lucky," he says, standing in a field and surveying 
his land. "I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be." <br>
Springsteen walks with a slight limp — years of jumping around arena 
stages having taken their toll — but he wears it well, or at least his 
persona does, the cowboyish swagger bringing to mind a character out of 
one of the John Ford westerns he loves. Otherwise, at fifty-two, he 
looks remarkably fit. His arms, especially, bring a formidable heft. 
Today, he's sporting clothes that nudge slightly closer to the trendy — 
or at least trendy for someone normally photographed in denim and 
flannel. There are gray pants and a jacket, both by G-Star, scuffed 
black boots and an orange mesh tank top. He wears a silver wedding band 
and thin hoop earrings in both ears — three on the left — and a generous
 amount of stubble, slightly more mustache than beard. His face is 
tanned and ruddy; his hair is thinning, but only his sideburns hint at 
gray. A large cross hangs from a silver chain around his neck, three 
tiny silver hearts dangling from the cross's arms and base. Springsteen 
isn't sure about the tank top, only because he's going to be 
photographed later in the afternoon. "I've never been photographed in 
orange before," he says. "I'm so boring. I don't want to blow the 
sartorial boringness I've cultivated over the years."<br>
It's a beautiful day and Springsteen is in high spirits. Would we like 
to hear a joke? Of course. ("Why do most men name their private parts? 
Because they don't want a stranger making ninety percent of their 
decisions.") His favorite new rapper is Ludacris. He enjoys watching E 
Street Band guitarist Steve Van Zandt mug as wiseguy Silvio Dante on The
 Sopranos, though he misses Big Pussy (who, incidentally, once joined 
Springsteen onstage. Springsteen says he had a pretty good voice).<br>
A loud, unpleasant mewling erupts nearby. "We've got peacocks," 
Springsteen says, nodding at a nearby hutch. "They're great watch 
animals. They'll sit on top of the house, and if anyone comes within 
fifty feet, they'll squawk." Springsteen also keeps horses; he recalls 
one of his first, which his family named He Who Is Afraid of Small 
Things because the horse would throw Springsteen whenever a squirrel or 
rabbit crossed his path.<br>
In recent months, Springsteen's most time-consuming pastoral endeavor 
has involved making his farm organic. As he explains, it's a five-year 
process, during which inspectors regularly test the soil for chemicals. 
For now, Springsteen is growing nothing but a ground cover of reedy 
wildflowers, which will eventually be plowed back into the earth as part
 of the nonorganic purging.<br>
And so goes the life of Bruce Springsteen, five decades on. He keeps an 
eye on the homestead. Takes his kids down to the Jersey shore. Goes for 
rides in his vintage blue Corvette. Gets pissed off reading the paper — 
most recently over the stories of corporate malfeasance and the current 
administration's laissez-faire attitude.<br>
Most important, Springsteen is making rock music again — and it has been
 a while. His last studio album, 1995's The Ghost of Tom Joad, won a 
Grammy for best contemporary folk album. The new album, The Rising, is 
not Springsteen as lone troubadour, but Springsteen reunited, finally 
and completely, with the E Street Band. The group had reformed pre-Tom 
Joad to record three new tracks for a 1995 greatest-hits album, and it 
embarked on a triumphant comeback tour four years later, but The 
Risingis its first full album since 1984's Born in the U.S.A.<br>
Equally significant, The Rising is the first Springsteen album ever to 
be produced by an outsider. Springsteen's camp over the years has been 
one of the most tightly knit in the rock world. Beginning with his first
 album, 1973's Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J., Springsteen has had a 
hand in producing every one of his albums. His only production 
collaborators have been people very close to him, such as his manager, 
Jon Landau, Van Zandt and Chuck Plotkin. They are notorious 
perfectionists. The time it takes them to make an album can be epic, up 
to three years; just as epic are the conversations between Springsteen 
and Landau about the nuances of a single take. But for The Rising, 
Springsteen handed the reins to Atlanta producer Brendan O'Brien, whose 
credits include albums by Pearl Jam and Rage Against the Machine. The 
new record was finished in seven and a half weeks.<br>

<br>
The Rising is largely Springsteen's response to the tragedy of September
 11th. And though it has its stark moments — the most devastating song 
on the album is, in fact, the solo Springsteen track "Paradise" — The 
Rising is as expansive and uplifting as Springsteen's best work with the
 E Street Band, accentuating in particular the band's gospel roots. 
Rather than whisper over an acoustic guitar, Springsteen takes us to the
 river and wonders if somebody can say amen. The title song, and first 
single, sums up the feel of many of the album's fourteen other tracks. 
It ostensibly unfolds from the point of view of a New York firefighter 
entering one of the burning towers. Yet, as on many songs on The Rising,
 Springsteen takes an unexpected turn, lyrically and musically, moving 
from a dark opening verse — "Can't see nothin' in front of me/Can't see 
nothin' coming up behind" — into a hand-clapping, sanctified chorus, as 
the literal image of a man rising up a smoke-filled stairwell merges 
into a religious image of ascension.<br>
Like the album as a whole, the song uses the events of September 11th as
 a metaphorical springboard. Images of rising — rising smoke, rising 
spirits, rising waters, even (yes) rising of a sexual sort — recur in 
several songs, serving as a formidable counterpoint to that other image,
 etched into our collective consciousness, replayed endlessly on every 
network, of falling, of collapse.<br>
Springsteen acknowledges the album's gospel element, and as further 
evidence points to "Into the Fire," which happens to be the first song 
he wrote after September 11th — he began working on it a few days after 
the attack. It covers ground similar to the title track, and also 
features a chorus that doubles as a prayer: "May your strength give us 
strength/May your hope give us hope. . . ."<br>
"When we got that song down," Springsteen says, "it brought the whole 
thing home immediately, because what you get on that song, the first 
verse is the blues." He begins to sing. His voice is soft and husky, 
with the same country twang he has on the recorded version: "The sky was
 falling and streaked with blood/I heard you calling me." He explains, 
"That's country blues. I'm doubling my voice around a twelve-string 
guitar, so when you hear the beginning of that thing, you hear a spirit 
out of the past. Mandolins. Appalachian fiddles." He sings again: "Then 
you disappeared into the dust, up the stairs. . . . "Then," Springsteen 
continues, "when the chorus hits, that's the gospel. The pump organ 
comes in. That's where the thing lifts and makes sense of the first 
verse and, hopefully, tries to make sense of the experience itself. And 
my best songs have done both of those things, blues and gospel. That's 
what my band, and my writing with the band, has always been about. On an
 album like Nebraska, you can hear the blues thing, but the band is more
 like Sunday church. We're gonna shout that thing to you, right into 
your face, and try to get you to stand up. And there were the essential 
elements of what I do with the band, in the first thirty seconds or so 
of recording this album. When the drums hit on 'Into the Fire,' it comes
 down, and the whole thing just grounds itself into the earth and starts
 fightin', you know? The gospel and the blues." Springsteen looses one 
of his hoarse, full-body laughs. "That's where the fight starts. And 
that's all we do, as a band. That's all that we're built for. That's the
 service we provide."<br>
In 1982, in a house about ten minutes from his farm, Springsteen 
recorded his album Nebraska, an acoustic collection of murder ballads 
and conjured ghosts that, to this day, sounds haunted and somehow 
timeless — an album-length equivalent of Elvis' version of "Blue Moon," 
or Hank Williams' "I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive." Springsteen,
 of course, followed up Nebraska with 1984's Born in the U.S.A., which 
changed everything. As anthemic and arena-friendly as its predecessor 
had been spooky and insular, the album sold over 10 million copies, 
spawning seven hit singles and placing Springsteen atop the pantheon of 
Eighties pop stars, representing for the blue-collar rock fan alongside 
the likes of Michael Jackson and Madonna. "I was always unsatisfied with
 that album," Springsteen says today. "That was one I really struggled 
with and never felt like I got the whole thing right. But your own 
wrestling in that department doesn't really have anything to do with the
 way something is received, or the way your fans hear it."<br>
Despite, or perhaps because of, the Born in the U.S.A. juggernaut, 
Springsteen had come to seem less and less mass-culturally relevant. 
With the ascendance of alternative rock and hip-hop, something about 
Springsteen felt decidedly Reagan era. And he himself began to pull away
 from the spotlight. He broke up the E Street Band in 1990. The rock 
albums that followed (Lucky Town and Human Touch, released in 1992) 
didn't garner the notice, critical or commercial, of previous efforts. 
By 1995, Springsteen had grown a mustache and released Tom Joad, a solo 
album in the key of Nebraska that took up the causes of migrant workers 
and other dispossessed characters. It was as if, to atone for 
inadvertently providing the soundtrack to the Reagan revolution, 
Springsteen turned his back on rock radio and pulled a sort of reverse 
Dylan: unplugging his guitar and morphing into a 
folk-singer-slash-activist.<br>
It was around this time, Springsteen admits, that he wasn't sure if he'd lost what he calls his "rock voice."<br>

<br>
We're sitting in the living room of a rambling colonial house, where he 
writes and occasionally records. (Some people have a workroom, but if 
you are Bruce Springsteen, you have a whole house to work in. The family
 living quarters are elsewhere on the farm.) On the coffee table between
 us, there are a stack of books (Dorothea Lange's Ireland, a book of 
rock photos by Danny Clinch), a vase of freshly cut sunflowers and a 
ceramic grinning cowboy. Otherwise, the room is decorated with tasteful 
antique Americana. Springsteen sits in an uncomfortable-looking wooden 
chair — legs spread, heels together, arms in throne position. He laughs 
loudly and often, though when speaking, he rarely makes eye contact, 
instead gazing off into near-distant space as his words form.<br>
Springsteen felt that he began to recover his rock voice during band 
rehearsal in Asbury Park, when he wrote a new song, "Land of Hope and 
Dreams." "It was our last few days there," Springsteen recalls, "and 
having the band around just felt right. I think differently when I'm 
with them, I write differently. We're a social unit that worked, you 
know? Imagine seven, eight, nine people you went to high school with; 
imagine, you know, you're fifty-two and that's the exact same group of 
people you're working with. That's very, very unusual. I never would 
have written a song like 'Land of Hope and Dreams' for the Tom Joad 
record. I never would have used that title. I would've thought it was 
too broad, that it was a cliche. But with the band, it — it is a big 
title, but what we're gonna do with that, I think we can fill that song 
up, with this group of people, in this circumstance."<br>
"Land of Hope and Dreams" and another song, "American Skin (41 Shots)" —
 the latter inspired by the shooting of unarmed African immigrant Amadou
 Diallo by New York police officers — made it into the tour and the live
 album that followed. At this point, Springsteen knew he wanted to make 
an album with the band. But the context of the project changed again 
after September 11th. In the hours and days that followed the attack, 
Springsteen, like many Americans, was glued to his television set. That 
first day, he took a drive over a nearby bridge where, dead-center, 
there had been a perfect view of the twin towers. His kids wanted to 
know if a plane could crash into their school. He took his family to 
church, which he otherwise rarely attends. "We were in there with the 
rest of the wanna-be's, and it was jammed," he says. "But I found that 
to be very valuable. People just wanted to be with other people who were
 addressing issues of faith and hope and love."<br>
Springsteen can't recall listening to much music in the days that 
followed — though, as is often the case in his life, he took refuge in 
his own. "Yeah, I picked up a guitar," he says. "That's my life 
preserver. I mean, when I go into a strange hotel room, to this day, 
I'll take the guitar out of the case first thing and I'll play for five 
or ten minutes. Then the place feels like mine. So, yeah. Right to the 
guitar."<br>
The task at hand became more focused when Springsteen was asked to open a
 telethon held ten days later to raise money for the September 11th 
Fund. He quickly wrote two songs, "Into the Fire" and "You're Missing," 
but neither felt finished enough to perform — so instead, Jon Landau, 
Springsteen's longtime manager and one of his closest friends, suggested
 he perform "My City of Ruins," a song he'd written and performed a year
 earlier at a Christmas concert. Springsteen calls it "a sort of prayer"
 for his adopted hometown of Asbury Park, which went through a long 
period of economic hardship. The opening lines go like this: "There's a 
blood-red circle on the cold, dark ground/And the rain is falling down, 
the church door's thrown open, I can hear the organ's song/But the 
congregation's gone."<br>
"After that performance," Springsteen says, "when I sat down to write a 
song, whatever I wrote was in that emotional context. The music has to 
be physical, and there has to be a good deal of light to it. And I have 
to find that light truthfully. Which is through the darkness, you know?"<br>
It came as a surprise, then, that one of Springsteen's guides through 
the darkness turned out to be an outsider, Brendan O'Brien. A few years 
earlier, he had expressed interest in working with Springsteen. By the 
time of The Rising, Springsteen felt restless and knew he needed a 
change. "The sounds of records change every five years or so," he says, 
"the technology, the amps they use. And my production ability, it just 
wasn't current enough."<br>
O'Brien came to New Jersey, where Springsteen played him a dozen or so 
new songs. They spent the rest of the afternoon crafting a demo of 
"You're Missing," a ballad built around a melody Springsteen worked up 
one night while messing around on the piano with Patti and the kids.<br>
"At one point," Springsteen recalls, "Brendan said, 'Well, I think we 
should find another chord for this spot.' I said, 'Find another chord?! 
Wait a minute, now! Hold on, hold on!' " He laughs. " 'Those are the 
chords!' But then I'm thinking that my job, now, as the producee, is to 
say yes. So I said OK, we changed it, and it sounded good. Once I got 
comfortable with that, it was like, 'Go, man, go.' By the end of the 
day, we had a real nice demo."<br>
"The biggest difference with making this record," Steven Van Zandt 
agrees, "is that it's the first time that Bruce wrote a collection of 
songs, we went in and recorded them, and he put them out."<br>
Normally, Van Zandt says, "he'd write a bunch of songs, we'd record 
them, then, you know, hang out for a bit, he'd write another bunch of 
songs, we'd record them. What would happen is, we'd always do two or 
three or four records before one finally came out. I produced fifteen 
songs or so for Born in the U.S.A. during the first three weeks. Then I 
left and they kept working for two years! Then they ended up using 
twelve of the original fifteen, I think. So I don't ever remember a case
 where everything was done so quickly, and I think that's why this 
record, conceptually, thematically, is so coherent."<br>
"I remember, when we first went down to Georgia to record, the first 
song we did was 'Into the Fire,' " Springsteen says. "We practiced it 
maybe three times, and then Brendan said, 'OK, come on in, let's do it.'
 And when he played us back that song, I heard something I hadn't heard 
before: I heard the way we sound right now. Today. And I said, 'Well, 
that's what we need to do. If somebody has all our other records, I want
 to make sure they don't have this one.' You can't replace this one with
 some of the other ones. And I think for guys that have made records for
 a long time, that's important."<br>

Although Springsteen lived in Los Angeles for several years in the late 
Eighties and early Nineties, he's always seemed most comfortable on his 
native soil. Aside from farming, his ongoing local project has been the 
resurgence of Asbury Park, the coastal town where he lived in the early 
1970s. He played some of his first shows at the now-legendary Stone 
Pony, and he's been involved in the slow economic resurgence of the 
city, playing benefit concerts and remaining an active presence on the 
scene. "He is the Number One cheerleader and supporter of Asbury Park," 
says Domenic Santana, who resurrected the Stone Pony. Springsteen to 
this day plays unannounced shows at the club: Santana says Bruce has the
 combination to the backyard lock and a standing invitation to walk in 
off the street and take the stage whenever he wants. "He's always been 
this city's insurance," Santana says. "That's how I persuaded my parents
 and grandparents to cash in all their 401(k)s, when the banks wouldn't 
touch Asbury Park. I'll never forget, my dad said to me, 'What the hell 
are you smoking?' when I first brought him here to Beirut-by-the-Shore. I
 said, 'You don't understand, there are so many rock &amp; roll memories
 here.' As we were speaking, a bus of Japanese tourists pulled up and 
started taking pictures of the Stone Pony. This abandoned building. My 
father turned to me and said, 'How much did you pay them?' "<br>
Still, on a recent Tuesday afternoon, it's clear that Asbury Park needs 
considerable tending to. A half-mile swath of beach hosts — and this is a
 generous estimate — about thirty sunbathers. The closest, a homeless 
woman, absently fills the back of her shorts with sand. Shuttered motels
 line the main drag, along with a shuttered club called Moving 
Violations, and there's a billboard on the edge of town proclaiming 
god's light of love is still destroying the darkness. Below, a smaller 
italic addendum reads, "Even in Asbury Park!"<br>
And yet, there's a sort of magical feel to the place, thanks, perhaps, 
to the sheer amount of abandoned history. The boardwalk — its wood 
weathered gray — is bookended by grand old art-deco palaces. To the 
south, the long-empty casino sits like a dried-out bee's nest, with its 
shattered window facade and gutted interior. On the opposite end, the 
gorgeous Asbury Park Convention Hall remains dilapidated but functional.
 One of its functions, in recent years, has been as a rehearsal space 
for Springsteen and the E Street Band. This afternoon, the parking area 
houses the E Street fleet: a half-dozen SUVs, a couple of BMWs and 
Springsteen's Corvette.<br>
"I saw my first big concert here," notes Springsteen, who shows up for 
practice in jeans and a black T-shirt. A backpack stuffed with sheet 
music is slung over his shoulder. "It was the Who, Herman's Hermits and 
the Blues Magoos. The Blues Magoos opened, then it was the Who, and 
Herman's Hermits headlined! This was before people here really knew 
about the Who. Nobody knew they were going to smash their instruments. I
 must've been fifteen. I saw Janis Joplin here, and the Doors, too, 
their first time around. I sat right over there." He nods at a bank of 
empty seats, house left, before joining the band onstage. As he chats 
with Van Zandt, Patti Scialfa strolls up the ramp and tickles the back 
of his neck, then grabs her guitar.<br>
And then one of the tightest, most tireless bands of the past 
twenty-five years begins to work through a set. They start with "The 
Rising." Live, the new songs sound huge and untethered. You immediately 
notice the amount of control on the record, and also, as the songs begin
 to accumulate, the number of recurring images. There is, of course, 
smoke, fire, darkness, all of which possess certain mythic qualities. 
But other words recur as well. Touch. Skin. Hugs. Kisses. The best 
gospel songs are often only a word or two away from being great love 
songs — many times quite dirty love songs — all you have to do is 
replace the word God with my baby. Likewise, Springsteen's songs on The 
Rising are suggestive. The opening track, "Lonesome Day," works 
perfectly well, for instance, as a breakup song.<br>
The setting couldn't be more unfrilled: The house lights are up, with 
the rope ladders and ribbed underbelly of the stage clearly visible. The
 house itself remains empty except for a handful of techs, a camera crew
 and someone's Dalmatian, which has been padding around the main floor. 
Still, the band tears into the songs with a thrilled abandon. During the
 audience-participation section of "Waitin' on a Sunny Day," Springsteen
 stops singing and holds his microphone out to the empty house, while 
saxophonist Clarence Clemons coaxes invisible audience members to stand.
 "How ya doin' out there?" Springsteen asks with a smirk, then points 
his mike again. Later, during "Tenth Avenue Freeze Out," a classic song 
about an overweening desire to make it, he grins broadly and does a 
shimmy-dance across the stage.<br>
After two hours, the band retires to a backroom for dinner. Drummer Max 
Weinberg, on hiatus from his day job as Conan O'Brien's bandleader, is 
sitting at the end of a long table with a red-and-white checkered cloth,
 talking up a tension-relieving pillow he's just ordered from the 
Sharper Image catalog. Springsteen ambles over with a bowl of salad and 
grilled fish, shaking his head as he overhears this last bit. "These are
 the topics of conversation backstage now," he sighs. "Swedish pillows."<br>
"They're great pillows," Weinberg insists. "I'll turn you on to them."<br>
Scialfa, a willowy redhead who, today, is wearing a black tank top and 
pants and working on a bowl of mussels, mentions that she, too, saw the 
Doors in this very building, at the same show as her husband, though 
they didn't know each other then. "I just wanted to be Jim Morrison," 
she says.<br>
"I saw Jefferson Airplane here," Weinberg says. "Procul Harum."<br>
"I saw that show!" Springsteen exclaims happily.<br>
"I was there, too," Scialfa says.<br>
"I remember going to a Hullabaloo Club concert here," Springsteen says.<br>
"It was the first black light I'd ever seen. I walked in and couldn't 
figure out what happened to my shirt!" A few minutes later, he 
continues, without much of a segueway, "You know, my kids used to burst 
into tears whenever they saw Steve Van Zandt."<br>
Scialfa snorts out a laugh. "You couldn't wait to introduce that!" she 
says. "They were babies." She shrugs. "And he looked like a pirate."<br>
Springsteen and Scialfa have never been on the road without their kids. 
"This tour," she says, "they begged, wept, 'Please don't make us go!' It
 is isolating. Plus, who wants to watch their parents?"<br>
Soon, it is time to return to the stage. The most powerful moment comes a
 few songs in, when Springsteen sits at the piano to perform "My City of
 Ruins," while the band looks silently on. He sings, "Now there's tears 
on the pillow, darlin', where we slept, and you took my heart when you 
left. Without your sweet kiss, my soul is lost, my friend. Tell me, how 
do I begin again?"<br>
Springsteen still remembers the moment he realized that he needed to 
make this album. It was a few days after September 11th, and he was 
leaving the beach. A man drove by, rolled his window down and yelled, 
"We need ya!" Then he rolled his window up and kept going. "And I 
thought, well, I've probably been a part of this guy's life for a while,
 and people wanna see other people they know, they wanna be around 
things they're familiar with. So he may need to see me right about now. 
That made me sense, like, 'Oh, I have a job to do.' Our band, hopefully,
 we were built to be there when the chips are down. That was part of the
 idea of the band, to provide support. The most fundamental thing I hear
 from fans, constantly, is, 'Man, you got me through' — whatever it 
might be. 'My divorce. My graduation. My high school. This part of my 
life, that part.' " Bruce Springsteen chuckles once more. "And I usually
 wanna say back, 'Well, you know, you guys got me through quite a bit 
yourselves!' " Then he laughs again, this time much louder.</div>

“Springsteen – The Interview”<br>
By Ken Tucker</strong><br>
<br>
The Grammys, his 30-year career, Iraq &amp; America, the music biz mess….and Eminem and ‘American Idol.’<br>
<br>
Driving to talk with Bruce Springsteen, one passes small businesses that
 might pop up in one his songs: Two Men and a Truck, Movers Who Care, 
and the Cree Mee Freeze ice-cream stand. This is rural Monmouth County, 
N.J, where the Boss lives surrounded by vast cornfields cleared for the 
winter; and a short distance from his seminal Asbury Park. On a cold day
 in early February, the living room of his converted farmhouse is warmed
 by a glowing fireplace; three guitar cases and a keyboard sit in the 
hallway. Springsteen, dressed in Johnny Cash black (quilted jacket, 
shirt, pants, boots), has just come from his home recording studio, 
where his wife, Patti Scialfa, is completing her second solo album – a 
decade after her first. “Yeah, a bit of a gap in between, but” – 
Springsteen pauses – “that’s the way we do things in this family!” he 
says, laughing. <br>
Springsteen went seven years between his last two studio albums – 1995’s
 spare The Ghost of Tom Joad and last year’s 9/11-themed The Rising – 
and 18 years between collaborations with a fully constituted E Street 
Band. He seems at peace with that pace. After 30 years of hard work and 
harder playing, he’s got a realistically skeptical view: while grateful 
for The Rising’s Grammy nominations, he scorns a music industry that 
seems focused solely on quick, hit-single careers; his kinship with the 
bedrock beliefs of his fans has grown, but he thinks the Bush 
administration is headed in the dead-wrong direction; and out of this 
troublesome world he’s done his best to carve a haven for his family – 
wife and E Street Band member Scialfa, and their three children, Evan, 
12, Jessica, 11, and Sam, 9. With all the accolades, and sales of just 
under 2 million, The Rising has revived his careers while maturing the 
man. As became clear during our interview, Springsteen has worked 
strenuously to find a strategy for survival, and almost welcomes the 
notion that even if he has peaked as a mass-culture phenomenon, he can 
still passionately connect to an audience with shared values and 
concerns.<br>
Readying himself for his first in-depth interview since last August’s 
media blitz in support of The Rising, he plops into a rocking chair and 
vigorously musses his already-mussed hair. He’s eager to hear what 
Secretary of State Colin Powell has said earlier that morning to the U.N
 about possible war with Iraq. Foreign travel, among much more pressing 
things, is on his mind. (A new album, in case you’re wondering, is not.)
 After the Feb.28 airing of a CBS concert special taped recently in 
Barcelona, Springsteen will resume his “barnstorming tour” – the first 
leg of which took him and the E Street Band across America through the 
fall and early winter – with U.S dates in early March. Then, at least 
through June, he and the band head overseas, to everywhere from 
Australia and New Zealand to Germany. Rocker, reader, and peace-seeking 
road warrior, Springsteen refuses to be pinned down. He holds within him
 all the surprises and contradictions of an artist not just born in the 
USA, but now set loose in the world.<br>
<br>
Entertainment Weekly: By the time most readers see this, The Rising may 
have won a Grammy for Album of the Year and Song of the Year. Are you 
excited to have been nominated?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: I don’t put a whole lot on it, ‘cause I’ve been around a 
long time, and I made some pretty good records [that didn’t get] an 
Album nomination: Darkness [on the Edge of Town], Born to Run, The 
River, Nebraska…But this is nice. It probably means a little more to me 
now than it would have back then, y’know?<br>
<br>
EW: Why<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Because maybe I would have said, “Wait a minute, maybe I’m 
doing something wrong.” That kind of acceptance might not have fit my 
idea back then about whether a rock &amp; roll rebel, or whatever I 
thought I was, should be winning awards. [He laughs.] But [The Rising] 
is an important record to me. It’s the first record in such a long time 
with the band, and I wanted to make it really good, a record that could 
stand shoulder to shoulder with all our others. The whole idea with the 
band was to get back together but move very consciously forward…[If you]
 saw the band on this tour, your older brother or dad couldn’t say, “Oh 
man, I saw them back when they were really good.” The band’s playing as 
good – as committed and intense – as at any time in its history, and 
making a record that carried on those values and ideals was very 
important. So the [Grammy] recognition is nice, it’s enjoyable.<br>
<br>
EW: Are you familiar with your Grammy competition?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Yeah, I’ve heard probably just about everybody. Norah Jones
 is terrific. Eminem, he’s good: intense – intense – and committed. He’s
 got a lot to say and says it. Vehemently.<br>
<br>
EW: You did a ton of publicity for The Rising, appearing on TV everywhere from the Today Show to David Letterman.<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Current reality is that you can’t count on radio [to play 
your music] when you’re my age; that’s just the way it rolls. This was a
 record I felt very strongly about and I wanted it to be heard; I wanted
 people to know that it was out there…So we immediately said, there are 
some things I would be comfortable doing. [But] Letterman threw me a 
little. They said, “Ya wanna come over and sit on the couch?” I said, 
“Ahhh, ya sit on the couch ya gotta be funny. That’s too much pressure.”
 But he’s funny, so you don’t have to be too funny yourself.<br>
<br>
EW: You really thought a Springsteen album with songs about the aftermath of September 11 wouldn’t sell or attract attention?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Hey, it’s a big tent out there [in pop culture]. I take my 
kids and we buy popcorn and see the big movies. The problem is that [the
 marketplace] pushes to the margins things that may not be immediately 
accessible…It’s like, you’re either in the mall or the little tiny 
theater downtown…The hegemony of a certain type of movie or a certain 
type of music at any given time isn’t a good thing.<br>
That’s the way the game is played, I understand that. But you have to 
fight for your place – the audience is not brought to you or given to 
you, it’s something that you fight for. You can’t forget that, 
especially if you’ve had some success: Getting an audience is hard. 
Sustaining an audience is hard. It demands a consistency of thought, of 
purpose, and of action over a long period of time… You have to be 
willing to roll the dice, you have to be willing to risk, to step up and
 enter your particular arena and stake your claim to a piece of it. 
That’s part of what The Rising meant to me.<br>
<br>
EW: You recently toured Europe and are going back there again soon. How do you think America is perceived now?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: For the best part of a decade, we’ve had a bigger audience 
overseas than in the States. Two thirds of my audience has been there; 
they were very connected to the Tom Joad record, very connected to music
 that was explicitly American, [so] there must be a tremendous 
commonality felt about the values of those songs. People continue to be 
very taken with America, with its bigness and its history and its drama,
 its myths and its values.<br>
There’s a lot of dissent about America [now], about this 
administration’s policies. But I think those things are specific, I 
don’t think they’re something as general as a blanket anti-Americanism. 
Bob Herbert said in a column in The [New York] Times a few weeks ago 
that [Europeans] respond to a country that uses its power wisely abroad 
and dispenses its benefits fairly at home. Those are the things that are
 very debatable right now – the direction we’re going in.<br>
<br>
EW: Do you think we’ll go to war with Iraq?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: I think we [already] are; I think the administration is 
just set on it. A month ago I wasn’t so sure, but now I am. Those drums 
are being beaten really hard. I think the administration took September 
11 and used it as a blank check. And like most Americans, I’m not sure 
the case has been made to put our sons and our daughters and innocent 
citizens at risk at this particular moment. But I don’t think that’s 
gonna matter, unfortunately…The actual war against terrorism is 
extremely complicated. You try not to be cynical, but without the 
distraction of Iraq, [people would notice] that the economy is doing 
poorly, and the old-fashioned Republican tax cuts for the folks that are
 doin’ well will seriously curtail services for people who are 
struggling out there. I don’t think that’s the kind of country that 
Americans really want. All the cutbacks in the environmental 
restrictions – it’s just a game of shadows and mirrors at the moment.<br>
<br>
EW: Shifting gears a little: Bobbie Ann Mason, a writer I know you 
admire, just published a biography of someone else you admire, Elvis 
Presley. In the book, she theorizes that Presley, brought up poor and 
ill-educated, had a lifelong urge to please people, whether it was his 
father or Colonel Parker, and he ultimately just gave up. He said, 
“Okay, I’ll go do this next crap movie and Vegas show.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen: The key to survival in the line of work he…invented is the 
replenishment of ideas. You can’t really remain physically or mentally 
healthy without a leap of consciousness and a continuing, deeper 
investigation into who you are and what you’re doing. Those are the 
things that will make sense of the many silly and weird things [he 
laughs] that will happen to you [when you’re a star]! [But] what keeps 
you from maintaining that replenishment of ideas is an insecurity about 
who you let in close to you. To have new ideas you usually need to have 
new people around, people willing to challenge your ideas in some 
fashion, or to simply assist you in broadening them. Which means you 
have to be open to the fact that your thinking isn’t everything, y’know?<br>
The performers who suffer through their success have a difficult time 
making those connections, because they come from a different 
environment. The culture of ideas is usually over here [gestures to his 
left] and you’ve grown up over here [gestures to his right]. In between 
is this tremendous void that, when Elvis started, was rarely bridged. 
Bridging that void is your ace in the hole, but to do it you’ve gotta be
 aware of the limitations of where you come from and be willing to say, 
“Well, I’ve gotta go out and seek new things.”<br>
<br>
EW: You seem to identify with Elvis in this way.<br>
<br>
Springsteen: For me, I was somebody who was a smart young guy who didn’t
 do very well in school. The basic system of education, I didn’t fit in;
 my intelligence was elsewhere. I found I could apply my intelligence 
when I started to play [music], but once you get to that point…There was
 a moment during the [recording of] The Wild &amp; The Innocent when the
 band was having a kind of breakdown – we couldn’t make the record, the 
sessions weren’t going well. I happened to bump into Jon Landau [then a 
critic for Boston’s Real Paper, and Springsteen’s manager since 1977] 
outside a club I was playing in Boston. I was reading his review, which 
was pasted up outside the club in a feeble attempt to lure some paying 
customers inside [laughs], and he said, “Whattya think?” I said, “It’s 
pretty good,” not realizing he had written it, and we just struck up a 
conversation about our love of music. I thought, This is an interesting 
guy and I don’t know any guys like this. That was my take on him: “I 
don’t know any guys like this.”<br>
So he came in, he had ideas about how the band should sound, about how 
the band should be arranged. We listened to records together and we said
 we like this drum sound, that guitar sound. And it became clear to me 
that what he was doing was assisting me in doing what I wanted to do. So
 the security for a young guy like me was suddenly there. I was like, 
“Hey, I’m steerin’ the boat, I got some help here.” And I felt 
comfortable. My own tolerance for outside help was limited for all the 
same reasons [as Presley’s] – I went to just a year of college and 
you’re self-conscious about those things, believe me. But my artistic 
survival at that moment depended on some fresh ideas.<br>
<br>
EW: So how did you spark some of those fresh ideas?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: I began to look at movies differently and I began to read 
more intensely. It led me on my own journey through the world of ideas, 
which I feel has sustained the vitality of what we’ve done for 30 years:
 It is at the essential core of everything that happened next. I was 
lucky to come along when I’d seen the mistakes that my predecessors had 
made and I instinctively understood some of those mistakes before I was 
able to articulate them. [As a popular entertainer] you can culturally 
feel very, very isolated. Not matter how revolutionary an artist Elvis 
Presley was, the flip side of that is that you are singular, you are 
alone, and so you seek the comforts of home and of personalities that 
you utterly dominate. You effectively isolate yourself from the world 
that keeps you alive.<br>
As you get older, the price you pay for not sorting through your 
[emotional] baggage increases. At 22, you can get away with a lotta 
slippin’ and slidin’, and you can get away with a good deal of that at 
32, but by your early 40s, you’re skiddin’ all over the place. The 
pressure on you increases and I think that leads you to release this 
pressure, whether it’s with drugs, or whatever it may be for you. 
Because you can’t figure it out, you anesthetize yourself against it to 
go on livin’. And some people get dug in so deep that if the person [who
 could help him] was standing right in front of him it wouldn’t matter. 
I’ve seen that plenty of times. It’s a real tragedy because [an artist] 
who gave so much couldn’t get it in return: the things that really 
matter, the things that would have brought him fulfillment and meaning 
and understanding of the beautiful and vital role that he played in so 
many people’s lives…You need to make that leap of consciousness. It’s a 
self-protective mechanism that protects your gifts. Otherwise, you’ll 
get totally spent and trashed. It’s a job you can only do by yourself, 
assisted by – if you are very lucky – a trustworthy companion and some 
close friends. I’ve been very lucky that way. I drift, but not too far –
 so far. [He laughs.] There’s always tomorrow!<br>
<br>
EW: This was how you felt even at the height of your popularity?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Yeah, sure. We were doing good, makin’ a lotta dough, but 
when you’re in the spotlight, it makes you hyperaware of what you’re 
doing, and that can make you more self-conscious than you need to be. I 
wrestled through all those things, and I found my own way of alleviating
 those pressures, partly by making an [experimental] record like 
Nebraska – that helped me feel very balanced…<br>
At the heights of success you’re a little extra cautious because the 
level of exposure becomes wearisome. I truly don’t know how some big 
stars do it. I could make a commitment to it for a certain amount of 
time, but after that I just had to get my feet back into what felt like 
real life. I always come back to the same thing: It’s about work – the 
work, working, working. Write that next song and put that next record 
out; speak to my audience and continue to have that conversation that’s 
been going on for so long. After a while you build up a large body of 
work that serves as a foundation. It’s not like when you get your first 
record out and you wonder, Am I gonna get another chance to put a record
 out? Are people gonna care six months from now?<br>
I have a lotta sympathy for some young musicians who are trying to crack
 it. We’re gone back to the pre-FM [hit-driven days of] Top 40. It’s a 
very different environment for young, thoughtful musicians. If I was 
just coming up, I wouldn’t want to be stuck playing by the particular 
rules of the music business right now.<br>
<br>
EW: So you’re unimpressed by the opportunities to be found for young talent on American Idol?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Ah, the great, terrible Darwinian spectacle! I haven’t seen
 it, but it’s the theater of cruelty that has everybody fascinated at 
the moment.<br>
<br>
EW: Speaking of embarrassment, do you ever hear one of your old songs and wonder, Where the hell did that come from?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Yeah, and it’s a feeling of, I wouldn’t write that now but 
I’m glad I wrote it then! [Laughs] Those first two records [1973’s 
Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J and The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E 
Street Shuffle] were very freeing because I didn’t have an audience and I
 wasn’t reacting to something I’d done previously. I just had this 
explosion of youthful creativity and exuberance. Those records were 
filled with exuberance and enormous energy…I had heroes I was emulating,
 but I also had my own little world that I was trying to give life to. 
Those records always bring me back to the street life of my early 20s 
and the boardwalk.<br>
<br>
EW: Then came Born to Run.<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Yeah, with that one I was shootin’ for the moon. I said, “I
 don’t wanna make a good record, I wanna make The Greatest Record 
Somebody’s Ever Heard.” I was filled with arrogance and thought, I can 
do that, y’know? It was fun, it was a great time, but if I had to 
measure it all up I don’t think I’ve ever been as satisfied as I am 
right now. The combination of this particular record coming at this 
particular time, and the band being present and everybody alive and 
accounted for – only a few bands can say that. We go to Europe and the 
front of the stage is filled with 15-, 16-, 17-year-olds – they see [the
 E Street Band], who stood there 30 years ago. And not only are my guys 
still there, they still mean it.<br>
<br>
EW: Born in the U.S.A was by far your most commercially successful 
record. I have a friend who, remembering the album’s cover, wanted to 
know what it was like to have had, for a time, the most famous ass in 
America.<br>
<br>
Springsteen: [Laughs heartily and turns red] That’s funny because Annie 
Leibovitz would tell you she shot hundreds of pictures. [But] I kept 
looking at that one picture and said, “Well, I dunno, there’s something 
about this.” It had a certain laconic iconography that I liked. And I 
remember Annie yelling, “Oh no! It’s out of focus!” It was just a kind 
of instinctive thing, what can I say?<br>
<br>
EW: Got a current cultural hero, someone whose work continues to evolve in a way you’d like yours to?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: I tell ya, those three [recent] books by Philip Roth – 
American Pastoral, I Married a Communist, The Human Stain – just knocked
 me on my ass. To be [in his 60s] making work that strong and so full of
 revelations about love and emotional pain – man, that’s the way to live
 your artistic life: Sustain, sustain, sustain.<br>
<br>
EW: You once said that part of entertainment is to provide food for 
thought. For you, that seems to be very much about resisting 
complacency; the battle not to become cynical.<br>
<br>
Springsteen: A certain amount of skepticism is necessary to survive in 
today’s environment. You don’t want to be taking everything at face 
value. But for that [questioning] to be worth something it has to be 
connected to an element of energy and creative thought – that’s the 
thing that’s gonna have some impact…So that’s my approach: Try to be 
wise about the way the world works. But at the same time, you need to 
find some way to turn those insights about what’s real and what’s true 
into some creative process, creative action. That’s what we try to pass 
on to our audience so [they] don’t feel powerless…Tommy Morello, the 
guitarist from Rage Against the Machine, said in an interview that 
history is made in people’s kitchens, in living rooms, at night; it’s 
made by people talking and thinking things through. That, I think, is 
true: You should throw your two cents in as best as you can.<br>
<br>
EW: So much information comes from the top down. What do you say to 
people who feel like they don’t have much say in what goes in the world?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: I’m always fighting against that feeling of helplessness. I
 can be overwhelmed by ambivalence, by the despair of the day. [But] 
that’s what people use music and film and art for; that’s its purpose. 
Its purpose is to pull you up out of that despair, to shine a light on 
new possibilities. And I think if you look at it pretty hard-eyed, it 
helps. That’s where the living is, that’s where life is. Regardless of 
what’s going on externally, those are the powers that you find within 
yourself to keep going and change things. To try to make some place for 
yourself in the world.</div>

By Dave DiMartino<br>
Interview conducted in Detroit, Michigan, on October 10 1980</strong><br>
<br>
(NOTE -THIS IS THE COMPLETE INTERVIEW THAT APPEARS IN EDITED FORM ON PAGE 1 OF THIS THREAD)<br>
<br>
<br>
The night is Oct.9, 1980 and though this is the fifth stop on the River 
tour, the LP still won’t see be in the stores for another four days. 
Bruce and the E Street Band have just finished a show in the cozy 
confines of Cobo Hall in Detroit, a site of one of the last shows of the
 Darkness tour in 1978. In many ways, these first shows of the River 
weren’t much different in scope from those late ’78 shows and the step 
to near superstardom that the River tour and the LP would bring is not 
yet in evidence. Bruce still takes time to meet local record store 
employees backstage, signs autographs before and after the show, and 
allows then Creem associate editor Dave DiMartino and photographer 
Michael N. Marks an exclusive interview and photo session, perhaps the 
last such liberal access Bruce and his management would afford any 
magazine. At the appropriate hour of quarter to three in the morning, 
manager Jon Landau asks DiMartino, “No more than a half-hour, OK?” But 
the problem is not DiMartino, but Bruce, who is in the mood to talk. The
 interview runs easily to an hour, despite the fact that the band has a 
show in Chicago in less than 18 hours. With the River still not in 
stores, Bruce focuses not so much on the new songs themselves, but on 
the process of making the record, his own perception of how he works in 
creating an LP and his own expectations of himself. Creem ran the piece 
in their January 1981 issue, but used less than half of the interview 
(…) Bruce is humorous and at times complex in responding to provocative 
questions from DiMartino, who he is meeting for the first time.<br>
<br>
Dave DiMartino: They [the crew] all call you the boss?<br>
<br>
Springsteen: Well, the thing I have with this "Boss" is funny because it
 came from people like that, who work around you. And then, somebody 
started to do it on the radio. I hate being called "Boss." (laughs) I 
just do. Always did from the beginning. I hate bosses. I hate being 
called the boss. It just started from all the people around me, then by 
somebody on the radio and once that happens, everybody said "Hey Boss," 
and I'd say, "No. Bruce. BRUCE." I always hated that. I always hated 
being called "Boss."<br>
<br>
I have lots of relatives is Jersey, Seaside Heights and Point Pleasant. It's a pretty interesting place for somebody to grow up.<br>
<br>
Yeah, it's pretty strange. It's real "away," you know? It's like an hour
 from New York, but it might as well be ten million miles, because when I
 was growing up, I think I wasn't in New York once until I was sixteen, 
except maybe once when my parents took me to see the circus. And New 
York was just so far away. It's funny, because when we first came out, 
everyone tagged us as being a New York band, which we never really were.
 We were down there from Jersey, which was very, very different. It's 
like my sister. She went to New York last year, and said "Hey, I went to
 New York and we couldn't find Fifth Avenue, so we went home." (laughs) 
It was like you just didn't go to New York. It was a million miles away.
 I remember, you didn't talk about it, you didn't think about it. It was
 all very, very local. That's the way those little towns and stuff are, 
you just never get out.<br>
<br>
I remember we'd go to Seaside Heights when we were 14 and 15 years old. It was a good place to pick up girls.<br>
<br>
Yeah. Asbury was where you'd go if you didn't have the gas to get to Seaside Heights. That was a whole other thing.<br>
<br>
Bob Seger told us he saw you in LA and you were going through the same 
problems finishing The River that he had with Against the Wind, that you
 were pulling your hair out. What made you decide you had the right 
songs? Last we heard you pulled a tune off it.<br>
<br>
Well, from the beginning I had an idea of what I felt the record should 
be. And I don't think, I'm not interested in going in the studio and 
(pauses) I don't want to just take up space on the shelf or worry that 
if you don't have something out every six months, or even a year, that 
people are going to forget about you. I was never interested in 
approaching it that way. We never have from the beginning. I have a 
feeling about the best I can do at a particular time, and that's what I 
wanted to do. I don't come out until I feel that, and that's what I've 
done. Because there's so many records coming out, there's so much stuff 
on the shelves, why put out something that you don't feel is what it 
should be, or that you feel - and I don't believe in tomorrows - that 
"Oh, I'll put the other half out six months from now." You don't know 
what's gonna be happening six months from now. You may be dead, you just
 don't know. It's like from the very beginning, I just never believed in
 doing things that way. You make your record like it's the last record 
you'll ever make. You go out and play at night. I don't think if I don't
 play good tonight, I'll play good tomorrow. I don't think that if I 
didn't play good tonight, that, well, I played good last night. It's 
like there's no tomorrows and there's no yesterdays. There's only right 
now.<br>
<br>
You gotta prove it all night, right?<br>
<br>
BS: Well that's the thing with the kids. Like if a kid buys a ticket, he
 comes in, tonight is his night. Tonight is the night for you and him, 
you and him are not gonna have this night again. And if you don't take 
it as seriously as he's taking it, I mean, this is his dough, he worked 
for it all week, money's tough now and there's a certain thing... I just
 think you gotta lay it all on the line when you go out there and then I
 feel good afterwards. That's the only way I feel right and it's the 
same thing with the record.<br>
<br>
How do you feel about The River now that it's finished? Are you 100 percent satisfied with it?<br>
<br>
Oh, you're never like that, you're never 100 percent satisfied, because 
you're thinking about all the wrong stuff you did. You always think you 
could've played that one other song, like tonight. When we started this 
tour, we said, "OK. We're not gonna play 'Quarter to Three.' We played 
that the whole last tour, and we're not gonna play it this tour. And 
sure enough, we get backstage (tonight) and this is the first time we 
had to come out again one more time, and it's like "What are we gonna 
play? 'Quarter to Three!’." So that was probably the swan song of that.<br>
<br>
You have to admit that as high as expectations were when you produced 
Darkness, the expectations for this new album were considerably higher. 
Do you think you were a little sensitive or paranoid about the final 
version of this LP?<br>
<br>
No, because nobody's expectations are higher than your own. You do what 
you can do and that's the way it stands. People have their expectations 
and I try to live up to a certain thing I feel myself. And I know I have
 strict ideals about the way we do things, the way the band does things,
 so outside forces, they play a secondary role. Like, I know when I've 
done all I can do after a show and I know when I've done all I can do 
when I make a record. And you know when it could be better – like there 
was something wrong with the stage or you couldn't quite say what you 
wanted to say. But, you know, people's expectations are gonna be what 
they're gonna be; in the end you're gonna disappoint everybody anyway. 
(laughs)<br>
<br>
OK, but if I were you, I know I'd have been scared. With No Nukes, the 
talk about you as the highlight, the viable screen commodity, all 
building up to the long-awaited LP. All I know I'd be happy as hell to 
be out on the road and not have to deal with all that.<br>
<br>
Yeah, well that's the reality, like you're hit with the reality every 
night. All the other stuff, it's like, what's to be frightened of? That 
somebody's not gonna like it? That's just not that much, you know?<br>
<br>
On opening night in Ann Arbor you had to stop on occasion because the band hadn't learned the new songs completely.<br>
<br>
Well, Ann Arbor, that was a wild show, because I came out and we started
 playing and we went into "Born to Run," which I'd just listened to in 
the dressing room like ten times.<br>
<br>
To try and remember the words?<br>
<br>
Yeah, and I went up to the mike and I couldn't remember the words, and I
 was up there and said, "Oh shit. I don't know these words." And I 
thought, "Not only do I not know these, I don't know any of the others."
 This was all taking place within about five seconds. "What the hell am I
 gonna do?" I mean, you can't stop. And then out in the audience I hear 
"In the day we sweat it... " and it was GREAT. And then it was fine. 
That was an amazing audience.<br>
<br>
But how do you feel about that? You seem to be one of the only 
performers that the audience truly loved. Not to flatter you, but it 
seems like you probably haven't been up against an audience that wasn't 
totally familiar with you and hadn't memorized the lyrics of all your 
songs. Do you ever wish you were facing an audience as a complete 
unknown?<br>
<br>
I opened for Black Oak Arkansas. I opened for Brownsville Station and I 
opened for Sha Na Na. I’m 31 and I've been playing in bars since I was 
15, and I've faced a lot of audiences that don't give a shit that you're
 onstage. And if you're calling percentages, we've had only two to five 
percent nights like tonight against 95 percent in the 10 to 15 years 
we've been playing when, let me tell you, that did not happen. That does
 not happen, and it keeps you from ever getting spoiled, because you 
know what it's like when nobody gives a damn when you come out there. It
 keeps you in certain places, it stays with you. There are no free 
rides. When we first started playing, I'd go to every show expecting 
nobody to come, and I'd go onstage expecting nobody to give me anything 
for free. And that's the way you have to play. If you don't play like 
that, pack your guitar up, throw it in the trash can, go home, fix 
televisions, do some other line of work, you know? Do something where 
that's the way you feel about it. And the night I stop thinking that 
way, that's the night I won't do it no more, because that's just the 
bottom line. I don't gauge the show by the audience reaction; I don't 
gauge the show by the review in the paper the next day. I know what I 
did when I'm done, I know how I feel, and I know if I'm comfortable when
 I get on the bus to go to the next town. I know if I feel good and I 
know if I feel bad. I know if I can go to sleep easy that night. That's 
the way that we judge it and that's the way that we run it. And if we 
didn't, that noise that you were hearing, that would not be happening in
 the first place.<br>
Do you ever worry about that? Do you think that might not happen in the future, that you might not give your all?<br>
<br>
No. I'm not that kind of person. I don't have any fear about that 
because, I guess, I have other things that are much more frightening 
that keep me from falling into that.<br>
<br>
What's it like these days getting recognized?<br>
<br>
People don't recognize me that much. They don't. If you go around 
humming "Badlands" or something (laughs), they might. People just don't 
look for you. They recognize you outside the show, but it just doesn't 
happen otherwise. I mean, back home, if I go around a bar or something 
on a Saturday afternoon, forget it.<br>
<br>
Do you still do that?<br>
<br>
Yeah I do that. I mean that's what you do when you go home, there's 
nothing else to do when you go home. But if you do that in the bars back
 home, most of the time people do recognize you so they don't bother 
you. It depends. It just doesn't happen to the point where it really 
bothers you or something. It just doesn't happen.<br>
<br>
Do you get approached frequently to produce other artists or appear on their records? I know you just worked with Gary US Bonds.<br>
<br>
Some bands, yeah. Some people ask me, but I can't go in there and do 
things the way I do my own records, I just wouldn't feel right doing it.
 I wouldn't feel right, behind them, you know. And plus, I am not a 
producer. I've always felt that essentially I'm a playing musician, 
that's what I've done the longest. I'm a playing musician. I go out on 
the road and play, we do live rock 'n' roll shows and everybody has a 
good time. And then on the side, after that, I write the songs and make 
albums, but I feel most like myself when I'm playing, when we're doing 
shows.<br>
<br>
Dave Marsh's book was obviously a great success. What are your feelings about it?<br>
<br>
Yeah, that was terrific, that was really exciting. You know, we didn't 
put an album out for that whole year and then came the book, and kids 
would come up with it and say "Hey, sign the book." It was really just a
 nice thing for everybody.<br>
<br>
The guys in the band, you've all been friends for years and all that. 
When Marsh's book came out there was a big deal about you, the picture 
on the cover of you smiling, did the guys come up to you and say "Oh, 
come on Bruce. We all know you're just a little shit."<br>
<br>
No. (laughs) It's like you don't think that much about it. Most of the 
people I'm with have been my friends for a long time, in my band, and 
they're all in the book. I mean, since I was 16 I've known Steve. You 
just sit there and look at the book and there's all those things 
happening, but you just accept those things happening.<br>
<br>
With your success you've created a familiar "Springsteen sound." When 
you hear new artists that seem to imitate your sound, do you think about
 what you've created?<br>
<br>
No, I never have those particular feelings. Myself I've been influenced 
by so much music. Even on the new album there's some Johnny and the 
Hurricanes kind of stuff I don't think about it.<br>
How, did your involvement with Gary US Bonds come about?<br>
<br>
We met in a bar right by my house and we just started talking. He's just
 a great guy with a great voice. He's just got this voice, and there's 
only one of this voice. The stuff on his records didn't have that sound.
 That sound was him, that was his voice, and when he sings, that's what 
he sounds like. There was a situation because of the nature of the music
 business where there was so many people. What happened was that the 
music business changed from where there were writers and singers and 
producers. Now a kid comes up and he's got to do everything. Well, 
that's no good, because people don't do everything good. That's why 
there are so many bad albums, because people don't do everything good. 
Maybe someone's a hell of a producer, maybe some kid is a hell of a 
songwriter or a great singer, or maybe some kid ain't a good singer and 
songwriter. They're sort of forced by the way the thing is based now to 
attempt to do all these things. They think they should. In the '60s, 
what happened was you had all these tremendous people out there, these 
great singers particularly, who were popular back then, who were just 
stopped, run over, you know. In a flash, 20 years old. Now, they just 
don't fit in, they don't fit the structure of the music business. Who is
 their audience? Gary was like that. Gary's a great singer, but it's 
hard now. It's hard to get people to pay attention.<br>
<br>
Do you wonder what your record might sound like if you didn't produce yourself?<br>
<br>
Our method now is a very personal way of recording, where somebody 
coming in from the outside would have a difficult time. We wrote and 
recorded about 48 songs [for The River] and at one time I thought they 
were all gonna be on (laughs). And somebody sitting there seeing four 
albums being recorded, well, you gotta be in it for life, you know? To 
just have the patience and the perseverance. And we recorded that stuff 
real fast, there was not a lot of overdubbing, not a lot of takes even. 
We just recorded so much stuff.<br>
<br>
What was the major criteria for the completion of the album, the selection of songs?<br>
<br>
I'd say the main thing was trying to focus on exactly what I wanted on 
the album, and what I wanted to do with the characters. Like on 
Darkness, that stopped at a certain point. Well, what happens now? I 
don't feel different every six months, it takes a while. What I wanted 
to do, and what I hoped was working out was those little four-song 
albums they tried to put out for a while, I don't know if they're gonna 
keep doing it or not, those "Nu Disks" [10" EPs like Black Market Clash,
 circa 1979] or whatever you call 'em. I wanted to, from time to time, 
release those with all the stuff that's in the can and all the stuff 
that for one reason or another didn't make it on. I wanted to put those 
out in between albums so that it was a different kind of thing. I don't 
think they're gonna make those anymore.<br>
<br>
How did you end up on [Lou Reed's] Street Hassle?<br>
<br>
He called me up in the studio, it was funny. We were at the Record 
Plant; I hadn't really met him and I liked his stuff I always really 
liked it. He called me up and said I've got this part," and it was 
related to Born to Run," I guess, in some way, and said "Come on 
upstairs," and he had these words, and I went upstairs...<br>
<br>
And you read them.<br>
<br>
Yeah, and so I did it once, no, I think I did it twice, and he just picked one and I was real happy.<br>
<br>
Did you enjoy the No Nukes shows?<br>
That was great. That was one of the favorite shows that we ever did. I 
liked working with all those different people. What happened was when we
 first started, the way we got to playing by ourselves was inadvertent. 
We never meant to do shows by ourselves. But we couldn't get on any 
other tours. People will tell you today, if you're a new band, you can't
 get on other tours, people won't take you out. And if you're good, then
 forget about it. You're never gonna make it out. So, at the time, we 
were doing pick-up shows for absolutely anybody that would put us on. 
But it got to a point where just nobody would put us on, we couldn't get
 any shows. So we started playing clubs by ourselves. Then eventually 
the shows started getting longer and developed into what it is. But the 
thing about the Nukes show was we only played an hour, and it was fun 
(laughs), because you could go like a runaway train in an hour. We could
 come off and dance around the block after that, so it was funny. And I 
wanted to do something with that, and it was just one of the best 
things. I felt real good about it.<br>
<br>
I was told you plan to be on tour until next summer.<br>
<br>
Because I want to play in the summertime this year. I just miss doing 
that, I miss travelling around and playing in the summertime. We haven't
 done that in a while. We're gonna do this tour, and then it stops for 
Christmas a little while, and then we go to Canada, and then the South 
and then overseas. I want to do that because we've never been overseas, 
we've only been overseas for four shows, and that was in 1975. We've 
only done two shows in England and that was the kind of shows that, 
well, one was the kind of show that, when I think back upon it, was the 
kind of show that I don't want our shows to go. That was the worst, and 
that was when I was real down.<br>
<br>
Talking about moods, I thought that the Wild and Innocent LP had a real 
happy mood to it across the whole record. Born to Run was a mixed bag, 
but one of the reasons I especially liked Darkness was its consistency 
of mood. It ultimately seemed very depressing, especially "Racing in the
 Street." Are there any kind of moods on the new LP that you can put 
your finger on?<br>
<br>
Well, it's different. When I did Darkness, I was very focused on one 
particular idea, one particular feeling that I wanted to do. In the show
 there are all sorts of things, there's a wide range of emotion.<br>
<br>
But when I listen to Darkness, I wanna go slit my wrists.<br>
<br>
Yeah. Like you say, that's my favorite record, Darkness, so this time 
one of the things that I felt was that on Darkness, I didn't make room 
for certain (pauses) things, you know. Because I just couldn't 
understand how you could feel so good and so bad at the same time. And 
it was very confusing to me. "Sherry Darling" was gonna be on Darkness, 
"Independence Day" was a song that was gonna be on Darkness, and the 
song I wrote right after Darkness was "Point Blank" which takes that 
thing to its furthest. Because at the time, I remember because Jon asked
 me, I said "Jon, I just can't see all this different stuff being on it 
because it's gonna be too confusing for people," and he said "No, it's 
not gonna be too confusing for people," and I said, "Well, I guess it's 
gonna be too confusing for me." It just is that way for me right now, 
for some reason<br>
<br>
I was surprised that there weren't any razor blades attached to the LP.<br>
<br>
Yeah, well it wasn't meant to be that way. After Born to Run and all 
that stuff I felt that was just the way it was. And so when I did this 
album, I tried to accept the fact that, you know, the world is a 
paradox, and that's the way it is. And the only thing you can do with a 
paradox is live with it. I wanted to do that this time out; I wanted to 
live with particularly conflicting emotions, because I always person 
ally, in a funny kind of way, lean toward the Darkness kind of material.
 When I didn't put the album out in '79, it was because I didn't feel 
that that was there, I felt that that was missing and I didn't feel that
 that was right. And even when the band says "Why isn't this on it, why 
isn't that on it," what do you say, "Gee. I don't know"? It was 
something where I just got a bigger picture of it, I felt, what things 
are, of the way things work, and I tried to just learn to be able to 
live with that. I mean, how can you live when sometimes things are so 
beautiful, and I know it sounds corny but...<br>
<br>
So I'm gonna listen to The River and I'm gonna feel that paradox you're talking about?<br>
<br>
I think so. In the end, I think that's the emotion. What I wanted was just the paradox of those things.<br>
<br>
Did a lot of the time spent in deciding what tracks went on the LP work 
to this whole approach of balance? Does the paradox correspond to the 
way you personally feel?<br>
<br>
Well there's the thing where a lot of stuff just ROCK rocks, and that 
was the main thing. There's a lot of idealistic stuff on there, there's a
 lot of stuff that, hey, you can listen to it and laugh at it or 
whatever, some of it is very idealistic, and I wanted that all on there.
 At first, I wasn't gonna put it all on there, but sometimes I just feel
 those things. Sometimes when I'm playing... like life just ain't this 
good, you know? And it just ain't. And it may never ever be. But that 
doesn't make those emotions not real. Because they are real and they 
happen. And that stuff happens onstage a lot, when people sing some of 
the songs it's like a community thing that happens that don't happen in 
the street. You go out on the street and it's just a dream. Hey, that's 
the way it's supposed to be. And a lot of songs we do now, they're just 
dreams, but they're based on an emotion that's very real, and they're 
always being possibilities. To say no to that stuff is wrong, to say no 
to it is wrong and to give yourself to it is a lie. To give yourself 
over is an illusion. On the album I was interested in, I saw it as 
romantic. It's a romantic record and to me, romantic is when you see 
realities and when you understand the realities, but you also see the 
possibilities. And sometimes you write about things as they are, and 
sometimes you write about them as they should be, as they could be, 
maybe, you know? And that's basically what I wanted to do. And you can't
 say no to either thing. If you say no, you're cheating yourself out of 
feelings that are important and should be a part of you.<br>
<br>
Do you have a girlfriend now? Do you find yourself lacking the time for 
strong relationships like that and does it affect your material?<br>
<br>
That always affects you, and I've always had a girlfriend, same one now 
that I've been going out with for a couple of years, and that always 
affects a lot of things. The band, some of the guys are in their 30s, 
some are in their early 20s, and I realize that you think different 
then, you don't think the same way you did when you were 20, and I try 
to stay in tune to that fact. And the music I write has, I think, those 
extra 10 years in there. And there's other guys who do other things, 
younger things, and they say that, you know? And on this record, it was 
funny, some of the guys got married, some... it was just a sense of the 
conflict everybody feels; you want to be a part of it. You want to walk 
down the street and feel that you're a part of all those people. There's
 a combination with people where you're drawn to being with them, while 
at the same time you're horrified by them, repulsed by them, scared by 
them. That was the other thing I hoped I was gonna be able to get in the
 record, that you have both of those feelings and they're both real and 
they're both honest and that that's the way it is.<br>
<br>
I'm sure you agree that while there's "x," amount of words and "x" 
amount of melodies, the combination of both is unlimited as are the 
effects. One of the strong points of Darkness, I thought, was the 
conflict of moods between both.<br>
It was different, yeah at the end of Darkness, the guy ends up feeling very isolated.<br>
<br>
There are parallels, between that character's feelings and your own 
life, starting out as a happy guy with happy music. that suddenly ends 
up on the cover of tons of magazines. How, much of that music is about a
 character and how, much is about yourself?<br>
<br>
Every guy that writes a song is writing about himself in the most 
general way I'm talking, like it comes outta you. Why did it come out of
 you? And all the facts are changed, you think up a lot of stuff and 
some stuff is real, I don't know. I had a funny... New Jersey was funny.
 It was very insulated. I grew up playing in bars since I was 15 and I 
always liked my job. I liked going down to that club, and if I made $35 a
 week or whatever, it didn't matter because I liked the job I was doing 
and I was enjoying it. I was lucky enough that from when I was very 
young, I was able to make my living at it. And it went along and, I 
mean, I never knew anyone who made a record, I never knew anyone who 
knew anyone who even knew anyone in the professional music business. 
(laughs) We didn't even brush up against people like that back then, you
 were away from it. You weren't there. And that's the way it was same 
bunch of guys, same town. And when I got out more, well, things changed.
 You get older and things change. I mean, I liked my job.<br>
<br>
Do the guys in the band miss going out and playing?<br>
<br>
That's the way it is. People miss it, but, believe it or not, I'm going as fast as I can. (laughs)<br>
<br>
Is that really true?<br>
<br>
I was burning up man, let me tell you, I ain't kidding you. (laughs) The
 stuff is really... like we didn't do a whole lot of takes of each song.
 I don't think there's a song on there that went anymore than ten takes,
 and most of them were done under five. The only overdubbing is vocal 
overdubbing, and that's not on everything. Most of the stuff we recorded
 very fast, and when you get a chance to listen to it, we recorded it in
 a big room and we got a real hard drum sound. Of them all, I think it's
 the album that most captures what happens when we play. But it's the 
kind of thing where I don't know if I'll ever make records fast, because
 I don't see the point in making them fast.<br>
<br>
Well, there's a view, in the rock world that you should go in bang them 
out as it's more spontaneous that way. Would you say The River is 
spontaneous?<br>
<br>
It is very spontaneous. Spontaneity, number one, is not made by 
fastness. Elvis, I believe, did like 30 takes of "Hound Dog," and you 
can put THAT thing on. The idea is to sound spontaneous. I mean it's to 
be spontaneous, but it's like these records come out that were done real
 fast and they sound like they were done real fast. If I thought I 
could've made a better record in half the time, that's exactly what I 
would've done. Because, I would've rather been out playing. It's the 
kinda thing where, I mean, I know what I'm listening to when I hear it 
played back, and I just had particular guidelines. And one thing, it's 
not a musically put together record. I mean, the performances were fast.
 I think the thing that takes the most time is the thinking, the 
conceptual thing. It takes a certain amount of time for me to think 
about exactly what it is I wanna do, and then I gotta wait until I 
finally realize that I've actually done it. You know, we made the Gary 
US Bonds thing real fast, and a lot of the things on this were made very
 fast It's just the ALBUM that took a long time.<br>
<br>
Why did you change your opinion about bootlegs?<br>
<br>
I felt that there was a point there where, when it first started, a lot 
of bootlegs were made by fans, there was more of a connection. But it 
became, there was a point where there were just so many. Just so many 
that it was big business. It was made by people who, you know, they 
didn't care what the quality was. It just got to the point where I'd 
walk in and see a price tag of $30 on a record of mine that, to me, 
really sounded bad, and I just thought it was a rip. I thought I was 
getting ripped, I wrote the music, the songs - it all came out of me! 
And I felt it was a rip, and the people who were doing it had warehouses
 full of records and were just sitting back, getting fat, rushing and 
putting out anything and getting 30 fucking dollars for it. And I just 
got really mad about it at one point.<br>
<br>
Are you ever gonna come out with some of this live stuff? I've got some that I like just because I'm a fan.<br>
<br>
I don't know. I have a hard time listening to them, because I always 
hear the bad things. I guess the main thing is that I just want to make a
 live record. The plan was to do a live one after this one.<br>
<br>
Some of the stuff is great like the CBS tape of "Santa Claus" and the 
Greg Kihn song "Rendezvous." Why did you give that away? Did it sound 
too much like a Born to Run song?<br>
<br>
That song I wrote in about five minutes before a rehearsal one day. We 
played it on tour and we liked it, and I liked him because I liked the 
way he did "For You" on that early album, and we just had it around and I
 told him "Hey, we got this song that we're not recording now." That's 
mainly how some of those songs got out. I just wrote them fast.<br>
<br>
I remember you playing tunes like "Independence Day," "The Ties That 
Bind" and "Point Blank" two years ago. Were those written for Darkness 
but just didn't fit your concept?<br>
<br>
The reason they got thrown out was because of this thing I was telling 
you about, the way I felt about the Darkness album. I don't know, that's
 just the way I felt about them at the time.<br>
<br>
Are you your own worst critic?<br>
<br>
I think you certainly should be. That's the way you have to be. You have to be most severe with yourself<br>
<br>
Do you anticipate a large critical backlash after being on top for so long?<br>
<br>
That stuff happens all the time, besides, that's happened to me already,
 I've lived that already. And it's the kind of thing that just happens; 
people write good things and then they don't. The first time I went 
through that it was confusing for me, it was disheartening. I guess I 
felt that I knew what I wanted to do and what I was about. The same old 
story when I was 25 when that first happened and I'd been playing for 10
 years. Now I'm 31, so I went through that. When you first come up and 
people start writing about you, you're just not used to it. It's just 
strange. There were a lot of things that brought me real down at the 
time, and there were a lot of things that brought me real up. I was very
 susceptible to being immediately emotionally affected by something like
 that at the time. But I went through it, I saw it happen, I saw how it 
happens. I was younger and I was much more insecure. I hadn't put the 
time in that we've put in since then, and seen some of the things that 
happened since then happen. I've seen all sides of the music thing, and 
now, whatever happens is only gonna be a shadow of that moment. So if a 
lot of people wrote a lot of good stuff and then they wrote a lot of bad
 stuff whatever happens, it happens. You have a concern about it, 
because I spent a long time and put a lot into doing a record. Same old 
story, anybody who says it ain't a heartbreaker, it ain't true. (laughs)
 But that's the way things are, and I'm at a point now where I got a 
better perspective on a lot of those things.<br>
<br>
Any changes in the future?<br>
<br>
No, I don't see changing the particular way that I do that thing right now, because...<br>
<br>
You're happy.<br>
<br>
Yeah. Because if I felt that if I was just sitting there and squeezing 
the life out of the music, I wouldn't do it. But that's not what 
happens, that's not what we do. The physical act is not what takes the 
time, I mean, this was our fifth album. We rented the studio. We knew 
how to make a record. As fast or slow as we wanted to, you know? The 
physical thing is not the story, it's how you feel inside about it, and 
that don't run on any clock, just how you feel inside. Just where you 
are today and what your record is gonna be saying out there, and what 
the people that buy that record are going to feel and get from it. I had
 an idea, and I wasn't going to go half way with it, wasn't no point in 
it. Like I said, I don't trust no tomorrows on that kind of thing. And 
I'd rather do the time and the time is no fun to do because if I didn't 
do the time there, I couldn't walk out there on that stage. We're going 
to be playing a lot of shows, and we're going to be out there for a real
 long time. And when I go out there at night, I just like to feel like 
myself like I've done what I have to do. And when I play those songs 
onstage, I know those songs, I know what went into them and I know where
 I stand. And people will and people will not like it, but I know that 
it's real. I know that it's there.</div>

“Casing the Promised Land”<br>
By Bart Bull</strong><br>
<br>
Go back in time to 1975 on a hot, sweaty day in Arizona when journalist Bart Bull took Bruce Springsteen to the State Fair.<br>
<br>
Could you think of a better place to spend a day with Bruce Springsteen 
than at a carnival? In November of 1975, following five months of 
touring and interviews in support of Born to Run, that’s exactly where 
you could find Bruce and Miami Steve, at the Arizona State Fair, 
relaxing on a rare night off.<br>
Bruce was in the middle of a three show stand in Phoenix, one of the 
first cities west of the Rockies where Springsteen found major 
acceptance. The shows were Springsteen’s biggest paying concerts to 
date, thanks in part to an arrangement by Mike Appel to promote the 
shows themselves. When the band rolled into most cities on the Born to 
Run tour, they might take home three or four thousand dollars, but these
 three shows in Phoenix brought the band nearly $ 40,000. <br>
Journalist Bart Bull was assigned to write a story on Springsteen in 
Arizona for the now defunct magazine Sounds, a Phoenix tabloid. He spent
 the better part of two days following Springsteen around, and his 
resulting story reads more like a camcorder home video than an 
interview. Bull captures a candid side of Springsteen rarely seen at any
 point of his career. The story itself was only seen by a few readers 
since Sounds couldn’t make a go of it and folded.<br>
Rather than interview Springsteen directly, Bull tells his story by 
recording how Bruce interacts with the people around him and describing 
the scene from a “fly on the wall” perspective.<br>
In Springsteen’s comments you’ll hear some of the pressure of months of 
interviews and hype accusations starting to get to him. The shows in 
Phoenix were the end of the west coast tour, just prior to shows in 
Florida before the European tour. Also documented is an appearance by 
manager Mike Appel who tries to convince Springsteen to fly to Hollywood
 on what would be a few days off between dates, to meet with film 
producer Dino De Laurentis. Bruce was being considered for a part in the
 film King of the Gypsies, though as Bull so clearly captures, Appel’s 
interest in the project is not shared by Springsteen.<br>
Bull’s writing has appeared in numerous magazines and newspapers and 
he’s worked as an editor for both Spin and Details. This piece for 
Sounds was one of his first major pieces of journalism, and as such 
reflects the style of a young writer. Still, the enthusiasm of this 
article from 16 years ago captures what it was like to follow Bruce 
Springsteen around at a point in his history when energy and activity 
surrounded him.<br>
The language and perspective that Bull captured here provide a virtual 
time machine back to November 1975. So buy some cotton candy, don’t get 
taken by the barkers and join Miami Steve and Bruce Springsteen at the 
State Fair.<br>
<br>
“Hey! Hey, where ya guys from?” This grizzled old carny, this guy behind
 the counter of the toss-a-dart-and-win-a-poster joint, with his face so
 full of steel grey whiskers you could sand a rough-cut pine plank 
smooth on them, he’s looking across the counter at these young hotshots,
 two of them with ear-rings in their left ears and both of ‘em acting 
like they never saw a poster booth like this one here in all their whole
 lives. “Where ya guys from?”<br>
“New Jersey,” the slick one says, the one in the powder blue suit and straw panama with the matching blue hatband.<br>
“Hey, he-e-ey, compadre!” says Whiskers, stroking his red-veined protrusion of a nose in delight. “Me too! What city?”<br>
“Asbury Park,” rasps the one in the blue workshirt and still unwashed 
new Levi’s. His voice and the carny’s are marvelous matches in their 
chainbeaten roughness and in their equal shares of the dense Jersey 
patois. “The Pride of…” mumbles the kid with a blond ponytail who is 
leaning on the edge of the counter watching Bruce Springsteen, Asbury 
Park’s favorite son, stretch over the counter and direct his dart at the
 poster he calls “the California one,” a black-and-white beach scene 
featuring a young man in a bathing suit looking down at the tide 
spreading toward his feet.<br>
“Hey,” Whiskers grins, buffing his nose to a glossy sheen, “I’m from Union City.”<br>
“Awright,” Miami Steve says, distracted, still astonished at discovering
 that all you’ve got to do to win a poster is throw a dart and hit it, 
even though all the posters are within an easy arm’s reach. He has a 
suspicious, preoccupied grin, like a child who has been handed the key 
to the candy store and is waiting to be let in on the inevitable catch. 
He puts down his stuffed snake in order to shake the gnarled mitt 
Whiskers is extending in his direction, then he reaches up and pulls his
 panama low onto his brow and begins sizing up the posters plastered in 
front of him. Whiskers wets his thumb for traction on the slick surface 
of Bruce’s California poster, then spins it into a tight tube and hands 
it over. Bruce grabs it and, waving it around him as though trying to 
ward off airborne aggressors, walks off into the glare of the Flying 
Bobs, as the sound system pumps out “Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl.”<br>
<br>
It’s Wednesday, there’s no show tonight and Bruce and his lead guitarist
 Miami Steve Van Zandt, and Don, the band’s road manager, are at the 
Arizona State Fair looking for something to do, looking to unwind a 
little. Bruce was a bit disappointed at just two encores at last night’s
 show, and now this Hollywood business. It’s getting to be a real drag. 
“They got me going to California Thursday after the show,” he tells the 
blond kid, “to meet some guy and then talk to him.” Striding down the 
midway, walking his tough punk walk, a walk that fits him right in with 
all the other tough punks cruising the carnival, he is distinguished 
only by his pensive look and by the fact that there is a photographer 
with curly red-hair scrambling to get shots of this particular punk at 
the fair.<br>
It’s a slow and rainy weeknight in the final days of the fair, the 
asphalt aisles are wet and empty, and the carnies aren’t pushing the 
goods the way they would if there was a crowd around. Besides, 
Springsteen and Don and Miami Steve – Bruce never calls him Steve or 
even just Miami, it’s always Mi-ami Ste-e-e-eve – are easy marks. Miami 
Steve even falls for the one where you try to toss ping-pong balls into 
glass ashtrays as they swirl around a wading pool.<br>
A genuine sucker’s shot, one that nobody ever wins, except maybe that 
lantern-jawed cowboy over there, the one with larceny in mind who’s 
looking surreptitiously from side to side, waiting until the carnies 
aren’t watching, then leaning way, way, way over 
and…ever…so…gently…gently… dropping…Damn! But eventually he manages to 
slip one in and the carnies grab a big stuffed Saint Bernard and toss it
 back and forth to each other, chanting “Anothah winnah! Anothah 
winnah!” and Tex is grinning so hard it looks like he actually believes 
he won it, like he truly believes he slipped it past them, like the 
carnies never even noticed. While they’re yelling and tossing his dog 
around, ol’ Tex keeps up a steady pumping motion of his elbow right into
 the ribs of his girlfriend so as to focus her attention properly on his
 moment of triumph.<br>
Miami Steve notices all this action – or at least the last part, anyway –
 and figures this one has got to be his game. If a dope like Tex can win
 a dog, a bright guy like himself could maybe end up owning the whole 
concession. He plunks down his buck, gets his dozen ping-pong balls – 
the sheer number of balls ought to be a tip-off – and begins tossing. 
The frustration of watching the balls hit the ashtrays dead exact center
 and then bounce happily right back out again gets to him quick. He 
slips over to the kid in the ponytail, gets him to sneak him some of the
 balls that are rolling around beneath the counter. The ploy nets him a 
couple of extra ping-pong balls but no winners. He strikes out. Less 
dejected than amazed at his lack of success, he hustles to catch up with
 Bruce, who’s on his way to the screen machines.<br>
They start with a duck-hunting machine, then move over to Anti-Aircraft,
 two gunners trying to shoot down planes as they jet across the screen 
to the sound of engines roaring and calamitous explosions. “We got it – 
this is our machine,” chortles Miami Steve. “This is our machine, Boss!”
 The Boss is leaning back grim-lipped, trying to gun down the jet that 
just snuck by all that Miami Steve enthusiasm. Behind them, the 
game-trailer attendant is eyeing them impatiently and the instant the 
last plane goes down with a stuttering buzz, he lowers the trailer’s 
siding. Bruce and Miami Steve are searching their pockets for more 
quarters, oblivious, but when the carny lowers the siding right on top 
of them, Miami Steve stage-whispers “Hey, I think they’re trying to give
 us a message,” and everyone starts looking for the way out. The 
carnival lights are going out.<br>
Winding their way around the fairgrounds, on the lookout for some way 
out of here, they split into two groups. Up front, the redhead 
photographer and Miami Steve are engaged in a philosophical dispute at a
 volume level on the borderline between discussion and armed combat; 
Springsteen, Don and the kid in the blond ponytail lag behind. “I O.D’d 
on interviews,” Springsteen is saying, scuffling his boot at an empty 
popcorn box. “Everybody wants to spend all their time talkin’ about what
 we’re doin’. All I want to do is do it, but it’s getting harder and 
harder.” His speaking voice is somehow identical to the pained 
Brando-esque voice on his records. It would sound affected if it didn’t 
come so easily. Maybe it was an affectation back in some dim and 
insecure adolescence, when a skinny kid from Jersey first tried it on in
 front of his friends, like a new leather jacket, unstained and without 
rips. Now, all thoroughly broken-in, nothing could sound more natural.<br>
<br>
The two small groups pass by a flag-draped stage where “Poncie Pone – 
TV’s favorite Hawaiian cab driver” had appeared with his Royal Hawaiian 
Revue only a short while earlier. Outside the farm exhibition hall there
 is a wooden box painted to resemble an old-fashioned red barn, with a 
glass showcase in front. On the other side of the glass resides a 
chicken, a hen who will, if a dime is shoved in the slot, take a few 
random pecks at the toy piano inside the barn. Miami Steve spies 
Henrietta the Musical Chicken and looks over his shoulder to where Bruce
 is walking. “Hey,” he shouts, “here’s one of them chickens.”<br>
Bruce adjusts his hands-in-pockets scuffling to swing by the chicken’s 
cage. He passes with a few feet, looking hard, looking intently, but not
 stopping long enough to stick a dime in. “Those poor chickens. They 
ought to…in Jersey it’s against the law to do that.” He jams his hands 
into his pockets even harder, then begins to mumble to himself. 
Suddenly, looking up at Don, he says “I don’t think I wanna go. Mike 
keeps telling me I gotta go, but I’ll just get on some plane and go 
there and meet this guy and then get back on another plane. I don’t 
think I’m gonna go.” His boot heels are dragging across the fairgrounds.<br>
“Okay with me,” says Don affably. “You’re the Boss.” The exit Miami 
Steve has been leading them to is locked, so they detour through the 
flood-lit cattle barn, across fresh-swept floors smelling slightly of 
manure and sweet hay.<br>
Hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched high, Springsteen broods, 
slowing only to look sideways at a big heifer who grunts as the Boss 
passes by. A guard lets them out a gate and they converge on the nearly 
empty lot where the car is parked. The discussion Miami Steve is having 
with the photographer has reached new and louder levels of convolution 
and Don has gone over to supply some reinforcement for Miami Steve, who 
is punctuating an important point by prodding the photographer with a 
stuffed snake. The kid in the ponytail says something to Springsteen 
about a hype. “Like I said, I O.D’d on publicity. I mean, I like it, I 
like to talk to people about my music, but it’s getting to be so much, 
you know? I mean, after a while, the only people who read what a 
writer’s got to say is other writers.”<br>
“But aren’t you a writer?” the kid asks.<br>
“Yeah, but what I’m doin’…it’s like I’m here and that’s all you can say.
 I’m doin’ what I want – I mean, all I ever wanted to do was make 
records, have a band like this. I don’t want all this other stuff, ya 
know?” His hands, which had been pulled from his pockets to illustrate 
his intentions, are jammed back in, and he rocks back and forth on the 
heels of his boots. The kid persists. “But you’re a writer too. It’s not
 like you just went out and picked up the guitar and started singing. 
It’s not like you never read anything…”<br>
“Nah,” Bruce cuts in. “I never read that much. Just enough to get the 
concepts, the framework, ya know? There isn’t anybody, any names I could
 tell ya I dig, just some things. But I never really read that much, 
except in high school when they made me. I listened to records – that’s 
where I learned, man.”<br>
The kid is having a hard time accepting that. “You mean you don’t pay attention to the reviews, you don’t…”<br>
Bruce cuts in again. “Nah, man, I mean there’s no way – if a kid hears 
an album he likes, he’s gonna go get it. If he likes it a lot, he’s 
gonna go grab his friends and make them listen to it, or go to the show 
and if it hits ‘em, they’re gonna buy it. I mean, they probably read the
 reviews some, that’s what they’re there for, really, so you can find 
out what’s goin’ on, but you can get into that stuff too much and then 
it slows you down, you can’t do anything because you’re afraid that 
somebody isn’t going to like it. All that really happens is if people 
listen and like it. If they have a good time, that’s all, that’s it. I 
feel like, who cares, man, all these people talkin’. I’m just trying to 
let it pass over me. I’m me, you know? People are gonna do what they’re 
gonna do anyhow. I can’t stop ‘em, but I ain’t gonna try.”<br>
While he’s been talking, a father and his family have all loaded into 
their Chevy Impala. The dad puts the key in and starts it, but then he 
sees something, gets out and comes around back where Bruce and the kid 
are. He bends over and pulls a cardboard sign – parking $ 1.50 – from 
his bumper where the attendant has abandoned it. Dad looks the place 
over, adjusts his suit, then walks over to the bearded guy with the 
earring, and in his best man-of-authority Dad-tone says “Here you go – 
don’t you want this?” He hands Bruce the sign. Miami Steve and Don are 
over at the rental car, trying to rouse somebody named Saddhu from a 
deep sleep in the front seat. “Saddhu! Get up! Time to go, Saddhu!” 
Springsteen stares a moment at the sign he’s holding, and lets it fall 
to the ground, then steps over it. <br>
By the next afternoon Saddhu seems to have at least partially regained 
consciousness. Miami Steve introduces him at poolside to a reporter in a
 blinding orange aloha shirt as “our cosmic advisor,” and he looks the 
part. Saddhu is stretched out in the Chamber-of-Commerce-pleasing 
November sun, and if the rosy hue of his skin is any indicator, he has 
already absorbed more than his share of solar energy. Cosmic Advisor to 
Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band indeed. He’s wearing one of the Speedo
 bathing suits which seem to be the poolside uniform for all E Street 
Band members and roadies, and his hair is slicked back and blond, like a
 heavy in an early-Sixties hot rod movie. He appears to have fleshtone 
Clearasil rubbed all over his nose, as well as some white stuff smeared 
around his eyelids. The total effect is fairly sinister, like that of a 
snake with a malicious sunburn.<br>
<br>
His first words to Mister Aloha – “Listen, the Boss is doing a little 
business” – then a nod in the direction of the umbrella-shaded table 
where Bruce and his manager, Mike Appel, are talking – “I wouldn’t 
bother him right now…” – tend to support any sinister impressions. 
Mister Aloha transforms himself into one enormous obsequious grin. “Oh 
no, sir, nope, no-sir-ee, sir, you won’t find me going over there and 
interrupting the mighty Mike Appel, former Marine, notoriously tactless 
and uncouth person and quick-tempered despiser of any lick-spittle 
scribes who should be so presumptuous as to enter his presence without 
proper certification and identification and authorization and 
registration, sir, no sir, not me, sir…” and the craven reporter does a 
veritable Stepin Fetchit tapdance over to the nearest chaise lounge. 
Leaning back with the relief of a Christian only recently delivered from
 some especially cranky lions, he exchanges benign pleasantries with 
Miami Steve and then hits him with a barrage of technical questions from
 some guitar magazine.<br>
Miami Steve is hunched over a room service tray with a bowl of Sugar 
Frosted Flakes curdling rapidly in the early Arizona afternoon sun. He’s
 telling Mister Aloha some fairly questionable stories of his musical 
past when Bruce walks over: “See, when I first met Bruce, he was playin’
 the guitar with the strings backwards. Yeah, he had ‘em on the side 
facing his body. I told him, “Look, kid. You gotta put ‘em the other 
way, so the audience can see ‘em.’ He says, ‘Aw, what do they know?’”<br>
Bruce is wearing a Speedo too, and a gold loop in his ear. He flops down
 and starts spreading oil over his body. He has the muscle tone of a 
former contender in the New Jersey Golden Gloves tournament, 
welterweight division. He wasn’t, but he makes for a surprising contrast
 with most rock’n’roller’s pasty flab.<br>
Saddhu looks up and offers the Boss some of his organic sesame seed 
cookie. The offer is refused, with a small shudder. “He don’t want none 
of that,” scoffs Miami Steve.<br>
“If he did, he might get as healthy as me,” Saddhu returns. He puffs his
 chest out, arms stiff at his sides, in an approximated imitation of a 
Muscle Beach bodybuilder. “Man, when the sun turns me this color, I’m 
human…” His voice trails off as he searches for the right word.<br>
Mister Aloha has it. “Dynamo?”<br>
“Yeah, right, a human dynamo,” and with that, he hurls himself into the 
pool. Mister Aloha and Miami Steve go back to their guitar interview, 
and Bruce shuts his eyes and lowers himself slowly back into the deck 
lounge. Miami Steve is telling all about his first amplifier – “It was a
 little thing, looked like a radio, sounded great. Turn that thing up 
and get all kinds of distortion! I wonder what I did with that thing…Hey
 Bruce! Didn’t I give it to you, that little amp I used to have?”<br>
“Never gave me no amp,” Springsteen mutters from behind closed lids.<br>
“Sure I did. That was right after I taught you everything you know about
 the guitar, as I was just explaining to this gentleman here.”<br>
Bruce leans forward, lets loose a snorting laugh, with lots of jaw 
action. They crank up and start talking about old times, reminiscing 
about one of Bruce’s old bands, Miami Steve calls The Brucie Revue. 
“Man, it was big, it had everything. Girl singers, horns, everything.”<br>
<br>
After that, Mister Aloha, Miami Steve and the Boss just lay out in the 
sun and gas about old bands and new records, with an occasional 
interruption when one or another falls into the pool for a few strokes. 
Mister Aloha shows Bruce a review stating that Born to Run, his recently
 released third record is a concept album, sort of a secret narrative, 
with homages to the great production styles of the Sixties. “Nah, it 
wasn’t no concept album,” Springsteen says, growing quieter. “I was 
just…” He pauses. “It wasn’t no concept album.” reaches for an inflamed 
pimple nestled in the lower reaches of his chin whiskers, and touches 
it, fondles it. “See, when I write a song, I look at a theme, and then, 
maybe, I write another one, on the same theme, but a different side.” He
 smoothes the hair away from the pimple. “If you’re looking at the songs
 that way, I can see how you might think they make a story,” he says 
cautiously, “but I didn’t really mean it that way, ya know?”<br>
“So that means the review was worthless,” Mister Aloha asks.<br>
“No,” Bruce replies, hesitating, “I mean, I don’t want to say you can’t 
look at it that way. I mean, anyway you want to look at it, that’s all 
right, I guess. It’s just that I wasn’t really trying to do that one 
certain thing with it.” He stops ministering to his zit and begins 
rubbing more baby oil on his chest.<br>
“What about ‘Born to Run,’ the Spector sound, I mean you did it so well, it really recreates the sound,” Mister Aloha gushes.<br>
“Well,” comes the carefully-phrased response, “no one can really 
recreate that sound.” Bruce and Miami Steve recently attended a Dion 
session being produced by Phil Spector during which the Master unleashed
 a few sarcasm-tipped barbs in the direction of the Apprentice. Bruce is
 deliberate and respectful when he says, “You can’t really recreate that
 sound. The things he does are so… anyway, we got he sound we were 
looking for.”<br>
Saddhu has made his way out of the pool, perched upon one of the lounge 
chairs, pulled some radio headphones over his ears, pointed their 
antennae toward the stratosphere and then, eyes closed, with a look of 
bliss beaming forth from his face, gone into a yogic spinal twist. Bruce
 is checking him out, the look on his own face mingling awe and 
amusement, when he sees Mike Appel coming. He shuts his eyes and leans 
back into his chair again.<br>
<br>
Mike Appel is relatively large but he looks larger; square-shouldered, 
in his early-to-mid 30s, black hair layered into a Businessman’s Trendy,
 he’s notoriously brusque and outspoken. One business acquaintance says,
 “After arguing with him for months, I think he is beginning to respect 
me.” He has been trying to convince Bruce to fly to Hollywood after his 
Phoenix concerts to meet film producer Dino De Laurentis and speak with 
him about a possible acting vehicle. As he comes close, Springsteen 
lifts boyish arms skyward and cries, “Hey, Mike! This is what you need. A
 little sun. You need to slow for a while and catch some rays.”<br>
Appel stands over Bruce, his arms folded. “I’ll slow down in January. I’ll take a little time off then.”<br>
“Nah, Michael, what you need is a little sun now. Maybe you should come to Miami with me and we’ll…”<br>
“What I need is for you to come to L.A. Maybe you should come to L.A and
 then we’ll get you right to Miami and then you can lay around in the 
sun all you want.”<br>
“I don’t think I want to go to L.A, Michael,” says the Boss.<br>
Appel repeats it tonelessly. “Ya don’t want to go to L.A.” A pause. 
“Well, I think you should go over and talk to this guy. I think it would
 be a great thing.”<br>
Bruce reflects. “Who is the guy again? What pictures has he done?”<br>
“His name is Dino De Laurentis, he did…awh, what’s the name…?”<br>
Mister Aloha is ever-willing to be helpful. “He did The Bible.”<br>
Miami Steve, suitably, awe-stricken, turns to Bruce, “He did The Bible? 
Listen, Boss, uh, maybe you better go see this guy, ya know? I mean 
there’s no sense in getting him upset. Besides, maybe we can get a part 
in it for me. I’d be great as the Son of God.”<br>
The Boss is amused. “Hey, what could Kahuna be?” The band’s name for sax
 man Clarence Clemons is the Big Kahuna. “Hey, I got it. He could be the
 Ark.”<br>
Appel gets in on the act. “Hey, I got the part for you,” he growls, pointing at Miami Steve. “You could be Judas.”<br>
“Me!” howls the wounded guitarist. “I was gonna have ‘em save that one for you.” The words hang in the air too long.<br>
Appel straps right back down to business. “I think you ought to go,” he 
tells the Boss. “You leave tonight, get there tomorrow, and we’ll have 
you in Miami on Saturday. Then you can lay out in the sun until 
Tuesday.” His position is clear, Appel clears out. The Boss leans back 
once more, closing his eyes.<br>
When he opens them again, Don has appeared to dole out Miami Steve’s 
salary. Bruce looks over to him, as he holds out the payroll book for 
Miami Steve’s signature. “Hey, do you think I should go to California?”<br>
Don looks over his shoulder for a moment, then says, “I think you should get on a plane for Miami tonight.” He disappears.<br>
Miami Steve invites Bruce to come along to Texas with him. Mister Aloha 
wonders what Miami Steve’s up to in Texas. “He’s going to spill, as it 
were, his vital fluids,” says Saddhu.<br>
“Nah, man,” Bruce says, “I just want to lay out in Miami.” He gets up 
and dives into the pool, swims a couple of laps, then returns. Mister 
Aloha, apparently not the most tactful person, carries right on with his
 interrogation. “Hey Bruce. What part did Jon Landau actually play in 
the new album’s production?” Landau was brought in after Appel and 
Springsteen had spent months in the studio, producing only one single. 
“Did he show you what you were doing wrong in the studio or what?”<br>
“Landau don’t know nothing about the studio, man. He was just there to 
show us some shortcuts, ya know? Some ways of doing things that was 
easier. He don’t know nothing about the studio, but he’s a smart guy, 
Landau. Wasn’t for him, the album still might not be out.”<br>
Next, the inquisitive Aloha wants to know if Bruce has some kind of 
explanation for his enormous popularity in Arizona. “Well, I dunno. I 
know the first time we came here, we did a great show, really hot. Then,
 the next time, we did two more, equally good. That’s probably it.” Ever
 since Bruce and Mister Aloha started talking irrelevancies, Miami Steve
 has been immersed in his Mafioso mystery book, but now he looks at his 
watch and lets them know it’s time to get ready for the show.<br>
The show that night is loose, the band sloppier than on either of the 
two preceding nights, but Bruce and the audience seem driven to 
entertain each other. Springsteen goes through his usual workout, losing
 roughly a gallon of sweat, demonstrating how he maintains his muscle 
tone. Every other guy in sight is wearing his slouch-hat Springsteen 
costume. (“Check their shoes,” says Clarence Clemons. “That’s how you 
know if they really got it together. They gotta have mismatched shoes.”)
 Grady Gammage Auditorium’s second tier rocks nine inches as the balcony
 crowd bops. Architect Frank Lloyd Wright does the graveyard spin, and 
the band comes back for encore after encore. Springsteen is confronted 
by cluster upon cluster of competitive coeds (Clarence indulged a little
 extra Wednesday night and gave a backstage pass to anyone who showed a 
pretty smile), and the cake celebrating the end of the tour ends up 
everywhere.<br>
And when the party is over, the Boss boards a plane for Hollywood.<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
This is the Thursday show mentioned in the article, after which 
Springsteen flew to California. The tour resumed in Tampa, Florida, on 
November 10th.<br>
November 6, 1975 Arizona State University, Phoenix, AZ<br>
THUNDER ROAD / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE OUT / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / PRETTY 
FLAMINGO / SHE’S THE ONE / BORN TO RUN / SANDY / IT’S HARD TO BE A SAINT
 IN THE CITY / BACKSTREETS / KITTY’S BACK / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA / 
DETROIT MEDLEY / TWIST AND SHOUT <br>
Held in the school’s Gammage Auditorium. One of the more memorable – and
 best – shows of the BTR tour. There were phoned-in bomb threats 
received several hours before the start of this show – however, after 
some initial panic by organizers and the Springsteen camp, the police 
determined that the individuals making the threats had gotten their 
schedules mixed up – they’d been intended for controversial ex-Vietnam 
veteran Lieutenant William Calley’s speaking engagement in Gammage the 
previous night. Springsteen delivered a blistering show and worked the 
crowd into a complete frenzy, so much so that the large, humanity-packed
 balcony of Gammage began visibly swaying during the final stages of the
 concert. It was later reported that school officials had nearly decided
 to stop the show prematurely, although a post-concert engineering 
report gave the balcony a clean bill of health.</div>

<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">From Bruce - </span><br>
<br>
At this point, I don’t need my records to be Number One or sell as many 
as this person or that person. That’s not fundamentally important — I 
don’t believe that sustains you.<br>
<br>
In the third grade a nun stuffed me in a garbage can under her desk because she said that’s where I belonged.<br>
<br>
There ain't a note that I play on stage that can’t be traced back directly to my mother and father.<br>
<br>
The first day I can remember looking into a mirror and being able to stand what I saw was the day I had a guitar in my hand.<br>
<br>
You ride in a limousine the first time, it’s a big thrill but after that it’s just a stupid car.<br>
<br>
But then I go through long periods where I don`t listen to things, 
usually when I`m working. In between the records and in between the 
writing I suck up books and music and movies and anything I can find.<br>
<br>
If they had told me I was the janitor and would have to mop up and clean
 the toilets after the show in order to play, I probably would have done
 it.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I had gay friends. The first thing I realized was that everybody`s
 different, and it becomes obvious that all of the gay stereotypes are 
ridiculous.<br>
<br>
I think that is what film and art and music do; they can work as a map of sorts for your feelings.<br>
<br>
I was always concerned with writing to my age at a particular moment. 
That was the way I would keep faith with the audience that supported me 
as I went along.<br>
<br>
In the early years, I found a voice that was my voice and also partly my
 father`s voice. But isn`t that what you always do? Why do kids at 5 
years old go into the closet and put their daddy`s shoes on? Hey, my 
kids do it.<br>
<br>
The best music, you can seek some shelter in it momentarily, but it`s 
essentially there to provide you something to face the world with.<br>
<br>
This music is forever for me. It`s the stage thing, that rush moment 
that you live for. It never lasts, but that`s what you live for.<br>
<br>
I`m a synthesist. I`m always making music. And I make a lot of different
 kinds of music all the time. Some of it gets finished and some of it 
doesn`t.<br>
<br>
I can sing very comfortably from my vantage point because a lot of the 
music was about a loss of innocence, there`s innocence contained in you 
but there`s also innocence in the process of being lost.<br>
<br>
Certainly tolerance and acceptance were at the forefront of my music.<br>
<br>
I always wanted my music to influence the life you were living 
emotionally - with your family, your lover, your wife, and, at a certain
 point, with your children.<br>
<br>
It`s a sad man my friend who`s livin` in his own skin and can`t stand the company.<br>
<br>
In the past, some of the songs that were the most fun, and the most 
entertaining and rocking, fell by the wayside because I was concerned 
with what I was going to say and how I was going to say it.<br>
<br>
I like narrative storytelling as being part of a tradition, a folk tradition.<br>
<br>
The best music is essentially there to provide you something to face the world with.<br>
<br>
Your spoken voice is a part of it - not a big part of it, but it`s 
something. It puts people at ease, and once again kind of reaches out 
and makes a bridge for what`s otherwise difficult music.<br>
<br>
I tend to be a subscriber to the idea that you have everything you need 
by the time you`re 12 years old to do interesting writing for most of 
the rest of your life - certainly by the time you`re 18.<br>
<br>
Plus, you know, when I was young, there was a lot of respect for 
clowning in rock music - look at Little Richard. It was a part of the 
whole thing, and I always also believed that it released the audience.<br>
<br>
From the beginning, I imagined I would have a long work life.<br>
<br>
I have my ideas, I have my music and I also just enjoy showing off, so 
that`s a big part of it. Also, I like to get up onstage and behave 
insanely or express myself physically, and the band can get pretty 
silly.<br>
<br>
In America everything`s about who`s number one today.<br>
<br>
I didn`t know if it would be a success-ful one, or what the stages would
 be, but I always saw myself as a lifetime musician and songwriter.<br>
<br>
I do a lot of curiosity buying; I buy it if I like the album cover, I 
buy it if I like the name of the band, anything that sparks my 
imagination. I still like to go to record stores, I like to just wander 
around and I`ll buy whatever catches my attention.<br>
<br>
Blind faith in your leaders, or in anything, will get you killed.<br>
<br>
It`s always felt natural, because I`m generally very comfortable with people.<br>
<br>
The only thing I can say about having this type of success is that you 
can get yourself in trouble because basically the world is set open for 
you. People will say yes to anything you ask, so it`s basically down to 
you and what you want or need.<br>
<br>
My only general rule was to steer away from things I played with the 
band over the past couple of tours. I was interested in re-shaping the 
Rising material for live shows, so people could hear the bare bones of 
that.<br>
<br>
When I first started in rock, I had a big guy`s audience for my early 
records. I had a very straight image, particularly through the mid `80s.<br>
<br>
You can go from doing something quite silly to something dead serious in
 the blink of an eye, and if you`re making those connections with your 
audience then they`re going to go right along with it.<br>
<br>
Yeah, my son likes a lot of guitar bands. He gave me something the other
 day which was really good. He`ll burn a CD for me full of things that 
he has, so he`s a pretty good call if I want to check some of that stuff
 out... The other two aren`t quite into that yet.<br>
<br>
When it comes to luck, you make your own.<br>
<br>
Your success story is a bigger story than whatever you`re trying to say 
on stage. Success makes life easier. It doesn`t make living easier.<br>
<br>
The release date is just one day, but the record is forever.<br>
<br>
My image had always been very heterosexual, very straight. So it was a 
nice experience for me, a chance to clarify my own feelings about gay 
and lesbian civil rights.<br>
<br>
No, I always felt that amongst my core fans- because there was a level 
of popularity that I had in the mid `80s that was sort of a bump on the 
scale- they fundamentally understood the values that are at work in my 
work.<br>
<br>
But I think that your entire life is a process of sorting out some of those early messages that you got.<br>
<br>
The audiences are there as a result of my history with the band but also
 as a result of my being able to reach people with a tune.<br>
<br>
Basically, I was pretty ostracized in my hometown. Me and a few other 
guys were the town freaks- and there were many occasions when we were 
dodging getting beaten up ourselves.<br>
<br>
I hadn`t performed by myself in a while. It feels very natural to me, 
and I assume people come for the very same reasons as they do when I`m 
with the band: to be moved, for something to happen to them.<br>
<br>
(on Bob Dylan) Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He 
showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean 
that it was anti-intellectual. He had the vision and the talent to make a
 pop record that contained the whole world. <br>
<br>
(About Elvis Presley) There have been a lot of tough guys. There have 
been pretenders. And there have been contenders. But there is only one 
King. <br>
<br>
(About Elvis Presley) He was as big as the whole country itself, as big 
as the whole dream. He just embodied the essence of it and he was in 
mortal combat with the thing. Nothing will ever take the place of that 
guy. <br>
<br>
(During his Oscar acceptance speech): Thanks for inviting me to your party. (imdb)<br>
<br>
When it comes to luck, you make your own. <br>
<br>
Until I realized that rock music was my connection to the rest of the 
human race, I felt like I was dying, for some reason, and I didn`t know 
why. <br>
<br>

<strong class="text-strong">Quotes of others about Bruce Springsteen</strong><br>
<br>
Last Thursday, at the Harvard Square theatre, I saw my rock'n'roll past 
flash before my eyes. And I saw something else: I saw rock and roll 
future and its name is Bruce Springsteen. And on a night when I needed 
to feel young, he made me feel like I was hearing music for the very 
first time.<br>
Jon Landau, The Real Paper (1974)<br>
<br>
The first time I saw Bruce he was opening up for Jethro Tull, before he 
had a record deal. I went to see Bruce because I was singing in that 
area with different bands and I wanted to get in a good rock band and he
 had the best rock band.<br>
Patti Scialfa<br>
<br>
In all my years in this business he is the only person I've met who cares absolutely nothing about money.<br>
John A. Hammond<br>
<br>
When Bruce Springsteen sings on his new album  that's not 'fun', that's fucking triumph, man.<br>
Pete Townshend on Darkness.<br>
<br>
At every date he goes out and sits in every section of the hall to 
listen to the sound. And if it isn't right, even in the last row, I hear
 about it and we make changes. I mean every date too.<br>
Bruce Jackson, sound engineer<br>
<br>
I will always desire to play with Bruce Springsteen. He's the most 
inspirational, most dedicated, most committed and most focused artist 
I've ever seen. I like to be around people like that.<br>
Max Weinberg<br>
<br>
I think he's a great guitarist, a great musician and an excellent 
keyboard player — which most people don't know. But he knows what sets 
him apart from everybody is that he's a brilliant writer. Part of that 
is having a vision to put it across onstage as a performer, too.<br>
Nils Lofgren<br>
<br>
He's so good, you really want to hit him now and again. He'd come to 
rehearsal and he'd write five songs in a day, and he'd do that all the 
time, whenever he felt like it.<br>
Steven van Zandt<br>
<br>
Bruce was writing five or ten songs a week. He would say, "I'm gonna go 
home tonight and write a great song," and he did. He was the Boss then, 
and he's the Boss now.<br>
Steven van Zandt<br>
<br>
I'd heard The Bruce Springsteen Band was nearby at a club called The 
Student Prince. A rainy, windy night it was, and when I opened the door 
the whole thing flew off its hinges and blew away down the street. The 
band were on-stage, but staring at me framed in the doorway. And maybe 
that did make Bruce a little nervous because I just said, "I want to 
play with your band," and he said, "Sure, you do anything you want."<br>
Clarence Clemons<br>
<br>
There'll be no oiling up with this band. The oil has been there for years and it only gets better.<br>
Clarence Clemons<br>
<br>
He's older and wiser but he never strays from his basic values. He cares
 as much, more, about the losers than the winners. He's so unlike 
everything you think a real successful rock star would be.<br>
Roy Bittan<br>
<br>
The label of liberalism is hardly a sentence to public igominy: 
otherwise Bruce Springsteen would still be rehabilitating used Cadillacs
 in Asbury Park and Jane Fonda, for all we know, would be just another 
overweight housewife.<br>
Barbara Ehrenreich - Mother Jones (1986)<br>
<br>
I couldn't believe how happy his music made me and how good it was. He's
 a gift, and I didn't know. I mean, I knew 'Born in the USA' and 'Glory 
Days,' but I didn't know that he covered so much ground, and there was 
something in his music that touched what I was going through, the 
process of falling back in love with my America.<br>
The Killers frontman Brandon Flowers <br>
<br>
The reason I’m running for president is because I can’t be Bruce Springsteen.<br>
President Barack Obama <br>
<br>
Whenever I see Bruce Springsteen do anything, he empties the tank. Every
 time. And the beautiful thing about this man is he empties that tank 
for his family, he empties that tank for his art, he empties that tank 
for his audience, and he empties it for his country. And we, on the 
receiving end of that beautiful gift, are ourselves rejuvenated, if not,
 redeemed.<br>
