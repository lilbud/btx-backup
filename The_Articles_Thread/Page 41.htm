Kevin Norton on March 5, 2012 </strong><br>
<br>
What is it about any particular musician that makes them essential to 
us?  Is it the way they craft a lyric, render joy in our hearts with 
their voice, or how reverently we attend upon their music?  It can be 
many things. The wild surge of emotion that floods us when we hear them,
 the effortless way they make the universal personal or even how they 
make the most every day things have import and meaning. It is almost an 
alchemical reaction of turning the dross within us to gold, it feels 
that good. Of course each of us have our own, entirely subjective, 
criteria we apply to music when we hear it. Whatever internal geography 
we have the music must match in some way for us to welcome it as part of
 us. Perhaps “essential” is too dramatic a word, but it does imply that 
one will be diminished and poorer for the lack of that which is deemed 
primary for the soul to thrive, so perhaps “essential” is apt. In any 
event we know it when we hear it, like something instinctual. The 
artists that provide to us that intangible “something” may be long time 
companions to us or recent introductions. It is always fun to discover 
more, a new voice or song that fills the heart and comforts or 
encourages. There is a commonality that runs through all of those that 
we invest so much in. They become touch stones to us, places we can 
return to again and again for pleasure, shelter, succor, ecstasy or just
 plain fun, whatever we need at the time.<br>
<br>
Three of the musicians that are essential to me are Bob Dylan, Bruce 
Springsteen and Tom Waits. Their appearance here is by no means meant to
 be authoritative or exclusive in any way, simply as subjective 
preferences of mine. I will not burden this conversation with excessive 
adjectives concerning them. It would seem likely that they would be 
found among the lists that many would present as their own essentials, 
but that is only speculation. All three of them are masters at what they
 do and can claim legions of ardent devotees. They all have been true to
 their talent, working both within it and at times beyond it. And, 
perhaps most importantly, they all have that gift of the truly great, of
 being able to take music that is as old and shopworn as God’s house 
shoes and making it sound new, fresh and unmistakably their own.<br>
<br>
To reference Dylan is almost obligatory. It is amazing he still renders 
so much pleasure.  When he first surfaced, all those many years ago, it 
seemed as if he appeared in a flash of light, full grown and fresh from 
the Wilderness, singing and writing songs as if Elvis had never been and
 as if Woody Guthrie would live forever. It is both instructive and 
revelatory to return to those old films of him from that time, to see 
how steeped he was inthe ancient music that fed his muse, how he had 
taken it into the very pores of his skin and his breath. He was infused 
with it, but was not a supplicant to it. His performances were not 
reverential acts of devotion to those field recordings that he ferreted 
out of libraries and second hand record stores, they were a proclamation
 that this music was not dead and old and wizened, not stagnant and 
frozen in time, but alive and that he was giving it voice! You can see 
Woody’s hand upon him, guiding him but not as his master. He had already
 studied his tuition and now it was bearing fruit. He was, as has been 
written of Robert Johnson, that moment when music and musician become 
one. It was quite clear, even then, that Bob was following his own star.<br>
<br>
He is still a work a day guitar player, always dependable but rarely 
dazzling.  His voice today has matured to a husky growl, still as 
enigmatic as ever. He has learned the beauty of economy, and if his 
lyrics do not surge with the fervent tsunamis of imagery they once did, 
his songs still delight. But now more often with the voice of the 
detached observer rather than that of the reluctant oracle. To say he is
 a master song writer is to border on the redundant. There is little in 
the genre of singer song writer and beyond that does not have his finger
 prints upon it in some way. There are those who would have him return 
to conjuring forth those churning, exciting, cryptic and acerbic screeds
 of discontent he once did.  They are missing the point, Dylan has 
always been about having the freedom to change. The moment he finds any 
label too confining he is gone and on to something new. For those who 
can’t keep up he is not in the habit of leaving maps. It is doubtful 
that he would care much about bringing to life such musical edifices 
like his old songs again. Protest is a young man’s game, where you have 
to believe you are absolutely right and that what ever villainy you are 
calling out is absolutely wrong. Maturity does not allow for such a 
black and white world view. And another truth is that the whole thing 
would probably just bore him anyway. He never wanted to be Jeremiah, or 
even Phil Ochs for that matter. Let’s be honest, some of the songs were 
SO long that sometimes even God was checking his watch. They were never 
very melodic so you had Dylan and his guitar and the words, so the words
 better be pretty amazing. And they were.<br>
<br>
Dylan created, rather unintentionally, a veneration for the lyrics that 
had not existed in American popular music before. Elvis may have had The
 Voice and The Moves and The Beauty, but Bob has the words. It is fair 
to say that before him it was pretty much the Dick Clark cliché “it’s 
got a good beat and I can dance to it, I like it.” The lyrics were 
secondary. So when Dylan began to court his muse to ever greater effect,
 there were a lot of young people huddled around record players actually
 LISTENING to what he was saying, and in many cases reading far too much
 into it. This may be why he rejects any sort of orthodoxy about his 
songs from that time.  He treats them rather flippantly in his live 
shows now, often changing tempos and keys and rendering them almost 
unrecognizable, so he might be twenty bars into “Stuck Inside of Mobile”
 before you even know what the hell you’re hearing. In effect what he is
 saying is “I have moved on”.<br>
<br>
One of the things that continue to make Dylan primary is his seemingly 
natural resistance to nostalgia.  He makes no reference to the “good old
 days” of the 60s. nor does he himself seem dated in any way. He always 
seems present and in the moment. The disconnect with many legacy bands 
is that they are always asking their audience to relive their old 
material with them, so they are trying to recapture a moment that is 
gone forever.  This cannot help but make them seem frozen in time and 
irrelevant. If a legacy band does have new material, it is rarely of the
 same quality that their older stuff is. Dylan always seems immediate, 
even when he is singing songs that are old beyond imagining. The true 
artist is not defined by their medium; their medium is defined by them. 
Dylan’s recent music is as alive, difficult to categorize, and relevant 
as ever, he even seems to be having more fun doing it these days.  It is
 to his everlasting credit that he has never attempted to palm off on 
his audience slavishly accurate renditions of his 60s catalog in order 
to appease their desire for it.  One may feel confused upon leaving a 
Dylan concert, but one should never feel pandered to.<br>
<br>
What a thing of wonder his voice has become. Wry, elusive and 
mysterious, with just the right amount of grit.  It is well suited to 
his songs; the rugged tool of a true bluesman. There will always be 
those who say he cannot sing. It all depends on what you mean by 
singing. He has never had a classically beautiful voice, but he has 
always had an interesting voice. Elvis had a beautiful voice. It sounded
 like sunshine on silk, it was that warm and alive. But you were never 
curious as to what he would he would sing next. There were few surprises
 when he sang.  When Dylan sings one is immediately curious about his 
next word and his next twenty words.  His voice has that magnetic 
quality that just draws you in, strange for a singer who tries so 
ardently to be distant. He has the gift of detachment in his voice, 
which usually works against a singer but with Dylan it is an asset. He 
so often appears in his songs as The Witness, offering his quite astute 
observations, but never investing himself that much emotionally. Where 
once he was cryptic and teasing he is now matter of fact, offering no 
resolutions. For this kind of work his voice is perfect. You can almost 
imagine him mounting up and riding out of town at the end.<br>
<br>
Dylan once said in an interview that “it’s bad luck to look for life’s 
guidance to popular entertainers”. He was referencing himself of course,
 and there is good advice in what he is saying. But for the mature 
devotee, who is far from the extremes of youth and knows who they are, 
it is quite gratifying to admire the arc that his bright and still 
moving star is taking. To see the hipster arrogance of “Ballad of a Thin
 Man” give way to the embracing of uncertainty that is “Things Have 
Changed” is to witness the man mature.<br>
<br>
Of all the outlandish, overheated and just plain silly bombast that was 
showered upon Bruce Springsteen when he first appeared on the radar of 
the main stream in 1975, some of the silliest was the idea that he was 
the “new’ Dylan.  You can just see him smiling and saying “didn’t know 
there was any thing wrong with the old one.” If he were Woody Guthrie he
 would have written a song about it. Heady praise for one so young, but 
Bruce knew all the clamorous outcry for what it was, the passing of the 
crowd. To his good fortune he has always possessed an unerring interior 
moral compass that forever shows true north for him. It would have been 
quite easy for him to have become a cautionary tale. All the ingredients
 were there: bright, young talented, charismatic artist, sudden fame, 
hordes of attention, endless accolades with the resident temptations of 
women, drugs and money thrown in besides. Fortune takes the measure of a
 man as well as failure does, sometimes better. But Springsteen calmly 
sidestepped all of that and did what he has continued to do though out 
his career, work.<br>
<br>
He has always approached performing and song writing as a job. A job he 
wants and likes very much, but still a job, requiring discipline, 
practice and time. So he got on with releasing Born to Run and continued
 performing and rode the wave which did, as he knew it would, eventually
 fade to a dull roar.  Not that he wasn’t amazing right out of the box. 
He was and is an explosive, riveting, joyous and supremely gifted 
performer. Add to that the very, very talented E street band when they 
are hot and one is hard pressed to think of anyone who does it better 
live. So his touring then was a kind of evangelism, and there were many 
converts.<br>
<br>
After all these years Born to Run is worth a revisit.  The songs that 
worked best, “Thunder Road” and “Jungle Land”, still work. “Thunder 
Road” for its sheer exuberance at being young and alive and in love and 
“Jungle Land” for its epic scope and masterful success. We still cheer 
for Mary and Bruce to make it to The Promised Land, although we now know
 the adult realities that involves, as does Bruce. It is the rare person
 who can hear that song and not end up singing the chorus all day long. 
 To this day one is touched by the firm tenderness with which Bruce woos
 Mary, the subtle eroticism of “from your front porch to my front seat, 
the doors wide open but the ride ain’t free.” is thrilling without 
crossing over into titillation. The openly human reassurance of “you 
ain’t a beauty but hey you’re all right, and that’s alright with me.” 
must have won Bruce a million women’s hearts when they heard it. “Jungle
 Land” is that treasured occurrence of an artists’ talent and vision and
 application all converging together to the desired affect. It conveys 
the wild and urgent expectation of Saturday Night that the adolescent 
feel, anchored by the knowledge of the cost of risk, whether that risk 
be romantic or illegal, one must still pay. It traverses the arc from 
celebration to tragedy. Bruce displays that most welcome of gifts in a 
song writer in it; knowing when to whisper and knowing when to roar.<br>
<br>
He is the most inclusive of singers, and is immediately recognizable. 
One always feels welcome in a Springsteen song. And if the terrain seems
 a bit strange he provides enough information for you to orient 
yourself. He is also fearless in a song, willing to dance with his 
demons in full view and to sometimes take on the demons of others. On 
the title track of Nebraska he channels the unrepentant and horrific 
psyche of mass murderer Charles Starkweather. The song is worked to 
eerie affect by the stark bleakness of Springsteen’s’ voice and 
harmonica, Bruce uttering the last line of “I guess there's just a 
meanness in this world”. as if he were talking about the weather both 
puzzles and chills us, again amazed at the utter banality of evil. 
Balance that against the ragged desperation which is his voice on the 
title track of Darkness On The Edge of Town where he sings….<br>
<br>
Tonight I’ll be on that hill ‘cause I just can’t stop,<br>
I’ll be on that hill with everything I got,<br>
Lives on the line<br>
Where dreams are lost and found,<br>
I’ll be there on time and I’ll pay the cost,<br>
For wanting things that can only be found…<br>
In the darkness on the edge of town,<br>
In the darkness on the edge of town.<br>
<br>
He is willing to go there with us because he knows his demons are not 
much different than ours. Any artist that spends much time communing 
with the ghosts in his own soul knows that.  A great artist knows that 
the true riches lie only in embracing all aspects of themselves, that 
the only way through is to risk. That is why Springsteen is such a 
revelatory singer, he is not afraid of that journey.<br>
<br>
He began, and continues, as a story teller. He is also deeply invested 
in the mythology of America, not in any jingoistic, flag waving sense 
but in the basic ethos of Steinbeck and Guthrie, that one is a decent 
person and that the guy next to you is a decent person and with that 
understood we can get on with the business of living. He often 
references The Promised Land in his work, not with irony or detachment 
but with it being a real place, more in the soul than in any 
geographical sense. He does not speak of it as an idealistic dream but 
as a place of realistic hope. Lately his muse has been unsure of it, 
that it is getting harder to see and believe in. But he never breaks 
stride and gives way to decadence or despair. When the people who 
inhabit his songs strive for the heroic it is always life sized and 
believable. He knows that we must each reach, or not reach, the Promised
 Land in our own way.  What makes him so believable as a song writer is 
his confidence that he, also, is a decent man, well aware of his 
limitations but still a man to be trusted. One of the things that grants
 him such creditability is that he has never aligned himself with any 
political agenda, although he is drifting perilously close to that 
territory in his relationship with Obama. Somewhere in Rilke’s Letters 
To A Young Poet there must be the warning “the artist should keep 
himself far from the seats of power”. But he remains his own man, 
trusting in his inner compass to keep him true.<br>
<br>
Some musicians blossom onstage, some in the recording studio. 
Springsteen for the most part has been quite successful in both. His 
live performances are legend, seemingly not dulled by age or 
familiarity. There are those among his bedrock fans who report they have
 seen him dozens, even hundreds, of times. I have been a witness and he 
was extraordinary.  His recorded catalog is equally impressive, though 
presently it may be depending more on past glories than current 
triumphs. But if one is only passingly familiar with his work it is 
always worth while to go prospecting about for surprises from him on 
YouTube, there are many gems to be found.  Bruce is rather conservative 
in the studio; he doesn’t indulge in wild experimentation for its own 
sake.  This doesn’t mean that he lacks curiosity, simply that he knows 
which tools work best for him and doesn’t need to go looking for new 
ones.  He does have a signature “sound” with E Street, but that may 
change with the absence of “The Big Man”, Clarence Clemmons. Thankfully 
he doesn’t muck about with his voice much, going for a natural sound.  
Springsteen does like to tinker with his songs in concert, revealing him
 for what he is at heart, a frustrated mechanic. Does ANYONE, except for
 the Beach Boys, have as many songs about cars?  Nine times out of ten 
it is to the songs’ benefit.  Usually a change in tempo or key, which 
shows that he desires a certain fluidity in his live shows in order to 
keep them fresh.  He does not rearrange with the abandon that Dylan 
does, providing enough landmarks so one is still able to recognize the 
song.<br>
<br>
Springsteen remains fundamental because he has never confused having 
fame with having purpose.  He has gracefully journeyed into middle age 
with his eyes on the horizon of the present, not cast wistfully back 
toward the past.  It is unlikely that we will devolve into self-parody 
and become irrelevant.  What is probable is that as time has its’ way 
with his voice and his body he will edge away from the anthemic 
celebrations that are such a huge part of his live shows with E street 
and spend more time crafting the kind of haunting and compelling ballads
 that give works like Nebraska and The Ghost of Tom Joad their heft and 
gravis.  He still offers a sense of camaraderie and inclusion in his 
music that few other artists provide. He is definitely one to watch and 
no doubt he will still have a few surprises for us down the road.<br>
<br>
Whenever and however one first comes to hear Tom Waits, their immediate 
thought will most likely be “I have never heard anything like that 
before.” It is likely that this thought will occur almost on a visceral 
level, Waits is a very visceral artist. It does not matter if one is 
hearing one of his almost assaultive, lurching, dissonant, kinetic 
safaris into the jungle of auditory possibility or one of his stardust 
covered, heartfelt, hand made ballads, soaked in pathos and whiskey, 
there will be no easy category to assist the listener. Tom does not 
domesticate well. To say he is original is to trifle, he is primal, 
bypassing the normal constructs of how one hears music and going 
straight into the bone. He is one of those artists that people either 
love or that they hate, there is little room for indifference when it 
comes to him. To say that he is an acquired taste is not being truthful.
 He is an immediate taste, pro or con.  This may limit his audience, but
 it also affords him the conviction to create with a freedom that is 
almost savage.<br>
<br>
He does not pander, he commits totally to the music and takes risks that
 seem reckless at the time but that repay with abundance later on down 
the line.  Part of his appeal, or, depending on who you ask, part of his
 lack of it, is his voice. It is central to everything that he does 
musically. It is an instrument in its own right. Actually one should say
 “voices” since when he sings it seems he has several.  There is The 
Terrible Pirate, which sounds like a cross between Captain Ahab and 
God’s bookie. If you could feel a voice this one would feel like shark 
skin, it is that deep and gruff and jagged. There is Bar Room Tommy, a 
somewhat less gravelly baritone that is quite versatile, the Waltzing 
Lover, a warm, husky alto that best handles Waits’ plaintive sawdust and
 gossamer ballads, and, the most intimidating and puzzling of all, his 
“Howlin’ Wolf” voice.  When he invokes this Delta swamp infused hoodoo 
man growl of a vocal it sounds as if The Wolf is THERE, strutting with 
Tom in full chain gang gloriana, that heart beat anvil clang chorus 
bearing witness. It is not an act of mimicry. Where ever Waits pulls 
that voice up from it is some where so dangerous and dark that even 
Robert Johnson would be reluctant to visit.<br>
<br>
His music is informed by: Americana, New Orleans blues, Tin Pan Alley, 
cabaret, jazz, saloon singers, Beat poetry, country, medicine shows, 
rockabilly, big band, carnival barkers, minstrel shows, hobo songs, 
circus calliopes, and who knows how many other roots buried deep in the 
fertile swamp that is his muse.  He takes it all in and somehow morphs 
it into something that is uniquely his own.  It sounds effortlessly 
ancient and immediate all at once.There would be the expectation that 
with so many voices speaking to him his music would feel cluttered, but 
it rarely does. He really does practice the virtue that less is more. He
 is the true prophet of minimalism. Tom often works with simply a piano 
or a guitar or just his voice. His songs feel stripped down but never 
gaunt, he has that uncanny gift for knowing exactly how durable or 
delicate they need to be. He takes a craftsman’s pride in them.<br>
<br>
When he does invite other instruments in it is always for a reason, not 
to fill up the space, he is not afraid of space. He can also write the 
saddest songs in the world, rock bottom ballads that are peopled by 
broken hearts and broken dreams. Like all true romantics, he knows more 
about goodbyes than he does hellos. But even at his most despondent he 
rarely comes in search of pity.  He wants to lick his wounds, have a 
drink and tell his story but he shuns the maudlin. One would think such 
naked grief would be depressing, but in the oddest way, it is not. In 
truth hearing him embrace his pain so deeply heartens one. Perhaps it is
 the camaraderie of the fallen, the knowledge that someone else has been
 there and survived. As someone once said “survival is success”, 
something that only those who have walked the black dog can fully 
understand. That is the feeling that Waits communicates, that he is a 
survivor. One does not detect the corrosive water of bitterness in him. 
 For all his bleak ruminations he is not tainted by nihilism. He has 
room in his garden for some balanced hope. This is heard to touching 
effect on his ballad, “You Can’t Hold Back Spring”  a lovely, buoyant 
(but not sugar laced) miracle that is a simple affirmation that life 
continues on, and you can join in if  you wish. You can hear Louie 
Armstrong’s’ finger prints all over it and Tom tipping his hat to him as
 he sings.<br>
<br>
Sometimes a man needs to know that he can endure failure as well as he 
can success. There is a fierceness in Waits that only comes with the 
knowledge that not only is defeat not fatal, it is probably welcome at 
times. He can be a beast when he is in pursuit of the unknown in his 
music, stalking with that confident primacy that only those who have 
defied their limitations have.  That is where the menace in his music 
comes from, and the menace is as important as the beauty. To hear him in
 full predator mode, take your chances with “Starvin’ In The Belly Of A 
Whale”, a swirling, alarming, blazing maelstrom of a song which sounds 
deceptively out of control. Waits growls as if his voice is dancing a 
jig, so rakishly gleeful it is. The music is jaunty, but skeletal.  The 
feeling is as if one is dancing around and around in ever expanding 
circles and unable to stop, like some macabre witches ball gone mad with
 Tom at the center, barking out the lyrics and fiddling away. There are 
bells chiming in the mix, bells and horns and a surging harmonica 
fueling the intensity. Somehow all the disparate noise distills 
strangely into some kind of unity that you know Waits has orchestrated. 
It leaves one feeling oddly satisfied, as if you had just witnessed an 
act of magic. It is obvious that the entire thing could has collapsed 
into screeching dissonance in the hands of one less comfortable with 
chaos than Tom.  It is this implicit trust in the music that enables him
 to take such leaps.<br>
<br>
To say that his music is “weird” at times would be a fair assessment.  
His is not the weirdness for weirdness’s sake of Captain Beefheart and 
Zappa, nor is it the shrill, exploratory weirdness of free form jazz. He
 isn’t banging things with a hammer to see how they sound. An artist 
reverting to weirdness is often demonstrating a poverty of ideas, which 
is not Tom’s problem.  Tom has a vision of what he wants and he is not 
afraid to go to the Wilderness to find it.  He likes to work without a 
net, however harrowing that may be to the listener.  He is not afraid to
 be selfish now to bring forth greater rewards later.  Admittedly, some 
of his more undisciplined ramblings presume upon ones’ patience.  Being 
in the fire with Tom can prove uncomfortable and even a little 
frightening.  Sometimes his more dissonant exercises feel as if they are
 simply something he wants to get off of his chest, but once his 
curiosity is satisfied he rarely returns to them. Fortunately his 
catalog is so rich and varied one can easily avoid that which is not to 
ones taste and find much else to enjoy.  That being said, a sense of 
adventure concerning his music that one has not heard can bring many 
unexpected surprises, and unearth a few things that just puzzle the hell
 out of one.<br>
<br>
His latest offering, Bad As Me, which was released in 2011, is his first
 album of entirely  unreleased original material in seven years.  On it 
he sounds as gruff, courageous, idiosyncratic, mischievous and lively as
 ever. There are wild and gleeful romps, pensive introspections, heart 
break ballads and even a risky foray into jagged white noise which at 
first repels, then compels and finally triumphs on sheer, savage energy 
alone. Not recommended for daily consumption but wonderfully bracing at 
the right time. The album is neither ground breaking or any kind of an 
attempt to revisit past glories for Waits. It shows him at full stride 
and moving, in total control and application of his many gifts. And it 
sounds as if he is having as much fun as ever, perhaps even more. It can
 stand as well as anything he has done as a testament to the range of 
his vision and ability. It makes one curious as to where he will go 
next. It is unlikely that he will ever stop taking chances, and that is 
good news for us. It is possible that those risks maybe a little more 
within the lines than they are now, but who knows with Waits, he likes 
surprising himself best of all. He may do an album of him doing nothing 
more than telling stories in spoken word; he loves to tell stories, and 
rarely confuses the Facts with the Truth.  There is a funny story he 
likes to tell on himself. It seems he overheard his older children 
talking to his younger boy advising him to never EVER ask Tom to help 
him with his home work. It seems Mister Waits took poetic license and 
simply MADE UP a war once. His flamboyant imagination is forever 
abundant. I pay him my highest compliment. He is a constant joy and 
tonic to me. He is like friendship and money, showing up in the most 
unexpected places. Is Tom Waits essential?  My vote is yes, but, as with
 all things concerning Tom, it depends on who you ask.</div>

<br>
by Stephen Klugewicz<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
In 1989, the year before his death, the great Southern novelist Walker 
Percy wrote a letter to rock-and-roll legend Bruce Springsteen, which 
reads, in part:<br>
<br>
This is a fan letter—of sorts. I’ve always been an admirer of yours, for
 your musicianship, and for being one of the few sane guys in your 
field. Of particular interest is from learning that you are Catholic. If
 this is true, and I am too, it would appear that the two of us are 
rarities in our professions: you as a post-modern musician, I as a 
writer, a novelist and philosopher. That—and your admiration for 
Flannery O’Connor.<br>
This is to say only that I am most interested in your spiritual journey,
 and if there is any other material about it, I’d be obliged if you will
 tell me.<br>
Percy was battling cancer as he wrote, and Springsteen did not respond 
until 1993, after Percy had succumbed, writing back to his widow about 
the missive her husband had sent:<br>
<br>
It was a passionate letter about the comforts and difficulties of 
reconciling the inner life of a sophisticated man, a writer’s life, with
 the Catholic faith. I recall Dr. Percy’s explaining how one had brought
 depth and meaning to the other for him. He was curious to know how I 
handled my issues of faith.<br>
It is now one of my great regrets that we didn’t get to correspond. A 
while after receiving Dr. Percy’s letter, I picked up The Moviegoer, its
 toughness and beauty have stayed with me. The loss and search for faith
 and meaning have been at the core of my own work for most of my adult 
life. I’d like to think that perhaps that is what Dr. Percy heard and 
was what moved him to write me. Those issues are still what motivate me 
to sit down, pick up my guitar and write. Today, I would have had a lot 
to put in that letter.<br>
<br>
If Walker Percy had lived long enough to get to know Springsteen better,
 he might have been disappointed to learn that the rocker had long 
before given up the formal practice of his faith. Though raised by two 
devoutly Catholic parents, Springsteen recalls that he “quit the stuff 
when I was in eighth grade.” To this day, he still harbors some degree 
of animosity toward the Catholic Church, its teachings, and the 
religious formation—“brainwashing” he derisively calls it—that it gave 
him.<br>
<br>
But much of this rejection is not so much intellectual as personal. 
Springsteen’s animosity toward the Church seems to stem primarily from 
his rejection of its teachings on sexuality. Though known along the 
Jersey Shore in his teens and early twenties for his almost unique 
refusal to drink alcohol, do drugs, and curse, Springsteen nevertheless 
partook in the sexual freedom that the 1960s afforded Americans. Even as
 a boy of nine, he was fascinated by Elvis Presley’s sexually-charged 
appearances in the late 1950s on The Ed Sullivan Show. “Elvis screamed 
freedom. He was a precursor of the sexual revolution,” Springsteen told 
60 Minutes Australia. “He was the first twentieth-century man in my 
mind. That read like the future. So, how do I get a piece of that 
freedom, of that sexual energy, of that much fun.”<br>
<br>
Despite his misgivings about the Church in which he was reared, 
Springsteen’s opus is drenched in the theology and rituals of 
Catholicism. In recent years he has even taken to adorning himself with 
the outer symbols of Catholicism, such as the Miraculous and St. 
Christopher medals. More significantly, he has begun to acknowledge, and
 only half-grudgingly, the indelible mark imprinted upon his psyche and 
soul by his Catholic upbringing. “Once a Catholic, always a Catholic,” 
he has repeatedly said. “It’s like Al Pacino, I keep trying to get out, 
they keep pulling me back!” He recalls that the nuns and priests at St. 
Rose of Lima parish in Freehold, New Jersey gave him a vivid sense of 
the realities of Heaven and Hell—perhaps another example of 
“brainwashing,” but, Springsteen concludes, “because I ended up a writer
 and because I ended up this kind of writer, I wouldn’t trade it.”<br>
<br>
One would hardly have predicted that the Springsteen family would 
produce a writer of any kind. Parents Douglas and Adele had only a 
rudimentary education, worked blue-collar jobs, and were uninterested in
 the life of the mind. “I didn’t grow up in a community of ideas,” 
Springsteen recalls, “a place where you can sit down and talk about 
books, and how you read through them, and how they affect you.” After 
high school, Springsteen attended only one year of community college 
before dedicating himself entirely to a career in music. “I’d missed out
 on the world of ideas that comes with a real college education,” 
Springsteen told biographer Peter Ames Carlin, “but I was really drawn 
to people who knew how to use words or knew how to express their ideas. I
 thought, ‘There’s a connection there with what I’m doing.’ The life of 
the mind is just as important as the life of the body.”<br>
<br>
Despite the lack of a higher education, Springsteen’s vocabulary, 
breadth of knowledge about literature, politics, and the arts, and 
ability to discuss ideas are impressive. In conversation, he employs 
words like “Sisyphean,” references the work of Czech poet-president 
Vaclav Havel, and discusses sophisticated themes like alienation that 
modernity has fostered. This erudition can be attributed to the serious 
reading he began to do in the mid-1970s. “The really important reading 
that I did began in my late twenties,” Springsteen told Walker Percy’s 
nephew, Will, “with authors like Flannery O’Connor. There was something 
in those stories of hers that I felt captured a certain part of the 
American character that I was interested in writing about. They were a 
big, big revelation.”<br>
<br>
Other revelations came from the novels of Percy and John Steinbeck, 
particularly the latter’s The Grapes of Wrath. Springsteen identified 
immediately with the themes of alienation, hardship, displacement, and 
the iniquities of capitalism in Steinbeck’s work. A product of a 
working-class family, Springsteen has written about these themes easily 
and frequently. In “Downbound Train,” from the album Born in the U.S.A. 
(1984), for example, the narrator says:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">I had a job, I had a girl<br>
I had something going mister in this world<br>
I got laid off down at the lumber yard<br>
Our love went bad, times got hard<br>
Now I work down at the carwash<br>
Where all it ever does is rain<br>
Don’t you feel like you’re a rider on a downbound train</em><br>
<br>
And in unused verse written for the hit song “Glory Days” on the same album, the speaker says:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">My old man worked twenty years on the line,<br>
and they let him go.<br>
Now everywhere he goes out looking for work,<br>
they just tell him that he’s too old.<br>
I was nine years old and he was working at the Metuchen Fordplant assembly line,<br>
Now he just sits down on a stool down at the Legion Hall,<br>
But I can tell what’s on his mind.</em><br>
<br>
But Springsteen’s writing goes deeper than the “I lost my job and my 
girl” theme so central to, say, country music (another influence on 
Springsteen). Springsteen shared with Walker Percy the idea that God and
 his purposes were at heart inscrutable. Sometimes, such themes are 
mistaken for nihilism in Springsteen’s music. In “Reason to Believe,” 
part of his dark and haunting solo acoustic album Nebraska (1982), the 
narrator speaks of lovers’ promises betrayed, the seeming finality of 
death, and the riddle of new life. “Lord won’t you tell us tell us what 
does it mean,” the narrator asks, but then observes: “Still at the end 
of every hard earned day people find some reason to believe.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen identified with Percy’s protagonist in The Moviegoer in his 
quest for spiritual redemption and in his need to define himself in 
relation to the people and places around him. Like the young 
Springsteen, the protagonist was a loner, isolated from others, finding 
more meaning in movies (or music in Springsteen’s case) than in 
conversation with others. It is this tension between the communal bonds 
of home and the individualistic freedom of the road that kindles much of
 Springsteen’s writing, perhaps no more clearly than in the songs of his
 breakthrough album, Born to Run (1975). In “Thunder Road,” the 
protagonist orders his girlfriend to climb in his car: “It’s a town full
 of losers, and we’re pulling out of here to win.” In the album’s title 
song, the narrator similarly implores his girlfriend:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Baby this town rips the bones from your back<br>
Its a death trap, it’s a suicide rap<br>
We gotta get out while were young<br>
`cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run<br>
Just wrap your legs round these velvet rims<br>
And strap your hands across my engines<br>
Together we could break this trap<br>
Well run till we drop, baby well never go back</em><br>
<br>
Yet less than a decade later, on the album that propelled him to 
superstardom, Born in the U.S.A., Springsteen spoke nostalgically of “My
 Hometown,” the speaker recalling his father driving him through the 
main street, trying to instill in his son a love for their modest 
working-class town. Now a father himself, the narrator takes part in the
 same ritual, even as he contemplates finding another job elsewhere 
because of the economic decay that has beset the city:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Last night me and Kate we laid in bed<br>
Talking about getting out<br>
Packing up our bags maybe heading south<br>
I’m thirty-five we got a boy of our own now<br>
Last night I sat him up behind the wheel<br>
And said son take a good look around<br>
This is your hometown</em><br>
<br>
In an interview accompanying the release of his latest album, Wrecking 
Ball (2012), Springsteen speaks of the importance of work to the 
individual’s sense of belonging. “People have to work. It’s the single 
thing that brings self and self-esteem and a sense of place, a sense of 
belonging.” In Wrecking Ball’s bitter “Death to My Hometown,” the 
narrator lashes out at the “robber barons” who “destroyed our families’ 
factories” and “took our homes.” This is Percy mixed with Steinbeck: The
 injustices of capitalism rob the individual not only of his economic 
security but also, by destroying his community, of his very ability to 
locate himself geographically and spiritually. His very identity is 
destroyed.<br>
<br>
Flannery O’Connor’s influence pervades especially the albums Darkness on
 the Edge of Town (1978) and Nebraska (1982), both of which Springsteen 
wrote in the wake of reading her short stories. These albums reflect the
 meditations on original sin that form the core of the Southern Gothic’s
 opus. As Springsteen put it to Will Percy:<br>
<br>
She got to the heart of some part of meanness that she never spelled 
out, because if she spelled it out you wouldn’t be getting it. It was 
always at the core of every one of her stories–the way that she’d left 
that hole there, that hole that’s inside of everybody. There was some 
dark thing—a component of spirituality—that I sensed in her stories, and
 that set me off exploring characters of my own. She knew original 
sin—knew how to give it the flesh of a story. She had talent and she had
 ideas, and the one served the other.<br>
<br>
In O’Connor’s “A Good Man is Hard to Find” (the title of which 
Springsteen borrowed for the title of a song), the character of the 
Misfit refers to evil/sin as “meanness,” a term that Springsteen uses in
 the title track of Nebraska. The song “Nebraska” is based on the true 
crime story of eighteen-year-old Charles Starkweather, who, with a 
girlfriend four years his junior, went on a killing spree in the late 
1950s in Nebraska and Wyoming. The speaker is caught and tried for his 
crimes, and judgment is handed down. The song concludes thusly:<br>
<br>
They declared me unfit to live<br>
Said into that great void my soul’d be hurled<br>
They wanted to know why I did what I did<br>
Well sir I guess there’s just a meanness in this world<br>
Springsteen’s characters often battle inner demons they cannot 
understand. In “Cautious Man” from The Tunnel of Love album (1987), the 
narrator struggles with the temptations of infidelity to his bride:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Now Billy was an honest man he wanted to do what was right<br>
He worked hard to fill their lives with happy days and loving night<br>
Alone on his knees in the darkness for steadiness he’d pray<br>
For he knew in a restless heart the seed of betrayal lay</em><br>
<br>
The issue of temptation permeates Springsteen’s songs, particularly 
those on Tunnel of Love and The River (1980). In “Stolen Car” from the 
latter album, the speaker tells of the something he cannot name that 
drove a wedge between him and his wife:<br>
<br>
I met a little girl and I settled down<br>
In a little house out on the edge of town<br>
We got married, and swore we’d never part<br>
Then little by little we drifted from each other’s heart<br>
At first I thought it was just restlessness<br>
That would fade as time went by and our love grew deep<br>
In the end it was something more I guess<br>
That tore us apart and made us weep<br>
<br>
The “something more” is clearly original sin, a theme that reoccurs 
often in Springsteen’s work. In “Wages of Sin” from Tracks (1998), the 
narrator speaks of “the wages of sin, I keep paying/Wages of sin for 
some wrong that I’ve done.” On the same album, the protagonist of “Part 
Man, Part Monkey” asks, “Did God make man in a breath of holy fire/Or 
did he crawl on up out of the muck and mire.” The narrator of Nebraska’s
 “My Father’s House” tries to run to that house (Heaven) “with the Devil
 snappin ‘ at my heels,” but ends up leaving his sins “unatoned.” In 
“Adam Raised a Cain” from Darkness on the Edge of Town, the speaker 
cries out:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">In the Bible Cain slew Abel<br>
And East of Eden he was cast,<br>
You’re born into this life paying,<br>
for the sins of somebody else’s past,<br>
Daddy worked his whole life, for nothing but the pain,<br>
Now he walks these empty rooms, looking for something to blame,<br>
You inherit the sins, you inherit the flames,<br>
Adam raised a Cain</em><br>
<br>
But if original sin lies at the heart of Springsteen’s work, redemption 
lurks out there somewhere too. It is this element—often veiled in his 
lyrics—that raises Springsteen’s work above mere nihilism. On The Rising
 (2002), the narrator of “Waitin’ on a Sunny Day” is doing just that; in
 “Badlands” from Darkness on the Edge of Town, the protagonist proclaims
 that “Well keep pushin till it’s understood/And these badlands start 
treating us good”; on Lucky Town (1992), the speaker keeps “searching 
for his beautiful reward.”<br>
<br>
If anything, Springsteen’s songs have become more overtly religious over
 the last decade (and his concerts have become even more like religious 
revivals with the preacher-like Springsteen donning garments). 
Scriptural references, for example, fill Wrecking Ball’s “Rocky Ground”:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Forty days and nights of rain have washed this land<br>
Jesus said the money changers in this temple will not stand<br>
Find your flock, get them to higher ground<br>
Flood waters rising and we’re Caanan bound<br>
Tend to your flock or they will stray<br>
We’ll be called for our service come Judgment Day<br>
Before we cross that river wide<br>
Blood on our hands will come back on us twice</em><br>
<br>
Sometimes, Springsteen’s religious imagery is masked by a more 
sophisticated treatment. The reoccurrence of female characters named 
“Mary,” for instance, hardly seems coincidental in the Catholic 
Springsteen’s writing. Mary is the Queen of Arkansas on his debut album,
 Greetings from Asbury Park (1973); she is the girl who is going to pull
 out of town to win in Born to Run’s “Thunder Road”; and she appears 
twice on The Rising, as a girlfriend in the title song and as the 
hostess of the party in “Mary’s Place.” It is in this last two songs 
that Springsteen draws on the Christian tradition of using the imagery 
of romantic/sexual love to express divine love—a practice that stretches
 from the Bible’s “Song of Songs” to the theological notion that 
conjugal love reflects the love of the Trinity to the Catholic 
interpretation that the Church is the Bride of Christ. In “The Rising,” 
Mary appears as the beloved girlfriend but also as the one who brings 
life to the narrator, a sort of new Eve:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">I see you Mary in the garden<br>
In the garden of a thousand sighs<br>
There’s holy pictures of our children<br>
Dancin’ in a sky filled with light<br>
May I feel your arms around me<br>
May I feel your blood mix with mine<br>
A dream of life comes to me<br>
Like a catfish dancin’ on the end of the line</em><br>
<br>
Similarly, the Mary of “Mary’s Place” may actually be the hostess not 
only of a rock-and-roll party but also of a Heavenly banquet. One verse 
in particular seems to depict the locket that bears Mary’s image as the 
Miraculous Medal:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">I got a picture of you in my locket<br>
I keep it close to my heart<br>
A light shining in my breast<br>
Leading me through the dark</em><br>
<br>
It should be noted that for all the dark songs that Springsteen has 
produced, he has also written many that are just pure fun rock songs and
 that have no deeper philosophical meaning: “The E Street Shuffle,” 
“Tenth-Avenue Freeze-Out,” “Sherry Darling,” and “Out in the Street” are
 just a few of these. Yet is hard to imagine that Springsteen could have
 penned songs that celebrate life’s joys without also chronicling so 
powerfully its many sorrows in his music. A Catholic at heart, he 
intuitively understands that there is no feast without the fast, no 
light without darkness, and no redemption without sin. In Springsteen’s 
Gothic imagination, for some on this earth, their sins will lie 
unatoned, but for others, a beautiful reward is in store.</div>

<br>
"If you look at the zoning for Lakewood, it's gonna be Jersey City in the pines." - Jeff Tittel<br>
<br>
Sharon Ann Reeves, left, watches Minister Steven Brigham, center and 
David Jones put up a new tent for her which was bought with donated 
money. <br>
Aristide Economopoulos/The Star-Ledger In the summer of 1972, Bruce 
Springsteen recorded a song titled "Spirit in the Night" (see video 
below). It told the story of an evening spent drinking and 
skinny-dipping at a place "out on the dark side of Route 88" called 
Greasy Lake.<br>
<br>
That was what the locals used to call what is now the centerpiece of 
Lake Shenandoah County Park in Lakewood. The reason for the name was the
 sheen the lake acquired from the pine tar from the trees surrounding 
it. <br>
<br>
The lake is no longer the sort of place where kids can party in the 
pines. But it’s a great place to go for a run. Every few months I load 
my dog Betty into the wagon and we head out that way.<br>
<br>
On every trip, it seems, I see a new townhouse complex under 
construction. No sooner does one fill up then another one appears. 
Lakewood’s also got lots of older public-housing projects. There are 
plenty of old houses as well.<br>
<br>
Housing, housing everywhere. So why are people living in tents?<br>
<br>
That question’s been in the news ever since township officials began an 
effort to shut down an encampment in a patch of piney woods just a bit 
south of that lake. It’s known as "tent city" and it’s home to more than
 a hundred people often labeled as "homeless."<br>
<br>
Actually, they’re not homeless. Most have homes of some sort. Some live 
in trailers. Others have cobbled together makeshift shelters using 
2-by-4s, plywood and plastic sheeting. <br>
<br>
I dropped by one day last week to talk to some of the campers. One of 
them was an African-American guy who gave his name only as Clarence. He 
told me a story that could have come out of a Springsteen song. He was 
born in Lakewood and grew up there. He lost his house in the recession 
and now this was the only place in town he could afford. <br>
<br>
Life isn’t so bad, he said. Volunteers keep the campers fed during the 
day and fires keep them warm at night. He just wants to be left alone by
 the officials of the only town he’s ever known. <br>
<br>
As an old Ocean County local, I could see his point. When I was a lad, 
there were plenty of people living in the pines. I suspect that 
reference in the Springsteen song to "Gypsy angel row" may have been 
inspired by a Gypsy camp in Jackson back then.<br>
<br>
These days, Jackson’s swallowed up in suburban sprawl, as is much of 
northern Ocean County. Will these woods soon be swallowed up as well? <br>
<br>
That’s what this whole big fight is about, says Steve Brigham. Brigham, 
53, is the minister who runs the Lakewood camp and is tangling with the 
town over its closure. Brigham charges that the town, which owns the 
land off busy Cedarbridge Avenue, wants the campers to leave so it can 
be developed.<br>
<br>
"They say the population of Lakewood is going to double in the next 10 
years," said Brigham. "If that’s the case, they’re gonna need every 
available space to build on."<br>
<br>
That statement would seem to be supported by the minutes of the 
executive session of the Aug. 22 township committee meeting, which cite 
the attorney who’s representing the township in the fight with the 
campers: "Lawrence Bathgate Esquire updated the committee on the 
Cedarbridge trial. Mr. Bathgate advised the committee there is an 
outside developer interested in purchasing the Cedarbridge property."<br>
<br>
That sounds like those pines will soon be paved over. <br>
But when I got Mayor Albert Akerman on the phone, he said the reference was to a different section of Cedarbridge Avenue. <br>
<br>
"The area that tent city is on will never ever be built on," said Akerman. "It can’t. It’s wetland and swamp."<br>
<br>
Akerman said the township sympathizes with the campers and has agreed to
 find them housing. Eventually everyone will be moved out and the camp 
closed, he said.<br>
Jeff Tittel of the New Jersey Chapter of the Sierra Club agrees with Brigham on what is likely to happen at that point. <br>
<br>
"This land will eventually be turned into high-density housing," said 
Tittel. "If you look at the zoning for Lakewood, it’s gonna be Jersey 
City in the pines."<br>
On that point, the mayor did not disagree. Akerman said a planner told 
the town that it could accommodate 100,000 residents added to the 
current population, which is almost 100,000. At that point, Lakewood’s 
population density would be similar to Jersey City’s.<br>
Why all the growth? Because Lakewood is becoming the center of Hasidic 
Judaism. It’s attracting Orthodox Jews from all over the world and they 
now dominate the town’s politics. <br>
<br>
"They vote as a bloc and they get what they want," said Tittel, who is himself Jewish. <br>
That was certainly the case in the special election for U.S. Senate held
 Oct. 16. One voting district went for Republican Steve Lonegan by an 
amazing 413-2 margin. Those Hudson County-like vote totals will soon 
lead to Hudson County-like densities, said Tittel, with much of the 
development subsidized by public funds intended for low-income tenants. <br>
<br>
"They’re playing games down there on water and sewer because of the 
power of the politics," he said. "But the runoff and pollution are going
 to have a devastating impact on Barnegat Bay."<br>
<br>
All those extra cars on the road will mean lots more oil going down the 
storm drains, he said. That means Lake Shenandoah will soon be greasy 
again — this time from motor oil. <br>
Tittel recommends that the township turn over that property to the county for inclusion in the adjacent park.<br>
<br>
"Maybe they could make it a public campsite," he suggested.<br>
<br>
Sounds good to me. I’ll call up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe and see what they think.</div>

   <br>
Recently we decided to collaborate on an essay about Bruce Springsteen 
for this issue. What follows is our e-mail conversation about Bruce.<br>
Joe Sartelle and Steven Rubio<br>
<br>
Bad Actions<br>
Issue #9, November 1993<br>
<br>
AUTHORS' NOTE: Recently we decided to collaborate on an essay about 
Bruce Springsteen for this issue. What follows is our E-mail 
conversation about Bruce, 'recorded' over a period of about three weeks 
in October. In the great tradition of live rock and roll albums, we 
spent many hours in the studio, editing our comments to make them 
'right,' but we hope the spontaneity of our online performance survives 
the editing process, and we invite you to have 'bad conversations' of 
your own — and share them with Bad Subjects.<br>
<br>
JOE<br>
<br>
The first and only Springsteen concert I attended was in 1978, during 
his tour in support of Darkness on the Edge of Town. I was fifteen and 
living in Houston, and while I was a frequent concert-goer, Springsteen 
was something 'special,' a big deal in the way that other concerts were 
not. Partly this was because Springsteen had not toured in several years
 due to the legal hassles that had delayed the release of Darkness, but 
it was also due to already well-established reputation as The Greatest 
Rock and Roll Performer Of Our Times. A Springsteen concert promised 
three or four hours of the main attraction, with no warm up band. I got 
what I wanted; it was one of the most memorable shows I ever attended, 
even though we had lousy seats to the side of the stage. In particular, I
 remember Springsteen's then-new version of 'Santa Claus is Coming to 
Town,' with thousands of Xmas lights adorning the stage facade, and the 
thrill of hearing a song that was available only in concert — a thrill 
experienced several times as Springsteen and the E-Street Band played 
two or three other new songs that turned up on The River two years 
later. I also remember the final encore, with all the lights on and 
everybody dancing like crazy in the aisles and on their seats.<br>
<br>
Indeed, when The River was released I had to have it so bad that, even 
though I was working for a record store, I went out and bought a copy 
from our competition, because our shipment hadn't arrived yet. I still 
have a polaroid of my 17 year-old self, looking very 1970s in long, 
feathered hair and a velour shirt, standing in Record Town checking out 
the new album's liner notes. But as much as I liked that album, 
Springsteen was by then just another rock star that I enjoyed listening 
to; I never became a die-hard Springsteen fan in any serious sense of 
the term. I've never even read Dave Marsh's classic biography, Born to 
Run. I have, however, continued to purchase and enjoy all of 
Springsteen's records up to the most recent, with the exception of the 
live album, which is where I drew the line at cash investment in his 
career.<br>
<br>
STEVEN<br>
<br>
The first time I saw Bruce Springsteen in concert was in October of 
1975. I was very sick the day of the show; as we parked our car in a lot
 next to the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, my wife handed me a bag and I
 began puking into it. She got out of the car, where she was immediately
 hit on by a guy asking if we had any extra tickets. Peering into the 
car where I was still barfing, she replied, 'I don't know, wait a 
second.' I wonder now why it was that, even before I had experienced 
Bruce live, I was already in obsessive fan mode: no way I was missing 
this concert! After the show, which was great, the greatest, the 
greatest of the greatest blah blah blah, I knew I would suffer through a
 lot more than a mere vomit attack to see Bruce in concert again.<br>
<br>
And see him again I did. Once in '76, three times in '78 (at one of 
which I touched Bruce on his boot, leading me to drive around for years 
with a bumpersticker on my car that read 'I Touched Bruce Springsteen'),
 five times in '80 (all in one week, in three cities: Portland, Oakland 
and Los Angeles), once at a Gary U.S. Bonds club date in the early 80s, 
once during the Born in the USA tour, twice at SuperStar benefit shows, 
once during the Tunnel of Love tour, and twice during the recent No More
 E Street Band Tour. And I'd go see him tomorrow if he was playing in 
the vicinity. For me, once was not enough.<br>
<br>
Why did I do this? Why do I continue to do this? It isn't just his 
music; I love it, but I can listen to his music at home. What is the 
concert experience offering me that keeps me coming back for more? And 
why Bruce, and not any of my many other faves? Are his concerts THAT 
good?<br>
<br>
My musical taste isn't exactly esoteric, and I don't shun the popular 
merely because it is popular. On the other hand, I think the Velvet 
Underground is the greatest rock and roll band of all time, which may 
not seem like much now, but they were most definitely esoteric in 1967 
when I was 14 years old and living in a white working-class Bay Area 
suburb and no one else was singing about Heroin. So I am not unduly 
impressed with the popular ... but ever since the first time I saw Bruce
 in concert, I wanted every single person I knew to experience him, as 
well. I wanted him to be the most popular musical artist in the world; I
 wanted to share him with everyone.<br>
<br>
And I still haven't explained what exactly it was about his concerts 
that made me such a fan/believer. Another anecdote: it's 1985, and Bruce
 is at the peak of his popularity, having finally won over virtually the
 entire music community (with the important exception of black fans ... 
Bruce was always very unfunky). I am sitting in rightfield at the 
Oakland Coliseum, part of a stadium-filling crowd of some 60,000. Bruce 
is on a stage in the centerfield bleachers. Most of the audience is 
watching him on one of the enormous video screens that have become de 
rigueur at such events. For some of his longtime fans, this concert tour
 of football stadiums is the ultimate expression of Bruce's downfall: 
too popular to play the small venues where he had shown so many of us so
 many good times, he was reduced to a tiny figure on a real stage, or a 
giant figure on a fake video.<br>
<br>
But when he played 'Glory Days,' the entire stadium was in heaven, 
dancing, singing along, rapturous smiles on our faces. Bruce Springsteen
 remains the only performer I have seen who could turn a football 
stadium into a corner bar. And it was the best damn corner bar in the 
world, because we had 60,000 of our closest friends with us.<br>
<br>
Rock and roll, especially as it has been interpreted by fans who grew up
 in the 1960s, is supposed to be about creating a massive community 
around 'our' music. The belief in a mass community is not a bad one; it 
has fueled more than a few prospective utopias. However, the reality of a
 mass utopia centered around a commodity like rock and roll music has 
become, over time, little more than a joke. Indeed, any remnants of a 
belief in such a possibility for music is often denigrated as the worst 
example of cheap 60s nostalgia. Lester Bangs understood what was 
happening to the mass rock and roll audience when he wrote, on the death
 of Elvis, 'We will never again agree on anything as we agreed on Elvis.
 So I won't bother saying good-bye to his corpse. I will say good-bye to
 you.'<br>
<br>
And then there was Bruce, about whom Greil Marcus wrote in a slightly 
different context, 'A concert by Bruce Springsteen offers many thrills, 
and one is that he performs as if none of the above is true.' In Bruce, 
we had community. Though Marcus later wrote, while musing over Bruce's 
megastardom, 'When Springsteen plays in a coliseum filled with sixty 
thousand people, what is at issue is not the size of the audience, but 
the intensity of its desire to be confirmed as an audience,' in fact I 
think Marcus' earlier quotation is still applicable, which is why I was 
so happy to share Bruce with all those 'Glory Days' fans at that 
coliseum. We did not want to be confirmed as an audience ... we wanted 
to be confirmed as a community.<br>
<br>
JOE<br>
<br>
I believe there's a certain amount of truth to the claim that 
Springsteen's concerts really are something special, that he is a 
charismatic showman and performer like no other that post-Elvis rock 
music has produced. There's no arguing with the way fans like yourself 
respond to Springsteen; I would just want to point out that he does not 
'work' in that way for everyone. For example, I am invested in Star Trek
 in much the same way that you are invested in Springsteen. However, I 
know that even though there are millions of Trek fans out there whose 
appreciation borders on a kind of worship (which is true on a lesser 
scale of the cult of Bruce, too), the idea that there is something 
intrinsic or essential to Star Trek that produces the investment falls 
apart when you consider the larger number of people for whom the show 
simply doesn't hold any special appeal. (As opposed to people who bash 
the show, or who like it but are ashamed to admit it — both of these 
groups clearly have some kind of investment going.)<br>
<br>
The desire to be recognized or confirmed as a 'community' and not just 
as an 'audience' is not peculiar to Springsteen fans; Trekkers gather 
together in mass at their conventions for similar reasons. However, as I
 argued in my essay 'As if We Were a Community' (Bad Subjects #1, 
September 1992), just because a mass gathering like a concert (or a Trek
 convention or a gay pride parade) makes us feel confirmed as a 
community doesn't mean that we in fact are a community. Rather, we are a
 market of consumers who have paid for a commodity (the live show), one 
of the pleasures of which is that it allows us, for a limited time, to 
feel like we're part of a big community. The feeling you describe is 
part of what we pay to consume, not a 'surplus pleasure' above and 
beyond the commodity of the performance itself. I note that Greil 
Marcus, in the quote you provide, does not go so far as to say that 
Springsteen actually overcomes the problem of a 'mass utopia centered 
around a commodity,' but only says that Springsteen 'performs as if none
 of the above is true.' Which, now that I think of it, is like saying 
that Springsteen is so compelling because, even if his performance is a 
kind of lie, at least he acts like he means it.<br>
<br>
And that suggests a way of understanding the connection between 
Springsteen and Ronald Reagan, which otherwise might be dismissed as 
merely historical: the fact that Springsteen reaches the peak of his 
popularity at exactly the same moment that Reagan reaches his, 1984-85, 
the moment of 'Morning in America' and 'Born in the USA.' Both 
performers are known for their capacity to convey the quality of 
'sincerity' in their performances of their 'authentic' selves; both 
achieved the greatest mass appeal by linking their personas to symbols 
of American patriotism. One might wish to protest that while Reagan was 
clearly a big manipulative fake, Springsteen is the genuine article, but
 I would point out that there are plenty of Reagan fans who would argue 
just the reverse. How you see the question of authenticity depends 
almost entirely on one's position as a consumer of either of these two 
public personalities: if you're inside the fan 'community,' he's 
sincere, but if you're outside, he's phony.<br>
<br>
I would also add that rock music fans, perhaps more so than any other 
popular culture audiences, are deeply invested in the distinction 
between the 'authentic' and the merely 'commercial,' despite the 
well-established fact that such distinctions are always breaking down. 
Thus we have the irritating but amusing case of 'alternative' music 
culture, which buys and sells its music just like any other market, 
while insisting in its routinely snotty way that because its music is 
more difficult and unpleasant to listen to, it is more 'authentic.' 
Hence the many pseudo-debates about a band like Nirvana, which has 
implicitly destroyed the whole mystique of 'alternative' music by 
becoming a mainstream phenomenon without sacrificing its dissonant sound
 and sneering attitude. Consider the ironies of a recent headline for a 
story in the entertainment section of the San Francisco Sunday paper: 
'Grunge Hits Pay Dirt: Anti-establishment postpunkers make big bucks in 
mainstream' (SF Chronicle 'Datebook,' October 24, 1993).<br>
<br>
The case of alternative music culture points up the basic problem in 
'communities' organized around taste preferences in popular culture: 
since it's all commercial culture, rooted in the buying and selling of 
commodities, there's not much more than attitude and self-assertion to 
distinguish one 'community' of fans from another in any absolute terms. I
 mean, what's the difference between the alternative music crowd versus 
the Springsteen crowd versus the country crowd versus the soul crowd 
(etc.) beyond the specifics of their taste preferences in music, 
fashion, and attitude? No wonder popular music has been the locus of so 
many theoretical and critical efforts to decode the 'meanings of style' 
and to emphasize what the music means to the fans themselves. Returning 
to a point made above: considered subjectively, all these various fan 
'communities' feel their own music and its culture is very, very 
different from the others; but considered objectively, they are all 
versions of the same thing, never sounding so much alike as when they 
are insisting upon their distinctiveness. From this perspective, the 
contempt for the mainstream which is so much a part of the alternative 
music scene is a measure of how hard it has to work to deny to itself 
how much it resembles what it claims to despise (in other words, no 
surprise here, what the alternative music fans really despise is 
themselves).<br>
<br>
And if this internal divisiveness is true of the audience for popular 
music generally, then it will also be true within specific fan 
audiences, such as the fifty thousand Springsteen fans who, according to
 you, Steven, all responded to 'Glory Days' just as you did... Or did 
they? That's the question I want to raise, using the case of 1984 and 
the popular reception of both the album and the single of 'Born in the 
USA.'<br>
<br>
It seems pretty clear that something happened to Springsteen with the 
release of that album and the explosion of his mass appeal that 
followed: the available meanings of his image and his music were altered
 forever (even for the fans who argue against such an idea). At the time
 the album came out, I still suffered from the knee-jerk 'popularity is 
always inauthentic' reflex common to the young, alienated and 
overeducated. Even though I really liked the music on the album, I 
became somewhat sniffy and disdainful as it turned Springsteen into that
 year's mega-star (or rather, the other one after Reagan himself). It 
didn't help that the song 'Born in the USA' (which I still think is one 
of the most powerful pieces he's ever done) was being received and 
appropriated by much of the public as a Reaganesque national anthem of 
born-again patriotism.<br>
<br>
But who's to say that people were wrong in doing so? While Springsteen 
fans might argue that a right-wing take on the song wasn't Springsteen's
 fault, since the song is 'really' a bitter reflection on how America 
has abused and neglected its Vietnam veterans, it's clear that the way 
in which the album and the artist were packaged tended to invite such 
'misreadings.' There's the American flag on the cover with Bruce in 
front (well, Bruce's butt, anyway): red, white, and blue-jeans. And then
 there's Springsteen himself, clean-shaven and newly experienced with 
Nautilus equipment. Gone is the scruffy and scrawny street poet, 
replaced by a wholesome, buff and all-American Bruce (OK, I admit it 
worked for me). The video for 'Dancing in the Dark' only reinforced the 
conservative implications of the packaging: Springsteen, who had 
hitherto made only 'artistic' videos in which he did not himself appear 
(for the 'artistically serious' and thus not much fun album Nebraska), 
was now being offered up as teen idol and fantasy heart-throb.<br>
<br>
Now, all I want to ask you, Steven, is the following: is this your 
Bruce? And if not, what do you do with the fans who got turned on to his
 music and performances because they responded to these 'misreadings' of
 Bruce's image? The very fact that Springsteen was trying so hard to be 
inclusive, to build a 'community' through his music that was as broad as
 possible, was in some sense the undoing of that 'community.' Because it
 isn't a community, but a market of consumers; the bond is that of the 
'cash nexus' (as Marx and Engels put it), not a shared history of common
 work and common goals. So why shouldn't the reception of 'Born in the 
USA' as fist-pumping celebration of vaguely fascistic American 
nationalism be just as legitimate a response as any other? Were the 
people who appropriated Springsteen's music in 'right-wing' ways also 
confirmed as part of the same community you felt yourself to be a part 
of?<br>
<br>
STEVEN<br>
<br>
First, I agree with Joe that my definition of 'my Bruce' is problematic,
 for precisely the reasons Joe mentions. There was a time when any one 
Bruce fan could somehow speak for ALL Bruce fans; we all had our 
personal experiences with Bruce, but part of being a Bruce fan was being
 a member of the shared history of the Bruce Fan Community. You knew you
 were safe letting another Bruce fan 'represent' all Bruce fans, and you
 knew any Bruce fan was a friend of any other Bruce fan. (Whether this 
was in actuality the case is irrelevant; the belief that it was the case
 is what matters.) With the mega-stardom of Born in the USA, though, the
 above assumptions could no longer be categorically true. Now, a Bruce 
fan could be, well, a 'non-Brucefan.' I can never remember, in any of 
the dozen Bruce concerts I saw in the pre-Born in the USA days, thinking
 about any of my fellow audience members that they were 'different' from
 me. But, beginning with the Born in the USA tour and continuing to this
 day, we 'Brucefans' regularly are confronted with fellow audience 
members who aren't 'really' Brucefans (they generally check out babes 
and wait for the opening chords of 'Born in the USA' before they get up 
in drunken glee to punch their fists in the air). And we are stuck with 
the problem endemic to all groups who wish to expand their horizons to 
include 'everyone': once confronted with 'everyone' we aren't so sure we
 want them in our group, after all.<br>
<br>
I also think Joe hits on something important in his references to 
authenticity and the Bruce Concert Experience. One surprise for many 
first-time Bruce concertgoers is how 'stagey' his show is; for some 
reason, the influence of West Side Story isn't as commonly stated in 
articles about Bruce as the influence of, say, Gary U.S. Bonds, and when
 people do mention West Side Story, it is primarily to note the 
similarity of early Bruce songs like 'Jungleland' to West Side Story in 
terms of subject matter and melodramatic musical appeal. But, as Dave 
Marsh once said, a Bruce concert is about as spontaneous as Pearl 
Harbor, and there is an almost Broadway feel to the manner in which 
Bruce uses lighting and music cues and his own considerable acting 
ability to, yes, 'manipulate' his audience. Why does such an obviously 
manipulative performer, then, inspire such a belief from his fans that 
Bruce is somehow more 'authentic' than other rockers?<br>
<br>
Partly, the audience seems to be celebrating the work ethic. No one 
works longer or harder in concert than Bruce, and he has regularly 
stated in interviews over his entire career that he feels he owes his 
fans every ounce of his energy and ability, every time he hits the 
stage. This might also explain why, even after Bruce made the Forbes 
list of highest-paid entertainers, his fans 'believed' in Bruce's 
solidarity with the working-class: he might be making $40 million a 
year, but he WORKED his butt off for that $40 million. In 1980, I saw 
Bruce five times in one week in three cities separated by a thousand 
miles; it was clear at the time that the best way to emulate my hero was
 to WORK hard at being the best fan I could possibly be.<br>
<br>
But, for those of us who have seen Bruce time and time again, there is 
also an appreciation of the familiarity of Bruce's routines that we 
respond to positively. Rarely, if ever, has Bruce Springsteen 
represented something new: Born To Run sounded like the history of music
 from 1954-1975 when it came out, and it still sounds like that history,
 but it most certainly does NOT sound like the 'future of rock and roll'
 circa 1975. There is nothing in Born To Run to suggest that the next 
two decades of popular music would include disco, punk, new wave, rap, 
hip hop, rave, and Garth Brooks. There is a built-in nostalgia factor in
 Born To Run; to give oneself to the world of Born to Run in 1975 was to
 feel a part, not only of the moment, but of history. We paradoxically 
remembered the music the very first time we heard it. Subsequent replays
 over the course of the past twenty years have added to that feeling of 
nostalgia. The familiarity we have with Bruce's music is part of what we
 like about it; again, it makes us feel like a community with a common 
history. Bruce becomes 'authentic' in this scenario, not because he is 
somehow more 'real' than other performers, but because ever since he 
first entered our consciousness, his 'inauthenticity' drew on the same 
'fake' cultural elements that we used in creating our own public and 
private personas. We share a fake culture. Bruce 'authentically' relies 
on this fake culture to inform his own art and, by extension, his own 
life. He uses the inauthentic in authentic ways. He 'believes in hope 
that can save.' His belief is authentic; when he performs for an 
audience, that belief (in the liberating possibilities of rock and roll)
 comes across in a very un-ironic way. In a cynical world, Bruce's 
belief in liberation is authentic.<br>
<br>
What remains is the question of how this un-ironic belief in himself and
 his art is any different from the similar belief of a Wayne Newton. 
Bruce fans believe that Bruce believes, but one imagines that the 
audience for Wayne Newton in Vegas believes the same about their hero.<br>
<br>
JOE<br>
<br>
Of course, this opens up the much more difficult problem of deciding 
which cultural texts and/or artists are 'really' authentic. Ultimately I
 think that the battles over cultural taste preferences — the need to 
feel that 'my pleasure is better than your pleasure' — are an enormous 
spectacle which serves to distract us from more fundamental political 
and social questions. Of course, popular culture is a great point of 
entry for engaging such questions, but what frustrates me about the way 
the debate is usually mounted, especially among fans themselves, is that
 the discussion seldom moves very far beyond the Beavis-and-Butthead 
paradigm of 'cool' versus 'sucks.' That is, most of what fans have to 
say, whether they are just ordinary folks or professional 'critics,' 
boils down to some version of the following: 'This is really great, 
authentic and meaningful because I get so much pleasure out of it; and 
since my pleasure seems authentic to me, the source of it must be, too. 
And if you don't feel the same way, then you have no right to criticize 
or judge.' Or people take the reverse position: 'I think this is stupid,
 boring, derivative crap, and anybody who likes it must be a moron.'<br>
<br>
The problem is that you can't dispute subjective feelings: if somebody 
tells me that something gives them pleasure, I don't have much grounds 
for an argument. So at the level of the individual and his or her taste 
preferences, all choices are indeed more or less equal; Springsteen, 
Wayne Newton, Star Trek and alternative rock all 'work' in pretty much 
the same way for their respective fan audiences. But at the level of the
 social and political, I think that some taste preferences are better 
than others, that a passionate investment in Springsteen or Star Trek is
 more morally defensible than a similar investment in Wayne Newton or 
alternative rock. I confess that there are limits to my liberal 
pluralism.<br>
<br>
However, I'm not going to take the time here and now to defend such a 
provocative statement; rather, I just want to use it to underscore the 
powerfully divisive consequences of identities formed through taste 
preferences and commodity consumption. We spend too much of our time as a
 society and culture fighting over objects and their consumption, trying
 to decide what are the 'right' sorts of objects and the 'right' ways to
 consume them. The steady increase in the amount of attention we devote 
to cultural consumption should be understood as a measure of the extent 
to which, individually and collectively, we are becoming more and more 
alienated from both the idea and the practice of political community. 
Many people search for an experience of real community through popular 
culture; but being a part of a particular target market cannot satisfy 
the desire for membership in a community. All we can get is a temporary 
feeling of community, which lasts not much longer than the act of 
consumption, and then fades away, which is why we must consume 
repeatedly; a substitute gratification always remains a substitute, 
distracting from the real needs and desires but not satisfying them.<br>
<br>
But — as you have always argued so well, Steven — even if popular 
culture is 'just' a set of symptoms, it still provides us with useful 
tools for social and political analysis; we can read the symptoms for 
the underlying conflicts. Which, to conclude, brings me back again to 
'Born in the USA.' The response to that song, and that particular moment
 in Springsteen's career, makes sense as a kind of logical end-point of 
the message that Springsteen had been communicating through his music. 
That message is both paradoxical and coherent; commenting on the song 
'Born to Run,' Dave Marsh explains it this way:<br>
<br>
'The lyrics are still remarkable, sketching a philosophy of determined 
outward rebellion, a desire to move, a sense of goals and purpose that 
skirt the edges of the larger-than-life. But this hopeful abandon is 
tempered by an equally powerful melancholy; the future seems so bright 
largely because the present's so dismal.' (The Heart of Rock and Soul: 
The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made.)<br>
<br>
With 'Born in the USA,' I think that Springsteen hit upon a kind of 
perfect distillation of his message: a bitter and angry song about how 
American society uses and betrays the ordinary man, but also how those 
same ordinary men affirm their American identity despite the bitterness,
 because the depth of their disappointment is the measure of their 
investment in its promise. Unlike alternative music, with its own 
paradoxical combination of self-loathing and arrogantly smug 
superiority, the sort of rock music that Springsteen represented at 
least offered the hope that there was a place for everyone, that we 
could use the music to work together to build something better. There 
was even a place for the assholes who punched the air with their fists 
to the chords of 'Born in the USA.' In looking at Springsteen's career 
since then, it's as though he saw quite clearly how hard it would be to 
sustain that hope in the face of the problems of inclusiveness, and he 
retired to a more personal and introspective stance. So what lesson 
might Springsteen be said to offer us, in his career and his music? 
Perhaps it's just the simple one that we shouldn't expect our 
commodities, no matter how much they 'work' for us, to provide us with 
the communities we desire; we can only do that ourselves, by working 
with each other.<br>
<br>
STEVEN<br>
<br>
Joe's analysis is intelligent, and though I think he is too harsh on 
alternative music (when Joe Strummer sang that he wanted to walk down 
any street looking like a creep, he may have been arrogantly thumbing 
his nose at the 'popular,' but he was also including in his walk all of 
us who felt like creeps, a step nearly as inclusive as anything Bruce 
Springsteen has done), I think what he has written here works 
beautifully as a Bad Subjectian view of the flaws in the notion of a 
community based on the common consumption of commodities.<br>
<br>
I also thank Joe for coming up with the idea of this article in the 
first place. Much as I love Bruce Springsteen, I had never tried to 
write anything about him; this piece has given me a chance to think 
about Bruce, and has thus been a wonderful experience for me.<br>
<br>
And now, while wanting to avoid the anti-intellectualism implicit in a 
mere celebration of what we love, I feel the need to end this essay with
 such a celebration, for to write about Bruce without attempting to 
convey my feelings for him and his work would be a lie.<br>
<br>
Being popular has never been a problem for Bruce in the way it is for 
alternative bands like Nirvana. He has never been content with only an 
'alternative' audience, and so he is committed to a long run of being a 
popular artist. He wants to maintain his artistic vision and integrity, 
but reaching out to as many fans as possible is a part of that vision, 
and so he can't just turn his back on the popular. Instead, Bruce is a 
prime candidate for the Tony Bennett of the Boomer Generation, the one 
guy who will be most fondly honored in his later years.<br>
<br>
Bruce can't abandon his fans by destroying himself, like the Sex Pistols
 did, or even attempt to abandon them by upping the artistic ante, as 
Nirvana is trying to do, because his fans are a part of his art. We 
recognize this; it is a large part of what makes us love Bruce 
Springsteen more than other favorite performers. For me, 'Rosalita' is 
Bruce's loving call to his audience, as beautiful a metaphor for his 
relationship to us fans as 'Can't Help Falling In Love' was for Elvis. 
In 'Rosalita,' Bruce comes wailing into town to rescue Rosie from her 
mom and dad and her boring old town. He ain't there on business, baby, 
he's only there for fun. Reminding us that closets are for hangers, 
Bruce sneaks us out the bedroom window in the middle of the night and 
drives us down the road to a pretty little place in Southern California 
where they play guitars all night and all day, so hold on tight! The 
music is the most delirious of all of Bruce's songs, and the song served
 as a show-closer for Bruce for many years. Songs like 'Born to Run' 
promised us the world just around the corner, but 'Rosalita' drove us 
around that corner, burning rubber, and delivered us from evil.<br>
<br>
But because his fans are a part of his art, Bruce must move forward with
 tiny steps, if he is to move forward at all, because he can't lose the 
past that his longtime fans represent and still remain 'himself.' 
However, Bruce Springsteen is also a vital artist, one who continues to 
produce vibrant work, and also one who at times must feel constrained by
 the need to remain loyal to the fans who are loyal to him. And so, 
during the Tunnel of Love tour in 1988, he tried a different, more 
'adult' approach to his concerts. When I saw him, the first half of the 
show focused on his new album, with its mature love songs and relatively
 subdued musical presentation. It was wonderful music, played with 
heartfelt emotion, and it insisted on its difference from what Bruce had
 done before. As a fan, I appreciated this music, but then, I appreciate
 a lot of music; I LOVE Bruce, and so there was something disappointing 
about that first set.<br>
<br>
Then Bruce came back for the second half, and he and the E Street Band 
tore into one monster number after another with the glee of a teenager 
and the consummate professionalism that years of playing together had 
brought them. He sang his greatest oldies; he sang the great oldies of 
others that he had made his own; he rocked and rocked and rocked some 
more. It might have been the finest ninety minutes of Bruce Springsteen I
 had ever seen, and I had seen a lot of Bruce Springsteen.<br>
<br>
But, in its clear acceptance of the difference between the Bruce of 
'Tunnel of Love' and the Bruce of 'Little Latin Lupe Lu,' it was also a 
harbinger of the future. Bruce's art needed to move on, but he was too 
devoted to his audience to move forward too quickly. And so he took 'one
 step up and two steps back.'<br>
<br>
By his next tour, the E Street Band was gone, replaced by an assortment 
of lesser-knowns, though the Professor remained on keyboards. Bruce no 
longer sings other people's oldies; as he said many times during the 
tour, he's been around so long now he has his own oldies, and indeed, 
since 'Born to Run' sounded like an oldie the day it came out, he's 
probably right. (He also only sang 'Rosalita' once on the entire tour.) 
Clearly Bruce hopes that by detaching himself from his old band, he can 
accomplish the artistic move forward, even as he continues to work 
harder than anyone to provide his longtime fans with the best show he 
can give them. One thing hasn't changed; though the songs are different,
 the spirit is the same. In 'Born to Run' Bruce sang that someday we 
would get to that place where we really wanted to go; now he sings that 
the Light of Day is just around the corner. One day we'll get there ... 
until then, tramps like us ...<br>

Dusting 'Em Off<br>
July 20, 2013</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
In this week’s edition of Dusting ‘Em Off, staff writers Henry Hauser 
and Bryant Kitching revisit Bruce Springsteen’s dark and intimate 1982 
sixth album, Nebraska. The two discuss its role in Springsteen’s 
disocgraphy, the stories behind the songs, the production style, and 
whether or not the New Jersey hero let go of hope.<br>
<br>
Bryant Kitching (BK): By 1982, Bruce Springsteen was wholly free from 
the heavy legal shackles that had plagued him for the better part of the
 last decade. For the first time in his career, he could do whatever the
 hell he wanted, and his label or lawyers couldn’t say a damn thing. 
What does The Boss do with that freedom? Inspired by Charles 
Starkweather’s 1957-58 killing spree, he churned out Nebraska, one of 
the darkest, most macabre, utterly heart-wrenching albums of all time. 
Sandwiched between two stadium-sized rock monoliths, The River (1980) 
and Born in the USA (1984), that’s what we in the business like to call 
punk as fuck. It’s why it has always been my favorite Springsteen album 
and an album worth revisiting.<br>
<br>
I think back to the photo of Bruce on the inside sleeve. It’s a fuzzy, 
distant shot that looks like the photographer snuck up on him while he 
was creeping around his abandoned childhood home in Freehold, NJ. It 
couldn’t be further from the smiling boardwalk goofball on the Born To 
Run cover, or the take-no-prisoners tough guy from The River. Nebraska 
oozes mystery and chaos while buckling your knees and wetting your eyes.<br>
<br>
Henry Hauser (HH): It’s absolutely true that Nebraska stands in stark 
contrast to Bruce’s earlier work. Nebraska leaves behind the youthful 
exuberance of Greetings from Asbury Park, the bustling friskiness of The
 Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle, and that delirious high of
 ditching “a town full of losers” anchoring Born To Run. What’s left is a
 requiem – a Mourner’s Kaddish for all those wretched souls too timid, 
too dumb, or shackled with just too much rotten luck to make it out of 
the “dead man’s town” where they were born and bred.<br>
<br>
Nebraska finds Bruce’s rambunctious ragamuffin pals Sloppy Sue, Big 
Bones Billy, and Bad Scooter a decade down the line, still languishing 
in the suffocating towns from which they swore they’d escape. It’s about
 the folks that never glanced up at their rearview mirrors as their 
hometowns melted into the horizon. These are the ones that stayed behind
 or, worse yet, got left behind.<br>
<br>
Strictly speaking, these people are still alive. They go about their 
monotonous, mundane lives as best they can, picking up double shifts at 
Walmart, schlepping their dull-eyed kids to and from peewee football 
practice or trying in vain to make ends meet as a single parent amidst 
the crippling tandem of colossal unemployment and double-digit 
inflation. Deep down, though, something inside of them has died — their 
joie de vivre extinguished by the unfulfilled promises of youth and 
tedium of adult life. Their once deeply held creed — that a tank full of
 gas is all you need to score freedom — and the light of flashier, more 
glamorous, greener pastures has been debunked.<br>
<br>
<br>
Channeling this depressive, vacuous vibe by recording Nebraska on a 
four-track Portastudio 144, Springsteen chronicles the swelling divide 
between the haves and have-nots. On “Atlantic City”, he warns us that 
America, once the land of opportunity, has devolved into a land of 
“winners and losers/ and don’t get caught on the wrong side of that 
line.” Pleading for leniency and compassion, the homicidal protagonist 
of “Johnny 99” reminds us that sometimes economic necessity, not rotten 
morals, paves the road to savagery and violence. After “they closed down
 the auto plant in Mahwah” and the bank threatened to take Johnny’s 
house away, he found himself utterly without hope.<br>
<br>
Rather than asserting his innocence at trial, Johnny uses his last words
 conveying to Judge John Brown the realities of life in the 
socioeconomic gutter. Just like the blue-collar everyman in “Atlantic 
City”, Johnny, burdened with “debts no honest man could pay,” can’t 
reconcile the American dream with his living nightmare. In both songs, 
the protagonist searches (in vain) for relief outside the law, whether 
by doing a “little favor” for someone he met last night in “Atlantic 
City”, or “wavin’ his gun around and threatenin’ to blow his top” on 
“Johnny 99”.<br>
<br>
You mention that Nebraska follows comparatively effusive 1980 offering 
The River. Does all this mourning over the squandered freedom and rust 
belt suffocation come out of left field, or does Springsteen tip his 
hand a bit on Nebraska’s predecessor?<br>
<br>
BK: Yes, of course. Even as starkly as Nebraska stands out in the 
Springsteen cannon, it didn’t happen in a vacuum. It might seem hard to 
trace any of Nebraska’s quiet, murderous desperation back to the 
20-track opus The River, but it’s all there. The loneliness, the 
despondency, the idea as you put it, Henry, that sometimes you don’t 
make it out of the “dead man’s town.” Sometimes the gas tank runs dry.<br>
<br>
The main character from The River’s title track can’t find work, he 
can’t give his pregnant 19-year-old wife a proper wedding, and he has no
 real prospect of ever getting out from “down in the valley.” This is 
the same person we see again on “Atlantic City”, “Johnny 99”, or even on
 “State Trooper” or “Highway Patrolman”. There is a difference, though: 
on The River, they have the titular river to wash away their broken 
promises. The people we meet on Nebraska have nothing. Or, as the 
borderline-homicidal character from “State Trooper” puts it, “The only 
thing that I’ve got/ been bothering me my whole life.”<br>
<br>
Pre-Nebraska, Bruce offered glimpses into the depths of his darkest 
psyche, but there was almost always a ladder to help us climb out. Hell,
 “Hungry Heart” might just be the darkest song the guy has ever written,
 but lyrics about a man who gets fed up and leaves his family nearly 
lose their impact when paired with such bubbly instrumentation. Imagine 
that track recorded with just an acoustic guitar and Bruce’s shitty 
Portastudio, and you’ve got something that’d fit perfectly on Nebraska.<br>
<br>
You don’t have to be a Springsteen scholar to know that redemption and 
salvation are two of his most common themes. Redemption comes in the 
form of a car, a girl, a killer sax solo. He preaches salvation through a
 song, a river, or a sunny day at the shore. On Nebraska, even death 
can’t bring deliverance. Probably my favorite line on the whole record 
comes on the title track, when his fictionalized Starkweather character 
is sentenced to death. He tell us, “They declared me unfit to live/ said
 into that great void my soul be hurled.” (If there’s a better metaphor 
for death, I haven’t heard it.) This person isn’t even going to hell. 
His soul is doomed to drift about in this “great void” for all eternity.
 The worst part is, he doesn’t even care because at the end of it all, 
“I guess there’s just a meanness in this world.”<br>
<br>
<br>
One of the unsung moments on the album lies in the dry sarcasm 
Springsteen uses to tease us on closer “Reason To Believe”. Going by 
title alone, you think he’s about to leave us with a glimmer of hope, 
but he’s actually mocking us. There’s a man pulled over by the side of 
the road poking his dead dog with a stick, as if this will somehow 
revive his deceased canine. Instead of mourning or sympathizing, you can
 practically see Bruce roll his eyes when he sings, “At the end of every
 hard-earned day/ people find some reason to believe.”<br>
<br>
Okay, so we’ve established that the Springsteen on Nebraska was a 
totally different animal than anything anyone had seen before, so let’s 
dive into the tracks themselves a bit more. Henry, do you have a 
favorite?<br>
<br>
HH: I’ve always been a bit obsessed with the beautiful melancholy of 
“Reason To Believe”.  Rather than hearing snide sarcasm in Bruce’s 
downtrodden lyrics and gravelly vocals, I hear resilience, guts, and 
gumption.<br>
<br>
It’s true that the folks in “Reason To Believe” have it rough. There’s 
the man mourning over a mutilated dog carcass, the tragically abandoned 
sweetheart waiting “down at the end of that dirt road for young Johnny 
to come back,” and that pathetic bridegroom shuffling his feet all alone
 at the altar as “the sun sets behind a weepin’ willow tree.” Their 
lives are chock-full of pain, hardship, and disappointment. But despite 
absorbing some brutal blows, they aren’t broken. They haven’t given up, 
and they sure as hell aren’t about to lie down and die. They’re 
survivors, they’ve found something to hold on to, something to get them 
through their 9-5 grinds with a few scraps of dignity and hope intact. 
Whether it’s God, six-packs of Bud, or a triumphantly cathartic Bruce 
Springsteen concert, these people have found something on which to graft
 their battered self-esteems and gutted personalities.<br>
<br>
The precise form in which this “something” presents itself doesn’t 
really matter; what’s significant is that these rust belt everymen have 
found “some reason to believe” that maybe things aren’t so bad, that 
their fortunes actually could be on the upswing, or that by the time 
they’re six feet under, their communities will recall them with respect 
and admiration. Here even death has a silver lining, as Springsteen 
deftly alludes to the cyclicality of life by juxtaposing the passing of 
an old man “in a whitewash shotgun shack” with the baptism of baby Kyle 
Williams.<br>
<br>
<br>
Set to a wispy harmonica and sparse acoustic guitar, Springsteen 
presents a phantasmagoria of disappointment and decay. Leading into each
 chorus with a fleeting glimpse of some wretched schmuck shunned by a 
disloyal lover or perturbed by the stark finality of death, we find the 
song’s protagonists on the precipice of surrender and despair. But just 
when all appears lost, faint rays of sunshine pierce through the clouds,
 drawing them back from the edge.  Moaning and groaning, Springsteen 
sings of this puzzling phenomenon. “At the end of every hard-earned day/
 people find some reason to believe.”<br>
<br>
Strongly emphasizing the phrase “hard-earned day” with his rasping vocal
 to highlight the interminable burden these people bear, Springsteen 
whispers the song’s titular lyric as the chorus segues seamlessly into a
 fresh portrait of heartache and sorrow. Sure, this “reason to believe” 
may be nothing more than an echo or a shadow, but at least it’s 
something. And in a world sharply divided between haves and have-nots, 
something is a whole a lot better than nothing.<br>
<br>
So, Bryant, am I right to presume that you’re partial to the album’s title track?<br>
<br>
BK: “Nebraska” is a monster, no doubt. But the one that has always 
resonated most with me is “State Trooper”. It’s just a bare-bones guitar
 line and Springsteen’s hollow vocals that sound both distant and like 
he’s whispering right into your ear. It’s a not-so-subtle nod to 
Suicide, who Springsteen was a big fan of during this period. He even 
famously said, “If Elvis came back from the dead, I think he would sound
 like [Suicide frontman] Alan Vega.”<br>
<br>
Suicide’s 10-minute electronic murder ballad “Frankie Teardrop” deeply 
affected Springsteen, and it didn’t take him long to release a track 
brimming with just as much desperation and pent-up rage. The man he 
introduces us to is a loose cannon in every sense of the term. Driving 
on the Jersey turnpike in the dead of night, he tells us, “License, 
registration, I ain’t got none/ but I got a clear conscience about the 
things that I’ve done.” It’s an utterly terrifying experience for the 
listener, as their imagination starts running wild. How many people has 
he already killed? Where is he going? How long before he kills again? 
Even after hundreds of listens, it never fails to make my palms sweat 
and plant a knot deep in my stomach. It’s an amazing feat of 
craftsmanship that he’s able to elicit that kind of response with the 
limited toolbox he was working with.<br>
<br>
The line “Hi ho Silver-o, deliver me from nowhere” encapsulates the 
entire album perfectly. Here is someone who is so dead inside that even 
God has given up on him. There’s no hope left, so he’s going to sit back
 and watch the world burn. That, to me, is what Nebraska is all about. 
It’s also why the album isn’t widely appreciated outside of Springsteen 
diehards. His storytelling had never been stronger, but these weren’t 
necessarily tales people were comfortable hearing, let alone playing at 
family BBQs or karaoke bars.<br>
<br>
HH: While I agree that Nebraska paints a dark and dire picture, I just 
can’t believe that Bruce and his buddies have lost all hope. Take “Open 
All Night”, the only Nebraska song to feature an electric guitar. Though
 lacking the alluring and naughty thrill of escape heard in fellow 
nocturnal automotive ditties “Spirit in the Night” and “Thunder Road” 
(“Show a little faith/ there’s magic in the night”), the track 
poignantly champions the restorative tandem of rock music and the open 
highway.<br>
<br>
Though the New Jersey turnpike’s “lunar landscape” may be “spooky at 
night when you’re all alone,” our protagonist swallows his fear, fuels 
up, and braves the long, winding road separating him from his Wanda. As 
the singer fights off physical exhaustion and emotional demons, the song
 ends with the promise of a new day (“sun’s just a red ball risin’ over 
them refinery towers”) and an appeal to that great haloed DJ in the sky 
(“hear my last prayer/ hey ho rock n’ roll deliver me from nowhere”). As
 long as he’s got a car and an FM radio, anything (even deliverance and 
redemption) is within reach.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s music bristles with the tension between the collective and
 the individual. There is a burning passion to escape, to strike out on 
one’s own, but a concurrent awareness of the need to connect and 
ultimately return to a larger community. Albums like Greetings from 
Asbury Park and Born To Run reveal the need to establish a unique 
personality through rebellion and escape and then reconcile that 
identity with community so as to alleviate the pain of alienation. 
Nebraska shows us that failure to balance these needs begets the intense
 heartbreak of sorrow and regret. Thankfully, it’s never fully hopeless.
 There’s always something to latch onto like a lifeboat amidst icy 
waters: a spouse, a rusty old Ford, or, as Springsteen boisterously and 
garishly channels on 1984’s Born in the USA, bright and blinding 
patriotism.<br>
<br>
Still think there’s no hope, Bryant?<br>
<br>
BK: Henry, you almost have me convinced. Almost. Listening to “Open All 
Night” as I write this now, I can hear the same guy who once begged 
Rosie to come out tonight. He’s buried deep, and probably has a body or 
two stuffed in his trunk, but he’s just as earnest about getting back to
 his baby. I still think it’s impossible to tease any inkling of hope 
out of songs like “Nebraska” or “State Trooper”, but there are times on 
the album I suppose a silver lining does peek its head through the 
darkness and pain.<br>
<br>
Perhaps that’s what makes Nebraska Springsteen’s most rewarding album. 
Tom Morello is quoted as saying, “I didn’t know there was music like 
that, that was as impactful and as heavy as Nebraska was. The alienation
 that I felt was for the first time expressed in music.” The key word 
there is impactful. Springsteen’s more commercial work is certainly 
impactful, but in the way of your first kiss or a mother’s hug. Nebraska
 is more akin to your first fistfight. Each experience packs one hell of
 a wallop, emotionally and developmentally, but there are few things 
that teach you more about yourself than getting an ass whooping. The 
road may be paved with broken hearts and buried bodies, but the payoff 
is magnificent.</div>
