Neil McCormick<br>
DAILY TELEGRAPH (UK)<br>
December 28, 2013</strong><br>
<br>
As one of rock’s great storytellers, Bruce Springsteen usually makes 
albums with a strong narrative thrust binding the songs together. So 
what are we supposed to make of a new CD that opens with a rocky cover 
of a folk song about finding hope in a hopeless world, ends with an 
atmospheric take on the romantic Dream Baby Dream (originally by synth 
band Suicide) and, in between, roams across topics including 
institutional racism, Vietnam, 9/11 and the everlasting triumph of our 
Lord Jesus Christ?<br>
<br>
Although substantially re-recorded and presented as a new collection, 
these 12 tracks are odds and ends, “leftovers” from other sessions and 
new versions of songs that have taken different forms on the road. 
Springsteen has always written a lot of material which he shapes and 
filters, with some songs – ones that many fans consider classics – 
discarded from his sets as he goes. Previously, these sorts of rejects 
have surfaced on compilations, notably the excellent Tracks box set from
 1998. <br>
<br>
This time, he has revamped and re-recorded lost songs to bring them up 
to date. You can hear the old, meaty saxophone of Clarence Clemons (who 
died in 2011) and the rangy piano playing of Danny Federici (who died in
 2008), but they’re combined with the new, slashing art-attack guitar of
 Rage Against The Machine’s Tom Morello, who was brought in to expand 
the E Street Band line up in 2012.<br>
<br>
Morello is the album’s guiding spirit. But while his agit-pop 
sensibility is a good fit with Springsteen’s socio-political conscience,
 his effects-laden guitar playing operates at odd angles to the deep 
roots sensibility of the E Street sound. He slashes and burns through 
American Skin (41 Shots), a raging, angry anthem inspired by the 1999 
police shooting of immigrant Amadou Diallo, giving Springsteen the 
contemporary edge he has been looking for. <br>
<br>
But Morello tips a revamped Ghost Of Tom Joad completely over the top, 
taking the quiet dignity of the acoustic 1995 original and turning it 
into a zany prog rock wig-out. The pieces of the song don’t quite fit 
together, and the same might be said of the whole album. <br>
<br>
Particularly ill-fitting are songs of unambiguous Christian faith, 
presumably plucked from a gospel album Springsteen scrapped before 
2012’s triumphant Wrecking Ball. There is a stiff didacticism in their 
Biblical language that sits poorly with Springsteen’s questioning 
humanism elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Releasing this album at 64, Springsteen seems busier than ever. In a 
recent Rolling Stone interview he said, “It’s that old story, the light 
from the oncoming train focuses the mind”. Unfortunately, it hasn’t 
focused this record. Perhaps the real story of High Hopes is that 
Springsteen is only trying to keep busy. There’s a lot of great stuff on
 here, but it doesn’t hold together and doesn’t come close to being one 
of Springsteen’s great albums.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">1. High Hopes</strong><br>
<br>
A big, anthemic, percussive opener about seeking hope in a hopeless 
place. Originally a folk song by Tim Scott McConnell, Springsteen first 
covered it for an EP in 1996. This rocking new Tom Morello-infused 
version fits the angry yet optimistic spirit of Springsteen’s worldwide 
Wrecking Ball tour.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">2. Harry’s Place</strong><br>
<br>
Morello brings punky drive this snapshot of the decadent energy of a 
drug and drinks den, first recorded for The Rising. Springsteen writes 
with a kind of beatnik poeticism reminiscent of his earliest albums, but
 there’s a tough wisdom in there too in his acceptance rather than 
condemnation of a nefarious place where you might find “the key to the 
box you locked yourself in”. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">3. American Skin (41 Shots)</strong><br>
<br>
A synthy pulse runs through this angry anthem inspired by a police 
shooting of an innocent immigrant. Inspired by an incident in 1999, it 
was revived for the E Street Band’s live set after the shooting of US 
teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">4. Just Like Fire Would</strong><br>
<br>
A sharp, straightforward cover of Australian punk band The Saints, riffing on ideas of passion and a life on the road.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">5. Down in the Hole</strong><br>
<br>
The rhythm of a grinding machine clunks away beneath the ghostly, folky 
ambience of this brooding song about digging for a body in the wreckage 
of a disaster. “I’m buried to my heart here in this hurt,” sings 
Springsteen, amid a wash of sonic textures. Originally from sessions for
 his 9/11 album, The Rising.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">6. Heaven’s Wall</strong><br>
<br>
An out and out gospel rocker. There’s a lot of energy and excitement as 
Bruce the preachers exhorts us to raise our hands, but out of its live 
context it’s hard to square the questioning humanism of Springsteen’s 
persona with the unambiguous born-again zeal of a salvation lyric 
couched in Biblical language.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">7. Frankie Fell In Love</strong><br>
<br>
Country guitar and violin lead into a celebratory vignette about news of
 a small town engagement: “World peace going to break out!” With its 
effervescent Felice Brothers vibe, it sounds like something from the 
uplifting 2009 E Street comeback album Working On A Dream.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">8. This is Your Sword</strong><br>
<br>
Another religious song, Springsteen promises “days of miracle” and “the 
power of love revealed” to a folky melody reminiscent of Wild Mountain 
Thyme. Before the angry and politicised Wrecking Ball, Springsteen says 
he scrapped an album’s worth of gospel songs. This should have stayed 
scrapped.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">9. Hunter of Invisible Game</strong><br>
<br>
An acoustic waltz with lush, strange strings, this is another song with a
 Christian core, yet the poetic ambiguity of the language leaves it 
satisfyingly open to interpretation. There are late period Dylanesque 
touches in the image of a hobo hunter moving through a burned out 
American landscape. The quarry is presumably the human soul, though it 
is hard to tell if the hunter is Christ or Satan.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">10. The Ghost of Tom Joad (2013)</strong><br>
<br>
Essentially the rocked up version of this Springsteen classic from the 
last tour, driven by fierce idealism but succumbing to a showboating, 
effects-laden Morello solo that sounds ludicrous out of the live 
context. “This version starts as a plaintive ballad, which feels like a 
lament, and becomes a full-bore rocker that feels like a threat,” 
according to Morello. Or like a Pink Floyd wig out.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">11. The Wall</strong><br>
<br>
A sparse, stately elegy for Walter Cichon, an influential local rock 
icon with The Misfits from Springsteen’s New Jersey youth, who went 
missing in action in Vietnam in 1968. A sombre Springsteen contemplates 
the lost potential of all those names on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial 
in Washington.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
12. Dream Baby Dream</strong><br>
<br>
Springsteen makes a harmonium sounds as strange and modern as a 
synthesizer on an atmospheric, Roy Orbison-esque version of a song by 
New York electro-punk duo Suicide that winds the album down on a lovely,
 elegiac and romantic note.</div>

By Hardeep Phull<br>
December 31, 2013 <br>
NEW YORK POST</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
The Boss disappoints with his latest studio album, "High Hopes."<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Despite insisting that “High Hopes” should be 
considered as a full-fledged album, Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street
 Band aren’t quite able to justify that claim. It is essentially what it
 seems — a collection of covers, live favorites and lost songs, all 
given a revamp. There are some pieces of gold and silver to be found, 
but the chunks of junk thrown into the mix turn the album’s high hopes 
into a frustratingly inconsistent reality.</em><br>
<br>
It probably wasn’t much of a happy holiday for Bruce Springsteen.<br>
Just weeks before the launch of his 18th album, “High Hopes,” online 
retailer Amazon dropped the ball and accidentally made it available for a
 few hours, causing the album to leak.<br>
But it’s probably the best Christmas present that impatient E Street Band fans could have hoped for. And that includes us. <br>
<br>
Here’s our track-by-track rundown.<br>
<br>
“High Hopes” ★★<br>
Bruce comes out of the blocks with a brassy, boisterous take on a song 
originally recorded by folk-blues outfit The Havalinas. A solid if 
unremarkable start.<br>
“Harry’s Place” ★★★½<br>
The streetwise feel of Springsteen’s early albums is resurrected for 
this creeping masterpiece. “Harry’s Place” is clearly a seedy, dangerous
 den of criminal activity, but The Boss’ seductive description makes you
 want to be there all the same.<br>
“American Skin (41 Shots)” ★★★<br>
Following the shooting of African immigrant Amadou Diallo in 1999 by 
four New York police offers, Springsteen began performing this powerful 
take on the incident. He revived it during gigs in the wake of the death
 of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, and at long last, it gets a
 full and affecting studio version.<br>
“Just Like Fire Would” ★★<br>
A spirited chronicle of life on the road that stays faithful to the 
original by Australian punks The Saints. The E Street Band do it 
justice, but even so, it feels like filler.<br>
“Down in the Hole” ★★½<br>
Written during the sessions for Bruce’s post-9/11 opus “The Rising,” the
 ghosts of New York City’s past are audible in this mournful account of a
 narrator literally digging for a lost loved one amid the ruins of a 
city.<br>
“Heaven’s Wall” ★★<br>
Bruce goes gospel in this spiritually themed rocker, but for all the 
exuberance, it doesn’t quite satisfy, either lyrically or musically.<br>
“Frankie Fell in Love” ★★½<br>
A rowdy rocker that encapsulates love and life in Anytown, USA. It’s an 
obvious throwback to the E Street Band’s glory days, and could have fit 
in perfectly on “The River” or “Born in the U.S.A.”<br>
“This Is Your Sword” ★½<br>
The E Street Band are in full bluster while puffed-up declarations of 
solidarity rise proudly through the lyrics, but “This Is Your Sword” is 
still the kind of song Bruce and the boys could knock out in their 
sleep.<br>
“Hunter of Invisible Game” ★★★<br>
The string-heavy arrangement might not grab you on first listen, but 
it’s the wonderfully ambiguous lyrical themes of delusion and salvation 
that will keep you coming back. Bruce’s skill as a wordsmith obviously 
hasn’t deserted him.<br>
“The Ghost of Tom Joad” ★<br>
This bro-rock travesty tramples on the quiet poignancy of the 1995 
original, thanks to completely unnecessary guitar solos from Rage 
Against The Machine’s Tom Morello. It’s a live favorite, but jars badly 
on record.<br>
“The Wall” ★★½<br>
Bruce’s stately and moving tribute to an old Jersey Shore musician named
 Walter Cichon, who was dispatched to serve in Vietnam but never 
returned. “You and your rock ’n’ roll band were the best thing this 
s - - t town ever had,” he remembers. But within this personal tribute 
lies an acknowledgment of the unfulfilled potential of all who died in 
the war.<br>
“Dream Baby Dream” ★★★<br>
For years, Springsteen has been known to perform his hymnal version of 
“Dream Baby Dream” — a signature song for the cult New York electro-punk
 group Suicide. Here, it serves as a bright and beautiful end to “High 
Hopes.”</div>

<br>
ROLLING STONE<br>
David Fricke<br>
January 6, 2013</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen's 18th studio album is a portrait of the artist at the
 top of his 21st-century game: rock-soul dynamite and finely drawn 
pathos bound by familiar, urgent themes (national crisis, private 
struggle, the daily striving for more perfect union) and the 
certain-victor's force in Springsteen's singing. High Hopes is also a 
deep look back over Springsteen's past decade, his best onstage and 
record since the first, with a keen eye turned forward. The cumulative 
effect of this mass of old, borrowed, blue and renewed – covers, recent 
outtakes and redefining takes on two classics – is retrospect with a 
cutting edge, running like one of the singer's epic look-ma-no-set-list 
gigs: full of surprises, all with a reason for being there.<br>
<br>
Much of High Hopes comes from the what-was-he-thinking shelf: unreleased
 songs cut for albums going back to 2002's The Rising, revived with 
freshening parts. It's hard to see how "Frankie Fell in Love," a 
frat-rock riot, and the letter from rock bottom "Down in the Hole" ("My 
Hometown" with less light) ever got the chop. But Springsteen 
effectively recasts this material with the folk-soul-gospel-army might 
of his current E Street big band. The background-vocal choir puts a 
literal finishing touch on the warrior-hymn charge of "Heaven's Wall." 
In the gangsters convention "Harry's Place," recent E Street recruit Tom
 Morello fires chain-saw bursts of guitar across meaty peals of sax 
originally laid down by the late Clarence Clemons. And that's Danny 
Federici, who died in 2008, playing organ on "The Wall," a requiem for 
one of Springsteen's Jersey-bar-band mentors, underscoring the singer's 
belief in the unbroken chains running through his band.<br>
<br>
Springsteen revisits two older songs with dramatic results: the acoustic
 title track from 1995's The Ghost of Tom Joad, and "American Skin (41 
Shots)," his response to the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo by New York 
City police. Morello previously electrified "Tom Joad" with Rage Against
 the Machine; he is a key trigger in this heaving-Phil Spector 
detonation as well. Springsteen gives him a verse to sing, adding a 
younger, strident tension to his own fury, while Morello's soloing – 
scouring and elegiac – puts a new exclamation point on the pledge of 
righteous vengeance, the way Jimi Hendrix forever altered the Armageddon
 in "All Along the Watchtower." Morello is on "American Skin" too, but 
this version is Springsteen's triumph as a bandleader – sculpting that 
live force with rich studio textures – and a topical lyricist, mining 
new headlines (Trayvon Martin, NSA surveillance, the numbing cycle of 
school shootings) reverberating in there now.<br>
<br>
High Hopes starts and ends with covers, a first on a Springsteen studio 
album. But the title song, a 1990 rebel-folk gallop by the Havalinas, 
and Suicide's closing mantra, "Dream Baby Dream," are fighters' 
promises, and they fit Springsteen and this record like weathered boxing
 gloves. "Give me help/Give me strength/Give a soul a night of fearless 
sleep," he demands in the former, in a crusty, arcing howl, like a guy 
who's been doing this for a long time and is real tired of asking nice.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
MUSIC.COM<br>
Jan 7, 2013</strong><br>
<br>
For someone whose sustained reputation mostly rests on his legendary 
relationship with his fans, Bruce Springsteen seems to have a 
surprisingly large number of disgruntled followers. Rather than mass 
excitement, the announcement that 2012’s imperfect but much loved 
Wrecking Ball would be followed promptly with a studio album constructed
 from new recordings of old songs, relatively recent outtakes and 
(horror of horrors) cover versions prompted consternation and rash 
judgement.<br>
<br>
Some could not quite handle the bereavement that comes with the loss of 
Springsteen’s supposed ‘narrative or thematic arc’, common to most of 
his albums (although certainly not all of them – The River was pretty 
sprawling after all). Others saw the news as an unmistakeable sign that 
Springsteen is now an artist in decline.<br>
<br>
The reality, of course, is much more complex. Springsteen may have 
partially confessed to his alleged crimes by describing High Hopes as 
‘an anomaly’ and the roll call of contributors is probably the longest 
and most confusing of any Springsteen studio release. Yet High Hopes 
does demonstrate its own interior logic, not least in Springsteen’s 
emphasis on the importance of faith in desperate times (whether it be a 
Christian religious faith, or the fans’ continued faith in the Church of
 The Boss).<br>
<br>
First, Springsteen’s selection of songs to re-record is judicious and 
timely. American Skin (41 Shots), initially performed live in response 
to the shooting of Amadou Diallo in New York City by four policemen in 
1999, has recently assumed a new vitality following the acquittal of 
George Zimmerman in the controversial Trayvon Martin case. Its 
incarnation on High Hopes is less stark and more nuanced, a clear point 
where Ron Aniello’s production flourishes complement rather than dilute a
 really powerful song. The surging, incendiary electric take on The 
Ghost Of Tom Joad revisits Springsteen’s narrative in support of life on
 the margins in America, but this time sounds righteous and angry rather
 than plaintive and desolate.<br>
<br>
Secondly, the covers (and relatively straight ahead interpretations have
 always been a key part of the E Street Band live experience) are 
excellent. Tim Scott McConnell’s High Hopes and The Saints’ Just Like 
Fire Would may be handled faithfully enough here, but they are testament
 to Springsteen’s core virtues as a performer. Both sound like they 
could have been written by him, to such an extent does he stake his 
claim on the words and the delivery. Both also at last capture something
 close to the extraordinary wall of sound created by the modern 
juggernaut E Street Band in concert (jubilant horn section included). 
High Hopes is a delightful, invigorating New Orleans shuffle, whilst 
Just Like Fire Would sounds strident, muscular and defiant. The closing 
Dream Baby Dream showcases Springsteen’s continued penchant for 
overproduction – but even the added synth layers and strings can’t quite
 puncture its emotive, mournful halo (it’s Suicide by way of Roy 
Orbison). When coupled with the video memories from the Wrecking Ball 
tour (including the tributes to the much missed Clarence Clemons and 
Danny Federici), the poignancy is overwhelming.<br>
<br>
Elsewhere, there are some great recordings rescued from the vaults. Down
 In The Hole, most likely an outtake from The Rising, is haunting and 
evocative, both revisiting the linear groove from I’m On Fire whilst 
also subtly subverting it with delicately plucked banjos, unexpected 
rhythmic shifts, eerie backing vocals and carefully interwoven effects. 
Hunter Of Invisible Game is a rare Springsteen song with a waltz feel, 
continuing his recent preoccupation with Irish folk sounds and with some
 delightfully surrealist, allegorical and poetic Bob Dylan-esque lyrics.
 It’s certainly hard to see how this could have sat comfortably on any 
of Springsteen’s 21st century albums, but it’s a very welcome moment of 
reflection and imagination here.<br>
<br>
Perhaps even more thoughtful, and certainly more starkly real, is The 
Wall. This recasts the beautiful melody of Shenandoah into a complex and
 moving song paying tribute to old New Jersey friends who never returned
 from Vietnam. The rhythm section is appropriately restrained and 
unobtrusive, Springsteen’s best storytelling voice right in the 
foreground. There’s also a moving organ solo contribution from the late 
Danny Federici.<br>
<br>
The album’s middle section might be its most problematic, and it 
certainly seems strange to find three relatively direct, uncomplicated 
rockers sequenced next to each other on an album that otherwise proudly 
proclaims its musical diversity. Heaven’s Wall and This Is Your Sword 
appear to come from an album of gospel songs Springsteen discarded in 
favour of what became Wrecking Ball. The former is rousing and upbeat, 
with stadium-pleasing credentials, but actually breaks little new 
ground. This Is Your Sword is arguably more interesting, given its 
hymn-like qualities. In between the two comes Frankie Fell In Love, a 
fun enough but somewhat lightweight pop song that serves as a great 
vehicle for Steve Van Zandt’s spirited vocal harmonies.<br>
<br>
There are common musical threads in High Hopes too. The lingering 
influence of the blues is never far away – it’s in the melodic 
inflections and some of the changes on High Hopes, and it’s in the 
creeping menace of Harry’s Place (a song that takes Bruce deeper into a 
world of murky power games and crime than he has yet ventured). The 
other clear thread is the presence of key collaborator Tom Morello. His 
effects-laden strafes, taps and rapid-fire fretboard runs sometimes seem
 apocalyptic and refreshing, but at others a little tasteless. What 
works perfectly with the quasi-funk agitprop of Rage Against The Machine
 does not always merge effortlessly with the E Street Band. His 
abrasions capture an appropriate nastiness on Harry’s Place, but it’s 
arguable that the excessive solo on The Ghost Of Tom Joad hams up an 
already terrifying reading of the song (although his more unexpected 
vocal contribution works very well).<br>
<br>
High Hopes could be a contract fulfiller, or it could simply be serving 
as a peg for continued touring, the field in which Springsteen 
undoubtedly now best expresses himself. If approached with an open mind 
and a lack of cynicism, however, its unpredictable twists and turns are 
in themselves quite fascinating. There’s a spirit of collaboration that 
is largely new, a genuine and warm-hearted celebration of past members’ 
contributions and a celebration of the rowdy, uplifting storm cooked up 
by the 18-strong modern incarnation of the group. It is a fascinating 
alternative history of the post-reunion E Street Band, a still evolving 
beast collectively raging against the dying of the light. Our next 
communion will no doubt be arranged before too long.<br>
<br>

<br>
<strong class="text-strong">ULTIMATE CLASSIC ROCK<br>
JAN 8, 2013</strong><br>
<br>
High Hopes’ is Bruce Springsteen‘s most disjointed album, and purposely 
so. Pulled together from various outtakes, cover songs and re-recordings
 from the past two decades, Springsteen’s 18th album is looser and less 
structurally sound than anything he’s released since becoming a star in 
the mid ’70s. And without something more sturdy to hang his music and 
lyrics on, ‘High Hopes’ is somewhat aimless.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Not that there aren’t some strong songs scattered among the occasionally
 flimsy frames holding ‘High Hopes’ together. But chances are, you’re 
probably already familiar with the best of them. ‘American Skin (41 
Shots),’ originally written in 1999 and one of Springsteen’s best songs 
of the past 15 years, finally gets an official studio version after 
years of airtight performances onstage. Revived in the wake of the 
shooting death of Trayvon Martin last year, the song sounds even more 
angry now.<br>
<br>
Springsteen assembled much of ‘High Hopes’ during breaks on his 2012 
tour. Late E Street Band members Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici 
show up on a few songs from the vaults. So does Rage Against the Machine
 guitarist Tom Morello, whose presence on the album elevates 
Springsteen’s own guitar playing and performance at times. Their duet on
 the reworked ‘The Ghost of Tom Joad’ transforms Springsteen’s 1995 folk
 song from acoustic rumination to electric fury.<br>
<br>
But ‘High Hopes’ betrays its sketchy origins at times, especially its 
middle section, which is filled with forgettable songs that sound like 
leftovers from Springsteen’s string of ’00s records (it doesn’t help 
that the album unravels for almost an hour — way too long for an LP 
cobbled together like this one). For an artist who used to take 
frustratingly long times between projects, Springsteen sure has rushed 
them out over the past 10 years.<br>
<br>
Still, ‘High Hopes’ has the beginning and end of a more cohesive album, 
bookmarked by a pair of covers — the Havalinas’ title track, which 
Springsteen first recorded on a 1995 EP, and Suicide’s ‘Dream Baby 
Dream,’ respectively — that tear through the semigloss production (by 
Ron Aniello and Brendan O’Brien) found on the album. Along with 
‘American Skin,’ they’re ‘High Hopes” best tracks.<br>
<br>
The rest of it falls together, not as recklessly as you’d assume, with a
 usual mix of late-period Springsteen grandeur and self-importance. 
Occasionally the songs merit the musical and lyrical heft (‘Down in the 
Hole,’ ‘The Wall’); often, they don’t (‘This Is Your Sword’ and ‘Hunter 
of Invisible Game’ aim big but misfire).<br>
<br>
By the time the hazy, drifting ‘Dream Baby Dream’ brings ‘High Hopes’ to
 a fitting close, it feels like vindication for an album that’s often 
left wandering without the single-minded purpose that typically drives 
Springsteen’s records. It’s not necessarily an unpleasant stroll, but 
it’s one that nonetheless stumbles in its journey through the past.<br>

‘High Hopes’ Review: Bruce Springsteen Lowers the Bar<br>
by Andrew RomanoJan 7, 2014 <br>
<br>
Springsteen’s signature has always been his ambition to make big, 
beautiful, transcendent albums. As the final track fades out, it’s 
undeniable: High Hopes is a disappointment.<br>
l<br>
How do you solve a problem like High Hopes, the “new” (note the quotation marks) album by Bruce Springsteen?<br>
<br>
<br>
Imagine you’re a Springsteen fan. Scratch that. Imagine you’re a 
Springsteen fanatic—the sort of zealot who spent the first 22 years of 
his life in South and Central Jersey, the heart of Springsteen country; 
who at the age of two would entertain his parents’ dinner guests by 
performing selections from Born in the U.S.A., complete with his own 
improvised toddler choreography; who refused to back out of the driveway
 the day he got his license without first cueing up “Born to Run” on the
 car stereo; who spent far too many summer nights in high school 
strumming “Hungry Heart” on the sands of the Jersey Shore in a vain 
attempt to impress the local girls; and who has eagerly anticipated and 
basically adored everything Bruce has ever released.<br>
<br>
Now imagine that you’ve received an advance copy of High Hopes in the 
mail a couple of weeks before its official Jan. 14 release date. You 
slip the CD into the stereo and press play. You listen to song after 
song—attentively, open-mindedly, optimistically. But as the final track 
fades out, you can no longer deny it. You’ve never been disappointed by a
 Springsteen album before. But that’s exactly what High Hopes feels 
like: a disappointment.<br>
<br>
This is the pickle I find myself in as I sit down to review Bruce’s latest.<br>
<br>
We’ve arrived at a tricky point in the history of rock ‘n’ roll. As of 
2014, pretty much all of the genre’s golden-age practitioners are 
officially senior citizens. Many of the bands they formed back in the 
1950s, 1960s, and 1970s are broken up; many of the members of those 
bands are dead. Of the few who remain—the survivors—the most popular 
career path seems to be reciting the greatest hits live, over and over 
again, in an entertaining (and lucrative) display of musical endurance 
that nonetheless doesn’t have a whole lot to do with the kind of 
creativity that made them famous in the first place. The Rolling Stones,
 for example, have been relentlessly reissuing, repackaging, and touring
 on their back catalog in recent years, but they haven’t released a new 
LP in nearly a decade.<br>
<br>
And then there are the holdouts—the AARP-aged artists who are still 
trying to stay in touch with their muse. Bob Dylan, 72. David Bowie, 66.
 Paul McCartney, 71. And, of course, Bruce Springsteen, who will turn 65
 in September.<br>
<br>
What do we owe these legends? How should we respond to their new 
material, as fans? Should we be grateful for whatever music they deign 
to release and grade them on a curve because of it? Should every new 
Dylan, Bowie, or McCartney record receive a Lifetime Achievement Award 
of sorts? Or should we hold these guys to the same, higher standard we 
held them to back in 1964, or 1971, or 1984: how good is the album 
itself, regardless of whether it’s their first or their 31st?<br>
<br>
As Springsteen fans, we’ve been fortunate. We haven’t really had to 
grapple with these questions yet. After experiencing a musical midlife 
crisis in the 1990s—a“lost period” during which “I didn’t do my best 
work,” Springsteen has admitted—The Boss reunited with the E Street Band
 in 1999 and spent the next 15 years releasing one forceful (Wrecking 
Ball), intriguing (Devils &amp; Dust), or just downright fantastic album
 (The Rising) after another. It’s been a remarkable late-career run for 
Bruce. Only Dylan’s current, post-Time Out of Mind renaissance can 
compare.<br>
<br>
But High Hopes interrupts Springsteen’s streak. The problem isn’t that 
the music is bad, per se (although “Harry’s Place,” a gruff non-tune 
festooned with seedy sax riffs and dated washes of wah-wah guitar sounds
 more like the theme song to a 1987 Steven Bochco network drama about 
corrupt Newark cops than a proper Springsteen track). Instead, the 
problem is that, on High Hopes, the impossibly lofty standards 
Springsteen has set for himself over the last 41 years seem to have 
slackened. For the first time, the Boss has lowered the bar. <br>
<br>
Some of the songs here are enjoyable. Like all of Bruce’s finest work, 
“Hunter of Invisible Game,” an Appalachian ballad about desire and 
desperation, feels totally inevitable, as if it was carved in stone 
during the Paleolithic period. The lovely “Down in the Hole” resurrects 
the vibe of Springsteen’s 1993 classic “Streets of Philadelphia” for a 
haunting soliloquy by a 9/11 rescue worker. “The Wall,” a tribute to a 
fellow Jersey Shore rocker named Walter Chicon who died in Vietnam, 
boasts the kind of detailed, devastating lyric—rare these days—that The 
Boss used to write by the dozens in the late 1970s and early 1980s. And 
the raucous “Frankie Fell in Love” is going to blow the roof off of a 
stadium near you next summer.<br>
<br>
And yet High Hopes is missing something essential—that bedrock Springsteen blend of discipline and ambition.<br>
<br>
 When The Beatles recorded an LP, they rarely had any leftovers; almost 
everything they wrote was eventually pressed on vinyl. Springsteen has 
always been different. For Darkness on the Edge of Town, The River, and 
Born to Run, he wrote more than 50 songs per album, then spent months 
whittling the final tracklists to the bare necessities. By 1998, he had 
amassed an archive of more than 350 unreleased songs—three-quarters of 
his entire recorded catalog. The quality of Springsteen’s rejects was 
often staggering; to hear what I mean, check out the 1998 rarities box 
set Tracks or, even better, 2010’s The Promise, an entire lost 
double-album that Bruce recorded after Born in the U.S.A. then shelved 
for the next 34 years. The guy was an obsessive. A perfectionist. That’s
 what made so many of his albums so great. Every song was there for a 
reason: tone, story, theme, whatever. Just being a good song wasn’t 
reason enough.<br>
<br>
Like Tracks or The Promise, High Hopes has been cobbled together from 
castoffs. “Harry’s Place” is a Rising reject. “The Wall” was written in 
1998. “Heaven's Wall,” “Down in the Hole,” and “Hunter of Invisible 
Game” all date from the mid-Aughties. “Just Like Fire Would,” “Dream 
Baby Dream,” and “High Hopes” are cover songs, the last of which 
Springsteen recorded and released once before (on 1996’s Blood Brothers 
EP). “The Ghost of Tom Joad” is also a new version of a previously 
released song, in this case the title track of Springsteen’s eleventh 
studio album (which originally came out in 1995). And “American Skin (41
 Shots)” is a longtime concert favorite that first appeared in 2000’s 
Live in New York City and later surfaced on The Essential Bruce 
Springsteen.<br>
<br>
And yet, unlike The Promise and Tracks, High Hopes isn’t an archival 
release. It’s a new Springsteen LP. In theory, the distinction shouldn’t
 really matter. Springsteen has recorded old songs for new albums 
before, and if the tracks on High Hopes were as vital as, say, 
“Independence Day,” a Darkness outtake that ended up on the The River, 
all would be well. But the truth is that Springsteen is no longer 
writing as much A+ material as he was in the late 1970s, so now seems 
like precisely the wrong time to assemble an entire LP from recent 
additions to the slush pile.<br>
<br>
Listen to the new album and you’ll see what I mean. Of course not every 
album Bruce released prior to High Hopes was amazing. But you always got
 the sense that they were trying to be amazing albums. High Hopes feels 
like it’s just trying to be an album. The title track (again, a cover) 
is an aimless Bo Diddley raveup. “Just Like Fire Would” (another cover) 
comes way too close to John Mellencamp’s “Small Town” for comfort. 
“Heaven’s Wall” and “This is Your Sword” are fine, but neither one is as
 sharp or urgent as the similarly gospel- and Gaelic-inflected tracks on
 Wrecking Ball. And wherever Tom Morello shows up—the former Rage 
Against the Machine guitarist subbed for Steven Van Zandt on the 
Australian leg of the Wrecking Ball tour, then started recording with 
Springsteen—he makes matters worse. By slathering his flashy, squealing,
 heavily processed licks all over “American Skin (41 Shots)” and “The 
Ghost of Tom Joad,” he transforms what could have been the two strongest
 tracks on the album into hair-metal indulgences that sonically betray 
the somber gravity of their own lyrics. The live version of the former 
and the acoustic version of the latter are much better than these new 
renditions—so what’s the point?<br>
<br>
I’m sure that some fans are fuming right now. How dare I even ask that 
question? More Bruce is always better than less Bruce, they’d say. 
That’s the point, stupid. Or, as a commenter named Peter recently wrote 
on the American Songwriter website, “What relevance or merit do so 
called reviewers have when grading or assessing the work of an artist 
with the history and achievements of a Bruce Springsteen? Won an Oscar 
or two? Collected more Grammys than U2, Madonna, and Michael Jackson put
 together? Written any decent songs lately? I mean, really! The notion 
that an artist of Springsteen's caliber can be reviewed is silly!”<br>
<br>
If jamming with Tom Morello on a bunch of castoffs and covers is good 
enough for Peter, then fine. But as a lifelong Springsteen fanatic, it’s
 not good enough for me—and more importantly, I don’t think it’s good 
enough for Springsteen himself. Telling The Boss he can do no 
wrong—pretty much the default critical position ever since he edged into
 elder statesmen territory around the turn of the century—is no longer 
doing him any favors. Age and accolades tend to breed complacency, but 
Springsteen’s signature as an artist has always been his ambition to 
make big, beautiful, transcendent albums—and the discipline to follow 
through. High Hopes falls short on both counts. Will I still listen to 
the CD, or at least to the tracks I like? Of course. But I think it’s 
unfair—to us as fans, and ultimately to Bruce—not to remind him that 
he’s at his best when his own hopes are a little higher.<br>

BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN<br>
High Hopes<br>
Producers: Ron Aniello, Brendan O'Brien<br>
Label: Columbia<br>
Release Date: Jan. 14<br>
<br>
"High Hopes" is Bruce Springsteen's 18th studio album. In a first for 
the artist, the record is a collection of cover songs previously 
performed live, originals never recorded in the studio and older songs 
dusted off and reanimated. Backing Springsteen on this release is the E 
Street Band -- including appearances by the late Clarence Clemons and 
Danny Federici -- as well as Tom Morello (The Nightwatchman, Audioslave,
 Rage Against The Machine). A press release also credits (but does not 
specify) "many additional players."<br>
<br>
Morello joined forces with Springsteen when he temporarily filled in for
 Steven Van Zandt during the band's 2013 Australian tour, when Van Zandt
 was away due to filming commitments for his Netflix Original 
series,"Lilyhammer." In the album's liner notes, Springsteen 
specifically credits Morello's influence on this record: "Tom and his 
guitar became my muse, pushing the rest of this project to another 
level. Thanks for the inspiration Tom." Indeed, Morello's fingerprints 
are all over the album, from the blistering, electrified rendition of 
"The Ghost of Tom Joad" and trademark solos in "American Skin (41 
Shots)" to his very definite contribution to the"Rising" outtake 
"Harry's Place." In total, his contributions appear on eight out of the 
12 tracks on the album.<br>
<br>
Although on the outside this might seem like an unlikely match, 
Morello's very familiar with and sympathetic to the repertoire because 
he is an enthusiastic, self-identified fan. His contributions feel 
inventive, versatile and natural, like an extension of the direction 
Springsteen was already moving in; he can attack the song in true 
Morello fashion, contribute tasteful rhythm guitar -- or a combination 
of the two. Importantly, he challenges Springsteen, both musically and 
emotionally. Morello's role in the E Street Band feels similar to that 
of avant-garde noise-monger Nels Cline when he joined Wilco.<br>
<br>
"High Hopes" was produced by Ron Aniello, with additional production 
credits going to former producer Brendan O'Brien on four of the tracks 
("Harry's Place," "Down In The Hole," "Hunter of Invisible Game," and 
"Heaven's Wall," the latter also shared with Aniello). Aniello's 
production work definitely enhances and does not distract from or 
obscure the tracks.<br>
<br>
Billboard's track-by-track review-<br>
<br>
1. HIGH HOPES - First recorded by Springsteen in 1995 and featured as 
part of the 1996 "Blood Brothers" DVD chronicling the E Street Band's 
studio reunion, this lively rockabilly track was originally written and 
performed by Tim Scott McConnell of the Havalinas. The ‘95 version was 
recorded as a more straight-ahead rocker with vivid vocal harmonies. The
 2014 studio version adds broader, richer instrumentation (due in no 
small part to the E Street Band's current 18-member roster [19 when you 
add Morello]) to the mix.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's voice is as much of a natural for this song as it was in 
the '90s, wrapping his distinctive baritone around the lyrics, which 
resonate with many of the themes touched on by Springsteen in his own 
material:<br>
<br>
Tell me someone now, what's the price<br>
I wanna buy some time and maybe live my life<br>
I wanna have a wife, I wanna have some kids<br>
I wanna look in their eyes and know they'll stand a chance<br>
<br>
The song is a perfect showcase for the full-power 2014 E Street Band, 
from the E Street Horns holding down the melody in the front, to the E 
Street Choir standing their ground in the back, notable piano work from 
Roy Bittan underpinning the tune alongside Springsteen's own acoustic, 
and then Morello's distinctive guitar leads and soaring solos on top of 
it all.<br>
<br>
2. HARRY'S PLACE - Recorded in 2002 with the E Street Band, this 
"Rising"-era outtake was one of two songs that didn't make that album's 
final cut. In an interview with Ted Koppel, Springsteen read some of the
 song's lyrics (which are pretty much identical from the version that 
made it onto "High Hopes") and shared that the song was left off the 
record because Springsteen didn't believe it fit thematically.<br>
<br>
Listening to the track now, it's easy to agree with Springsteen's 
assessment. The track's not lacking in quality, but it does touch on 
themes (deception, power, small-town secrets) that are covered on other 
"Rising" songs, and this particular story of the gangsters hanging out 
at "Harry's Place" would have taken the listener out of the very careful
 thematic arc that was constructed by Springsteen on that particular 
record. <br>
<br>
The element in "Harry's Place" that immediately grabs one's attention is
 the saxophone, which could not be played by anyone other than Clarence 
Clemons. His sound is distinctive and familiar, and its presence here 
creates a poignant reaction of recognition and regret in the listener. 
Then there's Morello's guitar work, which stands out in similar 
distinctive fashion throughout the entire track, weaving around the 
vocals and instrumentation. It's a less direct sonic attack than most of
 his other work on the record, but fits in seamlessly. <br>
<br>
3. AMERICAN SKIN (41 SHOTS) - "American Skin (41 Shots)" was written in 
2000 in response to the Amadou Diallo shooting in New York City, and 
came to most people's attention when Springsteen performed it during his
 tour-ending 10-night stand at Madison Square Garden. Critics of the 
song saw it as an attack on the New York City Police Department, and the
 MSG shows were briefly marred by boycotts and protests by the NYPD and 
the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. <br>
<br>
Although Springsteen gave no interviews regarding the song at the time, 
he later described the thought process behind the track in his published
 lyric collection, "Songs." "Though the song was critical, it was not 
‘anti-police' as some thought. The first voice you hear after the intro 
is from the policeman's point of view," Springsteen said. "...I worked 
hard for a balanced voice. I knew a diatribe would do no good. I just 
wanted to help people see the other guy's point of view." <br>
<br>
"American Skin" has reappeared in setlists in the years since in 
response to current events, such as a specific dedication to Trayvon 
Martin during a 2012 performance. Live, it's a song of tremendous power 
both vocally and instrumentally. While nothing can come close to the 
majesty of a live E Street Band building into the impassioned explosion 
on the bridge, and then later in its reprise, this version definitely 
does it justice. Tom Morello plays his part by matching the E Street 
Band's intensity with his solo, which is powerful, lyrical and 
expansive. It's easy to understand why Springsteen included this track 
when talking about the record in the liner notes, saying the songs were 
"among the best of my writing and deserved a proper studio recording." <br>
<br>
The track is further highlighted by some distortion on the vocals, 
straight out of the experimentation that was a highlight of the "Devils 
&amp; Dust" tour, where Springsteen worked with textures, instruments 
and techniques that were new and unusual for him. The addition of these 
elements to the studio version would be tricky live, but on record help 
set the tone and maintain the sonic spaces that allow the song to expand
 to its true emotive depth. <br>
<br>
4. JUST LIKE FIRE WOULD - Also emerging from the Australian tour, this 
number written by Chris Bailey of The Saints (who Springsteen states 
were one of his favorite early Australian punk bands) was performed once
 and then recorded as part of a mid-tour recording session in Sydney. 
Springsteen's rendition of the track as a straightforward rocker is 
mostly true, both emotionally and musically, to Bailey's original. It's 
another great snapshot of the 2013 E Street Band, with a definite horn 
presence (the mid-song solo is almost Beatles-esque) and classic Steve 
Van Zandt harmonies backing Springsteen. <br>
<br>
5. DOWN IN THE HOLE - Another outtake from the recording sessions for 
2002's "The Rising," the track opens with Patti Scialfa's distinctive 
harmonies, which continue throughout the song. Also of particular note 
is the organ solo carrying the unmistakable feel of the late Danny 
Federici. The track is sparse, haunting, and heart-rendingly evocative. 
Many of the lyrics and leitmotifs are directly or indirectly echoed in 
other tracks on the album, which might explain Springsteen's decision to
 omit it from the record back in 2002. <br>
<br>
6. HEAVEN'S WALL - Prior to "Wrecking Ball," Springsteen claimed he was 
working on a gospel album, which was never released. Two tracks -- 
"Shackled and Drawn" and "Rocky Ground" -- made it onto "Wrecking Ball,"
 and it certainly sounds like "Heaven's Wall" could have originated from
 that project as well, given the upfront choral vocal components and 
directly biblical lyrics. Tom Morello comes in toward the end, his 
guitar work -- both solo (including a too-brief exchange of riffs) and 
rhythm guitar -- is absolutely appropriate and very organic. It's a 
lively, fascinating, complex track and one of the standouts on this 
release.<br>
<br>
7. FRANKIE FELL IN LOVE - This song sounds like Springsteen taking the 
best parts of the Seeger Sessions Band -- the informality and looseness 
-- and working them into an original song for the benefit of the full 
range and talent of the core E Street Band. It's country-flavored 
without feeling contrived, poppy and swinging but very polished, and 
extremely memorable.  It's fun, it's playful, it should have been the 
first single and would be a natural, fantastic addition to the E Street 
Band's live repertoire.<br>
<br>
8. THIS IS YOUR SWORD - This track is a more traditional sounding 
number, incorporating many of the Gaelic elements of which Springsteen's
 become fond in recent years. "This Is Your Sword" is a straight-ahead 
ballad with strong vocals and powerful instrumentation -- with a banjo 
and some bagpipes hanging around, too. This is the only track on which 
Max Weinberg does not play drums; instead, that role is filled by 
veteran sessionman Josh Freese.<br>
<br>
9. HUNTER OF INVISIBLE GAME - A gentle, mid-tempo ballad, this track is 
an allegory filled with biblical imagery. It's similar in theme to a few
 of the tracks from 2012's "Wrecking Ball" but sonically has more in 
common with 2009's "Working On A Dream" and is likely an outtake from 
that project. Tom Morello has a guitar credit and his work integrates 
well with the rest of the instrumentation. Springsteen's voice draws the
 listener through the story of "travelers in the wasteland" (as he 
relates in the liner notes) with guitars, a rhythm section, some strings
 and backing vocals.<br>
<br>
10. THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD - In 2008, Tom Morello appeared onstage with 
the E Street Band for the first time, performing a hybrid version of the
 title track from Springsteen's 1995 acoustic solo album, which merged 
the ferocity of the Rage Against the Machine cover with the depth of the
 E Street version. Morello has performed this song with the band many 
times since then, and always appears to be inspired by being onstage 
with Bruce and the band -- and they meet his energy in kind. He trades 
verses and shares harmonies with Springsteen, and shines on both rhythm 
and lead, the latter of which features those now-distinctive 
modulations, blazing like rockets alongside the E Street Band.<br>
<br>
It would be tough to capture all of this on record, but they managed to 
do it and then some: loud, and fierce, with a raw musical power and 
emotion that hits right in the middle of one's chest. It is the most 
powerful and successful track on "High Hopes."<br>
<br>
11. THE WALL - Originally debuted live in 2003 and performed again in 
2005, this song is a tribute to childhood friends and fellow fledgling 
Jersey Shore musicians who went off to Vietnam and didn't come home, 
inspired by a visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Early versions of 
the track were heartfelt but uneven; the theme was clearly important to 
Springsteen, but the song definitely felt raw and unfinished in its 
limited live performances.<br>
<br>
Clearly, those issues have been resolved with the recording that made 
its way onto "High Hopes." Although the lyrics are essentially the same 
as they were when the track was first debuted, the performance is more 
intense because Springsteen's emotional focus feels solid and more 
centered. While his vocals are still the focal point of this track -- 
he's telling a story that's important to him -- the slight presence of 
the rhythm section and piano give the track depth and solemnity. Danny 
Federici adds a quietly powerful organ solo in the break, and both organ
 and trumpet (the latter adding a slight martial touch) lead the track 
to its end. <br>
<br>
12. DREAM BABY DREAM - Springsteen's translation of this track by Alan 
Vega and Martin Rev of NYC punk frontrunners Suicide first appeared 
during the 2005 tour supporting "Devils &amp; Dust." Supported by 
harmonium and tape loops, this dark, dense, electronic composition was 
transformed into a warm and heartfelt ballad, usually in the encore 
slot. <br>
<br>
The studio version of "Dream Baby Dream" is cleaner and more polished 
than in concert, but still embodies the emotion and expansiveness of the
 live performance. Springsteen played the more recent version of the 
track in November 2013 at the "Stand Up For Heroes" benefit in New York 
City, and the studio version was used as the soundtrack to an official 
'thank you' video released in October to thank Springsteen fans for 
supporting the 2012 &amp; 2013 "Wrecking Ball" tour.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and the E Street Band kick off 2014 by traveling to South 
Africa for the first time to perform three dates in Cape Town and one in
 Johannesburg in January, followed by 13 shows in Australia and New 
Zealand in February. There are no U.S. or European tour dates scheduled 
at this time.<br>

<br>
‘High Hopes’ is Bruce Springsteen‘s most disjointed album, and purposely
 so. Pulled together from various outtakes, cover songs and 
re-recordings from the past two decades, Springsteen’s 18th album is 
looser and less structurally sound than anything he’s released since 
becoming a star in the mid ’70s. And without something more sturdy to 
hang his music and lyrics on, ‘High Hopes’ is somewhat aimless.<br>
<br>
Not that there aren’t some strong songs scattered among the occasionally
 flimsy frames holding ‘High Hopes’ together. But chances are, you’re 
probably already familiar with the best of them. ‘American Skin (41 
Shots),’ originally written in 1999 and one of Springsteen’s best songs 
of the past 15 years, finally gets an official studio version after 
years of airtight performances onstage. Revived in the wake of the 
shooting death of Trayvon Martin last year, the song sounds even more 
angry now.<br>
<br>
Springsteen assembled much of ‘High Hopes’ during breaks on his 2012 
tour. Late E Street Band members Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici 
show up on a few songs from the vaults. So does Rage Against the Machine
 guitarist Tom Morello, whose presence on the album elevates 
Springsteen’s own guitar playing and performance at times. Their duet on
 the reworked ‘The Ghost of Tom Joad’ transforms Springsteen’s 1995 folk
 song from acoustic rumination to electric fury.<br>
<br>
But ‘High Hopes’ betrays its sketchy origins at times, especially its 
middle section, which is filled with forgettable songs that sound like 
leftovers from Springsteen’s string of ’00s records (it doesn’t help 
that the album unravels for almost an hour — way too long for an LP 
cobbled together like this one). For an artist who used to take 
frustratingly long times between projects, Springsteen sure has rushed 
them out over the past 10 years.<br>
<br>
Still, ‘High Hopes’ has the beginning and end of a more cohesive album, 
bookmarked by a pair of covers — the Havalinas’ title track, which 
Springsteen first recorded on a 1995 EP, and Suicide’s ‘Dream Baby 
Dream,’ respectively — that tear through the semigloss production (by 
Ron Aniello and Brendan O’Brien) found on the album. Along with 
‘American Skin,’ they’re ‘High Hopes” best tracks.<br>
<br>
The rest of it falls together, not as recklessly as you’d assume, with a
 usual mix of late-period Springsteen grandeur and self-importance. 
Occasionally the songs merit the musical and lyrical heft (‘Down in the 
Hole,’ ‘The Wall’); often, they don’t (‘This Is Your Sword’ and ‘Hunter 
of Invisible Game’ aim big but misfire).<br>
<br>
By the time the hazy, drifting ‘Dream Baby Dream’ brings ‘High Hopes’ to
 a fitting close, it feels like vindication for an album that’s often 
left wandering without the single-minded purpose that typically drives 
Springsteen’s records. It’s not necessarily an unpleasant stroll, but 
it’s one that nonetheless stumbles in its journey through the past.<br>

Some successful veteran rock musicians retire to the islands, never to 
be heard from again. Some become businessmen, others become producers of
 younger acts. A few even go into politics. Bruce Springsteen isn’t 
interested in any of that. What Springsteen wants is a pulpit. Since 
"The Rising," each new album brings him closer to church — and he grows 
more comfortable in the mantle of the wizened preacher, shepherding his 
flock between the twin poles of sin and salvation.<br>
<br>
Gospel was one of the cornerstones of "Wrecking Ball," the uneven but 
inspiring 2012 album that reinvigorated his muse and slapped him awake 
after the long sleepwalk of "Working on a Dream." From gospel, the Boss 
borrowed both the slow mount to musical epiphany and language that 
speaks of perseverance through hard times. The religious imagery that 
has always been part of his work found its fullest expression yet on 
this album, which answered the emotional emptiness of the economic 
downturn with a spiritual salve.<br>
<br>
"High Hopes," the fast follow-up and companion piece to "Wrecking Ball" —
 which will be officially released Jan. 14, but is now streaming for 
free on cbs.com/springsteen — further illuminates these themes. It’s 
misleading to say, however, that it expands upon them, because "High 
Hopes" is not designed to be a showcase of new material; it’s dominated 
by older songs of relatively recent vintage that have never found a home
 on a Springsteen album. It also contains three covers.<br>
<br>
It is testament to how well Springsteen has managed to stay on message 
over the past decade that "High Hopes" coheres anyway. Once again, both 
the music and the storytelling strain toward the exuberance and 
transcendence of gospel. Once again, Springsteen is the minister in the 
chapel, offering guidance, sympathy and, occasionally, a raised fist of 
solidarity with the dispossessed.<br>
<br>
Sometimes he preaches outright. "Heaven’s Wall," a minor-key rocker that
 begins with a gospel-inspired shout-along, is nothing but Biblical 
allusions, and suggests how deeply the Boss has had his nose buried in 
the Good Book recently. "This Is Your Sword" is a sermon framed by an 
old-school E Street Band arrangement. The atmospheric "Hunter of 
Invisible Game," which is redolent of the dust and grit of early Tom 
Waits, is a trip through Ezekiel’s valley of dry bones.<br>
<br>
Like any passionate religious leader, Springsteen calls out false prophets: The moody<br>
"Harry’s Place," a song that didn’t make "The Rising," casts the Devil 
as a drug dealer presiding over an empire of night. Those themes are 
further developed on "Down in the Hole," a lyric of desperation that 
draws connections between 9/11 rescue workers and coal miners; in it, a 
near-scriptural flaming hell opens beneath our feet to swallow a haunted
 man. Light versus darkness, bondage versus release, physical lust 
versus spiritual desire — these are the minister’s preoccupations. These
 elemental struggles have become the Boss’ preoccupations, too.<br>
<br>
He even does elegies. The twin pillars around which the rest of "High 
Hopes" has been arranged are eloquent lamentations. "The Wall," a ballad
 written in memory of the early Shore rocker Walter Cichon, is an 
example of what Springsteen still does better than any other mainstream 
rocker, and gives an indication of why he’s so revered in Nashville, 
too. His story is rich with carefully chosen details that amplify the 
emotional content and authenticity of the lyric. As he so often does, he
 gives his narrative a firm historical anchor and it’s immediately 
apparent he’s writing about real and consequential things: the legacy of
 the Vietnam War, Monmouth County in the 1960s, the camaraderie and 
competitiveness of youth culture.<br>
<br>
The pervasive sense of sadness and loss on "The Wall" is deepened by the
 phantom presence of the late Danny Federici, who decorates the song 
with an elegant, aching organ ride that, for all its simplicity, could 
have been played by no other musician. (Clarence Clemons, too, plays on 
several "High Hopes" cuts, but his contributions feel less meaningful.)<br>
<br>
The other meditation on death and loss is the best-known song here and, 
perhaps, the most controversial piece in Springsteen’s discography. 
"American Skin (41 Shots)" was written in blunt language in response to 
the police shooting of Amadou Diallo, and revived on the Wrecking Ball 
Tour after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the Florida neighborhood 
watchman who killed Trayvon Martin. The live versions of "American Skin"
 were fully embodied, and made Springsteen’s desire for justice manifest
 — but did not adequately prepare the audience for the 7 ½-minute 
hailstorm of grief and rage on "High Hopes." The song was something of a
 dirge in its original incarnation, but this rendition is anything but: 
It builds to a thunderous climax crowned by two sword-slash guitar solos
 by Tom Morello, already well known as a prince of agitprop from his 
work with Rage Against the Machine.<br>
<br>
Alas, as "High Hopes" proves, a little Morello goes a long way. He is 
featured on eight songs, and if you’re not sick to death of him by the 
end of the third, you’ve got a high threshold for flashy wah-wah and 
squealing Whammy-pedal six-string. His heavily affected sound — one 
designed to irritate as much as entertain — is an uncomfortable fit with
 the classicism of the E Street Band, and at times on "High Hopes," the 
clash of styles is all you can hear. Morello grabs "The Ghost of Tom 
Joad" by the hair and tortures him with an interminable solo that fits 
the dignified, Steinbeck-inspired character with an arena-rock headband 
and torn T-shirt.<br>
<br>
Morello's prominence means that "High Hopes" never feels quite as much 
like an E Street Band album as its rock arrangements suggest it should. 
This is a missed opportunity. The expanded version of the E Street Band 
that accompanied the Boss on the Wrecking Ball Tour was a fearsome 
outfit, capable of exposing hidden dimensions in older songs and 
breathing life into the sometimes-staid recorded versions of newer ones.
 (Morello was part of that expanded lineup during the Australian leg of 
the Tour.) Although this does feel more like a "band album" than 
"Wrecking Ball" did, and although the expanded group did participate in 
the recording sessions, it does not begin to tap into the full, awesome 
power of the flexible outfit that brought illumination to the Boss’ 
sermons.<br>
<br>
This is a known problem with preachers — often, they’re so wrapped up in
 their own message that they don’t realize the deacons have something 
meaningful to say, too. But there’s always next time. And at the pace 
Springsteen has been working, the next time is likely to come sooner 
than you’d think.<br>
<br>

<strong class="text-strong">ENTERTAINMENT  WEEKLY<br>
January 6, 2013</strong><br>
<br>
Back in 1995, Bruce Springsteen released The Ghost of Tom Joad, a 
minimalist folk album that seemed to signal the Boss' intention to step 
away from stadium-scale rock stardom for good. It was the type of 
narrative he might construct for one of his own characters: After 
blowing up and getting in over his head (see: the underwhelming 1992 
twofer Lucky Town and Human Touch), the small-town boy returned to his 
roots to start over.<br>
<br>
Joad also rekindled Springsteen's love affair with folk music, first 
explored on 1982's Nebraska. He's continually circled back to that 
passion, which has led him to his latest muse, Rage Against the Machine 
guitarist and protest-song revivalist Tom Morello. The bulk of High 
Hopes, Springsteen's 18th studio album, was recorded in the midst of a 
tour that found the man also known as the Nightwatchman filling in for 
longtime E Street axman Steven Van Zandt. High Hopes is a road record: a
 mixed bag of long-kicked-around live tunes, new takes on old ideas, and
 a handful of covers. On paper, the dissonance between Morello's 
alarm-call riffs and the fine-tuned E Street engine sounds ugly—and 
indeed, his faux-DJ scratching on ''Heaven's Wall'' and limp funkifying 
on ''Harry's Place'' are the album's nadir. But even those sins seem to 
invigorate Springsteen, as though Morello's nervy combination of 
Zeppelin-size swagger and Bomb Squad noise pollution has emboldened him.<br>
<br>
That influence is clearest on the album's two centerpieces: an official 
studio version of 2001's ''American Skin (41 Shots)'' and an epic 
rerecording of Joad's title track. ''American Skin,'' written in 
response to the infamous 1999 killing of an unarmed African immigrant by
 the NYPD, throbs with righteous indignation, while ''The Ghost of Tom 
Joad'' turns the original's reverent whisper into teeth-gnashing 
agitprop, with Morello handling lead-vocal duties. His bland intonations
 pale next to Springsteen's signature rasp, but he saves himself with 
blistering solos and a surgical sense of sonic escalation. High Hopes 
ends with an oddly fussy take on Suicide's classic post-punk lullaby 
''Dream Baby Dream,'' but it should have closed on ''The Wall,'' a 
bittersweet elegy for two friends who never returned from Vietnam. Over a
 delicate smattering of piano and accordion, Springsteen finds his inner
 Seeger, quietly sneering, ''I read Robert McNamara says he's sorry.''<br>
<br>
Songs about decades-old social injustices should make him sound out of 
touch, but High Hopes still crackles with immediacy, despite the 
cobbled-together nature of the material — ''American Skin,'' for 
example, was recently resurrected in honor of Trayvon Martin. Like most 
of his later work, High Hopes believes in the human spirit but also in 
the power of outrage. And that, like Bruce, the more things change, the 
more they stay the same. B<br>

To Bruce Springsteen, the extensive trial-and-error he was known for in 
the ’70s and ’80s must feel more like a luxury at age 63 than it did at 
27. “The light from the oncoming train focuses the mind,” he recently 
told Rolling Stone.<br>
Hence “High Hopes,” an album on which Springsteen eschews his legendary 
thematic perfectionism and instead revisits outtakes and discarded 
tracks from the last decade-plus, many of them with Rage Against the 
Machine guitarist and E Street Band understudy Tom Morello. The result 
is an album that undeniably rocks, but lacks the through-line that makes
 some of Springsteen’s albums so powerful and accessible.<br>
For this collection, you’ve got to meet Springsteen halfway: If you 
wanna play, you gotta pay. In the end, though, it’s worth the price, 
even if it takes a while to find that out.<br>
The title track, a cover of a late-’80s Tim Scott McConnell track, is 
sort of an inauspicious start — it takes good advantage of the 
percussion- and horn-driven sound the ESB perfected on the “Wrecking 
Ball” tour, but doesn’t say anything Springsteen hasn’t already said 
better himself. And “Just Like Fire Would,” originally by Australian 
rockers The Saints, is similarly superfluous — it may stand up well as a
 Jukes-ready barroom rocker, but it feels like a B-side in search of a 
single.<br>
As for Springsteen originals, the “Rising” outtake “Down In The Hole” is
 affecting, but its post-9/11 themes of loss and heartbreak, along with a
 familiar mournful organ line provided by the late Danny Federici, make 
it feel like it was extricated from that album and just grafted on here.
 As for “American Skin,” it’s just as striking as the live version, but 
ultimately feels vaguely unnecessary.<br>
The standout from the album’s first half is definitely “Harry’s Place,” 
Springsteen’s most vivid character study in years, about a badass 
small-time crime boss and the lives he ruins. It’s gritty as all get out
 — it’s the first Springsteen lyric to drop the F-bomb in a “sexually 
derived” context, as the MPAA would say — and it’s relentlessly cynical,
 at least for Springsteen: “If he didn’t exist, it’d all go on just the 
same,” the jaded narrator declares, and it’s a moment of icy brilliance.<br>
But when “High Hopes” hits the midway mark with “Heaven’s Wall” — a 
chugging Gospel shouter whose Biblical references lack the context of 
“Rocky Ground” or the romance of “I’ll Work For Your Love” — it’s 
feeling like the album might grind to a halt before it ever really gets 
going. Fortunately, on the second half Springsteen gets in a groove with
 a series of mostly stellar tracks that feel like part of a real album, 
not a collection of outtakes.<br>
It starts with “Frankie Fell In Love,” a sly, playful bouncer that pits 
Einstein against Shakespeare in a head-heart battle in which Al’s doomed
 from the start. The lyrics are both fun and funny — “From here on in 
we’re eating takeout, she ain’t gonna be cooking for the likes of us,” 
says the lovestruck heroine’s brother — and the vibe’s infectious.<br>
“This Is Your Sword,” a fatherly-advice song with a robust, 
Celtic-tinged arrangement reminiscent of much of “Wrecking Ball,” is the
 catchiest on the album. More importantly, Springsteen hits his theme of
 love’s redemptive powers with just the right mixture of sincerity and 
uplift, turning a potentially cheesy extended metaphor into an 
arena-friendly rallying cry.<br>
Even better is “Hunter of Invisible Game,” another allegorical track 
that tackles an aging man’s struggle with mortality and existential 
dread. It’s not as dark as it sounds: Blessed with a lilting melody and 
supple vocal work by Springsteen, it faces the battle with an underlying
 celebration of mature love’s importance in a crazy world — “I feel you 
breathing, the rest is confusion” — and of a life well lived. It’s 
moving and ultimately beautiful.<br>
The most striking song on the album, though, is “The Wall,” a wrenching 
monologue from a narrator still struggling with the loss of a friend in 
Vietnam. “This black stone and these hard tears, they’re all I got left 
now of you,” he says to his friend’s name inscribed on the Vietnam War 
Memorial. Sung elegiacally, more resigned than angry, the singer’s 
sorrow and helplessness are blisteringly visceral.<br>
Meanwhile, on the eight tracks where he’s featured, Morello’s guitar 
work provides a tough edge that sets the record apart from anything 
Springsteen’s done before. And for the most part, it works beautifully —
 it’s really the only raison d’etre for the studio version of “American 
Skin,” and adds a funky, wah-wah underworld vibe to “Harry’s Place,” 
counterpointing perfectly with the Clarence Clemons sax track laid down 
years ago.<br>
The only time Morello takes it over the top is on the reworked “Ghost of
 Tom Joad” duet, where the space alien machine gun sound effects he 
trotted out for the live version are recreated note for note, an odd 
choice for a studio track. Still, the raw power of his delivery suits 
the indignation behind the lyrics, still some of Springsteen’s best.<br>
The album ends with Suicide’s “Dream Baby Dream,” which Springsteen took
 to covering during the “Devils &amp; Dust” tour in 2005. It fares 
better than “American Skin,” even if it doesn’t deviate much from the 
previously released live version — Springsteen’s hypnotic take is 
somehow even more mesmerizing in producer Ron Aniello’s echoey studio 
soundscape.<br>
In fact, by the time that track draws to its haunting conclusion, you’ll
 likely find that despite the rocky start, the album’s familiar themes 
of hope, redemption and love’s ability to trump adversity have worked 
their magic the way they do on any good Springsteen release. The power 
and pleasures of “High Hopes” may not hit you like a wrecking ball — but
 that doesn’t mean they’re not there.</strong></div>

<em class="text-italics">A 54-Minute Conversation With Bruce Springsteen<br>
The legend speaks candidly about his process, collaborators, future projects and more<br>
<br>
<br>
By ANDY GREENE</em><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen doesn't do a lot of interviews, so when he called 
Rolling Stone recently, we decided to ask him not only about his new 
album, High Hopes, but about everything from his future touring plans to
 the status of the River box set and his long-awaited memoir to his 
thoughts on a Springsteen Bootleg Series. We've posted parts of this 
interview in recent weeks, but here is the complete 54-minute 
conversation. <br>
<br>
Listen to 15 insanely great Bruce Springsteen songs you've never heard <br>
<br>
You said that this album started as something else and morphed into this project. Tell me how it all came together.<br>
The best way to describe this album would be to say it’s a bit of an 
anomaly, but not that much.  I don’t really work completely linearly 
like a lot of people do. You have to imagine that at the end of the 
tour, or when I’m home, I go into a studio and I’m surrounded by 
paintings that are sort of half-finished. There’s something wrong with 
this one that I couldn’t finish and it’s just sitting there, and I 
didn’t have time for this one or this one didn’t fit into the bigger 
project I was working on. <br>
<br>
So I go into my studio where I’m surrounded by all my music that I 
haven’t released, and I wait to see what’s speaking to me. Imagine 
something like "The Ghost of Tom Joad." That was originally written to 
be on the Greatest Hits package we put out in the Nineties. It was a 
rock song, but I couldn’t come up with an arrangement, so it became an 
acoustic song. Because it became an acoustic song, I then wrote The 
Ghost of Tom Joad album that went with it. Then those songs got into our
 tour, acoustically. Then those songs got into our E Street touring set 
list and became rock songs. I sort of found some of those arrangements 
on the road while playing with the band. <br>
<br>
One thing leads to another, so they become part of our live show, but 
miss getting on the studio record because they didn’t necessarily fit 
with the sonic picture. So "Ghost of Tom Joad" ends up on this record as
 the rock song it was, perhaps, intended to be 15 years ago. That’s a 
pretty good idea of the way I go with these things.<br>
<br>
Read Rolling Stone's review of High Hopes<br>
<br>
And this isn't the first time you've worked like this.<br>
I’ve done it for a long time. If you go back to The River, "Sherry 
Darling" was done for Darkness on the Edge of Town. "Independence Day" 
was written for Darkness on the Edge of Town. There's always songs that 
hold over and that often move you to your next project, or sometimes 
not. They sort of sit in a limbo. That happens a lot. <br>
<br>
Before Wrecking Ball I was working on an entirely different record. That
 record is kinda sitting there at the moment, and I’m actually working 
on that record now. What happened is, I was missing a song for that 
record and so I wrote "Easy Money." "Easy Money" then turned into a 
10-day recording session where I wrote and recorded all the rest on 'em,
 a completely different album.<br>
<br>
"Wrecking Ball" had been in our tour set list. "Land of Hope and Dreams"
 was written for the E Street band when we got together in the late 
Nineties. I'm trying to give you an example of how all of this is very 
flowing and organic. I will also sit down and write 12 new songs or 
something, but as I’ve gone along and amassed a large body of both 
unreleased and unfinished projects, that happens strictly less and less.
 I’m sort of in the process of just working on what is speaking to me at
 a particular moment. That's very common for me right now.<br>
<br>
Tell me more about how this one began.<br>
I go in my studio where I’m surrounded by, hopefully, interesting things
 that I think that our fans might be [interested in] hearing, and I then
 proceed to work on them and see if I can bring something to fruition. 
Which is, for me, where I say, "Okay, this is something that’s focused 
enough and at a quality level where I think it won’t waste my fans' time
 and they will enjoy hearing it." That’s kind of the way that I work, so
 it sort of explains this group of music a little bit in the sense that 
it’s music that I’ve been working on over the past decade. Some of it 
was unfinished, so there was a lot of new recording on it.<br>
<br>
The addition of Tom Morello also changed your perception of these songs.<br>
Yes.  I was always trying to find a home for [these songs] and Tom came 
into our touring picture and suggested an obscure B-side from a band I 
loved back when I lived in Los Angeles in the Nineties, the Havalinas. 
He said, "'High Hopes.' That’s a jam. I could really do something on 
that." I said, "Okay, if you have suggestions when you come on the road,
 let me know what they are." So we worked that out, and with the 
addition of Tom, that turned into something. It was like, "Okay, we 
haven’t sounded quite like this before."<br>
<br>
We went in [to the studio] in Australia and recorded "High Hopes" there,
 as well as a cover of a Saints' song ["Just Like Fire Would"] we were 
playing in Australia that I’ve had on my radar for 20 years or so that I
 always liked. Then that sort of plugged into the rest of the material 
that I’d kind of had, once again, sitting by the side of the road, 
waiting to see if I can turn it into something that felt complete. I 
don’t know if that explains how a record like this is put together and 
how it doesn’t fit under the word of "outtakes." It’s the way I approach
 something.<br>
<br>
Don't miss 10 rare photos of Eighties-era Bruce Springsteen<br>
<br>
You have lots of material from the 1990s in the vaults too, right?<br>
I have a record that I’ve been listening to since 1994, which is a 
record I made while I was recording “Streets of Philadelphia.” I made an
 entire record similar to that record, where I was using drum loops. 
I’ve been listening to that for almost 20 years. There was something at 
the time that was missing, but sometimes somebody comes along and plugs 
in that missing piece, or I’ll pick it out sometimes every two or three 
years, and I’ll see if I have any fresh insights. And if not, I put it 
away, and if I do I may work on it a little bit.<br>
<br>
The best way to describe it would be I go in, I’m surrounded by all my 
stuff, and I have a lot of different types of works-in-progress in 
different genres, and some solo work. Some things feel more like they 
should be good for the band. Some things sit in the middle somewhere or 
it's something I’ve never done before. And it’s all just raw material I 
went in and drew from. <br>
<br>
I have a large body of raw material that I create from. Very often it 
might be a song or two, and then I write some. Even the music from 
Wrecking Ball – "Wrecking Ball" and "Land of Open Beams" – are things 
we’ve been playing. But I had "Shackled and Drawn," too. I had "Rocky 
Ground" from a film project somebody had asked me to work on from 
several years before that I wrote on a short stay in Florida. So they 
were sitting on my notebook.<br>
<br>
I’ll also go in my notebook where things wait until the time is right. 
This would be the way that I work today. I’ve had variations of it over 
the years, but I do a lot of writing, so you build up a greater body of 
unreleased work over time and you end up with just a repository of 
interesting things.<br>
<br>
I’m not in any rush. I’m not somebody who, if I write a song, I get it 
out. That’s not something I’ve ever really quite done. A few of the 
records. But I don’t have a problem writing something. . .Take the 
entire Devils and Dust record. After "Tom Joad" didn't work out as a 
rock song, it became an acoustic song. I cut the The Ghost of Tom Joad 
record while also cutting an entire album that was also a little more 
country-like at the same time. That became Devils and Dust. A lot of 
that album was cut alongside Tom Joad. All of these things are very 
fluid. They go in and out of one another. They feed one another. They 
spark one another. Songs that came out of one project may spark an 
entire other project. This is the way that I make my records today.<br>
<br>
How did Tom Morello's presence change the scope of the record?<br>
I was on the road and, just to amuse myself, I’ll have a computer filled
 with a lot of this music. Very often, if I have nothing to do late at 
night, I’ll bring it up and look at different bodies of music I have to 
be worked on. I guess if there was a common thread in this music it 
would be that most of it had been recorded over the past 10 years and it
 had, for one reason or another, not gotten on The Rising or Magic or 
Working on a Dream.<br>
<br>
I had music that was relatively current by my lights and had a similar 
sound-picture. They were modern recordings of the E Street band, which I
 credit to Brendan O’Brien as being the initiator of the modern sound of
 the E Street band on record. He was the guy that, when we went to do 
The Rising, I went down and cut two or three songs, came into the studio
 and immediately heard the band in a very fresh and different way. He 
kickstarted our recording career into another gear back in 2002, when we
 did The Rising. This is all stuff that's post-that event, post-his 
influence.  <br>
<br>
There was this certain common currency to its sound picture. I was 
interested in putting this material together in some form because, 
orally, it sounded like it fit together. So I had that music, and Tom 
came in and what he did was, he took that music and sort of jolted it 
into the now. He brings a complete sound picture with him. He's one of 
the few, few guitarists that creates a world by himself. It’s like, 
"Whoa." Edge does it. Obviously, Pete Townshend, Jimi Hendrix, the great
 guitarists. Different guys for different bands. Johnny Marr, the 
Smiths, had that ability. <br>
<br>
It’s funny. When Tom Morello’s up there, the E Street Band is a pretty 
big house. But he builds on another room. He builds on a room that 
hadn’t existed before. With that idea in mind – that I had another 
architect – I re-looked at the music that I had and said, "Let me run 
this one through Tom." So that’s what I started to do. His influence is 
very noticeable on maybe half the [tracks]. <br>
<br>
Tom's a very intellectually-inspiring guy. He has a lot of ideas. He’s 
very articulate about them, and very casual as we worked together. He 
has so much creativity. I’d just send him a track and he’d send me back 
four or five things that were just terrific. He was another way that I 
unified this particular group of material. He became a filter that I ran
 all of that music through, and he would send it back to me with a very 
current slant on it. I’m not sure if the record would exactly exist 
without his influence. He really allowed me to tie it all together, in a
 way that I’ve been looking for that I hadn’t found. He just really 
brought that stuff to life. <br>
<br>
Can you give me an example where he had a real big impact?<br>
I don’t have the set list in front of me, but "High Hopes" and "Harry's 
Place" and "Heaven's Wall" and certainly "American Skin" and "Ghost of 
Tom Joad." Those were two songs that I said, "Okay, these are two of my 
best songs that I’ve written over the past 10 or 20 years." And they 
didn’t have a formal presentation on a studio record. When that happens,
 a song always loses a little of its authority. There’s something about 
formally presenting it to your audience that I think makes a difference.
 <br>
<br>
I said, "I really want these songs. They need that sort of 
presentation." We went in and re-recorded those things with Tom, and his
 presence made a big, big difference. He obviously brings those things 
to great life and deepens them and deepens the characters. I realize 
I’ve spattered a lot at you, but this is sort of the way that this 
record occurred. Tom had a big, big hand in its existence. We also 
hadn’t really recorded together in a studio before. We’ve had so much 
fun onstage. It was a way of being like, "You know what? There’s 
material that exists, but it’s not fully-realized." He helped me realize
 those songs that he came in and worked on. Now this feels like a record
 to me. And now here we are.<br>
<br>
The first time you heard Rage Against the Machine, could you have imaged
 that guitar sound could have fit into your music and the E Street Band?<br>
No. Not immediately. But the E Street band casts a pretty wide net. Our 
influences go all the way back to the early primitive garage music and, 
also, we’ve had everything in the band from jazz players to Kansas City 
trumpet players to Nils Lofgren, one of the great rock guitarists in the
 world. Our ability to spread out – stretch out and gather things in 
from a lot of other areas you might not expect – is pretty good. <br>
<br>
My cousin Lenny [Sullivan] was a huge Rage Against the Machine fan and 
he said, “They did 'The Ghost of Tom Joad.'" I said, "Really?" But it 
sounds great. Then Tom came to a few shows, and he knows my sister in 
Los Angeles, and over a very long period of time we kinda became 
friendly.<br>
<br>
It was many, many years before we said, "Why don’t you come up and play?
 Let’s find something you can play on." In other words, "Let’s find a 
way to take what you do and take what I do, [and] let’s find the 
crossroads where they intersect."  I can remember, it was in Los 
Angeles, and he came up and played the “The Ghost of Tom Joad” and the 
place exploded in probably one of the loudest crowd responses I’ve heard
 in all the years we’ve been playing. It was just like something 
explosive happened. <br>
<br>
Is the version of "Tom Joad" something you worked out that day? It sounds pretty similar to what you guys cut on the new album. <br>
Yeah. That was something we worked out at the soundcheck that day. We 
probably played [the song] maybe two or three times at the soundcheck, 
and then played it live. And then if Tom came out, it became something 
we did together. So then it became, "Where does this lead? This is 
fascinating. It extends the power of the band. Where does it go?" That’s
 something that I’ve been thinking about for quite a while. And so this 
group of music was sort of  like, "Let’s put our feet in the water a 
little bit here and see what happens if we take that place where we 
intersect." It was kind of done very casually, and relatively quickly, 
but it was, once again, sort of just a place where lightning struck. 
We’re getting close to that place, and bang: lightning strikes. 
Something exciting happens and something expanding happens. That’s what 
he brings.<br>
<br>
Was there one point during the making of this record where you realized, "Yes, I have a record here?"<br>
Yeah. We cut a few sessions on the road and I said, "Well, these sound 
good." I said, "Okay, we’re taking it one step at a time. We have these 
fresh sessions of 'American Skin' and 'Ghost of Tom Joad' and 'High 
Hopes' and 'Just Like Fire Would' and then I have this body of work that
 I’ve been searching for the context for. These things blend together." 
Suddenly, it began to feel very fresh and fit together quite well. <br>
<br>
I had songs that I really liked. I had the song "The Wall" that I also 
thought was a really, really good song that just didn’t go on The Rising
 or the record that came after it, that I had been kind of holding. It’s
 funny, because Brian Fallon from Gaslight Anthem called just a little 
bit after we cut it saying,  "Hey, I’ve been thinking about cutting this
 song." And I said, "We just cut it for our next record."<br>
<br>
 That song was kind of out there under the radar, but it was just a song
 that meant a lot to me. If I keep working on things, they turn into 
something of their own. You may not meet the right person to finish 
something for a decade, or you may meet them tomorrow. An outgrowth of 
having a long career is that I have a lot of interesting things around 
that I get to revisit and, someday, get to the place where they become 
something that I want to do next. <br>
<br>
I want to go through some of the songs here. Tell me about "High Hopes."
 Tom said to me he heard the 1990s version on E Street Radio and texted 
you. <br>
Yeah. I think he was interested in it because it’s different, 
rhythmically, than what we’ve done. It’s got almost syncopation in it. 
If you listen in the back, there’s some James Brown-horns punched in 
once in a while. It’s almost a little New Orleans-y also. A little 
Latin-y, too. It covers a lot. I’m sure he’s hearing, "Hey, this is 
something I can really play over."<br>
<br>
Obviously, when Tom came to play with the band, I was interested in, how
 is he going to change the band? Because that’s going to be the fun 
part. He sat in for Steve in that period of time. He’ll need to change 
the band, and he will change the band in some way. How can I help him do
 that? And how can I get what I like out of it? So he suggested ["High 
Hopes"] and then we worked it up once again a couple of days before our 
first show in Australia and, of course, he had a very particular idea. 
And the live version of it, he even takes it further. When that guitar 
comes in, it’s just what you haven’t heard on the E Street record 
before. <br>
<br>
The Havalinas are a relatively obscure group.<br>
They were a great group that kind of went under the radar, but they were
 in Los Angeles and I always really liked them. They were kind of an 
acoustic rock group, with a standup bass player and mainly-acoustic 
guitar and a drummer, and I liked the way they sounded and what they 
wrote about.<br>
<br>
I was drawn to the song because it's very good lyrically without being 
sort of didactic or too direct. It's got a really good lyric about 
struggling. And also it’s got a great chorus. It’s got a fantastic 
chorus, which has a lot to do with it. <br>
<br>
Did you see them in concert when you lived in Los Angeles?<br>
No, I don't think I ever did. I had the albums though.<br>
<br>
"Down In The Hole" sounds like an outtake from The Rising to me. <br>
Yeah. Sometimes you end up with a choice between two things that you 
like a lot and I think I had maybe that and “Empty Sky."  The Rising had
 15 songs on it and it felt long enough. That’s basically as it was 
written and mixed at that time by Brendan. That’s sort of very original.<br>
<br>
Tell me about "Frankie Fell In Love." That has a very different feel than the rest of the album.<br>
That one was one of those songs that’s fun to write and might have come 
out somewhere around Magic. Then I recut pieces of it,  certainly the 
drums. Actually, I know what that was: that was a song I had that we cut
 for Magic and didn’t use the version that we cut. I also had a great 
demo of it. I have demos of most of these records that I make on my own,
 and once in a while you don’t beat one. That was one of those. I just 
loved it lyrically, and I thought that it’s a great thing for Steve and 
myself. It’s just a great little Faces-type rock song. I always had it 
sitting around as one of my favorite straight-up E Street Band rock 
songs, so we went in and did some new cutting on that with Steve and 
drums and bass.<br>
<br>
It really lightens the mood, since it's so euphoric.<br>
Well, by the time you get there. . . [Laughs] <br>
<br>
Tell me about "Harry's Place." It sounds like that takes place at a whore house or mobsters' den or something.<br>
That was my take on the Bush years.  That would have perhaps originated 
from Magic, because that was the record where I was writing about the 
last days of the Bush years. I had that piece, and it was another one of
 those things where it was that or something else. Then Tom came in and 
cut on top of it, and we remixed it and recut some things on it, and I 
just worked on it some more over the last few months.<br>
<br>
I recall you reading those lyrics to a reporter in 2002, though.<br>
I read them to Ted Koppel, I think. Oh, so if I had those in my book, 
maybe that must have been for The Rising. I had those lyrics at that 
time. It’s not uncommon for lyrics to sit in a notebook for a very long 
time sometimes. I might not know what to do with them, and then suddenly
 it’s there. So that song was a classic one that had a long gestation. I
 think, lyrically, I had it way back then. Musically, it's from 
somewhere in the mid-zeros, and then we recorded a lot of things freshly
 on it recently. It’s not an uncommon progression for some of my music.<br>
<br>
I wanna talk a bit about the production of the album. You used to favor a
 sort of minimalist production, but with the last two or three albums 
you've broadened out a bit. <br>
That would probably have to do with the producers: Brendan O'Brien and 
Ron Aniello. With Brendan, there's a real denseness to his sound picture
 and ideas.  I really liked him and made the recordings very intense and
 I think that’s what we were trying to reach. <br>
<br>
Through the Nineties, we lost our recorded intensity. What happened is, 
we went from being good producers in the 1980s to not very good in the 
1990s at producing our own material. We weren’t trying enough. We needed
 to interact with other people who were making records all the time and 
making a lot of modern records, and [have] our fingers on the way modern
 records were sounding. Which is not that different than records were 
sounding in the Seventies, actually.  <br>
<br>
It was a return to a lot of analog, and recording the bass and the drums
 on 24-track tape. It was a bit of a return. Those records actually, 
sound-wise, have something to do with a lot of the early records in the 
1970s. So they brought a particular sound picture. E Street was a big 
band, getting bigger all the time, obviously. And then when Ron Aniello 
came in to finish the record I was making before Wrecking Ball, there 
was just a lot of homework to do on it.<br>
<br>
Ron worked with Patti very well. I said, "Well, maybe this guy could 
come in and help me finish some of the homework on this record." Then he
 came in, and I was driving around trying to find a song to finish that 
project, and I came up with a song called “Easy Money.” And I ran back 
to the studio and he was there and we started to record it. When he 
started to record that, he brought out a whole different set of skills 
that really was just right for that sort of material and what I’ve been 
working on lately.<br>
<br>
He has a really vast array, a very big sound palette and sound picture. 
Very creative. I think Working on a Dream was probably our biggest 
production, but actually with Wrecking Ball, we pulled in lots of loops 
and things I hadn’t used previously on that degree on some of our other 
records. Like I said, I’m always looking for ways to extend and enhance 
the band on our records and when we play live.<br>
<br>
Recording while on tour is different than the way you usually approach 
making a record.Previously, everything was like when I was a kid and I 
need the peas to be on one plate and the corn had to be on another plate
 and I didn’t like them to touch. That was kind of where I was coming 
from in the stadium and everything was very segregated. Particularly 
when you first start, and you record A to Z, and you go out and you tour
 for two years. And I look back and, even then, it was a lot of music 
that overlapped. If you look at the early recordings of Born to Run that
 you can hear sometimes on satellite radio, there’s versions of them 
that sound very much like they came off of Wild and the Innocent. They 
are much more related to those songs, recording-wise. It was where I had
 the songs but I didn’t have the new sound idea yet. There’s lots of 
bridges and things that go from one project to another where places 
overlap. I forget what I was talking about.<br>
<br>
Talk about recording while on tour for the first time.<br>
That was just something we didn’t do. You played. You were excited. You 
weren’t going to go in a studio. You didn’t have the energy or the 
scheduling wasn’t right. We kinda got out there and we got excited and 
we had some time and I had this material that I thought was kind of 
sitting there waiting. I was in the middle of thinking about a lot of 
these songs together. Suddenly, I found a hook to really bring it to 
life and so, when I found that, I was anxious to go in and work on it. I
 believe [they were] the first recording sessions we ever did while we 
toured. It was fun.<br>
<br>
You cover Suicide's "Dream Baby Dream" on the album. You've been a huge fan of them for decades, right? <br>
Yeah. They are underground masters, to me. Just one of  the greatest. 
Alan Vega, one of the greatest. They should be in the Rock and Roll Hall
 of Fame, in my opinion. They are just amazing. I loved them, and they 
had an influence on Nebraska in a roundabout way.<br>
<br>
Fans got to see your rendition of "Dream Baby Dream" really evolve onstage during the Devils and Dust tour.<br>
That was always a song of theirs I deeply loved. When I went to do the 
Devils and Dust tour I decided to do it myself, just on my own. I 
thought to myself, "How would Roy Orbison sing this song?" What made 
Roy's music great is that it was so mainstream, but it had a very 
strange underbelly to it that David Lynch tapped into for his films. 
There's a place under there where they connected. I thought, "How would 
he approach this song?" So I kinda took it from there, and kinda 
connected it to my own work and my ideas and things I've written about. <br>
<br>
That was something I tried to cut in the studio and failed a variety of 
different times, but I always kinda had my eye on it and the song. And 
this was something that when the end of the tour came up and this song 
wasn't on the album, I thought, "Gee, it would be nice to do a thanks to
 the fans using this piece of music." I had cut some of in the studio, 
but I once again went back to it, re-recorded a lot of things on it, and
 it ended up being the piece we used on the "Dream Baby Dream" video. 
And it ended up on the record.<br>
<br>
Are you at all tempted to just hire Tom Morello as a full-time member of the E Street Band?<br>
I think right now we are just playing together when the opportunity 
arrises. We have a surfeit of great guitarists. Steve Van Zandt, the 
poor guy, doesn't get to play enough as it is with me hogging a lot of 
the solos. Steve has always been a fabulous guitarist. Back from the day
 when we were both teenagers together, he led his band and played lead 
and was always a hot guitar player. Of course, Nils is a guy with a 
world of his own at his fingertips. Tom, once again, does something else
 kind of on the instrument and something in his mind and who he is, he's
 a great addition and we're enjoying it as it stands. I'm excited that 
he's going to be out with us on our next stretch of the road.<br>
<br>
The fans in America really want to see this show. Do you think it'll be back here this summer?<br>
I don't know. It's not impossible. We're looking around to see what we 
might do. We're going to Africa and we're going to Australia. We had a 
few other select dates. . .a few in the States, sort of event shows. 
We're looking at it. I don't want to say "yes" because I don't want to 
disappoint, but I certainly don't want to rule it out too. We're looking
 closely at it. And there's places we missed on the last tour. As much 
as we played, we didn't get to Texas, where I love to play. We didn't 
get to Florida. There were some other places we didn't get on that 
entire tour. It might be fun to get back to some of those places.<br>
<br>
You said you're currently working on the songs you wrote prior to Wrecking Ball. Do you think that's your next album?<br>
I don't know. [Laughs].  The only thing in this entire conversation 
where I don't know exactly what I'm doing. No. I had a very – not 
complete – but a very developed group of sort of solo songs in a 
different sort of genre that I worked on for quite a long time previous 
to Wrecking Ball. When Wrecking Ball came along, first of all, with what
 was going on in the country, I wanted to get a record out right away. 
It really took precedence, and it was one of those records – similar to 
Nebraska or Tunnel of Love – it came out all at once in about ten days. 
Most of the new things did. At least the new ones did, and the ones I 
took from my notebook reshaped and re-formed themselves in a very short 
period of time. Then we worked on it together the way it was released.<br>
<br>
I'm always working on something. The one thing I've been lucky with is 
over the past 10, 15 years, I've done a lot of writing and I've had a 
very fruitful period of writing. That's the blueprint for anything you 
go do. It's the key to the currency of the band. On any given night, our
 show is half what I call "our new stuff," which is anything written 
over the past decade or so. We've been lucky to come up with a group of 
material that's meaningful to our fans, that they come and they want to 
hear. That's been something we worked hard at and thought hard about and
 I'm interested in continuing.<br>
<br>
There are so many live bootlegs that circulate through the fan 
community. Do you ever think about releasing some of them as a Bruce 
Springsteen Bootleg Series?<br>
Old concerts, I don't know. Do people need them anymore? [Laughs] Don't they just go on the Internet and find them? <br>
<br>
Fans want them in perfect sound quality and with some sort of official 
release, and you have very few live albums. Do you ever think about 
going back to that stuff?<br>
I go back to stuff all the way to before I recorded. I had a whole other
 career as a heavy-metal guitarist [big laugh] that never came out on 
record anywhere. But there's tons of music. If you go on YouTube, there 
is actually quite a bit of it there. And I had a prog band [laughs], 
basically. I mean, Steel Mill was a heavy-metal, prog-rock, blues-based 
classic, sort of late-1960s, early 1970s four-piece unit. We made a lot 
of music. [Laughs] I never close the door on any of it. I suppose it 
would be nice to get some of the classic concerts that have kept 
people's interest over the past 20, 30 or even 40 years and maybe 
formalize them in some way. That's not off the drawing board either. 
It's all there.<br>
<br>
Are you thinking about a Tracks 2 at any point?<br>
Once again, it comes up against the time you have. One of the things 
we're looking at is a River project, sort of similar to the one we did 
with Darkness. It depends on the material that's around and what it 
needs. On Darkness, we were able to release a lot of the Darkness 
material that hadn't been released up to that point. That was fun to do.<br>
<br>
There's just a lot of things. I kinda keep all these things wide open. 
I'm in search of the context for different things to be released, and 
what feels right, timing-wise. What feels like it'll be interesting to 
your fans at a certain moment, or what feels like you need to do at a 
particular time. Or it's just interesting to you. This is all the way 
that I work now. It involves all of these things and all of these ideas,
 going on all of the time. [Laughs] <br>
<br>
It's interesting that you took off nearly seven years between Tom Joad 
and The Rising, but now you're clearly working at a much faster pace. <br>
It's the old story that "the light from the oncoming train focuses the 
mind." [Laughs] There's a little bit of that, in [that] you go, "I have 
all this material, and I sort of released less than I would have liked 
to." It did focus the music well. Certainly, in the 1990s, I look back 
and think, "Sometimes I'm not satisfied completely with something. 
Sometimes that's not necessarily a reason to not release it." There are 
things that are just interesting on their own and they come out on their
 own terms. But when I get down to biting the bullet, I always go, "If 
it's not enough for me, it's not enough for my audience." <br>
<br>
You have different levels of sensitivities about these things at 
different times. I think in the 1990s, I was really trying to refine 
myself. Was I an acoustic act now? I wasn't working with the E Street 
Band? How am I going to carry on? Do I have a way to make the band 
current and relevant for the times we were in? I was trying to answer 
all of those questions that were sort of stewing in the 1990s. <br>
<br>
Then, coming across "Streets of Philadelphia" and "Ghost of Tom Joad" 
kind of led me back to some topical writing, which really lead me back 
to the band, which was a place where that writing expands and reaches 
the greatest audience. So it's all sort of. . .It's like anything else. 
There are some slower periods, highs, lows. It's not linear work.<br>
<br>
But you see a train coming towards you?<br>
Don't you? How old are you? [Big laugh]<br>
<br>
Thirty-two.<br>
[Laughs] Oh. You don't see it yet! But it's coming! [Laughs] <br>
<br>
Are you still working on that book?<br>
I'm done some writing. That kind of began with the little essay I wrote 
about the Super Bowl that we posted online. I thought, "That's an 
interesting voice." I wrote a little bit more using that voice. And I 
wouldn't call it a book yet. [Laughs] It's writings, miscellaneous 
writings. <br>
<br>
On that River box set: are you making a documentary to go along with it?<br>
The Darkness blueprint was really nice, but it depends what you have. 
With Darkness we both found a great old concert and we cut the thing 
again in Asbury Park with just the band, and there was a lot of music, 
much more than I ever thought I had, unreleased. A lot of it depends on 
what you have when you go back in the vault and you start to see what 
was around from that period of your work life. That sort of shapes the 
project and shapes how it's presented. I'm kind of going record by 
record, a little bit. That's something we're working on. If we have 
enough, it'll happen. If there's not enough there, then it wouldn't. <br>
<br>
Your first two albums still aren't remastered.<br>
Yeah. It's something between your work and your home life. Maybe I need to delegate a little more. [Laughs]<br>
<br>
Back to the tour, you sound like you think there are more American dates coming this summer… <br>
I don't wanna say because I don't want to disappoint. But we're playing 
in Africa. We're playing in Australia. Then we're possibly doing some 
more playing. It would be nice to get back in the States if it seemed 
like it was going to work out for everybody involved.</div>
