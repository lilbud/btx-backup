Sarfraz Manzoor<br>
This was arguably the most astonishing Bruce Springsteen concert I have ever seen, writes Saf Manzoor.<br>
<br>
We can’t say we weren’t warned. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band 
walked onto the stage of Wembley Stadium, returning to a venue they last
 played 25 years ago this month, and launched straight into Land of Hope
 and Dreams. Springsteen usually includes that song in encores – it was 
the first sign last night was going to be special – and it was: this was
 arguably the most astonishing Bruce Springsteen concert I have ever 
seen.<br>
In recent years Springsteen’s British stadium shows have been guilty of 
being somewhat predictable but last night was different: three songs in 
and Springsteen approached the crowd, collecting signs with requests. 
The rarely played Save My Love was followed by Rosalita (Come Out 
Tonight), This Hard Land and a stupendous Lost in the Flood featuring 
Roy Bittan’s gothic piano playing and searing guitar from Springsteen.<br>
Wembley had been transformed into a giant Springsteen jukebox – all bets
 were off as to what he would play next. "We can keep on taking 
requests," Springsteen said, "or we can play the entire Darkness on the 
Edge of Town record." Naturally the audience went bananas. It was the 
first time a British audience has been treated to Springsteen performing
 an entire album and from the fiery intensity of Adam Raised a Cain to 
Max Weinberg’s menacing drums on Something in the Night to Nils Lofgren 
spinning on one foot while playing the guitar solo during Prove it all 
Night with his teeth it was breathtaking.<br>
The audience were about as jubilant as it was possible to be considering
 they were hearing 10 songs streaked with anger, despair and 
desperation. And then it was back to the jukebox – the whole stadium 
singing Waiting on a Sunny Day back to a grinning Bruce. The man is in 
indecently good shape for someone who will be 64 in September. I looked 
around at the crowd, many of whom looked like they weren’t even born the
 last time Springsteen was at Wembley. The youthful enthusiasm of the 
audience had clearly affected Springsteen – even Born to Run, which he 
sings every show, felt newly urgent. Dancing in the Dark prompted a 
sprouting of beautiful young women – standing on friends' shoulders 
waving placards begging Bruce to dance with them. "One Dollar to Dance 
with my mum" read one sign, complete with dollar note. That did the 
trick. The last time Springsteen played London was the night of the Hyde
 Park shutdown – he and McCartney had the power pulled during Twist and 
Shout. This time we heard the full song followed by an emotional 10th 
Avenue Freeze-Out with tributes to lost comrades Clarence Clemons and 
Danny Federici and then just as it seemed like it was all over he had 
one final surprise – Thunder Road, Springsteen alone on stage, his voice
 echoing around the stadium. And with that he was gone. As he left the 
stage I saw a girl with a sign – not a song request but a statement. It 
read: "Thanks for making our lives better."</div>

Music OMH<br>
15 June 2013<br>
by Daniel Paton <br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen, as is so often the case, appears to have a job to do.
 In spite of the usually epic duration of his live shows (on which point
 this first visit to the new Wembley more than delivers), he’s not 
wasting any time. Dressed, as always, all in black, the E Street Band 
launch straight into Land Of Hope And Dreams, a longstanding live 
favourite reimagined for the Wrecking Ball album, and a song more 
familiar from the home stretch of their sets. It sounds terrific, full 
blooded, rousing and relentlessly intense. It’s not exactly subtle, but 
then subtlety is hardly what people queue for days in advance of 
Springsteen shows expecting. They want their moods elevated, their 
spirits raised and their lives transformed.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s great skill as an artist is that he is able to do this 
whilst also challenging his audience. Tonight, he’s on particularly 
daring form, particularly given the sheer size of the Wembley audience. 
The first portion of the set is liberally sprinkled with rarities, 
including Jackson Cage, which still sounds like a palpable howl on 
behalf of the downtrodden. He then runs to the lower stage, taking sign 
requests from the pit much earlier than is usual. There are some 
inspired choices – including a lovely Save My Love (an outtake from 
Darkness On The Edge Of Town later released on The Promise), an 
intensified Lost In The Flood and a compelling reading of This Hard 
Land. There’s also a fantastically uplifting Rosalita (during which 
Springsteen, guitarist Steve Van Zandt and saxophonist Jake Clemons 
gather together on the small podium stage within the crowd in the first 
of many moments of camaraderie).<br>
<br>
The Wrecking Ball Tour has become one of Springsteen’s longest and most 
hyped tours of his career, and it returns to the UK in a very different 
form from last year’s shows. There are only a handful of songs from 
Wrecking Ball itself. Mostly gone are the moving elegies to missing band
 members Danny Federici and Clarence Clemons. Also mercilessly dispensed
 with is much of Springsteen’s legendary testifying to the audience. 
This is one of the most no nonsense shows he has given in some time.<br>
<br>
This is because of the tour’s new purpose – a celebration of the core of
 the band’s catalogue and performances, with one of the classic albums 
aired in full. Tonight, London is lucky enough to get Darkness On The 
Edge Of Town, perhaps Springsteen’s greatest long form achievement, an 
album on which he drew deep from the well of human experience and 
sadness. It’s not exactly the obvious choice for a stadium show – many 
had expected a revisiting of Born In The USA, the album most closely 
associated with the old Wembley, but Springsteen’s return to his back 
catalogue is never about mere nostalgia. It is more a celebration of the
 timelessness and undiminished authority of these songs – and these 
songs of darkness and defiance are among his very best.<br>
<br>
Tonight, the band perform these songs with a sense of dignity and 
responsibility. Badlands remains an audience participation favourite, in
 spite of its rather different context in this show, but Adam Raised A 
Cain raises the intensity levels to fever point, with Bruce taking an 
explosive guitar solo and singing in impressively gutsy style. Something
 In The Night is beautiful and greatly enhanced by the presence of the E
 Street Horns (otherwise under-used during this section of the show) 
whilst Candy’s Room retains all of its lusty drive. A moment of genuine 
poignance comes with Racing In The Streets, its glorious extended coda 
(on which Roy Bittan stretches out brilliantly on piano) perfectly 
encapsulating the E Street sound and ushering in a beautiful sunset (the
 weather mostly holds out after the shower of Biblical proportions that 
drenched the queue).<br>
<br>
The second half of the show offers the chance for fans to hear more live
 rarities. Factory is melancholy and controlled, whilst Streets Of Fire 
has an urgency and power. Then there is the inevitable double whammy of 
two of his best songs – a typically storming Prove It All Night (sadly 
played without the ’78 intro), on which Nils Lofgren is allowed his one 
moment of show-stopping virtuosity, an excoriating solo complete with 
teeth and 360 degree spins. The album’s brilliant title track concludes 
things with convincing soul and fire.<br>
<br>
This being a Springsteen show, there is of course much more still to 
come. The home stretch sees Bruce cut loose and work the crowd a little 
more. For the most part, this is standard set list, but anyone 
unfamiliar with the E Street experience would no doubt have taken a lot 
of joy from Bruce’s energy and conviction. There’s a mass singalong 
during the intro to Shackled And Drawn (which also features a strong 
vocal from Cindy Mizelle), and the young boy picked from the audience to
 sing Waitin’ On A Sunny Day does such a creditable job that he earns a 
ride on Bruce’s shoulders – no doubt a very special and unforgettable 
moment for him. It all finishes with a vigorous run through Light Of 
Day, a song Springsteen wrote for Joan Jett and which features yet 
another character driving in search of escape from the burdens of life.<br>
<br>
The encores start with Pay Me My Money Down from the Seeger Sessions 
project, before which Bruce promises the audience they will all be 
dancing “in about 30 seconds”. This demonstrates the versatility of this
 configuration of the E Street Band, and gives the brilliant horn 
section a moment of limelight. There’s the usual blast through Born To 
Run and a requested Bobby Jean which ensures that Born In The USA is not
 completely ignored. Dancing In The Dark receives its inevitable airing,
 made a little more special this time by Bruce’s honouring of some 
requests. One girl has travelled “all the way from San Siro to Wembley 
to dance with Steve”, and she is duly plucked from the audience to join 
the band on stage. An audience member’s offer of “$1 to dance with my 
Mum” is also gleefully accepted.<br>
<br>
Tenth Avenue Freeze Out then thankfully reminds us of the band’s grit 
and soul, and offers a chance to pay tribute to Clarence Clemons, 
although this moment has sadly been curtailed from previous shows. This 
looks as if it will be the end of the show, as the band form a line to 
accept the richly deserved ovation, but then Bruce says “Shall we do it?
 The plug might be pulled…” and they launch into Twist And Shout, during
 which they were famously cut off during last summer’s Hyde Park gig. 
That’s still not it though – the band leave the stage and Bruce offers 
one beautiful parting gift, a solo acoustic version of Thunder Road with
 just guitar, voice and harmonica. It is a moment to treasure and a 
moving end to an epic, brilliant performance. It also yet again busts 
the curfew, making the show 31 songs in three hours and 10 minutes.<br>
<br>
One young woman brandishes a sign that reads ‘Thank you to making our 
lives better’ (sic). This is exactly what the E Street Band do for so 
many people, and have been doing night after night for 28 years. 
Speculation on the internet is rife as to the future of the band. 
Springsteen has recently said in interviews that he hopes his next 
project will be something along similar lines to the Seeger Sessions 
(albeit hopefully with original material this time) and many now 
seriously suggest this may be the final E Street Band tour. He will be 
back in London in a few weeks for Hard Rock Calling and there are a few 
more dates in Europe. But what after that?</div>

<br>
The Wrecking Ball Tour thunders on. It began in March 2012 and doesn’t 
seem to be stopping anytime soon. But far from showing any signs of 
complacency or fatigue, Bruce Springsteen and his E Street Band were 
locked into a hallowed performing zone as they returned for the first of
 another series of mega-shows in Britain. Leading his 17-strong band on 
stage in broad daylight at 7.20pm, Springsteen poured himself with 
unremitting intensity into a show that lasted for more than three hours 
without a break. Folksy yet larger-than-life, grandiloquent yet 
profound, humble but always The Boss, he managed to combine the 
necessary giant spectacle with something that still felt personal and 
meaningful.<br>
They began with a mighty rendering of Land of Hope and Dreams, a mission
 statement as much as a song. “Faith will be rewarded,” Springsteen 
sang, his mighty, road-battered voice reaching out to the huddled, 
swaying masses like a preacher sermonising on the world’s biggest soap 
box. Next thing, he was down in the front rows, grabbing signs held up 
by fans requesting particular songs. The band played several of these - 
Save my Love, Rosalita (Come out Tonight), Hungry Heart and others - 
their only warning being when Springsteen held up the chosen sign.<br>
The middle section was a sensational performance in full of his 1978 
album, Darkness on the Edge of Town, introduced as “still at the centre 
of who we are and what we do”. Among so many moments to treasure, Roy 
Bittan’s surging, staccato piano outro at the end of Racing in the 
Street was perhaps the most wondrous.<br>
After a string of hits including Born to Run, Dancing in the Dark and a 
joyful cover of Twist and Shout, it ended with a sweat-soaked 
Springsteen, alone on the stage with his acoustic guitar and harmonica, 
singing Thunder Road, at once melancholy and exultant. Simply 
magnificent.</div>

New York police want to boycott 'the Boss'<br>
<br>
Martin Kettle in Washington<br>
The Guardian, <br>
Tuesday June 13 2000 </strong><br>
<br>
His New York concerts have sold out - but Bruce Springsteen certainly 
hasn't. So much so that the police officers' union wants members to 
boycott the Boss because of his new song about a police killing.<br>
The song, American Skin, does not mention Amadou Diallo by name. But the
 repeated line "41 shots" leaves no room for doubt that its subject is 
the killing of the unarmed West African immigrant by New York police 
officers in February 1999.<br>
<br>
Four white NYPD officers fired 41 shots at Diallo in the entrance to his
 Bronx block of flats. The four were acquitted earlier this year, after 
claiming they thought that a wallet the dead man was reaching for was a 
gun.<br>
<br>
As Springsteen and the E-Street Band began a 10-night run in New York 
last night, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the main NYPD union,
 has urged members to boycott any duties during the concerts and not to 
attend as paying guests. The president of the Fraternal Order of Police 
called the singer "a dirtbag".<br>
<br>
Springsteen's song, not yet recorded, opens with eight repetitions of 
the line "41 shots". The chorus runs: "Is it a gun? Is it a knife? Is it
 a wallet? This is your life. It ain't no secret. The secret my friend, 
you can get killed just for living in your American skin."<br>
<br>
"I happen to like Springsteen," New York police officer Orlando Vega 
told the New York Daily News yesterday, "but we're trying to work in the
 community, and him opening up old wounds just makes our jobs more 
difficult".<br>
<br>
Diallo's mother has said she wants to meet Springsteen to thank him for 
keeping her son's case in the public eye. Since the acquittal, the 
Diallo killing has largely disappeared from the front pages and has 
barely figured in the Senate election battle between Hillary Clinton and
 Rick Lazio.<br>
<br>
"The anger is nowhere and nothing is happening," the veteran New York 
columnist Jimmy Breslin wrote on Sunday. "At the last hour, only Bruce 
Springsteen comes in to remind this city of its duty never to forget a 
horror."</div>

				<div class="content">Greetings From Asbury Park New Jersey<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen lived here, and played the local bars. Ed Vulliamy goes in search of the Boss's spiritual home<br>
 Sunday 16 May 1999<br>
<br>
Even without Bruce Springsteen, Asbury Park has history. Long before 
Springsteen named his first album after the place and took its mythology
 as his own, it was a blue-collar holiday Mecca. Billie Holiday 
performed here. So did Sinatra, the Marx Brothers, The Who, the Rolling 
Stones. The beer joints were packed. On a summer Saturday, there was 
barely anywhere to sit on the beach.<br>
Now, Asbury Park, on the New Jersey coast line, is Ghost-Town-sur-Mer. 
Take the casino: a fine 1920s iron-and-glass edifice where Bill Haley 
used to play. Only 10 years ago, Springsteen purists were worried about 
plans to turn this treasure into a Hard Rock Café and state-of-the-art 
recording studio. They needn't have worried. It's now bolted shut.<br>
<br>
Take the 'Palace Amusements' arcade, until recently home to the Asbury 
Park Rock and Roll Museum, the walls of which were lined with 
Springsteen memorabilia: the psychedelic sign from the Upstage club 
where he first played; rare photos of his old band, Steel Mill. Now the 
sign made famous on Springsteen's videos of the Palace arcade reads only
 'PA A E AMUS EN', though you can still just about make out 'Tunnel of 
Love' (it was an album and song title - the video was shot here). The 
Park Cinema ('PAR CINE A') is still open, showing 'adult matinees', with
 a man at the door who wears a toupee and looks like a character from 
Nightmare on Elm Street. I try to start a conversation. 'You wanna see 
the girl-show or stay out?' is all he will say.<br>
<br>
The story of the decline of Asbury Park is also the story of the death 
of the kind of blue-collar America about which Springsteen has always 
written. At the close of the Sixties, when Springsteen started playing, 
the Jersey Shore had its own anti-heroic, all-American identity, which 
spawned a humming rock'n'roll scene. You could call it Liverpool's 
cousin - it had all the same hallmarks: a seafaring tradition, a history
 more lambent than its present, high unemployment, the ridicule of the 
metropolitan elites - and a fierce urban pride.<br>
<br>
Lennon and McCartney had Penny Lane and the Magical Mystery Tour; 
Springsteen had Asbury Park's Broadwalk and the Backstreets. Springsteen
 arrived in Asbury Park during 1967, the summer of love. 'This was no 
idyllic Big Sur landscape,' remarks Springsteen's biographer David 
Marsh, 'but for anyone with a taste for tackiness, for connoisseurs of 
junk-food America, Asbury Park scored as paradise.'<br>
<br>
The Upstage Club was the magnet for 'shoreside musicians', with two 
sessions a week - one running from eight till midnight, and a second 
from one till five in the morning. Writing the notes to a debut album by
 Southside Johnny (one of the shore gang), Springsteen described what 
the Upstage was all about: 'Everybody went, because between one and five
 in the morning you could play pretty much whatever you wanted and if 
you were good enough you could choose the guys you wanted to play with.'<br>
<br>
Springsteen was good enough. 'It was a great place,' he continues, 'you 
could work it so you'd never go home by the time you got out of there 
it was dawn and you could just flop on the beach all day, or you could 
run home before it got too light, nail the blankets over the windows and
 sleep straight through till the night.'<br>
<br>
The Upstage is now home to OK Shoes, run by Mr Chang. Mr Chang has never
 heard Bruce Springsteen's music. He declines a guided tour. 'You want 
to buy it?' he asks. Calvin Morris is buying basketball shoes at OK. He 
was never much of a Springsteen fan, but he remembers the days, and 
misses them. 'It was cool. The place was full of people. The chicks were
 loose, you know? This guy [Springsteen] did a lot of good for this 
town. He put this town on the map - but really we was off the map 
already. The bad stuff had started while he was already here It's never
 been as bad as it is now - never'. Calvin lost his job at the local 
telephone company two years ago. The basketball shoes he wants are too 
expensive.<br>
<br>
Things started to go wrong here in 1970, when the shadow of the Watts 
riots moved over Asbury Park. Whole quarters of Asbury Park burned to 
the ground, including the downtown shopping district. Steve Van Zandt, 
guitarist in Springsteen's embryonic E Street Band, said later that the 
Upstage scene 'went right down with it'. The band was reduced to playing
 for a dollar a set. In 1971, with Asbury Park's reputation in shreds, 
the Upstage closed. Van Zandt got a job building roads.<br>
<br>
Springsteen went off to Greenwich Village to play solo with his acoustic
 guitar. There he met John Hammond, who had signed and produced Billie 
Holiday, Bessie Smith, Aretha Franklin and the man known as his 'folly',
 Bob Dylan. And now, at the behest of Springsteen's agent Mike Appel, he
 sat listening to a scrawny guy from the Jersey Coast singing 'It's Hard
 To Be a Saint In the City'. Hammond thought he was signing a folk act; 
instead he got a gale-force band which recorded Greetings From Asbury 
Park in three weeks. Then came The Wild, The Innocent and the E Street 
Shuffle and then Born To Run. But Springsteen kept a foothold in Asbury 
Park.<br>
<br>
It's a barely noted irony, though, that almost all of Springsteen's 
songs about Asbury Park are founded on the characters' desperate desire 
to leave. On 'Sandy (Asbury Park, Fourth of July)', the singer expresses
 his fear that he could get stuck on an ever-spinning fairground ride. 
Three years later, on 'Thunder Road', he declares baldly: 'It's a town 
full of losers and I'm pulling out of here to win'. While Springsteen's 
songs may romanticise the Shore, they are really about trying to escape 
it. It's hardly surprising that Springsteen himself eventually flew the 
nest.<br>
<br>
In the summer of 1974, a new club opened up - the Stone Pony - looking 
for a band who would draw crowds on a regular basis. That band, made up 
of Springsteen's entourage, came to be called the Asbury Jukes, led by 
'Southside' Johnny Lyon, and hosted, whenever he came off the road, by 
The Boss himself.<br>
<br>
The Stone Pony came to be known as The House That Bruce Built. During 
one winter stretch in the early Eighties, he played there virtually 
every Sunday. It was from here that the Born in the USA tour was 
launched into the world's stadiums. Its finest hour arrived on 26 
September 1992, when Asbury's four most famous sons - Springsteen, Jon 
Bon Jovi, Van Zandt and Southside Johnny - played together on stage for 
the only time. Less than a week later, the Stone Pony was declared, as 
its manager Lee Mrowicki, said, 'stone broke'. Now, the stage in the 
locked building is dark and lifeless. The walls of the club are peeling.
 The 'We Are Open' sign reads 'AR OPE'.<br>
<br>
Asbury Park is caught at a confluence of difficulties. Better incomes 
for more people meant that more people could take holidays beside the 
turquoise ocean in Florida, rather than on Jersey's chilly, polluted 
shore. The gambling and casino business lost out to heavyweight 
developments in Atlantic City. First, the white middle class began to 
leave. Then the black middle class followed them. Crime boomed. It is 
the same story told all over small-town industrial America.<br>
<br>
There was a plan a decade ago to build a row of vast sea-front 
condominiums called Ocean Mile, selling at around $135,000 each. The 
sepulchral edifices of this plan, abandoned halfway through construction
 in 1992 when the developer went bust, now loom over the ghosts of the 
Broadwalk. 'The only people who got rich were the lawyers,' says Rita 
Marano, owner of the Kingsley Avenue Deli.<br>
<br>
Some 20 per cent of Asbury Park's population now receives some kind of 
state assistance. Unemployment runs at 18 per cent, in contrast to five 
per cent across the county. But a few people clung on. Big Danny 
Gallagher was one of the pivotal figures on the Jersey Shore scene, an 
Irish-Amercian who was Springsteen's room-mate 'from 10 August 1972 
until the end of summer 1973', later his road manager. Gallagher stayed 
on The Shore long after Springsteen had left, but eventually he too 
departed for his native Dublin. He wrote a song about the decline of 
Asbury Park - 'Summertime in My Hometown', and now has this to say: 
'Before I left Asbury Park I had big thick curtains, because I didn't 
want to look out of the window. I'd hear gunshots late at night. My 
landlord's car had bullet holes in the headrest from two idiots who were
 shooting up the front lawn. I started thinking: "How long am I going to
 be on the planet? This is where I live. Beirut, New Jersey."<br>
<br>
Still, there was only one place, really, that Springsteen and the 
reunited E Street Band could choose to launch the tour which rolls into 
London this week. The concert in Asbury Park happened on 19 March. 
People with tickets they had bought for $20 were turning down offers of 
$1,000.<br>
<br>
Two Congressmen asked for special consideration, and were denied. The 
$100,000 proceeds went to four local charities. Springsteen played for 
nearly three hours without an interval. 'I don't know what to say,' said
 Springsteen from the stage, 'except that I'm really happy.'<br>
<br>
When Springsteen had gone, I talked to a long-term resident of Asbury 
Park, Anthony Wreiole, who sat staring out to sea, surrounded by vases, 
paintings, gun holsters and 1940s Coke bottles in wooden crates. 'Big 
cities survive,' he told me, 'because they are big cities. They have to.
 But Asbury Park doesn't have to. Places like this become a parable for 
the rest of America. What happened here will happen everywhere else 
sooner or later. There may be room for a revival. But it ain't going to 
happen any time soon.'</div>

<br>
By Adam Sweeting<br>
The Guardian, <br>
Monday May 3, 1999 <br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band<br>
MEN Arena, Manchester<br>
<br>
Since he parted company with the E Street Band a decade ago, Bruce 
Springsteen has behaved like a mature songwriter who acknowledges his 
responsibilities as a liberal icon and family man. Put him on a stage, 
though, and anything can happen.<br>
<br>
The Boss has always designed his performances to make some sort of point
 about his state of mind, so he needed to be convinced that his reunion 
with the E Street contingent had something fresh to say. From the 
opening blast of My Love Will Not Let You Down, it was clear that this 
was more than a show-me-the-money exercise.<br>
<br>
The stage was cleared for action, uncluttered by props apart from a 
couple of flanking video screens. As families do, this one has expanded 
to embrace both Bruce's old buddy Steve Van Zandt and his erstwhile 
replacement, Nils Lofgren. Bruce's wife Patti stood stage right.<br>
<br>
The band attacked the music with uncomplicated force, driven by the 
commanding beat of drummer Max Weinberg. The material was mostly cut 
from the core of the Springsteen catalogue, the period bookended by Born
 To Run and Born In The USA.<br>
<br>
Choice of songs, pacing and execution were impeccable. At just under 
three hours, this wasn't the longest Springsteen show on record, but it 
must have been one of the most emotionally intense.<br>
<br>
Sometimes the songs were subtly rearranged to highlight fresh qualities.
 The River drifted in eerily on Clarence Clemons's sax and Springsteen's
 harmonica, before Danny Federici picked up the main theme on accordion.
 Springsteen sang Born In The USA as a solo blues, with 12-string 
bottleneck guitar. Darlington County was slowed down and raunched up, 
Bruce grinding out riffs like Keith Richards.<br>
<br>
The band seemed to rock harder than ever, never more so than in the 
double punch of Murder Incorporated and Badlands. Roy Bittan's clanging 
piano remains their most distinctive signature, at its most affecting in
 a monumental reading of Backstreets.<br>
<br>
The theme of renewal suffused the performance. During Light Of Day, 
Bruce testified passionately that 'if your soul has bad credit, it's 
good here" and promised rebirth at his 'ministry of rock 'n' roll". Deny
 him at your peril.<br>
<br>
After an emotive If I Should Fall Behind, ending in the harmonies of 
Lofgren, Van Zandt, Clemons and Mr and Mrs Springsteen bonding around a 
single microphone, Bruce dedicated the new Land Of Hopes And Dreams to 
this E Street reincarnation. Nobody does it better. In fact nobody else 
can do it at all.</div>

Only a stirring finale saves Bruce Springsteen's world tour opener from the ghosts of 11 September<br>
<br>
Anthony DeCurtis<br>
The Observer, <br>
Sunday August 11, 2002<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band Continental Airlines Arena, New Jersey<br>
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band opening a year-long world tour 
in New Jersey would be a major event at any time. After all, the Boss 
himself once wryly likened his relationship to his home state to that of
 Santa Claus and the North Pole. But the release of The Rising last 
month raised the emotional stakes - and audience expectations - even 
higher. The 20,000-capacity Continental Airlines Arena sits just across 
the Hudson River from New York, virtually in the shadow of the skyline 
that was forever altered by the terrorist attacks on 11 September last 
year.<br>
<br>
The aftermath of those attacks is the ambitious subject of The Rising. 
On the day of this show it was announced that the album had sold more 
than 500,000 copies in its first week in the US. This week it will enter
 the charts at number one, Springsteen's first album (other than a 
greatest hits collection) to do so in 15 years.<br>
<br>
But if the stage was dramatically set, this show proved one of the rare 
moments in which Springsteen failed to rise to the occasion. From the 
start the singer and his band (augmented by violinist Soozie Tyrell) 
seemed inhibited by the painful issues their music raised. They 
performed five songs - 'The Rising', 'Lonesome Day', 'Prove It All 
Night', 'Fuse' and 'Darkness on the Edge of Town' - before the typically
 effusive Springsteen addressed the crowd, primarily to request silence 
for the spare, moving versions of 'Empty Sky' and 'You're Missing'. On 
his 1999-2000 reunion tour with the E Street Band, Springsteen exerted a
 commanding presence, feverishly preaching about the transcendent power 
of rock'n'roll. On this night, however, he was more contained, as if 
concerned that such emotional displays might be inappropriate or even 
disrespectful. The two-and-a-half-hour, 22-song set - generous by any 
normal measure, but spartan by Springsteen's epic standards - was 
another sign of his uncharacteristic restraint.<br>
<br>
Opening-night glitches didn't help. Half the evening's songs came from 
The Rising - too much new material for a show on this scale. In 
addition, most of those songs had never been performed live, and the 
10-piece band was too preoccupied simply getting the arrangements right 
to play at full strength, let alone swing.<br>
<br>
That said, the E Street Band is still one of rock's most propulsive 
outfits. The classic 'Two Hearts' featured Springsteen and his trusty 
sidekick, guitarist Steven Van Zandt, screaming their harmonies into a 
single microphone, their lips inches apart. The crowd transformed 
'Waitin' on a Sunny Day', a seeming throwaway on The Rising , into a 
lusty singalong that brought Springsteen up short. 'I'm very impressed,'
 he said, and the grin on his face testified to his sincerity.<br>
<br>
Springsteen also took care to ensure that his focus on 11 September did 
not fuel a sense of vengeance. Content to let the often ambiguous songs 
speak for themselves, he never mentioned or even alluded to the events 
of that day. In his introduction to 'My City of Ruins', one of the core 
tracks on The Rising, he spoke of the song's original plea for the 
rebuilding of Asbury Park, the Jersey Shore town that provided 
inspiration for many of his early songs. And he paired 'Into the Fire', a
 song about the heroism of police and firefighters at the World Trade 
Centre, with 'American Skin (41 Shots)', a brooding ballad based on the 
police shooting of a West African immigrant in the Bronx in 1999.<br>
<br>
As an encore, Springsteen unleashed 'Born to Run', 'Glory Days' and 
'Thunder Road', three hits that shook the hall to its rafters. He 
brought the night to a close with 'Born in the USA' and 'Land of Hope 
and Dreams'. That was Springsteen at his finest - in one song examining 
in brutal terms the coruscating impact of the Vietnam War on the 
American soul, in the other evoking spiritually charged imagery of 
America as a new promised land.<br>
<br>
Over the resounding folk-rock chords of 'Land', Springsteen borrowed the
 stirring gospel conceit of the train to heaven, nodded to the Im 
pressions' 'People Get Ready' and sang: 'This train/Dreams will not be 
thwarted/This train/Faith will be rewarded/This train/ Hear the steel 
wheels sing/ This train/Bells of freedom ring.'<br>
<br>
The ending struck the note of healing Springsteen had been searching for
 all night. If it was a shame he failed to find that sweet spot earlier,
 it can't be said that redemption came too late.<br>

Tonight, in the wake of a successful album reflecting US anguish over 11
 September, the voice of blue-collar America brings his dynamic stage 
presence and anthems to working men and women to a sold-out Wembley 
Arena<br>
<br>
Burehan Wazir<br>
The Observer, <br>
Sunday October  20 2002 <br>
<br>
At the end of 'My City of Ruins', a song that concludes Bruce 
Springsteen's latest album, the songwriter surrenders himself to a 
religious passion. As his formidable backing group, the E Street Band, 
chants the line 'With these hands', Springsteen sings for a spiritual 
rebirth in the wake of the war on terror: 'I pray Lord/I pray for the 
strength Lord/I pray for the faith Lord/I pray for your love Lord/'.<br>
<br>
The song - originally written about the economic blight in the singer's 
home town of Asbury Park - has taken on an anthem-like quality in light 
of the 11 September attacks.<br>
<br>
'People see that song as something that encapsulates the American 
experience in the wake of the attacks,' Nils Lofgren, a guitarist and 
long-serving member of Springsteen's E Street Band, told The Observer 
recently. 'To me, Bruce says all the things being thought by the average
 guy on the street.'<br>
<br>
This everyman aspect of Springsteen's music best describes his ongoing 
appeal to his audience. For more than 30 years through 12 records, 'The 
Boss' - he hates the title - has written cinematic songs on a human 
scale about pinched dreams, broken hearts, crushed souls and dead-end 
jobs. His characters are refugees of the rock 'n' roll generation. They 
run from their adult responsibilities, luck out with bad choices and 
finally return to embrace their fates. In near hymnal terms, Springsteen
 articulates the importance of community, personal loss and finally, 
redemption.<br>
<br>
Released in July, Springsteen's latest album, The Rising, has been 
received as a CD born of his need to testify to the pain of those who 
were killed or wounded on 9/11. It also marks, for the first time in 18 
years, his floor-shaking return to the big band sound that first 
cemented his reputation. The Rising , however, is more than just a 
repeat of old glories. It is arguably the most articulate response yet 
by a major recording artist to the events of 9/11.<br>
<br>
It will not be the first time that Bruce Springsteen has taken up the 
mantle of blue-collar hero. As he performs tonight at a sold-out Wembley
 Arena with the E Street Band, Springsteen and his bandmates will 
provide an example of those most valued baby-boomer tenets: enduring 
friendship, love and the power of rock 'n' roll. As he said once, 'This 
music is forever for me. It's the stage thing. That rush moment that you
 live for. It never lasts, but that's what you live for.'<br>
<br>
Bruse Springsteen was born on 23 September 1949, one of three children. 
He was raised in the working-class town of Freehold, New Jersey. The 
family struggled with odd jobs to pay the bills. Springsteen would later
 say he was acting out his father's 'revenge' on the system. School was 
'the big hate' and the young Springsteen was an habitual truant.<br>
<br>
It was the early Sixties in New Jersey, and the era of 'doo-wop' music, 
drag races and leather gangs. Like many teenagers of his generation, 
Springsteen found an escape in rock 'n' roll and started playing the 
guitar. 'Nothing hit me until I was about 14,' he said once. 'And when 
it did, it hit me completely, took over my whole life. Everything from 
then on revolved around music. Everything.'<br>
<br>
Guitar playing was his first love. And the silent, insecure boy excelled
 at it. After failing to break New York's burgeoning folk scene, he had 
brief stints with New Jersey groups such as the Rogues and Dr Zoom and 
the Sonic Boom. Eventually he established his own group, the E Street 
Band.<br>
<br>
Springsteen was signed to Columbia Records as the 'New Dylan' in 1972 
after an audition with John Hammond, the A&amp;R man who had brought 
Dylan to the label. In Hammond's office, as Springsteen finished up 'If I
 Were The Priest' - a song in which the Virgin Mary runs a whorehouse in
 the American West and Jesus appears as a customer - Hammond burst into 
excited laughter. 'That's the damnedest song I've ever heard,' he said.<br>
<br>
His first record, in 1973, Greetings from Asbury Park, NJ, sold poorly 
despite the unprecedented hype that accompanied its release. As his 
career trajectory has demonstrated, Springsteen's fame has been 
inexorably linked to his concerts. His reputation as a live entertainer -
 both then and now - is unparalleled. He often wanders off into long and
 shy monologues during his concerts. His blue-collar sentiments only add
 to his reputation. Rock critic Jon Landau wrote after one performance 
in 1974: 'I saw my rock 'n' roll past flash before my eyes. And I saw 
something else: I saw rock 'n' roll future and its name is Bruce 
Springsteen. And on a night when I needed to feel young, he made me feel
 like I was hearing music for the very first time.' Landau offered to 
manage him and the relationship lasts to this day.<br>
<br>
The heavy round of gigs that followed were to pay off eventually. 
Springsteen's third effort, 1975's Born to Run, hit commercial paydirt. 
The album seemed to perfectly embody the epic and musically momentous 
three-hour concerts on which Springsteen and the E Street Band had built
 their reputation.<br>
<br>
Writing in the influential rock magazine Rolling Stone in 1975, critic 
Greil Marcus confirmed the singer's status in the canon of rock 'n' roll
 artists: 'Springsteen took what he found and made something better 
himself. This album is it.'<br>
<br>
The following three years were to see his career on hold, however, after
 a management dispute. He returned with the critically-acclaimed 
Darkness on the Edge of Town, The River and Nebraska albums. Springsteen
 seemed to be looking to expand his musical horizons, journeying back 
and forth from the realms of folk and rock music. It was also around 
this time, he has said, that he discovered his left-leaning politics.<br>
<br>
Few, including the songwriter himself, could have predicted the 
importance of Springsteen's next record. Released in 1984, Born in the 
USA established him as the most dynamic American songwriter since Bob 
Dylan. For most of his fans, it stands as his musical apogee. The songs 
suggested a shrinking American landscape. Springsteen narrated stories 
of disillusioned Vietnam veterans, the destruction of small-town 
American life and the simple pleasures of the working man. Born in the 
USA immediately resonated with a country reeling from welfare cuts and 
unemployment. To date it has sold more than 20 million copies.<br>
<br>
With Born in the USA, Springsteen ushered in the age of the stadium 
concert and MTV. He was elevated to the position of rock royalty. But 
the demands of the stadium circuit eventually took their toll. Tired and
 emotionally drained by the rigours of the road, he shelved the E Street
 Band and returned in 1987 with Tunnel of Love. It was a subdued record 
and a stark contrast to the bombastic Born in the USA. The album 
explored the failures of his domestic life - his relationship with his 
wife, the actress and model Julianne Phillips, was fast deteriorating. 
They divorced in 1989.<br>
<br>
While the 1980s were undoubtedly Springsteen's commercial heyday, the 
following decade was muted. 'The Nineties,' Springsteen told Rolling 
Stone, 'were about getting my own house in order.' He married his 
backing singer Patty Scialfa in 1991. He also moved to Los Angeles - far
 from his working-class roots. The switch to the centre of the 
entertainment industry seemed at odds with his personality. And the 
newly-found domestic bliss seemed to mark a decade of unchallenging 
statements.<br>
<br>
His 1992 double set, Human Touch and Lucky Town, were erratic affairs. 
It was as if the moneyed climate of Los Angeles had robbed his music of 
its authentic spirit. He wasn't alone in suffering from a downturn in 
sales. Many of his musical contemporaries were struggling to find their 
feet in a market dominated by younger acts. Only 1995's Ghost of Tom 
Joad - a faithful reworking of John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath - 
indicated that the old blue-collar ethic was intact. But while the album
 was a critical success, it sold poorly.<br>
<br>
The musically-barren decade did not diminish his status as the ordained 
voice of his generation, however. On the campaign trail in 1992, Bill 
Clinton admitted he was a fan. And earlier this year, a group of 
political activists launched a campaign to persuade the singer to run 
for the US Senate. Springsteen was appalled: 'If nominated, I will not 
run. If elected, I will not serve.'<br>
<br>
The runaway success of his latest album reinforces the theory that 
Springsteen hits his musical peaks in periods of tumult. Few events have
 so inspired him as those of 9/11. Springsteen immediately went into the
 studio with the E Street Band, which he had recalled for a tour in 
1999. The new album, The Rising, has been hailed as his most potent 
statement in years.<br>
<br>
As he prepares to play the new songs in London tonight, his music will 
serve as a reminder of rock 'n' roll's resilience in the face of 
sweeping demographic changes in the pop charts. Springsteen has 
rediscovered the honesty in embracing and articulating human tragedies. 
His new songs are, in part, a celebration of his generation's survival. 
As he sang 25 years ago, 'It ain't no sin to be glad you're alive'.</div>

Wembley Arena, London<br>
<br>
Adam Sweeting<br>
The Guardian, <br>
Tuesday October 22,2002 <br>
<br>
Thanks to the demolition work on the football stadium, Wembley Arena 
can't pretend to be anything else but a giant building site. But there 
is room in Bruce Springsteen's all-embracing world view for just about 
everything. "It's nice to be back in this old building," he said 
benignly. "We've had some nice nights here."<br>
<br>
Rooted in the fallout from last year's terrorist horrors in America, the
 songs on his new album The Rising found the veteran songwriter probing 
into issues of grief and loss, weighing the human cost while carefully 
avoiding political polemic or breast-beating calls to arms. The nearest 
he came to the latter tonight was a full-tilt version of Born in the 
USA, but he prefaced it with a cautionary note. "I wrote this song about
 the Vietnam war," he said. "I'd like to play it tonight as a prayer for
 peace." The song's thundering beat and big, dark chords sounded like a 
giant storm gathering over the White House.<br>
<br>
The new songs have tilted the mood of the show towards stoicism and 
struggle, rendering some of the hysterical optimism of earlier years 
obsolete, and Springsteen has rearranged the E Street Band's furniture 
to accommodate them. Violinist Soozie Tyrell, whose playing sprinkled 
new colours across the album, is now a fixture on stage, while Nils 
Lofgren's skills on assorted guitars have been rewarded with several 
episodes in the spotlight (his acoustic preamble to Countin' on a 
Miracle was particularly nifty). Saxophonist Clarence Clemons has been 
beefed up in the mix, and organist Danny Federici was given space to cut
 loose evocatively on You're Missing and the glorious gospel hymn of My 
City of Ruins.<br>
<br>
But however elaborate the arrangements - especially the multi-guitar 
breakdown section in Worlds Apart or the electronic enhancements in The 
Fuse - it is Springsteen's non-stop action that generates the kinetic 
energy at the heart of the performance. Skidding across the stage on his
 knees, hamming it up like a pantomime matador in the 30-year-old Does 
This Bus Stop at 82nd Street? or playing the medicine-show huckster as 
he introduces the band, he burns with a million megawatts of energy on 
stage. Aside from the knockabout stuff, he made room for some surprises,
 in particular a touching version of Incident on 57th Street, played 
solo at the piano. Its freewheeling, romantic narrative was a jolting 
reminder of the way his writing has deepened and darkened over the 
decades. He finally dragged himself away with Thunder Road. Springsteen 
will be back next year. To be continued...</div>

Friday May 9 2003 <br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen's 50,000 sell-out Manchester concert will go ahead after a court ruling yesterday rejected local complaints.<br>
<br>
The Boss will play at the Old Trafford cricket ground at the end of the 
month, one of only three UK dates on his European tour, after Trafford 
magistrates overturned Trafford council's decision not to grant a 
licence, following complaints.<br>
<br>
But the decision is a blow to campaigners. Jack Buxton, who lives 700 
yards from Old Trafford, told the court that living next to the cricket 
ground when bands were playing was "like listening to a rock concert in 
bed. It's a cacophony of noise."<br>
<br>
Old Trafford's neighbours also complained of the loutish behaviour of 
some Oasis fans when the Manchester band played last September.<br>
<br>
But Springsteen's promoter, Harvey Goldsmith, said: "[Springsteen] is in
 control of the music and very aware of the environment. The fans are 
over 30 onwards."<br>
<br>
The Lancashire county cricket club's chief executive, Jim Coombes, said 
the club would suffer if the concert was cancelled. "The loss of the 
income would be in the region of £100,000 to £150,000."</div>

The Observer, <br>
Sunday May 25 2003 <br>
<br>
Tomorrow night Bruce Springsteen plays Crystal Palace National Sports 
Stadium. Like thousands of other fans I will be there, but unlike lots 
of fans I am going to start queuing this afternoon to ensure a front-row
 position.<br>
<br>
This isn't the first time I've queued for Bruce. I've queued for him 
every time he has come to London since I became a fan in 1996. I know 
that people must think I am mad for doing so but I know crazier people. A
 friend from Sweden is flying to 16 of his shows over a four-month 
stretch; a young fan from Delhi flew across Europe and the United States
 to catch shows after saving up for months; another devotee paid £200 to
 go and see just one of his concerts because she knew she'd regret it 
for the rest of her life if she didn't.<br>
<br>
So what is it about Bruce? Being a British Asian woman, I meet with 
curious looks when I mention my Springsteen obsession. 'You don't look 
like a Bruce Springsteen fan,' I'm told. What does a typical Bruce fan 
look like? If I were to generalise, I'd say a typical fan would be a 
middle-aged man wearing jeans, a white T-shirt and cowboy boots, who 
lives in Nebraska or some such place in the USA and still pumps his fist
 to the beat of 'Born in the USA'.<br>
<br>
My friends just don't see what a 53-year-old white, Catholic 
rock'n'roller from New Jersey offers a 23-year-old Sikh girl from east 
London. I grew up in a narrow-minded, claustrophobic culture which 
dictated I would get married to an accountant/lawyer/doctor, and live in
 a nice house with lots of children. Listening to Springsteen gave me an
 insight into the possibilities life could have. It was Bruce himself 
who said: 'My education was listening to records and that taught me that
 there's more to life than what you see around.<br>
<br>
'And that was something they couldn't teach me in school, you couldn't 
learn it in the house, and you couldn't learn it from people you were 
hanging with on the street or anything. That was the most important 
lesson of my life.'<br>
<br>
Listening to Bruce did the same for me.<br>
<br>
Maybe as a British Asian, torn between two sets of values - East and 
West - I am also attracted to his music for its portrayal of lost and 
broken heroes, the John Wayne outsiders who don't quite know where they 
belong. After all, America is a land full of immigrants still struggling
 with their identity and their contradictions. Springsteen is just one 
of the artists who has documented this struggle through his music.<br>
<br>
He has also accomplished something amazing in appealing to both right-wing conservatives and left-wing liberals.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's music is multilayered and has an intelligent, universal 
lesson at its heart, one of the reasons, I believe, that it appeals to 
such a wide cross-section of the population.<br>
<br>
I may have been into Bruce for seven years, listened to all his albums 
countless times, been to nearly a dozen shows and am now writing a book 
about him, but when I put on a one of his CDs I can always find 
something new. For this reason, the music will be around forever, and it
 is this which drives me to queue overnight for the privilege of 
watching one of his passion-fuelled shows from the front row. It is also
 why he'll always be the best travelling companion who ever accompanies 
me on my journeys.</div>

Crystal Palace Athletics Ground, London<br>
<br>
Alexis Petridis<br>
The Guardian, <br>
Wednesday May 28, 2003 <br>
<br>
<br>
Even an artist used to being called the Boss might be surprised by the 
scale of his commercial renaissance. Sparked by The Rising, last year's 
thoughtful collection of 9/11-inspired songs, this is his second UK 
stadium tour in a matter of months, but no one in the audience shows 
signs of Boss fatigue. The stands are packed and people are hollering: 
"Brooooooce!" En masse, it sounds not unlike the lowing of cattle. This 
is appropriate, because if Springsteen milked his audience any more 
shamelessly, he would have to come on stage carrying a little stool and a
 wooden bucket.<br>
<br>
Famously gifted at whipping up atmosphere in drab stadiums, Springsteen 
seems to draw inspiration from Crystal Palace Athletics Ground, which 
resembles something a communist dictator would build to massacre 
dissidents in. He slides across the stage on his knees, sings to a 
little girl in the front row, flings his guitar in the air, sports a 
glittery Stetson thrown from the crowd. At one point, the 53-year-old 
singer hangs upside down from his microphone stand in the manner of a 
pole dancer.<br>
<br>
This, like much of the on-stage antics at a Springsteen concert, should 
be painfully embarrassing. However, the singer exudes an appealing 
earnestness that lets him get away with hokum. You can see it in his 
face on the giant video screens - he's knocking himself out to entertain
 you up there. Not to respond feels a bit churlish.<br>
<br>
The same is true of his music. It is as unchanged by the passing years 
as the E Street Band's wardrobe, which could give your average stylist a
 panic attack. Songs from 1975's Born to Run sound slightly more 
episodic than those from The Rising, but otherwise, they are the same: 
declamatory piano chords, raw-throated vocals, lengthy sax solos, 
rousing choruses. It's a sound that can only work in such a venue. What 
comes across as macho bombast on record sounds impossibly stirring here,
 floating across thousands of raised hands and punched fists. 
Springsteen's commercial renaissance should come as no surprise: what he
 does is excessive and occasionally daft, but he does it better than 
anyone else.</div>
