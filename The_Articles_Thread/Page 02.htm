Esquire Magazine , DECEMBER 1988<br>
By John Lombardi<br>
<br>
True fame is a commodity like fiberboard or soybean meal in 1988, and 
suprastar true fame - not the legless stuff of also-ran politicians or 
reliable Mookie Wilsons or number six-on-the- charts-but-no-higher pop 
stars - I mean the ones that last: Cosby, Michael, Reagan, Bruce - 
suprastar true fame is corporate grace in perpetuity, brand-name 
canonization like Carson and Hope have, a nation fondly recognizing 
itself as a perfect sales culture, coming to terms at last with its own 
bottom line... <br>
<br>
The man (or woman - Madonna's almost there) who achieves this degree of 
fame is no longer measured in conventional terms; "talent," 
"intelligence," "character," even "looks" seem fogey calipers, the 
anemic mutterings of those consigned to life's cheap seats, outside the 
power loop and consequently unable to sense what really counts: so what 
if Cosby's jokes and expression suggest a demonic frog -the man earns 
$57 million a year and quietly helps Philly's poor; sure Reagan's an 
aging anchorman, capable of rabbity surliness, but he rolled America 
back from the Carter pieties, didn't he, sat asses down at 
defense-industry computers the way they used to during Vietnam; and 
yeah, Michael's a little bionic now, after all that reconstruction, but 
he's sweet, you have to admit, a real-life E.T., narcissism mitigated by
 ingenuousness and cold cash ($3I million a year, according to Forbes); 
last, of course, out of Lettermanland endlessly rocking, the white 
suburban cradle of the twenty-first century, incarnating Mass Hip, the 
Mall as Church, bumps Bruce. <br>
<br>
You have to hear the crowd: Broooce! curling off the aural wave that 
smashes the stage seconds after the synthesizer's last notes on "Tougher
 Than the Rest," sounding eerily like boos and with, perhaps, an eighth 
note of petulance leavening the adulation, that adolescent mulishness of
 total self-regard, years of combing, of sidelong dreams reflected in 
car windows, gym mirrors, storefront plate glass "Bruce is Us!" and yet,
 and yet, he's not us, not anymore, he's thirty-nine, he married a model
 (why do rock stars always marry models?), made $56 million in eighteen 
months (Forbes again), is pumped up like Schwarzenegger, sleeked down 
like television, as high-concept as Sonny in Miami Vice... <br>
<br>
The Bruce Mythos, as Springsteen chronicler Dave Marsh probably put it 
in one of his unreadable tomes, is rooted in the early 70s, the tatty 
end of the 60s; its heart is the "populist voyager" image, The Sorrows 
of Young Werther in (until recently) Levis and boots, the Road, the 
Night, the Girl. According to legend, Springsteen and his E Street Band 
arose from the ashes of Asbury Park on the Jersey Shore, a garage-group 
Phoenix come to dribble the basketball of American popular culture after
 Bob Dylan fouled out. Back in those days, Mass Hip was busy becoming; 
except for the extreme initiati - folkies like Dave Van Ronk, Patrick 
Sky, Tony "Little Sun" Glover; writers like Charles Bukowski, Gregory 
Corso, and Sam Shepard; scenies like Bobby Neuwirth and the late Lillian
 Roxon - nobody knew that hip was dead. They knew that Hendrix was dead,
 along with Joplin and Morrison, the Kennedys and King, and that the 
salutary experience of sweating on buses filled with their music on the 
way to protest the war or fight for civil rights was no more; they knew 
that something had happened to Dylan's spirit after his (greatly 
exaggerated) motorcycle accident, that he'd stopped licking around the 
edges of conceits so mean that they'd tried to fuse Billboard to 
Rimbaud, limousines to the Apocalypse, Albert Grossman to Diaghilev. 
Dylan had stretched American hip culture until it broke, and broke him. 
He was expected to die, but he didn't. Well, America is more of a relay 
race than a Dantean journey anyway. Broooce! <br>
<br>
In the early photos he's a skinny little guy in a cut-off denim jacket, 
greaser jeans, rag around his head, needing a shave - a gofer for the 
Hell's Angels or the Rolling Stones. Except that his dark eyes 
(Dutch/Irish/Italian, it turns out) are dense with ambition, yearning 
and burning at the same time, a macho sensitive. What did Bruce want? <br>
<br>
To be hip and famous like Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan, except that he'd 
seen Elvis implode, Dylan retract, one from selling out, the other from 
giving out: "Dylan was a revolutionary. So was Elvis. I always saw 
myself as a nuts-and-bolts kind of person." Bruce's dad drove buses, 
guarded prisoners. His mom typed letters. He came from a section of 
Freehold called "Texas," where a bunch of Appalachian hillbillies had 
set up in one of the country's less-noted internal migrations. The kid 
was street smart. It took a while, he knew, for the urban vibe to 
penetrate the suburban. That's why the bridge-and-tunnel crowd got 
status-snubbed every weekend, when they rag-tagged into Greenwich 
Village and the Lower East Side, wearing the first of their mall 
pseudo-French "designer" jeans, their hair too long and fluffy clean, 
their baby wattles rosy white, eyes grave, then glassy. <br>
<br>
Bruce was tougher than the rest. He banged on his guitar at the Cafe 
Wha? and the Gaslight in the Village, then Chevvied on home to Freehold 
to mythologize the experience for less mobile Jerseyans. He could make a
 windswept song out of anything: a traffic ticket at Exit 8 off the 
Jersey Turnpike, where he was, in fulsome, suspended disbelief, 
"thinkin' about makin' a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and seein' my 
girl" when the trooper struck ("Open All Night"). In his signature 
songs, "Thunder Road," "Backstreets," "Born to Run," nothing much 
happened except the rapid evocation of blurry teen angst, rendered in 
language as self- consciously prosaic as a pair of stonewashed 501'S 
would be ten years later. Which was the point: Bruce anticipated Mass 
Hip, the effect of looking stressed out, nicely worn for the right 
reasons, without the actual experience of being buffeted by 
circumstances beyond his control: the idea was not to get as beat up as 
Dylan, or, heaven forbid, as dead as Brian Jones; Springsteen knew his 
audience couldn't really relate to something as bizarre as "a motorcycle
 black madonna/two-wheeled gypsy queen," whatever that was (Dylan's 
"Gates of Eden"), but they'd probably seen a few "Spanish Johnnys" and 
"Puerto Rican Janes'' ("Incident on 57th Street") hanging around on 
their weekend sorties into the big city and had talked them up all the 
way home. <br>
<br>
By 1973, when he released his first album, Greetings from Asbury Park, 
New Jersey, the "truth" of the working-class American life Springsteen 
allegedly chronicled was profound frustration, the legacy of 
post-industrial corporatism and unionism, and, in youthful reaction, 
bursts of ersatz energy as synthetic as the video cracklings after the 
3:00 a.m. John Ford movie clicked off in the "shot and beer" bars Bruce 
so loved to conjure. The actual Jersey Shore, though, had always been a 
service economy; the "mill" and "factory" closings Bruce plaintively 
identified as tangible representations of a "runaway American dream" 
were located up north in Jersey City, Paterson, and the Oranges, or way 
down south in Camden, where RCA and Campbell Soup were going on the 
skids. Bruce and his crowd were bored, not desperate. You could shoop by
 quite nicely at the Stone Pony or the Upstage or the Keyport Rollerdome
 in Asbury Park on $300- to $3000-a-week gigs; they got you loaded and 
laid on beer, pizza, subs, the local nubilia, and, provided you were in 
your twenties or under, the sustaining romance of a kind of East Coast, 
cut-rate surfer narcissism. Asbury Park was Huntington Beach, 
California, for kids whose families looked something like Archie 
Bunker's but who tuned in from breezeways; Coney Island without black 
and Spanish shooters; II6th Street with natural air conditioning. <br>
<br>
A "mall" environment, in short. If Clive Davis, the CBS Records Group 
president responsible for the initial $40,000 hype that tried to 
establish Springsteen as "the new Bob Dylan," had been as much of a 
heads-up mensch as his eventual successor, Walter Yetnikoff, was, CBS 
would simply have optioned the boardwalk and presented Bruce and the E 
Street Band as a daytime soap: As the Tide Turns, the rollback of 
netherworld teen alienation, the Dead End Kids with $5,000 worth of good
 orthodontics and the occasional B-I2 shot. Bruce was famous for being 
drug-free, alcohol-free, for working hard (three- and four-hour sets 
where "youthful" energy bursts knocked audiences out as wholesomely as 
good aerobics classes would), for being on the right side of social 
issues... Before Springsteen, rock had been about rebelling; after him, 
it was about conforming, and that's what pierced the hearts of a little 
group of formerly leftish "rock critics" who got CBS re-interested after
 Springsteen's first two records, Greetings and The Wild, the Innocent 
&amp; the E Street Shuffle, flopped. <br>
<br>
Bruce was a "rock critic's" dream, a means of rationalizing nostalgic 
feelings of "rebellion" and blue-collar sympathy with comfortable 
middle-aged incomes and "life-styles." Bruce's explainers - Robert 
Christgau of Dartmouth and The Village Voice; Jon Landau of Brandeis and
 Rolling Stone; John Rockwell of Harvard and The New York Times; Greil 
Marcus of U. Berkeley and ArtForum; and Marsh, unlettered but strident 
and a sometime contributor to most of the above - saw in him a way of 
focusing their intellectual/artistic/activist inclinations. All were 
kids in the '60s, energized by the possibilities they thought they saw 
in rock 'n' roll. Christgau and Marsh actually belonged to the G.I. 
Antiwar movement and the White Panther party, respectively, while Marcus
 established written solidarity with "anarchist" stick-up types like 
George Jackson, and Landau mused at length on culturopolitical overviews
 and produced the "revolutionary" Detroit band the MC5 (into the ground,
 as it turned out). <br>
<br>
For these fellows, Bruce was the perfect punk, a street guy with 
boundless energy who wouldn't beat you up. A person who looked like 
Rockwell - steel-rimmed, turtlenecked, Capote-toned - or 
Christgau-swaybacked, smirking, in stale promo T-shirts - appreciated a 
little absence of malice. In the '60s it had been exhilarating to find 
yourself lip-deep in scurftroll fans, waiting for Joe Cocker to spasm or
 Van Morrison to levitate in presumed contradiction of the established 
order, but as Delmore Schwartz had warned, "in dreams begin 
responsibilities," and by the '70s, all these boys were supporting 
families and titles like "King of Rock 'n' Roll Writers" (Landau) or 
"Dean of Rock Critics" (Christgau). Talking to Bruce wasn't like talking
 to Mick Jagger, whose formidable IQ threatened to peel the paint off 
your pet theories, or Sly Stone, who before his cocaine collapse was 
capable of throwing a washrag in your face as a test of your willingness
 to rock out. "The Boss," as Springsteen was known for a while, ducked 
his head, dropped his g's nicely, seemed boyishly earnest when telling 
his stories about getting asked to leave Ocean County College for 
dressing like a biker, or being stuffed in a trash bin by a nun in the 
third grade (for unspecified sins). Christgau, Landau, et cetera, had 
little direct experience of white prole life, except in its transplanted
 form in cultural petri dishes like the Lower East Side or Cambridge, or
 when they listened to it on the radio, then mulled it over in marathon 
telephone sessions that could have paid for the medical relief of entire
 villages in Guatemala. Bruce was becoming Mailer's White Negro for 
rock's gourmet intelligentsia, five middle-class white men sitting 
around talking. <br>
<br>
In 1975-76, this worked out felicitously. Rock 'n' roll had become 
effete techno-pop. The industry needed something "vital" to counteract 
the moon-goon mincings of David Bowie and the disco movement, and the 
country needed to distract itself from the consensus politics of 
Ford/Carter. Born to Run, Bruce's breakout album, was an Alka-Seltzer 
fizz for the media department of a sales culture with an upset tummy. 
Its songs, racing up and down the American highway, cruising the romance
 of boardwalk detritus, necking on the abstract beach of memory, 
entertained editors, executives, and fans who didn't get around much 
anymore. In fact, the circumstance that all of Springsteen's images were
 utterly familiar helped more than hurt, as did his recycled delivery - 
Dylan as Elvis, Gary "U.S." Bonds as Woody Guthrie, Little Richard as 
Mitch Ryder as Broooce! Hell, the kid wasn't trying to pull anything, he
 was right up front, and to tell the truth, it was a relief not to feel 
artistically or intellectually or sexually unhip anymore, as one tended 
to with the originators of the Boss's inspirations. You could relate to 
Bruce because he lived vicariously, too - for all his driving imagery, 
he couldn't shift gears! The other crucial factor was that in an 
emergent VCR moonscape of cable hook up and instant replay and mass 
numbers, where consciousness itself tended to get overwhelmed, high 
recognition factor (HRF) was beginning to seem fundamental: to be 
"unique" and "original" now just meant to be remembered, and to be 
remembered, you had to be a cliche. <br>
<br>
Three practical things happened to put Bruce over the top: <br>
<br>
In May 1974, Landau caught him at a Boston club, wrote "I saw rock 'n' 
roll's future and its name is Bruce Springsteen," then quit fooling 
around as a critic and did a Carl Icahn move on Mike Appel, Bruce's 
naive handler; within two years he was Springsteen's manager and main 
producer. <br>
The faceless culture editors of Time and Newsweek, responding to what 
they perceived as a prescient swell on the part of the five rock-crit 
experts charged with knowing about popular music, put Springsteen on the
 covers of their respective magazines on the same day, October 27, 1975,
 something that only happens to world leaders. <br>
Noting the above, CBS uncorked $250,000 in publicly earmarked promotion 
funds to support twenty-three weeks of touring by the Boss and the E 
Street Band, and an undisclosed amount to shadowy independent promo men 
to ensure solid "rotation" airplay for selected songs from Born to Run 
in twelve crucial radio markets in the U.S. The album eventually sold 
five million units, and renews itself when ever Bruce tours. As Al 
Teller, CBS's smiling former V.P. for domestic sales, has remarked, 
"With enough rotation, Aida could go Top Ten." <br>
<br>

<br>
The Met Center, just outside Minneapolis, off 35W, is a big round 
building in the golden light, a popular culture cake for the 
Scandinavians poised on the edge of the Great Plains. There is a 
Lutheran calm in the air, even though the sound check inside is pumping 
out the E Street Band's version of the great John Lee Hooker's maximum 
blues, "Boom-Boom." This diffusive quality seems crucial. Springsteen 
and his audience are perfectly agreed: in 1988, rock 'n' roll's job is 
to render frenzy sensible. <br>
<br>
As if to illustrate the point, Marilyn Percansky, who is forty-eight now
 but still hitting them safely in black tights and cumulus-cloud black 
hair (the skinnyfat Tama Janowitz look), is talking things over with her
 kids, Lisa, twenty-five, and Marc, twenty-two. All three had been to 
the Registry the night before, the hotel where Bruce and the band 
encamped, clearing out the cocktail lounge, rolling up the figurative 
rug to blast out four hours of "Spare Parts" and "Cover Me" and 
"Rosalita," the emotional buzz songs of the live show. "He's so cute," 
Marilyn gushes professionally, tempering the effusions of her children 
slightly. Marilyn's father-in-law, it develops, ran a funky club in 
Minneapolis where Dylan himself used to hang out when he first came down
 from Hibbing, up on the Iron Range in the real north country. Did she 
know him? She flashes a smile that contains all of Germaine Greer ("Dr. 
G." in her groupie days), all of Edie Sedgwick and Patti Smith and the 
great long girls with perfect legs who once lubricated rock's erotic 
garden, sliding in and out of limos, brushing past the sumo hunks 
guarding the fragile male stars: "I'm with the band"... girls who knew 
rock better than any straight man will ever understand - they got down 
on all fours for it, they let it bleed them, they rolled it over and 
plugged their fingers into it, then straightened their skirts and 
laughed. She knew him all right, in the cracked-up way that Edie 
photographed; rock was masculine energy turning feminine, the 
degenderizing force of technology placed at the service of the marketing
 department (because sales are ultimately sexless), Jagger reading 
Shelley in Hyde Park in arch memoriam to Brian Jones, wearing a little 
white dress..."Bruce is cute," Marilyn repeats, like a vet in a well-lit
 room remembering a jungle fire fight. "The kids really dig him." <br>
<br>
Rick Cheney certainly does. For him, the mysteries of sexual balance of 
power are not worth pondering. Bruce is a dude, anyone can see that. 
Where does all this analyzing get you? In St. Louis, where Cheney edits 
The River, one of the foremost Springsteen fanzines, Bruce's popularity 
turns on his involvement with food banks and unions and veterans' 
groups. "Did you know that Bruce writes regular $5,000 checks to Bobby 
Muller of the Vietnam Veterans of America? To Becky Aiello of the 
Berkeley Emergency Food Project? And George Cole of the Steelworkers 
Oldtimers' Foundation?" Well, I'd heard about it, but what about the PR 
mileage that accrues to him from such generosity - after all, at $22.50 a
 pop for two sold-out dates at the Met Center, which holds 17,500 
believers, Landau Management, commanding a 95-5 percent split with 
promoters, will gross more than $I million! To say nothing of T-shirt 
revenues! And the show's been on the road for three months! <br>
<br>
"Well, he doesn't have to give anything away," Cheney points out coldly.
 "What other rock stars do as much? Christ, the media is maddening with 
its niggling drive to 'expose' everything." <br>
<br>
His tone has attracted a little crowd: Lori, thirty, who describes 
herself as "driven" when it comes to Bruce, maybe "a child in some 
creepy way," but who nevertheless "hates" some of Bruce's more 
commercial stuff, like "Dancing in the Dark" and "Hungry Heart" (this 
observation sets off a fit of Cerberean barking from Cheney: "How can 
you say that?"); John Pugh, thirty- two, and Mark Silver, twenty-seven, 
out of Toronto, who'd come down to Crosby, Minnesota, to buy wet bikes, 
heard the Springsteen tour was conquering the Midwest, picked it up in 
Lexington, Kentucky, and stayed with it wherever they could, driving 
hundreds of miles, red- eyed, popping tops and sucking smoke, letting 
their photo business in Canada fend for itself, getting happily strung 
out in an '80's sense - they're both stocky, tanned, grounded in a way 
that would have been unthinkable in, say, 1973, when young people 
hitting the rockfest summer route became virtual Tuaregs... <br>
<br>
Now, finally, they're broke, and paying for their variegated road fuel 
by scalping a little: "See, Bruce has ticket drops at 5:30 and 6:00 for 
8:00 shows," Pugh explains, through a cloud of euphoriant. "He'll let 
forty or fifty garbage seats (rear floor locations) go, and then between
 6:00 and 6:30, twenty or thirty blue-line seats (off-the-floor but 
close). This is for the true fans, those he knows follow him, because 
his shows always sell out. We go in and buy a few, enough to cover 
ourselves. What do we get? Anywhere from $50 to $150 apiece. But if we 
were really tryin' to make money, we'd scarf up thirty tickets, right?" 
(Lori is yelling that anyone who charges more than face value for a 
Springsteen ticket is going against the Boss's populist spirit and is 
consequently full of shit.) <br>
<br>
Silver nods, like a wise rabbi: "You've got pure people [he indicates 
Lori] and you've got people who are okay but know what life's really 
like. We think that's what Bruce is. He tells true stories...That's why 
we're followin' him around." <br>
<br>
Not because you're bored with life in Toronto? <br>
<br>
"Phew, man," Pugh protests. "Of course we are, a little bit. But really,
 that's not it. Bruce is successful; he's clean; he's like a guy you'd 
watch the ball game with. Toronto's a clean city, we're proud of it; so 
is Minneapolis. People go to war for what we've got. Bruce represents 
all that. He's one of us who made it. I feel a one-to-one relationship 
with him. If that's just show biz, he's the best actor in the world..." <br>
<br>
But why give him credit for ticket policy? Why not management? <br>
<br>
"It's Bruce, man," Pugh says. <br>
<br>
"Bruce, for sure," Silver confirms. <br>
<br>
* * * <br>
<br>
The need to apotheosize pop stars is hardly new - Homer and Rodin had a 
little of Dave Marsh and John Rockwell in them. But what's curious about
 the Boss is the vastness of the live audience's uncritical response. A 
pound of Springsteen kitsch trades for a ton of Broooce!, orange subway 
earplugs de rigueur among the Rambo security guards sweating in the 
photographers' pit at the lip of the stage and high in the "garbage" 
seats too. No matter how bland it was, the instant that a song ends the 
fans triple the decibel level, freeing the eardrums, ringing in a 
tinnitus that can last for hours. The crowd is louder than the band 
because it apparently needs to be. Sensing this, Springsteen proceeds to
 demonstrate a lesson in modern coping: he autohypes himself into an 
obsessive but contained and so profoundly safe fury, and the audience, 
recognizing his effort and knowing its own more puny struggles to hold 
it all in in less than wonderful marriages and jobs and schools, breaks 
the sound barrier for him. There is an emotional downward mobility in 
this, as if for Bruce and his fans, noise had replaced action in the 
modern scheme of things. <br>
<br>
At the Met Center, the "Tunnel of Love" show, named for the current 
album, starts at climax and keeps trying to top it self. After a corny 
"amusement park" entrance where the E Street Band straggles onstage to 
"buy tickets," Bruce enters in a hot pink jacket and a black silk shirt 
and pants, high-heeled cowboy boots with silver-tipped toes (he's five 
feet nine), carrying a bouquet of roses: "Ready for a ride?" he yells, 
and flings his flowers. "Tunnel of Love," the title track, occurs. It's 
meant to be a medium-slow "think piece" about the vicissitudes of 
marriage ("You've got to learn to live with what you/can't rise above"),
 but Springsteen is so charged-up he rushes the lyrics, can't wait to 
start sweating, hunching over his guitar as if it were a gun or a tool, 
his lower body locked up tight, the torso swiveling on ball bearings. <br>
<br>
He's no longer the waif of Born to Run, though he's pumped down some 
from the body-builder massif he'd achieved during the "Born in the 
U.S.A." tour of 1984. Springsteen, via Landau/ Marsh, his media 
advisers, possesses one of the keenest senses of what will play in 
America today, complete with a built-in timer that separates unsalable 
hip from high-turnover Mass Hip: in 1975 (Born to Run), for example, he 
presented himself as a ragged road hippie to a suburbia just getting 
comfortable with images abandoned by the urban cool six years before, 
after Easy Rider; in 1978 (Darkness on the Edge of Town) and 1980 (The 
River), he did his versions of Dylan's brooding, post-hip, post-accident
 John Wesley Harding album, originally released in 1968; in 1984, ten 
years after Schwartzenegger, he'd pumped so much iron he practically 
clanked, and opened "Born in the U.S.A." against a monolithic American 
flag motif. This was consonant with the peaking of the fitness craze, 
with Reagan's huge plurality in the presidential election, and with 
CREEP's Orwellian "Morning in America" media campaign (though the actual
 words to "Born in the U.S.A." - "Had a brother at Khe Sahn/Fightin' off
 the Viet Cong/They're still there/He's all gone" - were crafted so 
ambiguously that President Reagan and Walter Mondale, George Will and 
Democratic senator Bill Bradley could all claim them as "endorsements").
 The resulting "flap" over whether "Born in the U.S.A." was really jingo
 or pinko rock was in fact the second brilliant media coup for 
Landau/Marsh, eclipsing even the dual Born to Run Time/Newsweek covers 
they'd helped pull off a decade before, because it was fuel for an 
eighteen month tour that eventually grossed $100 million in ticket 
sales, with unit sales of twenty million. "Pop stars at that level are 
like surfers," confides one insider, who wants to keep his job; let's 
call him "Deep Squeak." "They pick a wave and try to ride it to the 
beach. In '84, the wave was Vietnam veterans, unions, and food banks. No
 other pop star had defined his image in that 'populist' way. But I can 
tell you it was charity [50 percent deductible], not conviction with 
Bruce, and with Landau and Barbara [Carr, Landau's assistant and Dave 
Marsh's wife] too. You'll notice there are no donations this year, none 
of those wheelchair geeks and sugar-tit suckers hanging around waiting 
to get their pictures taken with him!" <br>
<br>
On one level, though, the populism stuck. Seen from below, say in the 
first row, Springsteen has taken on a chiseled, Rushmore quality, but 
instead of resembling Lincoln or Jefferson, he suggests Jimmy Caan as 
"Sonny" in The Godfather. He's become the image of the prole ideal, 
while leaving true proledom to scratch its worn behind in a way that 
Frank Sinatra, with all his ethnic anger, could never have managed. 
Bruce is as self-conscious as a logo now, and as hard as a penny. <br>
<br>
He's doing "Boom-Boom," a number that features Clarence "Big Man" 
Clemons, his tenor-sax player and longtime stage "buddy." There have 
been a lot of complaints from rock critics and fans about Clarence's 
reduced role on the tour, and the growing prominence of blond, 
microskirted backup singer Patti Scialfa, Bruce's new girlfriend. 
"Boom-Boom" is there to dispel all of this chatter, in the way that TV 
images of the President chucking Russian babies under the chin are meant
 to make us feel generally better about him. Clemons grins, struts, and 
honks on cue, his biceps gleaming, his eyes mirrored by shades. 
Springsteen plays off him, to him in a sense, acknowledging the debt all
 white pop owes to black funk, while at the same time continuing to 
exploit it. (In the five shows I saw, Clarence was virtually the only 
black face in the place.) Clarence and Bruce no longer do their famous 
"soul kiss," but at one point Clemons literally backs Springsteen up, 
humping dryly, and Bruce slides sensually down Clarence's brawny chest 
to his belly, his head finally lolling on the Big Man's crotch. The fans
 go into paroxysms over this display of racial/sexual "harmony," but 
before anyone can get any funny ideas, Bruce is over to stage left, 
being belly-bumped by Patti. Erotically and politically, he works both 
sides of the street. <br>
<br>
Which is not to say that all of the songs lack power. Two Faces," "Cover
 Me," and "Brilliant Disguise" have a whirling, guitar/synthesizer 
melancholy appropriate for a man about to turn forty; "Tougher Than the 
Rest" evokes the dusty, hokey grandeur of "Streets of Laredo" and "This 
Land Is Your Land"; "Spare Parts," despite a dumb intro, is graphic and 
unforgiving: "Bobby said he'd pull out/Bobby stayed in/Janey had a 
baby/It wasn't any sin." And I very much like the adolescent goofiness 
and hell-bent for Top Forty hooks of "Dancing in the Dark" and "Glory 
Days," where, for once, Clarence's lame riffing and the E Street Band's 
charts, which rival the Blues Brothers for authenticity, don't matter. 
But then there is the Mass Hip patter. Bruce stark in a blue light: <br>
<br>
There was this girl, an' she was a little older, an' she fell in love 
with this guy, an' they got a little garage apartment down by the 
beach...He was a house painter, kinda wild, but he was fun. She got 
pregnant, they were gonna get married...But I dunno what happened, he 
got scared an' took off . . . She waited an' waited, and finally went 
home to her Mom..." (Dramatic pause). <br>
<br>
There comes a time when you've got to put the past behind you... This 
song is about a woman lookin' for her own individual identity!" <br>
<br>
Obvious, meritricious little homilies like this happen an average of 
four times in the live show, and are as dulling as anything on prime 
time. Springsteen has glued together a badly imagined shantytown of 
"blue collar" images and buzz-words - "mill," "car," "street," "girl" - 
meant to touch a suburban generation that only knows the "working class"
 through sitcoms and "nostalgia" films and old black-and-whites in 
granddad's wallet. His atomized material, delivered in what quickly 
becomes a tiring ritual of "energetic" striding up and down the stage, 
of cultivated hoarseness, rolled-up shirt sleeves, spraying sweat - 
macho for the age of lib - passes for romance, but exhaustion seems to 
be the point. After four and a half hours (the longest show in rock 'n' 
roll by half), fan and star are wrung out like mops, though real emotion
 - the kind you get at great football games and fights, or old-time rock
 shows (the Stones were in and out in ninety minutes) - hasn't happened.
 And that's precisely why Bruce is a suprastar. His "TV" audience has 
been weaned off depth. It only wants to mime emotion. It's more 
interested in avoiding risk than experiencing anything "real," having a 
strenuous workout while pressing remote buttons - as if life were a VCR -
 that allow a year's worth of unexpressed feeling to be acted out in 
some okay format. How else explain Stallone? Or Spielberg/Lucas? Or MTV?
 A veteran sybarite like Marilyn Percansky doesn't get off on 
Springsteen as much as her kids do because the closest he comes to sex 
is masturbation. <br>
<br>

<br>
Hip into Mass Hip <br>
Can there have been an enzyme change among his fans? They're such nice 
people. In the well-mannered nuttiness of the Met Center, while trying 
to scribble notes, I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was Tom Boehland, a 
vendor of "institutional juices" to hospitals and nursing homes in 
Minneapolis/St. Paul. He was celebrating his twenty-fifth birthday right
 there with Bruce. He'd seen my triangular "Tunnel of Love" press pass, 
pasted on my lapel at the insistence of Barbara Carr, the iron-faced 
number two man in Landau Management, and guessed I might be Dave Marsh. 
Evil thought! No, I explained, Barbara Carr was closer to Dave than I 
was, and the triangular pass was useless, a kind of placebo for 
rock-crit types. All it could do was get you into the "hospitality 
area," where they serve up fruit juice and potato chips. To really get 
backstage you need a big rectangular pass, and that only holds the 
security guards off for a little while. Eventually they go for your 
legs, snarling like pit bulls: "Wheresa photo pass? Huh? You're not Full
 Access!" <br>
<br>
Boehland thought I was exaggerating, so on the way to the men's room I 
tried a quick dash past a security guard by way of demonstration. One of
 the guard's hands flew to his bat; the other groped his Securo-Phone, 
ready to beep in reinforcements. "Landau Management! Just testing!" I 
smiled broadly and went to join Boehland on the long line waiting to 
micturate. <br>
<br>
Springsteen was a veritable elder statesman to Tom, like John Lennon. 
Jagger was too kinky, a sort of degenerate monkey, and Dylan a Salinger 
hermit. Steve Tyler of Aerosmith and Bono of U2 were all right, but they
 didn't have any business longevity. What interested Boehland about 
Bruce was his ability to put rear ends in seats and keep them there, 
year after year. As entertainers go, the guy was as practical as a can 
opener. Plus, he was optimistic. Everybody Boehland knew was fed up with
 irony. Where could it lead? (He liked George Bush too.) <br>
<br>
The West sisters, up from Tracy, Minnesota, felt no need to philosophize
 their presence. They were plucked out of their "garbage" seats by two 
members of Landau Management and installed in the middle of the first 
row. "He always does that," Jill, sixteen, a high school student, gasps,
 "but we never thought it'd happen to us!" Landau Management, it seems, 
has a policy of reserving the two best seats in the house and then going
 into the crowd and selecting the most deserving-looking fans it can 
find and moving them up, no strings, no charge. Obviously, it's of a 
piece with the Boss's last-minute ticket drop beneficence, part of 
Landau's populist humanism, a way of compensating loyalists for the 
necessary but depersonalizing sales procedures of the last few years: 
because of the great demand for them and in order to avoid "price 
discrimination," all Springsteen tickets cost the same; when a Bruce 
concert is announced, you rush to predetermined outlets and get your 
hand stamped; this entitles you to rush to a later line to get a number;
 this guarantees you a seat, though you have to stand in a third line to
 get it, and you never know where the seat will be: "Ours were way in 
back, up top," Jill says. She's pretty but flushed and sickly looking, 
and her eyes are bugging slightly, as if someone had just hit her in the
 liver with a left hook. "You see how great he is? He knew we were here!
 He wanted us up front!" She twists around, literally unable to sit 
still, adrift in the hormonal sea that has helped populate the earth 
since Circe came on to Ulysses . . . Oddly, her sister Julie, 
twenty-six, a graphic artist, is behaving in exactly the same way. <br>
<br>
Susan Hamre, thirty-four, a blond Minneapolis book editor, is far 
cooler: "Why do I like him? His songs tell stories; he's not a little 
kid; he's got great buns." <br>
<br>
* * * <br>
<br>
Rock music, like hip, from which it drank a long transfusion, lost its 
cultural teeth years ago, as the '60s were becoming the '70s. You could 
see it when John Lennon, in thrall to a woman as ruthlessly unhip as 
Mike Tyson's is now, rolled the Beatles up; when Keith Richards, like a 
rich dowager, began having his blood changed in Switzerland; when a 
California group called the Eagles managed to sell millions of records 
by idealizing a life in the fast lane. Suddenly rock was Mass Hip, as 
shiny as a Porsche, as skinny and neutral as a line on a mirror. In a 
sense, it was the perfect resolution to an American paradox: real hip 
had been about rebellion, but rebellion sold so well! Look at Rolling 
Stone. <br>
<br>
Old-fashioned hip, which drew on a strange melange of out-law traditions
 from Camus and Genet to runaway slaves, was an attitude not easily 
translated in economic or philosophic terms (though great claims were 
made for its "existential" potential). Born in an era before the mass 
media consolidated public opinion, it produced some fixed ideas - that 
moral vision is best arrived at through sin (Rimbaud), that conformity 
can give you cancer (Mailer) - but basically, you either dug hip or you 
didn't. Mostly it assumed that man was a drag, and the cultures he 
invented were hopeless. In response, it posited a simple code: live 
fast, die young, be cool. It was a minimalist view, comfortable with the
 pessimism of modern art (post modern art is equally pessimistic but 
more cynically acquisitive-Mass Hip.) Thus, hip was a cult, 300,000 
people in a society of 240 million with a brilliant if melancholy 
membership: Jackson Pollock, James Dean, Jack Kerouac, Yardbird 
Parker...But America isn't interested in cults. <br>
<br>
Enter Springsteen. If the country's first response to its weirdest 
cultural vectors was to package and sell them, Bruce would find a way. 
Rock had already institutionalized rebellion. What was truly dangerous 
among the beatniks - a deep contempt for the profit motive, an amused 
indifference to status, a commitment to interracial sex and drug 
experimentation - was reduced in kind and substance. At its height, rock
 was a fashion revolution of long hair, costume clothes, and lost 
weight. Remaining young became a revolutionary act - "Don't trust anyone
 over thirty" - as if part of America's brain had seized in a fourth 
gear of adolescent attention, where novels sped by as three-minute 
songs, paintings were blurred album covers, and ideas flashed as 
epigrams ("To live outside the law you must be honest")...Really hip 
rockers confused speed with youth; that's why they snorted coke. <br>
<br>
Still, until Springsteen (and Michael and Prince), rock's middle-class 
performers and audience were responding to songs based on real emotion 
even if the emotion was borrowed. Keith and Mick were genuinely moved by
 Muddy Waters's "I'm a Man," for example, and updated it with the 
polymorphous energy of swinging London; Lennon was in flight from the 
sooty grimness of Liverpool life and cheered himself up with music-hall 
versions of Fats Domino and Chuck Berry; Jeff Beck split the atom of pop
 with power-chord variations on 2/4 and 4/4 time, extending the blues 
scale. Hip may have proved inadequate for dealing with the neuroses and 
psychoses of the times, but as music it was still dangerous. <br>
<br>
Springsteen simplified rock in the way Mao simplified Marx. He 
eliminated spontaneity. His guitar lines were as elementary as his 
words. Few of his songs were hummable, and his articulation - through 
canniness? - was so tortured that you couldn't understand him. Was the 
chorus of "Blinded by the Light" really "Wrapped up like a douche/In the
 rumor of the night"? (No, of course not!) Thus, he could mean anything 
you liked; you'd never be wrong! <br>
<br>
His borrowed emotion, too, was twice removed; he didn't get it from 
primary sources but interpreters (Big Boy Crudup to Elvis to Bruce), and
 he'd had no interesting experiences of his own to reroute it through. 
Like most of his audience, Bruce had grown up in front of twenty- 
one-inch screens, wearing head sets, having his consciousness 
compromised by fifteen- second spots. For him, feeling and thinking were
 a priori abstract, something you could click off, or pay for then leave
 in a theater or on a turntable (it was a sophisticated moment in Mass 
Hip when audiences realized they could buy experiences instead of having
 them). In a sense, Bruce was the greatest member of the audience, a 
kind of superfan that lesser fans elected to the stage, not be cause he 
had anything new to offer but because he was one of them, the best 
recycler of lowered expectations, the greatest retailer of mass taste, 
the finest smoother of distinctions (like TV itself), a Xerox facsimile 
of the Hip Hetero as Michael and Prince were facsimiles of Hip 
Androgynes and Reagan was a facsimile of the Straight Statesman. In a 
sales culture like ours, the fans inevitably take over, preferring 
copies to originals because they're cheaper and last longer. <br>
<br>
Hip itself was fully pacified by now, on sale at any mall; heroic 
posters of the Boss and Michael and Prince shone down from record-shop 
walls like May Day portraits in the Soviet Union; hip's sole mission was
 to move units; it even laughed at its former self; first on Saturday 
Night Live, then in silly movies like The Blues Brothers, then on the 
Letterman show, then in "comedy stores" across the country, and finally 
in callow, trust-funder magazines like Spy. If hip had once served to 
remind the culture that it should feel as well as sell, the joke was on 
all those dead rockers. <br>
<br>
* * * <br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Bruce chugged on like a carburetor; if Mass Hip hadn't been 
there to incarnate he might have become the hottest Toyota dealer in 
Matawan, growing wealthier and moodier. He'd spend months in the studio,
 only to come up dry; he'd fine old employees like Obie Dziedzic for 
failing to bring him his soup and sandwich on time, or for buying an 
insufficiently faded denim jacket to wear onstage (one hundred bucks to 
the Vietnam Vets!); Mike Batlan had to forfeit a week's pay for missing 
an air-conditioning cue at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh and 
$3II.II when one of the Boss's favorite canoes floated away in a storm; 
he married and unmarried model Julianne Phillips (amid rumors of 
proletarian manhandling); he began a tabloid-reported affair with Patti 
Scialfa, a liaison virtually mandated by the public, which had never 
liked the tall, unassuming Julianne, preferring Springsteen single. 
Personnel left the band: "Miami" Steve Van Zandt, a longtime E Street 
stalwart, after fights with Landau over money and producing credits; 
Doug Sutphin, after being docked a week's pay for touching Nils 
Lofgren's guitar; Marc Brickman, Bruce's veteran lighting man, over 
personality clashes with Landau and George Travis, Springsteen's 
authoritarian road manager. As the European leg of the "Tunnel of Love" 
tour ended last summer, rumors had Bruce breaking up the band because it
 "was no longer efficient" (Deep Squeak), that, as with any winning 
enterprise, "fine tuning" was necessary. Look at the 3M Company! Or the 
Yankees! <br>
<br>
At the end of the American tour, in Madison Square Garden, Springsteen 
committed eleven faux finales-multiple climaxes seem to be his way of 
resolving a show that is all climax: "Part Man, Part Monkey" (no 
acknowledgment to Jagger) smashed into "Dancing in the Dark" which 
blitzed into "Light of Day" which was cooled down by the new, 
acoustically revised "Born to Run" (Brooocers are now constrained from 
just digging out in their ol' cars because "all you're lookin' for is 
home an' family anyway!"); he then geared up again with "Hungry Heart," 
"Glory Days," and "Raise Your Hand." <br>
<br>
Scialfa and the E Street Band were sagging, but Springsteen wore the 
crazed look of De Niro as LaMorta in Raging Bull, wringing wet, hair 
plastered, stomping relentlessly... He led the band down a hole in the 
middle of the stage, punching at the rafters, only to return a moment 
later with a towel around his neck and his clenched rictus grin: " DO YA
 LIKE GOOD MUSIC?" he roared, and here came E Street, doggedly blaring, 
like Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrows Italian-American Brass Band on the 
Feast of Saint Anthony in South Philly...The suburban fans obviously 
ululate like mandrills: Broooce! Brooooooce!! Jon Landau was up there 
now, playing guitar, fifty pounds heavier than I remembered him from 
Rolling Stone, balding, but with that same "I got the goldfish bowl" 
smile...Barbara Carr was banging a tambourine, too, wearing a tiny 
microskirt just like Scialfa's, matte black, a sealskin in the sun, and 
perhaps fusion-tailored by the scientists at CBS to lie precisely on the
 no-man's-land of decency without riding up... <br>
<br>
It was ten basketball crowds from ten middling schools, no drugs, no 
beer even, Dad waiting on Eighth Avenue in the Acura for the young ones,
 so clean and nice and undemanding in their canonization. One girl, 
Stephanie Catalano, twenty-four, of Allenhurst, New Jersey, who sold 
jewelry, had taken the train to the city (it had been raining for three 
days), had stood dripping in all the ticket lines, had stood in more 
lines for hamburgers and Cokes, and now didn't even mind her terrible 
seat at the far end of the hall, halfway up the wall. Did she, you know,
 want to meet Bruce, or anything? "Oh no!" she said quickly. "It's not 
like that at all..." <br>
<br>
Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the well-known TV sex-therapist personality, 
happened to be sitting nearby, and I asked her what she thought of 
Springsteen and hipness and all these kids' reactions: <br>
<br>
"Hip, schmip," she beamed. "It just proves what I've been saying all 
along. You don't have to act crazy to have fun and make money! Bruce is a
 national monument. This is what America's about!"</div>

The Aquarian , September 23, 1978<br>
By Mike Greenblatt<br>
<br>
We've been sitting on a bench facing the ocean near the Casino Arena in 
Asbury Park. It's 45 minutes past our appointed meeting time with Bruce 
Springsteen and we're trying to light matches in the wind. It's past 
1:30 now and we're wondering if he's going to show up. Hell, it's a 
beautiful sunny fall day, one of his very few days off from a grueling 
whirlwind tour of the country. And it's his birthday to boot. Maybe he 
just ain't gonna show. <br>
<br>
But we're determined. We're prepared to wait for two more hours. Then, 
if he's still not here, we'll split. We've already tired of scrutinizing
 all the faces for something that will tell us it's him in disguise. We 
forgot our quest and go back to the matches. <br>
<br>
"Hi", he says as he walks right up at us. "Sorry I'm late, I just got 
up." He's dressed in a blueish work-shirt and jeans. He has ever-present
 sunglasses on. We decide to break the ice over lunch. <br>
<br>
Settling into a booth at the Convention Hall Coffee Shop, I order a BLT,
 photographer Sorce a cheeseburger, and Bruce a hamburger, french fries 
and coke.<br>
<br>
"Yeah, we had a real rep", Bruce starts to say. "We could draw two, 
maybe three thousand people on any given night. We played our own 
concerts here and also down south. It's weird. Nobody would ever book us
 because we never did any Top-40. Never. We used to play all old soul 
stuff. Chuck Berry, just the thing we liked. That's why we couldn't get 
booked. We made enough to eat though." <br>
<br>
The waitresses are starting to mill about the table so Bruce puts his 
shades back on and hushes up his tone. "The other night was amazing", he
 wispers. "I went to see Animal house, and when I came out of the 
theater there was a whole bunch of people that started following me to 
the parking lot. I wound up signing autographs for over an hour." <br>
<br>
"Anyway, after a while the kicks started to wear off and a lot of the 
time we didn't make enough to eat. That's why i signed with Mike 
(Appel). Anything was better than what was happening at the time." <br>
<br>
Little did the local rocker know that this early signing with Mike Appel
 would result in the latter claiming rights to the early material 
Springsteen had written. The rest of the courtroom drama is famous. 
Perhaps generously, Bruce had nothing bad to say about his former 
manager. <br>
<br>
"He did a lot of good for me at that time", he says, dipping one 
particularly long french fry into a mound of ketchup. "He introduced me 
to John Hammond (CBS bigwig responsible for signing Dylan, Aretha 
Franklin, Billie Holiday, Bessie Smith and others). He helped me on that
 first album". He pauses as if he were ruminating on something. "I 
haven't seen him since that day." <br>
<br>
"Actually, I was pretty shielded from the whole thing", he continues. 
"Mike put the onus on Jon (Landau), claiming he was the culprit." <br>
<br>
I ask: You mean he charged Landau with stealing you away from him? <br>
<br>
"Yeah, sort of. I was never good at the business end of things." <br>
<br>
Asked about the famous line Landau wrote for his Real Paper review ("I 
saw rock and roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen"), Bruce 
says, "That line is misrepresentative of the whole review. It's funny. 
The review was nothing like that one line. It got taken out of context" -
 another myth shattered. <br>
<br>
"I remember playing in a club where an earlier review that Jon wrote was
 splashed all over the outside wall. I was leaning against the wall, 
smoking a cigarette, when Jon practically bumped right into me. I had 
never met him. We hit it off right away." <br>
<br>
"When asked if he ever gave up during the long months of inactivity, 
Bruce still remains bright, completely devoid of bitterness. " I knew 
that it was just a matter of time. We were playing almost throughout 
that whole episode even though we weren't supposed to. I mean, what kind
 of law is it that is written specifically to stop a man from doing what
 he does to make his money?" <br>
<br>
"The only real frustrating thing which did cause me grief was the fact 
that my songs weren't my own. I didn't own my own songs. That hurt." <br>
<br>
But that makes it all the more satisfying now. At Nassau Coliseum, 
thousands of kids screaming their guts out for him before he even played
 a song. They didn't let up until he finished, drained and exhausted. At
 the Capitol Theatre, two nights before, he was surprised onstage by a 
giant birthday cake out of which a scantily clad girl bounced. He swears
 he didn't know a thing about it ("I even told John Scher no cakes"). At
 Madison square Garden, 18,000 fans leand on every note as if it were 
the last they would ever hear. A gala party was held for him in the 
plush Penn Plaza Club located deep inside the bowels of the Garden. 
Security was the tightest I'd ever witnessed. <br>
<br>
We paid for the food and split for the beach. The conversation continued
 amid the sea, the wind and the hovering presence of the Casino Arena. <br>
<br>
"I'm into a little photography myself", Bruce says as Sorce adjusts his 
light meter. "I took some pictures of Lynnie (Lynn goldsmith, 
photographer) that were published somewhere." <br>
<br>
When asked about his other interests, Bruce talks of softball. "Yeah, we
 used to play hard. we had to stop, though, when Clarence and myself 
used to get too battered up. We'd go on stage all wracked up and it 
would hurt. After a while, it got too important and too many people were
 into it. There's no softball on this tour. What else do I like? Hmmm, 
I'll tell ya...not too much besides music. Right now, music is it. I 
don't care about anything else." <br>
<br>
We get back to talking of copy bands and the difference between making 
it with your own material and making good money playing copies. I tell 
Bruce I had to play "Shake Your Booty" to get booked anywhere. <br>
<br>
"Shake Your Booty?" laughs Bruce, falling into the sand. "That's a great
 song. KC, man, he's great! He always comes out with those repetitive 
things. Over and over and over, that kind of stuff is great! It's like 
the 'Louie, Louie' of today." <br>
<br>
Later on, in talking about what is written about him, he says, "I have 
Glen (Glen Brunman, CBS publicist) mail me everything that's written 
about me. Hundreds of things, man. I read them all at once. That way I 
can get a pretty good perspective on what my press is like, rather than 
reading one thing at a time." <br>
<br>
"Near the end of Darkness, I wasn't doing any interviews", Bruce 
continues. "Then I did them until I noticed myself saying the same 
things to different people. There's only one answer to each question; 
you don't want to lie to these people. I really had myself in a spin. 
And each interview was a multiple interview situation with two or three 
people at once. I guess the problem was that I did too many of 'em." 
Walking off the beach, we talk of the Garden shows and his stretcher 
routine, whereby he sings himself silly until he has to be taken off the
 stage in a stretcher, only to break free and grab the microphone again 
until he's forcibly restrained from the stage. <br>
<br>
That's a great routine. Where'd you get that from? I ask. I know that 
professional wrestling has a stretcher routine where the good guy gets 
beat so bad they have to carry him off in a stretcher and the bad guy 
always kicks him off of it as it passes by. It's classic. <br>
<br>
"No", answers Bruce, "I didn't even know about that. We got it from 
James Brown. He used to get himself so worked up that the bassist led 
him offstage wrapped in a cape. He'd throw the cape off his shoulders 
and come running back to the mikestand some two or three times. It drove
 'em wild. So that's where we got the idea for the stretcher routine." <br>
<br>
Sliding into the front seat of a borrowed '78 burnt yellow Camaro, Bruce
 at the wheel, we're on our way to the neighborhood where he grew up in 
Freehold. Shoving a cassette into the receptable, he says, "A fan gave 
this to me outside a concert once. it's real good tape." <br>
<br>
He turns up the volume, guns the motor and shifts into second. We take 
off. He turns up the volume a little more and starts looking for "Hello 
Mary Lou" by Rick Nelson. "This song has one of the greatest guitar 
parts ever on it." <br>
<br>
He can't find the tune and settles for oldies like "If You Wanna Be 
Happy For the Rest of Your Life (Never Make a Pretty Woman your Wife)" 
and "Blue Suede Shoes". He shifts into third. <br>
<br>
Now for the first time, we do not talk. The music is loud and damn 
appealing. The windows are down so the wind is whipping furiously into 
the car. He shifts into fourth and takes off. <br>
<br>
We're rolling now. We settle uncomfortably behind a slow driver. He 
checks his rear-view mirror and roars past the driver. Seeing another 
slow-mover right ahead, he stays in the opposite lane and passes two in 
one fell swoop before settling comfortably back on the right. From the 
back, Sorce lets out a soft "Whew!" <br>
<br>
It's great moment. Chuck Berry is wailing out with "Maybelline". Bruce 
is going faster. It's such a fuckin' beautiful day. The wind is rushing 
in and Bruce is feeling good, snapping his fingers, clapping his hands 
and letting out with a hoarse vocal or two on the last line of each 
verse. "Hello Mary Lou" finally comes on and suddenly everything is 
crystallized in one magic moment - the speed, the music, the sun, the 
wind, the company. Jeezez Christ! We're rolling down the highway with 
fuckin' Bruce Springsteen at the wheel! And he's driving the way you 
would think Bruce Springsteen would drive. <br>
<br>
Later, when we reach a light, Bruce impatiently waits on it before 
saying, "This is what we used to call a 'quarterback sneak'"", and with 
that he takes off surreptitiously past the red light. <br>
<br>
We're in the old neighborhood now. Bruce drives slowly down Institute 
Street until he reaches the right number. It's been painted now. "I 
lived here all through grammar school. There's a Nestle's factory near 
here. Man, when it rained we smelled that stuff all day long." <br>
<br>
The elder Springsteen would go to work in the morning, come home, go to 
sleep and wake up and go back to work at the factory. "I guess there was
 other things he wanted," Bruce reflects. <br>
<br>
We get back into the car and drive over to the factory. "Both my 
grandfather and my father worked here. It used to be a rug mill in the 
old days, but for some reason it ran out of business fairly quick. I was
 pretty young at the time." <br>
<br>
When I ask about high school, Bruce clams up. "It wasn't exactly the 
best time of my life because I didn't graduate with any of the others. 
It was a rough period." I could see he really doesn't pursue this avenue
 too long so I drop it. But I wonder what mystery is veiled beneath this
 wall of secrecy. <br>
<br>
We get back into the car and tear out of there. Ironically enough, the 
tape Bruce shoves into the machine this time is an old Animals cassette.
 The first song could be a forerunner to much of the music Bruce writes.
 As the opening line comes out of the speakers, the dusty factory is 
just fading from view..."In this dirty old part of the city/Where the 
sun refuses to shine/People say that there ain't no use in trying/My 
little girl you're so young and pretty/And one thing I know is 
true/You'll be dead before your time is due, yes you will/See my daddy 
in bed ad night/See his hair a' turnin' grey/He's been working and 
slaving his life away, yes he has. The song is, of cours, "We Gotta Get 
Out of This Place", and it was a fitting omen as we drove off. <br>
<br>
As we drove, Bruce starts reminiscing. "Yeah, I lived in practically 
every single town around here, from Atlantic Highlands to Bradley Beach.
 We used to move quite often. <br>
<br>
"That's where I had my very first gig," he laughs as we pass a mobile 
setup. Looking out of the window, the 10 or 20 mobile homes facing us 
look worn and old. "The gig wasn't bad...for our first job." <br>
<br>
Hey Bruce, are you gonna show up at the Capitol again like you did last 
year on New Year's Eve? I ask him. It was announced earlier in the week 
that Southside Johnny &amp; the Asbury Jukes would again party away the 
year in such grand fashion. Bruce turns around and answers, "I don't 
know where I'm gonna be on New Year's Eve. <br>
<br>
"C'mon, I'll show you where my surfin' buddies used to live," he says, 
changing the subject. We swerve sharply off the highway onto an exit. 
"This used to be a surfboard factory," he says. We step out of the car 
near a small white building. <br>
<br>
"Yeah, me and a fella named Tinker lived here for a year and a half, in 
one room. All the rest of this area used to be nothin' but sand dunes." 
He points to a huge expanse of stores, houses and construction. "None of
 this was here." <br>
<br>
"They used to make the surfboards downstairs. Tinker and I, we had a 
ball. Just one room! Two beds, a fridge and a TV - the rest of the room 
was filled with surfboards." <br>
<br>
"Since I was from Freehold, I was considered inland. All these guys used
 to surf every day. I was friends with 'em all but never went. Finally, 
they got to me. One afternoon they were merciless. They just kept 
taunting me and kidding me about not surfing that it just sorta got me 
riled. I grabbed a board and we all headed out to the beach. <br>
<br>
"I must have been some sight surfing for the first time, but I'll tell 
you something - I got the hang of it pretty quick. Hell, it ain't harder
 than anything else. It's like riding a bike. I haven't surfed in 
awhile. Now that's something I'd love to do. As a matter of fact, I 
think I will." <br>
<br>
He seems resolute. <br>
<br>
He continues: "This guy Jesse taught me the finer points of surfing. We 
used to stay in North End Beach in Long Branch all the time. Some guy 
owned the beach so we had the use of it for almost two whole years. We'd
 be there every day. We'd stay on the beach, go in the water. It was 
great. <br>
<br>
"This area is really amazing. There's really poor neighborhoods and then
 there's real nice neighborhoods all in a five-mile radius. <br>
<br>
"I used to go to New York a lot back then. I played at the Cafe Wha? a 
lot in '68. I used to play there with Jerry Walker's old group, Circus 
Maximus. Let's see, I played the Night Owl (all these places were in the
 West Village). They had a lot of good bands there at the time - the 
Raves, Robin &amp; the Hoods. Let's see, the Mothers of Invention were 
playing all the time in that area and so were the Fugs. <br>
<br>
"I didn't go to too many concerts then. I much preferred playing and 
jamming with these people. There was a whole 'nother scene taking place 
over in the East Village that I wasn't part of at all - the Fillmore, 
the Electric Circus. I think my first experience seeing a rock star was 
going to Steve Paul's Scene and seeing Johnny Winter. That was really 
something. I remember between sets, he came out and sat at the very next
 table from me and my friends." <br>
<br>
Let's go back to Asbury, I suggest. <br>
<br>
Asking Bruce if he'd take me back to the old Upstage site where he held 
court almost every night, he gladly obliges and we get out of the car 
again in what could be termed downtown Asbury. <br>
<br>
"I gotta be cool," Bruce chuckles. "I ran out of here without paying the rent." <br>
<br>
We walk over to the site, which is upstairs from a shoe store. <br>
<br>
"I lived here while Greetings From Asbury Park was being made. I slept 
in my sleeping bag on my friend's floor for a good portion of that 
album." <br>
<br>
Bruce poses for pics while people pass by right and left. Surprisingly 
enough, nobody recognizes him (or if they do, they keep on walking). <br>
<br>
"I'm lucky in that respect. What happened in the movies the other night 
is a rarity. Usually, I don't get recognized. I don't have that 
instantly recognizable feature that a lot of other people have." <br>
<br>
Yeah, like Frampton's hair, I reply. <br>
<br>
"My folks had already moved to California," Bruce remembers, "and I was out of high school by the time I got to Asbury. <br>
<br>
"Asbury was a great place for us to play. We played here an awful lot." <br>
<br>
In answering questions about his immidiate future, Bruce says, "I have 
one more day off before we finish the tour. Then I have a whole month 
off before we start up again. In February we go back into the studio for
 work on the next album. I'm hoping it will be out by next summer." <br>
<br>
Just for the record, the tour ended officially in Atlanta on Oct. 1. It 
started in Buffalo on May 23. The new tour starts (possibly in New 
Jersey) on Nov. 1 and finishes by Dec. 20. If the time it took to cut 
Darkness is any indicator, then number five will be lucky to hit the 
stands by the summer after next. <br>
<br>
The just-finished tour took in 70 cities and 86 shows in four months and
 eight days. That's why Bruce has to be listed as a "great guy" to do up
 an afternoon on one of his rare days off. Another highly impressive 
thing is that he spent the whole day without the protective cradle of a 
publicist's presence. Rarely have I done an interview without the 
artist's publicist in tow. <br>
<br>
In talking about the current LP, Bruce says, "The guy who took the cover
 shot for that album is a friend of mine from south Jersey who works 
fulltime in a meat market. The shots were taken at his house. He's a 
great photographer." <br>
<br>
Bruce's only comment about the self-destructive syndrome 
(dope-money-power) affecting so many rock stars is that "they let all 
the other things become more important than playing. Playing is the 
important thing. Once you forget that, you've had it." <br>
<br>
Bruce, obviously, hasn't forgotten that. He's been having fun with music
 since the start. Bruce Springsteen is the perfect assimilator of many 
styles - Chuck Berry/Stones/Elvis/Buddy Holly/ Dylan/Little 
Richard/Animals. His image on stage is also an amalgamation of many 
images - Elvis/young Brando/James Dean. Somehow he melds all of these 
influences into one cohesive framework for his own strikingly original 
material. The man is all that he has devoured musically from the time he
 started listening to music, and it all pours out of hime every time he 
steps on stage. "That Elvis, man," Bruce says, "he is all there is. 
There ain't no more. Everything starts and ends with him. He wrote the 
book. He is everything to do and not to do in the business." <br>
<br>
If Elvis Presley is Bruce's prototype then Bruce, himself, is the focus 
for a lot of envy and speculation. We all have fantasies - Bruce 
included - of making it big and living as stars. Well, Bruce is living 
the ultimate realization of that fantasy right now. He's made it through
 all the bullshit inherent in such a proposition. He's doing it. And 
doing it in style. <br>
<br>
Yet if you talk to him, he's quite humble. Ask him what part he played 
in the writing of "Because the Night" and he'll tell you that he only 
wrothe the title line (although he admits he will probably put it on his
 next album.) <br>
<br>
Seeing him so close up and listening to him speak makes one realize 
that, although not articulate, there is a certain aura about him. A 
certain intangible. His charisma is the well-worn persona of the working
 man. His handsome/beautiful face could even make the transition to the 
silver screen as a prophet of the proletariat. His facial features are 
tough, yet there's a certain hardness to him. You'd swear he's Italian 
before you're told of his Dutch descent. <br>
<br>
His enthusiasm is real. The moment when Gary U.S. Bonds came over the 
car speakers with "Quarter to Three" - that's when Bruce really started 
to groove. The song is in his encores in most of his performances. He 
still loves the original and still sings along with it when it comes on.
 <br>
<br>
The essence of rock and roll can be distilled into a performance that a 
fella by the name of Bobby Lewis did on American Bandstand many years 
ago. Lewis performed "Tossin' and Turnin'" on the show, lip-synched it, 
and drove the small television studio crazy with his slips and slides. 
Host Dick Clark did a never-before-done-thing - he, in his madness of 
the moment, screamed for Lewis to perform the same song again. The sound
 man cued it up and Lewis went back out onto the stage and really tore 
into it this time, twisting, turning, giving it all he had. By now his 
lip motions were completely out-of-synch with the record being played, 
but it didn't matter. It was a piece of rock and roll heaven. And one, 
I'm sure, Bruce Springsteen would have enjoyed.</div>

Nick Hornby has always been a Springsteen fan, and listened to his music
 every day while writing his latest bestseller. But he never had the 
chance to meet his hero - until The Boss came to London for his recent 
Royal Albert Hall shows. In this OMM exclusive, the star reveals how he 
keeps abreast of modern music via his son, and why the likes of 'Born to
 Run' continue to inspire<br>
<br>
Nick Hornby<br>
Observer Music Monthly, Sunday 17 July 2005<br>
<br>
Still the Boss: Bruce Springsteen<br>
<br>
Earlier on in the week that I met Bruce Springsteen, and before I knew I
 was going to meet him, I'd decided I was going to send him a copy of my
 new book. I got his home address off a mutual friend, and signed it to 
him, and the book was lying around in my office in an unstamped Jiffy 
bag when the editor of this magazine asked if I'd like to do this 
interview. So I took the book with me.<br>
<br>
I wasn't expecting him to read the bloody thing, nor even to keep it, 
and yet even so it seemed like something I needed to do. A Long Way Down
 was fuelled by coffee, Silk Cuts and Bruce (specifically, a 1978 live 
bootleg recording of 'Prove it all Night', which I listened to a lot on 
the walk to my office as I was finishing the book). And Springsteen is 
one of the people who made me want to write in the first place, and one 
of the people who has, through words and deeds, helped me to think about
 the career I have had since that initial impulse. It seems to me that 
his ability to keep his working life fresh and compelling while working 
within the mainstream is an object lesson to just about anyone whose 
work has any sort of popular audience.<br>
<br>
The first time I met him was after his Friday night show at the Royal 
Albert Hall, at a party in an upmarket West End hotel. He talked with an
 impressive ferocity and fluency to a little group of us about why he 
demanded restraint from his fans during the solo shows. The following 
afternoon I went to the soundcheck for the Saturday show, and sat on my 
own in the auditorium while he played 'My Father's House', from 
Nebraska. It wasn't the sort of experience you forget in a hurry. I 
interviewed him in his dressing room, and I was nervous: I have, in 
transcribing the questions, made them seem more cogent than they 
actually were.<br>
<br>
He looked younger than the last time I saw him, and he's clearly 
incredibly fit; he changed his shirt for the photographer, and I could 
tell that he does a lot more two-and-a-half hour shows than I do. He was
 pleasant and friendly, but though he asked after a couple of younger 
musicians who both he and I know, there wasn't much small talk; his 
answers came in unbroken yet very carefully considered streams. He is 
one of the few artists I've met who is able to talk cogently about what 
he does without sounding either arrogant or defensively 
self-deprecating.<br>
<br>
I gave him the book, and he thanked me. I have no idea whether the 
cleaner took it home, but it didn't matter much to me either way.<br>
<br>
Nick Hornby: I was thinking when I was watching the show last night that
 maybe when you play with the band you can at least say to yourself, 'I 
know why people are coming to see us. We're good at what we do, and 
there's this dynamic between us.' But when it's you on your own, you 
can't tell yourself that any more. How does that feel? Have you got to a
 stage in life where it doesn't feel weird that so many people come to 
see only you?<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen: I performed like this in different periods of most of
 my playing life before I made records (1) [for footnotes see below]. It
 just so happens that I didn't do it on the Nebraska tour, maybe I was 
feeling unsure about ... I hadn't performed by myself in a while. It 
feels very natural to me, and I assume people come for the very same 
reasons as they do when I'm with the band: to be moved, for something to
 happen to them. So I think the same things that make people plunk down 
their hard-earned bucks for the tickets, it works both ways. You're 
looking for an experience and something that contextualises, as best as 
possible, a piece of the world. I'm just taking a different road to it 
out there at night. It's the same thing, you know?<br>
<br>
NH: It's always struck me that you work very hard on the stage side of 
things, that you have a theory of stagecraft. Is that right?<br>
<br>
BS: Well, I don't know if I've worked hard at it. It's always felt 
natural, because I'm generally very comfortable with people. That's 
probably genetic in some fashion (laughs). There is a presentation and I
 think being aware of the fact that there's a show going on is a good 
idea (laughs) (2). I think it fell into some disrepute when the idea of 
the show became linked to falseness in some fashion, which is a 
superficial way to look at it. It's actually a bridge when used 
appropriately. It's simply a bridge for your ideas to reach the 
audience. It assists the music in connecting and that's what you're out 
there for. I think if you do it wrong, you can diminish your work, but 
if you do it right you can lightly assist what you're doing. It can be 
an enormous asset in reaching people with what might be otherwise 
difficult material. I have a large audience coming to see this kind of 
music, an audience which in other circumstances would not be there. The 
audiences are there as a result of my history with the band but also as a
 result of my being able to reach people with a tune. I have my ideas, I
 have my music and I also just enjoy showing off [laughs], so that's a 
big part of it. Also, I like to get up onstage and behave insanely or 
express myself physically, and the band can get pretty silly. But even 
in the course of an evening like this there's a way that you sort of 
attenuate the evening. Your spoken voice is a part of it - not a big 
part of it, but it's something. It puts people at ease, and once again 
kind of reaches out and makes a bridge for what's otherwise difficult 
music.<br>
<br>
NH: I think that's right. Those shows where you borrowed things from 
James Brown ... I think some people did find it troubling that this 
music is supposed to be real and authentic and yet there's this 
stagecraft, this messing around, at the same time (3). I think the 
people who get the shows always see that there's not a contradiction.<br>
<br>
BS: Plus, you know, when I was young, there was a lot of respect for 
clowning in rock music - look at Little Richard. It was a part of the 
whole thing, and I always also believed that it released the audience. 
And it was also a way that you shrunk yourself down to a certain sort of
 life-size (laughs) but I also enjoyed it, I had fun with it, and I 
never thought that seriousness and clowning were exclusive, so I've 
approached my work and my stagecraft with the idea that they're not 
exclusive. You can go from doing something quite silly to something dead
 serious in the blink of an eye, and if you're making those connections 
with your audience then they're going to go right along with it.<br>
<br>
NH: What have you been listening to the past couple of years?<br>
<br>
BS: I listen to all kinds of things, you know? Take your choice. [He 
reaches into a bag and pulls out a whole heap of home-made CDs.] I've 
made all this music for walking ... A lot of this is a little 
acoustic-oriented but I hear everything. I hear all the Britpop stuff, 
the Stone Roses and Oasis, and I go on to Suede and Pulp. I'm generally 
interested in almost everything.<br>
<br>
NH: For the benefit of the tape I'm looking at CDs which feature Dylan 
and Sleater Kinney and the Beach Boys and Jimmy Cliff and Sam Cooke and 
Bobby Bland and Joe Strummer; pretty much the whole history of recorded 
music.<br>
<br>
BS: I left a lot of my more rock things off, because this is my walking 
music. But I listen to old music; some Louis Armstrong stuff recently. 
And then I'll listen to, I don't know, Four Tet or something. I do a lot
 of curiosity buying; I buy it if I like the album cover, I buy it if I 
like the name of the band, anything that sparks my imagination. I still 
like to go to record stores, I like to just wander around and I'll buy 
whatever catches my attention ... Maybe I'll read a good review of 
something or even an interesting review. But then I go through long 
periods where I don't listen to things, usually when I'm working. In 
between the records and in between the writing I suck up books and music
 and movies and anything I can find.<br>
<br>
NH: And is that part of the process of writing for you?<br>
<br>
BS: I don't think it has to be. I tend to be a subscriber to the idea 
that you have everything you need by the time you're 12 years old to do 
interesting writing for most of the rest of your life - certainly by the
 time you're 18. But I do find it helps me with form, in that something 
may just inspire me, may give me an idea as to the form I'm going to 
create something in, or maybe the setting. Ten or 12 years ago, nature 
writing struck my imagination and it's seeped into my work a little bit 
here and there ever since.. It's all kinds of things. I heard this live 
version of 'Too Much Monkey Business' by Chuck Berry and it sounds so 
close to punk music. So when you go to record with your band, you have 
all those sounds, you've created a bank. I like to stay as awake and as 
alert as I can. And I enjoy it too, I have a lot of interest in it ... I
 like not being sealed off from what's going on culturally.<br>
<br>
NH: Have you got to the stage where your kids are introducing you to things?<br>
<br>
BS: Yeah, my son likes a lot of guitar bands. He gave me something the 
other day which was really good. He'll burn a CD for me full of things 
that he has, so he's a pretty good call if I want to check some of that 
stuff out ... The other two aren't quite into that yet. My daughter's 
12, 13, and she likes the top 40. So I end up at the Z100 Christmas 
show, sitting in the audience with my daughter and her friends watching 
every top 40 act ... I'm all over the place.<br>
<br>
NH: How did that Suicide thing come about (4)?<br>
<br>
BS: I met Alan [Vega] in the late Seventies. I was just a fan. I liked 
them, they were unique. They're very dreamy, they have a dreamy quality,
 and they were also incredibly atmospheric and were going were others 
weren't. I just enjoyed them a lot. I happened to hear that song 
recently, I came across a compilation that it was on and it's very 
different at the end of the night. It's just those few phrases repeated,
 very mantra-like.<br>
<br>
NH: It's especially striking in a show that's built almost exclusively on narrative.<br>
<br>
BS: Right, but it's the fundamental idea behind all of the songs anyway 
(5). (Laughs) It's just a different moment at the end of the night, 
where you go to some of the same places with virtually very few words. I
 like narrative storytelling as being part of a tradition, a folk 
tradition. But this envelops the night. It's interesting watching 
people's faces. They look very different while that's happening. It's a 
look of some surprise, and that's part of what I set the night up for - 
unconventional pieces at the top to surprise the audience and to also 
make them aware that it's not going to be a regular night. It's going to
 be a night of all different things and the ritualistic aspect of the 
night is dispelled. As long as it's not something that I've done before 
...<br>
<br>
NH: How do you think of your relationship with your own material? 
Because when you were here with the band a couple of years ago, you were
 playing stuff from the first three albums and some of those you were 
doing solo as well. And yet last night I think there was one song from 
the first four albums ...<br>
<br>
BS: Is that right? On certain nights I'll play more. I think I played 
'For You' for a while ... It depends. My only general rule was to steer 
away from things I played with the band over the past couple of tours. I
 was interested in re-shaping the Rising material for live shows, so 
people could hear the bare bones of that. And the new material and [The 
Ghost of] Tom Joad and Nebraska gets a nod, and I think 'Tunnel of Love'
 comes up. I play 'Racing in the Street' ... I haven't played much off 
Born to Run. It's predicated on anything that doesn't have a formulated 
response built in.<br>
<br>
NH: Does it feel like young man's music to you now, the first three, four records?<br>
<br>
BS: I would say that it is, you know, because a lot of young people 
actually mention those records to me. I remember I was playing over here
 a while back and I was staring down and there was a kid, he couldn't 
have been more than 14, 15, he was mouthing every word to us, Greetings 
From Asbury Park, literally word for word and this kid - forget about 
it, his parents were the glimmer in somebody's eye [laughs]. In some 
ways I suppose it is, but also a good song takes years to find itself. 
When I go back and play 'Thunder Road' or something, I can sing very 
comfortably from my vantage point because a lot of the music was about a
 loss of innocence, there's innocence contained in you but there's also 
innocence in the process of being lost [laughs]. And that was the 
country at the time I wrote that music. I wrote that music immediately 
preceding the end of the Vietnam war, when that feeling swept the 
country. A part of me was interested in music which contained that 
innocence, the Spector stuff, a lot of the Fifties and Sixties 
rock'n'roll, but I myself wasn't one of those people. I realised I 
wasn't one of my heroes, I was something else and I had to take that 
into consideration. So when I wrote that music and incorporated a lot of
 the things I loved from those particular years, I was also aware that I
 had to set in place something that acknowledged what had happened to me
 and everybody else where I lived.<br>
<br>
NH: I presume that's where the emotional connection with your music came
 for so many people at the time. Because all those people had grown up 
loving that music, but it wasn't doing the job any more.<br>
<br>
BS: I think we were a funny amalgam of things at that moment. There was 
so much familiarity in the music that for a lot of people it felt like 
home; it touched either your real memories or just your imaginary home, 
the place that you think of when you think of your home town, or who you
 were, or who you might have been. And the music collected those things,
 so there was an element that made you feel comfortable. And yet at the 
same time we were in the process of moving some place else, and that was
 acknowledged in my music also, and that's why I think people felt 
deeply about it.<br>
<br>
I think that it made some people comfortable, and there were stylistic 
things that caught people's ears, that they were used to hearing ... but
 that alone wouldn't have made people feel very deeply, it was the other
 stuff. That's why 'Born to Run' resonates and 'Thunder Road'; people 
took that music and they really made it theirs. I think I worked hard 
for that to happen. I am providing a service and it's one that I like to
 think is needed. It's at the core of trying to do it right, from year 
to year. It's the motive when you go out there. You want that reaction: 
'Hey, I know that kid. That's me!'. Because I still remember that my 
needs were very great, and they were addressed by things that people at 
the time thought were trash, popular music and B-movies ... But I found a
 real self in them that helped me make sense of the self that I grew up 
with - the person I actually was.<br>

Testimony from the Howling Dog Choir (or Tramps Like Us, Baby We're Born Again)<br>
Creem , 1978-10<br>
By Robert Duncan<br>
<br>
The middle-aged white man who runs the biggest oldies shop in the very 
old city of New Orleans is ranting hysterically on the edge of tears. He
 has recently seen the movie American Hot Wax and senses that history 
has passed him by one last time. <br>
<br>
"That's right. I was a disk jockey in Canton, Ohio when Alan Freed was a
 d.j. in Akron. I was playing nigger records, and you know what Alan 
Freed was playing??? He was playing country &amp; western! Country &amp;
 western music! Then he starts playing nigger records and they fire him 
after a day. One day. <br>
<br>
"Well, I'm sitting in this coffee shop with him afterwards, and he's 
stirring his coffee real slow and looking over my shoulder out the 
window. I says to him, 'Alan, just look at what you're doing. 'And he 
says, 'What?' And I say, 'Alan, you're stirring your goddamn coffee with
 a spoon! And there's the cream and sugar sitting right over there and 
you haven't put a one of them in!' <br>
<br>
"Then I tell him that I'm just going to have to write his next contract 
for him and that he's not going to get fired no more! A no-fire 
contract! I told him that you got to ask for what you want' cause if you
 don't, they figure you ain't worth nothin' anyway! And I did it! I did 
the contract! I did his contract! Listen to me! I created Alan Feed!!! 
Did you read that in the history??? Did you see that in the goddamn 
movie??? I said, Did you see that in that goddamn movie???" <br>
<br>
And he falls into a little red-faced jig behind his cash register with 
one arm stretching forward to detain us further and the other stretching
 beseechingly towards the sky. All we asked was how much for a Huey 
Smith record. <br>
<br>
*** <br>
<br>
Several hundred miles up the road from New Orleans, in an empty, 
hermetically modern conference room that is acutely air conditioned 
against the buttery summer air, Bruce Springsteen, who's never met the 
white man in New Orleans, tells me what he has been thinking about. <br>
<br>
"It's a real simple story. You grow up, and they bury you. They keep 
throwing dirt on you, throwing dirt on and dirt on, and some guys they 
bury so deep they never get out. Six foot, twelve foot down. Other guys,
 something comes along and they're able to get some of it away. They get
 a hand free or they get free one way or another. <br>
<br>
"I don't think you ever really blow it all off, but the idea is to keep 
charging. It's like anything. Everybody can't make it. You can see the 
guys on the street who aren't going to make it, and that's a frightening
 thing. <br>
<br>
"That's what I'm talking about. That some people get dug in so deep that
 there's a point where it stops getting shovelled on them and they roll 
over and start digging down. They literally roll over and start digging 
down themselves. Because they don't know which way is up. You get down 
so deep that you don't know which way's up. You don't know if you're 
digging sideways, up, down, you don't know.. until something comes 
along, if you,re lucky, and shakes you 'til all of a sudden you have a 
certain sense of direction and at least know where you're going. <br>
<br>
"A lot of people don't ever get that. You go into the bars and you see 
the guys wandering around in there who got the crazy eyes. They just 
hate. They're just looking for an immediate expenditure of all this 
build-up. They're just screaming to throw it all off. But you can't and 
it turns into, like, death throes. A guy walks into a bar, a little guy,
 and he walks up to another guy, a dome, and the little guy's looking to
 get creamed. Looking to get massacred. He wants to. 'Look,' he's 
saying, 'I'm dying here and I don't know what the fuck to do.' It's a 
scary thing when you see the guys that ain't gonna get out, just ain't 
gonna get out. <br>
<br>
"But i guess it comes down to ...You just see too many faces, you just 
see too many.. I's a funny kind of thing. It's the kind of thing where 
you can't save everybody, but you gotta try." <br>
<br>
I remember the guy in New Orleans and how his herky-jerky movements and 
his near-weeping are less like death throes than like the throes of 
post-death, the confused, bizarre, parodistic behavior of a dead body 
responding to the last garbled signals of the brain. It seems a 
remarkable burden for Bruce Springsteen to have to "try" with this guy. 
But Bruce is radiant in the sense of his mission these days, reminding 
me of no one so much as Catcher In The Rye's Holden Caulfield, whose 
similar passion steered him straight to the nuthouse. <br>
<br>
Bruce has never read the book, so I tell him about the key scene where Holden tells his baby sister Phoebe. Says Holden: <br>
<br>
"You know what I'd like to be? I mean if I had my goddam choice?" <br>
<br>
"What? Stop Swearing." <br>
<br>
"You know that song, 'If a body catch a body comin' through the rye'? I'd like-" <br>
<br>
"It's 'If a body meet a body coming through the rye'!" old Phoebe said. "It's a poem by Robert Burns." <br>
<br>
"I know it's a poem by Robert Burns." <br>
<br>
She was right, thoug. It is "If a body meet a body coming through the rye. "I didn't know it then, though. <br>
<br>
"I thought it was 'If a body catch a body,' " I said. "Anyway, I keep 
picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of 
rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around - nobody big,
 I mean - except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. 
What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over 
the cliff - I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're 
going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd 
do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's 
crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be. I know it's 
crazy." <br>
<br>
"Wow," says Bruce when I finish telling him the story. "Thats" wild." <br>
<br>

<br>
Three years ago, Bruce Springsteen, a nice boy who loved rock 'n' roll 
more than anything, was dragged into the ugly and brutal fluorescence of
 American celebrity. For all his naivete (that same naivete that allowed
 him, for one thing, to love rock'n' roll so much when everybody else 
had given up and gotten a job), and perhaps because of it, he bore up 
under the relentless scrutiny, managing in the process to acquit himself
 remarkably well during his first big league rock'n' roll tour. In the 
meantime, his record company made hay from his new celebrity and hustled
 his Born To Run album to number one on the charts and eventually to 
platinum sales figures. And, so, three years ago a "superstar" was born;
 surely, the poet must die. <br>
<br>
Darkness On The Edge Of Town took eleven months to record. Legal 
disputes of the kind that tend to accrue to anyone who is suddenly rich 
and famous occupies the remainder of his over two year layoff. But what 
appears to have really happened during this period is that Bruce 
Springsteen stood back, took stock of his world both in and, more 
importantly, out of rock 'n' roll, and focused back on his career with a
 newly keen and powerful vision, becoming more the artist than ever. 
This talent no longer overwhelms him on Darkness but is harnessed fully 
to a coherent, usually incisive, and definitely more mature view of the 
world. "This album's stripped down," Sprngsteen says, "to run as clean 
as possible and stay true." <br>
<br>
Paradoxically while it is stripped down, it is also more complete. Where
 there was once only hope, now there is also warning. Where he once 
dealt only with youthfulness and "kids," he now also deals with age 
("Racing In The Street") and parents ("Factory," "Adam Raised A Cain"). 
Where everything used to be about movement, the faster the better, now 
there is a concern with standing still and stiller ("Factory," "Streets 
Of Fire"). Where a sense of community was all-important, with Spanish 
Johnny and the Magic Rat and Puerto Rican Jane and Eddie and a whole 
host of people crisscrossing one another's lives, now a man stands alone
 on a hill, having lost everything and everyone, in "Darkness On The 
Edge Of Town." Where he once put certain things into occasionally 
inadequate words, now he knows to wail wordlessly. Not that Bruce has 
forsaken the highway, the kids, the gang, the words, or any of that, 
just that on this new album these concerns have unfolded to reveal their
 many facets, their true intricacies and subtleties. "Darkness," says 
Springsteen, "is a confrontation with a lot of things. Born To Run had a
 certain romantic feel. This is more realistic." <br>
<br>
But realistic is a misleading description. There's nothing cold and 
hardedged about Darkness. The realism here is more naturalism or social 
realism, realism with a purpose beyond the mere representational, 
something along the lines of what the WPA artist of the 30's employed to
 inspire the common man from his massive malaise. No doubt, there is a 
reformer, a helper at work on this record and one who seems especially 
driven to the task by deep spiritual connections. I ask Springssteen if 
he feels religious. <br>
<br>
"Yeah, well, but no in the organized way," he responds. "I was raised 
Catholic and everybody who was raised Catholic hates religion. They hate
 it, can't stand it. It's funny, I went to a funeral the other day and 
all my relatives were there and we go to talking about it. It's a funny 
thing, they're all in their thirties, my sister and all, and they all 
feel the same way I do. But their kids go to Catholic scholl and to 
church every Sunday. They're really under the gun to this Catholic 
thing. <br>
<br>
"I quit that stuff when I was in eighth grade. By the time you're older 
than 13 it's too ludicrous to go along with anymore. By the time I was 
in eighth grade I just lost it all. I decided to go to public high 
school, and that was a big deal. If you got up in eighth grade class and
 said that next year you were going to Freehold Regional it was like... 
'Are you insane??? You are dirt! You are the worst! You're a... 
barbarian!'" He gives a short laugh. <br>
<br>
I tell him that what I wanted to get at is where the idea for a song like "Adam Raised A Cain" came from. <br>
<br>
Springsteen explains: "I did read the Bible some. I tried to read it for
 a while about a year ago. It's fascinating. I got into it quite a ways.
 Great stories. Actually, what happened was I was thinking of writing 
that particular song, and I went back trying to get a feeling for it." <br>
<br>
Elsewhere Bruce has mentioned The Grapes Of Wrath (speaking of social 
realism and religious allegory) as having been a source of inspiration 
for Darkness. He readily volunteers that the movie was "one of the big 
influences," but waxes a bit guilty when asked about the book. "I 
haven't read it yet," he says, adding quickly, "but I've got it in my 
suitcase. I have got it. <br>
<br>
"The movie affected me a lot. It brought up a lot of questions I didn't 
think about before. There's the great part where he's coming back from 
prison and he finds that little guy hiding in the closet. Little guy 
says, 'They're coming.' 'Well, who's coming?' 'They're coming. Taking 
away all the land.' And then the guy comes on the tractor and it's their
 friend. They ask him, 'Who's doing this?' And the tractor guy just 
says, 'Well, I got my orders from this guy and it goes back to him.' <br>
<br>
"To me, it's like, Where do you point the gun? There's no place to take 
aim. There's nobody to blame. It's just things, just the way. Whose 
fault is it? It's a little bit of this guy, a little bit of that guy, a 
little bit of this other guy. That was real interesting to me... And it 
was great that when that movie came out it was a very popular movie." As
 I write, Darknesss is an immensely popular record. <br>
<br>
Darkness On The Edge Of Town is not a tour de force like Born To Run. 
That could never be because the things on Darkness and in Bruce 
Springsteen have become too complex, too ambiguous. The album is a 
transitional piece, in two ways. It is transitional as far as content in
 that it is a questioning of the old values and a broadening towards the
 new; it is transitional as far as Springsteen's career goes because it 
marks a full ripening of his artistic powers and the emergence as well 
of a serious social conscience. <br>
<br>
Bruce is telling me why he likes touring. "Home never had a big 
attraction for me. I get excited staying in all these different hotels, 
in a whole lot of rooms. I'm always curious what the wallpaper's gonna 
be like. Do I have a big bed or a little one? And what's this funny 
painting? Always a sense of transition. "Darkness is a transitional 
record because Springsteen is devoted to the transition that is living. <br>
<br>
*** <br>
<br>
I was on the road three days and nights with Bruce Springsteen and the E
 Street Band, and that's about as good a time stand in which to hold a 
resurrection as I can think of. The problem is I don't know who exactly 
was more resurrected, Bruce and the band or me. Soutside Johnny once 
spoke glowingly of Bruce in terms of "charisma." But charisma has the 
odor of the secular. After what I saw, heard , and felt, I'm looking for
 a word that's something more in the religious price range. And maybe 
three confirmed miracles. <br>
<br>
No sweat. It's 100 degrees in Houston in July. The death toll from the 
Texas heat has topped 20 persons and is still rising and Bruce 
Springsteen is not sweating at the intermission of his titanic 
three-hour show. Now, some among our rock stars would approach such an 
accomplishment from the obvious direction - e.g. no effort, no sweat. 
But not Springsteen. "I'm jumping around and there's oceans of sweat 
coming off arms and face and all of a sudden... no more sweat! I feel my
 face, bone dry. I gues I just got no more. Weird." <br>
<br>
And then he went out for another hour and a half. <br>
<br>
Having not seen Springsteen and the band perform for nearly two years, 
what initially strikes me my first night on the road - besides the fact 
that the new songs sound great, besides the fact that he does superior 
versions of both "Fire" and "Because The Night," besides the fact that 
the band is as tight and expressive a rock'n' roll unit as I've ever 
seen, besides the fact that Clarence has achieved such elegance, such 
authority on stage and on the sax that he more than fills his billing as
 "King of the World," besides all that and much, much more - is simply 
the fact that the set is so gruelling and the tour is so long. No sweat,
 no wonder. <br>
<br>
In Houston, it occurs to me that Springsteen's rap in the middle of 
"Growin Up" is sort of the glue that binds them. He talks about the days
 when he and Steve were playing around Asbury, waiting to be discovered,
 how they can't figure out what the missing X factor is and how the 
ex-manager of the Byrds and the ex-manager of so and so have all said 
they'll come down and see them and so forth. Eventually, Bruce winds it 
around to Clarence descending from a spaceship to make the band 
complete. Space travel aside, it's clear that this is pretty much the 
way it was with this band (indeed, what band didn't count on the helping
 hand of the friend of a friend of an ex-manager sometime?), and that 
reciting the story, remembering their humble beginnings, their shared 
past, provides a sense of - if you'll pardon me - roots. That, along 
with love. <br>
<br>
As if to confirm my theory, Bruce later tells me another story about the
 early days when they first travelled to Boston and were staying in the 
attic of a friend's house where there were only four mattresses. "So 
every night after the gig we had to try and figure out whose turn it was
 to sleep on the floor." He laughs. "But it really didn't matter. The 
guys were great. They're guys who you can go through that sort of stuff 
with. It was never a down. Me and Steve would always sit back and say, 
'As bad as this is right now, it will never be as bad as it was before 
we made an album or got a break.' Who are we to complain? This is Easy 
Street. I'm lucky number one. So are all those guys. A bunch of lucky 
jokers. It's a lot of work, but you're doing something you like. We 
always considered ourselves to be way in front with the whole ball game.
 <br>
<br>
"I know what it's like not to be able to do what you want to do, 'cause 
when I go home that's what I see. It's no fun. It's no joke. I see my 
sister and her husband. They're living the lives of my parents in a 
certain kind of way. They got kids, they're working hard. They're just 
real nice, real soulful people. These are people you can see something 
in their eyes. It's really something. I know a lot of people back 
there..." The picture looms vived in his mind, so does what can only be 
described as his mission. "That's why my album, a big part of it, is the
 way it is. It's about people that are living the lives of their 
parents, working two jobs... It's also about a certain thing where they 
don't give up. I asked my sister, 'What do you do for fun?' 'I don't 
have any fun,' she says. She wasn't kidding... I'm just really thinking 
about a whole lot of things." <br>
<br>
He thinks at this hands for a moment. "A whole lot of stuff went down on
 me in the last year or two and then I was around home a lot and there 
was a lot of stuff going on with the people I was friends with back 
there, and I see it from all sides. Which is why I can't go out on stage
 at night and not try and bring it home. Because... what an ingrate??? 
What a spit in the face of everything that is anything??? I could never 
do that. I'd rather get thrown off the bus. They should throw me off the
 bus at 60 m.p.h. 'You don't belong in the bus!' It's funny when I read 
something I say about this stuff. I always sound like some kind af 
fanatic, some kind of zealot. But I think there's things that people 
take for granted. How can you take it for granted? I stick too close to 
the other side to know what's real about this side. And I still got too 
many people who are close to me who are still living on that other 
side." <br>
<br>
The Bruce Springsteen tour rolls on into New Orleans in a sort of time 
warp trip from Houston, a forbidding city of the future, into this 
forbidden city of the past. "Who you got in here?" the cop who lolls 
about the lobby of our French Quarter hotel asks the desk clerk watching
 the unusual activity. "Bruce 'Springsteen,' "drawls the clerk, adding 
in his mind no doubt, "You know, that Jewish fellow from up north." 
Bruce Springsteen? That's right, or at least that's how they've got him 
on the guest manifest. <br>
<br>
Music. It's everywhere. If anyplace, American music was born here, right
 down the block from the hotel at what is now called Jackson Square and 
what was once called Congo Square because that's where all the blacks 
and their music were auctioned into slavery. Musicians. There's probably
 more per square foot in New Orleans than anyplace in the world. (Just 
ask the white man at the biggest oldies shop.) Always a horn blowing 
somewhere in the heat. It's not quite the 20th Century here. It's not 
quite reality. Maybe it's the movies, but it's not faked. around the 
corner the Good Friends Bar has amended its factory-printed sign with 
some hand- lettering: "Under new management - Same old customers." No 
future, only past in New Orleans. In the middle of Bourbon Street, a 
scrawny black kid dances a little circle, metal taps taped onto his 
raggedy sneakers. I take that back: No future, only New Orleans here. An
 existence outside of time. <br>
<br>
He's a teetotalling Yankee, whose songs these days have more in common 
with the rural West than the South. But when he talks about rock'n' roll
 as if it were some spirit creature that takes possession of a man, or, 
indeed, when he is playing on a stage like a man possessed, it is clear 
that he belongs in New Orleans, this musician/poet/Catholic/fallen-away 
Catholic/ religious seeker/relegious person (?)/exhortator/mad dancer 
and raspy-voiced shaman Bruce Springsteen along with his E Street tent 
show. Does he even know where he is? It's hard to tell. But of the three
 shows I saw this tour, this one is the best. <br>
<br>
Halleujah! The bibical wailing of "Adam Raised A Cain" becomes a voodoo 
chant here. The fever and "The Fever," a song he has added in Houston, 
burn white-hot, turning the soaking air to steam. The jungle drums and 
jungle sound effects of "Not Fade Away"/"She's The One" bounce off 
Jackson Square and echo back to the coastline of Africa. Like the 
spontaneous Dixieland parades that can spil down Bourbon Street at a 
moment' notice, Bruce and Clarence spil off the stage and up the aisles 
into the reaching and exultant crowd, a rock 'n' roll parade. Then 
there's "The Rap." <br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen as usual steps out in the middle of "Growin' Up" to 
talk. In Houston, he told a sci-fi/horror movie story about things that 
aren't really spooky; tonight, he invokes the real thing, and it goes 
something like this: <br>
<br>
"When I was a boy there were two things in my house that my parents 
didn't like. One was me. The other was the guitar. 'That goddam guitar!'
 my father used to say. I think he thought all the things in my room 
were made by the same company, 'That Goddamn guitar. The Goddamn stereo.
 Those Goddamn records...' Anyway, one day my parents called me 
downstairs for a talk. And they sit me down at the kitchen table with 
'em and they start telling me it's about time I start getting serious 
with my life. 'And don't tell me about that goddamn guitar!' my father 
says. See, my father wants me to be a lawyer and my mother wants me to 
be an author. 'Be a lawyer,' my father tells me, 'then you'll be all 
set. Lawyers own the world!' Now, my mother's Italian and my father's 
Irish - and I'm stuck here in the middle - so they decide I should go 
around the corner and have a talk with the priest about my life. 'And 
don't say anything about the goddamn guitar!' <br>
<br>
"Okay, I go around the corner and I walk up the steps to the rectory and
 I ring the bell and after a while the priest comes out. "I'm Mr. 
Springsteen's son,' I say to the priest, 'and he told me I should come 
over to you and have a serious talk what I'm gonna do with my life. 'The
 priest, he thinks for a minute, and then says to me, 'Have you tried 
praying, my son? I think you should speak to God about this.' <br>
<br>
"So I go home and I'm thinking about how I've got to speak to God and 
how to find him and then I call up the Big Man, Clarence, 'cause he 
knows everybody. I say, 'listen, I got to talk to God about my life. You
 know where I can find him?' 'Sure,' he said to me, 'I spoke to him last
 night. He'll be up on the hill by the cemetery tonight.' Great. <br>
<br>
"That night I go over to the hill by the cemetery and it's real dark and
 I'm climbin' the hill and climbin' until I'm almost at the top and I 
stop and I'm lookin' all around. Then I look up at the sky and I say, 
'God?'" <br>
<br>
Perfectly timed, right on the mark, out of the cavernous rapture of the 
audience a New Orleans kid yells in response: "What?" And Springsteen 
cracks up. Still laughing, he tosses back, "God's in the cheap seats 
tonight. ...Listen, God, if I'd've know I could've at least gotten ya a 
backstage pass or something." The crowd whoops. The shaman is back in 
control. <br>
<br>
Springsteen says, "'God? You there?'" At which point, Danny Federici 
hits an eerie, piercing electronic note that ricochets around his 
speakers like a bolt from heaven. Springsteen crouches in the spotlight 
in awe and in alarm. "'God, ya gotta help me. My mother wants me to be 
an auther, and my father wants me to be a lawyer and they told me to go 
to the priest and he told me to come to you and all I want to do'" - he 
pauses reverentially - "'is play my guitar...!" He pauses again. The 
music swells slightly but otherwise, there's complete silence. The 
audience sits breathless, waiting to see: Can this Yankee rock'n' roller
 conjure too? Springsteen resumes in a harsh, rushed whisper. "All of a 
sudden, there's this light in the sky above me and a great big voice 
booms out and says..." Beat. The music drops down. "'Let it rock!'" And 
the band hits it, Springsteen singing, "I stood stone-like at 
midnight..." The audience is on their feet cheering. It works! <br>
<br>
After the show a group of European journalists is ushered backstage for 
an informal press conference with Bruce. While the rest of the band 
members casually make their way to the postconcert party on the other 
side of town. Springsteen, who is as uplifting and inspiring a performer
 as there is, becomes almost vehement denying an English reporter's 
suggestion that rock'n' roll is about nihilism. Two days later I remind 
Bruce of the exchange. He makes a small boxlike gestures with his hands 
to try and contain this belief he feels is too big to contain. <br>
<br>
"Sometimes people ask," he tells me, "who are your favorites? My 
favorites change. Sometimes it's Elvis. Sometime it's Buddy Holly. 
Different personalities. For me, the idea of rock'n' roll is sort of my 
favorite. The felling. It's a certain thing... Like; rock'n' roll came 
to my house" - again, rock'n' roll becomes palpable, become flesh - 
"where there seemed to be no way out. It just seemed like a dead end 
street, nothing I like to do, nothing I wanted to do except roll over 
and go to sleep or something. And it came into my house - snuck in ya 
know, and opened up a whole world of possibilities. Rock'n' roll. The 
Beatles opened doors. Ideally, if any stuff I do could ever do that for 
somebody, that's the best. Can't do anything better than that. Rock'n' 
roll motivates. It's the big gigantic motivator, at least it was for me.
 <br>
<br>
"There's a whole lot of things involved, but that's what I think you 
gotta remain true to. That idea, that feling. That's the real spirit of 
the music. You have to give to the audience and try to click that little
 trigger, that little mechanism. It's different things to different 
people. I got in a cab with a guy down South, and we're riding around 
then he says, 'Hey, you know what I like about your shows is I go see a 
concert and I'm fixed all day for the next day, and when I go to your 
shows I fell good for a week.' " Springsteen wheezes a laugh. "This is 
what it is. I thought that was a good review." <br>
<br>
Another good review: During the show that night in New Orleans, a 
primitively fortyish woman leans over the edge of the stage and hands 
Bruce a tiny object. At the end of the song, I see him lean back down to
 her, trying to return the gift, but she won't budge. Finally, there is 
nothing he can do but pocket the gift and get on with the show. "It was a
 ring. And I looked at it, and it looked like a real thing, you know, 
with stones in it. So I tell her - I can't keep this. And she tells me 
it was her grandmother's engagement ring, and she wants me to have it! 
That's gonna make me keep it? Maybe if she'd told me she'd told me she'd
 just bought it at Woolworth's for 39 cents... but her grandmother's 
engagement ring??? Wow, what's that?" <br>
<br>
That, I tell him, must be True Love. He leaves the ring with the hall 
manager with the instructions to return it to the lady should she come 
around looking, having had a change of heart. That is caring. <br>
<br>
Bruce heads back to the hotel after the press conference, and I'm over 
at the party at Acy's Pool Hal &amp; Restaurant on Sophie Wright Place. 
Situated in a poor black and white neighborhood outside the French 
Quater, Acy's is a windowless cement floor dump where the only light is 
from the abrasive fluorescent lamps swinging over the six fully occupied
 pool tables. Something right out of the movie Fat City (there is in 
fact a city outside of New Orleans called Fat City). <br>
<br>
By the time I arrived, the crew and band had decimated the Dixie beer, 
leaving only Miller and Pabst Blue Ribbon, and Ernie K. Doe and his 
pick-up band playing off in the corner have decimated the band and crew.
 Ernie K. Doe had his one and only hit record with "Mother-In- Law" in 
the early 60's and until an intrepid advance scout from Springsteen 
party unearthed him, had been living in relative obscurity like so many 
other greats of his era in New Orleans. As I walk in, Ernie K. Doe, 
dapper in a beige multivented suit over a dark open-neck silk shirt, 
every hair carefully pomaded into place, has run out of words to the 
song. But he doesn't want the folks to stop dancing, and is repeating 
"Well, all right" endlessly over the solid locomotive beat. When after a
 good five minutes Ernie K. Doe has run out of "Well, all right"'s , he 
brings the music down and introduces the band - but not by name. "Let's 
have a hand for the man on the bass!" he shouts, and there's a round of 
applause. "Let's have a hand for the man on the drums!" and so on, until
 he gets to Clarence Clemons, who is sitting in discreetly with his sax.
 I wonder. For all Ernie K. Doe knows, Clarence is just another guy who 
sauntered in off the street. Like I say, music is at least second nature
 to New Orleans. I listen carefully to his introductions. Without 
missing a beat, with not the slightest emphasis, Ernie K. Doe calls out,
 "Let's have a hand for the man on the tenor sax!" The locomotive beat 
continues. Ernie K. Doe falls silent (these party gigs get tired after a
 while) and then while the steady semi-drunk dance floor continues to 
bop, Ernie K. Doe goes through the introductions (one more time!) for 
want of somthing better. "Let's have another hand..." Clarence Clemons 
plays on discreetly, diligently, strictly "the man on the tenor sax" 
playing for the love of rock'n' roll. <br>
<br>
As much as you can take any of the Confederacy at face value (you can't 
really), you can say that Jackson, Mississippi looks like a simple, 
sleepy town, and that it is. After a day off in New Orleans, the 
Springsteen/E Street juggernaut is off to Jackson, a couple hundred 
miles up the Delta. The auditorium there is probably the newest and 
largest structure in town, and two different times, as I'm standing in 
front of it, cars full of kids pull up to ask where they can find it. I 
tell them and assume they do, because the hall in Jackson is full later.
 <br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen says that playing new halls like this makes him 
nervous. He much prefers a place that's been "broken into rock'n' roll."
 I understand his point. The crowd here is relatively subdued, almost 
indifferent to the carpeting and new chandeliers. But belying his 
statement, the show is about as loose as Bruce and the band get. <br>
<br>
"Let's get some lights on ya. I got a pimple on my face and you probably
 look better than I do," Springsteen say to the crowd at one point in 
the show. By intermission, of course, caution has been cast to the wind 
and everyone's clapping and bopping, and crowding the front of the stage
 as much as the older security guards will allow. <br>
<br>
One underfed blond boy is particularly excited. Oblivious to the 
exhortations of the guards, he is dancing wildly at the edge of the 
stage, eyes riveted on his favorite rock'n' roller. At one point, 
between songs, he tosses a Bruce Springsteen belt buckle onstage, a 
present. Bruce picks it up, admires it, thanks the boy, and without 
thinking asks jokingly, "So where's the belt?" Need I say more? In a 
second, the fan has ripped off his belt and tosses it up, too. Next 
comes his shirt. The guards make their move. "I had my eyes closed to 
sing a verse," says Bruce, "and the next time I looked, the kid's shirt 
is on the stage. I'm looking around for his pants, when I see the guard 
grab him." <br>
<br>
There is a slight scuffle (slight compared to the heavy head-busting 
tactics of most of the sadisto New York security goons), and the boy 
disappears into the crowd. Bruce tramps the edge of the stage looking 
for the boy; implicit in his warning to the guard to cool it. Then he 
runs back to Miami Steve who relays the message to one of the road crew.
 "'Find him. Find the kid,' is what I said," says Bruce. "'Cause I don't
 want him going out.' What happens is that a lot of the security in a 
lot of places don't understand. Kids get real excited, but they're not 
mean; they're just excited. I always watch out. Like in San Diego, I had
 to jump down and get this kid out. One of the security guards had the 
kid by the head. I'd seen the kid at a couple of shows and I'd talked to
 him outside. This kid's not looking for trouble. What happens is the 
kids have a reaction to security, which is if the security guard grabs 
'em, they think they're gonna get thrown out and they try to get away. 
People just don't wanna get thrown out of the show. Anyway, this kid in 
San Diego's real excited. He runs up to the stage. They grab him and try
 to pull him back and he tries to get away. So I went down and I pulled 
the kid away and the security guards are trying not to let go 'cause 
they're afraid he's gonna do something. Finally, we sent him up onstage 
and let him sit on the side. You gotta watch. You gotta do that. I can't
 watch kids getting knocked down in the front row because that's me. 
That's a part of me." <br>
<br>
Did someone say something about a fisher of men? <br>
<br>
Maybe the times are too complicated for miracles. Maybe, as Springsteen 
says, "The enemy's complicated, much more subtle now." Maybe it's just 
hard to be a saint in America. Too much dirt. Too many faces. <br>
<br>
The underfed blond kid without his shirt has brought one more present to
 the backstage entrance after the show where he's waited an hour a half 
for Springsteen to make his customary appearance (I have detained Bruce 
with this interview). Springsteen picks the kid out of the small crowd 
around the door, asks him how he is, laughs and then carefully 
autographs the boy's pro-offered frisbee. "Thanks!" the kid says 
feverishly. "Thanks for comin'!" says Springsteen. <br>
<br>
As Bruce turns his attention to other fans, the hungry boy looks at his 
back with intense hungry eyes, hesitates for a second, his jaw hanging 
open, his tongue secretly wrapping itself around a pronunciation he 
wants to get right. Then as the crowd flows between the boy and his 
idol, the boy decides to do it and then blurts at Bruce's back. It's a 
word he's been working on for days, weeks, maybe months or years: it's 
his last and dearest gift to this Yankee guy who means so much to him. 
"Shalom!" he shouts. That his final, extra special gift goes unheard in 
the hubbub doesn't matter. The boy dashes off, happy to be saved again 
(at least for the week), happier that he has tried something for Bruce 
Springsteen. <br>
<br>
*** <br>
<br>
"Where you all from?" <br>
<br>
"New York City," my companion and I respond. <br>
<br>
"I was producing shows at the Fox and then Alan came up and was 
producing shows at the Fox and Paramount, too. We were both doing shows,
 but you might say I created New York City!!!" The white man in the 
oldies shop goes on and on. We're not allowed to leave. <br>
<br>
"And that Hank Williams story, that movie, ya know [Your Cheating Heart,
 1956]. There he is lying in the back of the car all dead on booze and 
pills and where was he headed for? Canton, Ohio! Did you read that? Did 
you see that in the movie? There I am backstage, cussing him all up and 
down, saying that when I get my hands on that son-of-a-bitch I'm gonna 
tear him limb from limb. I'm out 750 bucks! I was producin' a Hank 
Williams show that night and I'm out 750 bucks! 750 bucks I don't have! 
Wouldn't that've made a much better ending for that movie? Me standing 
backstage pulling out my hair and cussing him out 'cause I'm out 750 
bucks! Did you ever hear about that? <br>
<br>
"Huey Smith, the same Huey 'Piano' Smith right here on this record. 
(He's a preacher now. Don't make no money. Nooo! Huey 'Piano' Smith mows
 lawns for two bucks an hour!) So Huey says to me he just wants to make 
enough money so he can sue that produer of his. I say, 'You got it all 
wrong, Huey. That's not the way to approach it.' I say, 'Huey, I got an 
idea. You and me are gonna put on a show with all the old New Orleans 
people and were gonna do it right over there in that Superdome! And then
 you know what? Huey? We are gonna laugh all the way to the bank!'" <br>
<br>
But he isn't laughing. And as we edge out the door he's talking again. 
Half a block away as we round the corner, I'm sure he's talking still. 
Weeks later, I'm sure he's still talking and almost weeping. I'm sure 
that somewhere in the murky city of New Orleans a white man is detaining
 rock'n' roll fans with his past. And somewhere out in the heartland, 
Bruce Springsteen is digging after him.</div>

Globe &amp; Mail , <br>
<br>
March 28, 1992<br>
By Chris Dafoe<br>
<br>
Maybe it's a good thing Bruce Springsteen chose to break four years of 
silence with not one but two new albums. One of them might possibly be 
his worst record yet. <br>
<br>
It's been more than four years since Bruce Springsteen last released a 
record, a long enough time that some people - including Sony, the new 
owner of his record label, Columbia - must have wondered if he was ever 
going to record again. Springsteen has answered with not one but two new
 records. HT and LT were both released to radio yesterday and will be in
 stores Tuesday. <br>
<br>
The dual release might prompt skeptics to suggest that Saint Bruce is 
getting greedy - he'd likely make more money selling two single CDs than
 one double - and industry insiders suggest that he's getting ready to 
leave Columbia for a new label. The official explanation, however is 
that Springsteen having completed one record, started writing songs that
 took him off in a different musical direction and that he felt the 
songs belonged on separate records. <br>
<br>
After one spin of the two records - press, radio and retail were given a
 preview on Wednesday {March 25} - that explanation sounds plausible 
enough. These are two very different records, both in musical style and 
lyrical tone. <br>
<br>
Listening to HT, it's tempting to imagine Springsteen sitting up late at
 night - Patti and the kids are in bed - playing old records and feeling
 sorry for himself. He's getting old, his hairline's receeding, he's 
married - he'd always said he didn't want to make married music - now 
he's got kids. Sure he's worth millions and, hey, double the abdominal 
crunches and he'll be beefcake material in time for the first video, but
 he's still got a load of guilt over the break-up of his first marriage 
and the tabs are on his case and the record company is bugging him about
 a new record. So he sits around playing old Coasters and Gene Pitney 
and Screamin Jay Hawkins and Roy Orbison records and wallowing in his 
midlife crisis. <br>
<br>
I'll allow that Human Touch may improve with repeated listenings - it's 
hard to judge any record on just one play - but, based on first 
impressions this may be Springsteen's worst record yet. Lyrically, it 
seems to follow in the footsteps of 1987's ToL, which foreshadowed his 
split with his first wife, actress Julianne Phillips, Tunnel was 
Springsteen at his most confessional, a grim but bracing letter from an 
unhappy marriage, full of stories of mistrust, adultery and fear. <br>
<br>
Those stories seem to be continued on HT, spiced with a little 
old-fashioned guilt and gratuitous self-loathing. Springsteen tries to 
put a brave on things with a few upbeat rock songs like Gloria's Eyes, 
which rides along on a killer guitar riff, and with the humour of such 
songs as 57 Channels, in which the singer shoots his TV in frustration. 
The spirit of the record however, seems best captured in such lines as 
"Built a roadside carnival out of hurt and self pity" (from Real World) 
and Chippin' away at this chain of my own lies" (from Long Goodbye). 
This is not a happy Bruce. <br>
<br>
Musically, Springsteen has turned here from the country tinged rock of 
ToL - an appropriate choice for a record so concerned with marriage ? to
 a sort of glossy updating of those classic rock and roll records of the
 50s and 60s. Soul Driver, with its talk of a rain of "snakes, frogs and
 a love in vain" draws on voodoo southern R &amp; B. 57 Channels and 
Cross My Heart could have been written by Leiber and Stoller. And I Wish
 I Were Blind, one of the better songs on the record, sounds like 
something Orbison might have recorded in one of his more extravagantly 
morose moments. <br>
<br>
But, for all the attempts at humour and all the nods toward the purity 
of old rock &amp; roll, something here falls flat. Too often, 
Springsteen sounds self absorbed and cut off from reality; when he tries
 to play the populist, singing in Real Man about going to the movies and
 watching Rambo, it comes off as an empty pose. <br>
<br>
Having parted company with the E Street Band, Springsteen is working 
here with a group of studio pros - keyboard player Roy Bittan is the 
only holdover from the earlier days - and for most of the record they 
sound slick and stiff. The songwriting seems sloppy and confused and the
 album sounds like it was patched together. <br>
<br>
By comparison, Lucky Town is a delight, a stripped down solo outing full
 of grit, humour and life that finds Springsteen laughing both at his 
good fortune and his own self pity. He sets the tone on the first song, 
the upbeat Better Days, characterizing his situation in the lines "It's a
 sad funny ending to find yourself pretending/A rich man in a poor man's
 shirt". He goes on to sing hopefully of married life in the beautifully
 simple If I Should Fall Behind, and of other rewards of becoming a 
father in Living Proof. <br>
<br>
The album seems to draw on Springsteen's fold music roots, going so far 
as to offer a nod to Pete Seeger with The Big Muddy, a title borrowed 
from the song that TV network executives tried to stop Seeger from 
playing on The Smoothers Brothers Show during the Vietnam War. <br>
<br>
In contrast to the hemetic, self absorbed feeling of much of Human 
Touch, Lucky Town sounds as though Springsteen has ventured back into 
the real world and re-established the connection between his private and
 public life. On Souls Of The Departed, he sings of an American soldier 
on morgue detail in the Middle East and of a child killed in a gang war 
by way of explaining the fears he has for his own child. On Local Hero, 
he chuckles over the transitory nature of fame, remarking on a black 
velvet painting ? presumably of himself - lodged in the window of a five
 and dime. <br>
<br>
Yet while the themes and the lyrical tone of the record may at times 
recall Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan, the sound is pure rock and roll. 
Springsteen plays a buzzing, rolling electric guitar throughout, backed 
for the most part only by a rhythm section and a trio of backup 
vocalists. The record sounds rough and simple, like a collection of well
 polished demos, but there's fire and liveliness to it that reinforces 
the feeling of hopefullness and courage that runs through the songs. <br>
<br>
After hearing Human Touch for the first time, I wondered if Springsteen had lost it. Lucky Town makes it clear that he hasn't.</div>

Bruce Springsteen hits the road in search of The Ghost of Tom Joad<br>
Guitar World <br>
<br>
Acoustic 17, 1996<br>
By Gary Graff<br>
<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is trying to be a proper host. It's backstage at the 
spanking new Rosemont Theatre in suburban Chicago, and much to his 
chagrin Springsteen can't find a proper iced beverage for a guest. 
Perhaps the promotors figured that since this was a solo show, 
Springsteen wouldn't need a full array of rock and roll accoutrements. <br>
<br>
"Is there any beer or anything?" the performer asks as he looks around. 
"What... they didn't give us any beer? Well, you're welcome to some of 
that Jack Daniels," he says, pointing towards a mostly empty bottle on 
the counter. <br>
<br>
He may not have much to offer in the way of refreshments, but 
Springsteen's spirits are high as he entertains a steady stream of 
visitors. There are writers from out of town. Reps from his British 
record label. And Eric Dinyer, the Kansas City artist whose painting 
adorns the cover of Springsteen's new album, The Ghost of Tom Joad. <br>
<br>
Later on, filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich, a pal from Los Angeles, walks in 
with his daughter and a friend. They're in Chicago working on a sequel 
of To Sir With Love with Sidney Portier. <br>
<br>
"Whoa, big excitement!" Springsteen says, leaping up to greet them. "I can't believe you're here. Good Lord, this is a treat!" <br>
<br>
The backstage scenes of bonhomie are in marked contrast to what had 
transpired before an audience of 4,000 earlier in the evening. There, 
Springsteen - accompanying himself with just a guitar and harmonicas - 
presented a bare-boned, two-hour show that showcased the somber material
 from Tom Joad along with similarly bleak material from his other 
albums, including revamped versions of " Adam Raised A Cain," "Darkness 
on the Edge of Town," "Nebraska" and "Born in the U.S.A.," the last 
number presented in a harrowing, bluesy arrangement. <br>
<br>
The concert was a different creature from the buoyant, take-no-prisoners
 spectacles that established Springsteen's reputation as one of rock's 
best live performers. Taken together, the acoustic songs comprised a 
morality piece in which Springsteen examined the lives of migrants, 
drifters, criminals and just plain Joes hitting a wall of desperation in
 their quest for an American Dream. Like the new album, the show was 
stark and frequently gloomy; where just a few years ago Springsteen sang
 a praise of "Glory Days," past and present, he now murmurs, "Welcome to
 the new world order... No home, no job, no peace, no rest." <br>
<br>
At the Chicago show, the dark subject matter didn't stop the ritual 
bellows of "Broooooce!" in between songs, but Springsteen wouldn't have 
any of that; at the beginning of the set, the charismatic performer 
actually asked his fans not to sing along or cheer him on. "If you do," 
he cracked, "you'll be arrested by the state police." <br>
<br>
"This music means a lot to me," he told them at the evening's end. And 
back in his dressing room - with a Ry Cooder moviesoundtrack playing 
softly on a boom box - Springsteen leans back on a couch, clasps his 
hands behind his head, and explains why. <br>
<br>
"It's different from anything I've done before," he says. "Ii's 
different than playing a few acoustic songs during the show. It's 
different than what I did during the early Seventies, when I was playing
 and it was just me. I don't know what kind of show we have. It's not 
quite a folk show; it's something else. <br>
<br>
"It has a lot to do with cinema, maybe. It's just some different thing; I
 didn't know myself how diffferent it was until I did it in front of an 
audience." <br>
<br>
As Springsteen notes, playing the acoustic troubadour is hardly a new 
role for him - although the image of him clutching his woodgrain Fender 
Esquire is pretty indelible. But before Time and Newsweek crowned him 
rock's great white hope, before his future manager Jon Landau dubbed him
 rock and roll's future, Springsteen was in fact a denizen of Greenwich 
Village, the latest Next Dylan discovered by John Hammond for Columbia 
Records. <br>
<br>
That side of him surfaced periodically in the course of his career. 
There was, of course, Nebraska, the brooding 1982 acoustic album that 
shocked most fans in the wake of his Top 40 triumph with the ebullient 
"Hungry Heart." Springsteen has also played acoustically at Neil Young's
 Bridge Concerts, and at the Christic Institut benefit in 1990. <br>
<br>
"That was fun," says Springsteen of the benefit. "It was kind of like 
this, but half of that was kind of 'Thunder Road,' some other things. 
Right from the top I decided that I didn't want any of those things. It 
wasn't going to be 'Bruce Unplugged.' I knew I had to do something 
different, because I hadn't done it many times in the recent past." <br>
<br>
The greatest surprise of Springsteen's new acoustic voyage was probably 
its timing. He began 1995 by snaring an armful of Grammys for his 
Oscar-winning hit, "Streets of Philadelphia." Then he brought out his 
Greatest Hits album with the really big surprise - fresh tracks that he 
had recorded with a reunited E Street Band. E Street mania dominated the
 year, right through the group's September appearance at the Concert for
 the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, playing its own set and backing Chuck 
Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis. Springsteen also dueted that evening with Bob
 Dylan on "Forever Young." <br>
<br>
But just as fans were about to start camping out for Springsteen and E 
Street Band concert tickets, he revealed his plans for The Ghost of Tom 
Joad. <br>
<br>
"I worked with the band. I had a record I did that was a personal type 
of record, and I didn't feel like I quite got it - it wasn't finished 
and it wasn't quite right," Springsteen says. "I think we were going to 
do 'The Ghost of Tom Joad' as a rock song for the band record. But as I 
got into it, all of a sudden, I began to - I had 'Straight Time,' 
'Highway 29' - get into that groove, kind of film noir. <br>
<br>
"So I started to write... and I said, 'That's the kind of record I think
 I want to make. I want to make a record where I don't have to play by 
the rules. I won't have any singles or any of that kind of stuff. I can 
make whatever kind of music I want to make. 'I hadn't done that in a 
real long time; I guess I wanted to see if I could do it again. You 
don't really choose the voice you follow; you sort of follow the voice 
that's in your head. You're lucky if you find it. And once you,ve found 
it, you're supposed to listen to it." <br>
<br>
The Ghost of Tom Joad is, in fact, a campfire album. The songs are dusty
 and sepia-toned; the only color is provided by harmonica and the 
occasional fiddle or pedal steel - and even those don't burst forward 
but rather rest quietly atop Springsteen's subdued acoustic 
accompaniment. Because it's a lyric-driven album, it's hardly a showcase
 for Springsteen's playing; mostly he favors subtle, almost offhand 
rhythmic picking that provides the songs with meter and only the most 
rudimentary musicialty. It's closer to "Mary, Queen of Arkansas," from 
Greetings from Asbury Park, than the aggressive strumming of Nebraska's 
"Johnny 99" or "Atlantic City." It's more Woody Guthrie than Hank 
Williams. <br>
<br>
"A lot of it was me and an acoustic guitar, then putting the keyboards 
on," explains Springsteen, who recorded enough songs to make Tom Joad a 
double album. "The other stuff was cut live. I didn't want much more 
than that. It's all rough mixes; there's no eq on any instruments or any
 of the voices. There's no master on anything. We played it, then 
rough-mixed it in literally about 30 minutes. It's a little unusual; we 
tried to do all the other things - we tried to mix it, tried to measter 
it - and every time we did something to it, it made it sound more like a
 record and less like a living thing.<br>
<br>
"We had kind of a variation of [Nebraska] going on. I guarantee you, 
[Tom Joad] will be the record released this year that has no eq and 
absolutely no master." <br>
<br>
Which serves the purpose of Tom Joad just fine. The album is about 
Springsteen's characters - the homeless, the chriminals, the migrants, 
the ex-cons, the unemployed, the drug-runners. All down and outers, 
they're hard people living hard lives - some by their own choices, some 
as victims of corporate or governmental neglect. Springsteen's hushed, 
folkie arrangements are essential for conveying their almost 
unrelentingly bleak circumstances. <br>
<br>
Across the Rosemont dressing room, Bogdanovich looks at Springsteen and 
says, "It seems like the idea of Tom Joad, that whole thing is somewhere
 in the air. You found it." <br>
<br>
"It is in the air; it's all of what's out there right now," replies 
Springsteen. The songs were inspired by John Ford's film of John 
Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath, which leads to a discussion of the 
movie. <br>
<br>
"It's such an unusual film," Bogdanovich says, "Very tough, very dark. It's such a dark film for a major studio." <br>
<br>
Springsteen nods in agreement. "That was something I always go back to, 
that movie," he says. "I looked at it again the other night; it's very 
tough. Incredible, really. I guess it was kind of unique for John Ford, 
too." <br>
<br>
The album has other influences, too, including a series of books and 
articles Springsteen lists in the liner notes. He's written an 
introduction for a new volume of one of the books, Journey to Nowhere: 
The Saga of the New Underclass, that inspired the Tom Joad songs 
"Youngstown" and "The New Timer." <br>
<br>
If Springsteen's guitar playing seems secondary on the album, it gains 
prominence during his solo shows, in which the songs are delivered with 
greater vigor. The easy lope of the title tracks is more pronounced, for
 instance. With no other misicians onstage, Springsteen ups the volume 
on "Straight Time" and "Youngstown" - just a notch, but enough to really
 hear the sturdy rhythmic drive that's present but harder to detect on 
the album. <br>
<br>
Of course, he goes to town on the older songs. "Darkness on the Edge of 
Town" is recast with a steady strum that recalls "Pinball Wizard." 
"Murder Incorporated" becomes more foreboding, with Springsteen's 
12-string ringing with long, loud overtones. "Spare Parts" is stark and 
bluesy, while "Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?" is animated and 
exuberant. For "Streets of Philadelphia" he replaces the synthesizer 
drone with a coiled, halting guitar pattern that's just this side of 
percussive. <br>
<br>
Then there's "Born in the U.S.A.," Springsteen's long-misunderstood 
anthem - "The songwriter always gets the last shot," he growls during 
the show - which he turns into a biting, vicious indictment with some 
stinging slide playing. After all, the blues can't be misunderstood. <br>
<br>
"Yeah, it's the blues. That's just what it is, Springsteen says with a 
smile. "The funny things is I cut the song for Nebraska originally; 
there's a version of it that's sort of like that, but didn't really work
 out. It was just electric guitar and voice. I'd like to hear it again 
now, see what I think of it. So this is kind of returning it a little 
bit to its roots, actually. <br>
<br>
"I knew I wanted to do a show that was probably an hour and a half long,
 no more than two hours. With just one person and one guitar, anything 
shorter than that might not have been a full experience and anything 
longer than that and you've done it already. I just sort of broaden the 
theme with the other things, the older things; it doesn't interrupt the 
thread of the evening or where it's going. They just sort of broaden it 
out, bring in something different. <br>
<br>
"These are versions I have of some of the older songs that feel closer 
to me... stripped down, completely what the songs are about. It's just 
very satisfying." <br>
<br>
The acoustic show, Springsteen says, was put together during a week's 
worth of rehearsals in a theater in Los Angeles. "Basically I went in 
and played, just played almost the set that's there," he says. "I 
figured I'd start with 'The Ghost of Tom Joad' and see where it takes 
me." It was important, he says, that the show have "at least a little 
love and affection... and some laughs." But he balks at any notion that 
the album or the show are without hope. <br>
<br>
"There's always something being revealed - something about them, 
something about you," he says. "Once you slip into somebody's story, 
you're having that experience. Once you get there, you're not sleeping 
at nights; you're up wondering, 'What's gonna happen to these guys? 
What's next? You put on someone else's clothes and it's just fun being 
them. <br>
<br>
"That's always exciting, even if the stuff is dark, even if there's 
tragedy involved, it's still exciting. The truth is always hopeful. It's
 always inspiring, no matter what it is. That's what I find, anyway." <br>
<br>
He's asked about his earlier concerts, reminded of a past remark that he
 always performed each show if it was his last. Is it the same thing 
when it's just him and an acoustic guitar? <br>
<br>
Springsteen answers only after careful deliberation. "Not like that, no.
 I don't feel like that, really. That was a whole crazy thing we used to
 do; everyone has that side to them: 'Hey, I might Die tomorrow!' <br>
<br>
"That's an interesting question, though. My sense now is that I'm 46 
years old; I Want to walk onstage and bring the fullness of my 
experience to my audience... I believe that's what the show delivers, 
just life, living. I want to take all that, all that I can, and do my 
best to present it to you. In that sense, the stakes are high... because
 I have a commitment to it."</div>

				<div class="content">Why the coolest bands in pop are bowing down before Bruce Springsteen<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen ruled rock in the Eighties, but since then his decline
 has been long and painful. So why, asks Shane Danielsen, are the 
world's coolest bands so keen to champion the Boss?<br>
<br>
The Independent , May 15, 2007 <br>
<br>
<br>
It seems little short of remarkable, in a season dominated by 
breathless, momentary hype about "nu-rave" acts like Klaxons, New Young 
Pony Club and Shitdisco, that the presiding spirit of the two finest 
rock albums of the past 12 months should be a grizzled American veteran,
 now approaching his seventh decade. But somehow, against every 
expectation, Bruce Springsteen has rarely seemed more relevant. <br>
<br>
It's a far cry from the days when Everything But The Girl felt obliged 
to defend their decision to include a Springsteen cover ("Tougher Than 
the Rest") on their 1992 Acoustic album. At the time, so closely was the
 singer associated with jingoistic, Reagan-era US (the result of "Born 
in the USA", a song about the dismal homecoming accorded a Vietnam 
veteran, being misread as a flag-waving nationalist anthem), that his 
stock slipped badly with all but his most loyal fans. His personal 
travails didn't help: in the mid-Eighties he first married and then 
divorced Julianne Phillips, relocated to Hollywood with new wife and 
former backing singer Patti Scialfa and drifted away from his longtime 
collaborators The E Street Band. He seemed restless and unfocused, and 
subsequent albums such as Tunnel of Love (1987) and Lucky Town (1992) 
struggled in vain to match the worldwide success of 1984's Born in the 
USA. <br>
<br>
Yet after more than a decade in the wilderness, there is a growing sense
 that this is once again Springsteen's time. Ten days ago, at New York's
 City's Carnegie Hall, he was the subject of a tribute concert - a 
fundraiser for the Music For Youth charity - following in the footsteps 
of previous honourees Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell. Twenty different 
artists, including Patti Smith, Badly Drawn Boy and M. Ward, covered his
 songs, and The Boss himself appeared to perform the encore, a rousing, 
ramshackle version of "Rosalita" for which the entire line-up - 
including The Hold Steady, one of the most acclaimed of new American 
bands - joined him on stage. <br>
<br>
For that group, in particular, it might have seemed like a benediction -
 or at the very least, a passing of the torch. (Singer-songwriter Craig 
Finn, according to the New York Times reviewer, "seemed about to 
burst.") A bar-band from Brooklyn by way of Minneapolis, The Hold Steady
 have been feted by US critics, and are distinguished by their ferocious
 live shows, their seeming disregard for cool, and by Finn's verbose, 
intensely descriptive lyrics, which recall with uncanny precision the 
early Springsteen - the Dylan-infatuated "street poet" of Greetings From
 Asbury Park, NJ (1973), who gave us the delirious wordplay of songs 
such as "Blinded by the Light" and "Lost in the Flood", before settling 
for the terser, more hard-bitten sentiments of Born to Run (1975). <br>
<br>
Finn is more grounded in quotidian reality - no talk of "raggamuffin 
gunners" or "go-cart Mozarts" here: he's more likely to describe 
teenagers "sucking off each other at the demonstration/making sure their
 makeup's straight" (from "Stuck Between Stations", the opening number 
on their most recent album, Boys and Girls in America). But his 
logorrhea, his delight in the possibilities of fitting narrative 
language to rock music, is identical. He's allusive (the same song 
invokes a Kerouac character in its first verse, and the suicide of poet 
John Berryman in its second), but never showy. And like early Bruce, he 
doesn't sing so much as speak his lyrics, in a gravelly drawl that 
manages, somehow, to ride across the dense wall of sound his band create
 around him.<br>
<br>
Indeed, it's this sonic grandeur that most directly invites Springsteen 
references. Listening to "Stuck Between Stations" is like hearing a 
bonus track from Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978): a stomping rocker 
in the vein of "Badlands" or "Candy's Room". The playing is muscular, 
all power chords and layered hooks, while both Tad Kubler's overdriven 
guitar work and Franz Nicolay's trebly, arpeggiated piano fills are 
undeniably inspired by the playing of their E Street Band antecedents, 
Steve Van Zandt and Roy Bittan, respectively. <br>
<br>
Likewise, The Arcade Fire, whose second album, The Neon Bible, looks 
certain to be one of the bellwether releases of 2007. Their sound is 
bigger than on their debut, 2005's Funeral, and their concerns more 
expansive; the inclinations to arena-rock previously hinted at are here 
nurtured and indulged. And with them, a deeper stylistic debt to 
Springsteen is made apparent. "Keep the Car Running" (an almost parodic 
Bruce title) borrows the beat from "I'm On Fire" and the melody from 
"I'm a Rocker"; in doing so, it practically replicates what Jody Rosen, 
writing in Slate and borrowing a line from "Born to Run", called "the 
hemi-powered drones" of classic Springsteen. Another track, "Antichrist 
Television Blues", sounds at first glance like the gripe of a typical 
blue-collar protagonist from Born in the USA or The River (1980) ("I 
don't wanna work in a building downtown") - but marries this discontent 
to a more specific, modern-day unease ("Cause the planes keep crashing, 
always two by two"). <br>
<br>
Why this mining of Springsteen's back-catalogue, this reiteration of his
 sound? And why now? Rosen makes the point that, after more than a 
decade on the commercial sidelines, overshadowed by hip-hop and shiny, 
digital pop, rock musicians are actively seeking to reclaim their place 
in the spotlight - and in the process, rediscovering the attractions of 
scale, grandeur and making a noise. <br>
<br>
In practice, these bands' sensibilities may differ: there's nothing 
remotely ironic about The Arcade Fire's music - on the contrary, their 
sincerity is what enables them to evade accusations of bombast - while 
The Hold Steady seem all too aware of, yet utterly besotted by, the 
broader clich?s of stadium rock. Nevertheless, both The Neon Bible and 
Boys and Girls in America work, both as stylistic homages and as 
artifacts in their own right. As such, they repudiate a great deal of 
conventional wisdom about the diminished state of contemporary popular 
music. <br>
<br>
It has in recent years become a dependable critical canard to suggest 
that rock music is, if not quite dead, then at least in its terminal 
stages - "circling the drain," as some unkind medical slang would have 
it. For a while, in the wake of Radiohead's OK Computer, it seemed that 
any rock music deserving of serious attention was obliged to reject the 
traditional consolations afforded listeners: few hooks (almost no 
melodies at all, in fact), little in the way of lyrical clarity, and 
certainly no liberating surge of major-chord uplift. How else to capture
 the spirit of this turbulent age? Rock 'n' roll was, at heart, a simple
 thing, and this very simplicity seemed to suggest that it had become 
exhausted, its possibilities used up. Meanwhile, songs that 10 years ago
 would have been considered "difficult", even avant garde, today own the
 charts. The mind-bending structural gymnastics of productions by 
Timbaland or the Neptunes are some of the most unexpected, sophisticated
 and flat-out glorious music of our time. But confronted with work as 
straightforwardly thrilling as the Arcade Fire and Hold Steady albums, 
big and bold and unashamedly inclusive in its reach, the temptation to 
punch the air is almost irresistible. <br>
<br>
Yet, more than simply rocking up a storm, Springsteen's own career has 
been marked by artistic experiments and detours. It's telling that, with
 or without the backing of his E Street Band, his own music has grown 
steadily more intimate and reflective. Even 2002's The Rising - 
conceived as a response to the events of 9/11, and hailed by many 
critics and fans as a return to the widescreen grandeur of his 
mid-Seventies work - today seems a much more contemplative, even sombre 
set: the work of an older, more ruminative man. <br>
<br>
The 1990s saw him become a father: he and Scialfa had three children in 
five years. While living in LA, he won an Oscar in 1994 for his 
contribution ("Streets of Philadelphia") to Jonathan Demme's film 
Philadelphia. But his work slipped: neither Lucky Town nor Human Touch 
(both 1992) satisfied long-time fans; nor did they win many new 
converts. And the appearance, in 1998, of a four-disc box set of 
out-takes and early performances - simply titled Tracks - had a 
distinctly valedictory air, the testament of a man whose hour had 
passed. <br>
<br>
But then 2005's largely acoustic Devils and Dust album saw a return to 
the dustbowl Americana of Nebraska (1982) and The Ghost of Tom Joad 
(1995), and the following year's We Shall Overcome looked back further 
still - this time to the source, the American protest tradition 
pioneered by folk singer Pete Seeger. It garnered glowing reviews and 
returned him to prominence, particularly in Europe. Beneath the 
recurring motifs - the girls and cars and girls in cars - Springsteen's 
abiding concerns are social, rather than strictly personal: his 
despairing sense of love for his homeland, and his keen awareness of its
 squandered potential. A liberal in the New Deal sense of the word, his 
patriotism is knotty and complicated, and the friction between his Walt 
Whitman-like dream of the US, and its disappointing reality, provides 
the basis for much of his finest work. As such, he might be rivalled 
only by the less famous Steve Earle, as the most politically relevant US
 songwriter today.<br>
<br>
In this sense, his legacy perhaps looms largest in Low, the other great 
American band of the moment, whose eight albums to date are some of the 
gentlest, yet most unsettling in modern American song. Like Cowboy 
Junkies, with whom they are sometimes (mistakenly) associated, the band 
seem influenced by the haunted silence of Springsteen's Nebraska album, 
its still, quiet air of paranoia and desolation. <br>
<br>
Tranquil, they might be (some might say tranquilised, so glacial is the 
pace of a typical Low track), but they are rarely pretty. On the 
contrary: theirs is a harsh, comfortless beauty, and after flirting with
 a heavier sound on their last album, 2005's The Great Destroyer, their 
new set, Drums and Guns, speaks directly to a nation mired in the Second
 Gulf War, disenchanted by the folly and culpability of its leaders. <br>
<br>
Cowboy Junkies, too, have a new album: titled At the End of Paths Taken,
 its dark, faintly despairing mood seems closely related to 
Springsteen's The Rising - from which comes "You're Missing", a song 
that they regularly cover live. Watching them play recently, they seemed
 at once angrier and more ambiguous than ever before; appropriately, 
they closed their set with a lonely, chilling version of "State Trooper"
 - a song about psychosis and desperation, written and originally 
recorded, back in 1982, by one Bruce Frederick Springsteen.</div>

Bruce Springsteen: Born to Run [Columbia, 1975]<br>
Just how much American myth can be crammed into one song, or a dozen, 
about asking your girl to come take a ride? A lot, but not as much as 
romanticists of the doomed outsider believe. Springsteen needs to learn 
that operettic pomposity insults the Ronettes and that pseudotragic 
beautiful-loser fatalism insults us all. And around now I'd better add 
that the man avoids these quibbles at his best and simply runs them over
 the rest of the time. If "She's the One" fails the memory of Phil 
Spector's innocent grandeur, well, the title cut is the fulfillment of 
everything "Be My Baby" was about and lots more. Springsteen may well 
turn out to be one of those rare self-conscious primitives who gets away
 with it. In closing, two comments from my friends the Marcuses. Jenny: 
"Who does he think he is, Howard Keel?" (That's a put-down.) Greil: 
"That is as good as `I Think We're Alone Now.'" (That's not.) A<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN<br>
Born to Run (30th Anniversary Edition)<br>
Columbia<br>
<br>
In his career-making third album, a Jersey contender turned an old Chevy into a Pink Cadillac and took an epic ride<br>
<br>
The biggest problem with Bruce Springsteen's 1975 breakthrough album was
 always how unabashedly it proclaimed its own greatness. The 
wall-of-sound, white-soul-at-the-opera-house Born to Run is definitely 
full of itself--its lead track emoted over five minutes of portentous 
piano, its title track laden with glockenspiel and guitar guitar guitar,
 its thematic burden an unresolved quest narrative, its groove as grand 
as a V-8 hearse. Newcomers may not get why its class-conscious songcraft
 provided a relief from the emptier pretensions of late-hippie 
arena-rock. Yet it sounds greater today than it ever did.<br>
<br>
By definition, the remastered thirtieth-anniversary edition of the album
 that put a cult artist from South Jersey on the cover of Time and 
Newsweek isn't shy about its greatness either. Greatness is what such 
packages hawk, so be grateful that this one has a right. Rather than 
"bonus tracks"--45-rpm mix of "Born to Run," anybody?--you get the 
original album and nothing but the original album. The remastering adds 
only presence, warmth and texture to the digitalization, which by lax 
early-Columbia standards wasn't bad to begin with. Three decades later, 
Springsteen still takes pride in his workmanship and his art, and that's
 strong of him. But the bonus DVDs that bring the damage up to $40 
suggest some questions--and not just who will watch either of them 
twice.<br>
<br>
One disc is a re-edited version of the oft-bootlegged November 1975 
London concert that lasts two hours; the other, 20 minutes of a 1973 
performance in L.A. plus an 87-minute making-of-the-album documentary. 
Surprisingly, it's the documentary that conveys more of the impish 
irrepressibility that made Springsteen so hard to resist onstage when he
 was young. His febrile ambition is less omnipresent than fond memory 
would hope at the London show, which the documentary recalls as if it 
was V-E Day. It's there in London when the singer disappears into an 
onstage crevice during "Spirit in the Night" or launches another chorus 
of "Rosalita," and on the show-topping rock &amp; roll covers. But it's 
intermittent on the Born to Run material and lost in the fog of several 
loosely structured earlier songs. Which isn't even to mention the 
solos--let's hope organist Danny Federici knows how lucky he is to have 
his job.<br>
<br>
In the still photos, taped studio chatter, reminiscences and 
descriptiosn of the 25-year-old Springsteen who bet his life on Born to 
Run, however, youthful intensity is palpable. The idea here, as in so 
much public Springsteen, is to establish a seriousness that avoids the 
pomposity the music risks. We learn Springsteen composed the album's 
melodies on piano and worked out the words in a notebook where a single 
lyric can occupy dozens of mostly scratched-out pages. We hear a 
boogieing run-through of "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out," an abandoned femme 
chorus behind "Born to Run," a lost violin intro to "Jungleland"--all 
possible bonus-cut fodder. Springsteen grins sheepishly at these shards 
of misplaced enthusiasm. They were just errors, history tells the 
auteur. As of 1975, Born to Run said what he wanted to say, and because 
it's a realized work of art, its truth will endure.<br>
<br>
But its truth is now historic. Whatever factual value there once was in 
Springsteen's epic vision of small-town street kids buying a cool old 
car and pursuing their destiny on the road--and it was always a 
romance--is reduced to poetry in a world where college graduates wait 
tables to get through the indentured servitude of internship and gas 
costs whatever the oil companies say it does. But if any rock star knows
 that, it's Springsteen. He's pleased that many of his former 
dead-enders can afford $40 commemorative reissues. If he's also angry 
that today's young have it worse, which he is, he can at least help them
 appreciate their parents' lives.<br>

Bruce Springsteen: Darkness on the Edge of Town [Columbia, 1978]<br>
<br>
"Promised Land," "Badlands," and "Adam Raised a Cain" are models of how 
an unsophisticated genre can illuminate a mature, full-bodied 
philosophical insight. Lyrically and vocally, they move from casual to 
incantatory modes with breathtaking subtlety, jolting ordinary details 
into meaning. But many of the other songs remain local-color pieces, and
 at least two--"Something in the Night" and "Streets of Fire"--are 
overwrought, soggy, all but unlistenable. An important minor artist or a
 rather flawed and inconsistent major one. B+</div>

				<div class="content">The Ascension of Bruce Springsteen<br>
from zero to sixty in five weeks flat with rock's newest superstar<br>
Playboy , March, 1976<br>
By James R. Petersen<br>
<br>
In the night air above Sunset Strip, an 18-foot leather-jacketed Bruce 
Springsteen drapes an arm across the back of a 23-foot saxophone playing
 Clarence Clemons and tries to bury a three-foot grin behind his wrist. 
One block away, the cover photograph from Born to Run is seen on a small
 billboard in the parking lot of Tower Records. Handbills slapped onto 
every telephone pole and blank wall in the area proclaim that the rising
 young rock star-s four-day engagement at the Roxy is sold out. On the 
stage of L.A.'s top music showcase, an only slightly larger than 
life-size Bruce Springsteen hunkers over a microphone, delivering a 
monolog about the days when he and his good buddy Miami Steve Van Zandt 
were the helpless victims of immediate undying love, or, as they say in 
the papers, incurable romanticism. Miami Steve, resplendent in a white 
panama and pink three-piece suit with wide lapels that end somewhere in 
the wings, nods his head. It's all true. "Yeah. Every day, we would sit 
on the steps and watch this girl walk by. The mystery lady. She was 
beautiful. I mean, she was the kind of girl who made you feel dumb about
 stuff. We didn't know her name. Every day, we tried to make each other 
find out her name. It would be Steve's turn; he couldn't do it. It would
 be my turn; I couldn't do it. We tried to get the crazy kid on the 
block to go up and ask her name; he couldn't do it. Then we got guitars.
 Yeah, we got guitars and sat on the steps and watched this girl walk 
by. Finally, it got so bad we moved away." <br>
<br>
Laughter. Miami Steve nods. It's all true. Springsteen pauses, tucks a 
thumb through his suspenders, eyeballs his rhythm-guitar player through 
the spotlights and smoke and brings the story up to date. "You know, 
there oughta be some way we could find out that girl's name. Maybe 
stroll down to Tower Records, pick up a copy of Born to Run and when she
 walks by, drop it casuallike on the sidewalk. 'Oops. My record.' Naw. 
That wouldn't work. I got it. We rent a car. Yeah. We rent a car and 
kinda ease past my billboard. That'll work. I just gotta find out who 
that girl is. I don't know her name, but... all the guys on my block 
call her Pretty Flamingo." <br>
<br>
And the audience is there, back in the days when the whole world was in 
high school and the E Street Band was a bunch of rock 'n' roll rebels, 
playing for the door at some club in the swamps of Jersey, five sets a 
night, 12 songs a set. Here they are, pouring their hearts out on a 
Manfred Mann anthem to impossible beauty, still on fire with the 
feeling, the faith that caused them to pick up guitars and drumsticks in
 the first place. Old fans look at one another and smile. The ascension 
of Bruce Springsteen is under way and there's nothing to worry about. 
Springsteen may wake up in the morning and find his picture on the 
covers of both Time and Newsweek, but the craziness will never change 
the Kid. Inside, he's got everything straight. <br>
<br>
*** <br>
<br>
Early September and something is happening on the East Coast: The rock 
grapevine is heavy with rumors of a great new act. Who is this Bruce 
Springsteen and why are all those people in New York raving about a 
one-week gig at the Bottom Line? Jesus, the reviews of his latest album,
 Born to Run, have most of the people in the Midwest convinced that the 
Columbia School of Journalism is a subsidiary of the record company. <br>
<br>
The facts are that Springsteen's first album, Greetings From Asbury 
Park, N.J., sold about 120,000 copies. Critics had a hard time adjusting
 to the singer's metabolism; the record sounded like Highway 66 played 
at 78 rpm, and that was close enough to earn Springsteen the label of 
another new Dylan. Some said that he sang with the young Van Morrison's 
voice (he picked it up at the Berkeley flea market for a buck, fifty). 
The few people who listened found that the songwriter had re-created the
 Street. The Boardwalk. The Scene. Peopled with ragtag characters whose 
only code was style, the Scene was the place where you were known on 
sight or you weren't known at all. The street was the arena where you 
earned a name like Hazy Davy, Killer Joe, a name that couldn't be found 
in the phone book, because you wouldn't find that person at home. It was
 a seductive vision, developed on Springsteen's next album, The Wild, 
the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle, which sold 175,000 copies. 
Nothing to get excited about, unless you were one of the 175,000. They 
thought it was the best album of the century. Those numbers put 
Springsteen into the cult-artist category. For two years he played small
 clubs and concerts on the East Coast. He developed one of the best live
 acts in the business. He locked himself into a studio for almost a 
year, agonizing over the album that, according to the industry logic, 
was his last chance to be a star. Then Born to Run hit the racks, the 
band went on a nationwide tour and all hell broke loose. The writer 
receives an assignment: Hang out. See what's going on. <br>
<br>
*** <br>
<br>
Springsteen sits quietly on a sofa in the middle of the lobby, flashing 
on the marble, the mirrors, the chandeliers and the people who make such
 rooms their scene. When you aren't the entertainment, sit back and 
watch what is. Springsteen is slight, unimposing, his tan- suede jacket 
subdued. Admittedly, the gold ring in his left ear seems out of place, 
but it is shielded from most of the room by a large person with the bulk
 and peripheral vision of a bodyguard. A friend from Asbury Park. One of
 the 22 people Springsteen keeps on the payroll. Introductions are made.
 ("Hi. I play the lead paragraph for Playboy magazine.") <br>
<br>
The band begins to filter into the lobby. It is immediately evident 
where Springsteen got the inspiration for his characters; also, that 
there is no one left worth looking at on the streets of Asbury Park. 
Miami Steve is the epitome of lower-echelon Mafia Mod: a tailored 
leather jacket, a snazzy panama pulled low over his eyes. He constantly 
arches one eyebrow and vaults his glance over a nonexistent pair of 
sunglasses. Like Springsteen, he wears a gold ring in one ear. Having 
spent the past few years of his life backing groups such as the Dovells 
and Dion (you mean they're still working?) in out-of-the-way roadhouses 
and oldies bars, he is tough, well worn and yet easy to impress. A 
genuine find. Roy "The Professor" Bittan continues the gangster motif 
with crisp elegance. A white-felt fedora, pinstripe suit, goatee. Small 
hands that suggest he could be carrying a violin case on the running 
board of a 1932 Ford, instead of playing baroque barrel-house piano 
behind Springsteen. The Professor met the singer at Charley's in 
Cambridge, asked if he could sit in and hasn't gotten up since. Garry 
"U.S." Tallent puts his hands into his pockets, props one sneaker 
against a marble pillar and flashes an indecently healthy smile. Garry 
has been with Springsteen since the beginning. He owns a 1948 Rock Ola 
jukebox and over 3000 oldies. He once left his bass by the television 
set so he could learn the solo to Secret Agent Man. "Mighty" Max 
Weinberg has hands that could belong to a tail gunner on an old 
Liberator bomber; aviator glasses and a neatly trimmed beard complete 
the image of disciplined strength. He is a scholar of the drums. Danny 
"The Blond Bombshell" Federici is baby-faced and oblivious, decked out 
in a single-zipper leather jacket. He has played organ and accordion 
behind Springsteen for years. Exhausted by the effort, he drops himself 
into an overstuffed armchair and inadvertently brushes an ashtray off 
the table. Cockroach-sized glass fragments chatter across the floor. Not
 very high on the Richter scale of road madness, but it's still early in
 the tour. The band closes in : "God, we can't take you anywhere." The 
incident is taken care of, but a house manager decides to make it into a
 disturbance. Are you guests of the hotel? Are you waiting for someone? 
Would you please return to your rooms and wait there? We can't have 
people like you gathering in our lobby. The boys look to the Boss. He 
will wait for the saxophone player to arrive. When he does, the question
 is settled. Clarence "The Big Kahuna" Clemons is clad in a 
black-leather motorcycle jacket, black leather pants and a black padre 
hat with a silver band. An ex- linebacker, he has the massive calm of 
the man who found King Kong's stash. The boys in the band get high; 
Clarence gets serious. <br>

Are you with the Columbia Record party? The waitress stresses the last 
word, her eyes alight with visions of decadence. Pizzas with grated 
cocaine on top. Kinky sex. Petty vandalism. She shows the group to a 
private room, trying to distinguish the genuine star from the media 
groupies and underassistant Midwest promo men. Some 17 people line the 
table, poking at the deep-fried Frisbees that pass for pizzas in 
Chicago. The waitress settles on one of the local rock critics, a tall, 
lanky, redhead decked out in a denim sailor suit complete with red 
neckerchief and Pinafore hat. He looks the part. Springsteen and the 
Professor take the far end of the table and start rapping about old 
bands. The conversation is animated, stopping only when a good tune, an 
old favorite, comes over the house sound system. Hey, catch that riff. 
Roy is a relative newcomer to E Street; he listens attentively as The 
Boss fills in its history: First was the Castiles, Steel Mill, The 
Rogues, Earth, Child, Doctor Zoom and the Sonic Boom. The names kept 
changing to protect the innocent, to keep them alive and part of the 
scene. The E Street Band is the process of natural selection. The 
musicians who believed in music, in Springsteen, stayed with the band 
through all the changes. The result is an organism with a collective 
musical experience of over 100 man-years. (Later, Garry explains the 
process: "A bunch of us used to get together at a club called the 
Upstage and jam for two hours on I'm a Man. We formed bands. We always 
thought Bruce was a good act. If there was a chance of any of us making a
 living through music, we figured it would have to happen through him.")
 With an endorsement like that, Springsteen doesn't need the hype. <br>
<br>
The Boss is into the days when he didn't have a band, only friends he 
called up in emergencies. Or opportunities. "This club owner contacted 
me and said if I didn't show up at his place on Saturday night with a 
band, he'd kill me. Now, I played family clubs in New Jersey that were 
pretty rough, but this guy was serious. He knew where I lived. Yeah. 
Some of those club owners were crazy. There was one guy, pulled out a 
gun one night and shot an amplifier. Can you see it? Smoke curling up 
the ceiling. Absolute quiet. And he says, 'I told you guys to turn 
down.'" <br>
<br>
The writer slides his chair back from the table and presents his 
question: He's had Born to Run on his turntable for about a week and he 
still doesn't know what to think about tit. It's obviously rock 'n' 
roll. At least, there are no songs on it in danger of becoming crossover
 country hits. But it's different from the second album. Something 
happened. What? <br>
<br>
"E Street was a lazy hanging-out summer album. Davey Sancious, our piano
 player back the, was actually living on E Street. No. I don't know 
which came first - the or the band's name. It's all confused. That was 
the summer the band consciousness started to develop. We were just 
sitting there, flashing on everything that was happening. I was exactly 
where I wanted to be. I had a band. I knew who I was. We were getting 
work. The album reflects that. On the new record, I don't know who I am.
 You see, about five months after E Street came out, there was this big 
burst of attention from the press. Suddenly, I was the future of rock 
'n' roll. That much attention pushed me back to the time when there 
wasn't any. Working on Born to Run was a very scary thing. I was born, 
grew old and died making that album. We knew what we wanted to do; it 
was just a very hard thing to do. We weren't making mistakes. The E 
Street Band doesn't make mistakes. Those guys are so good they're down 
to intangibles. At the Bottom Line, I climbed out across the tables, 
into the audience, and looked at those guys just standing there onstage 
doing their stuff. I almost didn't come back. We play the same notes 
every night, but sometimes something happens. Maybe it's a guy's face in
 the first row. Maybe it's something someone says. But it happens and 
it's what we play for. Some bands, something starts happening onstage, 
they fuck up. Not my guys. But working in a studio, none of that counts;
 it's a different thing. You get by on your ability to do the same thing
 25 times in a row. It's not creative. You are what you know, what 
you've learned. It's almost impossible to get a spark going, 'cause the 
spark doesn't come from technique. <br>
<br>

<br>
The official guide to blues in Chicago, the red-haired rock critic who 
won the heart of the waitress because he looked like the kid in the 
Buster Brown shoes, is lost. The caravan of rented cars cruises along a 
wide industrial boulevard, past a White Castle, a junk yard, through the
 maze of streets beneath the Skyway, the highway that passes above, but 
not through. Chicago's South Side. They guys in the E Street Band are 
beginning to eye the critic like this was the start of a Last Great 
Fiasco. <br>
<br>
The Queen Bee finally turns up, a triangular bar attached to a larger 
building. The windows are painted over, the walls covered with Day-Glo 
posters of the sexual Zodiac. A dozen ways to Put Your Legs Against the 
Wall, Woman. The stage area, if that's what it can be called, looks like
 the corner of a church basement: a clutter of folding chairs, small 
tables, a set of drums, two amps, an electric piano, one spotlight. Mr. 
Junior Wells, a black blues singer whose name is on half of the records 
Miami Steve owns, sits alone in a booth, nursing a cold. Miami Steve 
falls out, makes the necessary introductions, pays the unnecessary 
respects. Wells asks where they playing. The Auditorium? That's nice. 
Springsteen takes a stool at the bar and puts his body on hold. <br>
<br>
The house band starts to warm up for the set: Would Miami Steve like to 
sit in? Are you kidding? Are Chess Records round? Is Phil Spector the 
Pope? Miami takes up Muddy Waters' old guitar, settles into a half 
crouch so loose you wonder where the extra joints are and starts 
trucking in place. After a few measures, he plays against the harp, 
another pickup musician just sitting in , setting up textures, putting 
the man through his paces. Very nice. The bass player has a grin on that
 could power a small city. <br>
<br>
Wells takes over the microphone and you can forget his cold, forget the 
lack of equipment. He's playing for musicians, a jury of his peers. He 
is Mr. Junior Wells. He can survive the setbacks, the minor indignities,
 and there are some. A large woman trundles toward the stage, steps over
 the bass player and through a green door that, it turns out, leads to 
the ladies room. She neglects to close the door behind her and the bass 
player, without losing a beat, kicks it shut. The guitar player's string
 breaks in the middle of a song. "Any of you guys got an E string? Fuck.
 I don't need it." The man counts down for the classic Got My Mojo 
Working. Two beats into the song, he holds up his hand. The band stops, 
starts again, stops. The piano player is a little fast: "Too bad you 
didn't have money on that boy; he was way out ahead." The band 
negotiates. The piano player defends himself. "This is the way the song 
starts." And sure enough, this time it is. <br>
<br>
*** <br>
<br>
Springsteen and the writer are huddled in the back seat of another car. 
Both are silent. The intensity of the quiet might be mistaken for 
concern or worry; it is not that but something else. Preoccupation - the
 compression that precedes a performance. The writer is playing back the
 evening, cataloging the good parts for future reference. Springsteen is
 doing the same thing, maybe, for his own job. Roy is doing it, out 
loud, in the front seat. "Did you see that? Their whole P.A. was just 
that one Earth Amp. The bass player was sitting on the sound system." 
The Boss has already reviewed that detail, reached a decision: "It cut 
the room." Roy and the driver, a tall guy named Stretch, discuss tape 
recorders. The Professor is looking for a small portable: He has wanted 
one since the night he saw his namesake, Professor Longhair, a piano 
player from the days of Fats Domino. "That guy did things you wouldn't 
believe. I went home and stayed up all night trying to play everything 
I'd heard, but it just wasn't the same." Was the band planning to tape 
any of its concerts? "I think one of the shows at the Roxy is being 
recorded for a live album." Is that at the end of the tour? Springsteen 
answers, "I don't think this tour has an end." <br>
<br>
*** <br>
<br>
The Auditorium is one of those artdeco rooms that make you wonder if 
turn-of-the-century architects were on to the drugs that the rest of the
 world discovered in the Sixties. Marble caverns and velvet corposa 
cavernosas waiting to be engorged with music. Chrome water fountains and
 friends at odd intervals in the lobby. More balconies than are 
considered safe or possible ascending toward a goldleaf ceiling strung 
with lights and tiny angels. The room has the reputation of being cold, 
rowdy, weird. Opening acts broken on the rumble of inattention. 
Headliners driven to despair by idiots asking to hear Whipping Post. 
It's a high-risk room, not unlike the Star Chamber of the Inquisition. 
Sitting in the tenth row, the writer is reminded of the story about 
South American soccer fans who wrap foil around their programs. If a 
referee makes a bad call, they focus beams of sunlight on the 
unfortunate official. The stadium becomes a parabolic mirror, the 
referee a cinder. In Chicago, the weapon is darkness, but the effect can
 be the same. The writer wonders what will happen next. He has come to 
the concert as unprepared as his local pharmacist can make him, but 
fragments of reviews still impinge, still try to structure his 
expectation. The future of rock 'n' roll? The writer is interested only 
in the immediate present. Is it now yet? <br>
<br>
*** <br>
<br>
The boys come out in full force, looking like a piece of the Boardwalk 
lifted off the Jersey shore and laid down in Chicago, only more so. 
Springsteen, dead center in a shaft of green light, is The Boss. The 
Kid. Jeans, mirrored shades, sneakers, a classic black motorcycle jacket
 - the kind you have to kill for. After a high, bright lonely Thunder 
Road, Springsteen kicks out the chocks and sends the band screeching 
into Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out, a low- rent R&amp;B number that lets him 
romp over the stage, snapping his fingers, clapping his hands, 
establishing his turf with bursts of precise, exuberant energy. If he 
ever plays Madison Square Garden, he'll be running laps on the upper 
tiers. The song closes with Springsteen pounding on Miami Steve, an 
abrupt double shot, the last gesture in a pinball game. That's it. Check
 the score. <br>
<br>
The audience is shattered with astonishment. The writer remembers a 
scene in Butch Cassidy where the two heroes apply for jobs a payroll 
guards. A mineowner asks Redford if he can shoot. You mean like this, 
just standing there? He fires, misses. The mineowner starts to walk 
away. Redford asks, an I move? I'm better when I move. Sure. the Kid 
whirls, fires and the target becomes sunlight. With complete authority, 
Springsteen gets the job. He carves the visual space, singing the body 
electric. Every gesture is or seems to be absolutely necessary. 
Littering the stage with clues, he stalks the world he creates, looking 
for pieces that fit, the details, the phrases that will make the song 
come alive. He doesn't offer solutions, just enough pieces to suggest 
that there is a mystery, that at least he is on to something. And with 
surprising frequency, there are connections, moments of recognition 
between the audience and the performer. The contact can be tentative, 
fleeting, a glimpse of what might have happened. Or it can be solid, a 
moment you build a life around. <br>
<br>
Flashes: Miami Steve, Garry, Clarence and Roy all donning shades to do 
backup vocals on a few oldies: the Asbury Park equivalent of a Greek 
tragic chorus. They second the emotion. And, another: During Spirit in 
the Night, Springsteen plays with a floppy jockey's cap, nonchalantly 
tossing it over a microphone stand, shaking out some "dust that will 
show you where it's at or at least it will help let you really feel it."
 The song is an excursion into the night where gypsy angels go. The trip
 gets out of hand, the night becomes filled with hurt. The band plays 
silence. Springsteen sinks to the stage, taking the audience into the 
darkness of the night, into the pitch. He looks back over his shoulder 
at the microphone stand, tries to toss the hat over the isolated prop a 
second time. It is hopelessly out of reach. The hoarse voice takes 
forever to say the next line: "Hazy Davy got really hurt, he ran into 
the lake..."<br>
<br>
The audience is there, wanting to help, reaching out to touch. Someone 
can't wait, completes the rhyme - "in just his socks and a shirt." <br>
<br>
Springsteen darts his eyes in the direction of the voice. before the 
spell can be broken, before the panic sets in that some lunatic has 
abused this moment of complete, acknowledged vulnerability, he states 
softly, "That's my line." The bond restored, he continues. "Me and Crazy
 Janey was making love in the dirt, singing our birthday songs. Janey 
said it was time to go, so we closed our eyes and said goodbye..." His 
voice hangs on the precipice. Just when you think you know how small he 
feels, Springsteen rolls off the stage, into the pit. The bottom falls 
out of the Auditorium, the architecture permanently changed, in one 
terrible second. From out of the pit comes Springsteen's voice, filled 
with longing and reassurance: "To gypsy angel row. Felt so right. 
Together we moved like spirits in the night." And suddenly the singer is
 in the audience, moving along the front rows. The spotlights can't find
 him. The local guys who run the lights are civil-defense leftovers out 
looking for bombers. Fuck this. The singer turns around, jumps back into
 the pit, tosses the microphone up to Clarence, climbs out and up, 
skipping across the speaker columns, kicking over an amplifier that was 
worked on for three months to get it just right. All right. Spirits in 
the night. Stand up and let 'em shoot right through you. <br>
<br>
*** <br>
<br>
The writer looks at his hand: Halfway through the saxophone break on 
Jungleland, his Bix PM 39 Deluxe Medium Point pen, the one that writes 
first time every time, erupted, spilling thick black ink over seat 
backs, journals and clothes. Moral: Thou shalt not take notes a rock 'n'
 roll concert. <br>
<br>
Springsteen is upstairs under a full body massage, unwinding, trying to 
cope with the aftereffect of a concert. He plays for the adrenaline 
rush, the feeling of being possessed by the spirit of rock 'n' roll. 
Adrenaline is nature's way of getting you through extreme emergencies. 
If you're responsible, you can be a hero: Rip the roof off the 
overturned car and when you're finished, find the nearest hospital, give
 a quart of blood, and watch some old geezer get it up for the first 
time in years. Of course, you can also get caught out. Let the moment 
slip by, don't take control and the body goes into shock. Where's the 
accident? It becomes clear that Springsteen is not pleased with the 
concert. "For something to happen, you have to be loose. You have to 
take risks, be willing to make a fool of yourself. Then it flows. 
Tonight wasn't bad, but we can be twice that good. You should see us 
when we're hot." The writer, his synapses fused into a single mass of 
solid-state enthusiasm, is at a loss for words. It had been magic, the 
kind that's supposed to free your soul, but talking about it is like 
trying to tell a stranger, or a member of a band, about rock 'n' roll. 
Springsteen doesn't want to know what worked for you: He only knows what
 works for himself, and he doesn't know that until he's tried it. He 
keeps his options open. He keeps the vessel clean. <br>
<br>
*** <br>
<br>
The Roxy is as weird in its own way as the Auditorium. Tables radiate 
from the bandstand across what used to be a dance floor. It will be one 
again before the night is over. The waitresses navigate the crowd with 
consummate skill; they are on the verge of being discovered. Each time a
 drink is brought to the table, the patron must initial the check beside
 the order. This is Hollywood. Autographs and credit are intertwined. <br>
<br>
The lightning is incidental to the stage, which is to say, not at all. 
Picking up his vodka and tonic, the writer is unable to find by sight 
alone the surface of his table. Eying a particular pattern of light and 
shadow, he finally decides, sets his glass down and watches it disappear
 into blackness, thumping against the floor by his toes. Another reason 
to autograph each drink order. <br>
<br>
A raised section of tables opposite the stage is occupied by the guests 
and employees of Columbia. Either they are genuinely enthusiastic about 
the show or the company hires PR people who suffer from St. Vitus' 
dance. Glen Brunman, an a&amp;r man from New York, is standing on a 
chair, celebrating his 25th Springsteen concert. Aimee Simple, a lithe, 
lively girl who works in the West Coast office, leans against the rail 
that encloses the dance floor, doing a slow and sensuous shuffle to 
celebrate her first. Yes, it is nice, she says, when your job brings you
 places where your mind can make you happy. <br>
<br>
Cher and Gregg Allman make an appearance, then a disappearance when it 
seems that there aren't any seats available, then a reappearance when it
 is found that there are. The white paster cast on Gregg's hand gleams 
in the dark, before disappearing into his leather jacket. It must be a 
full body cast. He does not move for the entire performance, not even 
when the band hits the chorus of Rosalita, which has an effect on the 
rest of the club similar to that of a fist slammed down on the table. 
Watch the salt shakers dance. Cher is only slightly more mobile, the 
fringe on her leather jacket shifting in a breeze from the air 
conditioning. She mistakes the intro of Jackie DeShannon's When You Walk
 in the Room for Needles and Pins and screams, "Sonny wrote that song!" 
He didn't. Later, Miami Steve will report that the couple liked the 
show: "Of course, by the time they got to the Roxy they were undoubtedly
 so full of whatever celebrities eat for breakfast they probably thought
 they were dancing." <br>
<br>
The rest of the audience could be on Springsteen's payroll. Every night 
the show ends with the audience calling out, "Play everything you ever 
played," and the band obliges. The farther west the band travels, the 
more people they meet from New Jersey. The state's most important export
 is people. Asbury Park is in the middle of the state. Farther north, 
the natives think they're in New York. Farther south, they think they're
 in Alabama. The middle produces relatively sane people like Jack 
Nicholson. Nicholson and Garry went to the same high school. Neptune 
High School. They will spend three hours in the Rainbow Bar discussing 
the tedious fact that the whole fucking world is from New Jersey. <br>
<br>
*** <br>
<br>
The morning after the last Roxy concert, the writer gets a call from 
Miami Steve, who is having brunch at the Beverly Hills Hotel. <br>
<br>
"You've gotta come over and see this. Bruce's picture is on the cover of
 Time and Newsweek. We're stars!" When you get here, have the bell 
captain page me." <br>
<br>
The bell captain is somewhat skeptical. Does the person perhaps have a 
last name? No, Miami is his first name, Steve is his last name. Any clue
 to what he looks like? Well, he was last seen wearing a silk race-track
 shirt with palm trees on it. Ask your gardener if one of his plants is 
having lunch on the patio.<br>
<br>
The writer is led to Miami Steve's table and introduced to Jimmy Iovine,
 the 22-year-old electronic wizard who engineered Born to Run. His name 
is scratched in a sidewalk over by the bungalows, a souvenir of the time
 he worked on John Lennon's Rock and Roll Years. ("I saw this fresh 
cement. I'm from Brooklyn. I couldn't resist.") <br>
<br>
Iovine explains the electronics of the show, specifically the echo in 
Backstreets, which holds a razor blade to the spinal cord of everyone in
 the audience. He thinks Springsteen's voice is one of the four great 
rock 'n' roll instruments of all time. Right up there with Lennon's, Rod
 Stewart's and Elvis'. "I like what it does to my dials. What did you 
think of the mix on Born to Run? Better than on Captain Fantastic? 
That's too bad. We were trying for Sgt. Pepper's. The next album, you're
 gonna put the needle in the groove and you won't be able to pick it up.
 The needle will be saying, 'I want to play this'." <br>
<br>
Miami Steve discusses the craziness of the past few days. "It's been a 
ragged week. We're due for vacation. Bruce's time is totally accounted 
for with the morning interview, the afternoon interview. Now it's gonna 
get worse with these two stories. Everybody's gonna be asking us what 
it's like to be a phenomenon. I don't even know how to spell the word. 
Is that with a P or an F? There are journalists hanging around our home 
town interviewing our friends, record scouts hunting for the Asbury Park
 sound.We gotta live there, too, you know." <br>
<br>
Iovine spots Dyan Cannon sitting at a table across the patio and goes 
nuts. "She is my mystery lady. My Pretty Flamingo." Miami Steve makes a 
suggestion. "Well, you could take this copy of Newsweek over to her 
table and ask her if she's like to meet one of the people in Bruce 
Springsteen's band, and then I could introduce you. That might work." 
The writer leaves them. They won't do it. And they'll never learn how.</div>

Bruce's creative juices; the evolution of a myth<br>
<br>
Trouser Press , October 1980<br>
By Wayne King<br>
<br>
He had the reputation as the best guitar player on the Jersey shore. He 
had led various bands through all styles of rock'n roll: a 
Southern-based sound, not unlike the Allmann Bros., with Steel Mill; a 
10-piece R&amp;B revue with the Bruce Springsteen Band, and a host of 
other groupings and stylings. By 1972 he was on his own, an eccentric 
solo act with verbose songs mocking his painful Catholic past. Armed 
with only his eclectic talent, a guitar and pushy new manager Mike 
Appel, he auditioned for CBS executive John Hammond. Hammond was 
mightily impressed by intense and enigmatic tunes like "Arabian Nights,"
 "Growin' Up," "If I Was the Priest" and "Southern Son"; he signed up 
Bruce Springsteen immediately. <br>
<br>
But there were troubles straight out. The scope of Springsteen's 
songwriting abilities led to a misconception of his talent. John Hammond
 pictured him as a solo performer (as did Appel), although hed had a few
 ideas about expanding Springsteen's natural charisma beyond the 
traditional singer-songwriter image. This confusion resulted in some 
Columbia promotional genius dreaming up the disastrous "new Dylan" hype.
 If anything, Springsteen was more updated Beat than new Dylan: his ?50s
 images, verbal excesses and obsessions with organized religion and the 
city lacked only a cool jazz backing. Rock was his medium, though, and 
he quickly left the revival of Beat images and values to Tom Waits. <br>
<br>
Problems arose from lack of experience all around. The Jim Cretecos/Mike
 Appel Production team simply could not realize the rock 'n' roll 
inherent in Springsteen's songs, and the singer's own ignorance of 
studio possibilities resulted in the restrained sound of Greetings from 
Asbury Park (1973). Springsteen played "It's hard to Be a Saint in the 
City" for John Hammond with a clear idea of the tune as a rock number. 
Yet the version on vinyl (a last-minute replacement for the anti-war 
"American Tune," which made it onto some early promotional copies) fades
 on the final chorus, precisely where in concert the song develops into a
 jet-propelled guitar duel between Springsteen and Miami Steve Van 
Zandt. <br>
<br>
Many of the conflicts surrounding his image and music were abetted by 
Springsteen himself. Sometimes it seemed even he didn't know what was 
going to happen next. At any given moment Danny Federici could move from
 organ to accordion and Gary Tallent from bass to tuba, as on the folkie
 aberration "The Bishop Danced" (on the premiere King Biscuit Flower 
Hour show). Springsteen didn't discard all his folkie tendencies until 
1974, and his eclecticism often led to a disjointed show. But it was 
this drive, this push towards a personal music structure, that was his 
greatest strength. Rock's best accomplishments come from exploration, 
but the results must always be true to form. Springsteen most resembles 
Pete Townshend, whose experiments with larger structures and electronics
 are always laid on to top of the Who's solid rock foundation. <br>
<br>
Springsteen went about things in nearly the opposite way, but the 
results were often powerfully similar. He took all his discoveries and 
constantly edited them down, channeling and focusing his explorations 
into a dynamic, increasingly simple form. Critics misjudged him to be an
 encyclopedic nostalgist; instead, as Greil Marcus described the Band's 
music, "[its] richness...is the ability to contain endless combinations 
of American popular music without imitating any of them.... This was a 
new sound, but you could recognize yourself in that sound." <br>
<br>
His ambitions stimulated his muse; tunes rolled off his pen, and 
arrangements changed often. More and more he remolded his image from 
wordy performer to the Boss, the E Street Band leader, a role reflected 
in ever-increasing soul influences. He still wrote songs that depended 
for impact on a flow of obscure but enticing words - songs like "And the
 Band Played" and "Santa Ana": <br>
<br>
...and the giants of science spend their days and nights not with wives,
 not with lovers but searching for the lights they're spotted in the 
desert on their helicopter flights. <br>
<br>
But more and more his writing reflected old soul influences and his 
storytelling power revealed itself in tales of kids living out desperate
 lives. <br>
<br>
Resurrected from days of Dr. Zoom and His Sonic Boom was "You Mean So 
Much to Me" (later covered on the first Jukes LP as a duet by Southside 
Johnny and Ronnie Spector, herself a goddess in the crucial Spector 
pantheon). "Zero and Blind Terry" and "The Beat Song," both recorded for
 the second album, emphasized Springsteen's growing concern with teen 
escape and its means. "Zero" was not unlike Del Shannon's "Stranger in 
Town" - a tale of two kids on the run - but degenerated into a paranoid 
fantasy where "Terry's dad hired some troopers to kill Zero and bring 
Terry back home." "The Beat Song" contained a few phrases later into 
"Born to Run," and kicked off with display of developing automobile 
ethos: <br>
<br>
Well Billy bought a Chevy for the coupe deluxe Chrome wheels, stick 
shift, hey, give her gas, pop the clutch... The highway id alive 
tonight, so baby do not be frightened There's somethin' 'bout a pretty 
girl on a sweet summer night that gets this boy excited. <br>
<br>
Though the tune featured a peppy Farfisa sound reminiscent of so many of
 Springsteen's Nuggets-era faves, both "The Beat Song" and "Zero" were 
not quite ready because he had not yet developed his own rock 
songwriting style. Their action takes place in suburbs and on highways; 
Springsteen was still thinking soul, and soul's action is pure city. <br>
<br>
And so his ambition led him to tackle the biggest city of them all on 
1973's The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle. "New York City 
Serenade" was first tried out on stage, an entirely different idea from 
what it became: just Springsteen and Clarence Clemons would come out to 
start the show. (Slow, mostly solo openings were a Springsteen stage 
rule for the next few years.) The tune fit in more with Greetings 
material: <br>
<br>
...and with a tommygun blast he got the people screamin', runnin' from 
the streets 'Til he falls helpless in Time Square just like street scum 
cryin' "New York City kills her young, New York City kills her young" 
From a tenement window a baby cries. <br>
<br>
From that rather wild view, Springsteen stretched out the music and cut 
the words down to a more impressionistic picture. To finish the sound 
tapestry he added ghostly strings, whistling through his man-made urban 
canyons. <br>
<br>
The city, its characters and a fascination with sound dominated The 
Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle. The tittle song, a raucous 
R&amp;B party/noise number, was derived from Major Lance's "Monkey 
Time." "Kitty's Back" built off a blues base into a wild piece of 
improvisation; it was to be the instrumental showpiece for the next two 
years. The real signpost for the future, though, was "Incident on 57th 
Street." Springsteen was now entering his West Side Story period, and 
finally finding his own voice in his songwriting. Wisely, with the 
second album he had chosen to display his influences openly. Now he had 
to dig deeper into his own vision, his own perspective on rock history, 
to make good on all the possibilities his talent promised. <br>
<br>
Towards that end, Springsteen used the stage to try out his experiments.
 The E Street Band was tightened by replacing drummer "Mad Dog" Vini 
Lopez with Ernest "Boom" Carter, a friend of keyboardist David Sancious.
 Shows were getting longer and wilder; old rockers were tossed into the 
mayhem, arrangements changed almost nightly, and new compositions were 
being revised and added on all the time. <br>
<br>
Tying into the past to create a context for his work, Springsteen began 
to feature regularly oldies that were closest to the spirit of his own 
ideas. "The future of rock'n roll" had to assimilate rock's past before 
distilling (his idea of) its essence into his work. Thus Rufus Thomas's 
"Walking the Dog," Fats Domino's "Let the Four Winds Blow" and "I'm 
Ready," the Chiffons' "A Love So Fine" (recorded later, during the Born 
to Run sessions), teendream master Chuck Berry's "You Never Can Tell" 
and "No Money Down" all worked their way into the act. <br>
<br>
Sandwiched around these numbers were new versions of older songs; the 
drive toward new form caused Springsteen to change his mind on the best 
way to present set compositions. "The E Street Shuffle," for instance, 
was played at the LP version's tempo for a while, but soon slowed down 
and eventually became the setting for a tall tale of Springsteen's 
initial meeting with future King of the World Master of the Universe 
Clemons. "For You" evolved into an excruciatingly beautiful piece, with 
Springsteen alone at the piano; the entire mood of the song and the show
 itself was transformed by his haunting vocal. "New York City Serenade,"
 a constant up until Born to Run, became even longer and more 
intensetruly epic in proportion. <br>
<br>
"Epic" is as useful a word as any to describe Springsteen's songwriting 
attempts of this period. Although his ambition, coupled with a growing 
fanatical appreciation of his talent, was leading up to a post-Born to 
Run backlash that hasn't yet died out, it was at this time that he 
shifted into high gear. "Born to Run" was written and laid down in early
 summer, 1974, its layers of guitars, strings and even a female chorus 
(in one of the dozens of mixes) a striking example of the man's desire 
to put everything into his music. "Jungleland" also popped into shows 
around this time, drastically different from the final product, with 
even a swing jazz middle (probably the last contribution of 
jazz-oriented Sancious, who departed with Carter in August to be 
replaced by Roy Bittan and Max Weinberg). <br>
<br>
Compositions were coming out slowly, but Springsteen's conception of 
them was dramatically broad and varied. He had shifted his focus from 
big-city soul to its white equivalent (say, from Ben E. King to Phil 
Spector) but held onto strings as an essential part of the orchestral 
sound in his head. Violinist Suki Lahav, wife of engineer Louis Lahav, 
joined the band in the fall. In December and January, 1975, Springsteen 
headed to the studio to make a new record. <br>
<br>
Springsteen's attempts at making Born to Run were to be frustrating, and
 unfortunately set the norm for his work habits in the studio from then 
on (in one word: lonnng). The new material demanded a unified texture 
but he could not decide which elements to take out of the impossibly 
tangled tapestry of sounds that made them up. Strings added to most of 
the longer numbers fit in nicely since they had been written on piano 
and not guitar. "Backstreets" was once sweetened this way; "Jungleland" 
also featured strings in place of the saxophone solo. <br>
<br>
The enormity of the project and the band's impoverished state put them 
back on the road in February, delaying completion of the LP but helping 
out in other ways. Weinberg and Bittan were settling in and expanding 
the range of the E Street Band; this was better accomplished on stage 
than in the studio. Rock history has consistently shown that live work 
clears up many problems studios create, for - in concert - songs must 
communicate more directly to satisfy the audience. Songs also became 
tighter and harder with roadwork., and this was exactly where expansive 
Springsteen's newest compositions needed help. His performances helped 
boil down his style to the monolithic sound on Born to Run. <br>
<br>
A radio broadcast from the Main Point in Philadelphia (a 
rabidly-Springsteen town) in early 1975 demonstrated how far he had come
 and, conversely, how much further he had to go. Springsteen opened with
 a tremendously changed " Incident on 57th Street" - just voice, violin 
and piano blended together tenderly. He followed it with a rowdy, trashy
 version of Harold Dorman's "Mountain of Love"; joining wonderful rock 
junk to a fragile arrangement of one of his greatest streets enhanced 
both. As the show rolled on, Springsteen alternately confused and 
dazzled the crowd with still-developing tunes like "She's the One" and 
"Thunder Road." The latter, including a Latinate instrumental ending, 
contained most of the finished lyrics except, curiously, the phrase 
"Thunder Road." He even tackled Dylan, using Lahav's yearning violin to 
cry out "I Want You." <br>
<br>
By testing new material on radio in an area where he should have been 
doing his damnedes to consolidate his popularity - such as playing 
standards straight - Springsteen displayed not only his conviction but 
the desperation of his musical dilemma. Yet even a month on the road 
didn't clear things up. <br>
<br>
Springsteen ended up at New York's Record Plant with new co-producer 
John Landau, and spent what he has since called the worst time of his 
life living behind soundproofed walls. He dug deep - not only into 
rock'n' roll past - but his own; he revived a few lines from "Santa Ana"
 for "She's the One," and went back as far as "Jazz Musician" 
(auditioned for John Hammond) to get some words for "Tenth Avenue Freeze
 Out." That he still wasn't satisfied after the record was completed was
 proven by his itchy desire to scrap it all and record the Bottom Line 
(New York) dates, and perhaps by the evolution of "Thunder Road" and 
"She's the One." <br>
<br>
The versions heard at the Main Point were altered greatly as 
Springsteens searched for what he wanted. "She's the One" was strangely 
violent: "You were with me in New York the time they pushed real hard 
and baby I got beat/You left me wasted - wasted, darlin', right there in
 the street." It also contained more than a few chunks of what became 
"Backstreets": "... and we hated the cops/I hated the lies, and I hated 
the truth that ran us down. "Finally whittled down to the album's ode to
 an impossible angel, Springsteen added a chugging harmonica 
introduction after Born to Run's release, and later incorporated Bo 
Diddley's "Mona" into its rhythmic opening. <br>
<br>
"Thunder Road" changed even more. Originally "Walking in the Streets" 
(which melody eventually became "Thunder Road"'s instrumental coda), it 
went through some interim versions in its story of a heist: <br>
<br>
Oh, baby, I can't lay the stars at your feet Oh, but I think we could 
take it all, just you and me Oh, c'mon and see, there's a lot of room 
for you, baby, in the back seat. <br>
<br>
The Main Point version had some neat lines that were cut later: <br>
<br>
Now the season's over, and I feel I getting cold I wish I could take to 
some sandy beach where we'd never grow old Oh, but baby, you know that's
 just jive The night's bustin' open and I'm alive Oh, baby, if you can 
make me feel like a man. <br>
<br>
When he had the words down nearly to what was finally recorded, 
Springsteen cut a demo alone on acoustic guitar and let the band go 
through it. Born to Run's "Thunder Road" had the characteristically hard
 mix that dominated the disc. After all that time spent figuring out a 
full band arrangement, though, Springsteen toured with it as a solo 
piece, sometimes opening shows with just one piano, his harmonica and a 
heart-tugging reading of the romantic lyric. As he told Crawdaddy's 
Peter Knobler: "None of my songs ever end. I've been thinking about it, 
and all of them sort of just go on ... but I think I like it that way." 
Some understatement. <br>
<br>
With great relief, Springsteen and band took to the highway to break out
 of the often confining "cult" straitjacket and support their 
make-or-break record. Old shore buddy Miami Steve joined up, taking over
 most guitar duties from Springsteen, who virtually turned his back on 
the instrument for a while. The instantly legendary Bottom Line stint 
showcased an almost brash Boss, firmly believing in the power and guts 
of the album and his own reputation. The resultant furor over "hype" and
 the media maelstrom that threatened to engulf everybody only helped 
establish his name; he acquitted himself admirably in the face of a "too
 much, too soon" celebrity that could have destroyed his careful 
balance. <br>
<br>
The enormous response Born to Run received extended to packed clubs and 
halls (the tour, with small venues, was booked before the record's 
release). The show was the best yet. Rocking harder than ever, 
Springsteen ripped through remaining barriers between him and his 
audience. "Kitty's Back" was opened up to encompass all aspects of the 
band's abilities. It built through shifting solos from organ, piano and 
guitar, finally tearing halls asunder with the "ooh, all right" chorus 
and otherworldly blowing from Clemons, the Big Man. "Rosalita" finally 
matched its power on record, firmly taking position as pre-encore 
finale. <br>
<br>
The Spector beat of "Then She Kissed Me" slid easily into the set; it 
was clearly a tribute to one of Springsteen's most deeplyfelt 
influences. Mitch Ryder and The Detroit Wheels' white R&amp;B antics 
were loosely grouped in the "Detroit Medley" of "Devil with a Blue 
Dress/Good Golly, Miss Molly/C.C. Rider/Jenny Take a Ride." 
Springsteen's non-originals were now mainly second-generation white 
rock'n' roll, embracing even the British Invasion. The Searchers' "When 
You Walk in the Room," with its folk-rock hints, and Manfred Mann,s 
"Pretty Flamingo" were handled gracefully. <br>
<br>
English rock was to pervade Springsteen's writing through the next year,
 but for the rest of the tour he wrote nothing, nor did he introduce 
newly-penned numbers on stage. Although his work is most effective in 
the heat of performance, it is often constructed under conditions of 
solitude. Springsteen's ability to create quintessential rock while 
removed from its natural milieu is sometimes staggering, but it is 
always a time-consuming process. In late 1975 he simply did not have 
time to take the next step his musical progress demanded. <br>
<br>
A British CBS ad at the time read, "1976 is the year of Bruce 
Springsteen - why wait?" Because of increasingly legal hassles with soon
 to be ex-manager Appel, Springsteen's follow-through on his new success
 would have to wait. He was shut out of the studio for next year and a 
half. In a way, though, this impossed legal limbo sparked a maturity 
that may not have developed under less pressure. He kept busy by touring
 the South for two months, showing off his latest piece, "Frankie. 
"Summer went by without any activity except a week of shows in Red Bank,
 New Jersey, in August, and the shaving of his beard. With fall came 
work on the road, including a first try at an arena. The drive of his 
music coincided with the necessary push towards playing bigger places; 
he simply thought bigger and played tougher and longer. <br>
<br>
Springsteen intensified his vision by emphasizing the major Anglo 
musicians who had appealed to him as a youth: the Rollling Stones and 
the Animals. Like a lot of people, he learned about Buddy Holly, Bo 
Diddley and especially Chuck Berry from the Stones, and later went back 
to the original sources. Even more important were the Animals; "It's my 
Life" and "We Gotta Get Out of This Place" were precise indicators of 
the moral frontiers Springsteen was exploring. "It's My Life" 's 
father-and-son story is both frighteningly personal and universally 
recognizable. Springsteen made it such a depressingly accurate picture 
of a buried life that it exhausted his audience. Only "Tunder Road," his
 anthem to romantic salvation, could follow it. "We Gotta Get Out of 
This Place" chronicled perpectly the working-class idea, so crucial to 
his Darkness material, of escape from traps that had already claimed 
one's parents. <br>
<br>
His own attempt at British Invasion-style writing was "Rendezvous," a 
mediumtempo pop- rocker later offered to the Knack and covered by Greg 
Kihn. Other tunes unveiled on the fall tour were the mournful "The 
Promise" and "Something in the Night." The Latter, with a melancholy 
trumpet (the Asbury Jukes' Miami Horns section sat in with the E Street 
Band on occasion), was a world-weary rendition. Its wordiness was 
indicative of original Springsteen ideas; it was cut down on Darkness, 
with transcendent moans replacing excessive phrases. <br>
<br>
The rest of the songs were cranked up to seam-busting power. Springsteen
 had reached the pinnacle of his narrative abilities; "It's My Life" and
 "Growin' Up" featured his best stories (faithfully recounted by the 
Boss' Boswell, Dave Marsh, in his excellent bio). "Backstreets," victim 
of a claustrophobic mix on Born to Run, was now powerful in its 
spaciousness. Roy Bittan contributed a delicate piano opening, and the 
middle was enlarged to focus on the story of a lie - a breaking of a 
promise so deep its pain was built into a majestic howl alongside "the 
bells that ring in the deep part of the night." The Preoccupation with 
faith and the difficulties of sustaining it combined with a capacious 
structure to anticipate the rock blues form that became Darkness. <br>
<br>
With a spring trip through the Norteast and Midwest under his belt, and 
the lawsuit settled in May, 1976, it was time to make a new record. At 
first it seemed as if things would go quickly, but Springsteen's writing
 technique had changed from continual expansion to gradual reduction. 
This editing did not come easy, for to retain everything in his music 
and employ a more direct style was nearly impossible. Not that it would 
have been easier for anyone else; after all, it took Pete Townshend all 
of Quadrophenia to sum up what "My Generation" said in three minutes. 
Springsteen's songs were now shorter, slower and better structured. He 
continually reworked them, remodeling until only the spirit remained, 
framed by a deceptively simple construction. This sound was to be the 
culmination of all his efforts. <br>
<br>
Being out of the studio for two years didn't handicap Springsteen's 
songwriting abilities. The problem was quite the opposite: choosing 
which of many songs should be included. His push towards the sound he 
needed eliminated many fine numbers. Some came out elsewhere. Southside 
Johnny and the Jukes received "Hearts of Stone" and "Talk to Me" for 
their third album, which came out after Darkness; Robert Gordon recorded
 "Fire" in early '78. More important was the collaboration with Patti 
Smith, "Because the Night." Since Springsteen engineer Jimmy Iovine 
produced the Smith record, it is no coincidence that its sound was a 
good indication of what Springsteen had been looking for. His words 
differed from hers a bit, though, concentrating more on the struggle 
than the escape: "What I've got I have earned/ What I'm not, baby, I 
have learned." <br>
<br>
Springsteen's reach back into his past established a clear definition of
 himself. Alienation from work, from others, from darkness, from 
something pervades all great rock; this theme cropped up throughout all 
the songs. "Outside Looking In" was recorded early on, a tune yelled out
 over Buddy Hollyish rolling drums; "Something in the Night" and "Don't 
Look Back" (knocked off the record so late it showed up in Phonolog 
listings) also shared this attitude. The enormous roar was often reduced
 to just a beat and a moan, but it was more than enough for the battles 
that Darkness depicted. Springsteen created a dramatic rock blues form, 
conveying hurt and, by sharing its burden, diffusing it and giving hope.
 Obsessions with the night, cars and the price one pays worked to his 
advantage. Just like blues, repetition widened its scope. <br>
<br>
When it came out in June, 1978, Darkness on the Edge of Town received a 
mixed reaction. Critics slammed it for the force of its integration of 
themes. Typical of the negative attitude towards the album were Mike 
Appel's comments in Melody Maker. He felt "personally insulted by it... 
it's as if he pandered to what he thought would be the audience's level 
of anticipation.... He hasn't gone any further than Born to Run, has 
he?" <br>
<br>
Though the critics' words stung a little, ultimately Darkness was mildly
 disappointing to Springsteen because it never communicated to its 
natural audience as deeply as it intended. A subsequent summer tour put 
the point across conclusively and totally vindicated all his musical 
ideas. <br>
<br>
The tour was monumental. Dates were constantly added, shows became 
longer and the pace got hotter. Rolling across the heartland, 
Springsteen and the E Street Band averaged three- hour shows five nights
 a week for over four months. His obligation to his audience extended to
 the famous four-hour soundcheck, in which he worked out the precise 
sound he wanted them to hear. Conceding to reality, Springsteen played 
many big halls and arenas, and his perfectionism insisted on the highest
 sound quality possible. The sound was indeed marvelous; the new, 
deliberate style stretched out perfectly onstage. <br>
<br>
Springsteen's belief in the Darkness material erased any doubts about 
playing in arenas. After some early rustiness and changes the show took 
on a basic shape: The Darkness songs appeared in the middle of the first
 set, finishing with "Racing in the Streets" which gained a more upbeat 
interpretation when it escalated into "Thunder Road." (The reason for 
this, Bruce told Philly DJ friend Ed Sciaky, was that "it's fulfilling. 
There's a stretch of songs that we do basically in the same order every 
night because... it makes connections and gives the rest of the show 
resonance.") The second set was always looser; it was if Springsteen 
said what he had to while the audience was still patient enough to 
listen. <br>
<br>
His choice of covers now hearked back to rock's earliest days, Jerry Lee
 Lewis, Eddie Cochran, Buddy Holly, even King Elvis were brought back to
 life with "Good Rockin' Tonight," "Heartbreak Hotel," "High School 
Confidential" and "Rave On," which was played full-tilt in L.A., a town 
notorious for faking Buddy Holly songs. Springsteen sometimes opened 
with "Summertime Blues" spilling into "Badlands"; by doing so, he 
embodied rock's past and present. <br>
<br>
Springsteen increasingly dedicated more of his own contributions to the 
spirit of that tradition. He performed "Fire," revived "The Fever" with a
 more muscular arrangement than the soulful studio rendering from 1973, 
and introduced two new summer tunes in old-fashioned styles. "Paradise 
by the Sea" was a fluid little instrumental with roller rink organ like 
so much early- '60s junk; "Cherie Darling" was his tribute to the 
records of the frat rockers, those great and silly discs were party 
noise ruled. The latter was based on a tempestuous relationship with an 
old girlfriend's mother: <br>
<br>
Your momma's gabbin' in the back seat Tell her to push over and move 
them big feet It's the last time that [spoken] gee, I gotta drag her 
over to the unemployment agency every Monday morning <br>
<br>
It was proof of a unique ability to write a roots song and still be true
 to his own vision. Only the Beatles could achieve the same, but their 
retrospective rockers would never have fit so easily into the era they 
emulated. <br>
<br>
While the additions to his live shows were simple and direct, some of 
the older numbers were broadened, reaching epic stature. "She's the One"
 started with either "Mona" or "Not Fade Away" hammering home the song's
 Bo Diddley beat and sometimes included a bit more - anything from 
"Gloria" to "Mickey's Monkey" to "Train Kept A'Rollin'." "Growin' Up" 
featured the elongated "direct to God" rap that ends Dave Marsh's book. <br>
<br>
"Backstreets" was the most deeply felt song, Springsteen's tormented 
vocal hitting an untoppable peak. Its middle section was part of the 
unreleased "Drive All Night," piano roaming along with the singer in his
 wandering thoughts about his girl. This trip ended like others, though:
 with a lie. As rumbling drums mirrored the rising anger of the betrayed
 lover, his repeated plea for an end to "those pretty lies" abruptly 
halted, and once more they went "hidin' on them backstreets tonight." <br>
<br>
After that painful journey, "Rosalita" burst forth, shattering in its 
power. Halfway through the tour a bass upswing plucked from Otis 
Redding's "I Can't Turn You Loose" became the foundation for an even 
greater extension of the crowd favorite. It set standards for balcony- 
shaking and roof-raising that may never be surpassed. <br>
<br>
The real suprise of the show, though, was "Prove It All Night." On 
record the song was simple and a little flat, but expanded in 
performance it became pure triumph. A rolling, squeaking guitar 
reminiscent of Neil Young's Zuma-era playing joined a lilting 
bass/drums/piano beat. The instruments rose up to reach the body of the 
song, made more dramatic by the guitar's expansiveness. As final shouts 
of "prove it all night" rebounded between Springsteen and his band, 
Danny Federici increased the tension with a stirring solo. Finally the 
guitar returned, dripping power chords as it reached apocalyptic fervor.
 Pete Townshend once described "Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere" as the sounds 
of war, chaos and frustration expressed musically; Springsteen's battle 
for inner space was fought out on the same turf. Morse-code piano 
tapping at the break relayed the message that Bruce Springsteen had 
broken through, that he could prove it all night. If the audience 
ascended with him, one helping the other in the liberating tradition of 
rock'n' roll, the night would end with "Twist and Shout," the first song
 Springsteen ever learned to play on the guitar. The circle was 
complete. <br>
<br>
Springsteen has maintained a low profile since then. 
Nineteen-seventy-eight ended with slightly anticlimactic tour of 
colleges and secondary markets. Only one new song worked its way in: 
"The Ties That Bind," a heavy favorite at one time to be the title for 
the upcoming album. Tapes to a red hot August show in Cleveland's Agora 
were mixed in the studio for possible use as a live record, an idea 
later scrapped. So Springsteen headed into New York's Power Station for 
his spring and summer vacations. <br>
<br>
As plans for a summertime release of "Cherie Darling"/Paradise by the 
Sea" fell by boards, Springsteen's only public work was at the MUSE 
shows in September at Madison Square Garden. He introduced "The River" 
there; along with "Thunder Road" and perennial encore "Quater to Three,"
 it can be seen in the recent No Nukes film. A tour pending completion 
of the LP was booked solid for late fall and early winter, but had to be
 canceled as his indecision grew. In mid-April he took off to LA to mix 
the record; at press time he was still plugging away at it. <br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen's history has shown that his greatest talent, a rock 
intuition second to none, is often at odds with a relentless sense of 
perfection. After Darkness he told a Boston newspaper that he was past 
the obsessively self-critical stage: "No more, hey, is this perfect? 
Just let me do it." Yet the time spent making his fifth record proves 
that idea wrong. <br>
<br>
All of rock's greats reach a point where they spend more time off the 
road than on, entrenched in the recording studio. Self-indulgent 
staleness sets in when live work is not interspersed meaningfully, 
enabling the artist to test out material live. Creating rock and then 
palying it to an audience has proven to be dangerous to creativity and 
communication. <br>
<br>
If anyone can beat this seemingly inevitable flatness and loss of 
energy, it is Springsteen. His vision and continuing feel for his past 
have kept him one step ahead of fans, many of whom would want to make 
him an Elvis for the '80s, and critics, who cannot keep pace with his 
ability to change. A return to alternating studio and stage chores would
 definitely eliminate any chance that his art might decline; as it 
stands, his past seems a good guarantee that he'll play a continuing 
role in any "rock and roll future."</div>
