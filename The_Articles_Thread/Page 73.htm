 at the Air Canada Centre, Tuesday, February 2.<br>
<br>
BY CARLA GILLIS<br>
 FEBRUARY 3, 2016<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen specializes in heart-busting, big-life-moment songs 
told from the perspective of someone who knows time is short so you 
better make every second – and every song – count.<br>
Also every concert.<br>
The iconic New Jersey heartland rocker gave us over three hours of total
 passion and commitment at the Air Canada Centre, in support of his The 
Ties That Bind: The River Collection box set, which celebrates the 35th 
anniversary of 1980’s The River, a four-album effort that he and his 
nine-piece E Street Band played front to back. <br>
<br>
The final chords of one song barely finished ringing out before The 
Boss, looking lean, tanned and handsome in hues of black and grey (and 
his trademark jeans), counted in the next one with gusto.<br>
Occasionally he offered up an intro. Independence Day, he said, was 
about being stunned by the discovery of your parents’ humanity, of 
realizing for the first time that they once had dreams of their own. 
“It’s a song about adult compromises,” he said, “and the blessings those
 compromises brought.”<br>
Uplift immediately returned with the familiar opening notes of Hungry 
Heart, especially when he held back for the first verse and let us sing 
it on our own.<br>
The continued push-pull between serious and fun, between dark and light,
 between sprawling "compositions" and lighter-weight fare – Crush On 
You, You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch) – was hugely satisfying. <br>
And after so many Behind The Music-type rock band documentaries, it was 
great to see seemingly genuine playfulness among the musicians onstage, 
many of whom have been in the E Street Band since the 70s and 80s. With 
drummer Max Weinberg and bassist Garry Tallent holding down a steady 
backbeat, the others harmonized and soloed and did cute little moves in 
sync.<br>
Blazing saxophone is as fundamental to Springsteen’s sound as lonesome 
harmonica, and Jake Clemons, nephew of deceased E Street member Clarence
 Clemons, captivated, especially on an epic rendition of The Price You 
Pay, one of the set’s standout numbers. Guitarists Patti Scialfa and 
Little Steven Van Zandt turned out powerful harmonies all night, often 
sharing the centre mic with Springsteen and appearing on the Jumbo 
screens.<br>
Crowd interaction was also high. Springsteen regularly left the singing 
to us, lighters came out during gorgeously melancholy The River, and an 
89-year-old woman celebrating her birthday got the chance to waltz with 
The Boss during Dancing In The Dark during the greatest-hits portion of 
the set as her elated daughter looked on.<br>
Despite the concert already being two hours deep by that point, it was 
that greatest hits section that offered up some of the most energetic 
moments.<br>
The Promised Land (requested via a sign held high) hit hard. Patti Smith
 Group’s Because The Night, which Smith co-wrote with Springsteen, was a
 mind-blowing surprise, his version more triumphant than Smith’s during 
her last few visits to Toronto and featuring a dazzling, almost 
comically lengthy guitar solo by Nils Lofgren that ended with him 
shredding while spinning around and around in a spotlight. <br>
Bridge In Disguise was gorgeous, with a slightly changed chorus melody. 
The crowd lost its mind during Badlands, Born To Run and the 
aforementioned Dancing In The Dark.<br>
We hit the three-hour mark. “Are you ready to continue?” Springsteen shouted. “Are you ready to continue?”<br>
Ready or not, he gave us Rosalita and a cover of the Isley Brothers’ 
Shout, which he repeatedly extended in an almost compulsive way. "I’m 
just a prisoner of rock and roll!" he shouted, almost apologetically</div>

<br>
"The next opening I have, we'll slot it in and get it out," says Springsteen of next album<br>
<br>
 BY DAVID FRICKE<br>
February 3, 2016<br>
<br>
"We'll have to see how everybody feels, how the show feels," Bruce 
Springsteen said, lounging on a sofa in his dressing room backstage at 
the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh. The singer was speaking the 
night before he opened his 2016 North American tour with the E Street 
Band, on January 16th in Pittsburgh. He had just come off stage from a 
three-hour rehearsal in which he drilled his group, one more time, 
through Sides Three and Four of the centerpiece of the current shows — a
 complete, nightly performance of Springsteen's 1980 double album, The 
River. Looking improbably relaxed after that long, intense practice, 
Springsteen, 66, was responding to a question about whether he would add
 more dates past the originally scheduled finale in Los Angeles on March
 17th.<br>
<br>
<br>
How Bruce Springsteen Got Back to 'The River' »<br>
"I have an idea of what it's going to be like," Springsteen said of the 
next evening's planned marathon — that whole record plus another "set 
after the set," as he put it, of hits and deep tracks. "But I'm anxious 
to feel it."<br>
<br>
Springsteen found out soon enough, setting a repeatedly explosive 
standard in Pittsburgh with 34 songs over three hours and 17 minutes. 
Two weeks later, after a similar epic show in Chicago and a few hours 
before raising the roof at New York's Madison Square Garden, Springsteen
 announced an extension of the tour into late April, with a May 19th 
festival date in Lisbon, Portugal, suggesting a run of European stadium 
gigs in the summer.<br>
<br>
<br>
That evening backstage in Pittsburgh, during a wide-ranging interview 
for a story in the current issue of Rolling Stone, Springsteen spoke of 
his sudden eagerness to take The River on the road, in the wake of the 
recent multi-disc reissue, The Ties That Bind: The River Collection 
(Columbia); and of the much-younger man who made the original album, 
from the impulsive mass of songwriting resurrected in that box. He also 
confirmed his completion of a solo album nearly four years in the making
 — and admitted that it was unusual for him to be back on the road with 
the E Street Band with such a focused, retrospective show. But, 
Springsteen insisted, "At this point, the old blueprints don't have to 
be followed. We're presenting this record to people. And it'll find its 
spot."<br>
<br>
Is there any material from the River era — unheard songs or performances
 — still waiting around to be heard, that isn't in the box set?    <br>
<br>
The box cleared out everything that was listenable. There might have 
been some curiosities. When we put these boxes out, I discount those 
things where the only interest is "This happened" [laughs]. I don't go 
for the multiple outtakes. I go for something that had a reason for 
living, came to life, didn't get used but is a thriving entity of its 
own.<br>
<br>
Were you writing literally everyday on the way to The River? That record almost forced itself to become a double album.<br>
You have to understand: You're writing in a panic, right? Because you 
don't have a record, which is a very anxious and unsettled feeling. 
While it's a feeling you have to get used to when you're a record maker,
 it never loses its unpleasantness: "Is it going to happen? Are all the 
pieces gonna fit? Is it going to come to life?" You don't know until it 
does.<br>
<br>
And as the leader, you're responsible for the band eating. There is an economic obligation as well.<br>
You're spending money in the studio, certainly at that time. We spent 
everything we had. When the record finally came out, we were down to 
peanuts. The only thing you have to go on is some vague notion of an 
aesthetic, an idea, something you want to accomplish, not knowing 
exactly what it is. All I knew was I wanted it to have scope, to have 
size. I wanted it to appeal to all the different parts of what we did. I
 had the parameters. I didn't have the working parts.<br>
<br>
Why did you pull that early, unreleased sequence, The Ties That Bind?<br>
It didn't seem like enough. It was a nice 10-song record.<br>
<br>
Was it lightweight?<br>
I enjoy listening to it now. It didn't have the complexity that the later record had.<br>
<br>
Just listening to Side Three in rehearsal today, The River goes from 
"Point Blank" to "Cadillac Ranch" and "I'm a Rocker" — that's a lot of 
emotional and physical ground, where [1978's] Darkness on the Edge of 
Town was more intensely focused.<br>
<br>
<br>
Darkness was a one-track mind. It was austere. Everything else was 
stripped away. Some of the songs that got on The River — "Sherry 
Darling," "Independence Day" — I originally had for Darkness on the Edge
 of Town.<br>
<br>
We had a couple of goals for The River. One was to make a record that 
felt like a show. So there were character studies. There was bar-band 
music. It went from being ridiculous and joyous to heart-numbing. I 
thought, "This is what I like. I like both of these things." I always 
struggled to fit it on a single album. "This time, let's make a record 
that's like the show." It had to be a double album.<br>
<br>
This is the first time in my memory that you have gone out with a tour 
that is a set piece. You've done full performances of other albums, but 
you called those on the night. This is a theatrical presentation.<br>
<br>
<br>
The size of the record doesn't make it a casual undertaking. And it's a 
funny record. It ends on a strange note with "Wreck on the Highway," 
where it's just a guy and his thoughts [laughs]. That's all there is. 
The album starts with the pursuit of connection and community, the 
desire to find out where you fit in, and ends up with this guy in a 
bedroom with the person he loves and his thoughts.<br>
<br>
Does it feel strange to be going out on a major tour without new music? 
Most of your tours since you reunited the E Street Band in 1999 have 
been tied to a new album and that album's point of view.<br>
<br>
At this point, we have so much music behind us that we don't need to 
restrict ourselves to that formula. I want to be able to say, "Maybe we 
should go out and play 20 shows, 40 shows, 60 shows — or 10 shows. Just 
let the band play." We've passed the point where we need a release to 
justify going out and performing. I want to break that cycle, whatever 
it is. Just go out, play your music and see what develops. The box set 
gave us an opportunity to put that in practice.<br>
<br>
Plus, the record I was working on was a solo record. I was probably 
gonna go out and perform it on my own. Given that amount of time, I 
thought, "That means the band won't play again for two-and-a-half, three
 years. I didn't want that amount of time to pass without the band 
performing together. It will be two years in May since the last time. At
 this point in my life, I want to have the freedom to say, "You want to 
play? Let's book some shows."<br>
<br>
I noticed that the itinerary for this tour has two, sometimes three off 
days between shows. Is that a concession to age and the physical stress 
of doing such a long show — how much it takes to recover from one of 
these nights?<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't think it was a factor. I didn't book the shows [grins].<br>
<br>
You just show up?<br>
<br>
<br>
[Laughs] Basically. Our average has been three-and-a-half shows a week. 
And with this show, we're pressing the three-hour mark. It's just 
comfort, I suppose. You don't want to burn your voice out. You want to 
give your best every night.<br>
<br>
But there is the fact that age comes to everyone. How do you decide when
 you can't do something at the pace and intensity you set in your 
twenties and thirties? You don't want people to come with better 
memories than they leave with at the end of the night.<br>
<br>
<br>
You not only have to be better than you were. You have to be better than
 what people remember you did [laughs], which is tough. Somebody will be
 like, "I saw you back in '76 at Blah-Blah-Blah College. That was the 
greatest show I ever saw." Maybe it was. Maybe it wasn't. But it's 
remembered that way.<br>
<br>
I don't have a problem with that. We stand toe-to-toe with any version 
of our band that's been out there. It's a richer experience now because 
there is so much material to draw from. And that shared history you have
 with people makes the night very full, very beautiful.<br>
<br>
One thing I noticed as you rehearsed the set that comes after you finish
 The River — the mix of "Badlands," "Wrecking Ball," "Backstreets" and 
"The Rising" — was that despite the people who often say, "I like the 
old stuff better than the new stuff," it is all cut from the same 
emotional and topical timber.<br>
<br>
<br>
The past decade, we've made a lot of good music. For my money, the best 
of it can stand with the best of what I've done. And the test of it is 
on stage. One problem I had in the late Nineties, when I was hesitant to
 use the band again — I didn't know if I could write successfully for 
the band again, if I could write material that made sense of the band's 
existence.<br>
<br>
But I feel like I did that — "American Skin (41 Shots)," "Land of Hope 
and Dreams," "The Rising," "Lonesome Day," "Wrecking Ball." Those were 
all extensions of the great music we made in the past. And they carried 
enough impact and weight to move us into the future. It's been a great 
gift to us over the past 10 years. We've had a lot of great new material
 to draw on, and it's made for a lot of good shows.<br>
<br>
How long have you been working on this new solo album?<br>
<br>
<br>
It was the record I started before [2012's] Wrecking Ball. I've been 
making it for a long time. I went back to it after [2014's] High Hopes. I
 finished it at the beginning of the summer [last year].<br>
<br>
When do you plan on putting it out?<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't know. I'm just sitting on it right now. I want to play with the 
band a bit, enjoy that. The next opening I have, we'll slot it in and 
get it out. It's unusual to have a record that you're sitting on.<br>
<br>
Are you writing for the E Street Band now?<br>
<br>
<br>
No. I just finished that batch of material [on the new album]. At the moment, I'm on writing hiatus.<br>
<br>
What is the thing that gets you started?<br>
<br>
<br>
Writing is like being hungry. It's a drive — a primal drive. It's not 
anything else. When it's there, you do it. Usually, you're trying to 
figure something out, make sense of some part of your life, something 
you're seeing, something you're experiencing, the world. "Wow, I need to
 contextualize this experience." That's when the hunger comes up, and 
you find yourself searching, searching, searching. That's when songs 
tend to come.<br>
<br>
That was something that I kept thinking about David Bowie and his 
passing this week. In spite of his ill health, which we know about now, 
he continued to work and made one of his greatest records [Blackstar] at
 the very end of his life.<br>
<br>
<br>
[Sighs] It's incredible, an amazing accomplishment. It takes a lot of 
strength. Warren Zevon made a record under those circumstances [The 
Wind, issued two weeks before his death from cancer in September 2003]. I
 was in the studio a little bit with him, and he was driven. A big part 
of his struggle was to make this music. I don't know if I could do that.
 It's a feat of strength.<br>
<br>
That you are still out there, playing shows like this — do you sometimes feel like you're pushing your luck?<br>
[Laughs heartily] You're pushing your luck, pal! [Keeps laughing]<br>
<br>
Maybe that was the wrong phrase, but there is challenge in there. When 
you were a young man, 66 was considered old. It was when you retired.<br>
<br>
Totally! [Still laughing] It's different when you get there, man. 
Sixty-six never felt so good. You have to be concerned about things — 
and you just go ahead. What else are you gonna do?<br>
<br>
Yet this is an unusually reflective tour, based on an entire album of songs you wrote at a turning point in your life.<br>
<br>
If you wrote them well, they sustain. Not only do they sustain, they 
grow and find their current context. That's what I'm hoping for on this 
tour, that the music finds its life in the here-and-now. Hopefully, it's
 a restorative to some of the ugliness and demagoguery that's been out 
there. That would be wonderful. I'd go home a happy player.<br>
<br>
Are you going to miss calling audibles on stage — taking requests from fans and testing the band?<br>
<br>
I'm looking for a relief from it, actually. It will be a nice break. As 
we go, it might happen in the set after the set. But The River is almost
 a fans' record, in the sense that it has a lot of things tucked down 
inside of it — "Stolen Car," "Jackson Cage," things that aren't 
necessarily on the first list of songs fans may mention as the things 
they remember you for. That's why I came up with the set after the set —
 the things the broad audience knows. The River is a little off to the 
left. That part of the show is for the people who dug all of the little 
corners of that record, who look forward to hearing "Fade Away" or 
"Independence Day," things we don't regularly play anymore.<br>
<br>
<br>
When did you realize, after compiling that first sequence, The Ties That Bind, that the album needed to be a bigger document?<br>
<br>
It was a group of songs that I really liked that I would have normally 
cut [from an album], like "Cadillac Ranch" and "Out in the Street" ­— 
things that were great bar-band music but that I would have cut if I 
only had a 10-song album. Those songs were pooling, collecting — "God, 
I'd really like to get all of that on." There's quite a few ballads. 
This show will have more ballads than any show we've ever done in a long
 time. "The River," "Drive All Night," "Wreck on the Highway" — half of 
the record is ballads. So you have to wrestle the other stuff in 
between.<br>
<br>
That last 12 minutes on Side Four — "Drive All Night" and "Wreck on the 
Highway" — is a long stretch of quiet, maybe the longest on any of your 
albums.<br>
It's the summation of the record, these two very quiet numbers. [Pauses 
thoughtfully] It will be fun tomorrow night, seeing what happens .<br>
<br>
Actually, if I can make a request, it would be the outtake "Held Up 
Without a Gun." It's only a minute and 10 seconds long, so it won't add 
too much to the set.<br>
[Laughs] It's only a minute and 10! That's right. It got onto ...<br>
<br>
<br>
The B-side of the "Hungry Heart" single.<br>
That's right. [Laughs] Yeah, it was a good one.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">For Springsteen at the Garden, ‘The River’ rolls on<br>
By Sarah Rodman <br>
Boston Globe Staff <br>
February 05, 2016</strong><br>
<br>
Even by their own typically Herculean standards, the performance given 
by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band at the TD Garden on Thursday 
night was legions above and beyond the normal concert experience.<br>
<br>
If someone had been magically transported from outside the building onto
 the arena floor around the halfway point of the maniacally spirited 
version of “Rosalita,” they never would’ve guessed by the posture, 
expression, or energy level of any of the band members — and most of the
 sold-out crowd, for that matter — that the concert had just hit the 
three-hour mark, with 20 more jubilant minutes still to come.<br>
<br>
It seemed clear that the decision to play the entirety of his 1980 
double-album “The River” — in connection with a recently released boxed 
set — has injected the already indefatigable Springsteen and his merry 
band with a jolt of powerful electricity. In many ways it’s a perfect 
album (albeit a lengthy one at 85 minutes) for this treatment, thanks to
 its variety of tones, and provides an opportunity to play both big hits
 adored by the casual crowd and also underplayed — and underrated — 
deeper cuts beloved by diehards.<br>
<br>
From the giddy crowd-surfing highs of “Hungry Heart” to the moody, 
noir-ish narrative beauty of “Point Blank,” the clutch of bar-band 
rave-ups like “Cadillac Ranch” and “Ramrod,” and the always gutting 
disillusion of the classic title track, “The River” proved a spectacular
 first set. There were breakneck rockers and contemplative moments that 
served as breathers but, remarkably, not as lulls.<br>
<br>
Between a few of the tunes, the New Jersey rocker — who was in 
tremendous voice and spirits all night — talked a bit about the ideas 
behind some of the songs. One particularly moving revelation came before
 the aching ballad “Independence Day,” when he discussed the moment a 
young adult recogizes the humanity of her or his parents, the hopes and 
dreams they might have had, and the compromises they made.<br>
<br>
Of course, the testifying, speechifying, rock ‘n’ roll evangelizing 
Springsteen was in the house as well, exhorting the crowd of 16,654 to 
let loose. The post-“River” set featured a barrage of big hits and fan 
favorites: sing-along staples “Born to Run,” “Thunder Road,” “Badlands,”
 and “Dancing in the Dark,” alongside a few surprises like the rare 
“Roulette” that allowed them to do just that, and raised the energy 
level even higher.<br>
<br>
As usual, Springsteen interacted playfully with his band members all 
night, sparring around the microphone with foil Steven Van Zandt, 
watching as guitarist Nils Lofgren literally spun his way through a 
frenetic “Because the Night,” and swaying with guitarist-vocalist (and 
wife) Patti Scialfa, who was particularly great on an 
intimate-yet-rocking version of “Human Touch.”<br>
<br>
J. Geils Band frontman Peter Wolf got into the action on a wild and 
woolly take of the Isley Brothers’ “Shout” that brought the night to a 
raucous close, but you got the sense that if it had been allowed, the 
band would’ve kept right on playing.</div>

<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
Rolling Stone<br>
By David Fricke <br>
February 9, 2016</strong><br>
<br>
"The River is my summer record," Max Weinberg said between sips of a 
cocktail in a hotel bar in Pittsburgh — the drummer's reward after three
 hours onstage earlier in the evening at the Consol Energy Center, the 
night before Bruce Springsteen opened his 2016 tour with the E Street 
Band there on January 16th.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Weinberg — the backbeat in the E Street Band since the fall of 1974 — is
 now performing The River every night, in its entirety, as Springsteen 
follows the December release of the multi-disc retrospective, The Ties 
That Bind: The River Collection (Columbia), with thorough, passionate 
live reexaminations of the 20 songs on that record, a personal 
crossroads that became the singer's first double album and first Number 
One hit. "I'm the white line down the center of the road," Weinberg 
said, summing up his role in these concerts. "My job is to be observant,
 to make the transitions, to focus on what Bruce is doing — to be as 
commanding a percussive force as I can be, so he has the freedom to go 
where he wants to go."<br>
<br>
After that rehearsal and an immediate interview with Springsteen, I 
joined Weinberg that evening for a drink and a second hour of spirited 
conversation. Weinberg, who turns 65 in April, spoke about the birth of 
The River in rigorous practice sessions at Springsteen's home; a 
"tough-love" moment with Springsteen, during the recording, that changed
 Weinberg as a drummer; other motivating counsel from the album's 
co-producers, Jon Landau and E Street guitarist Steven Van Zandt; 
Weinberg's memories of the late E Street men Danny Federici and Clarence
 Clemons as he revisits The River; and his trust in Springsteen, at this
 advanced point in the E Street Band's life, to know when it's time to 
walk off the stage for good.<br>
<br>
At one point, Weinberg pointed out that on the following night, as he 
was opening with Springsteen in Pittsburgh, his drummer-son Jay, 25, 
would be starting a European tour with Slipknot in Helsinki. "I keep 
telling him, 'Don't headbang,'" Max said, laughing. "He did it a couple 
of weeks ago, and his head hurts. I said, 'Learn from my experience.' <br>
<br>
"I beat up my body physically when I was younger," Weinberg went on. 
"Look at the Tempe, Arizona show" — the fabled, epic 1980 concert 
included, on DVD and Blu-ray, in The Ties That Bind. "You can see it. 
But I have figured out a way to do it now — with energy, focus, 
excitement and enthusiasm."<br>
<br>
At 30-plus songs over three hours and more, this is a demanding show. 
Was it hard to get the muscles and memory in shape, especially after a 
substantial break from the road?<br>
They come back fairly quickly. I spend a lot of my time, when not 
touring, working out aerobically, so my endurance is actually pretty 
good. You get shocked back into it — a little. We all do. But that's the
 beauty of it — the memory is still there. I've done this, in my case, 
for 42 years. The memory of how to do it — why you do it — is still 
there.<br>
<br>
Did the River songs come back automatically? Many of those songs have been out of the live shows for years.<br>
<br>
I listened quite a bit to The River before the tour. I was playing a lot
 of drums on that record. Through the years, particularly when we got 
into stadiums, I streamlined a lot of stuff. As a drummer, you have to 
make the parts more direct, eliminate things. But I've injected some of 
that youthful, manic energy back into these renditions. The outtakes 
from The River — I hadn't heard them in awhile. They brought me back.<br>
<br>
And I made a bunch of rehearsal tapes at the time. So I did remember 
things like "The Man Who Got Away" and "Night Fire" — "Yeah, I remember 
playing that." We have gone through a couple of those things informally,
 in rehearsal. But they were done in a different style. And we never 
played those live.<br>
<br>
Of course, it's Bruce's decision if he wants to play them or not. We 
will certainly be ready for anything — which is the hallmark of the E 
Street Band and the most precious thing about it. I do a lot of gigs 
with other groups. I have a 23-piece dance band, a classic society-dance
 band at the Rainbow Room [in New York City]. I don't drum — I lead the 
band up front. Everything is charted and arranged. Leading that is like 
moving the Queen Mary, whereas the E Street Band is quite fleet in terms
 of reacting to whatever Bruce wants to do.<br>
<br>
This tour is the first I can remember in which you play such a firmly 
structured set — the whole of "The River." Still, there are differences 
from the record. There was one today, in rehearsal — Roy Bittan's 
extended piano intro to "Point Blank."<br>
That's from the 1980 concert in Tempe. You remember things like that. 
When I listen to these songs, I think of Danny and Clarence a lot, the 
parts they played. There was a thing Clarence did in "Point Blank," in 
the fifth bar of the piano introduction, with a bell tree [makes a 
ringing noise]. As soon as I heard that, watching the Tempe video, it 
reminded me of Clarence.<br>
<br>
I love the set pieces in a show like this. You get into a frame of mind —
 the totality of the narrative, these characters. It's different from 
playing different songs every night. On the last tour, we'd play 25, 26 
songs and 15 of those would be "audibles." You never know what was 
coming. But before I went with Bruce, I was playing on Broadway for two 
years in Godspell. That's the same thing every night. The challenge is 
to view it with enthusiasm. And that's one of the things the E Street 
Band is particularly good at.<br>
<br>
<br>
What are your memories of the creative buildup to The River and the making of that album?<br>
<br>
I got married when we were doing that tour, in June of '81. I hear 
"Ramrod" or "Out in the Street," and it puts me in a great frame of 
mind, what I was feeling then. I always appreciated it when Bruce put 
the lyrics on the album [cover]. Because I always go for the stories. 
The story led me to what I would play on the drums.<br>
<br>
I remember Steven [Van Zandt] and Bruce pushing me to play more like 
Keith Moon — really drum, where my normal inclination would be to play 
more like Ringo Starr. I embraced that if you listen to some of the 
outtakes like "Mary Lou." That is my version of the Who's "I Can See For
 Miles."<br>
<br>
In our conversation, Bruce spoke of the differences between Born to Run 
and Darkness on the Edge of Town — what he called "outsider" records — 
and the focus on intimacy and relationships on The River.<br>
As narrow as it might have become, that focus was more universal. He was
 turning 30. I was 28. I was getting married. Clarence and Danny had 
been married but weren't married at the time. I remember breaking the 
news to Bruce. We were, as a band, together 24-7. And it was like 
wedding bells were breaking up that old gang of mine. It didn't really 
do that. But that was a big step.<br>
<br>
How firm were the arrangements of the River songs when you recorded 
them? Did you work them out in the studio or drill them ahead of time?<br>
<br>
The River stuff was so arranged, well thought out in rehearsal and in 
the studio. There was a lot of attention to detail. This was a period of
 real, personal growth for me as a drummer. I can hear myself grow up 
from [the outtake] "Roulette," which was the first song we recorded, to 
"The River," which was the last song we recorded. I can hear myself 
mature over those 19 months, with unique motivation from Bruce.<br>
<br>
What did he say?<br>
<br>
Our modus operandi in the studio was to literally play thngs 30 or 40 
times. To maintain your focus over 20, 30 takes, as a drummer, is next 
to impossible. I had to make the transition from being a young, 
talented, energetic drummer to grasping the true role of the 
professional. The instruction from Bruce was, basically, "Talk to the 
guys you admire. Find out how they do it." It was a little more forceful
 than that [grins].<br>
<br>
It was a wake-up call. It was during the recording of "Out in the 
Street." He took me down the hallway, and we had a face-to-face. Three 
minutes. Then we went right back in and recorded [the B-side] "Be True."
 Immediately, I was 60 percent better. What he transmitted to me was a 
little bit of tough love: "I know you can do this. I believe in you. You
 need to apply yourself."<br>
<br>
Could you see The River taking coherent shape as Bruce kept bringing in new songs?<br>
<br>
We had a routine. We hooked up in the studio around six or seven at 
night, then go to five in the morning, five days a week. We'd record 
"Wreck on the Highway" and "Ramrod," or "Stolen Car" and then "Crush on 
You." So your head was flying. It was a cornucopia of different things. 
He was trying to get that mood — the narrative of the characters — but 
also songs that were fun to play, bar-band rave-up songs.<br>
<br>
When I listen to the album now, I can see little motifs I did in every 
song. There's a thing I did in [the outtake] "Meet Me in the City 
Tonight." [Makes drum-roll sound] I do a variation of it in at least 
half a dozen songs. It's like a rhythmic theme. Bruce has talked about 
the yin and yang of Steven and Jon [Landau] as producers. Steve was 
always pushing me to play more flamboyantly. Jon was more about the 
playing on "The River" — focused and direct, serving the story à la [the
 Muscle Shoals drummer] Roger Hawkins and Al Jackson [of Booker T. and 
the MG's]. So on one hand, I'm playing these songs like Ginger Baker and
 Keith Moon — and in this other way.<br>
<br>
But we did everything live in the studio, all of us playing at the same 
time. It was almost direct-to-disc. If there was a mistake, we stopped 
and started again.<br>
<br>
In that sense, you are performing The River now exactly as you recorded it.<br>
<br>
Absolutely. We did every record live in the studio, certainly every 
record of that period — Born to Run, Darkness, The River, Born in the 
U.S.A. It was always the rhythm section and Bruce playing live.<br>
<br>
Despite Bruce's legendary perfectionist streak in the studio then, you 
were always left with the actual physical, bonding experience of a band 
playing live.<br>
I've always read that Bruce is a perfectionist. But it was more like 
"You keep writing until you get what makes sense." We would listen to 
takes. You knew it when you had it. For him, it was very tortorous. He's
 writing the stuff. If you listen to "Be True," there are another 
half-dozen songs that are outtakes with those lyrics. They show up in 
other songs, in different iterations.<br>
<br>
We rehearsed at his house to the point where he was comfortable enough 
to go into the studio. I remember getting a phone call at nine o'clock 
in the morning to go to his house. He had written this song overnight — 
"Roulette" — and he air-drummed the tom-tom thing to me. The way he was 
doing it — a drummer would never play it that way. But he was very 
specific [makes drum-pattern noise]. We went into the studio and cut it 
that night. Things were bopping fast.<br>
<br>
You are performing The River every night 36 years after it came out — 
that's three or four lifetimes for most bands. Do you ever wonder how 
much longer you can tour and perform at this level? Or do you trust 
Bruce to know when that is?<br>
I totally trust Bruce. I don't think about it. Everybody up there has a 
committment. And we are in uncharted territory. There are older bands, 
but there aren't many that play with our intensity and energy. I know 
that I can play that way. I had a serious bout of cancer. I had massive 
open-heart surgery. I've got aches and pains. But I'll keep going 
because that's what I do. I will personally figure out a way to do it. 
And I believe Bruce will too.<br>
<br>
We are that generation of rockers that came up being a bar band. We were
 never a pop band, playing for a half-hour. The long shows, the 
longevity of the night — that's very direct for us. Charlie Watts says 
he was always fine with the Rolling Stones playing for 40 minutes in the
 Sixties. Then Led Zeppelin came along and totally ruined it for the 
Stones. They had to play for two-and-a-half hours, and it changed the 
way the Stones approached things. <br>
<br>
We always did that. I don't look at it as three hours. I take it song by
 song, beat by beat. I'm focused, and I don't leave anything on the 
stage. Bruce taught me that.<br>
<br>
At this point, it's not about youthful energy. It's all about willpower.
 And I know I have the will. When I'm at home, I do a strenuous workout 
four times a week. Because I'm thinking, in the back of my mind, I may 
get a call from Bruce Springsteen. And I'd better be ready.</div>

Springsteen delivers marathon album with mighty marathon concert<br>
By Greg Haymes <br>
Albany Times Union<br>
February 9, 2016</strong><br>
<br>
Rolling into the Times Union Center on Monday night in support of their 
mammoth "The Ties That Bind: The River Collection," a whopping 
seven-disc comprehensive look at the era of the 1980 double-album, "The 
River," Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band took the stage at 8 
p.m. and steamrolled through a 3½ hour set of 34 songs. It was an 
exhausting, Herculean effort, both for the band and for the sold-out, 
jam-packed crowd.<br>
<br>
It was also richly rewarding, as the first two hours featured a 
song-by-song performance of "The River," followed by a 90-minute tear 
through a cherry-picked selection of greatest hits that included 
"Badlands," "Backstreets," "Thunder Road," "Born to Run," an 
electrifying "Rosalita" and more.<br>
<br>
"Are you ready to be entertained?" he asked the crowd at the start of the show. "Are you ready to be transformed?<br>
"Come along with us as we go down to the river..."<br>
<br>
With a pared-back, eight-piece band behind him (minus the horn section 
and back-up singers that accompanied him at his last stop at the 
downtown arena in May of 2014), the 66-year-old Springsteen explained 
that "The River" was "my coming of age record." Of course, he and the 
boys (and guitarist-violinist Soozie Tyrell) can still kick the stuffing
 out of the arena-ready party anthems – "I'm a Rocker," "Crush On You" 
and the Coasters-esque "You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)." And 
soul-strolls like "Fade Away" and "I Wanna Marry You" (which he 
described as "a young man's song, a daydream") still tugged at the 
heart.<br>
<br>
But it was the back-to-back pairing of the album's title song (with 
Tyrell on violin, Nils Lofgren on steel guitar and the Boss' consigliere
 Steve Van Zandt on 12-string guitar) with "Point Blank" that cut the 
deepest, not only brimming over with narrative drama, but resonating the
 most from the perspective of age?<br>

<br>
Despite the four-guitar army up front, "Because the Night" was driven by
 Roy Bittan at his white Yamaha grand piano – at least until Lofgren 
uncorked the best guitar solo of the night. And saxman Jake Clemmons 
played with impressive confidence and power throughout the evening, 
swooping in on his solos like a hawk.<br>
By the time Springsteen &amp; Co. wrapped things up with a joyous, unbridled stomp through the Isley Brothers.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen's 'The River': Steven Van Zandt Looks Back<br>
<br>
David Fricke<br>
Rolling Stone<br>
February 13 2016</strong><br>
<br>
"This tour is a bit of a miracle, really," says E Street Band guitarist of current run celebrating 1980 double LP<br>
<br>
<br>
"I don't think this existed six weeks ago," Steven Van Zandt said, 
chuckling to himself, over a late lunch of salad and tea a few hours 
before showtime on January 16th, the day Bruce Springsteen and the E 
Street Band opened their unexpected 2016 tour in Pittsburgh. "It wasn't 
'Maybe it's gonna happen, let's get ready,'" the guitarist went on. "It 
was Bruce putting out this box set and thinking, 'Maybe we should do a 
show or two.' When I heard that, I was like, 'Wait a minute. We're not 
playing a residency at the Stone Pony anymore. Assembling 160 people to 
do a show or two — that's complicated.' I thought, 'If that happens, it 
could well turn out to be more' — which is what happened."<br>
<br>
Van Zandt has played with Springsteen and been a consistent, trusted 
confidant longer than anyone else in the E Street Band — that is from 
the very beginning, in the mid-Sixties, when the two were New Jersey 
teenage misfits mutually determined to make their futures in rock &amp; 
roll. "This year will make it 50 years," Van Zandt, 65, claimed proudly 
of their bond. But even Van Zandt was taken by surprise when Springsteen
 — a week before the December release of The Ties That Bind: The River 
Collection (Columbia), a multi-disc reflection on the prolific 
turbulence that became his 1980 double LP, The River — suddenly called 
his band to order for a tour that is already in its second month, 
features nightly performances of that entire album and is now set to run
 into the summer.<br>
<br>
"I've known him longer than anybody, and he just doesn't think the same 
way everyone else thinks," Van Zandt said of Springsteen. "He's earned 
the right to have total freedom. He wants to keep his life wide open, 
and that's great. Occasionally it's going to be a problem. I was very 
lucky with The Sopranos," Van Zandt noted, referring to his breakout 
television role as wise guy Silvio Dante in that HBO series. The show's 
creator David Chase "was such a fan — he would book all my scenes on off
 days during a tour."<br>
<br>
Van Zandt said he has long "fantasized" that the E Street Band — which 
last toured with Springsteen in the spring of 2014 — could hit the road 
more regularly, "six months, same time, then do other stuff. It's never 
happened." Springsteen, he conceded, "doesn't play by the rules of 
career. I mean, look at the marketing." Van Zandt laughs. "Which is 
zero. If anyone else tried to have a career with no marketing ... " 
There is a pause, then more laughter. "But he's managed to come all this
 way, bigger than ever. This is the most successful tour we've done here
 in a long time. So from his point of view, why fix what ain't broke?"<br>
<br>
In this last installment of conversations from the first weekend of the 
2016 River tour, for more than hour before Van Zandt departed for 
soundcheck (including a run-through of "Rebel Rebel," Springsteen's 
tribute that night to David Bowie), the guitarist affirmed many of the 
themes from my interviews the day before with Springsteen and drummer 
Max Weinberg: the narrative transformation in Springsteen's writing for 
The River and the torrent of songs from which he eventually built the 
final 20-song album; the dizzying momentum of the sessions; the 
invigorating element of discovery in the current shows, as Springsteen 
and his band play that record live each night.<br>
<br>
Van Zandt also spoke about The River and its resonance from his unique 
perspective as the album's often frustrated co-producer; as a super fan 
of the two dozen songs that got left behind; and as a true believer, to 
this day, in Springsteen's determined, idealistic course. Asked about 
future of the E Street Band — how soon they'll know how long is too long
 — Van Zandt was as blunt and certain as his friend and leader. "There 
is no end in sight," the guitarist says. "And as long as I'm standing 
there next to him, it's a band."<br>
<br>
You have been outspoken in the past about the songs Bruce left off The 
River — that, in fact, it was some of his best work and didn't deserve 
to be left behind.<br>
<br>
The River, to me, meant 43 songs.<br>
<br>
The actual album plus the outtakes.<br>
<br>
And those are among the greatest records ever made, as far as I'm 
concerned. It's funny, because all these years you're thinking 
"outtakes." There's really not that much he'd have replaced on The 
River. It works very well. And these two other albums' worth of songs 
are just two legitimate albums. The second outtake album is another 
band's career. The first one [the initial sequence, The Ties That Bind, 
pulled by Springsteen before release] — that's some of our best stuff: 
"Loose Ends," "Restless Nights."<br>
<br>
Does it feel strange to be going on the road without new music, playing an album from 1980?<br>
<br>
I'm looking at that outtake album as new music — absolutely, which is 
why I hope some of it gets integrated into the show, whether we're doing
 it in sequence or not. We might have occasionally played "Loose Ends." 
We did "Where the Bands Are" maybe twice, "Take 'em as They Come" a 
couple of times, "Restless Nights" once. Honestly, I think we're coming 
out to promote a new album in that sense.<br>
<br>
What did you think of that initial sequence, The Ties That Bind, before Bruce pulled it to create The River?<br>
<br>
I don't remember knowing about that. I don't know how I missed it 
[laughs]. And I'm there producing. A couple of songs, like "Cindy," I 
don't remember at all. And there it is — second track on the album we 
delivered.<br>
<br>
He was right in pulling it back, saying it doesn't feel finished. He 
thinks so deeply about this stuff, so comprehensively. I can't pretend 
to understand everything he's thinking about. I can only do what my 
instincts tell me and what he says he wants to do — out loud [laughs], 
which might be five or ten percent of what's actually going on. Part of 
the job of being a producer is the Vulcan mind meld, where you listen 
not to what they're saying but what they mean.<br>
<br>
He described The River as his first "insider" album — about the 
struggles in working life, personal relationships and family — after 
making four albums about "outsiders."<br>
He had a vague film-noir aspect to Darkness on the Edge of Town. Born to
 Run was a mixture of things but mostly about youth and fantasies. Now, 
all of a sudden, it's "The Ties That Bind" and "I Wanna Marry You." It 
was partially the fantasy of being normal. He wasn't quite there yet. He
 would wisely wait until he felt a bit more secure, which wouldn't be 
until that album came out and we had our first, real success with [the 
Top Five hit] "Hungry Heart." That allowed him to start thinking about 
having a real life, so to speak.<br>
<br>
Was there a turning-point song in The River sessions where you could 
hear the material becoming more than a sprawl of material, developing a 
narrative course?<br>
<br>
I don't think so. It was one song after the other. He was in that 
hundred-song run which maybe Bob Dylan and a few others have had. That 
run of songs from Darkness to The River — it just became normal. "The 
Ties That Bind" felt like a statement. "The River" had that wonderful 
thing he does — very detailed nuance in a story. The more detailed, the 
more particular it gets, the more universal it is. I found that 
fascinating.<br>
<br>
He just had a thing: "I'm bringing everybody to me. I'm not going to 
them. I don't belong in the mainstream industry. They're coming to me — 
or they're not coming. And if we're at the Stone Pony forever, so be 
it." He was not into compromise, from Day One.<br>
<br>
That continues to this day. He's his own genre, his own rules. Kids at 
home, don't follow this career path. You'll find it doesn't work for 
you. [Laughs] But it works for him.<br>
<br>
As Bruce's co-producer on The River, how did you deal with telling him "No" or "You should change this"?<br>
It's about having the right conversation at the right time. In the end, 
you accept the fact that you're there to help him realize his vision. 
Every single outtake was a lost argument. He was getting 10, 12 great 
songs very quickly at that point. I would be like, "OK, let's put that 
out. You want to do 12 more? That will be the next album." But you can't
 stop that flow when it happens. Chuck Berry had that flow for five or 
six years. The Beatles, the Rolling Stones — the great ones have a run 
where they're in touch with something a little bit mystical, a little 
bit beyond logic.<br>
<br>
<br>
"He just continues to break the rules," says Van Zandt of Springsteen. Allan Tannenbaum/Getty Images<br>
<br>
It's not something you plan, that you aspire to. You have this stuff 
built up inside, wanting to come out, and you tap into that faucet. Born
 to Run was eight songs. He went from that to a hundred [over Darkness 
and The River]. It was some of divine ... [pauses] It's something you 
can't take for granted. That's what made me mad sometimes. I'd get angry
 with him. Here I am, struggling to write a good song; every fucking one
 of them is war. And I'd be like, "Hey, man, you're annoying me here. 
You're taking this shit a little bit for granted. [Laughs] What do you 
mean you're throwing out this song other people would have a career 
with?" "Restless Nights," that's a career. "Loose Ends," that's a 
career. But you can't stop it. Once it's happening, you go with it.<br>
<br>
We had a wonderful recording method by then. We'd found the right studio
 [the Power Station in New York City]; we'd found the right engineers. 
We figured all that stuff out. It felt so good to go to work every day, 
after three years of torture. Suddenly, recording is fun. That alone is 
good for 40 fucking songs.<br>
<br>
In a way, The River marked a break in what had been an indivisible 
thing. He wrote songs; the E Street Band played them. But his next 
album, Nebraska, was totally, literally solo. From that point on, there 
was a divide between Bruce's solo records and E Street work.<br>
He wanted both things. He always had both things in him, ever since I've
 known him. He has the solo-folk side, and the band side. Most people do
 one or the other. He was extremely versatile. And that can be 
confusing. He didn't want to be tied down. When I heard the Nebraska 
demos, I said, "This is an album." As a producer, you know when someone 
is doing something special. I thought it was the most intimate glimpse 
of his solo side, the folk side, that you were ever going to get Why? 
Because he never intended to put it out. Taking on those characters, 
doing that crazy yodeling — it sounded like you were in fucking 
Nebraska.<br>
<br>
I actually think The River is somewhat underrated, even by fans, because
 it came between the breakout records. It's actually caught in the long 
shadows between Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town and Born in 
the U.S.A.<br>
I think that's right. I've had a theory for years: I don't think the 
human brain can absorb more than 10, 12 songs at a time. Altbough it was
 the right thing to do a double album, it becomes diluted. Your energy 
is going to 20 songs instead of 10, and you appreciate them less. If it 
had been a single album, it would have been appreciated more, especially
 if he had put more of the pop-rock stuff on there. It would have been 
our biggest album. All you gotta do is throw on "The River" — that's all
 the content you need. [Laughs] A little of Bruce's content goes a long 
way. But he felt he had to do eight or 10 songs like that. And I 
understand that. He was very conscious of carving out his own identity.<br>
<br>
He just continues to break the rules. You can't categorize or predict what he's going to do. That is part of the fun.<br>
<br>
And you just wait for the call.<br>
And hope you're available [laughs]. All you can do is try and keep up. 
This tour is a bit of a miracle, really. There's no grand plan here. It 
just happened. And we'll see what happens tonight. We haven't played 
with this small a band in a few years.<br>
<br>
Actually, half of the 10 people onstage were on The River. You lost 
organist Danny Federici and saxophonist Clarence Clemons, but that's 
still a good survival rate.<br>
In many ways, this tour is probably the biggest tribute to Clarence and 
Danny — in the details. I was enjoying that at rehearsal, enjoying the 
detail in the songs – not just in the arrangements but in the different 
keyboard sounds and the great melodies of the sax solos. Jake [Clemons, 
Clarence's nephew and replacement] is getting better and better. And you
 realize those solos are part of the compositions — that old King Curtis
 style. The drum fills are totally part of the composition.<br>
<br>
Those seven guys on The River — everybody was doing something important,
 playing a very specific role. It's a real "band" album, in the true 
sense of the word.</div>

By Donnie Moorhouse |<br>
<br>
 Special to The Republican <br>
on February 11, 2016 </strong> <br>
<br>
HARTFORD – Are you ready for transformation?<br>
That is the question Bruce Springsteen often asks of those who embark on
 a journey with the E Street Band. He asked the sold out crowd at the XL
 Center on Wednesday night.<br>
The crowd roared a hoarse approval, and the artist delivered.<br>
The journey this time out, more than 40 years into his touring career, 
is a retrospective of "The River," Springsteen's acclaimed 1980 
double-album that was recently re-released as a box set with remastered 
cuts, lost tracks, and concert footage.<br>
Springsteen's stripped-down version of the E Street Band, an eight-piece
 outfit that eschewed the gospel choir, horn section, added guitar and 
vocals (Tom Morello is not on the tour and Patti Scialfa was missing 
from the lineup) served as guides on the journey, a three hour and 
16-minute, 33-song affair that began with a reading of "The River" in 
the exact order it was laid out on vinyl.<br>
"This was my coming of age record," said Springsteen. "I wanted it to be big. I wanted it to feel like life."<br>
The band took the stage with the lights on as if they had just happened 
upon this setting and fired into "Meet Me In The City," an outtake from 
"The River" sessions which has been re-imagined as the lead single.<br>
The record came to life through "The Ties That Bind," and "Sherry 
Darling," two songs of jubilation tempered with life's adult questions 
about commitment and accountability. "Independence Day" was the first 
song Springsteen wrote "about fathers and sons" and came off as 
simultaneously sad and grand.<br>

The sequencing of the album (does that even happen anymore?) shines in a
 live setting as the story escalates and the characters evolve. 
Jubilation returned, this time underscored with restlessness on "Out in 
the Street."<br>
Reaching transformation is never easy in a room with 15,000 strangers 
and to make the task even more challenging Springsteen was sticking to a
 script. There are songs on "The River" that were never meant to be 
played in an arena concert ("I Wanna Marry You") and songs ("I'm A 
Rocker") that were probably never meant to be played again.<br>
However, the hidden gems on the recording like "Point Blank," and 
"Stolen Car" were both beautifully rendered and moved the transformation
 process along quite well.<br>
It was a coming out party of sorts for Jake Clemons, nephew of the late 
Clarence Clemons who has filled the void on saxophone for several tours 
now. "The River" is a showcase record for the saxophone and Clemons' 
shone brightly in his expanded role on songs like "Drive All Night."<br>
The night had pockets of exuberance with Springsteen crowd-surfing 
through "Hungry Heart" and guitars ringing out on "Cadillac Ranch," 
"Ramrod," and "Crush on You."<br>
The journey closed with the somber "Wreck on the Highway."<br>
Taking only enough time to switch guitars, Springsteen lit into the 
second act, this time paying tribute to his 1984 release "Born on the 
USA" with "No Surrender," "Bobby Jean," and "Dancing in the Dark" all 
making the list.<br>
He pulled out "Loose End" a track left off "The River" that fit 
perfectly with the album's overall theme. The band veered from "Because 
the Night" to "The Rising" and "Thunder Road," before a lights-on-again 
encore of "Born to Run."<br>
The staple "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" was a bar-band mess complete 
with a Three Stooges (Clemons, Springsteen, Little Steven) mash-up at 
the center microphone. The night ended with a cover of "Shout."</div>

<br>
by Dan DeLuca, Inquirer Music Critic</strong><br>
<br>
The arrival of The River in October 1980 came at a momentous time in 
Bruce Springsteen's career. It was his fifth album and first double LP, 
and also the first music he released after turning 30 the previous year.<br>
<br>
With Born to Run in 1975, he had built a Wall of Sound monument to 
rock-and-roll escape - and survived the hype of being on the cover of 
Time and Newsweek.<br>
<br>
The world closed in on 1978's brooding Darkness on the Edge of Town, 
which fought back with a raised-fist declaration on "Badlands": "It 
ain't no sin to be glad you're alive!"<br>
<br>
But The River, which Springsteen and the E Street Band will perform in 
its entirety in a sold-out show at the Wells Fargo Center in South 
Philadelphia on Friday, wasn't about doing battle with the world. It was
 about finding a place in it.<br>
<br>
"You've been hurt and you're all cried out you say / You walk down the 
street pushin' people out of your way," Springsteen sang in the first 
words of the opening "The Ties That Bind," which is also the name of the
 boxed set released in December that spurred the River redux tour.<br>
<br>
The album is about getting past that oppositional attitude and 
connecting to a larger community. That could mean "Having a home and a 
family, facing up to their responsibilities" in "I Wanna Marry You," or 
being at home in the crowd in "Out in the Street." Or even pondering the
 meaning of it all in the solemn country-western closer, "Wreck on the 
Highway." The River is about staring adulthood in the mirror.<br>
<br>
Springsteen had originally conceived of The River as a single album - a 
10-song version is included in the boxed set. But to get the full range 
of music the band played on stage, it had to be twice that long, taking 
in the frat-rock silliness of "Sherry Darling," bracing claustrophobia 
of "Jackson Cage," and heartbreak noir of "Point Blank." And also 
"Hungry Heart," the radio hit written for the Ramones that transformed 
Springsteen into a pop artist.<br>
<br>
The idea, as Springsteen recently told David Fricke of Rolling Stone, 
was "to make a record that felt like a show. . . . It went from being 
ridiculous and joyous to heart-numbing." And with so many new songs, the
 show grew. The River introduced the marathon, three-hour-plus 
Springsteen experience that - remarkably, 35 years later - is still with
 us.<br>
<br>
When The River hit the road in 1980, Springsteen confronted reality on a
 number of levels. The period also marks his emergence as a politically 
engaged artist.<br>
<br>
Previously, the closest he had come to making political statements was 
when he played the No Nukes benefit shows at Madison Square Garden in 
1979. But in November 1980, Ronald Reagan was elected president. The 
Gipper rode in on a conservative tide in stark contrast to the 
left-leaning Woody Guthrie populism that would become more pronounced in
 Springsteen's work, eventually leading to overt acts like the 
get-out-the-vote gig he played for candidate Barack Obama on the 
Benjamin Franklin Parkway in 2008.<br>
<br>
The Ties That Bind box includes a concert from the day after Reagan's 
election. Before "Badlands," the mutton-chopped singer tells the Arizona
 State University crowd: "I don't know what you guys think about what 
happened last night, but I think it's pretty frightening."<br>
<br>
The Tempe show is electrifying, and it'll serve as a handy model to 
compare what Springsteen and the band - now with the late Clarence 
Clemons' nephew Jake on saxophone - look and sound like on stage Friday<br>
<br>
What I really wish, however, is that there were River tour video from a 
month later in Philadelphia. That was when I first saw Springsteen live,
 on the second and third nights of a three-show stand at the Spectrum in
 December 1980.<br>
<br>
Speaking with Rolling Stone's Fricke, Springsteen joked about the 
expectations the band has to live up to in 2016. "You not only have to 
be better than you were," he said. "You have to be better than what 
people remember you did, which is tough. Somebody will be like, 'I saw 
you back in '76 at Blah-Blah-Blah college. That was the greatest show I 
ever saw.' Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't. But it's remembered that way."<br>
<br>
To me, those blah-blah-blah nights are The River Spectrum shows. Not 
only for what took place on stage, but because of what transpired in 
between.<br>
<br>
After sleeping out for tickets, I went to the first show with a group of
 friends, new ones from freshman year at college, and old ones from my 
hometown at the Jersey Shore. Plus, my brother Nick and his pals who 
drove down from Rutgers on the Jersey Turnpike.<br>
<br>
The Dec. 8 show, in my recollection, was everything we hoped it would 
be, a three-hour-plus blowout with "Rosalita" and the Detroit Medley, 
and the unreleased songs "Fire" and "Because the Night."<br>
<br>
It got even better afterward, when the gang went to Pat's Steaks and 
realized that the E Street Band - sans Bruce and Clarence - had also 
shown up hungry at Ninth and Passyunk. Hey, Roy Bittan, how you doing?</div>

<br>
<br>
Dear Friends &amp; Fans, a little glimpse from center stage.<br>
<br>
Six Air Force Thunderbirds have just roared overhead at what felt like 
inches above our backstage area, giving myself and the entire E Street 
Band a brush cut. With 20 minutes to go, I’m sitting in my trailer 
trying to decide what boots to wear. I’ve got a nice pair of cowboy 
boots my feet look really good in, but I’m concerned about their 
stability. Two days ago we rehearsed in full rain on the field and the 
stage became as slick as an ice pond. It was almost impossible to stand 
on. It was so slick I crashed into Mike Colucci, our cameraman, coming 
off my knee slide, his camera the only thing that kept me from launching
 out onto the soggy turf. When Jerry the umpire in “Glory Days” did his 
bit, he came running out, couldn’t stop himself and executed one of the 
most painfully perfect “man slips on a banana peel” falls I’ve ever 
seen. This sent Steve, myself and the entire band into one of the 
biggest stress-induced laughters of our lives that lasted all the way 
back to our trailers. (A few Advil and Jerry was okay.)<br>
<br>
I better go with the combat boots I always carry. The round toes will 
give me better braking power than the pointy-toed cowboy boots when I 
hit the deck. I stuff my boots with two innersoles to make them as 
fitted as possible, zip them up snuggly around my ankles, stomp around 
in my trailer a bit and feel pretty grounded. Fifteen minutes…oh, by the
 way, I’m somewhat nervous. It’s not the usual pre-show jitters, not 
“butterflies,” it’s not wardrobe malfunction anticipation anxiety, I’m 
talking about five minutes to beach landing, “Right Stuff” “Lord Don’t 
Let Me Screw the Pooch in Front of 100 Million People” one of the 
biggest television audiences since dinosaurs first screwed on earth kind
 of semi-terror. It only lasts for a minute…I check my hair, spray it 
with something that turns it into concrete and I’m out the door.<br>
I catch sight of Patti smiling. She’s been my rock all week. I put my 
arm around her and away we go. They take us by golf cart to a holding 
tunnel right off the field. The problem is there are a thousand people 
there, tv cameras, media of all kinds and general chaos. Suddenly, 
hundreds of people rush by us in a column shouting, cheering…our fans! 
And tonight also our stage builders. These are “the volunteers”. They’ve
 been here for two weeks on their own dime in a field day after day, 
putting together and pulling apart pieces of our stage over and over 
again, theoretically achieving military precision. Now it’s for real. I 
hope they’ve got it down because as we’re escorted onto the field, 
lights in the stadium fully up, the banshee wail of 70,000 screaming 
football fanatics rising in our ears, there’s nothing there. Nothing…no 
sound, no lights, no instruments, no stage, nothing but brightly lit 
unwelcoming green turf. Suddenly an army of ants come from all sides of 
what seems like nowhere. Each rolling a piece of our lifeline, our earth
 onto the field. The cavalry has arrived. What takes us on a concert day
 8 hours to do is done in five minutes. Unbelieveable. Everything in our
 world is there…we hope. We gather a few feet off the stage, form a 
circle of hands, I say a few words drowned out by the crowd and it’s 
smiles all around. I’ve been in a lot of high stakes situations like 
this, though not exactly like this, with these people before. It’s 
stressful, but our band is made for it…and it’s about to begin…so happy 
warriors we bound up onto the stage.<br>
II<br>
The NFL stage manager gives me the three minute sign…two 
minutes…one…there’s a guy jumping up and down on sections of the stage 
to get them to sit evenly on the grass field…30 seconds…they’re still 
testing all the speakers and equipment…that’s cutting it close! The 
lights in the stadium go down. The crowd erupts and Max’s drumbeat opens
 “10th Avenue.” I feel a white light silhouette Clarence and I for a 
moment. I hear Roy’s piano. I give “C”‘s hand a pat. I’m on the move 
tossing my guitar in a high arc for Kevin, my guitar tech, to catch and 
it’s…”ladies and gentlemen, for the next 12 minutes we will be bringing 
the righteous and mighty power of the E Street Band into your beautiful 
home. So…step back from the guacamole dip. Put the chicken fingers down!
 And turn the TV ALL the way up!” Because, of course, there is just ONE 
thing I’ve got to know: “IS THERE ANYBODY ALIVE OUT THERE?!”<br>
All I know is if you were standing next to me, you would be. I feel like
 I’ve just taken a syringe of adrenalin straight to the heart. Before we
 came out, I had two major concerns. One, something might go wrong 
beyond my control. That completely disappeared before we hit the stage. 
Tonight our fate is in the hands of many, so no sense for useless worry.
 Two, I was worried that I would find myself ‘out’ of myself and not in 
the moment. My old friend Peter Wolf once said ‘the strangest thing you 
can do on stage is think about what you’re doing.” This is true. To 
observe oneself from afar while struggling to bring the moment to life 
is an unpleasant experience. I’ve had it more than once. It’s an 
existential problem. Unfortunately, right in my wheel house. It doesn’t 
mean it’s going to be a bad show. It may be a great one. It just means 
it might take time, something we don’t have much of tonight. When that 
happens, I do anything to break it. Tear up the set list, call an 
audible, make a mistake, anything to get “IN.” That’s what you get paid 
for, TO BE HERE NOW! The power, potential and volume of your 
present-ness is a basic rock and roll promise. It’s the essential 
element that holds the attention of your audience, that gives force, 
shape and authority to the evening’s events. And however you get there 
on any given night, that’s the road you take. “IS THERE ANYBODY ALIVE IN
 HERE?!”…there better be.<br>
I’m on top of the piano (good old boots). I’m down. One…two…three, knee 
drop in front of the microphone and I’m bending back almost flat on the 
stage. I close my eyes for a moment and when I open them, I see nothing 
but blue night sky. No band, no crowd, no stadium. I hear and feel all 
of it in the form of a great siren like din surrounding me but with my 
back nearly flat against the stage I see nothing but beautiful night sky
 with a halo of a thousand stadium suns at its edges. I take several 
deep breaths and a calm comes over me. I feel myself deeply and happily 
“IN.”<br>
Since the inception of our band it was our ambition to play for 
everyone. We’ve achieved a lot but we haven’t achieved that. Our 
audience remains tribal…that is predominantly white. On occasion, the 
Inaugural Concert, during a political campaign, touring through Africa 
in ’88, particularly in Cleveland with President Obama, I looked out and
 sang “Promised Land” to the audience I intended it for, young people, 
old people, black, white, brown, cutting across religious and class 
lines. That’s who I’m singing to today. Today we play for everyone. I 
pull myself upright with the mike stand back into the world, this world,
 my world, the one with everybody in it and the stadium, the crowd, my 
band, my best friends, my wife come rushing into view and it’s 
“teardrops on the city…”<br>
III<br>
During “Tenth Avenue” I tell the story of my band…and other things “when
 the change was made uptown”…. It goes rushing by, then the knee slide. 
Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come Mike…BOOM! 
And I’m onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg 
off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up and…say it, say 
it, say it, say it…BLAM! BORN TO RUN…my story…Something bright and hot 
blows up behind me. I heard there were fireworks. I never saw any. Just 
the ones going off in my head. I’m out of breath. I try to slow it down.
 That ain’t gonna happen. I already hear the crowd singing the last 
eight bars of “Born to Run” oh, oh, oh, oh…then it’s straight into 
“Working on a Dream”…your story…and mine I hope. Steve is on my right, 
Patti on my left. I catch a smile and the wonderful choir, The Joyce 
Garrett Singers, that backed me in Washington during the Inaugural 
concert is behind us. I turn to see their faces and listen to the sound 
of their voices…”working on a dream”. Done. Moments later, we’re ripping
 straight into “Glory Days”…the end of the story. A last party steeped 
in merry fatalism and some laughs with my old pal, Steve. Jerry the Ump 
doesn’t fall on his ass tonight. He just throws the yellow penalty flag 
for the precious 40 seconds we’ve gone overtime…home stretch. Everyone 
is out front now forming that great line. Out of the corner of my eye, I
 catch the horns raising their instruments high, my guitar is wheeling 
around my neck and on the seventh beat, I’m going to Disneyland. I’m 
already someplace a lot farther and more fun than that. I look around, 
we’re alive, it’s over, we link arms and take a bow as the stage comes 
apart beneath our feet. It’s chaos again all the way back to the 
trailer. A toast…our families, friends, Jon, George, Brendan, Barbara, 
with Don Mischer, Ricky Kirshner, Glenn Weiss, Charles Coplin, and Dick 
Ebersol, the great team that put it altogether and the end of a good 
football game.<br>
IV<br>
The theory of relativity holds. On stage your exhilaration is in direct 
proportion to the void you’re dancing over. A gig I always looked a 
little askance at and was a little wary of turned out to have surprising
 emotional power and resonance for me and my band. It was a high point, a
 marker of some sort and went up with the biggest shows of our work 
life. The NFL threw us an anniversary party the likes of which we’d 
never throw for ourselves (we’re too fussy) with fireworks and 
everything! In the middle of their football game, they let us hammer out
 a little part of our story. I love playing long and hard but it was the
 35 years in 12 minutes…that was the trick. You start here, you end 
there, that’s it. That’s the time you’ve got to give it everything you 
have…12 minutes…give or take a few seconds. The Super Bowl is going to 
help me sell a few new records, that’s what I wanted because I want 
people to hear where we are today. It’ll probably put a few extra 
fannies in the seats and that’s fine. We live high around here and I 
like to do good business for my record company and concert promoters. 
But what it’s really about is my band remains one of the mightiest in 
the land and I want you to know it, we want to show you…because we can.<br>
By 3 am, I am back home, everyone in the house fast asleep and tucked in
 bed. I am sitting in the yard over an open fire, staring up again into 
that black night sky, my ears still ringing…”Oh yeah, it’s alright.”<br>

Springsteen - Philly 2016<br>
Dan DeLuca, Inquirer Music Critic<br>
Posted: Friday, February 12, 2016, <br>
Filed Under: Music &amp; Nightlife</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
From a distance of 35 years, Bruce Springsteen revisited The River in South Philadelphia on Friday night.<br>
<br>
With his E Street Band behind him, the 66-year-old Springsteen took the 
stage at the sold-out Wells Fargo Center just past 8 p.m. and, after 
proclaiming his delight at being back in the City of Brotherly Love, 
began the marathon communal gathering with "Meet Me In The City," the 
rousing rocker that was an outtake from the 1980 release and is serving 
as the table setter for the ultra hot ticket tour occasioned by a 
release of an expanded River box set in December.<br>
<br>
Before going on to play the 20 songs on the original double LP in 
sequence, Springsteen took a moment to reflect on his intentions on what
 he called "my coming-of-age album."<br>
<br>
Until then, he and the E Streeters had been part of "an outsider 
community in Asbury Park," he said. With The River, he wanted to enter 
the adult world. "I wanted it to be about fun and laughter and dancing 
and sex, lonely nights and teardrops. I wanted it to be big. I wanted it
 to feel like life."<br>
<br>
On Friday, E Street was stripped down close to bar band essentials with 
the late Clarence Clemons' nephew Jake stepping out on saxophone, 
serving as sole horn player rather than the full section of recent 
tours, and consigliere and guitarist Miami Steve Van Zandt's ragged but 
right yowling vocals restored to primacy.<br>
<br>
And to be sure, the band roared: yukking it up on the fraternity rock of
 "Sherry Darling," pushing hard against the suburban claustrophobia of 
"Jackson Cage" and ripping it up on "Cadillac Ranch," the party starter 
that Springsteen tipped off those not already in the know is really "a 
funeral song."<br>
<br>
The River is about finding joys in everyday life on songs like "Ramrod" 
and "I'm A Rocker," and also being smacked down and put back in your 
place. Springsteen approached both its romantic moments, like "I Wanna 
Marry You" and its most sorrowful, such as "Independence Day," with 
wisdom that comes with age.<br>
<br>
He began the former with a gorgeous doo wop intro in which he reminisced
 about the first kiss he ever stole growing up in Freehold, N.J., while 
identifying the song as being about "a love without consequences that 
doesn't exist." And in his opening to the latter, one of his great songs
 about escaping the poisoned legacy of his father, he talked of the 
growing-up process of being "startled by your parents humanity and the 
fact that they had dreams and desires of their own."<br>
<br>
"There's an opera out on the turnpike, there's a ballet being fought out
 in the alley," Springsteen sang later on in the show in "Jungleland," 
from Born To Run, a 1975 album that's far more grandiose than The River.<br>
<br>
But The River plays like an opera in its own way, albeit one with fewer 
crescendos and in which crushing disappointments are suffered more 
quietly, in ghostly ballads like "Point Blank" and "Stolen Car," which 
Springsteen said was the first song he ever wrote that "got down to the 
nitty gritty. When you lose your love, do you lose yourself?"<br>
<br>
The River ended Friday on a somber, philosophical country and western 
note, with the hero of "Wreck On The Highway" spooked by the sight of a 
bloody car crash, holding his lover by his side and thinking about all 
he has to lose.<br>
<br>
"The River was really about time," Springsteen said as the instrumental 
coda played out. "How when you enter the adult world, when you choose 
your partner, and you find your work, the clock starts ticking and 
you've got limited amount of time to do your work, raise your family and
 do something good."<br>
<br>
The River took two hours to ride, and of course the show had another 
hour and a half to go. The first set-after-the-set was heavy on sturdy 
rockers of moody seriousness and sweeping grandeur.<br>
<br>
First up was one for the locals, with the electrified take on Nebraska's
 small time hood tale kicking off with "They blew up the chicken man in 
Philly last night ...." flowing into an emphatic "Prove It All Night" in
 which Springsteen and Van Zandt got their licks in, but third man Nils 
Lofgren spun in circles and showed he's the virtuoso guitarist on stage.<br>
<br>
"My Love Will Not Let You Down" built up a Spectorian Wall of Sound, 
"Human Touch" was a opportunity for  Springsteen and wife Patti Scialfa 
to twine their voices together, and the pre-encore show came to a close 
with the one-two-three punch of "Jungleland," "The Rising" and "Thunder 
Road."<br>
<br>
And after that, three hours in, time for a bathroom break, right? Nope. 
House lights up and "Born To Run," kicking off an extended encore 
instead, complete with a red jump suited Elvis impersonator taking a 
twirl with violinist Soozie Tyrell on "Dancing In The Dark" and, yes, 
"Rosalita."<br>
<br>
It was with the original River tour that the 3-hour-plus maximalist 
Springsteen experience became standard practice, and while his 
performances are more carefully calibrated these days, Springsteen 
stills wipes you out with his endurance and enthusiasm, with next to no 
discernible drop-off in musical quality. And 35 years down the road, 
that's something to marvel at.</div>

To watch Bruce Springsteen step onto a stage in New Jersey is to watch 
Moses walk to the edge of the Red Sea, so confident in his ability to 
perform a miracle, to carry his people to the Promised Land. I believe 
in the magic of seeing a musician perform in the place they once called 
home. The Jersey air felt different, lighter than usual, as I walked 
into the massive Prudential Center and made my way to my seat. <br>
<br>
Having seen Springsteen before, I wasn’t surprised by the aesthetics of 
the arena. I imagine, though, that this could be overwhelming for 
someone who has never seen Springsteen live. The chanting and relentless
 fist-pumping beforehand while the stage is being set up, the American 
flags wrapped around foreheads or hanging off of backs. From another 
angle, this may feel like a strange political rally. On its face, it 
matches the tone, passion, and volume of political theater at its base 
form. <br>
<br>
Whether or not the preacher himself intends this, in the church of Bruce
 Springsteen, it is understood that there is a singular America, one 
where there is a dream to be had for all who enter, and everyone 
emerges, hours later, closer to that dream. <br>
<br>
I found my seat next to an older man who, despite our fairly close 
proximity to the stage, was still using binoculars to scan the rapidly 
growing crowd around us. Without looking away from his binoculars, he 
told me that he saw Bruce back in 1980, when The River was first 
released. He explained that he saw Bruce play on December 8, 1980. I 
thought on this for a moment, before it came together. “Lennon,” I said.
 “The night Lennon was murdered.” He finally put down his binoculars, 
nodded lightly, looked at the exit, toward the outside world, and said 
“I hope no one gets killed out there during the show this time.”<br>
<br>
The day before I crossed into New Jersey to watch this show, Bruce 
Springsteen playing through his iconic 1980 double album, The River, I 
found myself in Ferguson, Missouri, standing over Michael Brown’s 
memorial plaque. There was no notable reason for this trip. I’m not sure
 what I wanted to feel, other than closer to a sadness and rage that had
 become a very real part of my life. I was in St. Louis, and I think I 
wanted to return to a place where the fight to pull itself back together
 never stopped, against the backdrop of suffocating injustice that still
 hangs above the city. The air feels different in Ferguson, too. Unlike 
New Jersey on the night of Bruce Springsteen coming home, the air in 
Ferguson still feels heavy, thick with grief. Yet it is still a town of 
people who take their joy where they can get it, living because they 
must. <br>
<br>
There is a part of me that has always understood The River to be about 
this. Staring down the life you have left and claiming it as your own, 
living it to the best of your ability before the clock runs out. In 
“Jackson Cage,” a man dreams of a life more fulfilling than the one he 
has with the woman he loves in a New Jersey town, but he settles. He 
gives himself over to the fact that what he has will do, until he has 
nothing else. This, too, is the promise that has always been sold in 
Bruce Springsteen’s music. The ability to make the most out of your 
life, because it’s the only life you have.<br>
<br>
The technician in me has always loved watching how deftly Bruce 
Springsteen commands the E-Street Band, and this night in New Jersey was
 no different. During “Sherry Darling,” it takes a mere turn of his head
 and a slight nod to pull sax player Jake Clemons to the front of the 
stage for a solo. During “Two Hearts,” Bruce leaves the stage to walk 
among the crowd, and Steve Van Zandt slides directly into the hole Bruce
 left onstage. Not a note was missed, even as Bruce crowd-surfed and 
danced with members of the audience.<br>
<br>
What has always fascinated me most about The River is the start of Side 
2. The way “Hungry Heart” bleeds into “Out in the Street,” two of the 
most upbeat songs on the album, but the two that I have always found the
 saddest, both explicitly and implicitly. In one, a man, overcome by 
dissatisfaction with the perceived American Dream, leaves his wife and 
children, never to return. In the other, there is a celebration of 
freedom from what we are to believe is a soul-crushing job. During “Out 
in the Street,” while most of the audience danced and clapped along to 
the lyrics about going into work at a job you don’t love on Monday and 
dreaming of stripping out of your work clothes on Friday, I thought, as I
 do every time I hear the song, about living the Tuesday, Wednesday, and
 Thursday. During the second chorus, a woman behind me tapped my 
shoulder, smiled, and yelled “Come on! You gotta want to dance to this!”<br>
<br>
Here is where I tell you that this was a sold-out show, and as I looked 
around the swelling arena when I arrived, the only other black people I 
saw were performing labor, in some capacity. The fact that I noticed 
this, I’m sure, would potentially seem absurd to many of the other 
people attending the concert. One of the other black people, an older 
man with a laugh like my father’s, led me to my seat and told me that he
 hoped he got to watch a bit of the show in between working. <br>
<br>
In Bruce Springsteen’s music, not just in The River, I think about the 
romanticization of work and how that is reflected in America. Rather, 
for whom work is romantic, and for whom work is a necessary and 
sometimes painful burden of survival. One that comes with the shame of 
time spent away from loved ones, and a country that insists you aren’t 
working hard enough. In New Jersey, Springsteen’s songs are the same 
anthemic introspective paintings of a singular America: Men do labor 
that is often hard, loading crates or working on a dock, and there is 
often a promised reward at the end of it all. A loving woman always 
waiting to run away with you, a dance with your name on it, a son who 
will grow up and take pride in the beautiful, sanctifying joy of work.<br>
<br>
I do not know what side of work the employees in the Prudential Center 
came down on that night, or any night. I know that I understand being 
black in America, and I have understood being poor in America. What I 
know comes with both of those things, often together, is work that is 
always present, the promise of more to come. Even in my decade-plus of 
loving Bruce Springsteen’s music, I have always known and accepted that 
the idea of hard, beautiful, romantic work is a dream sold a lot easier 
by someone who currently knows where their next meal will come from. <br>
<br>
As the band launched into a killer extended version of “Cadillac Ranch,”
 I looked over to the steps and saw a young black man who had been 
vending popcorn and candy. He was sitting on a step, covered in sweat, 
and rubbing his right ankle. A man, presumably attempting to get back to
 his seat, yelled at him to move.<br>
<br>
What I understand about The River now that I didn’t before I saw it in 
New Jersey is that this is an album about coming to terms with the fact 
that you are going to eventually die, written by someone who seemed to 
have an understanding of the fact that he was going to live for a long 
time. It is an album of men and women and families and the grand idea of
 surviving to enjoy it all. It is often fearless and forward-looking in 
its talk of both love and loss. There’s a conflict between dreams and 
reality, of course, but the reality is still always one of survival.<br>
<br>
As the final saxophone solo in “Drive All Night” kissed every corner of 
the Prudential Center and hundreds of cell phone flashlights cut through
 the dark of the arena, I realized that I am now the age Bruce 
Springsteen was when The River was released in 1980. I once thought that
 I saw the same version of adulthood that The Riverspeaks of. One with 
conflict and celebration, but always living. It is 2016, and not 
watching the videos of black people murdered doesn’t mean that black 
people aren’t still being murdered. I try not to think about death — my 
own, or that of anyone I love — but I don’t consider the future in the 
way that The River seems to consider the future. I don’t fear what the 
future holds as much as I fear not being alive long enough to see it. It
 could have been the ghosts of Ferguson that I carried with me to New 
Jersey, or the sheer emotional exhaustion I felt as the last notes of 
“Wreck on the Highway” died out, but I felt like I truly fell in a 
different type of love with The Riverafter seeing it in this way. What 
it must feel like to write an album like this. To listen to an album 
like this with different eyes on the world. What it must feel like to 
imagine that no one in America will be killed while a man sings a song 
about the promise of living.</div>
