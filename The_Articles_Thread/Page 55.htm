<br>
By Rob Harvilla <br>
For The Columbus Dispatch    <br>
Wednesday April 16, 2014 </strong><br>
<br>
Crowd-surfing by the fourth song (Hungry Heart) and taking requests by 
the fifth (Blinded by the Light), Bruce Springsteen proved he’s still 
the Boss last night by letting a packed, jubilant Nationwide Arena crowd
 order him around. (Plus high-five and/or lightly grope him, if you got 
close enough to attempt a selfie.)<br>
<br>
He proved it all night, you might say, or at least a long-enough portion
 of the night (three hours and change) for a highly adrenalized devotee 
to hypothetically take a last-chance power drive from here to Detroit, 
and possibly back.<br>
<br>
Adrenaline is his medium, whether he’s giving us what we want (the 
immortal whoa-oh-oh orgies of Badlands and, yes, Born to Run) or what we
 need (the hard-times catharsis of sneaky-great 2012 single Wrecking 
Ball). Even touring behind a bum album (January’s spotty High Hopes) and
 with his freshly Rock and Roll Hall of Fame-inducted E Street Band down
 some key personnel (fancy-pants rap-rock guitarist Tom Morello subbing 
for Stevie Van Zandt, and dearly departed sax man Clarence Clemons’ 
shoes capably filled by nephew Jake Clemons), Springsteen didn’t so much
 bring the house down as he inverted it and shook vigorously.<br>
<br>
Morello, the ’90s-beloved, wah-wah-pedal-loving ex-Rage against the 
Machine ax-wielder, is far better suited to this company in person. His 
goofy, incongruous solo on a reworked The Ghost of Tom Joad — Gen X 
graffiti artlessly scrawled on John Steinbeck’s grave — nearly torpedoes
 High Hopes all on its own.<br>
<br>
But the Nationwide crowd ate his exuberance up, and somehow turned a 
disaster into a showstopper. American Skin (41 Shots), the somber and 
brave 2001 tribute to NYPD shooting victim Amadou Diallo now given a 
fresh, grim, racially charged relevance by the 2012 death of Trayvon 
Martin, hit just as hard and made the new record worth revisiting, the 
house’s cooler reception aside.<br>
<br>
But that’s arguably what we need — what we want is multiple exuberant 
crowd members of wildly varying ages yanked onstage for Dancing in the 
Dark, or Bruce’s mic-humping adult-yoga pose as Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out 
roared to life, or the cowbell- and horn-driven joy bomb of Johnny 99.<br>
<br>
“Columbus!” roared the Boss deep into the night. “Do! You! Have! Any! 
Thing! Left!?” We did, and so did he, and the whoa-oh-oh’ing and light 
groping began anew.<br>
<br>
We shut it down with Shout! — yes, the Shout! from Animal House, and 
probably your wedding — though getting a little softer now was not an 
option.</div>

 BY MEIERT AVIS<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN “BRILLIANT DISGUISE”</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
It’s my birthday, October 7th 1987.<br>
<br>
I am in a phone booth outside a crab shack off the New Jersey Turnpike 
begging some Wall Street guy for mercy. Nowadays of course one would 
know better, but this was way before they took the gloves off and 
destroyed the global economy with a controlled demolition of derivative 
fraud.  You may not remember phone booths, but they were everywhere 
before cell phone. This one was useless, its plastic half dome did 
nothing to keep the rain off, especially when you are literally on your 
knees begging for mercy.<br>
<br>
His  wife had agreed to rent the kitchen of her mansion as our location.
  Wall Street had just come back from a business trip and freaked out 
when his wife told him that Springsteen and a film crew were coming for 
breakfast. He was having none of it. His wife and I worked on him in 
turns. She was a nice woman and a huge Bruce fan. He clearly didn’t give
 a damn.<br>
<br>
“You don’t understand what the effect of this is going to be,  I am on 
my knees begging you to reconsider, please… its my birthday ….. please 
reconsider…..”<br>
<br>
At the same time I could hear his wife pleading with him in the 
background.  Eventually he just hangs up on me, leaving me on my knees, 
his dial tone dead  in my ear, as the trucks on the turnpike steamed 
through the Jersey rain.<br>
<br>
It’s now 8pm, the night before the shoot. The NY teamsters are already loaded up for their 6 AM call. We are proper fucked.<br>
<br>
“Is that me baby or just a brilliant disguise”<br>
<br>
 <strong class="text-strong">Two months earlier, late summer 1987.</strong><br>
<br>
I get one of those dream phone calls out of the blue. It’s Jon Landau 
asking me to go to New York and meet Springsteen to pitch ideas for a 
video for the first single from the new album, “Brilliant Disguise”.<br>
<br>
I had been a Springsteen fan since since first hearing him sing the line
 “..  and the elephants dance real funky”  against Garry Tallent’s  daft
 tuba part on “Wild Billy’s Circus Story” in 1973.  .<br>
<br>
Here I have to confess that I had shot two videos with Nils Lofgren’s  
for his Flip ” album in 1985. The less said about them the better, and I
 have to assume that Bruce had never seen them.  Nils is a guitar genius
 in his own right, eclipsed by  the shadow of a giant, or two. One good 
thing that came out of that experience was a day climbing in the Wicklow
 mountains with Nils.  We climbed Mullacor and looked down into 
Glendalough, the Omphalos, navel of the world.<br>
<br>
Now it all makes perfect sense to me, as I understand that Ireland is a 
magical microcosm of the rest of the world, the meta-universe in a sod 
of turf. Back then I didn’t know that that  Co. Wicklow was the 
spiritual mini-me of New Jersey, and Bray was Asbury Park. Fossetts’ 
Circus had the same mangy characters.  Springsteen is half Irish.  
Madame Marie’s father was a traveler from Tinahealy way.<br>
<br>
I had always dreamed of running off with the circus. Now was my chance.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"> Background</strong><br>
<br>
By ’87 Bruce was the greatest rock artist in the world. He had retreated
 from public view following the record breaking “Born in The USA” albums
 and tours.  “Brilliant Disguise” was to be the first single from his 
new record. Feature film legends Brian de Palma and  John Sales had shot
 previous Springsteen videos. Everyone and his monkey wanted to shoot 
the new videos.  This was a a life changing opportunity for a director 
fresh off the boat. The only chance I had was to to come up with a 
perfect and unexpected video concept that was true to the song, the 
singer, and the times.<br>
<br>
I do a lot of research and strategic thinking about videos. The choice 
of this dark, introspective song as the first single was a clue to 
Springsteen’s frame of mind. He clearly wasn’t interested in going head 
to head with  his prior work, especially “Born in the USA”, which had 
paced Michael Jackson’s Thriller with 7 top ten singles.   This choice 
of lead single was a position statement to a worldwide  audience who saw
 Bruce as a rock and roll god. The human cannon ball was now back on 
earth, beginning over. The lyrics were intensely psychological and 
personal, a total departure from the archetype rich, mythological 
American narrative song cycles of his past.<br>
<br>
 <strong class="text-strong">The Treatment</strong><br>
<br>
For me the treatment writing process starts with getting rid of as many 
blind alleys as possible. Strip out the unlikely, the unworkable, the 
unoriginal, and what remains is what you have to start from. The clues 
were there.  If Springsteen had wanted a story video he would choose 
Sales or any number of great movie directors to shoot it. The new album 
was billed as a solo project without the official E Street Band, so he 
wouldn’t want a band performance driven video. Visual effects were out 
of place. I don’t usually like masks and theatrics in videos, and I 
really don’t do well directing videos with mimed soap opera narrative 
and “illustrated radio” in general.<br>
<br>
It was rumored that Springsteen wasn’t comfortable with the artifice of 
the video production process itself.  That narrowed down the 
possibilities, and left me with nothing.<br>
<br>
I go to work on the complex lyrics. A video should serve the song first,
 then the artist, and finally marketing. Springsteen was using song 
writing as therapy, a tool for personal growth. The lyrics were about 
marriage, but also a metaphor in the wider context of his public image. 
The song is about deception, doubt, and ultimately staring down one’s 
fear of the shadow lurking behind one’s persona, both onstage and in 
private. With Springsteen everything is connected, inside and out, this 
is what makes him a great  artist and a great man.<br>
<br>
The trigger to the video concept was in the choruses:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">So when you look at me<br>
<br>
you better look hard and look twice<br>
<br>
Is that me baby<br>
<br>
or just a brilliant disguise?</em><br>
<br>
Springsteen is a master of song structure. Among other techniques, he 
will sometimes subtly change the chorus to advance the narrative, or 
peel away its meaning to reveal a new one. The words of each chorus can 
have small but progressive differences. The phrasing remains the same, 
so you don’t consciously realize what he is doing. The chorus in 
“Brilliant Disguise” starts as a defensive,  heavily armored question to
 a partner, but ends as a narcissist’s dark mirror reflecting his own 
doubts back on himself. Providing the soul-birthing realization that you
 are unable to fool yourself, without someone else there equally willing
 and able to be to fooled by you.<br>
<br>
“Brilliant Disguise” is a very Jungian lyric.<br>
<br>
I imagined watching the man as he wrote and sang the song for the first 
time to a lover. This was one of the great performers, doing an autopsy 
on both of the corpses in the relationship, with words as his scalpel.<br>
<br>
So what to pitch? Sometimes all the director needs to do is get himself 
and his bag of tricks out of the way. I only had to provide a safe 
creative performance environment for Springsteen, and then have the 
camera relentlessly scrutinize his face for the truth, just as a 
deceived lover does. Catch the tension between deception and honesty in 
the lyrics shattering the singer’s persona. Catch his growing 
recognition of the darkness inside as it plays out on the iconic 
landscape of his own face. Watch the brilliant disguises being cut away 
right in front to us.<br>
<br>
Who in the audience could resist the opportunity to peer right into 
Bruce’s eyes, and ultimately recognize themselves there. What I was 
watching in my mind was one long camera move, starting as the POV of the
 woman to whom the song is addressed, then imperceptibly becoming a 
mirror in which Springsteen confronts his own part in their inability to
 love.<br>
<br>
I knew instantly I was now officially a f#cking genius, and that this 
anti-concept was the one that would unlock the project for me. I was 
going to pitch Bruce’s face, to his face.  I instinctively felt that 
Springsteen would love the idea. It was ballsy, it had not yet been done
 as far as I knew.  It was true to the song and to the man at that 
moment. It turned every  expectation its head, would make everything 
else on MTV look overproduced, and would free him from the impossible 
expectations of topping Born in The USA, which by now was becoming a 
prison of doubled irony and misinterpretation. There would be no way to 
escape the meaning and truth of this song.<br>
<br>
Best of all the final lines of the song:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">God have mercy on the man who doubts what he’s sure of.</em><br>
<br>
… would  be delivered in an extreme close up, become the dark redemption
 of the video, rather than wasted on some throwaway shot of an ending.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Live Vocals</strong><br>
<br>
Looking at his earlier videos, I got the feeling that lip syncing wasn’t
 Bruce’s strong suite, and this resulted in the video performances 
feeling less authentic than the song itself.  This was probably where 
his discomfort with the video process came from. A fake performance 
would be a fatal problem with this concept, as there was nowhere to hide
 and the disguise had to be brilliant. I had shot a live vocal video 
with Mike Scott of The Waterboys.  I wondered if shooting Bruce’s vocals
 live might be viable, especially given the one take visual. Most album 
vocals are not recorded in one take, even on “live” albums.   There 
would also be some technical challenges as I did not want a microphone 
in front of his face, but hey, this was normal in the film industry and 
we had boom operators and directional mikes.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Letters at 3AM</strong><br>
<br>
The idea for the setting came easily.  Michael Ventura, great, largely 
unsung American writer, writes a a series of essays called Letters at 3 
AM, then for the LA Weekly. Conscious writing on many subjects.  Out of 
that title came the image of Springsteen,  writing the song downstairs 
in his kitchen in New Jersey at 3 AM, while his wife sleeps alone 
upstairs. The kitchen was archetypal, everything good and bad in family 
verbal interaction happens in the kitchen.  For the set dressing I saw 
post-war mythological Americana, formica and aluminum.  In some way it 
is also Springsteen’s parent’s kitchen. Certainly this was an older and 
wiser Bruce Springsteen we were going to shoot.<br>
<br>
 <strong class="text-strong">The Pitch</strong><br>
<br>
I get on a plane from LA to New York with a light heart, looking forward
 to meeting the man. It’s my first visit to New York, and its visually 
overwhelming from the bridge on. NY still gives me vertigo every time.<br>
<br>
The taxi drops me outside Jon Landau and Bruce’s office.<br>
<br>
To my surprise Bruce is in the elevator when I get in. White T Shirt, 
blue jeans, boots, every inch Bruce Springsteen, in person. He is at a 
disadvantage, having no idea what I look like, but we work it out on the
 way up to Landau’s office. Springsteen in person is exactly what you 
would expect from his lyrics: warm, direct, funny, perceptive and 
gracious. Thankfully his self-confidence is infectious.<br>
<br>
When I have to talk to more than one stranger at a time my Social 
Anxiety Disorder kicks in and I suffer an unpleasant dissociative tunnel
 vision effect. It’s quite trippy but not conducive to verbal 
communication, especially combined with its matching acoustic FX. Many 
people have the same problem.<br>
<br>
Landau, Barbara Carr, and Jack Rovner were waiting in the office for us. Their warmth and humor dissolved my discomfort.<br>
<br>
The pitch went well. For once I knew how to describe each shot. This 
didn’t take long. as there was only one. My understanding of the 
psychology behind the lyrics was accurate. Springsteen jumped on the 
idea of shooting the vocals live, rather than having to lip-sync  Both 
Rovner and Springsteen shared the same general strategic agenda for the 
video. They wanted to keep it as simple as possible. I had read their 
minds from a distance. Bruce embraced how performing the song in one 
uninterrupted take would leave him, and the viewer, with nowhere to 
hide. They even agreed to shoot in black and white with Carlo Di Palma 
as DP.<br>
<br>
Next thing, I am back on the sidewalk with my head in the clouds, with some first world cinematic problems to sort out.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Math</strong><br>
<br>
I knew I wanted Bruce sitting in a real kitchen, and the camera move was
 going to be defined by optical physics and the location itself. I 
wanted the shot to end on an extreme close up of Bruce’s eyes.  The on 
screen zoom isn’t a purist’s tool, but it would be necessary to get the 
extreme close up at the end. The change in focal length would also 
change the compression of the image and subtly transform the feel of the
 viewer’s experience from someone in the room’s POV, to a private 
introspective self scrutiny.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Carlo Di Palma</strong><br>
<br>
I had researched Carlo Di Palma’s choreographed takes for Woody Allen, 
and was a fan of Antonioni’s Red Dawn. Di Palma was an expert at 
shooting long scenes, avoiding coverage and cutting. Carlo also had a 
reputation for liking zoom lenses, rather than the primes that many 
fashionable DP’s are more comfortable with. He was now living and 
shooting in New York, and had a solid New York crew.<br>
<br>
I meet up with Carlo in the Algonquin Hotel.  The man is a legend, and 
like Springsteen, has no pretense about him. His father had been a 
camera operator, and he had grown up on the set watching his father at 
work. Carlo had lived though the  glory days of Italian cinema. He had 
shot “Blow Up”, a film that created a new way of telling stories.  That 
was just the beginning of his life’s work.<br>
<br>
I am in awe, but he graciously takes me seriously, and our music video 
project to heart. Carlo approached it as a scene from a movie. He wanted
 to understand the lyrics, the performer’s motivation, as well as the 
wider context. He must have wondered why I boarded a single shot video, 
but kept a straight face throughout.<br>
<br>
There are two types of DP. The first kind asks: “so where does the 
camera go?”. This can be a threatening question, and always floors me 
for a moment, especially after only a few hours sleep.  A handy reflex 
answer to this question is:  ”Give me a few minutes to block the scene, 
and we’ll work it out”.<br>
<br>
The second kind of DP actually directs the photography. Meaning he takes
 creative responsibility for all aspects of the image itself, and 
becomes your partner and best friend on the set.<br>
<br>
Carlo is clearly a real DP, and a generous collaborator. I leave the image in his hands.<br>
<br>
We work out the math: what speed the camera move needed to be, what kind
 of crane and track we would need, what focal lengths would be 
appropriate, and therefore how large the kitchen would have to be for 
the equipment and crew required to make the shot.<br>
<br>
The logical answer was “we had better build a set”, but instinctively I 
know Springsteen is going to feel and perform the song way better in a 
“real world” kitchen setting. We just had to find one large enough.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Scouting New Jerse</strong>y<br>
<br>
One of the best parts of the director’s job is that you get to visit all
 kinds of places and people that you would never see otherwise.<br>
<br>
Ben Dossett and I  scout locations all over New Jersey. A multi-day 
caravan of mansions, schools, and hospitals. Eventually we find a 
mansion with a large kitchen that could just about work. The woman who 
owned the house was a fan and happy to have Bruce come over.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the budget was hammered out. It costs a lot to look this 
cheap. To put it another way, once you start down the one shot path 
there is zero tolerance for error of any kind. You have to budget for 
perfection. Which brings me back to that dial tone.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">8 pm, the night before the shoot.</strong><br>
<br>
I am in a phone booth by the Jersey Turnpike, seriously considering suicide.<br>
<br>
The location has fallen through.  What do you do?  Ben calls everyone we
 can reach in production in NY to see if they know somewhere in the 
Tri-State that might work. Eventually, a cop car pulls in and we explain
 the problem.  The cop suggests calling the National Guard and gives us 
their number. Not a terrible idea, especially as by now they are about 
the only people still answering the phone. Of course they turn out to be
 fans and within two hours we were standing in an old kitchen in an 
empty officer’s house on a mothballed army base.<br>
<br>
It was perfect in every way.<br>
<br>
The huge kitchen opened directly into the even larger dining room. Total
 security, loads of parking for the trucks, no valuables to damage, no 
neighbors to annoy. A blizzard of phone calls follows. We fax out new 
call sheets from the base. Suicidal ideation slipped into the shadows to
 lurk for another day.<br>
<br>
That was by far the worst crisis I have ever had on a production.  Music
 video production is like running a circus, except each show is the 
first show. You are driving a fresh cast of clowns down the midway, 
while the clown car falls apart beneath you. It can get very scary, 
especially on location.<br>
<br>
You have to be a self-destructive, risk taking clown to survive it. That
 night I learned that almost anything can be fixed if you just don’t 
give up. Since then, when the wheels fall off,  I remember that night, 
and honk the clown car horn. Don’t ever give up.<br>
<br>
We get back to the motel at 2:30am to find the manager has barricaded 
himself into his office, with our room keys, and passed out.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">The Shoot</strong><br>
<br>
The shoot was initially about solving the human and technical 
practicalities of the four and a half minute move. I wanted the camera 
to have no presence at all, the move so slow as to be unnoticed. It’s a 
crane move. Jibbing down as it dollies in with an imperceptible zoom 
nested in the move.<br>
<br>
Carlo lit the shot in a classic cinematic chiaroscuro style, a single 
key in the only possible place. There was no eye light, yet there is 
light in the eyes. There’s no crane or camera shadow, yet the camera is 
right in Bruce’s face at the end. Simple genius.<br>
<br>
The crew were all experienced feature people and enjoy the challenge of 
making difficult crane shots. This one was, and still is, unique.  To 
make the shot a dozen people would have to do everything right, in 
perfect sync with each other, for every moment of four and a half 
minutes.<br>
<br>
Bruce’s performances were almost all perfect.<br>
<br>
The rest of us struggled to do everything right. The first challenge is 
the stability and smoothness of the move.  The crane is a massive steel 
girder balanced on a pivot, the camera on one end heavily 
counterbalanced with lead weights on the other. Its a beast pushed by 
two, but its mass makes it surprisingly forgiving once on the move. Then
 this trebuchet has to be brought to an imperceptible stop on a dime, 
inches from the performer’s eyes.<br>
<br>
The camera meanwhile is gently descending and adjusting on two axes.  
Focus has to be corrected continually. Accurate focus is critical, 
especially on Bruce’s eyes at the end of the move. Consider that the 
f-stop is wide open for maximum Bokeh, the depth of field is less than 
an inch or two, and Bruce is inevitably moving back and forth as he 
sings.  Doing it in one shot, without cuts, had seemed like a good idea,
 but I now fully understood the risk we were taking. Up on the high wire
 without a net.<br>
<br>
The physical and psychological tension in the room was palpable. 
Everyone in the camera, grip, and lighting crews had something at stake 
in each take. The live vocals added a whole other electrifying dimension
 to the room . The crew let out a sigh of relief and applauded at the 
end of each good take.  Springsteen picked up on this energy 
immediately, a master in his element as a live performer, not a 
lip-syncing muppet.<br>
<br>
Toby Scott, Bruce’s sound engineer was beginning to relax. Landau was 
affably inscrutable, but I have learned that this is a good sign. Terry 
McGovern gave me a smile, and suddenly all was well in the world.<br>
<br>
We shot twenty four takes, with a just a few good for camera. Bruce nailed it on most.<br>
<br>
I like directing best when I can help the artist re-define the lyrics. 
Just a smile or a glance  in the right place can change the whole 
meaning of a verse. As we got into it, Springsteen re-interpreted the 
song in various ways, ranging from sadly humorous to bitter and angry.  
Like any good story it improved with the telling, even though the words 
remained the same.  Almost thirty years down the road if you watch 
Springsteen sing “Brilliant Disguise” live, with Patti Scailfa’s 
harmonies, the song reveals depths of human fragility. It’s no longer a 
breakup song, but has become a compassionate and very moving love song.<br>
<br>
As for the video, it stands the test of time. When I watch it,  its just
 me and Bruce face to face. The spell never breaks. There is no clue 
that there are thirty people in the room and a ton of metal inching its 
way down the track towards Bruce.  Film making.<br>
<br>
There is no feeling in the world quite like wrapping a shoot when its gone well.<br>
<br>

Editing the video was an unexpected challenge.  Nothing to cut,  just 
one choice to make. Of the four or five takes that were good for camera,
 each vocal was a unique interpretation, so selecting the best involved 
dropping others that would never be seen again. In the end I choose the 
take where Springsteen’s self-awareness was most present and the camera 
was least present.  It would be great to see it remastered in HD. There 
are performance details on the negative that have never been seen.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">MTV</strong><br>
<br>
Tom Freston and John Sykes dug it. MTV played the hell out of it. The 
video confounded public expectations, as planned, and yet still 
connected with the MTV audience. It opened up the genre to all kinds of 
more artful videos. I went on to shoot several videos more with Bruce.<br>
<br>
Flashing forward to 2013, this video could probably never happen now. 
Record companies like to keep artists and directors apart. Video 
concepts are filtered through commissioners and marketing departments, 
subject to commercial priorities.<br>
<br>
Risky ideas are safely disposed of before they get to the artist. As a 
result, directors now tend to write to target marketing objectives 
rather than serve the song itself. It’s also a bad time for rock music 
in general. Rock bands are expensive to maintain compared to rap or solo
 artists. Rock music is more expensive to record. To a large degree 
popular taste is molded by this kind of cost analysis.<br>
<br>
Today Springsteen might well have been dropped before Born in the USA was ever recorded.<br>
<br>
Bruce is one of the most human of beings I have had the good fortune to meet among the lost clowns and freaks on the Midway.</div>

Bruce Springsteen and his E Street Band shook the rafters of Time Warner Cable Arena Saturday night.<br>
 <br>
Bruce Springsteen takes the stage like a boxer entering his corner 
before a fight. He paces on the balls of his feet around a little pool 
of spotlight, shaking out his shoulders, hunching as if deciding what 
pattern of punches he should throw.<br>
<br>
He leaves alone, still hunched but perhaps with fatigue, after a 
hypnotic solo encore sung at a pump organ: “Dream, Baby, Dream,” which 
followed his perennial appeal to help a local food charity. (Second 
Harvest collected from concertgoers in the lobby.)<br>
<br>
In between those moments Saturday night came three hours and 13 minutes 
of social consciousness, roof-raising rock ‘n’ roll, unexpected 
rarities, giddy audience involvement, fervent preaching and a long 
monologue that hushed almost every member of the capacity crowd at 
Charlotte’s Time Warner Cable Arena. He spoke then of losing friends in 
Vietnam, before poignantly pairing “The Wall” and “Born in the U.S.A.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen, who’ll turn 65 in September, doesn’t make things easy on 
old-timers in the audience. He delivers a set without intermission and 
never leaves the stage himself. He offers only a few moments for weary 
legs to rest before pulling us out of our seats again, often building a 
quiet song to a towering climax.<br>
<br>
And his 16-piece band never lets up in intensity, even when it lowers 
the volume. Max Weinberg, his surgical gaze altered by a small smile now
 and again, hammers the drums like someone half his age. The five horn 
players lay down a sound reminiscent of the old Muscle Shoals section on
 Atlantic Records.<br>
<br>
Guitarists Nils Lofgren, Tom Morello (who took a solo with his teeth) 
and Springsteen lead the attack. The set list makes use of a 
glockenspiel, tuba, violin and accordion. (Yes, accordions rock, as 
Charlie Giordano’s work on “Death to My Home Town” proved.)<br>
<br>
Don’t take the term “set list” too literally, though. Of the 30 numbers 
on the program, nine came from requests on signs that fans held up: 
“Brown Eyed Girl,” “Louie Louie” (apparently a tour premiere) and 
“Mustang Sally” (ditto), with which he honored the 50th anniversary of 
that vehicle.<br>
<br>
The crowd approved of everything, from the opening number – “Iceman,” a 
song he had never played on tour with the E Street Band – to the giddy, 
extended cover of “Shout” that preceded his closing solo.<br>
<br>
It passed him overhead as he crowdsurfed halfway across the arena floor 
toward the stage, cheered as he invited “backup singers” and dancers to 
the stage, roared as he hoisted a little girl on his shoulders after 
letting her sing a chorus of “Waiting on a Sunny Day.”<br>
<br>
The show was one of just 17 on the U.S. leg of the “High Hopes” tour, 
which reaches Raleigh Thursday. It swung from the full-out party 
atmosphere of “Cadillac Ranch” to feverish empathy with hard-up folks in
 “The Ghost of Tom Joad.”<br>
<br>
Violence simmers beneath the surfaces of many Springsteen songs. The 
narrator of “Jack of All Trades” says in one verse that “It feels like 
the world’s gonna change, and we’ll start caring for each other like 
Jesus said we might” and later contemplates bankers who’ve fed on his 
misery: “If I had me a gun, I’d find the bastards and shoot ‘em on 
sight.” One of Morello’s guitars bears the motto “Arm the homeless.”<br>
<br>
You had to wonder Saturday how many people chanting along with the 
chorus of “Born in the U.S.A.” and thrusting “We’re No. 1”-style fingers
 in the air realize it’s a catalog of America’s failed dreams, not an 
anthem to our greatness. This rock ‘n’ roll preacher brings a message of
 empathy for everyone, but he knows empathy alone won’t bring change.</div>

April 22, 2014 <br>
Pittsburg Post</strong><br>
<br>
As you may well know, Bruce Springsteen’s right-hand man Steve Van Zandt
 is off filming his gangster series “Lilyhammer” in the nether regions 
of Norway, leaving a big fat hole in the E Street Band.<br>
<br>
The Boss has filled that slot with one mean gunslinger in Rage Against 
the Machine’s Tom Morello, who’s providing such an electric shock he 
might as well just become yet another member, swelling the E Street Band
 to a proper Boulevard of — what — 20?<br>
<br>
Pittsburgh got its taste of E Street Rage Tuesday night at the Consol 
Energy Center in the Boss’ first trip back in two years. This tour comes
 on the heels of “High Hopes,” a middling collection of odds and ends 
that doesn’t require much of Bruce’s attention. So, Springsteen and the 
newly Hall of Fame-inducted E Street Band were free to cut loose with 
whatever.<br>
<br>
This one started with a fury, as they hit the stage at 8:15 with a 
version of “Working for the Clampdown,” that made The Clash anthem sound
 more like a party song. Bruce trading vocals with Morello and looking 
like he was wearing one of the Rage Against the Machine guitarist’s 
military-style shirts, a nice change from the formal vest.<br>
<br>
Pittsburgh’s blue-collar history and industrial landscape always seems 
to put the Boss in “Darkness” mode, so he went right into a roof-raising
 version of “Badlands” and then into “Johnny 99” (from “Nebraska”) that 
the five-piece horn section, featuring Jake Clemons, turned into a wild 
New Orleans brass wake for Johnny.<br>
<br>
He would return to that theme later with “The Promised Land” and another
 scorching version of “Youngstown,” with Morello firing the furnace.<br>
<br>
“High Hopes” was handed to Morello, who brought the new element of a 
shredding guitar solo with his teeth in addition to the Rage-y wah-wah 
riff. Their stellar moment together, of course, was on “The Ghost of Tom
 Joad,” where E Street meets Rage in a tour de force with a driving duet
 and guitar duel that Morello slays with aural pyrotechnics and 
scratching metal.<br>
<br>
As always, it was a brilliant three-hour mix of powerful, playful and 
joyously rocking. There was a rockabilly section with “Stand On It” 
going into a “Seven Nights to Rock” that featured a hilarious teasing 
exchange with wife Patti Scialfa doing the math on just how many nights 
they were allowed to rock.<br>
<br>
His backward stage dive on “Hungry Heart” took on a comic twist as he made his way back to the stage with a Bruce blow-up doll.<br>
<br>
“Someone out there is a master of balloon art!” he yelled, having also noticed the blow-up yellow duck as well.<br>
<br>
The crowd sign-request segment was less than top shelf, featuring a pair
 of love-song outtakes from “Tracks”: “I Wanna Be With You” and “Back in
 Your Arms,” which did come with an impassioned soul-belting vocal.<br>
<br>
The specter of 9/11 hovered over in the bittersweet rockers “Lonesome 
Day” and “Mary’s Place” and, of course, the anthem “The Rising,” going 
right into “Land of Hope and Dreams.” “The Wall,” with an idea credited 
to Joe Grushecky, was a somber trip to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, 
paired with a pummeling version of protest anthem “Born in the U.S.A.” 
that climaxed with fireworks from Morello and drummer Max Weinberg.<br>
<br>
When Joe Grushecky and son Johnny arrived in the encore for “Light of 
Day” and “Frankie Fell in Love,” it was a rock ’n’ roll orchestra of 
seven guitars across the stage. (He announced that he will join the 
Houserockers again at Soldiers and Sailors on May 22-23 and said tickets
 would go on sale today.)<br>
<br>
They even stayed out there for the lights-up combo of “Born to Run” and 
“Dancing in the Dark,” filling the stage with dancing fans.<br>
<br>
As the set raged on into hysterical versions of “Tenth Avenue Freezeout”
 and “Shout” (it’s funny to think of Tom Morello playing “Shout”!) — 
with Springsteen climbing the piano, shimmying down the mike stand and 
running back into the crowd — his energy hit that point of super human.<br>
<br>
Back when he was a skinny young guy with curly hair playing the Stanley,
 people would marvel at his three-hour energy. He would do that bit 
about being a “prisoner of rock’ n’ roll.”<br>
<br>
Now, at 64 — 64! — he still does and he’s still living out that life sentence, praise be to the gods of rock ’n’ roll!</div>
