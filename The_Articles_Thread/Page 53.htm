<br>
June 16, 2006|<br>
By Greg Kot, <br>
<br>
CHICAGO TRIBUNE</strong><br>
<br>
Had this been one of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band tours, the place would've been packed to bursting.<br>
But with his rock persona on temporary hiatus, Springsteen faced a sea 
of empty seats Tuesday at the First Midwest Bank Amphitheater in Tinley 
Park. The 11,000-seat pavilion was barely half full, and the 
17,000-capacity lawn was barren.<br>
<br>
<br>
It was less a commentary on Springsteen's still-considerable magnetism 
than on his recent artistic choices. On the current tour, he's focusing 
on music from his latest album, "We Shall Overcome: The Seeger 
Sessions," an acoustic outing covering songs associated with 87-year-old
 folk laureate Pete Seeger.<br>
Sure, the idea of a rock icon dusting off tunes that your grandfather's 
generation chanted at union rallies might sound a bit suspect. Combine 
that with the prospect of seeing a bunch of folkies playing in what 
Springsteen described as "a big black box outside of Chicago," and no 
wonder the majority of the singer's fans said, "No, thanks." Clearly, 
the choice of venue was a major deterrent to a show more suited to an 
intimate theater. Memo to the Boss: How about multiple nights at the 
Auditorium Theatre or even the Charter One Pavilion on Northerly Island?
 And, while you're rethinking things, what's with the gaudy $92 ticket 
for a show ostensibly all about folk populism and the working man?<br>
But take it from one skeptic who harbored many of the same doubts: The no-show Springsteen faithful missed a good one.<br>
The graying but still boyishly energetic singer took the "Seeger 
Sessions" songs to a deeper place, and brought a zeal to this 
performance that stamped it as a keeper. Like last year's solo tour, in 
which he took huge chances in reinventing many of his songs, the new 
show finds Springsteen in high spirits, his joy infectious as he 
explored the various strands of American music that preceded rock 'n' 
roll. With a 16-piece band that combined accordion, banjo, fiddles, 
guitars, piano, pedal steel, brass, voices and percussion, he blended 
Dixieland and Appalachia, swing and gospel, Celtic jigs and Tex-Mex 
two-steps.<br>
Hurricane Katrina and the fate of New Orleans were fresh on 
Springsteen's mind. Only seven weeks ago, he had launched this tour at 
the city's Jazz and Heritage festival, and witnessed the storm's 
devastation firsthand. "We owe the city a debt," he said. "We need to 
bear witness." And then he joined a time-honored folk tradition by 
updating Blind Alfred Reed's Depression-era blues "How Can a Poor Man 
Stand Such Times and Live?" with three newly written verses very much of
 the moment.<br>
"Them who's got, got out of town," Springsteen sang of the Katrina disaster. "And them who ain't got left to drown."<br>
He read "When the Saints Go Marching In" not as jaunty celebration but 
as an elegy. He zeroed in on words that we have probably heard dozens, 
if not hundreds, of times, but never quite appreciated for the horror 
they contain. In its images of blood-red moons and a sun that refuses to
 shine, here was a redemption song like no other.<br>
<br>
The relevance of Seeger's "Bring Them Home (If You Love Your Uncle Sam)"
 and the civil rights anthem "Eyes on the Prize" couldn't be missed. The
 more subtle but no less urgent message about broken promises in "Pay Me
 My Money Down" was just as stirring, even as it was refashioned into a 
wild-eyed zydeco whirl.<br>
For relief and release, there were hootenanny-style bashers such as "Old
 Dan Tucker," "O Mary Don't You Weep" and "Jesse James." Springsteen 
also had a blast recasting his own songs: "Ramrod" drove south of the 
border with accordion pumping, "Johnny 99" became a polyrhythmic Creole 
swoon, and "Open All Night" was reincarnated as swinging big-band 
boogie. This was music meant to be shared and sung over drinks and on 
the dance floor, with horns blaring and guitars thrashing.<br>
Springsteen turned a bunch of enthusiastic strangers in his audience 
into an impromptu choir and a community of co-conspirators, much as Pete
 Seeger had done at his historic 1963 Carnegie Hall concert. Even as war
 loomed abroad and racist skirmishes flourished at home, Seeger 
understood the value not just of protest songs, but also of nursery 
rhymes, singalongs, melodies and tall tales.<br>
Back then, Seeger marveled at how folk artists such as Malvina Reynolds,
 Tom Paxton and a new kid named Bob Dylan were following in the 
footsteps of his peer Woody Guthrie and writing "songs about everything 
that happens . . . every imaginable subject." These were singers who 
turned the political into the personal, and the personal into the 
universal. Seeger sang their songs as if they were news bulletins from 
the front lines of the human experience.<br>
<br>
That's the impulse that turned Springsteen, a pretty decent chronicler 
of the human condition in his own right, into a born-again folkie. By 
invoking Seeger, he's not dusting off a sepia-tinged photograph of a 
nearly forgotten past. Instead, like the master, he sees folk music as a
 rocking and rolling commentary on who we are now and where we're going 
next.</div>

<br>
June 23, 1988<br>
By David Hinckley, <br>
New York Daily News.</strong><br>
<br>
NEW YORK — Patti Scialfa, now reportedly dating the boss in Bruce 
Springsteen`s E Street Band, is a longtime Jersey Shore backup singer 
who readily admits her big break came four years ago when Bruce put her 
in his band.<br>
She`s having her big media break now, however. With Springsteen 
officially separated from his wife of three years, Julianne Phillips, 
Scialfa and Bruce have reportedly become an item.<br>
<br>
As recently as last month`s Madison Square Garden concerts, however, the
 pleasant and modest Scialfa was just another band member, often 
wandering into the backstage ``hospitality suite`` (tables of popcorn 
and other carnival food) to chat amiably with friends and strangers.<br>
It was June 25, 1984, when Springsteen invited her to join the band, on 
the eve of its staggeringly successful ``Born in the U.S.A.`` tour. She 
had four days to learn the marathon show, but then, she didn`t have a 
big featured part. Her only brief solo came on ``Cover Me,`` though she 
shared Springsteen`s microphone on a couple of songs.<br>
Still, it was a dream come true. She had auditioned for one of 
Springsteen`s bands in the late `60s, when she was in high school, only 
to be turned down because she was too young. So she completed school and
 took ``the usual`` jobs at the shore while she worked toward a singing 
career.<br>
She went on the road with Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes for a 
while, as well as Jukes offshoot band La Bamba and the Hubcaps (who are 
playing with Springsteen on the current tour). When Springsteen 
rediscovered her, she was 32 and singing with Cats on a Smooth Surface, 
the regular Sunday night band at Asbury Park`s Stone Pony.<br>
``See,`` she told an interviewer in 1984, ``you can meet a nice guy in a bar.``<br>
Actually, a story that circulated in mid-1984 had Springsteen 
discovering her as a waitress and impulsively asking her to join the 
band. It`s not exactly true, but it was far too charming for anyone to 
deny. Or even discourage.<br>
Springsteen said during the ``Born in the U.S.A.`` tour that adding 
Scialfa to the band, despite her minor musical role, represented a major
 change in the band`s chemistry. With a woman on the stage and on the 
road, the whole ``male bonding`` process of the band changed.<br>
Springsteen had used women on stage before. Francine Daniels and Delores
 Holmes sang in his early bands, and violinist Suki Lahav played in the E
 Street Band during the mid-`70s.<br>
But Scialfa was something different. With her red hair and striking 
figure, she, like sax player Clarence Clemons, was almost more important
 as a physical presence. Thus it was considered a major change for this 
year`s<br>
``Tunnel of Love`` tour when Scialfa started the show in Clemons`traditional position on Springsteen`s right.<br>
She was also playing guitar, an enterprise she modestly said she was learning as fast as she could.<br>
When the band comes back from Europe in late July, however, presumably 
the first questions she hears will not be about her progress with the 
six-string.</div>

<br>
August 24, 2012|<br>
Stuart Levine | <br>
Variety</strong><br>
<br>
For anyone approaching 63 years, doctors say your bones start to creak a
 little more, the hair gets whiter and eyeglass prescriptions grow 
stronger. What's not supposed to happen is that you play four-hour 
concerts in packed football stadiums, with nary a sign of slowing down 
anytime soon. And yet, this reversal of the aging process is being 
documented night after night in countries all over the world. It's 
happening to Bruce Springsteen, who has long held the mantle of rock 'n'
 roll's greatest showman. Only a few weeks ago in Helsinki, during the 
European leg of his "Wrecking Ball" tour, Springsteen -- already known 
for his marathon shows -- hit the four-hour mark on stage for the first 
time ever. In a career that dates back to when iconic talent scout John 
Hammond asked Springsteen to audition in his office in 1972 and quickly 
signed the young singer-songwriter to Columbia Records, this monumental 
event represented another milestone that only added to a legacy filled 
with concerts that have achieved legendary status over time. My 
Springsteen fanaticism doesn't reach all the way back to the early '70s,
 but I still vividly remember hearing "Born to Run" later on in the 
decade -- I was a little late for the Newsweek and Time magazine covers 
-- and understanding that the Bob Dylan comparisons were apt, but not 
entirely true. Dylan started out addressing political change for a 
war-torn generation while Springsteen was singing about the breezy life 
on the Jersey Shore. Springsteen, however, would soon harness the power 
of his lyrics to tackle huge issues -- presidential elections, Amnesty, 
poverty and the squeezing of the middle class, among several topics that
 would resonate with him -- and use his star wattage to give them light.
 But while Springsteen's influence clearly reaches the masses, his 
appeal to me has always been personal. Whether it's digesting the theme 
of a new album in the solitude of a quiet room or being pressed against 
the stage at a concert that had the potential to be among his greatest, 
his impact on my life has been undeniable. I've met lifelong friends at 
Springsteen-related events 30 years ago who are as close to me now as 
ever. Babies were born from couples who once bonded over "Thunder Road" 
or "Rosalita." Having attended 100-plus shows in cities strewn across 
the country, I can tell you I get as excited now in those anxious 
moments before Springsteen and his reconstituted E Street Band hit the 
stage as much as I did before that first show way back when. My friends 
and colleagues are separated into two categories: Those who understand 
and tolerate my obsession and those who view me as hopelessly mired in 
the past. But, as the recent shows at the Los Angeles Sports Arena 
proved, those who attend a Springsteen concert gain an understanding of 
what draws the diehards in. It's Springsteen's on-stage camaraderie with
 his band and the audience -- the playfulness, storytelling and 
boundless energy that never seem to evaporate, even when Father Time 
says the clock is ticking. How long will the carnival continue? It's 
impossible to say. I remember the Who, who famously proclaimed "hope I 
die before I get old," announcing its farewell tour about 25 years ago 
and now they're hitting the road again in support of "Quadrophenia." 
Springsteen is returning to Southern California on Dec. 4, at the Honda 
Center in Anaheim. There will be some who will be seeing him for the 
first time, and others for the 500th. That common bond runs deep. It may
 only be rock 'n' roll, but it matters in ways we can never imagine. 
Variety's Stuart Levine can recite the words to "The Wild, the Innocent 
and the E Street Shuffle" in his sleep.<br>

<br>
They are among the few who really call him boss--both the antics and the
 musicianship of the E Street Band are a major element in Bruce 
Springsteen`s four-hour marathons. But, thanks to the overwhelming 
fascination inspired by their leader, the E Streeters are frequently 
overlooked in all the excitement. Detailed information on them and their
 history is difficult to find, omitted from the wealth of printed 
material that has dealt with the Springsteen story and legend. T<br>
<br>
he following is a brief look at this extraordinary ensemble, considered to be one of the best rock and roll bands in history:<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Clarence ``Big Man`` Clemons</strong>,<br>
<br>
- saxophone, is almost as important an emblem of the E Street Band as 
the Boss. Musically, he`s not so important anymore; since the days of 
``Born to Run`` (Springsteen`s third album), the emphasis on saxophone 
in Springsteen`s music has gradually diminished. At the same time, 
Clemons` towering onstage persona as some sort of Springsteenian 
man-will-endure symbol has skyrocketed to the point where onstage 
nicknames such as``king of the world`` and ``master of the universe`` 
are less and less ironic. He always has figured prominently in 
Springsteen`s rambling stories, and, beginning with the ``Born in the 
U.S.A.`` tour slightly over a year ago, Springsteen has taken to 
climaxing renditions of ``Thunder Road`` by sailing across the stage and
 implanting a huge kiss on Clemons` lips. (``It just seemed the thing to
 do,`` Springsteen has said by way of explanation.) Clemons has his own 
group, the Red Bank Rockers, and has been more visible lately, thanks 
partly to a couple of appearances on David Letterman`s late night 
television talk show.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Roy Bittan,</strong> <br>
<br>
-piano, came on board right before ``Born to Run,`` replacing David 
Sancious. A flashy and deft keyboard artist with both rock and roll and 
Broadway roots, Bittan quickly became a key component of the Springsteen
 sound as well as a powerful concert performer. (His reworked live solos
 for ``Kitty`s Back,`` a jazzy classic from Springsteen`s second album, 
have a unique and exciting sound all their own.) In the same way that 
Springsteen`s music has moved away from the saxophone, the piano seems 
less important on later albums, including ``Born in the U.S.A.`` But 
Bittan`s magic fingers always get a rippling workout at any Springsteen 
concert.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Garry Tallent, <br>
<br>
-bass guitar</strong>, first teamed up with Springsteen in 1971, when 
the group was holding rehearsals in a garage. Quiet, stable and almost 
always onstage, he lends a solid, technically accomplished sound to the 
band, competent but not flashy. With Clemons, he is the only current 
band member to have played on all seven Boss albums and is somewhat 
renowned for his passion for Buddy Holly and his co-ownership of 
reputedly the largest rhythm and blues record collection on the East 
Coast.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Patti Scialfa, <br>
<br>
-vocalist</strong>, enjoys the distinction of being the first woman to 
break the once all-male bastion of the E Street Band, joining the group 
at the beginning of the ``Born in the U.S.A.`` tour. Critics complained 
at first that Springsteen didn`t seem to know how to use his new singer,
 but there was good reason--she was selected only days before the 
beginning of the tour. Like Springsteen, Scialfa is from New Jersey; 
earlier jobs included stints with Southside Johnny Lyon, a Jersey shore 
performer whom Springsteen has turned into a cult figure.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Nils Lofgren, <br>
<br>
-guitar</strong>, didn`t join the E Street Band until the beginning of 
the ``Born in the U.S.A.`` tour. His was one of the more coveted as well
 as thankless tasks in rock history--to replace longtime Springsteen 
guitarist and alter ego, ``Miami`` Steve Van Zandt, who left more than a
 year ago to form his own band. Still, observers felt that if Van Zandt 
had to go, Lofgren was an ideal choice. Long underappreciated, the 
talented guitarist was responsible for a string of critically admired, 
commercially unsuccessful albums, first with a short-lived band called 
Grin and later as a solo artist. (He also played with Neil Young`s Crazy
 Horse band.) Since becoming an E Streeter, Lofgren`s onstage guitar 
work has been both accomplished and admired. Vocally, however, he can`t 
match Van Zandt`s high-pitched duets with Springsteen, one reason 
Scialfa was added on at the last minute.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Danny Federici, <br>
<br>
-keyboards,</strong> has played with Springsteen on and off for 15 
years, a member of the Boss` now-legendary heavy metal band, Steel Mill.
 He did not, however, show up on the albums until ``Born to Run,`` 
legendarily agreeing to participate in that venture ``in order to pay 
the rent.`` His is an extremely low profile in a low profile group.<br>
<br>
`<strong class="text-strong">`Mighty`` Max Weinberg</strong>,<br>
<br>
- drums, came on with the ``Born to Run`` album, replacing Vini ``Mad 
Dog`` Lopez. One of the most respected drummers in the business, 
Weinberg brought a stable sound to the band and then went on to be an 
early pioneer of a new, powerful, driving drumbeat. His 1984 collection 
of interviews with great drummers (``The Big Beat,`` co-authored with 
Robert Santelli), included conversations with the likes of Ringo Starr, 
Charlie Watts and Dave Clark and is generally regarded as a long-overdue
 focus on the contributions of the least celebrated sidemen of rock and 
roll.</div>

<br>
July 15, 2012|<br>
Reuters<br>
By Angus MacSwan<br>
<br>
LONDON, July 15 (Reuters) –</strong> <br>
<br>
An epic Bruce Springsteen concert in London's Hyde Park ended on 
Saturday with organisers pulling the plug with the singer and ex-Beatle 
Paul McCartney still on stage and playing at full throttle after more 
than three hours of music.<br>
<br>
<br>
Springsteen had danced and worked the crowd with the energy of a man of 
half his 62 years, running through most of his classics before being 
joined by McCartney to rip through the Beatles' "I Saw Her Standing 
There" and "Twist and Shout".<br>
The pair were still singing for 65,000 rained-soaked but rapturous fans 
when the organisers turned off the microphones in line with an agreed 
10.30 p.m. curfew.<br>
The Hard Rock Calling festival was the New Jersey native's 45th show in a
 67-date tour of North America and Europe tied to "Wrecking Ball", a new
 album full of angry songs about corporate greed and the plight of 
ordinary working men and women.<br>
Unlike on other dates, when he has introduced new songs such as "Jack of
 All Trades" and "Shackled and Drawn" with commentaries on the economic 
crisis, he avoided political polemics for the most part in a city that 
has been rocked by a new round of banking scandals in the past month. 
The focus was on having a giant street party.<br>
Springsteen opened with "Thunder Road", standing alone at the microphone
 accompanied only by pianist Roy Bittan. It was, he noted, the first 
song he had played in his debut appearance in London at the Hammersmith 
Odeon in 1975.<br>
He followed that with "Badlands", the crowd singing along word for word 
and its apt refrain of "poor man wanna be rich, rich man wanna be king, 
and a king ain't satisfied 'til he rules everything". With "City of 
Ruins", he paid tribute to lost friends, notably Clarence Clemons, his 
longtime comrade in arms, saxophone player and stage foil, who died last
 year.<br>
This was the E Street Band's first tour since then but Clarence's nephew Jake has stepped into his big shoes admirably.<br>
A BEATLE AND THE BOSS<br>
With a repetoire of the depth of Springsteen's, the hits are not 
necessarily the highlights. The relatively obscure "Johnny 99" became a 
rollicking romp with New Orleans style horns.<br>
Several of the new songs are raucous Irish jigs with stinging lyics - 
"send the robber barons straight to hell, the greedy thieves who came 
around and ate the flesh of everything they found" he sang on "Death to 
my Hometown".<br>
He also paid tribute to folk singer Woody Guthrie on the 100th 
anniversary of his birth, with "the Ghost of Tom Joad", a dustbowl 
ballad named for John Steinbeck's hero. Tom Morello of Rage Against the 
Machine added searing guitar.<br>
Another star guest, former Creedence Clearwater Revival frontman John 
Fogerty joined him for "Promised Land". The crowd, standing ankle-deep 
in mud as the rain lashed down, sang along to "Waitin' on a Sunny Day" 
then listened in hushed mood to a mournful "The River", his ballad of 
youth's crushed dreams.<br>
<br>
The show climaxed with "Born in the USA" - the title track of the 1984 
album that catapaulted him to superstardom, his anthem "Born to Run", 
and "Dancing in the Dark" before McCartney walked on.<br>
"I've waited 50 years for this," Springsteen shouted.<br>
Despite being a multi-millionaire, Springsteen has stuck to his image as
 champion of the underdog as well as master of ceremonies at the most 
exuberant of rock'n' roll parties. He never fails to give value for 
money - his show in Madrid on June 17 was the longest he has ever 
played, clocking in at 3 hours and 48 minutes. And he is still winning 
new fans.<br>
"I'm a new convert," said Anna, a 25-year-old nurse from High Wycombe, 
as the crowd streamed away. "My dad was into him so I used to think he 
was uncool. I came with my dad tonight and now I see what all the fuss 
is about it."</div>

DVD Review<br>
<br>
BRUCE WESTBROOK, <br>
Houston Chronicle <br>
 February 1, 2001</strong><br>
<br>
While rocking the rafters of concert halls for a quarter-century, Bruce 
Springsteen hasn't needed -- or avidly embraced -- music videos as a 
medium for his music.<br>
Yet a new double-DVD set shows how he's navigated that realm with his 
dignity intact, rarely resorting to flashy gimmicks while largely 
letting the music speak for itself.<br>
Bruce Springsteen: The Complete Video Anthology 1978-2000 collects 33 
clips running almost three hours, about the length of a Springsteen 
show.<br>
The first disc has all 18 videos from his initial Video Anthology 
1978-1988, first issued on tape in early 1989 and still sold by some 
retailers. (So far the updated collection is not on tape.)<br>
The second disc has music videos and performance clips from the past decade.<br>
Also new to DVD for $24.98 is Blood Brothers, first released on tape in 
1996 and still offered in that format. It chronicles 1995's brief 
reunion of Springsteen's E Street Band, both in the studio and 
performing at a Manhattan club.<br>
A double-length concert album and concert video also are expected -- 
though not confirmed -- this spring. Both are rumored to be drawing from
 the 2000 tour's triumphant closing engagement at Madison Square Garden.<br>
As for videos, Springsteen has kept it simple over the years, often 
working with film directors (John Sayles, Jonathan Demme) for quality 
control.<br>
At first he resisted, making no videos for The River album and not appearing in the Atlantic City clip for the Nebraska album.<br>
But with 1984's Born in the USA, Springsteen aimed to become a 
world-conquering rock hero, and one result was eight videos from that 
album and tour.<br>
With no Born in the USA from which to draw, Disc Two isn't hit-heavy. 
But it's satisfying in its own way, with subdued, sensitive songs in an 
acoustic troubadour vein and one gem from last year's E Street reunion 
tour.<br>
It's If I Should Fall Behind, from Springsteen's 1992 Lucky Town album, 
for which he ditched most E Streeters and hired new sidemen.<br>
In the reunion's context, it becomes a stirring reaffirmation of the 
band's lengthy bond as rock 'n' roll brothers -- and one sister -- in 
arms.<br>
Directed by Demme, it's shown in one uninterrupted take, like the Brilliant Disguise video.<br>
The six-minute, letterboxed clip appears to be set in a studio, since no
 crowd noise intrudes. But it's done in the same way as it was onstage.<br>
Against a black backdrop, Springsteen approaches a mike to sing the 
first lines, followed one by one by Steve Van Zandt, Nils Lofgren, wife 
Patti Scialfa and Clarence Clemons.<br>
Not all are known for vocals, yet each sings with angelic soulfulness, 
underscoring the song's theme of staying true to loved ones through 
time's relentless passage.<br>
Apart from subdued guitar and bass and Clemons' sax solo, it's done a cappella, capped by the five joining for a fervent finish.<br>
Springsteen may be the greatest rock performer of our time, but this 
song -- so touching and tender -- is as good as anything he's ever done.<br>
Disc Two also rocks, with rousing videos for Human Touch and Better Days
 and boisterous concert clips for Leap of Faith and Murder Incorporated.
 But mostly it's thoughtful if not melancholic.<br>
Like Atlantic City,The Ghost of Tom Joad plays against a stark, 
black-and-white portrait of American desolation. Its Grapes of 
Wrath-style imagery is marred only by needless camera wobbling.<br>
A second version of Tom Joad has Springsteen performing alone on 
acoustic guitar and harmonica during a 1995 Tonight Show visit. He's 
also seen on a 1998 Charlie Rose show, playing Born in the USA as a 
wailing lament.<br>
Also in two versions, with an alternate string mix, is Secret Garden, 
Springsteen's loving celebration of women, seen in a montage of radiant,
 earthy diversity.<br>
Another rarity is the gentle Lift Me Up, from the 1999 film Limbo. Not included as a video, it plays over the end credits.<br>
Disc One's highlights include then-unknown Courteney Cox as the girl the
 Boss yanks from a concert crowd to dance with him on Dancing in the 
Dark; thunderous stage performances of Born to Run and Spare Parts; and 
Springsteen's credible acting as a grease monkey longing for a lovely 
customer in I'm on Fire.<br>
There's also the badly lip-synched Born in the USA concert clip and 
performances of Thunder Road and The River -- using overly tight 
close-ups -- from the concert film No Nukes.<br>
All videos are free of onscreen graphics. Menus are functional rather than busy, but it would help if songs were numbered.<br>
Disc Two includes a complete discography. You can access the cover art 
and song lists for each Springsteen album while hearing a song fragment 
from each.<br>
Springsteen, 51, doubtless will make more videos, rendering even this 
superb collection incomplete. But for now this double dose captures an 
inspiring artist's visual and musical evolution across more than two 
decades.<br>
Grade: A</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen's masterpiece is worth revisiting<br>
By Andrew Dansby | <br>
November 15, 2010<br>
Houston Chronicle</strong><br>
<br>
Reviewing the new reissue of Bruce Springsteen's masterpiece Darkness on
 the Edge of Town is a lot like reviewing a thunderstorm. Do you go for 
the sights? The sounds? The feeling of it? Its contents span more than 
30 years, and the set includes three CDs and three DVDs. It also comes 
with a hefty price tag; there will likely be early sale prices, but the 
retail tag sits 2 cents shy of $120. Only you know the degree of your 
devotion in the middle of a recession. But the contents are undoubtedly 
admirable.<br>
The key carrot for many locals will be the inclusion of Thrill Hill 
Vault Houston'78 Bootleg: House Cut, a concert recording from The Summit
 on Dec. 8, 1978.<br>
Let's get one very faint quibble out of the way first. Today's standards
 for filming a concert differ greatly from those in 1978, so the 
multicamera film lacks some of the visual pop we've come to expect. 
There are moments when the lights go down that the screen goes 
completely black. Quibble concluded, as it really doesn't matter because
 this concert was volcanic.<br>
Obviously nothing could compare to being there, but those in attendance 
are likely to be goosed seeing Springsteen and the E Street Band 
slashing through these 26 songs again (it seems some between-song 
footage has been excised as the DVD's three hours runs much shorter than
 the four-plus-hour estimates fans have recalled). There's little point 
in singling out songs because the performance was relentlessly frenzied 
(though Streets of Fire is fittingly incendiary). Was the show better 
than others from the tour? Who knows, but it's an awesome marriage of 
brawn and brain in a single rock concert.<br>
Dale Adamson's Chronicle review is reprinted inside the spiral notebook 
that houses the set. Proof that faster isn't necessarily better in this 
line of work, the poor guy had to split nine songs early to file his 
story. So he caught a great Because the Night and missed Backstreets, 
Rosalita, Tenth Avenue Freeze Out and Born to Run, among others. 
(Imagine trying to summarize a baseball game after six innings.)<br>
So, the rest of the set…<br>
The Darkness album is given a punchy remastering here, fitting because 
it was a leaner album than its predecessor. And these songs are always 
worth revisiting — dark documentarylike tunes about desperate people in 
desperate times. They race, they love well, they love poorly, and they 
end up on a hill when they probably shouldn't be on that hill.<br>
The Promise, a documentary about how this magnificent album got made, is
 also included. Die-hards likely already saw it on HBO a few weeks back.<br>
For those who didn't, it lacks the flimsy quality of most "about an 
album" music docs, featuring Springsteen's cooperation and commentary, 
along with copious vintage footage from the era. It also offers an 
interesting look at Springsteen's 
create-and-destroy-and-re-create-and-edit working process, which 
involves different iterations for some songs. Others get left by the 
wayside. Two CDs worth from the Darkness era end up bundled here as The 
Promise, the title track being one of the best of them. The pretty and 
plaintive fiddle-driven Come On (Let's Go Tonight) and soulful 
countrified rocker It's a Shame are great tunes that simply wouldn't 
have worked on Darkness - these songs, which celebrate the old-school 
rock from Springsteen's youth, represent what could've been a very 
different follow-up to Born to Run.<br>
Another DVD - Thrill Hill Vault 1976-1978 - is odds-and-endsy but still 
contains some fine footage, studio and live, from that span. How 
Springsteen's eyes don't fly from his skull during a Phoenix performance
 of Badlands will just have to remain a mystery. That DVD is filled with
 a live performance from Asbury Park's Paramount Theatre in 2009. From a
 production standpoint, it looks and sounds perfect. But something is 
also missing, and it's not just keyboardist Danny Federici, who died the
 year before.<br>

Springsteen and the E Street Band remain a powerful thing live. But the 
tight shots and the seasoned players lack some go-for-broke quality that
 the older footage - with Springsteen moving and snarling like a wolf - 
does. There's not that sense of courtship or seduction. It's hardly 
rote, his passion still leads with its chin. But the whole thing exudes 
wisdom before swagger.<br>
All in all, though, this package takes an essential album - one that 
speaks to the times as well now as it did then - and places it in a 
treasure chest.</div>

<br>
Bruce attends classes at Ocean County College but after a petition 
handed in by classmates claiming Bruce was too weird, Bruce realizes 
college is not for him and quits.<br>
<br>
Bruce’s parents, Adele and Douglas decide to move the family to 
California. Bruce however remains in Jersey and moves to Asbury Park 
staying at a friends’, Tinkers, surfboard factory. Asbury Park would 
also eventually become Bruce’s musical home. <br>
<br>
<br>
1969<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s most famous early band, Steel Mill is formed. The band was
 first called Child but when they found out another band went by that 
name, they changed it. The songs are mostly lyrical experiments and 
often include long instrumental (guitar) parts. The lineup of Steel Mill
 mostly consists of Danny Federici, Vinny Lopez, Robin Thompson and 
Steve Van Zandt. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1970<br>
<br>
Steel Mill quickly gains popularity playing outdoor gigs for up to a few
 thousand people. Steel Mill take a trip to California were they record a
 few demos and are offered a record deal, but they surprisingly turn it 
down. In late January, Bruce breaks up the band after playing one last 
gig on January 23 at The Upstage Club in Asbury Park. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1971<br>
<br>
Bruce experiments with different band formations and names including The
 Bruce Springsteen Jam, The Togues and Dr.Zoom and The Sonic Boom. The 
latter band would often have people on stage playing monopoly. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1972<br>
<br>
Bruce has formed a band called The Bruce Springsteen Band and they play 
various gigs in New Jersey and Virginia before breaking up. <br>
<br>
May 1<br>
Mike Appel introduces Bruce to John Hammond, a Columbia talent scout 
responsible for signing and discovering Bob Dylan and Bessie Smith 
amongst others. Bruce plays a short set in Hammond's office who is so 
impressed that he organizes a proper audition for Bruce for that same 
night at the Gaslight Club in New York. The audition is a success and 
Columbia offers Bruce a recording contract. The famous Hammond demos are
 recorded at the CBS Studios in New York. Two of the songs recorded, 
featuring Bruce (solo) on guitar and piano, will eventually be released 
on Tracks.<br>
<br>
Summer<br>
Bruce records his first record called “Greetings From Asbury Park, NJ”. 
Later Bruce would say the following about the title: “Like the main 
reason I put Asbury Park on the title of the album was because they were
 pushing for this big New York thing, this big town. I said, "Wait! You 
guys are nuts or something! I'm from Asbury Park, New Jersey! Can you 
dig it? New Jersey!”<br>
<br>
November 12<br>
The E-Street Band plays its first official show with Bruce. The band 
consisted of Clarence Clemons, Garry Tallent, Vini Lopez and Danny 
Federici. David Sancious whom played on the Greetings album, joins the 
band in the summer of 1973.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Bruce's debut album, "Greetings From Asbury Park, NJ" is released in the US.<br>
<br>
Spring<br>
Bruce and The E-Street Band tour the East and West Coast in the US in 
support of Bruce’s first album. In May and June they are the opening act
 at a few Chicago shows. The large arena crowds don’t give Bruce the 
response he’d been getting at his own shows and they are very 
indifferent to his playing. Bruce vows to never play arenas again.<br>
<br>
Summer<br>
Bruce and The E-Street Band record "The Wild, The Innocent &amp; The E-Street Shuffle".<br>
<br>
November 5<br>
Bruce’s second album, “The Wild, The Innocent &amp; The E-Street 
Shuffle” is released in the US. Both “The Wild” and “Greetings” aren’t 
commercial successes, but Bruce does gain critical attention and 
acclaim.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1974<br>
<br>
While on tour in support of “The Wild, The Innocent &amp; The E-Street 
Shuffle”, Bruce fires Vini Lopez and replaces him with Ernest “Boom” 
Carter.<br>
<br>
May 9<br>
Music critic Jon Landau, Bruce’s future manager, attends a show at the 
Harvard Square Theater in Cambridge, Mass. The show inspires Jon to 
write an article saying “I saw the future of rock and roll and its name 
is Bruce Springsteen”. A year later, the quote would be used in an 
extensive promotional campaign.<br>
<br>
September 9<br>
Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan join The E-Street Band replacing Ernest 
Carter and David Sancious on drums and piano respectively. Both Max and 
Roy were hired after replying to an ad in the Village Voice.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
1975<br>
<br>
March-July<br>
Born To Run, the album, gets recorded at the Record Plant in New York. 
During these sessions, Jon Landau, who has become Bruce’s friend, takes 
on a bigger role and slowly moves Mike Appel aside as Bruce’s manager. 
Steve Van Zandt sits in on a few sessions which leads him to join The 
E-Street Band.<br>
<br>
July 20<br>
The release of Born To Run is still six week away, but Bruce goes on tour anyway.<br>
<br>
August 13-17<br>
The famous Bottom Line stand takes place. These are regarded as some of 
Bruce’s (and The E-Street Band) most important shows of their careers. 
The shows were attended by many music critics and one of the shows was 
even broadcasted over the radio. Bruce won many fans with these shows 
and managed to convince many critics of his music abilities. <br>
<br>
September 1<br>
Bruce’s third album, “Born To Run” is released. It will be Bruce’s first
 commercial hit LP with critics applauding his strong lyrics and 
playing. The LP would go on to make the top 10 and the title track would
 end up in the Top 40. <br>
<br>
October 27<br>
Bruce appears simultaneously on the cover of “Time” and “Newsweek” and gets hailed as “the savior of rock ‘n’ roll”. <br>
<br>
November 18<br>
Bruce and the band start their first ever European tour, playing in 3 
different cities. Before the shows in London, Bruce runs through the 
city tearing down large posters claiming “Finally London is ready for 
Bruce Springsteen” <br>
<br>
December 31<br>
The Born To Run Tour ends with one final show on New Years Eve. <br>
<br>
<br>
1976<br>
<br>
“The Chicken Scratch Tour” starts in the spring. The tour is called that
 way because there seems to be no logic behind the venues played and the
 tour crosses different states going back and forth between cities, 
mainly playing small and unlikely places.<br>
<br>
April 29<br>
After a show, Bruce and Steve take a cab to Elvis’ house. Bruce decides 
to climb the gates and starts running up to the front gates when he’s 
stopped by a guard who escorts Bruce back to the gate.<br>
<br>
July 27<br>
Bruce sues Mike Appel accusing him of fraud, amongst other things. Two 
days later, Mike Appel files countersuit. The lawsuit would last until 
the spring of 1977 and prevent Bruce from entering a studio.<br>
<br>
As Bruce is unable to record any new material, he decides to go back out on the road and spends the rest of 1976 touring.<br>
<br>
<br>
1977<br>
<br>
May<br>
Bruce and Mike Appel settle out of court. Bruce now has full control 
over his music, something which he did not have before the lawsuit.<br>
<br>
June 1<br>
After being away from a studio for a long time, Bruce enters a studio in
 NY and starts recording his next album, "Darkness On The Edge Of Town".<br>
<br>
<br>
1978<br>

Buffalo, NY. The 1978 or “Darkness” tour is often claimed to be one of 
Bruce’s most legendary.<br>
<br>
June 6<br>

<br>
December 31<br>
The Darkness tour comes to an end on New Years Eve with his up to then 
longest show. At one point during the show a fan threw a firecracker on 
stage hitting Bruce just below the eye. Despite his injury and nearly 
getting blinded, Bruce carried on with the show.<br>
<br>
April 3<br>
Bruce and The E-Street Band are back in the studio to record what would become his next album, "The River".<br>
<br>
July<br>
Jon Landau, officially, becomes Bruce's manager.<br>
<br>
September 22-23<br>
Bruce and the band join artists like Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt and 
Tom Petty for two “No-Nukes” shows at the Madison Square Garden in NY. 
Bruce performs two 90 minute sets both nights and the song “The River” 
sees its debut. On the second night, Bruce celebrated his 30th birthday.
 At one point he spotted his ex girlfriend, Lynn Goldsmith in the crowd 
and dragged her onto the stage humiliating her by telling the crowd how 
she’s his ex girlfriend. According to Bruce Lynn had violated an 
agreement they both had about her taking pictures of him (she came too 
close to the stage) Bruce also threw a birthday cake into the crowd. 
Part of Bruce’s performance would end up in the No Nukes movie and on 
the album.<br>
<br>
Fall<br>
"The River" sessions are still going on. Bruce nearly releases an album 
titled “The Ties That Bind” but at the last minute decides to keep 
recording new songs.<br>
<br>
<br>
1980<br>
<br>
September<br>
After recording more than 60 songs, The River sessions come to an end.<br>
<br>
October 3<br>
Even though the album has not been released yet, The River tour starts 
in Ann Arbor, Mi. The shows will mostly consist of an average of 30 
songs lasting well over 3 hours (reports of 4 hours shows are not 
uncommon.).<br>
<br>
October 17<br>
Bruce’s fifth album, “The River” is released as a double album. It

Bruce has his first number one album with The River at number one on the Billboard Chart.<br>
<br>

<br>
December 31<br>
As with previous years, Bruce performs on New Years Eve, ending a 
three-night stand at the Nassau Coliseum in New York. The show is still

over 4 hours. <br>
<br>
<br>

The River tour comes to an end in Cincinnati. Bruce has become an established artist and claims money is no longer a problem. <br>
<br>
<br>
1982<br>
<br>
January 3<br>
With just an acoustic guitar and harmonica, Bruce tapes a collection of 
dark, bleak songs on a four track Teac recorder at his home in Holmdel, 
NJ. The songs would end up on Bruce’s next album, Nebraska. <br>
<br>
April<br>
Bruce is back in the studio. The songs recorded back in January are used
 as a basis to work from. Most of the songs don’t work out with the band
 (“Electric Nebraska”).<br>
<br>
Summer<br>
Bruce makes numerous, unannounced guest appearance with various bands 
along the Jersey bars. Most of the gigs take place in the (now 
legendary) Stone Pony in Asbury Park.<br>
<br>
October 4<br>
Bruce’s seventh album, “Nebraska” is released the way it was recorded 
back in January. The album was nothing like his usual work and confused

Bruce’s loyal fans. There would be no tour in support of the album.<br>
<br>
November 11<br>

<br>
May 9<br>
The “Dancing In The Dark” video is released.<br>
<br>
June 4<br>
Bruce’s eight album, "Born In The USA" is released. It’s Bruce’s most 
commercial album to date and is bought by both long-time fans and casual
 listeners whose first exposure to Bruce was the Dancing in the dark 
video and single. The album eventually sold more than 15 million copies 
in the US alone. The album produced 7 Top 10 hits including his number 
one song “Dancing In The Dark”. Other songs that hit it big are “I’m On 
Fire”, “Glory Days”, “My Hometown”, “ I’m Going Down”, “Cover Me” and 
“Born In The USA”.<br>
<br>
June 29<br>

“Tunnel Of Love” is released. While many people were expecting Bruce to 
cash in on the BITUSA success and release BITUSA II, Bruce comes out 
with 12 mature songs about love and relationships. The lyrics are no 
longer solely about blue-collar life struggles and now also cover 
emotional turmoil’s. The album was recorded during a three-week period, 
at his home in Rumson, New Jersey and only featured some members of the 
band on various tracks. Clarence Clemons does not appear at all. Even 
though the album was not the great commercial success BITUSA was, the 
album does go platinum on the day of its release and reaches number one 
in the charts three weeks later. “Brilliant Disguise”, “One Step Up” and
 “Tunnel Of Love” all reach the Top 10 in the charts. The album won all

<br>
October 18<br>
Bruce called up the E-Street Band members and told them “to be free to 
accept any other offers”. The press jumped on it and claimed things such
 as “Bruce fires E-Street Band!” The band hadn’t really been a part of 
Bruce’s recording career since 1982 when BITUSA was recorded. They 
weren’t used on Nebraska (sessions with the band led to nothing) and 
they were only occasionally used for Tunnel Of Love. Clarence Clemons 
took the news the hardest comparing it to a divorce. Eventually he 
opened up a few clubs in NJ and California. The rest of the band too 
moved on. Max Weinberg who said that it was weird he’d no longer play 
the music he’d been playing for most of his adult life, started his own 
band, the “Max Weinberg 7” and landed a job on the Conan O’Brien show. 
Garry Tallent became a producer in Nashville, Roy Bittan bought a 
recording studio in LA, Danny Federici built a studio in Colt’s Neck, NJ

Bruce performs at two Christic Institute Benefit shows. Bonnie Raitt and
 Jackson Brown are also present. The two emotional solo acoustic shows 
rank amongst Bruce’s best even though he was extremely nervous not 
having performed for a long time. At the start of both shows he asked 
the audience for some quiet while he was playing because it’d been a 
long time and the clapping and cheering would put him off. Bruce 
premiered a total of 10 new songs he'd been working on.<br>

June 5<br>
A rehearsal show in California shows another real glimpse of what the 
shows would look like. The shows are rock and gospel oriented and mostly
 concentrates on the new material with an old hit here and there. Bruce 
himself is a calmer and settled person who seems happier with himself 
now that he’s become a family man. He also doesn’t shy away from making 
fun of himself and how his albums are doing on the charts (or aren’t 
doing, as they are not the chart toppers he’s had before. At one of the 
shows during the tour, a magazine with the billboard chart would get 
thrown on stage and Bruce would make comments about how his albums are 
slipping down the chart) <br>
<br>
June 15<br>
The tour, Bruce’s first in 4 years starts in Sweden, Stockholm. There is
 lots of media coverage and a nervous band takes the stage, playing a 
3-hour show. They get through it alright, but the fans have mixed 
feelings. Born to run is missing from the shows for the first time since
 1975 (only to reappear a few days later in Milan, Italy). Some fans 
crave for the “old days” with The E-Street Band.<br>
<br>
August 6<br>
Bruce appears on the cover of Rolling Stone<br>
<br>
July 23-August 13<br>
Bruce is back in NJ to play his first shows since 1985. The 11 
Meadowlands shows are a new start as many of the new songs are replaced 
with older, favorites.<br>
<br>
July<br>
Bruce records a show for MTV called "Bruce Springsteen In Concert: "MTV 
UnPlugged". Or at least that was the idea, as Bruce decided his touring 
band wasn't ready and played only one acoustic song (Red Headed Woman) 
which was the first song. Afterwards, Bruce plugged in and played his 
normal set.<br>
<br>
October<br>
The Tour continues. Even though both albums have dropped out of the top

March 23<br>
A rehearsal show in Red Bank, NJ for a new European tour takes place. 
Since then, Bruce started pulling out songs, not played since the 70’s, 
if played live at all, and unreleased songs only found on bootlegs see 
the light of day. After years of rather predictable and well thought-out
 live shows setlist-wise, Bruce suddenly loosens up and becomes 
completely unpredictable. <br>
<br>
March 31<br>
The European tour opens in Glasgow, Scotland. “Lucky Town” is shown on 
MTV. The show now starts with 3 acoustic songs showing us a glimpse of 
were Bruce is headed in the future. The shows have changed a lot since 
the last legs.<br>

<br>
June 24<br>
Bruce sets up two benefit shows in NJ and NY. The NJ show at the 
Meadowlands is called “Concert to fight hunger” and becomes a four 
hour-long party atmosphere with guest appearance by Clarence Clemons, 
Max Weinberg and Steven Van Zandt. As Roy Bittan and Patti Scialfa were 
already present, half of the E-Street Band was on stage, fuelling rumors
 and raising hope that Bruce wants to set up a reunion.<br>
<br>
June 25<br>
It’s David Letterman’s last night. He tells the audience that there’s 
really only one guest he’s wanted to have on the show for all those 
years and that tonight that would all change. With that, Bruce walks 
onstage and plays Glory Days with Paul Shaeffer and the David Letterman 
band, even jumping on Paul’s piano. A very relaxed and funny television 
appearance. <br>
<br>
June 26<br>
The second benefit is in support of the Kristin Ann Carr fund. At one 
point during the show, Terence Trent D’Arby is booed by some people. 
(It’s been said those people misunderstood Bruce and believed Clarence 
would come onstage). An angry Bruce rushed through the rest of the show 
and thus ending the tour and the collaboration with a different band on a
 sad note. The tour was worth it for most of the fans, although some 
complained about the way the older songs were played (“it’s just not the
 same…”) <br>
<br>
Summer-Winter<br>
Bruce takes some well-deserved time off.<br>
<br>

After rejecting it for two decades, Bruce finally accommodates Sony’s 
requests to make a Greatest Hits cd. He also wants to record some new 
material and with only 72 hours notice, Bruce gets the entire E-Street 
Band back into the studio at the Hit Factory in New York. The entire

documentary called “Blood Brothers”. <br>

Three benefit shows at the Paramount Theater in Asbury Park, NJ. Even

Bruce appeared in a British court in hopes of blocking the release of 
some of his earliest work from 26 years ago. The material was recorded 
in 1972 and a company named Masquerade Music attempted to sell the work 
as an LP called Before The Flame. His lawyer stated, "It matters to Mr. 
Springsteen that he retains control of his artistic output." <br>

for The River and Born In The U.S.A. albums during the late 70s and 
early 80s, 18 tracks from the mid- to late 80s, and 14 tracks from the 
90s. Springsteen states in the linear notes: "This collection contains 
everything from the first notes I sang in the Columbia recording studio,
 my early and later work with the E Street Band, through to my music in 
the 90s... I'm glad to finally be able to share this music; here are 
some of the ones that got away."<br>

At a ceremony at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in NY, Bruce is inducted into
 the Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall Of Fame. U2’s Bono gives the induction speech. 
During Bruce’s speech, Bruce dedicates the honor to his mother who is in
 the audience and to his father who had recently passed away saying "I 
have to thank him, because what would I conceivably have written about 
without him? I mean, you gotta imagine, if everything had gone great 
between us, it would have been a disaster. I would have written just 
happy songs and I tried that in the early 90s and it didn't work. The 
public didn't like it." Bruce also took the time to praise and thank 
each and every E-Street Band member who were not eligible to be inducted
 with him. At the end of his speech, he called all of them up to the 
stage. Bruce and the band then performed four songs in front of the 
crowd. It was the first time since September 1995 that the entire band 
had been back onstage in front of an audience. <br>

rains and thunder and lightning pay a visit and it keeps raining on and

The Boss Bibliography<br>
By A. O. SCOTT</strong><br>
<br>
BOOKS about, inspired by or making reference to Bruce Springsteen are 
hardly a new, or especially rare, phenomenon. ''Born to Run,'' the first
 volume of Dave Marsh's quasi-authorized biography, appeared in 1979, 
and is now available along with its sequel, ''Glory Days,'' in a single 
volume called ''Bruce Springsteen: Two Hearts.'' Springsteen's lyrics, 
which frequently, if modestly, display their own literary pedigree, 
resonate in the prose of writers like Bobbie Ann Mason, Richard Ford, 
Stephen King (who prefaced his epic novel ''The Stand'' with a quotation
 from Springsteen's song ''Jungleland'') and T. C. Boyle, who took the 
title for his story collection ''Greasy Lake'' from imagery in a cut 
from Springsteen's first album. The basic Boss studies syllabus includes
 Daniel Cavicchi's ''Tramps Like Us,'' a sociological study of his fan 
base; Rolling Stone's omnibus ''Bruce Springsteen: The Rolling Stone 
Files''; and ''It Ain't No Sin to Be Glad You're Alive,'' Eric 
Alterman's knowledgeable and rousing elaboration of ''The Promise of 
Bruce Springsteen.''<br>
<br>
In 1999, when he reunited the E Street Band for a long, triumphal tour, 
it seemed Springsteen's main enterprise would be the consolidation of 
his reputation as the greatest — and perhaps also the last — rocker to 
emerge from the ferment of the baby boom. His recent releases, apart 
from ''The Ghost of Tom Joad,'' had been mainly archival, and the 
reunion shows were devoted largely to breathing new life into old 
favorites and to a joyful, generous rock 'n' roll revivalism. But then 
came Sept. 11, which called forth ''The Rising,'' his (and maybe 
anyone's) most convincing rock record since the Reagan era, and the 2004
 election campaign, which occasioned Springsteen's first public 
endorsement (on the Op-Ed page of this newspaper) of a presidential 
candidate. Those events, and the release this spring of ''Devils &amp; 
Dust,'' have sent the Bruceologists back to their desks, and the result 
is a spate of revisitings, reinterpretations, reissues and recyclings, 
from rock critics, psychiatrists, historians and fiction writers.<br>
<br>
Two new story collections -- Tennessee Jones's <strong class="text-strong">DELIVER ME FROM NOWHERE</strong> (Soft Skull Press, paper, $12) and <strong class="text-strong">MEETING ACROSS THE RIVER: Stories Inspired by the Haunting Bruce Springsteen Song</strong>
 (Bloomsbury, paper, $14.95), an anthology edited by Jessica Kaye and 
Richard J. Brewer -- serve mainly as reminders of Springsteen's own 
superior skill as a storyteller. Jones's slim volume contains 10 linked 
stories suggested by the lean, grim vignettes of Springsteen's 
''Nebraska'' album, while ''Meeting Across the River'' comprises 20 
variations on a noirish monologue that may be the least memorable cut on
 ''Born to Run.'' ''It's what's not in the lyric,'' Martin J. Smith 
writes in a foreword, ''rather than what is, that makes the song so 
intriguing,'' thus inadvertently establishing the superfluousness of the
 undertaking. What the various contributors, many of them crime 
novelists, put in amounts mainly to the tough-guy clichés that already 
hang too thickly over the song.<br>
<br>
Jones, adding a dimension of sexual anxiety to the tales of hard luck 
and aimlessness in ''Nebraska,'' does a bit better. His versions of 
''Highway Patrolman'' and ''My Father's House,'' in particular, go 
farther into the darkness on the edge of town than Springsteen himself 
has ventured. But you can't help wondering if Jones's imagination has 
been hobbled by the songs he's chosen to lean on. Since, for instance, 
he can hardly match the courtroom monologue that concludes ''Johnny 99''
 (''Now judge, judge, I had debts no honest man can pay''), Jones pushes
 it offstage, into the hearsay testimony of another character: ''I don't
 remember exactly what he said,'' she confesses. ''I wish I had it 
recorded so I could just play it back for you.'' At that point, you may 
prefer to cue up the CD.<br>
<br>
Which, of course, you are likely to do anyway. Springsteen's command of 
his chosen themes, and the power and sophistication he brings to them, 
makes criticism largely a matter of saying amen. Books about Elvis 
Presley tend to traffic in either rootsy antiquarianism or slick 
mythologizing. Bob Dylan inspires exegetes and soothsayers. Springsteen 
encourages hagiography. Every fan knows it's hard to be a saint in the 
city, and every reader of the Bible (one of Springsteen's preferred 
storehouses of phrase and image) has heard that it's not easy to be a 
prophet in your own country. Maybe, in Springsteen's case, it only looks
 easy; God -- or anyone who has been to a Springsteen concert -- knows 
the man works hard. By now, though, 30 years after the release of ''Born
 to Run'' landed him simultaneously on the covers of Newsweek and Time, 
the mantle of prophet and oracle -- perhaps even of saint -- seems to 
rest as naturally on Springsteen's muscular shoulders as the strap to 
his blond Fender Esquire or Clarence Clemons's hand.<br>
<br>
Virtually all the books under consideration here are documents of faith,
 written by folks who will always find some reason to believe (as well 
as any excuse to quote some lyrics -- my apologies). But for this very 
reason it may be worthwhile to take note of the views of heretics and 
dissidents, in particular those who do not so much criticize the quality
 of Springsteen's music as question the authenticity of his oracular, 
populist persona.<br>
<br>
John Lennon sang that a working-class hero was something to be. In 
England, maybe, but in this country, where money and mobility tend to 
dissolve and to mystify social divisions, a working-class hero may be a 
contradiction in terms. And so Springsteen, the son of a bus driver and a
 legal secretary, occasionally encounters suspicion when, from his 
current position as an unimaginably rich and successful rock star, he 
speaks up for, and in the voices of, the marginal and the downtrodden. 
His preacherly demeanor solicits accusations of bad faith, while his 
forays into political activism (including his mini-tour in support of 
John Kerry near the end of last year's presidential campaign) can be 
caricatured as the well-meaning sentiments of yet another wealthy 
show-business liberal. Springsteen's sincerity can also rankle those who
 prefer their pop culture affectless and ironical, or who are more 
attuned to the clever manipulation of sampled bric-a-brac than to the 
struggle for mastery over historical influences.<br>
<br>
In a recent article in Slate, Stephen Metcalf made the provocatively 
revisionist claim that the real Bruce was neither the singer of quiet, 
Guthriesque ballads nor the purveyor of grand, operatic anthems, but 
rather the scruffy, mischievous New Jersey boardwalk habitué -- ''a 
scrawny little dirtbag from the shore'' -- who composed the verbose, 
playful, musically adventuresome shaggy-dog tales of his first two 
albums, ''Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.'' and ''The Wild, the 
Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle.'' In Metcalf's account, it was the 
rock critic Jon Landau, author of the most famous line of rock-critic 
prophecy (''I saw rock 'n' roll future and its name is Bruce 
Springsteen'') and after that Springsteen's producer and mentor, who 
transformed the charming beach bum into a self-conscious man of the 
people and, consequently, into a darling of the intellectuals. For 
Metcalf, at the same time that Landau ''intellectualized Bruce, he 
anti-intellectualized him,'' minting a familiar, durable persona that 
turns out to be ''Jon Landau's middle-class fantasy of white, 
working-class authenticity,'' and the basis of what is ''in essence, a 
white minstrel act.''<br>
<br>
Strong words. But authenticity is a peculiar criterion to apply to a 
rock musician, since American popular music since the 1950's has 
provided fertile ground for self-invention, contradiction and 
cross-pollination. The personas of the great popular musicians of the 
rock era -- from Elvis to Prince, from Bob Dylan to Madonna -- are 
hardly organic products of native soil. There are no pure products of 
America. Which is not to endorse Metcalf's cynical view of Springsteen's
 imaginative project of the past three decades, but rather to suggest 
that the idea of authenticity needs to be applied somewhat differently. 
Not to Springsteen's persona -- which I would argue even the most 
passionate and literal-minded fan understands to be, to some degree, an 
artifact, an act -- but rather to the experience of witnessing and 
participating in a Springsteen performance, and also to the musical, 
lyrical and conceptual integrity of the songs themselves.<br>
<br>
To my mind, no one has written better about the texture and rhythm of a Springsteen show than Jimmy Guterman. His new book,<strong class="text-strong"> RUNAWAY AMERICAN DREAM: Listening to Bruce Springsteen</strong>
 (Da Capo, paper, $15.95), is a collection of loose, energetic essays 
that, as they meander and overlap, add up to a passionate, highly 
subjective portrait of the artist in relation to his public. Guterman, 
whose other books include ''The Worst Rock 'n' Roll Records of All 
Time,'' makes some interesting and occasionally counterintuitive 
judgments about Springsteen's records, but his greatest knack is for 
using particular shows and tours to set up wide-ranging excursions into 
musical history. His perspective -- the one on which rock criticism was 
founded in the late 1960's -- is that of the smart guy in the audience, 
plucking ideas and emotions out of the stream of familiar songs and 
wondering what, beyond the price of the ticket, it all amounts to.<br>
<br>
Guterman's understanding of the bond between Springsteen and his 
audience, a phenomenon empirically observed at who knows how many 
stadium, arena and club shows -- a comprehensive list of such events 
appears in the back of THE TIES THAT BIND: Bruce Springsteen A to E to Z
 (Visible Ink, paper, $24.95), Gary Graff's spirited and comprehensive 
encyclopedia of Bossiana -- is both nuanced and incisive, as is his 
description of the songwriting ethic that guarantees that bond. Since 
''Darkness on the Edge of Town,'' Springsteen, according to Guterman, 
has told ''accurate, unflinching stories of the people who weren't as 
lucky as he was. As he looked out at the vast stadium crowds, he must 
have known those were the people filling the stadiums. They still needed
 to see a reflection of themselves onstage; Springsteen still needed to 
deliver that.''<br>
<br>
Of course, this has proven to be a complicated undertaking. For one 
thing, the scope of Springsteen's reference -- the kind of characters 
who show up in many of the songs on ''The Ghost of Tom Joad'' and his 
new album, ''Devils &amp; Dust'' -- has broadened far beyond his core 
audience. And that audience itself may have narrowed as rock has left 
behind the last traces of youthful rebellion to become the soundtrack of
 wistful middle age. Still, no one who has stood in a stadium during the
 second verse of ''Promised Land'' or the opening of ''Hungry Heart'' 
can deny that the sense of identification between the singer, his 
subjects and his fans is powerful and deep. At those moments, 
Springsteen stops singing and listens as a hundred thousand people sing 
back his first-person lyrics.<br>
<br>
This ritual transaction underlies Robert Coles's<strong class="text-strong"> BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN'S AMERICA: The People Listening, a Poet Singing </strong>(Random
 House, paper, $13.95). (It's one of the only entries in the Boss 
bibliography, by the way, that does not take its title from a 
Springsteen lyric.) The subtitle may overreach. This people is as likely
 to be listening to Toby Keith or 50 Cent as to the bard Coles places in
 the line of Walt Whitman and William Carlos Williams. Even so, Coles's 
book, in spite of a certain wish-fulfilling, populist sentimentality, 
turns listening into an ingeniously literal-minded exercise in anecdotal
 sociology. Using the documentary method he has been refining since the 
early 1960's, Coles sits down with a cross section of Americans, not all
 of them especially interested in Bruce Springsteen, and listens to them
 talking about what they hear in particular songs. His style of 
transcription can be grating -- it is sometimes hard to believe that 
ordinary Americans talk in the ostentatiously folksy vernacular Coles 
puts between quotation marks -- but ''Bruce Springsteen's America'' 
nonetheless attempts something rare and valuable in the study of popular
 culture. It tries to record the complicated reactions people have to 
the music they hear, and the contradictory, free-associative ways we 
connect that music to our own lives. The book's best section presents a 
law enforcement officer contending with tracks like ''Johnny 99'' and 
''Highway Patrolman'' that cut against his ideas about work, morality 
and crime. His response to ''American Skin (41 Shots),'' Springsteen's 
song about the shooting of Amadou Diallo by New York City police 
officers in 1999, is a précis of the contradictions that the song tries 
to explore, but that even Springsteen's generous, capacious personality 
has had a hard time containing.<br>
<br>
He does, nonetheless, contain multitudes, and at this stage in his 
career there is no shortage of writers eager to place him in the 
broadest context of American cultural history. <strong class="text-strong">BORN IN THE U.S.A.: Bruce Springsteen and the American Tradition</strong>
 (Wesleyan University, paper, $22.95), Jim Cullen's 1997 study, newly 
updated to include Springsteen's response to 9/11, marshals impressive 
scholarship to assimilate the Boss into the main currents of American 
thought -- or at least into the canon of the American studies 
curriculum. (Cullen, currently on the faculty of the Ethical Culture 
Fieldston School in New York, has a Ph.D. in American studies from 
Brown.) Some of his readings are more persuasive than others. Much as I 
love the idea of Springsteen as torchbearer of a small-r republican 
tradition stretching back through Roosevelt and Lincoln into the 
Enlightenment, Cullen's argument has the effect of installing him in a 
stable full of academic hobbyhorses rather than in a vital constellation
 of ideas. The chapter on Springsteen's place within a tradition of 
American Roman Catholic writers and artists is more interesting, since 
it provides a cultural context for the dialectic of sin and grace, 
alienation and despair that has given structure to Springsteen's music 
since ''Born to Run.''<br>
<br>
A more unusual kind of contextualization informs <strong class="text-strong">4TH OF JULY, ASBURY PARK: A History of the Promised Land </strong>(Bloomsbury,
 $24.95), Daniel Wolff's wonderfully evocative history of the New Jersey
 resort town where Springsteen, after graduating from Freehold High 
School and briefly attending Ocean County Community College, served his 
rock 'n' roll apprenticeship. Among other things, Wolff's book footnotes
 some of the place names and geographical features in Springsteen's 
lyrics. (The narrator of ''Something in the Night,'' who's ''riding down
 Kingsley, figuring I'll get a drink'' is cruising one of the city's 
main thoroughfares, a block inland from the water, named for a 
19th-century Methodist minister.) The chapters dealing with Springsteen 
himself also show how Asbury Park's music scene -- divided by race, 
class and taste -- influenced the intricate sound of his early records.<br>
<br>
But really, Springsteen is less the subject of ''4th of July, Asbury 
Park'' than a kind of hovering spirit in the night, and perhaps also a 
marketing conceit. Wolff characterizes the book, which stretches back to
 the town's founding after the Civil War by an enterprising Methodist 
named James Bradley, as a ''rock 'n' roll history,'' a grand, sad story 
of racism and real estate, political hardball and seaside 
pleasure-seeking. It hardly explains Springsteen -- none of these books 
really do -- but it does remind us, in fascinating detail, where he 
comes from.<br>
