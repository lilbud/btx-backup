One reason the right hates the left is that, like the devil, the left 
has the best tunes. Rock'n'roll was subversive when it was "race music" 
and it got rougher when white boys picked it up. Elvis Presley's first 
pelvic thrusts on television in 1956 provoked a critic for The New York 
Times to rant that the "commercialised overstimulation of youth's 
physical impulses is certainly a gross national disservice".<br>
The conservatives' tragedy is that they've never had anyone to sing for 
them. Bob Dylan would have disappeared without trace if he'd written 
''The Times They Aint A-Changin'''. Jimmy Barnes never thought of doing 
Middle Class Man.<br>
The revolution lives on in Bruce Springsteen, troubadour of love and 
hard times, poet laureate to Barack Obama. His concert at Homebush on 
Wednesday was astounding, the greatest I have seen - 3½ hours of musical
 genius emitting enough energy to power an aluminium smelter. I was 
staggered when he dived into the audience and then crowd-surfed back to 
the stage, borne aloft by a hundred ecstatic fans.<br>
You've still got it, Boss, still got it. No retreat, baby, no surrender.</div>

The Age<br>
<br>
April 1, 2013 - 3:07PM <br>
<br>
Bernard Zuel</strong><br>
<br>
A decade ago, deflated Bruce Springsteen fans thought their last concert
 memories of a once-great live band would be forever tarnished by poor 
sound, surroundings and power outages - how wrong they were.<br>
<br>
To understand why the 2013 Australian tour by Bruce Springsteen has been
 not just fantastic musically, critically and financially but also – and
 crucially - emotionally, you need to go back to 2003, the last time he 
brought the E Street Band to Australia.<br>
<br>
On that tour, thanks to a combination of management overestimating (of 
Springsteen's support in Australia after an absence of hits or tours in 
20 years) and the promoter underestimating (of how much resistance there
 was to outdoor shows), Springsteen played in stadiums in Sydney and 
Melbourne that were at best two-thirds full and had his Brisbane show 
transferred indoors due to poor sales.<br>
<br>
More devastatingly for many fans, this one included, was how that Sydney
 show was a disaster, and I'm not even talking about the three power 
dropouts at the beginning of the set. If the distance to the stage (and 
the wildly enthusiastic behaviour of the front section, which suggested 
some people were having a great time) wasn't bad enough, back in the 
“boondocks” the truncated sound was so awful that some left early 
demanding refunds, while many other fans, this one included, sat numb 
and increasingly depressed at the thought that what looked to be the 
last opportunity to see one of the greatest live bands of all time was 
ending like this.<br>
<br>
A decade later and more than 130,000 people saw 10 sold-out shows in 
multiple-night stands in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne, and two 
performances beneath the iconic rock face of Hanging Rock in country 
Victoria. Every review was ecstatic and online postings were almost 
hysterically euphoric with fans comparing setlists, set times and who 
got to hold Springsteen up as he crowd-surfed back to the stage.<br>
<br>
What went right this time apart from the fact that distance had dulled 
some of the bruises of 2003? Well, for a start almost all the shows were
 indoors, where relative comfort could be guaranteed, sonic quality 
could be controlled and energy could be channelled, while the two 
outdoor shows were almost by definition special events. Also, rather 
than only seated areas there was a significant standing area at each 
show, which was filled with the wild, the innocent and the E Street 
fanatics; who queued early each day, carried signs (and children) and 
sang louder each night than anyone else. In that lot was the teenage 
girl in Brisbane whose sign asked Springsteen to dance with her mother 
in Dancing In The Dark (which he did, fulfilling her 30-year dream and 
leaving her speechless post-show) and the 20-something at Hanging Rock 
whose sign read “please rub my belly for luck” as she and her boyfriend 
were trying to get pregnant (he rubbed but we'll have to wait a few 
months to see that effect).<br>
<br>
Then there was the fact that not only was the band playing superbly but 
every show saw the 63-year-old Springsteen run, jump, crowd-surf, play 
and sing for around three hours at a level that would shame most 
30-year-olds. Added to this, every performance featured five, six and up
 to 10 songs not played at other shows on the tour, with the band 
regularly jumping out of the set list that already spanned his 40-year 
career to respond to audience requests; so even if you saw a couple of 
shows you'd be surprised and rewarded with a treat like If I Should Fall
 Behind, from his lesser-known album Lucky Town, at Hanging Rock, or an 
old live favourite from the '70s and '80s, Rosalita, which closed a 
couple of shows.<br>
<br>
Remember this happened in an age where every second of most rock and pop
 shows are programmed months in advance and stay unchanged for the 
tour's duration. Such flexibility is impressive enough for old hands 
like Gary Tallent and drummer Max Weinberg, who have been playing some 
of these songs for decades, but it's mind blowing for the likes of guest
 guitarist Tom Morello, whose playing and singing was one of the 
revelations of the tour and who rumour has it spent many of his days off
 learning new songs in case they came up the next night.<br>
<br>
That level of commitment couldn't help but translate to audiences who 
recognised something else: while rock cliches were present, while 
several elements repeated each show (the kid brought up to sing Waitin' 
On A Sunny Day, the crowd surfing), on stage there was a genuine passion
 for the songs, the playing of them and the interaction with the 
audience that followed.<br>
<br>
No band member left the stage free of sweat and exhaustion; no audience 
member left the room free of a connection made with this man. That it 
happens once is rare enough; that it happened every show for 10 shows is
 something near miraculous.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen: Not The Me-Me-Me-Me<br>
<br>
Paolo Hewitt, Melody Maker, 9 May 1981</strong><br>
<br>
STACKED on the left of the typewriter are two blank cassettes which 
should contain the voice of Bruce Springsteen. But like Kevin Rowland 
and Elvis Costello, Bruce doesn't like tapes, recorders or notebooks.<br>
<br>
Before starting this European tour he did two formal interviews with 
music papers – the only press likely to draw him out – one with Rolling 
Stone, the other with Musician. And that was enough for Bruce.<br>
<br>
He doesn't need that kind of publicity to sell records or gigs; he 
doesn't need it to boost his ego: that kind of superficial security he 
can do without.<br>
<br>
"And also because it ends up me-me-me-me all the time," he told me last 
week, laughing self-deprecatingly and thumping himself on the chest.<br>
<br>
So instead we sat in his dressing room and chatted. Within minutes the 
intensity of the man came through: he was searching for words and 
talking about matters not easy to articulate.<br>
<br>
By the end of an hour I felt as though I'd made a new friend. That 
intimacy comes through on record, and more so in his current three-hour 
show, where the songs range from the deep emotion of 'Darkness On The 
Edge Of Town' to the vibrancy of 'Rosalita'.<br>
<br>
On the latter Bruce, Garry Tallent, Clarence Clemons and Miami Steve 
jump down into the audience to heighten the communication, performer and
 listener look each other straight in the eye.<br>
<br>
The same was true offstage; with the tape whirring the conversation we 
had could never have happened. So how do I know I haven't misquoted him?
 That's just the price you pay.<br>
<br>
BECAUSE it's been six years since he last played here, and the aura that
 surrounds him, Bruce Springsteen has become a legend, an untouchable, a
 saviour even.<br>
<br>
The mystique is perpetuated by stories of mammoth concerts that become 
celebrations, climbing billboards to deface his posters, opening shows 
with 'Badlands' on the day of Ronald Reagan's election.<br>
<br>
And here, coming down the lobby of the Hotel Sofitel in Lyons, France, 
is Bruce with girlfriend Joyce. "Going out to play golf?" jokes one of 
the road crew.<br>
<br>
Along comes Dave Marsh, Springsteen biographer and husband of tour 
manager Barbara Carr. "Us guys are going out to have a look around the 
town right now, but we'll be back later. Catch you then." And off he 
went to catch up Bruce.<br>
<br>
Six-thirty, and still no sign of the tickets for tonight's show, so I 
head for the bar. Two bearded, muscular technicians wearing Springsteen 
T-shirts are sitting there.<br>
<br>
"What time's the show tonight," I ask.<br>
<br>
"There ain't one," says one of the guys. "Least we ain't going to be there if there is." And they burst into laughter.<br>
<br>
"What do you mean? I was told tonight."<br>
<br>
"Like we said, no show. It's tomorrow. The President's got the hall 
tonight to make an election speech or somethin'. Gig's cancelled. It's 
tomorrow."<br>
<br>
I get that sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. I've only got enough money to stay tonight.<br>
<br>
Then Dave Marsh walks into the lobby. I explain my predicament.<br>
<br>
"Don't worry," said Dave. "Bruce will look after you."<br>
<br>
AND THE next night he did. After my first Springsteen concert, still 
suffering from "the first time you see Bruce glow," as they call it, he 
welcomes me into his dressing room.<br>
<br>
Bruce is wearing a tastefully-embroidered shirt and smells faintly of 
embrocation; I'm a bundle of nerves. I stall for time and ask him about 
Robert De Niro.<br>
<br>
Somewhere along the line I'd heard they were old drinking buddies. 
Legend even has it that Bruce gave De Niro the immortal "Are you talking
 to me?" line from Taxi Driver.<br>
<br>
"Nah," says Bruce. "I met him a few times, but Clarence knows him better. You should ask Clarence about him."<br>
<br>
It's time to start talking seriously.<br>
<br>
How does he feel, in retrospect, about his early albums?<br>
<br>
He grimaces. "Ah, I was kind of loose when I made those albums," he says
 dismissively. "The other day, in fact, I was driving home and 'Blinded 
By The Light', came on the radio and ..." He flicks an imaginary switch 
off in mid air.<br>
<br>
We move on to the infamous hype period that CBS instigated for his 
dramatic Born To Run album. An album that simultaneously nearly killed 
him, but instead set him up as the Great White Hope.<br>
<br>
"Well one of the bad things about all that hype business," says Bruce in
 almost a whisper, "was that it made us look as though we'd come up from
 nowhere when we'd been playing the bars for years before that."<br>
<br>
To get away from the intense pressure that followed, Bruce packed his 
bags and headed for home: New Jersey, where he was brought up. There, he
 says, he discovered himself. As a kid he never bothered with reading 
books or any of that style. Back in Jersey he started reading.<br>
<br>
Could he give any titles? Bruce motions to the bags that have been packed and are ready to go back to the hotel.<br>
<br>
"I made a list, actually, of all the books that I had read and were 
important to me, but I guess it's somewhere in there." Currently he's 
engrossed in The History of the United States.<br>
<br>
Also in Jersey he discovered movies. "I started going to see films for something else other than enjoyment."<br>
<br>
It was from this period of self-awareness that Darkness On The Edge Of 
Town was created. Bruce had not only discovered himself, but he'd also 
seen the lives of those around him. The forces that had affected them.<br>
<br>
He agrees now that Born To Run, his previous album to this period of 
discovery about life and himself, did have "a lot of overblown romance. 
But it still contained the seeds of realism." The last verse of 
'Jungleland', Bruce points to as proof of this assertion.<br>
<br>
These seeds of realism flowered on Darkness. His toughest album and most
 realistic, when it appeared in '78 it locked in perfectly with the mood
 that punk had created in England. But whereas punk was only starting to
 address the problems of identity and purpose, Bruce nailed the problem 
in one.<br>
<br>
"Yeah, it's funny that," says Bruce, "because in America I looked around
 and no-one was writing about this kind of stuff." Later on Bruce 
describes Darkness as "a guy trying to discover who he is and where he's
 going to."<br>
<br>
Did he think Darkness was optimistic? "Yeah, I think so," he affirms. 
"'Badlands' – that's optimistic, raising yourself above it all." We move
 onto the River album He tells me that out of his five albums, this one 
is his favourite.<br>
<br>
I tell him that it seems to me to be a balance between the romance and 
glory of Born To Run, and the gritty, hard realism of Darkness.<br>
<br>
Eagerly he agrees. To him it's so important to have the two. "That's why we put 'I Wanna Marry You' next to 'The River.'<br>
<br>
"'I Wanna Marry You' is a guy who sees someone from a corner and as soon
 as he does it's..." – he motions with his hands to try and articulate 
that first rush of blood and love. "It's..." he repeats, both of us 
laughing.<br>
<br>
"But 'The River' itself balances that out," he says, getting serious 
again. "So you have the two of them. And that's important." He goes on 
to explain further. To him, during the Seventies, because of the things 
that have rocked nations – "things like Watergate" – "people have lost 
the ability to dream.<br>
<br>
"It's been knocked out of people," he says wistfully. What a part of his music does is to try and re-establish that quality.<br>
<br>
One of the reasons that he loves rock 'n' roll so much is because it 
gives people such a vitality and sense of being alive. From 'Anarchy In 
The UK' to 'Born To Run', anyone can testify to that vitality. Dreaming 
is a part of that sense of being alive, hence Bruce's interest and 
stress on it.<br>
<br>
Simultaneously, though, he realise: that songs like 'Cadallac Ranch' and
 'Fun' must be balanced by the kin of realism to be found on Darkness. 
"That's just as important."<br>
<br>
There are other matters, too.<br>
<br>
Bruce sees himself and fellow E Streeters presenting and representing 
some kind of Idea. Part of that Idea is to remain as accessible as ever.
 This is a Very Important Thing.<br>
<br>
But how, I wonder, did Springsteen (who may finally be the man to 
replace all those pathetic wasted songwriting teams of Plant and Page, 
Richards and Jagger), balance that accessibility with the enormous 
success he is now enjoying?<br>
<br>
On every date of this European tour he has sold out consistently. In 
Britain, 250,000 people wanted to see him at Wembley. In Amsterdam they 
wanted to give him platinum records for The River.<br>
<br>
He explains carefully and with great deliberation.<br>
<br>
"I haven't changed my way of living all that much you know." He's always
 been lucky enough to eschew the trappings that come with success. It's 
something he hasn't found hard to do.<br>
<br>
"I don't know if I can articulate this properly," he says, frowning. 
"But this room," – and he gestures to the quite large place we're 
sitting in – "and money, it's there but it's not important. It's not the
 end.<br>
<br>
"You see, the sell out doesn't occur when you take your first limousine 
ride. It happens in here," thumping his chest. He thinks he could be 
sucked into it.<br>
<br>
"A lot of good people with something to say have fallen into that trap,"
 he says quietly. "It's when you get fat and lose your hunger," he 
stresses "that is when you know the sell out has happened."<br>
<br>
That's why that trip back to Jersey was so important for him round about
 the time of Born To Run, when he first walked into enormous success.<br>
<br>
Because he knew who he was, where he was coming from and what he was 
writing about, he could see the dangers inherent in succumbing to the 
temptations. "Darkness was the first album where afterwards I saw myself
 as a man at last and not a kid anymore."<br>
<br>
Another reason for his ability to be true is the people he surrounds 
himself with. Good people who guided him and protected him, but not in a
 cotton wool manner. Honest people.<br>
<br>
BRUCE'S writing has changed a great deal now, a fact he readily admits. 
"I'm not writing for the people I grew up with as a kid," he snorts, 
"because they're all married with a dog and kids now."<br>
<br>
He writes about himself and the way he sees things now. As a man. He 
hopes that the people who come to see the show are able to feel a 
two-way thing with the band. Each party can look into each other's eyes.<br>
<br>
Did religion ever affect him I wonder? He shakes his head and tells of 
how, at an early age, he realised that the people teaching it relied on 
fear to instil it in him.<br>
<br>
He looks up at the ceiling when he's saying all this and I tell him 
that's exactly why I stay in bed on Sundays now. You shouldn't have to 
look up to anything.<br>
<br>
"That's it!" he shouts, grabbing my arm. "It should be like this," and we're face to face.<br>
<br>
Time now, though, is running out. People keep entering the dressing room
 to take things out to the truck and they keep giving Bruce lightning 
glances.<br>
<br>
Sensing this I ask him what else is good about the band and the music 
he's playing. Putting out his hands he stresses how music has become far
 too divided.<br>
<br>
"It's stupid," he says. "If you like this music you can't like that 
music. And if you like that music you can't like this music. That's how 
it's gotten and we aim to smash all that. Transcend those barriers.<br>
<br>
"We get all kinds of ages at our gigs and that's great." At this point 
Dave Marsh enters the dressing room to tell us he's going and clearly, 
though we've only touched the tip of the iceberg, enough is enough. When
 Joyce comes in a minute later it really is time to go.<br>
<br>
As we pack up our stuff I ask Bruce a last question about a story he had
 told onstage that night. It had been told as an introduction to Bruce's
 version of Woody Guthrie's 'This Land Is Your Land', and concerned the 
time Bruce and Miami Steve had played a gig in Memphis and afterwards 
decided to visit Elvis's house at about three or four in the morning.<br>
<br>
"Was that true?" I asked. "Oh yeah," smiles Bruce.<br>
<br>
"Actually me and Steve were hungry and we asked this taxi driver where 
the best place to eat was. He said Gracelands and I said forget the 
food, let's go and visit Elvis."<br>
<br>
Which is what the boys did. The taxi driver wasn't too keen on the idea,
 however, and kept warning them about the dogs and guards that 
surrounded the house. Bruce took no notice and just told him to keep 
driving.<br>
<br>
When they got there Bruce scaled the wall to Elvis' house and started up
 the driveway. As he got nearer he could see that there was only one 
light on in the entire house.<br>
<br>
Suddenly from out of the woods, out stepped a guard.<br>
<br>
"What do you want," he asked, his gun hanging from his hip. "I come to see Elvis," said Bruce innocently.<br>
<br>
"He ain't here," the guard replied. "He's in Lake Tahoe."<br>
<br>
Figuring that the guard was lying, and glancing once more up at that 
window with it's light shining bright, Bruce explained he was in a band.
 They'd played Memphis that night. They were quite a popular band.<br>
<br>
In fact, Bruce had been on the cover of Newsweek ("and I never tell 
anyone that," laughs Bruce, "which shows what a cheapshot it was.").<br>
<br>
The guard remained unimpressed. "Well can you tell him I called?" asked 
Bruce. The guard said he would and Bruce walked back down the drive, 
glancing over his shoulder at that one room.<br>
<br>
"And you know," says Bruce, "that light in that room...it just had to be Elvis.<br>
<br>
As long as he keeps thinking that, then the Promised Land is still only just round the corner.<br>
<br>
WHAT'S HE really like? On my return to England I heard that phrase more 
times than I care to mention. And the answer was always the same.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is rare. Rare in that he is totally unlike any rock star – or whatever the phrase is – that I've come across.<br>
<br>
He actually is himself, not an image. There's no falseness, no show, no pretensions.<br>
<br>
He knows who he is and he isn't ashamed, nor does he try to hide 
himself. And he's intelligent, immensely likeable, a little vulnerable, 
moral, strong. And above all, alive.<br>
<br>
He refuses to go under, come Watergate or Reagan. Two incidents in Rotterdam last week show the kind of man he is.<br>
<br>
After the first gig, a party was held to give Bruce some platinum 
records. Dick Asher, who is a Very Important Person within his record 
company's scheme of things, had flown in to make the presentation.<br>
<br>
Only Bruce didn't make it. He felt ill. And his first responsibility is to his audience, not to bigshots.<br>
<br>
Earlier that night he had stood up and sung 'This Land Is Your Land'. 
He'd changed one of the last lines to "From California to the Streets of
 Brixton."<br>

Eulogy  delivered at the funeral of Clarence Clemons on June 21st, 2011 at Royal Poinciana Chapel in Palm Beach, Florida.</strong><br>
<br>
I’ve been sitting here listening to everyone talk about Clarence and 
staring at that photo of the two of us right there.  It’s a picture of 
Scooter and The Big Man, people who we were sometimes.  As you can see 
in this particular photo, Clarence is admiring his muscles and I’m 
pretending to be nonchalant while leaning upon him.  I leaned on 
Clarence a lot; I made a career out of it in some ways.<br>
<br>
Those of us who shared Clarence’s life, shared with him his love and his
 confusion.   Though "C" mellowed with age, he was always a wild and 
unpredictable ride.  Today I see his sons Nicky, Chuck, Christopher and 
Jarod sitting here and I see in them the reflection of a lot of C’s 
qualities. I see his light, his darkness, his sweetness, his roughness, 
his gentleness, his anger, his brilliance, his handsomeness, and his 
goodness.  But, as you boys know your pop was a not a day at the beach. 
 "C" lived a life where he did what he wanted to do and he let the 
chips, human and otherwise, fall where they may. Like a lot of us your 
pop was capable of great magic and also of making quite an amazing mess.
  This was just the nature of your daddy and my beautiful friend.  
Clarence’s unconditional love, which was very real, came with a lot of 
conditions.  Your pop was a major project and always a work in progress.
   "C" never approached anything linearly, life never proceeded in a 
straight line. He never went  A… B…. C…. D.  It was always A… J…. C…. Z…
 Q… I….!  That was the way Clarence lived and made his way through the 
world.  I know that can lead to a lot of confusion and hurt, but your 
father also carried a lot of love with him, and I know he loved each of 
you very very dearly.  <br>
<br>
It took a village to take care of Clarence Clemons.  Tina, I’m so glad 
you’re here.  Thank you for taking care of my friend, for loving him.  
Victoria, you’ve been a loving, kind and caring wife to Clarence and you
 made a huge difference in his life at a time when the going was not 
always easy. To all of "C’s" vast support network, names too numerous to
 mention, you know who you are and we thank you. Your rewards await you 
at the pearly gates.  My pal was a tough act but he brought things into 
your life that were unique and when he turned on that love light, it 
illuminated your world.  I was lucky enough to stand in that light for 
almost 40 years, near Clarence’s heart, in the Temple of Soul.<br>
<br>
So a little bit of history: from the early days when Clarence and I 
traveled together, we’d pull up to the evenings lodgings and within 
minutes "C" would transform his room into a world of his own.  Out came 
the colored scarves to be draped over the lamps, the scented candles, 
the incense, the patchouli oil, the herbs, the music, the day would be 
banished, entertainment would come and go, and Clarence the Shaman would
 reign and work his magic night, after night.  Clarence’s ability to 
enjoy Clarence was incredible.  By 69, he’d had a good run, because he’d
 already lived about 10 lives, 690 years in the life of an average man. 
 Every night, in every place, the magic came flying out of C’s suitcase.
  As soon as success allowed, his dressing room would take on the same 
trappings as his hotel room until a visit there was like a trip to a 
sovereign nation that had just struck huge oil reserves.  "C" always 
knew how to live.  Long before Prince was out of his diapers, an air of 
raunchy mysticism ruled in the Big Man’s world.  I’d wander in from my 
dressing room, which contained several fine couches and some athletic 
lockers, and wonder what I was doing wrong! Somewhere along the way all 
of this was christened the Temple of Soul; and "C" presided smilingly 
over its secrets, and its pleasures.  Being allowed admittance to the 
Temple’s wonders was a lovely thing.  <br>
<br>
As a young child my son Sam became enchanted with the Big Man… no 
surprise.  To a child Clarence was a towering fairy tale figure, out of 
some very exotic storybook.  He was a dreadlocked giant, with great 
hands and a deep mellifluous voice sugared with kindness and regard.  
And… to Sammy, who was just a little white boy, he was deeply and 
mysteriously black.  In Sammy’s eyes, "C" must have appeared as all of 
the African continent, shot through with American cool, rolled into one 
welcoming and loving figure.  So… Sammy decided to pass on my work 
shirts and became fascinated by Clarence’s suits and his royal robes.  
He declined a seat in dad’s van and opted for "C’s" stretch limousine, 
sitting by his side on the slow cruise to the show.  He decided dinner 
in front of the hometown locker just wouldn’t do, and he’d saunter up 
the hall and disappear into the Temple of Soul. <br>
<br>
 Of course, also enchanted was Sam’s dad, from the first time I saw my 
pal striding out of the shadows of a half empty bar in Asbury Park, a 
path opening up before him; here comes my brother, here comes my sax 
man, my inspiration, my partner, my lifelong friend.  Standing next to 
Clarence was like standing next to the baddest ass on the planet.  You 
were proud, you were strong, you were excited and laughing with what 
might happen, with what together, you might be able to do.  You felt 
like no matter what the day or the night brought, nothing was going to 
touch you.   Clarence could be fragile but he also emanated power and 
safety,  and in some funny way we became each other’s protectors; I 
think perhaps I protected "C" from a world where it still wasn’t so easy
 to be big and black.  Racism was ever present and over the years 
together, we saw it.  Clarence’s celebrity and size did not make him 
immune.  I think perhaps "C" protected me from a world where it wasn’t 
always so easy to be an insecure, weird and skinny white boy either.  
But, standing together we were badass, on any given night, on our turf, 
some of the baddest asses on the planet.  We were united, we were 
strong, we were righteous, we were unmovable, we were funny, we were 
corny as hell and as serious as death itself.  And we were coming to 
your town to shake you and to wake you up. Together, we told an older, 
richer story about the possibilities of friendship that transcended 
those I’d written in my songs and in my music.  Clarence carried it in 
his heart.  It was a story where the Scooter and the Big Man not only 
busted the city in half, but we kicked ass and remade the city, shaping 
it into the kind of place where our friendship would not be such an 
anomaly. And that… that’s what I’m gonna miss.  The chance to renew that
 vow and double down on that story on a nightly basis, because that is 
something, that is the thing that we did together… the two of us.  
Clarence was big, and he made me feel, and think, and love, and dream 
big. How big was the Big Man?  Too fucking big to die.  And that’s just 
the facts.  You can put it on his grave stone, you can tattoo it over 
your heart. Accept it… it’s the New World. <br>
<br>
Clarence doesn’t leave the E Street Band when he dies.  He leaves when we die.  <br>
<br>
So, I’ll miss my friend, his sax, the force of nature his sound was, his
 glory, his foolishness, his accomplishments, his face, his hands, his 
humor, his skin, his noise, his confusion, his power, his peace.  But 
his love and his story, the story that he gave me, that he whispered in 
my ear, that he allowed me to tell… and that he gave to you… is gonna 
carry on.  I’m no mystic, but the undertow, the mystery and power of 
Clarence and my friendship leads me to believe we must have stood 
together in other, older times, along other rivers, in other cities, in 
other fields, doing our modest version of god’s work… work that’s still 
unfinished.  So I won’t say goodbye to my brother, I’ll simply say, see 
you in the next life, further on up the road, where we will once again 
pick up that work, and get it done.  <br>
<br>
Big Man, thank you for your kindness, your strength, your dedication, 
your work, your story.  Thanks for the miracle… and for letting a little
 white boy slip through the side door of the Temple of Soul.  <br>
<br>
SO LADIES AND GENTLEMAN… ALWAYS LAST, BUT NEVER LEAST.  LET’S HEAR IT 
FOR THE MASTER OF DISASTER, the BIG KAHUNA, the MAN WITH A PHD IN SAXUAL
 HEALING, the DUKE OF PADUCAH, the KING OF THE WORLD, LOOK OUT OBAMA! 
THE NEXT BLACK PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES EVEN THOUGH HE’S DEAD… YOU
 WISH YOU COULD BE LIKE HIM BUT YOU CAN’T!   LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE 
BIGGEST MAN YOU’VE EVER SEEN!... GIVE ME A C-L-A-R-E-N-C-E.  WHAT’S THAT
 SPELL? CLARENCE! WHAT’S THAT SPELL? CLARENCE! WHAT’S THAT SPELL? 
CLARENCE! … amen.<br>
<br>
I’m gonna leave you today with a quote from the Big Man himself, which 
he shared on the plane ride home from Buffalo, the last show of the last
 tour.  As we celebrated in the front cabin congratulating one another 
and telling tales of the many epic shows, rocking nights and good times 
we’d shared, "C" sat quietly, taking it all in, then he raised his 
glass, smiled and said to all gathered, "This could be the start of 
something big."<br>
<br>
Love you, "C".</div>
