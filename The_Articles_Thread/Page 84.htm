<br>
WESTERN STARS<br>
<br>
BOBBY OLIVIER<br>
<br>
JUNE 11, 2019</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
During each of Bruce Springsteen’s marathon stadium concerts — amid all 
the joy, conviction and chest-pounding rock grandeur — there is always a
 bathroom song.<br>
<br>
This is typically a newer track — maybe something from 2009’s “Working 
on a Dream” or 2012’s “Wrecking Ball” — where as soon as the audience 
realizes what it is, hundreds of fans stream into the aisles, hurrying 
off to the restroom or to snag one last beer before the remainder of the
 nearly four-hour extravaganza.<br>
<br>
Everyone wins: the crowd gets a well-earned respite while Springsteen 
scratches the itch to play something actually written this century, even
 if it isn’t a tune his diehards consider sacrosanct.<br>
<br>
But what if The Boss composed an album almost entirely of “let me go pee
 real quick” triggers? Such is life on “Western Stars,” Springsteen’s 
highly anticipated and profoundly tedious new solo record — the Jersey 
icon’s most disappointing studio project in his nearly 50-year career.<br>
<br>
The 13-track album released Friday (his first official LP in five years)
 perpetuates Springsteen’s fascination with the disenfranchised of the 
American West, the same interest that spurred much of the thematic 
desolation present on fellow solo efforts, from “Devils and Dust” (2005)
 and “The Ghost of Tom Joad” (1995) all the way back to “Nebraska.” Only
 this time Bruce has forgone the austere folk-rock for in favor of Glen 
Campbell’s mollifying country-pop sound, specifically the lush 
orchestral arrangements that helped to define the Rhinestone Cowboy. The
 commitment to this style is absolute; “Western Stars” could double as 
the film score to a spaghetti western revival.<br>
<br>
Galloping strings, cheerful horns and shuffling rhythms far removed from
 the crack of Max Weinberg’s snare drum preside over most tracks. There 
are, to Springsteen and producer Ron Aniello’s credit, genuinely 
sweeping moments here — particularly on the jaunty “The Wayfarer” and 
the album’s cresting lead single, “Hello Sunshine.” But these big sky 
melodies do little to save the album from Springsteen’s cloying 
embodiment of hitchhikers, cowboy movie stars and — you guessed it — 
hard-working men too distraught to sleep.<br>
<br>
Since “The River,” Springsteen has written himself into other 
characters’ psyches and played first-person narrator, telling stories 
and juxtaposing them with his own emotional experiences. Few rockstars 
have ever been better in this respect, but here, Bruce playing John 
Wayne just feels like pablum, or at best a caricature of his far more 
compelling work on “Devils,” which at least had allusions to the war in 
Iraq to solidify its raison d’être.<br>
<br>
But This time there is no discernible purpose, no new ground covered by 
the 69-year-old songwriter fresh off his glitzy Broadway run. Instead, 
Springsteen sings overblown lines like this one, from a new dirge called
 “Drive Fast (The Stuntman)”: “At nineteen, I was the king of the dirt 
down at the Remington draw.” If that’s not a Springsteen lyric Mad Lib 
gone wrong, I’m not sure what is.<br>
<br>
Most of the tracks here play like B-sides; only the jangling “Tucson 
Train” and soaring pop ballad “There Goes My Miracle” are perhaps worth a
 replay, while “Sleepy Joe’s Cafe” and “Sundown” share all the appeal of
 two lanes blocked on the Parkway.<br>
<br>
To boot, the highly affected drawl Springsteen has adopted in dribs and 
drabs over the years — as early as “Nebraska” — is now more prevalent 
than ever, stretching phrases like “5:15,” sung on “Tucson Train,” into 
“fah-ve fif-tain.” Maybe the twang further endears The Boss to his 
southern faithful, but I’ll bet more than a few New Jersey fans will 
find this latest boot-and-saddle persona particularly inauthentic. The 
longer the man lives on a multi-million-dollar horse farm in affluent 
Colts Neck, the more difficult it becomes to imagine him blowing in from
 town to town, sauntering down dirt roads with a ol’ six string slung 
over his shoulder.<br>
<br>
“Western Stars” is, ultimately, a tumbleweed. It’s here for a few 
moments, but soon to be gone and forgotten, swept away by the howling 
wind that’s already begun to swirl around the news that Springsteen will
 record with The E Street Band this fall and then head back on the road 
for a full-band concert tour in 2020.<br>
<br>
With such a busy schedule, Springsteen has no current plans to tour in support of “Western Stars.”<br>
<br>
And for that, we should be grateful.</div>

STEVEN HYDEN<br>
<br>
june 12, 2019<br>
<br>
UPROXX</strong><br>
<br>
Ever since the release of 2014’s&nbsp;High Hopes&nbsp;— the least 
consequential and all-around worst studio album of his 46-year career 
—&nbsp;Bruce Springsteen&nbsp;has spent a lot of time publicly examining
 what it means to be Bruce Springsteen. He released a best-selling 
memoir,&nbsp;Born To Run,&nbsp;that delved deep into the relationship 
with his father — long one of the touchstones of his songwriting — and 
his private battles with mental illness. Then he mounted the wildly 
successful&nbsp;Springsteen On Broadway&nbsp;stage show, in which he 
likened to construction and performance of his “Boss” persona to a magic
 trick that conceals far more than it reveals.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
That’s a lot of palate-cleansing in the past five years. Luckily during 
this period, Springsteen also made his 19th studio album,&nbsp;Western 
Stars, apparently shelving it for a period until it felt right to 
release. A self-described “return” to solo recordings “featuring 
character-driven songs and sweeping, cinematic orchestral 
arrangements,”&nbsp;Western Stars&nbsp;seems ripe for comparison to 
Springsteen’s other solo albums, 1982’s&nbsp;Nebraska&nbsp;and 
1995’s&nbsp;The Ghost of Tom Joad.&nbsp;But in reality, it is quite 
unlike anything else he’s ever done. If his recent meta-musings cleared 
some space between Springsteen the man and Springsteen the 
icon,&nbsp;Western Stars&nbsp;feels like the start of a new creative 
path unburdened by his own rich history.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Springsteen has signaled ahead of time the influence of 
singer-songwriter records that came out of California in the late ’60s 
and early ’70s. That era’s impact on&nbsp;Western Stars&nbsp;is obvious 
and pervasive — the album evokes the strings-laden pop-country of Glen 
Campbell’s Jimmy Webb-penned hits of the time, as well as the 
Dylanesque, post-Nashville Skyline&nbsp;cosmic Americana of artists like
 Fred Neil, Kris Kristofferson, Mickey Newbury, and early Townes Van 
Zandt. Even Neil Diamond — whose florid, bombastic folk-pop peaked in 
popularity around the time that Bruce put out his first solo album in 
1973 — emerges as a reference point. Rather than lean into the trademark
 gravel of his stadium-rock prime, Springsteen sings 
throughout&nbsp;Western Stars&nbsp;in a full-throated croon supported by
 strings, mournful pianos, pedal-steel guitars, and waves upon waves of 
introspective melancholy.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It feels, in a way, like a portal to an alternate career arc for 
Springsteen. What if he had started out in the ’70s as a more 
straight-forward singer-songwriter, rather than the hybrid of Bob Dylan,
 Van Morrison, and Phil Spector that defined his early 
sound?&nbsp;Western Stars&nbsp;suggests that his gifts as a singer and 
writer of pop melodies — both of which are weirdly underrated — would 
have served him well.<br>
<br>
The songs themselves are still recognizably Springsteen. The title track
 is an instant classic of first-person narrative songwriting, sung from 
the perspective of an aging B-movie actor who sees his life slowly 
slipping away and can’t decide how he feels about it. Springsteen tells 
the story in a soft voice, like he’s still addressing an intimate 
theater audience. But his ability to draw the listener in with lyrical 
details that play like a movie in your head remains unparalleled:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Here in the canyons above Sunset, the desert 
don’t give up the fight / A coyote with someone’s Chihuahua in its teeth
 skitters ’cross my veranda in the night / Some lost sheep from Oklahoma
 sips her Mojito down at the Whiskey Bar / Smiles and says she thinks 
she remembers me from that commercial with the credit card”</em><br>
<br>
Much of&nbsp;Western Stars&nbsp;exists in a zone between the 
restlessness of “Hungry Heart” and the old-guy wistfulness of “Girls In 
Their Summer Clothes.” The protagonists are always in the process of 
picking up and leaving behind unsatisfying lives. “You start out slow in
 a sweet little bungalow, something two can call home / Then rain comes 
fallin’, the blues come calling, and you’re left with a heart of stone,”
 he sings in “The Wayfarer.” Marital discord also rocks the deceptively 
spritely “Tucson Train,” in which a man heads down south after carrying 
around “nothin’ for a long time.” He winds up, in the manner of all 
Springsteen protagonists, working construction.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
These people would never identify as “a river that don’t know where it’s
 flowing.” They aren’t n’er-do-wells in search of excitement. These 
characters are more weathered, less cocksure, and nearly out of options —
 they’ve aged along with the 69-year-old Springsteen. They’re looking 
for a place to settle down that offers at least the promise of 
contentment. Though all roads ultimately lead to the “Moonlight Motel,” 
the album’s funereal closer.&nbsp;<br>
Springsteen, again, sets the scene evocatively: “Now the pool’s filled 
with empty, eight-foot deep / Got dandelions growin’ up through the 
cracks in the concrete.” Perhaps if he had written “six-foot deep,” it 
would be too on-the-nose.<br>
<br>
None of these sentiments are out of place on a Springsteen album. 
However, some long-time fans might bristle at how unlike the E Street 
Band&nbsp;Western Stars&nbsp;sounds. It’s both slicker and more insular 
than his usual fare. (It’s also his most flat-out gorgeous record 
since&nbsp;Tunnel of Love.) It’s hard to imagine any track 
on&nbsp;Western Stars&nbsp;inspiring an arena full of people to hoist 
their beers and sing along. (Perhaps that’s why Springsteen recently 
promised that a more conventional and arena-ready Springsteen album with
 the E Street Band will soon be in the works.) Ultimately, it’s “just” a
 collection of songs, without any overriding political message.<br>
<br>
But to my ears&nbsp;Western Stars&nbsp;rivals 2007’s&nbsp;Magic&nbsp;— 
another “just songs” record — as Springsteen’s best LP of the 21st 
century. Like&nbsp;Magic,&nbsp;the new album thoughtfully addresses an 
issue that has plagued Springsteen since the early ’90s, which is how to
 best present his songs sonically. On albums like 2002’s&nbsp;The 
Rising&nbsp;and 2012’s&nbsp;Wrecking Ball,&nbsp;Springsteen’s attempts 
to appropriate modern production techniques sometimes came off as clunky
 and distracting. (Meanwhile, his reliance on Tom Morello for&nbsp;High 
Hopes&nbsp;was downright alarming.)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But on&nbsp;Western Stars&nbsp;— which Springsteen produced along with 
long-time collaborator Ron Aniello — the cozy and grandiose 
retro&nbsp;sound&nbsp;comfortably bears the load of communicating the 
essential emotional truths of the songs. For the most part, this is not a
 “lyrics first” record, in the manner of&nbsp;Nebraska&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tom
 Joad.&nbsp;Those records unfolded like collections of short stories. 
This album feels more like staring at a sunset through a cracked 
windshield. A sustained mood piece, first and foremost, in which lyrical
 clichès about hitch-hiking and barhopping are underlined and intended 
to evoke the feeling of hearing a sad and lonesome song from 50 years 
ago on your car stereo. Springsteen hears that song, too, and he invites
 us to ride shotgun on a road trip to sweet oblivion.</div>

THE BOSTON GLOBE<br>
<br>
JUNE 11, 2019<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen’s music has always been associated with the streets, 
cars, and blue-collar life, but since the beginning of his career, he 
has also been fascinated with the freedom, isolation, promise, and 
mythology of the American West. After all, those tramps weren’t dreaming
 of walking in the sun in Alabama. It should come as no surprise then, 
that after spending more than a year commuting from his New Jersey home 
to Broadway, Springsteen returns to the West and its open roads for 
inspiration on his superb new solo album, “Western Stars,” out Friday.<br>
<br>
Like all of the singer-songwriter’s best solo records, this collection 
of 13 songs is a curveball as he saves the electric guitars and booming 
drums for the next E Street Band album and explores a different side of 
his musical personality. Here, he takes a deep dive into orchestrated 
pop and country and western to examine wanderlust, heartbreak, and the 
desperate desire to make connections.<br>
<br>
<br>
“Western Stars” finds Springsteen in character study mode with finely 
detailed storytelling about broken (sometimes literally) men on a quest 
to find meaning, renewal, or maybe just a bit of love. At their core and
 stripped of their orchestral flourishes and diverse musical dynamic, 
most of the songs here would not be out of place on his dark, acoustic 
efforts, “Nebraska,” “The Ghost of Tom Joad,” or “Devils and Dust.” 
Instead of burrowing into stark existential unease and barren psyches, 
though, Springsteen is now far more interested in romantic yearning and 
the search for some kind of home.<br>
<br>
The narrators of these songs are an aging actor (“Western Stars”), a 
hitchhiker finding solace with whoever picks him up (“Hitch Hikin’”), a 
drifter (“The Wayfarer”), a stuntman fractured by work and life, and 
other isolated journeymen making their way through cheap hotels and 
waiting on trains that may never come. They are shells of their former 
selves, haunted by the past or the chaos in their heads (“If I could 
just turn off my brain”).<br>
<br>
<br>
Despite their brevity — only one track clocks in longer than five 
minutes — the songs, produced by the singer and Ron Aniello, have the 
cinematic grandeur of the westerns that numerous characters from 
Springsteen’s younger years dreamed about. The spacious “Chasin’ Wild 
Horses,” “Sundown,” and the title track feature stoic outsiders seeking 
redemption or to fill the hole in their hearts. In fact, the album could
 be called “The Searchers.”<br>
<br>
Unlike “Outlaw Pete,” the ill-conceived, meandering attempt at 
mythologizing a western antihero from 2009’s mostly enervated “Working 
on a Dream,” Springsteen’s writing here is masterfully concise, sharply 
observed, and self-aware. He knows he’s treading on familiar ground. In 
“The Wayfarer,” the narrator sings, “Same old cliché, a wanderer on his 
way.” On the Orbison-esque ballad, “There Goes My Miracle,” he works 
with poetic concision to tell a tale of failed love that speaks more 
potently than many of the songs of today’s morose, verbose wordslingers.<br>
<br>
A simple gratitude for life is imbued in the voice of these tracks — a 
wonder at waking up to another sunrise. This sentiment has frequently 
reverberated in Springsteen’s work. Only when the 69-year-old artist 
sings “I wake up in the morning just glad my boots are on/Instead of 
empty in the whispering grasses down the Five at Forest Lawn” in 
“Western Stars,” it carries more weight than when the 29-year-old sang 
“It ain’t no sin to be glad you’re alive” in 1978. This album balances 
gravitas and grace, burden and beauty, as well as any in Springsteen’s 
canon.<br>
<br>
<br>
For all the songs’ restless distress, ultimately this is an album marked
 by tentative hopefulness. What Springsteen understands is that while we
 often spend parts of our lives wandering in the desert, despondent with
 heads hung low, if we take a moment to glance up at the western stars, 
we just might see there’s still a little magic in the night.</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">A wilder Jersey Shore: Bruce Springsteen and Asbury Park<br>
It was the gold coast of rock. Now a new film featuring the Boss tells the town’s great story<br>
<br>
Nick Rufford<br>
THE LONDON TIMES<br>
May 19, 2019<br>
</strong><br>
It’s hard to cross the street in Asbury Park, New Jersey, without 
tripping over a gem of rock history. The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin 
and the Who played some of their earliest US concerts here. So did the 
Doors, Black Sabbath and the Clash. Most famously, it was the 
down-at-heel beach town that inspired Bruce Springsteen’s early music. 
He still lives on a ranch spitting distance away, and you can sometimes 
see him strolling on the boardwalk, baseball cap pulled low.<br>
<br>
The strip of cafes, restaurants and beachfront homes that runs from Long
 Branch to Manasquan is arguably to rock what Nashville is to country 
music and New Orleans is to jazz. How it earned its reputation is 
explained in a new documentary, Asbury Park:&nbsp;Riot, Redemption, Rock
 ’n Roll.<br>
<br>
The story begins in the 1960s, when Asbury Park became a melting pot. On
 the west side of its railway tracks were bars and clubs frequented by 
African- American musicians. On the east side were the upmarket hotels 
and ballrooms for New Yorkers who came to escape the traffic and summer 
heat. Jazz, soul and pop fused into what later became known as the New 
Jersey sound. It helped give birth to the music of Gary US Bonds, 
Southside Johnny and Joe Grushecky. Jon Bon Jovi played here when he was
 still performing as John Bongiovi and the Wild Ones, while the Ramones,
 the Runaways and George Thorogood and the Destroyers all honed their 
style in Asbury Park.<br>
<br>
The town’s reputation attracted the attention of Moe Septee, a Broadway 
producer, who in 1964 took over concert promotions at Asbury Park 
Convention Hall, a magnificent beachside theatre. In the next decade, he
 booked the Beach Boys, James Brown, the Byrds, Ray Charles, Janis 
Joplin, Otis Redding, the Temptations and Pink Floyd.<br>
<br>
Visitors from the Big Apple and further afield crowded into Asbury Park 
for the concerts, then radiated out into the town’s honky-tonk joints 
and nightspots to hear local acts. In 1968 there were 73 clubs, bars and
 ballrooms playing live music, all in the space of a square mile. Many 
were located on one street — Springwood Avenue — whose venues were razed
 to the ground in ugly race riots just as they became a symbol for 
interracial harmony<br>
<br>
The film tells the story through interviews with the musicians who 
created the Jersey sound and lived through the riots. “Asbury Park is an
 American Liverpool... Its story of tragedy and poetry and promise 
matters to everyone, not just people from New Jersey or Americans,” says
 Tom Jones, the film’s writer and director.<br>
Its star is Springsteen, whose career began in a tiny club called the 
Upstage, a sort of mirror image of the Cavern Club, being at the top of 
two flights of stairs instead of underground. The fact that it had no 
liquor licence worked in its favour; it became a mecca for the under-18s
 and a place where up-and-coming musicians — black and white — could 
show off their talents.<br>
“I came here [to the Upstage] by myself,” Springsteen recalls in the 
film. “I brought my guitar, made my way up the stairs [and] played Rock 
Me, Baby, Jeff Beck-style, with everything I had, setting off all the 
fireworks I could.”<br>
<br>
At one point, Springsteen’s fledgling band had three black and three 
white musicians, a racial balance almost unheard of at that time. 
“Springwood Avenue was a huge centre of African-American culture,” he 
says. “You went to the Orchid Lounge. It was a black club, but you could
 be white and go there, and it wasn’t any problem. They played a lot of 
jazz, but they also had soul entertainers come in.<br>
<br>
“Unlike Dylan or the Beatles, who I believe were musical 
revolutionaries, we were more alchemists. We took a little bit from 
here, a little bit from there, a little bit from soul, a little bit from
 pop, a little bit from the sound on the west side of the tracks, you 
know, and we kind of combined it all into the sound that this little 
part of the Jersey Shore became known for.”<br>
The cast of drunks, drifters and deadbeats — or, viewed from another 
angle, saints, angels and martyrs — inspired Springsteen’s Greetings 
from Asbury Park, NJ, whose ballads captured the grandeur of American 
working life.<br>
<br>
“The songs were culled from characters both real and imagined from the 
streets of Asbury Park,” he says. “The carney [carnival] atmosphere, the
 street atmosphere, the sort of punk poetry... it was just a part of the
 town at that moment, so that was how I translated it. [One day] I 
passed the postcard stand and I went, ‘Hmm, I like this. This is me, you
 know? This is where I’m from.’”<br>
<br>
When I talked to Springsteen last year, I had asked if it was a more 
innocent time. “Towns were very tight-knit, because much more of your 
life was concentrated in a smaller area, so your world was your 
neighbourhood. From this vantage point, yes, it was a more innocent 
time. But it was filled with a tremendous amount of bigotry.”<br>
<br>
Just as Asbury Park was being taken seriously for its music, the melting
 pot boiled over. On July 4 — Independence Day — 1970, rioting and 
looting took hold. “The city was tense, and eventually it exploded,” 
Springsteen says. “I was living in the surfboard factory, climbed on top
 of the water tower, and the clouds billowed off the shore for days. It 
was a sad moment in the city’s history, but it probably needed to 
happen.” Springfield Avenue was torched and the town entered a spiral of
 decline. The Upstage closed in 1971 and an era of great music was over.
 Springsteen wrote one of his best songs, 4th of July, Asbury Park 
(Sandy), to sum up the exodus, which states: “For me this boardwalk life
 is through.”<br>
<br>
“You forget, when Springwood Avenue burnt, the tremendous loss of 
African-American culture in the city, and that’s never quite come back 
the way it was at one time,” he says today. “[But] you have to proceed 
as if problems can be resolved, and as if the sun’s going to rise in the
 morning, and those better days are awaiting.”<br>
<br>
Asbury Park’s efforts to re-establish itself as a centre of musical 
talent ended with the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. 
But, according to the film, there are at last glimmers of hope. Money 
from the government’s emergency fund has breathed new life into the 
area. Shops that were boarded up long before the storm are reopening; 
boardwalks and piers that closed are back in vogue.<br>
<br>
As summer visitors return, a new scene is developing. “It got so low, it
 was like an open space, an open city,” Springsteen says. “The gay 
population came down and began to be real creative. Had some musicians, 
some artists come in, and it was a place where suddenly there was room 
to create.”<br>
Where there were ruins, there are now brightly painted beach bars and 
pastel houses. Seafront Victorian homes are being restored. The danger 
as the developers move in is that the ruins housing what is effectively 
the biggest open-air rock museum in the world will be bulldozed. See it 
now, before it’s gone.</div>

<br>
Springsteen does his time in the desert on&nbsp;Western Stars <br>
<br>
June 13, 2019 - The Backstreets Review by Christopher Phillips</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen, by his own admission, is no stranger to finding 
inspiration in the music he loves. As a songwriter, it's one of the aces
 up his sleeve. There's the Wall of Sound production of "Born to Run," 
the Suicide-esque "State Trooper," homages to Chuck Berry, the 
Raspberries, and the Beach Boys. Nods to the Drifters, Smokey Robinson, 
Van Morrison, Roy Orbison, The Animals... heck, like it or not, the guy 
was a "new Dylan" at one time. Don't forget Gary U.S. Bonds (what was 
"Sherry Darling" if not Bruce's stab at his own "Quarter to Three"?) and
 Elvis Presley ("Fire" says it all). "Man's Job" is such an effective 
Sam &amp; Dave-style number, Bruce even got Sam Moore to sing it with 
him. While other artists attempting this trick may rarely go beyond 
pastiche, Springsteen manages to make it all… Springsteenian.<br>
<br>
Western Stars, the inspired solo album that's long been Bruce's 
worst-kept secret (both he and Jon Landau have teased it in the press 
for years), sustains that trick for its entire running time. Springsteen
 and co-producer/multi-instrumentalist Ron Aniello return with the 
material that brought them together in the first place: a project with 
origins earlier in the decade, but set aside to pursue a line of writing
 that became 2012's Wrecking Ball. Through a succession of distractions —
 2014's High Hopes, the 2016 River Tour, a little project called 
Springsteen on Broadway — Western Stars sat and waited its turn. As 
successful a collection of songs as anything since Magic, as cohesive 
and thematically unified as Wrecking Ball, the time is right for the 
stellar Western Stars to have its moment in the sun.<br>
<br>
When the album was announced in April as "drawing inspiration in part 
from the Southern California pop records of the late '60s and early 
'70s," some might not have known whether to anticipate a Laurel Canyon 
vibe, the Beach Boys, or the Fifth Dimension. If you'd been paying 
attention, Springsteen was more specific about just what part of the 
West Coast scene he was thinking of in a 2017 Variety interview: "Glen 
Campbell, Jimmy Webb, Burt Bacharach, those kinds of records. I don't 
know if people will hear those influences, but that was what I had in my
 mind. It gave me something to hook an album around; it gave me some 
inspiration to write."<br>
<br>
To narrow the field further, there's a particular breed of song 
popularized in the late '60s and early 1970s, by Webb and others, that 
supplied the biggest transfusion to what runs through the heart of 
Western Stars. Think of Webb's "By the Time I Get to Phoenix" and 
"Wichita Lineman," Paul Williams' "Waking Up Alone," John Hartford's 
"Gentle on My Mind." And not just out of California: contemporaries were
 Kris Kristofferson's "Sunday Morning Comin' Down," Jim Croce's "I Got a
 Name," Neil Diamond's "Solitary Man," even Bobby Goldsboro's "I'm a 
Drifter." While Springsteen in the early '70s was focusing on Boardwalk 
trysts and gangs of wizard imps on various New York City cross streets, 
these songs were about men movin' down the highway, men who were very 
much alone.<br>
Call it independence or isolation, solitude or self-reliance, it's the 
themes of those songs —&nbsp;musicality aside, though obviously Western 
Stars does share instrumentation in spades — that resonate most with 
Springsteen's newest collection. Men With No Name, drifters, ramblers, 
men who are leaving, men who've been left.… these are the characters who
 populate Western Stars. As Tunnel of Love was a song cycle about love 
and commitment, this one is the flipside: a meditation on desolation, 
sun-bleached and seasoned by Springsteen's "lasting love affair with the
 desert." It's a lonely record.<br>
<br>
There's hardly a relationship on Western Stars that lasts longer than a 
car ride — in fact, the greatest amount of human connection you'll find 
is on the opening track, as a hitchhiker gladly heads down the road 
apiece. It's a series of encounters with characters that might as well 
be imported from previous Springsteen songs: a young expecting couple, a
 trucker, a hotrodder eager to blow 'em all out of their seats. The 
hitchhiker is "high on top of the world" in that trucker's cab, "a 
rolling stone just rolling on," as carefree as it gets.<br>
<br>
Next up, "The Wayfarer" doubles down on the theme and even nods 
knowingly at how well-trod this path is: "Same old cliché, a wanderer on
 his way, slippin' from town to town," Springsteen sings. But already, 
that devil-may-care feeling has given way to white-line fever, and 
there's clearly a life — and a love — the Wayfarer has left behind.<br>
<br>
From here on, we have stories of lonely men and love lost. Harkening to 
songs like "Reno" and "Dry Lightning," romances are only recalled in the
 form of hazy reveries and regrets. There are no Marys, Marias, Mary 
Lous, Wendys, Cynthias, or Janeys; the only women with proper names, May
 and Sally, are married to other men, mentioned only in passing. If 
there's a relationship at all in these 51 minutes, it's in "Stones" — 
and that one is so riddled by deceit there's not much else left. By the 
end of the record, the affair in "Moonlight Motel" is such a faded thing
 of the past it might as well be a ghost story.<br>
<br>
What these characters do have — well, those who aren't complete drifters — is work.<br>
<br>
Like many Springsteen characters before them, not only is their identity
 and self-worth tied up in the cross of their calling, vocations are 
often so specific you might crack a smile. In a line that's up there 
with "I'm a sergeant out of Perrineville, barracks number 8," or "I work
 for the county out on 95," our man in Tucson makes sure we know he has 
his crane operator's license. A few are in the entertainment business, 
like the songwriter of "Somewhere North of Nashville" and the 
sub-titular character in "Drive Fast (The Stuntman)." The latter fights 
through the pain and scars of his gig enough that you'll think 
immediately of Springsteen's soundtrack song "The Wrestler." Pins in his
 ankle, a cracked collarbone, a steel rod in his leg… what is it, for 
Bruce, about these guys who beat up their bodies for others' 
entertainment and keep on going? Ask the man who spent decades jumping 
off pianos and knee-sliding across the stage.<br>
<br>
In "Sleepy Joe's Café," the singer's trade isn't clear, but we know he's
 got the kind of working week that requires a place to blow off steam 
come Friday night, much as in "Working on the Highway," "All That Heaven
 Will Allow," and "Out in the Street." In "Chasin' Wild Horses," the 
title is not only a metaphor but also what this guy gets paid to do. We 
don't get details about his lost love, but we do know he's a contract 
worker in Montana for the Bureau of Land Management.<br>
<br>
Like that county lineman in Wichita, all this feels mostly like lonely 
work, with plenty of space for feelings to echo around. Jimmy Webb told 
the BBC that "Wichita Lineman" sprung from an image he retained from 
childhood, spying a lone repairman at the top of a telephone poll in the
 Oklahoma panhandle. "I thought, I wonder if I can write something about
 that? A blue collar, everyman guy we all see everywhere — working on 
the railroad or working on the telephone wires or digging holes in the 
street. I just tried to take an ordinary guy and open him up and say, 
'Look, there's this great soul, and there's this great aching, and this 
great loneliness inside this person, and we're all like that. We all 
have this capacity for these huge feelings.'"<br>
<br>
That's precisely what Springsteen seems to be going for on Western 
Stars. In these stories of men going it alone, Bruce doesn't look away 
from the cost of isolation —&nbsp;that's the entire raison d'être of 
lead single "Hello Sunshine," which is a straight admission of the 
price, the lure, and the wish to overcome it, after years of battling 
depression. But Springsteen still clearly finds depths, dignity, and 
plenty to admire in the solitary man. The instrumentation is often what 
conveys that POV. Springsteen comes right out and says he's "always had a
 sweet spot for the rain," and in the music that accompanies these 
stories, he can't help but romanticize the loneliness. When the horns 
and strings swell, as they often do, they evoke nothing as much as a 
heroic lone rider, looking out over a vast plain, in full CinemaScope.<br>
<br>
Springsteen describes Western Stars as "cinematic," and you can take him
 literally. That quality lies not just in the expansive, widescreen feel
 of the production in general, but in musical cues that directly evoke 
Western picture soundtracks. To describe the particular orchestral sound
 Springsteen has crafted here, that dominates the record, you don't 
necessarily need to call up Countrypolitan, the Nashville Sound, or 
Aaron Copland (who producer Aniello namechecked along the way). It's 
often as simple as this: cowboy movies. As a friend described the album 
after an initial listen, "It's like his next Broadway show is a Western,
 and Clint Eastwood directed."<br>
<br>
If an artist's job is "to get your audience to care about your 
obsessions" — as director Martin Scorcese said and Springsteen is fond 
of recounting — this album is a reminder that Bruce's obsessions go 
beyond girls and cars, and he's leaning hard on the Western in Western 
Stars. We know about Bruce's fondness for John Ford pictures, especially
 John Wayne in The Searchers — standing in the doorway but unable to 
bring himself to come inside, he'd be right at home on this album. Then 
there are early Springsteen songs like "Evacuation of the West" 
(featuring cowboys, rough riders, outlaws, and desperados), even a 
favorite childhood book, Brave Cowboy Bill, which helped inspire "Outlaw
 Pete." You feel it most in the music, the sound of those strings and 
horns evoking sun-streaked vistas of the American West and 
—&nbsp;remember all the movies? — the archetypal heroic horserider. 
These musical moments recall Western soundtrack themes, Spaghetti and 
otherwise, like "Once Upon a Time in the West" — a composition 
Springsteen loves so much he not only used it as introduction music over
 the years, he even recorded his own version of it for 2005's We All 
Love Ennio Morricone album. That recording combined symphonic strings 
and horns with Springsteen's guitar, surely a guiding star pointing the 
way to this new album.<br>
<br>
Gestures toward the Western become full-blown on the title track. The 
album's masterstroke, "Western Stars" is the crown jewel of what 
Springsteen described as "a jewel box of a record." Our protagonist is 
literally a Western star — well, if not a star, exactly, he's certainly 
done his time in cowboy pictures, took a bullet from The Duke as a claim
 to fame, and is still making a living on the set (even if he's 
currently shilling for Viagra). "Western Stars" marries a stirring 
melody with haunting lap steel and a slice-of-life lyric, capturing the 
wistful thoughts of an aging actor hanging in there in modern-day 
Hollywood. It's another spot in the country where the sand turns to 
gold, and when that soundtrack orchestration surges, you might even 
think this guy got himself a piece of it.<br>
<br>
"Western Stars" hammers home the double-meaning of the album title — not
 just the stars in the sky (or a Tennyson reference, if you want to get 
highfalutin' about it), but the stars on the screen. It's a triple 
meaning, if you consider California stars of 1960s and '70s AM radio. In
 addition to Webb, Campbell, Bacharach and the rest, you may also hear 
shades of Tom Waits — the young, clearer-voiced Southern Californian 
singer/songwriter heard on his first Asylum album, Closing Time — 
especially in the sing-song melody of "Hitch Hikin'." Scott Walker and 
the Walker Brothers are in there, too; as we previously noted, "Hello 
Sunshine" is Walker's "Sunshine" through the looking glass. In the end, 
part of the record's brilliance is its fusion of these different Western
 stars, the soundtrack composers and the '70s singers, to create a 
unique sound evocative of both at once.<br>
<br>
For all its symphonic flourishes, the album's sonic trump card is the 
reveal of Springsteen's "big" voice, blowing the whole fucking place 
apart on "Sundown" and "There Goes My Miracle." It's vocal prowess that 
can stand up to Bacharachian bombast for sure, and if you'd just heard 
the quiet drawl of "Somewhere North of Nashville" you might not have 
thought Bruce had it in him. Concertgoers have heard it, though — 
Springsteen's ability to practically open up his chest to rise above the
 din and match the energy in the room, however large. It's remarkable to
 hear it in the studio, paired with music that calls for that kind of 
majesty.<br>
<br>
With moments like these still likely to make a listener's jaw drop on 
his 19th studio album, you've got to hand it to Springsteen for never 
making the same record twice. There's some shared DNA with has previous 
solo outings, but Western Stars is a new, unified vision of a completely
 different aesthetic — a color Polaroid to the stark black-and-white of 
Nebraska or the daguerreotype of Devils &amp; Dust.<br>
<br>
That said, early buzz suggested this album sounded like nothing else 
Bruce Springsteen had ever done. That would be overstating it. The E 
Street Band sound has been string-heavy since The Rising, with Soozie 
Tyrell's addition to the proceedings, and a song like "Lonesome Day" is a
 notable antecedent here. (Tyrell shows up on background vocals for 
three songs, but she only plays fiddle on one; violins are mostly 
handled by the Avatar Strings and Stone Hill Strings). Familiar sounds 
abound: a baritone guitar recalls Tunnel of Love, and that big '60s pop 
sound is one Springsteen first experimented with on Magic ("Girls in 
Their Summer Clothes" being another sweeping portrait of loneliness) and
 to a greater degree on Working on a Dream. "Sleepy Joe's Café" feels 
like the "Mary's Place" of the album, as a requisite "happy party" song —
 you could practically sense it coming from the song title alone. Still,
 you can imagine the Sessions Band tearing it up for a live highlight, 
and indeed the track features Charlie Giordano on accordion as well as 
Sessions Band horn players.<br>
<br>
Lyrical concerns, too, mark this as a Springsteen joint — especially the
 push/pull between yearning for connection and going it alone, walking 
out on the wire versus finding a home. There are specific lyrical echoes
 from earlier works, like the ever-reliable "Last night I dreamed…," and
 even just recognizable, trademark cadences. (Fun game: sing "Reason to 
Believe" to the tune of "Western Stars." Mix-and-match with "Devils 
&amp; Dust" and "All That Heaven Will Allow.") "Sleepy Joe's" could 
easily be a little café we know so well from "Rosalita" — San Bernardino
 isn't so far from San Diego, in the scheme of things. "Tucson Train" is
 the most Springsteenian all around, one track it's easy to imagine in 
the regular E Street rotation. Despite its ambiguous, uncertain ending 
(a quality it shares, intriguingly, with so many songs on the album), 
it's also one of the most hopeful, as a "Back in Your Arms" story with 
what feels like a real shot at redemption in the key line: "I'll wait on
 God's creation / Just to show her a man can change."<br>
<br>
It's always tempting to find parallels between Springsteen and his 
characters. The guy who was "born to run," on the "outside looking in," 
searching for "the ties that bind"… he's present and accounted for. 
Considering Bruce's frank discussion of his own personal issues over the
 years, mental health and otherwise, a song like "Hello Sunshine" can be
 heard as remarkable self-analysis, a distillation of his struggles with
 isolation and depression. When he sings "if I could just turn off my 
brain" in "Tucson Train," it's easy to feel as much sympathy for the 
songwriter as for the character. But Springsteen himself feels just as 
present in the title track, a rider in the whirlwind who keeps putting 
butts in seats after all these years, glad his boots are still on. 
Stirring and sturdy, both modern and nostalgic, Western Stars has him 
shining bright yet again. Somebody get that man two raw eggs and a shot.</div>

Western Stars<br>
June 13, 2019<br>
<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen returns with elegiac and wise songwriting conjuring 
the golden expanse of the American West; it’s his best studio album in 
years.<br>
The voices in Western Stars are old and restless, lost and wandering. On
 the title track, Bruce Springsteen sings from the perspective of an 
actor who once worked with John Wayne but now mostly does 
commercials—credit cards, Viagra. Elsewhere, we meet a stuntman whose 
body has been destroyed by the job, a lonely widower idling in his old 
parking spot, and a failed country songwriter wondering if any of the 
sacrifices he made in his youth were worth it. Sung in a defeated growl,
 this latter track is among the shortest, starkest things that 
Springsteen has ever recorded: an acknowledgment of how quickly a 
song—and life—can pass by.<br>
<br>
That song is called “Somewhere North of Nashville,” and it’s an outlier 
on Springsteen’s 19th studio album, both geographically and musically. 
On the rest of the record, Springsteen, with producer Ron Aniello, aims 
to conjure the golden expanse of the American West, with sweeping 
orchestral accompaniments unlike anything in his catalog. Springsteen 
albums are usually grand affairs but he’s never made one that sounds so 
vast and luxurious throughout. Paired with the down-and-out characters 
who haunt its mountains and canyons, the purposefully anachronistic 
arrangements—recalling jukeboxes, FM radios, sepia-toned montages, faded
 memories—carry an elegiac tone. It’s been a long time since popular 
music sounded like this, and it ties these characters to an era as much 
as a place.<br>
<br>
Neither is where you expect to find Springsteen, who turns 70 this fall.
 He has spent the last few years drawing attention to the most beloved 
corners of his career, from lovingly curated box sets and live releases 
to an anniversary tour behind 1980’s commercial breakthrough The River. 
His nostalgic bent culminated in two presentations of his life story: a 
500-page memoir and a one-man Broadway show. Both begin with a wink 
toward his self-described fraudulence—an “absurdly successful” 
entertainer who made his fortune by telling stories of blue-collar 
workers—and end with solemn prayers and reflections on mortality. In the
 book, Springsteen discusses the struggles with depression that have 
threatened to derail him over the past 10 years. “Mentally, just when I 
thought I was in the part of my life where I’m supposed to be cruising,”
 he writes, “My sixties were a rough, rough ride.”<br>
<br>
All this looking back plays into the music of Western Stars. “Hell, 
these days there ain’t no ‘more,’” he sighs in the title track, “Now 
there’s just ‘again.’” Repetition and waiting course through the record 
as constants—sunrise, sunset. There’s a song called “Chasin’ Wild 
Horses” that prescribes its title as a means of counterbalancing pain; 
the arrangement grows more romantic as the chorus hardens into a 
routine. Springsteen’s narrative writing has always served to reflect 
his host of anxieties outward. A darkening mindset and feelings of 
isolation in his early 30s inspired him to summon the hellbound 
outsiders and dark highways of Nebraska; navigating his first marriage 
resulted in the doubt-plagued domestic portraits on 1987’s Tunnel of 
Love. During his exhaustive live shows, he is known to venture into the 
crowd to be swarmed by the community that’s united by his work. In the 
studio, he has to invent it himself: a sea of faces where he can find 
his own reflection. Western Stars transports him to a ghost town of 
broken male narrators, alone with their never-ending work and shortening
 timelines. He sings to us from somewhere among them, looking wearily 
beyond.<br>
<br>
Following 2012’s Wrecking Ball and 2014’s High Hopes—records that 
responded to current political issues and sought to modernize the E 
Street Band’s rock’n’roll exorcisms with loops and samples and Tom 
Morello—this music is a left turn. The stories, however, remain 
archetypically Springsteen. Occasionally, he sounds like he’s checking 
in with characters from his songbook, furthering them along or bidding 
them farewell. For those wild spirits who worked 9 to 5 and somehow 
survived till the night, there’s “Sundown,” a tour through a bittersweet
 twilight where you long for companionship. After all his promises of 
escape—these two lanes that could take us anywhere—there’s the hardened 
narrator of “Hello Sunshine,” cautioning that “miles to go is miles 
away.”<br>
<br>
And while nearly every one of Springsteen’s road songs is sung from the 
driver's seat, this record opens with “Hitch Hikin’,” a folk song 
propelled by a gentle windmill of strings, sung by a drifter with 
nowhere to go. He invites us into the backseats of three cars, whose 
drivers stand in for the pillars of Springsteen’s career. There’s a 
father, a trucker headed toward a big open highway, and a solitary racer
 in a vintage model from 1972, which also happens to be the year that 
Springsteen scored his record deal with Columbia. These avatars 
introduce a record that favors new sounds and perspectives—he often 
sings as a shadow or a visitor, giving credence to a recently revealed 
habit for crashing strangers’ funerals—but remains carefully rooted in 
his history. David Sancious, an early collaborator who played the 
virtuosic piano solo in 1973’s “New York City Serenade,” returns here to
 guide “The Wayfarer” to its tragic-triumphant conclusion. His jazzy 
touch on the keys offsets the thump of Springsteen’s acoustic guitar and
 the earthy twang of his baritone, as open-hearted and desperate as it 
has ever sounded.<br>
<br>
In this song, Springsteen reframes his wanderlust in a series of 
confessions. He acknowledges that put in his position most people would 
be happy with what they have. He knows his worries are nothing new. The 
title of Western Stars is a phrase that also appears in “Ulysses,” a 
19th-century Tennyson poem that Springsteen has drawn from before. 
(Another, more ubiquitous, Tennyson quote is invoked at the end of this 
record: “It’s better to have loved,” he sings in “Moonlight Motel,” his 
voice trailing off.) It’s easy to see why Springsteen finds resonance in
 these particular texts: defining works by a grief-stricken poet 
wondering if our brief, complicated lives are worth the legacy we leave 
behind. “Ulysses” is narrated by a hero approaching old age, returning 
from a long journey only to realize he felt more fulfilled on the road. 
So he heads out again, “to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.” 
And stay alive, if he can.</div>

<br>
When Uncut spoke to Jimmy Webb, the legendary songwriter admits he 
didn’t expect to ever be cited by Springsteen: “I had heard these 
rumours and thought, ‘Is it possible that this is true? This guy needs 
us like a migraine!’ I think it’s a very bold and admirable step, and it
 certainly shows that he’s connected with the ground. He’s planted down 
here with all of us. It shows there’s no snobbery in him.”<br>
<br>
Webb is particularly with impressed Western Stars’ lead single “Hello 
Sunshine”, a lovely, gentle ode to those happy moments that never seem 
to last as long as you’d like. “You know I always liked my walking 
shoes/ But you can get a little too fond of the blues,” sings 
Springsteen, over a chugging-train snare pattern and a fluttering 
finger-picked guitar. “You fall in love with lonely/ You end up that 
way.”<br>
<br>
It’s among the most revealing lyrics of Springsteen’s long career, a few
 lines that might unlock every song he’s ever written, and at least one 
way he has captured something integral to the Southern California pop 
music he’s emulating. “I was amazed at how he locked on to the sensual 
pleasure that can be derived from loneliness,” says Webb. “From what 
Warren Zevon used to call ‘splendid isolation’. And yet, at the same 
time, he’s recognizing there’s a danger there. There’s a dark side. That
 lonely road has its appeal, but at the same time he’s cautioning you: 
don’t get too far out there as you might not be able to get back. That’s
 so intense and personal. The largess of the artist in revealing that to
 the listener is amazing.”</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen and Madonna are subcultures now<br>
By Chris Richards<br>
Pop music critic<br>
WASHINGTON POST<br>
June 17 </strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen and Madonna have new albums out — and that’s nice for 
the millions who still love Bruce Springsteen and Madonna. What about 
the other billions of sentient listeners out there? These two deities of
 American song are currently scheduled to live forever, but in the 21st 
century their new music feels culty and peripheral. Turns out, even for 
superstars drawing breath at the highest levels, certain pop-laws just 
can’t be violated. Mass culture always becomes subculture. Like a ripple
 in the water, the center becomes the fringe.<br>
<br>
Springsteen and Madonna are wise enough to know this, so instead of 
trying to win new congregants, they sing to the faithful. It isn’t quite
 “fan service,” or whatever you want to call the dark art of 
appeasement. Instead, they’ve each created albums that don’t seem aware 
of just how strange they are. His is called “Western Stars,” and it’s 
crowded with sweeping strings and cartoon tumbleweeds. Hers is called 
“Madame X,” and it’s jammed with motley rhythms and confused virtue. His
 goes down way too easy — especially when he sings about trains, horses 
and “a chain-link fence rusting away.” Hers goes down way too hard — 
especially when she sings about wokeness, Supreme hoodies and “positive 
vibes.”<br>
<br>
For both Bruce and Madonna, all this strange work sounds strenuous, 
probably because they each have such massive legacies to uphold. Madonna
 once gave shape to pop’s future (Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, etc.) while
 Springsteen once gave shape to rock’s past (Bob Dylan, Creedence 
Clearwater Revival, etc.). Their blazing comet tails crossed on MTV back
 in 1984, when they were each setting the zeitgeist to melody with 
indelible hits (“Like a Virgin,” “Born in the U.S.A.”). But whereas 
those songs seemed to bloom into the world out of absolute necessity, 
the ditties on “Madame X” and “Western Stars” seem content to exist 
quietly inside their own terrariums.<br>
<br>
Both albums start auspiciously enough. Madonna recounts a beautiful 
drug-dream over a soothing reggaeton pulse: “I took a pill and had a 
dream/ I went back to my 17th year/ Allowed myself to be naive/ To be 
someone I’ve never been.” Meantime, off in the Western sunset, 
Springsteen sings a friendly melody from the perspective of a happy 
hitchhiker: “Maps don’t do much for me, friend/ I follow the weather and
 the wind.” Both songs allude to vast horizons, and the vastness makes 
for weirdness. Before long, Madonna is swapping awkward rhymes with 
Quavo of Migos while Bruce is singing along with a string orchestra that
 he seems to have recruited from a bank commercial.<br>
<br>
Obviously, Springsteen and Madonna are both serious pros, hardened and 
shrewd enough to anticipate the skepticism of passersby. So, on his 
album’s title track, Springsteen sings from the perspective of a 
washed-up Hollywood cowboy who gets spotted in a bar as the actor from 
“that commercial with the credit card.” And on “Looking for Mercy,” 
Madonna finds herself speaking directly to God, but perhaps the villains
 of social media, too: “Please don’t criticize/ Please, please 
sympathize.”<br>
<br>
These two could — should? — take these new songbooks straight to Las 
Vegas, a city where no one criticizes and all major credit cards are 
accepted. It’s a land of make-believe and make-money where pop stars can
 stack unfathomable fortunes performing the most-legible, 
least-disciplined versions of themselves. The big, hammy hook of 
Springsteen’s “There Goes My Miracle” would go over like crazy in Vegas.
 Same for Madonna’s “Dark Ballet,” during which our hero’s vocoded voice
 sings about witch-burning to a melody plucked from Tchaikovsky’s 
“Nutcracker.”<br>
<br>
They don’t need the money of Las Vegas, but they could use the shelter. 
Madonna and Bruce have always been real people with real ears pitched to
 the real world, but on “Western Stars” and “Madame X,” both suffer from
 varying degrees of tone-deafness. Springsteen has made a Western-themed
 album about men struggling to reclaim their dignity in an America 
that’s slowly fading away. His message for our changing world: Don’t 
forget about men! As for Madonna, during “Killers That Are Partying,” 
she makes herself the hero of a song about solidarity: “I will be gay if
 the gay are burned/ I’ll be Africa if Africa is shut down/ I will be 
poor if the poor are humiliated/ I’ll be a child if the children are 
exploited.” And then, “I know what I am, and I know what I’m not.” Is it
 possible for one of the most famous human beings on the planet to 
comprehend their incomprehensible privilege?<br>
<br>
They think they are part of our reality but they just can’t be. He’s 
Bruce Springsteen. She’s Madonna. All of the music that they’ve each 
made over the past 30 years carries at least some of this latent 
sadness. And nowadays, Bruce and Madonna sound saddest when they really 
show us their voices. We hear them best whenever they float a bright 
note on a long breath. They sound exposed, vulnerable, more like human 
beings than bronze busts. But how it all lands ultimately depends on 
what kind of human being you are. Nonbelievers might hear important 
people making unimportant music. The devout might hear proof that nobody
 really knows the right way through this life.</div>

Ann Powers<br>
NPR<br>
June 13, 2019</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
In 1981, after reading the paraplegic veteran Ron Kovic's memoir <em class="text-italics">Born on the Fourth of July</em>,
 Bruce Springsteen staged a concert to benefit the advocacy group 
Vietnam Veterans of America. For the encore, he played a song he hadn't 
performed before and hasn't since. Roger McGuinn's "The Ballad of Easy 
Rider" is a slow-rolling meditation on freedom's attractions and its 
costs that McGuinn wrote after Bob Dylan offered him one couplet 
scrawled on a napkin: "The river flows, it flows to the sea/wherever 
that river goes, that's where I want to be." The song soundtracks an 
idyllic early scene in Dennis Hopper's hugely influential 1969 road 
movie <em class="text-italics">Easy Rider</em>, as he and his co-star 
Peter Fonda (playing drug-dealing hippie outlaws named Billy and Wyatt) 
ride their motorcycles through a magical Southwestern landscape. It 
plays again over the closing credits, after Billy and Wyatt have been 
shot dead on a Louisiana back road by a passing redneck. Springsteen's 
cover, according to his biographer Dave Marsh, was a nod to veterans' 
love for the song, with its undercurrents of social exile and personal 
loss. Reworking it in concert, the Boss also paid tribute to a type of 
hit he often emulated on his own albums: the big, highly produced 
existential rock ballad, whose rise dates from around the time <em class="text-italics">Easy Rider</em> redefined the road movie as an expression of young people's confusion and weariness as the 1960s ended and the Nixon era began.<br>
<br>
It's possible to trace the path taken by Springsteen's new, highly orchestrated solo album, <em class="text-italics">Western Stars</em>,
 all the way back to his decision to cover "The Ballad of Easy Rider" 
thirty years ago. McGuinn's rendition in the film is relatively spare, 
but his band The Byrds released a version featuring a string section, 
added by producer Terry Melcher, to up its odds of becoming a Top 40 hit
 in the style of popular crooners like Glen Campbell. In Springsteen's 
take (findable on YouTube) Danny Federici's trickling piano lines fill 
in for the strings, echoing their presence in a ghostly but convincing 
way. Now, all this time later, Springsteen has found his way to those 
strings.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's embrace of what became known around 1966 as "orchestral 
pop" has struck many who've heard Western Stars as a major turn, one 
perhaps inspired by his recent time spent on Broadway, the home of show 
tunes. But <em class="text-italics">Western Stars</em> is not the Boss's <em class="text-italics">West Side Story</em>. Instead, it connects to a different sensibility altogether, one closer to <em class="text-italics">Easy Rider</em> and other cinematic landmarks of the imploding 1960s cultural revolution. More pointedly, <em class="text-italics">Western Stars</em>
 connects to a certain stream of pop balladry that emerged in tandem 
with Hollywood's turn toward hippie antiheroes – songs that ask a 
question similar to the one haphazardly posed by <em class="text-italics">Easy Rider</em>:
 Who gets hurt when people, especially men, try to be free? "All he 
wanted was to be free, and that's the way it turned out to be," McGuinn 
sings in "Easy Rider," contemplating the crash on the highway where 
Wyatt and Billy lay.<br>
<br>
Writing in 1975, the film theorist Thomas Elsaesser coined the term "the pathos of failure" to describe the feeling movies like <em class="text-italics">Easy Rider</em>
 captured — the poignancy of modern masculinity's fatalistic drift. In 
Fonda's Wyatt, an American flag patch affixed to his motorcycle jacket, 
he saw a new kind of antihero. Leather-clad and slim, this "unmotivated 
hero" wanders the landscape not looking for anything in particular, but 
not really escaping either, just spinning wheels. His psychic exhaustion
 has no room for the driven energy earlier road-bound heroes possessed, 
whether they were the Wild West's cowboys or the nervous escapees of 
film noir. Those characters usually met gruesome ends but still believed
 in themselves, or in trying, at least. The unmotivated hero has no 
hope, and no feeling that it matters whether he does or not. This 
attitude resonated at the turn of the 1970s, as a would-be cultural 
revolution gave way to the square realities of mainstream life: Nixonian
 politics, suburban sprawl, what Elsaesser called "stunned moments of 
inconsequentiality." On <em class="text-italics">Western Stars</em>, in songs that aren't particularly attached to a historical moment, Springsteen pursues a similar mood of anomie.<br>
<br>
Masculine damage is one of Springsteen's great topics, and it's not at all surprising that he revisits it throughout <em class="text-italics">Western Stars</em>.
 Over the decades he has written hundreds of humbly nihilistic lines 
like the one that opens the album's symphonic yet still somehow 
modest-feeling title track: "I wake up in the morning, just glad my 
boots are on." Continuing his long line of unreliable narrators, the 
voices in these songs mostly belong to older inhabitants of unstable 
professions – the movie industry, songwriting, shift and contract work –
 who pine for more stable lives with the women upon whom they rely, but 
are convinced they can't return to them. These characters are more 
seasoned versions of the petty street criminals of Springsteen's early 
and mid-period work, kin to the broken soldiers and immigrant drug 
runners of his 1980s and 1990s albums, and also to the "I" he inhabited 
on his more autobiographical solo albums, expressing various states of 
mental unrest.<br>
<br>
Springsteen often uses the ballad form to tell the stories of these 
unstable characters, and he's challenged himself to keep the music 
fresh. On 1982's <em class="text-italics">Nebraska</em> he recorded at 
home, by himself, producing a sound that some considered "folk" but 
which was closer to the work of edgy singer-songwriters like Townes Van 
Zandt. 1995's <em class="text-italics">The Ghost of Tom Joad</em> 
conscientiously connected to folk traditions. More recently, he's worked
 with pop-savvy studio men like Brendan O'Brien and Ron Aniello, who's 
also behind <em class="text-italics">Western Stars</em>, dipping more 
than a toe in the classic pop sound he's now fully embraced. Two of his 
best songs from this century, "The Wrestler" and "Girls in Their Summer 
Clothes," could have easily appeared on <em class="text-italics">Western Stars</em>,
 with their stories of alluring ramblers who are starting to fade into 
the cultural background, set within sumptuous arrangements. This album 
feels like an extension of that work. His characters here voice a 
hard-won maturity, though most remain unfulfilled. Sometimes, as on the 
sanguine early single "Hello Sunshine," they even are able to compromise
 their dreams and settle for a kind of happiness. They represent the 
imagined afterlives of the unmotivated heroes of <em class="text-italics">Easy Rider</em>, trying to figure out what their unexpectedly longer lives mean.<br>
<br>
To find inspiration for stories like these, Springsteen looked not to 
the movies of his young adulthood, which usually ended in fiery 
explosions or shootouts or sudden cuts to black, but to the songs that 
brought the unmotivated hero's voice to the radio in the same cultural 
moment. Early reviews of <em class="text-italics">Western Stars</em> 
note the sources: the songbooks of rock and soul-inspired 1960s and 
1970s hitmakers like Jimmy Webb, Harry Nilsson and the team of Burt 
Bacharach and Hal David. Their songs don't sound like they belong to 
outsiders: awash in violins and woodwinds, they claim none of the 
raucousness of rock and roll. But they express loss, and the state of 
being lost, as effectively as <em class="text-italics">Easy Rider</em> 
did in its more unhinged and violent way. "Everybody's Talkin'," written
 by Fred Neil and covered by Harry Nilsson in a version that became the 
theme for another key film of 1969,<em class="text-italics"> Midnight Cowboy</em>,
 is a prime example. Neil's original version was spare, but Nilsson's 
adds strings, and they almost constitute a drone, creating an undertow 
that propels the guitar and lightly brushed drum and Nilsson's slippery 
vocals down the river toward oblivion. "Everybody's talkin' at me," he 
complains. "I can't hear a word they're sayin', only the echoes of my 
mind." The song is an expression of paranoia as much as it is a 
declaration of independence; it's about pushing off, but never landing.<br>
<br>
How did songs like this, so obviously about trouble and defeat, find a 
home at the heart of mainstream pop? Making losers beautiful, they 
poetically reinforced the anxieties many people were feeling about the 
costs of freedom. Vietnam was coming to its ugly end, and the kids who'd
 hoped to change the world were starting to feel the damage their more 
reckless moments had wrought. A beautiful arrangement could hold the 
dark emotions of those times in a comforting embrace. This paradoxical 
combination is still what resonates about these songs. It's what brings 
the tears when we listen to the best songs by Jimmy Webb, like the 
soldier's anguished self-elegy "Galveston" or the workingman's crisis of
 faith "Wichita Lineman." The pathos of this music resides in its blend 
of musical sophistication and lyrical rawness. This is what Springsteen 
finds on <em class="text-italics">Western Stars</em>. Maybe it felt like
 a chance to take a path he'd avoided as a young rocker more intrigued 
by soul music and then punk; maybe he also recognized an echo that 
resonates today — a comforting musical palette that offered room to 
ruminate at a historical juncture, like our own, imbued with anxiety. 
"Make it easy on me just for a little while," Nilsson sings in "Don't 
Forget Me," another song that Springsteen might have spun while writing 
these. He's begging a lover he's probably wronged to put up with his 
pathetic ways, or at least his memory, for a little while; but he's also
 defining what his song does for the listener, creating a velvet cushion
 upon which to rest while pondering rough realities.<br>
<br>
It's easy to make a playlist full of tracks like this from the 1960s and
 1970, any of which might have been inspiration for Springsteen as he 
crafted <em class="text-italics">Western Stars</em>. Start with "Early 
Morning Rain," written and recorded in 1966 by Gordon Lightfoot, one of 
the key figures in the mainstream folk revival, which embraced new sonic
 approaches – including string-kissed, Beatles-inspired arrangements – 
to render the sounds and stories of traditional music more accessible. 
The key line in Lightfoot's song — "You can't jump a jet plane like you 
can a freight train" – brings folk into the aerospace age, replacing the
 Woody Guthrie-era image of the wandering hobo with a less romantic one,
 of a traveler stranded by his own limitations within the cold confines 
of city life. Here, the drifter becomes modern. Folk rock offered many 
memorable takes on this figure over the years: the more sanguine one in 
Tom Rush's "No Regrets"; the beautifully bitter "Good Time Charlie's Got
 the Blues," by Danny O'Keefe; the drugged-out version in John 
Phillips's "Holland Tunnel"; Jackson Browne's road dog considering his 
lot in "The Load Out." This is the easy rider who makes it long enough 
to feel washed up. He shows up a few times on <em class="text-italics">Western Stars</em>:
 He's the songwriter who didn't make it in "Somewhere North of 
Nashville," and the stunt man who's feeling the pain of his injuries in 
"Drive Fast."<br>
<br>
Country music is another prime conduit for exquisitely rendered 
existential angst. In tandem with the blues, it developed as music's 
repository of fully adult stories: It's where divorce, parenting, aging 
and other complex topics are tackled, and where subjects age, too, 
facing the consequences they've generated. In the 1960s, as it 
intersected with folk and, more subtly, rock, country also explored the 
tension generated when unvarnished emotions met ornate orchestration. 
Stars like Kris Kristofferson, Glen Campbell, Charlie Rich, Ronnie 
Milsap, Bobbie Gentry and even Elvis Presley made powerful songs at this
 crossroads. So did Nashville-influenced rockers like Bob Dylan and Neil
 Young, whose "A Man Needs A Maid," from 1972, is one the most 
vulnerable and disturbing musical expressions of the pathos of failure 
ever recorded. The lyric's deeply vulnerable (and paternalistic) 
expression of masculinity's emotional shortcomings – Young literally 
cries for a woman to help feed and clothe him, but then go away — gains 
its pathos from a grand orchestral arrangement. It's a lot like what 
Springsteen reaches for on <em class="text-italics">Western Stars</em> – long-cultivated loneliness turned into high drama.<br>
<br>
The crisis Young expresses in "A Man Needs a Maid," like the one 
Springsteen's faithless lover faces in "Stones," doesn't immediately 
seem like a political one; and yet it is a reckoning with masculinity, 
an expression of how clinging to its privileges can destroy intimacy and
 make a man feel lost. The legacy <em class="text-italics">Western Stars</em>
 taps traveled similar ground when artists like Bill Withers or Marvin 
Gaye carried it into soul. "Gotta keep movin'," Gaye sings in "Trouble 
Man," exuding machismo but also deep disquiet. The song's sumptuous 
groove soothes but the voice at its core unsettles. A trouble man is a 
troubled man.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Western Stars</em> sends this message, too, 
from a different point in time. The antiheroes Springsteen brings to 
life are not young men playing fast and loose with their destinies; 
they're not <em class="text-italics">Easy Rider</em>'s Wyatt and Billy, 
nor are they his own earlier takes on those same characters, the Spanish
 Johnnys and Eddies and ragamuffin gunners he created in the 1970s. The 
men who populate <em class="text-italics">Western Stars</em> have sought
 freedom and know its edges in an unfree world. He knows these men well;
 on some level, they are him. Honoring a musical legacy he loves, 
Springsteen finds new life in familiar stories. "All he wanted was to be
 free, and that's the way it turned out to be," McGuinn wrote in the 
song Springsteen shared so long ago. <em class="text-italics">Western Stars</em> finds new places where that line can lead.</div>

<br>
By Aaron Slutkin <br>

The Duke Chronicle</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen has always been a journeyman, but these last five 
years have been different. Since the release of “High Hopes” in 2014, 
fans have been treated to 123 tour dates, a bestselling memoir in “Born 
to Run,” a Tony award winning show in “Springsteen on Broadway” and its 
accompanying Netflix special — a prolific and stunningly diverse body of
 work, no doubt, but missing something: a new album.<br>
<br>
On Friday, Bruce Springsteen returned to vinyl with his 19th studio 
album, “Western Stars,” billed in its announcement as featuring 
“character driven songs and sweeping, cinematic orchestral arrangements”
 inspired by the late-60s valley pop of Jimmy Webb and the late Glen 
Campbell. Character-driven songs are familiar to Springsteen fans — 
writing short stories or screenplays in single songs has been his finest
 craft since “Nebraska” was pressed in 1982 — but while orchestral pop 
was featured on 2009’s “Working on a Dream,” “Western Stars” largely 
breaks new ground. An album which almost always creates stunning and 
fresh music for its uneven lyrics to occupy, “Western Stars” ranks among
 the best of Bruce Springsteen’s eight solo works.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Wanderlust is a constant theme of this album. “Western Stars” opens with
 “Hitch Hikin’,” a song with little plot beyond what the title 
indicates. Still, while the verses are only barely colored in with 
faceless characters, “Hitch Hikin’” is a strong introduction to the 
album. Featuring gorgeous and deeply immersive orchestral work which 
builds over its three-and-a-half minutes, the strings reach their peak 
as the narrator rides with a “Gearhead in a souped-up ‘72 [who] wants to
 show a kid just what this thing’ll do.” As “telephone poles and trees 
go whizzin’ by,” the arrangement and soaring vocals remind the listener 
that like old cars, the Boss, soon to be 70, has still got it. Its 
horn-laden followup “The Wayfarer” offers a less jubilant kind of 
restlessness. Springsteen sings, “Some folks are inspired sitting by the
 fire, slippers tucked under the bed / But when I go to sleep I can’t 
count sheep for the white lines in my head.” For writer and character 
alike, staying still just won’t do.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The eponymous song, “Western Stars,” is the album’s best track. 
Decorated by a 20-piece band including a steel pedal guitar, a solid 
guitar strum and dazzling strings, “Western Stars” follows an actor, 
once “shot by John Wayne,” these days drinking too much and starring in 
Viagra ads — an imposing metaphor.&nbsp;<br>
The song implies a double meaning in the idea of “Western Stars.” At the
 album’s best, western stars are people. Some are literal stars — actors
 and stuntmen — but most are not. They are a “rolling stone... hitch 
hikin’ all day long,” a “wayfarer....drift[ing] from town to town,” a 
crane operator “down and out in ‘Frisco,” a Montana Bureau of Land 
Management contractor “chasin’ wild horses”; no heroes or villains, just
 workingmen and cheats, in isolation, always in movement. The album is 
dedicated to them: on “Western Stars,” Springsteen sings, “Here’s to the
 cowboys, riders in the whirlwind.” Such is Springsteen’s gold, and when
 “Western Stars” shoots for more plot-heavy songs, the lyrics are 
rewarded; otherwise, when “Western Stars” tends to mean something more 
esoteric or celestial, the lyrics are vapid, even if they are pretty.<br>
<br>
“Chasin’ Wild Horses” is “Western Stars”’ most sonically ambitious work.
 The verses’ beaten down vocals are accompanied by quiet violin work and
 whining slide guitar, while the choruses are blown open by a sound fit 
for a movie or a theme park — the kind of sound the album’s art conveys.
 If there’s such a thing as a “western sound,” “Chasin’ Wild Horses” is 
it. Paired with the more upbeat “Sundown,” which might be Springsteen’s 
vocal peak in a decade, it is a wonder and a feat of albumwork that 
these two songs can appear on the same record as the notably sparse but 
still beautiful “Moonlight Motel” or “Somewhere North of 
Nashville.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
“Drive Fast (The Stuntman)” and “Stones” leave the album’s weakest 
impressions. The former, about a stuntman whose body has gone to hell, 
feels out of touch with the album’s theme of redemption; if “Tonight, 
the Western Stars are shining bright again,” where does this song 
belong? And “Stones,” “Western Stars”’ only relationship-centered song, 
can only suffer Springsteen singing, “Those were only the lies you told 
me,” so many times. Still, “Stones” features excellent vocal work by a 
singer who should have entered his twilight years by now.&nbsp;<br>
“Western Stars” does feature more radio ready numbers. The best of these
 is “Tucson Train,” released as the album’s final single. Tucson Train 
is the story of a character straight outta Kerouac&nbsp; — once “down 
and out in ‘Frisco, tired of the pills in the rain,” now turned 
workingman,acknowledging that “hard work will clear your mind and body.”
 Waiting for his baby on the “Tucson Train,” he’s found redemption. But 
whereas Tucson Train offers a level of sophistication that can forgive 
its cheaper sound, its commercial companions, “Sleepy Joe’s Café,” and 
“There Goes My Miracle,” find themselves close to “Mary’s Place,” where 
the song listens nicely, but the art begs for something more.&nbsp;<br>
Springsteen sounds his most mature and assured on “Hello Sunshine,” a 
song about the depression Springsteen suffers from and has increasingly 
revealed to audiences. On “Hello Sunshine,” Springsteen admits, having 
once had “a little sweet spot for the rain” and an affection for the 
“empty road”; but, channeling, maybe, the insight earned by a critically
 acclaimed memoirst and a Tony Award winner, he asks, “Hello, sunshine, 
won’t you stay?” A nice redemption song for a long suffering 
artist.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
“Western Stars” is a new direction for the Boss, but not one he will 
chase further: It is well established in Springsteen scuttlebutt that 
Bruce’s next album will be one featuring the E Street Band, accompanied 
by another world tour. A more familiar direction for Bruce Springsteen, 
no doubt. But, even if “Western Stars” represents an(other) aberration 
in Springsteen’s discography, it is not a weak one. Looking forward into
 his seventies and still finding new direction, “Western Stars” is a 
triumph of songwriting and arrangement.&nbsp;</div>

THE BRIDGE CONCERT</strong><br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">With one brilliant performance, Bruce 
Springsteen takes his music back as his own and finds a path out of the 
darkness. . . BY CHARLES R. CROSS</em><br>
<br>
"THIS A SONG ABOUT A SNAKE THAT COMES AROUND TO EAT ITS TAIL."<br>
And with that, Bruce Springsteen raised his guitar to an angle more 
associated with Flamenco guitar playing, and ripped into the most 
intimate and personal performance in the last decade of his career. As 
he sang the tune — sounding for all the world like Leadbelly — the words
 were familiar but the message was brand new: "I was born down in a dead
 man's town." With one deft stroke, with one moan of his voice on the 
chorus, Bruce Springsteen was able to diffuse two years of co-option by 
the Rambo­brains of the world, by the Chrysler ads, by the marketing 
geniuses, all of whom had taken his song away from him. And with one 
line, he reclaimed it, made it his own again and spit it out with all 
the fire it was born with.<br>
 <br>
"Born in the USA" was the highlight of a set of highlights, on a night 
of highlights in the crisp Bay air. The scene was the Shoreline 
Amphitheatre, October 13, at The Bridge Benefit, a night of all acoustic
 music by the likes of Neil Young, Torn Petty, Nils Lofgren, Don Henley 
and Bruce Springsteen. <br>
<br>
In the past year we've seen megastar benefits of all sorts but this was 
the first one Springsteen chose to do. Unlike most benefits, this one 
was low key. The organizers intentionally tried to minimize the 
publicity. There was only one ad in a San Francisco newspaper for 
tickets and almost no national press in advance. Still, just the mention
 of a Bruce Springsteen show of any sort, brought in over two million 
requests for the 17,000 seats available. A lottery system was used to 
determine who got seats — most people simply got their requests back, 
stamped "Sorry, Concert Sold Out." <br>
<br>
Those who got in saw a real treat. The show opened with Neil Young doing
 "Comes a Time" and "Heart of Gold," solo with guitar. Then Young looked
 over to the left and said, "Fd like to bring out my friend Bruce to 
help me do a song. You too Nils." And out came Bruce and Nils, the crowd
 went nuts and the trio played "Helpless." Lofgren has been a long-time 
friend and bandmember with both Springsteen and Young and he introduced 
the two while both were touring Australia. Springsteen then joined Young
 on stage in Oz for a brief but rocking set. The Mountain View benefit 
was the quiet, acoustic side to the pairing. Springsteen's contribution 
was just in rhythm guitar and background vocals but it was clear hè knew
 the song and hè obviously enjoyed playing with Neil.<br>
 <br>
Then the E Street boys left the stage and Young pulled out another, 
perhaps even bigger surprise— Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and David 
Crosby. Crosby was fresh out of jail and looked healthier than he did a 
year ago, though he's now bigger than a house. The quartet had not 
played a full set together since the early 70s and their performance on 
such tunes as "Only Love Can Break Your Heart" and "Ohio" were stunning —
 a reminder that this was once a supergroup. <br>
<br>
Young played for a total of 30 minutes (each performer was slated for 
only 30 minutes) and gave way to Nils. Lofgren's set was the most 
personal and introspective of the evening. He did a heartfelt version of
 "Keith Don't Go" and a beautiful "Wonderland." But the biggest applause
 was reserved for a song he introduced as "by my friend Bruce. Bruce 
Springsteen that is." He didn't need to explain what Bruce as he broke 
into "Man at the Top," an unreleased Springsteen tune that Nils has 
taken a fondness for.<br>
 <br>
Next out was Don Henley fronting a four-piece acoustic band that 
included Timothy Schmidt and J. D. Souther. They did a great "Boys of 
Summer" and reprised several Eagles' hits, closing with a mournful 
version of "Desperado," sort of the California version of "Racing in the
 Street." <br>
<br>
Tom Petty was next and his set was the most disappointing. Though 
Petty's pop tunes sound great on the radio, songs like "American Girl" 
when done acousticaily had littie impact and thus served to highlight 
how much Petty depends on those Roger McGuinn-style-guitar riffs to fuel
 his songs. Petty closed with "Twist and Shout," a song that's hard to 
critically analyze since in comparison to Springsteen's version it 
wasn't even in the same ballpark (in fact a recent solo Richard Thompson
 "Twist and Shout" performance may be the definitive version of this 
Standard). <br>
<br>
Robin Williams then came on and did a hilarious 20 minute set, including
 his now famous Elmer-Fudd-does-Bruce-Springsteen­doing-"Fire." The rest
 of his stuff was genius—Williams at this point in time, boosted by a 
"60 Minutes" appearance and on a cross-country tour, is, as they say in 
the comedy business, hotter than a pistol. <br>
<br>
But hotter than that was the next man to come on stage. For his first 
song he walked out alone, no guitar in hand, pointed at the crowd and 
said — "Yesterday I went shopping buddy down to the mail" His arms were 
at his side poised like a gunfighter, and to emphasize each verse he'd 
point with his finger and stomp his boots. It was one of the few 
acappella versions of anything he'd ever done in his career and it had 
all the power of a freight train. Critics have long talked about Bruce's
 "Pink Cadillac" rant as being mirrored after gospel preachers but his 
"You Can Look" was the ultimate in Boss preaching — Pat Robertsen look 
out. It was clear from the choice of the opening selection, and from the
 style of its performance, that this was not going to be the Bruce  
Springsteen show everyone had expected (three Nebraska tunes and an 
acoustic "Promised Land" took the smart money before the show). And when
 Bruce grabbed his guitar and broke into his masterful version of "Born 
in the USA," it was clear he had broken all the rules and that for this 
show he was starting all over again, building these songs up from the 
simple melodies and lyrics they started as, creating the characters all 
again, giving them life, breath and stance. There was a hushed silence 
in the crowd after the song—it wasn't clear if everyone had fainted, 
died and gone to heaven or if the shock of hearing this song like this 
for the first time was just too much for people. One of the real 
highlights of the evening was the politeness of the crowd — the idiots 
with the headbands had stayed home. Here was a crowd with an 
appreciation for the tradition that rock 'n' roll began with — imagine 
if Springsteen's Nebraska material had been given this respect 
throughout the Born in the USA tour. <br>
<br>
Bruce must have felt naked on stage alone because he then called out 
Danny Federici, wearing an accordian, and Nils, with an acoustic guitar,
 and the trio formed an abbreviated E Street Band (sort of the E Street 
Jug Band minus the jug). Bruce jokingly called out "Big Man, where are 
you?" But the joke ended when the trio poured into "Seeds. "Seeds" is 
the story of the oil depression's effect on the modern day Okies of 
Houston. Springsteen performed it frequentiy on the stadium jaunt and it
 was one of the singular high points of those shows. But its impact here
 was even greatened — slowed down, the lyrics were crystal clear and 
Springsteen's deep, dark voice imitating the sound of the dead man's 
cough was haunting. <br>
<br>
Next up was the story of how Bruce got pulled over by the state trooper 
when he didn't have ED. "So I give him my name," Bruce said. "And he 
said 'Are you that rock 'n' roll singer?' And I said 'Yeah, that's me.' 
And he said 'I got all your records. You did that "Born to Run" song.' 
And I said 'Yeah, that's me, I'm the one.' And he said 'We'll son, 
you're in a lot of trouble.'"It was the classic story, used on the 1985 
tour to introduce "Open All Night" But this time, from out of nowhere, 
came "Darlington County." Like "Born in the USA" before it, the melody 
was completely reworked, though the lyrics remained the same. The melody
 was wonderful—Danny's accordian added the hokey sort of sound the song 
needed. <br>
<br>
Then came one of the songs everyone had expected: "Mansion on the Hill."
 Bruce introduced it with the story of how his father always had shown 
him the mansion and how he always thought it was so distant and 
unreachable. It was a beautiful version of the song — different from the
 1984-85 versions only in context The sound was fabulous for the entire 
show but it was most evident on this tune. Whereas the 1984-85 tour's 
acoustic stuff was played through monster speakers set up for rock 'n' 
roll, everything about this situation—including the audience—was 
tailored to acoustic music. <br>
<br>
Even without electricity, Bruce proved he could rock. Somebody yelled 
out "rock 'n' roll" and Bruce said, "I can't get too excited here." He 
broke a string and to fill time he asked Danny to entertain the crowd. 
So Danny started up "Satin Doll" on the accordian. It was one of the 
warmest moments in a Springsteen show in years — harkening back to 1973 
when Bruce and Danny, complete with accordian, would do radio interviews
 and play a few songs acoustically. <br>
<br>
When the guitar was fixed, Bruce joked about "Frankie Yankovic junior," 
and started another big surprise, "Fire." But rather than Elmer Fudd, 
this time it was Bruce Springsteen trying to do his sexiest song sitting
 down while playing guitar ("I gotta stay calm," he kept saying to 
himself). For emphasis he tapped his boots and rose up on his chair, 
trying at once to keep himself under control and at the same time 
communicate the great adolescent lust apparent in this song. At the 
point usually reserved for the face off with the Big Man, Bruce repeated
 "I just can't, I just can't, I just can't STAND MYSELF" and the effect 
was one of the most chilling things he'd done in years — not unlike the 
prolonged "I'd drive" sequence in "Backstreete/Sad Eyes" back in 1978. <br>
<br>
Next up was "Dancing in the Dark," once again done with a different 
melody. Rather than the show-off, flip tone of the video production, 
this time around, with Bruce alone without any girl, it had a much 
sweeter and wanting tone — sort of like a Cyrano de Bergerac poem, sung 
out to a girl on a balcony. <br>
<br>
Then came "Glory Days," which, though done acoustically, mirrored the 
1984-85 version in all other respects. Much better was the next song, 
which Bruce dedicated to Neil and Peggy Young (the entire event was 
organized by Peggy Young) the quintiessential version of "Follow that 
Dream." It had the beauty of everything that was good about Elvis 
Presley all rolled up into three minutes. Bruce's voice—virgin fresh, 
lacking that mid-tour hoarseness—never sounded better in his life. Ella 
Fitzergerald may break glass but Bruce's voice on "Follow That Dream" 
could break hearts. <br>
<br>
Springsteen had already played for well over an hour, more than any two 
of the other performers combined. But it was his crowd and to close he 
pulled out Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young to add background vocals on a 
super-version of "Hungry Heart." <br>
<br>
Finally, everyone came out on stage — Petty, Henley, Williams, the whole
 shebang. They broke into "Teach Your Children" and though it was the 
only musical point of the evening that lacked substance, there was a 
level of excitement in seeing all these superstars united, on one stage.
 Particularly striking was the image of Bruce Springsteen sharing a 
microphone with David Crosby — the very best role model in rock 'n' role
 right next to one of the worst But Springsteen's, and the crowd's, 
affection towards Crosby seemed sincere—it was a sign of the forgiveness
 that only a form as transcendental as rock 'n' roll can dish up. <br>
<br>
And as Bruce Springsteen shows go, it was one of the most exuberant and 
genuine performances in years, and proof enough that despite how knocked
 out of whack everything has gotten these past few years, Bruce 
Springsteen is still a performer who takes risks. And it was clear from 
the Mountain View show that the benefit of those risks go both 
directions — he has rarely looked happier on stage. He gave the distinct
 impression that his music was giving something back to him. Seeing 
Springsteen after the show, as ebullient and blissful as he has ever 
looked, it would come as no surprise to hear that Bruce planned to take 
his solo show on the road, to small halls, to small towns — to places 
where the battles he sings about are still won and lost.<br>

How Bruce Springsteen Unites the World<br>
<br>
The songwriter and singer gave hope to working-class boys in towns thousands of miles from New Jersey.<br>
<br>
By Sarfraz Manzoor</strong><br>
<br>
The United States and Britain are united in having political leaders who
 have insulted and mocked immigrants for electoral purposes. President 
Trump’s anti-immigrant tirades are well known, but Prime Minister Boris 
Johnson of Britain has voiced similar sentiments, including comparing 
Muslim women who wear face veils to “bank robbers” and “letter boxes.”<br>
<br>
A few days earlier, Tell MAMA, a group that monitors anti-Muslim 
activity, revealed that anti-Muslim incidents rose by 375 percent in the
 week after Mr. Johnson’s comments. For those of us who grew up in the 
’80s, the current climate brings back painful memories of a Britain we 
had hoped was long gone.<br>
<br>
In the mid-1980s, I was a bored and dissatisfied British Pakistani 
teenager living in the gritty, unloved town of Luton, 30 miles north of 
London. My father had left Pakistan in the early 1960s. When my mother, 
my siblings and I joined him a decade later, he was working on the 
production line of an auto plant.<br>
<br>
Britain in the 1970s was an uncomfortable time to be in an ethnic 
minority group. The far-right National Front party, whose manifesto 
called for the repatriation of “colored immigrants” and “their 
descendants and dependents” were fighting in elections and marching in 
cities and towns across the country.<br>
<br>
Growing up, my parents were adamant that I was not and should never even
 aspire to be British. To my parents, the irreducible core of my 
identity was being Pakistani and being Muslim. Britain was simply where 
we had ended up. I was instructed never to speak English to my parents, 
only Urdu. My parents forbade me from attending school assemblies 
because Christian hymns were sung. My family’s social circle was 
populated entirely by fellow Pakistanis.<br>
<br>
I wanted to belong, but I was told I was different and it was not only 
parents telling me so. In 1987, when I was 16 years old, Britain had 
elected the Conservative Party for the third successive time. Margaret 
Thatcher had been prime minister for half of my life.<br>
<br>
It was a time when to have brown skin, to have an unusual name and 
Pakistani heritage felt like hurdles that a working-class boy like me 
would never be able to surmount. I wanted to belong and to feel British 
but I was convinced that Britain could never belong to me. This was a 
time when there were no British Muslim role models in media, popular 
culture or politics.<br>
<br>
I should have felt despondent, but I didn’t care because I had a 
one-word escape plan: America. For the teenage me, America was not an 
actual place so much as it was an idea and ideal. I learned about 
America not through travel but from John Hughes and Martin Scorsese, 
from Studs Terkel and John Steinbeck and, most importantly, from Bruce 
Springsteen.<br>
<br>
I was introduced to Springsteen’s music in the fall of 1987 by a Sikh 
friend at sixth form, the college British students attended between high
 school and university. He claimed that Springsteen was the direct line 
to all that was true in this world. Once I started listening, it was 
confirmed as nothing but the truth.<br>
<br>
Springsteen sang about many things, about fathers and factories, 
highways and rivers and, crucially for me, he came from a place almost 
as unloved as Luton: New Jersey. When he sang, “It’s a town full of 
losers and I’m pulling out of here to win,” he was talking about his 
hometown, but he could have been referring to mine.<br>
<br>
His songs were always quintessentially American. I fell in love with 
America as it was depicted in his music: the rattlesnake speedways, the 
dusty arcades and yes, even the New Jersey Turnpike. In Springsteen’s 
music I saw America as a land of hope and dreams. It was a nation that 
had its challenges but it was a generous-hearted place. If Britain would
 not accept me, I would be reborn in the U.S.A.<br>
<br>
The first time I visited the United States was in 1990 when I took a 
Greyhound bus across the country before finally ending up in California,
 where I had a summer job selling encyclopedias door to door. Wherever I
 went people were intrigued by my British accent, but were always 
friendly and only dimly aware of Islam or Pakistan.<br>
<br>
The Sept. 11 attacks significantly changed the Muslim experience of the 
United States. A year later, when I traveled to New Jersey for a 
Springsteen concert at the Giants Stadium, a man asked me how could he 
trust that I was a fan and not someone who was going to blow the stadium
 up. He asked me what my favorite Springsteen song was. I responded by 
listing a few titles that only true fans would have named.<br>
<br>
My faith in America was tested. I kept hoping during the Bush years that
 the America I had fallen in love with as a teenager was not lost 
forever. My faith was rewarded with the election of Barack Obama, who 
embodied an idea that chimed with both me and Springsteen. During both 
his 2008 and 2012 campaigns, Springsteen campaigned for Obama.<br>
The election of Donald Trump into the White House marked the arrival of 
someone whose vision of America was the polar opposite of the vision 
articulated by Springsteen and Obama. Where Springsteen’s America was 
open, welcoming and self-critical, Trump’s America was narrow, fearful 
and arguably race-defined.<br>
<br>
I wrote a memoir about the influence of Springsteen on my experience of 
being a Muslim teenager in the 1980s small-town, working-class Britain, 
and it was recently turned into a movie and released in America.<br>
<br>
I traveled from coast to coast, attending screenings and following the 
reactions people had to the film in person and on social media. People 
laughed when Javed, the character based on my teenage self, rhapsodizes 
about how in America you can be anyone you want to be — the distance 
between the hope and reality so stark.<br>
<br>
The most encouraging thing to me has been the extent to which the film 
has connected with people so outwardly different from the characters in 
the film. In New York, I had a couple from New Jersey approach me after a
 screening to tell me how much they connected with the film. They had 
never met any other British Pakistanis. “You are just a Pakistani 
version of us,” the man said. It seemed such a simple statement but, in a
 time when the president and his supporters seem determined to deepen 
divisions by saying that certain communities who pray or look a certain 
way have less right to claim citizenship, it felt hugely significant and
 cheering.<br>
<br>
In “Long Walk Home,” written after George W. Bush was elected for his second term, Springsteen sang that the <em class="text-italics">“flag flying over the courthouse means certain things are set in stone. Who we are, what we’ll do and what we won’t.”</em><br>
<br>
The America I fell in love from afar all those years ago will have to 
take a long walk home. Yet conversations with Americans who were moved 
by the story of a brown, Muslim boy from a British town left me with 
hope.<br>
<br>
<br>

 “Greetings from Bury Park,” and co-writer of “Blinded by the Light,” a

The Hollywood Reporter<br>
<br>
September 13, 2019</strong><br>
<br>
When is a concert film not just a concert film? Why, when it’s 
co-directed by Bruce Springsteen, of course! Having just debuted this 
evening at the Toronto International Film Festival, I’m no longer under 
embargo and can report that Western Stars is a profound and wonderful 
musical experience that will delight any Springsteen fan, but is a 
lovely 83 minutes of music for anyone who appreciates great songs. 
Loving The Boss is no prerequisite here, but it certainly doesn’t hurt 
any. If the most recent Springsteen album of the same name struck your 
fancy, this is going to be something that absolutely thrills you to your
 core.<br>
<br>
A mix of concert footage and somewhat narrative moments, this flick is 
wholly unique, which is par for the course with The Boss. Of course, 
Western Stars is not just the title of the documentary, but that of 
Springsteen’s most recent studio album. Instead of just filming a 
concert, he opted to perform it for a few select friends on a sprawling 
barn on his New Jersey property. With a 30 piece orchestra, he plays 
each song on the record, giving them a live spin, along with one 
phenomenal cover during the end credits that deserves to be a surprise. 
Between each tune, Springsteen appears in the open California desert, 
either with horses or behind the wheel of a car, musing on his 
existence. The themes of the album are expanded on, as are what he feels
 to be his personal flaws, along with how he’s trying to adapt/cope. 
It’s compelling and moving in equal measure to witness those moments, 
which are deeply personal to him. Then, the performances are just 
glorious, full of life and the joy of music. Springsteen co-directs the 
doc with Thom Zimny here, presumably lending his hand mostly for the 
dramatic western moments between songs.<br>
<br>
I absolutely adored this movie. The album already contains some gems, 
such as Tucson Train, Western Stars, and Chasin’ Wild Horses. So, 
watching them live only elevates their power. The same goes for 
something like There Goes My Miracle, which has Springsteen’s voice come
 alive. This version of the record is a whole new beast, perfect not 
just for fans but for anyone curious about what The Boss sounds like 
these days.<br>
 <br>
Springsteen makes the flick incredibly personal, in particular during 
those in between moments. Sprinkled in with his voice over monologuing 
are home movies, pictures from childhood, and just sense memories that 
help elevate the emotional stakes. Making his directorial debut, you can
 tell the Western genre inspires him. Cowboys influence him greatly, 
essentially standing in as another sort of working class hero, which has
 long been his inspiration. Plus, as he talks about his emotional 
issues, it’s hard not to feel like you’re learning about the man 
himself. In that way, this is a remarkable look into an artist, who has 
recently begun to let folks in.<br>
<br>
Western Stars is a cinematic album on its own, so it easily translates 
to a movie. With a svelte under 90 minute running time, it doesn’t 
overstay its welcome, that’s for sure. The mixture of formats helps to 
give it an identity, allowing the final product to feel like much more 
than something that otherwise could be just a bonus feature on the box 
set for the musical release. It stakes its claim as a cinematic event, 
with a full on narrative within it.<br>
Opening next month after tonight’s TIFF premiere, Western Stars is a 
must see for any Springsteen fan. An immensely satisfying concert film 
that also makes for a profound companion piece to Bruce Springsteen’s 
memoir, as well as Springsteen on Broadway, it really scratches an itch 
for fans of the legendary musician. Between all of that and Blinded by 
the Light earlier this summer, the last year and change has been a good 
one for fans of The Boss. This is not to be missed! Once it hits 
theaters next month, you’re going to be in for a real treat…</div>

				<div class="content"><em class="text-italics">Toronto Film Festival 
2019: Borrowing from the imagery of his recent album of the same name, 
the film directed by Springsteen and Thom Zimny is both an intimate 
concert film and a series of musings on solitude and community</em><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Steve Pond | September 12, 2019 <br>
THE WRAP<br>
</strong><br>
The film begins with an aerial shot of a wide-open desert plain, with 
wild horses running free. There’s an old barn, a car, a weathered hand 
sporting turquoise jewellery grasping a steering wheel, a silhouette of a
 man in a cowboy hat.<br>
<br>
That’s not the way you would normally think of Bruce Springsteen 
introducing himself — but “Western Stars,” which had its world premiere 
on Thursday at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, is not a 
normal Bruce Springsteen film. Borrowing from the imagery of his recent 
album of the same name, it’s both an intimate concert film and a series 
of musings on solitude and community in song and story.<br>
<br>
And if it places New Jersey’s rock ‘n’ roll poet laureate in a different
 setting from most of his work, it is wholly true to the spirit of a 
remarkable artist who has spent the last few decades grappling with 
personal demons and being open about his search for peace and refuge.<br>
<br>
The film, which will be released by Warner Bros. in October, is 
essential viewing for Springsteen fans, of course (and I am in that 
camp, of course), but it has the grace and humanity to connect outside 
his devoted fan base as well.<br>
<br>
“Western Stars” goes far deeper than the usual performance document, to 
sensitively explore what he sees as the state of his, and our, lives. 
It’s a ruminative, almost elegiac look at Springsteen’s life and career,
 filled with moments of uncommon beauty that makes it of a piece with 
this latest, most introspective phase of his career.<br>
<br>
“Everybody’s broken in some way,” he says at one point. “In this life, 
nobody gets away unhurt… We’re always trying to find somebody whose 
broken pieces fit with our broken pieces, and something whole emerges.”<br>
<br>
Over the past decade, Springsteen has released a string of full-length 
films to accompany his albums, but most have been either concert 
performances or making-of documentaries — and until now, most of them 
have been credited solely to Springsteen’s longtime collaborator, 
director Thom Zimny. But “Western Stars” is even more of a 
collaboration, sporting Springsteen’s name alongside Zimny as 
co-director.<br>
<br>
(The two men also share the directing credit on 2014’s 10-minute short 
“Hunter of Invisible Game,” which fashioned a Cormac McCarthy-style 
post-apocalyptic scenario around a Springsteen song.)<br>
<br>
Together, Springsteen and Zimny take a deep dive into the “Western 
Stars” album, which on the surface might have seemed an odd choice for 
that kind of treatment. When Springsteen put out the album in June, it 
was immediately clear that he’d turned the rather remarkable trick of 
making a completely singular record almost 50 years deep in his 
recording career.<br>
<br>
Like very few of his other albums — the improvisational sprawl of 1973’s
 “The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle” and the raucous folk 
of 2006’s “We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions” come to mind, but not
 much else — “Western Stars” seems to stand alone in style and feel.<br>
It also seemed at the time to be a departure for the man who’d spent the
 last couple of years fashioning and performing his Broadway show, 
“Springsteen on Broadway.” That project was the most personal thing 
Springsteen had ever done, a startlingly intense and intimate evening of
 songs and stories that drew direct connections between his life and his
 work.<br>
<br>
“Western Stars,” on the other hand, felt like one of the least personal 
things Springsteen had done. The songs, with their country influences 
and with arrangements drawn from Los Angeles pop of the late ’60s and 
early ’70s, told the stories of characters adrift in the West: A 
hitchhiker, a long-haul truck driver, a fading star of Western movies, a
 stuntman, a failed country songwriter.<br>
<br>
Springsteen has long explored his own issues through working-class 
characters, but the lives he depicts in the “Western Stars” songs felt 
like people from another world; the album was lovely, but on the surface
 it didn’t seem to say much about the man who made it, other than that 
he loved the records Glen Campbell made with Jimmy Webb and wanted to 
try his hand at that kind of thing.<br>
<br>
But “Western Stars,” the film, shatters that take on “Western Stars,” 
the album. It is built around a performance of the complete album that 
took place in the hayloft of a 140-year-old barn on Springsteen’s 
property in New Jersey. Together with a 30-piece orchestra that includes
 strings, horns and five singers arranged by Springsteen’s wife, Patti 
Scialfa, the performances capture the lushness of the album but also 
bear down harder, making the songs a little rougher and a little 
sharper.<br>
<br>
“It’s a place filled with the best kind of ghosts and spirits,” 
Springsteen says of the barn, and his performance lets those spirits 
come out to play.<br>
In between the album’s 13 songs, Springsteen talks. In a way, this pulls
 “Western Stars” into the “Springsteen on Broadway” universe, making it a
 combination of intimate live performances linked by monologues that 
make personal connections between the work and the man who made it.<br>
But Springsteen isn’t talking to the camera or to an audience, and for 
the most part he’s not telling anecdotes about his life – instead, he’s 
talking about the emotional roots of the songs and the characters on the
 “Western Stars” album, which he calls “a 13-song meditation on the 
struggle between individual freedom and communal life.”<br>
<br>
Heard in voiceover while the camera gives quick glimpses of Bruce in the
 bar, Bruce on the ranch, Bruce in the car, Springsteen can sometimes 
sound a little stilted. But there’s no mistaking the depth of feeling he
 brings to this work, in which an array of characters stand in for his 
own struggles to stop running away, to stop hurting the people in his 
life, to embrace his better angels.<br>
<br>
The songs and the stories nudge “Western Stars” to life as a moving 
chronicle of a man who will turn 70 later this month. “The older you 
get, the heavier that baggage becomes that you haven’t sorted through,” 
he says, making it clear that the album and the movie is part of that 
sorting-through.<br>
<br>
Musically expansive and emotionally telling, “Western Stars” works 
through the album’s pain and hurt until it finds refuge in “Hello 
Sunshine,” the song that insists on fashioning a happy ending. “A love 
song … is the redemption of your heart,” he says. “We drive out of the 
darkness into sunshine and love.”<br>
It makes for a lovely benediction, and he follows it with some goofy 
home movies of himself and Scialfa, and then with a performance of the 
album closer, “Moonlight Motel.” By this point, the small audience has 
left and the barn is empty, and Springsteen takes a song that sounds 
lonely on in the song the album and claims it for love and beauty.<br>
<br>
But it wouldn’t be a Bruce Springsteen performance without an encore, so
 Bruce and the band send us home with a cover version of a hit from Glen
 Campbell, whose songs from the 1960s and ’70s helped inspire “Western 
Stars.”<br>
<br>
I won’t reveal which Glen Campbell song it is, except to say it’s one of
 the last ones I would want to hear. But it’s great anyway, and one more
 surprise in a film that finds new dimensions to the work of an 
essential artist.</div>

<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Bruce Springsteen premieres the 
live-performance movie of his 2019 album about freedom and adulthood, 
and the result is a knockout</em><br>
<br>
Listen to the opening track of Bruce Springsteen’s Western Stars, the 
album he put out this past May, and you’ll hear someone bragging about 
“hitch-hikin’ all day long.” He accepts a ride from a man and his 
pregnant wife; then he grabs a lift from someone else, just a guy free 
to heed the call of the open road. Two cuts later, on a song called 
“Tucson Train,” we get a different tale — maybe he’s a new protagonist; 
maybe he’s the same romantic drifter of “Hitch Hikin'” and a hundred 
other Springsteen tracks — who had lost his way and lost and his true 
love. But now he’s settled down, he’s ready to be part of society, he’s 
watching that 5:15 train bringing his baby to him to show up. (It takes a
 lot to laugh, etc.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Should you still be unsure at what he’s getting at, Springsteen spells 
it out as plain as can be in the beginning of Western Stars, the concert
 film-cum-visual album he and longtime collaborator/codirector Thom 
Zimny premiered at the Toronto Film Festival on Thursday night. (It hits
 theaters October 25th.) His collection of songs about road warriors and
 B-movie actors, beat-up stuntmen and places where truckers and bikers 
drink together, is a look at “the two sides of the American 
character…individual freedom and communal life.” He says this over 
panoramic shots that turn the record’s cover of a running mustang into a
 literal motion picture, interspersed with clips of home movies. A 
close-up details a hand on a pickup’s steering wheel, ready to 
skeedaddle. The shot is repeated 90 or so mins later, with another hand 
now resting tenderly on top of the original one. This is the journey 
Springsteen wants you take here. It’s the same one, he notes, that he’s 
been taking over the last 35 years.<br>
<br>
After releasing this solo project, the songwriter knew he wasn’t going 
to support the record with a tour. Still, he wanted to do something to, 
in his words, “get this music live to an audience.” Springsteen came up 
with the idea of playing the whole thing start to finish, then capture 
the event on film for posterity. He and Zimny, the filmmaker behind 
dozens of Bruce-related music videos and making-of-album docs, started 
to scout locations; they eventually settled on the top floor of the barn
 on Springsteen’s property. (“We dressed the space up quite a bit,” he 
admitted in a Q&amp;A after an afternoon press screening.) The notion 
was to put on an intimate show “for a few friends, and to entertain the 
horses.” Just a small crowd, a honkytonk-style bar, a scrappy band 
buffered by an orchestral section, and a singer with a guitar.<br>
<br>
And as a performance film, Western Stars is a pitch-perfect example of 
why this music needed to be played and heard live. On record, you can 
feel Springsteen working his way through some uncharacteristic styles: 
Jimmy Webb-style C&amp;W lite, Brian Wilson’s baroque pop, Everly 
Brothers-like crooning, musical arrangements that wouldn’t be out of 
place on an old Harry Nilsson joint (listen to that gossamer shuffle 
that opens up “Hello Sunshine” and tell me you don’t expect the first 
line to be “Everybody’s talkin’ at me…”). Seeing him take on those songs
 on a stage, however, and you get the sense he owns all of it now — he’s
 turned all of these influences into a seamless Springsteen sound. A 
number of the cuts open up like an oxygenated bottle of wine, whether 
it’s because there’s a gaggle of string players or a single partner in 
crime — the interplay between him and wife/guitarist Patti Scialfa on 
“Stones” deepens the cut substantially — bringing something else out of 
him.<br>
<br>
But what you see in the live versions is the sum of these parts as one 
cohesive whole. He’s a singer in sync with the musical community 
surrounding him, a concept as thematically on point with the album as 
possible. (Thankfully, the soundtrack to the film will also be released,
 which means you’ll get Springsteen &amp; Co.’s gorgeous cover of Glenn 
Campbell’s “Rhinestone Cowboy” — an impromptu coda that, Zimny says, he 
didn’t know Bruce was going to do. The fact that a cameraman was nearby 
and quickly caught it was a stroke of luck.) Those moments share screen 
time with free-form scenes of Bruce wandering alone through the 
California desert near Joshua Tree, offering comments on both the songs 
and his own struggle to reconcile his stoic loner and loving 
husband/father sides. There are stoic poses galore, as well old clips of
 scruffy young Springsteen and rare Super 8 films of his honeymoon with 
Scialfa that Zimny found buried in the archives.<br>
<br>
And as a performance film, Western Stars is a pitch-perfect example of 
why this music needed to be played and heard live. On record, you can 
feel Springsteen working his way through some uncharacteristic styles: 
Jimmy Webb-style C&amp;W lite, Brian Wilson’s baroque pop, Everly 
Brothers-like crooning, musical arrangements that wouldn’t be out of 
place on an old Harry Nilsson joint (listen to that gossamer shuffle 
that opens up “Hello Sunshine” and tell me you don’t expect the first 
line to be “Everybody’s talkin’ at me…”). Seeing him take on those songs
 on a stage, however, and you get the sense he owns all of it now — he’s
 turned all of these influences into a seamless Springsteen sound. A 
number of the cuts open up like an oxygenated bottle of wine, whether 
it’s because there’s a gaggle of string players or a single partner in 
crime — the interplay between him and wife/guitarist Patti Scialfa on 
“Stones” deepens the cut substantially — bringing something else out of 
him.<br>
<br>
But what you see in the live versions is the sum of these parts as one 
cohesive whole. He’s a singer in sync with the musical community 
surrounding him, a concept as thematically on point with the album as 
possible. (Thankfully, the soundtrack to the film will also be released,
 which means you’ll get Springsteen &amp; Co.’s gorgeous cover of Glenn 
Campbell’s “Rhinestone Cowboy” — an impromptu coda that, Zimny says, he 
didn’t know Bruce was going to do. The fact that a cameraman was nearby 
and quickly caught it was a stroke of luck.) Those moments share screen 
time with free-form scenes of Bruce wandering alone through the 
California desert near Joshua Tree, offering comments on both the songs 
and his own struggle to reconcile his stoic loner and loving 
husband/father sides. There are stoic poses galore, as well old clips of
 scruffy young Springsteen and rare Super 8 films of his honeymoon with 
Scialfa that Zimny found buried in the archives.<br>

Sometimes he cracks wise (“Nineteen albums, and I’m still writing about 
cars”). Sometimes he goes into saloon-philosopher mode, offering the 
sort of deep thoughts (“Walk on through the dark, because that’s where 
the next morning is”) that longtime fans will tell you are part of the 
ride when you pay for the ticket. All of it seems part of the 
self-reflective phase Springsteen has been going through over the past 
few years; he admitted in the Q&amp;A that the movie is the last part of
 “a story I haven’t really told before” that includes his 2016 memoir 
Born to Run and his 2018 Broadway residency. Introspection suits him, 
especially if this is the kind of art we’re getting from him now. He’d 
hoped the film would help people understand a little better what the 
songs were getting at. Mission accomplished.<br>
<br>
But Western Stars isn’t a therapy session. It’s a portrait of lightning 
momentarily bottled, the way all great concert movies are. It’s the 
pleasure of watching a guy who’s been doing this for 50-plus years find 
yet another way to make it fresh without abandoning what made it great 
in the first place. And it’s also a personal look at someone working it 
out through his music, looking to find a sense of peace in the spotlight
 and realizing, with a sigh of relief, that he’s actually found it.<br>
