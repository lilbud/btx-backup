				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: Springsteen Turns On The Heat…<br>
<br>
Chris Charlesworth, Melody Maker, February 9 1974<br>
<br>
HE STANDS there looking like a cross between Elvis Presley and a reject 
from Sha Na Na with faint Dylanesque overtones and a battered Fender 
Telecaster hung low enough for him to qualify for a place in the 
Ventures.<br>
<br>
His hair is short and curly and there's a wispy beard that never seems 
to grow any longer. A pair of square shades rest on his nose which stay 
in place all the time during the show and which make him look even more 
like Dylan of 1965 than Dylan of 1974 looks today.<br>
<br>
He wears jeans and a red vest and maybe a denim jacket, all of which 
helps to make him look a trifle like James Dean, only smaller and more 
vulnerable.<br>
<br>
And he clicks his finger now and then like Presley's supposed to do and 
like Tom Jones does. He shakes his Fender back and forth and twists his 
hips around, looking as if he means business. He conducts the band with 
his fretboard sometimes grinning and sometimes looking perplexed 'cos he
 ain't quite sure what's happening next.<br>
<br>
And then he'll surprise you by discarding the guitar and playing a 
tender love song at the piano. He dismisses the group, who will return 
later with a change of instruments and take up a stance at the front 
with the regular bassist playing a tuba and the keyboard man strapped 
behind an accordion. The tuba makes such a strange deep noise that you 
don't know whether to laugh or cry.<br>
<br>
After all that seriousness he'll start rocking again, using the big 
black cat on the saxophone as a bass vocalist and singing an old rock 
and roll number.<br>
<br>
If you're lucky he'll finish his set with a rendering of 'Twist And 
Shout' complete with the ascending build up between verses that sounds 
just like John Lennon was standing beside him crouched over a 
Rickenbacker and yelling his loudest to drown out the screams.<br>
<br>
Sometimes he runs on the spot then dashes about the stage, guitar in 
hand, like a cat waiting to pounce. Other times he'll just stand there 
and sing with emotion instead of a funk.<br>
<br>
He's as hot as hell in America right now, but he's having problems 
because the big bands don't want him as the supporting act in case of 
any embarrassment over who's the star of the show; and the word hasn't 
spread around enough yet for him to sell out on his own name except in 
certain areas.<br>
<br>
He also needs a good producer who can do justice to the songs he writes and the music that his band is capable of playing.<br>
<br>
He's put out two albums for CBS. The first was brilliant and the second 
was just good. Neither has sold particularly well although both have had
 rave reviews in the US music papers.<br>
<br>
I'm talking about Bruce Springsteen and, as he's never been to Europe, 
you could be excused for not knowing who he is. In Europe certain 
reviewers suggested that he was the next Bob Dylan on the release of his
 first album, and he's never quite got over this rather unfortunate 
catagorisation.<br>
<br>
There is a physical resemblance and they both write songs, but then 
Dylan's facial appearance could blend into any crowd and lots of young 
men write songs these days.<br>
<br>
The only other similarity is that they're both pretty good at their craft.<br>
<br>
Springsteen comes from New Jersey, the State immediately south of New 
York, where he has been a musician of sorts for several years.<br>
<br>
He's 24 now and finally doing what he wants to do most – lead his own 
band. Although he recorded an album three years ago for Bill Graham's 
Fillmore label (it was never released, but bootleg versions are 
circulating around California), his recent Columbia output is the sum 
total of his recording career.<br>
<br>
He played in a couple of bands before the current outfit – Steel Mill 
which lasted two years and which travelled around America getting gigs 
whenever they could, and Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom, a sort of 
happy-go-lucky bunch of dudes who played around New Jersey, changing the
 line-up for almost every gig and adding musicians at a frantic rate.<br>
<br>
At one stage there were as many as 14 musicians in the Sonic Boom, but the regular number was nine.<br>
<br>
Out of this came Bruce, who arrived at CBS's offices with a guitar and 
an appointment to see John Hammond, the A&amp;R man who actually signed 
Dylan way back in 1961. Springsteen played a few of his songs in 
Hammond's office and he was duly signed as a solo artist under the 
assumption that he would immediately become CBS's new "Bob Dylan."<br>
<br>
But Bruce had never been a solo artist so he used his advance from CBS 
to put a band together. Previously he'd never been able to afford to run
 a band, but now he was in a position to get together the best musicians
 he knew from New Jersey.<br>
<br>
This he did, and today they're one of the tightest little backing 
outfits on the road in the USA, rivalling Van Morrison's various backup 
bands for sheer funk and outright competance.<br>
<br>
Star sideman is Clarence Clemons, a huge black cat who plays the 
saxophone and sings in a rich deep voice. He also wears a bright white 
suit, printed shirt and white fedora hat on stage – making a strange 
contrast with small, curly haired Bruce in his faded denims.<br>
<br>
Clarence's reed work is a gas: not complex but tight and unhurried, 
flowing when required and rasping at the right moments. He looks great, 
too, thanks to nature rather than a make-up kit.<br>
<br>
There's Garry Tallent on bass, a skinny long haired guy, who also sings 
and plays the tuba; Vini Lopez on drums; and a couple of keyboard men: 
Danny Federici, who contributes a swirling organ and occasional 
accordion, and David Sancious, who gets a chance to shine with his 
almost classical piano introduction to Springsteen's very beautiful 
song, 'New York City Serenade'.<br>
<br>
The band has been with him since he started out with Columbia although 
David Sancious quit after the first album to go down south to form his 
own band. He didn't manage it and arrived back with Springsteen in time 
to appear on the second album. He was welcomed back with open arms.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's first album Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J. was greeted 
with wild enthusiasm and showcased Bruce as a singer/songwriter with 
little attention paid to his backing band. The second The Wild, The 
Innocent and the E. Street Shuffle, was more of a band album with chunks
 of solos and ample opportunity for all to shine.<br>
<br>
Springsteen himself insists that it's a band rather than a showcase for 
himself. He just regards himself as the lead singer/guitar/writer in the
 group.<br>
<br>
And on stage this facet is more pronounced. Although he's the leader, 
it's more of a situation like Jagger and the Stones: each gets a crack 
of the whip and the one for-all-all-for-one idea is enhanced when Bruce 
introduces his band at regular intervals.<br>
<br>
I saw them twice last weekend, both in Virginia, which is the East Coast and fairly hot territory for Springsteen.<br>
<br>
The first night's show at Richmond was a sell out, although the crowd 
seemed less responsive to Brace's quieter material and anxious to get 
out of their seats and dance at the slightest provocation.<br>
<br>
Perhaps it was because Bruce sensed this that he included a version of 
'Let The Four Winds Blow', the old rocker, which featured Clarence's 
remarkable bass skat singing.<br>
<br>
At Norfolk, a naval base 100 miles away, the show wasn't a sell out but 
the audience response was more respectful. It was the better of the two 
shows and they included a wild version of 'Walking The Dog', which began
 as a red hot instrumental taken at furious pace.<br>
<br>
But the bulk of the sets are taken up with Springsteen's own material 
taken from the two albums which vary greatly in texture from the soft, 
contemplative 'New York City Serenade', the almost comical 'Wild Billy's
 Circus Story' to the shuffling rock numbers from the first album which,
 behind the driving rhythm, also contain sets of brilliant lyrics.<br>
<br>
Bruce doesn't talk much. He's a quiet guy who neither smokes nor drinks.
 He spends most of his time on the road, but has yet to play outside the
 USA and Canada. He's hoping for a chance to get to England this year.<br>
<br>
If he makes it, go see him.<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: At the Roxy, Los Angeles 1975<br>
<br>
Bud Scoppa, Phonograph Record, November 1975<br>
<br>
PEOPLE WHO who were clearly not accustomed to standing in line formed a 
reluctant column along Sunset Boulevard; hordes of photographers snapped
 at the famous faces as they chafed in their queue. It wasn't yet eight 
p.m. Bruce Springsteen was scheduled to play his first Roxy set at nine.
 He'd be facing a houseful of music-industry and celebrity skeptics who 
were already ornery at having to wait instead of being waited on. The 
big question of the day had been: Will it play in L.A.? Now the question
 seemed more specific: Will this all but surly audience allow it to 
play?<br>
<br>
In the traffic on Sunset a Mercedes backed into the VW behind it, then 
sped to freedom down the left-turn lane. The crowd cheered. Uh-oh. Be 
wary, Bruce, this ain't Philadelphia.<br>
<br>
We had little difficulty, surprisingly enough, sliding into one of the 
front-center tables, and from that cozy vantage point, we checked out 
some of the pre-show entertainment: an unselfconsciously balding Jack 
Nicholson bobbing his head to Little Feat's 'Dixie Chicken'; Peter Boyle
 and Robert de Niro huddling at the next table; Jackson Browne, Jim 
Messina, and Wolfman Jack scuffling for empty seats; the young woman 
across from me complaining to her date, "It's hurting my neck to look at
 famous people...oh, do you want your cherry?" In the dim light, old 
lovers and old rivals spotted each other from across the room. The long 
tables were lined with tall tequila sunrises.<br>
<br>
At about 9:45, finally, the lights went down and the curtain lifted to 
reveal the silhouette of a harp-playing Springsteen alone on stage. As 
he began to sing 'Thunder Road' — joined now by Roy Bittan's piano — a 
spot lit him, revealing a small but lionheaded figure in levis 
rolled-at-the-cuff, motorcycle jacket, and button-down shirt. Perhaps 
realizing he was outnumbered, Springsteen kept his eyes closed through 
the song. Even so, he was magnetic: one of my tablemates who'd earlier 
said he didn't look like much in his photos suddenly stage-whispered, 
"Gee, he looks like Al Pacino in Serpico." By God, she was right. And he
 sang in a rich, assured baritone, the very voice that has caused 
reviewers to invoke the name of Elvis. Even without his band, 
Springsteen was holding them off. It was gonna be a good battle.<br>
<br>
As the crowd responded — more than politely — to the first number, the E
 Street bandsmen filed onstage, attired in three broad-brimmed hats, as 
many left-lobe earrings, a single tank-top (on the drummer, natch), and a
 half-dozen set jaws — theatre or not, these guys appeared to be tough 
customers. They pushed across 'Tenth Avenue Freeze-out' while 
Springsteen turned his back on the crowd and made himself into a 
windmill before the drums. By 'She's the One', the fifth number, 
Springsteen and the band were in high gear, and the crowd was coming 
around. The boss was a hero-imp, larger than life but still — especially
 during 'Spirit in the Night' when he threw himself face-down on a front
 table and gobbled a french fry — totally accessible. During a roaring 
'Born to Run', someone shouted in my ear, "He's like an actor playing 
himself." Right again. If the crowd wasn't responding with the intensity
 this performance warranted, it was still largely won over by this 
powerful presence and his similarly powerful band.<br>
<br>
Springsteen pulled off his jacket a half hour into the show. His shirt 
was cursorily tucked in in front, left loose in back. A six-inch thread 
hung from the rolled-up sleeve of his microphone hand — it was as if the
 thread were part of the plan. Through 'Kitty's Back' and 'Rosalita' the
 E Streeters gathered momentum to a glorious peak while Springsteen — 
shout-singing, playing vibrato-filled guitar chords and solos, enticing 
the crowd with his smiles and grimaces — whirled among them. Will it 
play in L.A.? What a stupid question.<br>
<br>
The crowd-that-Columbia-bought decided it wanted an encore, and the band gave them a hushed 'Sandy' with a modified final verse:<br>
<br>
Sandy, the angels have lost their desire for us<br>
Can't figure out...spoke to 'em just last night--said they won't set themselves on fire for us anymore<br>
But every summer, when the weather gets hot, they ride their crazy road down from heaven<br>
On their Harleys they come and go<br>
You see 'em dressed like stars in the little seashore bars and parked with their babies out on the Kokomo...<br>
<br>
and followed that with a passionate 'Dee-troit medley' courtesy of Mitch
 Ryder: 'Devil with a Blue Dress On' into 'Good Golly Miss Molly' into 
'C.C. Rider' into 'Ginny Ginny Ginny' (or is it 'Jenny Jenny Jenny'?). 
Then back to the Sunset Marquis to rest up for the real audiences the 
next three nights. If this wasn't the Student Prince in Asbury or the 
Osprey in Manasquan or Dudley's in Orange, it was still an impressive 
and invigorating performance that turned stiffs and sourpusses into 
fans. Still, a few stiffs and sourpusses remained.<br>
<br>
The next evening's show before a charged, zealous audience (made up 
mostly of people who'd awakened before dawn a couple of weeks earlier in
 order to get a good spot in the ticket line) made opening night seem 
tame. Thanks to a live radio broadcast, it was captured for posterity by
 L.A. - area tape recordists and bootleggers (myself among the former 
group). Great sound and a sensible mix should make this one of the most 
high-quality bootlegs ever put on sale. Highlights: a solemn, moving 
performance of 'Goin' Back' in tribute to Roger McGuinn and to 
Springsteen's favorite L.A. band, the Byrds; and a majestic, magnificent
 rendering of 'Backstreets' in a league with the version of 'Like a 
Rolling Stone' from the Dylan-Band '66 Albert Hall bootleg. Am I glad to
 have a copy.<br>
<br>
From a balcony vantage point, the Saturday night crowd took on a 
distinct character: the front section consisted almost entirely of 
young, exhilarated males whose hero worship of Springsteen approached — 
and sometimes went over the line right into — adoration. In the reserved
 tables farther back, the people were more mixed, gender-wise, and 
slightly cooler — "Maybe that's why they call them 'reserved'," somone 
opined.<br>
<br>
Springsteen was Saturday-night spiffy in jeans, earth shoes, black 
pullover sweater, and navy blue suspenders (I gotta get a pair). The 
rest of the band still looked street-tough grungy, but they played 
throughout the evening with outright splendor. What a band — even 
without the boss they'd be one of the best in the business; with him 
they're practically unrivalled (Will it play in L.A?!). A magically 
balanced coupling of the rough-neck and the refined, of the cocky and 
the charming, of gutterraunch and purple majesty, they're right there 
with Springsteen at every turn, in every sense. In an instant, they can 
recreate summer of '68 on the Jersey Shore, or 1935 on 125th Street, or 
they can drop the bottom out and suddenly you're alone in a bedroom with
 a lover or in an alley with a shadow. On a good night, as this one 
certainly was, Springsteen and the band invest everything they play — 
the classic rockers ('Backstreets', 'Born to Run', 'She's the One'), the
 rangy, hook-laden performance pieces ('Kitty's Back', 'Rosalita'), the 
panoramas ('Jungleland', 'Sandy'), and the old songs ('When You Walk in 
the Room', 'Carol', 'Pretty Flamingo') — with the resonance and 
illumination of greatness. No kidding, when they all came in on the 
opening of 'Backstreets', I thought we'd hit nine on the Richter scale 
and it was really all over. But (unless you're compulsive, or a 
chronicler, or both) you don't think of words like "resonance" or 
"majesty" while it's happening in front of you — you think, "Man, this 
is fun, and I'm really happy, and I don't ever want it to end." Or, 
like: a promo man and Springsteen fanatic has said to me on several 
occasions, "It's my life." I know what you mean. It plays in LA.<br>

<br>
Charles Shaar Murray, NME, 11 October 1975<br>
<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: Man, Myth or Monster? CHARLES SHAAR MURRAY reports from Houston, Texas<br>
<br>
THE FURTHER west you get the worse off you are without a car.<br>
<br>
In Houston, Texas, if you ain't got wheels you are one hundred per cent 
screwed; you mooch down the street past the massage parlours and 
churches kicking at abandoned beer cans and looking for a place to eat 
after midnight (room service cuts off at 12, y'see).<br>
<br>
You mooch along until you find a drive-in diner with a vaguely surreal 
patio full of hacked and crumbling white plaster tables and chairs, 
where they give you a free milkshake (chocolate, stawberry or vanilla) 
if you order the steak sandwich.<br>
<br>
So you go ahead and order it and you find out why the 'shakes are free 
(they're god awful is why) and you sit there and smoke a cigarette in 
the wild spooky Texas night and start thinking about Bruce Springsteen.<br>
<br>
NINETY minutes earlier, you'd been in the Music Hall, a 4,000-seater 
Houston hall where the aforementioned Spruce Stringbean had played the 
second of two packo-sellout gigs.<br>
<br>
You know what happens at certain gigs when you're sitting there and you 
hear someone blissfully clapping time imperceptively close to you and 
you look down and find that it's you? The Springsteen gig was one of 
those. One of those dream gigs when a performer schleps his reality and 
his environment onto the stage with him and manages to interlock his 
universe with his listeners'.<br>
<br>
After seeing Springsteen you realise that his records are dumb and 
irrelevant; forget 'em, they're trash, they're a shadow show in a 
distorting mirror, and he's not really there at all. It's possible to 
hear his records and hardly dig him at all; it ain't possible to see his
 show and walk out quite the same.<br>
<br>
I mean, the cat is good.<br>
<br>
Let's you and me check out some charts. In the latest Cash Box Top 100 
albums, Bruce's new album Born To Run is in at number ten (with a 
bullet, of course). Last week it was at 31, and the week before that it 
wasn't even in the goddam shops. His two previous albums, The Wild, The 
Innocent And the E. Street Shuffle and Greetings From Asbury Park N.J. 
are at 85, and 100 respectively. Also with bullets.<br>
<br>
Let's try Billboard. There we find Born To Run at eight (with a bullet) 
up from 84 on its second week on the charts. The other two albums are 
bulleted at 98 and 99. In Record World, the new album is at three up 
from ten, while the oldies are in at 113 and 123.<br>
<br>
The weird thing is that neither of those first two albums even made the 
top 200 when they first came out. In its first six months, Greetings 
sold all of 50,000 copies, which for America is a rotten sale.<br>
<br>
It was even money that CBS were going to drop Springsteen when Clive 
Davis fell, because he was a rookie act with a flop album who'd been one
 of Clive's pet prodigies. Still, a few folks in the company thought the
 boy was really something and hung in there, and now the CBS people are 
portentiously intoning stuff about how Brucie's too big to do any but 
the most carefully selected interviews and no, you can't take any 
off-stage photos. Sorry.<br>
<br>
Pure '72 Tony DeFries.<br>
<br>
Anyway, for those of you who simply remember Springbruce as one of the 
'73 class of new Dylans, it's Fax Time on WNME. Springsteen is a 
25-year-old bona-fide street-punk from Freehold, New Jersey. Freehold is
 just down the road from Ashbury Park, a real under-the-broadwalk street
 paradise full of clubs, pinball arcades, beaches and hotnight 
streetcorner Americana of all description. Ashbury Park is Springsteen's
 sourcepoint; an environment that he recreates in the riotous r 'n' b 
punk ballet of his stage show.<br>
<br>
Really, it's that thing that makes the difference between his records 
(which don't make it) and his stage show (which does); on record he 
comes on like some kind of sensitive singer-songwriter with a mental 
block about ever leaving anything at all out of a song. Good idea, bad 
idea, no damn idea at all, sling it in, man, it'll fit. Except that the 
good lines were so good that it left a bad taste in the ear when they 
were juxtaposed with the bad ones.<br>
<br>
The songs on the new album are a lot more tasteful, but the ponderous mock-Spector arrangements are from hunger.<br>
<br>
The trouble was that the quality of Springsteen's best work made it 
mandatory to judge the rest of his work by that standard. Yer average 
turkey rock act can be patted on the back if it manages to haul one good
 song out of the garbage heap of its regular output, but when 
Springsteen was goood he was so good that he made you hate him for not 
being that good all the time. Just as it was impossible to take the more
 outrageous claims of his supporters seriously when sitting at home 
checking out his records, it was likewise impossible to write him off.<br>
<br>
I mean, new Dylan, new Schmylan; I get uptight when I hear anyone touted
 as the new anything. It's one thing to say that someone occupies an 
equivalent position to some famous biggie in terms of the context of 
today's music scene, or whatever, but whenever I hear that "new 
Beatles/new Dylan-/new Stones" jive I hang up and walk out.<br>
<br>
SO I WAS pissed off with Springsteen right up front because of the 
outrageous disservice that his more vocal admirers were doing him, 
saddling the poor kid with a label that he just couldn't live up to, no 
way. Plus it didn't even sound as if he was trying to live up to it in 
the first place.<br>
<br>
The strongest vibe that I got off Springsteen's records was that he was 
the best new white R&amp;B voice/musical identity that I'd heard in a 
long time. And I was blown over when I saw him live and discovered that 
the aspect of his work that had impressed me the most was in fact, the 
deepest and most central core of his work.<br>
<br>
Let's get to it: Springsteen has the finest understanding of black music
 – not just the sound of it, but the philosphy and ethics of the modern 
R&amp;B show – of any white act since the J. Geils Band.<br>
<br>
He also has stage presence like only a handful of '70s acts have it – 
Bowie, Patti Smith, Bob Marley Brilleaux/Johnson, Labelle, Alex Harvey, 
(curiously, the SAHB display an instinctive grasp of the philosophy of 
R&amp;B choreography even though they don't play no R&amp;B). Plus he's 
got a great voice and a kick-ass band.<br>
<br>
ANYWAY, HE comes on stage slouching and bowlegged and akimbo in jeans 
and leathers, wispy beard and pirate earring, and the first thing is 
that I'm surprised by how small he is. He does 'Incident On 57th Street'
 all alone at the centre mike with just his piano player Roy "The 
Professor" Bittan, and he's doing anexcellent impersonation of a cat 
who's all limbs that he doesn't know what to do with.<br>
<br>
His feet shuffle, his face scews up like an old glove, he doesn't know 
what to do with his hands, he twitches. Then the band come on and their 
presence seems to give him confidence and he sneakslides into his 
stylised strut: where street body movement extends into the dancing 
zone.<br>
<br>
The song is 'Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out', off the new album (the album 
version reflects the Springsteen stage vibe far better than most of his 
recordings, incidentally). By now he's got one of those po' boy slouch 
caps hanging off the side of his head, and he's well in to his 
definitive onstage characterisaion: sassy street dude deluxe in his 
tennis shoes laying down his jive and talking trash on the corner, all 
good peer group stuff, working off of the two main guys in his group 
(known, quite logically in terms of Springsteen's Asbury mythology, as 
the E. Street Band).<br>
<br>
The ones I'm talking about are Miami Steve (guitar), a sharp-lookin' 
mofo in an ice-cream gangster suit, who used to play with Springsteen in
 his New Jersey bar band days and Clarence Clemons (saxophone). Now 
Clemons is not only the cat whose musical contributions invariably kick 
the numbers into overdrive, but he's Springsteen's most effective visual
 foil onstage.<br>
<br>
He's a huge black Man-Mountain, magisterially duded up in a white suit, 
hat and shoes, and I think they use ultra-violet lights on him to let 
him gleam spookily through even when the stage is at its most dimly lit.<br>
<br>
He looks like the living incarnation of R&amp;B, does Clemons. If you 
want a perfect indication of what R&amp;B means to its most devoted 
white enthusiasts, all you need is a picture of Clarence Clemons. He 
looks just like you always wished King Curtis did.<br>
<br>
And in terms of the theatre of Springsteen's show, whenever he and 
Clemons give each other five or fall into a snatch of soul dancing or 
bump into each other, it's as if the Great Spirit of R&amp;B was smiling
 on this white-punk upstart from under the boardwalk.<br>
<br>
Clemons is a mainman; he plays hot, raucous, steamy R&amp;B tenor the 
way it was meant to be played. Springsteen says, "Clarence plays the 
notes you want to hear," and he's dead-on right.<br>
<br>
Springsteen pulls off his first real and deadly coup de theatre early on
 in the set, during 'Spirit In The Night' (a song from Greetings and 
still one of his best), taken kinda looser and shakier than before.<br>
<br>
Springsteen works the front of the stage when he comes to that 
slowed-down last verse, sitting there dangling his legs off the edge, 
and as he comes to the line "Ran into the lake in just his socks and his
 shirt", he changes "lake" to "pit" and – kthunk – right on the word 
"pit" he drops down into the photo pit (which doesn't actually have any 
photographers in it, just a coupla black cops looking totally confused).<br>
<br>
The words "in his socks and shirt" come with agonised slowness from 
nowhere – no-one can see him, where the hell did that sonovabitch get 
to? – until you see fingers clawing at the other lip of the pit and arms
 reach down and haul Springsteen up until he's perched, on the edge 
right up against the front row.<br>
<br>
He turns his head and peeks over his leather shoulder with a real sly 
"Heyyyyyyyyy, man" street grin, and wriggles out of the front row's 
dutches, drops back into the pit and hauls himself back on to the stage 
just as we band rampages back into the chorus with Springsteen wildly 
strutting back and forth across the stage.<br>
<br>
Man, did they love that bit! Springsteen isn't – yet – the kind of act 
who needs to be afraid to go right down into his audience, as opposed to
 having them that tantalizing handtouch that's the rock and roll 
equivalent of the limp-fish wave that the Queen gives the plebs during 
state visits.<br>
<br>
It's a nice little populist touch, a '70s visual-aid version of those 
horrible "Hey-man-we're-all-one-man" raps that at turkey hippie bands 
used to lazy down during the more excessive moments of the '60's, but it
 was done with flash and stagecraft shrewdness of the kind that – it 
needs to be said again – are more common to black acts.<br>
<br>
When Springsteen is at his best he's funky and when he's funky he's at his best.<br>
<br>
Believe it.<br>
<br>
When he does a classic oldie, like 'Pretty Flamingo' played cool and 
sweet and steady he snaps it straight in to his own mythology.<br>
<br>
He prefaced it with a long rap about how he and Miami Steve useta lounge
 on the front porch with their guitars and watch this chick sashay by; 
and even though everybody there knew that Springsteen hadn't written the
 song (at least, I hope they knew), it had become his by osmosis; it 
clearly existed as part of the same cultural universe as his own songs, 
came from the same race.<br>
<br>
The absolute highest moment of the set was 'The E Street Shuffle', which
 expanded outwards from the bubbling, happy disco item that it was on 
the album to a whole ballet street parable.<br>
<br>
It started out with Springsteen draped against a mike stand with his cap
 askew on his head (the cap was almost visual code that he was gonna be 
at his most theatrically street), reminiscing about his early bands down
 in Ashbury Park, New Joisey and the clubs that he used to play, like 
"The Student Prince" and how his band couldn't get work because they 
played Chuck Berry and R&amp;B instead of Top 40 and Vanilla Fudge.<br>
<br>
...And how he and Miami Steve started out with a ten-piece band and 
gradually got down to a five-piece because people kept drifting away as 
the money got worse.<br>
<br>
He and Steve mime bopping down the street wondering what their band 
lacked and then you see the gigantic figure of Clemons looming out of 
the darkness just outside the spotlight.<br>
<br>
They quiver and quake in awe, all with a running commentary from 
Springsteen (who, incidentally, is a great raconteur) until Steve and 
Clemons do a slow motion soul-slap. And that the precise moment that 
their hands meet over Springsteen's head, he drops into a crouch and 
whispers, "Sparks only on E Street..." and it really is one of the 
all-time magic moments, bettered only by the bit where Springsteen 
drinks from a paper cup and flips it over his shoulder without a 
backward glance and it lands right side up.<br>
<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN'S been playing in bar bands since he was 15. He knows 
every bar band trick in the look, all the old rock-'em-sock-'em scams 
that you have to use to draw the patrons attention out of their glasses 
and onto the stage. If you can really and truly pull that one off in the
 bars, then you're gonna go great in a concert hall, where the audience 
already has its attention focussed on you.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's totally hip to that. Apart from the two numbers ('Thunder 
Road' from the new album, which acts as a breather about halfway through
 his set, and the aforementioned 'Incident On 57th Street') that he 
performs with only piano accompaniment, he never lets up on his 
audience, never stops working the hall, makes sure that there's always 
something cooking on stage, no dead space at all.<br>
<br>
It's pure comin'-straight-atcha-look-out stuff, the purest assimilation 
and distillation of the styles and ambience of timeless 
uptown-Saturday-night classic R&amp;B that I've seen from any white act 
since the heyday of J. Geils.<br>
<br>
Whether lease-lending from Chuck Berry's 'Come On' with 'Backstreets' or
 Bo Diddley on 'She's The One' or playing a searingly sweet Albert 
King/'Ain't No Sunshine' intro to 'Kitty's Back', Springsteen has a 
totally sure command of his idiom.<br>
<br>
He presents a perfect white interpretation of black music for white 
people, which ties up perfectly with his articulate-punk persona, as per
 all those CBS posters of Bruce standing lonesome in the street with a 
beat-up pair of sneakers dangling from the head of his vintage Fender 
Esquire (a perfect punk guitar, by the way; a Les Paul would look far 
too serious-musicianly for a punk image).<br>
<br>
The only trouble with the whole trip of Springsteen as ultimate punko 
deluxe is that his portrayal is too detailed and his songs are too 
sentimental and too articulate, (cf John Lennon's remark about how you 
could always recognise an actor because of the way their faces moved). 
Real punks are more like the Ramones or Television; they're so snotty 
that they couldn't even give a shit about whether you really consider 
them to be real street punks or not.<br>
<br>
Plus they write in platitudes, which is great, because the last thing on
 their minds is getting poetically agonized about their punkhood. 
Springsteen provides such a finely detailed larger-than-life portrait of
 a punk that he overkills his own verisimilitude.<br>
<br>
In a way, the street-rock of Springsteen is the exact polar opposite of 
the street-rock of Lou Reed. Reed presents himself as having gone 
through so much as to have become totally deadened to everything – 
cocooned so smoothly in his insulating smack bubble that he's an utterly
 dispassionate observer of everything that passes before his senses, 
detached to the point where all perspective vanishes and all events are 
of equal importance (the same trick that Vonnegut pulled in Breakfast Of
 Champions, in a way).<br>
<br>
Springsteen, on the other hand, lives in the same world, but he attempts
 to turn the streets and alleys of New York and Ashbury Park into a 
highly coloured, magical wonderland of a bizarre beauty and terror.<br>
<br>
Where Reed flattens it out, Springsteen imbues it with a vital, 
three-dimensional life. It's the exact opposite of the jaded 
I've-tried-everything-twice-and-got-bored-with-it-the-first-time-pass-the-valium
 school of eleganza sleaze rock, and when that energy is hung off a 
stone good-time R&amp;B show, then Christ don't it make ya feel good.<br>
<br>
That's why the records don't make it. On the records the focus is on 
Bruce the soulful poet rather than on Springsteen the whompin' stompin' 
R&amp;B man. On record you can spot every strained lyric, every 
overblown image, every little error of judgement. On stage, you just 
don't give a shit as long as Clemons is honking and Bruce is struttin' 
and Miami Steve is layin' down that sweet sweet groove.<br>
<br>
THE TROUBLE with Springsteen's new album is that it sounds as if he'd 
been told too often how important he is and as a result has set out to 
write important songs and make an important record. "It's hard to be a 
saint when you're just a poor boy on the street", wrote Springsteen on 
his first album, but the converse holds true: it's hard to be a poor boy
 on the street when the people who surround you are telling you that 
you're a saint, or at the very least, a big-ass rock and roll star.<br>
<br>
The vitality of the whole Springsteen ambience is dependent on his 
street empathy, and the bigger Springsteen gets, the more he's going to 
see of limousines and fancy hotels and record company people who fall 
over themselves to tell him he's wonderful, and the less he's going to 
see of the environment from which he drains his energy. The benefits 
that accrue to musicians because of the thing that they do well can all 
too easily incapciate them from doing that thing any longer, because it 
isolates them from the circumstances that made them want/need to do that
 thing in the first place.<br>
<br>
And then they end up playing the part of the person they used to be, 
playing it parrot fashion as if they'd learned it from someone else's 
records and videotapes, and as like as not the audiences don't know the 
difference and couldn't give a shit as long as they get what they came 
to see, and the record company sycophants and PR people don't care as 
long as dem ol' units keep getting shipped coast to coast.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's probably got a way to go before any of that starts 
happening to him, but happen it will; both because of the nature of his 
music and because of the way one or two people in his record company are
 unintentionally liable to kill the goose that lays the gold albums.<br>
<br>
See, Springsteen's early songs were written about his present; his next 
album will have to be written about his past, because his new present 
will consist of the rock star life. If he draws on that, then we're 
liable to end up with a clutch of Ian Hunter-type songs about the angst 
of the rock star, and Ian's already done that number to perfection.<br>
<br>
It's a problem that doesn't arise for the likes of, say, Elton, because 
there's nothing street about him or his show and he certainly isn't 
presenting himself as a cat off the block.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is, and soon as he ceases to be a down-in-the-alley dude, 
he'll either have to become something else or else resign himself to 
becoming just another elegant phoney.<br>
<br>
ONE OF the worries I have about Springsteen is that he may never make 
the record that hits as hard as his stage show. None of his albums pack 
more than a flyweight punch, and the only possible reason for listening 
to any of them is so that you know the songs when you see him – that is,
 if you see him.<br>
<br>
The CBS guy was of the opinion that it wasn't necessary for Springsteen 
to do anything more than a TV special – over which, naturally, he must 
have "total control" – and a London show or two.<br>
<br>
Playing Glasgow or Manchester is "not necessary" – just as doing any but
 the safest patty-cake interviews is "not necessary". Just as, if he had
 a good live album out, listening to any of his studio albums would be 
"not necessary".<br>
<br>
Still, you gotta see his show when he brings it over, because Bruce 
Springsteen and his R&amp;B Punk Ballet Company is one of the best 
things I've ever seen on a rock and roll stage.<br>
<br>
Hey, Bruce – just remember who you say you are and keep yer nose clean. And don't believe more than half of what they tell you.<br>

<br>
Andrew Tyler, NME, 15 November 1975<br>
<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN says he just writes down his impressions of stuff 
whereas here in Hollywood, Calif., there are people in from New York who
 believe otherwise. They tell you things like "Bruce is purity". Bruce 
cuts through grime in half the time. Bruce is what America has been 
praying for ever since Dylan fell off his motorbike and Brando got too 
fat to be in the motorcade any more.<br>
<br>
And it gets harder to decide what's best to believe because the people 
in from New York talk a lot louder than is natural and so do outsiders 
with a contrary understanding of the situation, coming on like a life 
depended on putting down the "I have seen mankind's future and it's a 
short, skinny guy in a brown leather jacket" theory.<br>
<br>
Bruce feels more than a little sick when he hears this kind of talk. His
 tendency, when it occurs, is to retire into a slow, agonised 
idiot-drawl, the relevance of which is not all that easily recognisable.
 But that's to his credit. Dylan, after all, never once said "Sure, I 
know the environment. The complexities of the human mind and things of 
that nature". And neither did James Dean or Brando when he was thin. It 
was only when Brando started whanging off in those kind of directions 
that his credibility was suddenly and irrevocably reduced.<br>
<br>
No. The only way to make a legitimate claim to American folk-hero status
 is to reject the candidacy as preposterous. Then clam up and spit a 
mysterious spit. And that's precisely what Bruce Springsteen from 
Freehold, N.J., is doing. Or you assume that's what he's doing.<br>
<br>
One thing's for certain, though, and that's the fundamental lack of 
modesty within the Springsteen camp on the subject of the attributes and
 infinite potential of their boy.<br>
<br>
Jon Landau, the celebrated American rock critic who quit worrying over 
an intestinal disorder to co-produce Springsteen's Born To Run album 
says that in the "rock area" Springsteen's not only a "great artist" but
 also happens to be able to do "more things better than anyone else I've
 seen". Also he's the "best performer in the history of rock 'n' roll", 
with the possible exception of Elvis P., whom he nominates mainly for 
"sentimental" reasons.<br>
<br>
Mike Appel offers scant contrast when he makes claims to being manager 
of "the greatest artist in the world today, that's all", a sentiment he 
punctuates by attacking the palm of his left hand with his right fist.<br>
<br>
Appel is a curiosity even among rock and roll managers. John Hammond, 
the Columbia talent scout who signed Springsteen, describes him as 
"offensive as any man I've ever met", a reference, no doubt, to Appel's 
boundless and sometimes absurd urges for conflict. Mostly it's the press
 who get to feel Appel's pointed end and this, it turns out, is no 
accident.<br>
<br>
"I like to do things with integrity", he notes, "and since the media is 
not set up for integrity but for their own ends, my idea of how things 
should be done and their idea of how things should be done, clash. So 
what happens is I'm the guy they focus all their hate on."<br>
<br>
Appel and Landau's extremities are matched by virtually everyone else 
within the Springsteen inner circle. Peter Philbin, Columbia's New York 
based international press officer, can talk up his client with a heat 
approaching delirium and at the recent Springsteen concerts at 
Hollywood's Roxy was not so much the impassioned go-between as one more 
nut on a chair howling his brains inside out.<br>
<br>
EVEN WITHIN his band, there's an awestruck, almost religious, regard for
 the man they call The Boss. Clarence Clemons, the 33-year-old saxman, 
sees his meeting with Springsteen as being no less than 
divinely-wrought:<br>
<br>
"Bruce is the greatest person I've ever met," he says. "He's the 
strongest person I've ever met. When I first met him it was like in the 
Bible where this guy met this guy and he say 'lay down your thing and 
follow me' and that's exactly the way I felt, man. But I didn't. And I 
punish myself. And I guess God punished me 'cos I got in this car 
accident and I nearly got killed and shit. Anyway. He came back (from 
California where he'd been visiting his parents) and we got together and
 here we are."<br>
<br>
No less extraordinary has been the contribution of Time and Newsweek to 
the ballooning Springsteen legend and the apparent ease with which Appel
 was able to manipulate these two indefatigable giants.<br>
<br>
Time had previously run a piece on Springsteen in their April 1974 
issue. Then a number of weeks ago Newsweek made approaches of their own 
and Time catching wind of the freshening scent came back for second 
helpings.<br>
<br>
(The renewed interest had probably been spurred on by Springsteen's 
dates in August at New York's Bottom Line club, out of which came the 
most excessive Bruce-Is-Easily-The-Greatest-Person-On-The-Planet 
coverage to date.) This time, Appel explained, the rules were 
substantially altered. The game now was "you give me a cover. I give you
 an interview".<br>
<br>
"...and they have to dislike you for it," he says. "They say we're New 
Musical Express, we're Melody Maker, we're Newsweek, we're Time magazine
 and who the hell are you to tell us it has to be a cover story. But I 
say to you 'I'm giving you the most coveted thing I can give you. I'm 
giving you an interview with Bruce Springsteen. There's nothing more I 
can give you'."<br>
<br>
The indefatigable two returned and the net result was that double cover 
splash on October 27 (Appel's birthday), the first for an entertainer 
since Liza Minelli's Cabaret days.<br>
<br>
Both articles were strangely impartial considering the prominence they 
attached to their subject. Lots of biographical data imput, a smattering
 of the dourest kind of rhapsodising and – in Newsweek's case – a few 
microscopic insinuations that Springsteen might, after all, be the 
gravest kind of record business hypola which, by the laws of media cause
 and effect, would render themselves and Time the victims.<br>
<br>
A few years back the pair of them would have hung majestically to one 
side until the Springsteen legend knocked them down, then they'd have 
performed the gesture of the Cover Story.<br>
<br>
These days, even Time, and Newsweek are fearful of missing out on the 
very next American sensation even if it means lining up at the wrong 
theatre before the box office opens.<br>
<br>
"It's crazy," says Springsteen. "It doesn't make too much sense and I 
don't attach too much distinction to being on the cover. It's a 
magazine. It goes all round the world but really...you know."<br>
<br>
WE'RE IN a vacant room in the Sunset Marquis, Hollywood. Springsteen's 
eating a bowl of Rice Crispies. Already he's got on his brown leather 
jacket and he looks like he hasn't slept in maybe four weeks.<br>
<br>
"It doesn't have that much to do with what I'm doing," he says. "I don't
 think so. The main reason I went through with it...you see one of the 
things I did want, I wanted 'Born To Run' to be a hit single. Not for 
the bucks but because I really believed m the song a whole lot and I 
just wanted to hear it on the radio, you know. On AM. Across the 
country. For me, that's where a song should be.<br>
<br>
"And they said, well if you get your picture on Time, or sumpin', 
programme directors may think twice before they drop it or throw it out.
 So the only physical reason I was on that thing was for that reason 
specifically, you know. Otherwise, man, I'll probably regret it, you 
know."<br>
<br>
Rolling Stone played an altogether cooler game. Still up in the air and 
blowing off over their Patty Hearst exclusives, their preference was to 
regard Springsteen as another of those East Coast phenomena, the kind 
that blows in and out with the frequency of the Atlantic tide.<br>
<br>
And Playboy...Appel also tried to hustle a Playboy cover but was told 
that the Big Bunny would rather take it in the eye than set that kind of
 precedent.<br>
<br>
AND SO it was to the Roxy in Hollywood that the Springsteen entourage 
came October 16 to 19 to debunk the hype, perjury and associated 
theories, and it was with a deal of noise and small regard for the 
agreed subtleties that CBS applied themselves to the task. They began 
with a 50 per cent stake in the opening night house and bought in from 
there until your average man on the street needed air and ground troop 
support to get into the place.<br>
<br>
By way of consolation, a roster of Hollywood's brightest show-stoppers 
turned up to lend their support...a line-up that by week's end included 
Jack Nicholson, G. Harrison, Jackson Browne, Neil Diamond, Jackie De 
Shannon (backstage introduction), Carole King (backstage introduction), 
Joni Mitchell (left early), Cher and Greg (twice), Tom Waits (hitched 
from his own gig 90 miles away), Dick Carpenter ("John, a Marguerita!") 
Wolfman Jack (?) and Warren Beatty.<br>
<br>
First night there was the usual pre-performance walking to and fro; the 
conspicious nonchalance, Hollywood hugging, shouting across tables and 
explanations as to the root cause and nature of the Springsteen 
phenomena, and by the time Bruce actually walked out on stage everyone 
was so relieved at not having to exhibit epic boredom any more that the 
house lit up with a screaming and a wailing that must have scared him 
half to death.<br>
<br>
He heads straight for stage centre, which is dark, empty and almost 
eerie save for the screaming going on, leans his head and body against 
the mike stand and just to further irritate those Dylan comparisons 
whips out a harmonica for the opening of 'Thunder Road'.<br>
<br>
He's got on a beaten-up leather jacket, a pair of tight blue Levis. He's
 small, he's skinny and his harp playing's every bit as dumb as Dylan's.<br>
<br>
The Screen door slams<br>
Mary's dress waves<br>
Like a vision she dances across the porch...<br>
<br>
A prelude to a number about a woeful girl waiting for her King Kong to 
come along and make sense out of her dreaming and Springsteen as the guy
 who says "what the hell, things might not be so perfect around here but
 let's jump in the old wagon anyway and take a ride along Thunder Road".<br>
<br>
Hey I know it's late we can make it if we run<br>
<br>
There's just a piano pumping away and Springsteen's knotty, out-of-tune 
voice...and dead still. Head bowed. Brando, in The Men, as his girl's 
telling him she'll love him forever even though his legs don't work any 
more. Actually, it's all pretty embarrassing. And with folk through the 
house going "whoop, yeah...you sure can make a guitar sing, Bruce", you 
feel kind of ominously out of sync.<br>
<br>
Then the band comes out for ''Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out', also from Born 
To Run, and the lights flash on and Springsteen starts whipping and 
winding up his body, attempting to lend the appearance of weight to what
 on record is a fairly inconsequential moment. Cluttered, dense lyrics. A
 melody and arrangement that are a patchwork of some of the more dubious
 R 'n' R mannerisms of the early sixties.<br>
<br>
'Spirit In The Night' is one of his few genuinely stirring melodies, 
even though it leans too heavily on Van Morrison. An early song, from 
Greetings From Asbury Park, a period when Springsteen was caught up with
 the flash of the exploding metaphor...gypsy angels, mission men and a 
preponderance of internal rhyme and lines that get left hanging.<br>
<br>
Crazy Janey, Wild Billy and a bunch more drive out to Greasy Lake "about
 a mile down on the dark side of route eighty-eight" where Janey's 
fingers wind up in the author's "cake". The love scene is played out in 
the dark with Springsteen lying prone across a line of tables that reach
 out to the stage. Girls rub his back as he sings "Me and Crazy Jane was
 making love in the dirt singing our birthday songs" Then the band and 
the spots light up, Springsteen jogs back to the stage and the house 
goes wild with delight (for Janey and her lover that night).<br>
<br>
For the opening of the old Manfred Mann number, 'Pretty Flamingo', 
Springsteen delivers a rambling explanation-as-to-the-origins monologue 
that's half-heard, half-grunt and a pretty fine enactment of dumb 
barhouse literacy. The kind of punchy drool that Dean gloried in. 
Everyone gets to feel mean in the presence of this kind of talk.<br>
<br>
More sordid still is the way he frames the opening to 'E Street 
Shuffle'. Here he tells the largely factual account of how he met up 
with saxman Clemons who'd been playing with a local Asbury Park R 'n' B 
band when a girlfriend told him he'd best go down to the Student Prince 
and look in on this kid Springsteen.<br>
<br>
The way Springsteen tells it, he and his guitarist Miami Steve were 
shuffling through the cold and foggy night when through the smoke they 
see a big man coming at them. They hide in a doorway and fall to their 
knees as the big man approaches.<br>
<br>
They're scared and they're cold and they're getting ready to run when 
Clarence holds out a hand, Springsteen reaches out to meet it. They 
touch. And sparks fly out on E Street.<br>
<br>
The magic of Springsteen is right here...at the climax of this 
particular yarn. On the word "sparks", the stage flashes red, 
Springsteen leaps to a standstill and the band slams in with the kind of
 precision entrance that occurs only when there's an operating 
concensus. From now on the show's alive, more refined...a state of 
affairs that very nearly extends to the music itself.<br>
<br>
'Kitty's Back', 'Jungleland' and 'Rosalita' have that foggy West Side 
tilt to them and although neither is a miracle of construction there's 
enough ongoing momentum – and in the case of 'Kitty's Back', a climactic
 instrumental segment – to eclipse the dubious areas.<br>
<br>
The band, in fact, is surprisingly adept at locating Springsteen's 
half-concealed intentions. Excellent solos are forthcoming in both 
'Rosalita' and 'Kitty's Back'...especially from pianist Roy Bitten...and
 only organist Danny Federici, whose tendency is to grip the high end of
 the board a lot longer than is attractive, is suspect here.<br>
<br>
Just one encore tonight...a high drama mood piece with accordian and sometimes-whispered lyrics.<br>
<br>
'Sandy's about Bruce, or someone a lot like Bruce, readying himself to 
quit the boardwalk life and it gives Springsteen the chance to open up 
on the reckless inhabitants of that whole scene. The clairvoyants, the 
bikers, waitresses, someone called Madame Marie, each of them shuffling 
back and forth from nothing to not much more.<br>
<br>
Lyrically it's one of his most interesting pieces, since it's one of the
 few moments he chooses to lay bare the disillusionment he patently 
feels for all the shucking from pintable to roadside diner to trash can 
which in most of his later works he's inadvertently glorifying.<br>
<br>
"'Born To Run'" he says, "was about New York. I was there for months. I 
had this girl with me and she'd just come m from Texas and she wanted to
 go home again and she was going nuts and we were in this room and it 
just went on and on. I would come home and she would say 'Are you done? 
Is it over? Are you finished?' And I said 'No, it ain't over, it ain't 
over.' I'd come home practically in tears."<br>
<br>
"And I was sort of into that whole thing of being nowhere. But knowing 
that there is something someplace. It's got to be like right there. It's
 got to be tight somewhere."<br>
<br>
BORN TO RUN had already been eight months in the making when Jon Landau 
(prev. exp. MC5's Back In The USA plus two Livingston Taylor albums) 
moved in on the job. With Landau around things continued to move at a 
deathly doze, although the further four and a half months taken to 
complete the package was, by contrast, an exhibition of fire and 
lightning.<br>
<br>
Landau attributes the delays to Springsteen's fetish for detail: "He'd 
spend hours", he says, "on one line. He'd say 'hang on guys, I wanna 
check a line' and four hours later he'd be sitting there trying to make 
the most minute changes in one verse."<br>
<br>
The pair had met April '74 in a Boston club called Charlie's where the 
Springsteen band were playing. In the club window was a blow-up of a 
review Landau had just written for the local Real Paper – an A-minus 
piece that dealt with Springsteen's "many imperfections" as well as his 
considerable potential for world domination.<br>
<br>
It was a cold night, Landau remembers, and be found Springsteen its the 
back garden in a t-shirt, jumping up and down as he read the review.<br>
<br>
Springsteen told him he'd read better but the piece was okay, and then Landau introduced himself.<br>
<br>
The show he saw that night he describes as "astounding" although no more
 than "a rough draft" of what takes place these days. The pair kept in 
touch and a month later Landau went into print with that high voltage 
review that Columbia subsequently spent 50,000 dollars promoting...the 
"I have seen rock n roll's future and its name is Bruce Springsteen" 
job.<br>
<br>
Not that CBS didn't require an amount of cattle prodding before lining 
up behind the Springsteen/Landau combination. Factionalism within the 
company was rife...due partly to the flamboyance of Appel and the 
intractable nature of his client and also because Springsteen was a 
prodigy of "disgraced" chief executive Clive Davis.<br>
<br>
There were even reports of an alleged plot where the Springsteen myth, 
would be hatched solely to irritate Bob Dylan, who'd recently left CBS 
for a two-record deal with David Geffen's Asylum company.<br>
<br>
Appel himself goes more than half way to conceding that such a plan might well have existed.<br>
<br>
"When you're involved in big-time record company management", he says, 
"There are power plays. There's how do you bring a Bob Dylan into line, 
how do you bring his lawyer into line.<br>
<br>
"His lawyer comes in and asks for the world...asks for retroactive 
royalties on Bob Dylan's albums. Asking outrageous sums of money. All 
kinds of deals. All kinds of big spending. And then when the 
negotiations fail, Clive Davis had left the record company and the whole
 world was looking at Columbia Records and everyone was taking pot shots
 at them. They were very nervous. Very uptight at this particular time, 
trying to prove themselves. Naturally they might have said, you know, in
 the heat of the mement, 'screw Bob Dylan, we're going to take Bruce 
Springsteen and use him and show that guy just where it's at.' However, 
that wasn't to be the case because it took us a long time to get our 
album together and Blood On Tracks and all that had come out ahead of 
us. And they did manage to get Bob back."<br>
<br>
A suitably ironic climax to this particular episode was the request made
 through CBS by Time magazine for an interview with Bob Dylan on the 
subject of Bruce Springsteen. The request was rejected.<br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN IS bewildered rather than flattered by the machinations on 
his behalf...the hoops he has to go through for the front pages.<br>
<br>
"They made the mistake," he says, "They came out with the big hype. I 
mean how can they expect people to swallow something like that? (CBS's 
early ads comparing him with Dylan). And it blows my mind how they can 
underestimate people so much. All the time, man, it's like...trying to 
find some room, man. Gimme some damn room. Give me a break, I was trying
 to tell these guys at the record company, 'wait a second, you guys. Are
 you trying to kill me?' It was like a suicide attempt on their part. It
 was like somebody didn't want to make no money.<br>
<br>
"I was in this big shadow, man, right from the start...and I'm just 
getting over this Dylan thing: 'Oh thank God that seems to be fading 
away' and I'm sitting home thinking thank God people seem to be letting 
that lie and phwooooeee 'I have seen...'. No, it can't be.<br>
<br>
"So immediately I call up the company and I say get that quote out. And 
it was like, Landau's article. And it was really a nice piece and it 
meant a lot to me but it was like they took it all out of context and 
blew it up and who's gonna swallow that? Who's gonna believe that? It's 
going to piss people off, man. It pisses me off. When I read it I want 
to strangle the guy who put that thing in there. It's like you want to 
kill these guys for doin' stuff like that.<br>
<br>
"They sneak it in on you. They sneak it in and they don't tell you 
nutin' It's like 'shot gun murderer chops off eight arms.' It's that 
kind of tactic, you know. It's that kind of tactic and they pull it for 
themselves and they pull it for me too...<br>
<br>
"It's a stupid thing. Ignore it, you know. Ignore the whole thing 
because it don't make any sense. So like I'm always ten points down cos 
not only have you got to play but you got to blow this bullshit out of 
people's minds first."<br>
<br>
It was so beautiful, I felt James Dean was back...When I saw James Dean 
for the first time I fell on the floor. When I saw Bob Dylan for the 
first time I fell on the floor. When I saw Bruce Springsteen for the 
first time I fell on the floor<br>
– Jackie De Shannon over a cup of morning coffee.<br>
<br>
"Nah, it's like...if anything, you know. All I do, like, I write down my
 impressions of stuff, like, and what I see, you know. It's like...but 
if you're looking for something to look to...if you're into the band 
it's like...I don't know. I can't really see myself like that."<br>
<br>
Appel has a more adroit interpretation of the hype-versus-legitimacy 
dialectic and it goes like this: "I just say to myself 'Listen fellows 
(Of the press) your vanities may have been up, your ego might have been 
up but let's stop the bullshit. The kid's really good. He's really 
different. If you've any kind of talent you'll recognise him. If you 
don't you'll be run over. It's like a steamroller. We'll win in the end.
 You've got no chance against us. You've got no chance because we're 
right. We're good'."<br>
<br>
Appel used to write commercial jingles. He was also in the marine 
reserves and if he comes on a little like Ed Sullivan meets Joseph 
Goebbels that's roughly the way Springsteen sees it too.<br>
<br>
"It's like you can't lay an attitude on people. It's like bullshit. It's
 like a jive thing. It's a terrible thing. You can't come on like you're
 some big deal, you know. I ain't into coming on like that because it's a
 basic thing that's going on. It's a simple thing. It's a band, you 
know. It's a rock and roll band and you just sing and write songs.<br>
<br>
Appel got to meet Springsteen through an early mutual accomplice called 
Tinker. Tinker started out building drag racers in California, moved to 
Nassau where he helped launch astronauts into space and wound up 
manufacturing surfboards in New Jersey. Springsteen met him in a bar. He
 was 18 years old and Tinker said he could get him a job as a guitar 
player with Janis Joplin's band.<br>
<br>
"I ended up living with him in a surfboard factory for about a year and a half. It was dynamite up there."<br>
<br>
The first time Springsteen stepped outside the Jersey state line was 
with Tinker. Everyone in the band saved up a hundred dollars and drove 
out to California in a station wagon and a Chevy track, Springsteen 
flipped from coast to coast during the next four years before realising 
the best band he could ever have was waiting for him in NJ.<br>
<br>
In 1970 or '71 – he doesn't remember – Tinker took him to New York to 
meet with Appel and just like in a B-movie plot Appel is knocked out by 
the curly haired kid with the wooden guitar and within months has him 
eyeballing with the big record company talent scout.<br>
<br>
Springsteen at the time is reading Anthony Scaduto's book on Dylan and 
is fired up over the scene where Dylan launches himself into John 
Hammond's office, plays a couple of tunes and gets signed in a big 
hurry. So Springsteen and Appel try their hand and it works a second 
time.<br>
<br>
And that brings us through two low-impact albums followed by a 
regeneration of Columbia's corporate faith back to the Roxy in Hollywood
 where by week's end Springsteen is being exalted to a degree that puts 
you in mind of Appel's steamroller doctrine. By now even Walter 
Yetnikoff, president of the Columbia Records Group, is up on his chair, 
stirred, possibly, by the avalanche of dollars that is mounting in his 
imagination.<br>
<br>
The kids too – and by now it's the punter class – have taken on a 
demeanor that bears more than a passing resemblance to the early Beatle 
years, except these kids are older and so is Springsteen (26).<br>
<br>
But the years are no insulation against the Springsteen wall of faith as
 codified by Appel, Landau and Philbin and expressed, if haltingly by 
now, by Brucesteen himself.<br>
<br>
Time and Newsweek believed, and the punters believe because anything can
 be believed that is supported by the indomitable will of unyielding 
faith as manifest by the aforementioned.<br>
<br>
Springsteen could eat a camel whole, so long as he believed such a 
project wasn't outside his range, so long as the camel believed and the 
camel trader believed...or a king's new clothes situation where no-one 
notices the king's fat, naked legs until a kid says "Hey, where's his 
trousers" and all that faith drains away in a second and a half.<br>
<br>
Given that sooner or later someone's going to speak up, the deciding 
factor remains whether or not Springsteen actually has anything to cover
 his legs...that something being artistic substance and I'll offer the 
opinion that Springsteen is indeed naked. That he's no more than a front
 man for another good rock and roll band, composer of R'n'B slanted 
material that tips a little in advance of the mean average. The supposed
 profoundly cerebral inclinations are also misleading because 
Springsteen has neither the originality or the intentions – political or
 otherwise – of a Dylan which leaves him with a sackful of punk, loner 
mannerisms that he's already tiring of...a situation that probably 
caused the making of Born To Run to be such a vexed and anxious 121/2 
months.<br>
<br>
Springsteen has a will and a strong dramatic style and the air of the 
all-American loner who the guys in the gang ask of "where ya goin', 
Brucie?" and Springsteen grunts and goes off to the pier or to meet his 
girl whom he loves with a loyal and refined urgency as opposed to, say, 
Jagger, who could wake up anyplace and not remember how. And he exudes 
that dumb animal wisdom that made Brando and Dean such attractive 
propositions, even though Springsteen tries to upset the image with 
literary pretentions.<br>
<br>
Appel, Landau and Philbin think they have to protect and talk up their 
man otherwise he dies, whereas Springsteen says he needs protecting from
 Landau, Appel, Philbin and others of their mentality.<br>
<br>
So already the wall of faith is beginning to rupture and in six months 
Springsteen will be either musically wiped out, or more likely, another 
averagely regarded also-ran shouldering the resentment of punters and 
business types who by how see themselves as being suckered and duped.<br>
<br>
"I used to feel I always was in control," says Springsteen, "but now I'm not so sure."<br>

Bruce Springsteen: The Palladium, New York<br>
<br>
Chris Charlesworth, Melody Maker, November 6 1976</strong><br>
<br>
IT MAY rain or snow, and the temperature in New York might even drop 
below freezing-point this weekend, but so long as Bruce Springsteen is 
playing downtown at the Palladium the next few days won't be so bad. And
 for those lucky enough to have obtained tickets, the days grow ripe 
with anticipation.<br>
<br>
Few artists in rock have suffered the burdens that Bruce Springsteen has
 borne on his none-too-square shoulders. He was branded a hype because 
of the monumental publicity he received, publicity he didn't instigate, 
and now he's in the throes of a million-dollar lawsuit after a tiff with
 his manager.<br>
<br>
Prevented from making a follow-up album to Born To Run, he's out there 
playing – and playing with all the enthusiasm and, if you'll pardon the 
superlative, the brilliance, that caused all the publicity in the first 
place.<br>
<br>
Springsteen began the first of a six-night stint at the New York 
Palladium on Thursday evening. All six nights have sold out which, for 
the benefit of those who consider him to be a flash-in-the-pan, is the 
equivalent to selling out a show at Madison Square Garden.<br>
<br>
But Bruce doesn't do things like that. I'll wager a pound to a penny 
that in a year's time, when Springsteen is even more popular than he is 
now, he won't be playing at the Garden. He'll just do 12 nights at the 
Palladium instead.<br>
<br>
On Thursday he delivered 17 songs, five of them encores and three of 
them new and, apparently, ready to be recorded. He started an hour late,
 but the delays were soon forgotten as he tore into a set that 
epitomised everything that a rock show should be: great tension, dynamic
 vocals, visual action, much more than technically proficient 
instrumental, and lighting that was stunning.<br>
<br>
Let's deal with the new songs first. 'Rendezvous' is a rocker that had 
Bruce buckling at the knees with excitement; 'Something In The Night' is
 a slower piece, with minimal backing (brass, piano and tambourine 
only), highlighted by a muted trumpet solo; and 'The Promise' is a 
moving tale of growing up in New Jersey that seems oddly 
autobiographical. Bruce sings it straight from the piano with just 
glockenspiel for accompaniment.<br>
<br>
Also "new" is a fearless version of the old Animals' hit, 'It's My Life 
(And I'll Do What I Want)', which opens with a piercing, echo-ridden 
guitar solo by Bruce and moves into a monologue about a conversation 
with his father before sliding into top gear and hitting the song 
proper. It follows on the tradition of 'Pretty Flamingo', which isn't 
included this time around.<br>
<br>
By the third number of the show, 'Spirit In The Night', Bruce had left 
the stage and jumped into the audience, singing as he walked up the 
aisle with only a roadie to protect him from straining arms: a 
calculated risk but a shrewd move to gain audience approval. He repeated
 the gesture often.<br>
<br>
'She's The One' has now taken on an even stronger Bo Diddley rhythm. It 
opens with a long, sliding solo by Bruce and meanders off into those 
tried and tested rhythms; at one point I thought he was about to slip 
into 'Mona', but he didn't.<br>
<br>
Other tracks from Born To Run – '10th Avenue Freeze-Out', 'Thunder 
Road', 'Backstreets' and 'Jungleland' – were all offered with variations
 on the recorded versions.<br>
<br>
For some tunes an enlarged brass section (whom Bruce described as the 
Miami Horns) was brought up although Clarence Clemons, Brace's gigantic 
black horn player, is as forceful as ever in his role as King Curtis 
reincarnate.<br>
<br>
The East Street Band, tight yet flexible, still pack a punch that Bruce 
can't do without. It does seem, though, that Miami Steve (Van Zandt) is 
taking a lesser role, allowing Springsteen to do more guitar soloing as 
well as leading the band.<br>
<br>
Bruce's old, battered Telecaster never sounded better, rippling with 
rich tones in the mid-range instead of the maximum treble that most rock
 guitarists rely on all too much.<br>
<br>
'Rosalita', extended to about 15 minutes, closed the show, though Bruce 
came back for two encores, the first a three-song marathon and the 
second a two song segue.<br>
<br>
'Sandy', sung harsher and with new lyrics to a couple of the verses, 
opened the marathon with its regular accordion accompaniment, followed 
by a couple of oldies, 'She's Fine, Fine, Fine' and 'Raise Your Hand', 
the old R and B standard.<br>
<br>
Throughout his career Springsteen has always managed to breath life into
 oldies almost forgotten. No exception here: the E Street Band 
transformed themselves into a rugged show-band and delivered with all 
the panache of Geno Washington's Ram Jam Band.<br>
<br>
'Born To Run' closed the show, making a late appearance in the 
programme, almost as if the star was reluctant to play his biggest-ever 
song.<br>
<br>
He'd been on stage two hours and by this time both the audience – they'd
 been on their feet most of the time – and the band were pooped. The 
house lights rose to an exhausted, rather limp, ovation, and it was 
over.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is no hype. He may not be the future of rock and roll,
 but he is the most engaging, exciting and enthusiastic performer in 
rock right now. It'll take more than lawsuits to dampen his spirits, and
 that is something for which we can all be thankful.<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: Reborn and Running Again<br>
<br>
Harvey Kubernik, Melody Maker, June 10 1978<br>
<br>
EVEN BEFORE the two brilliant concerts at the Spectrum earlier in the 
week, Bruce Springsteen could have been the Mayor of Philadelphia if he 
had ever decided to campaign.<br>
<br>
I arrived at the Spectrum two hours before showtime, looking for a 
burger stand and a chance to talk with ticket holders on their way to 
Springsteen's long-sold-out shows.<br>
<br>
I chatted with a guy named Dave, who works in a record and tape retail 
outlet in South Philadelphia, and explained Springsteen's drawing power 
in this Eastern city: "The first day 'Born To Run' was released it sold 
20,000 copies and another 20,000 copies the next day."<br>
<br>
Local FM station WMR first broke Springsteen five years ago when his 
Greetings From Asbury Park NJ album was issued. Bruce and his band have 
been big in this city long before the rest of the United States and the 
world.<br>
<br>
In the next few months, Springsteen and Co. will play 75 concerts before a planned trip to Europe and England in the autumn.<br>
<br>
I'll say this now: I've probably seen 2,000 concerts and club dates over
 the last 20 years. Based on the two performances I attended in this 
city by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, I would rank them right
 at the top of my all-time check list.<br>
<br>
The two-and-a-half hour programme is awesome. Springsteen keeps getting 
better with age and the E Street Band are just as arresting.<br>
<br>
When Bruce Springsteen comes to Philadelphia it's an event, not a 
concert. He played the Spectrum in 1976 and his return to this site is 
greeted with the same expectations one associates with the Rolling 
Stones, without the drugs or arrests.<br>
<br>
LAST MONTH I was walking down Santa Monica Bvld in West Hollywood, 
waiting for the light to change at the Sweetzer intersection and I 
noticed a familiar figure hoofing it down the pavement. It was Bruce 
Springsteen.<br>
<br>
We chatted for a while, talked a bit about his new album, which he was mixing in LA, and as usual he was very friendly and warm.<br>
<br>
I've seen this guy play 15 times over the last five years. From his 
legendary Troubadour club date to the cosmic Roxy stint in October 1975,
 he always dazzles.<br>
<br>
And I've got to thank Kim Fowley for taking me to my initial Springsteen
 concert in 1973 at the Ahmanson Theatre, where Clive Davis hosted the 
Week To Remember concert series.<br>
<br>
At the time Kim was writing songs for The New Riders Of The Purple Sage,
 who shared the bill with Springsteen that evening. I'll never forget 
Springsteen doing 'Wild Billy's Circus', and the CBS executive leaning 
over across the aisle and whispering to Kim: "What do ya think of this 
guy? Some of these words are from Mars."<br>
<br>
And in true Fowley tradition, Kim replied: "I wish I had his publishing on any planet."<br>
<br>
The record company employee laughed and later that night I told the 
story to Clive Davis, who treated us like royalty for the rest of the 
engagement.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's catalogue has charted very well in the US. The Hollies 
covered 'Sandy', Manfred Mann hit number one with 'Blinded By The 
Light', and Greg Kihn ('For You'), Patti Smith ('Because The Night'), 
and Robert Gordon ('Fire') have all benefited by Springsteen's songs. 
Bruce is even on the next Dictators album in a cameo role, just like 
he's on the latest Lou Reed album.<br>
<br>
The point is, Bruce Springsteen always delivers. He helps people get on 
the chart, or get back on the chart, as well as giving some of the best 
rock 'n' roll concerts available on the circuit. And he's so unassuming.<br>
<br>
Getting back to the street corner on Santa Monica Bvld. I asked him 
about the live gigs he was starting at the end of the month. "It's gonna
 be hot," he mentioned. He was modest. The gigs were as hot as Las Vegas
 in August.<br>
<br>
We parted, and I ran into him that night at the Starwood where Blondie 
were playing. He was watching with the people on the floor and not 
sitting in the reserved section upstairs.<br>
<br>
Knowing him, he probably paid to get in and didn't even bother going 
through the VIP entrance. I offered him a ride back to his hotel at 2.30
 am but he politely declined, opting to walk down the street.<br>
<br>
ANOTHER thing that impresses me about the Philadelphia Springsteen 
concerts is that everyone knows the names of all the band members. It's 
like a baseball team, where people have followed the progress of the 
players since they hit the big leagues.<br>
<br>
On stage, the band are so passionate and energetic, I sometimes think 
they are the best kept secret in showbiz. Bruce and the E Streeters use 
tools and roots from the Fifties and Sixties, but the topics and themes 
explored in the songs have such a contemporary veneer.<br>
<br>
And, unlike a lot of entertainers who mouth off in the music press about
 nationalistic zeal, this is one person who is so American that he'll 
present a real image of America which the press always hides from the 
people.<br>
<br>
A Springsteen performance is a dramatic rock 'n' roll show which one never tires of.<br>
<br>
Roy Bittan's piano work has graced Bowie's Station To Station, the Peter
 Gabriel solo album and the Meat Loaf album. Bittan is a fine piano 
player.<br>
<br>
The sound mix for a Springsteen concert is remarkable: you can hear all the piano notes without straining.<br>
<br>
After the first night, I had a chance to speak to Roy. "It's 
unbelievable playing again. Feels great. We can see the light at the end
 of the tunnel."<br>
<br>
Another impressive addition to the Springsteen sound is organist Danny 
Federici. His playing reminds me of Stevie Winwood and it's ironic to 
find out from bassist Garry Tallent that before Federici joined the 
band, they used to do a live rendition of 'Gimme Some Lovin'', the 
Spencer Davis song.<br>
<br>
Danny does very few solos in the show, but is a functional player who 
offers well-defined passages and, like the rest of the band, doesn't 
fall into the trap of egotism. This is team work on display.<br>
<br>
Danny was also quite pleased by the Philadelphia fan reaction "Bruce has
 always been popular here, even before I joined the band. He dedicated 
'For You' to the audience tonight. They have been with him from the 
start."<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: The River<br>
<br>
Phil Sutcliffe, Sounds, 11 October 1980<br>
<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN once said simply this: "I want it all." I've taken it 
out of context but, judging by the recent Dave Marsh biography, it 
stands as some kind of truth about him. It's incomplete though because 
it doesn't add that what he might take from one man or one moment he 
will try to give back to everybody all the time. He has 'magnanimity' in
 the full Ancient Roman sense, the ripest generosity of spirit. Like any
 great artist he will receive the emotional equivalent of three loaves 
and two fishes and feed five thousand.<br>
<br>
The River is a double LP sporting 83 minutes of music on 20 tracks which
 include eight gut-wrenching classics of the incomparable caliber he 
achieved with 'Darkness on The Edge Of Town' and several other noble 
neat misses. Overall though it has a completely different flavour 
because of the inclusion of half a dozen entirely barmy rockers with the
 E Street Band going bananas in the superbly stupid vein of heroes like 
Cochran, Berry and Lewis. 'Darkness' had no light. 'The River' shimmers 
with it as Springsteen acknowledges that the surface has its charms, 
even if any swimmer worth his salt has to dive deep sometimes. So he 
takes a gambol.<br>
<br>
Biffing his guitar like Keith Richard and letting out a terrific yell of
 a vocal in 'Crush On You' he's running down the street (or rather his 
projection of self-as-hero is) when a car pulls up at the lights ahead 
of him and "What was inside, man, was just c'est magnifique/I wanted to 
hold the bumper and let her drag me down the street!" In 'Sherry 
Darling' there's what Ian Dury would call a riotous assembly of whooping
 and clapping going on, but Springsteen is less happy because he's got 
to drive his girl's mother to the "unemployment agency" and her yapping 
in the back seat is more than he can take:<br>
<br>
You can tell her there's a hot sun beating on the black top<br>
She keeps talkin' she'll be walkin' that last block<br>
...Now Sherry my love for you is real<br>
But I didn't count on this package deal.<br>
<br>
The comic songs are well written, but they end up more about 
rock'n'rolling than laughing because of Springsteen's flat out approach.
 He lacks the witty sparkle or Berry or Cochran's delivery. The songs 
are welcome though as I suspect few people are capable of holding up 
under the emotional beating he could give out in the course of a wholly 
serious double LP. Significantly all of the funnies were written this 
year and most of the heavyweights copyrighted in '79. Whether it was a 
conscious leavening or merely a change of mood it shows Springsteen's 
developing sensitivity to the structure of a record.<br>
<br>
However, the reason he's there is to over-reach, perform the impossible,
 dirty you and cleans you, beat up and heal you, do it all night, all or
 nothing. The Springsteen keywords recur from his previous albums: heart
 darkness, work, the street death. The Big Subjects all right. Life and 
death, always asking "why?" He's brave. He dares to deal in archetypal 
images – which you might regard less grandly as the oldest clichés in 
the book. 'The River' itself. He dives into the river with his girl in 
much the same way as in 'Racing In The Street' (Darkness) with a 
different woman he sought purification: "Tonight my baby and me, we're 
gonna ride to the sea/And wash these sins off our hands." But typically 
both songs survive the weight of tired tradition bearing down on them by
 dint of the mighty imaginative effort which has clearly gone into 
conceiving story and character. A lyric may be only 300 words long, 
rather less than the average live review in this paper, but you feel he 
could have written each one as a novel, he seems to have such breadth of
 scope and knowledge of detail. So the stories and their language reach 
you as literal first, literary second by a distance. The only exception 
on this album is 'The Price You Pay' which is overtly philosophical and 
travels on symbols abstracted from any specific sequence of human events
 – consequently it's only saved from ponderousness by a beautiful high 
harmony Springsteen pitches against his lead vocal, saving the sense 
with sound.<br>
<br>
In his best songs Springsteen's people ordinary people, fill the sky, 
the workaday thrown on to a giant movie screen and revealed as a true 
epic. Invariably at the heart of it is a relationship – or rather than 
that bland-out jargon word, I should say "a passion". Compare 
Springsteen's performance on The River with Darkness though and you find
 a huge shift. Where Springsteen used to run bare-naked through his 
emotions now he wears a sober suit. He's been over the top, he knows he 
can do that. This time it seems he wanted to see whether he could tear 
it apart quietly. Brave again. Restraint might have called his bluff, 
exposed him as just plain noisy rather than soulful. It didn't. The 
feeling comes achieving through. The Federici/Bittan organ/piano axis 
responds in excelsis with an empathy which is potent even when they're 
not blowing down the walls – though they still get to swing the hammer 
often enough and with stupendous style.<br>
<br>
The title track and 'Independence Day' are his most magnificent 
expressions of ruined passion. The E Street Band matches Springsteen in 
holding back with a gentleness you'd barely believe from their 
wall-of-sound thunderings: acoustic guitar, piano pipe organ, a rhythm 
just above a whisper. In 'The River' they cup this gem of tenderness in 
their hands:<br>
<br>
But I remember us riding in my brother's car<br>
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir<br>
At night on them banks I'd lie awake<br>
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the crucial factor about his stories in that they concern 
blue-collar labourers, like Springsteen's own family, and it's the 
bitter grind they are forced into which crushes their spirits, isolates 
and cripples them. After the shotgun wedding,<br>
<br>
I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company<br>
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the company.<br>
<br>
He floats that idea as the nearest he can come to a rational explanation
 of what went wrong, but less tangible things had started to twist it 
back when "for my 19th birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat".<br>
<br>
The song leaves its protagonist staring in pained bafflement at the 
dried-up river bed. 'Independence Day' takes the tragic vision a step 
further. On stage Springsteen sets this one up in autobiographical terms
 as being about his feud with his father and leaving home. It's 
introduced with both of them too worn-out to row anymore, like a couple 
of characters in Eugene O'Neill play. With hurt, weary grace, balanced 
by Clarence Clemmons' stately sax solo, Springsteen sings,<br>
<br>
There was just no way this house could hold the two of us<br>
I guess that we were just too much of the same kind.<br>
<br>
It's a moving description, but the real breakthrough into awareness and 
the kind of love which can co-exist with independence comes at the end 
when Springsteen sees that he and his father really are of one flesh, 
pieces of the same jigsaw, victims:<br>
<br>
Nothing we can say can change anything now<br>
Because there's just different people coming down here now and they see things in different ways<br>
And soon everything we've known will just be swept away<br>
And soon everything we've known will just be swept away.<br>
<br>
I think that's something like what Aristototle meant when he wrote about 'catharsis' in his definition of tragic drama.<br>
<br>
That aspect of the album is great, but bloomy. The jokey ones aren't 
Springsteen's only answer to weltschermz thought. He's also a roaring 
optimist who can make that assertion of hope from 'Badlands' course 
through your veins like a supercharge of adrenalin. 'Hungry Heart', the 
likely single, leaps at you with gloriously pounding piano, burping sax 
and a triumphant yell of "Yeah!" from Springsteen. It delivers its 
novel-length story in two lines:<br>
<br>
Got a wife and kids in Baltimore Jack<br>
I went out for a ride and I never went back.<br>
<br>
It becomes an exultant holler of freedom which consists in having that 
"hungry heart", even if, by the end of the song, that hunger is for a 
home and girl again – the searching and the longing, the passion, is 
all. Springsteen hones the familiar rough edges of his voice for this 
one track and the effect is stunning, an inspiring innocence.<br>
<br>
I can't think of more celebratory piece of music than 'Hungry Heart'. 
But that innocence has to be weathered by experience to achieve a 
convincing antithesis to the grief elsewhere on the album. 'Drive All 
Night' is the song that takes you there. Subdued again, the rhythm 
section murmurs, Springsteen himself plays a simple figure on piano and 
then pours his heart into<br>
<br>
When I lost you honey sometimes I think I lost my guts too<br>
Lying in the heat of the night like prisoners all our lives<br>
I get shivers down my spine and all I wanna do is hold you tight.<br>
<br>
The forebodings and perspective of death are handled with similar 
resonance in two other powerful tracks, 'Stolen Car' and 'Wreck On The 
Highway'. Inevitably he chases the girl, drives all night. We don't and 
won't know whether he finds her. Probably not. What matters, what stands
 your hair on end, is the unvanquished avowal of love in all its 
dimensions – lust and the platonic ideal galvanised into one by the 
magnitude of emotion. When in the course of a very long, slow coda 
Springsteen throws everything he's known, lived and imagined and soul' 
the roof could fall in and I wouldn't notice. Enthralling. And then it 
fades, no crescendo.<br>
<br>
I emerge from a weekend with this record feeling as my parents did when 
they'd survived the blitz. Tattered and frayed round the edges and yet 
with a glow for man and womankind which might lead to dangerous 
excursions like embracing someone I've never met before. Springsteen and
 the E street Band have that quality of making you feel more alive – 
because, I'm convinced, you actually are more open and aware after 
allowing such music inside you. The River is as good as blood.<br>

<br>
Paolo Hewitt, Melody Maker, October 11 1980<br>
<br>
LISTENING to Bruce Springsteen's The River is like taking a trip through
 the rock 'n' roll heartland as you've never experienced it. It's a walk
 down all the streets, all the places, all the people and all the souls 
that rock has ever visited, excited, cried for and loved.<br>
<br>
The River is an unashamed celebration of rock music, all of it's 25 
years, and only Bruce Springsteen could have pulled it off with so much 
drama, panache and excitement.<br>
<br>
Two years ago with Darkness On The Edge Of Town, Springsteen kicked out 
with a vengeance most of his early romantic scenarios and characters, 
and looked with a cracking heart at man's lost soul and vitality; a 
vision exemplified best by the title track, a despairing, frightening 
scream for lost souls.<br>
<br>
With this, his fifth album in eight years, Springsteen's taken the hurt 
of Darkness, and the glory of Born To Run, and welded it into an 
exhilarating blend of rock that nods at all its sources, and then dances
 out of the speakers in blue jeans and smiles, sorrow and compassion in 
it's hands.<br>
<br>
It's the full realisation of Springsteen's talent; and on the fourth 
track into the album, 'Two Hearts', Springsteen gives full notice of his
 new found style.<br>
<br>
"Once I spent my time playing tough guy scenes," he hurls over a full 
blooded backing. "But I was living in a world of childish dreams. 
Someday these childish dreams must end/To become a man/and grow up to 
dream again/Now I believe in the end."<br>
<br>
Forever a romantic, some songs on this album betray Springsteen's 
indulgent muse – 'Ramrod', for instance; but at least he can acknowledge
 this weakness.<br>
<br>
It's also interesting to note that the songs with the most hurt and 
relevance were mainly written in 1979, while all the joyfully indulgent 
rockers came this year, maybe to counterbalance the cathartic emotions 
that Darkness had displayed.<br>
<br>
With the first track, Springsteen establishes the album's mood 
perfectly. A roll of drums, that classic rush of Springsteen sound the 
E-Street Band are so expert in creating, enhanced by the incredibly 
large, Spectorish production, and then Springsteen's despairing, yet 
warm vocals, warning us about the 'Ties That Bind'.<br>
<br>
"You're so afraid of being somebody's fool/Not walking tough baby, not 
walking cool/You walk cool but darlin' can you walk the line...and face 
the ties that bind".<br>
<br>
And later on...'I would rather feel the hurt inside, yes I would darlin'/Than know the emptiness your heart must hide".<br>
<br>
In other people's hands that would've been a condemnation. In Bruce's, it's pure compassion.<br>
<br>
'Sherry Darling' the next track up, is just classic rock 'n' roll: a 
swinging, dancing song punctuated by some great saxophone work courtesy 
of Clarence Clemons, and a good live feel, with Springsteen displaying a
 sense of humour. It's about his girlfriend's mother "yapping" in the 
back seat of his car.<br>
<br>
"Now Sherry my love for you is real," Bruce shouts. "But I didn't count on this package deal!"<br>
<br>
The next song, 'Jackson's Cage', is used as an effective metaphor for 
trapped people, forced to lose respect and dignity. As with most of the 
album the music is totally 'up', but the lyrics are emotional enough to 
make you cry.<br>
<br>
It's the last song on this opening side that breaks all the barriers and
 puts Bruce Sprinsteen into the league of greats. 'Independence Day' is 
going to mean a lot of things to a lot of people. The song concerns 
itself with the inevitable break of child from parent and is set to some
 of the most beautiful music I've ever heard.<br>
<br>
A haunting keyboard melody is picked up by a firm acoustic guitar, and 
then Springsteen's evocative vocals enter, addressing his father: "Well 
Papa go to bed now...it's getting late/Nothing we can say is gonna 
change anything now...there's a darkness in this town that's got us 
too/But they can't touch me now/And you can't touch me now/They ain't 
gonna do to me/What I watched them do to you."<br>
<br>
It perfectly sums up what Bruce Springsteen and his work is about: A 
respect for tradition as shown in his rock 'n' roll roots and music, but
 still that undeniable search for freedom and soul.<br>
<br>
It's one of the finest songs he's written, and demon's sax break is inspired.<br>
<br>
Over on side two, it's party time. 'Hungry Heart', with its drums so 
clean and loud, makes you notice the wide expansive production that 
allows each song to literally shake you by the heart and throat.<br>
<br>
'Out In The Street' is exactly that: a street song of work and youthful 
assertion. 'Crush On You' is pure dance music boosted by an infectious 
riff, some incredible slide guitar from Miami Steve Van Zandt, 
Springsteen's guitar sidekick. 'You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)'
 again displays humour as Springsteen takes Dirty Annie to a lover's 
rendezvous, sets the music low and then hears "a tapping on the window 
and a voice in the dark," saying...'You can look but you better not...'<br>
<br>
'I Wanna Marry You' slows the pace right down: it's a beautiful, 
touching song full of romance and concern, the only hitch being the 
touch of conservatism he brings in when talking about responsibilities 
and having a "home and family," as though he's Ronald Reagan's 
speechwriter.<br>
<br>
The title track finishes off the first album and again is classic 
Springsteen, though the actual music is reminiscent of Neil Young, with 
it's dark, potent, acoustic guitar offset by a bitter-sweet harmonica. 
Again it deals with the destruction of people, but this time with a 
remarkable sensuous edge, that's intimate to the point of hurt.<br>
<br>
"Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir/At nights on them banks I'd 
lie awake/And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take...Now 
those memories come back to haunt me."<br>
<br>
Love will tear us apart and the effect is devastating, the atmosphere perfectly set.<br>
<br>
'Point Blank', side three's opener is similarly breathtaking. To an 
almost jazzy intro (which strangely recalls the David Bowie of Alladin 
Sane), Springsteen is again restless and hurt as he watches a former 
lover give up her sense of life. There's an almost lazy feel to the 
song's introduction.<br>
<br>
With a lyrical genius for setting a time, a place and an atmosphere, 
Springsteen recalls an incredibly romantic incident of them dancing 
cheek to cheek, building to his anguished accusation that she's been 
shot "Point blank/right between the eyes".<br>
<br>
Then suddenly he's off again, to the scream of raucous guitars and 
crashing drums, to 'Cadillac Ranch', eulogising "James Dean in that 
Mercury '49" to the screech of blaring saxophones and pulsing bass 
lines.<br>
<br>
'I'm A Rocker' dances the same territory blowing its sentiments of rock 
'n' roll masculinity gone wild to such humorous proportions that it's 
impossible not to laugh at. "I got a 007 watch and it's a one and only/I
 got an I Spy beeper that tells me when you're lonely/I got a Batmobile 
so I can reach you in a fast shake..." It's not only funny, but an 
effective sideswipe at commercialism gone wrong.<br>
<br>
Next one up, 'Fade Away', is a lovely plea for failing and breaking 
relationship set to a backdrop of shining guitars and dominating organ 
work, while 'Stolen Car' is a tender drive through a man's broken heart,
 with Springsteen's understated reverbed guitar saying it all as it 
gracefully betrays the song's sentiments of fallen hope and love.<br>
<br>
'Ramrod' is basically a rock 'n' roll exercise for the E Street Band, 
and defiantly opens the final side. But even above its formulated 
settings, Springsteen's vocals sound a little weary and tired at 
repeating his undoubted love for the car and its potency in rock 
mythology.<br>
<br>
'Price You Pay' is yet another beautiful pop song, replete with aching 
chorus line. But the album's undoubted killer is the following track.<br>
<br>
'Drive All Night' is probably the best song Springsteen has ever 
written. It's over eight minutes of undiluted passion rolled into a song
 that tells what it's really like to be in love, and belongs up there 
with all the great rock 'n' roll love songs.<br>
<br>
Garry Tallent's bass, which has been on overdrive for most of the album,
 starts a slow heartbeat, before Roy Bitten's ethereal piano enters to 
set the scene for Springsteen's finest moment. The lyrics are simple, 
the sentiments as pure gold, and yet it's a song that puts shivers down 
your spine and into your soul.<br>
<br>
By the end Springsteen is screaming a scream that sets your heart on 
fire as he offers himself finally and fully to his chosen one. It nearly
 drove me to tears when I heard it.<br>
<br>
'Wreck On The Highway' takes the album to a touching end; and as with 
'Racing In The Streets', Springsteen leads the band into a tantalising 
melody that leaves the listener grabbing for side one again.<br>
<br>
So after two and a half years Springsteen delivers, and does it in a 
style that's breathtaking. The River fully encapsulates everything 
Springsteen has ever been about, which ultimately means the music, and 
he does it with a record that is the most vitally alive work I've heard 
this year.<br>
<br>
It's a full, panoramic screen of rock at it's most glorious and 
passionate; it's vanities, traditions, devices, pleas, humour and hopes 
are set triumphantly to a vibrant whirlwind of excitement, victory and 
defeat.<br>
<br>
It pleads for a better world, sees there's no hope for one, cries for 
that fact and then gloriously recreates it's own version. So nod your 
trilby to the musicians and producers who produced it, shake the hand of
 the small man with the guitar, and get to it.<br>

<br>
Ira Robbins, Trouser Press, January 1981<br>
<br>
A SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE sketch of a few seasons back poked fun at Roy 
Orbison by reducing him to a caricature: motionless stance and 
ever-present shades. With this overdue collection — given added weight 
by being a double album — Bruce Springsteen has proven himself to be 
equally typecast. Unable or unwilling to cast off the cliches of his 
past records, The River's attempt to Make a Statement is buried in an 
avalanche of repetition and evident lack of inspiration.<br>
<br>
Like a painter with a monochromatic palette, Springsteen is limited to 
working with his too-familiar "street" character. As a result, his 
undynamic new tracks lack both the urgency and clarity of past 
successes. Instead of impact or emotional urgency, Springsteen 
substitutes a ridiculous "party atmosphere." The River adds up to a 
water-treading exercise that neither upholds his standards of excellence
 nor explores any new avenues.<br>
<br>
Springsteen deservedly commands a lot of respect; despite all the 
drumbeating done on his behalf, nothing he's ever said or written would 
suggest he believes any of the messiah hype. His ethics, overall 
accessibility and commitment to maintain self-imposed standard are both 
rare and commendable. Now, if only the results were more interesting. 
Throughout his recording career, he's repeatedly done things that repel 
my sense of rock aesthetics and reduce his music to laughable bombast.<br>
<br>
Springsteen has two major stumbling blocks: stunningly bad vocals and 
perenially flawed lyrics. His wounded buffalo noises should be reserved 
for football grandstands. He also repeats lines mercilessly and meanders
 into a high register that is not his domain; the sound of his voice 
cracking and straining destroys any mood he might have built up (e.g., 
‘Drive All Night’: on side four). Lyrically, Springsteen is capable of 
powerful tableaus and stories, but he insists on tossing in his 
crutchwords — "night," "street," "darkness," "drive" — as if he were 
totally unable to imagine the sunlit world not moving along a 
thoroughfare. That sort of monomania might be okay for an entire album, 
but not a career.<br>
<br>
The River paints a bleak picture of the American dream gone sour: kids 
forced into marriage and adulthood; people disgusted with their lives 
and jobs; lovers and families who know they're doomed to grow apart. 
Everything is wrapped in automotive settings and metaphors that are 
tenuous at best. All Springsteen's songs are about those same dismal 
lives in one way or another, just as the highway metaphor runs through 
his work. Almost all The River's themes, in fact, could have been 
consolidated into one song.<br>
<br>
With a few exceptions, the album's music offers little excitement and 
less novelty, relying on fairly routine Springsteen moves. The songs can
 be classified as lightweight, uptempo party tunes with familiar phrases
 and Jukes-like joviality; slow, somber work-outs that sound (at worst) 
like Jackson Browne; and medium-tempo numbers in the vein of ‘Tenth 
Avenue Freezeout’ which work about half the time. Numbers that seem 
likely to survive include ‘Two Hearts’, ‘Independence Day’, ‘You Can 
Look (But You Better Not Touch)’, ‘Cadillac Ranch’, ‘Fade Away’ and ‘I'm
 a Rocker’. The remainder adds up to precious little, and all of side 
four is simply awful.<br>
<br>
The ultimate failure of The River lies with its language. When he 
started out Springsteen' songs were embarrassing fairy tales populated 
with foolishly named characters and crammed full of juvenile cleverness.
 By the time of Born to Run he had developed a knack for scene-setting 
and story-telling replete with poetic descriptions and insights. With 
each successive album it appears less likely that Springsteen will ever 
match those tales of urban lives and individual fortitude. For this 
outing, he's reduced to writing trivial nonsense in the guise of 
good-time rock 'n' roll on one hand and ponderous pomp on the other.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's reliance on a limited vocabulary points up his artistic 
limitations. Out of 20 tracks, 13 use "night"; nine use "street" and 
there are four with "highway" and two with "avenue"; "drive" turns up in
 10 songs, as does "heart." And these few words appear constantly 
throughout many of his previous songs as well. Repetitive language might
 be forgivable if the songs dealt with different subjects, but 
Springsteen just goes back over the same ground, neither refining nor 
elucidating — merely restating.<br>
<br>
All that said, I'm sincerely glad Springsteen exists. He's had a 
tremendous (and I think positive) effect on the rock community; fans, 
musicians and industry people have all been inspired by his work. His 
dedication, principles and heart have reawakened a lot of dormant 
enthusiasm among ex-rockers who thought themselves beyond the music's 
magic grip — and that's no mean feat. Disregarding overzealous fans and 
generally boring records, I respect Springsteen for proving you don't 
need to trade your soul for stardom (even if people try to do it for 
you). But that doesn't make The River a better record. It's a clear sign
 of a stagnant talent who can't or won't dig himself out of the mud. 
That's a shame.</div>

<br>
Greil Marcus, New West, February 1981<br>
<br>
LAST OCTOBER Bruce Springsteen released his fifth album, The River, 
which went swiftly to number one in the States, and began a tour that 
will take him and the E Street Band across the length and breadth of the
 United States, into Canada, to Great Britain, to Europe, Japan and 
Australia. As interesting as this event is its context.<br>
<br>
Rock’n’roll is, today, too big for any center. It is so big, in fact, 
that no single event – be it Springsteen’s tour or Sid Vicious’s 
overdose – can be much more than peripheral. Writing in August 1977, 
Lester Bangs may have got it right: "We will never again agree on 
anything as we agreed on Elvis."<br>
<br>
Rock’n’roll now has less an audience than a series of increasingly 
discrete audiences, and those various audiences ignore each other. With 
the exceptions of disco in the US and reggae in the UK, blacks and 
whites have not had so little to do with each other musically since the 
early’50s when rock’n’roll began – and those exceptions are linked to 
the emergence of hip racism in the US (many discos that play black music
 "discourage" the patronage of blacks) and of organized racism among 
youth in the UK. The audience that has gathered around punk and 
post-punk groups may have a grip on the formal history of the music – 
the account, as written by white critics, of the music’s pursuit of new 
forms and new ideas – but that pursuit has never had so little to do 
with what most rock consumers actually hear or, for that matter, what 
they’ve heard of.<br>
<br>
In one sense, this is salutary and inevitable. The lack of a center 
means the lack of a conventional definition of what rock’n’roll is, and 
that fosters novelty. Rules about what can go into a performance and, 
ultimately, about how and what it can communicate are not only enforced,
 they’re often invisible, both to performer and audience. That 
rock’n’roll has persisted for so long, and spread to such diverse 
places, precludes its possession by any single generation or society – 
and this leads not only to fragmentation but to a vital, renewing clash 
of values. We agreed on Elvis, after all, because he was the founder, 
because he represented the thing itself; if we will never agree on 
anyone as we agree on Elvis, it’s equally true that Americans have never
 agreed on anyone as they agreed on George Washington.<br>
<br>
But this state of affairs is also debilitating and dispiriting. The fact
 that the most adventurous music of the day seems to have taken up 
residence in the darker corners of the marketplace contradicts the idea 
of rock’n’roll as an aggressively popular culture that tears up 
boundaries of race, class, geography and (oh, yes) music. The belief 
that the mass audience can be reached and changed has – until now – been
 the deepest source of the music’s magic and power.<br>
<br>
The music does not now provide much evidence that this belief is based 
on anything like reality, and on a day-to-day basis this means there is 
no longer common ground for good rock’n’roll conversation. Bands with 
very broad – or at least very big – audiences continue to exist, of 
course, but they don’t destroy boundaries; they disguise them, purveying
 music characterized principally by emotional vapidity and social 
vagueness.<br>
<br>
<br>
*<br>
A CONCERT by Bruce Springsteen offers many thrills, and one is that he 
performs as if none of the above is true. The implicit promise of a 
Bruce Springsteen concert is that This Is What It’s All About – This Is 
The Rock. Whether the promise is more than a night’s happy illusion is, 
at the time, less important than whether Springsteen can live up to it.<br>
<br>
As songwriter, singer, guitarist and bandleader, he appears at once as 
the anointed successor to Elvis Presley and as an imposter who expects 
to be asked for his stage pass his show is, among other things, an 
argument about the nature of rock’n’roll after 25 years. The argument is
 that rock’n’roll is a means to fun that can acknowledge the most bitter
 defeats, that it has a coherent tradition which, when performed, will 
reveal possibilities of rock’n’roll the tradition did not previously 
contain.<br>
<br>
Having posited a tradition, Springsteen performs as if every bit of it 
is backing him up – rooting for him. This allows him to hit the boards 
as if his status as a rock’n’roll star is both privileged and ordinary, 
and the result onstage is a unique combination of authority and prank. 
It means that at his finest Springsteen can get away with almost 
anything, stuff that coming from anyone else would seem hopelessly corny
 and contrived – and that he can come up with stuff to get away with 
that most rockers since Little Richard would be embarrassed even to have
 thought of. Such as, in Portland, under the brooding eye of Mount St. 
Helens, singing ‘On Top Of Old Smokey’.<br>
<br>
Two nights later, on October 27 in Oakland, the best seat in the house –
 front row on the center aisle – was the prize of a small blonde woman, a
 33-year-old attorney from San Francisco named Louisa Jaskulski. She 
spent the first hour and a half of the concert dancing in front of her 
chair – nothing fancy, just the sweetest, most private sort of 
movements, the kind of dance one might do in front of a mirror. She was 
so expressive she seemed to add a dimension to every song, and early 
into the second half of the concert Springsteen responded in kind. He 
leaped from the stage and, with a gesture of gleeful courtliness, 
offered Jaskulski his arm, whereupon the two cakewalked up the aisle to 
the astonishment of everyone in the arena. This wasn’t Elvis bestowing a
 kiss on a lucky female, who then, according to the inescapable script, 
collapsed in tears like a successful supplicant at Lourdes; prancing 
down that aisle, Springsteen was not a star and Jaskulski was not a fan.
 They were a couple.<br>
<br>
An hour later Springsteen almost topped that moment. Introducing the 
band just before heading into ‘Rosalita’, he added a touch to his usual 
obeisance to Clarence Clemons, the enormous, splendidly decked-out black
 saxophone player: "King of the World...Master of the Universe... and...
 the Next President of the United States!" In two seconds it seemed like
 an obvious thing to do; one second before that it had been a shock so 
delicious it almost justified the presidential campaign which was then 
reaching its peak. Then, hard into ‘Rosalita’, Springsteen and the band 
reached that point when the song hangs in the air – when the pace is 
most fierce and the question of weather our hero well get the girl most 
in doubt. At the precise moment when the tension almost cracks the song 
in half, Springsteen turned to Clemons and kissed him square on the 
lips.<br>
<br>
On Halloween night in Los Angeles, fog covered the stage. Six crew 
members, dressed as ghouls, brought out a coffin. Springsteen emerged 
and sang ‘Haunted House’, a 1964 hit by a deservedly obscure rockabilly 
singer called Jumpin’ Gene Simmons. Don’t cringe – it could just as well
 have sung ‘Ding Dong, The Witch Is Dead’, a 1939 hit by The Munchkins.<br>
<br>
The night after Reagan’s election, in Phoenix, Springsteen did not 
introduce Clarence Clemons as the next president of the United States. 
Instead, he walked onstage and said, "I don’t know what you thought 
about what happened last night. I think it's terrifying." Then he sang 
‘Badlands’, the most appropriate song he had to offer – for the time 
being.<br>
<br>
As Jon Landau, now Springsteen’s manager, wrote in 1968, an awareness of
 the Vietnam War could be felt all through Bob Dylan’s John Wesley 
Harding; it is an almost certain bet that the songs Springsteen will now
 be writing will have something to do with the events of November 4. 
Those songs likely will not comment on those events; they will, I think,
 reflect those events back to us, fixing moods and telling stories that 
are, at present, out of reach.<br>
<br>
Not many rock’n’rollers can be expected to react on this level. If 
Springsteen is able to do so, it will be least in part because of his 
evident conviction that whether or not rock’n’roll has a center, someone
 must act as if it does.<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: A responsible rocker<br>
<br>
Richard Williams, Sunday Times, 31 May 1981<br>
<br>
Bob Dylan arrives in Britain next month hoping to repeat his triumphant 
series of concerts of three years ago. Many observers feel that his 
timing is unwise, for his performances will inevitably be compared with 
those of Bruce Springsteen, the American rock singer who finally opened 
his long-delayed London season at the Wembley Arena on Friday night. And
 no one, the feeling goes, can follow Springsteen.<br>
<br>
There is an irony here. When Springsteen erupted into the drab rock 
scene of the early Seventies, delivering sparkling visions of teenage 
nightlife inspired by his apprenticeship in the run-down, shoreline bars
 and clubs of his native New Jersey, he was dubbed "the new Dylan". It 
took him years to live down the tag.<br>
<br>
Nowadays, critics see in his music a synthesis of many of rock's 
greatest strengths: Presley's snarl, the romance of the Drifters, Phil 
Spector's grandiose mini-symphonies, the drive of the Rolling Stones and
 the social awareness of the punks. He is sometimes called the last 
great hero of rock and roll. His six-piece E Street Band, most of whom 
have been with him since the days on the Jersey shore, seem to be able 
to summon ghosts at will, but they also have their own distinctive and 
much-imitated sound.<br>
<br>
Springsteen is himself noted for a fanatical interest in early rock. His
 current bedtime reading is a paperback called Elvis – The Final Years. 
It is his homework: a case-history, he says, of how not to be a rock 
star.<br>
<br>
Four years ago, finding himself in Memphis, he tried to meet Presley. 
His method was typically straightforward, avoiding showbiz protocol: he 
jumped over Presley's garden fence. Within seconds, a prowling guard, 
who had never heard of Bruce Springsteen and who certainly did not 
believe that this disheveled kid could be a star, brusquely informed him
 that the King was in Las Vegas, and that he had better be on his way.<br>
<br>
Most people who are not rock fans remain, like that guard, unaware of 
Springsteen's existence. He is to be found neither on family TV shows 
nor in the gossip columns (although he appeared on the covers of both 
Time and Newsweekin a single memorable week back in 1975), and he has 
never had a hit single in Britain.<br>
<br>
He is, however, indisputable the biggest concert attraction in the 
world: in Britain, more than 300,000 people applied for 105,000 tickets,
 bringing him to the attention of the up-market touts who normally trade
 in Buckingham Palace garden parties and Finals Day at Wimbledon.<br>
<br>
His Wembley shows come in the middle of an 18-month world tour, with a 
total audience approaching 2,000,000. The next leg includes the 
inauguration of a new 20,000-seat stadium in New Jersey, where his song 
'Born to Run' has been adopted as the state's official anthem; on the 
strength of a single radio announcement, which included snatches of his 
music but didn't bother to mention his name, half-a-million applications
 were received within a couple of days.<br>
<br>
Harvey Goldsmith, Springsteen's British promoter, also handles Dylan and
 the Stones, so his assessment that the singer, "ranks up there at the 
top, which is amazing for a guy who's only been here once before" is 
perhaps muted by diplomacy. "You have to remember", Goldsmith continues 
in a tone of grateful astonishment, "that 99.9 per cent of these people 
have never seen him before."<br>
<br>
That is not quite accurate. About 5,000 people saw Springsteen's two 
London concerts in 1975, when his morale was dented by what he saw as 
over-zealous promotion by his record company, which coined the arrogant 
slogan: "Finally London is ready for Bruce Springsteen!" The singer and 
his band tore down as many of the posters as they could find, but the 
campaign became a standing joke in the music business. Springsteen felt 
that he was losing control of his career, and thought about giving it 
all up.<br>
<br>
"What my band and I are about is a sense of responsibility," he said 
last week, strolling along the Brighton sea-front several hours after 
concluding a typically exhausting concert. "If you accept it, that makes
 you responsible for everything that happens. People tend to blame 
circumstances, but in the end it's always your choice.<br>
<br>
"Take Elvis. He lost control. After a while, he even lost control of his
 own body. Starting in 1975, I had to fight a battle to regain control 
of what I do."<br>
<br>
The battle, which cut three years out of his professional life, was 
fought in a court-room, and ended with his manager being replaced by Jon
 Landau a former rock critic who had been giving Springsteen advice 
since wandering into one of his Boston performances.<br>
<br>
Springsteen returned to the public eye with a strong feeling that even 
the playing of rock and roll entails hard work and obligations. He 
responded in his songwriting by abandoning the bright-eyed style of his 
early music in favour of sombre images of small lives eked out in the 
margins of American society.<br>
<br>
He feels he should help his fans to avoid the trap which caught his 
father, and which he himself only just escaped. "My father was a pretty 
good pool-player, and not much else. When he was about the age I am now,
 he was offered a job with the telephone company, but he turned it down 
because it would have meant travelling away from his wife and kids. 
Years later, I realised how that missed opportunity had hurt him ever 
since. So I've always felt that if you're fortunate enough to be up 
there on stage, it's your responsibility to try and close the gap with 
the audience, to give them the sense that there are other possibilities,
 than the ones they may be seeing."<br>
<br>
For Springsteen, taking that responsibility means establishing an 
unusually intimate relationship with the audience. Given a stage low 
enough, he will leap into the middle of the throng, singing and playing 
guitar solos while hoisted high on his fans' shoulders. Post Lennon, not
 many rock stars would take such a risk.<br>
<br>
"It boils down," he said, "to a question of whether you trust people or 
not. I'm always inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt. I get 
roughed up sometimes, when people try to pull chunks out of me, but 
mostly it's okay."<br>
<br>
"It's vital to stay close to those people. I remember going to see bands
 when I was a kid, watching the musicians from real close up, studying 
the way they moved their hands, then going home and trying to copy them.
 Being in a band and playing music is what got me out of the trap of 
never realising my potential."<br>
<br>
Born to working class Irish-Italian parents in an insignificant town, 
Springsteen came up the hard way and has always been renowned for his 
insistence on giving value for money. Earlier this year, in America, his
 concerts were lasting a marathon four-and-half hours, and his intense 
physical effort led to the minor breakdown which forced the postponement
 of the European tour. Now the concerts are trimmed to a shade under 
three hours, which is still unusually substantial.<br>
<br>
He is small and hunched off-stage, a jockey with a lightweight boxer's 
muscles and he took the walk back to his hotel in the scuffed leather 
jacket, scruffy jeans and muddied boots he had worn on stage. His voice 
is hoarse, his speech slow and his thoughts introspective; in contrast 
to the eloquence of his song lyrics, he has a tendency to search 
doggedly for the right word or phrase, often without success.<br>
<br>
What unfailingly cheers him – to his manager's occasional despair – is a
 chance encounter with his fans. Whatever the hour and however pressing 
the engagement ahead, he will chat, sign autographs and pose for 
Instamatics.<br>
<br>
He feels he is only returning loyalty. Some fans cross continents to see
 him. Dan French, 23, worked for a London computer firm until he was 
made redundant last year. Now he produces a small photocopied fan 
magazine,Point Blank , titled after one of Springsteen's songs. He 
recently hitchhiked to concerts in Frankfurt, Munich and Paris, but he 
admits that even his devotion pales when compared with that of a trio of
 American girls who have followed the band around the entire European 
circuit for the past six weeks. "They're a bit of a legend on this 
tour," he says.<br>
<br>
What the fans may not realise is that, however, much they may spend on 
travel and tickets, they are all being heavily subsidised. Few rock 
tours make money nowadays, their cost being reckoned a promotional 
expense. This one, with its 45-strong entourage of musicians, managers 
and technicians, its relaxed schedule and long-distance telephone calls,
 will show a loss of about $1million.<br>
<br>
This is being underwritten, apparently without condition, by Bruce 
Springsteen's record company, CBS, whose corporate attitude is that of 
its managing director in Britain, David Betteridge. "Just by touring 
here," he says, "Bruce has doubled the sales of his current album. Once 
people have seen his concerts, they have to go out and buy his records. 
Fortunately, touring seems to be his lifeblood. Any other artist of his 
stature would have gone off to live on a ranch, Bruce just wants to 
work."<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: Brighton Centre<br>
<br>
Lynden Barber, Melody Maker, 6 June 1981<br>
<br>
TRYING TO WRITE about a Bruce Springsteen concert without reinforcing 
the man's reputation for scarcely believable stage performances is like 
trying to cross the Atlantic in a paper yacht. Do it and you're sunk.<br>
<br>
The simple fact is, when you see Springsteen for the first time any 
lingering doubts about the yards of superlatives that have been heaped 
on him over the years evaporate like ether.<br>
<br>
When Springsteen's up there on stage a lifetime's hopes, passions and 
frustrations explode in an uninhibited cry matched only by the sense of 
exhilaration and freedom a mountaineer must feel on reaching the summit.<br>
<br>
And if at times Springsteen strays too near the edge and stumbles down 
the slopes towards sentimentality, it's a mistake that's dwarfed by the 
magnitude of his overall achievement.<br>
<br>
I must confess my biases. When Born To Run came out in 1975 I used to 
literally rush home to play it, and I still regard it as my favourite 
rock album of all time. So when I heard the E Street band playing 
‘Backstreets’ – my favourite rock track of all time – at Brighton with a
 force that matched and even surpassed the intensity of the original, I 
was swept along on a tidal wave of overwhelming emotion.<br>
<br>
With The River, Springsteen seemed to have lost his touch, often 
descending into banality; most of the "rockers" appeared to be different
 versions of the same song, and tracks like ‘Sherry Darling’ and ‘Hungry
 Heart’ seemed lightweight in comparison with much of his earlier work.<br>
<br>
Since the concert I've realised that The River is not An Album in the 
same sense as Born To Run or Darkness On The Edge Of Town, but should be
 seen as a record that closely follows the dynamics of a live 
Springsteen show; an epic that balances the hedonistic joy of rock with 
the more complex exploration of the human emotions that characterised 
earlier songs like ‘Badlands’ and ‘The Promised Land’.<br>
<br>
But the songs are only part of the story. The recordings only hint at 
the power that the E Street Band achieve on stage; they begin with the 
kind of gut-force that most bands only begin to achieve at the end of 
set.<br>
<br>
And of course there's Bruce's famed athletic achievements on the 
floorboards, though the most surprising thing about watching him is how 
he refuses to fit the traditional mould of rock superstar as Demi-God, 
but rather melts down the barrier between artist and performer.<br>
<br>
Springsteen certainly doesn't look like a rock star – short and almost 
stocky, with none of the exaggerated sexuality of a Sting or a Jagger – 
and he wasn't perfect.<br>
<br>
Sometimes the clowning and hamming went too far, such as when two 
"doctors" tried to force him off stage on a stretcher near the end of 
the set (a short one by his standards, two and a half hours including 
two encores).<br>
<br>
Occasionally the heart-felt honesty strayed into slush territory, going 
too near to the over-the-top sentimentality of hard-core Country &amp; 
Western in the new song ‘Johnny Bye Bye’ (about Elvis Presley's death), 
and sounding uncomfortably close to the sickly John Denver on Woody 
Guthrie's ‘This Lands Is Your Land’ (although Denver would never include
 a line about "the streets of Brixton").<br>
<br>
But complaining too much about points like that would be like winning a 
Rolls Royce in a Kelloggs competition and moaning because the windscreen
 washers don't work.<br>
<br>
The sceptics among you are probably going to write this off as yet 
another predictable "over-the-top" Bruce Springsteen review, but the 
power of Bruce and the E Street Band on stage is enough to move even the
 emotionally crippled.<br>
<br>
Disbelieve at your own cost.</div>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: Born in The USA (CBS)*****<br>
<br>
Sandy Robertson, Sounds, 9 June 1984<br>
<br>
IT TOOK me a long time to get to feel comfortable with Bruce 
Springsteen's music and then, an album or so after I'd overcome the 
hype. I began to get just plain tired of his greatness being rammed down
 my gullet.<br>
<br>
I mean, a lot of the bloated double The River was like self-lampoon, 
while Nebraska was a good notion gone cold in the acoustic wasteland. 
From most other tykes these would have been acceptable records, but BS 
had his rep to live up to. Bleak?<br>
<br>
Blistering! If his twofer would've made a good single LP, and his solo 
set a neat 45, then Born In The USA is just exactly what it ought to be:
 a bloody, unbowed, magnificent album. The similarity of the title to 
the legendary Born To Run is no coincidence; but if Broooose is no 
longer innovating, at least he's polishing and perfecting his craft. If 
you let notions of 'classics' be replaced by objectivity then this might
 be the best Springsteen album ever.<br>
<br>
The title toon is a wildly declaimed, drum-punctuated rock anthem, and 
if it lacks the irony of a Chuck Berry geography lesson it's hardly a 
major fault in a blast this full of life. 'Cover Me', a raucous shuffle 
melodrama full of self-consciously 'hot' blueso licks, can't follow with
 much hope, but then nothing could – Springers has learned the art of 
pacing his albums.<br>
<br>
Lyrical analysis is out for me, mostly. In spite of a heavy rep in that 
department, I think most people hear this stuff as radio rock, 
car-motorvating music...and this is a pinnacle of that genre. Most of 
the tunes here could be covered by other artists, the way Beatles LPs 
used to be stripped within days of release by young hopefuls.<br>
<br>
Take 'Darlington County', f'rinstance, a glorious "shaaanahhlaahah" 
singalongaBruce rocker full of 'comin' of the Lord' zeal. It'll probably
 turn up on The Rock Gospel Show. And any one of those meowling and 
puking Stray Cats-type bands could do with the trad r'n'r of 'Working On
 The Highway', all punchy cajun organ alternating with lines about gals 
'n' retribution.<br>
<br>
There are moments of restraint, though. 'Downbound Train' is full of 
lonesome whines and empty beds and the fine melody simply drifts away 
where, in less sensitive paws, a brutal guitar finale would've been 
inserted like a pornographic shot stuck into a movie for the Jap market.
 Even more subtle is 'I'm On Fire', belying the title with a faint, 
fragile "ooooo-hoooh" howl.<br>
<br>
For me, however, Bruce and the E-Streeters have to be firing on all 
cylinders to involve my double-hemisphered walnut. Like 'Bobbie Jean', 
painfully nostalgic ecstasy with blurting sax from big Clarence; if it 
wasn't so darn great, it'd approach self-parody.<br>
<br>
Not so with 'Down Down Down', a hit single if ever I heard one: modern 
rock riff guitar, amazing drum sound...the title is the hook and the 
master is in complete control of his vocal abilities. This is the core 
that justifies most of the hype dumped on BS by his admirers. And 
there's still the fat keyboard-injected baseball story of 'Glory Days', 
the 'Dancing In The Dark' single and 'My Hometown', which hints at a '24
 Hours To Tulsa' start and then just fades (nicely) to grey.<br>
<br>
The album, when it lands in your shops, my sources tell me, should have a
 twelfth cut in addition to the ones on this sneaky advance 
schmexclusive tape I have. It's called 'No Surrender' (probably!), but 
even without it I can safely put my jewels on the railway tracks and say
 that Born In The USA is a killer-diller, a record that all but the most
 sullen outsiders will warm to as well as the diehards. 'Dancing In The 
Dark' shows it most: Bruce has been listening to the radio, and now he's
 made a record to fit there.<br>
<br>
Don't touch that dial!<br>

				<div class="content">Bruce Springsteen: Born In The USA (CBS)<br>
<br>
Charles Shaar Murray, NME, 4 August 1984<br>
<br>
IN BRUCE Springsteen's 1984, America – the original big country where 
dreams stay with you – has contracted; it is now a very small country 
indeed.<br>
<br>
The Great American Highway which Springsteen used to celebrate so 
feverishly now leads nowhere at all but to another place where things 
are no better. He no longer proclaims that there's magic in the night: 
the nights are plainly as dead as the days.<br>
<br>
From the cranked-up romanticism and defiance of Born To Run nearly ten 
years ago to the deadpan acoustic recital of defeats and disasters that 
made up 1982's Nebraska, Springsteen's chest-beating and myth-making has
 given way to a Reaganomic realism that is sobering rather than 
intoxicating.<br>
<br>
The title tune rings like a blow or a curse: Springsteen sings the whole
 song like a man on the edge of his tether and Max Winberg's snare 
cracks like a whip the length of a city; when he plays a roll it sounds 
like collapsing (old) buildings.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's protagonist is raised in a small town, gets into trouble, 
goes off to fight in Vietnam where his brother dies, comes home and 
can't find work. Dead end: "I'm ten years burning down the road/nowhere 
to run ain't got nowhere to go/Born in the USA/I was born in the USA..."
 The land of the free? Tell me about it. When he sneers: "I'm a cool 
rockin' daddy in the USA" you don't believe it any more than he does.<br>
<br>
It sets the tone for the whole album. No-one spits in the face of the 
badlands any longer: the badlands didn't even notice. The old cast of 
street rats and soulful gangsters made their rebillion back in Born To 
Run and Darkness At The Edge Of Town and it made no damn bit of 
difference at all.<br>
<br>
"Well maybe we could cut someplace of our own with these drums and these
 guitars," he remembers wearily in 'No Surrender', but the song – and 
album – has more to do with the question what do you do the morning 
after your final defeat?<br>
<br>
Springsteen's characters are married, in their mid-'30s and dealing with
 parenthood and recession. Maybe the narrator of 'My Hometown' is The 
Magic Rat ten years on from 'Jungleland' abandoning his dreams of moving
 out and moving on, initiating his own son into the same life-style that
 he once swore he would escape.<br>
<br>
There is refuge in love and the dance, but it is shortlived and hollow: 
the single 'Dancing In The Dark' (Springsteen's concession to nasty 
modern pop) is yearning but hollow: you know it won't work out. In 
'Cover Me' he blends Talking Heads proto-funk with minor-key blues and 
some wrenching Albert King-style guitar in an affecting plea for 
emotional security, but ultimately Born In The USA contains no easy 
answers.<br>
<br>
When one is this thoroughly caught up in the quicksand of society, there
 are only two escape routes: through what for want of a better term one 
might call mysticism or through the direct route of political action 
whereby you agitate, demonstrate and do everything you can think of to 
change the world around you and create a more life-enhancing 
environment. Springsteen's characters (and presumably Brucie himself) 
seem unprepared to take either route, which leaves them up to their 
necks in good ol' Amerikaka.<br>
<br>
No-one's going to get high on fantasy or rebellion from listening to 
Born In The USA. There are no moments of delirious abandon here; the 
music is as dry and contracted as the state of mind it describes.<br>
<br>
It is very rare to see an artist take a clearcut choice between selling 
his audience the same old bullshit that he knows they love, and telling 
them the truth even if it means letting go of stuff that sells.<br>
<br>
By abandoning all that 'rebel triumphant' blabber'n smoke, Bruce 
Springsteen displays the kind of moral and artistic integrity that rock 
music rarely shows any more. The power of Born In The USA is less flashy
 and less intoxicating, but it is far more real than the power of 
Springsteen's early work; this is the power of an artist telling the 
truth.</div>

				<div class="content">Springsteen: Scruff As Superstar<br>
<br>
Simon Frith, Observer, The, 1985<br>
<br>
IF BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN didn’t exist rock critics would have had to invent 
him – which, in a sense, they did. His manager, ex-journalist Jon 
Landau, the man who first described him as rock and roll’s future, is 
one of the few critics who put his money where his mouth was, and 
Springsteen has always been a critics’ cause, the clinching proof that 
rock could be what they claimed – humane, exciting and committed.<br>
<br>
As Springsteen has become more successful, the meaning of his success 
has become more intensely debated. Interestingly, the question is not 
how long can a millionaire superstar go on being treated as a New Jersey
 scruff. Springsteen’s image is so anti-glamour that, in a clever twist 
of the usual rock story, it’s difficult to think of him as a superstar. 
Few commentators, for example, have noted how much money he’s making 
from his European tour – as they certainly would for, say, the Rolling 
Stones.<br>
<br>
The issue is, rather, what Springsteen’s success means politically. In 
the right corner, Ronald Reagan, who last year claimed that the Born in 
the USA Springsteen was an example of what he wanted for Americans. In 
the left corner, Dave Marsh, Springsteen’s biographer and publisher of 
the influential American newsletter Rock’n’Roll Confidential, which 
assiduously documents Springsteen’s support of trade unions and places 
him in the collectivist tradition of American populism.<br>
<br>
From the latter perspective, Springsteen’s importance rests not so much 
on his songs of blue-collar plights and pleasures but on his performing 
ability to summon up solidarity – his live shows have always been the 
core of the Springsteen myth. The question that’s currently being 
debated then, is whether Springsteen’s ability to enter his fans’ lives 
can survive his commercially necessary move into stadia and football 
fields.<br>
<br>
On the evidence of his opening night in Newcastle on Tuesday, I’d say 
yes and no – Springsteen can humanize an open-air crowd better than any 
other rock performer I’ve seen, but he couldn’t completely surmount the 
distance and discomfort. This clearly worried him. Springsteen needs to 
feel his audience’s response and in Newcastle he worked very hard to get
 it, eschewing (thanks goodness) the alienating device of blowing-up 
video screens, throwing his phenomenal energy into every trick he’s ever
 learnt about crowd control.<br>
<br>
Maybe because he was having to work so hard for it, though, the secret 
of Springsteen’s success became a more intriguing question at Newcastle 
than ever. Why is this buoyant little man with his overflowing stock of 
familiar rock phrases so engaging?<br>
<br>
Part of the answer lies in his band, whose subtlety, timing and attack 
is so immaculate as to be taken for granted – only Nils Lofgren’s 
over-shrill guitar solos sounded an occasional false note. The E-Street 
Band aren’t a youth group, but a great house band, effortlessly 
underscoring every Springsteen point.<br>
<br>
And this may be Springsteen’s real secret – he’s best thought of as a 
brilliant playwright, a dramatic storyteller who’s most convincing 
invention is himself – the decent, dissatisfied, romantic worker (who, 
on stage, is always set off by the visual star of the show, Clarence 
Clemons, resplendent in pink and white suits). Springsteen’s 
introductions to his songs, drawing on his teenage myths and memories, 
the theatrical structure of his melodies, build up the portrait of a man
 who is honest about both his vulnerability and his strengths. He struts
 the stage like a bantam cock, looking for a fight then charming his way
 out of it. He’s a hero whose model of masculinity seems to be based 
less on James Dean, the usual source of male rock romance, than on James
 Cagney.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s real gift is his ability to pull his audience into his 
world, rather than, like most rock stars, displaying it to us as a 
spectacle. He can do this because he is a great singer – in the end, 
it’s the shape and sound of his voice that convince us he’s the 
character he says he is. The high points of the Newcastle show weren’t 
the rockers – they fragmented in the evening air as too-familiar stadium
 sounds – but the brooding songs, ‘The River’, ‘My Hometown’, ‘Racing in
 the Streets’, Springsteen’s voice cupping their regrets.<br>
<br>
As he finished his final encore, Springsteen wailed in imitation of 
James Brown: "I’m just a prisoner, I’m just a prisoner, I’m just a 
prisoner... of rock and roll!" James Brown himself was over here the 
weekend before with a show that, uncannily, suggested what Springsteen 
might mean. Brown, one of the greatest stage performers ever, comes 
across these days as a tourist attraction. And while he acted out the 
James Brown myth, his audience acted out the myth of the James Brown 
audience.<br>
<br>
This is the danger that Bruce Springsteen, rock and roll’s last, mythical superstar now faces.<br>
