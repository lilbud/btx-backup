<br>
By an Australian Vietnam Veteran</strong><br>
<br>
	<br>
On one unforgettable night in 1985 I met one of my heroes, Bruce 
Springsteen. How did that happen? Like so many events in my life, it’s a
 long story.<br>
 <br>
The story starts a decade earlier, in 1975. I was driving along 
Elizabeth Drive, past the market gardens west of Liverpool, in Sydney’s 
southwest. The car radio was on, but I wasn’t paying particularly close 
attention. Until, that is, a dramatic drum roll, a crashing guitar chord
 and a killer riff assaulted my ears and I had to pull over to the side 
of the road and listen. What followed was four minutes that encapsulated
 the very spirit of rock ‘n’ roll. It had girls, cars, escape, 
loneliness, desperation; it had crescendos, climaxes and dramatic 
pauses. It had everything. It was, of course, Bruce Springsteen’s Born 
to Run.<br>
 <br>
I was surprised when the announcer named Bruce Springsteen as the 
performer of this magnificent piece of rock ‘n’ roll. I was already 
aware of Springsteen’s reputation as “the New Dylan,” but was not yet 
aware that he was also being called “the future of rock ‘n’ roll.” At 
that time I was a frequent visitor to the Pact Folk Club in Sydney, 
where every Friday night at least one of the singers would perform a 
Springsteen song. So I had heard his songs performed with guitar and 
vocal, but not with a rock band. And I had not heard the man himself. 
The effect on me was as profound as the day about twelve years earlier 
when I heard Bob Dylan for the first time, having previously only heard 
other people doing Dylan songs. It was 1975, and I had been instantly 
transformed into a Bruce Springsteen fan.<br>
 <br>
Now we go back to 1985. Bruce Springsteen’s first tour of Australia is 
announced, and no Australian is more enthusiastically awaiting the 
opening of ticket sales than me. But my hopes would be dashed by a dirty
 trick played on Springsteen fans by his tour promoters. Another 
digression in the story will provide some background.<br>
 <br>
In 1985 I was national secretary of the Vietnam Veterans Association of 
Australia (VVAA). In its early years, the Association had encouraged 
Australian Vietnam veterans to become involved in the American Agent 
Orange class action. Although there was no certainty of success, this 
was the only option available at the time for Australian veterans to 
obtain any kind of compensation for illnesses caused by exposure to 
toxic chemicals in Vietnam. In this effort we were vigorously opposed by
 the dominant organization representing Australian veterans, the RSL.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now I return to the dirty trick played on Springsteen fans by those who 
organized his Australian tour. They decided to turn the demand for 
tickets into a promotion opportunity by announcing that tickets for the 
Sydney concerts would only be available at one ticket venue on one day. 
This forced anybody who wanted tickets to camp out at the ticket office 
for several days and nights in order to be sure of getting tickets. For 
the promoters, this meant great pictures in newspapers and on 
television. But for most Springsteen fans, with jobs and family 
responsibilities, it meant disappointment and anger. Those who were able
 to camp out for tickets would fall into two main categories. Firstly, 
younger fans who had only discovered Bruce Springsteen through the video
 clip of Dancing in the Dark, and secondly, scalpers who could hire 
people to camp out, and would then advertise tickets for sale at 
inflated prices in local newspapers. Longstanding fans like me would 
have to miss out, or pay the scalpers.<br>
 <br>
By sheer coincidence, the date announced for ticket sales for the Sydney
 concerts was the very day that Arthur Gietzelt arranged for the VVAA 
meeting in Canberra. So, even if it had been possible for me to camp 
outside the ticket office, I could not have done so. Once the Trust had 
been set up and time had taken the edge off my anger at Springsteen’s 
tour promoters, I thought about the relationship Springsteen had built 
up with American Vietnam veterans throughout his career, and I decided 
that I should at least try to make a connection with Australian Vietnam 
veterans while he was here. It helped that Springsteen’s record company 
was CBS, the same as Redgum, and I still had contacts within that 
company because of the close relationship between Redgum and the VVAA. 
Indeed, I still had a Redgum platinum record hanging in my living room. 
The VVAA had been invited to a platinum record presentation for Redgum’s
 live album, Caught in the Act, and the band and CBS surprised us by 
also presenting a platinum record to us. It was accepted by VVAA 
national president Phill Thompson, but at the subsequent party, Phill 
handed it to me and said “you’d better hang on to this. I might drink a 
bit tonight.” I took the platinum record home, and in the following 
months I reminded Phill on many occasions that I still had it, but he 
couldn’t think of a suitable place to hang it, so it stayed at home.<br>
<br>
I contacted CBS, told them about Bruce Springsteen’s high standing with 
Vietnam veterans in the US, and suggested that it might be a good idea 
for Bruce to meet Phill Thompson, as a representative of Australian 
Vietnam veterans, while he was in Sydney. At this stage I didn’t really 
have any concept of how or where the meeting might take place, but I 
just floated the idea, with no real confidence that it would happen. To 
my surprise, CBS called back and told me Springsteen’s touring manager 
had agreed that Bruce and Phill would meet, and that the meeting would 
take place backstage at one of the Sydney concerts. I should add that, 
unlike me, Phill was not a Springsteen fan. His taste was more 
mainstream pop. A couple of years earlier, I had driven Phill to 
Brisbane for a VVAA meeting, in his car, listening to his music. I 
remember the cassettes he kept playing over and over were The Best of 
Bread and an album by Bonnie Tyler, containing the song Total Eclipse of
 the Heart. I’m not knocking either of those choices, because David 
Gates of Bread is a fine songwriter, and Total Eclipse was one of those 
songs that cross all boundaries, and had become a mega-hit. But Phill 
didn’t really go for music with a hard edge. He did, of course, make an 
exception for Redgum.<br>
 <br>
On that Australian tour, a Bruce Springsteen concert lasted about four 
and a half hours, with an interval of about half an hour, when Bruce 
would have a massage to prepare him for the physical demands of the 
second half of the show. The arrangement was that Phill and his partner 
would attend one of the Sydney concerts, and during the interval they 
would be escorted backstage and meet Bruce in his dressing room. So I 
had missed out on tickets myself (unless I was willing to pay a 
scalper), but at least someone was going to meet Bruce on behalf of 
Australian Vietnam veterans.<br>
 <br>
This is where the story takes a dramatic turn. Phill Thompson was not a 
healthy man. He had recently been forced to have a radical ileostomy 
operation because of an inherited form of cancer that had already taken 
the lives of several male members of his family. He also suffered 
ongoing pain from his war wounds, and although it had not been 
diagnosed, after two tours of duty in Vietnam as a combat infantry 
soldier with 1RAR, it would be surprising if he did not suffer from 
PTSD. In addition, in the years that he had been running the VVAA case 
at the Agent Orange Royal Commission, Phill had developed a lifestyle 
that involved sleepless nights, during which he would keep in contact 
with scientists and veterans’ organizations in other time zones around 
the world. He would then try to grab a couple of hours of sleep in the 
morning or afternoon, depending on his diary requirements, while either 
the national treasurer, Tim McCombe, or I took care of the office. Phill
 often needed prescribed medication to get to sleep and to stay awake. A
 couple of days before the Bruce Springsteen concert, I tried to wake 
Phill at a prearranged time, after his afternoon sleep. I had great 
difficulty waking him, and when I did he was only semi-conscious. I 
couldn’t get him to tell me what pills he had taken, and in what 
quantity. I called Tim, and tried to keep Phill awake until he arrived. 
Then we called an ambulance, and Tim and I walked Phill around and 
around the office, trying to keep him awake until the ambulance arrived.
 Phill was admitted to Concord Repatriation Hospital that day, and kept 
in for several days. That is how the opportunity to meet Bruce 
Springsteen, on behalf of Australian Vietnam veterans, passed from Phill
 Thompson to me.<br>
 <br>
My partner at the time, Rosemary, had also been a Springsteen fan for 
ten years, so we both arrived at the concert bursting with excitement. 
By the time the first half of the show ended, it was clear that Bruce 
Springsteen and the E Street Band was one of the two best live rock ‘n’ 
roll acts I had ever seen, the other being The Clash. The interval came,
 and we were ushered backstage by a woman who was the manager of the 
Springsteen tour. We were told that I was one of three people, plus 
their spouses or partners, who had been invited backstage to meet Bruce 
on this night. One of the others was a radio disc jockey who was 
organizing Bruce and the band’s charity appearances in Sydney, and the 
third was Mel Gibson, who was there because Bruce Springsteen was a fan 
of the Mad Max movies.<br>
 <br>
There was a circle of chairs backstage, where the invited guests sat 
with members of the E Street Band, chatting while we waited to be called
 into Bruce’s dressing room. The saxophone player, Clarence “Big Man” 
Clemons wasn’t there, because, like Bruce, he had his own dressing room.
 To my left sat Rosemary, then Mel Gibson and his wife. To my right was 
the future Mrs. Springsteen, Patti Scialfa, and guitarist Nils Lofgren. 
They were very friendly, and told me they had been taken by surprise in 
the first half of the show when Bruce decided he wanted to sing Drive 
All Night, which had not been on the set list for years. Rosemary was 
rendered speechless by the proximity of Mel Gibson, and I hoped I 
wouldn’t suffer the same fate when called upon to speak to The Boss.<br>
 <br>
By the time we were called, Bruce was just coming out of his dressing 
room. When the tour manager introduced me as a representative of the 
VVAA, Bruce said “Alright, how ya doin’!” He shook my right hand, threw 
his left around my shoulder and gave me a hug. We chatted briefly about 
the situation of Vietnam veterans in Australia and America, and I 
thanked him, assuring him that anything he did for American veterans 
helped Australian veterans too, because of the public recognition it 
gave to our cause. I took off my VVAA badge and pinned it on his leather
 jacket, and he wore it throughout the second half of the show. He also 
started the second half with Shut out the Light, a song about a Vietnam 
veteran trying to adjust to life back in the world, which he dedicated 
to Australian Vietnam veterans in the audience.<br>
 <br>
When I think about my years as national secretary of the VVAA, my 
memories are mostly of constant struggle and occasional tragedy. The 
aims we worked and suffered for would only be achieved years and even 
decades later. That is why the memory of the night I met Bruce 
Springsteen stands out as my own personal highlight of those years, 
simply because it was an unequivocally exciting and happy experience.</div>

				<div class="content">Live Review: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band in Hartford, CT<br>
 <br>
Story by John Voket<br>
<br>
SoundSpike Contributor<br>
Published October 3, 2007 <br>
<br>
<br>
There are few American musical acts--or, for that matter, many 
rock-and-roll bands anywhere--that have matured as well as New Jersey's 
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. As the body of Springsteen's 
work grows, each progressive offering seems to take on its own ageless 
quality, drawing from rhythms, chord progressions, keyboard lines and 
guitar leads that often ring out with passing familiarity.<br>
<br>
But by the time The Boss puts his final lyrical stamps on each number, 
shakes and bakes them in rehearsal, and rolls them out for audience 
consumption, they become distinctive trademarks, unmistakable even to 
those claiming to not be fans. And what honest music lovers, 
particularly live music fans, could summarily reject Springsteen and 
company, especially if his Tuesday (10/2) tour opener in Hartford, CT, 
is any evidence of what he and his crew are still capable of delivering?<br>
<br>
Springsteen's often-blistering two-hour-plus set was heavy on new 
material from "Magic," his latest original recording with the E Street 
Band, which was released the day of the show. In fact, anyone who bought
 or downloaded the album earlier in the day heard all but three of the 
new numbers live a few hours later (see setlist below).<br>
<br>
Jammed in between the new material were some of the most inspiring tunes
 from 2002's "The Rising": "Lonesome Day," was dished up early and was 
nearly as well-received as the classic song "The Ties That Bind," which 
preceded it; "The Rising," which came mid-set; and "Waitin' on a Sunny 
Day" performed during the encore.<br>
<br>
Burning up those 11 tunes left precious little time for any nuggets for 
the long-time fans--many of whom SoundSpike spoke with--who came from 
distant states and even the UK, to catch Springsteen's tour opener at 
the Hartford Civic Center.<br>
<br>
The classic material that managed to find its way to the surface from 
deeper in The Boss' catalog did elicit the kind of roaring tribute one 
might expect, even though die-hard Springsteen concert-goers knew 
several of the songs to be all too frequent stand-bys, arguably 
overplayed a few years ago on the extended tour for "The Rising."<br>
<br>
Where "The Promised Land" and "Darkness On the Edge of Town" were about 
the most pedestrian of the show, "Night," into "She's the One," 
reaffirmed that this act is virtually impossible to beat for sheer 
vitality and inspired collaboration. "Darlington County" and the final 
encore number, the Irish Reel "American Land," were among the most 
spirited, while "Reason to Believe" was transformed into a chugging 
blues number.<br>
<br>
Although The Boss is quite adept at conducting the band with the 
slightest flick of his Fender Telecaster, "Reason to Believe" and "Gypsy
 Biker," in particular, showcased Springsteen's harmonica work and an 
emerging new stage presence utilizing that tiny instrument.<br>
<br>
He undoubtedly honed this aspect of his live act during the solo "Devils
 and Dust" and "The Seeger Sessions" tours, because the Hartford show 
saw Springsteen harping away like a veteran bluesman, putting his whole 
body into the wheezing and honking which in turn further energized both 
the band and the crowd.<br>
<br>
Springsteen's first new single, "Radio Nowhere," served as the show's 
opening number . And, while it sounds very fresh and young on the album,
 the live showcase gave The Boss an opportunity to crank up the song's 
inherent edginess even a few more notches.<br>
<br>
Among other live high points from "Magic" were the haunting "Devil's 
Arcade," while "Long Walk Home" and "Livin' in the Future" gave sax man 
Clarence Clemons two opportunities to really shine. "Born to Run" 
remained an encore highlight, during which all the house lights were 
fired up so the band could share in the exuberance with every member of 
the audience, from those singing along standing in front of the stage, 
to those dancing among the most far-flung cheap seats.<br>
<br>
As the tour moves across the country, those in attendance will likely 
look back on Springsteen's Hartford tour opener as the fan-filled love 
fest it was meant to be, a not-so-final stand that proved The Boss and 
The E Street Band are aging but not growing old.<br>
<br>
While the newest recorded material certainly can't compare to classics 
like "Born to Run" and "The River," it far outweighs a number of other 
Springsteen offerings, and deserves a chance to be heard in 
concert--even if it is at the expense of not trotting out a few more 
obscure classics from earlier days.<br>

Bruce Springsteen<br>
<br>
by Mark Moring <br>
<br>
Christianity Today International</strong><br>
 <br>
"Well, Jesus kissed his mother's hands / Whispered, 'Mother, still your 
tears / For remember the soul of the universe / Willed a world and it 
appeared.'" &amp;mdash; from "Jesus Was An Only Son"<br>
The first time I saw Bruce Springsteen in concert, 31 years ago in a 
small theater in Norfolk, Virginia, I might've called it a "religious 
experience." Springsteen and the E Street Band put on a 
4&amp;frac12;-hour show&amp;mdash;yes, four and a half 
hours&amp;mdash;that was part rock concert, part theater &amp;hellip; 
and all spectacle. I've seen The Boss 15 times since, and he is, in my 
opinion, the best live gig in the history of rock 'n' roll.<br>
<br>
Part of that is because of his personality. He's energetic, intelligent,
 funny&amp;mdash;and a great storyteller. I've often thought he'd make a
 terrific preacher&amp;mdash;if he ever got a firm grasp on the gospel. 
He's always included spiritual imagery in his songwriting. He seems to 
understand the concepts of sin, the cross, confession and redemption. 
And yet he often misses the mark theologically&amp;mdash;sometimes just 
barely, and sometimes almost blasphemously.<br>
<br>
With his new CD, Devils &amp; Dust, it would seem that the Rev. Mr. 
Springsteen has fully arrived, albeit in the guise of a folk singer. His
 most spiritual album to date&amp;mdash;eight of the 12 cuts include 
religious references&amp;mdash;Devils &amp; Dust is haunting and 
beautiful, chock full of songs of hope, love, and redemption as well as 
tales of sin, brokenness, and confession. Sounds an awful lot like the 
real world, eh?<br>
<br>
The album is Springsteen's third folk album, following 1982's brooding 
Nebraska and 1995's slightly more buoyant The Ghost of Tom Joad. But 
Devils &amp; Dust is easily the most melodic&amp;mdash;and 
upbeat&amp;mdash;of the three.<br>
<br>
The spiritual imagery begins right away with the title cut, which 
would've fit nicely with the haunting ballads of 1980's The River. The 
second verse begins, "I got God on my side." Like many of Springsteen's 
folk songs, including those here, "Devils &amp; Dust" isn't 
autobiographical, but a character sketch. Here, it's apparently a U.S. 
soldier in Iraq, who laments, "I got my finger on the trigger, but I 
don't know who to trust." And, "Fear's a dangerous thing / It can turn 
your heart black, you can trust / It'll take your God-filled soul / Fill
 it with devils and dust."<br>
<br>
Up next is "All the Way Home," a twangy rocker that reads like a 
confessional: "I know what it's like to have failed, baby / With the 
whole world lookin' on." Then another confession of sorts in "Reno," a 
somewhat explicit ballad about a tryst with a prostitute. And yet the 
song ends with the narrator saying the experience was hardly 
satisfying&amp;mdash;perhaps because of guilt?<br>
<br>
The next song, "Long Time Comin'," includes a Springsteen 
rarity&amp;mdash;a profanity. But it's in the context of regret and 
repentance as he&amp;mdash;or whoever the character is 
here&amp;mdash;vows to his family that he doesn't want to repeat the 
sins of past generations: "I ain't gonna (bleep) it up this time."<br>
<br>
The spiritual imagery&amp;mdash;some reverent, some 
not&amp;mdash;continues through "Black Cowboys" ("Ezekiel's valley of 
dry bones"), "Maria's Bed" (comparing a lover's bed to "the upper room" 
and "sweet salvation"), "Leah" ("Tonight I feel the light, I say the 
prayer / I open the door, I climb the stairs"), and several others.<br>
<br>
But nowhere is the imagery more powerful, or more reverent, than on 
"Jesus Was an Only Son," where the lyrics capture the CD's most 
prominent themes of faith and family&amp;mdash;in this case, the bond 
between mother and child. The song would have been perfect for last 
year's The Passion of the Christ: Songs, a multi-artist (P.O.D., Lauryn 
Hill, MxPx, Steven Curtis Chapman, and more) collection inspired by the 
film.<br>
<br>
Like Passion director Mel Gibson, Springsteen has Catholic roots and an 
appreciation for Marian imagery&amp;mdash;prevalent in the movie and in 
this song, where Springsteen paints Mary's relationship with Jesus with 
sweetness and light:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">As he walked up Calvary Hill<br>
His mother walking beside him<br>
In the path where his blood spilled<br>
Jesus was an only son<br>
In the hills of Nazareth<br>
As he lay reading the Psalms of David<br>
At his mother's feet</em><br>
<br>
The song ends with these words: "Well, Jesus kissed his mother's hands /
 Whispered, 'Mother, still your tears / For remember the soul of the 
universe / Willed a world and it appeared.'"<br>
<br>
The song is beautiful, and as reverent and worshipful as anything you'll
 hear on a Christian album. But make no mistake: Devils &amp; Dust is 
not a Christian album, nor would Springsteen claim as much. But he did 
tell The New York Times that the project is quite intentionally 
spiritual.<br>
<br>
"In every song on this record, somebody's in some spiritual struggle 
between the worst of themselves and the best of themselves, and 
everybody comes out in a slightly different place," he said. "That 
thread runs through the record, and it's what gives the record its 
grounding in the spirit."<br>
<br>
Springsteen also told the Times that although he's "not a churchgoer," 
his childhood experience in Catholic schools has made him realize, over 
time, "that my music is filled with Catholic imagery. It's not a 
negative thing. There was a powerful world of potent imagery that became
 alive and vital and vibrant. &amp;hellip; As I got older, I got less 
defensive about it. I thought, I've inherited this particular landscape 
and I can build it into something of my own."<br>
<br>
And so he does, as well as he ever has, with Devils &amp; Dust.</div>

Songs of the new Oakies<br>
<br>
The Ghost of Tim Joad<br>
by Bruce Springsteen</strong><br>
<br>
During his last US concert tour, Bruce Springsteen--who took his first 
steps toward superstardom by earning a reputation for performing sweat 
drenched marathon concerts--not only discouraged the audience from 
dancing in the aisles but asked them to keep quiet.<br>
<br>
'A lot of these songs were written with a lot of silence, and they need 
silence to work,' Springsteen told a crowd in Los Angeles. 'So if you 
like singing and clapping along, please don't.'<br>
<br>
Springsteen's sombre mood was in keeping with his new album, The Ghost 
of Tom Joad, a mostly acoustic record that bears witness to the misery 
and desperation of America's have-nots. Springsteen has travelled down 
this road before but not in a long time--and never with such a sharp 
understanding of who loses out in US society and what the losers have in
 common.<br>
The Tom Joad of the album's title is the main character in John 
Steinbeck's famous novel of the 1930s Great Depression, The Grapes of 
Wrath, about a family driven from their farm in Oklahoma and forced to 
live in poverty in the migrant labour camps of California.<br>
<br>
Now, 56 years later Springsteen tells the story of a new generation of 
'Oakies' who face the same exploitation and discrimination:<br>
<br>
'<em class="text-italics">Shelter line stretching around the corner, <br>
Welcome to the new world order.<br>
Families sleepin' in their cars in the Southwest. <br>
No home, no job, no peace, no rest.'</em><br>
<br>
After the title track Springsteen starts out in familiar territory with a
 pair of songs about characters who, stripped of their hopes, get caught
 on the wrong side of the law--and the magnificent 'Youngstown', a 
bitter tale of the collapse of a steel town:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">'These mills, they built the tanks and bombs <br>
That won this country's wars. <br>
We sent our sons to Korea and Vietnam, <br>
Now we're wondering what they were dyin' for.'</em><br>
<br>
But the heart of this album is the next trio of songs about America's 
new 'Oakies' in the most literal sense--illegal immigrants from Latin 
America struggling to survive in the same California fields that Tom 
Joad and his family worked.<br>
In 'Sinaloa Cowboys' two undocumented workers from Mexico learn the 
truth of their father's warning--'Everything the North gives, it exacts a
 price in return'--when they end up as assembly line workers for drug 
dealers in the deadly process of mixing methamphetamine.<br>
<br>
'Balboa Park' tells the story of another illegal who scrapes by as a 
drug courier and male prostitute. Run down by a car during an 
Immigration and Naturalisation Service raid, he dies in his 'home' 
beneath a highway underpass.<br>
In between these songs is 'The Line', the story of a US soldier turned 
border patrol officer who learns that 'hunger is a powerful thing' and 
lets a Mexican woman and her family cross the border to an uncertain 
future searching for work in California's central valley.<br>
<br>
The Ghost of Tom Joad is a grim album--Springsteen refuses to sugarcoat 
any aspect of the nightmares he describes. The moments when his 
characters overcome the forces that oppress and divide them are few and 
on a tiny scale--as when the border patrol officer looks the other way 
in 'The Line' or in 'Galveston Bay' when a native born worker, spurred 
on by Ku Klux Klan organising, sets out to kill a rival immigrant shrimp
 fisherman but turns away at the last moment.<br>
<br>
Still, two hopeful themes echo through the album. One is Springsteen's 
insistent reference to the common experiences of the characters in his 
songs, whether they are native born or immigrants, Latino or white. This
 recognition of workers' shared interests, regardless of race or 
nationality, is especially welcome amid the current tide of immigrant 
bashing by US politicians, Republican and Democrat alike, who want to 
pit workers against one another.<br>
<br>
The other image that haunts this album is the ghost of Tom Joad. On the 
title track Springsteen sets to music the famous scene from the 
Steinbeck novel in which Tom, radicalised by his experience in the 
migrant camps, says farewell to his mother and sets out to fight for a 
better world:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">'Wherever there's somebody fightin' for a place to stand <br>
Or a decent job or a helpin' hand,<br>
Wherever somebody's strugglin' to be free, <br>
Look in their eyes, Mom, I'll be there.'</em><br>
<br>
It is this commitment to the struggle for change that Springsteen's 
characters are 'waitin' on'--as are all of America's have-nots.</div>

<br>
Lucky Town<br>
<br>
John Cruz</strong><br>
<br>
Having enjoyed incredible success in the decade of the 80's and not 
doing so bad in the 70's either, at the beginning of the 90's Bruce 
Springsteen was nonetheless an artist very much in search of himself. 
Having suffered a divorce a half decade earlier and chronicling the most
 intimate sides of romantic relationships on the late '87 release Tunnel
 Of Love, Bruce was now remarried, reborn, and rejuvenated after what 
for all intents and purposes were the most difficult and confusing years
 of his life. Having seen great fame and fortune laid before him, yet 
with great personal heartache and loss coming at the same time, 
Springsteen would find himself in a joyous and confessional mood at the 
turn of what would be a somewhat quiet decade for him musically 
speaking. Breaking up his marriage, breaking up his long time well 
regarded band, breaking away from New Jersey, and finding a new life for
 himself of family, children, and laying down roots now seemed priority 
number one to this sometimes puzzling American artist. But those things 
did not come without a price or a journey attached. Intent on moving on 
at all cost, Bruce Springsteen needed to rebuild his life. And like many
 songwriters, musicians, and artist, he needed to express and 
communicate his story to others. Lucky Town, Bruce's ninth studio album 
and most personal recording to date, is where he laid it all bare.<br>
<br>
Beginning with the starting life again and optimistic "Better Days" 
which chronicles Bruce's recent loves and losses and eventual 
redemption, it's a loud and celebratory track that catches Bruce feeling
 good and moving forward in song and spirit. Moving quickly to the 
twangy title cut that finds the songwriter in search of better times and
 shedding his old skin, and then to the playful and knowing hometown 
song "Local Hero", and the album is off to a good if uneven start, as 
these rock songs are more then decent material, but not really the true 
heart of the album. Jubilant as they are.<br>
<br>
Next song is where the album really begins with a promise of commitment 
and devotion to his new love in the tender and heartfelt ballad "If I 
Should Fall Behind". "Each lovers steps fall so differently/I'll wait 
for you/And should I fall behind/Wait for me" Bruce sings, wearing his 
heart squarely on his sleeve. And these confessions of romantic desire 
continue on the very next track in the spirited and soulful"Leap Of 
Faith". "You were the Red Sea/I was Moses/I kissed you and slipped into a
 bed of roses/Your waters parted blood rushed inside/I was Jesus son, 
sanctified" Bruce sings at his poetic best. And it all works to a 
musical and lyrical tee.<br>
<br>
The second half of the record begins on a darker tone with the ominous 
cautionary tale "The Big Muddy", which finds Bruce breaking out slide 
guitar and a very foreboding bass sound. A song with a twangy swamp like
 flavor, it sounds exactly as it's title suggest. Murky, muddy, and 
somewhat adrift. Moving from here to one of the more successful cuts on 
the album with the inspirational and emotional song of faith restored 
"Living Proof" where the songwriter chronicles his journey through 
heartbreak, loss, loneliness, fear, and the low places he found himself 
in as a result until finally coming out kicking and screaming on the 
otherside, "Living Proof" is as good a straight forward rock song 
Springsteen has ever recorded. "You do some sad sad things/When it's you
 you're trying to lose/You do some sad and hurtful things/I've seen 
living proof" Bruce wails as the music pounds it all home. And it works 
brilliantly. <br>
<br>
Finishing up the record we are treated to yet another song of romantic 
commitment to his new wife in the thoughtful and quiet ballad "Book Of 
Dreams", a song about the uselessness of unnecessary death in "Souls Of 
The Departed" (perhaps the most uneven track on the record) and the 
stunning and beautiful "My Beautiful Reward". Again finding himself 
regretful of his past sins and in search of relief and redemption, this 
is as revealing a song as Bruce has ever written about his own losses, 
struggles, and pain in life, and it offers another fascinating glimpse 
into the mind and heart of the songwriter just as several of the songs 
that have come before. Simply one of his best songs of the past twenty 
odd years.<br>
<br>
Lucky Town is an unusual album for Bruce. Written in three weeks time 
and recorded by Bruce alone (he plays all instruments except piano and 
drums where noted) in just as many, it was an afterthought of sorts that
 came to be only after he had his next official album , the more 
commercial and pop "Human Touch", already in the can. Perhaps not saying
 all he had to say on that album or simply not being able to say it 
until other stuff was taken care of, Lucky Town feels a bit rushed, a 
little uneven from start to finish, and underproduced and developed in 
places. But for all it's shortcomings it has just as many strengths that
 help it rise above a small personal album and reach the heights of a 
very good LP. Mature, forgiving, confessional, and the sign of a rebirth
 for this artist that continues to this day, it offers a unique glimpse 
into this man who was once born to run but who was now settling down and
 learning to live with himself, his new life, and his recently troubled 
past. And it's about as up close and personal as he has ever gotten on 
record. Certainly worth a listen, download, or purchase if you are even 
remotely interested in true, heartfelt recordings of any kind.</div>

Olympic Stadium, Seville, <br>
May 13, 2012<br>
<br>
The Daily Telegraph</strong><br>
<br>
When you see an act of Bruce Springsteen's vintage (it's 39 years since 
his debut album, Greetings From Asbury Park, NJ), you want to hear the 
big hits, the classics; the prospect of having to endure newer, less 
familiar material rarely appeals. Except that, in the case of 
Springsteen's latest tour, which kicked off its European leg in Seville 
last night, the new stuff easily stood comparison with old favourites 
such as Born to Run, Dancing in the Dark and Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out.<br>
Wrecking Ball - his 17th studio album, released in February - is one of 
Springsteen's finest. And, as he and the E Street Band ploughed through 
eight of the 11 tracks on the CD, a wildly enthusiastic Spanish crowd 
roared their approval. And sang along, too.<br>
<br>
Typically for Springsteen, whose blue-collar credentials remain intact 
despite the enormous wealth that success has bestowed on him, Wrecking 
Ball is about the injustices suffered by disadvantaged fellow Americans 
("The banker man grows fat/Working man grows thin" he laments on Jack of
 All Trades); but also evident is an indefatigable pride in his country 
and a deep-seated optimism, too: "Tomorrow there'll be sunshine/And all 
this darkness past" (Land of Hope and Dreams).<br>
The arenas of the world might not seem a natural home for a modern-day 
protest singer, but Springsteen, aka The Boss, is also one of the 
greatest showmen in rock and roll. The sound is big, but the feeling is 
intimate even when, as in Seville last night, there are upwards of 
20,000 guests at the party, plus quite a crowd on stage, too: the E 
Street Band, who have backed Springsteen since the early days, have been
 augmented for this tour by an array of backing singers, accordion-, 
fiddle- and horn-players to the point where there are now 17 musicians 
on stage.<br>
<br>
So there was a lot going on, yet, throughout, Springsteen strove to get 
as close as he could to the audience. He didn't attempt any 
crowd-surfing, as he had during recent American dates, but he repeatedly
 leapt from the stage to venture into the seething, sweating melee of 
bodies (the temperature had hit 39 degrees earlier in the day and was 
still stifling).<br>
<br>
On two occasions, he pulled youngsters up on stage. First, a Spanish 
girl of about 10 sang solo during Waitin' on a Sunny Day: she was 
word-perfect and in tune. Later, he smooched with another young girl 
during Dancing in the Dark: she had thick cotton-wool plugs in her ears.<br>
<br>
Musical highlights included Because the Night (a hit for Patti Smith, 
who co-wrote it, in 1978), from its haunting piano intro, played by Roy 
Bittan, to an astonishingly frenetic solo by elfin guitarist Nils 
Lofgren; the roaring adrenaline rush of Candy's Room, powered by Max 
Weinberg's thunderous drums, was terrific, too.<br>
After three hours, and well past midnight, the closer was Tenth Avenue 
Freeze-Out. Halfway through, the music suddenly stopped and the vast 
video screens that flanked the stage were filled with images of "the Big
 Man" Clarence Clemons, saxophonist and mainstay of the E Street Band, 
who died last year. It was a stunning climax to a night of high energy 
and heartfelt emotion.</div>

AAP Reuters<br>
<br>
By Erik Kirschbaum<br>
BERLIN  Jul 15, 2008 </strong><br>
<br>
(Reuters) - When Bruce Springsteen spoke out against the Berlin Wall at 
the biggest concert in East German history in 1988, no one in the crowd 
of 160,000 had the faintest idea that the symbol of the Cold War would 
soon be history.<br>
<br>
But now -- 20 years after the American rock star went behind the Iron 
Curtain -- organizers, historians and people who witnessed it say his 
message came at a critical juncture in German history in the run-up to 
the Wall's collapse.<br>
<br>
It was not the only show that summer with political fallout. In June, a 
concert for Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday in London was beamed to 
millions worldwide. Two years later he was freed from an apartheid jail 
and later elected South Africa president.<br>
<br>
Such concerts for a cause remain part of the summer music calendar, even if their impact is diluted in the internet age.<br>
<br>
Springsteen, an influential songwriter and singer whose lyrics are often
 about people struggling, got permission at long last to perform in East
 Berlin in 1988.<br>
<br>
Even though his songs are full of emotion and politics, East Germany had
 welcomed him as a "hero of the working class". The Communists may have 
unwittingly created an evening that did more to change East Germany than
 Woodstock did to the United States.<br>
<br>
Annoyed at the billing "Concert for Nicaragua" that Communist East 
German leaders stamped on his July 19 performance, Springsteen stopped 
halfway through the three-hour show for a short speech -- in heavily 
accented German:<br>
<br>
"I want to tell you I'm not here for or against any government," 
Springsteen said, as he pointedly introduced his rendition of the Bob 
Dylan ballad "Chimes of Freedom".<br>
<br>
"I came to play rock 'n' roll for you East Berliners in the hope that one day all the barriers will be torn down."<br>
<br>
The words fed the discontent building in East Germany and added to a 
restless mood in the country severed from the West after World War Two 
-- and especially in the city split by the Wall, built during the 
darkest hours of the Cold War in 1961.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">TASTE OF FREEDOM</strong><br>
<br>
The East German organizer told Reuters hardline leaders only reluctantly
 endorsed the plan by the Communist party's FDJ youth group to let 
Springsteen in. It was an era of change sparked by the "perestroika" 
reforms of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.<br>
<br>
"It obviously wasn't easy and we had to fight hard to get permission but
 we eventually succeeded," Roland Claus, an ex-FDJ leader and now a 
member of parliament, said in an interview. East German hardliners were 
skeptical of Gorbachev.<br>
<br>
"The higher-ups understood that rock music was international and if East
 Germany wanted to do something to improve the lot of young people, we'd
 have to try it," he said. "We were proud we got him and had great hopes
 it'd help modernize East Germany."<br>
<br>
Instead, the open-air concert at a cycling arena only seemed to make 
East Germans long more for the freedoms that Springsteen sang and spoke 
about in a show also broadcast on TV and radio.<br>
<br>
"We were interested in opening the country up," said Claus, 53. "No one 
thought the Wall would be gone a year later. Anyone in the East or West 
who said that would have been considered insane. It was a great concert 
with a special atmosphere."<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">AMERICANS IN BERLIN</strong><br>
<br>
Other Americans had spoken out against the Wall in Berlin.<br>
<br>
But both presidents John F. Kennedy in 1963 ("Ich bin ein Berliner") and
 Ronald Reagan in 1987 ("Tear down this Wall") gave their addresses in 
West Berlin.<br>
<br>
Springsteen delivered his words in the heart of East Berlin, where 
Communist East Germany had long portrayed the United States as a 
decadent and belligerent "class enemy".<br>
<br>
"Springsteen's concert and speech certainly contributed in a larger 
sense to the events leading up to the fall of the Wall," said Gerd 
Dietrich, a historian at Berlin's Humboldt University.<br>
<br>
"It was a paradoxical situation. Before Springsteen, the FDJ had always 
cursed Western rock artists like Springsteen. And then all of a sudden 
they were welcoming him. It looked like they were caving in to the 
shifting values of young people."<br>
<br>
Dietrich, 63, said Communist party hopes that a small taste of 
Springsteen might pacify youths backfired. There was even a positive 
advance review in the Neues Deutschland daily: "He attacks social wrongs
 and injustices in his homeland."<br>
<br>
"But it didn't work out as planned," Dietrich said. "It made people 
eager for change. The organizers wanted to demonstrate their openness. 
But Springsteen aroused a greater interest in the West. It showed people
 how locked up they really were."<br>
<br>
Cherno Jobatey, now a well-known German TV anchorman, was another 
witness to the East Berlin Springsteen concert, writing about it as a 
young reporter for the West Germany weekly Die Zeit under a headline 
"Born in the DDR".<br>
<br>
He wrote Springsteen had longed to put on a concert in East Berlin since
 he paid a visit there in 1981. Jobatey described a rowdy mood 
beforehand -- surprising in a country where security police clampdowns 
were usually quick and ruthless.<br>
<br>
Jobatey, 42, reported the crowd erupted when Springsteen called for "the
 barriers" to be torn down. "There was thunderous applause from the 
crowd endorsing that proposal," he wrote.<br>
<br>
Jobatey told Reuters recently it was hard to know if Springsteen had 
helped set in motion the chain of events leading to the Berlin Wall's 
fall 16 months later. But he said it was a magical evening just before 
the upheaval gained momentum.<br>
<br>
"The music was great and he showed people a different experience, a 
different way life, a different world," Jobatey said. "There was an 
incredible vibe to it all. It was an amazing thing to experience in the 
middle of East Berlin."<br>
<br>
He said the concert probably affected East Germany more thoroughly than the 1969 Woodstock Festival did America.<br>
<br>
"People didn't want to leave when it was over," he said. "The police 
gave up after a while. I walked back across town for about two hours and
 everywhere everyone was happy and on a real high. But it didn't feel 
like a revolution, just yet anyhow."<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">COMMUNIST BOSSES GET SCARED</strong><br>
<br>
Claus, who organized the concert, acknowledged there was some chaos -- 
remarkable in a country with such an omniscient and oppressive security 
apparatus -- as 160,000 people arrived at a venue with a 120,000 
capacity; 100,000 tickets were sold.<br>
<br>
"We had to take down all the crush barriers, gates and fences to the 
concert because so many people showed up," he said. "We had to resort to
 the best instrument we had: anarchy."<br>
<br>
After Springsteen there were many other Western artists eager to come 
despite modest fees -- Springsteen tickets were 20 East German marks (or
 about $1).<br>
<br>
"Word of the huge crowd and great enthusiasm in East Berlin spread," 
Claus said. "A lot of international stars wanted to come after that. I 
spent a lot of time working on plans for a U2 concert in East Berlin 
that we wanted to do in August 1989."<br>
<br>
But the U2 concert never happened. By that point thousands of East 
Germans were streaming out of the country to the West, the final act 
that led to the Berlin Wall's opening on November 9.<br>
<br>
"I was trying to organise a parallel East-West concert with U2 in East 
Berlin and Duran Duran in West Berlin," Claus said. "But I couldn't get 
approval anymore from the higher-ups. They were too afraid. There was so
 much turmoil by that point."<br>

By: Elvis Australia<br>
<br>
September 1, 2003 </strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen was seven when he first saw Elvis on The Ed Sullivan Show.<br>
<br>
Elvis Presley's third and final appearance took place on January 6, 
1957. On that Sunday night in 1957, Elvis smiled, smirked and played 
with the audience. Breaking from his usual attire, Presley came out 
wearing a bloused shirt and vest, with makeup painted around his eyes. 
That night Elvis sang hits like Don't Be Cruel, Love Me Tender, and 
Hound Dog, shaking his hips and standing on his toes while girls 
screamed in the audience. And that guitar: it was a weapon and it was 
armor. This was the dream.<br>
<br>
Watching the show, Springsteen felt mesmerized: 'I couldn’t imagine 
anyone not wanting to be Elvis Presley', he recalled. His mother 
eventually bought him a guitar and even set up lessons, but 
Springsteen’s hands were too small. He didn’t like structured 
instruction, and he put the instrument aside for sports.<br>
<br>
Throughout the years that Elvis lived at Graceland the front gate area 
was a place fans enjoyed being. There was the chance that he might drive
 through in one of his cars or on a motorcycle, or ride down on a golf 
cart or on horseback and have an impromptu autograph session. They could
 also watch him and his friends ride their horses and golf carts around 
the grounds. Even when Elvis out of town, it was fun to be at the gates,
 getting to know the guards (some of whom were Elvis' relatives) and 
meeting other fans from around the nation and the world. When Elvis was 
away, sometimes the guards would let fans onto the grounds for photos, 
sometimes even driving them up to the front of the house. There was a 
sense of warmth, welcome and camaraderie. Actually, some lifelong 
friendships between Elvis fans began at the Graceland gates.<br>
While, in general, things tended to be calm enough around here, it 
wasn't all that uncommon for fans and curiosity-seekers to climb over 
the stone wall or wood fence on a dare or, more often, with the 
heartfelt hope of seeing Elvis. The security staff had more than one 
occasion to politely escort uninvited guests off the grounds, sometimes 
having to summon them down from the trees. On one occasion Elvis 
happened upon a couple of mischievous young guys who had jumped the 
fence and were taking a swim. Elvis is said to have nonchalantly 
suggested that they be careful, then went on about his business. Once, 
an enterprising fellow actually made his way into the house and was 
found sitting in the den waiting for Elvis, hoping to interest him in 
some songs he had written, but he didn't get to have that meeting.<br>
<br>
The most famous incident of wall jumping occurred one night in 1976. 
Bruce Springsteen, who was enjoying the first rush of great fame and had
 just played Memphis on his Born to Run tour, decided to catch a cab to 
Graceland. Noticing a light on up at the house, he climbed the wall and 
ran to the front door. As he was about to knock, Security interceded. He
 recalls asking, 'Is Elvis home?'. Answer: 'No, Elvis isn't home, he's 
in Lake Tahoe'. (It was true.) Springsteen attempted to impress the 
guards by telling all about his being a recording star and his having 
recently made the covers of Time and Newsweek, as he was politely 
escorted to the street.<br>
<br>
(Perhaps they didn't believe him or hadn't heard of him yet.)<br>
Years later in a concert, he told the story and commented: 'Later on, I 
used to wonder what I would have said if I had knocked on the door and 
if Elvis had come to the door. Because it really wasn't Elvis I was 
goin' to see, but it was like he came along and whispered some dream in 
everybody's ear and somehow we all dreamed it. And maybe that's why 
we're here tonight, I don't know. I remember later when a friend of mine
 called to tell me that he'd died. It was so hard to understand how 
somebody whose music came in and took away so many people's loneliness 
and gave so many people a reason and a sense of all the possibilities of
 living could have in the end died so tragically. And I guess when 
you're alone, you ain't nothin' but alone. So anyway, I'd like to do 
this song for yous tonight, wishing you all the longest life with best 
of absolutely everything'.<br>
<br>
In Bruce's opinion Elvis' real comeback occurred in 1972 with the 
release of 'Burning Love'. 'That's when the jockeys woke up and found 
out that Elvis could still rock with the best of them'.<br>
  <br>
For those who don't know, the legend goes that Bruce and pal Steve Van 
Zandt caught Elvis' May 28, 1977 performance in Philadelphia. As Bruce 
later discretely recalled, 'It was not a good night'.<br>
<br>
He apparently went home and wrote Fire as a salve for his sadness. It is
 unconfirmed if a demo was ever sent from manager Jon Landau to Presley 
management, producer Felton Jarvis, or Graceland, but the song is 
clearly a superb homage to the great early sixties recordings Presley 
made, in particular Suspicion and His Latest Flame. In other words, it 
was an instant classic. After Elvis died Bruce gave the demo to 
rockabilly singer Robert Gordon, who cut it in New York in December 1977
 with Link Wray on lead guitar and Bruce himself playing 
(uncredited-at-the-time) piano. Somehow, the Pointer Sisters got a hold 
of the track and recorded a more R&amp;B styled version which made #2 on
 the pop charts in 1979. Elvis, of course, had loved their recording of 
Fairytale, cutting it in Hollywood in 1975. There's a little music 
circle for you!<br>
Here are the lyrics. With that sinuous, sexy bass line running 
underneath, Elvis could have kicked ass with this tune. Maybe even hit 
#1 on the charts. Oh, if wishes were moonbeams.</div>

Magic<br>
Columbia<br>
By Stephen M. Deusner<br>
<br>
October 3, 2007</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen occupies a unique place in American popular culture. 
He doesn't have the cachet that Bob Dylan has, yet he's much more 
approachable-- populist in practice, not just in theory. He has inspired
 pale imitators (Tom Petty, John Mellencamp), but has no peers to speak 
of. Unlike similar 1980s supercelebrities Prince or Madonna, he remains 
artistically viable and culturally relevant two decades after the height
 of his popularity. In the 1970s, he was never hip, but in the 2000s he 
has gained a considerable following among indie rock bands like the Hold
 Steady, the Killers, and the National, among many others. Because his 
music has lost none of its triumphant rock'n'roll kick-- no matter how 
many times you hear it, "Born to Run" always kills-- he has become today
 what Brian Wilson was 10 years ago: the indie ideal.<br>
<br>
And yet, his popularity extends far beyond the indie realm. His 
mainstream audience remains fanatically loyal, making him one of the few
 artists that both you and your boss enjoy. Springsteen's success 
continues despite the constantly shifting ground that finds him on one 
side of certain cultural and political lines, then on another. His 2002 
album The Rising was received as a post-9/11 salve, a paean to American 
resilience in the face of tragedy: The same people who died or lost 
loved ones in the attacks-- cops, firefighters, corporate grunts, their 
wives, husbands, families-- were said to be the very same people who 
inhabited Springsteen's earlier songs, now facing hard, cold reality. So
 it's forgivable if many heard the album they believed the country 
needed instead of the one Springsteen actually made.<br>
<br>
Despite the nickname, the Boss has never inhabited his iconic status 
comfortably. Devils &amp; Dust followed The Rising in 2005, trading the E
 Street Band's full sound for acoustic contemplation and spinning a much
 grimmer version of America that was full of unrealized dreams and 
insoluble injustices. We Shall Overcome, his album of Pete Seeger covers
 and his best late-career album, proved much subtler in its 
subversiveness, communicating an anti-establishment stance through 
decades-old tunes. That's nothing new for him: The E Street Band's 
enormous, exuberant rock'n'roll has always hidden darker currents of 
American realism, most famously on "Born in the U.S.A.", a song about 
disillusioned Vietnam vets that was hilariously co-opted by Ronald 
Reagan's 1984 presidential campaign as a theme song.<br>
<br>
That's the secret power of Magic, Springsteen's 15th album in 34 years: 
The album hides its raw disillusionment deep within the music, mingling 
it with a weary optimism and a thoroughly committed lustiness that have 
not diminished with age. The result is a surprisingly complex album that
 recalls The River in its heartfelt populism, Darkness on the Edge of 
Town in its small-town scope, and Tunnel of Love in its mature take on 
love and sex. On "I'll Work for Your Love", which could be a cover of an
 outtake from the first half of The River, he tells a woman he's 
"counting the bones in your back like the stations of the cross"-- a 
concise fusion of the sexual and the spiritual. Where he once chronicled
 youthful abandon in the face of life's possibility, now his subject is 
the wonders of middle-aged contentment, as if he can't believe his own 
luck. It's a surprisingly durable subject, one that fits his outsize 
sound perfectly.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, Springsteen's prickly angst makes songs like "Last to
 Die" and "You'll Be Comin' Down" sound like challenges to, rather than 
platitudes for, regular Joes. On second single "Long Walk Home", he 
considers the small(-town) satisfaction of having distinctive local 
landmarks and knowing everyone you pass on the street. That such 
pleasures are slowly dying makes the song both a romanticizing ode to an
 American ideal that may never have existed as well as a clear-headed 
lament that we no longer yearn for those securities. "You know that flag
 flying over the courthouse means certain things are set in stone," he 
sings, "who we are, what we'll do and what we won't."<br>
<br>
If Magic revisits the subject matter of previous career crests, it 
unfortunately recalls The Rising in its sound: Brendan O'Brien returns 
to the producer's seat, once again shuffling most of the E Street Band 
to the music's margins and focusing his attention squarely on the Boss. 
In addition to drenching slower songs like "Your Own Worst Enemy" and 
"Devil's Arcade" in melodramatic and totally unnecessary strings, the 
producer too often glosses over the creaks and wear in Springsteen's 
voice-- like air-brushing a model's face to look younger-- when it's the
 imperfections that give him his particular authority. Springsteen 
should sound more like Tom Waits, less like 3 Doors Down.<br>
<br>
But then there are the songs that get everything exactly right, like the
 gorgeous "Girls in Their Summer Clothes" and "Livin' in the Future". On
 the latter, the E Street Band are given freer rein to revive and even 
update the boardwalk strut and namesake shuffle of their early days. 
Clarence Clemons' sax is integral to the modified doo-wop groove, 
drummer Max Weinberg swings easily, guitarists Steve Van Zandt and Nils 
Lofgren trade out licks, and Patti Scialfa's tender vocals echo 
Springsteen's excited performance. While he doesn't have the youthful 
eye for detail and narrative he once had, Springsteen's more concise 
songwriting style allows for some nice observations and surprisingly 
playful comparisons. "Then just about sundown, you come walkin' through 
town," he sings on "Livin' in the Future", "your boot heels clicking 
like the barrel of a pistol spinning 'round." He-- and the E Street 
Band-- actually sound hungry and, yes, just a little pissed off. It's an
 angry song, with a rumbling undercurrent of dread ("Woke up Election 
Day, sky's gunpowder and shades of gray"), but damn if it doesn't sound 
awesome when you're speeding down a back road with the windows rolled 
down.</div>

<br>
<br>
BACKSTREETS MAGAZINE – BY MIKE SAUNDERS – 1998</strong><br>
<br>
A question by Ulf Ellestrom on Lucky Town Digest regarding the 1976/1977
 Miami Horns attracted my attention. I regularly write about Bruce and 
Southside for the UK fanzine The Ties That Bind and for the past 12 
years I’ve researched the history of the Asbury Jukes to exhaustion, 
particularly the 1975-1978 period and the links to Bruce, Miami Steve 
and the E Streeters.<br>
<br>
I’ve been lucky enough to interview Southside at length on a couple of 
occasions and have put together a highly detailed Jukes Family Tree, 
listing just about everybody who has ever played with the band from 1975
 to the present day, including, of course, a million horn players. I’d 
now like to contribute my interpretation of events, which I believe to 
be the most accurate. For the record, YES there were two sets of Miami 
Horns operating during the period in question (one with Bruce, the other
 with Southside), and NO they weren’t the players listed in the 
Backstreets book.<br>
<br>
In January 1976, Miami Steve Van Zandt came off the Born To Run tour and
 set about finding a record deal for the Asbury Jukes, who had just 
begun their second year as house band at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park. 
Although a full-time E Streeter since the previous July, he continued to
 lead a double life as singer, guitarist, songwriter, manager and 
(soon-to-be) producer and arranger for the band, which he and Southside 
had co-founded in the early part of 1975.<br>
<br>
At the time, the Jukes horn section consisted of just one permanent 
member – sax player Carlo Novi. “We tried gettin’ horn players, they’d 
come and go, we could never get the ones we wanted,” Southside told me 
in 1991. A bunch of high school kids were subsequently drafted in to 
provide horn accompaniment for the recording of a four-song demo tape 
which was then circulated to record companies. “They were scared to 
death. Steven was great with them. He taught ‘em all the parts, they 
wrote it all out and they did the best they could.”<br>
<br>
Before too long, a verbal agreement was reached with Epic, but with the 
finalising of contracts likely to take several weeks, and with producer 
Miami Steve committed to another E Street Band tour from March 25, the 
band somehow scraped together enough cash to finance the recording of 
their debut album I Don’t Want To Go Home by themselves, once again 
using a bunch of hired hands as a temporary horn section, namely Deacon 
Earl Gardner and Rick Gazda on trumpets, Bob Malach and Bill Zacagni on 
saxes and Louis Parente on trombone – the first incarnation of the Miami
 Horns.<br>
<br>
On May 30, the Jukes celebrated the imminent release of I Don’t Want To 
Go Home with a famous showcase gig at the Stone Pony. Broadcast live on 
nine radio stations in the northeast, the concert featured guest 
appearances by Ronnie Spector, Lee Dorsey, Bruce, Miami Steve and 
various members of the E Street Band. By this time, a permanent Asbury 
Jukes horn section had been formed, comprising Carlo Novi (sax) Ed 
Manion (sax), Tony Palligrossi (trumpet) and Rick Gazda (trumpet). They 
eventually grew into a five-piece with the arrival of charismatic 
trombone player Richie “La Bamba” Rosenberg in November.<br>
<br>
In the summer of 1976, the Asbury Jukes ended their Stone Pony residency
 and began to tour nationally. In July, they performed at the CBS 
convention in Los Angeles, where Bruce (clean-shaven and largely 
unrecognised) joined them onstage for a version of I Don’t Want To Go 
Home. Shortly afterwards, Southside picked up a throat virus which 
rendered him temporarily speechless and caused the cancellation of 
numerous Jukes live appearances, including their New York City debut at 
the Bottom Line, which was rescheduled for October.<br>
<br>
With Southside and the band temporarily off the road, Bruce borrowed the
 Novi/Manion/Palligrossi/Gazda Miami Horns for his shows at the Monmouth
 Arts Center in Red Bank on August 1-3 and 5-7 1976, and presumably also
 for his gig at the Palace Theater in Waterbury, Connecticut on August 
21. However, by the time Bruce began his fall tour in Phoenix, Arizona 
on September 26, Southside was fully recovered, the Jukes had resumed 
their punishing 200-gigs-a-year schedule, and an entirely separate Miami
 Horns had been formed to accompany the E Street Band on the road. 
During an interview with Richard Neer of WNEW-FM in New York on November
 6, shortly after the tour ended, Bruce confirmed “yeah, the Miami Horns
 played with us in Red Bank [but] these cats are from Philly, [they're] 
friends of the Asbury Jukes horn section.”<br>
<br>
Researchers for the Backstreets book family tree and concert listings 
probably referred to the liner notes of I Don’t Want To Go Home and 
assumed that the Gardner/Gazda/Malach/Zacagni/Parente Miami Horns played
 with both the Asbury Jukes and the E Street Band in 1976 and 1977. It’s
 an understandable mistake to make, but this is not the case.<br>
<br>
With the exception of Rick Gazda (who later joined the Jukes on a 
full-time basis), this particular collection of Miami Horns went their 
separate ways in March 1976 once the backing tracks for the album had 
been laid down, although Bob Malach briefly returned a year later to 
play a solo on the second Jukes album, This Time It’s For Real.<br>
<br>
Because Bruce’s nightly band introductions only referred to them 
collectively as the Miami Horns, the identities of these cats from 
Philly remained a mystery. Also, because they only appeared onstage for a
 handful of songs at each show, photographs which include both band and 
horn section are comparatively rare. The few that I have seen from this 
period (in back issues of Creem and Melody Maker among others) confirm 
that the E Street Miami Horns consisted of one sax, one trombone and two
 trumpet players. This corresponds exactly with the March 1977 Boston 
Evening Globe review mentioned by Ulf Ellestrom which identified the 
musicians as Ed De Palma (sax), Dennis Orlock (trombone), John Binkley 
(trumpet) and Steve Paraczky (trumpet). While it’s entirely possible 
that the 1977 horn section differed partly or completely from the 1976 
line-up, I feel it’s reasonably safe to assume that these four guys 
accompanied the E Street Band on both tours.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, if anybody out there can shed further light on this 
subject, I’d love to hear from you, particularly if you’re a 
horn-playing thirtysomething high school graduate or if your surname is 
Gardner, Malach, Zacagni, Parente, De Palma, Orlock, Benkley or 
Paraczky!<br>

John Cruz <br>
<br>
October 1st, 2007</strong> <br>
<br>
Summary: Bruce Springsteen And The E Street Band return after five years
 with Magic. Nothing up their sleeves, just great rock n roll.<br>
<br>
When we last heard from Bruce Springsteen And The E Street Band five 
years ago the group had just recorded their second album together in 
nearly 20 years, the 9/11 inspired The Rising. A fine effort full of 
good songs and strong performances, the album put Bruce Springsteen and 
his legendary group of backing players back on the map not as a band 
recapturing past glories as was sometimes suggested of their 1999 
reunion tour, but as a vital and creative rock n roll unit once more. 
But as great as The Rising was, the question remained: After 20 years 
apart who were Bruce Springsteen And The E Street Band outside of a 
recent reunion tour and the shadow of an album dealing with death, 
grief, loss, and crisis of faith? <br>
<br>
Springsteen's new album Magic kicks off with a rock radio ready single 
that only begins to answer that question, and things quickly get clearer
 from that point on. Radio Nowhere is an energetic rocker with a strong 
resemblance to the old Tommy Tutone hit Jenny (867-5309), and while 
Bruce may have unintentionally borrowed the riff, the similarities stop 
there. Radio Nowhere dispels any pop notions for a desperate tale of 
desolation and a hard driving rock sound that recalls Bruce's late 70's –
 early '80's work, and is an exciting single to start off the album. So,
 are we getting Born In The USA, Pt.2? Is this what the Springsteen 
faithful have waited two decades for? A modern rock record with a big 
beat and a look back on past glories?.<br>
<br>
Not a chance.<br>
<br>
Once again produced by alternative / modern rock producer Brenden 'O 
Brien whom Bruce employed for The Rising in 2002 (using an “outside” 
producer for the first time) Magic is nothing short of what its title 
might suggest. After the opening rock number the album quickly shifts to
 something perhaps unexpected at this point in Springsteen's career and a
 considerable risk, at that. It harkens way back to early Springsteen. 
He of the romantic visions, whimsical melodies, grand pop songs, and 
fiery R&amp;B you can find scattered about on his first three albums. 
And it stands well alongside any classic Springsteen record you can 
mention.<br>
<br>
Which is not to say this is a work of nostalgia by any means. Rather it 
is an album of modern sounds and pleasant surprises, the first of which 
comes early on as the band moves from the raucous Radio Nowhere to the 
smooth Byrds influenced pop of You'll Be Coming Down. Full of lush vocal
 harmonies set against long time Springsteen sax man Clarence Clemons 
outstanding horn playing, the song sounds bland and misplaced put after 
such a spirited start. And it was a song I considered filler after a few
 listens. However after a few more I just couldn't get it out of my 
head.<br>
<br>
Magic is a very “catchy” album. The soulful sax of Living In The Future 
coupled with Bruce's funky guitar work and keyboardist Danny Federci's 
glockenspiel recalls the Born To Run R&amp;B of Tenth Avenue Freeze Out.
 And I'll Work For Your Love features a whimsical lead in piano 
reminiscent of many Bruce songs past. But as said before, this is not a 
work of nostalgia. Bruce Springsteen has always been an artist who draws
 on the very history of rock n roll, and the styles explored on Magic 
are neither unique to him or music. But done this well from the writing 
to the performances to the recording itself is a little rare in music. 
This is a truly superb and mature work by one of rock's all time great 
artist, devoid of pretense, self consciousness, or the shallow rock 
trappings of the day. This album flows and is an easy and entertaining 
listen from start to finish. <br>
<br>
Brenden 'O Brien must be given much credit here, also. With Springsteen 
albums being primarily self produced efforts up until his collaboration 
with 'O Brien on The Rising, it could be argued the sound of Bruce's 
music was becoming dated and perhaps a bit too obvious. O' Brien has 
changed that, working with The E Street Band to deepen their sound and 
exploit their musical strengths. Always solid, dynamic, and exciting 
players, 'O Brien has refined and freshened the E Street sound, bringing
 textures, instrumentation, and arrangements to the group which were 
absent on past efforts. And he has smoothed out the rough edges on the 
rockers, as well.<br>
<br>
Of those rockers, well, Radio Nowhere is about as wild as this album 
gets. So don't get your hopes up for some fist pumping Glory Days twang 
and thump. Of the three other straight up rock tracks on the album, 
Bruce and band play them with cool, measured energy and swing, never 
overwhelming the songs or giving in to histrionics. Gypsy Biker, which 
serves as the center of the album, is restrained and thoughtful, the 
tale of a veteran coming home in a body bag and the lives left behind. 
However Bruce's lyrics are vague and poetic here, letting you take what 
you wish from the song emotionally if not quite literally. And Last To 
Die, while being more obvious in its lyrics (Who'll be the last to die 
for our mistake / The wise men all were fools / What to do?) nonetheless
 moves along with the same grace the rest of the album manages thanks to
 the musical aplomb of Bruce and his terrific band.<br>
<br>
Big surprises? Not really, but with an album this strong we don't need 
any. The Phil Spector pop sound and style of Your Own Worst Enemy with 
its tubular bells, orchestration, lush backing vocals, and yes, kettle 
drums, finds Bruce crooning, his voice literally soaring into the 
heavens at songs end. Likewise the breezy Beach Boys inspired sounds of 
Girls In Their Summer Clothes is something perhaps surprising at this 
point in Bruce's career, but only in the sense that you weren't 
expecting it. When asked recently what this album was about, what was 
its theme, Bruce simply answered “It's The Byrds, The Beach Boys, a 
California album.” That it is. But its also an album that lyrically 
threads human loss and dislocation throughout, and the politics that 
sometimes go with. And its this common thread that not only pulls the 
record together tight, but lends it some weight, as well. California and
 parts near and far could use more albums like this.... <br>
<br>
At 58 Bruce Springsteen is supposed to be going quietly into the night, 
maybe doing his solo acoustic tours or an oldies act. Sixty year old men
 do not rock like this. Not Jagger, not Townshend, not Young. Nor do 
they make albums which take most everything they have ever done in their
 career and slam it onto a 12 song disc that isn't embarrassing, over 
hyped, or fodder for the “over forty and still ROCKIN” classic rock 
crowd. But Bruce Springsteen And The E Street Band have done just that 
and more with Magic. And they have rarely done it better.</div>

Nebraska<br>
<br>
By John Cruz</strong> <br>
<br>
Summary: Springsteen hits the road looking for inspiration and finds a 
country lost and adrift five years after Vietnam and on the verge of 
Reaganomics. Muderous, cold, and bleak, Nebraska captures the pain and 
turns it into timeless songs for the ages. Essential<br>
<br>
<br>
And its a demo tape. "A demo tape," you say? Well yes, a demo tape. 
Number 224 on Rolling Stone Magazines top 500 albums of all time is a 
demo tape. How could this be, you may be thinking? Well, as with many 
great things (or at least some great things) sometimes greatness is 
accidental and unexpected. You never see it coming. Bruce Springsteen's 
Nebraska is just like that.<br>
<br>
Part of the collection of songs originally written for the album that 
would eventually become Born In The USA, the songs of Nebraska are 
orphans that couldn't quite find a home or fit in elsewhere. Trying the 
songs out with The E Street Band initially only to realize they weren't 
suited well to the full band treatment, Bruce was looking for a mood 
with these songs. Thing was he had already captured it and he knew it. 
The whole thing was in the back pocket of his jeans on a $5 cassette 
tape that was recorded in his basement. The question was how to 
duplicate it.<br>
<br>
Going into the studio once more only this time alone, he then set out to
 simply record the songs in a proper studio with the proper equipment 
and deliver an album of acoustic songs to the record company. But given 
the studio treatment the album lost it's dark edge and foreboding tone 
of the original to the point that the songwriter felt the songs lost 
their impact. Merely a copy of an original. Frustrated, his manager and 
close friend Jon Landau suggested he simply turn in the expected record 
just as it is. Straight from his back pocket. And so Nebraska was 
finally born.<br>
<br>
A dark folk album of sorts, the title track kicks things off and it's 
clear from the start this is not going to be typical Springsteen fare. 
While not a complete departure for the singer and songwriter, it's bleak
 lyrics of a murderous man on a killing spree and his girlfriend who 
goes along just for the ride is nonetheless as unforgiving a song as 
Bruce had ever recorded up to this point. The music is very quiet here, 
as it is on much of the album, letting the story be put front and center
 and providing no easy out for the listener. It's a chilling tale that 
provides no easy answers to it's troublesome subject matter or for the 
characters involved, and its a theme Springsteen would touch on again 
and again throughout the record. The next cut, "Atlantic City", livens 
things up a little musically, adding touches of mandolin and 
glockenspiel to the mix and allowing a little hope to seep into it's 
desperate tale of financial ruin, dreams gone bad, and romantic 
commitment, while the song that follows, the tender and reflective 
"Mansion On The Hill" lulls the listener into a comfortable position 
with it's tale of childhood dreams and soft, compassionate vocals. But 
while this album does have brief moments of hope and reason to believe 
in something, most tracks resemble the next two songs on the record, and
 they go a long way in establishing exactly what the songwriters 
intentions are regarding this album. Johhny 99, with it's train whistle 
vocal intro and nervous guitar whip things up into a near frenzy with 
it's tight story of a man on the verge of losing everything and turned 
to a life of crime, and the cinematic "Highway Patrolman". Just under 
six minutes in length, Highway Patrolman is as fully realized a story 
song as Bruce has ever written. "My name is Joe Roberts/I work for the 
state/I'm a sergeant out of Burnsville, Barracks #8/ I always did an 
honest job/As honest as I could/I got a brother named Frankie/And 
Frankie ain't no good" the song starts. And from that point on the 
listener is simply compelled to see it through. Ultimately a song of 
brotherly love and family commitment at any and all cost, Springteen 
weaves a story as elaborate and fully realized as any Hollywood 
screenwriter would be hard pressed to pack into a full length film over 
the course of this six minute song, and its quiet, thoughtful music and 
compassionate vocals are careful to never get in the way of the words or
 tale. Quite simply songwriting and musical storytelling at its very 
best.<br>
<br>
Continuing down this bleak path for the second half of the record, 
"State Trooper" picks up where Highway Patrolman left off (with Sargeant
 Joe Roberts letting his no good brother's taillights disappear into the
 distance after a pursuit) and puts us right into the car with Frankie. 
"License, registration / I ain't got none / But I got a clear conscience
 / About what I've done" our thief in the night professes. The entire 
song has a low, desperate sound and feeling to it, Springsteen's guitar 
reduced to a muted riff and his shadowy vocals leading the way. And if 
the listener needs to be told what all the trouble on this record is 
about you can find it here and in these lyrics: "Maybe you got a kid 
/Maybe you got a pretty wife/The only thing I got/Been bothering me my 
whole life" Bruce sings matter of factly into the mic, and thats as 
close to an explanation we get so far as giving rhyme or reason for 
these people falling over the edge and past the point of return. And it 
is indeed this matter of fact treatment that gives these songs weight 
and substance. This is the way things are, the songwriter seems to say. 
There is nothing to question or query. Its just life. And life can be 
dirty.<br>
<br>
Softening the desperate blows once again heading toward the close of the
 album however, "Used Cars" gives us a tale of simple childhood dreams 
in the same vein as Mansion On The Hill did earlier on the album, and 
"Open All Night" finds Bruce picking up his trusty Telecaster for the 
only real rock song on the record (save for Johnny 99) and takes us for a
 spirited ride across Jersey while his subject struggles to make time to
 see a late night love interest. 'Radio is jammed up with gospel 
stations / Lost souls calling long distance salvation / Hey Mr. Deejay 
won't you hear my last prayer / Hey ho rock n roll deliver me from 
nowhere" Springsteen howls into the mic, and so a bit of redemption 
might be possible for his luckless losers after all. Even if just in 
song. And closing the album with perhaps one of the best songs in his 
entire repertoire, "Reason To Believe" offers no solutions or answers to
 what has gone before, it simply marvels at the strength and faith it 
takes to believe enough in anything to make it to another day. Even if 
nothing shows a sign or gives a reason why you should. Taking a look at 
the ultimate hope and hopelessness that life often brings, its cycle of 
birth, sickness, disappointments, despair, and eventual death, it once 
again offers no answers. "Struck me kind of funny/Seemed kind of funny, 
sir indeed/How at the end of every hard earned day people find some 
reason to believe" Springsteen muses while describing personal pain and 
hardships that might bury you but for the little faith in your pocket. 
And so life, even for the more downtrodden among us, is given purpose to
 continue another day.<br>
<br>
Written at a time when Vietnam vets were settling in and settling down 
after their return home several years earlier, inspired by the film 
Badlands and the true life events of a murderous couple on a killing 
spree which inspired the film, and filtered through the eyes of an 
artist looking for the heart of his county in Reagans hard, cold 
America, Nebraska is the kind of near masterpiece of sharp inspired 
songwriting and understated performance that is not easily captured or 
documented when too much thought or detail is added to the mix. Often 
favorably compared to the darkest and most thoughtful work of Johnny 
Cash yet with a voice all its own, it serves as a chilling, stark, and 
cold soundtrack to a country that was just waking up to itself and its 
sins after a couple of long hard decades, and shines a light on the 
consequences our actions can have on the individual lives of what were 
once some of its strongest people. Unflinching, unafraid, and 
artistically bold and forceful, Nebraska is an album that finds Bruce 
Springsteen growing as a storyteller and quieting his voice to let the 
bad things in. An album so strong it cannot be duplicated, imitated, or 
even re-recorded, it stands even today as one of this artists best 
albums and has a timeless quality all its own. Original, dispairing, and
 as masterfully constructed a set of songs as Bruce has ever released, 
its a must listen for any fan of raw, barebones, and unpretentious 
musical storytelling at its best. And any other music fan, for that 
matter.</div>

Treblezine</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Now it seems fairly obvious as to why those of us on the `fringe' of 
popular music love Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska. In the independent 
music world, it seems almost commonplace for an artist to gain notoriety
 with a set of `demos,' like Devendra Banhart or Sam Beam. Bruce 
Springsteen was at a time in his life when he didn't necessarily need to
 record demos. He had just come off the double album, The River which 
spawned yet another hit single for the Boss in "Hungry Heart." It would 
be two more years until Bruce would vault old time American rock and 
roll back into the forefront of American consciousness with Born in the 
U.S.A. But in between those monumental successes was a quiet, dark and 
disturbing album, recorded by Springsteen in his basement without the 
`E' Street Band. More often than not, reviewers tend to make grandiose 
statements about artists or albums being essential when they're really 
not. But if there is one album that I would surreptitiously place on 
every CD rack in every home in America, it is Bruce Springsteen's 
Nebraska.<br>
<br>
The opening title track is a bleak introduction to what would be a 
similarly bleak collection of stories set to acoustic guitar and 
harmonica. The song relates the tale of Charles Starkweather, the man 
who, with his 13 year-old girlfriend, killed 11 people (ten according to
 the song). As in most of the songs on Nebraska, Springsteen uses the 
first person, putting the listener into the minds and hearts of 
extremely troubled individuals. Starkweather tells his own story, from 
meeting Caril Ann Fugate to being executed in the electric chair. His 
reason for the tragedy is even more chilling, "Well sir, I guess there's
 just a meanness in this world." There's very few artists who could pull
 off this kind of Midwestern noir acoustic tale, which for many first 
put Springsteen in the company of such greats as Dylan, Guthrie and 
Johnny Cash. "Atlantic City" is probably the best-known song from the 
album, which takes a grim view of the gambling town as a place of 
desperation. Again we find ourselves in the first person with a `down on
 his luck' man who has `debts no honest man can pay,' a sentiment echoed
 in "Johnny 99." This character's plight is so dire, however, that the 
chorus intimates death is probably not too far away. <br>
<br>
The short story mode continues in "Mansion on the Hill," an image much 
used throughout folk and country music. The lyrics evoke the words and 
style of writers such as Hemingway and his simplistic style, and 
Flannery O'Connor and Truman Capote with their southern gothic imagery. 
The darkness keeps on coming with another courtroom tale in "Johnny 99,"
 the story of a laid off autoworker that kills a store clerk and pleads 
for the electric chair. "Highway Patrolman," the longest song on 
Nebraska, emphasizes the meaning of family through yet another dark and 
depressing story. Sheriff Joe Roberts and his brother Franky live 
through hard times, but when Franky shoots a man, Joe must decide 
whether to put him away or let him go. Springsteen's chorus can describe
 both Joe and Franky as he sings, "Man turns his back on his family, 
well he just ain't no good." "State Trooper," a song inspired by one of 
the most depressing and disturbing songs of all time, Suicide's "Frankie
 Teardrop," is, if not as shocking as the original, just as potent, 
especially with the Boss' howls starkly contrasting with the quiet 
verses. The HBO show The Sopranos used this song to hauntingly end the 
first episode of the series. (Springsteen's guitarist, Little Steven, 
actually left the `E' Street Band around the time he was recording 
Nebraska). <br>
<br>
The album ends just as depressingly, but wondrously, as it begins in 
"Reason to Believe." In it, Springsteen tells a total of four shorter 
stories of hopelessness (a man poking a dead dog with a stick, a woman 
left by a man, an old man dies as a baby is born, and a groom is left 
alone at the altar), making the title somewhat ironic. Springsteen as 
narrator tells us that he finds it `funny' that people still find some 
reason to keep going. Not exactly the happiest of tunes, nor the most 
uplifting of albums, but that is not its point. Nebraska is like a Jim 
Thompson novel set to guitar. Its depiction of desperation, struggle, 
evil and darkness in the world is made palatable only by the sheer 
elegant and masterful way in which Bruce tells the stories. A depressing
 story told badly is just a depressing story. A depressing story told 
well is as compelling, if not more, than any other. No one knows this as
 well as Bruce Springsteen. Even some of his song with more of a mass 
appeal have a twinge of sadness in them, such as "Dancing in the Dark" 
("I ain't nothing but tired, man I'm just tired and bored with myself") 
and "I'm on Fire," ("Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby edgy 
and dull and cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my soul.") But 
even those songs had some hint of hope. In Nebraska there is no quarter 
asked and no quarter given. Springsteen quietly sings to us about real 
life and real life includes murder, theft, loneliness and hopelessness. <br>
<br>
To this day, Nebraska remains one of the albums of which Springsteen is 
most proud. Many of its songs, especially "Atlantic City," end up in 
live sets and greatest hits collections. Sub Pop Records even put out an
 entire tribute album just to Nebraska called Badlands: A Tribute to 
Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska. It doesn't quite measure up to the 
original in tone or elegance, but is worth the asking price just for 
Johnny Cash's version of "I'm On Fire," a song recorded during the 
Nebraska sessions, but later placed on Born in the U.S.A. I was 
originally put off by many of Springsteen's songs. I maybe didn't delve 
deep enough into the lyrics of songs like "Glory Days" and "Born in the 
U.S.A." But Nebraska brought me to the Boss in a way no other album 
could have. To this day it is my favorite Springsteen record and one of 
my favorite albums of all time. I am so enamored of this collection that
 I am still stymied by its appearance in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest 
Albums issue behind no less than four other Springsteen albums. The 
truth is, he has performed no finer work than Nebraska, a stunning 
literary as well as a musical masterpiece that sets him in a league far 
beyond that of mere rock star and in to the realm of legend.</div>

It is no surprise that Bruce Springsteen is still a mass-market 
phenomenon while other rockers of similar vintage have become 
cantankerous, hit-and-miss cults. For example, Neil Young was in London 
the other week, touting some woolly concept album with a candlelit 
theatre set where the audience was forbidden to drink and asked to stay 
silent. In contrast, Springsteen — “Brooce” to his adoring public, the 
name called out with such force between songs that, ironically, it 
sounds like booing — is playing two shows at a tree-lined sports arena 
on the edge of town. <br>
<br>
It’s a suitably Everyman setting for rock’n’roll’s friendliest icon. A 
star he may be, trim in all-black garb and neat goatee, but New Jersey’s
 most famous living son still seems like the kind of guy who’d give you a
 hand with the barbecue. When he leans into the opening widescreen swell
 of The Rising, the thousands of arms reaching forward in response do so
 out of love, not reverence. <br>
<br>
This number is the title track of Springsteen’s current album, released 
last year, which saw him reunited with his trusty E Street Band and 
returned to the top of the charts. A populist attempt to find hope and 
understanding amid the aftermath of September 11, the new record 
provides nearly half of the evening’s 25-song set, and more than a few 
highlights. The acoustic embrace of Empty Sky is one, addressing 
bereavement with heartbreaking eloquence. It’s guided home by a tender 
mandolin solo from Steven Van Zandt, who looks as cool as only someone 
who plays with Springsteen and stars in The Sopranos can. <br>
<br>
Waitin’ on a Sunny Day, meanwhile, is as carefree as the balmy Bank 
Holiday weather, inducing a beery mass chorus in the crowd and some 
grinning showmanship from their idol, who flings his guitar to a roadie,
 then bounds down to sing to the front row. <br>
<br>
That’s followed by 1978’s The Promised Land, its soulful frustration a 
reminder that Springsteen’s best songs occupy a space between your 
wildest dreams and the harshest truths. This is rock’n’roll with 
consequences: by always facing life’s realities — growing old, settling 
down, screwing up — he’ll never, unlike, say, the Rolling Stones, sound 
like a middle-aged parody. <br>
<br>
What’s more, the man’s still writing showstoppers. Mary’s Place is from 
the latest album but feels like a lost classic. It’s extended 
accordingly, with talismanic saxophonist Clarence Clemons leading the 
party and a ceaselessly energetic Springsteen turning gospel preacherman
 to introduce the band. <br>
<br>
The air-punching fervour that greets Born to Run is as glorious as it is
 inevitable, the song arcing up into crescendo after crescendo as 
floodlights strafe the stadium. <br>
<br>
A jubilant Dancing in the Dark finally brings down the curtain on three 
hours of sustained brilliance which could happily have gone on for twice
 as long. To answer the obvious, Bruce Springsteen is still The Boss.</div>

In his response to September 11, Bruce Springsteen confirmed himself to 
be America’s most thoughtful and single-minded rock star, says Gavin 
Martin<br>
When Bruce Springsteen released The Rising last July, his first album of
 new songs with the E Street Band for 18 years, it was hailed as the 
return of rock’s prodigal son. Inspired largely by the the terrorist 
attacks against the US<br>
on September 11, 2001, The Rising is classic Springsteen, an album of 
people struggling to find hope amid death, horror and seemingly 
insurmountable odds. But on both the album and at the shows that have 
followed, Springsteen has been at pains not to present himself as a 
patriotic figurehead. America’s most responsive rock star is also its 
most thoughtful and single-minded.<br>
Morality, dignity and integrity are rare in rock’n’roll, but these 
traits have been touchstones throughout Springsteen’s career. It is 
hardly surprising, therefore, that since the Eighties he has had an 
ambiguous relationship with his role as an all-American blue-collar rock
 icon.<br>
In 1992, newly settled into his $15 million home in Beverly Hills with 
his wife and children, he looked back ruefully on his recent past in 
Lucky Town. His 1995 album The Ghost of Tom Joad was a bleak look at 
“the new world order” from the perspective of migrant workers, refugees 
and former convicts. Though out of sync with contemporary pop culture, 
it was perfectly in keeping with Springsteen’s long-term quest to find a
 common humanity.<br>
However, unlike 1982’s Nebraska, which Springsteen’s biographer Dave 
Marsh contends was an album “about personal turmoil in the guise of 
social commentary”, Tom Joad was the work of a happily married 
millionaire family man. He was, however, uncertain where his future as 
an artist lay. “I was having a hard time locating my rock voice. I knew 
it didn’t want to be the voice from Born in the USA.” That song, the 
title track from his biggest selling album, remains the most 
misinterpreted of Springsteen’s career. During the 1984 US election 
campaign both Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale tried and failed to 
appropriate the title and Springsteen’s image. Outside of his music 
Springsteen has traditionally been reluctant to speak out on political 
issues. His caution is understandable. In an interview to publicise The 
Rising a one-line quote — “the war in Afghanistan was handled very, very
 smoothly” — was hailed as a ringing endorsement of the Bush 
Administration’s war on terror. But when the Dixie Chicks’ recent 
anti-Bush comments resulted in the Texan country trio being banned from 
radio stations Springsteen was quick to respond. “The pressure coming 
from the Government and big business to enforce conformity of thought 
concerning the war and politics goes against everything this country is 
about,” he said in a statement issued on his website.<br>
Although he made no public comment on the war in Iraq, Springsteen 
opened his shows during the conflict with Edwin Starr’s peace anthem 
War. As always with Springsteen, hope and reconciliation, rather than 
blame and retribution, have been the goals. Thus the show’s 
gospel-influenced climax Land of Hope and Dreams was prefaced by a 
prayer for “our sons, daughters and Iraqi civilians”. When Springsteen 
visited London last year he played a concert unlike any other, with more
 than 30 years of stage craft coming to bear on songs that explore both 
our darkest fears and sweetest dreams. In the post-hip-hop world it is 
hard to see how the traditions he draws on will thrive, but when 
Springsteen and the E Street Band are in full flow they have never 
seemed more vital or more alive.<br>
Now back in his native New Jersey, where Born to Run is the official 
state rock anthem and Asbury Park has been renamed Boss Avenue, 
Springsteen seems comfortable to play the local rock’n’roll star. His 
popularity there is greater than ever, and in August he will play to 
420,000 people in a series of shows at the Giants Stadium. But when 
local campaigners tried to persuade him to stand for the Senate last 
summer, Springsteen asserted his independence by quoting General 
Sherman: “If nominated I will not run, if elected I will not serve.”<br>
At 53, Springsteen is undoubtedly still born to run, but there are limits to how far he is prepared to go.</div>
