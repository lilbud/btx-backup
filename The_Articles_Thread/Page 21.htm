Following the popular musical traditions of the 1960s, Bruce Springsteen
 and his allies kicked off the Vote For Change Tour in Philadelphia on 
Friday night. But was the political sentiment lost in the music?<br>
<br>
Newsweek , 2004<br>
October 2, 2004<br>
By Randy Abramson<br>
<br>
Three quarters of the way through his exhausting set, Bruce Springsteen 
hushed the E Street Band in order to address the packed Wachovia Center 
crowd. Sounding like a preacher, he asked, ?Am I gonna take you down to 
that river of change??<br>
<br>
That plea for change, of course, was a shout-out for undecideds and 
George W. Bush supporters to vote for John Kerry in the upcoming 
presidential election. The Boss kept his evangelical shtick going, 
inviting anyone with a bowtie in the audience to join him on stage. A 
planted nerd appeared on stage, bowtie and all. Kneeling before the 
crowd, Springsteen asked the audience to shout ?Halliburton? three 
times. After the chant, the man leapt to his feet and shouted, ?I'm 
switching!?<br>
<br>
If only swaying voters in real life was that easy.<br>
<br>
The Vote for Change Tour, which began last night in Philadelphia (with a
 lineup including Springsteen, Bright Eyes, John Fogerty and R.E.M.) and
 several other concerts scheduled in Pennsylvania, is part of a 10-day 
concert series through swing states. All net proceeds go to America 
Coming Together (ACT), a pro-Democrat group which will use the money to 
mobilize voter registration for John Kerry. The musicians on the tour 
are sure to lose some fans due to their clear partisanship. And before 
last night, the question loomed as to whether the bands could put on 
entertaining shows as well as energize the public to get out and vote.<br>
<br>
Between the subtle artist interviews that played on video monitors 
between band sets, Springsteen's playful sermons and Bright Eyes' front 
man Conor Oberst's blunt plea for high voter turnout so that "We don't 
have to have this madman run our country anymore," the issue of purpose 
was clear without being overpowering.<br>
<br>
Surprisingly, there were no overt demonstrations before the show, nor 
were there visible anti-Bush signs inside the stadium, but the evening 
still packed a political punch. Without being preachy, the artists were 
able to make their points through their carefully chosen material. 
Beginning with indie heroes, Bright Eyes, the night took on a frenetic 
charge. Playing to a half-full arena, Oberst and his band, whose style 
is a mish-mash of Dylanesque phrasing and a vocal style that can err 
into Johnny Rotten-like tantrums, was able to win over the 30-and-over 
crowd that showed up early enough to check them out. R.E.M followed, 
bursting onto the stage with their classic, "The One I Love." Front man 
Michael Stipe, who was dressed for drama in an all white suit and 
matching boots, worked the crowd masterfully with signature frenzied 
dancing and stop-action poses. "We're R.E.M., and we approve of this 
concert," Stipe said to the adoring crowd. Their set list's titles alone
 were enough to convey their agenda. "World Leader Pretend," "Final 
Straw," and "Losing My Religion" all struck a powerful chord under the 
ACT umbrella.<br>
<br>
The band was joined by Springsteen for their final number, "Man On the 
Moon." The playful song brought a much-needed levity to the show, and 
although it was a stylistic mismatch for Springsteen, the crowd was 
floored. The song marked what would be the start of several all-star 
collaborations that would take place that night, all of which seemed to 
outdo its predecessor.<br>
<br>
The E Street Band emerged after a short break with Springsteen playing a
 ragged version of "The Star Spangled Banner" on acoustic 12-string, 
followed by high-energy renditions of "Born in the U.S.A.," "Badlands," 
and "No Surrender." The band was joined by Fogerty for "Centerfield" and
 the Credence Clearwater Revival anti-war anthem classic, "Fortunate 
Son."<br>
<br>
The rotating lineups continued throughout the night: Michael Stipe took 
lead vocals on "Because the Night;" Peter Buck and Michael Mills of 
R.E.M. backed Bruce on "Born To Run;" Springsteen sang a verse on CCR's 
"Proud Mary" and everyone came out for a blistering cover of Nick Lowe's
 "What's So Funny About Peace, Love and Understanding." The show closed 
with the collective group?s take on Patti Smith's "People Have the 
Power." Oberst, who is only 24 years old, handled his verse with 
confidence, with Stipe at his side and Springsteen looking on. In that 
moment the baton of the protest singer was passed from one generation to
 the next. The ideals of Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan were preserved, and
 if that too was a goal of this tour, then the bands can be assured that
 their mission was accomplished.</div>

Rocker brings deluge of fans to Pittsburgh's Flood Aid benefit<br>
<br>
Rolling Stone , <br>
December 13, 2004<br>
By Brad Hundt<br>
<br>
"No Brucing tonight, or I'll come out and get medieval on your ass," 
announced Bruce Springsteen at the beginning of Flood Aid 2004, a 
benefit concert at Pittsburgh's Heinz Hall Thursday night.<br>
He was referring, of course, to the ever-present chants of 
"Bruuuuuuuuce" that you find at the typical concert by Springsteen and 
the E Street Band. But trying to stop the "Brucing" was a little like 
trying to stop the rains that flooded Pittsburgh on September 17th, 
leaving hundreds of families without homes and causing millions of 
dollars in damage.<br>
<br>
Flood Aid 2004 was the brainchild of Springsteen friend and occasional 
collaborator Joe Grushecky, a longtime fixture of the Pittsburgh music 
scene. For the concert, Grushecky assembled a wide-ranging cast of 
friends, like Donnie Iris, who had hits in the early 1980s with "Ah! 
Leah!" and "Love Is Like a Rock," and Bill Deasy, a singer-songwriter 
who led the now-defunct Pittsburgh band the Gathering Field.<br>
<br>
But it was the presence of Springsteen, Grushecky's most prominent pal, 
that led all 2,600 tickets to sell out on November 23rd in just one 
hour.<br>
<br>
For the first two hours of the concert, Springsteen yielded the stage to
 the lesser-known acts, appearing only at the beginning and later with 
New Jersey band Exit 105, with whom he played a set-closing cover of Bob
 Dylan's "All Along the Watchtower."<br>
<br>
Around 10 p.m., Springsteen walked back onto the stage at Heinz Hall, 
the usual home of the Pittsburgh Symphony, for a three-song, 
career-spanning acoustic set consisting of 2001's "Land of Hope and 
Dreams," 1992's "If I Should Fall Behind" and 1973's "For You." He then 
joined Grushecky and his band, the Houserockers, for a fifteen-song set 
that mixed selections from each of their catalogs, as well as 
collaborations like "Code of Silence." The highlights included a 
hard-driving version of "Factory," from Springsteen's 1978 album 
Darkness at the Edge of Town, and Grushecky's soulful "Everything's 
Going to Work Out Right."<br>
<br>
The night concluded with all the musicians -- including Grushecky's 
sixteen-year-old son, Johnny -- coming out for a loose rendition of 
"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town," which found the Boss wearing a red 
Santa cap.<br>
<br>
The concert was expected to raise about $270,000 for victims of the 
flood, which was caused by remnants of Hurricane Ivan. Up to eight 
inches of rain fell on the region that day. Several communities 
surrounding Pittsburgh were particularly hard-hit, including one where 
Grushecky and his band store their equipment.<br>
<br>
Grushecky, also a special education teacher in Pittsburgh, said that he 
and his wife had been fielding calls over the past few weeks from people
 desperate to get tickets to the show. He joked from the stage, "I'm 
changing my phone number."</div>

				<div class="content">Bruce's show spans career<br>
New York Daily News , <br>
April 5, 2005<br>
<br>
By Richard Huff<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen said last night that explaining the process of writing songs was a lot like discussing sex.<br>
"It's better when demonstrated," he said.<br>
<br>
And that's exactly what he did before an intimate crowd of 350, mostly 
die-hard fans, who filled the new Two River Theater for a taping of 
VH1's show "Storytellers," which will air April 23.<br>
<br>
Springsteen sang and talked his way through songs spanning his career 
from "Blinded by the Light" off his first album to two new songs on his 
soon-to-be released collection "Devils &amp; Dust."<br>
<br>
Springsteen talked about his influences, his loves and his frequent references to religion.<br>
<br>
"You can't write without pulling this stuff out of you," he said at one point.<br>
<br>
Yet noting that, in his latest CD, which hits stores April 26 - and in 
past work - he was trying to create characters and let the audience walk
 in someone else's shoes.<br>
<br>
The title song of "Devils &amp; Dust," he said, was written at the point when the U.S. went into Iraq.<br>
<br>
"I got the power of life and death, but I don't know who to trust," he said, reciting the lyrics.<br>
<br>
"The unspoken subtext of the lyrics rest on a regular guy caught in the cross hairs," he explained.<br>
<br>
At the end of his last tour, Springsteen spoke openly about his concerns
 about the war in Iraq and several times lashed out at President Bush. 
And in November, he campaigned for Sen. John Kerry.<br>
<br>
"How much of this was I thinking about when I wrote it?" Springsteen 
said after extensively explaining the "Devils &amp; Dust" words. "None 
of it. How much of it was I feeling? All of it."<br>
<br>
"Devils &amp; Dust" he said, had points where "the personal and political were crashing together again."<br>
<br>
The New Jersey native stood on stage with just a guitar, harmonica, 
piano and roughly 50 people who had won tickets to the event. He was 
joined by his wife, Patti Scialfa, once, on "Brilliant Disquise."<br>
<br>
Over two hours, he sang eight songs, some twice because of either 
production difficulties or, simply, he wasn't comfortable with the first
 take. Among the songs were "Nebraska," "The Rising," "Waitin' on a 
Sunny Day" and "Thunder Road."<br>
<br>
He also performed "Jesus Was an Only Son," a new song on "Devils &amp; 
Dust" built around Jesus and his relationship with his mother, Mary, as 
his death neared.<br>
<br>
Springsteen said he wanted to write about the relationship between a parent and a child, and the desire to protect one's young.<br>
<br>
"I was shocked when I first felt it so deep inside myself," he said of being a father.<br>
<br>
Throughout the night, Springsteen frequently joked about his own image, laughed and swore when he made a mistake.<br>
<br>
"Oh, wait a minute," he said, stopping midsong to reach for his 
harmonica. "I f----d up, I knew it was there for a reason. It's good to 
be amongst friends."</div>

<br>
In a remarkable display of staying power, Bruce Springsteen (news) 
wrapped his career-reaffirming Rising tour with the E Street Band Oct. 4
 at Shea Stadium in New York.<br>
<br>
Reuters , <br>
October 11, 2003<br>
By Ray Waddell</strong><br>
<br>
The tour grossed $172.7 million in 2003, playing North American and 
Australian arenas in the spring and European and U.S. stadiums during 
the summer. <br>
<br>
With last year's barnstorming arena tour added to the mix, the gross 
comes to $221.5 million from 121 shows, enough to make this 
Springsteen's top-grossing trek in his 30 years of national touring. <br>
<br>
Those are heady numbers for an artist whose most successful days at 
radio and retail were years ago. "There are only a handful of people who
 have been around as long as Bruce has who can still tour and be at the 
top of their game," observes Jon Landau, Springsteen's longtime manager.
 <br>
<br>
"What we like, and what I think keeps Bruce going, is that these shows, 
even though they included lots of classic Bruce songs, revolved around 
his current creativity," Landau adds. "The sets included nine or 10 
songs from 'The Rising,' and the audience knew them and reacted just as 
intensely to them as the classics. This was not a look back." <br>
<br>
RECORD ENGAGEMENT <br>
Following Springsteen's triumphant trek through Europe, the 54-year-old 
New Jersey native began his U.S. run with an unprecedented 10 sellouts 
at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. That stand grossed $38.8 
million and drew 566,560 fans, a world record for one engagement. <br>
<br>
"I don't know if means that much to him, but I like it," Landau tells 
Billboard. "I think Bruce is very proud of this tour, as he should be. 
But as far as statistics, management gets to fuss over that a little 
more. What he did at Giants Stadium is a fabulous thing." <br>
<br>
The Giants Stadium shows were promoted in-house by the New Jersey Sports
 and Exposition Authority (NJSEA). "It was incredible," says Ron 
VanDeVeen, VP of event booking for the Meadowlands complex, site of 
Giants Stadium and the Continental Airlines Arena. "Seeing Bruce in New 
Jersey is the ultimate experience. We sold tickets in every state, and 
we had visitors from all over the world." <br>
<br>
The Meadowlands rose to the occasion by building a 270-foot boardwalk, 
complete with a Ferris Wheel, carnival games, concessions and 
performances by local Jersey Shore bands. The NJSEA invested $300,000 in
 creating the area, and just about broke even from its share of 
concessions sales. <br>
<br>
"This was a history-making event, and we wanted to make it bigger and better," VanDeVeen says. <br>
<br>
The Jersey concerts grossed about $1 million per night in merchandise 
and concessions sales; tour merchandise was by Signatures Network and 
featured event-specific T-shirts for each night of the run. The Giants 
Stadium stand took Springsteen's Meadowlands complex total to 60 
sellouts, including 44 at the arena. <br>
<br>
As big as Jersey was, Landau found other dates almost as gratifying, 
particularly a two-night stand at Boston's legendary Fenway Park that 
grossed $5.2 million from two sellouts. <br>
<br>
"In a tour of high points, I don't know if anything could be any higher 
than Fenway," says Landau, who took the stage with a guitar during 
"Dancing in the Dark" at the first Boston show. <br>
<br>
Promoter Don Law, chairman/co-CEO of Clear Channel Entertainment Music 
and a veteran of numerous Springsteen shows, says the first Fenway 
concert "was one of the hottest Springsteen shows I've ever seen. Bruce 
was inspirational, and the setting was magical; it's great when those 
two things come together." <br>
<br>
And even though the 91-year-old stadium had never hosted a rock concert,
 the event came off flawlessly, Law says. "It was a huge event," he 
says. <br>
<br>
THE 'A' TEAM <br>
Springsteen's crack touring team, headed by veteran tour director 
Travis, was able to turn large, unwieldy sports stadiums into intimate 
concert halls. Production opted for amps stacked onstage rather than the
 sleek look many touring acts favor today. Lights were by Morpheus, 
sound by Audio Analysts and set design by Visual Terrain. <br>
<br>
"From a creative point of view, we felt playing outdoors was the way to 
go," Landau says. "It's funny, but at this point in time, sound quality 
has now progressed to the point where outdoors is really better than 
indoors, audio-wise. It's better onstage, and it's better in the house. 
We all felt that people who saw the show in this environment heard it in
 the best possible context." <br>
<br>
Springsteen and his E Street Band worked up more than 100 songs for the 
tour, and Springsteen was tweaking the set list right up to the final 
shows. <br>
<br>
Other key touring personnel include 30-year Springsteen agent Barry 
Bell, road manager Wayne Lebeaux, production manager Lyle Centola, sound
 mixer John Cooper, tour accountant Michael Lorick, security director 
Jerry Fox Sr. and assistant road manager Lenny Sullivan. <br>
<br>
Travis started with Springsteen on 1978's Darkness on the Edge of Town 
tour as a rigger. "You could tell then he was destined for much more 
sophisticated things," Landau says. "We've got a bunch of stars on our 
crew. By our standards, whether it's Kevin Buell, Bruce's longtime 
guitar tech, to George, we're looking for every person to be the best 
there is at their position. We're looking for the A-team."</div>

<br>
The Arizona Republic , <br>
May 1, 2005<br>
By Larry Rodgers<br>
<br>
When Bruce Springsteen announced that he would perform for more than 
5,000 people at Glendale Arena in the third concert of his solo acoustic
 tour, it raised the question: Could even a Rock and Roll Hall of Famer 
keep the attention of such a large crowd for a show running more than 
two hours? <br>
<br>
Springsteen quelled any doubts Saturday night with a brisk, masterful 
performance that kept the well-mannered audience mesmerized with the 
best storytelling songs in rock music today. <br>
<br>
After asking for "as much quiet as I can get" at the start of the 
concert, Springsteen let his catalog of American tales, including a 
generous sampling from his strong new "Devils &amp; Dust" album, do most
 of the talking in the arena for the next few hours. <br>
<br>
With the concession stands closed during the entire performance, most 
members of the baby boomer-heavy crowd remained in their seats for the 
duration, basking in the glow of a singer-songwriter who seems to only 
get more talented as the decades pass. <br>
<br>
Deftly accompanying himself on guitar, harmonica and piano, Springsteen,
 55, showed that he made the right choice in seeking no backing from 
anyone except for a one-song visit by Scottsdale guitarist Nils Lofgren -
 a member of the on-hiatus E Street Band - during an encore version of 
"This Hard Land." <br>
<br>
Springsteen chose to be fairly economical with his comments between 
songs, although he did call for "a humane immigration policy" before 
playing the new "Matamoros Banks," lambaste the "dinosaur" mentality of 
the Bush administration (before "Part Man, Part Monkey") and talk about 
drifting away from the Catholic church (as a prelude to the new "Jesus 
Was An Only Son" ), among other ramblings. He ad-libbed a "That's right"
 after one audience member yelled "(Expletive) the president" at one 
point. <br>
<br>
His decision to keep the songs flowing left little chance for anyone to 
scream for "Born To Run" or "Born in the U.S.A.," but this crowd was 
more than willing to let Springsteen call the shots. (In fact, he played
 no songs from either of the huge albums named after those two hits. <br>
<br>
Taking the stage dressed all in black, Springsteen refused to play it 
safe, launching into a harmonica-and-vocals take on "Reason To Believe,"
 one of only two songs from his first solo album, 1982's "Nebraska." 
Stomping his boot on the stage for percussion, he sang gritty, distorted
 vocals through a microphone designed for his harmonica - hardly a 
polished start. <br>
<br>
But he followed that tune with a flawless, engaging take on "Devils 
&amp; Dust," a song written from the perspective of a confused solider 
hunkered down in Iraq. He breathed heavily as he delivered lines like 
the opening "I got my finger on the trigger / But I don't know who to 
trust," adding to the resignation and drama of the studio version. 
Extended harmonica work also fleshed out the live version. <br>
<br>
He continued to fill the arena with plenty of sound with booming 
12-string guitar on "Youngstown," from his second solo album, 1995's 
"The Ghost of Tom Joad." His vocals were spine-tingling, especially when
 he repeated the final line from the narrator, who has lost his 
steel-mill job: "When I die I don't want no part of heaven {ellipsis} I 
pray the devil comes and takes me / To stand in the fiery furnaces of 
hell." "Youngstown" and the bittersweet "My Best Was Never Good Enough" 
were the night's only selections from "Tom Joad." <br>
<br>
"The Rising" album, Springsteen's poignant 2002 response to the Sept. 11
 terrorist attacks on America, got a generous nod on Saturday, starting 
with a 12 string-and-harmonica treatment of "Lonesome Day," which made 
up for the absence of the E Street Band's rocking guitar work on the 
original. <br>
<br>
That album's title track, delivered with a light silhouetting the singer
 from behind, was well-received. But even with some crowd participation,
 Springsteen's attempt to transform the good-timing "Waitin' On a Sunny 
Day" came off half-empty, one of the evening's few missteps. <br>
<br>
Other standouts from his latest CD included a crisp take on "Leah," 
which he described as inspired by how we balance "the seeds of our 
creativity and the seeds of our own destruction," and the upbeat 
"Maria's Bed," in which he playfully moved around the stage and shouted 
"C'mon, boys!" as he does when onstage with the E Streeters. <br>
<br>
He nailed the cinematic "The Hitter," commenting that "I like to write 
songs about people whose souls are at risk," and made a strong case for 
making "Long Time Comin' " the second single from "Devils &amp; Dust." <br>
<br>
Springsteen moved behind the piano for a handful of songs, including a 
show-stopping version of "Racing in the Street," from 1978's "Darkness 
on the Edge of Town." Although the sound system, which was crystal-clear
 for most of the night, was cranked a bit too high for the song, 
Springsteen showed off improved piano skills and still-passionate 
vocals. <br>
<br>
He later drew laughs as he sat at the keyboard and introduced a very 
rare performance of 1992's "Book of Dreams" by calling it "a song about 
wedding days" and adding, "I say 'days' plural, unfortunately." That 
referred to the fact that his current marriage to E Street singer Patti 
Scialfa followed a failed first try at matrimony. He also cracked up as 
he told the crowd that his late father once told him, "Bruce, love songs
 are a government plot. Their sole purpose is to get you married so 
you'll pay your taxes." <br>
<br>
Springsteen made a valiant attempt at giving 1978's "Promised Land," an E
 Street concert favorite, a slower, more emotional feel. He tapped his 
acoustic guitar, pounded the strings with the palm of his hand and did 
some extended yodeling, but this remains a song best performed with 
electric guitars and Max Weinberg's drums. <br>
<br>
He also added some yodeling to the end of a dead-on version of the new 
"Reno," which stirred a few murmurs with its graphic description of a 
lonely man's encounter with a hooker. ("If there's any kiddies out 
there, it might be a good time to go check out some of that fine 
merchandise" in the lobby, he said before the song, which mixes poetic 
images of better times in Mexico in with the adult language. <br>
<br>
Springsteen and the Glendale audience both deserve congratulations for 
being up to the challenge of delivering and appreciating an evening of 
music that was rare in the increasingly formulaic and corporate world of
 rock and roll.</div>

Albany Times Union ,<br>
July 17, 2005<br>
By Michael Eck<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen casts a giant shadow. <br>
<br>
As he strummed the opening chords of "The Rising" Saturday night at 
Pepsi Arena, a spotlight illuminated him from behind, projecting his 
image against the back wall of the venue four stories high. <br>
<br>
It just seemed right. <br>
<br>
The show marked Springsteen's first-ever solo appearance in the region 
after years of making regular tour stops with his E Street Band. <br>
<br>
The purpose of this "solo acoustic" jaunt, of course, is to showcase his new album, "Devils &amp; Dust." <br>
<br>
He offered the title tune three songs into his long show, and then 
surveyed much of the rest of the album of throughout the evening -- 
including a bright "All The Way Home," a loose, chatty "Jesus was an 
Only Son" and the mesmerizing "Leah." <br>
<br>
He dedicated "Long Time Comin,' " from "Devils," to his son, Evan, who 
was in the house with a friend, Tyler. The buddy was on the receiving 
end of a dedication for "Silver Palomino." <br>
<br>
Springsteen smiled at the boys when he was finished. <br>
<br>
The controversial "Reno," which illustrates a brokenhearted man's 
episode with a hooker, was less laser-focused than on the album, and it 
marked the only moment in the show that Springsteen didn't seem a slave 
to his muse. <br>
<br>
The aforementioned "The Rising" found that focus and then some. It seemed as though Springsteen channeled the song. <br>
<br>
Longtime fans had plenty to celebrate. Springsteen (who was abetted by 
some recorded tracks) moved between a variety of guitars and pianos for 
songs from throughout his career. <br>
<br>
Some, like "Reason to Believe" and "Spare Parts," were radically 
rearranged as gritty blues numbers. The former was delivered as a 
Beefheartian boot stomp, with a wheezing harp snaking between the lines.
 The latter was a slide-guitar rave-up with overtones of Leadbelly and 
Big Joe Williams. <br>
<br>
The rarity "Part Man, Part Monkey" was given an electric reading, with evolutionary commentary. <br>
<br>
Later, during the encores, Springsteen also offered a refashioned 
"Promised Land" that traded the original's drive for a newfound emotion.
 <br>
<br>
Fans seemed especially appreciative when their hero sat down at the keys
 - whether responding to the opening pump organ drone of "Into the Fire"
 or cheering for "Human Touch's" "The Real World." <br>
<br>
He introduced "The Promise" by saying, "I haven't played this in 
awhile," and then chuckled at his own keyboard fumbling during the tune.
 <br>
<br>
He closed the set proper with a deep reading of the border song 
"Matamoros Banks" and finished off the encores, as he has on most nights
 of the tour, with a haunting pump organ cover of Suicide's "Dream Baby 
Dream."</div>

<br>
Chicago Tribune ,<br>
May 13, 2005<br>
By Greg Kot<br>
<br>
For the first time in 10 years, Bruce Springsteen is going it alone. 
That means no E Street Band, no "Rosalita" encore, and no clapping, 
cell-phoning or drinking. <br>
<br>
At a sold-out Rosemont Theatre on Wednesday, Springsteen opted for 
somber reflection, a troubadour plying his deepest thoughts and most 
pensive songs to a hushed audience. The singer basically told everybody 
to shut up at the start and cut off liquor sales 10 minutes before show 
time. He traded his hardest-working-man-in-show-biz uniform for that of a
 self-serious Artist With Something Important to Say. But Springsteen's 
folkiest songs are rarely self-important. They are detailed character 
sketches, rich in imagery that rewards close scrutiny. If there was 
anything lacking, it's that sometimes he was a bit miserly with his 
melodies, changing chords all too reluctantly. These weren't 
hum-in-the-shower pop ditties, and when too many were strung together, 
monotony threatened. But Springsteen's words were well-chosen, and his 
singing offered a blend of textures that he couldn't hope to match in a 
raucous arena concert. Besides his well-worn Dust Bowl mumble, he worked
 in a haunting falsetto and a rockabilly wail, and exhibited a 
conversational authority throughout. <br>
<br>
Things opened strangely with Springsteen turning "My Beautiful Reward" 
into a droning ballad on harmonium, then remaking "Reason to Believe" 
into a scratchy, distorted 78 r.p.m. blues single, with foot stomping 
percussion. The clenched-teeth vocal style that has marred Springsteen's
 non-rock recordings constrained the impact of songs such as the title 
track from his latest album, "Devils &amp; Dust." It's why Springsteen's
 rare acoustic concerts don't carry as much star-appeal as his 
much-ballyhooed tours with the E Street Band. But, truth be told, 
Springsteen could use the break. With the E Streeters, Springsteen 
sometimes strives too hard to entertain, abandoning his more 
introspective material and all but quelling his shaggy-dog story-telling
 banter in order to keep the fans in the third balcony from taking a 
hot-dog break. But as he began to loosen up at the Rosemont Theatre, the
 stories began to flow and the songs opened up. The singer telescoped 
the audience's attention when he seated himself behind a grand piano and
 rhapsodized about the spell cast by '50s doo-wop recordings, how they 
featured male singers "attempting to sound like beautiful women ... 
trying to transcend themselves." In the same way, Springsteen 
transcended the obvious by dipping back to his rarely performed 
"Incident on 57th Street," a rhapsody of possibility that gave way to 
the collapsed dreams of "The River," and a mournful falsetto coda. The 
singer goofed on a topsy-turvy society in which pop culture has been 
turned into the enemy and surfed the guitar strings with his whammy bar 
on "Part Monkey, Part Man." He played with percussive force on a black 
12-string for "Further On (Up the Road)," wailing like a fugitive who 
can escape neither the law nor his conscience. It was Springsteen at his
 acoustic best, the same cold-sweat vibe that made his "Nebraska" album 
so haunting. <br>
<br>
The more intimate atmosphere allowed him to experiment with narrative 
and song form. At times he flattened melodies unnecessarily, as in the 
banjo-led "I'm on Fire," further deadened by off-key whistling. But his 
syncopated tapping and slapping of guitar strings and wood transformed 
"The Promised Land" into an eerily hypnotic meditation. The 
experimentation paid off on "Jesus Was an Only Son," which he expanded 
with additional verses that mused on parenthood. It was answered by the 
stark thumb-picking of "The Hitter," in which an estranged son tries to 
converse with his mother through a locked door. With just his guitar and
 voice, he built entire worlds out of "Leah," a Roy Orbison-like 
reverie, and "Matamoros Banks," a Spanish-flavored tale narrated by a 
ghost. He departed not with a flourish but with an incantation: "Dream, 
baby, dream, wipe the tears from your eyes." The harmonium droned, and 
his voice was drenched in reverb. It was like a scene out of a David 
Lynch movie, a lounge song from a blue-velvet hallucination. It wasn't 
exactly a classic, E Street-worthy exit. But it was one that won't soon 
be forgotten by those who witnessed it.</div>

<br>
The Republican , <br>
May 23, 2005<br>
By Kevin O'Hare<br>
When Bruce Springsteen records or tours without the E Street Band, he's 
fond of pointing out that he was originally signed to his first record 
deal as a solo artist. <br>
<br>
It's taken him a whole lot of years, but he's finally getting the hang 
of transforming most of the majesty, power and passion of his epic full 
band rock shows into settings as intimate as the one he played Friday 
during a spellbinding solo acoustic performance before a full house at 
the Orpheum Theatre. <br>
<br>
For starters, this was much better than the somber and intense solo 
concert Springsteen staged at the same venue in December 1995, while he 
was touring on his own for the first time in years, promoting the 
equally solemn "The Ghost of Tom Joad." <br>
<br>
This time, he's hit the road behind his new solo album "Devils &amp; 
Dust." While it's hardly upbeat, it's a magnificent recording, full of 
richly cinematic tales, and Springsteen is relying heavily on it in 
concert, while also pulling out some intriguing, and mostly lesser-known
 tracks from various other points in his career. <br>
<br>
He didn't receive the first standing ovation of the night. That was 
reserved for Sen. John Kerry, the unsuccessful presidential candidate 
who Springsteen broke personal precedent for while stumping on the 
campaign trail and leading the "Vote For Change" tour last fall. Kerry 
received a rousing reception - and a smattering of boos - when he moved 
toward his seat prior to the concert. <br>
<br>
The crowd also included "Meet The Press" host Tim Russert, and maybe for
 those reasons this show had a few more stinging political references 
than have been reported at other stops during the singer's U.S. tour. <br>
<br>
Tickets said the concert was to start at 7:30 p.m., but Springsteen 
didn't make it to the stage until approximately 8:35 p.m., when he took a
 seat behind a small pump organ and launched into a hymn-like rendition 
of "My Beautiful Reward." <br>
<br>
A jarring, stomping, bluesy, distorted version of "Reason to Believe," 
followed, with Springsteen pounding his black boots on the stage, 
wailing a harmonica and growling his way through the cut like Tom Waits 
on a dark, rainy morning. <br>
<br>
"Devils &amp; Dust," one of the only recently written cuts on the new 
album, followed with Springsteen playing guitar and singing about a 
soldier's fear and confusion while fighting for his life in a war-torn 
land. <br>
<br>
One very nice aspect of this evening was that Springsteen talked 
frequently between songs, resurrecting the style of eloquent monologues 
that helped turn him into a star 30 years ago. The 55-year-old father of
 three children was especially articulate prior to "Long Time Comin'," a
 classic about trying to not pass sins and failures from one generation 
to the next. <br>
<br>
He sat at the grand piano for an angelic version of "The River," which 
he introduced by paying homage to the wonders of women and the wonders 
of doo-wop groups. <br>
<br>
While he was frequently serious, the songwriter was also quite amusing, 
like when he prefaced "Part Man, Part Monkey," with some political shots
 about those politicians and others who question evolution. <br>
<br>
"In New Jersey, we believe in evolution. It's our only hope," Springsteen quipped. <br>
<br>
He rocked while banging on an acoustic 12-string guitar for "All The Way
 Home," and called the rarely played "Cautious Man," "one of my 
favorites." <br>
<br>
His piano-based, post 9/11 tale about suicide bombers and lives left 
behind, "Paradise," was positively haunting and arguably the night's 
most unforgettable song. And he picked up the power considerably with 
"The Rising." <br>
<br>
Among other latter set standouts was an aggressive "Further On (Up The 
Road)," as well as "Jesus Was an Only Son," and "Leah." Prior to the 
latter track he told a very amusing story about visiting the late great 
Roy Orbison, who at the time was writing a song about wind-surfing. 
Springsteen had doubts about the subject matter. <br>
<br>
"As my friend John and I can tell you, the American people draw the line
 when it comes to wind-surfing," Springsteen said, drawing howls of 
laughter while referring to Kerry's penchant for the sport. <br>
<br>
The rock hall-of-famer's stark tale about a boxer, "The Hitter," 
followed, prior to a magnificent version of his immigration saga 
"Matamoros Banks." He introduced the latter by saying "What we need 
instead of vigilantes across the border is a president who'd come across
 with a humane immigration policy." <br>
<br>
If the night had any downside it's that after 19 amazing songs, 
Springsteen's encores were slightly disappointing. He did five 
selections, starting with a rockabilly run through "Ramrod;" a very 
weird "I'm on Fire," which was marred by his own way off-key whistling; 
"Land of Hope and Dreams," which was one of the few songs where he 
really missed having his bandmates with him; and a percussive but 
unnecessarily subdued take of his classic "The Promised Land." <br>
<br>
Two hours and 10 minutes after it began, the concert ended with a real 
surprise, as Springsteen returned to the pump organ for a mystical and 
eerie, echo-filled cover of the incredibly obscure "Dream Baby Dream," 
by Suicide. As he left the stage, the keyboard chords kept playing, with
 Springsteen's last words echoing into the night, "C'mon baby, keep on 
dreaming."</div>

<br>
Mercury News , <br>
May 6, 2005<br>
By Brad Kava<br>
It's a rare rock 'n' roll artist who can play a solo acoustic set of 
more than two hours and make it feel almost as electric as when he is 
plugged in. <br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen did it at Oakland's Paramount Theater Thursday night, receiving thunderous ovations from a sold out audience. <br>
<br>
Shuffling instruments and reworking songs, he ran through a sort of 
lesser-known greatest hits set, some of them set in such brilliant 
disguises it took an expert to decipher what he was playing. <br>
<br>
After starting with "My Beautiful Reward,'' from 1992's less than 
stellar, "Lucky Town,'' he sang a song and accompanied himself only on 
harmonica, vocals and music through a distorted effects processor. <br>
<br>
It sounded like an old Muddy Waters take on "Mannish Boy,'' but turned 
out to be ``Reason to Believe,'' from 1982's first acoustic effort, 
"Nebraska.'' <br>
<br>
Later in the show he used the same muddy technique for that album's "Johnny 99.'' <br>
<br>
He played a 12-string guitar and made it sound like an entire band on 
"All the Way Home'' and did a call and response on "The Rising'' that 
sounded like two people were singing. <br>
<br>
He reworked show closer "Promised Land'' into something that could have 
been played by an ancient Mississippi Delta blues shouter, pounding on 
the guitar rather than strumming it. <br>
<br>
Some highlights included emotional solo piano takes on "Racing in the Streets'' and "The River.'' <br>
<br>
There was a handful of new songs from ``Devils &amp; Dust'' that worked 
perfectly in an acoustic context. And even better, songs from his last 
album, "The Rising,'' including "Further on (Up the Road),'' lost no 
power with the power down. <br>
<br>
How many other classic rock artists are putting out great work 35 years into their careers? Not many. <br>
<br>
Everytime out Springsteen has distinguised himself with perfect sound 
systems that defy the constraints of the worst rooms. That wasn't a 
problem at the Paramount, but he still managed to make the sound full 
and rich and never too loud. <br>
<br>
It makes you wonder why so few other artists can achieve the same 
satisfying results. Are they too cheap or too ignorant to spend the time
 and money to make live shows sound as good as recordings? <br>
<br>
That said, Springsteen was not without his errors onstage. There were 
plenty of minor clunkers on the piano and harmonica, particularly odd 
since his three-hour-long arena shows with the large E Street Band were 
almost compulsively note perfect. <br>
<br>
But Thursday was his night to be a folkie, ala Woody Guthrie, the blemishes adding to the nights down-home reality. <br>
<br>
The artist who looks far younger than his 55 years, asked the audience 
not to clap along, fearing it would throw off his "tenuous'' sense of 
rhythm. He also asked them to stop clapping at the beginning of songs. <br>
<br>
"You can eschew the clapping when you recognize a song,'' he said, 
perhaps the first rocker in history to use that S.A.T. word onstage. "I 
know it and you've heard it before. It's kind of a hack thing. It'd been
 done. I feel like I'm in Vegas when I hear that clapping.'' <br>
<br>
He even asked them not to applaud his few political statements, such as 
his fear that a movie like "Inherit the Wind,'' about evolution, 
couldn't be made today in the country's conservative climate. <br>
<br>
"No applause please,'' he said. "I don't want to feel like I'm preaching to the converted.'' <br>
<br>
It was almost unavoidable though. On this night, even a Springsteen hater might have been blinded by the light.</div>

Ottawa Sun , <br>
July 14, 2005<br>
By Allan Wigney<br>
<br>
Call it darkness on the edge of town. Bruce Springsteen was wrapping his
 raspy pipes around the final notes of Maria's Bed, one of several 
Devils &amp; Dust songs that sounded much stronger last night when 
performed alone on stage by the Boss than on CD, when the lights went 
out. <br>
<br>
Literally. <br>
<br>
"The lights went out. Then they went on again. Then they went out. And 
it was the best part of the show," a relaxed and in-control Springsteen 
joked once he was up and running again. <br>
<br>
And with that, he naturally eased into a tender reading of I Wish I Were Blind. <br>
<br>
It was that sort of evening Wednesday, with Springsteen making the most of whatever was at his disposal. <br>
<br>
That included a band's worth of instruments -- piano, harmonium, organ, 
guitars, harmonica -- and a sturdy pair of workman's boots to keep the 
beat. <br>
<br>
It was the best attitude for a show introduced as being of "an intimate 
nature." After all, Springsteen couldn't help but notice as he gazed 
around the Corel Centre at the crowd of nearly 7,000 that Ottawa's idea 
of an intimate show differed greatly from that of other cities on his 
solo tour. <br>
<br>
But then, this is the city that once sold tickets behind the stage for a performance by the Boss. <br>
<br>
And, despite his cavernous surroundings, Springsteen successfully turned
 the building that will soon once again host NHL hockey into a cozy 
theatre, playfully singing off-mic during a rousing rendition of Long 
Time Comin' and sharing tales of parenthood with the faithful. <br>
<br>
And this was a show for the faithful. There would be no bombastic Born 
in the U.S.A. anthem this evening. Rather, this was the Springsteen of 
Nebraska, The Ghost of Tom Joad and the acclaimed Devils &amp; Dust -- 
albums whose songs were sprinkled throughout the career-spanning set. <br>
<br>
When he did give us songs we associate with the E-Street Band such as 
The River and Racing in the Streets, they were presented with restraint.
 And as such, the beauty of said songs shone through the darkened 
theatre. <br>
<br>
And yes, the darkness was the best part. Not physical darkness, but the 
darkness that has lurked behind Springsteen's urban folk tales for three
 decades and that shrouds the defeated characters of Devils &amp; Dust. <br>
<br>
The blackout-causing Maria's Bed, for instance, is a decidedly adult 
view of the world from an artist who has dared to mature with his 
audience rather than seeking a new one -- a tale of a brief affair 
between emotionless lovers with better things to worry about. <br>
<br>
It was also an adult evening in other respects. Concession stands closed
 before the show. No one was admitted during songs, and thanks to oodles
 of tickets suddenly being released for sale Tuesday and yesterday, even
 scalpers learned a hard lesson about life on the edge of town. <br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the mature audience hung on every word during the 21/2-hour 
set -- no longer interested (for the most part) in lowering themselves 
to knee-jerk cries of "Broooce!" <br>
<br>
It has, after all, been 30 years. And every one of those years came to 
life with stark clarity last night, as Springsteen offered a generous 
cross-section of favourites and lesser-known material, performed not to 
elicit automatic applause but to take us on a journey. <br>
<br>
A journey into and out of the darkness. <br>
<br>
That was the best part.</div>

<br>
Buffalo News , <br>
July 19, 2005<br>
By Jeff Miers<br>
<br>
Talk about book-ending your show. <br>
<br>
On Monday evening, Bruce Springsteen offered a thematically linked song 
cycle examining the dark heart of a dream. Throughout it, he plumbed the
 deepest depths of failed character, alienation and hopelessness and 
extolled the virtues of dreams that refuse to die. <br>
<br>
Early in the set, Springsteen played "Reason to Believe," a song of 
existential despair from the mighty, near-gothic "Nebraska" record. At 
show's end, he offered up "Dream Baby Dream" like a haunted prayer. <br>
<br>
It's in the seemingly vast thematic space between these two world views 
that the genius of Springsteen's art can be located. "Reason to 
Believe," a raw, primal, black-as-death folk-blues, calls forth the 
standard barometers of fulfillment in American life - faith, marriage, 
enduring love - and mocks them with a Greek chorus; "Struck me kinda 
funny/Funny indeed/How at the end of every hard-earned day, people find 
some reason to believe." <br>
<br>
That might read as a tribute to the indomitability of the human spirit, 
but it isn't delivered as one; rather, it's a glance into the abyss, a 
bare-boned acknowledgment of existential emptiness sung through a 
heavily distorted harmonica microphone. Springsteen played the song 
passionately, his throaty delivery full of fury, rather than 
resignation. <br>
<br>
"Dream Baby Dream" was offered as a hymn, a healing balm, played on the 
pump organ and sung with the sort of hopeful conviction Springsteen has 
brought to E Street Band anthems like "Land of Hope and Dreams," "No 
Surrender" and even "Born to Run." Life may have no inherent order or 
meaning, but dreams make it worth the living, the song and Springsteen's
 delivery suggested. <br>
<br>
Between these pillars was a body of song often harrowing in its 
assessment of both the human and the American condition, occasionally 
hopeful and celebratory, and always taut and emotional. <br>
<br>
Moving between a variety of guitars, acoustic piano and various 
keyboards, Springsteen concentrated on material from his recent 
semi-acoustic "Devils &amp; Dust" record, interspersed with selections 
from "Nebraska" and a host of rarely-played surprises. <br>
<br>
They bore several common characteristics: Springsteen's hybrid 
blues/country/r&amp;b/folk singing, which was consistently nuanced and 
engaging; the taut, uncluttered harmonic arrangements of his songs; and 
the appearance of characters whose souls are in some kind of danger, 
whether from within or without. <br>
<br>
The new songs were astounding in their live presentation. <br>
<br>
"Devils &amp; Dust" became a stark, cinematic nightmare in which a 
soldier discovers that doing his patriotic duty and preserving whatever 
it is that's good about him - his soul, in Springsteen lore - are 
mutually exclusive concepts. <br>
<br>
"The Hitter" finds an aging boxer alienated from self, family and 
community collapsing in a world-weary heap on his mother's doorstep. <br>
<br>
"Long Time Coming" is delivered in the voice of a character determined 
to break the Ecclesiastical chain of inherited sin by facing up to the 
responsibilities of fatherhood. <br>
<br>
"Matamoras Banks" casts a searchlight on a man attempting to emigrate to
 the U.S. illegally via a river crossing, and dying in reverse; as the 
song begins, the narrator is already dead. As it progresses, he recounts
 the hope for a better life that brought him to the rivers edge. It's a 
stark, poetic slaughterhouse of a song that operates on two levels - 
first, as an examination of "us and them" immigration policies, and then
 as an unflinching meditation on the notion of death and crossing over. <br>
<br>
Trifling pop songs these are not. <br>
<br>
There were many surprises as well. "Empty Sky," from "The Rising", 
"Sandy) 4th of July Asbury Park)", "Leap Of Faith", "State Trooper", 
"Nebraska", "The Line", "When You're Alone", "Does This Bus Stop at 82nd
 Street?" - all were rarely, if ever, played on Springsteen's tour to 
date. <br>
<br>
The centerpiece of Monday's show, just as it is the emotional heart of 
the "Devils &amp; Dust" album, was the song "Jesus Was An Only Son", 
performed at the piano by a visibly emotional Springsteen. A 
gospel-tinged ballad with shades of both "Racing In the Street"-era E 
Street Band and Dylan circa "Blonde On Blonde", the song examines a 
mother's unconditional love for her son and has present-day implications
 concerning George Bush's war in Iraq. <br>
<br>
A note to the hundreds of folks who responded negatively to my column in
 last week's Gusto celebrating the strength of Springsteen's solo tour, 
2005. <br>
<br>
"Hey, dude - What'd you do on Monday night?" <br>
<br>
My guess is you spun an E Street bootleg, circa 1974. Hope you enjoyed it. <br>
<br>
Springsteen is one of very few modern songwriters who've successfully 
yearned to have it both ways; he's a star of the first magnitude, but 
he's also a true artist, as Monday's show made quite plain.</div>

Atlanta Journal-Constitution ,<br>
July 25, 2005<br>
By Nick Marino<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen ambled onto the stage, his shirt unbuttoned and tucked
 into jeans, his sleeves rolled up to his elbows, his receding hair 
swept up and back. Nothing unusual there. <br>
<br>
But the man was all by himself. That's right, no E Street Band, which 
meant no mic-sharing with Little Steven, no breakneck rock 'n' roll 
anthems, no knee-slides across the stage. <br>
<br>
This was Bruce Alone, baby, playing acoustic music on an anti-Greatest 
Hits tour. You wanna hear "Dancing in the Dark"? Well, that's what 
albums are for. Geddouttaheah. <br>
<br>
The 55-year-old New Jersey bard, who is touring behind his brooding new 
record "Devils &amp; Dust," is using his solo shows as a forum in which 
to rearrange familiar tunes, work through some new ones from "Devils" 
and even dust off some deep catalog material that, against the odds, 
he'd somehow never performed. <br>
<br>
If you didn't know this beforehand, you might've been disappointed with 
the semi-obscure set list and the bare-bones approach. And indeed the 
audience --- which was overwhelmingly white and middle-aged --- 
occasionally got fidgety, as though some fans just couldn't stand 
sharing a room with the Boss and not yelling their way through a 
cathartic "Born to Run." <br>
<br>
Even if you knew what Springsteen had planned going into his Atlanta 
show over the weekend, there was some reason for alarm --- this intimate
 performance was to take place in a not-exactly intimate sports arena, 
and it was alarming to imagine sitting through two dour hours of 
Springsteen, seated on a stool, strumming his way through interminable 
versions of "Racing in the Street" and other dirgelike material. <br>
<br>
Fortunately, that's not what happened. At all. The show turned out to be
 a fan's fantasy, an emotional and sonically varied performance that 
used the partitioned arena space ingeniously. <br>
<br>
Springsteen played a grab bag of instruments (from piano to banjo), 
varying his deliveries to include drone and echo and percussive guitar, 
plus a surprising vocal range. Sometimes he even backed off the 
microphone so his voice could be as unamplified as possible, allowing a 
rare glimpse at the superstar's music in the buff. <br>
<br>
The concert took place over the course of about 120 minutes Saturday 
night at Philips Arena. By Sunday morning, the vigorous Springsteen fan 
site Backstreets (<a href="http://www.backstreets.com/" class="postlink">http://www.backstreets.com</a>) was already abuzz over the show's two world premieres, "Sad Eyes" and "Valentine's Day." <br>
<br>
There were other gems and surprises: "The Promised Land," "Lost in the 
Flood," "Darkness on the Edge of Town," a set-closing cover of Suicide's
 "Dream Baby Dream," a swirling and stomping "Reason To Believe," a 
Dylanesque "I'm on Fire" and a delicate "Nothing Man" dedicated to 
Springsteen's Atlanta-based producer, Brendan O'Brien. <br>
<br>
The spare arrangements gave listeners a direct connection with Springsteen's lyrics. <br>
<br>
A naturalist, his idea of moon/June/spoon is mud/blood/flood, and his 
strongest themes --- sin vs. salvation, hope vs. regret, idealism vs. 
realism --- came into sharp relief during (and between) the songs. <br>
<br>
"We got a hand that we burn with and a hand that we build with," 
Springsteen said, introducing the boxer's lament "The Hitter." "That's 
God's joke. Or maybe it's free will." <br>
<br>
Before the border-crossing tragedy "Matamoros Banks," he said, "What we 
need, instead of vigilantes across the border, is we need a humane 
immigration policy. We've got people dying just to cut the lawn." <br>
<br>
Some of Springsteen's most powerful material addressed spirituality. A 
divorced Catholic, he clearly has mixed feelings about religion --- and 
his ambiguities can make for compelling art. During his distorted blues 
take on "Reason to Believe," he swung an arm away from his body, and it 
was hard to tell if he was punching the air or making the sign of the 
cross, or both.</div>

The News &amp; Observer ,<br>
July 26, 2005<br>
By David Menconi<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen left no doubt that he wanted the crowd's cooperation 
for his solo show at Charlotte Coliseum. He came onstage, nodded at the 
applause and said, "The only thing I need tonight is as much quiet as I 
can get." That was one of the few appearances of Springsteen as himself.
 For the next two-plus hours, he played the battle-scarred soldier in 
"Devils &amp; Dust," the shellshocked observer of "Into the Fire," the 
broken-down boxer in "The Hitter." The show was spectacular, as 
multilayered a performance as imaginable for a one-man band. <br>
<br>
Like Springsteen's solo shows for "The Ghost of Tom Joad" a decade ago, 
Sunday's set concentrated on serious-minded songs. It was also 
consciously theatrical, with different lighting to accentuate each 
song's character and story. For "The River," what looked like cracked 
glass covered the backdrop to emphasize the broken lives described in 
the song. And the lighting on "The Rising" went from sunrise to sunset, 
with Springsteen backlit to cast a huge silhouette at the back end of 
the arena. <br>
<br>
The tour does feature expanded instrumentation, including keyboards on 
nearly half the songs. But one of its most amazing moments was stripped 
down to almost nothing -- a ghostly wailing harmonica, a static-filled 
vocal through a harmonica microphone and Springsteen's foot stomping out
 the beat on "Reason to Believe." It sounded like doom itself, as if 
Springsteen had summoned the ghost of Howlin' Wolf to come back from the
 dead and sing. <br>
<br>
That was but one of many ghosts Springsteen conjured. He occasionally 
backed away and sang off-mike to get more of an atmospheric effect. He 
also made frequent use of an ethereal, high lonesome wail of a falsetto,
 which sounded as if it had wafted in from another dimension. It came 
through like pure pain on "The Hitter" and pure bewilderment on "Two 
Faces." <br>
<br>
As before, Springsteen used the solo format to recast songs with 
inventive new arrangements. "The River" was a dramatic piano number, 
somewhere between jazz and gospel. "Jesus Was an Only Son" included 
spoken-word interludes about parenthood and sacrifice. And he turned 
"The Promised Land" into a prayerful eulogy to "blow away the lies that 
leave you nothing but lost and brokenhearted." <br>
<br>
After starting on a solemn note, Springsteen lightened the mood a bit 
with a middle segment of "Part Man, Part Monkey" and a rollicking "All 
I'm Thinkin' About," in which he appeared to be channeling Sam Cooke. 
But things quickly got serious again with "Highway Patrolman" (prefaced 
by a plug for the activist group People of Faith Against the Death 
Penalty) and "Reno," still the prettiest song ever about a tawdry 
encounter with a hooker. <br>
<br>
Other highlights included "Real World" (slowed way down from the 1992 
studio original), "Matamoros Banks" and "Racing in the Street." Try as 
it might, the crowd couldn't contain itself from whooping it up on the 
latter. But Springsteen didn't seem to mind. In fact, he was loose 
enough by the encore to make "Blinded by the Light" an audience 
sing-along. He even gave a sheepish grin to a bum note on "Wild Billy's 
Circus Story." That was about the only missed note of the night. <br>
<br>
If you're going to his show in Greensboro, you're in for a treat</div>

The Cincinnati Post ,<br>
August 2, 2005<br>
By Rick Bird<br>
<br>
The legendary Bruce Springsteen performed solo at the U.S. Bank Arena on
 Monday night, offering up a show filled with mixed emotions. <br>
<br>
He was both uplifting and depressing. Dark, yearning and spiritual. And maybe just a tad self- indulgent. <br>
<br>
A Bruce Springsteen solo show can leave many with mixed emotions. One 
wants to brood and muse, but also rock out. But that's why Springsteen 
is unique among pop performers - he can pull it all off. <br>
<br>
Springsteen played a nearly sold out U.S. Bank Arena on Monday night 
configured for a large theater setting, seating some 6,000. <br>
<br>
But this tour was a tough sell even for "The Boss." <br>
<br>
The 55-year-old Springsteen has entertained fans the last few years by 
tantalizing us with a reconvened E Street Band with its sweaty rock 'n' 
roll. <br>
<br>
Now he's back to solo and acoustic with a haunting new album, "Devils &amp; Dust." <br>
<br>
After last night's show casual fans could be heard saying, "I wish he'd 
rocked a little more." And the enigmatic Springsteen left even hard-core
 followers wondering, "What was that song?" <br>
<br>
This was Springsteen the troubadour, playing what he wants, messing with
 traditional arrangements and spreading subtle moral messages with a 
hint of political protest. <br>
<br>
And there was a touch of performance art, as in Springsteen's "Reason To
 Believe," complete with fuzzy, distorted guitars and synthesizers. Nice
 try Boss, but stick to the roots rock. <br>
<br>
And that he mostly did, reinventing his songs in earthy ways. <br>
<br>
"The Promised Land" - never been more moving and soulful. <br>
<br>
"The Promise" - who knew it could be this poignant a ballad? <br>
<br>
"The River" - a mournful song to begin with, and Springsteen turned it into a two-hanky tearjerker. <br>
<br>
But the hits were few and far between. <br>
<br>
Springsteen mostly relied on the obscure - a couple songs from his post 
9/11 album "The Rising," tunes from his recent release, and perhaps more
 "Tunnel of Love" selections than he has been playing on this tour. <br>
<br>
While Springsteen is rarely overtly political, he remains one of the few
 contemporary songwriters who can speak to the soul of American culture.
 <br>
<br>
He performed "The Rising" as a noble anthem saluting the strength of America's average folks in the face of diversity. <br>
<br>
He sang "Empty Sky" perhaps more intense than during the last full band tour. <br>
<br>
But his "Devils &amp; Dust" is a different album and so was his performance. <br>
<br>
The feel of the album is almost a reflection of the desperation and 
depression that the country has succumbed to sensing a war has gone 
wrong. <br>
<br>
He sang about the fears of the contemporary soldier on the title track 
in a song that eerily does for Iraqi vets what his "Born In the USA" did
 for the Vietnam generation - saluting the heroic troops, but expressing
 their frustration of being used by the politicians' rhetoric. <br>
<br>
Springsteen was at his moralistic best when he sang about family. <br>
<br>
His new "Jesus Was An Only Son," was performed at the piano filled with 
almost talking blues riffs as a sentimental reminder that it's 
ultimately about taking care of our own, even as the song takes some 
shots at the religious right. <br>
<br>
Springsteen gave a hilarious, relatable introduction talking about his 
own teenage kids ("They think you are intolerable idiots") as he sang 
his new, wonderful "Long Time Comin.'" <br>
<br>
Through it all Springsteen displayed his multi-instrumentalist talent, 
making for a much more engaging show that his last solo tour for "The 
Ghost of Tom Joad" when it was just the Boss and guitar. <br>
<br>
This time he showed he can pull off piano, pump organ and remains a solid harp player. <br>
<br>
Still this was a show for the die-hard fans, even challenging them. <br>
<br>
He opened with the completely obscure "Two For the Road," which loyal 
fans in the audience had to compare notes on, deciding it was a B-side 
to an '80's single, never on an album. <br>
<br>
The show was not without pretentiousness. <br>
<br>
Springsteen came on stage asking for quiet. Latecomers were not allowed to enter the hall until after the third song. <br>
<br>
Springsteen had to admonish the audience early on to "keep quiet if we are going to get music out of this."<br>
<br>
Photographers, and others, were warned in advance by the publicist to "bring their quietist camera and sound baffle." <br>
<br>
Yikes, when did rock 'n' roll turn into a church? <br>
<br>
Of course, Springsteen is one of the few artists who can pull off a 
quiet, indeed spiritual, show, but still hold true to the spirit of rock
 'n' roll. <br>
<br>
No, there was no E Street Band, but the Boss was as intense as ever and 
ultimately showed well-written songs sung with passionate urgency don't 
have to be played loud</div>
