				<div class="content">Hey Joad, Don't Make It Sad... (Oh, Go On Then)<br>
<br>
He's back, touring Europe. The Boss. But don't call him that. And no 
rocking in the aisles. In fact, just shut the f--- up and listen. For 
the goatee-chinned, Steinbeck-spouting, moribundly lyrical BRUCE 
SPRINGSTEEN has something to say. And it ain't necessarily purtty. GAVIN
 MARTIN talks gay icons, sobriety, reality and socks with the who would 
(not) be the King Of Rock. Boss hog: PENNIE SMITH<br>
<br>
<br>
He'll be remembered as the most unbounded performer in rock'n'roll 
history. His records took you inside a world of naked honesty and 
passionate conviction and his marathon shows were founded on deep 
audience empathy. But surely there must have been something else -- some
 tough-bastard instinct -- to get him where he wanted to be, to make him
 The Boss? <br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen laughs -- partly in amusement, partly in protest. "The
 Boss was an idiotic nickname. It's the bane of my entire career. I've 
learned to live with it but I've hated it y'know. Basically it was a 
casual thing. Somebody said it when the paychecks came out at the end of
 the month and then it ended up being this stupid thing -- in my mind 
anyway. But, hey, so it goes. <br>
<br>
"The thing is, I believed when I was young. I was a serious young man, I
 had serious ideas about rock music. I believed it was a serious thing, I
 believed it should also be fun -- dancing, screwing, having a good 
time, but... but I also believed it was capable of conveying serious 
ideas and that the people who listened to it, whatever you want to call 
them, were looking for something. <br>
<br>
"And maybe because it was the only culture I knew when I was 15, it 
succeeded as a tremendous source of inspiration for me for the entire 
part of my early life. It truly opened things up for me. <br>
<br>
"I heard tremendous depth and sadness in the voice of the singer singing
 'Saturday Night At The Movies', and a sense of how the world truly was,
 not how it was being explained to me, but how it *truly* was and how it
 truly operated. <br>
<br>
"So when it came to be my turn, I said, 'I want to try and present that 
and, if I can, then I'll feel like I'm doing more than taking up space, 
y'know?" <br>
<br>
He's not taking up so much space these days, not here in his modest 
dressing room backstage at the Rudi-Seimayer Halle in Munich. Not 
onstage, surrounded by a selection of three or four acoustic guitars and
 a shelf of harmonica holders on his first solo tour. Springsteen's 
sense of commitment to serious issues has never been tested so strongly 
nor proved so resolute as on this, his Born To Stand And Sitdown Tour, 
aka The Shut The F--- Up And Listen Tour. A natural progression from 
'The Ghost Of Tom Joad' - the starkest, most terrifying album of his 
career, released in November last year -- Springsteen's solo tour is 
currently heading across Europe after three months in America. <br>
<br>
He's been playing small venues, 2-4,000 seaters, many well of the normal
 circuit, re- establishing links with the local networks of food banks 
and agencies for the homeless, forged during his megastar years. But now
 the clamour is less frantic and the aims more focused. That's how he 
wants it to be; a reflection of the world-weariness and sense of 
fatalism that informs 'Tom Joad'. <br>
<br>
In Detroit, Bruce talked onstage about a year-long local newspaper 
dispute and, although he made a donation to the strikers, was careful 
not to make moral judgments about those forced by circumstances to cross
 the picket lines. Then the day he played in Austin, Texas, a city- wide
 ordinance which effectively made it a criminal offence to be homeless 
came into effect. In Atlanta, the city's relief organisations told of 
the pressure that local business interests were putting on police and 
politicians to clean the vagrants off the streets in preparation for the
 summer's Olympics. <br>
<br>
And when he played in Youngstown, Ohio, the depression-hit, 
population-decimated steel town featured in the eponymous song that 
gives voice to all those deemed expendable by late 20th-century American
 capitalism, they say you hear the very heartbeat of the place pulsing 
inside the hall when he sang their song. <br>
<br>
Springsteen says there's no substitute for going to the town where 
someone lives and playing to them. He says there's nothing that can 
match actually being there. This is, after all, a performer who keeps in
 touch with his fans -- and their mothers. Like the woman he met back in
 1981 after going to a cinema in St Louis. <br>
<br>
"That particular evening was funny because I saw "Stardust Memories," 
the Woody Allen film where he was knocking his fans. The kid sitting 
next to me said, 'Hey, is that what you think?' and I said 'No'. I was 
by myself, I was in St Louis and it was 10 pm. He said, 'Come on home 
and meet my mother and she'll make you something to eat.' <br>
<br>
"That to me was part of the fun of being me -- people asked you to step 
into their lives out of nowhere. It was always fun, interesting and 
fascinating. I just saw this kid's mother a couple of weeks ago in St 
Louis. I still see her, she's come to every show for 15 years. She comes
 backstage, gives you something to eat and a kiss. Her son's a lawyer 
now. <br>
<br>
"I liked that. Part of what I liked about my job was that I could step 
out of my hotel, walk down the street and some nights you could just get
 lost and you'd meet somebody and they'd take you into their life and it
 was just sort of... I don't know, a way of connecting with things." <br>
<br>
In Munich. as with every other show, there's a polite announcement 
before the performance, reiterating what Springsteen has already told 
the local press -- silence is an integral part of much of the music 
he'll be playing, and audience co-operation is appreciated. Shortly into
 his set he puts it rather more bluntly: "Yes, folks, this is a 
community event so if anybody near you is making too much noise why not 
all band together and politely tell them to SHUT THE F--- UP!" <br>
<br>
The rapt attention and reaction over two nights on Munich and Hamburg 
suggests that the qualities being appreciated aren't just the lyrics, 
but the poetic inflections in Springsteen's voice, the feel for his 
characters' cadences and rhythms of speech; the way each breath, sigh, 
pant or moan is heard and made to count. <br>
<br>
Years ago, Springsteen told an interviewer he was 'a nuts-and-bolts sort
 of guy', who wouldn't make his mark in a mercurial flash of brilliance,
 but gradually over a long '20 to 25-year' haul. The 'Tom Joad' tour, 
allowing him to expand the artistry of his voice and the eloquence of 
his guitar-playing as never before, bears the fruits of this approach. 
But that's not to say the new shows are solely a dark ride. The ripe 
friskiness of a horny, middle-aged male who has become a father three 
times since his 40th birthday is well in evidence in introductions to 
'It's The Little Things That Count' and 'Sell It And They Will Come' -- 
unrecorded songs about his own "squalid little sexual fantasies." <br>
<br>
A compelling blend of good-natured showman and dedicated artist, 
Springsteen is obviously aware of the value of contrast. SO the jocular 
banter between songs just goes to highlight the depth of torment and 
heartbreak at the core of the show -- be it a wicked Delta-blues 
reworking of 'Born In The USA', the lost-tether confession of 'Highway 
29', the awesome unreleased 'Joad' outtake, 'Brothers Under The Bridge' 
or the violated innocence of the kids in 'Balboa Park'. <br>
<br>
The impression of a man at ease with himself and his new, lowlier rank 
in the Celebrity Freak Show is apparent when we meet backstage, some 15 
minutes after his final encore in Hamburg. Springsteen is short and 
stocky, polite and deferential. With his goatee beard and receding hair 
pulled back into what's not so much a ponytail as a sparrow's cock, he 
looks not unlike a guy who might change your oil or check your tyres in 
any western town. <br>
<br>
Then, when he grins and his face creases, he reminds you of Robert De 
Niro -- another hardworking Italian-American whose art has centred on 
struggles of the soul and obsessional behaviour. <br>
<br>
In conversation, Springsteen is given to a lot of self-mocking 
chuckling, but just as likely he'll slip into a long, slow, deliberating
 drawl, restarting and revising his meanings; a painstaking approach not
 dissimilar to the one that has produced the bulk of his recorded 
output. <br>
<br>
He puts his "limited repertoire" of poses into operation for a short 
photo session, with the proviso that his sock aren't showing. <br>
<br>
"That's the only rule I have about photos and I'm very strict about it," he grins.<br>
<br>
The photographer mentions Nick Cave and Springsteen interrupts: "Oh, he 
probably has great socks -- he insists you show his socks, am I right?" <br>
<br>
Photo session over, he serves up two glasses of Jack Daniel's and ice. 
Undoing the belt around his pleated pants he attempts -- unsuccessfully 
-- to open a bottle of Corona. Then he opens the door and pries off the 
bottle top using the lock-keep, but the beer froths up over his trousers
 and shirt. <br>
<br>
"That's the trouble with doing it this way," he says, navigating a quick detour into the shower room. <br>
<br>
Finally, lager-stained but ready, Springsteen sits down, resting his 
drinks on the coffee table beside a silver bill-fold, holding some 
Deutschmarks, an expensive watch and a biker's key ring. Ninety minutes 
later, Bruce -- who admits that he used to drink but "only for effect" 
-- still hasn't touched either his brew or his Jack. <br>
<br>
Have you been working up to a solo tour for a long time? <br>
<br>
"I've thought about it since 'Nebraska', but 'Nebraska' sort of happened
 by accident. A planned kind of accident, but enough of an accident that
 I didn't really think that was something I was going to tour with. I 
thought about it again when I did 'Tunnel Of Love', but 'Tunnel Of Love'
 was in between a group record and a solo record, and I still couldn't 
quite imagine going out onstage by myself at that point. <br>
<br>
"We did rehearsals where it was just me and a sit-down band and -- I 
hate to use the word -- an unplugged-style show. That didn't feel right,
 if there's a band on stage, people are going to want you to go, 'One, 
two, three, four, y'know? So we ended up putting a big tour together. <br>
<br>
"So when 'Tom Joad' came about I thought, 'This is the chance to do 
something I've been waiting to do for a while.' Also, I wanted an 
alternative to touring with a band and all that that involves. I've done
 it for a long time and I felt like, at best if I got out there with a 
band I'd only have something half new to say, because, if you're there 
with a group of people, automatically you're gonna want to hear, A, B 
and C. <br>
<br>
"Really, the bottom line is that, through the '90s, the voice I've 
found, the voice that's felt the most present and vital for me, had 
basically been a folk voice. It really hasn't been my rock voice. <br>
<br>
"I was originally signed as a folk singer and so it's a funny sort of 
thing. John Hammond [the late legendary CBS talent scout who signed 
Billie Holiday, Bob Dylan and Bruce] would be laughing right now, 
because he was always saying to me, 'You should make an album with just a
 guitar.' <br>
<br>
"When Jonathan Demme [director of 'Philadelphia'] asked for the song 
('Streets Of Philadelphia'] he focused me outward and then working with 
the band did the same thing because they are the living manifestation of
 the community I write about. <br>
<br>
"Musicians are funny. When you're home, you're never a real connected 
part of your own community, so you create one of your own. So I created 
the band and that was your family and that was the living manifestation 
of whatever community you imagine and sing about, and I think that's 
what they were to my fans. I think that's what they represented and 
that's why the band has power and why it is important and has been 
important. <br>
<br>
"That sense of friendship, loyalty, everybody's different but somehow 
together; that's why the whole idea of the band has always been a 
central idea of rock music; that's why bands keep coming. Whether it's 
the brothers in Oasis or whoever, everybody's fascinated because IT 
FEELS LIKE REAL LIFE. People trying to make it, to get together and do 
something together. That's why bands are powerful." <br>
<br>
Do you follow young bands? <br>
<br>
"Not that much, I hear things in passing. Occasionally I'll go out and 
do a lot of curiosity- buying. Since the early '80s, my musical 
influences... they've been ultimately more... I sort of fought back in a
 way. There was Hank Williams and some of the blues guys and folk guys, 
but films and writers and novels have probably been the primary 
influences on my work.." <br>
<br>
On the album sleeve and onstage monologues, you're quite specific that 
it's the John Ford film, rather than the Steinbeck book of "The Grapes 
of Wrath" that inspired 'Tom Joad'. <br>
<br>
"That's the way it happened, that's what I saw first. Then I read the 
novel, which is incredible. I recently re-read it, and you have that 
beautiful last scene. The book ends on a singular act of human kindness 
or compassion -- the entire book leads to that point. That had a lot of 
meaning for me at the moment I re-read it because I was searching for a 
way to go beyond broad platitudes or whatever you want to call them. <br>
<br>
"I was looking for a way to make whatever light there is in the world 
feel real now. So I found myself turning at the end of my record to one 
person making one decision. I think the things I use to bring some light
 into the show are those types of things, that's why I play 'Spare 
Parts' and 'Galveston Bay'. To me, those things are possible, those are 
things that... any individual at your show can walk out of the building 
and can lead the next day with that idea or that possibility." <br>
<br>
Did therapy affect your most recent writing? <br>
<br>
"Nah, that had more affect on my life and the choices that I had; it 
gave me more control in the way I could live my life. Early on, when I 
was younger, I could only live my life in one way, it was the only way I
 knew. I was locked into a very specific and pretty limited mode of 
behaviour. It was basically the road, I had no capability for a home 
life or an ability to develop anything more than a glancing 
relationship." <br>
<br>
Did you feel something happening to you at the time? <br>
<br>
"No, you're 25 and you don't know anything that's happening to you. All 
you know is that things are rushing by. At the time I felt like -- this 
is the race." <br>
<br>
As a rock'n'roll athlete, Springsteen may be unique -- there's never been any account of him having taken a drug, for instance. <br>
<br>
"No, I never did." <br>
<br>
Yet your songs suggest someone well aware of self-destructive urges. <br>
<br>
"I've had many self-destructive urges but they've never worked 
themselves out in the drug area. I've had a funny experience in that I 
didn't do any drugs; I've never done any drugs. It's not about having 
any moral point of view about drugs whatsoever -- I know nothing about 
them. I didn't do them for my own reasons, which were probably... I 
didn't trust myself into putting myself that far out of control. I had a
 fear of my own internal life. <br>
<br>
"I lived in a house where I experienced out-of-controlness and I didn't 
like it. I suppose I had fears that that was going to be me if I do A, 
B, C, D or E. <br>
<br>
"I was round very many people who did many drugs and I can't 
particularly say I liked any of them when they were stoned or high, for 
the most part. Either they were being a pain in the ass or 
incomprehensible. That's my experience -- so it didn't interest me. <br>
<br>
"Also, at a very young age, I became very focused on music and 
experienced a certain sort of ecstasy, actually, through playing. It was
 just something I loved doing." <br>
<br>
But you did take oxygen blasts between sets during your stadium shows? <br>
<br>
"I suppose so, if necessary," he laughs. <br>
<br>
Those were the days when he was The Boss. A near-superhuman creation, 
trailing anything up to a four-hour extravaganza of euphoria, shaggy-dog
 monologues, stories with a bittersweet twist, clowning, death ballads 
and hard-won heroics. The extended victory march by the man who wanted 
the heart and soul of the music to rage long into the night. Can he 
imagine doing it ever again? <br>
<br>
"I don't know. I can certainly imagine playing with the band again. I 
don't know if I'd play for that particular length of time at this point.
 I mean, I certainly *could*, but I believe I might want to create a 
more focused show if I went out. <br>
<br>
"But it's very tricky because I had the same thought the last time I 
went out, probably the last five times, then all of a sudden you're 
looking at the clock and three hours have gone by. So y'know, I'd have 
to get there and see. <br>
<br>
"As far as the other stuff goes, it was really I had a lot of fuel. I 
always felt the E Street powering me. We had a lot of *desperate* fun; I
 think that's what gave the fun, that the band presented an edge, 
y'know. There were always two sides to that particular band, there was a
 lot of dark material and yet there was this explosion of actual joy; 
real, real happiness -- whether it was being alive or being with your 
friends or the audience on a given night. That was real but it was the 
devil-on-your-heels sort of fun -- laughing and running, you know what I
 mean?" <br>
<br>
Did things change when Patti Scialfa [long-time New Jersey musician and,
 since 1991, the second and -- he's sure -- last Mrs Springsteen] 
joined? <br>
<br>
"When Patti joined, I wanted the band to be more representative of my 
audience -- I said, 'Hey, we need a woman in the band!' I saw the band 
as representative of myself. We were all in our mid-30s and I said, 
'It's time to deal with these ideas. The band as a lost boys club is a 
great institution -- the level of general misogyny and hostility and the
 concept of it as always being a place where you can hide from those 
things.' But I wanted to change that, I didn't want to do it." <br>
<br>
What changed you? <br>
<br>
"Just getting older, you know, and realising, like the old days -- you 
can run but you can't hide. At some point, if you're not trying to 
resolve these things then you are going to live a limited life. Maybe 
you're high as a kite and it doesn't matter to you, I dunno. But 
ultimately it is going to be a life of limited experience -- at least 
that's what it felt like to me. <br>
<br>
"Not only did I want to experience it all -- love, closeness, whatever 
you want to call it, or just inclusion. To create a band that felt 
inclusive -- someone would look and say. 'Hey, that's me!' That's what 
bands do. That's why people come and why your power is sustained: 
because people recognise you, themselves, and the world they live in." <br>
<br>
You didn't really start writing about sex until the 'Tunnel Of Love' album. Why had you avoided it until then? <br>
<br>
"I hadn't avoided sex, but I'd avoided writing about it. It was just 
confusing for the first 30 or 35 years of my life. Whatever you're 
caught up in -- you know, you're traveling round with the guys, and 
women are sort of on the periphery. By the time I was in my mid-30s that
 wasn't acceptable any more. I didn't want to be some 50-year-old guy 
out there with the boys. It seemed like it was going to be boring. 
Boring and kinda tragic." <br>
<br>
On 'Lucky Town" you sang, "It's a sad, funny ending when you find 
yourself pretending/A rich man in a poor man's shirt." On 'Tom Joad' the
 metaphor is more explicit: you're a land-owning Californian 
millionaire, writing about welfare rejects, illegal immigrant drug- 
runners and child prostitutes -- people as far removed from you on a 
socio-economic scale as is possible. Is that what writing is about? 
Making connections that aren't supposed to be possible? <br>
<br>
"The point is, take the children that are in 'Balboa Park', those are 
your kids, that's what I'm trying to say. It's like, I've got mine, 
you've got yours and these are kids, too. As a writer, I've been drawn 
to those subjects, for personal reasons, I'm sure. I don't have some big
 idea. I don't feel like I have some enormous political message I'm 
trying to deliver. I think my work has come from the inside. I don't 
start from the outside -- 'I have a statement I want to make, ladies and
 gentlemen!', I don't do that. I don't like the soap-box thing, so I 
begin internally with things that matter to me personally and maybe were
 a part of my life in some fashion. <br>
<br>
"I lived in a house where there was a lot of struggle to find work, 
where the results of not being able to find your place in society 
manifested themselves with the resulting lack of self-worth, with anger,
 with violence. <br>
<br>
"And, as I grew up, I said, 'Hey, that's my song', because, I don't 
know, maybe that was my experience at a very important moment in my 
life. And those ideas, those questions, those issues were things I've 
written about my entire career. I still feel very motivated by them and I
 still probably do my best work when I'm working inside of those things,
 which must be because that's where I'm connected. That's just the 
lights I go by." <br>
<br>
Did you do any research to amass the material and detail that features in 'Tom Joad'? <br>
<br>
"Things happen from all over the place. I met a guy in Arizona who told 
me a story about his brother who rode in a teenage motorcycle gang in 
the San Freehand Valley, called the Verges. I just happened to meet this
 guy by the side of the road in this little motel. I don't know, it just
 stayed with me for a very long time and when I went to write it, I kept
 hearing his voice. <br>
<br>
"If you're in Los Angeles, there's an enormous amount of border news. 
Immigration and border life is a big part of the town. That's part of 
what I've gotten from being in California every year, for half the year,
 for the last five years. It's a very, very powerful place; a place 
where issues that are alive and confronting America are happening at 
this moment. It represents what the country is turning into; a place 
where you see the political machinations of how the issue of immigration
 is being used, and a lot of the bullshit that goes down with it. It's 
just the place that, ready or not, America is going to become." <br>
<br>
Your reputation has always been of someone who is incredibly prolific 
and gives away as many good songs as you keep for yourself. Have you 
ever had a period when you haven't been able to write? <br>
<br>
"Well, if I was *that* prolific I'd have put out more records. I suppose
 there's prolific in writing a lot of songs and there's prolific in 
writing a lot of *good* songs! I've written plenty of songs, but to me a
 lot of them didn't measure up because I wrote with purpose. My idea 
wasn't to get the next ten songs and put out an album and get out on the
 road. I wrote with purpose in mind, so I edited very intensely the 
music I was writing. So when I felt there was a collection of songs that
 had a point of view, that was when I released a record. For the most 
part I didn't release a record until I felt like it, because I didn't 
think my fundamental goal was to have hit records. I had an idea, 
y'know, and following the thread of that idea, when I thought I had 
something that would be valuable to my fans, something enjoyable, 
something entertaining, something that wouldn't waste their time when I 
put a record out. I could have put out a whole lot more casual records 
but, at the time, you're honing an identity of some sort." <br>
<br>
An image? <br>
<br>
"Image? Sort of, I suppose. That's part of it to some degree, but that's like the top part -- the frothy stuff." <br>
<br>
Did you ever have a big gay following? <br>
<br>
"Not to my knowledge." <br>
<br>
There was always something very camp about that grease-monkey- 
baseball-hat-in-the-back- pocket look during 'Born In The USA'... <br>
<br>
"It was probably my own fault. Who knows, I was probably working out my 
own insecurities, y'know? That particular image is probably the only 
time I look back over pictures of the band and it feels like a 
caricature to me. <br>
<br>
"Everything before and after that is just people, but that particular 
moment I always go, 'Jeez', y'know? I couldn't tell you what that was 
about. <br>
<br>
"All I could tell you was, when I wrote 'Streets Of Philadelphia' and I 
had some contact with gay people, who the song had meant something to, I
 felt the image that I had at that time could have been misinterpreted, 
y'know? That is something that I regretted and still do regret, to some 
degree. <br>
<br>
"But I think, at the same time, it must have been an easy image to latch
 onto. Maybe it had something to do with why it was powerful or what it 
represented. But it was very edgy to me and very close to -- if it 
wasn't already -- over-simplification. It was certainly over- simplified
 if you just saw the image and didn't go to the show and get a sense of 
where it was coming from and what it was about. It had implications that
 I didn't tune into at the time and I don't really feel are a 
fundamental part of my work." <br>
<br>
Is there an element of surrealism playing at the Rock'N'Roll Hall Of 
Fame and finding yourself standing beside the real, living, breathing 
heroes you once worshipped from a distance? <br>
<br>
"Yeah, one night I was standing between George Harrison and Mick Jagger 
and y'know, I sat in my room with their records, I learned to play my 
guitar from those records. I studied every riff and the way they played 
it and my initial bands were modelled on them. So there's always a 
little bit of, 'Hey, what am I doing here?' You realise there were 
millions and millions of kids at that time that had that particular 
fantasy or whatever you want to call it. <br>
<br>
"But I'm sort of glad I have a place generationally, where I get to 
stand with those people onstage. It's a tremendous source of pleasure 
being able to back up Chuck Berry, one of the great American writers, a 
GREAT American writer. He captured an essential part of the country in a
 fashion that no one has done before or since." <br>
<br>
Are you sad that his creative life as a writer lasted for such a short period? <br>
<br>
"That's just the way it goes. I have no idea how people's creative 
instincts work. I'm just glad for the work he's done. It was very 
influential in my work in the sense that there was a lot of detail in 
the writing, fundamental images I carried into my own music. <br>
<br>
"That's the course of rock music. It's very unusual to be 20 or 25 years
 down the line and still be doing vital work. I think the reason is, it 
takes an enormous leap of faith at the time of your success, a leap of 
consciousness, and the ability to suss out what is essential and what is
 bullshit is very important. <br>
<br>
"Money comes in -- great! We can let the good times roll, we can have 
fun with it. But if you start out and get caught up in the idea that 
these things are going to sustain you in some fashion when you get 20 
years down the road, you're gonna be in for a surprise. <br>
<br>
"Right now, I don't need records that are Number One. I don't need to 
sell records that are going to make millions. I need to do work that I 
feel is central, vital, that sets me in the present, where I don't have 
to come out at night and depend upon my history or a song I wrote 20 
years ago. What I'm interested in doing now is finding my place in the 
world as it stands. That to me is what is vital and sustains you and 
gives you the commitment and motivation to tour and stand behind your 
work. That's all I know, 20 or 25 years down the line." <br>
<br>
Is there a sense of fear attached to what you do? <br>
<br>
"Of course, that's part of everything. I think if there is a fear, it's a
 fear of slipping out of things. By that I don't mean the mainstream of 
the music business. This particular record, I knew when I put it out it 
wasn't going to be on the radio very much and it wasn't! Fundamentally, 
it wasn't going to be part of what the mainstream music business is 
today, in the States anyway." <br>
<br>
We've all seen "Spinal Tap," with the idea of an audience becoming more selective. <br>
<br>
"[Laughs] I guess there's the sense that you are protective over your 
artistic life and creative impetus, your creative instinct, your 
creative vitality. That's something I've known since I was tearing the 
posters down in 1975 [on his first visit to Britain, Springsteen went on
 the rampage, tearing down posters outside Hammersmith Odeon proclaiming
 him 'the future of rock'n'roll'] and it's something I still feel real 
strongly about today." <br>
<br>
Are there moments when you've surprised or disappointed yourself? <br>
<br>
"You're always doing that. You look back and say, 'I did that well, I 
didn't do that, I communicated well here but not there.' It's just 
endless, y'know? That's the idea, that's why you've always got some 
place to go tomorrow, something to do now. That's why this particular 
music is not a rock show, it's not unplugged, it's something else. I 
don't even know if I should call it a folk show. In a funny way, the 
songs are based in rock music, but I suppose it's based around the new 
record. It's not a night where I come out and play hits or favourite 
songs you wanna hear. There's no pay-off at the end of the night with 
those things. It is what it is and that's my intent." <br>
<br>
Is your ongoing work a reaction and extension of the work you've done in the past? <br>
<br>
"Of course, because the artist's job, in my opinion, is to try and 
answer the questions that your body of work throws up, or at least pose 
new questions. With this record, that's what I'm trying to do. <br>
<br>
"I felt for ten years I put a lot of those questions on hold because I 
was writing about other things, I was having some reaction to the 'Born 
In The USA' experience, because I was finding my way through a new life,
 in some sense." <br>
<br>
On the sleevenote to your 'Hits' collection you describe 'Born To Run' 
as your shot at the title, a 25-year-old's attempt to craft "the 
greatest record ever made". How do you feel about it today? <br>
<br>
"Oh, I don't know, I can't listen to it objectively, it's too caught up 
in my life. I don't sit around listening to my work, I'd be insane if I 
did, I'd be crazy. I like it as a record but, right now, it's hard for 
me to hear it because it's caught up with so many other things. <br>
<br>
"It's a really good song. the way I would record it now would be a lot 
different, probably not as good, because I would be afraid of going over
 the top, and there's a moment to go completely over the top and push 
the edge of things."<br>
<br>
Your relationship with 'Born In The USA' is like Dylan's with 'Like A 
Rolling Stone', trying to grasp back the song's real meaning rather than
 allowing it to become a faceless anthem. It wasn't just Ronald Reagan 
(who tried to claim it as an effective endorsement of his jingoistic 
agenda) who misinterpreted the song. <br>
<br>
"The record of it I still feel is very good and I wouldn't change it or 
want it to be different. I wouldn't want the version that I'm doing now 
to have come out at that time. At that particular moment, it was how I 
heard it and it happened in a couple of takes. <br>
<br>
"You put your music out and it comes back to you in a variety of 
different ways through your audience. But a songwriter always has the 
opportunity to go out and reclarify or reclaim his work; it pushes you 
to be inventive. I think the version I have now... for me, at least, 
it's the best version I've done of the song, I suppose it's the truest, 
y'know. It's got it all -- everything it needs to be understood at the 
moment." <br>
<br>
You write a lot about killers -- people like the death-row inmate played
 by Sean Penn in _Dead Man Walking_ [Springsteen's title song for the 
Tim Robbins-directed movie has just been Oscar-nominated] and the slayer
 in 'Nebraska'. Have you ever met a real-life killer? Is it necessary to
 do your job right? <br>
<br>
"No, you're not trying to recreate the experience, your trying to 
recreate the emotions and the things that went into the action being 
taken. Those are things that everyone understands, those are things that
 everyone has within them. The action is the symptom, that's what 
happened, but the things that caused that action to happen, that's what 
everyone knows about -- you know about it, I know about it. It's inside 
of every human being. <br>
<br>
"Those are the things you gotta mine, that's the well that you gotta dip
 into and, if you're doing that, you're going to get something central 
and fundamental about those characters." <br>
<br>
So it's just coincidence that you currently look like the character Sean Penn plays in the movie? <br>
<br>
"I do? I didn't realise that. Help! I'm going home... I don't have as much hair as he does, for a start."</div>

WUNAW-FM , 1992-08-07<br>
By<br>
DJ: What were the factors that went in to you deciding to open up the U.S. tour here in New Jersey? <br>
<br>
BS: Actually, I think it was Jon's idea. (laughter) At the time, I was 
really busy just putting the band together and he has kind of putting 
the tour together. I know he mentioned that we should go to Europe 
because it had become a really good place for us over there and he said,
 hey, let's start right at home......and I said that sounds good.... 
great idea. <br>
<br>
DJ: More pressure playing at home than starting somewhere in the mid-west? <br>
<br>
BS:	Yea, yea.....you know you always want to be at your best....it's 
such a.....my history here and it's just filled with a lot of resonance 
and a lot of complicated things and I think that when you come home you 
sort of always want to, you know, you always look....you want your best 
night to be that first night when you're back in town. It worked out 
really perfectly. I guess we went over to Europe and we had a real 
chance to kind of wind out the band and get everything feeling really 
good and by the time we hit here opening night....I think the opening 
night was probably one of the best opening nights I've ever had in my 
life. The intensity of the audience....just the emotion coming from the 
crowd....it was fantastic. It probably was one of the most satisfying 
nights of playing that I think I have ever had...ever had. (lead-in to 
song "Local Hero"). <br>
<br>
DJ:	 I was just wondering about the expectations that the audience must of had? <br>
<br>
BS:	 That's what makes it fun. The whole thing...there is an element of like......suspense!!?? (laughter) <br>
<br>
DJ: You could say...in one word. <br>
<br>
BS:	Yea, yea. I think I had been away for a long time, I hadn't played 
in a long time, you have a different band and your life's changed a lot.
 There was a lot of skepticism in the air and so it's something where 
there was a really charged moment. I felt relaxed because I knew that I 
had done the work, put the time in, both with the band and with the 
music that we had, and with the show itself. I had a real...I had a 
very, very focused idea about where I was coming from right now, which 
I've always had, so I wasn't concerned in the sense like, gee, I'm not 
sure what I'm doing. I knew exactly what I was doing at this particular 
point in my career or in my work and in my life. So, I felt real 
comfortable with it. Then you put it out there and I felt confident that
 the show we had was something that would reach people...I felt it would
 communicate. <br>
<br>
DJ:	 Do you feel like you accomplished your mission? <br>
<br>
BS:	You know, I had a certain way of doing things for a long, long time.
 I've played very, very hard for a lot of years. I guess we hadn't been 
around in awhile and there was a moment when people kind of came out and
 said, gee, are you still there, are you still going to speak to me, are
 you still talking to me? Sort of a moment when...oh, basically, what it
 is after not having played for four years...you have to reacquaint 
yourself with your audience and with that own part of yourself that's 
involved in going out and playing and exposing yourself but it was a 
real happy.....(lead-in to "I'm a Rocker"). <br>
<br>
DJ:	Was it a conscious statement to start with three new songs as opposed to going back with something else? <br>
<br>
BS:	Well, yes, the whole thing is for the most part...the shows here 
have varied a lot just because I tend to....I've kept the basic 
structure for all the shows here but we've come up with a couple of 
different tunes each night. I tend to pull some of the older stuff 
out...its kind of like playing for all of your relatives and 
friends...let's pull this one out and see how....I wanted the show to be
 set in the present, that's where my new music is coming from. It's 
something that I'm the proudest of and I feel that it's stuff that plays
 real well on stage...it rocks and kicks...it's as good as anything I've
 ever done and I wanted to contexturize(?) whatever I was doing in the 
here and now. I think we had "Born in the USA" up in the set in Europe 
for awhile but after we hit London, it became obvious that we would 
start the show out with the new stuff for awhile. <br>
<br>
DJ:	It's kind of a good statement that these are better days, too (lead-in to "Better Days"). <br>
<br>
DJ:	What do you feel are the songs that are going down the best live? What are the most rewarding for you and <br>
what are the ones that get the best reaction, as you see it? <br>
<br>
BS:	So far, everything seems to going down pretty well (laughter). It's 
hard to...you might be able to tell better if you're out in the 
audience. I think that the crowd we've had every night here has 
been...I'd be hard pressed to just pull ...to favor one over another....
 <br>
<br>
DJ:	I'd have to say there's a moment in the concert that seems to just really do it...that's when you do "Leap of <br>
Faith", when you break that barrier.... <br>
<br>
BS:	Yea, yea. That song....that's been going down real well. First of 
all, it's real simple, it has a good chorus and its kind of....I guess, 
maybe, if I had to pull one song out and say, ok what.....that might be 
the song that is sort of most directly expressing where I am at .... at 
the moment (laughter) (lead-in to "Leap of Faith") <br>
<br>
DJ:	Opening night you mentioned California and there were boos. (Bruce 
laughing). And you handled it great -- get it out....vent it. Were you 
expecting it? <br>
<br>
BS:	 (Much laughter) Sure, of course. If was funny...it was great? it 
was like that's how old friends should...that's how it should 
be....people should boo here, cheer here... whatever they feel. You 
know, I guess my feeling was...it was just funny...actually it was a 
great moment because it was a moment where a lot of tension was released
 and everybody seemed to get real comfortable with each other after 
that. It was fun...like...yea, go ahead and that's why it was a great 
night. Because it was a complicated night...there was a lot of 
complicated feelings in the room but underneath it, I felt a tremendous 
sense of just real emotion and people just sort of.... <br>
<br>
DJ:	The other moment I think came in "Born to Run" with the sax solo when Crystal did it. Did you feel that too? <br>
<br>
BS:	(laughter) Yea, oh yea...she can play it. (Lead-in to "Born to Run") <br>
<br>
DJ:	There seems to be...you've always had some kind of religious 
references throughout your music. There's also a gospel feel because 
you've got the great singers there, and all of that. It seems this time 
out you're embracing religion more than...before you use to sort of 
distance yourself. <br>
<br>
BS:	I'm not particularly....I don't have any sort of orthodox religious 
beliefs really or anything like that. I think I probably used some of 
the words and the imagery to express whatever spiritual feeling that I 
feel just from life itself. I don't have any...I think I said one 
time...to me it's all the empty holes and things, that's where the real 
spirituality is and when you start having to block everything out and 
say this is the reason for that and this is why we're here, it becomes 
an attempt to control things that are beyond you and, for me, it's...I 
guess I was reaching in this particular music for some sense of 
religious things or what people have come to call religious things or 
spiritual things or whatever you want to call them. It's 
definitely...that feeling is definitely in the show but it's not...I 
don't have any particular orthodox idea about things. (Lead-in to "Saint
 in the City"). <br>
<br>
BS:	It's sort of just life...in enjoying and finding things that give 
your life meaning...that fill your life out and finding things that 
connect you up with the future and give you also a sense of your past. 
Kids definitely to that and it all just kind of comes out of living on 
just a really sort of everyday kind of basis. <br>
<br>
DJ:	You seem happier than you've ever been. Is that an accurate statement? <br>
<br>
BS:	Yea! Things have come around really well for me. It took a lot of 
work but at the moment I have a certain sort of balance in my life that I
 hadn't had in the past and hopefully it's been able to also broaden 
what I have to say on stage at night to the people that come out. 
(Lead-in to "Living Proof") <br>
<br>
DJ:	Were you ever worried that it could have the opposite effect...that 
artists sometimes when they are happy aren't as productive artistically?
 <br>
<br>
BS:	I don't buy that. I really don't buy all that stuff. To me there are
 always those sorts of cliches about art and artists and rock musicians 
and what's this and that. I don't believe that...usually by the time 
you're 42 or probably by the time you're l8, you've endured enough pain 
in your life to remember it forever. (laughter) It's like...that's 
always there and you're always kind of pulling from your whole self and 
so those things are always there. Just because you find a certain kind 
of peace or certain sort of fulfillment.... Hey, all the fear and doubts
 and those things are just a part of the human condition. You never lose
 that, so I think for me I found a real...just in trying to get some 
sort of balance in my life I found a really resourceful place and I 
found it was a place where I could go and get some real deep water from 
the well and have a new song to sing to the people. I really don't buy 
the whole suffering artist...like I said, everybody suffered plenty...it
 never goes away, I guess. But I found a lot of inspiration in...be 
happy is too one dimensional, but in trying to fill out my life it sort 
of felt like I was really here. (Lead-in to "With Every Wish") <br>
<br>
DJ:	Compare opening night here to that time you were about to go on 
stage at the Bottom Line for our broadcast in l975... that's like almost
 l7 years ago. <br>
<br>
BS:	(laughter) I can't remember it and no one else can either...so it 
doesn't matter. It was an exciting night..it was just one of those 
nights when you felt like...mmmmmmm, I think something is 
happening...I'm not sure what but you knew you wanted to be good. But 
this was a big night, our first night we had here. I think probably for 
me it was the most...if I had to pick a night from how many dates...if I
 had to pick one where I wanted us to be at our best, it would have been
 that night, you know. There was just a lot in the air....a lot in the 
air. <br>
<br>
DJ:	You just talked one on one with the audience. I know your music says
 it but without us here people that didn?t see you on the ll nights.....
 that won't get to see you, is there anything you want to say to them? <br>
<br>
BS:	At this point, I've been doing what I'm doing for 20 years or just 
about...making records for 20 years. I just appreciate people hanging in
 with you and, hey, I've been working my hardest to come up with 
something that feels real and new...like I said...to have a new song to 
sing. Because I always believe that people don't really listen to my 
music to find out about me, they listen to my music to find out about 
themselves. I guess all I have to say is that we've had a tremendous 
time here and I appreciate everybody's support that I've gotten and felt
 over the years and we're just kind of out there kicking it as hard as 
we can and thanks. We will continue to do so. Just want to say thanks to
 everybody and everybody that came down to the shows...we really 
appreciate it. Thank you very much and we are just going to keep on.</div>

...may feel a few knives in it these days. 1992's albums met with mixed 
responses, and questions were raised over the live shows. With British 
summer dates on the horizon, Springsteen considers the way forward for 
the 1990s<br>
Vox , 1993-03<br>
By Bill Flanagan<br>
<br>
"It's a big change," says Springsteen, legs swinging casually off the 
edge of yet another stadium stage. Behind him the band that escorted The
 Boss back to his people in 1992 is finishing one more sound check in 
one more cavernous American shed. On the horizon, the tour dates trickle
 into another year, and behind the backline with Patti Scialfa is 
attending to their two-year-old son, Evan. He's wearing protective ear 
muffs. <br>
<br>
The change Springsteen refers to, as he looks past 1992 to the year 
ahead, is this new way of travelling adopted by the world's biggest 
local hero. En famille. Much testy comment was passed on Patti's 
contributions to the concerts last year, largely by critics who seemed 
to take Springsteen's 'appointment' of his wife to the band almost as a 
personal slight. To the unconverted, Springsteen's fervent followers 
have often seemed like so many members of an exclusive men's drinking 
club, and in 1992 Springsteen committed the ghastly faux pas of bringing
 his woman to the bar. The rest of the boys crouched round their pints 
in a disgrunted circle and attempted to be polite with the backs of 
their necks. In 1993, regardless as ever, Springsteen carries on. <br>
<br>
"In the past I think one of the ideas of the road was the idea of 
escape," he explains of his decision to rock out with kin. "The other is
 the search for adventure or experience. For me, part of it was throwing
 off whatever your daily life is. Even when you're travelling in a van 
with six other guys, it's all- consuming. It's not that particular thing
 for me any more. So the trick now was to make it all work together." <br>
<br>
The first five or six weeks was a particular tough piece of adjustment 
for everyone - the band feeling their way around The Springsteens, and 
the scheduly, by general admission, too tight and too exhausting. The 
show have been opened out now, and will stay that way. "Otherwise, when I
 go home, all I'm going to do is sleep," Springsteen admits ruefully. 
"So we sorted it out, the spacing is slightly better, I've got plenty of
 energy, we all travel together. I really, really enjoy it. It's been 
going good." <br>
<br>
What perhaps didn't go quite so well was the two supposed 'comeback' 
albums Human Touch and Lucky Town, released last year, designed to 
convince the world the Boss had been revived, renewed, reinvented. 
Reviewers willed them to be good, but went into print with only cautious
 praise. By the end of the year the public's wallet had cast its own, 
rather less enthusiastic vote. <br>
<br>
Springsteen, as ever, is ready to convert a possible disappointment to a
 positive boon. "I feel less famous at the moment!" he laughs, "and it's
 good. All I know is, I feel able to get on with my own life, it's just a
 little easier. Your intentions are always complicated. On one hand, 
it's fun to have a big smash and you want your music to be powerful and 
to reach as many people as possible, but a big audience may not be your 
best audience. How you feel about it can vary any given night. <br>
<br>
"The main thing I was concerned with was taking the whole thing down, 
making it feel more humanscaled, less iconic and more about everyday 
issues, which I thought the Tunnel Of Love record and my new records 
dealt with. <br>
<br>
"Outside of that, your control over the thing has a life and dynamic of 
its own. I thought Born In The USA would be a popular record; I didn't 
think it would be the thing it ended up being. That's just what 
happened. I thought Tunnel Of Love or these records would be more 
popular, but that's what happened there. Hey, you ride along with it." <br>
<br>
Springsteen's vision of his audience is, he says, still clear, even if 
that audience's view of Springsteen is less pellucid than it once was. 
People come to him for emotional experience and perspective "either in 
their own lives, or on the world that they're living in, or on their 
relationships." <br>
<br>
Until Springsteen forms his own outlook on any subject, discussing it 
with six strings is pointless. You sense that's partly behind his 
decision to take the family on tour. The listeners who grew up with the 
Boss in the last decade want him there singing about their problems in 
this one - kids and nurturing them. Springsteen can't do that whitout 
raising kids, and he can't raise kids without the family being in front 
of him every day. <br>
<br>
"If I have any knowledge about the way that relationships work," he 
says, with mild understatement, "whether it's partners or kids, it's, 
you gotta be there. That's what kids want - to see you on a steady 
basis. Part of what Patti does with me is say, 'Get out there and work! 
Get out there! Say what you've got to say.' And if you feel what you 
have to say has some value, that's what you want to do. <br>
<br>
"I believe everybody who writes has an audience in his head, whether 
it's an imaginary audience or your real audience. I had a feeling who my
 audience was most of the time and why people came to my music or bought
 my records or came to my shows. I felt I knew what I was delivering 
that drew people to those things. <br>
<br>
"I always write with an audience in mind. Not in terms of if it'll be a 
big hit, but in terms of what the music's delivering. Once I find a 
point of view, that's where I'm standing and that's when the records are
 released. That's what gives me the motivation to come out and travel 
and tour and work and try to stay a part of the thread of people's 
lives, just by doing my job." Springsteen grins widely at the 
description. "It feels like a big job a lot of the time. I'm 
historically ambivalent at this point; it's just always been a part of 
my personality that I say, 'Gee, maybe I should've been a truck driver'.
 It's baloney but everybody does it. Maybe it's a way of escaping 
whatever you feel the responsibility of your job is." <br>
<br>
Certainly the world has had high expectations of its musical saviour, 
but the 20- 30somethings of the 1980s are now the 30-40somethings of the
 1990s. How much more complex is it to satisfy them? "Forty-two is still
 really young," comments Springsteen wryly, "but it's old enough to see 
the whole picture, and it's old enough to stop living completely for 
yourself and to start seeing the lines that you're leaving, how things 
start to spread out in front of you. <br>
<br>
"My Beautiful Reward' was a good song to finish Lucky Town with because I
 wasn't trying to make an 'everything's coming up roses' kind of record.
 I was trying to make a record that was really strongly positive and had
 a feeling of love in it and real hope. Because I've felt and found 
these things in my own life. But I wasn't trying to present it as a 
blueprint. I was trying to stay away from all the fairy stuff. That song
 expresses a little bit of every part of everybody that's always alone. <br>
<br>
"It's not like any of my early road songs, it's not about escape. It's 
about coming to terms with different realities. Sort of confrontation 
with your own individual soul or spirit. But I think it was an important
 end for that record. I was trying to write about - like in 'Big Muddy' -
 more ambivalence and moral ambiguousness. Hey, morality is something a 
lot of people can't afford." <br>
<br>
Lengthy reflection over Lucky Town in particular has left many Bruce 
pundits convinced that he's looking for more personal voice as he steps 
lightly into '93, and more firmly into his early forties. <br>
<br>
"You get more comfortable with who you are and you create less of a 
persona," he reflects on the more direct songs he is producing now. "I 
was concerned about the music being that. That's what I waited for when I
 was off: to find something that felt like the music I should be singing
 now. Something I felt would be defining to my audience, that would help
 people get a fix on where I'm standing and who I am. I initially tried 
to write more genre-like. Some of the better example ended up on Human 
Touch, I always say, 'Oh I'll make this album ten rock songs or ten this
 or ten that, get away from searching all the time. If I put more 
records out maybe I'd have an opportunity to do that, but I always say 
that and never do. <br>
<br>
"I had been through a lot of changes and a lot of experiences through 
the '80s. I think people listen to my music to find out about 
themselves. I've tried to keep a clear view of those things. And I try 
to be consistent with the characters. The guy on 'Beautiful Reward' is 
the guy on 'Born To Run'. Hey, that's where life has taken these 
people." <br>
<br>
But taking those characters to his audience has shown Springsteen no 
further forward in his constant war with size - size of repertoire, size
 of reputation, size of venue. <br>
<br>
"I had a variety of theories before I started the tour about what I was 
going to do, but you don't know until you get out there. I thought I was
 gonna be playing a shorter show." He laughs. "That's almost always 
wrong. The minute you step in an arena the scale of the place generally 
calls for some large heroic or anti- heroic action. I think the size of 
the show over the years expanded to meet that particular thing I felt in
 the air. That's kinda what people come for. The arena is a 
bigger-than-life experience. I think once you step out of the theatre 
it's a different ball game. So I'm probably playing longer than I 
thought I would be and playing more old things than I thought I would be
 as the result. About 60 per cent new stuff and 40 per cent old is what 
feels good on a nightly basis right now." <br>
<br>
The recent, acoustically-arranged Unplugged session for MTV - a mixed 
succes by several accounts - has rekindled Springsteen's dreams for a 
smaller show sometime in the future. "A lot of the new songs, 
particularly on Lucky Town, are pretty folk-based. It's all stuff I can 
sing by myself or with the band. They work a lot of different ways. At 
some point I want to do an acoustic tour by myself and play in 
theatres." <br>
<br>
What he has learned, he says, not for the first time, is to feel less 
threatened about the fate of his music. He was over-protective, but it's
 not as fragile or precious a thing as he once believed. Perhaps he was 
holding his guard too high. "The world is threatening. You can feel that
 big breath on the back of your neck right before you step into those 
particular decisions. Some of the best things I learned were learned 
from getting beat up, making mistakes. And if you're afraid to do that, 
to step out and fall, that's living in fear. <br>
<br>
"My fear of failure always held me back in dealing with relationships. I
 always stopped before I commetted to the place where if it would hurt."
 But not this time, perhaps.</div>

Rolling Stone , 1993-06-24<br>
By David Sinclair<br>
<br>
When I was young, I truly didn't think music had any limitations," said 
Bruce Springsteen in an interview with "New York Newsday" last year. "I 
thought it could give you everything you wanted in life." That naive and
 ultimately absurd belief was what used to fire up a typical Springsteen
 show into a no-holds-barred, hyper intense event, the nearest thing in 
rock &amp; roll to a religious experience. Not anymore. The creeping 
realization that there **is** more to life than music has quite 
naturally chipped away at the margins of what Springsteen is now 
prepared to give -- and indeed is capable of giving -- in performance. <br>
<br>
On his second sold-out night at this l2,000-capacity venue, both 
Springsteen and his five-piece band turned in a bravura set, no doubt 
about that. It started with an acoustic sequence that MTV's Unplugged 
could have aired without compromise: one man, a guitar and a harp 
teasing out the emotional pith of "Darkness on the Edge of Town," 
"Mansion on the Hill" and "The Hard Land," the latter a Dylanesque song 
written in the mid-Eighties but never recorded. <br>
<br>
The band, which came romping on with an opening salvo of "Better Days" 
and "Lucky Town," has matured into a cheerful, fail-safe unit: the 
retiring bassist Tommy Sims and Muppet-like drummer Zachary Alford 
pinning down the rhythm at the back; guitarist, percussionist and 
backing vocalist Crystal Taliefero forever busy on the wings; keyboard 
player Roy Bittan a commanding presence center stage; and guitarist 
Shane Fontayne sparring with Springsteen up front, his elegant twang 
providing the perfect foil for his boss's less-tutored soloing style. <br>
<br>
Why Springsteen has elected to take five backing singers, including the 
redoubtable Bobby King, on the road remains a mystery. A great harmony 
team they may be -- adding a stirring gospel dimension to "Trapped 
Again" and raising the roof with an epic version of Jimmy Cliff's "Many 
Rivers to Cross -- but they were redundant for long stretches of the 
show. Springsteen maintained an impressive energy level, jumping into 
the crowd during "Leap of Faith," flinging himself bodily onto Bittan's 
keyboard during "Light of Day" (a pulverizing rocker, now available for 
the first time on the Europe-only release of MTV Plugged) and hauling up
 a blond accomplice from the audience to dance with him during "Working 
on the Highway." <br>
<br>
But throughout the show we saw more of Bruce the hard-working huckster 
than of Bruce the lionhearted defender of the true rock &amp; roll 
faith. There were no between-song raps about fatherhood, the state of 
the nation or the precious things in life. There was, however, the corny
 business of a dozen or so big furry dice planted in the crowd and flung
 out onstage at the start of "Roll of the Dice"; and there was a 
questionable version of "Rockin' All Over the World" that echoed the 
raucous arena-rock thump of Status Quo's version more closely than John 
Fogerty's rootsy original. <br>
<br>
In his prime, Springsteen redefined the parameters of rock performance. 
Now that his unique sense of urgent, total, all-consuming commitment to 
the cause has begun to ebb, he is faced with the unenviable task of 
matching up to his own impossibly high standards. There were moments 
recalling the greatness of old, notably a stretch that cleverly 
bracketed "Souls of the Departed" with "Born in the U.S.A.," but if such
 a phrase can be applied to one of rock's greatest performers, the bulk 
of this gig was business as usual.</div>

Various radio stations , 1995<br>
By Bob Costas<br>
<br>
Bruce: I'd made a record, or part of a record last year, that I didn't 
finish and I worked on it quite a bit and I listened to it just before 
maybe before last Christmas time or something and I said gee, you know, 
it's not quite right. And I worked with the band on the Greatest Hits 
record. There's something about the band that always has sort of drawn 
me outside of myself to write more about the world outside, I suppose. I
 think I wrote GOTJ originally as a rock song for the E Street Band, 
thinking I might use it as one of the extra songs on the GH record. And 
for one reason or another that didn't happen, but it kind of set me in 
that direction a little bit. And I had this song Straight Time which is 
on this record. And I had that for about a year or so and I liked its 
basic feeling. And as I was working at that time - you follow where your
 voice is, you don't particularly choose where your voice is at any 
given moment, I don't think so and at this particular time in my work 
life for some reason it seemed like my voice is where this record ended 
up. It was more of a folk voice. That seemed to be something that was 
just saying hey, work over here. I didn't sit down and plan to 
particularly make this type of record or not. Parts of it presented 
itself to me and then you sort of follow it, you follow it along. <br>
<br>
Bob: Bruce, Tom Joad of course, from John Steinbeck's novel The Grapes 
of Wrath, but it's clear that your inspiration for this comes more from 
the John Ford film, not just for this track, but the whole album has a 
cinematic feel. I know you're a fan of John Ford. <br>
<br>
Bruce: Yeah, that picture I guess I saw in the late 70s and it had a 
really deep effect on me. I think I'd read some John Steinbeck, probably
 earlier than that - in high school and there was something about the 
film that sort of crystallized the story for me. And it always stayed 
with me after that, for some reason there was something in that picture 
that always resonated throughout almost all of my other work. It was 
just an image that popped out as I was sittin around on the couch 
messing around with the guitar. <br>
<br>
Bob: Do you remember the first time that you watched Henry Fonda give that speech at the end? <br>
<br>
Bruce: Oh yeah, I cried. <br>
<br>
Bob: [quotes Henry Fonda speech reference in lyrics, in a Barbara Walters-like effort to make Bruce cry <img class="smilies" src="_assets/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" width="15" height="15">] <br>
<br>
Bruce: That was a very powerful speech for me. I think to some degree 
the things you write are a conversation with yourself. I wasn't... I 
think that's probably what that song was to me, it was a conversation I 
was having with myself. Not about "oh, brother where art thou," or 
"where is this in the world today," it was just "where is it in me?" I 
think you gotta start with that question. If you can get people to ask 
that question then the song's done its job. <br>
<br>
Bob: You've often come to the theme of a person in difficult 
circumstances trying to find some nobility some dignity in those 
circumstances, maybe not in a dramatic way that everyone can see, but in
 some small way that would have a redemptive power for that person. And 
in these cuts, I find a little bit of that but also a lot of resignation
 on the part of these characters that maybe they're just not even gonna 
find that little bit of dignity. <br>
<br>
Bruce: Well, I guess I sort of see there's a little bit of it out there.
 I don't really start from any political point of view - no conscious 
one. I suppose everybody carries their politics innately and emotionally
 in their psychology in some fashion. But I think that's what's been 
happening. I think that the American idea of equal opportunity obviously
 it hasn't been realized. And I think what's worse, every study that's 
come out about the division of wealth in society over the past ten or 
fifteen years has shown that the middle class has been getting smaller 
and people have been getting farther and farther apart. I think that 
while it's something that hasn't led to, say, riots, it leads to 
diminished hopes, diminished expectations, diminished possibilities. And
 so that feeling which is just something that I sort of - like I said I 
don't sit down and start from any particular conscious point of view, 
but I think that feeling of the way things feel to me right now, that 
colors the stories and the characters' lives on the record. <br>
<br>
Bob: Like we said earlier, GOTJ is based much more on the movie, or 
draws its inspiration much more from the movie than from the book, and 
you think about the movie and this whole family making its way out west 
in this little rickety car, and nothing about their circumstances is 
nurturing, nothing should give them reason to be optimistic, and they're
 trying to forge some sense of community among themselves and find 
something that's real that can help them transcend these circumstances. 
And that theme shows up in a lot of your work through the years, doesn't
 it? <br>
<br>
Bruce: I guess, see my folks in 1969, I was 19, my folks went west. They
 went to California to start a new life. And they, it was my mom, my dad
 and my little sister, I think they had saved $3000, and I remember I 
stayed in New Jersey because I'd gotten very involved with the band and I
 guess that'd become my family at that point in time, and it was also 
where I could make a living. I went out to California, I tried to make a
 living and I couldn't get a job. I couldn't get a job where somebody'd 
pay me to play. And back home I had two or three clubs where I could 
come up with a hundred, a hundred-twenty-five, or a hundred-fifty bucks a
 week, which was enough to survive on. I was sleeping with 6 other guys 
in an apartment and everybody's chippin in a few bucks for rent. But my 
folks went in 69, they had three grand, they slept two nights in the car
 and one night in a motel, and that was what they did. They drove into 
California, they didn't know anybody... I had a girlfriend who was one 
of the first sort of hippies in the area, she was the only person anyone
 knew who'd ever been to San Francisco (laughs), and she sent em to 
Sausalito, (laughs) which was sort of, I guess, this sort of hipsters' 
enclave at the time... <br>
<br>
Bob: Was she sure to wear a pretty flower in her hair? <br>
<br>
Bruce: (laughs) So my folks pull straight from New Jersey into 
Sausalito, where of course, they realize very quickly that they don't 
belong there. And my mother claims they pulled into a gas station and 
asked the attendant, "Hey, where do people like us live?" (laughs) and 
somebody said, "Oh, you live on the peninsula." That's her story, so 
they started a whole new life out there, they did well, but they 
struggled pretty hard. I went out there - there was a time when I'd 
never been on an airplane, till I made a record, nobody could afford an 
airplane ticket. To get to see them about once every year or so, me and a
 buddy of mine we'd drive across the country go three days straight, 
we'd save - whatever, a hundred bucks or a couple hundred dollars and 
drive straight through. I went to California, I tried to, I did some 
auditioning, but I realized really quickly that I wasn't gonna be able 
to live out there. I wasn't gonna be able to... you know there were just
 a lot of musicians, and while it was a much bigger music scene, I was a
 nobody, and I realized very quickly that while someone might let you 
play, they're not gonna pay you. So I stayed about two months and I 
realized I was gonna have to be living off my folks and I didn't want to
 do that, so I went back to New Jersey. And I don't know if that's had 
something to do with part of what I've written about. Maybe it's some of
 my own experience and some of just that's the American story. The 
American story is transience and the idea of "over the rise," which is 
less now, I suppose, but I think it's some ingrained part of, not just 
the American spirit but human spirit in general. My characters have 
always been on the move going someplace, searching for something - 
whether it's a better life or running from something with the idea that 
somehow moving will make you better, it'll heal you inside. <br>
<br>
Bob: This may not be the exact quote, but you said something like this 
once: "I was 24 years old, I was sitting at home in New Jersey asking 
myself the question 'Is love real?' and if people have followed my 
characters through all the years, they can find a common thread with 
them and they see that Luckytown is where those characters wind up." 
That's what it was at the time you made that statement. Is TGOTJ where 
those characters wind up or where their thoughts wind up now, or is it 
more a nod of recognition at a path that all of us could conceivably 
take if we make the wrong choices or if our circumstances aren't so 
lucky? <br>
<br>
Bruce: I guess I don't like to use the idea of "wind up" I guess you 
don't "wind up" till it's over. (laughs ) There's a lot of different 
things, questions, I tried to work through in my work over the years. 
The idea of "is love real" yeah, I think it is, but it's hard to find. 
And it can be hard to find evidence of it. I'd written I think all of 
this record. And I was in my library one night and pulled a book out 
called Journey to Nowhere, which was a book I'd bought years before and I
 hadn't read. The text is by a fellow named Dale Maharidge and there's 
some really great photos by a fellow named Michael Williamson, and 
basically what they did, they went out on the road and they road the 
trains from, I think, St. Louis to Oregon and it documented a lot of 
what had been happening to a group of Americans in the latter half of 
the 80s - the people that the trickle- down economy never trickled down 
to. It's a book that makes very real, puts real faces on what it's like 
if you slip through those cracks. I was very frightened, I remember I 
read it all in one night and I closed it - my God, you never know what 
tomorrow brings. It strikes some sort of fear: what if you couldn't take
 care of your family, what if you had to leave them, what if you 
couldn't be home with your sons and your daughters, what if you couldn't
 pay for their health care, and couldn't provide them with the health 
care that they need? What if that was your kids? I know how deadly 
important my job is to me. What if I didn't have that job? Or what if I 
couldn't do that job after I did it for 20 years or 25 years? <br>
<br>
Bob: or what if the job you had... <br>
<br>
Bruce: disappeared <br>
<br>
Bob: ...didn't have anything to do with anything that really meant something to you? <br>
<br>
Bruce: Right, so these are all questions that I don't know, I ask myself
 a lot I guess, and hey I've had enormous amount of luck and fortune and
 have worked hard, but that other thing, I don't know, it never feels 
that far away, and I think that it's as far away as the guy next to you.
 It's not that far. <br>
<br>
Bob: If you believe as you said once that people listen to your songs 
not to find out about you, but to find out about themselves. What do you
 think they'll come away from this record thinking or thinking about? <br>
<br>
Bruce: Basically, I think I tried to sit down and feel... I think your 
music always ends up being two things... one it's probably a photograph 
of your own inner landscape... emotional landscape to some degree. And 
possibly your character in some fashion - how you perceive your life, 
lives around you, the place you live. And then it's a picture, 
hopefully, I sat down and tried to reflect what the country feels like 
to me right now. The bottom line. That's the line that people will 
always judge... America will always be judged against that, that's what 
the American idea was...some concept of shared burden. I guess what I 
was trying to do probably for myself was to put myself back in touch 
with those ideas, those values. I have children now. I'm a grown man. 
Now's not the time to think about what I want to be like, it's the time 
for me to be what I want to be like. So I think I was tying to really 
get myself back in touch with those, hey, with my family, my children, 
the man you want to be and what you want the place you live in to be 
like. I don't know how other people will... I sorta go for that first 
and I assume that if it's working for me, then it'll work for my 
audience or whoever listens to it. That's really... I think that's 
probably where I'm coming from. <br>
<br>
Bob: That was Youngstown from TGOTJ. Wanna talk a little bit about the inspiration for that? <br>
<br>
Bruce: That was a song that really - I go back to this book called 
Journey to Nowhere - I had written the whole record and then I read the 
book, and Youngstown and a song called The New Timer are really drawn 
from a lot of the information and the stories that were in this 
particular book. I guess that was something that probably out of all the
 things on the record maybe that connects the most directly to something
 if you were a fan of the River or just the story of post-industrial 
America, what happens when your job disappears. You were able to make a 
good living for 20 years and all of a sudden that's not there for you 
and maybe you can find a job that pays half as much or a quarter as much
 and you're 45 years old, you're 50 years old. What happens when the 
craft you've learned, the skill you've learned... I think, hey what if I
 couldn't... my music ability that's all that I have, I'm not a 
multitalented person, I have a talent in a specific area and I fumble 
around every place else. So I wanted to re-engage some of those ideas 
and some of those issues and that's really where that song came out of. <br>
<br>
Bob: How much of your present approach on this album is attributable ? 
even if it's a small amount - to some self-doubt about whether you'd 
become, for whatever reasons, too mainstream - the whole idea that 
celebrity is the natural enemy of integrity, so you'd better deliver a 
counter-punch. <br>
<br>
Bruce Oh, I don't know. I'm not sure I really... I don't sort of steer 
myself by those particular lights. And I have a variety of different 
feelings about it. A lot of the things I really liked were things that 
were very mainstream. The stuff that moved me and changed my life were 
mainstream records. They were from people who came from outside of the 
mainstream but changed the mainstream to accommodate who they were by 
the force of their abilities and their talent and their ideas and their 
presence. Those are the artists that I admired a lot, whether it was 
Dylan... Hey, before "Like a Rolling Stone" you couldn't sing like that 
and get on the radio. They couldn't get on the radio like that. I've 
also said the same thing with before Nirvana came out with "Smells Like 
Teen Spirit" you couldn't sound like that and get on top 40 radio. And I
 always believed that it was a valuable risk to take. It was a funny 
situation in that I think that I was essentially probably a child of 
Elvis Presley initially, but I grew up in the 60s and Dylan's work and 
later Woody Guthrie's also meant an enormous amount to me so I sorta got
 caught in between... those are some different roots in certain ways. 
The things that meant a lot to me when I was young were the things that 
came across the AM radio. I didn't live in an environment where there 
was a lot of cultural education, we weren't exposed to things that were 
outside of the mainstream for the most part. The mainstream was what you
 had and in your small town what came across the radio was... I found it
 very liberating and I found it very meaningful. I think I incorporated 
that as a part of. I had my choices. Way back, way way back in 1975 I 
could have not have done those interviews and probably not have been on 
the cover of both Time and Newsweek, and I could have possibly made some
 different choices in '85, but I was very interested in where that road 
led and in finding out about who I was and what I could do or would do 
under those circumstances. Cause I thought I'd do something different, 
and in some ways I did and in some ways I didn't. And those are the 
things that interested me. I think that at this point if I had anything 
to say about the particular level of celebrity, which I don't have now, 
ten years ago it was different, was that at some point it felt pretty 
overwhelming, and I think at some point it overwhelms the story you're 
telling and trying to tell. <br>
<br>
Bob: This much is also undeniable. Without everything that went before 
the audience would be smaller for what you're trying to say here. 
There's no fighting that. <br>
<br>
Bruce: Right now, there'd be almost no audience. (laughs) <br>
<br>
Bob: On it's own merits, no matter how high those merits are, absent 
what went before, this is a record that only a few people hear. <br>
<br>
Bruce: You are absolutely right. And that's the facts. And that's 
something that I've been conscious of that sort of throughout my career,
 I've kind of made one sort of record and I'll go off an make another 
one. And that balance has always felt right to me. I know that an 
audience is hard to find. And it's easy if you've had one for a long 
time, it's easy to take that audience for granted and think oh, hey, 
people just come when I play, they just buy my records when they come 
out. But the truth is that that audience - I was years on the circuit, 
years on the circuit I studied my craft in bars since I was 14 years 
old, that's 32 years ago, and it happened over a long period of time. 
And it is something of tremendous value. At the same time, not just 
necessarily any audience is of tremendous value. I think that if you 
subvert what you're saying, what you're doing, what you want your work 
or your life to be about, then you've lost yourself and the essence of 
what you do. <br>
<br>
Bob: Do you feel like you ever did that? <br>
<br>
Bruce: I don't think so. I think basically, I've made the records that 
I've wanted to make. I think that in the course of probably the BITUSA 
record, the story I was living overshadowed the story I was telling, and
 that is the consequence of a certain amount of maybe success and fame, 
and that's just something you learn. Not with everybody, not with my 
core audience, and I think that there's a few things on that record that
 are probably... certainly the title song, which I knew that when I 
wrote it that it was gonna have impact. But ... My Hometown, I didn't 
know people were gonna respond like they did one way or the other. But I
 think that it's something that I'm very very cautious of right now, and
 I'm really, I feel like I'm just out there checking it out. I'm trying 
to find... I want this record to be heard, at the same time, I want it 
to be understood. <br>
<br>
Bob: Seems to me like TGOTJ is a record that people will have to listen 
to a half dozen times before they begin to form their feelings about it.
 <br>
<br>
Bruce: I don't know... <br>
<br>
Bob: The first couple times through, I'm not so sure you're going to get it all. <br>
<br>
Bruce: I don't know. That's for the listener. I've heard it a lot of 
times. I haven't heard it in a long... since we finished it off. I think
 I can have the experience of the record, I can't quite have that 
initial listening experience that you're talking about. That's something
 I have as each song goes down, and that's slightly different because if
 I don't think I'm getting it, I move on to something else. Sometimes 
I'll go back, like Straight Time, I played it once, I put it away and 
basically, I threw it away. And Jon came out and he has a tendency... he
 always asks my engineer "What's laying around that hasn't been played 
or I haven't heard?" I think my engineer pulled that one out and he came
 back and said, "Hey, wait a minute." So sometimes you don't know; 
sometimes you do something that was better than you thought it was. <br>
<br>
Bob: When people come to see you on this tour, obviously they're going 
to see an acoustic show, not an acoustic version of songs previously 
recorded...<br>
<br>
Bruce: It's not Unplugged, it's not Unplugged... <br>
<br>
Bob: Right. So they're gonna see an acoustic show. There's an interesting contrast in that... <br>
<br>
Bruce: What the show is, it's a folk show, to put it in sort of in the 
sense that I'm not sorta doing my favorites or their favorites, or the 
hits or whatever you call it I'm concentrating very specifically on this
 particular record and material that feels like it complements it. It's a
 show that... it's a quiet show. There's a lot of focus in it. So it's 
pretty different. <br>
<br>
Bob: I guess there is some feeling on the part of fans of an individual 
or a group, that when they go to see a concert, that concert should be 
an updated version of the catalog. We're gonna get all the classics, 
plus we're gonna get the handful from the new release that will join 
that group of classics, and that's not what's going to happen here. <br>
<br>
Bruce: I think there's a time to do that. We'd played a couple nights 
with the E Street Band and we played a bunch of the old songs, and it 
was fun to do I enjoyed it and it's something where it's a departure. I 
really haven't done this before. I've played a few isolated shows. I've 
played Neil Young's Bridge Benefit a few times acoustically, and I've 
played a benefit for the Christic Institute acoustically with Jackson 
Browne. Then I started out on my own, when I got signed I was playing 
Max's Kansas City by myself with acoustic guitar so in a funny way it's a
 throwback to what that was. But it's something I haven't really done 
before; it's something I've wanted to do for a long time. It really 
pares everything away and makes what you're about and what you're doing 
real clear, and that's what I'm interested in communicating right now. 
I'm real excited about it and I think the fans are going to enjoy it. <br>
<br>
Bob: Everyone wonders, no matter how much they enjoy this record, no 
matter how much they enjoy this tour, when will Bruce be back with the E
 Street Band? So now I've asked the question. I've discharged my 
obligation, now you discharge yours. <br>
<br>
Bruce: (laughs) Oh, we had a great time doing the GH, and what can I 
say, it's a special group of people and I'm sure at some point we'll be 
doing something. I hate to predict because I'm always wrong myself, and I
 follow, when I said you sort of follow your voice, and the voice of 
this particular record was something that felt like, yeah, was just 
something I heard in my head right now, whether you hear the world 
speaking to you or something inside you speaking to you that moves you 
in a particular direction, and that's really, that leads you hopefully 
to your most honest work, hopefully to your best work, hopefully to your
 honest job. But then also if you make a quiet record you tend to want 
to make some noise maybe later or something. I'd want to be able to call
 on the guys, and if everybody felt like it and if I was gonna make a 
rock record right now that'd be the first thing that I'd do. Outside of 
my family, that's the most important relationship in my life, that and 
my relationship with my audience. <br>
<br>
Bob: Do you still stand by your statement that the two best days of your
 life were the day you picked up the guitar and the day you learned how 
to put it down? <br>
<br>
Bruce: Oh, those days have been supplanted now. I guess the best days of
 my life were certainly the birth of my children. I think any parent 
always says that. And finding the thing that moves you... something to 
do... finding something to do is really really important. I think maybe 
that that's why I'm attuned to that in others. Something that is so 
important to me, it was so important, and it's been so rewarding. That 
was the American idea was that everybody would have that opportunity, 
that chance. That's an idea worth fighting for. <br>
<br>
Bob: The easy, glib thing is when people say when someone gets 
successful and they have material wealth they get out of touch with the 
troubles of people on the margins. I think that's too easy, but if a 
person truly finds happiness - and it seems like you're happier than 
you've ever been for a stretch of time now in your life - if the person 
finds happiness, is there a danger that the artistic edge can be muted? <br>
<br>
Bruce: No, no, because... it depends, once again any of those things you
 can't generalize. Life's circumstances change people in a lot of 
different ways. I know you can make a lot of money and be isolated, but I
 knew some hard-core isolated people who had nothing and who cut 
themselves off. I've said in the past, you can isolate yourself with a 
six pack of beer. I don't buy those types of generalizations, I think it
 depends on the individual and the idea that happiness somehow mutes 
your work, I'm not so sure. It depends what drives you, it depends what 
you want and the things that you still... I still search for the big 
part of the meaning of my life in my work...[tape cut here flipping 
sides, sorry] ...since you were born isn't something that disappears. I 
think anybody who was ever seriously kicked around never ever forgets. 
You know that stuff never leaves you, and I think if you're a person 
whose job is to mine your imagination, you keep every aspect of your 
life wide open. It's never a closed book. You never say, "Well, that was
 then." It's always now. It's all always now. And so you draw from that 
well as you can.</div>

Don't scream and shout. <br>
Springsteen's serious about getting serious.<br>
Newsweek , 1996-04<br>
By Karen Schoemer<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is about to put on a very intense performance for a 
very demanding audience: himself. At 6 on the night of his solo acoustic
 show in Stockholm, he walks out onto the stage for sound-check at the 
Cirkus, an 1.800-seat hall on the European leg of his "Ghost of Tom 
Joad" tour. The stage is bare. The only props are a mean little army of 
black Takamine guitars, lined up 13 strong behind a curtain, each tuned 
differently, yet each with an identical polish on its identical hollow 
body. Springsteen's guitar roadie and keyboardist, Kevin Buell, places 
four or five in a neat, protective semicircle around the microphone. 
Springsteen picks one up. He strums it a few times. Then he softly 
finger-picks the opening notes of "The Ghost of Tom Joad." About halfway
 through the song, he stops. "There is a different sound in here," he 
muses. "It's kinda cool." He listens intently to the fading notes, to 
the empty room, to the silence. <br>
<br>
He plays a couple more songs, trying out the different guitars, sorting 
out the different reverberations they make. A photographer creeps along 
the far reaches of the loge. He's been instructed not to get too close 
to the stage; the clicks of the camera will distract Springsteen's 
obsessive quest for perfection. He plays "Sinaloa Cowboys," another 
harsh, strained breath of a song. Midway through the first verse, the 
guitar emits a honk of feedback. Springsteen tries it again, and the 
feedback honks again. He tries playing the second verse, and it honks at
 the same place in the chord progression. "It's a funky note," 
Springsteen mumbles. "See if I can isolate it." He moves the capo on the
 guitar's neck, changing the key. Then he changes the key again, and a 
third time. "It's just one E flat, for some reason," he says. The false 
note is banished. This isn't just a sound-check; it's an exorcism. <br>
<br>
These days, Springsteen is in severe heavyweight mode. With "The Ghost 
of Tom Joad" and its accompanying tour, which returns to the United 
States this summer, he knows he has a lot to prove, "Tom Joad" is his 
way of asserting that, at 46, he still has something important to say. 
He seems worried that people won't listen, because in each show he 
instructs them to. "This is a community event," he tells the crowd in 
Stockholm. "If anybody's making too much noice, feel free to band 
together and tell them to shut the f- up." It's a new twist on rock 
psychology: tell your audience to be quite and not get too excited. The 
Swedish crowd was supportively attentive, but in the United States, "Tom
 Joad" is proving both a commercial and a critical risk. It's the only 
album in his catalog not to be certified gold or platinum, and the first
 U.S. shows received less-than-jubilant reviews last winter. (But 
another of Springsteen's brutal acoustic songs, the title track from the
 film "Dead Man Walking," was up this week for an Oscar.) If Springsteen
 was once the savior of rock and roll, right now he's its Puritan 
minister, taking America to task for its sins. <br>
<br>
Underneath all the messages, Springsteen is sending an odd, barely 
audible little SOS of his own. In recent years something has been 
missing from his music, and he wants it back very badly: relevance. Not 
just social relevance, but relevance to his audience, relevance to 
himself. His 1992 albums "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town" were commercial 
and critical letdowns. You have to go back to 1987's "Tunnel of Love," 
the heartbreaking chronicle of his failed first marriage, for vintage 
Springsteen; some might argue you have to go back to "Born in the 
U.S.A.," the 1984 runaway career train that sold 15 million copies and 
made him a household name. " I had very high goals for my band when we 
started," he says, backstage after the Stockholm show. He's every bit as
 intense and methodical in his speech as he was onstage. "We didn't go 
just to make music, we went out to make essential music. It was fun and 
entertaining and hopefully enjoyable, but at the core there was 
something serious and essential that tied into the experience of living 
in America. I think that the criticism of some records I made in the 
late '80s or '90s centered around that idea." <br>
<br>
Today Springsteen's personal life has never been more fulfilled. He's 
happily remarried, to singer and bandmate Patti Scialfa, and they're 
raising three kids: Evan, 5; Jessie, 4; and Sam, 2. But he's decided 
that happy home stories aren't what his audience craves. "Before I did 
'Tom Joad' I had another record that was based more on relationships and
 things," he says. "I finished maybe three quaters of it, and I invested
 a good bit of myself in it. But one night I said, 'Gee, I'm not sure 
this is what I want to hear from me right now.' So I sat back and said, 
'Well, what would I want to hear?'" The answer was: essential music. "I 
had a couple of things guiding me. One was 'Streets of Philadelphia,' 
which had gotten a tremendous response. It was a small song that I wrote
 in a few days, but I was addressing outside issues. ['Tom Joad'] is in 
that tradition. It's music that fulfills the promises that I made when I
 began. That's what I'm interested in doing right now. That's who I 
think I should be." <br>
<br>
Yet that evening after the show, when Springsteen and his tour party 
head out to dinner, a very different guy emerges. This isn't 
Springsteen, the retrofitted model; it's plain old vintage Bruce, the 
storyteller, the cutup, the local kid. Prompted by his longtime agent 
Barry Bell, he switches into tourstory mode. "We're playing Lincoln 
Center," Bruce recalls, "and it's a big night. Max [Weinberg, E Street 
drummer] was sick. And he blew his lunch in the middle of 'Born to Run.'
 But he didn't stop playing. Extra merit for Max. Then in the middle of 
'E Street Shuffle' I hear what sounds like a trumpet. And I,m going, 
'Damn. What the hell is Clarence [Clemons] doing with that saxophone?' 
And I look, and next to Clarence is a trumpet player. So I said, 
'Clarence, what's he doing over there?' Clarence goes, 'He said you said
 it was OK!' I said, 'Well, it's not OK. Get him off!' Then we come out 
for an encore, and all of a sudden I notice the stage is rising. I 
think, 'Jesus, this can't be happening.' And then I realize, no, the 
stage isn't rising, the audience is sinking. There's an orchestra pit 
that they put about 100 seats on, and a kid spilled beer into it, 
short-wired the ting. The monitors are crashing in after them. It was 
unbelievable. Our Lincoln Center debut." <br>
<br>
The Boardwalk: Springsteen never leaves that Jersey guy far behind. He 
grew up - it's a famous story - in Freehold, a small town near the 
shore, on a street with a church, a rectory, a convent and a Sinclair 
gas station. " Me and my parents lived in my grandparent's house," he 
says. "Then there was my cousin's house, my aunt's house, my 
great-grandmother's house, my aunt's house on my mother's side with my 
other grandmother in it. We were all on one street, with the church in 
the middle." By his teens, Springsteen was outsider, watching things 
happen, remembering them. "The drummer I had then, Bart Haynes, and this
 fellow Walter Shoeshone, they both died in Vietnam when we were in our 
teens," he says. "I can still see them in their uniforms. Those are very
 powerful images. The factories. It still finds its way into my work." <br>
<br>
People think Springsteen is an uppercrusty L.A. guy now, but he and his 
family still spend most of the year in New Jersey. He has a "big, 
beautiful farm" that he bought a couple of years ago, plus his house in 
tony Rumson. And every summer, they visit the Boardwalk. Jersey is "a 
place I've never left," he says. "I've tried many times, and never done 
it. A part of me did leave, but a part of me always stayed. I still 
enjoy the way it smells and feels in the summertime."</div>

				<div class="content">Learning To Walk Like A Man<br>
Charlotte NC Leader Newspaper , 1998-06-19<br>
By Gene Lazo<br>
<br>
I was sad when I heard that Douglas Springsteen, the 73-year old father 
of rock legend Bruce Springsteen, died this past April 26 in Belmont, 
Calif. While I've never met either man personally, I do feel like I've 
gotten to somehow understand their relationship though many of Bruce's 
songs. I can see the similarities in my relationship with my own dad and
 I can sense some evolutionary underpinnings as my sons begin to grow 
into their lives. Perhaps these feelings emanate from some paternal 
karma which flows through men's veins, sort of the quintessential guy. 
Perhaps, as it was in my case, it has more to do with attaining resolve 
and learning why its important to walk like a man. <br>
<br>
For those unfamiliar with Bruce Springsteen's career, some poignant 
pieces of his work have explored his rather complex relationship with 
his dad. Springsteen has said that when he was growing up, there were 
two things which were unpopular around his house, 'The first thing was 
me, the other was my guitar'. To Springsteen the son, his guitar was a 
means to change the world and meet girls all at the same time; to his 
dad, it subconsciously represented blind faith optimism by his son in a 
fickle and dangerous world that would steal what you weren't strong 
enough to defend. <br>
<br>
Douglas Springsteen, with his wife of 50 years Adele, raised Bruce and 
his two sisters in a working class house, located next door to a gas 
station in the central shore area of New Jersey. His world, much like my
 own Dad's, didn't involve culture or art or introspection but work. He 
was a man who worked hard to provide the best he could for his family, 
believing the implied American promise that if you followed the rules 
and kept your nose to the grindstone, you'd always be able to make a 
good life for your family. And that was the bottom line. But he saw 
those rules turn on him in mid-dream, sanctimony expressed as words his 
son would later write in The River, 'Those memories come back to haunt 
me / They haunt me like a curse / Is a dream a lie if it don't come true
 / Or is it something worse?'. <br>
<br>
He worked in a textile mill. When the factory closed down, he worked as a
 cab driver and a prison guard and a bus driver, taking whatever jobs 
need be to provide for his family. His world, like that of his son, was 
one of hope under assault. For Douglas it was the realization that he, 
and his family, were trapped. For Bruce it was the determination to 
break free of that trap. Springsteen recalled that his father would come
 home from work everyday complaining loudly about his f-ing boss; it was
 this misery that propelled Springsteen to decide right then that, "One 
day I was going to be the f-ing boss". <br>
<br>
During his live shows during the early 1980's, Springsteen would often 
tell a story about how, during the Vietnam War era, he would continually
 put off coming home at night to avoid talking with his father. He'd 
tell about how his dad would often times be waiting up for him, sitting 
in the dark at the kitchen table, about how he'd see the glow of his 
dad's cigarette as he walked through the door. He'd tell how he'd tuck 
his hair under his collar, to try and disguise it's increasing length. 
How he'd try to sneak upstairs without being noticed. His dad would 
invariably call him over and ask him how things were going and about 
what he was doing with his life. Just as predictably, the conversation 
would lead to shouting between father and son, shouting that more than 
once involved the elder Springsteen telling his son how he couldn't wait
 until the Army got hold of him and 'made a man out of him'. One day, 
the draft notice arrived. Springsteen stayed out with his friends the 
night before he was to report to the induction center. When he finally 
returned home, his dad asked him where he had been. He told him he had 
gone to take his physical. His dad asked what happened, and Springsteen 
told him he got rejected. "That's good," was his dad's reply. <br>
<br>
The relationship between fathers and sons is curious and often difficult
 to understand, probably just as complex as the relationship between men
 and women. If we juxtapose Van Morrison's observation that, "The girls 
go by dressed up for each other" against James Brown's lamentful boast 
that "Its a Man's World" we can see the groundwork for the generalized 
difference between how moms and dads see their sons. Moms will try to 
teach their sons to do right by the world based upon maternal standards 
involving compassion and clean underwear. Dads teach their sons that 
they need to make the world, for better or worse, a place which meets 
their own standards. After all, you don't need to stop and ask for 
directions when your home is the center of the universe. <br>
<br>
Fathers and sons often find themselves at odds with one another because,
 as Springsteen admitted, dads and sons can often be 'too much of the 
same kind'. Sometimes the discord comes from the son trying to 'be a 
better man than my father'. This is a good thing. Sometimes it comes 
from the father being unable to be a better man. This is not. <br>
<br>
I was fortunate that, much like Springsteen, while my dad and I had our 
differences, we grew to understand and respect each other. In his song 
Walk Like a Man Springsteen wrote: "All I can think of is being 5 years 
old / Following behind you at the beach tracing your footprints in the 
sand / Trying to walk like a man." As a child we try to trace our 
father's footprints, then as an adolescent we try to out run them. As an
 adult we look back to see the waves reclaim the footprints as we are 
left to look ahead and walk on. The conclusive lesson a father will 
teach is how unimportant we individually are, except to our sons. <br>
<br>
Happy Father's Day, dad; I'm walking right behind you.</div>

				<div class="content">Tracks' shows Springteen still on the search<br>
Knight Ridder Newspapers , 1998-11<br>
By Tom Moon<br>
<br>
A sample lyric from ``Happy,'' one of 55 previously unreleased 
selections on ``Bruce Springsteen: Tracks'': ``Lost and running beneath a
 million dead stars. / Tonight let's shed our skins and slip these 
bars.'' Are these the words of the boyish Bruce, the Jersey shore rocker
 who set off decades ago on a hellfire mission to find out ``if love is 
real''? Are they from the more mature Bruce, who chronicled ordinary 
people bumping up against their own limitations? Or is this the musing 
of the middle-age father, whose recent works have been somber allegories
 and earthy reflections on love and loss? <br>
<br>
It's one of the revelations of ``Tracks'' (Columbia, 3-1/2 stars), which
 arrives in stores Tuesday, that ``Happy'' could be the product of any 
of Springsteen's incarnations. Recorded in 1992 during sessions for 
``Human Touch'' and ``Lucky Town,'' it's got those timeless Springsteen 
signifiers: the yearning to escape from the mundane, the soul-searching 
followed by a declaration of devotion. He could have written it after 
``Thunder Road,'' on the 1975 ``Born to Run.'' Or ``Hungry Heart'' from 
1980's ``The River.'' Or ``Two Faces,'' released on ``Tunnel of Love'' 
in 1987. <br>
<br>
Like much of the material on this career-spanning four-disc anthology, 
``Happy'' offers proof of what those who love Springsteen already know: 
That he's spent the last 25 years working out elaborate, bloodthirsty, 
bracingly honest variations on the theme of transformation. <br>
<br>
His characters pursue love in the frantic hope that it will reverse 
their luck and redeem their sins. They bust out of two-lane towns with 
only a few dollars in their pockets, determined to make a fresh start. 
They do everything humans can do to change their circumstances. They're 
ordinary folks, not mythic figures or celluloid heroes. In the early 
days, they were cocksure, car-obsessed kids eager to learn the ways of 
the world. Later, they were men whose experiences made them doubt their 
own shadows. But all have the same motivation: Sensing the metaphysical 
chains that enslave them, they embark on epic journeys and outlandish 
schemes of escape. Even a vague destination, such as ``that place where 
we really wanna go,'' is enough. <br>
<br>
On his 11 records and in scores of songs that didn't make the initial 
cut, Springsteen articulated that formless yearning in simple phrases --
 ``everybody's got a hungry heart'' -- then whipped it into heroic 
music, a monumental sound that mowed down obstacles and held out the 
hope that any situation can be turned around, no matter how dire. He 
hammered at his pet theme with plain-spoken metaphors more typical of 
great novels than rock songs, and though he often returned to the same 
chord sequences and melody patterns, when all the elements collided, the
 quest somehow became significant again. Album after album -- and now 
outtake after outtake -- his edge-seeking outsiders travel the same sad 
highways looking for shreds of insight, and still the chance to ride 
along is irresistible. <br>
<br>
``Tracks'' follows Springsteen's characters down some of the winding 
roads his albums didn't take. It's a secret history, a compendium of 
insightful near-misses and telling footnotes. It's also one of the most 
unusual documents in this age of anthologies. Unlike the vault projects 
of most veterans, which consist of a few middling selections rejected 
long ago, ``Tracks'' is a trove of material that neatly corresponds to 
the thoroughly dissected classics of Springsteen's catalog. It starts 
with the singer's audition for famed producer John Hammond, and extends 
right up to August of this year, when he recorded the brooding ``Gave It
 a Name.'' In between are grand story-songs, bits of streetcorner wisdom
 and conversations with the angels, discards that would be top-shelf 
stuff from anyone else. <br>
<br>
Some germs of familiar ideas are here. Among the few outtakes from 
1982's ``Nebraska'' is a harrowing solo treatment of ``Born in the 
U.S.A.'' that casts the song in a new light, with Springsteen employing 
scalpel precision rather than the bellowing bigness of the 1984 hit. 
Some of the folks who populate the composer's well-known odes also haunt
 these ``lesser'' works: The Janey in ``Janey Don't You Lose Heart'' 
sounds like the same crazy girl we know from ``Spirits in the Night.'' <br>
<br>
The quantity of material is impressive enough: For a while there in the 
late '70s and early '80s, nobody in rock was more prolific. But it's the
 quality: The tracks of ``Tracks ''are dauntingly consistant, conclusive
 proof of Springsteen's legendary perfectionism. These aren't abandoned 
demos or sketchy mutterings. Most are full-blown productions, with 
intricate arrangements and carefully cultivated landscapes topped by 
vocals with the righteous fury of Springsteen's concert performances. <br>
<br>
The rejected tracks show how particular Springsteen was about the 
impression he wanted to leave with each album. In ``Songs'', his 
just-issued book of lyrics, he explains that during the recording of 
1978's ``Darkness on the Edge of Town, ''he paid deliberate attention to
 the mood he was creating: ``There was a lot of variation in the 
material we recorded, but I edited out anything I thought broke the 
album's tension.'' Among the telling trims that turn on ``Tracks'': the 
haunting piano ballad ``Iceman,'' and the more exuberant ``Rendezvous. 
Similarly, the tone of resignation that permeates ``The River'' would 
have been broken by songs he omitted, such as the thumping ``Roulette'' 
and the sunny ``Be True.'' <br>
<br>
Much has been made of Springsteen's development as a storyteller, his 
progression from the resolute optimism of ``Rosalita'' to the stark 
sketches of economic despair that colored ``Darkness'' and ``The 
River.'' ``Tracks'' illuminates his parallel musical evolution, from the
 sprawling suites of ``Born to Run'' to the blunt, hurtling anthems of 
``Born in the U.S.A.''; from the buoyant, galumphing shuffles such as 
1977's ``Give the Girl a Kiss,'' to compressed, tightly drawn character 
studies such as ``Rockaway the Days,'' recorded in 1984. <br>
<br>
It also makes plain something that the individual albums, particularly 
the later ones, obscure. For a long time, Springsteen and the E Street 
Band defined rock and roll with a swaggering stomp that could purr like a
 well-tuned engine or groan like a drunk facing the light of morning. 
That sound is ``classic rock'' in the best sense -- music that weaves in
 all that came before it: traces of the Bo Didley beat and the Chuck 
Berry bounce, Van Morrison's late-night blues and the earnest, lonesome 
sorrow of Hank Williams. <br>
<br>
When Springsteen and his band were anywhere near that territory -- on 
``Tracks,'' some of the majestic, pealing gems include ``Roulette,'' the
 rock-as-redemption ``Where the Bands Are,'' the anthemic ``I Wanna Be 
With You'' -- they were untouchable. But when they started chasing 
trends, as on the scattered attempts at New Wave here, they were 
laughably out of step. <br>
<br>
The most unexpected surprise of ``Tracks ''is its final disc, which 
gathers outtakes from ``Human Touch'' through the period after 
Springsteen's most recent recording, 1995's dour, acoustic project, 
``The Ghost of Tom Joad.'' If the material on the first three discs 
doesn't demand a complete re-evaluation of this artist's career, these 
final selections definitely do: Those who consider Springsteen to be a 
``heritage'' artist -- a contented veteran who undertakes a new project 
only when commissioned, as he did with the downcast ``Streets of 
Philadelphia'' -- will be surprised at the vibrancy of the throttling 
``Leavin' Train'' and ``Seven Angels,'' the bittersweet soul-singer 
understatement of ``Trouble in Paradise,'' the taut bar-band reggae of 
``Part Man Part Monkey.'' <br>
<br>
These songs and others suggest something remarkable about Springsteen: 
After all these years, he's still on the search. His characters may be 
extolling happiness rather than charging impulsively down a boundless 
Thunder Road, but they're still nagged by the big questions, still 
waiting for that determining moment, still wanting to know if love is 
real.</div>

In his only in-depth interview during 1995, Springsteen talks about the 
E-Street Band reunion, "alternative" rock, and his desire to turn up the
 volume.<br>
<br>
Guitar World , 1995-10<br>
By Neil Strauss<br>
<br>
You can tell a lot about a musician by how they arrive at an interview. 
Some come with their manager, others with a publicist. Some come with 
their bodyguards, others with a retinue of hangers-on. Bruce Springsteen
 came to this interview alone. He drove himself from his home in Rumson,
 New Jersey, to the Sony Studios in Manhattan in his black Explorer van,
 and he arrived early. Sitting alone with his backto the door in a 
darkened conference room, a mass of flannel and denim with a glinting 
silver-cross earring, he didn't need much prodding to be talked into 
heading to a nearby bar for drinks and atmosphere. <br>
<br>
Springsteen entered the 1990s on shaky ground. He fired his longtime 
back-up group, the E- Street Band, bought a $14 million spread in 
Beverly Hills, divorced his first wife, model Julianne Phillips, and 
married Patti Scialfa, a member of his backing band. Since then, his 
career has been the subject of hot debate. What is his relevance in 
the'90s? Does his solo work hold up to his recordings with the E-Street 
Band? Is he losing touch with his audience? <br>
<br>
But in the past year, Springsteen ended the controversy. He recorded his
 most successful solo song ever, "Streets of Philadelphia," earning 
himself a shelf full of Grammys and an Academy award, and re-formed the 
E-Street Band to record new songs for his greatest hits album, which 
shot to number one on the charts. On Labor Day weekend, he performed at 
the opening ceremony for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in 
Cleveland, an institution into which he will no doubt be inducted when 
he is eligible in two years. <br>
<br>
In a documentary being put together from twenty-three hours of film that
 were shot while the E- Street Band was recording the new songs last 
winter, the reunion seemed like an easy one. Three days after 
Springsteen called the band, they were in the studio, stretching what 
was supposed to be a two-day process into seven days. In one scene that 
doesn't seem created for the camera, the band gives their saxophonist, 
Clarence Clemons, a cake on his birthday and he gushes, "This is the 
best present a person could have for his birthday, being among you 
guys." During the recording of "Secret Garden," a song that Springsteen 
originally wrote for his upcoming solo album, the democratic process 
comes clear when Springsteen hands out pieces of paper so the band can 
anonymously vote for or against the inclusion of string arrangements in 
the song. <br>
<br>
Springsteen takes his interviews as seriously as he takes his music. 
During the questioning, he stared intently across the table, face still 
except for batting eyes, body solid and immobile except for constantly 
fidgeting hands, and set about answering each question as meaningfully 
as he could. Giving the waitress a 200 percent tip for his beer and a 
shot of tequila, he pulled up a chair at a table next to the jukebox in a
 dark corner of the bar and began. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: In reviewing materal and putting together your Greatest 
Hits album earlier this year, did you learn anything new about your 
songs or see the evolution of the characters that tie them together in 
any new way? <br>
<br>
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: I do think, if you lay out your work from end to end,
 automatically a story occurs. Particularly in my stuff, where I was 
interested in sustaining a thread of some sort, and following people 
through different parts of their lives. I did feel like I could see 
myself way back when at the beginning of the record, and then towards 
the end of the record I felt just very in the present. I learned a lot 
of things. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: Instead of doing a greatest hits album, did you ever 
consider just putting out what you thought were your most useful songs? <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: That would be so personal. It might be more interesting and
 maybe fun to write about, but the scheme of songs was pretty much Jon's
 [Landau, Springsteen's manager] idea. We didn't try to get into a best 
of, because everybody's got their own ideas. Basically it was songs that
 came out as singles. The only exception is "Thunder Road" but it seemed
 central. <br>
<br>
I like the classic idea of hits; some of them aren't hits, but you know.
 It was sort of like 50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong. That was what
 we were thinking when we put it out. It was supposed to be fun, 
something that you could vacuum the rug to if you wanted to. I think 
part of the reason we put the record out was that I wanted to introduce 
my music to younger fans who could go in and buy it for 12 bucks and get
 a pretty good overview of what I've done over the years. So it was an 
introduction for them and for my older fans I wanted to say, "This means
 something to me now, you mean something to me now." It was just kind of
 a way of re-affirming the relationship that I've built up with my 
audience over the past 25 years, which outside of my family is the most 
important relationship in my life. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: You didn't include any material from your first two LPs on
 this album. How did you decide what to put on the greatest hits album, 
and which of your new songs to save for later? <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Jon's idea was that the record start out with "Born to 
Run." My previous records were very sort of eclectic. He just thought 
the record started out nicely with that particular song, and it did. 
There was a discussion about whether to include "Blinded By the Light." 
It might have been another single. I guess if we were trying to give an 
accurate historical whole thing. But the bottom line is that there's a 
limited amount of space. We only wanted one CD so that it would be 
really affordable and people could go out and buy only one record 
without getting overly involved. And it's a sampler. The basic idea was 
that it be a sampler. I think songs change with the times, you 
recontextualize them. Part of the thing of doing a record like that is 
you get a chance to recontextualize them somewhat. In that sense, it'san
 opportunity to sort of hear something again. It's interesting because 
it does sound different in different contexts. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: The liner notes on this album sound so wistful. You talk 
of the lost innocence and naivete of your early work, yet as far back as
 "Thunder Road" you were writing, "Maybe we ain't that young anymore." <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: With the notes I was trying to use my own voice to bring 
the fans closer to that particular music. The music came from so many 
different places. Take "Thunder Road." It's a funny song, and it does 
have innocence in it, but at the same time it's sort of strange to write
 that particular line when you are twenty-four. And I think part of the 
notes was anxiety over that at the time. Oh my god, you know, is it 
over? Is it beginning? I don't know. Looking back on it, I've enjoyed a 
lot of it, I enjoyed those particular things. There's just a lot of 
powerful young musicians out there saying "Hey, there's something 
wonderful about that record coming on the radio, being broadcast through
 the whole country." <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: Many of those songs, most notably "Born in the USA" have 
been co-opted and misunderstood by politicians, probably because of the 
way you'll frame a dark song between anthemic choruses. How do you feel 
about that? <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: It's frustrating because if you look at it, people move to 
art for inspiration. But at some point, politics takes over. And I think
 as you get older, you battle against your own cynicism and your own 
despair. The pace that things change at, the way they change and the 
course they take gets trickier to fight against. You know, when you're 
writing songs, you're a storyteller, you're the myth maker and basically
 I think people go to art and music as a way to order their lives in a 
world that feels so out of order. It's a way of centering yourself and 
grounding yourself in a set of values, a sense of things that you can go
 back and touch base with. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: That's what songwriters are supposed to do in the classic 
sense. But musicians don't always think of themselves that way. Without 
giving up your pop dreams, you've managed to avoid letting them blind 
you to your relationship with your audience or your function in society.
 <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: It's interesting because when I started out making music I 
wasn't fundamentally interested in having a big hit right away. I was 
into writing music that was going to thread its way into people's lives.
 I was interested in becoming a part of people's lives, and having some 
useful-ness; that would be the best word. I would imagine a lot of 
people that end up going into the arts or film or music, at some point 
somebody told them they were useless. Everyone has felt that. So I know 
that one of the main motivations for me was to try to be useful, and 
then of course all those other pop dreams of the Cadillac or the girls. 
All the stuff that comes with it was there, but sort of on the 
periphery. In some way I was trying to find a fundamental purpose for my
 own existence. And basically trying to enter people's lives in that 
fashion and hopefully maintain that relationship over a lifetime, or at 
least as long as I felt I had something useful to say. That was why we 
took so long in between records. We made a lot of music. There's albums 
and albums sitting in the can. But I just didn't feel they were that 
useful. That was the way that I measured the records I put out. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: Would you ever release some of that unreleased material, some of the outtakes? <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: A lot of fans have asked for out-takes and I have so many 
sitting around. It might be fun at some point to throw together some 
sort of collection of some of the stuff that might have been the most 
fun; like my attempts at bubble-gum music and all the different genres 
of out-takes that might be interesting. I used to work in all these 
different genres and some of it was all the way from a bubble-gum sort 
of thing to stuff that felt more pop-oriented to the British invasion to
 all different sorts of things. We'd go in the studio and say, "Tonight 
is Beatles night," and we'd put things together that had all these 
influences just either for fun or because we thought they were going to 
work out at the time. In the end, I would generally opt for things that 
had the most of my own voice. But a lot of the other stuff was fun and 
at some point might be a blast for some of the fans to hear. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: What do you think your fans expect from you at this point in your career? <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: It varies. I think you have all different types of fans. 
You have very ideological fans who are concerned with your purity in 
some fashion and which is some sort of transference of their own stuff. 
And there are all different types of fans you know... and I guess your 
fan wants you to do your best work at any given point in time and move 
on down the road. You can't allow yourself to be paralyzed by the fact 
that you're not going to be all things to all people, that's all there 
is to it. That's just not going to happen. So you've got to sort of 
choose your own road, take your chances, and go with it.<br>
<br>
It happens to anybody who steps into the pop arena, you know. The pop 
world is a world of symbolism, it is not the real world, and I think it 
makes life difficult. But at this point, if you've had a long history of
 work, you'll meet people who are very attached to different parts of 
you at different points in your life and feel you went wrong after your 
first record, after your second record, then you found it again here, 
then you lost it.... I mean, there's so many different attitudes and 
opinions about what you should be and who you should be that you had 
better have a strong one of your own. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: Do you ever hear from long-term fans who think you sold out after your earlier albums? <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Yeah, in my hometown, because their was no electric guitar 
on it. I went back to my hometown, and all I heard was you know, "What 
happened to the electric guitar?" So it started right then. I think that
 you've got to have a strong opinion of your own, you've got to be 
centered or else those things are gonna keep you from going your own 
way. You can't get into a game of ultimately attempting to satisfy 
different segments of your audience, or your entire audience. It's 
alosing game, it's a loser's game. You've just got to play it as it lays
 and move on. That's the only chance I think you have of remaining vital
 and alive and grounded. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: Before you ever started recording, you were known more as a
 guitarist than as a songwriter. Do you ever think about stepping out as
 a guitarist again? <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: I did it to myself. I was always the guitar player in the 
band. But I reached a point in the early '70s where I said, "There are 
so many good guitarists, but there are not a lot of people who have 
their own voice in songwriting." And I really focused on songwriting. 
And then when I put a band together; because I was really signed as a 
folk artist by John Hammond, who didn't know that I everhad a band ever;
 they wanted a folk album. So basically everything came to be about 
ensemble playing. Clarence came along and he plays saxophone. He's sort 
of a force of nature, so if it was a solo I wanted to hear, I let him do
 it. I put a lot of my guitar playing in the rear, but I'd like at this 
point to bring it back. As a matter of fact, I played with the Blasters 
the other night. It was fun. I was back to being just a blues guitarist,
 which I used to play all the time. <br>
<br>
There's an L.A. roots-rock scene that's fabulous. There's a lot of 
tremendous musicians; country-and rockabilly-oriented groups; that are 
fabulous, like Big Sandy and the Flyright Trio. At some point, I'd like 
to toy around with making a record that's centered around loud guitars. 
I'll do it whenever I get a chance to play a little more. At some point I
 sort of opted out of the jam thing and opted into more just basically 
the songs being the message, where the solo was there in service of the 
music. At some point, I'd like to do something where I've got to really 
play, you know. Now I feel like I'm at a place where I can do anything 
that I'd like. I want to do the music that feels like my solo music, I 
want to work with the band. I like a lot of different types of music and
 musical styles. I want to have at some point a chance to use all those 
things. The best point about being at this place in your work is you can
 be more relaxed about it. I think it's more like your job now, and 
you're just going out and trying new things that are hopefully 
interesting for your fans and for you. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: You mentioned earlier about how "Thunder Road" seemed central to your work. Why do you think so? <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: I'm not sure what that song has. We played that song one 
night near here at the Sony studio when we were taping a European show, 
and it just felt all-inclusive. It may be something about trying to 
seize a particular moment in your life and realizing you have to make 
very fundamental and basic decisions that you feel will alter your life 
and how you live it. It's a funny song because it contains both dreaming
 and disillusionment simultaneously. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: That's kind of what Melissa Etheridge was saying when she 
introduced "Thunder Road" on Unplugged. It was just before you came 
onstage, and she said, "If anyone can make you dream, it's Bruce 
Springsteen." <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: You know, you write your music and you never know where the
 seeds that you sow are going to fall. Melissa Etheridge comes out of 
the Midwest, and she comes out of the gay bars, and I like that that's 
where some of my influences fall. I think that was a big part of what my
 songs were about: being who you are, and trying to make the world that 
you want to live in in some fashion. I think you just want to do your 
bit and carry on the flame, and do what was done for you by a generation
 of musicians. <br>
<br>
I was basically a traditionalist and I saw I liked the whole idea of a 
lineage of rock and roll in some fashion. My whole idea was I always saw
 myself as the kid who stepped up out of the front row and onto the 
stage and had the guitar for a while and carried that particular flame. 
And you take it as far as you can and write your own map for other 
people to follow a little bit. You try to not make the mistakes that 
people who came before you made and in some fashion reset some of the 
rules of the game if you can. So that was my idea about what I was here 
to do. I wasn't interested in immediate success or how much each 
particular record was selling. I was interested in becoming part of 
peoples' lives and part of fans' lives and hopefully growing up with 
them, you know, growing up together. <br>
<br>
I grew up on popular music. I came from a small town. The subversiveness
 of the top 40 radio can't be over-estimated. I grew up on music that 
was popular, that was in the top 20 or the top 40, or whatever it was at
 that time. I sat in my bedroom and I wrote the top 20 down religiously 
every Wednesday night, cheering for my heroes and hissing the villains 
of the day. So I wanted to play in that arena. I believed that it was a 
place where you will find both the strengths and the limitations of your
 work, who you are and who you are not. And I thought it was a 
worthwhile thing to risk. There was an element of risk in it because 
you're very exposed, you're very under the magnifying glass, and it can 
be relentless and brutal. For me the town I grew up in was very divided;
 racially and classwise; and yet there were songs that united everyone 
at some point, like the great Motown music. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: It's funny because alternative rock now is almost a 
reaction against your experience of music growing up. They don't want to
 carry the flame but to stamp it out. Yet you've told me before how much
 you like alternative music, and I saw you play with Soul Asylum in New 
York. <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Look at a band like Nirvana. That's a band that reset the 
rules of the game. They changed everything, they opened a vein of 
freedom that didn't exist previously. The singer did something very 
similar to what Dylan did in the '60s, which was to sound different and 
get on the radio. Your guitarist could sound different and get heard. So
 there are a lot of very fundamental rules that they reset, and that 
type of band is very few and far between. The same with a lot of early 
rap stuff, which was a return of the rawness of the '50s' records, 
direct from the street. And it changed the conventional ideas of how 
drums should sound, how guitars should sound, how a singer should sound;
 even if you have to sing at all. So those are things that keep the 
music moving forward. <br>
<br>
With alternative music, I think sometimes about the overall 
corporateness of everything and how that effects your thought processes.
 How do you find a place of your own when you're constantly being 
bombarded with just so much frigging information that you really and 
truthfully don't need? What you see on TV is not a mirror image of most 
people's daily existence. Your chances of having a violent altercation 
are relatively small, unless you watch television, in which case you'll 
be brutalized every day. And I think that what people are feeling is 
other people's fingerprints on their mind. And that seems to be a real 
strong and vital subject at the moment that runs through a lot of 
alternative music. And I feel it myself, you know. And hey, there needs 
to be a voice against that sort of co-option of your own thinking space.
 What are your memories? What are your ideas? Everything is 
pre-packaged, whether it's baby-boomer memories or whatever, and sold to
 you as desirable or seductive in some fashion. So how do you find out 
who you are, create your own world, find your own self? That's the 
business of rock music in the 90s. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: How did you meet Soul Asylum? <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Basically I just came to see them perform. They opened up 
for Keith Richards, and I went backstage and we just briefly spoke. I 
think he said he had seen us years ago in Minneapolis, and we just kind 
of said hello and met the guys in the band. I was familiar with the band
 mostly just from the Grave Dancers. I hadn't heard their earlier stuff.
 They did a great version of "Rhinestone Cowboy" when they opened for 
Richards. And they said, just come up and play, and I just came up and 
sat in a little bit. They're just a good band, a real good band, 
[Pirner's] a good songwriter. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: When people refer to you, they say, praisingly, that you're "real." What do you think that means? <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: I'm not sure what it means. I'm not sure if it's the right 
word. Maybe grounded might be better to put it. When I separated from 
the E-Street Band, there was tremendous feedback from the fans. Somefans
 were hurt because I think one of the values of my music was about 
loyalty, friendship, and remembering the past. So at some point, the 
question becomes how do you stay true to those values but yet grow up 
and become your own man. And I think I've tried to thread my way through
 those things as best as possible. And I think I've done pretty good. I 
certainly haven't done perfectly and, of course, it ain't over yet. But I
 think that basically you know there's a certain amount of things that 
every fan creates for you in their head that may not be completely you 
in any fashion. I think the pressure to be grounded and for fans to feel
 like you're speaking to them in some fashion is good. That's what I 
want to do. But you also want to make the music you want to make, live 
the life that wherever the road you're travelling on leads you, and live
 with the contradictions that are a part of finding the large audience 
and having the success in the world that you live in. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: Pirner has said that his friends don't trust him to be real anymore. Have you experienced that, too? <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: You always deal with that. There are certain friends that 
believe your success changes them. I'm lucky. I have a handful of 
relationships I've had since I was very young, and that I maintain, and 
that mean a great, great deal to me, both within the band and a few 
outside of the band. It's tricky. There are people who assume since this
 happened and that happened, you've changed. You do change in some ways,
 but not necessarily in some fundamental ways. It depends on who you are
 and what you want. I wanted these friendships to last. Thereare these 
three brothers particularly that I spend time with back when I'm home, 
and take these trips into the desert on motorcycles once a year. We have
 a great time. I'm not sure how everybody experiences those types of 
friendships as they grow older. But I'm lucky in that I did something 
where people that I met when I was very young, people that I liked, and 
that liked me, we did something together. We did something. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: Have you ever gone anywhere where people had never heard of New Jersey? <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: I played a show in San Francisco. I used to open up for 
Charlie Musslewhite and Boz Scaggs, and I remember being in the men's 
room. This guy goes, "Where are you from?" I said, "New Jersey." He 
said, "What's that?" I said, "It's a state! Don't you know?!" I always 
remember that. For some reason that always stayed with me, that guy 
standing there saying "What's that?" <br>
<br>
Another hilarious thing that happened was I was in Holland and this guy 
takes us out in a boat and we go to this pizza place and for some reason
 we got started talking about Holland. And he starts saying, "They don't
 know what they're doing. You know how you go to the United States and 
there's the New Jershians." He kept pronouncing it "New Jershians." Now 
he doesn't know where we're from. "The New Jershians, they don't know 
their asses from a hole in the head. The New Jershians." So he's 
speaking to an entire table full of New Jershians. And we go, "Wait a 
minute buddy, we're from New Jersey." <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: When you write a song, how do you know whether it's an E-Street Band song or a solo song? <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: The band is a connection to a sort of broader subject 
matter. I think if I go to write for them, I'll write differently than I
 will when I go to write for myself. It's very internal, psychologi-cal,
 my solo writing. So one of my interests in reconnecting was writing 
slightly broader subject matter with them once again. For some reason, 
and I don't know why, their presence moves me in that direction. <br>
<br>
When I was working on my last bunch of material, I realized there is 
something I tend not to do without the band's presence. And I was 
wondering what that was. I think that the band was a symbolic bridge 
between me and my audience. When you lead a musician's transient life, 
the community that you imagined and wrote about, you don't really become
 a part of. The band was sort of the physical manifestation of those 
things, your neighbors, and your friends, and the people you've got to 
live with. When I go to write for myself, it's very internal and 
psychological. So one of my interests in reconnecting with the band was 
writing slightly broader subject matter with them once again. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: Was "Blood Brothers" [on the Greatest Hits album] a sort 
of re-examination of what the E-Street Band meant to you, and why you 
fired them though you know they will always be with you in some form or 
fashion? <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: "Blood Brothers" was sort of trying to understand the 
meaning of friendship as you grow older. I guess I wrote it the night 
before I went in the studio with the band, and I was trying to sort out 
what I was doing and what those relationships meant to me now and what 
they mean to you as you move through your life. Basically, I guess I 
always felt that the friendships, the loyalties and the relationships, 
those are the bonds that keep you from slipping into the abyss of 
self-destruc-tiveness. And without those things, that abyss feels a lot 
closer, on your heels. I think your own nihilism feels a lot closer 
without someone to grab you by the arm and pull you out of it and say, 
"Hey, come on, you're having a bad day." So with the song I was trying 
to sort out the place that those deep friendships played in my life, 
friendships that I had when I was young. We all grew up together, and 
people got married and divorced and had babies and went through their 
addictions and out the other side, and we drove each other crazy. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: Did it feel right to be back with the band again, like a return to something? <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: We hadn't worked together in eight years and really hadn't 
recorded together in 10 years. I did a lot of solo stuff, which I found 
satisfying. But at the same time, I don't think I'd want to have to 
choose between the band and the solo stuff. I think I'd like to have 
both things. One of the things I realized when I saw the guys was that 
when we sit, they're like your arms and your legs and you. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: When you sing in "Blood Brothers," "I don't know why I 
made this call/Or if any of this matters anymore after all," is that 
about when you called up and fired each band member? <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: No, because we got along pretty well, all the guys in the 
band. I mean we had our moments and everybody drove everybody else nuts 
sometimes. But people pretty much liked one another, maybe because it 
wasn't a band that was set up as a democracy, like maybe the Rolling 
Stones are, but it wasn't either purely people I'd hired as a backing 
band. It was somewhere in the grey area in the middle. I wanted 
something that felt like mine, I wanted people that I felt close to, I 
wanted the best of both worlds: creative control and people whom I could
 collaborate emotionally with, who felt connected to the music and the 
things I was writing about. <br>
<br>
Over the years that we were not working together, we had various 
conversations, some conten-tious. Some people were hurt, some people 
were angry. But I love all the guys in the band. So it wasn't hard. We 
decided on like a Thursday to record some new songs. I think I called 
the guys, and we were all together on the following Monday or Tuesday 
and just happy to see one other. <br>
<br>
You have to understand, there were guys that I met in that band when we 
were 19 years old, in Asbury Park. We were all together for 20 years. So
 it's very unusual that the people you met when you were 19 you're still
 sitting in the same room with when you're 39. And it bred a certain 
sort of dedication. It came with a certain sense of purpose. And there's
 an intimacy that occurs after hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of 
nights on stage that is very unique. I'm not sure what I would compare 
it to. Imagine that; imagine finding a group of people when you were 
just out of high school that you did something together with that lasted
 for 25 or 35 years. It's an amazing thing. And it's a gift that life 
doesn't often afford. Without sounding too hokey about it, it was pretty
 easy to call everybody up. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: The word reunion implies nostalgia, a return to the past. How can you keep that from happening? <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: I'd like to think that my main interest with working with 
the band would be about the new music that I'm going to write. That 
would be my interest in the connection because, like I said, I've worked
 for ten years and I've found that I sort of drift in a particular 
direction, and I think that for some reason their presence moves me to 
write in a broader; for lack of a better term; subject matter. <br>
<br>
I think what circumvents nostalgia, hopefully, is depth. And with work 
that's had a big impact for me, something like "Like a Rolling Stone," 
it can stir up nostalgic feelings. But when you're playing it, and 
you're continually listening to it, and it's just really great; then, 
now, whenever. It's just really good. So I think that you've got to 
carry the baggage that you've travelled with over the years, but I 
wouldn't be interested in working with a band as an exercise in 
nostalgia. It wouldn't be particularly interesting. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: For many musicians, having children changes the way they 
write songs and experience the world. Is that true with you? <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: When you have your children basically the best thing, the 
nicest thing you can do for them is to slip into their time, into the 
way that they experience the world and the way that they experience the 
day. And that can be hard to do if you're a restless, anxious, nervous 
person, and if you're also someone who at some point has always asked 
people to step into your world. Once you have the kids, you realize 
that's hard to do. By the time I had kids, I'd burned out on the idea 
of, you know, whatever that idea is about living internally and for your
 own excitement. I just had to give that up, that type of control. I 
think at some point you don't need that as much as you thought you did. 
You feel more centered and safer with kids and marriage, so then you 
have a lot more emotional flexibility, and that allows you to go along 
with other peoples' lives. For me it can still be a struggle sometimes. I
 think I've been a good dad, but it calls for a whole other type of 
responses than the ones that I've used for the past 30 years. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: Before you ever married, you wrote a number of songs about characters that had wives and kids. <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Yeah, I was probably testing it out. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: Do you feel that you portrayed those relationships accurately before you had even experi-enced them? <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Well, there were a lot of different types of portrayal. I 
guess the songs that come to mind when you talk about it would probably 
be "The River," "I Want to Marry You," which is just a guy standing on 
the corner fantasizing, and "Stolen Cars." I stayed away from that 
subject for a long time. I didn't write about relationships, probably 
because I didn't know much about 'em and I wasn't very good at 'em, and 
also it was a subject in pop music that had been written about so much 
and I wasn't interested in writing just your classic sort of pop love 
songs. Later on when I did write about them, I tended to write about 
them with all the complications, the real complications, that they 
involve. I tried to write a more realistic sort of love song, like 
"Brilliant Disguise" or any of the stuff from Tunnel of Love, or any of 
the stuff from my Lucky Town record. I just wanted something that felt 
grounded in the kind of tension and compromise that these things really 
involve. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: What kind of advice would you give the young Bruce Springsteen now? <br>
<br>
SPRINGSTEEN: Two things. One, I would tell him to approach his job like 
on one hand, it's the most serious thing in the world and on the other 
hand, as if it's only rock and roll. You have to keep both of those 
things in your head at the same time, simultaneously. I still believe 
you have the possibility of influencing peoples' lives in some fashion, 
and at the same time it's only entertainment and you want to get people 
up and dancing. I think I took it very seriously. I don't regret doing 
so, but I think that I would have been a bit easier on myself as I went 
along and I would have been less self-punishing at different times if 
I'd remembered that it was only rock and roll. Being a little bit 
worried about it can be dangerous. It's a minefield, it's dangerous for 
your inner self and also for whatever your ideas and values are that you
 want to sing about. It should be fun too. <br>
<br>
You drift down your different self-destructive roads at different times 
and hopefully you have those bonds that pull you back out of that abyss 
and say, 'Hey, wait a minute." I was in London and I was twenty-five and
 there were posters of me everywhere in this theater that were making me
 want to throw up and puke. I was disgusted at what I'd become, and then
 someone in the band would say, "Hey, do you believe we're in London, 
England, and we're going to play tonight and somebody's going to pay us 
for it?" So I was lucky. I had good friends and a good support network 
that assisted me along the way. In retrospect, I look back on those 
times now and they were just funny, you know. My concern was because I'd
 read the maps of the people that came before me and I was interested in
 being something different, and accomplishing something slightly 
different. So that was why I was worried, and there was good cause for 
worry. <br>
<br>
NEIL STRAUSS: And what advice would the young Bruce Springsteen give you? <br>
<br>

Bruce's creative juices; the evolution of a myth<br>
<br>
Trouser Press , 1980-10<br>
By Wayne King<br>
<br>
He had the reputation as the best guitar player on the Jersey shore. He 
had led various bands through all styles of rock'n roll: a 
Southern-based sound, not unlike the Allmann Bros., with Steel Mill; a 
10-piece R&amp;B revue with the Bruce Springsteen Band, and a host of 
other groupings and stylings. By 1972 he was on his own, an eccentric 
solo act with verbose songs mocking his painful Catholic past. Armed 
with only his eclectic talent, a guitar and pushy new manager Mike 
Appel, he auditioned for CBS executive John Hammond. Hammond was 
mightily impressed by intense and enigmatic tunes like "Arabian Nights,"
 "Growin' Up," "If I Was the Priest" and "Southern Son"; he signed up 
Bruce Springsteen immediately. <br>
<br>
But there were troubles straight out. The scope of Springsteen's 
songwriting abilities led to a misconception of his talent. John Hammond
 pictured him as a solo performer (as did Appel), although hed had a few
 ideas about expanding Springsteen's natural charisma beyond the 
traditional singer-songwriter image. This confusion resulted in some 
Columbia promotional genius dreaming up the disastrous "new Dylan" hype.
 If anything, Springsteen was more updated Beat than new Dylan: his ?50s
 images, verbal excesses and obsessions with organized religion and the 
city lacked only a cool jazz backing. Rock was his medium, though, and 
he quickly left the revival of Beat images and values to Tom Waits. <br>
<br>
Problems arose from lack of experience all around. The Jim Cretecos/Mike
 Appel Production team simply could not realize the rock 'n' roll 
inherent in Springsteen's songs, and the singer's own ignorance of 
studio possibilities resulted in the restrained sound of Greetings from 
Asbury Park (1973). Springsteen played "It's hard to Be a Saint in the 
City" for John Hammond with a clear idea of the tune as a rock number. 
Yet the version on vinyl (a last-minute replacement for the anti-war 
"American Tune," which made it onto some early promotional copies) fades
 on the final chorus, precisely where in concert the song develops into a
 jet-propelled guitar duel between Springsteen and Miami Steve Van 
Zandt. <br>
<br>
Many of the conflicts surrounding his image and music were abetted by 
Springsteen himself. Sometimes it seemed even he didn't know what was 
going to happen next. At any given moment Danny Federici could move from
 organ to accordion and Gary Tallent from bass to tuba, as on the folkie
 aberration "The Bishop Danced" (on the premiere King Biscuit Flower 
Hour show). Springsteen didn't discard all his folkie tendencies until 
1974, and his eclecticism often led to a disjointed show. But it was 
this drive, this push towards a personal music structure, that was his 
greatest strength. Rock's best accomplishments come from exploration, 
but the results must always be true to form. Springsteen most resembles 
Pete Townshend, whose experiments with larger structures and electronics
 are always laid on to top of the Who's solid rock foundation. <br>
<br>
Springsteen went about things in nearly the opposite way, but the 
results were often powerfully similar. He took all his discoveries and 
constantly edited them down, channeling and focusing his explorations 
into a dynamic, increasingly simple form. Critics misjudged him to be an
 encyclopedic nostalgist; instead, as Greil Marcus described the Band's 
music, "[its] richness...is the ability to contain endless combinations 
of American popular music without imitating any of them.... This was a 
new sound, but you could recognize yourself in that sound." <br>
<br>
His ambitions stimulated his muse; tunes rolled off his pen, and 
arrangements changed often. More and more he remolded his image from 
wordy performer to the Boss, the E Street Band leader, a role reflected 
in ever-increasing soul influences. He still wrote songs that depended 
for impact on a flow of obscure but enticing words - songs like "And the
 Band Played" and "Santa Ana": <br>
<br>
...and the giants of science spend their days and nights not with wives,
 not with lovers but searching for the lights they're spotted in the 
desert on their helicopter flights. <br>
<br>
But more and more his writing reflected old soul influences and his 
storytelling power revealed itself in tales of kids living out desperate
 lives. <br>
<br>
Resurrected from days of Dr. Zoom and His Sonic Boom was "You Mean So 
Much to Me" (later covered on the first Jukes LP as a duet by Southside 
Johnny and Ronnie Spector, herself a goddess in the crucial Spector 
pantheon). "Zero and Blind Terry" and "The Beat Song," both recorded for
 the second album, emphasized Springsteen's growing concern with teen 
escape and its means. "Zero" was not unlike Del Shannon's "Stranger in 
Town" - a tale of two kids on the run - but degenerated into a paranoid 
fantasy where "Terry's dad hired some troopers to kill Zero and bring 
Terry back home." "The Beat Song" contained a few phrases later into 
"Born to Run," and kicked off with display of developing automobile 
ethos: <br>
<br>
Well Billy bought a Chevy for the coupe deluxe Chrome wheels, stick 
shift, hey, give her gas, pop the clutch... The highway id alive 
tonight, so baby do not be frightened There's somethin' 'bout a pretty 
girl on a sweet summer night that gets this boy excited. <br>
<br>
Though the tune featured a peppy Farfisa sound reminiscent of so many of
 Springsteen's Nuggets-era faves, both "The Beat Song" and "Zero" were 
not quite ready because he had not yet developed his own rock 
songwriting style. Their action takes place in suburbs and on highways; 
Springsteen was still thinking soul, and soul's action is pure city. <br>
<br>
And so his ambition led him to tackle the biggest city of them all on 
1973's The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle. "New York City 
Serenade" was first tried out on stage, an entirely different idea from 
what it became: just Springsteen and Clarence Clemons would come out to 
start the show. (Slow, mostly solo openings were a Springsteen stage 
rule for the next few years.) The tune fit in more with Greetings 
material: <br>
<br>
...and with a tommygun blast he got the people screamin', runnin' from 
the streets 'Til he falls helpless in Time Square just like street scum 
cryin' "New York City kills her young, New York City kills her young" 
From a tenement window a baby cries. <br>
<br>
From that rather wild view, Springsteen stretched out the music and cut 
the words down to a more impressionistic picture. To finish the sound 
tapestry he added ghostly strings, whistling through his man-made urban 
canyons. <br>
<br>
The city, its characters and a fascination with sound dominated The 
Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle. The tittle song, a raucous 
R&amp;B party/noise number, was derived from Major Lance's "Monkey 
Time." "Kitty's Back" built off a blues base into a wild piece of 
improvisation; it was to be the instrumental showpiece for the next two 
years. The real signpost for the future, though, was "Incident on 57th 
Street." Springsteen was now entering his West Side Story period, and 
finally finding his own voice in his songwriting. Wisely, with the 
second album he had chosen to display his influences openly. Now he had 
to dig deeper into his own vision, his own perspective on rock history, 
to make good on all the possibilities his talent promised. <br>
<br>
Towards that end, Springsteen used the stage to try out his experiments.
 The E Street Band was tightened by replacing drummer "Mad Dog" Vini 
Lopez with Ernest "Boom" Carter, a friend of keyboardist David Sancious.
 Shows were getting longer and wilder; old rockers were tossed into the 
mayhem, arrangements changed almost nightly, and new compositions were 
being revised and added on all the time. <br>
<br>
Tying into the past to create a context for his work, Springsteen began 
to feature regularly oldies that were closest to the spirit of his own 
ideas. "The future of rock'n roll" had to assimilate rock's past before 
distilling (his idea of) its essence into his work. Thus Rufus Thomas's 
"Walking the Dog," Fats Domino's "Let the Four Winds Blow" and "I'm 
Ready," the Chiffons' "A Love So Fine" (recorded later, during the Born 
to Run sessions), teendream master Chuck Berry's "You Never Can Tell" 
and "No Money Down" all worked their way into the act. <br>
<br>
Sandwiched around these numbers were new versions of older songs; the 
drive toward new form caused Springsteen to change his mind on the best 
way to present set compositions. "The E Street Shuffle," for instance, 
was played at the LP version's tempo for a while, but soon slowed down 
and eventually became the setting for a tall tale of Springsteen's 
initial meeting with future King of the World Master of the Universe 
Clemons. "For You" evolved into an excruciatingly beautiful piece, with 
Springsteen alone at the piano; the entire mood of the song and the show
 itself was transformed by his haunting vocal. "New York City Serenade,"
 a constant up until Born to Run, became even longer and more 
intensetruly epic in proportion. <br>
<br>
"Epic" is as useful a word as any to describe Springsteen's songwriting 
attempts of this period. Although his ambition, coupled with a growing 
fanatical appreciation of his talent, was leading up to a post-Born to 
Run backlash that hasn't yet died out, it was at this time that he 
shifted into high gear. "Born to Run" was written and laid down in early
 summer, 1974, its layers of guitars, strings and even a female chorus 
(in one of the dozens of mixes) a striking example of the man's desire 
to put everything into his music. "Jungleland" also popped into shows 
around this time, drastically different from the final product, with 
even a swing jazz middle (probably the last contribution of 
jazz-oriented Sancious, who departed with Carter in August to be 
replaced by Roy Bittan and Max Weinberg). <br>
<br>
Compositions were coming out slowly, but Springsteen's conception of 
them was dramatically broad and varied. He had shifted his focus from 
big-city soul to its white equivalent (say, from Ben E. King to Phil 
Spector) but held onto strings as an essential part of the orchestral 
sound in his head. Violinist Suki Lahav, wife of engineer Louis Lahav, 
joined the band in the fall. In December and January, 1975, Springsteen 
headed to the studio to make a new record. <br>
<br>
Springsteen's attempts at making Born to Run were to be frustrating, and
 unfortunately set the norm for his work habits in the studio from then 
on (in one word: lonnng). The new material demanded a unified texture 
but he could not decide which elements to take out of the impossibly 
tangled tapestry of sounds that made them up. Strings added to most of 
the longer numbers fit in nicely since they had been written on piano 
and not guitar. "Backstreets" was once sweetened this way; "Jungleland" 
also featured strings in place of the saxophone solo. <br>
<br>
The enormity of the project and the band's impoverished state put them 
back on the road in February, delaying completion of the LP but helping 
out in other ways. Weinberg and Bittan were settling in and expanding 
the range of the E Street Band; this was better accomplished on stage 
than in the studio. Rock history has consistently shown that live work 
clears up many problems studios create, for - in concert - songs must 
communicate more directly to satisfy the audience. Songs also became 
tighter and harder with roadwork., and this was exactly where expansive 
Springsteen's newest compositions needed help. His performances helped 
boil down his style to the monolithic sound on Born to Run. <br>
<br>
A radio broadcast from the Main Point in Philadelphia (a 
rabidly-Springsteen town) in early 1975 demonstrated how far he had come
 and, conversely, how much further he had to go. Springsteen opened with
 a tremendously changed " Incident on 57th Street" - just voice, violin 
and piano blended together tenderly. He followed it with a rowdy, trashy
 version of Harold Dorman's "Mountain of Love"; joining wonderful rock 
junk to a fragile arrangement of one of his greatest streets enhanced 
both. As the show rolled on, Springsteen alternately confused and 
dazzled the crowd with still-developing tunes like "She's the One" and 
"Thunder Road." The latter, including a Latinate instrumental ending, 
contained most of the finished lyrics except, curiously, the phrase 
"Thunder Road." He even tackled Dylan, using Lahav's yearning violin to 
cry out "I Want You." <br>
<br>
By testing new material on radio in an area where he should have been 
doing his damnedes to consolidate his popularity - such as playing 
standards straight - Springsteen displayed not only his conviction but 
the desperation of his musical dilemma. Yet even a month on the road 
didn't clear things up. <br>
<br>
Springsteen ended up at New York's Record Plant with new co-producer 
John Landau, and spent what he has since called the worst time of his 
life living behind soundproofed walls. He dug deep - not only into 
rock'n' roll past - but his own; he revived a few lines from "Santa Ana"
 for "She's the One," and went back as far as "Jazz Musician" 
(auditioned for John Hammond) to get some words for "Tenth Avenue Freeze
 Out." That he still wasn't satisfied after the record was completed was
 proven by his itchy desire to scrap it all and record the Bottom Line 
(New York) dates, and perhaps by the evolution of "Thunder Road" and 
"She's the One." <br>
<br>
The versions heard at the Main Point were altered greatly as 
Springsteens searched for what he wanted. "She's the One" was strangely 
violent: "You were with me in New York the time they pushed real hard 
and baby I got beat/You left me wasted - wasted, darlin', right there in
 the street." It also contained more than a few chunks of what became 
"Backstreets": "... and we hated the cops/I hated the lies, and I hated 
the truth that ran us down. "Finally whittled down to the album's ode to
 an impossible angel, Springsteen added a chugging harmonica 
introduction after Born to Run's release, and later incorporated Bo 
Diddley's "Mona" into its rhythmic opening. <br>
<br>
"Thunder Road" changed even more. Originally "Walking in the Streets" 
(which melody eventually became "Thunder Road"'s instrumental coda), it 
went through some interim versions in its story of a heist: <br>
<br>
Oh, baby, I can't lay the stars at your feet Oh, but I think we could 
take it all, just you and me Oh, c'mon and see, there's a lot of room 
for you, baby, in the back seat. <br>
<br>
The Main Point version had some neat lines that were cut later: <br>
<br>
Now the season's over, and I feel I getting cold I wish I could take to 
some sandy beach where we'd never grow old Oh, but baby, you know that's
 just jive The night's bustin' open and I'm alive Oh, baby, if you can 
make me feel like a man. <br>
<br>
When he had the words down nearly to what was finally recorded, 
Springsteen cut a demo alone on acoustic guitar and let the band go 
through it. Born to Run's "Thunder Road" had the characteristically hard
 mix that dominated the disc. After all that time spent figuring out a 
full band arrangement, though, Springsteen toured with it as a solo 
piece, sometimes opening shows with just one piano, his harmonica and a 
heart-tugging reading of the romantic lyric. As he told Crawdaddy's 
Peter Knobler: "None of my songs ever end. I've been thinking about it, 
and all of them sort of just go on ... but I think I like it that way." 
Some understatement. <br>
<br>
With great relief, Springsteen and band took to the highway to break out
 of the often confining "cult" straitjacket and support their 
make-or-break record. Old shore buddy Miami Steve joined up, taking over
 most guitar duties from Springsteen, who virtually turned his back on 
the instrument for a while. The instantly legendary Bottom Line stint 
showcased an almost brash Boss, firmly believing in the power and guts 
of the album and his own reputation. The resultant furor over "hype" and
 the media maelstrom that threatened to engulf everybody only helped 
establish his name; he acquitted himself admirably in the face of a "too
 much, too soon" celebrity that could have destroyed his careful 
balance. <br>
<br>
The enormous response Born to Run received extended to packed clubs and 
halls (the tour, with small venues, was booked before the record's 
release). The show was the best yet. Rocking harder than ever, 
Springsteen ripped through remaining barriers between him and his 
audience. "Kitty's Back" was opened up to encompass all aspects of the 
band's abilities. It built through shifting solos from organ, piano and 
guitar, finally tearing halls asunder with the "ooh, all right" chorus 
and otherworldly blowing from Clemons, the Big Man. "Rosalita" finally 
matched its power on record, firmly taking position as pre-encore 
finale. <br>
<br>
The Spector beat of "Then She Kissed Me" slid easily into the set; it 
was clearly a tribute to one of Springsteen's most deeplyfelt 
influences. Mitch Ryder and The Detroit Wheels' white R&amp;B antics 
were loosely grouped in the "Detroit Medley" of "Devil with a Blue 
Dress/Good Golly, Miss Molly/C.C. Rider/Jenny Take a Ride." 
Springsteen's non-originals were now mainly second-generation white 
rock'n' roll, embracing even the British Invasion. The Searchers' "When 
You Walk in the Room," with its folk-rock hints, and Manfred Mann,s 
"Pretty Flamingo" were handled gracefully. <br>
<br>
English rock was to pervade Springsteen's writing through the next year,
 but for the rest of the tour he wrote nothing, nor did he introduce 
newly-penned numbers on stage. Although his work is most effective in 
the heat of performance, it is often constructed under conditions of 
solitude. Springsteen's ability to create quintessential rock while 
removed from its natural milieu is sometimes staggering, but it is 
always a time-consuming process. In late 1975 he simply did not have 
time to take the next step his musical progress demanded. <br>
<br>
A British CBS ad at the time read, "1976 is the year of Bruce 
Springsteen - why wait?" Because of increasingly legal hassles with soon
 to be ex-manager Appel, Springsteen's follow-through on his new success
 would have to wait. He was shut out of the studio for next year and a 
half. In a way, though, this impossed legal limbo sparked a maturity 
that may not have developed under less pressure. He kept busy by touring
 the South for two months, showing off his latest piece, "Frankie. 
"Summer went by without any activity except a week of shows in Red Bank,
 New Jersey, in August, and the shaving of his beard. With fall came 
work on the road, including a first try at an arena. The drive of his 
music coincided with the necessary push towards playing bigger places; 
he simply thought bigger and played tougher and longer. <br>
<br>
Springsteen intensified his vision by emphasizing the major Anglo 
musicians who had appealed to him as a youth: the Rollling Stones and 
the Animals. Like a lot of people, he learned about Buddy Holly, Bo 
Diddley and especially Chuck Berry from the Stones, and later went back 
to the original sources. Even more important were the Animals; "It's my 
Life" and "We Gotta Get Out of This Place" were precise indicators of 
the moral frontiers Springsteen was exploring. "It's My Life" 's 
father-and-son story is both frighteningly personal and universally 
recognizable. Springsteen made it such a depressingly accurate picture 
of a buried life that it exhausted his audience. Only "Tunder Road," his
 anthem to romantic salvation, could follow it. "We Gotta Get Out of 
This Place" chronicled perpectly the working-class idea, so crucial to 
his Darkness material, of escape from traps that had already claimed 
one's parents. <br>
<br>
His own attempt at British Invasion-style writing was "Rendezvous," a 
mediumtempo pop- rocker later offered to the Knack and covered by Greg 
Kihn. Other tunes unveiled on the fall tour were the mournful "The 
Promise" and "Something in the Night." The Latter, with a melancholy 
trumpet (the Asbury Jukes' Miami Horns section sat in with the E Street 
Band on occasion), was a world-weary rendition. Its wordiness was 
indicative of original Springsteen ideas; it was cut down on Darkness, 
with transcendent moans replacing excessive phrases. <br>
<br>
The rest of the songs were cranked up to seam-busting power. Springsteen
 had reached the pinnacle of his narrative abilities; "It's My Life" and
 "Growin' Up" featured his best stories (faithfully recounted by the 
Boss' Boswell, Dave Marsh, in his excellent bio). "Backstreets," victim 
of a claustrophobic mix on Born to Run, was now powerful in its 
spaciousness. Roy Bittan contributed a delicate piano opening, and the 
middle was enlarged to focus on the story of a lie - a breaking of a 
promise so deep its pain was built into a majestic howl alongside "the 
bells that ring in the deep part of the night." The Preoccupation with 
faith and the difficulties of sustaining it combined with a capacious 
structure to anticipate the rock blues form that became Darkness. <br>
<br>
With a spring trip through the Norteast and Midwest under his belt, and 
the lawsuit settled in May, 1976, it was time to make a new record. At 
first it seemed as if things would go quickly, but Springsteen's writing
 technique had changed from continual expansion to gradual reduction. 
This editing did not come easy, for to retain everything in his music 
and employ a more direct style was nearly impossible. Not that it would 
have been easier for anyone else; after all, it took Pete Townshend all 
of Quadrophenia to sum up what "My Generation" said in three minutes. 
Springsteen's songs were now shorter, slower and better structured. He 
continually reworked them, remodeling until only the spirit remained, 
framed by a deceptively simple construction. This sound was to be the 
culmination of all his efforts. <br>
<br>
Being out of the studio for two years didn't handicap Springsteen's 
songwriting abilities. The problem was quite the opposite: choosing 
which of many songs should be included. His push towards the sound he 
needed eliminated many fine numbers. Some came out elsewhere. Southside 
Johnny and the Jukes received "Hearts of Stone" and "Talk to Me" for 
their third album, which came out after Darkness; Robert Gordon recorded
 "Fire" in early '78. More important was the collaboration with Patti 
Smith, "Because the Night." Since Springsteen engineer Jimmy Iovine 
produced the Smith record, it is no coincidence that its sound was a 
good indication of what Springsteen had been looking for. His words 
differed from hers a bit, though, concentrating more on the struggle 
than the escape: "What I've got I have earned/ What I'm not, baby, I 
have learned." <br>
<br>
Springsteen's reach back into his past established a clear definition of
 himself. Alienation from work, from others, from darkness, from 
something pervades all great rock; this theme cropped up throughout all 
the songs. "Outside Looking In" was recorded early on, a tune yelled out
 over Buddy Hollyish rolling drums; "Something in the Night" and "Don't 
Look Back" (knocked off the record so late it showed up in Phonolog 
listings) also shared this attitude. The enormous roar was often reduced
 to just a beat and a moan, but it was more than enough for the battles 
that Darkness depicted. Springsteen created a dramatic rock blues form, 
conveying hurt and, by sharing its burden, diffusing it and giving hope.
 Obsessions with the night, cars and the price one pays worked to his 
advantage. Just like blues, repetition widened its scope. <br>
<br>
When it came out in June, 1978, Darkness on the Edge of Town received a 
mixed reaction. Critics slammed it for the force of its integration of 
themes. Typical of the negative attitude towards the album were Mike 
Appel's comments in Melody Maker. He felt "personally insulted by it... 
it's as if he pandered to what he thought would be the audience's level 
of anticipation.... He hasn't gone any further than Born to Run, has 
he?" <br>
<br>
Though the critics' words stung a little, ultimately Darkness was mildly
 disappointing to Springsteen because it never communicated to its 
natural audience as deeply as it intended. A subsequent summer tour put 
the point across conclusively and totally vindicated all his musical 
ideas. <br>
<br>
The tour was monumental. Dates were constantly added, shows became 
longer and the pace got hotter. Rolling across the heartland, 
Springsteen and the E Street Band averaged three- hour shows five nights
 a week for over four months. His obligation to his audience extended to
 the famous four-hour soundcheck, in which he worked out the precise 
sound he wanted them to hear. Conceding to reality, Springsteen played 
many big halls and arenas, and his perfectionism insisted on the highest
 sound quality possible. The sound was indeed marvelous; the new, 
deliberate style stretched out perfectly onstage. <br>
<br>
Springsteen's belief in the Darkness material erased any doubts about 
playing in arenas. After some early rustiness and changes the show took 
on a basic shape: The Darkness songs appeared in the middle of the first
 set, finishing with "Racing in the Streets" which gained a more upbeat 
interpretation when it escalated into "Thunder Road." (The reason for 
this, Bruce told Philly DJ friend Ed Sciaky, was that "it's fulfilling. 
There's a stretch of songs that we do basically in the same order every 
night because... it makes connections and gives the rest of the show 
resonance.") The second set was always looser; it was if Springsteen 
said what he had to while the audience was still patient enough to 
listen. <br>
<br>
His choice of covers now hearked back to rock's earliest days, Jerry Lee
 Lewis, Eddie Cochran, Buddy Holly, even King Elvis were brought back to
 life with "Good Rockin' Tonight," "Heartbreak Hotel," "High School 
Confidential" and "Rave On," which was played full-tilt in L.A., a town 
notorious for faking Buddy Holly songs. Springsteen sometimes opened 
with "Summertime Blues" spilling into "Badlands"; by doing so, he 
embodied rock's past and present. <br>
<br>
Springsteen increasingly dedicated more of his own contributions to the 
spirit of that tradition. He performed "Fire," revived "The Fever" with a
 more muscular arrangement than the soulful studio rendering from 1973, 
and introduced two new summer tunes in old-fashioned styles. "Paradise 
by the Sea" was a fluid little instrumental with roller rink organ like 
so much early- '60s junk; "Cherie Darling" was his tribute to the 
records of the frat rockers, those great and silly discs were party 
noise ruled. The latter was based on a tempestuous relationship with an 
old girlfriend's mother: <br>
<br>
Your momma's gabbin' in the back seat Tell her to push over and move 
them big feet It's the last time that [spoken] gee, I gotta drag her 
over to the unemployment agency every Monday morning <br>
<br>
It was proof of a unique ability to write a roots song and still be true
 to his own vision. Only the Beatles could achieve the same, but their 
retrospective rockers would never have fit so easily into the era they 
emulated. <br>
<br>
While the additions to his live shows were simple and direct, some of 
the older numbers were broadened, reaching epic stature. "She's the One"
 started with either "Mona" or "Not Fade Away" hammering home the song's
 Bo Diddley beat and sometimes included a bit more - anything from 
"Gloria" to "Mickey's Monkey" to "Train Kept A'Rollin'." "Growin' Up" 
featured the elongated "direct to God" rap that ends Dave Marsh's book. <br>
<br>
"Backstreets" was the most deeply felt song, Springsteen's tormented 
vocal hitting an untoppable peak. Its middle section was part of the 
unreleased "Drive All Night," piano roaming along with the singer in his
 wandering thoughts about his girl. This trip ended like others, though:
 with a lie. As rumbling drums mirrored the rising anger of the betrayed
 lover, his repeated plea for an end to "those pretty lies" abruptly 
halted, and once more they went "hidin' on them backstreets tonight." <br>
<br>
After that painful journey, "Rosalita" burst forth, shattering in its 
power. Halfway through the tour a bass upswing plucked from Otis 
Redding's "I Can't Turn You Loose" became the foundation for an even 
greater extension of the crowd favorite. It set standards for balcony- 
shaking and roof-raising that may never be surpassed. <br>
<br>
The real suprise of the show, though, was "Prove It All Night." On 
record the song was simple and a little flat, but expanded in 
performance it became pure triumph. A rolling, squeaking guitar 
reminiscent of Neil Young's Zuma-era playing joined a lilting 
bass/drums/piano beat. The instruments rose up to reach the body of the 
song, made more dramatic by the guitar's expansiveness. As final shouts 
of "prove it all night" rebounded between Springsteen and his band, 
Danny Federici increased the tension with a stirring solo. Finally the 
guitar returned, dripping power chords as it reached apocalyptic fervor.
 Pete Townshend once described "Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere" as the sounds 
of war, chaos and frustration expressed musically; Springsteen's battle 
for inner space was fought out on the same turf. Morse-code piano 
tapping at the break relayed the message that Bruce Springsteen had 
broken through, that he could prove it all night. If the audience 
ascended with him, one helping the other in the liberating tradition of 
rock'n' roll, the night would end with "Twist and Shout," the first song
 Springsteen ever learned to play on the guitar. The circle was 
complete. <br>
<br>
Springsteen has maintained a low profile since then. 
Nineteen-seventy-eight ended with slightly anticlimactic tour of 
colleges and secondary markets. Only one new song worked its way in: 
"The Ties That Bind," a heavy favorite at one time to be the title for 
the upcoming album. Tapes to a red hot August show in Cleveland's Agora 
were mixed in the studio for possible use as a live record, an idea 
later scrapped. So Springsteen headed into New York's Power Station for 
his spring and summer vacations. <br>
<br>
As plans for a summertime release of "Cherie Darling"/Paradise by the 
Sea" fell by boards, Springsteen's only public work was at the MUSE 
shows in September at Madison Square Garden. He introduced "The River" 
there; along with "Thunder Road" and perennial encore "Quater to Three,"
 it can be seen in the recent No Nukes film. A tour pending completion 
of the LP was booked solid for late fall and early winter, but had to be
 canceled as his indecision grew. In mid-April he took off to LA to mix 
the record; at press time he was still plugging away at it. <br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen's history has shown that his greatest talent, a rock 
intuition second to none, is often at odds with a relentless sense of 
perfection. After Darkness he told a Boston newspaper that he was past 
the obsessively self-critical stage: "No more, hey, is this perfect? 
Just let me do it." Yet the time spent making his fifth record proves 
that idea wrong. <br>
<br>
All of rock's greats reach a point where they spend more time off the 
road than on, entrenched in the recording studio. Self-indulgent 
staleness sets in when live work is not interspersed meaningfully, 
enabling the artist to test out material live. Creating rock and then 
palying it to an audience has proven to be dangerous to creativity and 
communication. <br>
<br>
If anyone can beat this seemingly inevitable flatness and loss of 
energy, it is Springsteen. His vision and continuing feel for his past 
have kept him one step ahead of fans, many of whom would want to make 
him an Elvis for the '80s, and critics, who cannot keep pace with his 
ability to change. A return to alternating studio and stage chores would
 definitely eliminate any chance that his art might decline; as it 
stands, his past seems a good guarantee that he'll play a continuing 
role in any "rock and roll future."</div>

The Aquarian , 1978<br>
By Mike Greenblatt<br>
<br>
We've been sitting on a bench facing the ocean near the Casino Arena in 
Asbury Park. It's 45 minutes past our appointed meeting time with Bruce 
Springsteen and we're trying to light matches in the wind. It's past 
1:30 now and we're wondering if he's going to show up. Hell, it's a 
beautiful sunny fall day, one of his very few days off from a grueling 
whirlwind tour of the country. And it's his birthday to boot. Maybe he 
just ain't gonna show. <br>
<br>
But we're determined. We're prepared to wait for two more hours. Then, 
if he's still not here, we'll split. We've already tired of scrutinizing
 all the faces for something that will tell us it's him in disguise. We 
forgot our quest and go back to the matches. <br>
<br>
"Hi", he says as he walks right up at us. "Sorry I'm late, I just got 
up." He's dressed in a blueish work-shirt and jeans. He has ever-present
 sunglasses on. We decide to break the ice over lunch. <br>
<br>
Settling into a booth at the Convention Hall Coffee Shop, I order a BLT,
 photographer Sorce a cheeseburger, and Bruce a hamburger, french fries 
and coke. <br>
<br>
"Yeah, we had a real rep", Bruce starts to say. "We could draw two, 
maybe three thousand people on any given night. We played our own 
concerts here and also down south. It's weird. Nobody would ever book us
 because we never did any Top-40. Never. We used to play all old soul 
stuff. Chuck Berry, just the thing we liked. That's why we couldn't get 
booked. We made enough to eat though." <br>
<br>
The waitresses are starting to mill about the table so Bruce puts his 
shades back on and hushes up his tone. "The other night was amazing", he
 wispers. "I went to see Animal house, and when I came out of the 
theater there was a whole bunch of people that started following me to 
the parking lot. I wound up signing autographs for over an hour." <br>
<br>
"Anyway, after a while the kicks started to wear off and a lot of the 
time we didn't make enough to eat. That's why i signed with Mike 
(Appel). Anything was better than what was happening at the time." <br>
<br>
Little did the local rocker know that this early signing with Mike Appel
 would result in the latter claiming rights to the early material 
Springsteen had written. The rest of the courtroom drama is famous. 
Perhaps generously, Bruce had nothing bad to say about his former 
manager. <br>
<br>
"He did a lot of good for me at that time", he says, dipping one 
particularly long french fry into a mound of ketchup. "He introduced me 
to John Hammond (CBS bigwig responsible for signing Dylan, Aretha 
Franklin, Billie Holiday, Bessie Smith and others). He helped me on that
 first album". He pauses as if he were ruminating on something. "I 
haven't seen him since that day." <br>
<br>
"Actually, I was pretty shielded from the whole thing", he continues. 
"Mike put the onus on Jon (Landau), claiming he was the culprit." <br>
<br>
I ask: You mean he charged Landau with stealing you away from him? <br>
<br>
"Yeah, sort of. I was never good at the business end of things." <br>
<br>
Asked about the famous line Landau wrote for his Real Paper review ("I 
saw rock and roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen"), Bruce 
says, "That line is misrepresentative of the whole review. It's funny. 
The review was nothing like that one line. It got taken out of context" -
 another myth shattered. <br>
<br>
"I remember playing in a club where an earlier review that Jon wrote was
 splashed all over the outside wall. I was leaning against the wall, 
smoking a cigarette, when Jon practically bumped right into me. I had 
never met him. We hit it off right away." <br>
<br>
"When asked if he ever gave up during the long months of inactivity, 
Bruce still remains bright, completely devoid of bitterness. " I knew 
that it was just a matter of time. We were playing almost throughout 
that whole episode even though we weren't supposed to. I mean, what kind
 of law is it that is written specifically to stop a man from doing what
 he does to make his money?" <br>
<br>
"The only real frustrating thing which did cause me grief was the fact 
that my songs weren't my own. I didn't own my own songs. That hurt." <br>
<br>
But that makes it all the more satisfying now. At Nassau Coliseum, 
thousands of kids screaming their guts out for him before he even played
 a song. They didn't let up until he finished, drained and exhausted. At
 the Capitol Theatre, two nights before, he was surprised onstage by a 
giant birthday cake out of which a scantily clad girl bounced. He swears
 he didn't know a thing about it ("I even told John Scher no cakes"). At
 Madison square Garden, 18,000 fans leand on every note as if it were 
the last they would ever hear. A gala party was held for him in the 
plush Penn Plaza Club located deep inside the bowels of the Garden. 
Security was the tightest I'd ever witnessed. <br>
<br>
We paid for the food and split for the beach. The conversation continued
 amid the sea, the wind and the hovering presence of the Casino Arena. <br>
<br>
"I'm into a little photography myself", Bruce says as Sorce adjusts his 
light meter. "I took some pictures of Lynnie (Lynn goldsmith, 
photographer) that were published somewhere." <br>
<br>
When asked about his other interests, Bruce talks of softball. "Yeah, we
 used to play hard. we had to stop, though, when Clarence and myself 
used to get too battered up. We'd go on stage all wracked up and it 
would hurt. After a while, it got too important and too many people were
 into it. There's no softball on this tour. What else do I like? Hmmm, 
I'll tell ya...not too much besides music. Right now, music is it. I 
don't care about anything else." <br>
<br>
We get back to talking of copy bands and the difference between making 
it with your own material and making good money playing copies. I tell 
Bruce I had to play "Shake Your Booty" to get booked anywhere. <br>
<br>
"Shake Your Booty?" laughs Bruce, falling into the sand. "That's a great
 song. KC, man, he's great! He always comes out with those repetitive 
things. Over and over and over, that kind of stuff is great! It's like 
the 'Louie, Louie' of today." <br>
<br>
Later on, in talking about what is written about him, he says, "I have 
Glen (Glen Brunman, CBS publicist) mail me everything that's written 
about me. Hundreds of things, man. I read them all at once. That way I 
can get a pretty good perspective on what my press is like, rather than 
reading one thing at a time." <br>
<br>
"Near the end of Darkness, I wasn't doing any interviews", Bruce 
continues. "Then I did them until I noticed myself saying the same 
things to different people. There's only one answer to each question; 
you don't want to lie to these people. I really had myself in a spin. 
And each interview was a multiple interview situation with two or three 
people at once. I guess the problem was that I did too many of 'em." 
Walking off the beach, we talk of the Garden shows and his stretcher 
routine, whereby he sings himself silly until he has to be taken off the
 stage in a stretcher, only to break free and grab the microphone again 
until he's forcibly restrained from the stage. <br>
<br>
That's a great routine. Where'd you get that from? I ask. I know that 
professional wrestling has a stretcher routine where the good guy gets 
beat so bad they have to carry him off in a stretcher and the bad guy 
always kicks him off of it as it passes by. It's classic. <br>
<br>
"No", answers Bruce, "I didn't even know about that. We got it from 
James Brown. He used to get himself so worked up that the bassist led 
him offstage wrapped in a cape. He'd throw the cape off his shoulders 
and come running back to the mikestand some two or three times. It drove
 'em wild. So that's where we got the idea for the stretcher routine." <br>
<br>
Sliding into the front seat of a borrowed '78 burnt yellow Camaro, Bruce
 at the wheel, we're on our way to the neighborhood where he grew up in 
Freehold. Shoving a cassette into the receptable, he says, "A fan gave 
this to me outside a concert once. it's real good tape." <br>
<br>
He turns up the volume, guns the motor and shifts into second. We take 
off. He turns up the volume a little more and starts looking for "Hello 
Mary Lou" by Rick Nelson. "This song has one of the greatest guitar 
parts ever on it." <br>
<br>
He can't find the tune and settles for oldies like "If You Wanna Be 
Happy For the Rest of Your Life (Never Make a Pretty Woman your Wife)" 
and "Blue Suede Shoes". He shifts into third. <br>
<br>
Now for the first time, we do not talk. The music is loud and damn 
appealing. The windows are down so the wind is whipping furiously into 
the car. He shifts into fourth and takes off. <br>
<br>
We're rolling now. We settle uncomfortably behind a slow driver. He 
checks his rear-view mirror and roars past the driver. Seeing another 
slow-mover right ahead, he stays in the opposite lane and passes two in 
one fell swoop before settling comfortably back on the right. From the 
back, Sorce lets out a soft "Whew!" <br>
<br>
It's great moment. Chuck Berry is wailing out with "Maybelline". Bruce 
is going faster. It's such a fuckin' beautiful day. The wind is rushing 
in and Bruce is feeling good, snapping his fingers, clapping his hands 
and letting out with a hoarse vocal or two on the last line of each 
verse. "Hello Mary Lou" finally comes on and suddenly everything is 
crystallized in one magic moment - the speed, the music, the sun, the 
wind, the company. Jeezez Christ! We're rolling down the highway with 
fuckin' Bruce Springsteen at the wheel! And he's driving the way you 
would think Bruce Springsteen would drive. <br>
<br>
Later, when we reach a light, Bruce impatiently waits on it before 
saying, "This is what we used to call a 'quarterback sneak'"", and with 
that he takes off surreptitiously past the red light. <br>
<br>
We're in the old neighborhood now. Bruce drives slowly down Institute 
Street until he reaches the right number. It's been painted now. "I 
lived here all through grammar school. There's a Nestle's factory near 
here. Man, when it rained we smelled that stuff all day long." <br>
<br>
The elder Springsteen would go to work in the morning, come home, go to 
sleep and wake up and go back to work at the factory. "I guess there was
 other things he wanted," Bruce reflects. <br>
<br>
We get back into the car and drive over to the factory. "Both my 
grandfather and my father worked here. It used to be a rug mill in the 
old days, but for some reason it ran out of business fairly quick. I was
 pretty young at the time." <br>
<br>
When I ask about high school, Bruce clams up. "It wasn't exactly the 
best time of my life because I didn't graduate with any of the others. 
It was a rough period." I could see he really doesn't pursue this avenue
 too long so I drop it. But I wonder what mystery is veiled beneath this
 wall of secrecy. <br>
<br>
We get back into the car and tear out of there. Ironically enough, the 
tape Bruce shoves into the machine this time is an old Animals cassette.
 The first song could be a forerunner to much of the music Bruce writes.
 As the opening line comes out of the speakers, the dusty factory is 
just fading from view..."In this dirty old part of the city/Where the 
sun refuses to shine/People say that there ain't no use in trying/My 
little girl you're so young and pretty/And one thing I know is 
true/You'll be dead before your time is due, yes you will/See my daddy 
in bed ad night/See his hair a' turnin' grey/He's been working and 
slaving his life away, yes he has. The song is, of cours, "We Gotta Get 
Out of This Place", and it was a fitting omen as we drove off. <br>
<br>
As we drove, Bruce starts reminiscing. "Yeah, I lived in practically 
every single town around here, from Atlantic Highlands to Bradley Beach.
 We used to move quite often. <br>
<br>
"That's where I had my very first gig," he laughs as we pass a mobile 
setup. Looking out of the window, the 10 or 20 mobile homes facing us 
look worn and old. "The gig wasn't bad...for our first job." <br>
<br>
Hey Bruce, are you gonna show up at the Capitol again like you did last 
year on New Year's Eve? I ask him. It was announced earlier in the week 
that Southside Johnny &amp; the Asbury Jukes would again party away the 
year in such grand fashion. Bruce turns around and answers, "I don't 
know where I'm gonna be on New Year's Eve. <br>
<br>
"C'mon, I'll show you where my surfin' buddies used to live," he says, 
changing the subject. We swerve sharply off the highway onto an exit. 
"This used to be a surfboard factory," he says. We step out of the car 
near a small white building. <br>
<br>
"Yeah, me and a fella named Tinker lived here for a year and a half, in 
one room. All the rest of this area used to be nothin' but sand dunes." 
He points to a huge expanse of stores, houses and construction. "None of
 this was here." <br>
<br>
"They used to make the surfboards downstairs. Tinker and I, we had a 
ball. Just one room! Two beds, a fridge and a TV - the rest of the room 
was filled with surfboards." <br>
<br>
"Since I was from Freehold, I was considered inland. All these guys used
 to surf every day. I was friends with 'em all but never went. Finally, 
they got to me. One afternoon they were merciless. They just kept 
taunting me and kidding me about not surfing that it just sorta got me 
riled. I grabbed a board and we all headed out to the beach. <br>
<br>
"I must have been some sight surfing for the first time, but I'll tell 
you something - I got the hang of it pretty quick. Hell, it ain't harder
 than anything else. It's like riding a bike. I haven't surfed in 
awhile. Now that's something I'd love to do. As a matter of fact, I 
think I will." <br>
<br>
He seems resolute. <br>
<br>
He continues: "This guy Jesse taught me the finer points of surfing. We 
used to stay in North End Beach in Long Branch all the time. Some guy 
owned the beach so we had the use of it for almost two whole years. We'd
 be there every day. We'd stay on the beach, go in the water. It was 
great. <br>
<br>
"This area is really amazing. There's really poor neighborhoods and then
 there's real nice neighborhoods all in a five-mile radius. <br>
<br>
"I used to go to New York a lot back then. I played at the Cafe Wha? a 
lot in '68. I used to play there with Jerry Walker's old group, Circus 
Maximus. Let's see, I played the Night Owl (all these places were in the
 West Village). They had a lot of good bands there at the time - the 
Raves, Robin &amp; the Hoods. Let's see, the Mothers of Invention were 
playing all the time in that area and so were the Fugs. <br>
<br>
"I didn't go to too many concerts then. I much preferred playing and 
jamming with these people. There was a whole 'nother scene taking place 
over in the East Village that I wasn't part of at all - the Fillmore, 
the Electric Circus. I think my first experience seeing a rock star was 
going to Steve Paul's Scene and seeing Johnny Winter. That was really 
something. I remember between sets, he came out and sat at the very next
 table from me and my friends." <br>
<br>
Let's go back to Asbury, I suggest. <br>
<br>
Asking Bruce if he'd take me back to the old Upstage site where he held 
court almost every night, he gladly obliges and we get out of the car 
again in what could be termed downtown Asbury. <br>
<br>
"I gotta be cool," Bruce chuckles. "I ran out of here without paying the rent." <br>
<br>
We walk over to the site, which is upstairs from a shoe store. <br>
<br>
"I lived here while Greetings From Asbury Park was being made. I slept 
in my sleeping bag on my friend's floor for a good portion of that 
album." <br>
<br>
Bruce poses for pics while people pass by right and left. Surprisingly 
enough, nobody recognizes him (or if they do, they keep on walking). <br>
<br>
"I'm lucky in that respect. What happened in the movies the other night 
is a rarity. Usually, I don't get recognized. I don't have that 
instantly recognizable feature that a lot of other people have." <br>
<br>
Yeah, like Frampton's hair, I reply. <br>
<br>
"My folks had already moved to California," Bruce remembers, "and I was out of high school by the time I got to Asbury. <br>
<br>
"Asbury was a great place for us to play. We played here an awful lot." <br>
<br>
In answering questions about his immidiate future, Bruce says, "I have 
one more day off before we finish the tour. Then I have a whole month 
off before we start up again. In February we go back into the studio for
 work on the next album. I'm hoping it will be out by next summer." <br>
<br>
Just for the record, the tour ended officially in Atlanta on Oct. 1. It 
started in Buffalo on May 23. The new tour starts (possibly in New 
Jersey) on Nov. 1 and finishes by Dec. 20. If the time it took to cut 
Darkness is any indicator, then number five will be lucky to hit the 
stands by the summer after next. <br>
<br>
The just-finished tour took in 70 cities and 86 shows in four months and
 eight days. That's why Bruce has to be listed as a "great guy" to do up
 an afternoon on one of his rare days off. Another highly impressive 
thing is that he spent the whole day without the protective cradle of a 
publicist's presence. Rarely have I done an interview without the 
artist's publicist in tow. <br>
<br>
In talking about the current LP, Bruce says, "The guy who took the cover
 shot for that album is a friend of mine from south Jersey who works 
fulltime in a meat market. The shots were taken at his house. He's a 
great photographer."<br>
<br>
Bruce's only comment about the self-destructive syndrome 
(dope-money-power) affecting so many rock stars is that "they let all 
the other things become more important than playing. Playing is the 
important thing. Once you forget that, you've had it." <br>
<br>
Bruce, obviously, hasn't forgotten that. He's been having fun with music
 since the start. Bruce Springsteen is the perfect assimilator of many 
styles - Chuck Berry/Stones/Elvis/Buddy Holly/ Dylan/Little 
Richard/Animals. His image on stage is also an amalgamation of many 
images - Elvis/young Brando/James Dean. Somehow he melds all of these 
influences into one cohesive framework for his own strikingly original 
material. The man is all that he has devoured musically from the time he
 started listening to music, and it all pours out of hime every time he 
steps on stage. "That Elvis, man," Bruce says, "he is all there is. 
There ain't no more. Everything starts and ends with him. He wrote the 
book. He is everything to do and not to do in the business."<br>
<br>
If Elvis Presley is Bruce's prototype then Bruce, himself, is the focus 
for a lot of envy and speculation. We all have fantasies - Bruce 
included - of making it big and living as stars. Well, Bruce is living 
the ultimate realization of that fantasy right now. He's made it through
 all the bullshit inherent in such a proposition. He's doing it. And 
doing it in style. <br>
<br>
Yet if you talk to him, he's quite humble. Ask him what part he played 
in the writing of "Because the Night" and he'll tell you that he only 
wrothe the title line (although he admits he will probably put it on his
 next album.) <br>
<br>
Seeing him so close up and listening to him speak makes one realize 
that, although not articulate, there is a certain aura about him. A 
certain intangible. His charisma is the well-worn persona of the working
 man. His handsome/beautiful face could even make the transition to the 
silver screen as a prophet of the proletariat. His facial features are 
tough, yet there's a certain hardness to him. You'd swear he's Italian 
before you're told of his Dutch descent. <br>
<br>
His enthusiasm is real. The moment when Gary U.S. Bonds came over the 
car speakers with "Quarter to Three" - that's when Bruce really started 
to groove. The song is in his encores in most of his performances. He 
still loves the original and still sings along with it when it comes on.

The essence of rock and roll can be distilled into a performance that a 
fella by the name of Bobby Lewis did on American Bandstand many years 
ago. Lewis performed "Tossin' and Turnin'" on the show, lip-synched it, 
and drove the small television studio crazy with his slips and slides. 
Host Dick Clark did a never-before-done-thing - he, in his madness of 
the moment, screamed for Lewis to perform the same song again. The sound
 man cued it up and Lewis went back out onto the stage and really tore 
into it this time, twisting, turning, giving it all he had. By now his 
lip motions were completely out-of-synch with the record being played, 
but it didn't matter. It was a piece of rock and roll heaven. And one, 
I'm sure, Bruce Springsteen would have enjoyed.<br>

Have you been able to come across a concert review written for the 
Village Voice by Greg "Ironman" Tate around, I'm guessing, the late 80s?</div>

It is quickly apparent why Bruce Springsteen, who performed at Shady 
Grove Music Fair, Gaithersburg, last night, is soon going to be a name 
to reckon with.<br>
<br>
Springsteenâ€™s not just a desperately vivid lyricist, or an ace 
guitarist. He turns into a Marlon Brando rock performer on the stage in 
his black leather jacket, raggedly red shirt and jeans, clutching his 
fists, flailing his arms and stomping around the stage like a method 
actor psyching his lines out of himself.<br>
<br>
The lines themselves are of frantic city images, street punks and 
whores, Romeo and Juliet in West Side Story setting, pimps in white 
Eldorados and gypsy fortune tellers gone mad.<br>
<br>
The obvious comparison is Bob Dylan, whose earlier material was steeped 
in a similar tone of black leather desperation. But Dylan was primarily a
 lyricist and Springsteen is a performer, dredging up the characters of 
his songs on stage, playing at his fantasies to the orchestration of a 
tight, urban blues band that wails out with tenor saxophone and thumping
 bass and the kind of spider web cascade of piano and organ that 
surrounds his switchable images with the eery, tense feeling of hoods 
hiding from the cops in a church.<br>
<br>
Springsteen seems to be fulfilling the style Van Morrison has been 
defining for years now, theatrical music thatâ€™s intrinsically connected 
with the mood of the imagery. While Morrison sings of love of the 
cosmos, Springsteen is out in the street â€” maybe being there has given 
him the kind of stage stamina Morrison has always lacked.</div>
