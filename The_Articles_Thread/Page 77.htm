<br>
Don Snowden, Pasadena Guardian,<br>
<br>
 September 24, 1975</strong><br>
<br>
HE STARTED HIS career as a solo performer and fronting New Jersey bar bands like the Steel Mill and Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom.<br>
<br>
Signed to Columbia by John Hammond in 1972, his first album Greetings 
From Asbury Park, N. J. sent critics scurrying for superlatives; he was 
hailed as another new Dylan for his physical appearance, off-the-wall 
lyrics and imposing array of colorfully-named street characters. The 
chorus of acclaim grew to a roar with the release of The Wild, The 
Innocent And the E Street Shuffle, a 1974 Rolling Stone Record of the 
year; comments placing the future of rock’n’roll on his shoulders began 
to appear and Jon Landau quit his job at Rolling Stone to help produce 
Born to Run.<br>
<br>
He took the E street Band to the alien turf of Texas to play his brand 
of R&amp;B-flavored punk rock drawn from the streets of Jersey and the 
sidewalks of New York to an audience unfamiliar with his work – and 
received a standing ovation after the song. At Carnegie Hall he closed a
 song with the line "Uptown in Harlem she throws a rose to some lucky 
young matador" – and as the last notes faded away, a young girl in the 
audience silently stood up and threw a single red rose past his ear.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is a 25-year old romantic whose feet are firmly 
cemented in urban concrete, whose heart and mind are directly attuned to
 the hopes and fears of the young American male. An adventurous spirit 
musically, his albums range from the acoustic-dominated Asbury to the 
Latin-tinged electric eclecticism of E Street and the arranged precision
 of the new album. Born to Run is a virtual primer on the music of the 
mid-‘60s filtered through the experiences of the ‘70s. Springsteen has 
been ably abetted throughout by the potent E Street Band, a unit who may
 well be everything you always wanted in a rock band but were afraid to 
ask for.<br>
<br>
The power and versatility of the band perfectly complements 
Springsteen’s throaty singing. He is a vocal actor, utilizing techniques
 ranging from a hoarse stage whisper to soulful falsetto whoops to 
maximize the dramatic impact of his songs. The key to his vocal 
effectiveness is his sense of timing, an instinctive grasp of what to do
 when and for how long.<br>
<br>
When his vocal delivery and lyrics mesh, Springsteen is capable of 
creating a compelling persona through vivid imagery drawn from a myriad 
of sources. Springsteen’s lyrics are drawn from the classic themes or 
rock’n’roll – young love, cars, the celebration of youth and the strains
 of growing up, the dream of hitting it big – but with a rare 
combination of intelligence and emotional intensity. His songs, highly 
romanticized depictions of nighttime street life – often cinematic in 
their scope and attention to detail – are populated by people like the 
Magic Rat, Crazy Janey, Spanish Johnny, and Sloppy Sue and Big Balls 
Billy.<br>
<br>
The emotions are extreme, undercut by the desperation and impatience of 
youth and sobering sense of mortality and dashed hopes. He wants to know
 if life is real, to place his faith in the magical spirits of the night
 and find one of his dreams, to die on the streets in an everlasting 
kiss, to run from the stifling atmosphere of his town. The women in 
Springsteen’s life can have hearts of gold (‘The E Street Shuffle’ and 
‘Incident on 57th Street’) or stone (‘She’s The One’); many of his 
greatest songs are those where he must persuade a reluctant woman to 
come with him by painting a vision of excitement and romance in the 
night (‘Rosalita’, ‘Thunder Road’ and ‘Born to Run’).<br>
<br>
Throughout his writing, characters must share the spotlight with 
hemi-powered drones – Springsteen’s obsession with cars rivals those of 
Chuck Berry and the hot-rodding Beach Boys. Automotive imagery abounds; 
cars are vehicles of release from the confining drudgery of the 
nine-to-five world, from the suicide-trap towns full of losers.<br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen is just a prisoner of his dreams, honest and aware 
enough to accurately depict the dilemmas facing someone growing up in 
these times, sensitive enough to capture their emotional quandaries in 
attempting to deal with them. He is the embodiment of the rock 
traditions of the late ‘50s and early mid-‘60s – his genius lies in his 
ability to synthesize those familiar elements into a compelling. It 
works because Springsteen has lived and sings of experiences and 
fantasies common to all: joining the circus, hanging out in amusement 
parks and pinball arcades, cruising in the summer looking for love, 
skipping school and acting cool, staying out all night. The effect is 
galvanizing on vinyl; live, with the E Street Band playing like a jungle
 fire behind him, Springsteen’s impact is riveting. If rock’n’roll has 
ever struck a responsive chord in your soul, this man will affect you.<br>
<br>
He’ll be at the Roxy Oct. 16-19 – don’t expect the tickets to last long once they go on sale.<br>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN AT CROKE PARK DUBLIN<br>
MAY 27 2016<br>
RTE TEN</strong><br>
<br>
Talk about perfect timing... At the end of the month that celebrates age
 and creativity in Ireland we get a visit from the 66-year-old who 
proves that our fretting about the numbers is the biggest racket of them
 all. On Friday, Bruce Springsteen made sure that the eyewitness 
testimony from Croke Park was exactly the same as at every other date on
 this tour: another decade of three-hours-and-then-some shows looks well
 in the tank. Right from the opening double whammy of Darkness on the 
Edge of Town and Badlands it really felt like you'd done the dirt on him
 by opting for a seat, and the longer this gig went on the less you 
needed one. It's usually the other way 'round. <br>
<br>
That said, even the greatest have their work cut out with daylight 
starts in stadiums and, sure enough, twenty past seven felt like 40 
minutes too early to be seeing anyone bar the roadies onstage. But once 
the setlist went into double digits, the drama and devotion - and the 
dread of that 11 o'clock curfew - cranked all the way up. Hungry Heart 
was the right song at exactly the right time. Everything else that 
followed felt the same.<br>
<br>
The River equalled the chills it gave so many on MT USA all those years 
ago; The Promised Land was, at last, in the most fitting of Irish venues
 and Waitin' on a Sunny Day included the sweetest of singalongs - and 
selfies - with a kid from the crowd who made everyone feel at least 
another 10 years younger<br>
<br>
The very grown-up Tougher than the Rest and Because the Night 
immediately followed and were just as spine-tingling among 80,000 as 
they are when experienced with just one other - or alone. <br>
<br>
The first encore was beautifully bookended by Jungleland and Bobby Jean 
with Born to Run, Dancing in the Dark, Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out and a 
cover of the Isley Brothers' Shout in between. The spectacle of seeing 
almost the whole place dancing and pogo-ing to Shout was equal to 
anything served up on Jones Road on Sundays in September.<br>
<br>
As the E Street Band trooped off, the man himself stayed for a pin-drop 
solo performance of This Hard Land - that line about staying hungry as 
much his secret as the message to take home. With the final chords came 
the realisation that, really, it's only half time and after a Saturday 
to recharge the batteries he and the crowd are in for some Sunday 
showdown. The 11pm cut-off will be well and truly tested</div>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Bruce Springsteen in Manchester<br>
The Observer<br>
May 29 2016</strong><br>
<br>
Bruce Springsteen has his eyes screwed shut. His fists, bound in 
wristbands, are clenched. Veins are popping in his temples, but not from
 the happy exertion of a song such as Glory Days, or the even more 
cardiovascular Born to Run, both of which light up the tail end of 
tonight’s set. He is stock-still, singing almost privately as much as to
 the 55,000 fans enduring the unrelenting Mancunian drizzle on a cold 
May evening.<br>
<br>
This is The River, the title track of his 1980 double album – his first 
US No 1, ushering in a decade of superstardom – and it is one of 
Springsteen’s finer songs, bearing witness to ordinary people’s 
travails. Young love goes wrong, foundering on the rocks of 
responsibility and hardening times. Dreams are remembered with yearning,
 as a man surveys the dried-up river where love and youth first 
flourished.<br>
<br>
An extra frisson comes from the biographical roots of the song, in 
Springsteen’s own sister’s marriage. In falsetto, Springsteen croons a 
long, ghostly “ooh”-ed lament, taken up at the end by his harmonica. The
 E Street Band, eight-strong tonight, shorn of the choirs and horns of 
more recent tours, are dialled down, as twinkly as they can be in the 
debased sonics of a stadium.<br>
<br>
A man with a squeegee wipes moisture off the platforms at the lip of the crowd so Bruce can commune with his people<br>
The next song is even more bleak. On the piano-led but angry Point 
Blank, Springsteen watches as a girl falls into a squalid trap of a 
life, beyond the help of his narrator. The forces of perdition have got 
his love right where they want her: “Bang, bang, you’re dead.”<br>
<br>
These two songs remain hard to listen to, never mind hard to play in a 
stadium, where the dynamics are more suited to blowing off steam after 
work than having your nose rubbed in life’s vicissitudes. They form the 
hard emotional core of a three-hour set where lighter forces do come out
 to play and Jake Clemons’s bright sax solos are mustered as another 
defence against the elements. A man with a Manchester City blue squeegee
 wipes moisture off the little platforms at the lip of the crowd so that
 Springsteen – often followed by guitar foil Steven Van Zandt, Clemons, 
guitarist Nils Lofgren and fiddling fourth guitarist Soozie Tyrell – can
 come down and commune with his people.<br>
<br>
The River was a pivotal album that kept expanding, to accommodate, as 
Springsteen has noted, “fun, dancing, laughter, jokes, politics, good 
comradeship, love, faith, lonely nights and, of course, tears”. It was 
released as a double; still, reams of songs were abandoned. 
Significantly, this was where the young turk turned his attention to 
“the ties that bind”, examining lasting love, duress and community – all
 the things that the live-fast-die-young, treat ’em mean types that 
populate the genre usually run from.<br>
<br>
Last year, The Ties That Bind: The River Collection box set finally 
compiled many of these cold store River-era songs. With a solo album in 
the can, and an autobiography ready to roll (due in September), 
Springsteen agreed to a few low-key dates to promote the box – 
laughably, given the sizable merry-go-round this tour has become.<br>
<br>
The set list has loosened over time, with River-era songs fleshed out by
 the catalogue, so that no fan could ever go home feeling cheated of the
 Springsteen they most love: the rabble-rousing bard, the troubled 
lover, the ordinary guy. Tonight’s set features 32 long songs performed 
lustily, with the bonhomie that comes as standard when the E Street Band
 roll in.<br>
<br>
The encore is, as ever, designed to send the crowd home a little higher on oxytocin than they arrived<br>
Things can get corny. A man dressed as Father Christmas waggles a 
placard and is ushered on stage as the band launch effortlessly into 
Santa Claus Is Coming to Town. On the US leg, cover versions have marked
 the passing of David Bowie, Glenn Frey and Prince, but a dearth of rock
 star deaths means we get the set staple Twist and Shout. Crowd requests
 are accommodated with gusto. Among others, we get Darkness on the Edge 
of Town, another vein-popper.<br>
<br>
Tonight, there are two Courteney Coxes – the actress first spotted on 
screen dancing with the Boss in the video for Dancing in the Dark. One 
is a school-age placard bearer called Issy, delivered up to sing along 
on the never more appropriate Waiting on a Sunny Day. For Dancing in the
 Dark itself, a woman dressed like one of Bananarama circa 1983 places 
her necklace around Springsteen’s neck. For those paying close 
attention, The River’s deep cuts are satisfying; a mix of strutting 
bravado (Out in the Street) and romance. I Wanna Marry You is, says 
Springsteen, “a daydream of a love song”.<br>
<br>
Adele recently dubbed Springsteen “a gentleman” for lending her his 
jacket at his recent gig in Lisbon. I Wanna Marry You finds his gallant 
protagonist in love with a girl already pushing a buggy, marvelling at 
how hard her life must be, undeterred in his affections. Springsteen 
bears witness, with maracas, then he uplifts. The encore is, as ever, 
designed to send the crowd home a little higher on oxytocin than they 
arrived. “Are the Manchesterians with me?” hollers Springsteen at the 
climax. Even as he shouts it, he is grinning, pretty sure it’s a 
malaprop.<br>
<br>
He does come back at the very, very end for a solo version of This Hard 
Land. It resonates with me, given the tents erected by the homeless 
opposite the hotel where later I am fortunate enough to sleep.</div>

The Irish Independent<br>
May 27, 2016</strong><br>
<br>

He came, he saw, he rocked. And then he rocked some more. Bruce 
Springsteen concerts are always epic but as the 66-year-old icon took to
 the Croke Park stage under balmy early summer skies it was clear we 
were about to witness something extra special.<br>
<br>
Tanned, faintly goateed, face seamed with the lines of a lifetime taking
 the road less traveled, Springsteen looked like a man with something to
 prove – extraordinary for an artist supposedly staring into the 
twilight of his career.<br>
<br>
"Come on Dublin let's hear some noise y'all," he proclaimed, as he 
negotiated the stage with the strut of a young gun rolling into town and
 eager to make his name. "Let's get a Guinness party going." (He would 
subsequently thank the President for turning out to see him).<br>
<br>
The welcome Springsteen and his E Street Band received as he kicked off 
with Darkness On The Edge Of Town was every bit as full-throated as the 
performance. When the ensemble plunged into second number Badlands those
 not already on their feet were springing from their seats. In the 
stands, fans pinched themselves and clutched their phones – as if merely
 being in the presence in Springsteen presented the mother of all selfie
 opportunities.<br>
Fans cheer on Bruce Springsteen on stage during The River Tour at Croke Park.<br>
<br>
So it had been all day as the atmosphere built and built around Croke 
Park. Springsteen devotees are not necessarily the most demonstrative as
 they go about their business and were easily distinguishable from the 
Ole Ole chanters headed across town to see the Republic of Ireland at 
the Aviva Stadium.<br>
<br>
Still, the excitement was palpable as evening descended. Concert- goers 
had been warned to show up in good time and had held their part of the 
bargain, with Croker packed to the good -natured brim as Springsteen led
 his troupe from the wings, a tricolour and stars and Stripes fluttering
 in the rigging (in the event he didn't arrive until 30 minutes after 
the billed 7pm).<br>
<br>
The gig was the latest date on Springsteen's River tour. For the first 
time the New Jersey bard is on the road without a new record to promote.
 Instead he hopes to train a spotlight on what he has long believed his 
most underrated LP, 1980's The River.<br>
<br>
Released at a difficult phase in his career, when he was creatively and 
personally adrift and grasping of a new direction, the album is best 
known for its keening title track – that rumination on financial and 
mental ruin that will speak to Irish people coming out of recession as 
surely as it did to the unemployed Rust Belt workers to whom it was 
originally dedicated. When he delivered it at Croke Park the tingles 
were palpable, 80,000 raising their voices to sing the devastating 
lyrics.<br>
<br>

Yet as Springsteen reminded us through an enthralling, 
pedal-to-the-floor set, this was a collection loaded with surprises too.
 He swerved from the confessional charge of The Ties That Bind to the 
sad lilt of Hungry Heart, his everyman ardor never dimming. It was as if
 he had penned these songs just yesterday and was showing them to the 
world for the first time. These were his babies and he loved them all 
equally.<br>
<br>
There was time for a request, as well, a hard-punching take on torch 
song Roulette that reminded us that Springsteen can croon as 
impressively as he could belt a note into the higher echelons of the 
Hogan Stand. Later, sprinkled in sweat, he led the house through a 
singalong version of Patti Smith's Because the Night, beaming as he 
played off with saxophone player Jake Clemons and rousingly negotiated 
The Rising, perhaps the outstanding moment from the later phase of his 
career. The never-ending encore, meanwhile, featured freewheeling anthem
 Born To Run and Dancing in the Dark, during which fans were pulled up 
to groove with the band. Now everyone truly was on their feet bawling 
their lungs out. Even the selfie set had lowered their phones to watch.<br>
<br>
It was the first of a Herculean two night stand at the northside 
monolith, which will see Springsteen perform to some 160,000. He could 
probably have tacked on several further shows, so deeply is he adored in
 Ireland. Granted, Springsteen is not an artist for everyone - those of 
short attention span may have wished he had culled the obscurities and 
focused on his landmark hits. Yet he remains the world' s biggest cult 
star and as the brought the curtains down with an acoustic This Hard 
Land every last person in Croke Park will have felt he was singing his 
big heart out for them and them alone.<br>
<br>
"Hi Dublin, thanks for a wonderful night," he beamed. "The E Street Band loves you."<br>

 – the magic and madness go on<br>
The Guardian<br>
May 27, 2016</strong><br>
<br>
The Boss rocked a floodlit stadium with the energy of a young man but a voice full of dirt, guts, experience and soul<br>
 Bruce Springsteen the Etihad Stadium, Manchester.<br>
<br>
On an unseasonably damp night in Manchester, in a soulless football 
stadium, Santa Claus is coming to town. “You got to help us out, man,” 
burrs Bruce Springsteen as Father Christmas is brought out of the crowd:
 a fan holding his request on a piece of cardboard, as many have done 
successfully over the years. E Street Band guitarist Steve Van Zandt 
stands back from the mic he usually shares with his bandleader, leaving a
 gangly bloke in red fancy dress “making a list, and checking it twice” 
next to rock’s kindest superstar. Synthesiser sleigh bells ring brightly
 through the rain: there are magical gig moments, and then there’s the 
way of the Boss.<br>
<br>
Tonight’s is a more varied show than your usual Springsteen gig, 
however. Praised for his classy set-opening tributes to David Bowie and 
Prince in recent months (Rebel Rebel for the former; Purple Rain, on a 
spotlit purple stage, for the latter), he begins tonight with 1982’s 
epically mournful Atlantic City, another nod towards the yawning of the 
grave. “Everything dies, baby, that’s a fact,” the chorus goes. His 
voice is untouched by the years, full of dirt, guts and soul. Even on 
the next line – “Maybe everything that dies someday comes back” – 
there’s a mournfulness in the air that you wouldn’t expect on the first 
night of a UK tour. Still, he’s lost several band members in the past 
decade. And it doesn’t help that the gig is barely full at kick-off 
(6.53pm, to allow for its marathon length) because of tram 
cancellations. If only Bruce knew. There’s surely a song in his canon 
about the beleaguered tram operator.<br>
<br>
Tonight’s mood might be coloured by the tour’s focus, too. This is The 
River tour, focusing on the 1980 double LP which found Springsteen at an
 awkward artistic crossroads. He goes through a fair whack of its 20 
songs tonight, chronologically, thankfully with breaks to play other 
parts of his catalogue. It’s Springsteen’s White Album in many ways: not
 a record of wilful experimentalism, but one on which he’s unsure 
whether to be a raucous barroom rocker, a mainstream chart star or a 
thoughtful storyteller. On record, this is sometimes oddly jarring (he’d
 resolve the disjoint by going full lo-fi on 1982’s Nebraska, then full 
megastar on 1984’s Born in the USA). Live, it’s a much more rewarding 
experience.<br>
<br>
The rock band ramalamas are particularly pulverising tonight. Crush on 
You, one of Springsteen’s thinner songs, becomes a deliciously rough, 
full-blooded piece of garage rock. Sherry Darling is delivered with 
similar dirt and heat. An audience member is given the mic to sing a 
line, then the whole stadium yowls in. Then comes Hungry Heart, which 
was Springsteen’s first proper hit (he’d had several before with other 
people performing them: Because the Night for Patti Smith, which the 
band also play, brilliantly, later in the set, and Fire, a US No 2 for 
the Pointer Sisters). His joy at singing Hungry Heart tonight, though, 
is utterly infectious: he barrels through the crowd as he sings, a 
pensioner becoming a young man again. Later on, The River’s title track 
takes us to a very different young man: one whose young life is over all
 too quickly, having flowed through unexpected fatherhood and poverty. 
Springsteen delivers songs like this and Point Blank like perfect short 
stories, bruised, sparse and dark. They will live on without him.<br>
<br>
But tonight, life and energy endure. For the last hour, the stadium 
lights are set to full beam, as Thunder Road and Born to Run blare out 
like clarion calls. The Isley Brothers’ Shout and Bobby Jean end the 
main set, with their leader crying out “One more time! One more time!” 
like a demon possessed. It’s a madness, really, rock stardom, just like 
dressing up as Father Christmas in May. But if this isn’t magic, then 
nothing else is.</div>

    <br>
 The kind of guy you'd really like to know better: Springsteen opens his UK tour<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Springsteen in Manchester<br>
The Telegraph<br>
May 27 2016</strong><br>
<br>
It takes a perverse sense of logic to serenade a crowd with Santa Claus 
Is Coming To Town in May, but Bruce Springsteen isn't one for strict 
convention, seasonal or otherwise. The opening night of his UK tour saw 
him raise the spirits of a damp and drizzly Manchester with an 
unexpected rendition of the Christmas novelty number, little over 15 
minutes into his mammoth three-hour set.<br>
<br>
He really needn't have bothered. Springsteen's ace card is his everyman 
appeal, a performer with a natural rapport with his audience and an 
undeniable knack for an air-punching chorus. It's a feelgood quality 
that feels utterly free of contrivance. For all his squillions of record
 sales, the live arena is where he and his band truly excel.<br>
<br>
He didn't need much of an excuse on this occasion, going off on a 
prolonged walkabout into the throng during a pumping Hungry Heart, 
glad-handing the punters like a returning king. "Manchester we've got a 
crush on you!" he yelled, grinning from one ear to the other as he 
returned to the stage. <br>
<br>
Springsteen was here, ostensibly, to perform The River, the sprawling 
1980 opus that lit the touchpaper  that fired him from cultish 
songwriter to global superstar for a decade. The title track was 
particularly affecting. Bookended by some windblown harmonica, it 
swiftly became a dialogue with the crowd, Springsteen breaking from the 
verses to hold the mic aloft as the lyrics were sung back at him in a 
vast wave, a spontaneous communique between the adoring and the adored. 
Point Blank was beautiful too, a showcase for Roy Bittan to demonstrate 
the elegant economy of his piano lines. <br>
<br>
Bittan has been at Bruce's side since Born To Run, for the most part, 
and is emblematic of the kind of loyalty Springsteen seems to inspire. 
The seven-piece band, be it Nils Lofgren turning circles during a solo 
or fellow guitarist Steve Van Zandt barking a call and response with 
Springsteen at stage centre, clearly had a blast too.<br>
<br>
There was an ecstatic Johnny 99, on which The Boss's Chuck Berry riff 
served as an invitation for each member of the group to take a moment 
under the lights. The goodtime vibes reached a peak with Waiting On a 
Sunny Day. As the rain continued to fall, Springsteen brought a 
12-year-old girl out from the crowd (wielding a placard saying she 
wanted to hear said song) and embarked on a duet that drew a huge roar 
of appreciation. He may look like a tough in a Scorcese movie, but he 
invariably came across as the kind of guy you'd really like to know 
better.<br>
<br>
If this show proved anything, it's that Springsteen is a master of 
structure, peppering the set with anthems that prevented the more 
understated moments from sagging. Out On The Street was as striking as 
it was concise. Darlington County was terrific, as was Because The 
Night, the song he wrote for Patti Smith in the late Seventies.<br>
<br>
But the first encore took proceedings to a new level. His version of 
Backstreets was simply immense, replete with a Bruce guitar solo as 
impassioned as it was descriptive. And Born To Run remains arguably the 
most irresistible weapon in his arsenal. Glory Days was a reminder of 
his Eighties pomp, delivered with a conviction that, two and a half 
hours in, was little short of astonishing.<br>
<br>
Given the recent demise of Prince, it's poignant to note that 
Springsteen is one of the last great showmen of his era still doing his 
thing, the raw power of his stage persona undimmed by age or time. To 
say nothing of his music.</div>

Bruce Springsteen at Wembley<br>
London Evening Standard<br>
June 6, 2016</strong><br>
<br>
The 66-year-old somehow managed to turn Wembley’s vast prairies into a 
warm, almost personal cocoon, with undercurrents of rock-encrusted 
spiritual fervour, says John Aizlewood<br>
<br>
“What a night,” gushed Bruce Springsteen by way of introduction to his 
first Wembley Stadium concert since 2013. In fact, it was barely 6.30pm,
 but since he had a three-and-a-half-hour show to get through and a 10pm
 curfew to honour, there was little time to waste. <br>
<br>
There was voodoo afoot. Wisely, he has never troubled himself with 
attempting to re-invent the wheel, so what he does is no mystery — 
knowing how he does it certainly is. <br>
<br>
For all the opportunities for smoke and mirrors that stadium rock 
offers, some things cannot be faked. For those three-and-a-half, 
interval-free hours, the 66-year-old Springsteen refused to yield to 
time. <br>
<br>
He gambolled across Wembley with more energy than its previous 
headliners, England’s football team; he launched himself into the 
audience; he downed a fan’s pint of lager in one during Spirit In The 
Night; he dedicated the mournful Tougher Than The Rest to Muhammad Ali 
before crooning it alongside his wife, Patti Scialfa, and he allowed an 
impressively voiced little girl to almost steal the show by singing a 
chorus to Waitin’ On A Sunny Day. “London’s Got Talent,” he quipped 
afterwards. <br>
<br>
The sound wasn’t always pristine, but Springsteen somehow managed to 
turn Wembley’s vast prairies into a warm, almost personal cocoon, with 
undercurrents of rock-encrusted spiritual fervour.<br>
<br>
 The River tour was named to promote last year’s box set expansion of 
that 1980 album and the American dates saw him playing the whole thing, 
in order. Last night, before an audience including Prince Harry, 
politician George Galloway, Matt LeBlanc and Simon Mayo, Springsteen was
 less rigid. <br>
<br>
He dipped into The River, played a selection of standards (Born To Run 
sizzled, The Rising rose, Badlands thundered) and a few unlikely, 
diehard-delighting offcuts such as the rarely played I’ll Work For Your 
Love.<br>
<br>
Whether rocking out on Sherry Darling and a startlingly intense Because 
The Night, unfurling heartbreaking tales of thwarted lives on The 
River’s desperately moving title track or enticing 70,000 people to sing
 along with the refrain “You can get killed just for living in your 
American skin” on the fiercely political American Skin (41 Shots), 
Springsteen was the consummate, gimmick-free showman. <br>
<br>
Yet again he emerged as a great American troubadour relying only on 
himself, 33 of his songs and the tightly drilled E Street Band, 
instinctively attuned to every twist and turn on their leader’s highway.
 A marathon which felt like a sprint.</div>

Bruce Springsteen Manager Jon Landau Talks 'The River' Tour, Forthcoming 'Expansive' Solo Album<br>
7/21/2016 by Ray Waddell</strong><br>
 <br>
<br>
“This is a 67-year-old guy that’s out there doing the best shows of his 
life,” says longtime Bruce Springsteen manager Jon Landau, “and people 
are coming.”<br>
<br>
Indeed they are: With 1.1 million tickets sold and over $135 million in 
box office revenue, according to Billboard Boxscore, Springsteen and his
 E Street Band lead all tours in Billboard’s mid-year report. The tour, 
45 dates of which occurred during the tracking period of Nov. 10, 2015 
through June 6, 2016, is in support of The Ties That Bind: The River 
Collection, a boxed set treatment of Springsteen’s seminal 1980 double 
album The River.<br>
<br>
Not bad for a tour that almost didn’t happen. “Bruce worked very hard on
 that River boxed set: He was personally very involved in every detail 
and we loved the way it came out,” Landau tells Billboard. “We were not 
planning to do any shows, the band was scattered -- but Bruce was 
inspired by the final result, so we decided to do some shows.”<br>
<br>
The original plan was to book 20 concerts, “but in Bruce’s history he 
never did 20 of anything,” Landau says with a laugh, “so it just grew.” 
The final tally -- with no plans, at press time, to add more dates -- is
 37 arena shows in America and 27 stadium shows in Europe, followed by 
another 10 stadiums and arenas in America. The jaunt wraps Sept. 14 at 
Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass. “He’s just gotten out there and 
this thing has evolved as he’s been going along.”<br>
<br>
The original tour in support of The River, Springsteen’s fifth album, in
 1980-’81, was notable for its four-hour marathon shows, and went a long
 way toward solidifying Springsteen’s global reputation as a must-see 
live act. Landau says Springsteen wanted a similar musical feel for the 
2016 tour, at least a in terms of musical presentation. <br>
<br>
“Each tour built on the other, but among a lot of our longtime audience 
The River tour was a turning point,” Landau says. “On the recent tours 
supporting Wrecking Ball and so forth, we were travelling with a great 
horn section, wonderful singers, percussion and everything else -- up to
 about 18 people on stage. Once there was the decision that this was 
going to be revolving around The River, we wanted to get as close back 
to the original -- although of course we can never go back to the 
original situation because [keyboardist] Danny [Federici] and 
[saxophonist] Clarence [Clemons] are gone, God bless them, but as close 
as we could come to that stripped-down sound, and by its nature it’s 
more of a pure rock show.”<br>
<br>
Given that Springsteen announced in advance that he would be playing The
 River in full (although he became more selective after the tour moved 
to Europe), organizers were unsure how the ticket-buying public would 
respond. “In the U.S. in particular we announced we were doing the 
entire album as the major part of the show, and it seemed like there 
were a whole bunch of people that were just really up for it, and it did
 beautifully,” says Landau. “I think that Bruce and the band really 
enjoyed it.”<br>
<br>
Playing a two-disc, 20-song album in order requires a certain discipline
 unfamiliar to most Springsteen shows, although the artist has 
occasionally performed classic albums in their entirety in the past. 
“With a regular Bruce show, the setlist is almost more of a starting 
point -- he’s constantly making what everybody calls ‘audibles,’” Landau
 explains. “Sometimes when you look at the setlist compared with what he
 actually [played], there could be 13 or 14 different changes. This 
[2016 tour] was quite different, because he had an opening song -- one 
of the outtakes from The River, ‘Meet Me in the City Tonight’ -- and 
then he did the 20 River songs. That’s 21 songs, which is most people’s 
[entire] show. That was very unusual, because we’d never had a planned 
show like that. Then he would play a collection of classics and some of 
his biggest songs, and then his all-out encore section, so it covered a 
lot of territory. He was doing 30-plus songs a night and having a ball.”<br>
<br>
Not only did Springsteen put up the highest grossing tour of the first 
half of 2016, the artist is also responsible for the single biggest 
Boxscore so far this year, with the May 27 and 29 shows at Dublin’s 
Croke Park taking in $19,228,100 from 160,188 attendance for two 
sellouts. The shows sold out “instantly,” according to Peter Aiken, 
whose Aiken Promotions has been Springsteen’s promoter in Ireland since 
1985. “The Irish people really love him, and it’s just building and 
building,” Aiken says. “Bruce never phones it in, his shows are 100 
percent every time.”<br>
<br>
On the last tour, Springsteen stayed out of Dublin and instead played 
five shows at 30,000-capacity stadiums in such cities as Cork, Limerick,
 Kilkenny, “and it was like the circus coming to town,” Aiken says. “It 
lined it up very nicely to go to Dublin the next time he came back. We 
did two Croke Parks, and probably could have done a third one. We knew 
it was going to be big, but none of us could have foreseen it was going 
to be as big as it was.” <br>
<br>
The demand for tickets on the 2016 tour will also be remembered for 
drawing attention to anti-consumer ticket scalping tactics, with 
proposed legislation including New Jersey Representative Bill Pascrell’s
 BOSS (Better Oversight of Secondary Sales and Accountability in Concert
 Ticketing) Act citing the tour as an example of unfair ticketing 
practices. Landau declines to discuss current legislation or 
Springsteen’s status as the poster boy for these ticketing issues, but 
he did say, “Starting in 1980 when he worked with [California] 
Congressman Mel Levine, when our $12.50 tickets were being scalped at 
enormous premiums, Bruce has always been totally against scalping. And 
if there is a solution to it, naturally we’d want to be part of it.”<br>
<br>
The tour also made headlines in April when Springsteen cancelled the 
April 10 show in Greensboro, N.C., in protest of the state’s 
controversial Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act (HB2) law, 
which has been widely perceived as being anti-LGBT. Other acts followed 
suit, including Pearl Jam, Ringo Starr, Nick Jonas/Demi Lovato, and 
Maroon 5. “The Carolina cancellation was just something that had to be 
done, given the circumstances at the moment in time,” says Landau.<br>
<br>
Next up for Springsteen is a solo album, which Landau calls “a very 
different kind of record” from Springsteen. As for a release date or 
supporting tour, “it’s premature to say much about it,” Landau says. 
“It’s a wonderful record, and we’ll see how the next year unfolds. We’re
 terrible planners. You have people who know where they’re playing 18 
months from now and have all of next summer’s festivals booked, and we 
just have a knack for not planning that far ahead. That’s our way.”<br>
<br>
Landau did provide a little insight into Springsteen’s creative 
direction. “All I can say is that there is a solo record -- and when I 
say solo record, I’m not talking about an acoustic record,” he says. “It
 is, in fact, a very expansive record, a very rich record. It’s one of 
Bruce’s very creative efforts. Stay tuned, and we’ll see exactly how 
that shapes up next year.”<br>
<br>
Landau says from his observation that the live music business is “very 
healthy,” and was particularly impressed by the wealth of shows, venues 
and festivals in the U.K. and Europe. The success of Springsteen’s 
latter-day touring career certainly points to an artist at peak drawing 
power. In his mammoth 2012-2014 run supporting the Wrecking Ball and 
High Hopes albums, Springsteen and the E Street Band grossed a combined 
$412 million from attendance of 4.1 million to 157 shows, according to 
Boxscore. <br>
<br>
As for how Springsteen can do in some cases personal-best business some 
40 years into his career, Landau opines, “In our case, one thing that 
occurs to me as I watch the shows -- and I’m out here most of the time 
-- is Bruce remains a 100 percent live presentation,” Landau says. 
“There are no pre-records: zero. That’s how we work, that’s his idiom, 
that’s what he grew up with, that’s how he likes it. He’s one of the 
last artists who doesn’t use ear buds: he wants to hear the music 
blasting in monitors, coming right at him. <br>
<br>
“I know we’re certainly not alone in their doing this,” he concludes, 
“but I think if you want to see live live music, the choices are 
gradually narrowing. But if that’s what you want to see, we’re the place
 to come hear it, because that’s what we’re doing.”</div>

Six Air Force Thunderbirds have just roared overhead at what felt like 
inches above our backstage area, giving myself and the entire E Street 
Band a brush cut. With 20 minutes to go, I'm sitting in my trailer 
trying to decide what boots to wear. I've got a nice pair of cowboy 
boots my feet look really good in, but I'm concerned about their 
stability. Two days ago we rehearsed in full rain on the field and the 
stage became as slick as an ice pond. It was almost impossible to stand 
on. It was so slick I crashed into Mike Colucci, our cameraman, coming 
off my knee slide, his camera the only thing that kept me from launching
 out onto the soggy turf. When Jerry the umpire in "Glory Days" did his 
bit, he came running out, couldn't stop himself and executed one of the 
most painfully perfect "man slips on a banana peel" falls I've ever 
seen. This sent Steve, myself and the entire band into one of the 
biggest stress-induced laughters of our lives that lasted all the way 
back to our trailers. (A few Advil and Jerry was okay.)<br>
<br>
I better go with the combat boots I always carry. The round toes will 
give me better braking power than the pointy-toed cowboy boots when I 
hit the deck. I stuff my boots with two innersoles to make them as 
fitted as possible, zip them up snuggly around my ankles, stomp around 
in my trailer a bit and feel pretty grounded. Fifteen minutes…oh, by the
 way, I'm somewhat nervous. It's not the usual pre-show jitters, not 
"butterflies," it's not wardrobe malfunction anticipation anxiety, I'm 
talking about five minutes to beach landing, "Right Stuff" "Lord Don't 
Let Me Screw the Pooch in Front of 100 Million People" one of the 
biggest television audiences since dinosaurs first screwed on earth kind
 of semi-terror. It only lasts for a minute…I check my hair, spray it 
with something that turns it into concrete and I'm out the door.<br>
<br>
I catch sight of Patti smiling. She's been my rock all week. I put my 
arm around her and away we go. They take us by golf cart to a holding 
tunnel right off the field. The problem is there are a thousand people 
there, tv cameras, media of all kinds and general chaos. Suddenly, 
hundreds of people rush by us in a column shouting, cheering…our fans! 
And tonight also our stage builders. These are "the volunteers". They've
 been here for two weeks on their own dime in a field day after day, 
putting together and pulling apart pieces of our stage over and over 
again, theoretically achieving military precision. Now it's for real. I 
hope they've got it down because as we're escorted onto the field, 
lights in the stadium fully up, the banshee wail of 70,000 screaming 
football fanatics rising in our ears, there's nothing there. Nothing…no 
sound, no lights, no instruments, no stage, nothing but brightly lit 
unwelcoming green turf. Suddenly an army of ants come from all sides of 
what seems like nowhere. Each rolling a piece of our lifeline, our earth
 onto the field. The cavalry has arrived. What takes us on a concert day
 8 hours to do is done in five minutes. Unbelieveable. Everything in our
 world is there…we hope. We gather a few feet off the stage, form a 
circle of hands, I say a few words drowned out by the crowd and it's 
smiles all around. I've been in a lot of high stakes situations like 
this, though not exactly like this, with these people before. It's 
stressful, but our band is made for it…and it's about to begin…so happy 
warriors we bound up onto the stage.<br>
<br>
II<br>
The NFL stage manager gives me the three minute sign…two 
minutes…one…there's a guy jumping up and down on sections of the stage 
to get them to sit evenly on the grass field…30 seconds…they're still 
testing all the speakers and equipment…that's cutting it close! The 
lights in the stadium go down. The crowd erupts and Max's drumbeat opens
 "10th Avenue." I feel a white light silhouette Clarence and I for a 
moment. I hear Roy's piano. I give "C"'s hand a pat. I'm on the move 
tossing my guitar in a high arc for Kevin, my guitar tech, to catch and 
it's…"ladies and gentlemen, for the next 12 minutes we will be bringing 
the righteous and mighty power of the E Street Band into your beautiful 
home. So…step back from the guacamole dip. Put the chicken fingers down!
 And turn the TV ALL the way up!" Because, of course, there is just ONE 
thing I've got to know: "IS THERE ANYBODY ALIVE OUT THERE?!"<br>
<br>
All I know is if you were standing next to me, you would be. I feel like
 I've just taken a syringe of adrenalin straight to the heart. Before we
 came out, I had two major concerns. One, something might go wrong 
beyond my control. That completely disappeared before we hit the stage. 
Tonight our fate is in the hands of many, so no sense for useless worry.
 Two, I was worried that I would find myself 'out' of myself and not in 
the moment. My old friend Peter Wolf once said 'the strangest thing you 
can do on stage is think about what you're doing." This is true. To 
observe oneself from afar while struggling to bring the moment to life 
is an unpleasant experience. I've had it more than once. It's an 
existential problem. Unfortunately, right in my wheel house. It doesn't 
mean it's going to be a bad show. It may be a great one. It just means 
it might take time, something we don't have much of tonight. When that 
happens, I do anything to break it. Tear up the set list, call an 
audible, make a mistake, anything to get "IN." That's what you get paid 
for, TO BE HERE NOW! The power, potential and volume of your 
present-ness is a basic rock and roll promise. It's the essential 
element that holds the attention of your audience, that gives force, 
shape and authority to the evening's events. And however you get there 
on any given night, that's the road you take. "IS THERE ANYBODY ALIVE IN
 HERE?!"…there better be.<br>
<br>
I'm on top of the piano (good old boots). I'm down. One…two…three, knee 
drop in front of the microphone and I'm bending back almost flat on the 
stage. I close my eyes for a moment and when I open them, I see nothing 
but blue night sky. No band, no crowd, no stadium. I hear and feel all 
of it in the form of a great siren like din surrounding me but with my 
back nearly flat against the stage I see nothing but beautiful night sky
 with a halo of a thousand stadium suns at its edges. I take several 
deep breaths and a calm comes over me. I feel myself deeply and happily 
"IN."<br>
<br>
Since the inception of our band it was our ambition to play for 
everyone. We've achieved a lot but we haven't achieved that. Our 
audience remains tribal…that is predominantly white. On occasion, the 
Inaugural Concert, during a political campaign, touring through Africa 
in '88, particularly in Cleveland with President Obama, I looked out and
 sang "Promised Land" to the audience I intended it for, young people, 
old people, black, white, brown, cutting across religious and class 
lines. That's who I'm singing to today. Today we play for everyone. I 
pull myself upright with the mike stand back into the world, this world,
 my world, the one with everybody in it and the stadium, the crowd, my 
band, my best friends, my wife come rushing into view and it's 
"teardrops on the city…"<br>
<br>
III<br>
During "Tenth Avenue" I tell the story of my band…and other things "when
 the change was made uptown"…. It goes rushing by, then the knee slide. 
Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come Mike…BOOM! 
And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg 
off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up and…say it, say 
it, say it, say it…BLAM! BORN TO RUN…my story…Something bright and hot 
blows up behind me. I heard there were fireworks. I never saw any. Just 
the ones going off in my head. I'm out of breath. I try to slow it down.
 That ain't gonna happen. I already hear the crowd singing the last 
eight bars of "Born to Run" oh, oh, oh, oh…then it's straight into 
"Working on a Dream"…your story…and mine I hope. Steve is on my right, 
Patti on my left. I catch a smile and the wonderful choir, The Joyce 
Garrett Singers, that backed me in Washington during the Inaugural 
concert is behind us. I turn to see their faces and listen to the sound 
of their voices…"working on a dream". Done. Moments later, we're ripping
 straight into "Glory Days"…the end of the story. A last party steeped 
in merry fatalism and some laughs with my old pal, Steve. Jerry the Ump 
doesn't fall on his ass tonight. He just throws the yellow penalty flag 
for the precious 40 seconds we've gone overtime…home stretch. Everyone 
is out front now forming that great line. Out of the corner of my eye, I
 catch the horns raising their instruments high, my guitar is wheeling 
around my neck and on the seventh beat, I'm going to Disneyland. I'm 
already someplace a lot farther and more fun than that. I look around, 
we're alive, it's over, we link arms and take a bow as the stage comes 
apart beneath our feet. It's chaos again all the way back to the 
trailer. A toast…our families, friends, Jon, George, Brendan, Barbara, 
with Don Mischer, Ricky Kirshner, Glenn Weiss, Charles Coplin, and Dick 
Ebersol, the great team that put it altogether and the end of a good 
football game.<br>
<br>
IV<br>
The theory of relativity holds. On stage your exhilaration is in direct 
proportion to the void you're dancing over. A gig I always looked a 
little askance at and was a little wary of turned out to have surprising
 emotional power and resonance for me and my band. It was a high point, a
 marker of some sort and went up with the biggest shows of our work 
life. The NFL threw us an anniversary party the likes of which we'd 
never throw for ourselves (we're too fussy) with fireworks and 
everything! In the middle of their football game, they let us hammer out
 a little part of our story. I love playing long and hard but it was the
 35 years in 12 minutes…that was the trick. You start here, you end 
there, that's it. That's the time you've got to give it everything you 
have…12 minutes…give or take a few seconds. The Super Bowl is going to 
help me sell a few new records, that's what I wanted because I want 
people to hear where we are today. It'll probably put a few extra 
fannies in the seats and that's fine. We live high around here and I 
like to do good business for my record company and concert promoters. 
But what it's really about is my band remains one of the mightiest in 
the land and I want you to know it, we want to show you…because we can.<br>
<br>
By 3 am, I am back home, everyone in the house fast asleep and tucked in
 bed. I am sitting in the yard over an open fire, staring up again into 
that black night sky, my ears still ringing…"Oh yeah, it's alright."</div>

Rolling Stone<br>
October 1981<br>
By Steve Pond</strong><br>
<br>
"Big businessmen and political leaders failed to rally behind us". Bobby
 Muller, speaking to about 15,000 remarkably attentive rock fans on 
August 20th at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. "And now it ultimately 
turns out to be the symbol of our generation – rock &amp; roll – that 
brings us together. . . . This is the first step in ending the silence 
that has surrounded Vietnam."<br>
<br>
To deafening applause, Muller, sitting center stage in a wheelchair, 
turned over the spotlight to Bruce Springsteen, the first of several 
rockers to play benefits for the veterans. Minutes earlier, Springsteen 
had introduced Muller with his own, terse, eloquent speech; now, he led 
the E Street Band into a dark, swelling melody and stepped to the mike 
to sing, "Long as I remember, the rain's been falling down. . . ." 
Creedence Clearwater Revival's eleven-year-old "Who'll Stop the Rain" 
was transformed into a majestic call to arms, and the next two songs 
deepended the mood: "Prove It All Night" was stripped of its usual joy, 
and Springsteen came down hard on the lines "If dreams came true, oh 
wouldn't it be nice/But this ain't no dream we're living through 
tonight." Then, without pause, he turned toward the two stage-side 
platforms full of veterans in wheelchairs and no crutches and ripped 
into "The Ties That Bind": "You been hurt and you're all cried out you 
say/You walk down the street pushing people out of your way."<br>
<br>
All proceeds from the show – the first in a six-night stand for 
Springsteen at the Sports Arena – will be split between the Vietnam 
Veterans of America (VVA) – the organization Muller heads – and the Los 
Angeles Mental Health Clinic (the VVA will receive seventy-five percent 
of the estimated $100,000 take). Shortly after Springsteen announced his
 benefit, other musicians came to the aid of the veterans: Pat Benatar's
 September 20th Detroit performance will benefit the VVA, and Charlie 
Daniels will give the organization proceeds from a Warner Amex cable TV 
concert filmed in Saratoga Springs, New York, on September 4th. "I feel 
that the Vietnam veterans have been the most mistreated and most ignored
 people I can remember in my lifetime," said Daniels, "and this is the 
third war I've been through. It's time they were looked after and 
respected in the way they deserve."<br>
<br>
Springsteen became interested in the veteran's plight through his 
friendship with disable vet Ron Kovic; he asked his manager, Jon Landau,
 to research the various veterans organization to determine which is the
 most effective, and he decided to do the show after meeting with Muller
 and VVA vice-president Michael Harbert earlier this summer.<br>
"These are people of our generation – Bruce's, mine," said Landau. "I 
think Bruce saw a lot of his high-school friends go to Vietnam. It 
sounds corny, but these people we're trying to help could have been us 
if the circumstances had been a little different." Landau said he 
expects Springsteen to continue working for the veterans in different 
ways; an official Springsteen poster is already for sale, with all 
proceeds going to the VVA.<br>
<br>
Backstage after the Springsteen show, Muller was ecstatic about the 
support his group is suddenly getting. "We tried everything," said 
Muller of his three-year-old organization. "Corporations, foundations, 
direct mail. We got thirty-five editorials in the Washington Post in 
1978, but we didn't realize a single legislative objective. You can't 
push costly benefit programs through Congress with good arguments. You 
need political strength, and that means numbers."<br>
With only 8000 members, the VVA does not have that strength. But after 
years of maneuvering, the group finally obtained a list of 1 million 
Vietnam veterans, and money from the concerts will go towards a 
direct-mailing operation aimed at those vets. Muller said that a goal of
 50,000 members by spring and another 100,000 by the end of 1982 is 
realistic.<br>
"People don't like to think about the Vietnam vets, because everything 
about the war was negative," he said. "We shouldn't have been fighting, 
we lost. . . . But Bruce has publicly aligned himself with the lepers of
 our society and taken us out of the shadows."<br>
<br>
Springsteen made his commitment clear in his speech introducing Muller 
in Los Angeles. "It's like when you're walking down a dark street at 
night, and out of the corner of your eye you see somebody getting hurt 
in a dark alley," he said slowly. "But you keep walking on because you 
think it don't have nothing to do with you and you just want to get 
home. Vietnam turned this whole country into that dark street, and 
unless we can walk down those alleys and look into the eyes of those men
 and women, we're never gonna get home."<br>

The Book of Bruce</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
“Born to Run” isn’t just Bruce Springsteen’s signature anthem—it’s also 
the title of his 500-page autobiography, out this month, and shorthand 
for a lifelong restlessness. As Springsteen finishes one of the year’s 
top-selling international tours, he opens up to DAVID KAMP about the 
depression that has dogged him, the songs that age has deepened, and the
 key relationship he’s still unpacking.<br>
<br>
BY DAVID KAMP<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">I. THAT SIGNATURE SONG</strong><br>
<br>
About an hour before every concert, Bruce Springsteen draws up a set 
list of 31 songs, written in big, scrawly letters in marker ink and soon
 thereafter distributed to his musicians and crew in typed-up, 
printed-out form. But this list is really just a loose framework. Over 
the course of an evening, Springsteen might shake up the order, drop a 
song, call a few audibles to his seasoned, ready-for-anything E Street 
Band, or take a request or two from fans holding handwritten signs in 
the pit near the front of the stage. Or he might do all of the above and
 then some—as he did on the first of the two nights that I saw him 
perform in Gothenburg, Sweden, this summer.<br>
<br>
That night, at the last minute, Springsteen jettisoned his plan to open 
with a full-band version of “Prove It All Night,” from his 1978 album, 
Darkness on the Edge of Town, and instead began the show solo at the 
piano with “The Promise,” a fan-beloved Darkness outtake. Eight songs 
in, he again went off-list, playing a stretched-out, gospelized version 
of “Spirit in the Night,” from his first album, 1973’s Greetings from 
Asbury Park, N.J., which he followed with “Save My Love,” a sign 
request. Onward he went with tweaks and spontaneous additions, to the 
point where, by the time the show was over, it was past midnight and 
Springsteen, a man approaching his 67th birthday, had played for nearly 
four hours—his second-longest concert ever.<br>
<br>
“Yikes!” said Springsteen with mock alarm when I relayed this fact to 
him the next day, at his hotel in the Swedish port city. “I’m always in 
search of something, in search of losing myself to the music. I think we
 hit a spot last night where I was trying some songs we hadn’t played in
 a while, where maybe you’re struggling more. And then suddenly”—he 
snapped his fingers—“you catch it, and then, once you do, you may not 
want to stop.”<br>
<br>
“You have to create the show anew, and find it anew, on a nightly 
basis,” Springsteen said. “And sometimes,” he concluded, laughing, “it 
takes me longer than I thought it would.”<br>
<br>
There is one song, though, whose place and inclusion are never in doubt:
 “Born to Run.” Springsteen always slots it in near the start of his 
encore set, the clutch of seven or eight songs that see out the night. 
“It’s still at the center of my work, that song,” he said. “When it 
comes up every night, within the show, it’s monumental.” By design, 
every concert, no matter what its shape, builds up to “Born to Run” as 
the climax, with the songs that follow serving as a decompression from 
its operatic intensity.<br>
<br>
It is not uncommon for an artist to grow wary of a signature song—Robert
 Plant has referred to “Stairway to Heaven” as “that wedding song,” and 
Frank Sinatra called “Strangers in the Night” a “piece of shit”—but 
Springsteen has never tired of “Born to Run,” which he wrote at age 24 
in a small rental cottage in West Long Branch, New Jersey. Expressly 
conceived as an important work, it took him six months to piece together
 all of its elements, from the twangy, Duane Eddy–inspired guitar figure
 with which it announces itself, to its “tramps like us” refrain, to its
 appropriations of imagery from the B movies that Springsteen adored as a
 kid, pulpy road pictures like Gun Crazy, with John Dall and Peggy 
Cummins.<br>
<br>
“A good song gathers the years in,” Springsteen said. “It’s why you can 
sing it with such conviction 40 years after it’s been written. A good 
song takes on more meaning as the years pass by.”<br>
<br>
What has made “Born to Run” endure, Springsteen believes, are the words 
with which his nameless narrator implores his girl, Wendy, to join him 
on the road: “Will you walk with me out on the wire? / ’Cause baby, I’m 
just a scared and lonely rider / But I gotta know how it feels / I want 
to know if love is wild / Babe, I want to know if love is real.”<br>
<br>
“That question gets asked every single night, between me and all those 
people that are out there,” Springsteen said. “Every night, I watch the 
crowd sing it. Sing it word for word. It’s just something that 
connected.”<br>
<br>
It’s true. In Gothenburg, over two nights, I watched 120,000 Swedes 
surrender, full-throatedly and with fists pumping, to “I want to know if
 love is real”—notwithstanding the song’s otherwise acutely New 
Jersey–specific references to Highway 9 and the Palace, a now demolished
 Asbury Park amusement hall.<br>
<br>
Springsteen’s new autobiography, to be published this month by Simon 
&amp; Schuster, is also called Born to Run. Naming your book after your 
most famous song and the breakthrough album to which it lent its title 
could be seen as a sign of cash-grab expediency or outright 
laziness—plus, there is already a well-known Springsteen book called 
Born to Run, a biography by the rock critic Dave Marsh from 1979. But to
 Springsteen there was no other choice. Those three words have an 
emotional resonance for him beyond the song itself. They’re a sort of 
thumbnail memoir—a shorthand for a lifelong sense of unrest.<br>
<br>
To be sure, the latter-day Springsteen projects health and contentment. 
Onstage, he’s as limber and high-energy as ever: leaping and sliding in 
his concert uniform of black jeans, brown boots, black muscle T, gray 
vest, and gray neckerchief, and pulling in close to share a microphone 
with his wife, the singer Patti Scialfa, or his oldest friend in the 
band, the guitarist Steven Van Zandt. Offstage, across a table, he looks
 just as fantastic as he does from a distance, favoring formfitting 
snap-button western shirts that few other men his age could get away 
with; in one of our meetings, he even rocked the red-bandanna headband 
of his Born in the U.S.A. years.<br>
<br>
But, inherently, Springsteen is a brooder: a serious, unglib man given 
to puzzling out the mixed-up thoughts in his head. In other words, a 
born memoirist. When I asked him, for example, about the genesis of that
 pumped-up Born in the U.S.A. look, I was surprised by how considered a 
response I received. I was posing the question from a superficial, 
stagecraft angle: Was his evolution from the scrawny chancer on the 
cover of Darkness on the Edge of Town to the musclebound W.P.A.-poster 
hero of the mid-80s a sort of less extreme version of David Bowie–style 
shape-shifting? Was it a conscious image reboot? Springsteen’s initial 
reply was that, first and foremost, he was trying to get healthy as his 
metabolism slowed, so he took to lifting weights, and “I had a body that
 just kind of popped in six months.”<br>
<br>
“But if you want to get into it deeper,” he continued, “my father was 
built big, so there was some element of ‘O.K., I’m 34. I’m a man now.’ I
 remember my father at that age. There was the idea of creating a man’s 
body to a certain degree. I suppose I was measuring that after my dad. 
And also, perhaps, in some way, trying to please him.”<br>
<br>
Then Springsteen went deeper still. “I also found that I simply enjoyed 
the exercise,” he said. “It was perfectly Sisyphean for my 
personality—lifting something heavy up and putting it down in the same 
spot for no particularly good reason. I’ve always felt a lot in common 
with Sisyphus. I’m always rolling that rock, man. One way or another, 
I’m always rolling that rock.”<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">II. BORN TO WRITE</strong><br>
<br>
The germ of Born to Run, the book, lies in a short, diaristic piece 
Springsteen wrote for his Web site in 2009, after he and the E Street 
Band played the halftime show of Super Bowl XLIII. The logistics and 
pressure of doing the 12-minute show threw even as battle-tested a 
performer as Springsteen for a loop, and he thought the experience would
 make for a good yarn to share. “Fifteen minutes…oh, by the way, I’m 
somewhat terrified,” he wrote in one passage. “It’s not the usual 
preshow jitters, not ‘butterflies,’ not wardrobe malfunction 
nervousness, I’m talking about five minutes to beach landing, ‘Right 
Stuff,’ ‘Lord Don’t Let Me Screw the Pooch in Front of 100 Million 
People,’ ‘One of the biggest television audiences since dinosaurs first 
screwed on earth’ kind of terror.”<br>
<br>
Doing the Super Bowl show, Springsteen said, led him to discover a 
“pretty good voice to write in.” With time on his hands after the big 
game, he kept at it, writing down vignettes from his life in longhand 
while he and Scialfa were staying in Florida, where their daughter, 
Jessica, a competitive equestrian, was participating in show-jumping 
events. He was pleased with the results. In fits and starts, back at 
home in New Jersey and on tour over the next seven years, a full-blown, 
500-page autobiography eventually took shape, with no ghost or 
collaborator. Every word in the book is his own.<br>
<br>
There’s no shortage of levity in Born to Run. We learn that young Bruce,
 for all his romantic association with cars and the road, was a terrible
 driver who didn’t manage to get his license until he was in his 20s, 
and that current Bruce, like many a passionate baby-boomer in the 
vicinity of a computer keyboard, is a fan of caps lock. On the seismic 
impact of Elvis Presley’s initial appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show: 
“Somewhere in between the mundane variety acts on a routine Sunday night
 in the year of our Lord 1956…the revolution has been televised!! Right 
underneath the nose of the guardians of all that ‘is,’ who, if they were
 aware of the powers they were about to unleash, would call out the 
national gestapo to shut this shit down!!…or…sign it up quick!!”<br>
<br>
But it’s the less jocular stuff in Springsteen’s life, the material 
germane to his autobiography’s title, that gives Born to Run its 
depth—and Springsteen knows this. “I knew I was gonna ‘go there’ in the 
book,” he told me. “I had to find the roots of my own troubles and 
issues—and the joyful things that have allowed me to put on the kind of 
shows that we put on.”<br>
<br>
Van Zandt remembers the Springsteen he befriended in their teens as 
“shut down and closed in.” This was on the central–New Jersey 
garage-band circuit of the mid-1960s, when Springsteen was playing 
guitar in a combo called the Castiles and Van Zandt fronted a group 
called the Shadows. “You remember the grunge guys, with the long hair, 
staring down at their shoes? That was him,” Van Zandt said. “People were
 always wondering ‘Why are you hanging out with him? He’s such a 
weirdo.’ Some people thought he was mental.”<br>
<br>
What Van Zandt quickly came to realize was that Springsteen was 
preternaturally focused, regarding rock music as his only way forward. 
“What inspired me about him, which nobody could really understand, was 
that he was completely dedicated,” Van Zandt said. “He’s the only guy I 
know who never had another job. I had to do some other jobs and fight to
 do it full-time, where he was always full-time. I got strength from 
that.”<br>
<br>
What made Springsteen so determined? What was Bruce running from? For 
one thing, the dead-end, near-feudal circumstances into which he was 
born, living with his parents and paternal grandparents in a tumbledown 
house in Freehold, New Jersey. It sat on the same block as their church,
 St. Rose of Lima, and its affiliated convent, rectory, and school, as 
well as four other small houses, occupied by members of his father’s 
family. His father’s side was pretty much Irish-American, people named 
McNicholas, O’Hagan, and Farrell. His mother’s side, which lived just 
across the street, was Italian-American, people named Zerilli and 
Sorrentino.<br>
<br>
His father’s father’s father was called Dutch Springsteen, and Bruce has
 a handful of early childhood memories of the man (“His main thing was, 
he always had gum”), but, ethnographically speaking, the strain that 
gave Bruce his distinctive surname does not figure in his makeup—“The 
Dutch thing evaporated,” he told me. The point is, he was a classic 
central–New Jersey Roman Catholic combo platter, his family’s life 
dominated by the Church. “We collected the rice that people threw at 
weddings into bags and brought it home, and then we threw the rice at 
the next wedding, on complete strangers,” he said. “That was part of the
 show of our little street, you know?”<br>
<br>
One of the pleasures of reading Born to Run is seeing how naturally 
Springsteen’s singular, familiar songwriting voice translates to a new 
medium, prose. Recalling, in present tense, the circumscribed little 
life his family led, he writes, “The bride and her hero are whisked away
 in their long black limousine, the one that drops you off at the 
beginning of your life. The other one is just around the corner waiting 
for another day to bring the tears and take you on that short drive 
straight out Throckmorton Street to the St. Rose graveyard on the edge 
of town.” Should the rock-god thing no longer work out, this guy might 
have a future filling the late Elmore Leonard’s shoes.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">III. THIS DEPRESSION</strong><br>
<br>
Springsteen may today be a man who splits his time between a horse farm 
in his native Monmouth County, a second home in New Jersey, and luxury 
properties in Florida and L.A., but Born to Run is an emphatic 
refutation of the notion that, as a songwriter, he can no longer connect
 to the troubled and downtrodden. Especially in its early chapters, the 
book demonstrates how honestly Springsteen has come by his material. 
Cars, girls, the Shore, the workingman’s struggles, broken dreams, 
disillusioned vets—it’s all right there in his upbringing.<br>
<br>
“One of the points I’m making in the book is that, whoever you’ve been 
and wherever you’ve been, it never leaves you,” he said, expanding upon 
this thought with the most Springsteen-esque metaphor possible: “I 
always picture it as a car. All your selves are in it. And a new self 
can get in, but the old selves can’t ever get out. The important thing 
is, who’s got their hands on the wheel at any given moment?”<br>
<br>
In Born to Run, the Bruce in the driver’s seat is often the kid or the 
conflicted young man who cowered or sulked in the presence of his 
father, Doug. The Springsteen catalogue abounds with songs about 
difficult father-son relationships, such as the recriminatory “Adam 
Raised a Cain,” the rueful “My Father’s House,” and the valedictory 
leaving-home ballad “Independence Day” (“The darkness of this house has 
got the best of us”), the last of which Springsteen introduced to the 
Gothenburg crowd as a song about “two people that love each other but 
struggle to understand one another.”<br>
<br>
Doug Springsteen came from a socially immobile family rife with 
undiagnosed or undiscussed mental illness—agoraphobia, hair-pulling 
disorders, aunts who emitted inappropriate howling noises. (“As a child,
 it was simply mysterious, embarrassing and ordinary,” Bruce writes of 
life with these relatives.) Doug was a high-school dropout who drifted 
from one blue-collar job to the next—as a floor boy at a local rug mill,
 on the line at the Ford Motor plant in Edison. He was short-fused, a 
loner, and a drinker—“a bit of a Bukowski character,” as his son put it 
to me.<br>
<br>
And he didn’t get along with Bruce, treating the boy, depending on his 
own mood, with icy distance or tongue-lashing fury. Springsteen’s 
mother, on the other hand, the former Adele Zerilli, was all kindness 
and vivacity, and gainfully employed as a legal secretary. (Now 91, she 
maintains her upbeat disposition, Bruce says, despite having been 
diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease four years ago.) Adele and Doug 
stayed together to the end, to his death in 1998 at the age of 73. Most 
extraordinarily, Adele went along with Doug’s plan to pull up stakes and
 move, in 1969, with Bruce’s seven-year-old sister, Pam, from their 
native Freehold to the promised land of California, with all of their 
belongings packed atop an AMC Rambler. By this point, the mental illness
 that ran in his family had befallen Doug, leading to bouts of paranoia 
and tears, and he was eager to start his life anew—even if it meant 
leaving behind Bruce (who was not yet 20) and his other daughter, 
Virginia, who was not only a mere 17 but also a new wife and mother, 
having married the young man, Mickey Shave, who had gotten her pregnant 
in her senior year of high school. (Forty-seven years later, the Shaves 
remain happily married.)<br>
<br>
His parents’ enduring bond remains a mystery to Bruce. Adele had come 
from a family of relative wealth; her father, Anthony Zerilli, was a 
charismatic, self-made lawyer. On the other hand, he had divorced 
Adele’s mother and spent three years in Sing Sing prison for 
embezzlement (taking the rap, per family lore, for another relative). 
“What penance was she doing? What did she get out of it?,” Springsteen 
writes of his mother’s devotion to his father. He then proposes that 
“maybe knowing she had the security of a man who would not, could not, 
leave her was enough. The price, however, was steep.”<br>
<br>
I underlined that passage, and remarked to Springsteen that his thoughts
 sounded like something that had been worked out in talk therapy. He 
acknowledged this to be the case—“A lot of these ideas were things that 
I’ve parsed over quite a bit over the years”—and, in the book, he 
credits his longtime manager, Jon Landau, with connecting him to his 
first psychotherapist, in the early 1980s.<br>
<br>
Over the years, Springsteen has been forthcoming about the fact that he 
is prone to depression, for which he has sought relief through both 
therapy and antidepressants. In the book, he delves more deeply still 
into the subject. There is his clinical depression itself, he explained 
to me, and then a compounding fear that he is doomed to suffer as his 
father did. “You don’t know the illness’s parameters,” he said. “Can I 
get sick enough to where I become a lot more like my father than I 
thought I might?”<br>
<br>
He acknowledges in Born to Run that his struggles are ongoing, and 
shares stories from the not-so-distant past. “I was crushed between 
sixty and sixty-two, good for a year and out again from sixty-three to 
sixty-four,” he writes. “Not a good record.” Springsteen remained 
professionally productive during these periods, however, and he says 
that he recorded his fine 2012 album, Wrecking Ball, at one of his 
lowest ebbs, with his bandmates none the wiser. (Though, he grants, the 
song “This Depression” might have been a tip-off.)<br>
<br>
But in the privacy of home, he writes, when the blues descend, “Patti 
will observe a freight train bearing down, loaded with nitroglycerin and
 running quickly out of track.” Whereupon “she gets me to the doctors 
and says, ‘This man needs a pill.’”<br>
<br>
“If I’m being honest, I’m not completely comfortable with that part of 
the book, but that’s O.K.,” Scialfa told me. “That’s Bruce. He 
approached the book the way he would approach writing a song, and a lot 
of times, you solve something that you’re trying to figure out through 
the process of writing—you bring something home to yourself. So in that 
regard, I think it’s great for him to write about depression. A lot of 
his work comes from him trying to overcome that part of himself.”<br>
<br>
To some degree, Springsteen said, he has overcome the issues he had with
 his father. One of the book’s most moving passages occurs a few days 
before the 1990 birth of Springsteen and Scialfa’s first child, their 
son Evan. As was his impulsive wont, Doug embarked on an impromptu road 
trip, driving 400 miles south to Bruce’s house in Los Angeles from San 
Mateo, where he and Adele had made their home. Over beers at 11 a.m., 
Doug, uncharacteristically, made a small peace offering to his son. 
“Bruce, you’ve been very good to us,” he said. And then, after a pause: 
“And I wasn’t very good to you.”<br>
<br>
“That was it,” Springsteen writes. “It was all that I needed, all that was necessary.”<br>
<br>
I asked him if he ever heard the words “I love you” from his father.<br>
<br>
“No,” he said, a little pained. “The best you could get was ‘Love you, 
Pops.’ [Switching to his father’s gruff voice.] ‘Eh, me, too.’ Even 
after he had a stroke and he’d be crying, he’d still go, ‘Me, too.’ 
You’d hear his voice breaking up, but he couldn’t get out the words.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">IV. FIVE GUITARS DEEP</strong><br>
<br>
Only half in jest, Springsteen describes touring as his “trustiest form 
of self-medication,” and you can see why. He was always an exuberant 
rock performer, but with time, age, and fatherhood (he and Scialfa have a
 third grown child, Sam, a firefighter, in addition to Evan, who works 
for SiriusXM, and Jessica), he has evolved into an all-around 
entertainer, allowing more humor and goofiness into his shows. He 
gambols along the catwalks that line the stage with a puckered smile and
 arched eyebrows that recall Robert De Niro in comedy mode (his mom’s 
sunny Italian side coming out), slapping hands with fans and edging his 
famous mug into their smartphone frames for mid-song selfies. He pulls 
small children from the crowds to join him in singing “Waitin’ on a 
Sunny Day,” a simple pop song from The Rising, his 2002 album. The song 
didn’t register as a hit in the U.S. but has been embraced by Europeans 
as a Pete Seeger–style folk sing-along.<br>
<br>
A Springsteen show, even a non-four-hour one, offers almost comic 
abundance—not just in length, but in emotional dynamics, musical 
variety, and visual richness. Sometimes, there are no fewer than five 
guitars being strummed on the band’s front line—by Springsteen, Van 
Zandt, Scialfa, Nils Lofgren, and the fiddler and multi-instrumentalist 
Soozie Tyrell—with the towering, Afro’d Jake Clemons, nephew and heir of
 the late, great Clarence Clemons, picking his spots to weave through 
them all with his tenor saxophone. The three longest-serving E 
Streeters, bassist Garry Tallent, pianist Roy Bittan, and drummer Max 
Weinberg, hang back and dress nattily; compared with the flamboyant Van 
Zandt and Lofgren—the former in his trademark headscarf, the latter in 
his Artful Dodger stovepipe hat—they look like private-equity guys 
playing in a weekend hobby band. (Completing the lineup is the organist 
Charlie Giordano, who stepped in after the death of founding E Streeter 
Danny Federici, in 2008.)<br>
<br>
Springsteen and the E Street Band remain an enormous live draw. The 
River Tour ’16, nominally pegged to last year’s release of The Ties That
 Bind, a boxed set of the sprawling sessions for his 1980 double album, 
The River, was originally to encompass a mere 20 dates, but between 
popular demand and Springsteen’s ardor to perform more, it has expanded 
to a total of 75 concerts in the U.S. and Europe. As it draws to a close
 (with a final concert at Gillette Stadium, in Foxborough, 
Massachusetts, on September 14), it is on pace to be this year’s 
top-earning international tour; over its first six months, it grossed 
more than $170 million. Landau, who has been with Springsteen since 
1974, told me that when he is recognized by fans “the most common thing I
 hear is ‘Hundred-and-third show,’ or ‘This is our 45th show.’” In terms
 of loyalty and repeat attendance, he reckons, the only rock act that 
has topped Springsteen and the E Street Band historically is the 
Grateful Dead, “and I think we’re in a very respectable second place.”<br>
<br>
Plus, they’re still going strong. “We’ve never talked, not one sentence 
that I can recall, about ‘When does this stop?,’ ” Landau said. But 
Springsteen himself told me that there is no taboo surrounding the 
issues of age and aging. After all, in recent years, he has amended his 
nightly carnival barker’s call-out of his band so that it now goes, 
“You’ve just seen the heart-stopping, pants-dropping, house-rocking, 
earth-quaking, booty-shaking, Viagra-taking, love-making, legendary 
E—Street—Band!”<br>
<br>
“Playing a show brings a tremendous amount of euphoria,” Springsteen 
said, “and the danger of it is, there’s always that moment, comes every 
night, where you think, Hey, man, I’m gonna live forever! You’re feeling
 all your power. And then you come offstage, and the main thing you 
realize is ‘Well, that’s over.’ Mortality sets back in.”<br>
<br>
Three years ago, Springsteen underwent a surgical procedure to address 
the chronic numbness he was experiencing on his left side, which was 
inhibiting his ability to work the fretboard of his guitar and turned 
out to be attributable to damaged disks in his neck. The procedure 
entailed getting his throat cut open and his vocal cords temporarily 
tied off to the side to make way for the insertion of replacement 
disks—which meant that, for three months, he was unable to sing. “A 
little nerve-racking,” he said. “But it’s been very successful for me.”<br>
<br>
Springsteen recognizes that he has “a finite amount of time in which I’m
 going to continue to do what I’m doing,” he says. But absent any 
further medical crises, he has no imminent plans to dial back his 
no-holds-barred approach. Tour dates are already carefully scheduled so 
that there is always at least a day off between shows for the musicians 
to recuperate, and everyone has his or her routine for remaining 
show-ready. “You gotta be in really good shape, baby!” said the 
65-year-old Van Zandt, before ruefully commenting, over his pre-show 
beer, “I should be in better shape than I am.” Weinberg, who is also 65,
 has had eight operations on his hands and two on his back, and has had 
both shoulders reconstructed. Pre-concert, he said, he spends five 
minutes pedaling on a recumbent bike, “generating some sweat and getting
 the blood flowing.”<br>
<br>
For their boss, the Boss, the River Tour ’16 will be swiftly followed by
 a series of promotional dates for Born to Run, the book. A publisher’s 
dream, Springsteen has committed to a multitude of promotional and 
instore appearances, and has even compiled an 18-song, retrospective 
companion album, titled Chapter and Verse, which covers his career from 
the Castiles and his choogling, hairy pre-E Street outfits Steel Mill 
and the Bruce Springsteen Band all the way up to the title track of 
Wrecking Ball.<br>
<br>
I asked Springsteen if he has any plans to get involved in this year’s 
presidential election, having actively campaigned in 2008 and 2012 for 
Barack Obama. He has been silent in this cycle, though at a June concert
 at Munich’s Olympic Stadium he held up a fan’s handmade sign that read,
 FUCK TRUMP, WE WANNA DANCE WITH THE BOSS. Springsteen demurred, noting 
that an artist has only so many “bullets,” credibility-wise, to shoot. 
But, he said, “when the times have felt very drastic, I feel like, 
‘Well, I gotta put my two cents in.’ So we’ll see what happens.”<br>
<br>
What might better serve the good of the Republic is the planned release,
 sometime next year, of Springsteen’s first album of entirely new songs 
since Wrecking Ball. (His last studio album, 2014’s High Hopes, 
consisted of covers, new recordings of older songs, and orphaned songs 
from sessions for his preceding albums.) The new album, as yet untitled,
 has been finished for more than a year but has sat on the shelf while 
Springsteen has busied himself with the tour and the book.<br>
<br>
“It’s a solo record, more of a singer-songwriter kind of record,” he 
said. Intriguingly, though, it does not follow in the spare, acoustic 
tradition of such previous solo albums as Nebraska, The Ghost of Tom 
Joad, and Devils &amp; Dust. Rather, it’s inspired by a recent immersion
 in the 60s collaborations of the songwriter Jimmy Webb and the singer 
Glen Campbell, “pop records with a lot of strings and instrumentation,” 
he said. “So the record is somewhat in that vein.” That’s as much as 
he’ll reveal at the moment.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">V. THE PACT</strong><br>
<br>
A final word on “Born to Run,” the song that anchors Springsteen’s 
musical oeuvre and autobiography. Since so much of the book concerns his
 relationship with his troubled, enigmatic father, and since we had been
 speaking freely of Springsteen’s time in therapy, I asked him if I 
could offer my own amateur-psychoanalytic theory of why “Born to Run” 
has so resonated with its author.<br>
<br>
“Go ahead,” he said with a chuckle.<br>
<br>
I told him that the pact the song’s narrator makes with Wendy—“We can 
live with the sadness / I’ll love you with all the madness in my 
soul”—jumped out at me, now that I’d read the book, as the pact that 
Doug Springsteen made with Adele.<br>
<br>
Springsteen smiled. “That was their pact,” he said.<br>
<br>
“And ‘We’re gonna get to that place / Where we really want to go / And 
we’ll walk in the sun’—I’m thinking of two people who had moved, 
relatively recently at the time you wrote the song, from New Jersey to 
California.”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, my folks. I think that was the place I envisioned, was West. 
Where do people run? They run West. That’s kind of where I imagined the 
characters going.”<br>
<br>
“So,” I asked, “is ‘Born to Run’ the internal monologue of Doug Springsteen?”<br>
<br>
“I wouldn’t go that far,” Springsteen said. “I never connected this song
 particularly with my father. I mean, I think it pertains as far as 
feeling trapped internally. He did. Which is why they ended up leaving 
for California when their kids were so young. We were 19, 17, and at a 
very critical moment in our lives. In my sister’s life, particularly. 
She just had a baby! So they had to go.” Springsteen seemed to be 
warming, ever so slightly, to my premise. “In a funny way,” he said, “my
 parents actually lived this song at that particular time.”<br>
<br>
“That’s what I’m saying,” I responded. “I’m wondering if—”<br>
<br>
“—later on, it clicked in my head?” he said, finishing my thought. “I 
don’t know where things come from. At the end of the day, you don’t know
 where everything comes from. It’s very possible.”</div>

<br>
JIM FARBER<br>
THE GUARDIAN (UK) <br>
SEPTEMBER 7, 2016</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
In 2012, Bruce Springsteen released Wrecking Ball, an album groaning 
with grim tales of able-bodied men who can’t get jobs, money lenders who
 suck small towns dry and monuments torn down without regard to history 
or sentiment.<br>
<br>
At the time, it seemed an apt reflection of the lingering American 
recession. Now, it has come to light, it also reflected something 
personal.<br>
<br>
In a new interview with Vanity Fair, held to promote his upcoming 
autobiography Born to Run, the 66-year-old star talked about his 
lifelong wrestle with depression, a condition which took a particularly 
difficult turn when he was creating Wrecking Ball. Springsteen said that
 his wife Patti Scialfa likened his experience to “a freight train 
bearing down, loaded with nitroglycerin, and running quickly out of 
track”.<br>
<br>
Apparently, one song on the album, This Depression, couldn’t have been 
more literal-minded about its title. Like many of the songs on the set, 
it’s an aural slog, larded with instrumentation and fogged by dense 
production. I admit I didn’t like the track very much when it came out. 
But I listened again when I read Springsteen’s quotes and I heard 
something new. His candor led me through the cloud of the music to hear 
his experience. Amid the murk of the arrangement, I could sense a 
feeling of emotional ruin lurking there, searching for an avenue of 
expression. It clarified the song, without making it seem cut-off or 
self-involved.<br>
<br>
That’s not the way these things are supposed to work. Backstories aren’t
 meant to matter when judging a song. Trust the art, not the artist, 
we’re told. And, normally, that’s good advice. Shakespeare didn’t have 
to kill anyone to write Macbeth, just as a young Bob Dylan didn’t have 
to go off to war in order to protest it. All an artist needs is 
imagination, empathy and a mountain of skill. Springsteen long ago 
proved he has all those talents. Otherwise he would not have been able 
to record so many convincing tales of poor and struggling people decades
 after achieving fantastic wealth and success.<br>
<br>
At the same time, knowing that an artist’s real life dovetails with the 
story they tell adds a type of meaning flights of fancy can’t. That’s 
particularly true with pop stars. All of us enjoy conflating elements of
 their real life with their mythology. We freely mix, say, Jay Z’s rough
 upbringing in Brooklyn’s Marcy projects with his later persona as the 
godlike “Hova”. Something similar happens with the love songs of Joni 
Mitchell. Many of them, we know, have addressed relationships with 
specific famous men, lending them a particular frisson. Yet that never 
hobbles their use as relatable meditations on the nature of love itself.<br>
<br>
In Springsteen’s case, the mix of reality and myth doesn’t only reflect 
his recent depression. Long ago, he aestheticized one of the pivotal 
relationships in his life in one of his greatest works. Every fan knows 
that 1987’s Tunnel of Love dealt with the disillusion of Springsteen’s 
first marriage to Julianne Phillips. In song after song, he came up 
against the limitations of his fantasy about what constitutes love. The 
songs he wrote as a result rate as classics because they address the 
subject in a way anyone can relate to. But knowing that the artist was 
writing about something as he was going through awards it an extra level
 of resonance.<br>
<br>
The revelation in Springsteen’s new book that his depression has led him
 to seek psychiatric help for the last 30 years also has a fascinating 
relationship to his role as an American symbol. For decades, Springsteen
 has used classic iconography to present himself as a paragon of 
American manhood, from his use of the flag to his devotion to 
motorcycles, white t-shirts and jeans. Yet he has never represented the 
stoic old view of masculinity. John Wayne he is not. Instead, he has 
always let his emotions and vulnerabilities show.<br>
<br>
As a result, Springsteen’s increasing willingness to talk about his 
depression extends the evolution of our notion of American manhood. And 
that makes his openness especially helpful to others afflicted. The fact
 that he has suffered so profoundly while experiencing some of the 
greatest acclaim of anyone on the planet can also educate. It proves how
 resistant this “virus” can be to positive intervention. Together, all 
this blurs the line between artist, symbol and man in the best possible 
way. It adds a new layer to Springsteen’s work, while taking nothing 
away from what the songs mean to anyone who needs to make them their 
own.</div>
