# btx-backup
 backup of various BTX threads before site closes


Not sure how much I'll get. This is all in progress


For the threads I do manage to get, this will be a repository for offline copies of those threads for reading purposes. Simply download this repo and you can open each page and view it


I am also updating the pages so that all the pages point to a single assets folder. The pages are grabbed using the BTX print view button.


I got the Articles Thread, which is one of the few that seems interesting to hold on to. 88 pages.
